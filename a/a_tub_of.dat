25|$|In {{addition}} to purchasing Château de Pontchartrain, near Paris, for La Paiva and giving her an annuity of £80,000, Henckel von Donnersmarck financed {{the construction of}} the most ostentatious mansions in Paris: Hôtel de la Païva, located at 25 avenue des Champs-Élysées. The land was acquired on 11 July 1855, and the couple commissioned architect Pierre Manguin. The house was finally completed in 1866 by architect Henri Lefeul, and among the artisans who participated in its creation was the young Auguste Rodin, then working for the sculptor Albert Carrier-Belleuse. Among the mansion's celebrated features is a central staircase made of Algerian yellow marble, which matched the Donnersmarck yellow diamonds, and <b>a</b> <b>tub</b> <b>of</b> the same North African stone; another tub, made of silver, had three taps, one being for either milk or Champagne.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} found match documentation {{was from}} 9 January 1864, when Bells Life in Victoria printed the complete scores of a match between Andersons Creek and Caledonia (now St Andrews), and many noted early residents took part including James Masterton, who got five wickets in each innings. Masterton owned a rich mining claim almost opposite the Old Catholic Church in Brackenbury Street. In 1856 he caused {{quite a stir}} in the Melbourne Argus when he found 12oz. of gold in <b>a</b> <b>tub</b> <b>of</b> quartz. Others who took part were the Squires brothers who ran the Grocers Shop in the Main Street for 40 years, which {{it is now the}} Foodlands Store, Stiggants the pioneer orchardist on Pound Road, while Ewen Hugh Cameron who later represented the district in Parliament for 40 years took two wickets for Caledonia. Anderson's Creek won a brilliant victory scoring 114 to their opponents 26 and 36.|$|E
25|$|Drums {{are highly}} {{influential}} in American Indian music. Different tribes have different traditions about their drums {{and how to}} play them. For larger dance or powwow type drums, the basic construction is very similar in most tribes: a wooden frame or a carved and hollowed-out log, with rawhide buckskin or elk skin stretched out across the opening by sinew thongs. Traditionally American Indian drums are large, two to three feet in diameter, and they are played communally by groups of singers who sit around them in a circle. For smaller single-sided hand drums, a thinner frame or shell is used, and a rawhide surface is strung onto only one side, with lacing across the other. Other types include two basic styles of water drums: the Iroquois type and the Yaqui type. The Iroquois water drum is a small cup-shaped wooden vessel, with water inside it, and a moistened tanned hide stretched across the top opening; the wetness and tightness of the tanned hide produce changes in pitch as the water drum is played over time. The Yaqui type of water drum is actually a half gourd, large in size, that floats in <b>a</b> <b>tub</b> <b>of</b> water like a bubble on the surface; the outer round surface of the gourd is struck with a drum stick, and the vibrations are amplified using the tub of water as a resonator.|$|E

500|$|The 1965 season {{brought more}} {{obstacles}} for Koufax. On March 31, {{the morning after}} pitching a complete spring training game, Koufax awoke to find that his entire left arm was black and blue from hemorrhaging. Koufax returned to Los Angeles to consult with Kerlan, who advised Koufax {{that he would be}} lucky to be able to pitch once a week. Kerlan also told Koufax that he would eventually lose full use of his arm. Koufax agreed not to throw at all between games—a resolution that lasted only one start. To get himself through the games he pitched in, Koufax resorted to Empirin with codeine for the pain, which he took every night and sometimes during the fifth inning. He also took Butazolidin for inflammation, applied capsaicin-based Capsolin ointment (called [...] "atomic balm" [...] by baseball players) before each game, and soaked his arm in <b>a</b> <b>tub</b> <b>of</b> ice afterwards.|$|E
500|$|In August, Johnson {{was denied}} a {{position}} as master of the Appleby Grammar School because a master's degree from Oxford or Cambridge was required. To ensure {{that he would not}} suffer rejection again, Pope asked John Gower, a man with influence in the Appleby community, to have a degree awarded to Johnson. Gower attempted to have a degree awarded to Johnson from Oxford, but he was told that it was [...] "too much to be asked." [...] Gower then wrote to a friend of Jonathan Swift to persuade him to use his influence at the University of Dublin to have a masters awarded to Johnson, which could then be used to justify a masters awarded to Johnson from Oxford. However, Swift refused to act on Johnson's behalf. Regardless of Swift's motivation in not acting on Johnson's behalf, or how Johnson reacted to Swift's actions, it is known that Johnson then after refused to appreciate Swift as a poet, writer, or a satirist, with one exception: Swift's Tale of <b>a</b> <b>Tub,</b> <b>of</b> which Johnson doubted Swift's authorship.|$|E

Beyoncé appears {{standing in front of}} a purple background, draped by large and billowing garments. As the song progresses, her emotions are heightened; zoomed shots of tears trickling down her cheeks are shown. A man appears behind Beyoncé and begins closely embracing her in endearment. The man is nondescript, and his muscular arms grip Beyoncé's body before taking her through a series of dips and bends, while he remains mostly in the background. With tears still rolling down her cheeks, Beyoncé chants to her love interest to make love to her on the song's vocal finale. As the guitar melodies close the song, Beyoncé is seen engulfed by the colorful light and special effects. The video ends with the camera returning to a glistening Beyoncé with blackened scenery in the background.|$|E
