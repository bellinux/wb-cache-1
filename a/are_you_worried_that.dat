Why not try stumbling aimlessly from side to side? That should stop them".|$|E

Speaking of his brother's death Varian has said [...] "If I ever start {{worrying}} about something I always turn my mind back to Chris and say 'what <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>worrying</b> about <b>that</b> for?

As long as I am doing my best, am honest with people and can go to bed at night with a clear conscience, it doesn't really matter". Varian is married to Hanako Sonobe and has two children Momoko and Eiji.|$|R

The first plum shared with Nancy of the plum garden next door.

They had believed Arras, but a number of them already had come to that view of Karaduman as they observed his own testimony. 'We could tell,' one of them told me, 'that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> we would believe Karaduman. But we know drug dealers in Harlem, and we knew he was one.'" ...|$|R
5000|$|It {{makes my}} heart sad and I am {{at a loss}} for the words to {{describe}} how I feel when I think about the cancellation of ONE LIFE and ALL MY CHILDREN ... Over this past year I have met so many faces at events and countless loving and honest comments on Facebook and Twitter. I know without a doubt that these shows <b>were</b> special to <b>you</b> all. They entertained you, they got your minds off of whatever may <b>be</b> <b>worrying</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> day and got you laughing or crying instead — all in the same hour. I will miss working with a team of actors, directors, producers, cameras, makeup, wardrobe, hair, lighting, sound and every great effort that was made to keep this show going. This is a change in television culture; I believe that is why this is all so significant. I will miss the process and the fans. I LOVE YOU and loved doing it for you, with all my heart.|$|R
5000|$|... "Power Play" [...] was {{met with}} glorification from fans and with mixed {{opinions}} from television criticism. Writing for SpoilerTV, Gavin Hetherington acclaimed the episode, saying, [...] "The many developments in this episode alone has catapulted the show into its final stretch - Aria potentially joining A.D., Jessica's killer finally revealed, the baby belonging to Emily, Spencer getting {{closer to the truth}} about Mary Drake, potential shade with Lucas - how can these not make you even more excited about the final 6 episodes. I'll say it again, this is the episode I was waiting for. It's made me excited all over again just to see what will happen next, and it's about time. No more beating around the bush, no more hoping for something to happen - it's going to happen! We are getting answers and some fresh drama when I thought the pulse was slowly starting to die." [...] Paul Dailly from TV Fanatic said the episode [...] "was the jolt of life the series needed," [...] commenting that [...] "episode was great. It was a shocking episode that gave us some much-needed reveals." [...] In addition to praising costume and episode references, Rebecca Kurson from the Observer commented: [...] "The show has just two more episodes to add back some fantastic styles with the increasingly knotted plot." [...] Lauren Busser from Tell-Tale TV website gave the episode a 3.5 out of 5 stars rating. Eliza Thompson from Cosmopolitan wrote, [...] "Plot-wise, Pretty Little Liars is one of the crazier shows on TV, but even by PLL standards, Tuesday's episode [...] "Power Play" [...] was bananas. I gasped so many times that I'm offended my neighbors didn't check to see if I was suffocating, and that was before I started yelling [...] "WHAT?!" [...] at the screen. If <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> I. Marlene King and company were going to drop the ball and leave some mysteries unsolved, <b>you</b> should <b>be</b> able to rest a little easier, because [...] "Power Play" [...] set the record straight on a number of important topics." [...] Fans of the series received the plot of the episode and its development very well, praising the several revelations depicted in it.|$|R
