5|$|The {{sapphire}} bearing Yogo dike is a {{dark gray}} to green intrusive rock known as a lamprophyre. The lamprophyre is an unusual igneous rock that contains a low content of silica. The rock has a porphyritic texture with large crystals of orthopyroxene and phlogopite set in a fine grained matrix. The phlogopite crystals {{have been used to}} determine the age of the dike and its crystallization temperature (900°C (1,650°F)). The dike also contains fragments of other rock types. These xenoliths include pieces of limestone, clastic sedimentary rocks, and gneiss. In some locations, due to the abundance of xenoliths, the dike has the appearance of a limestone breccia in an igneous matrix. One gneiss fragment found as a xenolith contains corundum. The Yogo sapphires themselves are rimmed with a reaction layer of spinel and are etched, indicating that the sapphires were not in chemical equilibrium with their host, the lamprophyre magma. This suggests the sapphire crystals may have originated in an earlier rock, such as a corundum-bearing gneiss, later assimilated by the lamprophyre magma at depth. Earlier investigators had assumed that the sapphire had crystallized from the magma with the necessary high <b>aluminium</b> <b>content</b> provided by assimilation of clay rich shales of the Proterozoic Belt Supergroup sediments which are known to be present at depth in the region.|$|E

50|$|Felsic and mafic rocks {{tend to be}} less {{affected}} by carbon dioxide due to their higher <b>aluminium</b> <b>content.</b> Ultramafic rocks lack aluminium, which allows carbonate to react with magnesium silicates to form talc.

30|$|In {{the present}} study, 185 salted pretzel samples from Hessian {{bakeries}} were analysed for their <b>aluminium</b> <b>contents</b> (Table 3) and {{were found to}} be between 1 and 218 mg kg- 1. A total of 148 samples (81 %) had aluminium concentrations below 10 mg kg- 1. In 37 samples (19 %), aluminium concentrations between 10 and 218 mg kg- 1 were found (Table 3). According to generally accepted standards, aluminium concentration of such products as a rule should be below 10 mg kg- 1. This can be readily achieves since migration is technically avoidable by Teflon coating or the use of baking paper.|$|R

50|$|The {{lateritic}} bauxites {{are found}} {{mostly in the}} countries of the tropics. They were formed by lateritization of various silicate rocks such as granite, gneiss, basalt, syenite, and shale. In comparison with the iron-rich laterites, the formation of bauxites depends even more on intense weathering conditions in a location with very good drainage. This enables the dissolution of the kaolinite and the precipitation of the gibbsite. Zones with highest <b>aluminium</b> <b>content</b> are frequently located below a ferruginous surface layer. The aluminium hydroxide in the lateritic bauxite deposits is almost exclusively gibbsite.|$|E
