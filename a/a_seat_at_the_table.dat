25|$|On 6 August, the UN {{special envoy}} to Yemen, Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed, {{announced}} the suspension in Kuwait, where the talks were being held. He said that the negotiations were not a failure {{and that they would}} resume in a month at an undisclosed location. Mr. Ahmed is the second United Nations envoy to try to broker peace talks between the Houthis and other factions in Yemen since March 2015. His predecessor quit after similar peace talk efforts failed. After the breakdown of the talks, one of the Houthi negotiators, Nasser Bagazgooz, blamed the United Nations envoy for seeking what he said amounted to a military solution on behalf of the Saudi-led coalition. Previous negotiations floated the idea of forming a unity government — composed of Houthi and former Hadi government leaders. But the exiled Hadi leaders have consistently rejected any deal that would diminish their power over Yemen, and the Houthis have said that they will reject any deal that does not give them <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b>|$|E

She also listened {{to the music of}} English pop singer Dusty Springfield, and according to Knowles, her [...] "greatest music influence" [...] is her mother, Tina Knowles, who was a one-time member of the 1960s harmony group The Veltones, she is also heavily influenced by the late great Aaliyah, who influenced <b>A</b> <b>Seat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Table.</b>|$|E
500|$|In its {{accompanying}} music video, Nivea sings, dances, {{and does}} her laundry in a laundromat while accompanied by female back-up dancers. American actor Nick Cannon plays {{the part of}} Nivea's boyfriend, and lip-synchs Kelly's parts. It was listed {{as one of the}} worst visuals made in a laundromat by Phoenix New Times. In July 2013, American singer Solange Knowles performed a cover version of the song in a laundromat {{as a part of the}} [...] "Make Boring Brilliant" [...] campaign. Her performance received positive reviews from critics, who felt it was an appropriate song choice for the venue. Knowles said that she listened to the song while recording her third album <b>A</b> <b>Seat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Table</b> (2016).|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Knowles {{began to}} record music again. Her second studio album Sol-Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams (2008) {{deviated}} from the pop-oriented music of her debut to the Motown Sound of the 1960s and 1970s. It peaked at number nine on US Billboard 200 and received positive reviews from critics. She followed this {{up with the}} 1980s pop and R–inspired extended play True (2012) on Terrible Records and her imprint Saint Records. Her third studio album, <b>A</b> <b>Seat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Table</b> (2016) became her first number-one album in the United States.

2500|$|In Portugal, {{children}} go {{from house to}} house in All Saints day and All Souls Day, carrying pumpkin carved lanterns called coca, asking every one they see for Pão-por-Deus singing rhymes where they remind people why they are begging, saying [...] "...It is for me and for you, and to give to the deceased who are dead and buried" [...] or [...] "It is to share with your deceased [...] " [...] If a door is not open or the children don't get anything, they end their singing saying [...] "In this house smells like lard, here must live someone deceased". In the Azores the bread given to the children takes the shape of the top of a skull. The tradition of pão-por-Deus was already recorded in the 15th century. After this ritual begging, takes place the Magusto and big bonfires are lit with the [...] "firewood of the souls". The young people play around smothering their faces with the ashes. The ritual begging for the deceased used to take place all over the year as in several regions the dead, those who were dear, were expected to arrive and take part in the major celebrations like Christmas and a plate with food or <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> was always left for them.|$|E
2500|$|In August 2015, Google {{announced}} that devices in the Google Nexus series {{would begin to}} receive monthly security patches. Google also wrote that [...] "Nexus devices will continue to receive major updates {{for at least two}} years and security patches for the longer of three years from initial availability or 18 months from last sale of the device via the Google Store." [...] The following October, researchers at the University of Cambridge concluded that 87.7% of Android phones in use had known but unpatched security vulnerabilities due to lack of updates and support. Ron Amadeo of Ars Technica wrote also in August 2015 that [...] "Android was originally designed, above all else, to be widely adopted. Google was starting from scratch with zero percent market share, so it was happy to give up control and give everyone <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> in exchange for adoption. [...] Now, though, Android has around 75–80 percent of the worldwide smartphone market—making it not just the world's most popular mobile operating system but arguably the most popular operating system, period. As such, security has become a big issue. Android still uses a software update chain-of-command designed back when the Android ecosystem had zero devices to update, and it just doesn't work". Following news of Google's monthly schedule, some manufacturers, including Samsung and LG, promised to issue monthly security updates, but, as noted by Jerry Hildenbrand in Android Central in February 2016, [...] "instead we got a few updates on specific versions of a small handful of models. And a bunch of broken promises".|$|E
