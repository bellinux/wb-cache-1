5000|$|On 13 August 1939, {{the first}} {{prototype}} (serial K8178), {{powered by the}} Vulture engines, made its maiden flight from Brooklands. This initial flight, flown by test pilot Joseph Summers, only lasted {{for a few minutes}} due to a defect in the carburettor linkage. By this point, the smaller Wellington bomber had made its maiden flight three years earlier and quantity production of the type had started 18 months prior. When fully equipped, the calculated <b>all-up</b> <b>service</b> weight of the first prototype was 42,182lb, almost double that of the weight originally given by Vickers in its initial tender for the design. Initial flight tests with the prototype revealed the type to possess unfavourable characteristics, being slow, underpowered, and unable to maintain altitude when flown on a single engine.|$|E
