30|$|As {{the example}} of Gondo has shown here, the {{recordings}} of <b>ambient</b> <b>vibrations</b> are stable over years in dry periods. This observation has been confirmed as well by a permanent station installed at the site Preonzo (Burjánek et al. 2017). Therefore, <b>ambient</b> <b>vibrations</b> provide a robust estimate on the dynamic behavior of the rock mass itself. The seismic response does not change without any {{significant impact on the}} rock mass and its internal structure.|$|R
50|$|Implementation {{economy is}} one primary {{advantage}} of <b>ambient</b> <b>vibration</b> tests as only the (output) vibration {{of the structure}} needs to be measured. This is particularly attractive for civil engineering structures (e.g., buildings, bridges) {{where it can be}} expensive or disruptive to carry out free vibration or forced vibration tests (with known input).|$|E

50|$|In {{structural}} engineering the ERA {{is used to}} identify natural frequencies, mode shapes and damping ratios.

50|$|Microtremor {{is a low}} {{amplitude}} (in {{the order}} of micrometres) <b>ambient</b> <b>vibration</b> of the ground caused by man-made or atmospheric disturbances. The term Ambient Vibrations is now preferred {{to talk about this}} phenomenon. Observation of microtremors can give useful information on dynamic properties of the site such as predominant period and amplitude. Microtremor observations are easy to perform, inexpensive and can be applied to places with low seismicity as well, hence, microtremor measurements can be used conveniently for seismic microzonation. More detailed information on the shear wave velocity profile of the site can be obtained from microtremor array observation.|$|E
50|$|Ambient {{vibrations}} were however supplanted - {{at least}} for some time - by forced vibration techniques that allow to increase the amplitudes and control the shaking source and their system identification methods. Even though M. Trifunac showed in 1972 that ambient and forced vibrations led to the same results, the interest in <b>ambient</b> <b>vibration</b> techniques only rose in the late 1990s. They have now become quite attractive, due to their relatively low cost and convenience, and to the recent improvements in recording equipment and computation methods. The results of their low-strain dynamic probing were shown to be {{close enough to the}} dynamic characteristics measured under strong shaking, at least as long as the buildings are not severely damaged.|$|E

Our method allows us to separate the contribution of Love and Rayleigh waves as well as fundamental and higher modes. We assess the performance on SESAME synthetic models. We show that the proposed approach allows to detect weaker signals from higher modes, even when they are not visible with traditional techniques. This leads to a more accurate estimation of the dispersion curves, potentially over a broader frequency range and including larger portion of higher modes.

50|$|Vibration {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular {{phenomena}} in our daily life, from walking, voices, engine vibration, automobile, train, aircraft, wind and many more. It exists almost everywhere and at all the time. Harvesting vibration energy is of great value especially for powering mobile electronics. The following Based on the fundamental principles of triboelectric nanogenerators, various technologies have been demonstrated for harvesting vibration energy. This application of triboelectric nanogenerator has been demonstrated in the following aspects: 1. Cantilever-based technique is a classical approach for harvesting mechanical energy, especially for MEMS. By designing the contact surface of a cantilever with the top and bottom surfaces during vibration, TENG has been demonstrated for harvesting <b>ambient</b> <b>vibration</b> energy based on the contact-separation mode. 2. To harvest the energy from a backpack, we demonstrated a rationally designed TENG with integrated rhombic gridding, which greatly improved the total current output owing to the structurally multiplied unit cells connected in parallel. 3. With the use of 4 supporing springs, a harmonic resonator-based TENG has been fabricated based on the resonance induced contact-separation between the two triboelectric materials, which has been used to harvest vibration energy from an automobile engin, a sofa and a desk. 4. Recently, a three-dimensional triboelectric nanogenerator (3D-TENG) has been designed based on a hybridization mode of conjunction the vertical contact-separation mode and the in-plane sliding mode.36 The innovative design facilitates harvesting random vibration energy in multiple directions over a wide bandwidth. The 3-D TENG is designed for harvesting <b>ambient</b> <b>vibration</b> energy, especially at low frequencies, under a range of conditions in daily life, thus, opening the applications of TENG in environmental/infrastructure monitoring, charging portable electronics and internet of things.|$|E
50|$|Ambient modal identification, {{also known}} as Operational Modal Analysis (OMA), aims at {{identifying}} the modal properties of a structure based on vibration data collected when the structure is under its operating conditions, i.e., no initial excitation or known artificial excitation. The modal properties of a structure include primarily the natural frequencies, damping ratios and mode shapes. In an <b>ambient</b> <b>vibration</b> test the subject structure can be {{under a variety of}} excitation sources which are not measured but are assumed to be 'broadband random'. The latter is a notion that one needs to apply when developing an ambient identification method. The specific assumptions vary from one method to another. Regardless of the method used, however, proper modal identification requires that the spectral characteristics of the measured response reflect the properties of the modes rather than those of the excitation.|$|E
50|$|The {{obtained}} results cannot directly give {{information on}} the physical parameters (S-wave velocity, structural stiffness...) of the ground structures or civil engineering structures. Therefore, models are needed to compute these products (dispersion curve, modal shapes...) that could {{be compared with the}} experimental data. Computing a lot of models to find which agree with the data is solving the Inverse problem. The main issue of inversion is to well explore the parameter space with a limited number of computations of the model. However, the model fitting best the data is not the most interesting because parameter compensation, uncertainties on both models and data make many models with different input parameters as good compared to the data. The sensitivity of the parameters may also be very different depending on the model used. The inversion process is generally the weak point of these <b>ambient</b> <b>vibration</b> methods.|$|E
50|$|The {{analysis}} of the <b>ambient</b> <b>vibrations</b> leads to different products used to characterize the ground properties. From the easiest to the most complicated, these products are: power spectra, H/V peak, dispersion curves and autocorrelation functions.|$|R

5000|$|HVSR (H/V {{spectral}} ratio): The H/V {{technique is}} especially related to <b>ambient</b> <b>vibration</b> recordings. Bonnefoy-Claudet et al. showed that {{peaks in the}} horizontal to vertical spectral ratios {{can be linked to}} the Rayleigh ellipticity peak, the Airy phase of the Love waves and/or the SH resonance frequencies depending on the proportion of these different types of waves in the ambient noise. By chance, all these values give however approximately the same value for a given ground so that H/V peak is a reliable method to estimate the resonance frequency of the sites. For 1 sediment layer on the bedrock, this value f0 is related to the velocity of S-waves Vs and the depth of the sediments H following: [...] It can therefore be used to map the bedrock depth knowing the S-wave velocity. This frequency peak allows to constrain the possible models obtain using other seismic methods but is not enough to derive a complete ground model. Moreover, it has been shown [...] that the amplitude of the H/V peak was not related to the magnitude of the amplification.|$|E

However, vibration modes, even fundamental low-order modes, are not always identifiable for large-scale structures under <b>ambient</b> <b>vibration</b> excitation. The identifiability of vibration modes, deficiency in modal identification, and criteria to evaluate robustness of the identifiedmodes when applying output-only modal identification techniques to <b>ambient</b> <b>vibration</b> responses were scarcely studied. In this study, the mode identifiability of the cable-stayed Ting Kau Bridge using <b>ambient</b> <b>vibration</b> measurements and the influence of theexcitation intensity on the deficiency and robustness in modal identification are investigated with long-term monitoring data of acceleration responses acquired from the bridge under different excitation conditions. It is observed that a few low-order modes, including the second global mode, are not identifiable by common output-only modal identification algorithms under normal ambient excitations due to traffic and monsoon. The deficient modes can be activated and identified only when the excitation intensity attains a certain level (e. g., during strong typhoons). The reason why a few low-order modes fail to be reliably identified under weak <b>ambient</b> <b>vibration</b> excitations and the relation between the mode identifiability and the excitation intensity are addressed through comparing the frequency-domain responses under normal <b>ambient</b> <b>vibration</b> excitations and under typhoon excitations and analyzing the wind speeds corresponding to different response data samples used in modal identification.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} a new {{strategy}} for broadband, bi-directional, vibration energy harvester is presented. Often energy harvesting systems address unidirectional incoming energy, however this is a strong limitation when considering real applications; {{in fact it is}} very likely that incoming vibrations will not be aligned with the direction of motion of the harvester. Irregular vibrations along several orientations reduce the energy conversion and the harvester efficiency.
