40|$|INTRODUCTION: Timely {{referral}} {{of patients}} following asystolic death to an organ procurement organization (OPO) may increase tissue donation rates. Lack {{of education of}} health care providers and nonphysicians (<b>admitting</b> <b>department)</b> about timely referral to the OPO following asystolic death may adversely affect tissue donation rates. We hypothesized that using an in-house donation coordinator for provider education and changing the responsibility for calling the OPO from the <b>admitting</b> <b>department</b> to the licensed independent practitioner (LIP) declaring death would increase timely referral and tissue donation rates. METHODS: An education program was developed in 2005 by a newly hired in-house coordinator to highlight the importance of tissue donation. In addition, to improve timely referrals to the OPO after death, the instructions accompanying the working copy of the death certificate were altered to require the patient 2 ̆ 7 s LIP to call the OPO within 1 hour of death (early 2007). Rates for both timely referrals and tissue donors were modeled by a Poisson regression model with a log link function. RESULTS: Timely referral rates rose from 48...|$|E

We hypothesized that changing the responsibility from the <b>admitting</b> <b>department</b> to the declaring physician for calling the OPO would increase timely referral and tissue donation rates. In 2006, the instructions accompanying the working copy of the death certificate were altered to require the patient’s physician to call the OPO within one hou r of death. From 10 / 2006 to 2 / 2007 intensive communication and in-servicing was carried out in all intensive care units. Timely referral and donation rates were tabulated before and after the intervention.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 57 - 63) This project {{took place}} at Valley Presbyterian Hospital, a 363 -bed, acute-care hospital in the San Fernando Valley. As indicated by the literature reviewed, preadmission improves medical care delivery, guest relations, and the financial viability of the hospital. A systems analysis of the preadmission function of the <b>admitting</b> <b>department</b> at Valley Presbyterian Hospital was completed. Following the systems analysis, {{it became clear that}} the existing preadmission system was disorganized, inefficient, and ineffective. Admitting personnel had very little knowledge of the purpose or procedures of preadmission. By coordinating with other departments in the hospital, a formal preadmission system was developed and implemented. Specialized forms were designed, admitting personnel were given a thorough orientation as to the purpose and procedures of the system, and an admitting liaison committee was formed to monitor the new system's operation.

Here a feasibility study was made regarding the probability of implimenting a preadmit/precredit system in the <b>Admitting</b> <b>Department.</b> In order to justify the importance of preadmitting, a survey was conducted at three local hospitals where a preadmit system was in effect. These hospitals were: Memorial Hospital of Glendale, Glendale Community Hospital and St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank. This survey proved that preadmitting can be utilized effectively at BCH. The benefits of this preadmit/precredit system have been: to expedite actual admission time, and to secure all data required to establish a complete admission record for preliminary credit and collection work. Through {{the use of this}} preadmit/precredit policy, the amount of collections made increases due to the early verification of insurance benefits. This enables the hospital and patient to know if any deposits or financial counseling needs to be made, all of which helps to improve cash flow and control over patient accounts...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 75 - 84) This project addressed {{some problems}} related to admissions that are common to many acute care community hospitals in the United States, namely, poor control over accounts receivable, protracted admitting sessions and delays in the receipt of admission test results. The study was conducted at Centinela Hospital Medical Center, a Los Angeles-area hospital faced with these problems. Methodology for the project included {{a review of the}} pertinent literature (including an overview of <b>admitting</b> <b>department</b> functions and roles as well as reports dealing with solutions to the aforementioned problems) and an on-site investigation of admitting procedures at Centinela Hospital. The latter was based on direct observation and analysis of the admitting procedures practiced at the time this project was undertaken along with interviews of both hospital personnel and incoming patients. The result was the development of a preadmission subsystem (containing a preadmission testing component) as well as new preadmission forms necessary to the successful operation of the system. The system itself was presented in both written outline form and by means of an illustrative flow chart. (See more in text...|$|E

40|$|Purpose]: Therapeutic {{recommendations}} of acute cholecystitis are not consistently implemented, which generates greater patient morbidity and higher health care costs. The {{aim of this}} article is to evaluate the burden of acute cholecystitis, to detect potentially modifiable variables, and to propose a therapeutic strategy that will allow us to improve the quality of care. [Methods]: We carried out a retrospective study of patients who were admitted to the hospital from January 2010 to December 2012 using a univariate analysis of parameters including the <b>admitting</b> <b>department,</b> age, treatment administered, and length of stay. [Results]: A total of 967 patients were admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of acute cholecystitis, 692 (72  %) to the Surgery Department, 257 (26  %) to Internal Medicine-Digestive, and 18 (2  %) to other departments. Four hundred ninety-eight (51. 5  %) were operated on: 107 (21  %) on an urgent basis, 111 (22  %) at an early stage (96  h at diagnosis), and 128 (26  %) at a delayed date (other admission). Patients who were admitted into the surgery department were five times more likely to be operated on than patients admitted into other departments (p < 0. 01). Patients operated on at a late stage had a longer length of stay than early stage surgery patients (p < 0. 05) and than non-operated ones (p < 0. 05). Patients < 74  years old were more frequently operated than older ones (p < 0. 05). [Conclusions]: The non-standardized treatment of acute cholecystitis causes high clinical and surgical variability, long average stay, more readmissions, and high hospital costs. Therefore, patients with a diagnosis of acute cholecystitis should be admitted to the Surgery Department, thereby increasing the probability of receiving definite treatment. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) is {{the oldest}} and largest {{hospital}} in New England {{as well as the}} original and largest teaching hospital of the Harvard Medical School. The neuroscience units experience patient flow issues similar to those observed throughout MGH, including high bed utilization and long intraday patient wait times. This project focuses on the neuroscience units as a microcosm of the hospital. MGH consistently operates near capacity. Patients from the emergency department, the perioperative environment, intensive care units (ICUs) and other sources compete for beds. The <b>admitting</b> <b>department</b> manages the bed assignment process across MGH. Assignments are often made without access to all relevant information, such as expected admission, surgery and discharge timing. As a result of common procedures, patients are frequently assigned to a bed before they are clinically ready to move. Our analysis reveals that suboptimal bed assignment and patient transfer processes are among the leading root causes of intraday patient delays. The primary objective of the project is to develop a bed assignment policy to reduce intraday patient wait times. The policy consists of a bed assignment algorithm and enabling bed management processes. To account for patient acuity, the algorithm segments patients by movement (e. g., ED-to-ICU). The target maximum wait for each segment is the acceptable wait length (AWL). The algorithm ranks patients based on their ready times and the AWLs, and assigns beds primarily on a just-in-time (JIT) basis. The enabling bed management processes include small-scale early discharge and early transfer interventions to better align the intraday timing of demand for inpatient beds with available capacity. A simulation of neuroscience patient flow is used to evaluate different approaches. The model shows that adoption of the JIT policy would increase the percentage of patients who experience bed waits within the AWL for all movement types. Predicted bed waits for patients who require ICU-level care would be 30 minutes or less for 90 % of ED patients and 95 % of OR patients (improvements from historical baselines of 44 % and 91 %, respectively). Predicted bed waits for transfers to floor beds would be two hours or less for 81 % of ED patients and 93 % of OR patients (improvements from historical baselines of 63 % and 84 %, respectively). The solution significantly reduces intraday patient wait times without a major increase in hospital capacity. by Sean T. McNichols. Thesis: M. B.
