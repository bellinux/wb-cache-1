As Tunny introduces his friends to the Extraordinary Girl, Johnny becomes furious with him for leaving the group, but quickly forgives him and the three friends embrace. Heather and her boyfriend arrive. In an uneasy truce, she gives the baby to Will. Other friends show up to greet the three men they haven't seen in a year ("We're Coming Home Again"). One year later, Johnny laments that he lost the love of his life, but he accepts that he can live inside the struggle between rage and love that has defined his life. With this acceptance comes the possibility of hope ("Whatsername").|$|E

25|$|By {{the end of}} the 1920s Constructivism was the country's {{dominant}} architecture, <b>and</b> <b>surprisingly</b> {{many buildings}} of this period survive.

25|$|In {{contrast}} to most other cancers, adrenocortical neoplasms {{appear to have}} decreased expression of H19. To determine a possible cause for the downregulation of H19, Gao et al. studied the methylation of 12 CpG sites in the H19 promoter in normal, hyperplasia, adenoma and carcinoma adrenals. They found that in carcinomas, there was more methylation of CpGs than in normal, hyperplasia and adenoma adrenals. Consequently, normal H19 expression was detectable in normal and hyperplasia adrenals, but in carcinomas <b>and</b> <b>surprisingly,</b> adenomas, there was a lower H19 expression that was coupled with detectable (increased) IGF2 expression.|$|E
25|$|Further Swiss {{legislation}} mandates {{a stop to}} {{road building}} in the Alps and a shift in transportation policy (Article on the Protection of the Alps, initiated by a popular initiative <b>and</b> <b>surprisingly</b> accepted by the public in 1994), the transfer of as many goods as possible from transalpine transport by road to transport by train and the setting of a Transfer Goal, a maximum number of trucks to cross the Alps by road (Traffic Transfer Act, adopted 1998). These goals however can only be accomplished with a fully functional NRLA rail link.|$|E
