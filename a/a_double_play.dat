5|$|At {{the end of}} the 1991 season, Memorial Stadium, the Orioles' {{home since}} 1954, saw its last MLB game against the Tigers. Ripken was the last Oriole to bat at the stadium, hitting into <b>a</b> <b>double</b> <b>play</b> against Detroit's Frank Tanana on Oct 6, 1991.|$|E
5|$|One {{exception}} in this rule {{occurs when the}} defense makes at least one out and attempts to complete <b>a</b> <b>double</b> <b>play</b> or triple play. An error is not charged in that situation if a wild throw allows the runner to reach safely. If a wild throw allows the runner to advance an additional base, an error may then be charged for the additional advance. However, if an accurate throw is made in time to complete <b>a</b> <b>double</b> <b>play</b> or triple play, but the fielder on the base fails to make the catch, an error may be charged.|$|E
5|$|Tinker, Evers, and Chance {{began playing}} {{together}} with the Cubs in 1902, and formed <b>a</b> <b>double</b> <b>play</b> combination that lasted through April 1912. The Cubs won the National League pennant four times from 1906 and 1910 (and the 1907 and 1908 World Series), often defeating the Giants {{en route to the}} World Series.|$|E

5|$|In , the Dodgers won a close pennant {{race against}} the Braves and the Giants, then beat the Chicago White Sox in the World Series. Koufax pitched two perfect relief innings in the Series opener, though they {{came after the}} Dodgers were already behind 11–0. Alston gave him the start in the fifth game, at the Los Angeles Coliseum in front of 92,706 fans. Koufax allowed only one run in seven innings, but lost the 1–0 game when Nellie Fox scored on <b>a</b> <b>double</b> <b>play.</b> Returning to Chicago, the Dodgers won the sixth game and the Series.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} to record two outs {{in the course of}} the same play. This is called <b>a</b> <b>double</b> <b>play.</b> Even three outs in one play, a triple play, {{is possible}}, though this is very rare. Players put out or retired must leave the field, returning to their team's dugout or bench. A runner may be stranded on base when a third out is recorded against another player on the team. Stranded runners do not benefit the team in its next turn at bat as every half-inning begins with the bases empty of runners.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} {{gameplay}} issues when the player takes {{their turn to}} bat. The AI is not developed and, when the player hits a pitch, it nearly always takes the longest possible route to the ball, making runs easier to score. It also lacks the capability to throw out a runner who is returning to a base (instead of advancing) or perform <b>a</b> <b>double</b> <b>play</b> after catching a fly ball. Furthermore, the batter can only move vertically, not horizontally, in the batter's box.|$|E

5|$|In {{the fourth}} inning, Monte Irvin {{was hit by}} a pitch between outs by Mueller and Whitey Lockman. Bobby Thomson then hit a home run to put the Giants up, 2–1. After the third out, the Dodgers came back to the plate. Reese {{grounded}} out, but Snider and Robinson hit back-to-back singles. Campanella grounded into <b>a</b> <b>double</b> <b>play</b> to end the inning. The Giants got one man on base {{in the top of the}} fifth inning, when Stanky singled with two outs. Pafko reached on an error to start off the bottom of the fifth, but was caught stealing second base; Gil Hodges and Branca both struck out to end the fifth. The only hit in the sixth inning was a single by Lockman, and the two teams entered the seventh inning with the score still 2–1.|$|E
5|$|Kirby Higbe {{replaced}} Branca on the mound, {{and ended}} the inning with the Cardinals in the lead, 3–1. Both teams combined for one {{hit in the}} fourth inning, a single by Moore. In {{the top of the}} fifth, Reese and Bruce Edwards singled, and Schultz grounded out on a bunt. Stan Rojek pinch hit for Higbe, and walked, loading the bases. Stanky grounded into <b>a</b> <b>double</b> <b>play,</b> ending the inning without the Dodgers scoring any runs. In the bottom of the fifth, Hal Gregg replaced Higbe on the mound, and retired the side in order. The sixth inning contained just one baserunner — Schoendienst — who was stranded on first after hitting a single.|$|E
5|$|Pérez was {{originally}} {{signed by the}} Colorado Rockies in 1992. Frequently praised for his defensive skills, Pérez reached the major leagues in 1996 and become the Rockies' shortstop for good in 1997. Over the next three years, he scarcely missed a game and won a Gold Glove in 2000. During 2001, he {{was traded to the}} Kansas City Royals, where he also played in 2002. The trade proved to be unpopular with both teams, and Pérez joined the San Francisco Giants for 2003 and 2004. He lost his starting job during the 2004 season and was released during that year. Pérez then signed with the Chicago Cubs, whom he finished the season with and spent most of the next two years with. He was the Cubs' starting shortstop in 2005 but was used as a reserve player in 2006 before getting traded to the Detroit Tigers during the year. He finished his career in 2007 with the Tigers. As a Tiger, he turned <b>a</b> <b>double</b> <b>play</b> which saved Justin Verlander's no-hitter, but he also had a series of positive tests for amphetamines which effectively ended his career.|$|E

5|$|Spencer {{ended the}} inning by {{throwing}} Snider out {{at home to}} keep the score 2–0. Eddie Stanky reached base after a Dodgers error, marking the second error for both teams; after another hit, the inning ended with a strikeout by Thomson. In the fourth inning, three players hit singles but did not score. Snider doubled in the fifth inning with one out, and a Jackie Robinson single made the score 3–0 for the Dodgers. The inning ended for the Dodgers on <b>a</b> <b>double</b> <b>play,</b> and Don Mueller hit a single {{in the bottom of}} the fifth before the Giants recorded three straight outs. The Dodgers opened up the game in the sixth inning, as Hodges led off with a home run. Billy Cox then reached base on an error and scored on a second error to make the game 5–0. After Labine walked to get on base, there was a rain delay, and play did not resume until that night.|$|E
5|$|The Cardinals {{were leading}} the Yankees 3–0 {{by the end}} of the inning. The Yankees failed to produce any offense in the fifth inning, but the Cardinals added to their lead by picking up a run when Billy Southworth beat the tag at home {{following}} a Jim Bottomley grounder to second base. Ruether was then replaced by Bob Shawkey, who closed out the inning by yielding two weak infield groundouts. The Yankees picked up one hit in each of the next two innings, but could not produce any runs. Yankees pitcher Myles Thomas came in to pitch a hitless ninth inning. With one out in the top of the ninth inning, Lou Gehrig hit a line drive single into right field, but Lazzeri grounded into <b>a</b> <b>double</b> <b>play,</b> ending the game as a 4–0 Cardinals victory. Haines pitched a complete game shutout, and only gave up five hits total, two of which came from Gehrig.|$|E
5|$|The Dodgers re-tied {{the game}} the next inning, however. Neal singled with one out and Wally Moon {{grounded}} into a force out at second base. Moon then advanced to second on a Larker single and scored on a Gil Hodges single to make the score 2–2. Don Demeter hit a single, the third consecutive and fourth of the inning, to load the bases but John Roseboro flew out to end the inning without further scoring. Sherry held the Braves scoreless {{in the bottom of}} the third, opening the inning with a walk but then inducing <b>a</b> <b>double</b> <b>play</b> and a foul out to quickly close it. Sherry and Willey traded scoreless innings in the fourth and fifth although the Braves threatened against Sherry in both innings, allowing two base-runners each time but escaping with no runs. Roseboro led off the top of the sixth inning with a home run to give the Dodgers a 3–2 lead. Roseboro had also hit a home run the day before against the Chicago Cubs, a game the Dodgers won to force the tie-breaker. Willey put out the next three batters to quickly end the inning, but the damage had been done.|$|E

5|$|The Yankees scored {{first for}} the second {{straight}} game, but Utley gave the lead back to Philadelphia on a three-run home run. Werth and Ibáñez drove in Utley and Howard in the third inning, which chased the starter, Burnett. David Robertson allowed another run to score on a Carlos Ruiz groundout. Eric Hinske, who entered as a pinch-hitter, scored on a ground out by Johnny Damon. Utley tied Reggie Jackson's record for most home runs in a World Series with a solo home run in the seventh inning, his fifth of the series. Howard struck out for the 12th time in the series, tying Willie Wilson's 1980 record for most strikeouts in a World Series. Ibáñez hit a solo home run to chase pitcher Phil Coke. After being hit in the hand in the first inning, Victorino was replaced defensively in the eighth inning by Ben Francisco. Lee left the game after allowing two runs to score, and Park gave up a sacrifice fly to Robinson Canó to add another earned run to Lee's line. Ryan Madson entered in the ninth to close the game, allowing one run on <b>a</b> <b>double</b> <b>play</b> but earning his first career World Series save.|$|E
5|$|Victorino was {{replaced}} defensively {{in the eighth}} inning by Ben Francisco. Lee was driven from the game after allowing a single to Damon, followed by a double by Mark Teixeira, and then a double by Rodriguez that scored both runners. Chan Ho Park relieved Lee and induced a ground out from Nick Swisher, which advanced Rodriguez to third base. Rodriguez scored on a sacrifice fly by Robinson Canó. Ryan Madson entered in the ninth to close the game, allowing a double to Posada and a single to Hideki Matsui without recording an out. Batting with men on first and third base, Jeter grounded into <b>a</b> <b>double</b> <b>play,</b> allowing Posada to score but emptying the bases. Damon singled to bring Teixeira to bat as the potential tying run, but Madson struck him out to record his first World Series save. Members of the news media, such as Gene Wojciechowski, were critical of the three-man starting rotation strategy following Game3, and contended that Burnett's poor performance was caused by insufficient rest in between starts. However, Burnett had been successful up to this point in such situations, going 4–0 with a 2.33 ERA in four career starts on short rest (less than the normal four days between starts) before this game.|$|E
5|$|Bickford was {{expected}} to start the 1948 season {{in the minor leagues}} due to lack of control. However, a friend of Boston Braves manager Billy Southworth stated that Bickford was likely better as a starting pitcher and reached the major league roster. His Major League debut was on April 24, 1948 in a 16–9 loss against the New York Giants. He entered in relief {{at the top of the}} fourth inning, after Al Lyons gave up three earned runs to start the inning. He got Sid Gordon to hit to <b>a</b> <b>double</b> <b>play</b> and after giving up a single to Johnny Mize, he retired Willard Marshall on a grounder to end the inning. He made his first career start against the Pirates, a 4–1 victory on May 19 in which he only gave up five hits. On June 7, he pitched a four-hitter in an 11–1 victory over the Chicago Cubs, throwing five perfect innings before giving up a hit to Dick Culler to start the sixth inning. He finished with an 11–5 mark and a 3.27 earned run average as the Braves won the National League pennant and advanced to the 1948 World Series against the Cleveland Indians. In his only World Series appearance, he started Game 3, where he gave up one run on four hits in 3.1 innings pitched and was charged with the loss.|$|E

5|$|Game 3 {{matched the}} Giants' Juan Marichal against Johnny Podres, though Dodgers' manager Walt Alston had {{considered}} starting reliever Larry Sherry. The pair kept the game scoreless through two innings before the Giants opened the scoring {{in the top}} of the third. José Pagán singled to lead off the inning, Marichal reached on a throwing error by the pitcher on a throw to second base which allowed Pagán to move to third, and Pagán scored on a Harvey Kuenn single. Then, while Chuck Hiller was batting, John Roseboro made an error in attempting to pickoff Marichal on second base, allowing him to advance to third. Hiller hit a fly ball to shallow left field and Marichal held at third base. Left fielder Duke Snider threw home but the ball was cut off by the third baseman, who threw to second to try to catch Kuenn in a rundown between first and second. However, the second baseman's throw to first hit Kuenn in the back, leaving him safe at first and allowing Marichal to score, to make the game 2–0. Felipe Alou then singled, Kuenn went to third, and Alou advanced to second on the throw. Podres intentionally walked Willie Mays to load the bases with one out, and induced <b>a</b> <b>double</b> <b>play</b> from Orlando Cepeda to end the inning.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, Rodríguez was {{selected}} as the American League MVP. He set a new American League record for home runs in a single season among catchers with 35. Rodríguez was also the first catcher to have more than 30home runs, 100 runs batted in, and 100 runs scored in the history of Major League Baseball. In addition, he holds the distinction of being the first catcher {{in the history of the}} league to amass more than 20home runs and 20stolen bases. From May 8, 1999 to June 1, 1999, Rodríguez had a career high 20 game hitting streak. He had 25 stolen bases, which was fifth most among catchers in the history of the league. He led the league in times grounded into <b>a</b> <b>double</b> <b>play,</b> with 31. Rodríguez was only the ninth catcher in the history of Major League Baseball to win the Most Valuable Player award, and he was the first to win it since Thurman Munson in 1976. He was named on all of the ballots, getting seven first place votes and six second place votes. Rodríguez was the sixth Puerto Rican to win the award, and the fourth player from the Texas Rangers to win it. He also won the Silver Slugger Award for the sixth time in a row and {{was selected}} Most Valuable Player by Baseball Digest. He was again named to all-star teams by the Associated Press, The Sporting News, and Baseball America. While he was hitting home runs, he wasn't taking many walks. He is one of only six players active in 2009 who have had at least 30 home runs in a season in which they had more homers than walks (34 HR, 24 BB in 1999). The others are Alfonso Soriano (39–23 in 2002, 36–33 in 2005, 33–31 in 2007), Garret Anderson (35–24 in 2000), Ryan Braun (34–29 in 2007), Joe Crede (30–28 in 2006), and José Guillén (31–24 in 2003).|$|E
