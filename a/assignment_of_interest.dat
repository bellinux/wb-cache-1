40|$|Synopsis and {{introduction}} Interest {{income is}} {{the main source of}} income to commercial banks. The <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> income to banking products is called funds transfer pricing. Traditionally, funds transfer pricing systems were tost-based; the transfer rate was based on the average costs of funds. In the seventies the shortcomings of a tost-based transfer rate were recognized and a market-based funds transfer rate was suggested as a solution (Haskins & Sells 1972, 174). At that time a single, short-term market rate was suggested as the funds transfer rate for al 1 funds (ibid). Altbough it was recognized that a single market rate did not reflect differences in maturity and interest rate risk (Tewes 1976, 32), no further efforts were initiated to overcome these shortcomings. In Germany, on the contrary, a lot of effort has been devoted {{to the development of a}} funds transfer pricing system that supports the planning and control of customer loans and deposits. The first publications explicitly articulating the need for a market-oriented funds transfer pricing system date fiom 1982. From that moment on many articles and books on this subject were published, and the Marktzinsmethode was developed. Since the Marktzinsmethud...|$|E

40|$|Legal systems {{around the}} world vary widely in how they deal with the <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> receivables. This legal variety makes it {{difficult}} for financiers to conduct their international receivables financing business. This thesis suggests an International Registration System for the <b>Assignment</b> and Security <b>Interest</b> <b>of</b> Receivables (‘IRSAR’) and proposes a model international convention for the IRSAR (‘proposed IRSAR Convention’), which could help financiers to overcome the obstacles they currently encounter. Under the proposed IRSAR Convention, the international <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> receivables would be regulated by a unified legal system with respect to priority and perfection. The IRSAR would facilitate international project financing. Furthermore, the IRSAR would enable companies to raise finance from greater ranges of investors {{around the world}} through international receivables financing and to dispose of non-performing loans more easily. The proposed IRSAR Convention would succeed the UN Convention on the <b>Assignment</b> <b>of</b> Receivables in International Trade in the attempt of establishing a registration system for international <b>assignments</b> <b>of</b> receivables. The proposed IRSAR Convention confines its scope of application by defining the assignor (or the security provider), inventing the concept of ‘Vehicle for the International Registration System’ (‘VIRS’). The proposed IRSAR Convention applies where the assignor or security provider is a VIRS. An <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> a receivable where the assignor is a VIRS and a security interest in a receivable where the security provider is a VIRS could be registered in the IRSAR. Under the proposed IRSAR Convention, priority <b>of</b> <b>assignments</b> <b>of</b> and security <b>interests</b> in receivables is determined by the order of registration in the IRSAR. The proposed IRSAR Convention would be a receivables version of the Cape Town Convention. With respect to the contents and effect of registration, it would prescribe a notice-filing system along the lines of that adopted in the UCC Article 9. With respect to the operation of the registration, it would adopt an automatic online registration system operating 24 hours a day, 365 days a year like the International Registry under the Cape Town Convention.

There are less servers than parallel single-channel service facilities and server transfer between facilities is allowed. Server transfer involves a deterministic time delay. Job interarrival times and service times follow the negative exponential distribution. Evaluated assignment procedures include, (1) rules incorporating parametrically weighted transfer times, and (2) rules permitting transfer only when a fixed minimum amount of time has elapsed. These rules have the effect <b>of</b> delaying server <b>assignment.</b> Three conclusions <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> to the practicing manager are the primary result of the simulation: (1) Increasing server transfer time increases mean flow time, flow time variance, and the percent of time the server spends transferring. (2) Using rules to delay server assignment reduces these criteria when compared with rules which do not delay assignment. A manager should consider delaying assignment when server transfer time becomes greater than zero.
