5|$|Stead {{began writing}} the novel in 2002, but her first draft was {{confusing}} and unorganized. To help her, she met editor Wendy Lamb who advised her {{to meet with}} <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> who would help critique the novel. After three years of work, Stead finished the second draft and met with Lamb who once again helped make improvements and later published the novel. Reviewers praised the description of Gracehope and main characters, {{as well as the}} performances of Coleen Marlo and David Ackroyd who voiced Thea and Peter in a subsequent audiobook publication of First Light.|$|E

25|$|In 1900 William McDougall was {{appointed}} to a part-time Readership in Experimental Psychology in Sully’s Department. Of this period Dr May Smith writes: `During this time he used to hold informal discussions in his laboratory and gathered there <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> interested in psychology’. This group formed {{the nucleus of the}} British Psychological Society which was formally inaugurated at University College on 24 October 1901. In 1920 he moved to Harvard where he succeeded Münsterberg as Professor.|$|E
25|$|In a {{judgment}} delivered on 16 July 1999 Lord Woolf, the Master of the Rolls, speaking {{on behalf of}} the Court of Appeal, upheld the judgment of the High Court. He held that Coughlan had established a legitimate expectation of a substantive nature {{as a result of the}} promise made by the Health Authority to the patients who had agreed to move from Newcourt Hospital to Mardon House. The legitimate expectation arose from the fact that the promise made to Coughlan had been specific to those premises, expressly made to <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> within the same category, conveyed in unqualified terms, and repeated and confirmed in representations made to the group.|$|E
25|$|Many {{authors and}} {{scholars}} addressed this issue. Malcolm Gladwell discuses the “Law of the Few” in his book, The Tipping Point. He suggests that highly connected and rare {{people have the}} ability to shape the world. This handful of unique people can spread the word around and create a social epidemic through their connections, charm, personality, expertise and persuasiveness. The notion that <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> can influence others and cause them to adopt products, services or behaviors was the subject of another book, The Influentials by Edward Keller and Jonathan Berry. This minority comprises a wide range of people who act as experts in their field and their opinions are highly regarded by their peers.|$|E

25|$|In a {{study done}} by social {{psychologist}} Shawn Burn, {{it was found that}} personal contact with individuals within a neighborhood is {{the most effective way to}} increase recycling within a community. In his study, he had 10 block leaders talk to their neighbors and persuade them to recycle. A comparison group was sent fliers promoting recycling. It was found that the neighbors that were personally contacted by their block leaders recycled much more than the group without personal contact. As a result of this study, Shawn Burn believes that personal contact within <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> is an important factor in encouraging recycling. Another study done by Stuart Oskamp examines the effect of neighbors and friends on recycling. It was found in his studies that people who had friends and neighbors that recycled were much more likely to also recycle than those who didn't have friends and neighbors that recycled.|$|E

After the film's release, McEntire developed a strong interest in acting and made it her second career.

In 1994, McEntire worked with director, Rob Reiner in the film, North, playing Ma Tex. The film obtained negative reviews, receiving only {{two and a half stars}} from Allmovie.|$|E
500|$|Periyar wanted {{thinking}} {{people to}} see their society as far from perfect and in urgent need of reform. He wanted the government, the political parties and social workers to identify the evils in society and boldly adopt measures to remove them. Periyar's philosophy did not differentiate social and political service. According to him, the first duty of a government is to run the social organisation efficiently, and the philosophy of religion was to organise the social system. Periyar stated that while Christian and Islamic religions were fulfilling this role, the Hindu religion remained totally unsuitable for social progress. He argued {{that the government was}} not for the people, but, in a [...] "topsy-turvy" [...] manner, the people were for the government. He attributed this situation to the state of the social system contrived for the advantage of <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>people.</b>|$|E

500|$|After realizing Edmonton as a {{suitable}} place for raising his children, McCauley soon recognized the community's need for a school. McCauley led a group of prominent men and arranged for a school to be built on land donated by the Hudson's Bay Company. The school opened in on January 2, 1882. Three years after {{the opening of the}} school, McCauley found himself and <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> paying off bills for the school. Initially, McCauley suggested that land owners be taxed with the funds going to the school, but protest followed. McCauley then decided to propose that Edmonton be designated as an official school district by the government in Ottawa, which was voted in favor of following a close vote. The school district was successfully negotiated with Ottawa, and it became {{the first of its kind}} in the North-West Territories. Edmonton became known as having the [...] "finest school system in the west of Portage la Prairie" [...] that set an example for many other following cities. McCauley served as chairman of the newly formed School Board from 1885 to 1888, when he stepped down, although he served as a trustee for 18 years following. He was nicknamed [...] "Edmonton's Father of Education" [...] in honour of his efforts to bring an education system to the community.|$|E

2500|$|Acemoglu and Robinson's major {{thesis is}} that {{economic}} prosperity depends above {{all on the}} inclusiveness {{of economic and political}} institutions. Institutions are [...] "inclusive" [...] when many people have a say in political decision-making, as opposed to cases where <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> control political institutions and are unwilling to change. They argue that a functioning democratic and pluralistic state guarantees the rule of law. The authors also argue that inclusive institutions promote economic prosperity because they provide an incentive structure that allows talents and creative ideas to be rewarded.|$|E
