40|$|A {{significant}} {{risk factor for}} osteoporotic fracture is a previous atraumatic fracture. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate whether patients with Colles fracture from minimal trauma were subsequently identified, assessed and treated for their elevated risk of fracture. Medical records at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital in Perth, Western Australia, from August 1999 to July 2000 were audited and 111 patients who had sustained a Colles fracture from minimal trauma were identified. Questionnaires were subsequently posted to participants to determine whether any assessment or treatment was undertaken outside the hospital system. According to documentation in the medical records, 9 % (10 / 111) had their bone mineral density assessed, 15 % (17 / 111) were receiving medical therapy for osteoporosis, 7 % (8 / 111) had their falls risk assessed and 51 % (58 / 111) were seen by a physiotherapist. Of the 58 who received physiotherapy, 76 % (44 / 58) received upper limb exercises and 19 % (11 / 58) received lower limb or balance exercises. Follow-up questionnaires one to two years after the fracture were returned by 43 % (48 / 111) of the sample. By this time, 37 % (18 / 48) had BMD assessed and 27 % (13 / 48) were receiving medical therapy for osteoporosis. Thirty-five per cent (17 / 48) of patients recalled being advised to increase their calcium intake. Of those who reported more than one fall during the past 12 months, 62 % (8 / 13) had been seen by a physiotherapist, 46 % (6 / 13) reported having their balance assessed and 54 % (7 / 13) reported having a home visit for <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>rails</b> etc. Despite the availability of effective treatments, a substantial proportion of patients with Colles fracture from minimal trauma are not being identified, assessed or treated for their elevated risk of subsequent osteoporotic fracture...|$|E

50|$|The {{grinding}} {{quality index}} (GQI) is a software-based template {{used to measure}} the profile <b>of</b> a <b>rail.</b> This allows the desired rail profile to be compared to the actual rail profile. GQI software makes use of laser-based hardware mounted to the front and rear <b>of</b> the <b>rail</b> grinder. The use of laser-based hardware on maintenance of way vehicles such as rail grinders allow workers and contractors take precise measurements <b>of</b> the <b>rail</b> profile before and after grinding. The GQI is rated from 0 (low priority) to 100 (high priority). Grinding Quality Software is able to record and document measurements independently and provide a GQI rating for each rail on the track for before and after each pass on the grinder. The advantage of using GQI software is the ability to produce post-grinding reports for later usage by planners to help further prioritize and monitor grinding profiles in the future. GQI reports also provide analysis on the consistency of profiling to determine if grinding operations are consistently improving or deteriorating the rail profile. The usage of GQI software also provides the ability to produce accurate <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> grinder effectiveness in real-time which allows for work to be prioritized more efficiently and be executed in a timely manner.|$|R

40|$|Railway {{infrastructure}} monitoring {{is a vital}} task {{to ensure}} rail transportation safety. A rail failure could result in not only a considerable impact on train delays and maintenance costs, but also on safety of passengers. In this article, {{the aim is to}} assess the risk <b>of</b> a <b>rail</b> failure by analyzing a type <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> surface defect called squats that are detected automatically among the huge number of records from video cameras.

40|$|Transport {{sector has}} a long {{tradition}} of using the principles of practical cost benefit analysis (CBA) in project appraisal that analyses the primary impacts of transport investments. The standard transport project assessment is necessary but not sufficient for the estimation of the wider economic impacts, which are in increasing demand among decision makers. Computable General Equilibrium models (CGE) have been proven to be powerful tools in the <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> economic impacts of infrastructure investments. In this project, GEMPACK-based dynamic regional CGE-models (RegFinDyn and RegSweDyn) have been used in the <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> investments in Finland and in Sweden. The models are fairly standard versions of the Australian TERM model, with some exceptions regarding labor market, migration, demography and agglomeration economies. The use of these models is, however, rather expensive and requires specific skills, software and knowledge. This project tackled these contradicting needs for a complex CGE-modelling and the desired easiness and flexibility of the analysis: A freely available spreadsheet tool was developed with a streamlined interface that uses a large number of previously made CGE-model simulations as basis for the assessment. The developed twin tools were named WebRailSwe and WebRailFin. The tools are made for a quantitative, first approximation of the wider economic impacts <b>of</b> large <b>rail</b> investments in the national areas of Sweden or Finland. The wider economic impacts calculated by this tool are supplementary to the results of a standard project assessment (CBA). The tools use generalised results of RegSweDyn and RegFinDyn CGE-modelling, which could be termed as ?model of a model? approach. CGE model results are used as observations to estimate regression equations where investment shock variables are used to explain the observed deviations from the base run. The four economic indicators calculated by the tools are real GDP, real household consumption, employment and population. It has been proven {{that it is possible to}} have an accessible tool that is relatively simple to use but gives results that are based on comprehensive CGE-modelling. This can be considered a promising start for a wider consideration of advanced modelling of economic impacts in the transport sector. However, the results of this project, WebRailSwe and WebRailFin, are only applicable to railway investments, and the results are calculated and presented on a spatial resolution that is rather coarse. Further work could be done to develop similar tools for road investments and other forms of transport improvements, and to increase the spatial resolution of the tools...|$|R
30|$|The study {{presented}} in the paper looks at several results of the Eastern Corridor MIS by OKI [11, 12]. Specifically, the study {{is an attempt to}} evaluate the chances for “success” <b>of</b> the <b>rail</b> transit component <b>of</b> the recommendations that resulted from the MIS. The study uses an integrated method with a more traditional “four-step” demand forecast by OKI, and station-based Light Rail Ridership Regression (LRRR) demand forecast for the proposed Oasis Line by Pelz [15]. While it would be preferable to produce original assumptions and modeling, the problem to be solved by this study—whether the Oasis Line has a good enough chance at success for Sierra Club to support and advocate for it—does not demand it. Additionally, a review <b>of</b> appropriate literature—largely <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> already-built light <b>rail</b> lines in other US cities—will be used to categorize the predicted ridership as representing a line that is a success or a probable failure.|$|R

Advocacy groups need an effective method for viability <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> the alternatives. Environmentalists may want to support LRT, but <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> its viability is important to provide judgment of any future transportation project [...]. This paper presents a method for LRT viability assessment through {{a case study of}} the “Oasis Line,” as part of the Eastern Corridor Major Investment Study (MIS) by the Ohio Kentucky and Indiana Council of Governments (OKI). The study attempts to evaluate chances for “success” <b>of</b> the <b>rail</b> transit component <b>of</b> the MIS. An integrated method is used with a traditional four-step-based demand forecast by OKI, and a development <b>of</b> station-based Light <b>Rail</b> Ridership Regression demand forecast by Pelz. The problem to be solved—whether the line has a good enough chance at success to support and advocate for it—did not demand a full rerunning of the models. A review <b>of</b> appropriate literature—largely <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> already-built light <b>rail</b> lines in other US cities—is used to characterize the predicted ridership as a success or failure. The predicted ridership falls comfortably above the low end of LRT systems in other US cities. The ridership predictions are found favorable to support the Oasis Line. Extensive literature review suggested that the public’s assessments behave in an almost entirely political fashion.|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, {{there are}} no {{systematic}} methodologies for evaluating life <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rail,</b> and few systems provide the measures of vertical and lateral forces that train exchanges with the rail. These systems are quite expensive and require the substitution of {{a portion of the}} track. In the present paper is presented a simple transducer (MPQY) for measuring, at the same time, the vertical and lateral forces. The easy installation and use of this instrument are its main characteristics. It is sufficient to put it in a hole, made in the rail web in the concurrence of the drilling axis, and connect it to the transmitting station for measuring for each convoy the vertical and lateral forces induced by each wheel. It can be also used for analysing speed and mass of trains and the specific derailment ratio. In addition, by using a damage model, it is possible to estimate the residual life <b>of</b> a <b>rail.</b> In order to do this, a linear model of rolling contact fatigue damage is implemented and tested with same experimental acquisitions. Another application of this transducer can be identified in the variation of the mechanical behaviour of ballast. In fact, by using the information coming from the MPQY and comparing it with the flexural moment measurement, it is possible to evaluate the variation of ballast behaviour with respect to time and set new parameters for ballast maintenance and train safety...|$|R

It is the first systematic review paper which investigates the role of TCIS in terms of sustainability and, additionally, represents a refined approach to TCIS and subsystems classification, {{as well as being}} an extended and detailed description of classes. Secondly, the AHP method for evaluation of TCIS and for evaluation of KPT for sustainable railways, as well as the combination of systematic review and AHP as in this paper, to the best knowledge of the authors, have not yet been used. Indeed, according to the systematic review of Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) techniques [86], the AHP method was until now (precisely from 1993 to 2015) used only two times for evaluations in the field of railway traffic or railway transportation. In both cases it was used for other purposes than that in this paper: Mandic et al. [83] proposed an improvement of the two-phase multicriteria model in Serbian railways, and Gercek et al. [49] used AHP for an <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rail</b> transit networks. Ultimately, the approach we used for criteria selection for the calculation of relative importance weights in AHP process could also be considered unique. Usually judgments are subjective and rely on expert’s opinions, surveys, etc.; but in our case, criteria were represented by the number of references.|$|R

However, the literature has given {{little attention to the}} latter; namely the evolution and impacts of regulatory reforms amongst Europe's railways. This paper fills this gap by providing an up-to-date, bottom-up <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> current <b>rail</b> regulatory practice in Europe. We develop a survey of economic regulators across Europe, thus complementing top-down studies of the impact of economic regulation by enabling a richer insight into regulatory activity and its impacts.

Our results show that European rail regulators, in general, exhibit many of the features of ideal regulation; in particular around key features such as independence, resourcing, longevity and expertise, transparency and in turn stability and predictability. However, we find that rail regulatory bodies could take a more proactive role in shaping track access charges, given their importance in respect of efficient use of the network and maintaining non-discriminatory access. Importantly, there is also scope for regulators to play a greater role in regulating the efficiency and quality of infrastructure managers, and potentially becoming more involved in the designing stages of passenger market opening as it emerges; and these changes could deliver substantial beneficial impacts for rail users and funders across Europe...|$|R

40|$|Precise <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> cyclic plastic {{deformation}} <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> track subgrade {{is essential in}} designing cost effective rail tracks. Plastic deformation <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> tracks is often underestimated due to the omission of effects of principal stress axis rotation and water content on subgrade deformation. Moisture content <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> track subgrade is influenced by infiltration, seasonal ground water table variation and climate changes. To understand the influence of principal stress axis rotation and moisture content on the {{plastic deformation}} of soil, a series of cyclic moving wheel loading tests and cyclic triaxial compression tests were performed on unsaturated Toyoura sand, using a modified multi-ring shear apparatus.

The subgrade water content variation combined with the principal stress axis rotation further increases the accumulation of the cyclic plastic deformation of subgrade under moving wheel loads.

40|$|We {{provide a}} {{retrospective}} <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> {{the effects of}} the two recent major railroad mergers in the western United States (Burlington Northern–Atchison-Topeka-Santa Fe and Union Pacific–Southern Pacific) on the price <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> transport <b>of</b> export grain. Estimation accounts for selectivity bias that arises because rail prices are observed only for routes with traffic. Despite concerns that both mergers could harm consumers by reducing carrier competition, we find that, in the long run, the mergers have had negligible effects on grain transportation prices and consumer welfare. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{recycled}} construction {{materials used in}} the structural layers <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> track substructure. The thesis describes the construction <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> track substructure, current situation in recycling of aggregates, waste management, the impact of railway structure on the environment, sampling and uncleaned rail track ballast. At {{the end of the}} theoretical part is the chapter Recycling of aggregates of the railway track bed. In the practical part, is provided the specification of properties recycled construction materials which are produced in selected facility and an <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> the established facts. First, the selected facility is characterized. Next, the technical and environmental requirements are described and then the tests of physical properties to conclusiveness quality of recycled construction materials are defined. To evaluate the possibilities of utilization is performed long-term monitoring of physical properties and then are individual results overall are valorized. Finally, the practical recommendations are formulated...|$|R
40|$|The {{paper is}} focused on {{measurement}} and analysis of dynamic effects on railway turnouts. Two same-type turnouts with different fastening elasticity were chosen. Attention was focused mainly on the crossing part of the turnout, where the highest dynamic impacts occur. The point of {{the paper is the}} <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> influence <b>of</b> soft <b>rail</b> pads on spread of dynamic energy through the construction...|$|R
5000|$|The railway {{is single}} throughout. Sidings every 40 chains; length of each siding five chains. The Company have {{sufficient}} land {{to make a}} double line. Gauge <b>of</b> <b>rails</b> 4 ft 8½ in from centre <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> to centre <b>of</b> <b>rail,</b> and 4 feet 6 inches from inside to inside <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> ... The sleepers are laid transverse. Depth of ballasting 1 foot 6 inches.|$|R
30|$|Therefore, {{it is easy}} to {{understand}} that, in high-speed railway, to perform a reliable analysis of the dynamic interaction between vehicle and superstructure {{it is not possible to}} avoid an accurate <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> the superstructure dynamic excitation, at the same time considering acceptable the assumptions <b>of</b> negligible <b>rail</b> mass and modest entity of its movements.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} Impact <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> {{transport}} on tourism development in the Czech Republic is the analysis <b>of</b> correlation between <b>rail</b> transport and tourism in the Czech Republic with reference to global trends in this field and proposition of appropriate steps to deeper and more effective cooperation. The first chapter is devoted to definition <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> transport, history <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> transport in the Czech Republic, characterization of {{the current state of}} railways in the Czech Republic, position <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> transport on the Czech transport market and use <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> transport in tourism.
