5|$|Several {{authors have}} {{suggested}} that the purpose of fungal bioluminescence is to attract arthropods to the fruit body to help disseminate spores. However, there has been no direct observation of this phenomenon. In many species, the mycelium is luminescent, but the fruit body is not, which argues against this hypothesis. Mycelial bioluminence may also function to attract animals that can potentially carry fungal spores in well-hydrated areas, as light emission from the mycelium is higher when it is hydrated. This would presumably increase the chance that spores would be deposited in <b>an</b> <b>environment</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> already optimal for growth. Basidiomycete mushrooms are known to be dependent on an adequate moisture supply for proper development. In species with a luminous mycelium, the mycelium would therefore have a dual function in performing the fungal translocation that permits transport of substances from the further environment back to the fruiting body, and in attracting disseminating vectors towards environments favorable for development of the species.|$|E

25|$|The {{aggressive}} spillover hypothesis {{suggests that}} the more aggressive a female is concerning prey, the more likely the female is to cannibalize a potential mate. The decision of a female to cannibalize a male is not defined by the nutritional value or genetic advantage (courtship dances, male aggressiveness, & large body size) of males but instead depends strictly on her aggressive state. Aggression of the female is measured by latency (speed) of attack on prey. The faster the speed of attack and consumption of prey, the higher the aggressiveness level. Females displaying aggressive characteristics tend to grow larger than other females and display continuous cannibalistic behavior. Such behavior may drive away potential mates, reducing chances of mating. Aggressive behavior is less common in <b>an</b> <b>environment</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> female-biased, because there is more competition to mate with a male. In these female dominated environments, such aggressive behavior comes with the risk of scaring away potential mates.|$|E

25|$|Since the 1980s, {{the museums}} have {{experienced}} simultaneous trends toward popularization and aestheticization. The ensuing decades have {{been marked by}} a wave of new museum buildings whose avant-garde architecture has achieved international prominence. Contributing considerably to popularization was the exhibition concept of the Musée Sentimental, which focuses on the world of un-prosaic everyday culture and experience {{and led to a}} 1989 exhibition of the same name at the Museum of Design (Museum für Gestaltung). The annual Basel Museum Night tallies around a hundred thousand museum visits while the museums attract a total of approximately 1.4 million visitors throughout the year (as of 2006). The general population credits the museums with “a leading role in providing leisure-time opportunities for education and learning”. Museums operate in <b>an</b> <b>environment</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> increasingly subject to the conditions of both the leisure market and the free market, and are recognized as an important economic and locational factor. In contrast to the state, the use of private funds in the museum field has grown considerably. Funding from patrons or sponsors plays an increasingly significant role in the financing of exhibitions, parts of collections or entire museums and is thus highly sought after. This competitive situation is further reflected in the considerable institutional autonomy of the Basel-City museums, which are the only governmental enterprises in the canton operating under the private-sector influenced method of New Public Management.|$|E
25|$|The Taiwanese {{education}} {{system has been}} praised for various reasons including its comparatively high test results and its major role in ushering Taiwan's economic development while creating one of the world’s most highly educated workforces. The country has also been praised for its high university entrance rate where the university acceptance rate has increased from around 20 percent before the 1970s to 49 percent in 1996 and over 90 percent since 2006, {{among the highest in}} Asia. The nation's high university entrance rate has created a highly skilled workforce making Taiwan one of the most highly educated countries in the world with 68.5% of Taiwanese high school students going on to attend university. Taiwan has a high percentage of its citizens holding a tertiary education degree where 45 percent of Taiwanese aged 25–64 hold a bachelors degree or higher compared with the average of 33 percent among member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). On the other hand, the system has been criticized for placing excessive pressure on students and eschewing creativity in favor of rote memorization. In addition, the system has been criticized for producing an excess supply of over-educated university graduates and a higher unemployment rate. With a large supply of university graduates seeking a limited demand of prestigious white collar jobs in <b>an</b> <b>environment</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> increasingly losing its competitive edge has led many degree holders ending up with lower end jobs with salaries far beneath than their expectations. Taiwan’s universities have also been under criticism {{for not being able to}} fully meet the requirements and demands of Taiwan’s 21st century fast-moving job market citing a skills mismatch among a large number of self-assessed overeducated university graduates that don't fit the demands of the modern Taiwanese labor market. The Taiwanese government has also been criticized for undermining the economy as it has been unable to produce enough jobs to meet the demands of numerous underemployed university graduates.|$|E

[...] Different breeds of dog seem to display different compulsions. [...] Lick granuloma, or licking repeatedly until ulcers form on the skin, affects more large dogs, like Labradors, golden retrievers, Great Danes, and Dobermans, while bull terriers, German shepherds, Old English sheepdogs, Rottweilers, wire-haired fox terriers, and springer spaniels are more likely to snap at imaginary flies or chase light and shadows. [...] These associations probably have an evolutionary basis, although Dodman does not clearly explain that aspect of the behaviors.|$|E

2500|$|Rugbrød (...) (Danish style rye bread) is a {{very common}} bread in Denmark. Rugbrød usually resembles a long brown {{extruded}} rectangle, no more than 12cm high, and 30–35cm wide, dependent upon the bread pan {{in which it is}} baked. The ingredients typically include rye flour, cracked or chopped rye kernels and seeds such as sunflower seeds, linseeds or pumpkin seeds. Sourdough is almost always the base because commercial yeasts are unsuitable. The naturally fermented dough will develop a naturally occurring Lactobacillus culture in symbiotic combination with naturally present yeasts. It is essential [...] in baking rye-based breads because the chemistry of rye flour produces <b>an</b> <b>environment</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> acidic. The most commonly present yeast species in the production of naturally leavened dough is Saccharomyces exiguus, which is more acid-tolerant than commercially produced S. cerevisiae, although the latter and other strains may also be present.

2500|$|With {{a rise in}} feminism, {{more cases}} of sexual {{harassment}} are being reported from Japanese {{women in the workplace}} and on commutes to work.

[...] The second revolves around <b>an</b> <b>environment</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> denigrating to female workers, including sexual comments, lewd pictures, or inappropriate actions by male co-workers in the workplace.

[...] This hurts their performance, undermining the idea of equality in the workplace. [...] Sexual harassment can be a double edged sword in the workplace however. [...] Some women reported that men who are caught sexually harassing female co-workers are laughing stocks. [...] Based on the Japanese idea of shame, some men, especially in large corporations, avoid sexual harassment at all costs to preserve their position. [...] Also, the opinions of men can vary greatly from department to department. [...] Women harassed in one department can meet with no resistance after being transferred.
