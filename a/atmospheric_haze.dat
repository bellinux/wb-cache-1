In 2011, the spacecraft discovered that Venus has a thin ozone layer at an altitude of 100km.|$|E
5|$|Titan was {{examined}} by both Voyager 1 and 2 in 1980 and 1981, respectively.

Voyager 2, {{which would have been}} diverted to perform the Titan flyby if Voyager 1 had been unable to, did not pass near Titan and continued on to Uranus and Neptune.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to attribution of recent climate change, the City of Melbourne, in 2002, set a target to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2020 and Moreland City Council established the Zero Moreland program, {{however not all}} metropolitan municipalities have followed, with the City of Glen Eira notably deciding in 2009 not to become carbon neutral. Melbourne {{has one of the}} largest urban footprints in the world due to its low density housing, resulting in a vast suburban sprawl, {{with a high level of}} car dependence and minimal public transport outside of inner areas. Much of the vegetation within the city are non-native species, most of European origin, and in many cases plays host to invasive species and noxious weeds. Significant introduced urban pests include the common myna, feral pigeon, brown rat, European wasp, common starling and red fox. Many outlying suburbs, particularly towards the Yarra Valley and the hills to the north-east and east, have gone for extended periods without regenerative fires leading to a lack of saplings and undergrowth in urbanised native bushland. The Department of Sustainability and Environment partially addresses this problem by regularly burning off. Several national parks have been designated around the urban area of Melbourne, including the Mornington Peninsula National Park, Port Phillip Heads Marine National Park and Point Nepean National Park in the south east, Organ Pipes National Park to the north and Dandenong Ranges National Park to the east. There are also a number of significant state parks just outside Melbourne. Responsibility for regulating pollution falls under the jurisdiction of the EPA Victoria and several local councils. Air pollution, by world standards, is classified as being good. Summer and autumn are the worst times of year for <b>atmospheric</b> <b>haze</b> in the urban area.|$|E

Band 5 was primarily used to identify cultural features. Band 6 sensed the vegetation boundaries between land, water, and landforms.

500|$|The most {{laborious}} effects sequences {{took place}} inside Spacedock; months were spent completing the station's interior shots. The effects crew tested different looks {{to make sure}} the dock interior seemed appropriately vast. [...] "We found the interior demanded some degree of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>haze,</b> even though there probably wouldn't be any in space," [...] Farrar said. To create a slightly degraded look, the crew used blue color gels for lights and shot through smoke for fill shots. They switched to diffusion filters for light passes, as using smoke for longer shots would have required time-consuming smoke level monitoring. Due to difference in the scales of the dock and ship models, it was impossible to film the Excelsior and Enterprise inside the set. Opening the dock's space doors was problematic because the lights illuminating the inside of the dock from the exterior had to be hidden from the camera to prevent lens flares. Massive fans were used to keep equipment cool and prevent the lights from melting or warping the dock's interior artwork. The realism of the dock scenes was heightened by live action footage of a cafeteria, with windows overlooking the dock interior. The cafeteria was a set built at ILM and filled with 40extras in front of a bluescreen so that the dock and Enterprise could be composited in later; matte paintings extended the ceiling of the set.|$|E
500|$|Titan, at 5,150km diameter, is {{the second}} largest moon in the Solar System and Saturn's largest. Out of all the large moons, Titan {{is the only one}} with a dense (surface {{pressure}} of 1.5atm), cold atmosphere, primarily made of nitrogen with a small fraction of methane. The dense atmosphere frequently produces bright white convective clouds, especially over the south pole region. On June 6, 2013, scientists at the IAA-CSIC reported the detection of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the upper atmosphere of Titan. On June 23, 2014, NASA claimed to have strong evidence that nitrogen in the atmosphere of Titan came from materials in the Oort cloud, associated with comets, and not from the materials that formed Saturn in earlier times. The surface of Titan, which is difficult to observe due to persistent <b>atmospheric</b> <b>haze,</b> shows only a few impact craters and is probably very young. It contains a pattern of light and dark regions, flow channels and possibly cryovolcanos. Some dark regions are covered by longitudinal dune fields shaped by tidal winds, where sand is made of frozen water or hydrocarbons. Titan is the only body in the Solar System beside Earth with bodies of liquid on its surface, in the form of methane–ethane lakes in Titan's north and south polar regions. The largest lake, Kraken Mare, is larger than the Caspian Sea. Like Europa and Ganymede, it is believed that Titan has a subsurface ocean made of water mixed with ammonia, which can erupt {{to the surface of the}} moon and lead to cryovolcanism. On July 2, 2014, NASA reported the ocean inside Titan may be [...] "as salty as the Earth's Dead Sea".|$|E

5000|$|In {{addition}} to his academic and popular contributions {{to the field of}} astronomy, Menzel was a prominent skeptic concerning the reality of UFOs. He authored or co-authored three popular books debunking UFOs: Flying Saucers - Myth - Truth - History (1953), The World of Flying Saucers (1963, co-authored with Lyle G Boyd), and The UFO Enigma (1977, co-authored with Ernest H. Taves). [...] All of Menzel's UFO books argued that UFOs are nothing more than misidentification of prosaic phenomena such as stars, clouds and airplanes; or the result of people seeing unusual atmospheric phenomena they were unfamiliar with. He often suggested that <b>atmospheric</b> <b>hazes</b> or temperature inversions could distort stars or planets, and make them appear to be larger than in reality, unusual in their shape, and in motion. In 1968, Menzel testified before the U.S. House Committee on Science and Astronautics - Symposium on UFOs, stating that he considered all UFO sightings to have natural explanations.|$|R
50|$|Haze machines, {{also called}} haze {{generators}} or hazers, produce <b>atmospheric</b> effects (<b>haze)</b> {{which tend to}} be less dense than that of fog machines, allowing them to be used in creating more subtle looks. Depending on a venue's or location's ventilation, this haze can stay in the air for hours.Because of the small particle size of the output from hazers, under 5 micrometres, a hazer typically takes longer to fill the same volume of space with a visible effect relative to a fog machine.|$|R

40|$|Voyager imaging {{observations}} of Triton {{have been used}} to investigate the characteristics of the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>hazes</b> on Triton at three wavelengths: violet (0. 41 micrometers), blue (0. 48 micrometers), and green (0. 56 micrometers). The globally averaged optical depth is wavelength dependent, varying from 0. 034 in green to 0. 063 in violet. These photometric results are dominated by the properties of localized discrete clouds rather than by those of the thinner, more widespread haze known to occur on Triton. The cloud particles are bright, with single-scattering albedos near unity at all three wavelengths, suggestive of a transparent icy condensate. The asymmetry parameter (+ 0. 6) and the wavelength dependence of the optical depth both indicate cloud particles 0. 2 - 0. 4 micrometers in radius. The clouds are concentrated at 50 - 60 deg S latitude, where opacities up to three times the global average are observed. This is the same latitude region where most of the evidence for current surface activity is found, suggesting that the clouds {{may be related to the}} plumes or at least to some process connected with the sublimation of the south polar cap. The effects of possible temporal variations in the haze opacity are examined. Increases in the haze opacity tend to redden Triton. However, the degree of reddening is not sufficient to explain the full range of observed changed in Triton over the past decade; variations in the surface properties appear to be necessary...|$|R

40|$|The {{structure}} and morphological properties of polymers produced photochemically from the UV irradiation of cyanoacetylene and cyanoacetylene mixtures {{have been examined}} to evaluate their possible contribution to the haze layers found on Titan. A structural analysis of these polymers may contribute {{to our understanding of}} the data returned from the Huygens probe of the Cassini mission that will pass through the atmosphere of Titan in the year 2004. Infrared analysis, elemental analysis, and thermal methods (thermogravimetric analysis, thermolysis, pyrolysis) were used to examine structures of polycyanoacetylenes produced by irradiation of the gas phase HC 3 N at 185 and 254 nm. The resulting brown to black polymer, which exists as small particles, is believed to be a branched chain of conjugated carbon-carbon double bonds, which, on exposure to heat, cyclizes to form a graphitic structure. Similar methods of analysis were used to show that when HC 3 N is photolyzed in the presence of Titan's other atmospheric constituents (CH 4, C 2 H 6, C 2 H 2, and CO), a copolymer is formed in which the added gases are incorporated as substituents on the polymer chain. Of special significance is the copolymer of HC 3 N and acetylene (C 2 H 2). Even in experiments where C 2 H 2 was absorbing nearly all of the incident photons, the ratio of C 2 H 2 to HC 3 N found in the resulting polymer was only 2 : 1. Scanning electron microscopy was used to visually examine the polymer particles. While pure polyacetylene particles are amorphous spheres roughly 1 micrometer in diameter, polycyanoacetylenes appear to be strands of rough, solid particles slightly smaller in size. The copolymer of HC 3 N and C 2 H 2 exhibits characteristics of both pure polymers. This is particularly important as pure polyacetylenes do not match the optical constants measured for Titan's <b>atmospheric</b> <b>hazes.</b> The copolymers produced by the incorporation of other minor atmospheric constituents, like HC 3 N, into the polyacetylenes are expected to have optical constants more comparable to those of the Titan haze...|$|R
