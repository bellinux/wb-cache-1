25|$|In {{the early}} 1970s it was {{proposed}} that the Craig-goch reservoir should be substantially increased in size with a new and higher downstream dam together with another dam to the north-west, impounding water that would otherwise have flowed down the Ystwyth valley. This scheme would have created a huge reservoir dwarfing all others in Mid Wales, and flooding miles of wild upland valleys. The proposals were eventually abandoned {{in the face of}} reducing projections for industrial water demand and an increasing <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> issues that such an expansion might create.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-1960s, growing <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> {{impact of}} many {{chemicals}} {{had led to}} a politically powerful environmental movement. Some labor leaders seized on the public's growing unease over chemicals in the environment, arguing {{that the effect of}} these compounds on worker health was even worse than the low-level exposure plants and animals received in the wild. On January 23, 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson submitted a comprehensive occupational health and safety bill to Congress. Led by the United States Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers, the legislation was widely opposed by business. Many labor leaders, including the leadership of the AFL-CIO, did not fight for the legislation, claiming workers had little interest in the bill. The legislation died in committee.|$|E

50|$|Attempts {{were made}} to develop a {{supersonic}} airliner, with the Anglo-French Concorde and Soviet Tupolev Tu-144 entering service during the 1970s, but they proved uneconomic in practice due to the high fuel consumption at supersonic speeds.

50|$|Environmental {{protection}} is a practice <b>of</b> protecting <b>the</b> natural environment on individual, organisation controlled or governmental levels, for <b>the</b> benefit <b>of</b> both <b>the</b> environment and humans. Due to <b>the</b> pressures <b>of</b> overconsumption, population and technology, the biophysical environment is being degraded, sometimes permanently. This has been recognized, and governments have begun placing restraints on activities that cause <b>environmental</b> degradation. Since <b>the</b> 1960s, activity <b>of</b> <b>environmental</b> movements has created <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> various <b>environmental</b> problems. There is no agreement on <b>the</b> extent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> impact <b>of</b> human activity and even scientific dishonesty occurs, so protection measures are occasionally debated.|$|R

30|$|With <b>the</b> recent surge <b>of</b> {{technological}} development and consumer preference to purchase newer device models and technological products, product life cycles have diminished and disposal rates have spiked. As a result, landfills and the Earth’s natural resources {{have begun to}} reach a critical apex. In response to this apex, when a technological device reaches <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> its life cycle, and it becomes obsolete, manufacturing firms now reprocess the products they produced. This practice is conducted to remain compliant with new regulations. The new regulatory regime has helped to enlighten consumer <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pertinent <b>environmental</b> issues regarding <b>the</b> matter.|$|R
