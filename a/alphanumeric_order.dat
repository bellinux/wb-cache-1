50|$|Horner {{has created}} a vast {{universe}} of personal symbols and archetypes that {{find their way to}} the surface of his paintings. Always beginning with free-form ideas, he visualizes elements (influenced by everything from conceptual art, skate culture, illustration, and family history) and puts them to canvas in a gesture reminiscent of surrealist automatic drawings. For his‘sectional’ pieces, he creates large painted studies that are then graphed out in <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>order</b> and ‘cut’ top to bottom, left to right on a grid. He works to ensure they do not resemble the original piece, that he opens himself to randomness, chance, the subconscious, where new layers of meaning emerge. Transforming one panel at a time, individual sections become both contained compositions and elements of a larger one. Once complete, he titles the piece based on thematic threads, or patterns, that have revealed themselves in the process. This interplay between structure and flow state, of finding resolution in shape, form, and thought, are a hallmark of Horner’s practice and body of work.|$|E
40|$|This {{overview}} of 25 monoclonal antibody (mAb) and five Fc fusion protein therapeutics provides brief {{descriptions of the}} candidates, recently published clinical study results and on-going Phase 3 studies. In <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>order,</b> the 2011 therapeutic antibodies to watch list comprises AIN- 457, bapineuzumab, brentuximab vedotin, briakinumab, dalotuzumab, epratuzumab, farletuzumab, girentuximab (WX-G 250), naptumomab estafenatox, necitumumab, obinutuzumab, otelixizumab, pagibaximab, pertuzumab, ramucirumab, REGN 88, reslizumab, solanezumab, T 1 h, teplizumab, trastuzumab emtansine, tremelimumab, vedolizumab, zalutumumab and zanolimumab. In <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>order,</b> the 2011 Fc fusion protein therapeutics to watch list comprises aflibercept, AMG- 386, atacicept, Factor VIII-Fc and Factor IX-Fc. Commercially-sponsored mAb and Fc fusion therapeutics that have progressed {{only as far as}} Phase 2 / 3 or 3 were included. Candidates undergoing regulatory review or products that have been approved may also be in Phase 3 studies, but these were excluded. Due to the large body of primary literature about the candidates, only selected references are given and results from recent publications and articles that were relevant to Phase 3 studies are emphasized. Current as of September 2010, the information presented here will serve as a baseline against which future progress in the development of antibody-based therapeutics can be measured...|$|E
40|$|Many high {{cognitive}} applications, such as vision {{processing and}} representation {{and understanding of}} images, often need to analyse in detail how an ongoing visual search was performed in a representative subset of the image, which may be arranged into sequences of loci, called regions of interest (ROIs). We used the Trial Making Test (TMT) in which subjects are asked to fixate a sequence of letters and numbers in a logical <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>order.</b> The main characteristic of TMT is to force the subject to perform a default and well-known path. The comparison of the expected scan-path with the observed scan-path provides a valuable method to investigate how a task force the subject to maintain a top-down internal representation of execution and how bottom-up influences the performance. We developed a mechanism that analyses the scan path using different algorithms, and we compared it with other methods: we found that fixations outside the ROI are direct influence of exploration strategy. The paper discusses the method in healthy subjects...|$|E
50|$|For this reason, when a file {{sequence}} {{has a more}} strong locality of reference, {{particularly when}} it is related to their actual contents, {{it is better to}} highlight this fact by letting their well-ordering induce an <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>ordering</b> of the filenames too. That is the case of explicit file sequences.|$|R
5000|$|Every GUI program shows {{contents}} of folders by usually ordering its files {{according to some}} criteria, mostly related to the files' metadata, like the filename. The criterion is, by default, the <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>ordering</b> of filenames, although some operating systems do that in [...] "smarter" [...] ways than others: for example [...] shouldideally be placed before , like GNOME Files and Thunar do, whereas, alphanumerically, it comes after (more on that later).Other criteria exist, like ordering files by their file type (or by their extension) and, if the same type, by either filename or last-access date, and so on.|$|R

40|$|Human metapneumovirus (hMPV), first {{described}} in 2001 [1], {{is responsible for}} causing serious respiratory illness in young children, the elderly and immunocompromised patients. Four distinct lineages of hMPV have been identified with the original nomenclature for these subgroups (A 1, A 2, B 1 and B 2), reported by van den Hoogen et al. [2], utilised by many. An alternate terminology (1 A, 1 B, 2 A and 2 B) was also published by Ishiguro et al. in 2004 [3] which has been adopted by others. However, this has caused some confusion {{in the interpretation of}} publication results as the terminology is similar yet describes different subtypes. As a result, a number of investigators have made a submission to the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV, ICTV taxonomic proposal 2012. 012 V) for the official adoption of the original terminology as an approved nomenclature for hMPV [4]. We welcome this officially approved nomenclature which should provide clarification of these subtypes in future. Therefore to assist with the interpretation of our recently published research in the 2012 special issue of Viruses: Pneumoviruses and Metapneumoviruses entitled “Diversity in Glycosaminoglycan Binding Amongst hMPV G Protein Lineages” [5] we have updated the Figure 3 in this letter (see Figure 1), showing the proposed ICTV terminology compared to the Ishiguro classification (used in our publication). Note that in the original publication the <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>order</b> for the Ishiguro classification was transposed (e. g., 1 A was referred to as A 1) ...|$|E
40|$|Analogical {{reasoning}} {{is a central}} problem both for human cognition and for artificial learning. Many aspects of this problem remain unsolved, though, and analogical {{reasoning is}} still a difficult task for machines. In this paper, we consider the problem of analogical reasoning and assume that the relevance of a solution can be measured by {{the complexity of the}} analogy. This hypothesis is tested in a basic <b>alphanumeric</b> micro-world. In <b>order</b> to compute complexity, we present specifications for a prototype language used to describe analogies. A few elementary operators for this language are exposed, and their complexity is discussed both from a theoretical and practical point of view. We expose several alternative definitions of relevance in analogical reasoning and show how they are related to complexity...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} and interesting problems in multilingual software applications is the correct ordering of names, words and alphanumeric strings. The problem becomes complicated by the existence of several different word ordering methodologies, based on language or culture specific customs. A formal mathematical method has been defined for the specification of multilingual alphanumeric specification systems. This method obeys all the traditional ordering processes of various cultures. In the present paper this method is modified and presented as an algorithm for efficient use within software applications. 1. Introduction One {{of the most}} important and interesting problems in multilingual software applications is to correctly order names, words and <b>alphanumeric</b> strings. Traditional <b>ordering</b> processes of the world languages depend on how people order words and names, and can be derived from Dictionaries, Lexicons, Encyclopedias and other official publications.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the concept of QR code ie. Quick Response Code. It is used instead of bar code because it has more data holdingcapacity than bar code with high speed of {{detection}} and accuracy. Quick Response (QR) code has been widely used in the automatic identification fields. In order to adapting the various sizes, a little dirty or damaged, and various lighting condition of bar code image, this proposes a novel implementation of real time Quick Response code recognition which is an efficient technology used for data transferring. QR code is 2 D code which read data horizontally and vertically; stores <b>alphanumeric</b> characters. In <b>order</b> to adapting various sizes, various gray level values, and under various lighting conditions of real bar code image, a high speed, high accuracy. Mobile phones can be secure with generation and detection of QR code...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroud/purposePalatal rugae (PR) are {{situated}} in the anterior part of the hard palate and possess unique and stable characteristics {{that can be used}} in human identification. Their pattern of orientation is established early in life and remains stable thereafter. The purposes of this study were to convert PRP into <b>alphanumeric</b> codes in <b>order</b> to generate scanable Quick Response (QR) codes, to demonstrate uniqueness of PRP using the codes in the study population, and to determine the sexual dimorphism of PRP in the study population. Materials and methodsOrthodontic dental casts of 256 Saudi male and female patients were photographed after ensuring standardization. Individual rugae characteristics, strength and their displacement from incisive papilla and midpalatine raphe were recorded in the form of an alphanumeric code which was subsequently converted to a QR code. Computer assisted check was performed for possible match in the 256 alpha numeric codes while QR codes were scanned using a bar code scanner to determine uniqueness. Sexual dimorphism of palatal rugae (PR) was also analysed. ResultsAll alphanumeric codes of the study population were unique. Mean number of PR in males and females differed significantly (P =  0. 0001). Differences in rugae characteristics and strengths in males and females were also present. ConclusionThe alphanumeric and QR code of the rugae pattern are unique for each individual and can be used for digital record keeping and person identification. A high degree of sexual dimorphism in PR exists in the studied Arab population studied...|$|R
40|$|The {{representation}} of multidimensional data {{is a central}} issue in database design, {{as well as in}} many other elds, including computer graphics, com- putational geometry, pattern recognition, geographic information systems and others. Indeed, multidimensional points can represent locations, as well as more general records that arise in database management systems. For instance, consider an employee record that has attributes corresponding to the employee's name, address, sex, age, height and weight. Although the di erent dimensions have di erent data types (name and address are strings of characters; sex is a binary eld; and age, height and weight are numbers), these records can be treated as points in a six-dimensional space. We may see a database as a collection of records. Each record has several attributes, some of which are keys. The associative retrieval problem consists of answering queries with respect to a le of multidimensional records. Such an associative query requires the retrieval of those records in the le whose key attributes satisfy a certain condition. Examples of associative queries are intersection queries and nearest neighbor queries. In order to facilitate the retrieval of records based on some conditions on its key attributes, it is usually helpful to assumed the existence of an ordering for its values. In the case of numeric keys, such an ordering is quite obvious. In the case of <b>alphanumeric</b> keys, the <b>ordering</b> is usually based on the alphabetic sequence of the characters making up the attribute value. Furthermore, certain queries, like nearest neighbor searches, require the existence of a distance function...|$|R
