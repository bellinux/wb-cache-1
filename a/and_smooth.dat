5|$|GMG Radio {{was taken}} over by rival Global Radio in June 2012. Global's {{purchase}} of the company was referred to Ofcom, the Office of Fair Trading and the Competition Commission amid concerns that Global's market share may be disproportionately large {{as a result of the}} deal, and consequently not in the public interest. GMG Radio subsequently changed its name to Real <b>and</b> <b>Smooth</b> Radio Ltd. A report issued by the Competition Commission in May 2013 highlighted competitiveness issues and recommended a full or partial sale of Real <b>and</b> <b>Smooth.</b> Real <b>and</b> <b>Smooth</b> Radio Ltd and Global continued to operate as separate companies while the takeover was investigated. Smooth moved its operations from Manchester to Global's London headquarters in October 2013. In February 2014, Global were given permission to remove Smooth from the Digital One platform and replace it with another station. Global also sold eight of its regional stations, including three operated under the Smooth brand, and announced that Smooth would replace much of its Gold network on the medium wave frequency. The Smooth brand was relaunched as a network of regional stations in March 2014.|$|E

Kalman filtering <b>and</b> <b>smoothing</b> are discussed <b>and</b> implemented for data processing of airborne gravimetry in this paper. Firstly, the algorithms of Kalman filtering <b>and</b> <b>smoothing</b> are introduced. Then, the system model for solving the gravity anomaly is established {{which is based on}} the dynamic equation and the hardware design equations. Finally, the result of Kalman filtering <b>and</b> <b>smoothing</b> would be compared with digital FIR low pass filter, and it is proved that Kalman filter <b>and</b> <b>smoother</b> could obtain more accurate result than FIR low pass filter as that the solving error of Kalman filter <b>and</b> <b>smoother</b> is improved within 1 mGal compared with the theory standard obtained by GT- 1 A software...|$|R

40|$|This paper gives a new {{approach}} to diffuse filtering <b>and</b> <b>smoothing</b> for multivariate state space models. The standard approach treats the observations as vectors while our approach treats each element of the observational vector individually. This strategy leads to computationally efficient methods for multivariate filtering <b>and</b> <b>smoothing.</b> Also, the treatment of the diffuse initial state vector in multivariate models is much simpler than existing methods. The paper presents details of relevant algorithms for filtering, prediction <b>and</b> <b>smoothing.</b> Proofs are provided. Three examples of multivariate models in statistics and economics are presented for which the {{new approach}} is particularly relevant. ...|$|R

5|$|As is {{the case}} for most Carcharhinus species, {{attempts}} to analyze the finetooth shark's phylogenetic relationships have yielded variable results.

Gavin Naylor's 1992 allozyme analysis found that the finetooth shark is the second-most basal member of the genus next to the blacknose shark (C. acronotus). Mine Dosay-Akbulut's 2008 study, based on ribosomal DNA, suggested that the closest relative of the finetooth shark is the smalltail shark (C. porosus), and that the two species form a clade apart from other Carcharhinus species.|$|E
5|$|As {{the points}} of any smooth simple closed curve move in this way, the curve remains simple <b>and</b> <b>smooth.</b> It loses area at a {{constant}} rate, and its perimeter decreases {{as quickly as possible}} for any continuous curve evolution. If the curve is non-convex, its total absolute curvature decreases monotonically, until it becomes convex. Once convex, the isoperimetric ratio of the curve decreases as the curve converges to a circular shape, before collapsing to a single point of singularity. If two disjoint simple smooth closed curves evolve, they remain disjoint until one of them collapses to a point.|$|E

5|$|Cyathus olla bears a {{resemblance}} to a miniature bird's nest containing eggs, hence the common name bird's nest fungi. The fruiting body, or peridium, is roughly funnel-shaped, 10–18mm tall and 8–12mm wide. It is greyish yellow or greyish brown to fawn-colored {{and covered with}} even, fine-textured hairs on the outside surface. The inner surface is silver grey <b>and</b> <b>smooth,</b> often with faint transverse ridges. Cyathus olla is thick-walled, and flared outwards at the rim; the rim is typically wavy in outline. The 'eggs', or peridioles, typically number 8 to 10 in the cup, and they are white or grey in color, with a diameter of 2–4mm—conspicuously larger than other Cyathus species. They are covered with a thin membrane called a tunica.|$|E
5|$|For {{a simple}} closed curve, using an {{extension}} of the flow to non-smooth curves based on the level set method, there are only two possibilities. Curves with zero Lebesgue measure (including all polygons and piecewise-smooth curves) instantly evolve into smooth curves, after which they evolve as any smooth curve would. However, Osgood curves with nonzero measure instead immediately evolve into a topological annulus with nonzero area <b>and</b> <b>smooth</b> boundaries. The topologist's sine curve is an example that instantly becomes smooth, despite not even being locally connected; examples such as this show that the reverse evolution of the curve-shortening flow can take well-behaved curves to complicated singularities in a finite amount of time.|$|E
