30|$|The study <b>area</b> <b>under</b> <b>grass</b> {{land cover}} {{increased}} from 2.27 % (568  ha) in 1964 to 3.57 % (890  ha) in 1986 {{at a rate}} of 2.58 % per year, followed by a decline to 2.98 % (744  ha) in 2014 {{at a rate of}} 0.59 % per year (Table  3, 4; Fig.  4 a–c). The observed increase in the first period (1964 – 1986) was due to the conversion of 319  ha (8.83 %) of the forest, 220  ha (8.14 %) of the shrub land, 278  ha (1.61) of cultivated and rural settlement land and 7  ha (6.80 %) of the bare land into grass land (Table  5). On the other hand, the decline in the area coverage of grassland during the second period (1986 – 2014) was as a result of about 86.74 % of this LULC category converted into forest, shrub land, and cultivated and rural settlement land, bare land, and urban built up area. Hence, this conversion might be attributable to the rapid growth of population. The decline of grassland in the recent time leads to shortage of animal fodder and then declining of livestock. This is usually reflected in the availability of manure. According to Gete and Hurni (2001) manure is now in greater demand than ever {{not only because of the}} lower number of livestock but also because its use as a source of fuel has increased due to reduction of fuel wood. Unless appropriate land management practices are designed, it will have a huge impact on the fertility of the cultivated land.|$|E
40|$|Temperate grasslands {{have the}} {{potential}} to sequester carbon, helping to mitigate rising atmospheric CO 2 concentrations. The ability of grasslands to absorb CO 2 is influenced by site elevation, soil type, management practices, climate and climatic variability. There is a need for long-term observations and field experiments to quantify the effects of the key drivers of management and climate variability. This paper presents over 4 years of eddy covariance measurements of CO 2 flux over a managed temperate grassland site in south-east Ireland. For the first 2 years the entire study area was under grass. During the second 2 years a winter forage crop was grown over part of the site. The site was found to have a net uptake of CO 2 during all years. However, the magnitude of the CO 2 uptake varied considerably from year to year, with a maximum net uptake of 1. 32 kg CO 2 m− 2 in 2004, a year with no winter forage crop. Net uptakes were much lower in the 2 years of mixed grass and kale cultivation, but detailed analysis of the measurement footprint and statistical comparisons showed that this was not due to the introduction of the forage rotation. For a short period following sowing of the forage crop, daytime CO 2 uptake was less than that of the <b>area</b> <b>under</b> <b>grass,</b> but over subsequent months daytime CO 2 uptake of the kale areas recovered strongly and exceeded that of the grass areas. The net effect over the year following kale planting is close to CO 2 -neutral...|$|E

This study aims to illustrate how stakeholders and policymakers can take advantage of a web-based spatial decision support system (SDSS), namely SmartScape™ to either test existing crop change policies or produce effective crop change decisions using tradeoff analysis. We addressed the consequences of two common crop change scenarios for Dane county in Wisconsin, United States, (a) replacing perennial energy crops with annual energy crops and (b) replacing annual energy crops with perennial energy crops. The results suggested that converting <b>areas</b> <b>under</b> <b>grass</b> and alfalfa production that were located on high quality soil and flat slope to corn promoted a net-income and availability of gross biofuel. Additionally, the model outcome proposed that converting <b>areas</b> <b>under</b> corn and soy production that were located on high slope to grass promoted net-energy, phosphorus loading, soil loss, soil carbon sequestration, nitrous oxide emission, grassland bird habitat, pollinator abundance, and biocontrol. Therefore, SmartScape™ can assist strategic crop change policy by comparing the tradeoff among ecosystem services to ensure that crop change policies have outcomes that are agreeable to a diversity of policymakers...|$|R

The <b>area</b> <b>under</b> turf <b>grass</b> {{is roughly the}} size of the New England states and occupies an area up to three times larger than that of irrigated corn (The Lawn Institute). The majority of this turf area (~ 75 %) is in residential lawns. About 80 % of all U.

Nitrogen fertilization is required to maintain healthy and aesthetically pleasing turf color, high shoot density and the ability to resist and recover from stress and damage.

40|$|We investigated, {{over the}} course of two years, the {{association}} between the abundance of aphids and their natural carabid enemies and landscape, which may help in the development of effective strategies for reducing the incidence of aphid outbreaks in agricultural crops. This was undertaken in 12 wheat and 12 maize fields each year in an agricultural landscape in western France. Our study area was characterized by hedgerows surrounding arable fields and permanent grassland. Some areas have not changed much for several decades, while field enlargement and removal of hedges occurred in some areas following agricultural intensification. This paper aims to determine if the abundance of aphids in crops (either directly, or indirectly via their natural enemies) is associated with the landscape around fields and if so, is it dependent on the landscape scale considered. We observed that the abundance of aphids in fields was associated with landscape composition at a large scale (500 m and 800 m). There was a positive correlation between the abundance of aphids and the proportion of the <b>area</b> <b>under</b> woodland and grassland at these scales. There was a negative correlation between the abundance of carabids and the proportion of grassland and hedgerow around crop fields. The species richness of carabids was positively correlated with the proportion of hedgerows.

40|$|Little {{attention}} has been paid to the possibility that soil water repellency could enhance non-equilibrium water flow and solute transport through macropores present in structured clay soils. In this study, we measured infiltration and solute transport in a clay soil under near-saturated conditions in both the field using tension infiltrometers and in the laboratory on undisturbed soil columns. Measurements were made on adjacent plots <b>under</b> <b>grass</b> and continuous arable cultivation. Steady-state field infiltration rates measured using water and ethanol as the infiltrating fluids demonstrated that the soil macroporosity <b>under</b> <b>grass</b> was better developed, but that much of the structural pore system was inactive due to water repellency. No water repellency was detected on the arable plot disturbed by tillage. Dye tracing showed that the conducting macroporosity was largely comprised of earthworm channels in the grassed plot and inter-aggregate voids resulting from ploughing in the arable plot. Tracer breakthrough curves measured on field-dry soil indicated rapid macropore transport in columns taken from both plots, although the degree of non-equilibrium transport appeared somewhat stronger <b>under</b> <b>grass.</b> This result, which was attributed to water repellency, was also consistent with the larger flow-weighted mean pore size found in the field infiltration experiments.

To explore the relationships between precipitation, soil water and groundwater in Taihang mountainous region, China, precipitation, soil water and water table were observed from 2004 to 2006, and precipitation, soil water and groundwater were sampled in 2004 and 2005 for oxygen- 18 and deuterium analysis at Chongling catchment. The soil water was sampled at three sites covered by grass (Carex humilis and Carex lanceolata), acacia and arborvitae respectively. Precipitation is mainly concentrated in rainy seasons and has no significant spatial variance in study area. The stable isotopic compositions are enriched in precipitation and soil water due to the evaporation.

Nearly 60 % of the island is covered by the three largest mapped units, representing soils on volcanics and volcaniclastics <b>under</b> <b>grass</b> and oaks, and soils on the Monterey formation <b>under</b> <b>grass.</b> Eleven subgroups of the USDA Soil Taxonomy (Soil Survey Staff 1975) occur in the large area of island volcanics <b>under</b> <b>grass</b> (37 % of the island) and soil spatial variability is high, {{with two or three}} subgroups occurring in a single 2. 25 ha grid cell of the map. However, the southwest corner of the island has the most heterogeneous soils (14 subgroups) and the greatest soil spatial variability, with four or more subgroups occurring in a single grid cell. The use of a GIS permits rapid generalization of map units from sampled points, but the rales used for generalization were simplistic, based only on geologic substrate and vegetation, which in turn were mapped at a coarse spatial resolution (150 m). It is difficult to compare the accuracy of the technique to that of a standard soil survey, because no standard soil survey exists for the island. Soils not identified in map unit names are estimated to cover less than 25 % of the area of any map unit.

Symptomless suckers planted in fields previously <b>under</b> <b>grass</b> fallow served as checks. To contrast, healthy suckers and healthy macro-propagated plantlets were established in similar field typologies. Each treatment combination had three replicates of 30 plants. Additional experiments established in September, 2014 in South Kivu Province using symptomless suckers from fields with incidence levels varying from 1 to 90 % assessed the reproducibility of the North Kivu results. In the North Kivu trials and when using symptomless suckers, relatively low cumulative XW plant incidences of 3. 6 and 4. 2 % were recorded in fields previously <b>under</b> <b>grass</b> fallow and fields with > 70 % initial XW-incidence, respectively. The resulting fields were well established, suggesting that suckers sourced from diseased fields could potentially be used in zones with no access to CPM.

Plant incidences of 1. 8 and 2. 9 % were respectively observed in previously diseased fields planted with healthy macro-propagated plantlets and healthy suckers compared with zero incidence levels in the disease-free fields, confirming the role of residual Xcm-soil inoculum in infections.

40|$|AbstractGlobal {{warming is}} forcing {{plant and animal}} species to respond either through pole-ward or upslope {{migration}} to adjust to temperature increases, and grassland communities are not an exception to this phenomenon. In this study, we modeled the response of herbaceous species of grasslands within the Arsi Mountains in Ethiopia under no-migration and with migration scenarios to the projected 4. 2 °C increase of temperature by 2090 (under the A 2 emission scenario). For 67 species of grasses and legumes, we determined the current and predicted altitudinal limits and calculated current and projected area coverage using a Digital Elevation Model. The results indicated that the projected warming significantly reduced altitudinal ranges and habitat areas of all the species studied. All the studied species faced range contraction and habitat loss with range shift gaps among forty two species under the no-migration scenario. With the migration scenario, however, the forty two species with range shift gaps are predicted to benefit from at least some habitat area retention. Between growth forms, legumes are predicted to lose significantly more habitat <b>area</b> than <b>grasses</b> <b>under</b> the no-migration scenario while no significant difference in habitat area loss is predicted under the migration scenario.
