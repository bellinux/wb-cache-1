40|$|Over the years, {{one of the}} {{challenges}} of a rule based expert system is the possibility of evolving a compact and consistent knowledge-base with <b>a</b> <b>fewer</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> rules that are relevant to the application domain, in order to enhance the comprehensibility of the expert system. In this paper, the hybrid of fuzzy rule mining interestingness measures and fuzzy expert system is exploited as a means of solving the problem of unwieldiness and maintenance complication in the rule based expert system. This negatively increases the knowledge-base space complexity and reduces rule access rate which impedes system response time. To validate this concept, the Coronary Heart Disease risk ratio determination is used as the case study. Results of fuzzy expert system with <b>a</b> <b>fewer</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> rules and fuzzy expert system with a large numbers of rules are presented for comparison. Moreover, the effect of fuzzy linguistic variable risk ratio is investigated. This makes the expert system recommendation close to human perception. Web of Science 23545043...|$|E
30|$|In addition, {{it can be}} {{observed}} that, both FNSSA_CRBs and MDA_CRBs are placed in a weaker bargaining position in CRPA_favorable market type (in comparison to the balanced and CRBA_favorable market types). CRPA_favorable market is a market in which CRBA_to_CRPA[*]=[*]{ 10 : 1, 5 : 1, 3 : 1 } (see start points of the curves of all figures). Obviously, {{this is because of}} having <b>a</b> <b>fewer</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> situations to build agreements and thus increasing the likelihood of failure in such a competitive market environment. Therefore, the logical negotiator agents of type CRBA make more concessions to decrease the risk of missing the successful deals with CRPAs in this competitive cloud market (which leads to reduction of the expected utility). As a result, the ascending form of the curves of Fig.  5 is justified.|$|E
40|$|This project {{elucidates}} {{the development}} of a spam filtering method using deep neural networks. A classification model employing algorithms such as Error Back Propagation (EBP) and Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) is used to identify spam and non-spam emails. Moreover, a spam classification system employing deep neural network algorithms is developed, which has been tested on Enron email dataset in order to help users manage large volumes of email and, furthermore, their email folders. The sample size of the data used for this study [...] collected from Enron business users – comprises 158 users and 200, 399 emails at an average of 757 emails per user. It has been observed that most users use folders to classify their emails, with some employing <b>a</b> <b>fewer</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> folders than others. The process of developing a spam classifier employing deep neural networks involves a sequence of several steps. The data was split chronologically and in half, and a flat approach was used instead of a hierarchical approach. Training the support vector machine (SVM) for each user for each field was conducted along with that for each folder for all the emails for that user. A combination of weights is found using regression for each folder and the threshold was performed for optimal score. The project is developed using java code and implemented in two training phases. The deep neural network code is run on Enron spam-ham email data set sample, and the results are shown to compare the actual spam mails against legitimate emails...|$|E

3000|$|In the {{investigated}} growth systems, the P 3 HT chains {{with the}} lower molecular weights (= 7150 and 21, 000  g/mol) depicted backbone laminating states; however, those with M [...] n [...] P 3 HT [...] of 48, 800  g/mol were folded in the c-direction. The folding numbers for the homopolymer single crystals were obtained by dividing the P 3 HT extended length to the width of single crystals (i.e., D(002) dimension detected from width of AFM height profiles). In a similar growth condition, better solvents induced a higher number of foldings. The folding number mostly reduced parallel with T c enhancement. In toluene at T s =  30  °C, by increasing T c from 0 to 10 and 20  °C, the foldings in P 3 HT 48800 single crystals changed from 3 to 2 and finally 1. The maximum P 3 HT backbone lamination of 60 occurred in P 3 HT 7150 single crystals grown from anisole (the weakest utilized solvent in this work) at T s =  60  °C and T c =  20  °C. By increasing M [...] n [...] P 3 HT [...] from 7150 to 21 000  g/mol, <b>a</b> <b>fewer</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> the P 3 HT backbones were laminated. With enhancing the crystallization temperature, the driving force for backbone laminating decreased for homopolymer single crystals. In P 3 HT 7150 single crystals grown from xylene at T s =  40  °C, through altering T c from 10 to 20 and 30  °C, the backbone laminating numbers were equal to 25, 22, and 18, respectively. The weaker solvents caused P 3 HT 7150 and P 3 HT 21000 chains to have more backbone laminations. In P 3 HT 7150 single crystals grown at T s =  30  °C and T c =  10  °C, the laminating numbers in toluene and xylene were 6 and 25, respectively. By increasing the molecular weight of P 3 HT block from 7150 to 21, 000  g/mol in a similar growth condition, the laminating numbers changed to 3 and 10 in toluene and xylene, respectively.|$|E
