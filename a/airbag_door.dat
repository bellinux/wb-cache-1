40|$|This {{research}} presents six simultaneous innovative occupant {{near side}} lateral impact protection concepts including a dynamic <b>door,</b> high-volume side <b>airbag,</b> a large external <b>airbag</b> that covers <b>doors,</b> sill and B-pillar of the struck vehicle and other concepts {{for increasing the}} distance between the occupant and the door panel (active armrest, inflatable door beam and moving seat). All systems are based on pre crash detection of the impact and are activated as soon as 80 ms before the impact. This paper details the task of integrating these systems into a vehicle using FE models, sled tests, and full scale crash tests. Sled test dummy responses were compared with and without the countermeasures. Postprint (published version...|$|R
