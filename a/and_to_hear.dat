5|$|On {{becoming}} king in 1272, Edward I reestablished royal power, overhauling {{the royal}} finances and {{appealing to the}} broader English elite by using Parliament to authorise the raising of new taxes <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> petitions concerning abuses of local governance. This political balance collapsed under Edward II and savage civil wars broke out during the 1320s. Edward III restored order once more {{with the help of}} a majority of the nobility, exercising power through the exchequer, the common bench and the royal household. This government was better organised and on a larger scale than ever before, and by the 14th century the king's formerly peripatetic chancery had to take up permanent residence in Westminster. Edward used Parliament even more than his predecessors to handle general administration, to legislate and to raise the necessary taxes to pay for the wars in France. The royal lands—and incomes from them—had diminished over the years, and increasingly frequent taxation was required to support royal initiatives. Edward held elaborate chivalric events in an effort to unite his supporters around the symbols of knighthood. The ideal of chivalry continued to develop throughout the 14th century, reflected in the growth of knightly orders (including the Order of the Garter), grand tournaments and round table events.|$|E

25|$|This {{meant that}} the Cuban nation was still {{technically}} a member state, but that the current government was denied the right of representation and attendance at meetings and of participation in activities. The OAS's position was that although Cuba's participation was suspended, its obligations under the Charter, the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man, etc. still hold: for instance, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights continued to publish reports on Cuba's human rights situation <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> individual cases involving Cuban nationals. However, this stance was occasionally questioned by other individual member states.|$|E
25|$|Despite all efforts, the Nazis {{were not}} able to keep the massacres secret. Local Polish inhabitants, {{especially}} forestry workers and inhabitants of Palmiry and Pociecha, had many opportunities to observe the death transports <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> the gunshots. Several times they also saw groups of convicts being led to the place of execution. Forester Adam Herbański and his subordinates from the Polish Forest Service helped reveal the truth about the Palmiry massacre. At risk of their lives, they visited the forest glade after the executions (usually at night) in order to secretly mark out the mass graves. Also, a few photos taken by the executioners in Palmiry were stolen by members of the Union of Armed Struggle.|$|E

Appeals from the Island Courts and the Lands Courts Appeal Panel are made to the Magistrates Court, which has jurisdiction to hear civil cases involving up to $T10,000. The superior court is the High Court of Tuvalu as it has unlimited original jurisdiction to determine the Law of Tuvalu <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> appeals from the lower courts. Rulings of the High Court can be appealed to the Court of Appeal of Tuvalu. From the Court of Appeal there is a right of appeal to Her Majesty in Council, i.e., the Privy Council in London.|$|E

The trial judge deferred pronouncing sentence for a week to enable lawyers {{of the two men}} to prepare submissions to him which might be used in an appeal to the supreme Court of Malaysia, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> submissions on behalf of Barlow that he should be allowed to return to Australia immediately for an operation on his leg.

Devereux was again appointed on 2 July 1377 as Justice of the Peace for Herefordshire., and on 20 July, following the death of Edward III and ascension of Richard II, he was also among those assigned as keepers of the city of Hereford. They were instructed to stay upon its sage custody and for conservation of the peace therein, with full power to see that all men of the city and suburbs, according to their condition and means, are suitably armed, arrayed, and kept ready to resist the king’s enemies, compelling them if need be, by distress or imprisonment.|$|E

25|$|With {{millions}} of others I had prayed hard {{at the time of}} Dunkirk and never did prayer seem to be more speedily answered to the full. And we prayed for France and the next day she surrendered. I thought much, and when I went to bed I lay for a long time vividly awake. And I went over in my mind what had happened, concentrating on the thoughts that you had dwelt on, that prayer to be effective must be in accordance with God's will, and that by far the hardest thing to say from the heart and indeed the last lesson we learn (if we ever do) is to say and mean it, ‘Thy will be done.’ And I thought what mites we all are and how we can never see God's plan, a plan on such a scale that it must be incomprehensible. And suddenly for what must have been a couple of minutes I seemed to see with extraordinary and vivid clarity <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> someone speaking to me. The words at the time were clear, but the recollection of them had passed when I seemed to come to, as it were, but the sense remained, and the sense was this. ‘You cannot see the plan’; then ‘Have you not thought there is a purpose in stripping you one by one of all the human props on which you depend, that you are being left alone in the world? You have now one upon whom to lean and I have chosen you as my instrument to work with my will. Why then are you afraid?’ And to prove ourselves worthy of that tremendous task is our job.|$|E

[...] His words received support from a few readers. [...] Others, however, welcomed the open reporting, considering it helpful in raising public awareness of the need for vigilance even in a city with low crime rates.

500|$|A Restoration {{novelty of}} which Wycherley took {{advantage}} was {{the readiness of}} public opinion to accept women on stage, {{for the first time}} in British history. Audiences were fascinated to see real women reverse the cross-dressing of the Elizabethan boy actors and appear in tight-fitting male outfits in the popular breeches roles, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> them match or even outdo the rake heroes in repartee and double entendre. Charles' choice of actresses as mistresses, notably Nell Gwyn, helped keep the interest fresh, and Wycherley plays on this interest in The Country Wife by having Mr. Pinchwife disguise his wife (the eponymous 'country wife') in a boy's outfit. It has also been suggested that he uses the allure of women on display to emphasise in an almost voyeuristic way Margery's provocative innocence, as well as the immodest knowingness of [...] "town" [...] wives like Lady Fidget.|$|E

500|$|Milius {{said the}} actors were chosen because their {{appearances}} and personae fitted their roles. [...] He wanted actors {{who would not}} have any preconceived notions to project into their roles. Although Milius had reservations when he witnessed the first few takes of the novices at work, he put faith in them improving their skills {{on the job and}} altered the script to fit their abilities. Schwarzenegger had studied for weeks in 1980 under Robert Easton, a voice coach for several Hollywood stars, to improve his speech. His first line in the film was a paraphrasing of Mongol emperor Genghis Khan's speech about the good things in life and the actor delivered it with a heavy Austrian accent; critics later described what they heard as [...] "to crush your enemiessee dem [...] driven before you, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> the lamentations of dair vimen [...] ". Subsequently, Schwarzenegger underwent intensive speech training with Milius. [...] Each of his later longer speeches was rehearsed at least 40 times. Lopez's lines were also an issue; although Milius was satisfied with Lopez's work, the surfer's lines were redubbed by stage actor Sab Shimono for the final cut. [...] A source close to the production said this was done because Lopez failed to [...] " [...] a certain quality to his voice." ...|$|E
