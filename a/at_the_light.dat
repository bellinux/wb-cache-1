5|$|Calthrop {{appeared}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Light</b> Railway Inquiry for the Welshpool and Llanfair Light Railway on 3–4 August 1897 {{and spoke}} {{particularly on the}} proposed open level crossings {{and the use of}} transporter wagons. Calthrop claimed it only took 3 minutes to transfer wagons, based on his experience on the Barsi Light Railway. However the Order was not made until 8 September 1899 and in early 1900 the proprietors reached agreement with the Cambrian Railways to build the line. Their engineer, Alfred J. Collins, took charge of the engineering requirements, with consequent conservative 4-wheel wagons and other provisions.|$|E
5|$|During the Battle of Jutland on 31 May-1 June 1916, the 1st LCS was {{assigned}} to screen Vice-Admiral David Beatty's battlecruisers and were the first British ships to spot and engage the ships of the German High Seas Fleet {{on the afternoon of}} 31 May. Cordelia fired four rounds from her main armament <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> cruiser , but they fell short of the target. The ship was not heavily engaged during the battle and only fired a total of a dozen rounds from her 6-inch (152-mm) guns and three from her 4-inch (102-mm) guns. So far as is known, she did not hit anything, nor was she damaged herself. By October 1917, she had been transferred to the 4th Light Cruiser Squadron.|$|E

25|$|Mero's last {{appearance}} on WWF {{television in the}} United States was on the November 30 episode of Raw is War, where he had a shot <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Light</b> Heavyweight Championship against Duane Gill.

He wrestled one final time at the United Kingdom-exclusive pay-per-view Capital Carnage, where he teamed with Jacqueline as a reluctant partner against Sable and Christian in a losing effort. In 1999, both Mero and Sable left the WWF. At the time, Mero had three years remaining on his contract, with a guaranteed salary of $350,000. Mero subsequently did not wrestle for 18 months due to various nagging injuries and a shoulder surgery.|$|E

25|$|The {{first light}} keeper at the Caloundra Head Lightstation was {{appointed}} {{when the light}} became operational in September 1896. One room of his cottage functioned as a postal receiving office, complete with telegraph facilities, with the light keeper appointed as the receiving office keeper. In 1910 the telegraph service was discontinued but {{was replaced by a}} telephone service in 1912. The post office remained at the lighthouse until 1934 and as a result, a rough track along the ridge was created by a steady stream of local residents, helping to foster closer settlement around the lighthouse in the immediate years after its erection. This rough track eventually became Canberra Terrace. As a married man with a large family, the arrival of the first lightkeeper also led to the establishment of the first Caloundra School, which for several months in the late 1890s was conducted <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> keeper's cottage.|$|E
25|$|During construction, {{there was}} also {{controversy}} about the unused land between the new roadway and the old one, since Geneva didn't own all of the property. Geneva wanted the state to give the land the college didn't own for free. However, the state refused, but later sold the land (as well as the former Route 18 alignment, which became a private access road for the university) to Geneva. After construction of the new right-of-way was complete and opened, Geneva shrunk part of the southern end to a one-lane road (in order {{to make room for}} the expansion of Reeves Field) and put a sidewalk in where the northern end used to make the first bend in the s-turn, permanently blocking access to the s-bend. A traffic light was installed at the intersection along the new alignment with Geneva R.P. Church, requiring students to cross the street <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>light.</b>|$|E
25|$|He {{took some}} time to recover from that fight and gained even more weight to contend for the WBC Light Middleweight title, but losing in his first attempt at a {{championship}} in that division on January 30, 1982, against Wilfred Benítez by a 15 round unanimous decision, this after having defeated Nino Gonzalez and Luigi Minchillo, two rated Light Middleweights, both by ten round decisions in non-title bouts. Durán was also to lose his comeback fight in September 1982 in Detroit. Kirkland Laing, from London, shocked the boxing world, producing the type of display his talents promised yet he so rarely produced, taking the split decision. After being relegated to a 10 round walk out win over Englishman Jimmy Batten at The Battle of The Champions in Miami, Durán signed with promoter Bob Arum. This {{marked the beginning of}} a comeback in which he beat former world champion and now hall of famer Pipino Cuevas via a fourth round knock-out, which earned him a second crack <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> middleweight title, this time against WBA Champion Davey Moore.|$|E

25|$|Test: Finally, infants {{are tested}} in the lab using the Headturn-preference procedure, a {{behavioral}} data-collection tool that measures preferences for one kind of auditory stimulus over another. The Headturn-preference procedure maintains that an infant will turn its head towards a stimulus it prefers. This procedure is conducted in a testing booth, with the infant sitting on the lap {{of his or her}} mother. A light is located {{on either side of the}} infant. The trial begins when the infant is looking straight ahead. Mother and experimenter are required to wear tight-fitting earphones which deliver masking music for the duration of the entire procedure. This is done to guarantee that neither mother, nor experimenter bias the infant's response. During each trial, one sidelight flashes, urging the infant to look at it. Once the infant turns his or her head and looks <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>light,</b> the sound stimulus is played. The stimulus continues to play until the sound finishes or the infant looks away. When the infant turns away from the source for at least two seconds, sound and light turn off and the trial ends. A new trial begins when the infant looks at the center panel again.|$|E
25|$|Paifu and José {{decide to}} go to the house of a human rumored to be a murderer. Paifu notices what appears to be an orange spirit out in the sea and {{mistakes}} it for their friend. They arrive <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> source only to find that it was a torch on a raft belonging to the world-renowned sumo wrestler Maruyama, whom they feared. In spite of becoming acquainted, Maruyama teases Paifu and picks up two sticks producing a cross gesture to scare him off believing he, like some vampires in stories, fear a cross. On the contrary, this action forces Paifu to transform into a rampaging were-koala. His rage is halted by José, who shape-shifts into a round object to revert him back to normal. José tells Maruyama that Paifu can not look at a cross figure for more than three seconds before transforming. When asked by Maruyama about Paifu's father, Paifu replies that he was shot to death in a human city when he shape-shifted into a were-koala. After getting to know a little about Maruyama's past, it turns out that he is not as frightening as rumored to be.|$|E
