40|$|The {{presented}} article aims at {{discussing the}} discovery of two types of axes made of bronze, coming from the northern Masovia area (the neigbourhood of Pułtusk). The rst specimen is a bronze axe with edges. The artifact has typical characteristics, a rounded butt, thick low edges, weakly bended sides, and an open arched blade. Despite the relatively untypical morphometric features, the specimen was ascribed to the collection of axes with edges of the Grodnica type. As far as the chronology is concerned, the specimen is dated to phase Br C. The other specimen is a bronze socketed axe. The artifact {{is a classic example}} of a “Lusatian” type axe. A detailed analysis shows that in this case it is the Kotowo type that is concerned. It is characteristic of a collar-like mouth of the socket, a slight narrowing in the half-length and a decoration in the form of vertical ribs placed between <b>arched</b> <b>edges.</b> The character and the area of its occurrence suggest that the axe from Pu³tusk probably arrived from the western area of the Lusatian culture to the border area occupied by the North-Masovian or Masovian-Podlasie groups. In respect of chronology the axe should be placed in the decline phase of the Bronze Age (HaB 2 –HaB 3). Both types of bronze axes are exotic to northern Masovia because their provenance should be connected with the western areas of Poland...|$|R

In Europe, there is more daylight in the summer, and less night, so each of the 12 daylight hours is longer than a night hour.

And {{well may}} they fall back, for beyond those troops of ordered arches there rises a vision {{out of the}} earth, and all the great square seems to have opened from it {{in a kind of}} awe, that we may see it far away;--a {{multitude}} of pillars and white domes, clustered into a long low pyramid of colored light; a treasure-heap, it seems, partly of gold, and partly of opal and mother-of-pearl, hollowed beneath into five great vaulted porches, ceiled with fair mosaic, and beset with sculpture of alabaster, clear as amber and delicate as ivory,--sculpture fantastic and involved, of palm leaves and lilies, and grapes and pomegranates, and birds clinging and fluttering among the branches, all twined together into an endless network of buds and plumes; and, in the midst of it, the solemn forms of angels, sceptred, and robed to the feet, and leaning to each other across the gates, their figures indistinct among the gleaming of the golden ground through the leaves beside them, interrupted and dim, like the morning light as it faded back among the branches of Eden, when first its gates were angel-guarded long ago. And round the walls of the porches there are set pillars of variegated stones, jasper and porphyry, and deep-green serpentine spotted with flakes of snow, and marbles, that half refuse and half yield to the sunshine, Cleopatra-like, [...] "their bluest veins to kiss"--the shadow, as it steals back from them, revealing line after line of azure undulation, as a receding tide leaves the waved sand; their capitals rich with interwoven tracery, rooted knots of herbage, and drifting leaves of acanthus and vine, and mystical signs, all beginning and ending in the Cross; and above them, in the broad archivolts, a continuous chain of language and of life--angels, and the signs of heaven, and the labors of men, each in its appointed season upon the earth; and above these, another range of glittering pinnacles, mixed with white <b>arches</b> <b>edged</b> with scarlet flowers,--a confusion of delight, amidst which the breasts of the Greek horses are seen blazing in their breadth of golden strength, and the St. Mark's Lion, lifted on a blue field covered with stars, until at last, as if in ecstasy, the crests of the arches break into a marble foam, and toss themselves far into the blue sky in flashes and wreaths of sculptured spray, as if the breakers on the Lido shore had been frost-bound before they fell, and the sea-nymphs had inlaid them with coral and amethyst.|$|R

40|$|Objectives: This study aims {{to compare}} the curve of Spee in human {{permanent}} healthy dentitions in two age groups to the disclusion in the premolar and molar region during protrusion. Materials and Methods: Sixty subjects were chosen and equally divided into two age groups of 18 - 25 years and 35 - 44 years. The {{left side of the}} mandibular dental casts was photographed using a digital camera to measure the curve of Spee. The canine cusp, mesiobuccal cusp of the first molar and the distal cusp of the second molar were marked and joined to form an arc. Using AUTOCAD software, the radius for this arc was obtained. A protrusive interocclusal record was made using rigid bite registration material to measure the amount of posterior disclusion during edge to <b>edge</b> protrusion. A <b>dial</b> gauge with an accuracy of 1 / 100 of a millimeter was used to measure the distance between the cusp tip indentations at the region of the buccal cusp of the mandibular 2 nd premolar and distobuccal cusp of mandibular 1 st molar. The results obtained were statistically analyzed. Results: The radius of curve of Spee increased nonsignificantly with age. The mean disclusion values measured in premolar and molar region showed a nonsignificant decrease with age. Conclusion: As age advances, there is a flattening of the curve of Spee and a concurrent reduction in the disclusion values during protrusion...|$|R
50|$|In {{the period}} 1808-1822 almost all watches using the échappement naturel were {{constructed}} on 4-minute tourbillon carriages, with 12+3 escape teeth, reversed fusees and sprung detent locking and {{were made to}} a similar pattern. The watches were large, typically 60-65mm in diameter and a distinguishing feature was their dials. These nearly all had a short hour hand indicating on a small central chapter ring and a large minute hand with a minute ring at the <b>edge</b> of the <b>dial,</b> see watches 1187 and 1188 in Daniels. It {{is possible that the}} low price for the watch for the Bishop of Cambrai was because of their personal friendship. Judging by the rather modest mark-up of ~25% that Breguet applied to his workshop costs for other watches with this escapement, he might even have made a loss in this case. Breguet sold the Bishop another tourbillon watch, number 2436, for the same price but this one had a constant force escapement.During the period in which these watches were being sold (1808-1821), a few dozen tourbillon watches were being produced, about half with a lever escapement on a 1-minute carriage and the rest with a variety of escapements, a detent escapement on a 6-minute or 4-minute carriage, a couple with a constant force escapement and at least one with a Robin escapement. The sale of watches with tourbillon movements ceased after Breguet’s death in 1823.|$|R

40|$|Using {{molecular}} dynamics techniques, we simulate the vortex {{behavior in a}} type II superconducting strip {{in the presence of}} triangular and two types of conformal pinning arrays, one with a pinning gradient perpendicular to the driving force (C 1) and the other parallel (C 2), at zero temperature. A transport force is applied in the infinite direction of the strip, and the magnetic field is increased until the rate between the density of vortices (nv) and pinning (np) reaches nv/np =[*] 1. 5. Our results show a monotonic increase, by steps, of the vortex density with the applied magnetic field. Besides, each pinning lattice presents a different vortex penetration delay. For the triangular pinning array, different than the case of infinite films, here the system exhibits only one pronounced depinning force peak at nv/np =[*] 1. However, the depinning force peak is present for only one value of field, in the range of fields where nv/np =[*] 1 is stable. For the case of conformal pinning arrays, in analogy to what is observed in infinite films, no commensurability depinning force peaks were found. In the present case, the C 1 array is more efficient at low fields, all arrays are equivalent in the intermediate fields, and the C 2 array is more efficient for high fields. We also show that for the C 1 array at high fields, vortices depin following the conformal <b>arches,</b> from the <b>edge</b> to the center. For the C 2 array, the depinning force is higher when compared to that of C 1, because this particular conformal structure prevents the formation of easy vortex flow channels...|$|R
