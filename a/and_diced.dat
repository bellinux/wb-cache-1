5|$|Waraq Dawali (stuffed grape leaves), is a mahshi meal {{reserved}} for large gatherings. The grape leaves are normally wrapped around minced meat, white rice <b>and</b> <b>diced</b> tomatoes, however meat {{is not always}} used. Dawali is an excellent representation of the attention to detail commonly found in Palestinian and Levant cuisine, with each piece being tightly wrapped {{to the size of}} cigarette morsels (some families differ in their structure).It is then cooked and served as dozens of rolls on a large plate usually accompanied by boiled potato slices, carrots and lamb pieces. Kousa mahshi are zucchinis stuffed with the same ingredients as waraq al-'ainib and usually served alongside it heavy meals. If made with a large number of zucchinis as well as dawali it is known as waraq al-'ainib wa kousa.|$|E

25|$|In the Philippines, {{spaghetti}} {{is often}} {{served with a}} distinct, slightly sweet yet flavourful meat sauce (the base {{of which would be}} tomato sauce or paste and ketchup), frequently containing ground beef or pork <b>and</b> <b>diced</b> hot dogs and ham.

Other pasta dishes are also cooked nowadays in the Filipino kitchen, like carbonara, pasta with alfredo sauce, and baked macaroni. These dishes are usually cooked for gatherings and special occasions, like family reunions or Christmas. Macaroni or other tube pasta is also used in sopas, a local chicken broth soup.|$|E

25|$|Taro {{is called}} gabi in the Philippines and is widely {{available}} throughout the archipelago. Its adaptability to marshland and swamps make {{it one of}} the most common vegetables in the Philippines. The leaves, stems, and corms are all consumed and form part of the local cuisine. A popular recipe for taro is laing; the dish's main ingredients are taro leaves (at times including stems) cooked in coconut milk, and salted with fermented shrimp or fish bagoong. It is sometimes heavily spiced with red hot chilies called siling labuyo. Another dish in which taro is commonly used is the Philippine national stew, sinigang, although radish can be used if taro is not available. This stew is made with pork and beef, shrimp, or fish, a souring agent (tamarind fruit, kamias, etc.) with the addition of peeled <b>and</b> <b>diced</b> corms as thickener. The corm is also prepared as a basic ingredient for ginataan, a coconut milk and taro dessert.|$|E
500|$|The third track, [...] "Planet Party", called [...] "Apple IIe funk" [...] by Joe Colly of Pitchfork Media, {{contains}} [...] "wailing guitar synths", [...] "fist-pumping bass", [...] "scattergun freestyle drums" [...] and [...] "sudden, surprisingly violent orchestral stabs". Produced in {{the summer}} of 2010 and the first song to be chosen for inclusion on That We Can Play, Ford recalled, [...] "We were making this smooth-rock, Alan Parsons Project-style shit, and then it completely got sliced <b>and</b> <b>diced,</b> mistakes happened in Pro Tools, and it became something else." [...] "Shadows in Bloom", a reprise of [...] Secret Service's [...] "Flash in the Night", is a melancholy, mid-tempo power ballad featuring bass, snare and synth harmonies described by a reviewer as violent, cavernous, and harsh.|$|E
500|$|Spence D. from IGN Music {{commented that}} the song is the coolest song on the album up to this point. Paul Rees from Q {{magazine}} complemented the track as a [...] "conventional rock song, filled with drama, darkness and surprises". USA Todays Edna Gunderson said that the [...] "funkified" [...] synth-pop of [...] "Nobody Knows Me" [...] attests to Madonna's [...] "undiminished" [...] skills as a shrewd pop composer. Yahoo! Music's Dan Genoe commented that Madonna has a personality crisis in the song. Jessica Winter from The Village Voice gave the song a mixed review, writing: [...] "It mutes slightly the slaphappy beats of Mirwais's own club hit [...] "Disco Science" [...] to make vague digs at the press and defensively vow self-improvement. Madonna's voice is mixed <b>and</b> <b>diced</b> into baby gurgles, {{which might have been}} cute if it weren't so redundant." [...] John Payne from LA Weekly deduced that even within the synth sounds of the song, he could see [...] "real feeling deeply ingrained in this particular icon. 'Why should I care what the world thinks of me?' That is, yes, she does care what the world thinks of her. She says she’ll just withdraw from the public eye, ’cause who needs this, huh?" [...] Conversely, Rikky Rooksby, author of The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, gave a negative review saying that [...] "Nobody Knows Me" [...] might be the silliest track that Madonna had ever recorded.|$|E

2500|$|In the Southern United States, eating {{black-eyed peas}} or Hoppin' John (a {{traditional}} soul food) on New Year's Day {{is thought to}} bring prosperity in the new year. The peas are typically cooked with a pork product for flavoring (such as bacon, fatback, ham bones, or hog jowls) <b>and</b> <b>diced</b> onion, and served with a hot chili sauce or a pepper-flavored vinegar. The traditional meal also includes collard, turnip, or mustard greens, and ham. The peas, since they swell when cooked, symbolize prosperity; the greens symbolize money; the pork, because pigs root forward when foraging, represents positive motion. Cornbread, which represents gold, also often accompanies this meal.|$|E
60|$|Well, one day I {{was seated}} in my {{quarters}} playing cards with young Morat, of the horse chasseurs, {{when the door opened}} and in walked Lasalle, who was our Colonel. You know what a fine, swaggering fellow he was, and the sky-blue uniform of the Tenth suited him to a marvel. My faith, we youngsters were so taken by him that we all swore <b>and</b> <b>diced</b> and drank and played the deuce whether we liked it or no, just that we might resemble our Colonel! We forgot that it was not because he drank or gambled that the Emperor was going to make him the head of the light cavalry, but because he had the surest eye for the nature of a position or for the strength of a column, and the best judgment as to when infantry could be broken, or whether guns were exposed, of any man in the army. We were too young to understand all that, however, so we waxed our moustaches and clicked our spurs and let the ferrules of our scabbards wear out by trailing them along the pavement in the hope that we should all become Lasalles. When he came clanking into my quarters, both Morat and I sprang to our feet.|$|E

40|$|PAZ PIWI domain (PPD) proteins, {{together}} with the RNA cleavage products of Dicer, form ribonucleoprotein complexes called RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISCs). RISCs mediate gene silencing through targeted messenger RNA cleavage and translational suppression. The PAZ domains of PPD <b>and</b> <b>Dicer</b> proteins were originally thought to mediate binding between PPD proteins <b>and</b> <b>Dicer,</b> although no evidence exists to support this theory. Here we show that PAZ domains are not required for PPD protein–Dicer interactions. Rather, a subregion of the PIWI domain in PPD proteins, the PIWI-box, binds directly to the Dicer RNase III domain. Stable binding between PPD proteins <b>and</b> <b>Dicer</b> was dependent on the activity of Hsp 90. Unexpectedly, binding of PPD proteins to Dicer inhibits the RNase activity of this enzyme in vitro. Lastly, we show that PPD proteins <b>and</b> <b>Dicer</b> are present in soluble and membrane-associated fractions, indicating that interactions between {{these two types of}} proteins may occur in multiple compartments...|$|R
