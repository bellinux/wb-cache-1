30|$|The {{structure}} of science teacher education programmes in different institutions appears quite similar {{in terms of}} teaching professional courses. According to the regulations of the TCT, the typical teaching professional courses are Foundations of Education, Curriculum, Educational Psychology, Measurement and Education, Education System and Assurance, Classroom Management, Educational Research, ICT in Education and Student Teaching Internship. However, their characteristics {{differ from those of}} content-specific pedagogy courses. Most programmes include a scientific methods course, but only some have PCK-based courses, such as Science Process Skills, Science Projects, The Nature of Science, Science Curriculum Development and Assessment in Science Education. Rather than offering general pedagogy in teaching profession courses, some institutions focus on PCK. There is criticism of science CK in five-year science pre-service teacher education. Considerable research has revealed that pre-service teachers have insufficient science CK (e.g., Buaraphan et al. 2005). In order to cope with this problem, there has been an effort in recent science teacher education programmes to balance the credits between science content and pedagogy courses. Consequently, there is almost a 50 : 50 ratio today. The emphasis on CK is intended for students to have a stronger content background than in the past. Similar to almost all undergraduate science students, pre-service science teachers are required to take all science courses taught by scientists and typically in the faculty of science. For example, pre-service chemistry teachers must take courses covering all areas of chemistry, such as organic chemistry, inorganic <b>chemistry,</b> <b>analytical</b> <b>chemistry,</b> <b>physical</b> <b>chemistry,</b> and biochemistry.|$|R

For the goal of the deep learning of the subject, it is indispensable to present perception and models of chemical behavior explicitly.

Students, well versed in issues which integrate to enhance vital concepts, are thus able to understand nature and help us to discover means to view the impact of industrialization on the well being of mankind. Understanding environmental chemistry needs quality teaching at undergraduate stage of students learning.

AbstractGuanidyl {{moieties}} of both arginine (Arg) and Nα-benzoyl-l-argininate {{ethyl ester}} chloride (BAEE) are protonated in all environments studied, i. e., dry solid state, D 2 O solutions, and dry and hydrated lipids {{as suggested by}} DFT(B 3 LYP) / 6 - 31 +G(d,p) calculations. Arg and BAEE are able to insert in the lipid interphase of both DMPC and DOPC monolayers as revealed by the observed decrease in the membrane dipole potential they induce. The larger decrease in the dipole potential induced by BAEE, compared to Arg, can be explained partially by the higher affinity of the hydrophobic benzoyl and ethyl groups for the membrane phase, which allows an easier insertion of this molecule. FTIR studies indicate that the guanidyl moiety of Arg is with all probability facing the hydrophobic part of the lipids, whereas in BAEE this group is facing the water phase. Zeta potential measurements provide a direct evidence that Arg orients in the lipid interphase of phosphatidylcholine (PC) bilayers with the negative charged carboxylate group (−COO−) toward the aqueous phase...|$|R
40|$|Advances in data {{acquisition}} and storage technologies have motivated {{the development of}} multivariate statistical techniques to handle and interpret large data sets. Such statistical methods may be readily applied to the spectral data routinely generated in <b>analytical</b> and <b>physical</b> <b>chemistry</b> to reveal underlying chemical information and to facilitate data compression and storage. This work focuses on the application of chemometrics to Raman hydration shell spectroscopy, multivariate hyperspectral imaging, and two-dimensional microwave spectroscopy. The former hydration shell spectroscopy is analyzed with multivariate curve resolution to decompose mixture spectra into pure component contributions. Subtle features not evident in the unprocessed spectra are revealed, including spectral features indicative of pi-hydrogen bonding in dilute aqueous benzene solutions and solvent-separated hydrophobic aggregation in tert-butyl alcohol mixtures. Chemometrics are also applied to hyperspectral imaging to develop a strategy which utilizes hardware-integrated data compression (using a digital micromirror device) to reduce the time necessary to classify and quantify components by orders of magnitude. Procedures including spectral aliasing and compressive sensing are applied to two-dimensional microwave spectroscopy to reduce and interpret the large data sets generated with the broadband method realized herein. The results of this work demonstrate the power and applicability of multivariate statistics to various disciplines of chemistry. ...|$|R

In NMR, individual nuclei in a molecule can be recognized by their chemical shifts, through-bond J couplings and through-space distances. Molecular structures and NMR properties of the molecules in interest can also be studied by theoretical quantum chemical computations. ^ Ab initio and DFT calculations have been performed on a variety of amino acid and peptide hydrohalides. When generating the environment for the halide ion coordination, a simplified model is employed, using ammonium ions to replace –NH 3 + and water to replace –OH groups. From the calculations of electric field gradient on halide ion site, the QCC and η are obtained and compared with the available experimental results of halogen NMR. ^ Based on an approach analogous to COSY-based experiments in liquid-state NMR with coherences transferred via the weak scalar-coupling Hamiltonian, solid state double-quantum filtered correlation spectroscopy (DQF-COSY) was performed to study the 13 C-enrichd thymidine. The results have shown the DQF-COSY method can also be applied to solid state with success. ^ The effect of pseudorotation on carbon chemical shifts in tetrahydrofuran (THF) and 2, 5 -dimethyltetrahydrofuran (DMTHF) has been studied by theoretical quantum chemical calculations. Stable conformers along the pseudorotation pathway for THF and DMTHF were located using ab initio and DFT method under different basis sets.

40|$|An {{investigation}} of orientation effects in films of nitric acid dihydrate (NAD) is presented, {{based on a}} systematic study of transmission and reflection-absorption infrared (RAIR) spectra of samples of varying thickness. The samples are prepared by vapor deposition on Ge (for transmission spectroscopy) and on Al substrates (for RAIR spectroscopy) at 175 K to produce crystalline α-NAD films. Transmission spectra were recorded at normal incidence, and RAIR spectra were recorded at a grazing angle of 75 °, with polarized radiation. The observed spectra are compared with predictions of a classical Fresnel model, to test the available optical indices of NAD, which are of great importance for the accurate interpretation of data from remote sensing measurements. Whereas the procedure yields satisfactory results for transmission and s-polarized RAIR spectra, {{it is found that}} the agreement is not acceptable for p-polarized RAIR spectra. An explanation is suggested in terms of a preferential alignment of the films, with the (10 - 1) crystallographic plane of the crystal situated parallel to the substrate.

40|$|Molecular {{recognition}} phenomena play {{important roles}} {{in a variety of}} physical, chemical, and biological events, and are a field of convergence of knowledge from organic, inorganic, <b>analytical</b> and <b>physical</b> <b>chemistry.</b> Therefore, in recent years there have been considerable efforts on the design, synthesis and application of novel fluorescent molecular probes that selectively and specifically respond to the presence of specific analytes (ions and neutral molecules), as fluorescence allows the highest sensitivity (up to detection of single molecules) in sensory applications [1]. Metal ions are key parts in all aspects of human life, and recently amino acids have attracted great interest for constructing bio-analogous metal-organic frameworks materials since amino acid residues are the origin for the highly selective substrate- binding ability of proteins [2]. Metal coordination to amino acids and peptides could give rise to metal-organic frameworks in which amino acid residues may offer flexible hydrogen bonding to induce molecular recognition. The design of peptides that coordinate metals, by incorporation of modified amino acids, has potential applications in the study of protein-protein interactions mediated by metals, protein binding to nanoparticles and metal surfaces, and the development of selective chemosensors for metals for use in vitro and in vivo [3]. Bearing these facts in mind and following our research interests that include the synthesis and application of fluorimetric probes for metallic ions based on heterocycles and amino acids [4], we now report the synthesis and evaluation of unnatural alanine derivatives as fluorimetric chemosensors for the recognition of metallic ions through the introduction of five-membered nitrogen and oxygen heterocycles as coordinating/reporting units in a benzoxazolyl-alanine core in order to obtain new chemosensorsFundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT) Universidade do Minho (UM...|$|R

We derive a new method for determining radial diffusion effects and the penetration or {{transmission of gas}} molecules and aerosol particles through cylindrical tubes under laminar flow conditions using explicit analytical equations. In contrast to the traditional Brown method [Brown, R. L. J. Res. Natl. Bur. Stand. (U. S.) 1978, 83, 1 - 8] and CKD method (Cooney, D. O.; Kim, S. S.; Davis, E. J. Chem. Eng. Sci. 1974, 29, 1731 - 1738), the new approximation developed in this study (known as the KPS method) does not require interpolation or numerical techniques. The KPS method agrees well with the CKD method under all experimental conditions and also with the Brown method at low Sherwood numbers. At high Sherwood numbers corresponding to high uptake on the wall, flow entry effects become relevant and are considered in the KPS and CKD methods {{but not in the}} Brown method. The practical applicability of the KPS method is demonstrated by analysis of measurement data from experimental studies of rapid OH, intermediate NO 3, and slow O 3 uptake on various organic substrates. The KPS method also allows determination of the penetration of aerosol particles through a tube, using a single equation to cover both the limiting cases of high and low deposition described by Gormley and Kennedy (Proc. R. Ir. Acad., Sect. A. 1949, 52 A, 163 - 169).
