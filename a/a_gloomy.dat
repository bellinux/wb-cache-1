5|$|Although {{contemporary}} historians vilified Domitian {{after his}} death, his administration provided {{the foundation for}} the peaceful empire of the 2nd century CE, and the culmination of the 'Pax Romana'. His successors Nerva and Trajan were less restrictive, but in reality their policies differed little from Domitian's. Much more than <b>a</b> <b>gloomy</b> coda to the 1st century, the Roman Empire prospered between 81 and 96, in a reign which Theodor Mommsen described as the sombre but intelligent despotism of Domitian.|$|E

This story of tolerance, coming soon after the Dreyfus affair, was financially successful, with Bernhardt often giving both a matinee and evening performance.|$|E

25|$|The Foundation Pit (Russian: Котлован, kotlovan) is <b>a</b> <b>gloomy</b> {{symbolic}} and semi-satirical novel by Andrei Platonov. The {{plot of the}} novel concerns a group of workers living in the early Soviet Union. They attempt to dig out a huge foundation pit {{on the base of}} which a gigantic house will be built for the country's proletarians. The workers dig each day but slowly cease to understand the meaning of their work. The enormous foundation pit sucks out all of their physical and mental energy.|$|E
25|$|It was {{believed}} that when people died, they would be confined to <b>a</b> <b>gloomy</b> world of Ereshkigal, whose realm was guarded by gateways with various monsters designed to prevent people entering or leaving. The dead were buried outside the city walls in graveyards where a small mound covered the corpse, along with offerings to monsters and {{a small amount of}} food. Those who could afford it sought burial at Dilmun. Human sacrifice was found in the death pits at the Ur royal cemetery where Queen Puabi was accompanied in death by her servants.|$|E
25|$|In Rouen cathedral, {{east of the}} {{transept}} aisles, {{there are}} apsidal chapels, which with the three chapels in the chevet make up the usual number. The Cathedral of St. Peter in Poitiers {{has been referred to}} {{as an example of a}} square east end, but a compromise has been made by the provision of three segmental apses, and there are no windows in the east front; the most remarkable divergence from the usual design is found here in the absence of any triforium or clerestory, because the vault of the aisles is nearly as high as that of the nave, so that it constitutes an example of what in Germany (where there are many) are called Hallenkirchen; the light being obtained through the aisle windows only gives <b>a</b> <b>gloomy</b> effect to the nave.|$|E

25|$|In <b>a</b> <b>gloomy</b> bar, Raoul contemplates his {{relationship}} with Christine. He is joined by Meg, who tells him she swims each day to wash away the stress of working. She tells Raoul that he must leave with Christine and Gustave and {{runs out of the}} bar ("Why Does She Love Me?"). Raoul says he is not afraid of the Phantom. Suddenly, the Phantom reveals himself to Raoul and they make a bet that if Christine sings, the Phantom wins and if she doesn't, Raoul wins. If Raoul wins the bet, the Phantom will pay his debts and Raoul can leave with Christine and Gustave. However, if The Phantom wins, Christine and Gustave will remain in America with him and Raoul must return to Paris alone. The Phantom also leads Raoul to question Gustave's paternity ("Devil Take the Hindmost"). Fleck, Squelch and Gangle appear to advertise Christine's appearance at Phantasma ("Invitation to the Concert"). That night, Meg performs a strip-tease about her choice of swimming costumes ("Bathing Beauty"). She successfully impresses the audience, but Madame Giry reveals to Meg that the Phantom did not watch the performance, saying it was for nothing ("Mother, Did You Watch?").|$|E
25|$|Worcestershire {{chose to}} bowl first on <b>a</b> <b>gloomy</b> first day which saw 62 overs {{lost to the}} weather. Warwickshire lost three wickets on the opening day, openers Andy Moles and Roger Twose both scored 39 with Brian Lara making five. On the second day Warwickshire lost their last seven wickets for 87 in 44 overs, Stuart Lampitt was the pick of the bowlers taking three wickets to finish with figures of 4/32. Worcestershire openers Philip Weston and Tim Curtis had both scored unbeaten half-centuries before the close. The pair had shared 208 for the opening {{partnership}} when Weston fell six short of a first century of the season, Curtis went on to score 180 in over eight hours of batting. In the post-tea session David Leatherdale (71*) and Lampitt (56*) capitalised on poor bowling to boost the total by 133 in 25 overs. A declaration left Warwickshire with a deficit of 257 and 116 overs to play, in a 14 over spell on the third evening they lost two wickets. Nightwatchman Graeme Welch (66) and Moles (67) put on 135 for the third wicket and with further half-centuries from Trevor Penney and Lara (57) Warwickshire comfortably survived the final day to draw the match.|$|E
25|$|The third test of {{the series}} was played at Headingley, {{traditionally}} known to be conducive for seam bowling. Ganguly won the toss and took a bold decision to bat first on <b>a</b> <b>gloomy</b> overcast morning. Naseer Hussain had studded his bowling line-up with four seamers including Hoggard, Flintoff, Tudor and Caddick. To make the matters worse, India lost Sehwag in the seventh over of the match. However, Dravid came in and joined forces with Bangar. Together the two batsmen weathered the storm. They applied themselves, took body blows but never gave the English bowlers any chance. Dravid and Bangar starred in a match defining partnership of 170 runs. By the time Bangar got out after a commendable fifty, the sun was out and batting had become easier. Tendulkar joined Dravid as Dravid went on to complete his 12th Test hundred. Dravid and Tendulkar put on 150 runs together before a battered and bruised Dravid finally got out stumped to Giles for 148 runs, but not before playing out the difficult morning session of the second day. As the conditions got easier to bat, Ganguly and Tendulkar piled on England's misery bringing up their individual hundreds in the process. India declared the innings on 628/8 and then bowled England out twice to win the match by an innings and 46 runs – India's first overseas victory by an innings margin since 1977/78. Such was the impact of Dravid's seven-hour-long fighting knock that, despite Sachin outscoring him by 45 runs (he scored 193 runs), Dravid was adjudged {{the man of the}} match for his 148 runs. Dravid backed up his two consecutive hundreds in the series with another one at The Oval, this time scoring a double hundred. After England scored 515 runs in the first innings of the fourth Test, Dravid scored 217 runs to take India to 505. The test and the series ended in a draw. Dravid was adjudged man of the match for second consecutive match. Dravid amassed 602 runs in the series at an average of 100.33, including three hundreds and a fifty and was adjudged joint man of the series along with Vaughan.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} generally mixed {{to negative}} reviews. Entertainment Weekly writer Tanner Stransky was {{highly critical of}} the episode, describing the Gabrielle story as predictable, the Susan subplot as boring and the overall Bolen story arc as too slow in developing. Stransky also felt the Katherine and Robin pairing was unbelievable, and questioned whether the show's audiences of families and midwesterners would respond well to a lesbian pairing. Gael Fashingbauer Cooper of MSNBC praised Longoria for turning what he said could have been <b>a</b> <b>gloomy</b> story into [...] "a gleeful fantasy". Cooper said the character was fun and funny but ultimately heartfelt and caring. Conversely, Cooper said the subplots involving the other housewives were [...] "all pretty standard, and dreary, stuff".|$|E
