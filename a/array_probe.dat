50|$|Phased array ultrasonics (PA) is an {{advanced}} method of ultrasonic testing that has applications in medical imaging and industrial nondestructive testing. Common applications are to noninvasively examine the heart or to find flaws in manufactured materials such as welds. Single-element (non-phased array) probes, known technically as monolithic probes, emit a beam in a fixed direction. To test or interrogate a large volume of material, a conventional probe must be physically scanned (moved or turned) to sweep the beam through the area of interest. In contrast, the beam from a phased <b>array</b> <b>probe</b> can be focused and swept electronically without moving the probe. The beam is controllable because a phased <b>array</b> <b>probe</b> {{is made up of}} multiple small elements, each of which can be pulsed individually at a computer-calculated timing. The term phased refers to the timing, and the term array refers to the multiple elements. Phased array ultrasonic testing is based on principles of wave physics, which also have applications in fields such as optics and electromagnetic antennae.|$|E

Using matrix <b>array</b> <b>probes</b> for {{non-destructive}} materials testing {{offers the}} ability of electronic steering of the sound field through a test block almost without limitation.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a Salmonella genoserotyping array (SGSA) which rapidly generates an antigenic formula consistent with the White-Kauffmann-Le Minor scheme, currently {{the gold standard for}} Salmonella serotyping. A set of 287 strains representative of 133 Salmonella serovars was assembled to validate the array and to test the <b>array</b> <b>probes</b> for accuracy, specificity, and reproducibility. Initially, 76 known serovars were utilized to validate the specificity and repeatability of the <b>array</b> <b>probes</b> and their expected probe patterns.

40|$|This study {{reports the}} {{microfabrication}} {{of a novel}} interconnect technology for out-of-plane biomedical <b>probe</b> <b>arrays.</b> This type of interconnect technology {{can be used to}} interconnect <b>probe</b> <b>arrays</b> perpendicular onto a backbone resulting in slim-base three-dimensional <b>probe</b> <b>arrays.</b> The microfabrication of such interconnect has been realized using bio-tolerable materials and CMOS compatible prost-processing techniques. This type of interconnect can also be used in many other non-biomedical fields which require a modular, out-of-plane integration concept. CMOS structures can be connected perpendicular with each other, without the need to significantly increase the re-distributed fan-in / fan-out area. Currently, silicon microfabricated <b>probe</b> <b>arrays</b> are often used to record and stimulate neurons at the cellular level. They can contain embedded electronics such as filters, amplifiers and multiplexers, which are integrated into the base of the <b>probe</b> <b>array.</b> Integrated electronics consume a significant amount of surface area and increases the height of the <b>probe</b> <b>array.</b> Implantation of such <b>probe</b> <b>array</b> into the cortical tissue requires extra space above the implanted area, which is most often not available. Consequently, the <b>probe</b> <b>array</b> could be caught between the skull and the cortical tissue, resulting in tissue damage or probe failure. Besides, the brain is constantly moving due to physical movement or macro movements caused by blood pulsation. The ideal <b>probe</b> <b>array</b> for long term and chronic recordings moves along with the cortical movements rather than remain attached or clamped against the skull. To fulfill the floating requirement the base of the <b>probe</b> <b>array</b> should be reduced in height and become as thin as possible. This study describes a technique to connect the shafts perpendicularly to the tall base of the <b>probe</b> <b>array.</b> This approach realizes a slim-base three-dimensional <b>probe</b> <b>array</b> while retaining the ability to integrate complex functions such as filtering, amplification, and multiplexing of the recorded neural signals. Realizing such slim-base out-of-plane biomedical <b>probe</b> <b>array</b> requires a new type of modular high density interconnect, which electrically interconnects the shaft with the tall base. An assembly technique has been developed to align and assemble the <b>probe</b> <b>arrays</b> perpendicular into the base of the <b>probe</b> <b>array.</b> Once the shafts are assembled perpendicularly into the tall base (better known as platform), a non-separable, mechanical stable electrical connection is established. The platform or tall base contains several cavities, which act as socket for the perpendicularly assembled shafts and provide mechanical stability. The electrical interconnects consist of gold clips overhanging the edge of a cavity. During the perpendicularly assembly of the <b>probe</b> <b>array</b> the metal clips will be bent and squeezed between the insulated wall of the cavity and the contact pad located on the <b>probe</b> <b>array.</b> Two microfabrication techniques have been developed to realize the interconnect for slim-base three-dimensional <b>probe</b> <b>arrays.</b> Bothmethods have their own specific technique to deposit the electrical interconnects {{over the edge of the}} cavity. The first technique uses a sacrificial filling method, while the second technique uses a thin film transfer bonding method. Several test structures have been developed to measure the contact resistance as well as the perpendicular fit. An interconnect density with a pitch of 35 &# 956;m and spacing of 15 &# 956;m has been achieved with contact resistances of about 3 Ohm. The slim-base three-dimensional <b>probe</b> <b>array</b> has been implanted in a Long-Evans rat under ketamine/xylazine anesthesia. Successful recordings were measured showing local field potentials and multiunit activity. A post-process tip sharpening technique has been developed to sharpen the chisel shape tip of the probe (prior to assembly), enabling to implant the three-dimensional <b>probe</b> <b>array</b> in bigger size primates without the need to open the dura and thus minimizing the change on in subdural infections. status: publishe...|$|R
