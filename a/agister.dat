500|$|All ponies grazing on the New Forest {{are owned}} by New Forest commoners– people who have [...] "rights of common of pasture" [...] over the Forest lands. An annual marking fee is paid for each animal turned out to graze. The {{population}} of ponies on the Forest has fluctuated in response to varying demand for young stock. Numbers fell to fewer than six hundred in 1945, but have since risen steadily, and thousands now run loose in semi-feral conditions. The welfare of ponies grazing on the Forest is monitored by five Agisters, employees of the Verderers of the New Forest. Each <b>Agister</b> takes responsibility for a different area of the Forest. The ponies are gathered annually {{in a series of}} drifts, to be checked for health, wormed, and they are tail-marked; each pony's tail is trimmed to the pattern of the <b>Agister</b> responsible for that pony. Purebred New Forest stallions approved by the Breed Society and by the New Forest Verderers run out on the Forest with the mares for a short period each year. Many of the foals bred on the Forest are sold through the Beaulieu Road pony sales, which are held several times each year.|$|E
500|$|Drifts {{to gather}} the animals are carried out in autumn. Most colts and some fillies are removed, along with any animals {{considered}} too [...] "poor" [...] {{to remain on the}} Forest over the winter. The remaining fillies are branded with their owner's mark, and many animals are wormed. Many owners choose to remove a number of animals from the Forest for the winter, turning them out again the following spring. Animals surplus to their owner's requirements often are sold at the Beaulieu Road Pony Sales, run by the New Forest Livestock Society. Tail hair of the ponies is trimmed, and cut into a recognisable pattern to show that the pony's grazing fees have been paid for the year. Each <b>Agister</b> has his own [...] "tail-mark", indicating the area of the Forest where the owner lives. The Agisters keep a constant watch over the condition of the Forest-running stock, and an animal may be [...] "ordered off" [...] the Forest at any time. The rest of the year, the lives of the ponies are relatively unhindered unless they need veterinary attention or additional feeding, when they are usually taken off the Forest.|$|E

Additionally, <b>agisters</b> collected monies charged for grazing, verderers attended the forest courts, and inspectors termed [...] "regarders", huntsmen and kennelmen were also employed.|$|R

5000|$|Commons {{rights are}} {{attached}} to particular plots of land (or {{in the case of}} turbary, to particular hearths), and different land has different rights - and some of this land is some distance from the Forest itself. Rights to graze ponies and cattle are not for a fixed number of animals, {{as is often the case}} on other commons. Instead a [...] "marking fee" [...] is paid for each animal each year by the owner. The marked animal's tail is trimmed by the local <b>agister</b> (Verderers' official), with each of the four or five forest agisters using a different trimming pattern. Ponies are branded with the owner's brand mark; cattle may be branded, or nowadays may have the brand mark on an ear tag. Grazing of Commoners' ponies and cattle is an essential part of the management of the forest, helping to maintain the heathland, bog, grassland and wood-pasture habitats and their associated wildlife.|$|E
5|$|The {{cattle and}} ponies {{living on the}} New Forest are not {{completely}} feral, but are owned by commoners, who pay an annual fee for each animal turned out. The animals are looked after by their owners and by the <b>Agisters</b> employed by the Verderers of the New Forest. The Verderers are a statutory body with ancient roots, who share management of the forest with the Forestry Commission and National park authority. Approximately 80per cent of the animals depastured on the New Forest are owned by just 10per cent of the commoning families.|$|R
50|$|The New Forest Act 1949 reconstituted the Court of Swainmote. A {{register}} of voters was {{kept by the}} Verderers and a secret ballot imposed to elect 5 Verderers who join 4 who were nominated - now by the Forestry Commission, DEFRA), Hampshire County Council and the Countryside Agency - together with an appointed Official Verderer. The Court's powers were strengthened, and fencing of roads began and cattle grids introduced. The Verderers could also grant the Forestry Commission new inclosures for timber production. <b>Agisters</b> carry out the day-to-day work with the animals {{on behalf of the}} court.|$|R
5000|$|Swainmote or Sweinmote {{was held}} {{three times a}} year: the {{fortnight}} before the feast of St. Michael, about the feast of St. Martin, and the fortnight before the feast of St. John the Baptist. It was presided over by the Warden and verderers, the foresters and <b>agisters</b> being in attendance. The first two occasions were to regulate agistment and pannage, respectively; the third was {{for the purpose of}} trying offenders before a jury of , or freemen of the forest. (The name of the court is sometimes said to be derived from swine, probably a misapprehension through its regulation of pannage.) ...|$|R

50|$|The chief royal {{official}} was the Warden. As {{he was often}} an eminent and preoccupied magnate, his powers were frequently exercised by a deputy. He supervised the foresters and under-foresters, who personally went about preserving the forest and game and apprehending offenders against the law. The <b>agisters</b> supervised pannage and agistment and collected any fees thereto appertaining. The nomenclature of the officers can be somewhat confusing: the rank immediately below the constable were referred to as foresters-in-fee, or, later, woodwards, who held land in the forest {{in exchange for a}} rent, and advised the warden. They exercised various privileges within their bailiwicks. Their subordinates were the under-foresters, later referred to as rangers. The rangers are sometimes said to be patrollers of the purlieu.|$|R
40|$|The {{financial}} stress and economic difficulties which characterized {{sectors of the}} agriculture industry during the 1980 s may continue to trouble some producers into the 1990 s {{as a result of}} drought and international competition. This report explains legal alternatives available to creditors for using a borrower's personal property to satisfy debt secured with personal property as well as unsecured debt. A debt is secured when a creditor has a lien; that is, the legal right to seize and use some of the borrower's property to pay an obligation. An unsecured debt is not accompanied with a legal right entitling the creditor to seize some of the borrower's property if the obligation is not paid. Instead, a creditor must convince a court that an amount is owed, but unpaid. The creditor will then proceed to collect payment as prescribed by statute and the court. The two most common means for a creditor to acquire a lien are 1) for the borrower to voluntarily grant a lien (a voluntary lien), and 2 } for the creditor to acquire a lien according to statutory law and without the borrower's consent. This second category of liens {{is often referred to as}} statutory, involuntarily, or nonconsensual liens. The most common statutory liens that apply to agriculture in North Dakota are the agricultural supplier's lien, agricultural processor's lien, and <b>agister's</b> lien (which encumbers livestock being kept or fed for their owner). The typical voluntary lien to encumber personal property is a security interest which empowers creditors to repossess the encumbered property as long as there is no breach of the peace. The alternative for creditors is to rely on the judicial proceeding of claim and delivery to seize the property. The law specifies limitations as well as protection for debtors. For example, a debtor is not relieved of an obligation even though the debtor's assets are not sufficient to pay the obligation. Likewise, a debtor cannot give away property to frustrate a creditor's collection attempts. However, a debtor is allowed to retain exempt assets; that is, those items state statutory law specifies as beyond the reach of creditors. Exempt personal property includes the family's clothing; one year's supply of provisions for the family (including fuel); a trailer, mobile home, or $ 7, 500 (substitute for a homestead); property valued between $ 5, 000 and $ 8, 000 ($ 2, 500 for a single person); a vehicle up to $ 1, 200 in value; and certain pensions, annuities, life insurance policies, retirement accounts, and limited payments from specified pension programs (such as social security). Financial disputes are not limited to debtors and creditors. Creditors also compete with each other to collect their obligation from the borrower's assets. Such conflicts are resolved according to the priority of the creditors. Few financial disputes will be litigated; instead, most culminate with the parties negotiating a settlement that is preferrable to litigation. The parties must fully understand their legal rights and the likely result of litigating (including the cost and time necessary to litigate), however, in order to recognize an acceptable settlement.
