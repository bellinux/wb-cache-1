40|$|Objectives :Significant {{progress}} has been made in the management of cardiorespiratory arrest and implementation of the survival chain. Early defibrillation using <b>automatic</b> <b>external</b> <b>defibrillators</b> (AED) is an essential element. There is however little information concerning the use of AED in pacemaker patients. The purpose of this work was to study the performance of AED in pacemaker patients experiencing cardiorespiratory arrest. Methods :This was a retrospective analysis using a database on Heartstart 2000 and 3000 (Laerdal) monophasic defibrillators. The sensitivity and specificity of AED in pacemaker patients was determined in comparison with a matched group of patients without a pacemaker. Results :The sensitivity of AED was lower in pacemaker patients than in their counterparts without pacemakers (56 % versus 79 %, p = 0. 019). Conclusion :This study demonstrated defective management of pacemaker patients experiencing cardiorespiratory arrest by <b>automatic</b> <b>external</b> <b>defibrillators</b> (Heartstart 2000 and 3000). ©Masson, 2006.

40|$|Sociological {{theories}} of health risks in late modernity emphasise the individualisation and increasing anxiety {{that results from}} prevention policies, while bio-sociality theories point {{to the creation of}} new, biologically or medically based social identities. In this article, we outline an alternative approach. We use micro-sociological interaction ritual theory to examine how health risk prevention technology shape interactions that generate collective identities. Drawing on fieldwork in two Dutch villages in 2008 - 2009 and again in 2014 that created interview, survey and observational data, we show that <b>automatic</b> <b>external</b> <b>defibrillators</b> turned into symbols of collective identity that elicited feelings of group membership, reflected moral values and filled community members with pride. We demonstrate that this collective identity formation process was shaped by the institutional and technological network of the <b>automatic</b> <b>external</b> <b>defibrillators.</b> In the concluding section of the article, we explore the conditions under which health-related collective identities might develop, particularly with regard to the institutions that create health policies and foster health risk awareness...|$|R
40|$|Sudden {{cardiac arrest}} (SCA) remains a {{leading cause of}} death in the industrialized world, {{representing}} ≈ 20 % of overall mortality. 1 Except for a few recent encouraging reports, 2 – 4 survival after SCA remains poor and relatively sta-ble over time, < 10 %, despite decades of research and major financial investments in resuscitation. 5 – 7 Clinical Perspective on p 1554 Because SCA often presents with an initial ventricular fibrillation, 8 external defibrillation has been incorporated as a key factor in the chain of survival since the early 1990 s. 9, 10 Public-access defibrillation programs have thus been devel-oped to make <b>automatic</b> <b>external</b> <b>defibrillators</b> (AEDs) publicly available, allowing rapid early defibrillation. 11 – 17 Although the benefits of AED are undeniable, public use rates remain very low, 4, 15, 18 and thus the effectiveness of such programs could be dramatically improved. One of the key issues is the disparity between the locations of AEDs and SCAs. In Paris, although AED deployment in the commu-nity, which started in 1993 with the progressive equipping of EMS ambulances, has been particularly active over the last decade, the choice of where to install AEDs in public places has been driven mainly by empirical considerations (local unguided initiatives). Recent studies have already pointed out the limitations of such an approach, calling for an evi-dence-based strategy. 19 Background—Although the benefits of <b>automatic</b> <b>external</b> <b>defibrillators</b> are undeniable, their effectiveness could be dramatically improved.

50|$|In 1979, Cobb and UW {{professor}} Mickey Eisenberg began training {{fire department}} {{emergency medical technician}} - Basics (EMT-Bs) to perform the administration of defibrillation for patients in cardiac arrest since the EMTs were usually at the patient’s side several minutes before the paramedics. Eisenberg began training 9-1-1 dispatchers to provide instructions to lay-persons on how to perform CPR in 1982.

40|$|The 2010 {{guidelines}} for cardiopulmonary resuscitation allow 5 seconds to give 2 breaths to deliver sufficient chest compressions {{and to keep}} perfusion pressure high. This study aims {{to determine whether the}} recommended short interruption for ventilations by trained lay rescuers and first responders can be achieved and to evaluate its consequence for chest compressions and survival. From a prospective data collection of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, we used <b>automatic</b> <b>external</b> <b>defibrillator</b> recordings of cardiopulmonary resuscitation by rescuers who had received a standard European Resuscitation Council basic life support and <b>automatic</b> <b>external</b> <b>defibrillator</b> course. Ventilation periods and total compressions delivered per minute during each 2 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation cycle were measured, and the chest compression fraction was calculated. Neurological intact survival to discharge was studied in relation to these factors and covariates. We included 199 <b>automatic</b> <b>external</b> <b>defibrillator</b> recordings. The median interruption time for 2 ventilations was 7 seconds (25 th- 75 th percentile, 6 - 9 seconds). Of all rescuers, 21 % took 60, > 70, and > 80 chest compressions per minute, respectively. The median chest compression fraction was 65 % (25 th- 75 th percentile, 59 %- 71 %). Survival was 25 % (49 of 199), not associated with long or short ventilation pauses when controlled for covariates. The great majority of rescuers can give 2 rescue breaths in < 10 seconds and deliver at least 70 compressions in a minute. Longer pauses for ventilations are not associated with worse outcome.

40|$|The pre-hospital {{emergency}} care for clients with {{acute myocardial infarction}} within the medical rescue service The pre-hospital {{emergency care}} for clients with acute myocardial infarction within the medical rescue service is the topic that I selected intentionally. On one side, I was guided by my own still fresh experience with my father {{and on the other}} side I was guided evenby the fact that interventions of the rescue service at patients with chest pains are still the most frequent indications. This is a really up-to-date subject due to contemporary life style and style of living of most of our inhabitants. The term acute coronary syndrome means all the statuses patho-physiologically connected with an instable plate and related thrombosis in the coronary artery. The main symptoms include chest pains or their equivalent in resting state. The bachelor thesis was processed on the basis of quantity method, using the technique of questionnaires. The research set included employees of the Medical Rescue Service of the South Bohemian Region. The first aim of the work was to make a chart of their opinions regarding use of <b>automatic</b> <b>external</b> <b>defibrillators</b> (AED). The results of the research investigation indicated that the employees of the Medical Rescue Service of the South Bohemian Region are well aware of recommended procedures in pre-hospital care for clients with acute myocardial infarction, which successfully confirmed the first hypothesis. Unfortunately, even the second hypothesis was successfully verified,as the <b>automatic</b> <b>external</b> <b>defibrillators</b> still do not belong to natural part of public locations equipment and that is why their use in practice is minimal. Based on results of this work that will be published in a specialised magazine rescue and Urgent Medicine, I would like to appeal to managing employees of medical rescue services to strengthen promotion of <b>automatic</b> <b>external</b> <b>defibrillators</b> and also to the Ministry of Health to more quickly extend the current stage of AED within legal rules of the Czech Republic, which do not still deal with attitude towards defibrillation, which does not solve the difference between manual and automatic defibrillation...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: <b>Automatic</b> <b>External</b> <b>Defibrillator</b> (AED) {{electrodes}} are flexible surface electrodes used {{to administer}} emergency defibrillation procedures. The electrodes {{used in this}} study have an elliptical shape with the ends of the long axis cutoff, as in fig. 1. Dimensions of the electrodes {{used in this study}} are 13. 3 cm x 8. 7 cm. A standard AED electrode design has a uniform conductor. Edge effects are known to occur whereby more current flows out of the edge of the electrode than from the central area [1]. An alternative design uses a high impedance perimeter to minimize edge effects [2].

40|$|Survival to {{discharge}} following a cardiac arrest {{is dependent on}} rapid and effective basic and advanced life support.
