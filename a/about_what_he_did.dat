5|$|Bart {{talks to}} Edna after class {{and starts to}} feel worse <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> when {{he is unable to}} console her. He tells the family what he had done, and the Simpsons then write a romantically poetic and {{diplomatic}} letter to tell her how Woodrow must leave, which makes Edna feel better.|$|E
500|$|Jake {{attends a}} $10,000-a-seat fundraiser with Winnie, buying a seat for Gekko to {{facilitate}} a [...] "chance" [...] meeting. Gekko confronts Bretton <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> to him and to KZI. Bretton replies that no one cares what Gekko thinks anymore. Gekko also bumps into Bud Fox, and they discuss their shared experience going to jail. Gekko follows Winnie outside, where she explains why she blames him for everything that went wrong, stemming from his affairs and her brother Rudy's suicide. Gekko claims he worked, from prison, {{to get the best}} therapists and even paid off a drug dealer to stop selling to Rudy, who died from an overdose. Winnie forgives him.|$|E
500|$|Havers said Lewis was {{a changed}} man who wanted to apologise to those he had hurt and to make amends. He said, [...] "There's always that danger Lewis could fall back into his old ways, and he is down to his last penny. But at the moment, Lewis is trying his hardest and has no ulterior motive— just {{an awful lot of}} ice to break instead!" [...] Lewis returns the money he took from Peter, adding an extra {{thousand}} pounds as compensation. Havers said that Lewis feels desperately bad <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did.</b> Upon entering the Rovers, Lewis is punched by Deirdre. [...] Havers stated that Lewis wants Audrey to forgive him and [...] give him a second chance. Lewis finds Audrey charming and honest and he likes being mothered by her to an extent. Havers said that Lewis did fall in love with Audrey while they were together, but no one believes him as he has told so many lies, and thought Lewis' one redeeming feature was not taking Audrey's money when he had the chance. Havers added, [...] "He's been feeling terrible because he did the dirty on her and he wants to make amends." ...|$|E

2500|$|Campese was {{involved}} in the biggest controversy of the World Cup Final in the 69th minute. English flanker Peter Winterbottom attempted a pass to Campese's opposing winger Rory Underwood, who at that stage [...] "may have had an overlap," [...] when Campese knocked the ball forward. The referee ruled it a deliberate knock-on and awarded England a penalty." [...] The English hooker, Brian Moore, thought the referee should have awarded a penalty try. Moore was reported after the Test to have said, [...] " [...] sets himself up as the saviour of rugby. Yet {{when it comes down to}} it he's as cynical as anyone. I wouldn't criticise Campese except he called me mad as a hatter earlier this week." [...] Moore writes in Beware of the Dog: Rugby's Hard Man Reveals All that, ‘I have no issue with what Campese did; I would have done the same, and he got away with it. The point I make <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> is that, as he has been shown to be as cynical as the rest of us, I don’t now want to hear lectures from him about the spirit of the game.’ ...|$|E
2500|$|At his {{arraignment}} at the District Court of Pittsburg County on June 4, 2002, Duty asked Judge Steven Taylor {{to enter}} a guilty plea to the murder and requested the death penalty, {{against the advice of}} his defense counsel. On October 28 of that year, Duty was deemed competent to enter the plea after court-ordered evaluations by the Carl Albert Community Mental Health Center and Eastern Oklahoma State Hospital. While testifying on his own behalf, Duty declined to present any mitigating evidence and said that he preferred death over spending a life sentence in lockdown 23 hours day. He also wrote to the prosecutor that he would kill again. Mary Wise pleaded to the court to sentence Duty to life in prison without the possibility of parole, stating: [...] "I don't believe he ought to have a choice. I think he ought to sit in that cell and face those four walls and think <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> {{for the rest of his}} natural-born life. And I hope and pray to God that you live to be 110 years old, because that's how long I want you to think about what you did." [...] Judge Taylor denied her request, calling Duty a [...] "textbook case for the death penalty". Duty was initially scheduled to be executed on February 24, 2005.|$|E

60|$|In Agno's large grass {{house was}} little light and much mystery. There was no mystery there for Jerry, who merely knew things, {{or did not}} know things, and who never bothered <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not know. Dried heads and other cured and mouldy {{portions}} of human carcasses impressed him {{no more than the}} dried alligators and dried fish that contributed to the festooning of Agno's dark abode.|$|E
60|$|She said it demurely, {{but there}} was a just {{perceptible}} something in her voice which might have warned the man had he been addicted to taking warning from anything, which was, however, not the case. It was, in fact, his trouble that he seldom thought <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> until he was compelled to face the consequences; and it was, perhaps, to his credit that he had after all done very little harm, for there was hot blood in him.|$|E

Now, I ain't saying that your firebug won't pull out of this, but he's taking the chances that it'll be thrown up in his face a hundred times 'twixt now and the next ten years, however straight he walks. If a boy would only bear that in mind I allow he'd be a heap more careful <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did.</b> Howsomever, you ain't here for a lecture of that kind, and what's more you don't need one.

50|$|In {{a fit of}} rage upon {{discovering}} he {{is being}} manipulated by Cadsuane, through his father Tam al'Thor, he very nearly unleashes the One Power on Tam.

6000|$|... "Then he {{was made}} king over {{all the people of}} the Green Forest, and his word was law. It was a very great honor, and for a while he felt it so and did his best to rule wisely. He went about just as before, hunting for his living, and had no more time than before for foolish {{thoughts}} or vain wishes. But after a little, the little people over whom he ruled began to bring him tribute, so that he no longer had to hunt for enough to eat. Indeed, he had so much brought to him, that he couldn't begin to eat all of it, and he grew very dainty and fussy <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> eat. Having nothing to do but eat and sleep, he grew very fat and lazy, {{as is the case with}} most people who have nothing to do. He grew so fat that when he walked, he puffed and wheezed. He grew so lazy that he wanted to be waited on all the time.|$|E
60|$|Having {{found that}} he had given himself more time than was {{necessary}} for his reflections and his walk, he had rested {{in the shade of}} a tree and had written two poems. One of these was the serenade which he would have roared out on the night air on a very recent occasion if he had had time to prepare it. It was, in his opinion, far superior to the impromptu verses of which he had been obliged to make use, and it pleased him to think that if things should go well with him after the interview to which he was looking forward, he would read that serenade to its object, and ask her to substitute it in her memory for the inharmonic lines which he had used in order to smother the degenerate melody of a foreign lay. The other poem was intended for use in case his interview should not be successful. But on the way home Mr. Locker experienced an entire change of mind. He came to believe that it would be unwise for him to arrange to use either of those poems on that day. For all he knew, Miss Asher might like foreign degenerate lays, and she might be annoyed that he had interfered with one. He remembered that she had told him that if he had insisted on an immediate answer to his proposition it would have been very easy to give it to him. He realized what that meant; and, for all he knew, she might be quite as ready this morning to act with similar promptness. That Du Brant business might have settled her mind, and it would therefore be very well for him to be careful <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> and what he asked for.|$|E
6000|$|Where {{there is}} sorrow there in holy ground. Some day people will realise what that means. They will {{know nothing of}} life till they do,--and natures like his can realise it. When I was brought down from my prison to the Court of Bankruptcy, between two policemen,--waited in the long dreary {{corridor}} that, before the whole crowd, whom an action so sweet and simple hushed into silence, he might gravely raise his hat to me, as, handcuffed and with bowed head, I passed him by. Men have gone to heaven for smaller things than that. It was in this spirit, and with this mode of love, that the saints knelt down to wash {{the feet of the}} poor, or stooped to kiss the leper on the cheek. I have never said one single word to him <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did.</b> I do not know to the present moment whether he is aware that I was even conscious of his action. It is not a thing for which one can render formal thanks in formal words. I store it in the treasure-house of my heart. I keep it there as a secret debt that I am glad to think I can never possibly repay. It is embalmed and kept sweet by the myrrh and cassia of many tears. When wisdom has been profitless to me, philosophy barren, and the proverbs and phrases of those who have sought to give me consolation as dust and ashes in my mouth, the memory of that little, lovely, silent act of love has unsealed for me all the wells of pity: made the desert blossom like a rose, and brought me out of the bitterness of lonely exile into harmony with the wounded, broken, and great heart of the world. When people are able to understand, not merely how beautiful ---'s action was, but why it meant so much to me, and always will mean so much, then, perhaps, they will realise how and in what spirit they should approach me.
