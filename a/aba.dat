5|$|<b>ABA</b> Games' sole developer, Kenta Cho, {{began writing}} {{games as a}} child during the 1980s using the NEC PC-6001 microcomputer, as there were few commercially {{available}} games. After leaving university, Cho contemplated professional games development but ultimately instead joined Toshiba to work in multimedia research and development. He continues to work full-time for Toshiba while running <b>ABA</b> Games as a hobby, working mainly on weekends. Cho is the sole contributor to <b>ABA</b> Games. Lacking musical training, he creates the soundtracks to his games using commercially available, pre-made samples. <b>ABA</b> Games releases a game approximately every six months, with {{the first three months}} spent creating prototypes and the latter three spent refining a finished version.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} area-based approaches (<b>ABAs)</b> {{in urban}} postdisaster contexts. After introducing {{the main features}} of <b>ABAs,</b> the paper discusses current practice in humanitarian response, and the need within urban areas to draw lessons from urban development approaches, from which <b>ABAs</b> have emerged. The paper then presents lessons from research concerning the application of <b>ABAs</b> in relation to phases of the project management cycle: assessment and design, implementation, and monitoring, evaluation and learning. The paper ends with a brief discussion. Overall, it argues that for <b>ABAs</b> to be effective, they need to draw on longstanding lessons from urban development, plan for a longer timeframe for their actions than is otherwise often the case in recovery operations, and consider the need to scale up actions for wider city application...|$|R

50|$|His {{capital was}} {{based at the}} fortress-city of Kars and <b>Abas</b> {{achieved}} numerous successes on both the foreign and domestic fronts.
