Despite the apparent success of the German fighter units, the air battle was not one-sided. On the morning of 11 May ten Ju 87s of StG 2 were shot down attacking Belgian forces in the Namur–Dinant gap, despite the presence of two Jagdgeschwader—27 and 51.

5|$|As these larger water {{droplets}} descend, coalescence continues, so that drops become heavy enough to overcome <b>air</b> <b>resistance</b> and fall as rain. Coalescence generally happens {{most often in}} clouds above freezing, and {{is also known as}} the warm rain process. In clouds below freezing, when ice crystals gain enough mass they begin to fall. This generally requires more mass than coalescence when occurring between the crystal and neighboring {{water droplets}}. This process is temperature dependent, as supercooled water droplets only exist in a cloud that is below freezing. In addition, because of the great temperature difference between cloud and ground level, these ice crystals may melt as they fall and become rain.|$|E

5|$|Both methods offered {{advantages}} and disadvantages, though in general greater muzzle velocity meant increased barrel wear. As guns fire, their barrels wear out, losing accuracy and eventually requiring replacement. At times, this became problematic; the US Navy seriously considered stopping practice firing of heavy guns in 1910 {{because of the}} wear on the barrels. The disadvantages of guns of larger calibre are that guns and turrets must be heavier; and heavier shells, which are fired at lower velocities, require turret designs that allow a larger angle of elevation for the same range. Heavier shells {{have the advantage of}} being slowed less by <b>air</b> <b>resistance,</b> retaining more penetrating power at longer ranges.|$|E

Galilei further asserted that the parabola was the theoretically ideal trajectory of a uniformly accelerated projectile in the absence of <b>air</b> <b>resistance</b> or other disturbances. He conceded that there are limits to the validity of this theory, noting on theoretical grounds that a projectile trajectory of a size comparable to that of the Earth could not possibly be a parabola, but he nevertheless maintained that for distances up to the range of the artillery of his day, the deviation of a projectile's trajectory from a parabola would be only very slight.|$|E

The presence of particular combinations of bacterial and yeast strains in voice prosthesis biofilms has been suggested to be crucial for causing valve failure. In order to identify combinations of bacterial and yeast strains causative to failure of voice prostheses, the effects of various combinations of bacterial and yeast strains on <b>air</b> flow <b>resistances</b> of Groningen button voice prostheses were determined.

The foams with the same porosity and pore opening size but different pore sizes have similar <b>air</b> flow <b>resistance</b> and sound absorbing performance, suggesting that there is no necessary relationship between the pore size and sound absorption performance of the present aluminum foams. With decreasing the pore opening size, the <b>air</b> flow <b>resistance</b> increased and the low-frequency absorption peak shifted towards lower frequencies but the height decreased.

5|$|A {{biography}} by Galileo's pupil Vincenzo Viviani {{stated that}} Galileo had dropped balls {{of the same}} material, but different masses, from the Leaning Tower of Pisa to demonstrate that their time of descent was independent of their mass. This was contrary to what Aristotle had taught: that heavy objects fall faster than lighter ones, {{in direct proportion to}} weight. While this story has been retold in popular accounts, there is no account by Galileo himself of such an experiment, and it is generally accepted by historians that it was at most a thought experiment which did not actually take place. An exception is Drake, who argues that the experiment did take place, more or less as Viviani described it. The experiment described was actually performed by Simon Stevin (commonly known as Stevinus) and Jan Cornets de Groot, although the building used was actually the church tower in Delft in 1586. However, most of his experiments with falling bodies were carried out using inclined planes where both the issues of timing and <b>air</b> <b>resistance</b> were much reduced.|$|E
5|$|If {{conditions}} are normal {{and a green}} light is shown, the athlete's coach – who is situated in a coaches' section lower down the inrun with a flag in hand – gives them the final signal to go; coaches may sometimes have to whistle or give a shouted confirmation in low-visibility conditions. Once given this signal, the athlete must commit to their jump within ten seconds or else risk disqualification: {{they are not allowed}} to exit the gate from whence they came. To begin descending the inrun, they drop down from the gate to a crouching position. Speed is rapidly picked up within seconds via built-in tracks, made from porcelain or ceramic, into which the skis are slotted. The athlete's streamlined crouch minimises <b>air</b> <b>resistance</b> along the inrun, and a further effort is made to reduce friction by not allowing the skis (which have wax applied to them) to bump too much against the sides of the tracks. Speed is measured from the table using a speed gun.|$|E
5|$|Higinbotham {{designed}} {{a game that}} used an oscilloscope to display {{the path of a}} simulated ball on a tennis court viewed from the side. The attached computer calculated the path of the ball and reversed its path when it hit the ground. The game also simulated the ball hitting the net if it did not achieve a high enough arc as well as changes in velocity due to drag from <b>air</b> <b>resistance.</b> Two aluminum controllers were attached to the computer, each consisting of a button and a knob. Pressing the button hit the ball, and turning a knob controlled the angle of the shot. Originally, Higinbotham considered having a second knob to control the velocity of the shot, but decided it would make the controller too complicated. The device was designed in a few hours with the help of colleague Dave Potter and was assembled over three weeks with the help of technician Robert V. Dvorak. While most of the circuitry was based on vacuum tubes and relays, the circuits to display the graphics on the oscilloscope used transistors, then beginning to replace vacuum tubes in the electronics industry. Excluding the oscilloscope and controller, the game's circuitry approximately took up the space of a microwave oven.|$|E

A strong increase in mean Peak Inspiratory Flow Rate (PIFR) has been obtained with decreasing inhaler resistance, varying between 160 l/min for a resistance equivalent to the Rotahaler and 50 l/min for the simulated Inhalator Ingelheim at maximum inspiratory effort. The volunteers experienced on average 55 % of maximum effort as comfortable (expressed in PIFR) and gave preference (82 %) to relative high <b>air</b> flow <b>resistances</b> in {{the range of}} 0. 4 - 0. 9 x 10 (5) (N- 0. 5. S. m(- 4)). It has been calculated that the real amount of work of breathing does not increase with increasing <b>air</b> flow <b>resistance</b> at comfortable inspiration mode. At maximum inspiration, the amount of work performed through a high resistance inhaler (1. 5 x 10 (5)) is approx. 70 % of that through a low resistance device (0. 4 x 10 (5)). The calculated mean PIFR of 62 l/min at maximum effort through an <b>air</b> flow <b>resistance</b> of 0. 9 x 10 (5), equivalent to the Turbuhaler, is in good agreement with PIFR-values of 68. 5 vs. 59 l/min from two other studies with asthmatic patients through this device.

40|$|Background. Speech valves {{help restore}} speech after {{surgical}} {{removal of the}} larynx (laryngectomy). Laryngectomized Patients breathe through an artificial opening (tracheostoma) in the neck. A shunt valve is routinely inserted between oesophagus and trachea to restore speech. At closure of the stoma with a finger, exhaled air is rerouted into the oesophagus, which will vibrate and form the new voice. Manual closure of the stoma attracts attention, requires one free hand and is unhygienic. Therefore automatic, hands-free speech valves are preferred. Present valves automatically close upon strong exhalation and open again when the pressure drops. This method wastes valuable air during closure and pressure should be maintained during speech, making long sentences or pauses impossible. The new iValve closes at strong inhalation. In speech mode, inhalation mid sentence is now made possible. The patient can speak almost as natural, pausing and whispering at will. The iValve automatic inhalation valve is a full silicone rubber, hands-free speech valve. The switching mechanism consists of a silicone rubber bi-stable valve shell. A prototype was tested in vitro. Method. 6 iValve prototype versions were tested in vitro at different settings. Closing flows, Opening pressures and <b>air</b> flow <b>resistances</b> were measured and compared with physiological values and the <b>air</b> flow <b>resistance</b> of two commercially available valves. Results. The iValve operates within physiological pressures and flows. <b>Air</b> flow <b>resistance</b> in breath mode was good, yet higher than the two commercial valves. Resistance in speech mode was above physiological <b>air</b> flow <b>resistance.</b> Conclusions. The iValve works and can be adjusted within physiological ranges. Pressures and flows can be independently controlled. <b>Air</b> flow <b>resistance</b> in speech mode should, and can, be decreased. The full silicone rubber mechanism is a viable novel design approach. The iValve offers a more intuitively useable alternative with more dynamic speech...|$|R
