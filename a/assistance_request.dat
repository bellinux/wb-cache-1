50|$|By the {{assistance}} of Ptolemy IX Lathyros, king of Egypt, he recovered part of his father's Syrian dominions ca. 95 BC, and held his court at Damascus, from where he tried to enlarge his dominions. To the south he defeated the Maccabean king Alexander Jannaeus in battle, following an <b>assistance</b> <b>request</b> of Jewish rebels, but the hostility of the local Jewish population forced him to withdraw. While attempting to dethrone his brother, Philip I Philadelphus, he was defeated by the Arabs and the Parthian Empire, and taken prisoner.

50|$|In the United States, {{many states}} and their Departments of Transportation have {{organized}} government-run Highway Assistance Patrols, or Highway Safety Patrols, {{to assist with}} highway emergencies as needed. While not law enforcement personnel, these persons provide free service to motorists in distress, and secure lanes of traffic, provide emergency medical <b>assistance,</b> <b>request</b> tow trucks for vehicles left in bad locations, remove debris from the roadway after a crash, and resolve minor disabled vehicle problems, such as flat tires, jumpstarts, or pushing a disabled vehicle out of travel lanes. Many of these patrols work directly with the State Police and Highway Operations departments of their state, and respond to assistance when a citizen calls 911 for minor roadside assistance duties.|$|E

40|$|The CSCL {{framework}} {{of this work}} aims at reinforcing knowledge by rebuilding and representing it synthetically in form {{of a network of}} concepts, which is built through exchanged messages using a chat and a graphical tool.

The hypothesis of this work states that significant troubles are expressed by students in form of <b>assistance</b> <b>requests</b> originating behavior patterns associated with certain phases defined within the collaborative learning sessions. Analysis of dialogs of real collaborative learning sessions confirmed this hypothesis, whose results point towards the development of on-line assistance system that aims at breaking the deadlocks caused by troubles expressed in the form of <b>assistance</b> <b>requests.</b> Derived from an analysis of 55 dialogs of a course of databases, we defined three phases characterized by particular <b>assistance</b> <b>requests</b> occurring during the collaborative learning sessions: a) a bootstrap phase characterized by requests about doubts of the use of tools; b) a work phase, wherein requests are related with the construction of the network concepts; c) the goodbye phase wherein requests reflect doubts about the final deliverable network...|$|R

50|$|Managing {{the stages}} of an asset {{recovery}} investigation can be extremely time consuming, complex and requires {{a great deal of}} resources, expertise, and political will. First, a victim country must succeed in tracing the stolen assets. Second, the victim country must request cooperation from authorities in the jurisdictions where the assets reside to seize the assets; these requests usually {{come in the form of}} a Mutual Legal <b>Assistance</b> <b>request</b> or a letter rogatory, though some common law countries allow the filing of a Mareva injunction in civil courts to achieve the same end. Third, legal processes must usually be initiated in the requested country in order to confiscate the assets. Following this, requested authorities must repatriate the assets back to the requesting country.|$|E
50|$|The {{pretext for}} renewed {{hostilities}} between Nejd and Hejaz {{came when the}} pilgrims from Nejd were denied access to the holy places in Hejaz. On August 29, 1924, Ibn-Saud began his military campaign against Hejaz by advancing towards Taif, which surrendered without a major struggle. Following the fall of Taif, the Saudi forces and the allied Ikhwan tribesmen moved on Mecca. Sharif Hussein’s request for British assistance was denied {{to him on the}} pretext of non-intervention in religious disputes. King Hussein bin Ali had meanwhile fled from Mecca to Jeddah, after the <b>assistance</b> <b>request</b> from King Abdullah of Transjordan was denied as well. The city of Mecca fell without struggle on October 13, 1924. The Islamic Conference, held in Riyadh on the 29th October 1924, brought a wide Islamic recognition of Ibn-Saud’s jurisdiction over Mecca.|$|E

A Russian State Duma delegation visiting Estonia in early May in regards the situation surrounding the Bronze Soldier of Tallinn had promised that Russia would aid such investigation in every way available.

This information has been requested to support your current rulemaking package on partial site release at nuclear reactor facilities. We have previously responded to the technical <b>assistance</b> <b>request,</b> completing the first three tasks on April 28, 2001. This memorandum provides the information requested by Task 4, guidance for use with the Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards (NMSS) Decommissioning Standard Review Plan (NUREG- 1727). Attached is the draft version of the staff guidance {{to be used with}} NUREG- 1727 in reviewing proposed partial site releases. The draft guidance will be released to the public for comment after the proposed rule is published. NMSS approach focuses on the considerations licensees and reviewers would need to make in developing the appropriate, reasonable scenarios for the released property and reach finality for site release, in the vast amount of cases. The guidance document is divided into three sections: (1) the technical review guidance; (2) more detailed technical bases; and (3) a checklist and worksheet for staff to use to quickly limit the amount of information needed and the number of scenarios that may need more consideration. After first screening out the scenarios that are not appropriate for the situation, the licensee would need to decide, and justify, the scenarios where calculations will be performed. The primary considerations are:! How could (or does) the remaining licensed property influence the dose on the partial release 1 (e. g., effluent releases, groundwater contamination, etc.) ?
