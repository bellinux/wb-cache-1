50|$|Advantages: As {{opposed to}} all other types of hot mix, PFC is {{designed}} to let water drain through the mixture into the underlying layer. PFC mixtures significantly reduce water spray, improve wet weather visibility and visibility of pavement markings, significantly reduce tire noise, and restore ride quality. PFC mixtures have stone on stone contact and relatively high amounts of asphalt binder. As a result, they offer good resistance to rutting and cracking. PFC mixtures are relatively easy to design and place. PFC mixtures require only a minimal <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>compaction</b> with a static roller. This helps facilitate a smooth riding surface. PFC mixtures provide for a roadway that has a uniform yet coarse surface texture. The coarse texture and permeable mix characteristics improve wet weather traction.|$|E

[...] It is a method by which successive layers of basin fill sediment are [...] "stripped off" [...] the total stratigraphy during analysis of that basin's history. In a typical scenario, a sedimentary basin deepens away from a marginal flexure, and the accompanying isochronous strata typically thicken basinward. By isolating the isochronous packages one-by-one, these can be [...] "peeled off" [...] or backstripped - and the lower bounding surface rotated upward to a datum. By successively backstripping isochrons, the basin's deepening history can be plotted in reverse, leading to clues as to its tectonic or isostatic origin. A more complete analysis uses decompaction of the remaining sequence following each stage of the back-stripping. This takes into account the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>compaction</b> caused by the loading of the later layers and allows a better estimation of the depositional thickness of the remaining layers and the variation of water depth with time.|$|E

Both the thickness and structure of the later sequence will be controlled by the underlying geology in the absence of any active tectonics. Buried tilted fault blocks in a rift basin often produce large anticlinal closures in the post-rift section that may form traps for hydrocarbons e.g. the Daqing Field, the largest oil field in the People's Republic of China (PRC), in the Songliao Basin.|$|R

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{performance}} of concrete is dependent on the packing density of the aggregate. All existing methods of measuring the packing density of aggregate are carried out under dry condition. However, these dry packing methods are sensitive to the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>compaction</b> applied and do not account for the effect of water in the concrete mix. In this research, a new method, which measures the packing density of aggregate under wet condition, has been developed. It is called the wet packing method and has the advantages that it is less sensitive to the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>compaction</b> applied and that it includes the effect of water. The wet packing method was compared to the dry packing method by applying both methods to measure the packing density of crushed rock fine aggregate. It was found that the packing density of crushed rock fine aggregate can be 24 % higher under wet condition than under dry condition and that the addition of superplasticizer can have a marginal contributing effect. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the beneficial effect of blending different size aggregates together is better revealed by the wet packing method than by the dry packing method. © 2008 RILEM. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|The {{magnetic}} anisotropy of Devonian black shale samples was measured from two cores drilled in the Appalachian Plateau. The mineralogy of the shales is predominantly clay, with small quantities of quartz and minor <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> opaques and chlorite. Magnetite is the predominant ferromagnetic mineral {{present in the}} samples. The magnetic fabric was measured at both room temperature and liquid-nitrogen temperature and is dominated by a well-defined bedding (vertical) compaction and a lesser defined magnetic lineation. Measurements of the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) at liquid-nitrogen temperature, which enhances the paramagnetic contribution i the rock, showed a strong increase in both the bulk susceptibility and susceptibility differences. This increase suggests that the AMS {{is controlled by the}} paramagnetic minerals, particularly the clays and chlorite. Strain was measured from the orientation of basal planes of the chlorite crystals by texture goniometry. Good correlations have been found (1) between the orientation of the magnetic lineation and the long axes of the chlorite crystals, and (2) between the degree of magnetic foliation and the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> vertical <b>compaction.</b> The magnetic lineation also agrees well with the direction of seismic anisotropy over the Plateau. The anisotropy of the anhysteretic remanence, which expresses the anisotropy due to the ferromagnetic component in the rocks, shows a weaker correlation with the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> vertical <b>compaction.</b> A weak magnetic lineation suggests that the magnetite grains were aligned during a deformation phase which post-dates the main Alleghanian orogeny.

40|$|It {{has been}} well {{documented}} that reservoirs show sometimes staggering <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>compaction</b> over years <b>of</b> production. The aquifer under Las Vegas, the Ecofisk development, and the Lake Maracaibo area are all examples where the subsidence of porous reservoirs have undergone a compaction observable to the naked eye. Studies of the elastic deformation of the surrounding country rock have shown the distribution of failure types {{to be associated with the}} volumetric collapse of a reservoir structure (Segall, 1998). However, the prediction of the nature and timing <b>of</b> the <b>compaction</b> <b>of</b> the reservoir itself need also be understood. Zoback (2001) has made inquiries into the nature <b>of</b> the <b>compaction</b> <b>of</b> granites, Ottawa sand, and the Adamswiller sandstone. This work focuses on an elastic deformation model that does not take into account time progression and creep behavior. The motivation for the study of the creep behavior of reservoir rocks is a fundamental problem of available time. This uncertainty manifests itself in two questions: Over what time scale do reservoirs compact? Can lab measurements capture meaningful parameters to understand the nature and development <b>of</b> reservoir <b>compaction?</b> Simply put, are compaction studies measured in the lab valid at all? After these difficult questions are answered, then next logical step is to ask what impact this can have on repeat seismic experiments that are all the rage in the new millennium. With the publishing <b>of</b> lab <b>compaction</b> data in Dudley and Myers (1994), the case is clear that meaningful measurements can be made despite implementation on time scales orders of magnitude shorter than significant to either geologic time or reservoir life. This results in our ability to make and trust compaction measurements on unconsolidated sand material. While this may solve engineering problems such as pore volume compressability and drive, it introduces a major wrinkle into the 4 D seismic experiment that must be recognized. As a reservoir continues to compact over a decade of production, the best models for fluid substitution or pressure dependence of a seismic attribute are meaningless if the rock frame has changed significantly...|$|R

We show that stylolite growth in a rock with a uniform grain size produces different patterns than stylolite growth in a rock with a bimodal grain size distribution. Strong pinning of large heterogeneities produce stylolite structures that are dominated by pronounced teeth, whereas a uniform grain size leads to spikes and a roughness that shows variable wavelengths. We compare the simulated stylolites with natural examples and show that the model can reproduce the real structures. In addition we show that strong pinning in the bimodal case {{can lead to a}} linear stylolite roughness growth in contrast to the non-linear growth of stylolites that develop from a uniform noise. In a set of 24 simulations we vary the main principle stress on the stylolite in order to test if our model can reproduce the analytically derived stress-scaling proposed by Schmittbuhl et al. (2004). We compare the calculated stresses with the applied stresses and show that the numerical model and the analytical solution are in good agreement.

40|$|A {{critical}} {{step in the}} design of asphalt mixtures is laboratory compaction. Laboratory compaction should reflect field compaction and should produce mixtures that are economical and possess high structural stability. During the compaction process, asphalt mixtures are subjected to certain <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>compaction</b> energy in order to achieve the required density. The Superpave volumetric mix design is based on compacting HMA mixtures to a specified compaction level described by the number of gyrations from the Superpave gyratory compactor (SGC). This level is termed Ndes and represents the required energy (based on the traffic level expected) to densify the mixture to a 4 % air voids level. This paper re-examines the Superpave compaction requirements through extensive laboratory investigation of the response of a number of asphalt mixtures to the applied compaction energy. It also presents an alternative method to estimate the number of gyrations at which a mixture first reaches an optimum aggregate interlock and hence prevents overcompaction problems that might result in unstable aggregate structures or dry asphalt mixtures. A total of 12 HMA mixtures were studied. During compaction, force measurement was made using the pressure distribution analyzer (PDA).

This {{study examined the}} effect of dryer diameter, RPM, airflow, and flower compaction on threshing petals from marigold flowers using two types of rotary dryers. A sectored rotary dryer was tested at three rotational speeds (2, 4, and 8 rpm) and two diameters (1. 2 and 1. 8 m). An open–chamber rotary dryer was tested with three levels of flower compaction (1. 0, 1. 5, and 2. 0 X) and three airflows (4. 3, 4. 5, and 5. 3 changes/min). Both the sectored and open chamber dryers performed well in drying and threshing petals from flowers. In most tests, more than 80 % of the petals were threshed when their moisture dropped to less than 10 %, i. e., within 20 to 24 h of drying. Threshing performance was different between the sectored and open dryer. The sectored dryer had a relatively large increase in the threshing rate after 10 to 15 h of drying while the open dryer’s threshing rates remained fairly constant. The open dryer produced more threshed, high moisture petals. Threshed material from both dryers contained an insignificant amount of trash.

There is an increase of moisture content during the rainy season, which tends to weaken {{the strength of the}} soil while in the dry season, the dust in such roads is a great menace to the comfort and well-being of road users and adjacent inhabitant. This study looks at the effect of lime variation on moisture content and dry density of lateritic soil in Ilorin, Nigeria. The lime concentrations used were 0 %, 2. 5 %, 5 %, and 7. 5 % respectively and a total of five specimens were used for each concentration to obtain moisture – density relation. British Standard (BS) 1377 method or procedure was used in carrying out the test. The results of analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that there is significant variation (at 5 % level of significance) in moisture contents and dry densities with lime concentration. The maximum dry density ranges from 1. 63 kg/dm 3 to 1. 89 kg/dm 3 and the moisture content ranges from 2. 2 % to 17. 2 % for the samples under consideration. The dry density of the sample decreases with increase in lime concentration with the rate of reduction being more between 0 % and 2. 5 % lime content while the moisture content increases with increase in lime content. The increase in the moisture content due to the addition of lime results into lower <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>compaction</b> or less compactive effort and this could be achieved by addition of small amounts of lime to laterite...|$|E

The collected data and approach are part of a R&D Eni proprietary project. The aim of the simulation was to strengthen the conceptual interpretation and to give insights on the distribution of dolomitization in the subsurface using a mass balance approach. The modelling process was subdivided into parts; at first the reconstruction of the compaction fluid flow and its funneling into the permeable paleohigh was calculated in a 3 D setting, then the RTM was applied. Sensitivities on the dolomite precipitation kinetics and on the diagenetic fluid composition suggested that the dolomitization was an efficient process even at the low temperatures, and the main difference regards the process rate. The permeability is the most important factor influencing the fluid flow and consequently the dolomitization. Copyright © AAPG. Serial rights given by author.

Full Depth Reclamation (FDR) is a roadway recycling technique that mills and mixes the existing roadway with a stabilizing agent and then re-compacts the mixture to create a thicker, stabilized pavement layer. This method is both cost effective and environmentally friendly, making it a very appealing option as the need to rehabilitate or increase the structural capacity of existing roads grows. In this study, the material characterization of FDR was examined as a composite material of both asphalt concrete pavement and some soil. This was accomplished by comparing different compaction methods utilized for both soil and Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) <b>compaction.</b> The effects <b>of</b> different <b>compaction</b> methods {{on the strength of}} the FDR mixtures were evaluated. The Superpave Gyratory Compactor is typically used for the <b>compaction</b> <b>of</b> HMA samples in the lab, and the Proctor hammer is the most common method <b>of</b> <b>compaction</b> for soil samples. In addition to these two methods, different sized compaction molds and varying <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>compaction</b> effort were compared as well. Optimum moisture contents for each compaction method were developed by compacting FDR samples at 2, 4, 6, and 8 percent water content and determining the dry density of the samples at each water content. With the exception of two, the slotted mold SGC compaction method and the modified Proctor method, the compaction curves displayed similar trends and could be used to easily identify an optimum moisture content. Two strength tests, the Marshall Stability and Flow test and the Indirect Tensile Strength Test (ITS), were then used {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} FDR samples compacted by each of the methods. For both the Marshall Stability test and the Indirect Tensile test, the SGC samples had higher strengths. The slotted SGC samples had a slightly higher stability and tensile strength than the unslotted SGC samples. The tensile strength ratios, which compare tensile strength of moisture conditioned samples to the tensile strength of unconditioned samples, showed that the strength of the FDR samples was decreased by at least 30 % when moisture conditioned. Overall, samples compacted in the gyratory compactor seemed to be stronger and more durable.

The deformations in the soil were caused by a loaded pneumtic tyre on the surface. In the experimental work, both the process <b>of</b> soil <b>compaction</b> and the final state of the soil following the passage of a wheel were monitored. The experiments showed that soil compaction on light textured soils is caused by a punch failure of the soil, therefore most <b>of</b> the <b>compaction</b> is confined to the area directly below the wheel. The experimental monitoring of soil deformations was a slow and complex process, drawing firm conclusions from the work was further complicated by the interactions of the input variables, such as load and contact length. In order to monitor the effect of individual inputs on soil compaction a thre dimensional mathematical model of the process was developed from Theories of Elasticity and a confined compression soil test. The model predicted the subsurface deformations in the three principle directions due to surface loads. Once the model was modified to account for the support capability of the soil it proved it could, with resonable accuracy, predict the defomations and hence soil canpaction due to a tyre on the soil surface. The model was used to predict the effect of various tyre configurations on soil ccrnpaction.

Some methods for improving the efficacy of RP are mixing with elemental sulfur (Mohammady Aria et al. 2010), partial acidulation with nominal <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> acid, dry <b>compaction</b> with water-soluble P fertilizers (Biswas and Narayanasamy 2006) and mixing RP with organic residues, such as compost, manure, and vermicompost (Odongo et al. 2007; Biswas and Narayanasamy 2006).|$|R
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 26 - 29, 1992 / Town and Country Hotel and Convention Center, San Diego, CaliforniaLempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) {{algorithm}} {{is a popular}} data compaction technique that has been adopted by CCITT in its V. 42 bis recommendation and is often implemented {{in association with the}} V. 32 standard for 9600 bps modems. It has also been implemented as Microcom Networking Protocol (MNP) Level 7, where it goes by the name of Enhanced Data Compression. LZW compacts data by encoding frequently occurring input strings with a single output symbol. The algorithm automatically generates a string dictionary for each symbol {{at each end of the}} transmission path. The <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>compaction</b> that can be derived with the LZW algorithm varies with the type of data being transmitted and the efficiency by which table entries can be indexed. Table indexing is usually implemented by use of a hashing table. Although some manufacturers advertise a 4 -to- 1 gain in throughput, this seems to be an extreme case. This paper documents a implementation of the exact ZLW algorithm. The results presented in this paper are significantly less, typically on the order of 1 -to- 2 for ASCII text, with substantially less compaction for pre-compacted files or files containing random bit patterns. The efficiency of the LZW algorith on ASCII text is shown to be a function of dictionary size and block size. Although fewer transmitted symbols are required for larger dictionary tables, the additional bits required for the symbol index is marginally greater than the efficiency that is gained. The net effect is that dictionary sizes beyond 2 K in size are increasingly less efficient for input data block sizes of 10 K or more. The author concludes that the algorithm could be implemented as a direct table look-up rather than through a hashing algorithm. This would allow the LZW to be implemented with very simple firmware and with a maximum of hardware efficiency...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Conversion of {{tropical}} peatlands to agriculture {{leads to a}} release of carbon from previously stable, long-term storage, resulting in land subsidence {{that can be a}} surrogate measure of CO 2 emissions to the atmosphere. We present an analysis of recent large-scale subsidence monitoring studies in Acacia and oil palm plantations on peatland in SE Asia, and compare the findings with previous studies. Subsidence in the first 5 yr after drainage was found to be 142 cm, of which 75 cm occurred in the first year. After 5 yr, the subsidence rate in both plantation types, at average water table depths of 0. 7 m, remained constant at around 5 cm yr− 1. The results confirm that primary consolidation contributed substantially to total subsidence only in the first year after drainage, that secondary consolidation was negligible, and that the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>compaction</b> was also much reduced within 5 yr. Over 5 yr after drainage, 75 % of cumulative subsidence was caused by peat oxidation, and after 18 yr this was 92 %. The average rate of carbon loss over the first 5 yr was 178 t CO 2 eq ha− 1 yr− 1, which reduced to 73 t CO 2 eq ha− 1 yr− 1 over subsequent years, potentially resulting in an average loss of 100 t CO 2 eq ha− 1 yr− 1 over 25 yr. Part of the observed range in subsidence and carbon loss values is explained by differences in water table depth, but vegetation cover and other factors such as addition of fertilizers also influence peat oxidation. A relationship with groundwater table depth shows that subsidence and carbon loss are still considerable even at the highest water levels theoretically possible in plantations. This implies that improved plantation water management will reduce these impacts by 20 % at most, relative to current conditions, and that high rates of carbon loss and land subsidence are inevitable consequences of conversion of forested tropical peatlands to other land uses...|$|E

We have derived acoustic (Vp) and mechanical (uniaxial poroelastic compliance, compaction amplitude) properties of samples from various drill sites along the Muroto (ODP 1173) and Kii transects (IODP C 0001, C 0002, C 0006, and C 0007) from isotropic loading tests where confining and pore pressure were independently applied. We quantified the dependence of Vp on both effective (Peff) and confining (Pc) pressure, {{which can be used}} to correct atmospheric pressure measurements of Vp. Experimental Vp obtained on core samples extrapolated to in situ conditions are slightly higher than logging-derived velocities, which can be attributed either to velocity dispersion or to the effect of large-scale faults and weak zones on waves with longer wavelength. In the high-porosity (30 %- 60 %) tested sediments, velocities are controlled at first order by porosity and not by lithology, which is in agreement with our static measurements of drained framework incompressibility, much smaller than fluid incompressibility. Rather than framework incompressibility, shear modulus is probably the second-order control on Vp, accounting for most of the difference between actual Vp and the prediction by Wood's (1941) suspension model. We also quantified the mechanical state of Nankai samples in terms of anisotropy, diagenesis, and consolidation. Both acoustic and mechanical parameters reveal similar values in vertical and horizontal directions, attesting to the very low anisotropy of the tested material. When considering the porous samples of the Upper Shikoku Basin sediments (Site 1173) as examples of diagenetically cemented material, several mechanical and acoustic attributes appeared as reliable experimental indicators of the presence of intergrain cementation. We also detected incipient cementation in samples from IODP Site C 0001 (accretionary prism unit). In terms of consolidation, we distinguished two classes of material response (shallow, deformable samples and deep, hardly deformable ones) based on the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>compaction</b> upon application of a Peff large with respect to the inferred in situ value, with a transition that might be related to a critical porosity...|$|E
40|$|The desert {{tortoise}} (Gopherus agassizii) {{populations have}} been in decline and have {{been placed on the}} endangered species list. No single factor is ultimately responsible for the tortoise decline. It is a combination of events that collectively have a negative impact. I chose to focus my study on only one factor, off-road vehicles. By evaluating the damage done to the terrain by off-road vehicles, a better understanding of their impact on the tortoise populations can be assessed and protective measures taken. The <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> available vegetation does not seem {{to play a role in}} their decisions of which plants to eat. If vehicles are destroying the native plants required by the tortoise, then a decline in population could happen. Tortoises also make a majority of their burrows next to plants to have more shade and result in being less visible. This leads to the unintentional crushing of the tortoise burrow. Not only do these vehicles destroy burrows and vegetation they also compact the soil making plant growth more difficult while decreasing the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> available vegetation. The <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> soil <b>compaction</b> will be measured by means of a bulk density analysis. There will be one test site and one control site. Each site will be 0. 6 square miles in size and the test site will have an off-road track running through the middle of it. Transects will be ran in order to record burrow locations...|$|R
