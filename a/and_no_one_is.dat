5|$|It is an unseasonably hot Easter at church, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> {{interested}} in Reverend Lovejoy's sermons. When the collection plate is passed around, Homer puts in a chocolate Easter bunny {{that he found}} in the dumpster, enraging Reverend Lovejoy, calling it a wicked idol, and provoking him to read the Bible from the beginning. The Simpsons all fall asleep.|$|E

25|$|Alien civilizations {{might be}} {{technically}} capable of contacting Earth, but are only listening instead of transmitting. If all, or even most, civilizations act the same way, the galaxy could {{be full of}} civilizations eager for contact, but everyone is listening <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> transmitting. This is the so-called SETI Paradox.|$|E

25|$|In {{regards to}} the prophetic works, the {{character}} Oothoon represented America in Visions of the Daughters of Albion and she is raped by the character Bromion. The book represents her as trapped by a philosophical system created by John Locke, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> able to hear her pleas except for the daughters of Albion. The implications of the work are taken up again in America with the King of England trembling as he witnesses Orc and the rebelling colonies. Although there is a vision of rebellion, there is no actual freedom {{at the end of}} the poem just as in the Visions of the Daughters of Albion. Unlike the Visions of the Daughters of Albion, America, as well as Europe, describes nations that are trying to determine their own destiny instead of individuals trying to deal with theirs. The Song of Los is connected to both America and Europe in that it describes Africa and Asia, which operate as a sort of frame to the other works. As such, the three works are united by the same historical and social themes.|$|E

500|$|According to Brown, who was Editor of Highlights for Children, [...] "Without Goofus, Gallant {{would be}} bland {{and no one}} would pay attention. But kids see parts of {{themselves}} in both characters. No one is as good as Gallant, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> as bad as Goofus. But being more like Gallant is something to strive for." [...] For many years, a short line of text reading [...] "Gallant shows correct behavior" [...] was included {{at the bottom of the}} comic.|$|E

500|$|Later the British Egyptologist Sir Peter Le Page Renouf {{summed up}} Young's method: 'He worked mechanically, like the schoolboy who finding in a {{translation}} that Arma virumque means 'Arms and the man," [...] reads Arma [...] "arms," [...] virum [...] "and", que [...] "the man." [...] He is sometimes right, but very much oftener wrong, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> {{able to distinguish}} between his right and his wrong results until the right method has been discovered.' Nonetheless, {{at the time it}} was clear that Young's work superseded everything Champollion had by then published on the script.|$|E
500|$|Thematically, Stefani {{considered}} the album to be mainly [...] "a breakup record", declaring: [...] "I {{would consider it}} a breakup record. [...] It just makes me believe in God and my journey. My cross to bear was to go through these heartbreaks and write these songs and help people." [...] The singer also told Ryan Seacrest that while writing the songs for the album during her personal struggles {{with the end of}} her marriage, she felt the process was therapeutic. She commented: [...] "The record company was like, 'Listen, we really think your record is too personal <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> going to relate to this record and maybe you should just put it out as an artistic body of work—don't even think about radio'." [...] She described the sensation of hearing this was like being punched in the stomach.|$|E
500|$|In December 2011, Disney {{announced}} that the film would be converted to 3D. Said Whedon, [...] "I'm {{not a big fan}} of extreme long lens, talky movies – I like to see the space I'm in and relate to it, so 3D kinda fits my aesthetic anyway. And the technology has advanced so far in the past couple years." [...] Whedon also said that [...] "there definitely are movies that shouldn't be in 3D" [...] but [...] "The Avengers isn't obnoxiously 3D. There's no, 'Oh look, we're going to spend 20 minutes going through this tunnel because it's in 3D!' <b>And</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> pointing at the screen the entire time. But it's an action movie. Things tend to hurtle toward the screen anyway". In January 2012, it was reported that the film would be digitally remastered for IMAX 3D and open in IMAX theaters on May 4, 2012, the same day it opens in regular theaters. The film's IMAX release follows Marvel's IMAX releases of Iron Man 2 and Thor.|$|E

500|$|Routine decrees (ferman) or {{titles of}} {{privilege}} (berat) {{were written by}} a scribe, but those written to certain officials and those that were particularly important were preceded by the Sultan's handwritten note beside his seal (tughra). The tughra and the notation might be surrounded by a decorated frame. The note would emphasize a particular part of his edict, urging or ordering it to be followed without fault. These were called Hatt-ı Hümayunla Müveşşeh Ferman (ferman decorated with a hatt-ı hümayun) or Unvanına Hatt-ı Hümayun (hatt-ı hümayun to the title). The note might use a clichéd phrase like [...] "to be done as required" [...] (mûcebince amel oluna) or, [...] "my command is to carried out as required <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> to interfere with its execution" [...] (emrim mûcebince amel oluna, kimseye müdahale etmeyeler). Some edicts to the title would start with a note from the Sultan praising the person(s) to whom the edict was addressed, {{in order to encourage}} or honor him. Rarely, there might be a threat such as [...] "if you want to keep your head, carry out this order as required" [...] (Başın gerek ise mûcebiyle amel oluna).|$|E
2500|$|Article 37 {{provides}} for the presumption of innocence, stating: [...] "Innocence is to be presumed, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> to be held guilty of a charge unless his or her guilt has been established by a competent court." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lott {{argues in}} both More Guns, Less Crime and The Bias Against Guns that {{defensive}} gun use (DGU) is underreported, noting that in general, only shootings ending in fatalities {{are discussed in}} news stories. In More Guns, Less Crime, Lott writes that [...] "ince in many defensive cases a handgun is simply brandished, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> harmed, many defensive uses are never even reported to the police." ...|$|E

2500|$|Beside the {{original}} granite baptismal font now situated within the entrance porch is an intentionally uncomfortable bench called the [...] "kællingbænken", or [...] "hags' bench". [...] The present baptismal font {{is believed to}} be the work of Bertel Thorvaldsen; however, the font was loaned out in the early 20th century, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> able to tell whether the Thorvaldsen font was returned or a similar one from Svanninge. [...] Other yet older treasures of the church are the ciborium from 1639 and the chalice from 1676. [...] The bronze candlesticks dating to 1640 are another special holding.|$|E
2500|$|Russian Federation is a {{multi-national state}} with over 170 ethnic groups {{designated}} as nationalities, population {{of these groups}} varying enormously, from millions in case of e.g. Russians and Tatars to under ten thousand {{in the case of}} Nenets and Samis. Among 83 subjects which constitute the Russian Federation, there are 21 national republics (meant to be home to a specific ethnic minority), 5 autonomous okrugs (usually with substantial or predominant ethnic minority) and an autonomous oblast. However, as Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe Gil-Robles noted in 2004 report, whether or not the region in [...] "national", all the citizens have equal rights <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> privileged or discriminated on account of their ethnic affiliation.|$|E
2500|$|In {{another of}} his {{theological}} works, Swedenborg wrote that eating meat, regarded in itself, [...] "is something profane" [...] and was not practiced {{in the early days}} of the human race. However, he said, it now is a matter of conscience, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> condemned for doing it. Nonetheless, the early-days ideal appears to have given rise to the idea that Swedenborg was a vegetarian. That conclusion may have been reinforced by the fact that a number of Swedenborg's early followers were part of the vegetarian movement that arose in Britain in the 19th century. However, the only reports on Swedenborg himself are contradictory. His landlord in London, Shearsmith, said he ate no meat, but his maid, who served Swedenborg, said that he ate eels and pigeon pie.|$|E

2500|$|In both NASCAR and IndyCar, {{a single}} yellow flag waved from the starter's stand places the race under caution. At this time, a pace car {{will enter the}} course and lead the field at a safe, predetermined, reduced speed. On oval tracks, yellow lights universally {{supplement}} the primary flag at the start/finish line. These lights usually operate in a flashing manner, in order to quickly gain {{the attention of the}} drivers. The field is locked into place at the onset of caution periods <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> allowed to pass another car without mutual consent (excluding crashed and immobile cars). In some races, though, cars may pass one another on pit road during a caution period. [...] When the starter shows a furled yellow flag, it indicates one lap to green.|$|E
2500|$|Wu and Wong's {{match in}} the 1957 kung fu {{competition}} in Taiwan {{is the only}} documented proof of Wong's involvement in fighting competition; the only records of Wong's beimo matches are from eyewitnesses. Since beimo competition was held secretly, the loser often denied involvement in the fight afterward, or both sides would claim victory after the fight. For example, in the match between Ni Yuk Tong [...] (倪沃棠) and Wong, various accounts of the fight exist, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> sure of where the fight took place, how the fighters performed, and who won. Thus, while many of Wong's students have referred to him as [...] "one of the greatest fighters of this century" [...] (i.e., the 20th century), those outside the wing chun community could doubt the claim's authenticity.|$|E
2500|$|Attempting to {{quantify}} this phenomenon, {{in the first}} edition of the book, published in May 1998, Lott wrote that [...] "national surveys" [...] suggested that [...] "98 percent of the time that people use guns defensively, they merely have to brandish a weapon to break off an attack." [...] In that same paragraph he also wrote that [...] "ince in many defensive cases a handgun is simply brandished, <b>and</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> harmed, many defensive uses are never even reported to the police." [...] The higher the rate of defensive gun uses that do not end in the attacker being killed or wounded, the easier it is to explain why defensive gun uses are not covered by the media without reference to media bias. Lott cited the figure in op-eds in the Wall Street Journal and the Los Angeles Times.|$|E
