5|$|Harvey {{also noted}} that the fatwa covered a wide range of Islamic {{religious}} duties, while usually a responsum fatwa only <b>addresses</b> <b>a</b> specific enquiry on a difficult point of detail. The fatwa also went into specific practical challenges faced by Muslims in Spain, such as the pressure to curse Muhammad, eat pork, drink wine, and intermarry with the Christians. This suggests that the author had some knowledge of what life under Christian rule was like.|$|E
5|$|So Far, So Good... So What! (stylized as so far, so good... so what !) is {{the third}} studio album by the American thrash metal band Megadeth, {{released}} on January 19, 1988 by Capitol Records. It is the band's only album recorded with drummer Chuck Behler and guitarist Jeff Young, {{both of whom were}} fired immediately after its subsequent tour. So Far, So Good... So What! features music performed at very fast tempos with technical ability; lyrically, frontman and guitarist Dave Mustaine <b>addresses</b> <b>a</b> variety of topics, including nuclear holocaust and freedom of speech.|$|E

The character of Dave was written as both a side of Hurley who denied his problems and an analogue to Hurley's disappeared father, and his scenes were filmed so that his reveal as imaginary would be a plot twist.|$|E

5|$|In December 1999, RFC 2732 {{provided}} a minor update to RFC 2396, allowing URIs to accommodate IPv6 <b>addresses.</b> <b>A</b> number of shortcomings {{discovered in the}} two specifications led to a community effort, coordinated by RFC 2396 co-author Roy Fielding, that culminated in the publication of RFC 3986 in January 2005. While obsoleting the prior standard, it did not render the details of existing URL schemes obsolete; RFC 1738 continues to govern such schemes except where otherwise superseded. RFC 2616 for example, refines the http scheme. Simultaneously, the IETF published the content of RFC 3986 as the full standard STD 66, reflecting {{the establishment of the}} URI generic syntax as an official Internet protocol.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{production}} designer Richard Hudolin flew to Los Angeles, 1996 {{to gather}} material from Stargate for reference {{and found the}} original film prop stored outside in the Californian desert. Although the prop had severely disintegrated, he could take a detailed mould for Stargate SG-1 production to build its own prop. The new Stargate was engineered to turn, lock the chevrons, and be computer-controlled to dial specific gate <b>addresses.</b> <b>A</b> portable Stargate prop was built for on-location shoots and required six workers and one full day to set up. Since visual effects are sometimes faster and cheaper, a computer-generated Stargate was occasionally used in on-location shoots in later seasons.|$|E
5|$|Several of {{the large}} runestones in Scandinavia notify of an inheritance, such as the Hillersjö stone, which {{explains}} how a lady came to inherit the property of not only her children but also her grandchildren and the Högby Runestone, which tells that a girl was the sole heir {{after the death of}} all her uncles. They are important proprietary documents from a time when legal decisions were not yet put to paper. One interpretation of the Tune Runestone from Østfold suggests that the long runic inscription deals with the funeral ale in honor of the master of a household and that it declares three daughters to be the rightful heirs. It is dated to the 5th century and is, consequently, the oldest legal document from Scandinavia that <b>addresses</b> <b>a</b> female's right to inheritance.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} compares {{prosodic}} features of child-directed speech (CDS) and foreigner-directed speech (FDS), to exam-ine whether FDS is a derivative of CDS as suggested in socio-linguistic studies. Twelve female speakers completed a simple referential communication task <b>addressed</b> to <b>an</b> imaginary adult, an imaginary foreigner, and an imaginary child. The results showed that, {{compared to the}} adult-directed baseline (ADS), participants increased pitch range and f 0 maxi-ma when <b>addressing</b> <b>a</b> child, but not when <b>addressing</b> <b>a</b> for-eigner. Furthermore, participants lowered their speech rate when addressing interlocutors with limited linguistic capacity, but did so differentially: Participants tended to lengthen pauses when <b>addressing</b> <b>an</b> imaginary foreigner, and tended to lengthen segments when <b>addressing</b> <b>an</b> imaginary child. These {{findings suggest that the}} prosodic features of CDS and FDS are different, and that speakers have acquired knowl-edge about how to fine-tune their prosodic adjustments to the specific needs of different interlocutors. 1...|$|R
