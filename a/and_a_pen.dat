5|$|Vidya goes to meet Damji, {{followed}} by Rana and Khan. Damji cuts the meeting short when Vidya expresses her {{doubt that he}} will be able to return her husband in exchange for the sensitive file, and he attempts to leave. Vidya tries to stop him, and in the ensuing struggle Damji draws a gun on her. Vidya disarms him using the prosthetic belly she has been using to fake her pregnancy and promptly stabbing him in the neck with her hair stick, before shooting him with his own gun. She flees into the crowd before the police arrive, leaving a thank you note for Rana <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>pen</b> drive containing data from Sridhar's computer, which leads to Bhaskaran's arrest. Rana concludes that no Vidya or Arnab Bagchi ever existed, and that Vidya had been using the police and the IB to achieve her own ends.|$|E
25|$|A simple {{seismometer}} that {{is sensitive}} to up-down motions of the earth can be understood by visualizing a weight hanging on a spring. The spring and weight are suspended from a frame that moves along with the earthʼs surface. As the earth moves, the relative motion between the weight and the earth provides {{a measure of the}} vertical ground motion. If a recording system is installed, such as a rotating drum attached to the frame, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>pen</b> attached to the mass, this relative motion between the weight and earth can be recorded to produce a history of ground motion, called a seismogram.|$|E
25|$|The manual method uses a {{scorecard}} <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>pen.</b> The scorecard is colloquially {{known as}} The Book. Using the book, the scorer fills out two main sections per ball, the bowling analysis and the batting analysis. Each section helps track {{the number of}} balls bowled in an over, any extras (such as Wide Balls and No Balls) and also any wickets (or dismissals). At {{the end of each}} over, the scorer may fill in an over analysis with the score {{at the end of the}} over, the number of wickets that have fallen, any penalties incurred and the number of the bowler in the analysis.|$|E

25|$|There was {{an initial}} burst of activity, with the commissioners asking John Aram and Langley Edwards {{to produce a}} survey and {{estimate}} {{the cost of the}} work in June 1751, which was duly produced. The men recommended canalising some stretches of the river, and suggested that seven staunches <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>pen</b> sluice would be needed. A large basin would be constructed close to West Acre bridge. No further action was taken until 1757, when a treasurer was appointed. He advertised for subscribers, who would receive the toll revenues, and Langley Edwards was appointed to carry out the work. The navigation would be suitable for lighters holding 10 tonnes, and the locks would be large enough to hold a single lighter.|$|E
25|$|The {{final section}} of the river near its mouth was {{diverted}} northwards when the Great Ouse was re-routed to a new outfall at King's Lynn after the thirteenth century. The river was made navigable from its mouth to Narborough and probably to West Acre {{as a result of}} an Act of Parliament obtained in 1751. Ten single-gate sluices <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>pen</b> sluice (or pound lock) were used to handle the change in level. The use of the river declined rapidly after the opening of a railway from King's Lynn to Dereham between 1846 and 1848. In 1884, the river was taken over by the River Nar Drainage Board, and closed to navigation, when an un-navigable sluice was constructed to the south of a Manure Factory in King's Lynn. A new sluice very close to the junction with the Great Ouse has been built more recently.|$|E

Mardas said he planned to donate the money to a charity in Greece. The 'custom Vox Kensington guitar' later sold at an auction for £269,000 on 19 May 2013. Mardas lived in Athens until his death on 13 January 2017 after a battle with pneumonia; he was aged 74.|$|E

500|$|Bede's {{commentary}} on Tatwine calls him a [...] "vir religione et Prudentia insignis, sacris quoque literis nobiliter instructus" [...] (a man notable for his prudence, devotion and learning). [...] These qualities were {{displayed in the}} two surviving manuscripts of his riddles and four of his Ars Gramattica Tatuini. The Ars {{is one of only}} two surviving eighth-century Latin grammars from England, and was based on the works of Priscian and Consentius. The riddles deal with such diverse topics as philosophy and charity, the five senses and the alphabet, and a book <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>pen.</b> The riddles are formed in acrostics. The grammar is a reworking of Donatus's Ars Minor with the addition of information drawn from other grammarians. It was not designed for a newcomer to the Latin language, but is designed for more advanced students. It covers the eight parts of speech through illustrations drawn from classical scholars, although not directly but through other grammatical works. There are also some examples drawn from the Psalms. The work was completed before he became archbishop, and was used not only in England but also on the continent. A recent edition of his works is Tatuini Opera omnia, published in 1968 with some translations into English and German from the original Latin.|$|E
500|$|Vannevar Bush {{was born}} in Everett, Massachusetts, on March 11, 1890, the third child and only son of Perry Bush, the local Universalist pastor, and his wife Emma Linwood (née Paine). He had two older sisters, Edith and Reba. He was named after John Vannevar, {{an old friend of}} the family who had {{attended}} Tufts College with Perry. The family moved to Chelsea, Massachusetts, in 1892, and Bush graduated from Chelsea High School in 1909. He then attended Tufts, like his father before him. A popular student, he was vice president of his sophomore class, and president of his junior class. During his senior year, he managed the football team. He {{became a member of the}} Alpha Tau Omega fraternity, and dated Phoebe Clara Davis, who also came from Chelsea. Tufts allowed students to gain a master's degree in four years simultaneously with a bachelor's degree, so for his master's thesis, Bush invented and patented a [...] "profile tracer". This was a device for assisting surveyors that looked like a lawn mower. It had two bicycle wheels, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>pen</b> that plotted the terrain over which it traveled. It was the first of a string of inventions. On graduation in 1913 he received both bachelor of science and master of science degrees.|$|E

The motto of the hall, [...] "Lux In Tenebris", which is Latin for [...] "Light In Darkness", was suggested by Raymond's mate at the time, a lady by the name Muna Twerefour". The emblem was officially adopted on Tuesday, 2 April 2013.|$|E

2500|$|In 1984, Hatch, a Fulbright-trained {{economist}} and international development expert, conceived a new method for delivering {{assistance to the}} poor. In an airplane high above the Andes, Hatch was {{en route to a}} consultant assignment in Bolivia, when inspiration struck. He grabbed in-flight cocktail napkins, scraps of paper, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>pen</b> and began writing down ideas, equations, and flow charts as fast as he could. By the time he landed in La Paz, he had the outline of a radically different approach to poverty alleviation: a financial services program that put the poor in charge. “Give poor communities the opportunity, and then get out of the way!” he said. He called the idea [...] "village banking". This approach gave the poor the opportunity to obtain loans without collateral-the poor's main obstacle to accessing credit—at market-level interest rates.|$|E
2500|$|Khouri is a screenwriter, director, producer, feminist, lecturer, {{and author}} of non-fiction. She also worked as an actress, lecturer, and waiter in Nashville. While working {{for a company that}} made {{commercials}} and music videos, she began writing Thelma & Louise, her first produced screenplay. Thelma & Louise won Khouri the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay, a Golden Globe Award, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>PEN</b> Literary Award, as well as the London Film Critics Circle Award for Film of the Year and a nomination for Best Original Screenplay from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts. According to an interview done by David Konow, a scholarly author and journalist, Callie Khouri mentioned her experience filming her first major film, Thelma & Louise. “While I was writing Thelma and Louise, it was the most fun I had ever had in my life, bar none,” she says. “It was such a pure experience. There was no self-censorship there, there was no second guessing. From a creative standpoint, it was the freest I had ever been in my life. I loved every moment I got to spend time with those characters. Nothing came close to it, including winning all the awards and everything else. As much fun as all that was, it wasn’t as much fun as sitting alone in a crummy office on Vine at 2 in the morning writing that screenplay.” At the Oscar ceremony she said, [...] "for everyone who wanted to see a happy ending for 'Thelma and Louise', for me this is it," [...] brandishing the statue high. After winning the Academy Awards for her best screenplay, she felt motivated enough to continue on with her career and express [...] "her feelings about the lack of female directors in Hollywood", not to mention that most of her career began because of her stand on women's rights. In an interview done by The Huffington Post, she addressed that adult women [...] "are a market that I feel is underserved in the entertainment population at large. I don’t see the kind of women represented that I know or that I’m attracted to. I really want to try to write more nuanced, less simplistic kind of stuff, and its hard {{to find a place to}} do that." ...|$|E

To achieve this objective, a uniform magnetic field is added in the axial direction of the QIT.|$|R
