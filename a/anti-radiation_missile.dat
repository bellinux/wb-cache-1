As of 2010, Saudi Arabia has signed several contracts for new weapon systems to be fitted to their Tornado and Typhoon fleets, {{such as the}} short range air-to-air IRIS-T missile, and the Brimstone and Storm Shadow cruise missiles.|$|E
5|$|Unguided {{air-to-ground}} weaponry includes rocket pods, gravity {{bombs and}} Matra Durandal anti-runway munitions. Precision-guided munitions such as LGBs and satellite-guided bombs are also {{compatible with the}} JF-17, as are other guided weapons such as anti-ship missiles and anti-radiation missiles. Pakistan planned to bring the Brazilian MAR-1 <b>anti-radiation</b> <b>missile</b> into service on its JF-17 fleet in 2014.|$|E
5|$|During the conflict, several {{claims of}} Iraqi air-to-air successes were made, {{including}} an Iraqi pilot, Khudai Hijab, who allegedly fired a Vympel R-27R missile from his MIG-29 and damaged a B-52G {{on the opening}} night of the Gulf War. However, the U.S. Air Force disputes this claim, stating the bomber was actually hit by friendly fire, an AGM-88 High-speed, <b>Anti-Radiation</b> <b>Missile</b> (HARM) that homed on the fire-control radar of the B-52's tail gun; the jet was subsequently renamed In HARM's Way. Shortly following this incident, General George Lee Butler announced that the gunner position on B-52 crews would be eliminated, and the gun turrets permanently deactivated, commencing on 1 October 1991.|$|E

5|$|Starting in the 1980s, the Stinger and AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air {{missiles}} and the AGM-122 Sidearm <b>anti-radiation</b> <b>missile</b> were evaluated for use upon the AH-64. The Stinger was initially selected; the U.S. Army was also considering the Starstreak air-to-air missile. External fuel tanks {{can also be}} carried on the stub wings to increase range and mission time. The stub-wing pylons have mounting points for maintenance access; these mountings {{can be used to}} secure externally personnel for emergency transportation. Stinger missiles are often used on non-U.S. Apaches, as foreign forces do not have as many air superiority aircraft to control the skies. The AH-64E initially lacked the ability to use the Stinger to make room for self-defense equipment, but the capability was re-added following a South Korean demand.|$|E
5|$|The {{response}} to {{the first generation of}} fixed installation surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) such as SA-2 and SA-3 was the development of the <b>anti-radiation</b> <b>missile</b> such as AGM-45 Shrike and other means to attack fixed SAM installations, as well as developing SEAD doctrines. The Soviet counter-response was the use of mobile SAMs such as SA-6 with intermittent use of radar. Thus, the SAM battery was only visible for a small period of time, during which it was also a significant threat to high-value Wild Weasel fighters. In 1982 Operation Mole Cricket 19 various means including UAVs and air-launched Samson decoys were used over suspected SAM areas to saturate enemy SAMs and to bait them to activate their radar systems, which were then attacked by anti-radiation missiles.|$|E

25|$|ALARM (Air Launched <b>Anti-Radiation</b> <b>Missile)</b> is a British <b>anti-radiation</b> <b>missile</b> {{designed}} {{primarily to}} destroy enemy radars {{for the purpose}} of Suppression of Enemy Air Defense (SEAD). It was used by the RAF and is still used by the Royal Saudi Air Force. The weapon was retired by the UK at the end of 2013.|$|E
25|$|In 1972, the Bendix Corporation {{was awarded}} a {{contract}} to develop an <b>anti-radiation</b> <b>missile</b> passive radar seeker to guide the Hound Dog missile to antennas transmitting radar signals. A Hound Dog with this radar seeker was test-flown in 1973, but never mass-produced.|$|E
25|$|The Kh-31 missile was {{developed}} by Zvezda-Strela in the Soviet Union starting in 1977 for service as a long-range anti-ship missile and <b>anti-radiation</b> <b>missile,</b> first being flown in 1982. Derived from the P-270 Moskit missile, the Kh-31 is conventional in shape, and has cruciform fins made from titanium, with a rocket-ramjet propulsion system providing thrust.|$|E
50|$|Israel and the US Air Force, in {{conjunction}} with the members of NATO, have developed significant tactics for air defence suppression. Dedicated weapons such as <b>anti-radiation</b> <b>missiles</b> and advanced electronics intelligence and electronic countermeasures platforms seek to suppress or negate the effectiveness of an opposing air-defence system. It is an arms race; as better jamming, countermeasures and anti-radiation weapons are developed, so are better SAM systems with ECCM capabilities and the ability to shoot down <b>anti-radiation</b> <b>missiles</b> and other munitions aimed at them or the targets they are defending.|$|R
50|$|Due {{to their}} {{dependence}} on target aircraft radar emissions, when used against fighter aircraft passive <b>anti-radiation</b> <b>missiles</b> are primarily limited to forward-aspect intercept geometry. For examples, see Vympel R-27, Brazo, and AIM-97 Seekbat.|$|R
50|$|The RC-135U Combat Sent is {{designed}} to collect technical intelligence on adversary radar emitter systems. Combat Sent data is collected to develop new or upgraded radar warning receivers, radar jammers, decoys, <b>anti-radiation</b> <b>missiles,</b> and training simulators.|$|R
25|$|The first air-to-air <b>anti-radiation</b> <b>missile</b> {{developed}} by the United States, the Brazo utilised the airframe of the existing AIM-7E Sparrow air-to-air missile, fitted with a new, Hughes-built passive radar seeker head {{developed by}} the Naval Electronics Center. The seeker was intended to detect and home on enemy radar emissions, such as those on interceptor and AWACS aircraft.|$|E
25|$|A further upgrade, {{disclosed}} in early 2003, was {{the integration of}} the ALARM <b>anti-radiation</b> <b>missile</b> to enable several Tornado ADVs to conduct Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) missions. The F3's existing radar warning receivers formed the basis of an Emission Location System (ELS), which can be employed to detect and locate operational radar systems in the aircraft's vicinity. These modified aircraft were re-designated Tornado EF3 and operated by No. 11 Squadron RAF.|$|E
25|$|The AGM-88E Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile (AARGM) is {{an upgrade}} to the AGM-88 High-speed <b>Anti-Radiation</b> <b>Missile</b> (HARM). The AARGM {{is the result}} of {{cooperation}} between the United States and Italy. It is produced by ATK. In September 2013, ATK delivered the 100th AARGM to the U.S. Navy. It will be initially integrated onto the FA-18C/D, FA-18E/F, EA-18G, and Tornado ECR aircraft and later on the F-35. The AGM-88E development program was proceeded on schedule and did not exceed its budget.|$|E
50|$|Pilots {{from the}} 23d {{were the first}} to employ AGM-88 High-Speed <b>Anti-Radiation</b> <b>Missiles</b> in combat. The squadron's efforts contributed to the peace process and the {{resulting}} Dayton Agreement, which ended more than four years of bloody conflict in the Balkans.|$|R
25|$|The F-8 Crusader is {{the only}} {{aircraft}} to have used the AIM-9C which is a radar-guided variant of the Sidewinder. When the Crusader retired, these missiles were converted to the AGM-122 Sidearm <b>anti-radiation</b> <b>missiles</b> used by United States attack helicopters to knock out enemy radars.|$|R
50|$|Air-to-air {{missiles}} deployed {{may include}} short-range air-to-air missiles {{such as the}} PL-8 and PL-9, medium-range radar-guided air-to-air missiles such as the PL-11 and PL-12, unguided and precision guided munitions such as laser-guided bombs, anti-ship missiles such as the YJ-9K and <b>anti-radiation</b> <b>missiles</b> such as the PJ-9.|$|R
25|$|The Ministry of Defence {{received}} {{bids for}} a new <b>anti-radiation</b> <b>missile</b> in late 1982; British Aerospace Dynamics offered ALARM while Texas Instruments teamed with Lucas Aerospace offered its HARM missile. Defence Secretary Michael Heseltine announced the selection of ALARM on 29 July 1983. The initial order was 750 missiles for the RAF. The selection process was controversial; the battle between the contractors was bitter, the Ministry of Defence favoured ALARM to retain UK industrial capabilities while the Treasury favoured the cheaper and proven HARM.|$|E
25|$|It {{was also}} the first Wild Weasel SEAD (air defense suppression) {{aircraft}} whose specially trained crews were tasked with locating and destroying enemy air defenses. Four F-100F Wild Weasel Is were fitted with an APR-25 vector radar homing and warning (RHAW) receiver, IR-133 panoramic receivers with greater detection range, and KA-60 panoramic cameras. The APR-25 could detect early-warning radars and emissions from SA-2 Guideline tracking and guidance systems. These aircraft deployed to Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand, in November 1965, began flying combat missions with the 388th Tactical Fighter Wing in December. They were joined by three more aircraft in February 1966. All Wild Weasel F-100Fs were eventually modified to fire the AGM-45 Shrike <b>anti-radiation</b> <b>missile.</b>|$|E
25|$|For {{even higher}} speeds, {{the company began}} experimenting with pulsejet systems {{immediately}} after the war, building two experimental designs, the RP-21 and RP-26. In response to a call for high-speed target drones from the newly formed US Air Force, in 1950 the company introduced the Radioplane Q-1, powered by a small pulsejet. An attempt to build a version with the Continental YJ69 turbojet failed to find orders, and the role {{was taken over by}} the Ryan Firebee Q-2. Only a few dozen Q-1's were produced in total. However, the jet-powered Q-1 was then used {{in the development of the}} GAM-67 Crossbow, an experimental long-range <b>anti-radiation</b> <b>missile.</b> In 1953 they began development of the RP-61, a supersonic jet-powered drone that was powered by a XJ81 engine and able to reach Mach 1.55. Several improved models followed, but only 25 were produced in total.|$|E
50|$|The {{system was}} {{deployed}} by Libya during the border dispute with Chad and proved a threat for French aircraft, however on January 7, 1987, these {{were successful in}} destroying an SA-6 radar site in the Faya Largeau area with SEPECAT Jaguars armed with Martel <b>anti-radiation</b> <b>missiles.</b>|$|R

50|$|Modernized {{variants}} {{of the aircraft}} can be equipped with <b>anti-radiation</b> <b>missiles</b> Kh-31, Kh-25MR or MPU (up to six units), anti-ship Kh-31A (up to six), air-to-surface class missiles Kh-29 and Kh-59 (up to three) or Kh-59M (up to two units), up to six precision bombs KAB-1500 or eight KAB-500 with television or laser-guidance. Maximum mass of payload is 9000 kg.|$|R
500|$|The F-105G {{incorporated}} {{a considerable amount}} of new SEAD-specific avionics, including an upgraded Radar Homing and Warning (RHAW) system which required a redesign of the wingtips. To free outboard hardpoints for additional weapons, the Westinghouse AN/ALQ-105 electronic countermeasures were permanently installed in two long blisters {{on the underside of the}} fuselage. Thirty aircraft were fitted with pylons to carry the AGM-78 Standard <b>anti-radiation</b> <b>missile.</b> On a typical mission, the F-105G carried two Shrikes on outboard pylons, a single Standard on an inboard pylon balanced by a [...] fuel tank on the other side, and a [...] centerline fuel tank.|$|E
500|$|The French Air Force took {{delivery}} of the first production Jaguar in 1973, one of an eventual 160 single-seat Jaguar As. For type conversion training, France also took 40 of the two-seat Jaguar E. While the Jaguar was capable of carrying a single AN-52 nuclear bomb, the French government did not assign any Jaguars {{for use in the}} Force de frappe, France's strategic nuclear deterrent; this task was carried out by the Dassault Mirage IV, and the later Mirage 2000-N. Nuclear armed Jaguars were instead assigned the [...] "Pre-Strategic" [...] role, to clear a path for the Strategic strike force. The AN-52 nuclear bomb was retired from service in September 1991, when the formerly nuclear-armed squadrons of Escadron de Chasse 7 then concentrated on conventional attack. French Jaguars also performed in the role of Electronic Counter Measures (ECM) aircraft, bearing the Martel <b>anti-radiation</b> <b>missile,</b> capable of staying airborne to suppress enemy defences {{for long periods of time}} through mid air refuelling.|$|E

25|$|The Bereznyak design bureau had {{developed}} the liquid-fuelled Kh-28 (AS-9 ‘Kyle’) and the KSR-5P <b>anti-radiation</b> <b>missiles.</b> They merged with Raduga in 1967, so Raduga {{was given the}} contract in the early 1970s to develop a solid-fuel successor to the Kh-28 to equip the new Su-24M 'Fencer-D' attack aircraft. Consequently, the project was initially designated the Kh-24, before becoming the Kh-58.|$|R
