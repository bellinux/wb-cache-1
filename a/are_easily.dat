5|$|Although {{there are}} many Cortinarius species {{with some degree of}} violet colour, C.violaceus and its close {{relatives}} <b>are</b> <b>easily</b> distinguished by their much darker purple colour. Cortinarius iodes of the southeastern United States has a slimy purple cap and paler violet stipe. The other species in the section Cortinarius are dark purple and superficially similar, but can be differentiated based on host and geography as they do not occur in the same locations as C. violaceus. Certain Leptonia species in northwestern North America, including L. carnea and L. nigroviolacea, have a similar color, but <b>are</b> <b>easily</b> differentiated due to their pink spore print.|$|E
5|$|Beagles are {{intelligent}} but, as {{a result}} of being bred for the long chase, are single-minded and determined, which can make them hard to train. They can be difficult to recall once they have picked up a scent, and <b>are</b> <b>easily</b> distracted by smells around them. They do not generally feature in obedience trials; while they are alert, respond well to food-reward training, and are eager to please, they <b>are</b> <b>easily</b> bored or distracted. They are ranked 72nd in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, as Coren places them among the group with the lowest degree of working/obedience intelligence. Coren's scale, however, does not assess understanding, independence, or creativity.|$|E

Gastroesophageal reflux may cause arching {{of the back}} and twisting of the {{head to the side}} in infants, which may be mistaken for tonic-clonic seizures.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{engineering}} {{is now a}} routine research tool with model organisms.

5|$|Many {{methods of}} {{decreasing}} the response time of ALFs have been developed. Even {{in the late}} 1980s, certain gases were used to catalyze the decay of the electrons of the vapor cell. In 1989, Eric Korevaar had developed his Fast ALF design which detected emitted fluorescence without photosensitive plates. With such methods employed, gigahertz frequencies <b>are</b> <b>easily</b> attainable.|$|E
5|$|Microorganisms are {{essential}} tools in biotechnology, biochemistry, genetics, and molecular biology. The yeasts brewer's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) are important model organisms in science, {{since they are}} simple eukaryotes that can be grown rapidly in large numbers and <b>are</b> <b>easily</b> manipulated. They are particularly valuable in genetics, genomics and proteomics, for example in protein production.|$|E

5|$|The Visitor Center is {{near the}} monument's only entrance. Various {{displays}} and publications along with a short film about the geology of the area help to orient visitors.

5|$|This {{behavior}} is exploited in the Mond process for purifying nickel, as described above. The related nickel(0) complex bis(cyclooctadiene)nickel(0) {{is a useful}} catalyst in organonickel chemistry because the cyclooctadiene (or cod) ligands <b>are</b> <b>easily</b> displaced.|$|E
5|$|A pond {{is a body}} of {{standing}} water, either natural or man-made, that is usually smaller than a lake. A wide variety of man-made bodies of water are classified as ponds, including water gardens designed for aesthetic ornamentation, fish ponds designed for commercial fish breeding, and solar ponds designed to store thermal energy. Ponds and lakes are distinguished from streams via current speed. While currents in streams <b>are</b> <b>easily</b> observed, ponds and lakes possess thermally driven micro-currents and moderate wind driven currents. These features distinguish a pond from many other aquatic terrain features, such as stream pools and tide pools.|$|E
50|$|Eaton's Corrasable Bond is a trademarked {{name for}} a brand of {{erasable}} typing paper. Erasable paper has a glazed or coated surface which is almost invisible, <b>is</b> <b>easily</b> removed by friction, and accepts typewriter ink fairly well. Removing the coating removes the ink on top of it, so mistakes can <b>be</b> <b>easily</b> erased once. After erasure, the correction is typed onto an unprotected paper surface and cannot <b>be</b> <b>easily</b> erased a second time.|$|R

5|$|Actinium reacts rapidly {{with oxygen}} and {{moisture}} in air forming a white coating of actinium oxide that impedes further oxidation. As with most lanthanides and actinides, actinium {{exists in the}} oxidation state +3, and the Ac3+ ions are colorless in solutions. The oxidation state +3 originates from the 6d17s2 electronic configuration of actinium, with three valence electrons that <b>are</b> <b>easily</b> donated to give the stable closed-shell structure of the noble gas radon. The rare oxidation state +2 is only known for actinium dihydride (AcH2); even this may in reality be an electride compound like its lighter congener LaH2.|$|E
5|$|Albatrosses {{are popular}} birds for birdwatchers and their colonies are popular {{destinations}} for ecotourists. Regular birdwatching trips are {{taken out of}} many coastal towns and cities, like Monterey, Dunedin, Kaikoura, Wollongong, Sydney, Port Fairy, Hobart and Cape Town, to see pelagic seabirds. Albatrosses <b>are</b> <b>easily</b> attracted to these sightseeing boats by the deployment of fish oil and burley into the sea. Visits to colonies can be very popular: the northern royal albatross colony at Taiaroa Head in Dunedin, New Zealand, attracts 40,000 visitors a year, and more isolated colonies are regular attractions on cruises to subantarctic islands.|$|E
5|$|Ants are eusocial insects of {{the family}} Formicidae and, along with the related wasps and bees, belong to the order Hymenoptera. Ants evolved from wasp-like {{ancestors}} in the Cretaceous period, about 99 million years ago, and diversified after the rise of flowering plants. More than 12,500 of an estimated total of 22,000 species have been classified. They <b>are</b> <b>easily</b> identified by their elbowed antennae and the distinctive node-like structure that forms their slender waists.|$|E

5|$|Ascocoryne cylichnium, {{another small}} and {{gelatinous}} violet-colored species, has apothecia {{that are more}} often cup-shaped, and has larger spores—20–24 by 5.5–6µm. Because of its resemblance to the jelly fungi, A.sarcoides has been mistaken for the basidiomycete species Auricularia auricula and Tremella foliacea. T.foliacea is larger, brown, and leafy in appearance. Auricularia auricula is also larger, typically brown, is disc- or ear-shaped, with a ribbed undersurface. Microscopically, Tremella foliacea and Auricularia auricula <b>are</b> <b>easily</b> distinguished from A.sarcoides {{by the presence of}} basidia (rather than asci).|$|E
5|$|Because the feats the Baron {{describes}} are overtly implausible, they <b>are</b> <b>easily</b> {{recognizable as}} fiction, {{with a strong}} implication that the Baron is a liar. Whether he expects his audience to believe him varies from version to version; in Raspe's original 1785 text, he simply narrates his stories without further comment, but in the later extended versions he is insistent that he is telling the truth. In any case, the Baron appears to believe every word of his own stories, no matter how internally inconsistent they become, and he usually appears tolerantly indifferent to any disbelief he encounters in others.|$|E
5|$|Females <b>are</b> <b>easily</b> {{distinguished}} from males {{as they have}} a narrower and less domed head, narrower and proportionally longer beak, smaller cere and nostrils, more slender and pinkish grey legs and feet, and proportionally longer tail. While their plumage colour is not {{very different from that}} of the male, the toning is more subtle, with less yellow and mottling. They tend to resist more and be more aggressive than the male when handled. Nesting females also have a brood patch on the bare skin of the belly.|$|E
30|$|The {{limitations}} {{regarding the}} non-standardized radiographs {{at the final}} examinations {{in the present study}} imply that results must be interpreted with care.
