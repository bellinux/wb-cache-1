5|$|A large {{subdivision}} near Route30 sustained minor {{roof and}} tree damage, which was rated as EF0intensity. However, as the tornado was intensifying through the neighborhood, three homes to the subdivision's east suffered more considerable roof and siding damage and was assigned an EF1damage intensity rating. The tornado then crossed Missouri Route 141, where it blew a Honda CR-V into a highway barrier; {{the driver of}} the vehicle suffered critical injuries and died eleven days later from those injuries. After crossing the highway, a number of buildings were damaged including a church, elementary school, and parsonage. Damage in this area was rated as EF2 due to the partial debarking of <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> <b>tree.</b> Minor tree damage occurred as the tornado moved through Fenton Park and tracked over the Meramec River.|$|E
5|$|Reaching {{the open}} fields again, the 21st was ordered by Maj. Gen. Philip Kearny {{to fill a}} hole {{in the center of the}} Union line. As the 21st advanced, Kearny rode out in front of the regiment, strenuously urging them to hurry, and refuting {{warnings}} that Confederates were close by. Kearny was killed by a volley from a force of Confederates concealed just inside <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> <b>tree</b> line. Now in very close range to the enemy, a tense standoff ensued with leveled muskets as the 21st and the Confederate regiment each demanded the surrender of the other. Finally, the Confederate regiment charged on the 21st. It was the first time and last time, according to the regimental historian, that the 21st gave wounds with the bayonet. The hand-to-hand fighting was severe and great confusion resulted. Col. Clark was separated from the unit when most of the men around him were killed and he found himself lost in the Virginia countryside for four days before finding the unit again. This resulted in the mistaken printing of his obituary in Amherst.|$|E
5|$|All puzzles {{are based}} on a {{mechanic}} of tracing a path through a maze-like route from a starting point, represented as a circle, to a goal point, represented as a line segment with a rounded end, without crossing one's path. The goal of these puzzles is not always to simply complete the maze but to find the right path that completes the puzzle correctly. Mazes may have several starting points and goals; the player may have to find the right starting point that can complete the maze, or they may {{have to figure out how}} to reach a specific end point to trigger an event in the surrounding environment such as moving a platform. The puzzles include a symbolic language that denotes the mechanics for that maze. For example, puzzles that present mazes with black and white squares in the spaces between traceable paths require the player to find a path through the maze that separates these squares by color. Other puzzles require the player to use the environment to determine how to solve the puzzle, such as studying <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> <b>tree</b> with branches that mimic the puzzle, or by observing symbols on nearby floors and walls that align with the puzzle's configuration. The puzzles within each island section {{are based on}} common mechanic, often with a sequence of puzzles appearing early in each section that are designed to help the player identify and understand the mechanic and meaning of the symbols. Later puzzles combine two or more different mechanics into the same puzzle using the consistent symbolic language.|$|E
25|$|The hanging {{was usually}} {{performed}} by short drop and in public. The gallows were usually either <b>a</b> stout <b>nearby</b> <b>tree</b> branch, as {{in case of}} Lukkarinen, or a makeshift gallows constructed for the purpose.|$|R
50|$|Pilot Branch {{was named}} for <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> tract of <b>trees</b> which stood {{as a point of}} {{navigation}} to pioneers.|$|R
50|$|Unlike most plants, it {{does not}} contain chlorophyll; it is a myco-heterotroph, getting its food through {{parasitism}} upon fungi rather than photosynthesis. These fungi form <b>a</b> mycorrhiza with <b>nearby</b> <b>tree</b> species.|$|R

25|$|All {{three men}} {{were taken by}} train to jail. However, on July 10, 1868, three miles outside Seymour, Indiana, the prisoners were taken off the train, and hanged by the neck from <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> <b>tree</b> {{by a group of}} masked men calling itself the Jackson County Vigilance Committee. Three other gang members, Henry Jerrell, Frank Sparks, and John Moore, were {{captured}} shortly after in Illinois and returned to Seymour. In a grisly repeat, they too fell into the hands of vigilantes and were hanged from the same tree. The site became known as Hangman Crossing, Indiana.|$|E
25|$|At the {{proposed}} site, located approximately 26 leguas (Spanish Leagues) north of San Diego, 18 leagues south of San Gabriel, {{and half a}} league from the Pacific Ocean, an enramada (arbor) was constructed, two bronze bells were hung from the branch of <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> <b>tree,</b> and a wooden cross was erected. The grounds were consecrated by Fermín Lasuén of Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo on October 30, 1775 (the {{last day of the}} octave after the feast of San Juan Capistrano), near an Indian settlement named Sajavit; thus, La Misión de San Juan Capistrano de Sajavit was founded.|$|E
50|$|Pilot Grove Township was {{organized}} in 1856, and named from <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> grove of <b>trees</b> which stood as a landmark to pioneer travelers.|$|R
50|$|The last bout {{between the}} two finalists was told to last through the night as neither was able to defeat the other. They were found dead the next morning, their bodies still intertwined. They were buried {{underneath}} <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> fig <b>tree,</b> whereupon their comrades headed to conquer Edirne.|$|R
50|$|Like {{all members}} of the subfamily, Monotropsis odorata does not contain chlorophyll; it is a myco-heterotroph, getting its food through {{parasitism}} upon fungi rather than photosynthesis. These fungi form <b>a</b> mycorrhiza with <b>nearby</b> <b>tree</b> species.|$|R
25|$|Another {{technique}} {{that was used}} in combining live actors and stop-motion animation was rear-screen projection. The actor would have a translucent screen behind him where a projector would project footage onto the back of the translucent screen. The translucent screen was developed by Sidney Saunders and Fred Jackman, who received a Special Achievement Oscar. It was used in the famous scene where Kong and the Tyrannosaurus fight while Ann watches from the branches of <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> <b>tree.</b> The stop-motion animation was filmed first. Fay Wray then spent a twenty-two hour period sitting in a fake tree acting out her observation of the battle, which was projected onto the translucent screen while the camera filmed her witnessing the projected stop-motion battle. She was sore for days after the shoot. The same process was also used for the scene where sailors from the Venture kill a Stegosaurus.|$|E
25|$|On July 1, 2008, {{four more}} protesters left the grove, leaving three protesters {{still in the}} trees. At 11:00 pm three of the tree-sitters were seen on the ground, {{at which point the}} UCPD arrested one of them for {{trespassing}} and violating a court order, causing the other two to take refuge in <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> <b>tree.</b> Assistant Police Chief Mitch Celaya talked to the two tree-sitters for a couple of hours, at which point they agreed to come down. One of the protesters who was talked down did so with the condition that they would be allowed to make a video statement. Another protester came down later in the day after indicating that she might have an undetermined medical condition that would require treatment. RunningWolf said that she collapsed three times once she was on the ground. RunningWolf blamed the conditions on the long exposure to the elements, lack of food and water, and lack of sleep due to the lights the police set up surrounding the grove and the noise from the generators needed to power them. The university said they were happy that their strategy to get the tree-sitters to leave the grove was working. RunningWolf said that the remaining protesters would remain in the trees until at least 2008-07-17, when Judge Miller was expected to make a final ruling.|$|E
25|$|Four {{days after}} the {{discovery}} of Mixer's body, on March 25, a surveyor discovered the nude, mutilated body of a teenage girl behind a vacant house on a remote, rural section of Earhart Road, {{just a few hundred}} yards from where the body of Joan Schell had been discovered eight months previous. Investigators called to the crime scene noted a dramatic increase in the savagery exhibited against the victim, with one investigator describing the injuries inflicted upon the victim as being the worst he had seen in 30 years of police work. A subsequent autopsy revealed the victim had died of numerous fractures covering one-third of her skull and one side of her face, all of which had been inflicted with a heavy blunt instrument. These injuries had been inflicted after the victim had been extensively beaten and tortured: her killer had placed a section of her own shirt into her trachea to muffle her screams as she received extensive blunt force trauma to the face, head and body, including several deep lacerations believed to have been inflicted with a leather strap. Welt marks upon the chest and shoulders indicated the killer had also used restraints to hold the victim prone as he whipped her torso and upper legs with a leather belt before tearing a branch from <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> <b>tree</b> and inserting this instrument eight inches into her vagina. Blood spatterings and churned soil close to the crime scene indicated she had been beaten close to where her body was discovered, and that she may have attempted to escape her attacker.|$|E

50|$|There was {{a pilgrimage}} chapel of Our Lady of Charity near St.-Laurent-sur-La-Plaine which was {{destroyed}} by order of the French revolutionary government in 1791. Shortly afterward, the Virgin Mary {{was reported to be}} seen on the ruined altar and in <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> oak <b>tree.</b> This set off more pilgrimages and became part of the unrest leading up to the War in the Vendee.|$|R
50|$|Another John Hamilton of Barncluith was Sheriff of the Lower Ward of Lanarkshire from {{shortly after}} 1707. He {{is said to}} have held his court within the {{pavilion}} in the terrace garden, and to have carried out executions at <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> oak <b>tree.</b> In the 1730s, the involvement of the architect William Adam in works at Barncluith is suggested by surviving correspondence with his clerk of works.|$|R
500|$|Meanwhile, Mowgli has {{encountered}} Kaa once again, {{but thanks to}} the unwitting intervention of the suspicious Shere Khan, Mowgli escapes. As a storm gathers, a depressed Mowgli encounters a group of friendly vultures who accept Mowgli as a fellow outcast. Shere Khan appears shortly after, scaring off the vultures and confronting Mowgli. Baloo rushes to the rescue and tries to keep Shere Khan away from Mowgli, but is injured. [...] When lightning strikes <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> <b>tree</b> and sets it ablaze, the vultures swoop in to distract Shere Khan while Mowgli gathers flaming branches and ties them to Shere Khan's tail. Terrified of fire, the tiger panics and runs off.|$|E
500|$|Sawyer gives Miles a [...] "restraining order" [...] to {{keep him}} away from Claire as they travel to the survivors' beach camp with Claire's infant son, Aaron. [...] On their way, Miles discovers the {{partially}} buried bodies of Danielle Rousseau (Mira Furlan) and Karl (Blake Bashoff). They encounter Frank Lapidus (Jeff Fahey), who saves their lives by instructing them to hide from a nearby Martin Keamy (Kevin Durand) and the other mercenaries, who {{are on their way}} back to the helicopter to return to the freighter Kahana. [...] At night, Miles watches Claire as she leaves with her deceased father, Christian. [...] Sawyer awakes the next morning to find Aaron alone in <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> <b>tree</b> and calls out for Claire with no response.|$|E
500|$|Danny Daniels choreographed {{the opening}} music number [...] "Anything Goes". Capshaw learned {{to sing in}} Mandarin and took tap dance lessons. However the dress was fitted so tightly that Capshaw {{was not able to}} dance in it. Made by Barbara Matera out of {{original}} 1920s and 1930s beads, the dress was one of a kind. The opening dance number was actually the last scene to be shot, but the dress did feature in some earlier location shots in Sri Lanka, drying on <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> <b>tree.</b> Unfortunately an elephant had started to eat it, tearing the whole back of the dress. Consequently, some emergency repair work had to be done by Matera with what remained of the original beads, and it was costume designer Anthony Powell who had to fill in the insurance forms. As to the reason for damage, he had no option but to put [...] "dress eaten by elephant".|$|E
50|$|The Treetops was rebuilt in 1957 on <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> {{chestnut}} <b>tree</b> {{overlooking the}} same waterhole and salt lick near the elephant migration pathway to Mount Kenya, and {{has grown to}} about 50 rooms, with the hotel being built on additional stilt support. It rises {{straight out of the}} ground on stilts and has four decks and a rooftop viewing platform. The accommodation is compact and cosy, consisting of 50 rooms.|$|R
60|$|The {{evening meal}} was soon finished, {{and the boys}} took a stroll around the grounds. They were just {{on the point of}} {{retiring}} when Dick drew his brothers' attention to a figure that was stealing through <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> grove of <b>trees.</b>|$|R
50|$|South Luangwa National Park {{is renowned}} for its {{prolific}} game, including lion, leopard, giraffe, buffalo, antelope, elephants, and crocodile. From October to December, a small herd of elephants regularly wander right through the lobby, lured by fruit from <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> Wild Mango <b>tree.</b>|$|R
500|$|The jumping prowess of the indriids {{have been}} well {{documented}} and are popular among ecotourists visiting Madagascar. Using their long, powerful back legs, they catapult themselves {{into the air and}} land in an upright posture on <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> <b>tree,</b> with both hands and feet tightly gripping the trunk. Indriids can leap up to 10m (33ft) rapidly from tree trunk to tree trunk, an ability referred to as [...] "ricochetal leaping". Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi) manages to do this in the spiny forests of southern Madagascar. It is unknown how it avoids impaling its palms on the thorn-covered trunks of large plants such as Alluaudia. When distances between trees are too great, sifakas will descend to the ground and cross distances more than 100m (330ft) by standing upright and hopping sideways with the arms held to the side and waving up and down from chest to head height, presumably for balance. This is sometimes described as a [...] "dance-hop".|$|E
500|$|Nearly {{half the}} tributes are {{killed in the}} first day of the Games, {{fighting}} over the weapons and supplies strewn around their starting point. Katniss nearly dies, ignoring Haymitch's advice to flee immediately. She uses her well-practiced hunting and survival skills to hide in the woods. A few days later, an artificial fire drives Katniss toward the others. She is spotted and treed by the [...] "Careers" [...] (tributes from the richer, loyal districts who have trained intensively for the Games) ... and Peeta, who seems to have allied with them. Rue is hiding in <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> <b>tree.</b> Silently, she directs Katniss's attention to a trackerjacker nest. Katniss saws through the branch holding the nest, sending it plummeting down. The venom of the flying insects kills one girl and drives the others away. However, Katniss is stung herself and begins hallucinating. Peeta returns, but instead of killing her, he tells her to run away.|$|E
500|$|Despite the victory, the {{remaining}} royalist forces {{could not be}} pursued as the column led by Justo Bermúdez had moved further than calculated for. This delayed the meeting with San Martín's column whose horse was killed by enemy fire, leaving with his leg trapped under the corpse of the animal. These factors led to the columns not meeting up and allowed many royalists to escape. A royalist, probably Zabala himself, attempted to kill San Martín while he was trapped under his dead horse where he suffered a saber injury to his face, and a bullet wound to his arm. Juan Bautista Cabral and Juan Bautista Baigorria intervened and saved San Martín's life. Cabral was mortally wounded during the rescue and San Martín reported that after Cabral was hit he said [...] "I die happy, we have defeated the enemy". The exact moment this was said is unclear as the word [...] "after" [...] could have meant immediately after; during the ongoing battle; or some hours later during Cabral's agonising decline. San Martín wrote the battle report under <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> <b>tree.</b> Fray Herminio Gaitán considers that Cabral's last words {{would have been in}} the Guaraní language, his first language, and that as San Martín also spoke Guaraní he would have translated them for the battle report.|$|E
50|$|One of Sir Duncan's castles was Finlarig Castle, {{built in}} 1629. There is a pit in the courtyard, which {{can still be}} seen, where nobles {{were taken from the}} castle dungeons, through an {{underground}} passage, to be beheaded under the watchful gaze of Sir Duncan's men. Commoners were hanged from <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> oak <b>tree.</b> The beheading axe was later put on display at Taymouth Castle, until it was finally turned into a hotel in 1922.|$|R
40|$|While {{living in}} Bedele, Illubabor, Ethiopia {{a few years}} back (16 September 1989) we came across an {{incident}} worth reporting after more than 20 years. At about 14 : 00 our attention was drawn to a group of four Thick-billed Ravens Corvus crassirostris, normally a noisy species, but the present ones appeared to be unusually agitated in <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> acacia <b>tree.</b> <b>As</b> we approached, a Harrier Hawk Polyboroides radiatus flew off with two ravens in close pursuit and all disappeared from sight, but the ravens returned after about two minutes. Almost immediately afterwards, {{what appeared to be a}} Wahlberg’s Eagle Aquila wahlbergi also flew away with another two ravens in pursuit. It landed in <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> dead <b>tree,</b> and was thereafter ignored by the ravens. Although two possible candidates for the consternation had gone, the agitated calling continued unabated and was increased through the arrival of a pair of vociferous Cape Rooks Corvus capensis. It was now obvious that there was some other cause for the mobbing behaviour of the ravens. On closer approach we found a fully grown Verreaux’s Eagle Owl Bubo lacteus perched high in the tree being closel...|$|R
50|$|Near the Castle's north {{wall is a}} stone-lined pit which, {{legend has}} it, was used for {{beheading}} prisoners of noble blood. Commoners were hanged on <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> oak <b>tree.</b> Near the Castle are {{the remnants of the}} Breadalbane Mausoleum, a mock-Tudor chapel erected in 1829 on the site of an earlier chapel and burial place founded in 1523 by an ancestor of the Earls of Breadalbane, Sir Colin Campbell. Allowed to decay over many years, this brick-built building has almost completely collapsed.|$|R
500|$|... 2 Platoon was {{in trouble}} and the Australians were forced to fight hard in order to survive, with {{numerous}} acts of heroism on both sides. Repeatedly exposing himself to the fire to throw grenades and to direct his platoon's fire, Ross dragged two of his wounded men to safety during the fighting and despite being wounded in the leg by shrapnel he refused to be treated until the other wounded had received first aid. Meanwhile, Private Dennis Bathersby, although wounded in the right arm, remained behind his M60 throwing two grenades with his left arm and only withdrawing in order to drag another wounded Australian to safety. Finally, after his right arm went numb, Ross ordered Bathersby to hand over his machine-gun and he was evacuated to the rear. Elsewhere, Private Keith Downward, one of the forward scouts, after edging forward to within [...] then single handedly charged one of the Viet Cong machine-guns, killing the operator and capturing the weapon before then dragging a wounded Australian soldier out of danger despite himself being wounded. Amid the chaos, a wasp nest in <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> <b>tree</b> was disturbed, {{and a number of}} Australians were so badly stung that they were incapacitated and also needed to be evacuated.|$|E
500|$|In Kemper County, a 3,000ft2 (280m2) mini-mart {{was damaged}} beyond repair. Eleven people sought refuge inside the building's {{bathroom}} when the tornado struck; all escaped without injuries. Along the Kemper-Winston County kine, EF5 damage occurred as extremely deep ground scouring took place again and asphalt was ripped from roads. On Green Road, a double-wide mobile home, {{anchored to the}} ground, was lofted [...] and obliterated when it landed in <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> <b>tree</b> line; debris from the home was scattered hundreds of yards farther. The survey team {{found no evidence of}} it having bounced or rolled from where it was picked up to where it impacted the tree line. All three occupants were killed, the sole fatalities from this tornado. Nearby, the tornado weakened to EF3 strength as two brick homes were destroyed with barely any interior walls left standing; two people sustained serious injuries. A well-built frame wood home was nearly swept clean off its foundation and two trailers were destroyed. Cars were hurled hundreds of yards, often bouncing along the way, and some were rendered almost unrecognizable and were wrapped around trees. Continuing through southeastern Winston County, the tornado weakened slightly to EF2 strength but continued to produce extensive tree and property damage. As it crossed Central McDonald Road, it destroyed a single-wide mobile home and leveled a nearby grove of pine trees.|$|E

5000|$|Saughall Windmill is more {{commonly}} known as Gibbet Mill {{and is now a}} private residence. Situated some distance outside the village, this name is likely derived from some time during the eighteenth century. It was the location of the murder of a farm labourer by two fellow workers after a disagreement over earnings near the mill.
