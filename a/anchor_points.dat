5|$|An implant {{supported}} bridge (or fixed denture) is a {{group of}} teeth secured to dental implants so the prosthetic cannot be removed by the user. Bridges typically connect to more than one implant and may also connect to teeth as <b>anchor</b> <b>points.</b> Typically the number of teeth will outnumber the <b>anchor</b> <b>points</b> with the teeth that are directly over the implants referred to as abutments and those between abutments referred to as pontics. Implant supported bridges attach to implant abutments {{in the same way as}} a single tooth implant replacement. A fixed bridge may replace as few as two teeth (also known as a fixed partial denture) and may extend to replace an entire arch of teeth (also known as a fixed full denture). In both cases, the prosthesis is said to be fixed because it cannot be removed by the denture wearer.|$|E
5|$|Early on, Lull {{postulated}} that the frills may {{have served as}} <b>anchor</b> <b>points</b> for the jaw muscles to aid chewing by allowing increased size and thus power for the muscles. This has been put forward by other authors over the years, but later studies do not find evidence of large muscle attachments on the frill bones.|$|E
5|$|Another {{structure}} at {{the complex}} {{is a small}} signal house, which was constructed as a flag house for the timber flagstaff, both constructed with the original structures in 1903. The flag house was constructed to match the lighthouse, from precast concrete blocks, rendered walls, with the same plinth and deep ashlar coursing. The roof is made of concrete in a shallow hipped form, {{in contrast to the}} concrete dome proposed in the original drawings. The flag locker now houses maritime signal flags. The timber flagstaff was removed at an unknown date, and what remains of it are a concrete and steel base, a concrete apron, and four concrete and iron <b>anchor</b> <b>points.</b>|$|E

5|$|Early in the 20th century, {{paleontologist}} R. S. Lull {{proposed that}} the frills of ceratopsian dinosaurs acted as <b>anchor</b> <b>points</b> for their jaw muscles. He later noted that for Styracosaurus, the spikes would have given it a formidable appearance. In 1996, Dodson supported the idea of muscle attachments in part and created detailed diagrams of possible muscle attachments in the frills of Styracosaurus and Chasmosaurus, but did not subscribe {{to the idea that}} they completely filled in the fenestrae. C.A. Forster, however, found no evidence of large muscle attachments on the frill bones.|$|E
5|$|Epsilon Eridani has an {{estimated}} mass of 0.82 solar masses and a radius of 0.74 solar radii. It shines with a luminosity of only 0.34 solar luminosities. The estimated effective temperature is 5,084K. With a stellar classification of K2V, {{it is the}} second-nearest K-type main-sequence star (after Alpha Centauri B). Since 1943 the spectrum of Epsilon Eridani has served {{as one of the}} stable <b>anchor</b> <b>points</b> by which other stars are classified. Its metallicity, the fraction of elements heavier than helium, is slightly lower than the Sun's. In Epsilon Eridani's chromosphere, a region of the outer atmosphere just above the light emitting photosphere, the abundance of iron is estimated at 74% of the Sun's value. The proportion of lithium in the atmosphere is five times less than that in the Sun.|$|E
5|$|In 1860 the Clifton Bridge Company {{was set up}} {{to oversee}} the final stages of {{completion}} and manage the operation of the bridge. They paid £50 each year to the trustees who gradually purchased the shares in the company. The revenues from tolls were minimal initially as there was not much traffic; however, this increased after 1920 with greater car ownership. In 1949 the trustees purchased all the outstanding shares and debentures. The bridge is managed by a charitable trust, originally formed by the Society of Merchant Venturers following Vick's bequest. The trust was authorised to manage the bridge and collect tolls by Acts of Parliament in 1952, 1980 and 1986. A toll of £0.50 has been levied on vehicles since 2007, but the £0.05 toll that the Act allows for cyclists or pedestrians is not collected. Human toll collectors were replaced by automated machines in 1975. The tolls are used to pay for the upkeep of the bridge, including the strengthening of the chain <b>anchor</b> <b>points,</b> which was done in 1925 and 1939, and regular painting and maintenance, which is carried out from a motorised cradle slung beneath the deck. By 2008 over 4 million vehicles crossed the bridge each year.|$|E
40|$|The {{spatially}} resolved chemiluminescence at {{the flame}} front and <b>anchor</b> <b>point</b> of a laminar premixed propane/air flame {{was measured in}} this study. The flame front structure, <b>anchor</b> <b>point</b> location, and local equivalence ratio were examined for different values of the equivalence ratio f ranging from 0. 9 to 1. 5 using the chemiluminescence spectra. Local point-measurements of the chemiluminescence were obtained using a developed Cassegrain optics system, which had a spatial resolution of d = 0. 08 mm and L = 0. 6 mm, sufficient to measure the detailed location of the <b>anchor</b> <b>point</b> and the flame front shape. The <b>anchor</b> <b>point</b> was not in the same location for different values of f. The lower <b>anchor</b> <b>point</b> was located 0. 3 mm above the rim and at a radial distance of 6. 8 mm when f = 1. 0, 1. 1, and 1. 2, and the <b>anchor</b> <b>point</b> location trace was a V shape. The equivalence ratio of the <b>anchor</b> <b>point</b> was calculated from the relationship of the OH*/CH * intensity and the local equivalence ratio, and the measured value was constant for different values of f. The detailed OH * and CH* spectra demonstrated that the chemistry at the <b>anchor</b> <b>point</b> was dominated by the same processes for different equivalence ratios. The local equivalence ratio at the <b>anchor</b> <b>point</b> was between 0. 7 and 0. 8 for all experimental conditions. The temperature at the <b>anchor</b> <b>point</b> was estimated using the detailed OH * R and P branch intensity ratio used for plasma diagnostics. The results indicate that the temperature {{at the flame front}} was relatively constant, although the temperature at the <b>anchor</b> <b>point</b> showed remarkable changes that could be predicted from the heat loss...|$|R
50|$|<b>Anchor</b> <b>Point</b> {{was first}} settled by Robert Bartlett, a British seaman, and his nephew Robert Genge, both from Yeovil, Somerset, England in 1740. They used the cove {{as a base}} for fishing and fur hunting from <b>Anchor</b> <b>Point</b> to Bartlett's Harbour in the late 18th century. Robert Bartlett {{eventually}} returned to England while Robert Genge was joined by his brother Abram, who employed men from England seasonally to sell his furs and fish to American vessels. Trapping, salmon fishing and sealing were very important industries of <b>Anchor</b> <b>Point</b> in the 19th century. His descendant, William Genge, was the first Waymaster in 1885. By the 1850s, <b>Anchor</b> <b>Point</b> was established as a commercial center for fur trading and fishing on the St. Barbe coast. The land around <b>Anchor</b> <b>Point</b> was also very productive with excellent pasture which led to extensive cultivation of the land and the raising of livestock.|$|R

25|$|Simul-rappelling or {{simultaneously}} rappelling — {{advanced technique}} where two climbers {{at the same}} time descend the same rope, or two ropes tied together, and one climber’s weight counterbalances the other. Generally the technique is considered less safe than the regular repelling; however, it’s useful in case of emergencies, or for rapping off opposite sides of a fin or spire where there are no <b>anchor</b> <b>points,</b> which is common in places like the Needles of South Dakota’s Black Hills.|$|E

25|$|As {{a bundle}} is laid down, it was {{initially}} supported by supports {{mounted on the}} catwalk, then both ends were attached and the cable is tensioned at the eastern <b>anchor</b> <b>points.</b> As with a conventional cable suspension span, all of the tensioned bundles were then compressed into a circular shape and protected with a circular wrap of wire. Saddles for suspender cables were added and suspender cables placed and tensioned. The suspender cable tensioning lifted the span from its supporting falsework.|$|E
25|$|The {{overhead}} line equipment {{depends on the}} location. If the tracks are close together, central poles with 'steady' arms on each side are used. If the tracks are further apart, poles on either side with span wire are used. With aesthetics in mind a minimum number of traction poles are used and whenever possible the wire is anchored onto neighbouring buildings. Supertram, Sheffield City Council and landlords were in talks to try and hide <b>anchor</b> <b>points</b> {{as much as possible}} and blend them into the structures.|$|E
25|$|Anti-fouling is {{the process}} of {{preventing}} accumulations from forming. In industrial processes, bio-dispersants can be used to control biofouling. In less controlled environments, organisms are killed or repelled with coatings using biocides, thermal treatments, or pulses of energy. Nontoxic mechanical strategies that prevent organisms from attaching include choosing a material or coating with a slippery surface, creation of an ultra-low fouling surface with the use of zwitterions, or creation of nanoscale surface topologies similar to the skin of sharks and dolphins which only offer poor <b>anchor</b> <b>points.</b>|$|E

50|$|A load-sharing (or load-distributing) anchor is {{a system}} {{consisting}} {{of two or more}} individual anchors which join together at a main <b>anchor</b> <b>point</b> to form an anchoring system. This configuration is a way to introduce redundancy and increase strength, typically for a belay anchor. If assembled correctly, the load will be distributed to each individual anchor, rather than placing all the load on a single <b>anchor</b> <b>point.</b> This decreases the chance that any single <b>anchor</b> <b>point</b> will fail, and, if a point does fail, the other(s) should still be able to hold.|$|R

If the <b>anchor</b> <b>point</b> is 50%,50% and the anchor ID is 4 the window will expand equally in all directions {{from the center of}} the caption area.|$|R
25|$|Lead {{climbing}} is a climbing technique. The lead climber ascends {{with the}} rope passing through intermittent anchors that are below them, {{rather than through}} a top anchor, as in a top-roped climb. A partner belays from below the lead climber, by feeding out enough rope to allow upward progression without undue slack. As the leader progresses he or she clips the rope into, using a runner and carabiners, intermediate points of protection such as active cams, or passive protection such as nuts; this limits {{the length of a}} potential fall. The leader also may clip into pre-placed bolts. Indoor gyms might have short runners pre-attached to fixed <b>anchor</b> <b>points</b> in the wall.|$|E
25|$|Evidence for {{feathered}} oviraptorosaurs {{exists in}} several forms. Most directly, four species of primitive oviraptorosaurs (in the genera Caudipteryx, Protarchaeopteryx, and Similicaudipteryx) {{have been found}} with impressions of well developed feathers, most notably on the wings and tail, suggesting that they functioned at least partially for display. Secondly, at least four oviraptorosaur genera (Nomingia, Similicaudipteryx, Citipati, and Conchoraptor) preserved tails ending in something like a pygostyle, a bony structure {{at the end of}} the tail that, in modern birds, is used to support a fan of feathers. Similarly, quill knobs (<b>anchor</b> <b>points</b> for wing feathers on the ulna) have been reported in the oviraptorosaurian species Avimimus portentosus. Additionally, a number of oviraptorid specimens have famously been discovered in a nesting position similar to that of modern birds. The arms of these specimens are positioned in such a way that they could perfectly cover their eggs if they had small wings and a substantial covering of feathers.|$|E
500|$|In orthodontics, small {{diameter}} dental implants, {{referred to}} as Temporary Anchorage Devices (or TADs) can assist tooth movement by creating <b>anchor</b> <b>points</b> from which forces can be generated. [...] For teeth to move, a force must be applied {{to them in the}} direction of the desired movement. The force stimulates cells in the periodontal ligament to cause bone remodeling, removing bone in the direction of travel of the tooth and adding it to the space created. In order to generate a force on a tooth, an anchor point (something that will not move) is needed. Since implants do not have a periodontal ligament, and bone remodelling will not be stimulated when tension is applied, they are ideal <b>anchor</b> <b>points</b> in orthodontics. Typically, implants designed for orthodontic movement are small and do not fully osseointegrate, allowing easy removal following treatment.|$|E
30|$|As expected, {{the number}} of parts is {{increasing}} with lower bisection tolerances. Also, one can observe (despite the differing colors) that the partitions are hierarchical {{in the sense that}} a coarser <b>anchor</b> <b>point</b> set is a subset of the refined anchor set. Hence, each part of the refined partition always is completely contained in one part of a coarser partition of state space. The partitioning is based on the true projection error, which is reflected in the fact that all clusters are geometrically double-cones centered in the origin. This illustrates the scale invariance of the parts. In particular, points at the opposite side of an <b>anchor</b> <b>point</b> are assigned to the cluster of that <b>anchor</b> <b>point,</b> although these points are maximally distant to this <b>anchor</b> <b>point</b> with respect to the Euclidean distance. Hence, the projection error has a completely different characteristic as the Euclidean distance. As samples with current worst projection error are chosen as new <b>anchor</b> <b>point,</b> it is understandable that these tend to lie at the boundary of the point set and not in the interior.|$|R

500|$|Another {{iterative}} program, DIALIGN, {{takes an}} unusual approach of focusing narrowly on local alignments between sub-segments or sequence motifs without introducing a gap penalty. The alignment of individual motifs is then achieved with a matrix representation {{similar to a}} dot-matrix plot in a pairwise alignment. An alternative method that uses fast local alignments as <b>anchor</b> <b>points</b> or [...] "seeds" [...] for a slower global-alignment procedure is implemented in the [...] suite.|$|E
500|$|Betelgeuse {{is a very}} large, {{luminous}} but {{cool star}} classified as an M1-2 Ia-ab red supergiant. The letter [...] "M" [...] in this designation means {{that it is a}} red star belonging to the M spectral class and therefore has a relatively low photospheric temperature; the [...] "Ia-ab" [...] suffix luminosity class indicates that it is an intermediate-luminosity supergiant, with properties partway between a normal supergiant and a luminous supergiant. Since 1943, the spectrum of Betelgeuse has served as one of the stable <b>anchor</b> <b>points</b> by which other stars are classified.|$|E
500|$|Modes are {{numbered}} {{according to the}} number of half-wavelengths in the vibration. [...] Some modes exhibit vibrations in more than one direction (such as drumhead mode which has two) and consequently the mode number consists of more than one number. [...] When the vibration is in one of the higher modes, there will be multiple nodes on the resonator where there is no motion. For some types of resonator, this can provide a convenient place to make a mechanical attachment for structural support. Wires attached at nodes will have no effect on the vibration of the resonator or the overall filter response. In figure 5, some possible <b>anchor</b> <b>points</b> are shown as wires attached at the nodes. The modes shown are (5a) the second longitudinal mode fixed at one end, (5b) the first torsional mode, (5c) the second torsional mode, (5d) the second flexural mode, (5e) first radial expansion mode and (5f) first radially symmetric drumhead mode.|$|E
25|$|We take an illustrative {{synthetic}} bivariate {{data set}} of 50 points {{to illustrate the}} construction of histograms. This requires the choice of an <b>anchor</b> <b>point</b> (the lower left corner of the histogram grid). For the histogram on the left, we choose (−1.5,−1.5): for {{the one on the}} right, we shift the <b>anchor</b> <b>point</b> by 0.125 in both directions to (−1.625,−1.625). Both histograms have a binwidth of 0.5, so any differences are due to the change in the <b>anchor</b> <b>point</b> only. The colour-coding indicates the number of data points which fall into a bin: 0=white, 1=pale yellow, 2=bright yellow, 3=orange, 4=red. The left histogram appears to indicate that the upper half has a higher density than the lower half, whereas the reverse is the case for the right-hand histogram, confirming that histograms are highly sensitive to the placement of the <b>anchor</b> <b>point.</b>|$|R
