5000|$|The term 'direct injury' {{is there}} used in its legal sense, as meaning a wrong which {{directly}} {{results in the}} violation of a legal right. 'An injury, legally speaking, consists of a wrong done to a person, or, in other words, a violation of his right. It is an ancient maxim, that a damage to one, without an injury in this sense (damnum absque injuria), does not lay the foundation of an action; because, if the act complained of does not violate any of his legal rights, it is obvious, {{that he has no}} cause to complain. ... Want of right and want of remedy are justly said to be reciprocal. Where therefore there has been a violation of a right, the person injured is entitled to an action.' Parker v. Griswold, 17 Conn. 288, 302, 303, 42 <b>Am.Dec.</b> 739. The converse is equally true, that where, although there is damage, there is no violation of a right no action can be maintained.|$|E
40|$|The {{composition}} {{and structure of}} layers of ammonium decanoate (<b>AMDEC)</b> and ammonium perfluorooctanoate (APFO) adsorbed at the air/liquid interface have been studied {{by a combination of}} surface tension measurements and neutron reflectivity. At the critical micelle concentration (c. m. c.) and in solutions of pH = 8. 8 and ionic strength 0. 1, the areas occupied per surfactant anion were found to be 41 ± 2. 5 Å 2 for APFO and 35 ± 3 Å 2 for <b>AMDEC.</b> In each case it was necessary to include fugacity corrections and to fit the surface pressure-In c curve by least squares for there to be agreement with the surface excess as measured by neutron reflection. The structure of the surfactant layers was determined at the c. m. c. using neutron reflectivity measurements on three different isotopic combinations of water and surfactant. The thickness of the APFO layer was found to be 20 ± 2 Å, ca. 30 % larger than the fully extended chain length and the thickness of the <b>AMDEC</b> layer was 17 ± 2 Å, only ca. 15 % greater than the fully extended chain length. Both model fitting and a more direct method of analysing the separation between surfactant chains and water suggest that the chains are ca. 25 - 30 % immersed in the aqueous phase, with the APFO being slightly more immersed than the <b>AMDEC...</b>|$|E
40|$|To {{significantly}} enhance {{support for}} clinical and translational research {{within the framework}} of its CTSI, the NYU Langone Medical Center consolidated the Microarray and DNA Sequencing Cores into a new Genome Technology Center, a shared resource overseen by the Office for Collaborative Science. The GTC's team of 4 technical personnel and one faculty level director assists > 120 NYULMC laboratories in their basic, clinical and translational research. The Sequencing Unit operates 2 Illumina GAIIs, and a HiSeq sequencer will be added in Q 1 2011. The GAII capacity is applied to research applications (ChIP-seq, small-RNA-seq and RIP-seq) and to identification of disease-related genome-level structure changes and correlates (e. g. RNA-seq of cancer transcriptomes). GTC also has a Roche GS FLX System (454) used for de novo sequencing of microbial species and for amplicon sequencing in clinical genetics, patient microbiome diversity, etc. The Microarray Unit operates Affymetrix GeneChip system and high-capacity QPCR (ABI 7900 HT) with automated plate setup and loading for gene and microRNA profiling and for SNP genotyping in clinical genetics. The GTC cooperates closely with the newly established Center for Health Informatics and Bioinformatics (CHIBI) supported by the NIH/NCRR CTSA Award. CHIBI provides an HPC facility for sequencing and microarray data storage and offers a full range of informatics services. The GTC is committed to regional and nationwide collaborations with other Cores. GTC participates in the activities of the Genomic Analysis and Technology Excellence (GATE) Working Group of the Academy for Medical Development and Collaboration (<b>AMDeC),</b> particularly in the sections of Core Facility Directors, Funding Strategy and Bioinformatics. It also contributes to the <b>AMDeC</b> Facilities Instrumentation Resources Services Technologies (FIRST), a real-time online database of biomedical research technology and resources available in the New York City area and throughout Northeastern US.

40|$|The DFM (design for manufacturing) {{methods are}} used during {{technology}} alignment and adoption {{processes in the}} semiconductor industry (SI) for manufacturability and yield assessments. These methods have worked well till 250 nm technology for the transformation of systematic variations into rules and/or models based on the single-source data analyses, but beyond this technology they have turned into ineffective R&D efforts. The {{reason for this is}} our inability to capture newly emerging spatial variations. It has led an exponential increase in technology lead times and costs that must be addressed; hence, objectively in this thesis we are focused on identifying and removing causes associated with the DFM ineffectiveness. The fabless, foundry and traditional integrated device manufacturer (IDM) business models are first analyzed to see coherence against a recent shift in business objectives from time-to-market (T 2 M) and time-to-volume towards (T 2 V) towards ramp-up rate. The increasing technology lead times and costs are identified as a big challenge in achieving quick ramp-up rates; hence, an extended IDM (e-IDM) business model is proposed to support quick ramp-up rates which is based on improving the DFM ineffectiveness followed by its smooth integration. We have found (i) single-source analyses and (ii) inability to exploit huge manufacturing data volumes as core limiting factors (failure modes) towards DFM ineffectiveness during technology alignment and adoption efforts within an IDM. The causes for single-source root cause analysis are identified as the (i) varying metrology reference frames and (ii) test structures orientations that require wafer rotation prior to the measurements, resulting in varying metrology coordinates (die/site level mismatches). A generic coordinates mapping and alignment model (MAM) is proposed to remove these die/site level mismatches, however to accurately capture the emerging spatial variations, we have proposed a spatial positioning model (SPM) to perform multi-source parametric correlation based on the shortest distance between respective test structures used to measure the parameters. The (i) unstructured model evolution, (ii) ontology issues and (iii) missing links among production databases are found as causes towards our inability to exploit huge manufacturing data volumes. The ROMMII (referential ontology Meta model for information integration) framework is then proposed to remove these issues and enable the dynamic and efficient multi-source root cause analyses. An interdisciplinary failure mode effect analysis (i-FMEA) methodology is also proposed to find cyclic failure modes and causes across the business functions which require generic solutions rather than operational fixes for improvement. The proposed e-IDM, MAM, SPM, and ROMMII framework results in accurate analysis and modeling of emerging spatial variations based on dynamic exploitation of the huge manufacturing data volumes. La « conception pour la fabrication » ou DFM (Design for Manufacturing) est une méthode maintenant classique pour assurer lors de la conception des produits simultanément la faisabilité, la qualité et le rendement de la production. Dans l'industrie microélectronique, le Design Rule Manual (DRM) a bien fonctionné jusqu'à la technologie 250 nm avec la prise en compte des variations systématiques dans les règles et/ou des modèles basés sur l'analyse des causes profondes, mais au-delà de cette technologie, des limites ont été atteintes en raison de l'incapacité à sasir les corrélations entre variations spatiales. D'autre part, l'évolution rapide des produits et des technologies contraint à une mise à jour « dynamique » des DRM en fonction des améliorations trouvées dans les fabs. Dans ce contexte les contributions de thèse sont (i) une définition interdisciplinaire des <b>AMDEC</b> et analyse de risques pour contribuer aux défis du DFM dynamique, (ii) un modèle MAM (mapping and alignment model) de localisation spatiale pour les données de tests, (iii) un référentiel de données basé sur une ontologie ROMMII (referential ontology Meta model for information integration) pour effectuer le mapping entre des données hétérogènes issues de sources variées et (iv) un modèle SPM (spatial positioning model) qui vise à intégrer les facteurs spatiaux dans les méthodes DFM de la microélectronique, pour effectuer une analyse précise et la modélisation des variations spatiales basées sur l'exploitation dynamique des données de fabrication avec des volumétries importantes...|$|E
