Secondary tooling methods include trepanning, skiving and burnishing, pull boring, or bottle boring. Finally {{a new kind of}} drilling technology is available to face this issue: vibration drilling. This technology breaks up the chips by a small controlled <b>axial</b> <b>vibration</b> of the drill. The small chips are easily removed by the flutes of the drill.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method to}} identify {{the root cause of}} the <b>axial</b> <b>vibration</b> of crankshafts for high speed diesel engines based on an auto-regressive and moving average model and the analytic hierarchy process. Through determining initial moving average variables and measuring axial/bending/torsional vibrations of a crankshaft at the free-end of a fourcylinder diesel engine, auto-regressive spectrum analysis is applied to the measured vibration signal. In an investigation of the root cause of the vibration, the hierarchy tree and judgment matrix are given to identify the main vibration root causes. The results show that the <b>axial</b> <b>vibration</b> of the crankshaft is mainly coupled and excited by the bending vibration at high speeds. But at low speeds, the <b>axial</b> <b>vibration</b> in some frequencies is coupled and excited primarily by the torsional vibration.

In other words, the analytical model describing the test segments in this thesis can easily apply to other vertical drill string models, with a few adjustments. The study attempts {{to answer the following}} research question: To what extent can the lumped element model be used to replicate and predict <b>axial</b> <b>vibrations</b> in a vertical drill string? The analytical model is derived and tested on the following three scenarios. The first scenario considers only the transient state of the model.

40|$|International audienceRecent {{progress}} made in making clutches lightweight and in reducing torsional vibrations {{has led to}} the emergence of new vibroacoustic phenomena due to the out-of-plane vibrations of the clutch. These vibrations are generated along the axial direction of the clutch system. Contrary to torsional vibrations that can be simulated by unidirectional lumped-mass models, <b>axial</b> <b>vibrations</b> require a three-dimensional approach to describe the dynamics of the components. Finite element models are widely used to design or optimize the components of the clutch. However, no finite element model of a complete clutch has been developed for analysis of <b>axial</b> <b>vibrations.</b> The main difficulties are the complexity of the system, the great number of non-linearities, the difficulties of instrumentation for validation and the variation in the behaviour along the engagement stroke. This paper provides a validated three-dimensional finite element model of the dynamic behaviour of the clutch for studying <b>axial</b> <b>vibrations.</b> The model simulates the axial static and dynamic characteristics of the clutch. Model accuracy and validation are achieved by comparing the numerical results with the experimental data. The results show the crucial parameters to consider in order to reproduce correctly the non-linear axial behaviour and the dynamic characteristics of the clutch system, namely the orthotropic behaviour of the friction material and the geometrical parameters of some components that should be detailed.

This type of vibration interaction can be described as torsionally-induced propeller thrust fluctuation.

The aim of this study is twofold; i. e. to show how the design of the propulsion line shafting affects the coupling phenomenon between torsional and <b>axial</b> <b>vibrations,</b> and to correlate line shafting design with potential structural problems of the hull. The line shafting design is first addressed using conventional approach which yields information about torsional and axial eigenvalues and stresses.

This manufacturing process requires the chips {{to be evacuated}} {{through the use of}} retreat cycles and high-pressure lubrication, which is problematic both for productivity and the respect of the environment. An alternative response to the chip evacuation problem is the use of a vibratory drilling head which enables the chip to be split thanks to the drill's <b>axial</b> <b>vibration.</b> The high-speed drilling operation requires specific cutting conditions to be determined in order to maintain self-excited <b>axial</b> <b>vibration</b> throughout the drilling process. The prediction of adequate cutting conditions is determined {{on the basis of the}} frequency characteristics of the spindle/self-vibratory drilling head and the dynamics of the cutting process.

One of these important subjects is the capability to compress gas which includes a significant amount of liquids. Compressing wet gas requires knowledge in areas such as the prediction of turbomachinery performance with the mixed phase flow as well as the mechanical reliability of machinery in the same environment. This paper presents experimental results from a wet gas test campaign which, among other goals, is focused on characterizing the mechanical performance of a two stage compressor operating under wet gas conditions. Various mechanical parameters are monitored in the test program including rotor radial and <b>axial</b> <b>vibration,</b> rotor thrust, and shaft torque. A full array of wet gas conditions are tested with a suction pressure of 20 bar (300 psia) and liquid volume fractions in the range of 0. 5 to 5 %. The operating fluids are air and water, and the two stage compressor is operated at three speed lines ranging from high flow to low flow conditions. Significant variations are noted in the axial thrust, <b>axial</b> <b>vibration</b> and shaft torque. Thrust variations range from seemingly neutral thrust conditions at very low water injection rates to significant thrust increases (as compared to dry condition) for very high water injection rates. Rotor <b>axial</b> <b>vibration</b> is characterized by large amplitude and very low frequency, especially for the case in which the rotor thrust is balanced by the water injection.
