5|$|Kennedy {{visited the}} British Mandate of Palestine in 1948 and wrote dispatches {{at the time}} for the Boston Post about his trip and the effect it had on him when he was twenty-two years old. During his stay, he wrote that he grew to <b>admire</b> <b>the</b> Jewish {{inhabitants}} of the area. As a Senator, he later became a strong supporter and advocate for Israel.|$|E
5|$|No longer deemed {{politically}} controversial, ao dai {{fashion design}} {{is supported by}} the Vietnamese government. It is often called áo dài Việt Nam to link it to patriotic feelings. Designer Le Si Hoang is a celebrity in Vietnam and his shop in Saigon is the place to visit for those who <b>admire</b> <b>the</b> dress. In Hanoi, tourists get fitted with ao dai on Luong Van Can Street. The elegant city of Huế in the central region is known for its ao dai, nón lá (leaf hats), and well-dressed women.|$|E
5|$|While contemplating on {{his options}} in a temple, Siddhu accidentally meets Hasini (Genelia D'Souza), an {{engineering}} student. Siddhu is attracted by her cheerful nature and energy, {{and the couple}} begin to meet on a regular basis. As the days go by, Siddhu grows to <b>admire</b> <b>the</b> ever-friendly Hasini as someone who does what she loves, and he discovers many small things which make him happy {{to be in her}} company; he realizes that he has fallen in love with her.|$|E
60|$|She <b>admired</b> <b>the</b> car, she <b>admired</b> <b>the</b> colour of <b>the</b> car, she <b>admired</b> <b>the</b> lamps {{of the car}} and {{the door}} {{of the car and}} the little {{fittings}} of <b>the</b> car. She <b>admired</b> <b>the</b> horn. She <b>admired</b> <b>the</b> twist of <b>the</b> horn. She <b>admired</b> Clarence and <b>the</b> uniform of Clarence and she <b>admired</b> and coveted <b>the</b> great fur coat that he held ready for his employer. (But if she had it, she said, she would wear the splendid fur outside to show every little bit of it.) And when the car at last moved forward and tooted--she <b>admired</b> <b>the</b> note--and vanished softly and swiftly through the gates, she was left in the porch with Mr. Brumley still by sheer inertia admiring and envying. She admired Sir Isaac's car number Z 900. (Such an easy one to remember!) Then she stopped abruptly, as one might discover that the water in the bathroom was running to waste and turn it off.|$|R
25|$|Through {{many of his}} traits, Caragiale was {{connected}} to a Balkan environment of virtually permanent human contact, with its humor condensed in anecdotes, mimicry, and witty comebacks. Zarifopol quoted him saying that he <b>admired</b> <b>the</b> traditional forms of entertainment, and that he <b>admired</b> <b>the</b> soitarìi ("buffoons").|$|R

5|$|Finally, {{there is}} no attempt by the artist to soften the subject's {{brutality}} through technical skill. Method and subject are indivisible. Goya's procedure is determined less by the mandates of traditional virtuosity than by his intrinsically morbid theme. The brushwork could not be described as pleasing, and the colors are restricted to earth tones and black, punctuated by bright flashes of white and the red blood of the victims. The quality of the pigment itself foreshadows Goya's later works: a granular solution producing a matte, sandy finish. Few would <b>admire</b> <b>the</b> work for painterly flourishes, such is its horrific force and its lack of theatricality.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} Carolean {{features}} {{of the house is}} the balustrade and cupola surmounting the roof, another element introduced to English architecture by Roger Pratt. The cupola at Belton does not light a lofty domed hall, {{as is often the case}} in Europe, but houses a staircase which gives access to a large viewing platform on top of a lead roof, concealed from the ground by the balustrade which tops the more conventional and visible hipped roof. From this vantage point, the owners of Belton could <b>admire</b> <b>the</b> perfect symmetry of their avenues and formal gardens spreading from the house. This feature of the house was removed by the architect James Wyatt when he modernised the house in the 18th century. It was restored to its original form in the 1870s by the 3rd Earl Brownlow.|$|E
5|$|One week later, Mrs. Mallard {{leads the}} ducklings ashore and {{straight}} to the highway in hopes of crossing to reach the Garden, but she has trouble crossing as the cars will not yield to her. Michael, the policeman who the Mallards visited, stops traffic for the family to cross. Michael calls police headquarters and instructs them to send a police car to stop traffic along the route for the ducks. The ducks cross the highway, Embankment Road (Storrow Drive {{had yet to be}} constructed when the book was written), then proceed down Mount Vernon Street to Charles Street where they head south to the Garden. The people on the streets <b>admire</b> <b>the</b> family of ducks. When the family must cross Beacon Street to enter the Garden, there are four policemen standing in the intersection stopping traffic {{to make way for the}} ducklings. Mr. Mallard is waiting in the Public Garden for the rest of the family. Finally, the family decides to stay in the Garden and lives happily ever after. They end each day searching for peanuts and food, and when night falls, they swim to their little island and go to sleep.|$|E

25|$|Palm Springs {{is home to}} one of the country's largest {{collections}} of mid-century architecture. Thousands of homes, apartments, hotels, businesses and other buildings were designed in this fashion across the city. International mid-century enthusiasts come to Palm Springs to <b>admire</b> <b>the</b> design.|$|E
25|$|In Room 3, the {{relationships}} between Padre Martini and the stand-out personalities of the music world of the time, such as the young Mozart or Johann Christian Bach, who is represented in the famous portrait by Gainsborough, are displayed. In the same room, one can also <b>admire</b> <b>the</b> famous Sportelli di libreria musicale by Giuseppe Maria Crespi.|$|E

25|$|Body {{painting}} festivals happen annually {{across the}} world, bringing together professional body painters {{as well as}} keen amateurs. Body paintings can also typically be seen at football matches, at rave parties, and at certain festivals. The World Bodypainting Festival in Pörtschach (previously held in Seeboden) in Austria is the biggest art event in the bodypainting theme and thousands of visitors <b>admire</b> <b>the</b> wonderful work of the participants.|$|E
25|$|The Lining: lining is {{considered}} an unnecessary burden and the Neapolitan tailors keep it as minimal as possible. Usually, the jacket is unlined or only half lined, {{in order to provide}} lightness; even the sleeves are completely unlined, as they’re meant to fit like a second skin. Additionally, the lining is often left open (“volante,” literally “flying”) so that people can <b>admire</b> <b>the</b> fine details and construction of the jacket.|$|E
25|$|Since {{at least}} the 12th century the cathedral has been an {{important}} destination for travellers– and remains so to the present, attracting large numbers of Christian pilgrims, many of whom come to venerate its famous relic, the Sancta Camisa, said to be the tunic worn by the Virgin Mary at Christ's birth, as well as large numbers of secular tourists who come to <b>admire</b> <b>the</b> cathedral's architecture and historical merit.|$|E

25|$|Many of the then-popular locust {{trees were}} {{planted on the}} Livingston estates to frame the views. The Livingstons, as was {{customary}} for the owners of large country estates at the time, opened their grounds to the public on weekends as parks, and to this end followed Downing's theories of landscaping by building curving paths and rustic benches and shelters from which to <b>admire</b> <b>the</b> river and distant mountains.|$|E
25|$|Richardson {{played for}} Bacup and Burnley Cricket Clubs in the Lancashire League in the 1930s. At his first match at Todmorden Cricket Club's ground Richardson was so {{overwhelmed}} by the scenery he stopped Todmorden player Fred Root in his bowling run up so he could <b>admire</b> <b>the</b> view. He set {{the record for the}} highest number of runs in a Lancashire League season in 1929 with 1193 runs, a record later surpassed by Everton Weekes.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} year, on 2 April 1911, a French pilot, Maurice Tétard, {{flying from}} Brooklands to Larkhill, called at North Stoneham {{to make some}} adjustments; although he only stayed for about half an hour, a large inquisitive crowd rapidly gathered to <b>admire</b> <b>the</b> plane. In 1917, the field at North Stoneham was requisitioned by the War Office as an Aircraft Acceptance Park, but before completion, the base {{was given to the}} US Navy to develop an assembly area; this subsequently evolved into Southampton International Airport.|$|E

25|$|The Church {{had been}} {{practically}} abandoned {{for some years}} and was in a bad state of delapidation, but the beautiful carved work {{that had been done}} by William Bernard Sears, soon after the church was built, had not then been molested. My mother used to sit in the church and read the Lord's Prayer and Ten Commandments over the Chancel, and <b>admire</b> <b>the</b> gilded dove that Mr. Sears had placed high over the Pulpit. The 'Eye' which he also had made seemed to be looking at her no matter where she sat.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{there are}} only a few troupes that {{maintain}} the tradition. They often perform for tourists. However, there are no longer the great historical families of marionettists, such as the Greco of Palermo; the Canino of Partinico and Alcamo; Crimi, Trombetta and Napoli of Catania, Pennisi and Macri of Acireale, Profeta of Licata, Gargano and Grasso of Agrigento. One can, however, <b>admire</b> <b>the</b> richest collection of marionettes at the Museo Internazionale delle Marionette Antonio Pasqualino and at the Museo Etnografico Siciliano Giuseppe Pitrè in Palermo. Other beautiful marionettes are on display at the Museo Civico Vagliasindi in Randazzo.|$|E
25|$|The main attractions for {{tourists}} are places of natural beauty {{situated in the}} extreme zones of the country: San Pedro de Atacama, in the north, is very popular with foreign tourists who arrive to <b>admire</b> <b>the</b> Incaic architecture, the altiplano lakes, and the Valley of the Moon. In Putre, also in the north, there is the Chungará Lake, {{as well as the}} Parinacota and the Pomerape volcanoes, with altitudes of 6,348 m and 6,282 m, respectively. Throughout the central Andes there are many ski resorts of international repute, including Portillo, Valle Nevado and Termas de Chillán.|$|E
