25|$|The digital {{switchover}} process involved discontinuing <b>analogue</b> <b>terrestrial</b> TV broadcasts, {{which in some}} areas allowed for greater signal strength and/or better coverage of digital multiplexes. The process concluded on 24 October 2012, when {{digital switchover}} completed in Northern Ireland (the same day as the Republic of Ireland also completed its digital switchover).|$|E
25|$|All channels, except SVT1 HD and SVT2 HD, are {{available}} in most of Sweden through the digital terrestrial television network and encrypted from Thor and Sirius satellites. Until September 2005, both SVT1 and SVT2 were available nationwide via <b>analogue</b> <b>terrestrial</b> transmitters. Cable networks are required to broadcast four SVT channels for free in either digital or analogue form.|$|E

Television services are available via satellite using Sky or Freeview. <b>Analogue</b> <b>terrestrial</b> television services could be received on Stewart Island from the Hedgehope television transmitter located on the South Island prior to the analogue switch off on April 28, 2013.|$|E
25|$|Sure South Atlantic Ltd (Sure) offers {{television}} {{for the island}} via 17 <b>analogue</b> <b>terrestrial</b> UHF channels, offering a mix of British, US, and South African programming. The channels are from DSTV and include Mnet, SuperSport, and BBC channels. The feed signal from MultiChoice DStv in South Africa is received by a satellite dish at Bryant's Beacon from Intelsat 7 in the Ku band.|$|E
25|$|On 9 February 2005, Ofcom {{issued a}} {{proposed}} timetable for ending <b>analogue</b> <b>terrestrial</b> television transmissions {{as part of}} the switchover to digital television. Tyne Tees was the penultimate region to cease broadcasting in analogue, which occurred during September 2012. Tyne Tees took over the relay transmitter at Berwick-upon-Tweed in December 2006 from Border Television in order to extend the deadline of the town's upgrade to digital TV by four years, since Border was the first to switch off its analogue signal in 2008.|$|E

25|$|DVB-T was {{repeatedly}} tested from 2RN's Three Rock Mountain transmitter, with relatively long tests in 1998 and 2001, and shorter tests in 2004, {{with a single}} multiplex carrying the four Irish <b>analogue</b> <b>terrestrial</b> channels, and Tara Television while it was in existence, on both UHF (channel 26) and VHF (channel D). These were under temporary licences for testing, which are regularly awarded. RTÉast Networks also broadcast test DVB-T with analogue TV and radio channels from the Clermont Carn transmitter in the Cooley Mountains, County Louth with some signal bleed into the North.|$|E
25|$|As {{the switch}} to digital-only {{terrestrial}} transmission progressed, BBC Two was (in each region in turn) the first analogue TV channel to be replaced with the BBC multiplex, at first four, then two weeks ahead of the other four channels. This was required for those relay transmitters that had no current Freeview service giving viewers time to purchase the equipment, unless they had already selected a satellite or cable service. The last region for BBC Two to end on <b>analogue</b> <b>terrestrial</b> television was Northern Ireland on 10 October 2012.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, Five, {{the last}} {{national}} terrestrial station to launch in the UK, came {{to some of}} Cornwall {{from the first day}} of the station's transmission to the Redruth coverage area (serving the west of the county), although at much lower power than the other 4 channels. Channel Five is not broadcast on Caradon Hill (serving the east of the county) or some of the television relay transmitters in Cornwall, and also broadcasts on the main transmitters on lower power than the four other main <b>analogue</b> <b>terrestrial</b> channels.|$|E

25|$|The Independent Television Commission (ITC) {{allocated}} each existing <b>analogue</b> <b>terrestrial</b> channel {{half the}} capacity of a multiplex each. This meant the BBC got a multiplex to themselves (Multiplex 1), ITV and Channel 4 shared Multiplex 2 (though 3% of the capacity was given to Teletext Ltd.) and Channel 5 and S4C shared Multiplex A. The remaining spectrum (Multiplexes B, C and D) was then auctioned off. A consortium made up of Granada and Carlton (members of the ITV network, which have now merged to form ITV plc) and BSkyB successfully bid for these licences, and set-up the subscription ONdigital service, though BSkyB left the consortium prior to launch.|$|E
25|$|A {{deal between}} TVNZ and Sky to have TVNZ 6 and 7 {{available}} to Sky subscribers {{in exchange for}} Prime finally being launched on Freeview with a virtual channel assignment of 10 on 17 August 2009. If Prime would have joined at launch then {{they may have been}} able to get a lower assignment, however virtual channel assignments are only enforced on certified receivers. It is also noted virtual channel 10 is not far off its usual tuning to push-button 9 on analogue television sets, due to its historic links with the Nine Network, its allocation on Sky's former <b>analogue</b> <b>terrestrial</b> service, and for compatibility with video recorders using the G-Code scheduling system.|$|E
2500|$|Prime's <b>analogue</b> <b>terrestrial</b> signals {{had covered}} 91% of the {{population}} via the state-owned Kordia transmission network. [...] It is currently available in digitally free-to-air form via Sky Network Television on satellite and Kordia on terrestrial. [...] Vodafone also carry the channel for their cable subscribers in Wellington and Christchurch.|$|E
50|$|MicroTuner MT2060 is a single-chip, {{microprocessor-based}} {{television tuner}} capable of receiving <b>analogue</b> and <b>terrestrial</b> TV by Microtune, Inc. It {{is commonly used}} in USB digital television receivers due to its small size and power consumption. A number of internal PCI dual tuner TV tuner cards also use the MT2060 because it allows a dual-tuner card to be produced that is {{no larger than a}} single tuner card.|$|R
50|$|On 25 September 2007 at 11pm, Andorra {{became one}} of the first European {{countries}} to switch off all <b>terrestrial</b> <b>analogue</b> transmissions, making TDT the only method of terrestrial TV reception in the country.|$|R

2500|$|On October 14, 2011, Minister Rabbitte {{announced}} that <b>analogue</b> <b>terrestrial</b> television broadcast would be switched off on October 24, 2012. This date was chosen {{in consultation with}} the UK on its Northern Ireland analogue switchover date so that both jurisdictions on the island would switch over at roughly the same time. This was done to make it straightforward for citizens {{on both sides of the}} border., referring citizens to both Saorview's website and the Department's Digital Switchover Website ...|$|E
2500|$|The UK Government's {{intention}} was that {{digital terrestrial television}} would completely replace <b>analogue</b> <b>terrestrial</b> television in the United Kingdom by 24 October 2012. This process was known as [...] "Digital Switchover", or DSO. The industry association for digital television in the UK, Digital TV Group, was responsible for co-ordination between Freeview and other digital services. DTG licensed suitable equipment to bear the Digital Tick and Freeview Playback Logos to identify PVRs and other devices designed to work through switchover, and {{to raise awareness of}} DTT product quality and standards. Digital terrestrial television is broadcast using the DVB-T international standard for standard definition content and DVB-T2 for high definition content.|$|E

50|$|<b>Analogue</b> <b>terrestrial</b> {{television}} in the United Kingdom was originally the method by which the significant majority of viewers in the UK, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man received television. <b>Analogue</b> <b>terrestrial</b> television broadcasts have ceased everywhere in the UK with Northern Ireland being the last region to cease broadcasting <b>analogue</b> <b>terrestrial</b> television broadcasts. Northern Ireland switched off the last analogue television signals, making all of the United Kingdom only capable of receiving digital television, {{in the early hours}} of 24 October 2012. It has been completely replaced by digital terrestrial television and other non-terrestrial means as of the end of 2012.|$|E
