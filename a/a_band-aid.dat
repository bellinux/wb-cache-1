In May 1985, USA for Africa officials estimated that they had sold between $45million and $47million worth of official merchandise around the world. Organizer Ken Kragen announced {{that they would not be}} distributing all of the money at once.

40|$|Participatory Budgeting (PB), an {{institutional}} innovation to promote democratic change, {{is a form}} of collaborative governance in which citizens are involved in decision-making processes about how to spend part or all of available government funds. Like the broader concept of democracy, for PB to be effective, there needs to be an ongoing participatory process that involves the building of civic capacity and infrastructure. This paper focuses on a particular attribute of civic efficacy, that of deliberative public engagement, defined as collaborative problem solving through informed, inclusive, egalitarian processes with the outcomes influencing policy, decisions and/or collaborative action. It is argued that to be a deep democratic reform, PB needs to be more intentionally deliberative than usually practiced, within an environment that nurtures civic collaboration and empowerment. In the current situation of disaffected, often angry and/or cynical citizenry, without resorting to revolution, overcoming the pervasive sense of impotence to effect real change is not easy. It requires ongoing effort to create the civic capacity, policies and the institutions that will enable everyday people to work together with decision-makers to achieve collaborative public wisdom, decisions and action. For PB to avoid being merely <b>a</b> superficial <b>band-aid</b> to the perceived malaise of our democratic systems, we contend that the culture in which it is situated needs to be nurtured and stewarded to be more collaborative, considered and egalitarian. The deliberative democracy process instituted {{over a number of years}} in Greater Geraldton, Western Australia, shows how some of the preconditions for an effective participatory budgeting initiative could be achieved. The lessons learned are widely applicable to other western democracies, and potentially, other forms of governance...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a physiological model of longitudinal smooth muscle tissue from isolated longitudinal smooth muscle cells arranged in the longitudinal axis. Methods: Longitudinal smooth muscle cells from rabbit sigmoid colon were isolated and expanded in culture. Cells were seeded at high densities onto laminin-coated Sylgard surfaces with defined wavy microtopographies. A highly aligned cell sheet was formed, to which addition of fibrin resulted in delamination. Results: (1) Acetylcholine (ACh) induced a dose-dependent, rapid, and sustained force generation. (2) Absence of extracellular calcium attenuated the magnitude and sustainability of ACh-induced force by 50 % and 60 %, respectively. (3) Vasoactive intestinal peptide also attenuated the magnitude and sustainability of ACh-induced force by 40 % and 60 %, respectively. These data were similar to force generated by longitudinal tissue. (4) Bioengineered constructs also maintained smooth muscle phenotype and calcium-dependence characteristics. Summary: This is a novel physiologically relevant in vitro three-dimensional model of colonic longitudinal smooth muscle tissue. Bioengineered three-dimensional longitudinal smooth muscle presents the ability to generate force, and respond to contractile agonists and relaxant peptides similar to native longitudinal tissue. This model has potential applications to investigate the underlying pathophysiology of dysfunctional colonic motility. It also presents as <b>a</b> readily implantable <b>band-aid</b> colonic longitudinal muscle tissue...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. December 2012. Major: Social Work. Advisor: Michael Baizerman. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xi, 263 pages, appendices 1 - 3. Frontline youth workers {{are critical to}} an effective community and organizational response to street children and youth, {{one of the most}} marginalized and disadvantaged groups in Nepal and globally. As employees of non-governmental organizations (NGOs), these workers engage street young people in both street- and center-based settings to offer services aimed at increasing their "wellbeing and healthy development. " This dissertation explored, examined, and analyzed how NGOs (and by extension their international funders), workers, and young people understood and influenced this frontline youth work practice in Kathmandu, Nepal. The study used a mixed-method qualitative research. Data were collected from 24 frontline youth workers, eight management level staff, and 23 street youth. Workers viewed street young people as both victims and deviants, who were partly responsible for their own victimization and future life-outcomes. A primary approach used to help young people "fix" their problems and themselves as "problems" was "socialization. " In practice, this was a form of social control. As young people transitioned from a street outreach program to a drop-in center and then to a transition home, there was an increase in the workers' control of these young people's activities, choices, and even voices. Child rights and their participation were emphasized in theory, while in practice participation was workers' manipulation and tokenism rather than youth-driven and youth/adult equity (Hart, 1992). These NGOs were the only agencies that offered services to street young people. They worked with little support from government and in an environment of public distrust and financial uncertainty. A powerful influence to their work was their international donor agencies that, as part of their funding to NGOs, guided and shaped the street level understanding and practice of frontline youth work. At another level, NGOs influenced this work by teaching workers their roles and work and by requiring them to show outputs. At the individual level, unethical practices of some workers further alienated young people from mainstream society and damaged their own and their agencies' reputation. Overall, workers and their agencies were doing good work, particularly in the context of many obstacles. However, no discernable effort was being made to confront the larger, complex, social institutional sources of what is the "street children" social problem. No one - neither government, nor NGOs and international organizations - had named fully or even begun to take this on. Frontline youth work was not a solution to the "street children problem. " It was <b>a</b> small <b>band-aid</b> on <b>a</b> larger, deeper cut...|$|R
