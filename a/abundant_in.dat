5|$|Although more <b>abundant</b> <b>in</b> montane and {{northern}} coniferous woodlands {{such as the}} Sierra Nevada and the Cascade Range in northwestern North America, Gyromitra esculenta is found widely across the continent, {{as far south as}} Mexico. It is also common in Central Europe, less <b>abundant</b> <b>in</b> the east, and more in montane areas than lowlands. It has been recorded from Northern Ireland, from Uşak Province in Western Turkey, and from the vicinity of Kaş in the Antalya Province of Turkey's southern coast.|$|E

5|$|Bromine is {{significantly}} less <b>abundant</b> <b>in</b> the crust than fluorine or chlorine, comprising only 2.5parts per {{million of the}} Earth's crustal rocks, and then only as bromide salts. It is the forty-sixth most abundant element in Earth's crust. It {{is significantly}} more <b>abundant</b> <b>in</b> the oceans, resulting from long-term leaching. There, it makes up 65parts per million, corresponding to a ratio of about one bromine atom for every 660 chlorine atoms. Salt lakes and brine wells may have higher bromine concentrations: for example, the Dead Sea contains 0.4% bromide ions. It is from these sources that bromine extraction is mostly economically feasible.|$|E
5|$|Field {{observations}} {{suggest that}} the mushroom associates mycorrhizally with the plant Castanopsis fissa, a deciduous tree found only in the southern provinces of China, such as Guangdong, Yunnan and Hunan.

5|$|Carbon is the 15th most <b>abundant</b> element <b>in</b> the Earth's crust, and {{the fourth}} most <b>abundant</b> element <b>in</b> the {{universe}} by mass after hydrogen, helium, and oxygen. Carbon's abundance, its unique diversity of organic compounds, and its unusual ability to form polymers at the temperatures commonly encountered on Earth enables this element {{to serve as a}} common element of all known life. It is the second most <b>abundant</b> element <b>in</b> the human body by mass (about 18.5%) after oxygen.|$|R

5|$|The low natural concentration, and {{the close}} {{similarity}} {{of physical and}} chemical properties to those of lanthanum and other lanthanides, which are always <b>abundant</b> <b>in</b> actinium-bearing ores, render separation of actinium from the ore impractical, and complete separation was never achieved.

They can also be found in other types of habitat at elevations ranging from 80 - 1,220 metres (262ft - 4,000ft).|$|E
5|$|Aetosaur fossil remains {{are known}} from Europe, North and South America, parts of Africa and India. Since their {{armoured}} plates are often preserved and are <b>abundant</b> <b>in</b> certain localities, aetosaurs serve as important Late Triassic tetrapod index fossils.

Therefore, {{the presence of}} particular aetosaurs can accurately date a site that they are found in.|$|E
