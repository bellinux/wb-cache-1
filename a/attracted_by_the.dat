They evoke both melancholy and death, and conjure the state of faaturuma (brooding or melancholy); imagery and moods later used in the Oviri ceramic. Gauguin's first wood carvings in Tahiti were with a guava wood that quickly crumbled and have not survived.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, De Ravin {{was cast}} to portray Emily Kostich, the heroin-addicted ex-girlfriend of Brendan Frye (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), in the neo-noir film Brick.

5|$|The crop can be {{attacked}} by larvae of the carrot fly (Chamaepsila rosae). This pest feeds {{on the outer}} layers of the root, burrowing its way inside later in the season. Seedlings may be killed while larger roots are spoiled. The damage done provides a point of entry for fungal rots and canker. The fly is <b>attracted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> smell of bruised tissue.|$|E
5|$|Adult {{butterflies}} consume only liquids, ingested {{through the}} proboscis. They sip water from damp patches for hydration and feed on nectar from flowers, {{from which they}} obtain sugars for energy, and sodium and other minerals vital for reproduction. Several species of butterflies need more sodium than that provided by nectar and are attracted by sodium in salt; they sometimes land on people, <b>attracted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> salt in human sweat. Some butterflies also visit dung, rotting fruit or carcasses to obtain minerals and nutrients. In many species, this mud-puddling behaviour is restricted to the males, and {{studies have suggested that}} the nutrients collected may be provided as a nuptial gift, along with the spermatophore, during mating.|$|E

Between 1974 and July 28, 1977, when the first barrel of oil reached Valdez, {{tens of thousands of}} people worked on the pipeline. Thousands of workers came to Alaska, <b>attracted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> prospect of high-paying jobs at a time when most of the rest of the United States was undergoing a recession.|$|E
5|$|As the Great Lakes assumed {{their present}} levels, the {{waterfall}} was inundated and Mackinac Island took on its current size. The steep cliffs {{were one of}} the primary reasons for the British army's choice of the island for a fortification; their decision differed from that of the French army, which had built Fort Michilimackinac about 1715 near present-day Mackinaw City. The limestone formations are still part of the island's appeal. However, tourists are <b>attracted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> natural beauty rather than the strategic value. One of the most popular geologic formations is Arch Rock, a natural limestone arch, 146feet (45m) above the ground. Other popular geologic formations include Devil's Kitchen, Skull Cave, and Sugar Loaf.|$|E
5|$|Beato, who {{had covered}} {{military}} operations in India and China, was probably <b>attracted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> news of the annexation. While he arrived in Burma after the main military operations ended, he would still get {{to see more of}} the action, as the annexation by the British led to an insurgency which lasted for the following decade. This allowed Beato to take a number of pictures of British military in operations or at the Royal Palace, Mandalay, as well as insurgency soldiers and prisoners.|$|E

5|$|Females are <b>attracted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> booms of the {{competing}} males; they too {{may need to}} walk several kilometres from their territories to the arena. Once a female enters the court {{of one of the}} males, the male performs a display in which he rocks from side to side and makes clicking noises with his beak. He turns his back to the female, spreads his wings in display and walks backwards towards her. He will then attempt copulation for 2 to 14minutes. Once the birds have mated, the female returns to her home territory to lay eggs and raise the chicks. The male continues booming in the hope of attracting another female.|$|E
5|$|George III {{reversed}} {{this trend}} {{when he came}} to the throne in 1760. George disliked Hampton Court, and was <b>attracted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> park at Windsor Castle. George wanted to move into the Ranger's House by the castle, but his brother, Henry was already living in it and refused to move out. Instead, George had to move into the Upper Lodge, later called the Queen's Lodge, and started the long process of renovating the castle and the surrounding parks. Initially the atmosphere at the castle remained very informal, with local children playing games inside the Upper and Lower Wards, and the royal family frequently seen as they walked around the grounds. As time went by, however, access for visitors became more limited.|$|E
5|$|Historical {{large-scale}} immigration was {{facilitated by}} the introduction of steamships (from 1823). By 1840, up to 5,000 English people, mostly half-pay officers and their families, had settled in Jersey. In the aftermath of 1848, Polish, Russian, Hungarian, Italian and French political refugees came to Jersey. Following Louis Napol√©on's coup of 1851, more French proscrits arrived. By the end of the 19th century, well-to-do British families, <b>attracted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> lack of income tax, were settling in Jersey in increasing numbers, establishing St Helier as a predominantly English-speaking town.|$|E

5|$|In 1755, Benedict Arnold was <b>attracted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{sound of}} a drummer and {{attempted}} to enlist in the provincial militia for service against the French, but his mother refused permission. In 1757 when he was sixteen, he did enlist in the Connecticut militia, which marched off toward Albany and Lake George. The French had besieged Fort William Henry in northeastern New York, and their Indian allies had committed atrocities after their victory. Word of the siege's disastrous outcome led the company to turn around; Arnold served for 13 days. A commonly accepted story that Arnold deserted from militia service in 1758 is based on uncertain documentary evidence.|$|E

The {{following}} few years saw journeys to Java and Bali‚Äîwhere he was much <b>attracted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> sounds of gamelan ensembles‚Äîand to Australia, where he conducted a performance of his Fourth Symphony in Adelaide. In 1979, with funds available {{from the sale of}} some of his original manuscripts to the British Library, Tippett inaugurated the Michael Tippett Musical Foundation, which provided financial support to young musicians and music education initiatives.|$|E

Her son Lonnie was deemed old enough to make his own decisions, and he chose to remain in Minnesota. Keene took a week to drive from Minnesota to Alaska in a secondhand motorhome, ending in Homer, where she parked the motorhome at the end of Homer Spit in the Homer Spit Campground, where it remained for many years. She took a job at a fish processing facility on the Spit, the Icicle Seafoods subsidiary Seward Fisheries, in the spring of 1977, where she later became a foreman.|$|E
