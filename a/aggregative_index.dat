40|$|This paper {{describes}} interconvertible rules {{between an}} <b>aggregative</b> <b>index</b> like the Laspeyres index and a log-change index like the Tӧrnqvist index. Thus we can compare an <b>aggregative</b> <b>index</b> with a log-change index {{in the same}} form. Using these rules, we formulate the logarithmic difference between the Laspeyres price index and the Tӧrnqvist price index. One of the rules may be combined with another. By using these combined rules, we can change from given weights to other weights in an <b>aggregative</b> <b>index</b> (or a log-change index) of which the value is invariable...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, normal cloud {{model and}} evidential {{reasoning}} (E-R) approach {{is used in}} multiple attribute decision analysis (MADA) problems. Different attributes Belief function are represented by cloud model interval. Using cloud model generating algorithm, belief degree interval is obtained without numerical computation. In addition, it is reasonable and it accords with human’s mind. Evidential reasoning algorithm {{is also used to}} incorporate different attributes interval in different ranks. Maximum and minimum in belief degree interval is computed by software. Then <b>aggregative</b> <b>index</b> number of attribute value is computed. Thing’s rank is decided by the index number. In the example, truck’s integrated performances are analysed. Simulation results further illustrate the effectiveness of the design method...|$|E
40|$|How do prior {{outcomes}} {{affect the}} risk choice? Research on this {{can help people}} to understand investors’ dynamic decisions in financial market. This paper puts forward a new value function. By analyzing the new value function, {{we find that the}} prior gains and losses {{have an impact on the}} form of value function and the current investors’ risk attitude. Then the paper takes the behavior of the whole stock market as the research object, adopts <b>aggregative</b> <b>index</b> number of 14 representative stocks around the world as samples, and establishes a TVRA-GARCH-M model to investigate the influences of prior gains and losses on the current risk attitude. The empirical study indicates that, at the whole market level, prior gains increase people’s current willingness to take risk assert; that is to say, the house money effect exists in the market, while people are more risk aversion following prior losses...|$|E
40|$|Our new {{approach}} to mobility measurement involves separating out the valuation of positions in terms of individual status (using income, social rank, or other criteria) from the issue of movement between positions. The quantification of movement is addressed using a general concept of distance between positions and a parsimonious set of axioms that characterise the distance concept and yield a class of <b>aggregative</b> <b>indices.</b> This class of indices induces a superclass of mobility measures over the different status concepts consistent with the same underlying data. We investigate the statistical inference of mobility indices using two well-known status concepts, related to income mobility and rank mobility. Mobility measures, axiomatic approach, bootstrap. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTo {{effectively}} {{control and}} treat river water pollution, {{it is very}} critical to establish a water quality prediction system. Combined Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN), a hybrid intelligent algorithm is designed to predict river water quality. Firstly, PCA is used to reduce data dimensionality. 23 water quality index factors can be compressed into 15 <b>aggregative</b> <b>indices.</b> PCA improved effectively the training speed of follow-up algorithms. Then, GA optimizes the parameters of BPNN. The average prediction rates of non-polluted and polluted water quality are 88. 9 % and 93. 1 % respectively, the global prediction rate is approximately 91 %. The water quality prediction system based on the combination of Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithms can accurately predict water quality and provide useful support for realtime early warning systems...|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{provides}} an objective basis for selecting {{the best among}} four commonly used price index numbers, namely the Laspeyres price index, the Paasche price <b>index,</b> the simple <b>aggregative</b> price <b>index</b> and the simple arithmetic mean of price relatives. The criterion is developed within a stochastic framework that also enables researchers to test hypotheses about the index numbers themselves. The paper also provides nonparametric interpretations of these indices. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper takes a fresh look, from a macro perspective, at {{the issue}} of aid effectiveness. An {{important}} {{point of departure for}} this study is that it adopts poverty reduction, as contrasted from economic growth, as the metric for measuring aid effectiveness. In conducting the empirical investigation, the paper experiments with a number of different regression equations and uses a new panel dataset on poverty. It shows that aid and aid-squared both have significant coefficients but with different signs (positive for aid and negative for aid-squared). This result suggests that aid is effective when it is relatively moderate but becomes ineffective when the size of aid exceeds the critical value defined by the absorptive capacity. Our results further suggest that while the macro policy environment and the quality of governance have a significant bearing on poverty reduction, aid effectiveness is not critically contingent on them. Aid has on average been effective, our regression results confirm, under a whole variety of circumstances - in terms of policy environments and quality of governance - in a wide diversity of developing countries. It also points to the limited usefulness of using <b>aggregative</b> <b>index</b> of (macroeconomic) policy and governance for policy insights. To derive useful policy insights, one needs to look beyond these aggregates. Hopefully, the present paper, which makes an exploratory first attempt in directly linking poverty reduction (rather than growth) to aid, controlling for a number of macroeconomic policy variables and governance, would inspire further future research effort...|$|E
40|$|Vulnerability {{to extreme}} events is usually {{addressed}} for macro units (districts or provinces) whereas the relative vulnerability of micro units {{may be more}} useful to a policy maker. The present study addresses the vulnerability of coastal villages to cyclones and storm surge risks and identifies the physical and socio-economic factors strongly impacting {{the vulnerability of the}} villages. Rather than using a composite or <b>aggregative</b> <b>index,</b> we define the vulnerability index as the probability of facing non-zero deaths due to severe cyclones and calculate the indexes from a cyclone impact (human casualty) function using both Logit and Poisson specifications. We use human casualty data of the Super cyclone of Oct 1999 in India and other geo-physical and socioeconomic data for the same year and study the 262 villages lying within 10 km of the coast in Kendrapada district, a highly vulnerable district in India. We find 112 to 132 villages qualifying as least vulnerable with a death probability of less than 0. 1; 72 - 82 villages as moderately vulnerable with a death probability ranging between 0. 1 and 0. 3; 34 - 37 villages rated as more vulnerable with a death probability in between 0. 3 to 0. 5; and 21 to 34 villages displaying high vulnerability with a death probability greater than 0. 5. In general, villages established in the mangrove habitat areas after cutting down the forest and the ones with a higher percentage of marginal workers were found to be more vulnerable while those with mangrove vegetation behind them and situated near a big river were seen as being less vulnerable. The results have important implications in identification of the vulnerable or the most vulnerable hotspots in an otherwise vulnerable area.

40|$|This study {{seeks to}} {{establish}} how banking productivity {{is affected by}} taking into account, in addition to loans and deposits, transactions carried out by banks for their customers. We use a panel of data on Desjardins covering the period 1999 - 2002. Two methods are applied to measure productivity growth, that is, {{a variant of the}} standard accounting method used by Statistics Canada based on the Fisher ideal index, and the Malmquist index based on the nonparametric DEA model. We also apply two different methods for determining the price of loans and deposits. The first is the Barnet/Donovan user cost approach which is based on the difference between the effective rate and a reference rate representing the pure cost of the funds borrowed without allowance for risk. The other is the effective interest rate. As a whole, we find that transaction products do not change importantly the productivity growth. The main reason is that these products represent quite a small share in the aggregate output (between 6, 8 % and 21, 4 %). We observe however that the index of productivity based on the Fisher ideal indexes is higher than the <b>aggregative</b> <b>indexes</b> Malmquist for all the studied period. ...|$|R

40|$|Solid {{particles}} {{belonging to}} Geldart Group A, B and D were fluidized in liquids of changing viscosity and in CO 2 under ambient to supercritical conditions. Local bed voidage signals were collected and processed {{in conjunction with}} global expansion characteristics to give quantitative indexes for evaluating fluidization quality. Results showed that the fluidized state changes progressively from aggregative to particulate when fluidized separately by gas, supercritical fluid and liquids, indicating {{an infinite number of}} intermediate states existing between aggregative and particulate fluidization. A discrimination number Dn is proposed to describe the transition from particulate to <b>aggregative.</b> A heterogeneity <b>index</b> delta and a nonideality index f(h) are proposed to quantify, respectively, the local and the global characteristics of the intermediate states.
