5|$|Meanwhile, {{finding a}} {{suitable}} <b>adhesive</b> {{was a significant}} problem. After unsuccessful experiments {{with a variety of}} candidates, somebody suggested birdlime – a viscous sticky compound used since ancient times to trap birds by spreading it on tree branches and waiting for birds to get stuck. Birdlime performed better than anything previously tested, but it was still not good enough. Macrae's tin of birdlime was labelled with a large letter 'K' and an indication that tin came from Stockport but with no more clues as to the manufacturer. Macrae got on a train to Stockport and there found a helpful taxi driver who took him to Kay Brothers Ltd.

40|$|A {{study was}} carried out to test the {{properties}} of oil-palm-shell-based wood <b>adhesives</b> compared with petroleumbased wood <b>adhesives.</b> Shear strength tests for {{both dry and wet}} conditions were done. Besides that, apparent cohesive wood failure tests were also performed to compare the performance of wood bonding between these mentioned <b>adhesives.</b> For the dry test, the bonding performance became better when the formaldehyde to phenol (F/P) ratio increased. For all three different F/P ratios, the petroleum-based <b>adhesives</b> showed the best bonding performance. However, the wood bonding performance of oil-palm-shell-based <b>adhesives</b> was comparable with that of the petroleum-based <b>adhesives.</b> Meanwhile, for the wet test, the bonding performance became better when the F/P ratio increased and the best bonding performance was given by the petroleumbased <b>adhesives</b> with F/P ratios = 1. 2 and 1. 5. However, it was obvious that the performance of 50 % oilpalm- shell-based <b>adhesives</b> was better than that of the petroleum-based <b>adhesives</b> at F/P ratio = 2. 0. For apparent cohesive wood failure, the F/P = 2. 0 group of samples and the petroleum-based <b>adhesives</b> gave the highest wood failure for all the compositions of <b>adhesives.</b> The commercial potentiality of this research is very high as the oil-palm-shell-based <b>adhesives</b> can replace the petroleum-based <b>adhesives...</b>|$|R

5|$|Females vacate {{the nest}} after spawning, leaving the male behind {{to protect the}} eggs during the eight to ten days of incubation. A nest may contain 2,000 to 5,000 eggs, {{possibly}} more. Fecundity is usually related to size of the fish, so it isn't unusual for the roe of a large gravid female to contain over 55,000 eggs. Bowfin eggs are <b>adhesive,</b> and will attach to aquatic vegetation, roots, gravel, and sand. After hatching, larval bowfin do not swim actively in search of food. During the seven to nine days required for yolk-sac absorption, they attach to vegetation {{by means of an}} <b>adhesive</b> organ on their snout, and remain protected by the parent male bowfin. Bowfin aggressively protect their spawn from the first day of incubation to a month or so after the eggs have hatched. When the fry are able to swim and forage on their own, they will form a school and leave the nest accompanied by the parent male bowfin who slowly circles them to prevent separation.|$|E
