5|$|The {{climate of}} Buenos Aires is {{dominated}} by the semi–permanent South Atlantic High throughout the year. This brings in moist winds from the northeast, which brings most of the precipitation to the city. During winter, it brings in frontal systems responsible for precipitation in the city. In autumn and summer, it produces storms that are generally located north of the city and produces strong winds from the south or southeast that can occasionally lead to the swelling of the Río de la Plata, flooding coastal areas. The South Pacific High is the origin of polar air masses that are responsible for the coldest temperatures and result in clear and very dry conditions. These air masses originate from the South Pacific high and move in a northeastern direction during winter towards Buenos Aires by passing. Although it is polar maritime (this is a cool, moist air mass that forms from oceans located in the subarctic and arctic regions at the southern tip of South America), it becomes modified as it passes over the South American continent, becoming drier as it arrives at Buenos Aires. This is because as the cold air masses from the South Pacific High move over the Pacific Ocean and the Andes and reach the land south of 35oS (where the Andes are shorter in height), <b>anticyclogenesis</b> leads to the formation of a strong high pressure system {{in the center of the}} country (at around 40oS). This high pressure system brings cold and dry, polar continental air masses to Buenos Aires. Cold fronts are more common during winter than in summer as the South Atlantic and South Pacific highs are at their southernmost positions during summer, making it difficult for cold fronts to enter.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the year, the South Pacific High {{influences}} the climate by bringing cold, moist air masses originating from Patagonia. During {{the most intense}} cold waves, they form when a transient high pressure system located in the South Pacific Ocean moves eastwards to {{the southern tip of}} South America. As it begins to move, this high pressure system strengthens the South Pacific High and is forced to move southwards to south of 40oS where the Andes are shorter in height. As well, an upper level ridge forms over the South Pacific Ocean along with an upper level trough extending from subtropical latitudes to the South Atlantic Ocean. At the same time, a low pressure system forms over the South Atlantic Ocean which eventually strengthens. The formation a cold front associated with it moves to the northeast owing to the topographic barrier that the Andes forms. The passage of the cold front to the northeast leads to the movement of the high pressure system from the South Pacific Ocean into the southern tip of South America. All of these conditions lead to strong <b>anticyclogenesis</b> to the east of the Andes and thus, the high pressure system intensifies as it enters southern Argentina. When both the high pressure system (over southern Argentina) and low pressure system strengthen, it creates a very strong pressure gradient that draws cold air from the south, strengthening southerly winds. Owing to the topographic barrier of the Andes, it forces and channels the cold air to accumulate on {{the eastern side of the}} Andes. This generates an ageostropic component from the south (due to a reduction in the Coriolis force caused by accumulation of cold air on the eastern side of the Andes) that draw this cold air northwards, which is driven by this pressure gradient. Cold air can move northwards until 18oS when the blocking effect of the Andes is smaller due to a change in its orientation. Overall, these conditions results in the coldest temperatures due to the cold masses from high latitudes being pulled northwards. A weaker cold wave occurs when the South Pacific High remains over the ocean and does not have a migratory high pressure system originating from the South Pacific High that moves east of the Andes (it builds over the Andes). Although this occurs throughout the year, during winters, it leads to cold temperatures while during summer, it leads to strong and deep convections. These convections are responsible for about 50% of summer precipitation south of 25oS.|$|E

50|$|Polar {{outbreaks}}: Polar outbreaks {{occur when}} cold dense polar air masses pass beneath warmer tropical air masses, significantly cooling subtropical South America. They {{occur as a}} result of <b>anticyclogenesis</b> in the Pacific subtropical high, which is constrained at a low level by the southern extent of the Andes mountain range. This leads to the formation of a slow-moving long wave that creates mountain-parallel, ageostrophic flow, causing incursions of high-latitude cold air. They generate an important drop in temperature and increase in pressure, resulting in regional precipitation for southern South America. These surges occur mainly during the winter but their impact on the precipitation is even greater during summer.|$|E
50|$|The majority, and the strongest, of {{the winds}} are from the {{south-west}} and north-east as Atlantic depressions pass from west to east over the United Kingdom. When an Atlantic depression reaches the United Kingdom, winds usually blow from the south or south-west, and they change to west or north-west when the depression leaves. If a depression passes along the English Channel, strong winds can occur from the east or north-east. Due to <b>anticyclogenesis</b> over Scandinavia, the majority of winds in Spring are from the north-east.

It {{is the opposite of}} anticyclolysis, and has a cyclonic equivalent—cyclogenesis. [...] Anticyclones are alternatively referred to as high pressure systems. High pressure areas form due to downward motion through the troposphere, the atmospheric layer where weather occurs. Preferred areas within a synoptic flow pattern in higher levels of the troposphere are beneath the western side of troughs. On weather maps, these areas show converging winds (isotachs), also known as confluence, or converging height lines near or above the level of non-divergence, which is near the 500 hPa pressure surface about midway up through the troposphere. [...] On weather maps, high pressure centers are associated with the letter H. [...] On constant pressure upper level charts, it is located within the highest height line contour.|$|E
50|$|Westerlies: South America {{experiences}} westerly winds in {{the middle}} latitudes, caused by the Coriolis force and associated geostrophic circulation patterns. They are more intense than their Northern Hemisphere counterparts {{due to the lack}} of continental landmass in the Southern Hemisphere. They reach their maximum speed in the troposphere, where they form jetstreams. In particular, over the southern tip of South America and the adjacent south Pacific, the westerlies are strongest during austral summer, peaking between 45° and 55°S. During the austral winter, the jetstream moves into subtropical latitudes (its axis is at about 30°S) and the low-level westerlies expand equatorward but weaken, particularly at ~50°S. The pressure gradients between the polar low-pressure belt and the Pacific high-pressure cell, combined with these westerlies, results in permanent <b>anticyclogenesis.</b> Northward penetration of atmospheric perturbations from the westerlies is possible when the southeast Pacific anticyclone is weakened or moves equatorward, allowing penetration of westerly storm tracks to latitudes as far north as 31◦S. In the Andes, winter rains reach further north. During summer, the Pacific anticyclone shifts southward, impeding the northward migration of the westerlies.|$|E
50|$|The final {{storm of}} the season {{developed}} from unknown origins, {{although there is a}} possibility that <b>anticyclogenesis</b> over Mexico that occurred after the dissipation of Simone may have played a part in the formation. When it was first noticed in satellite pictures on October 20 while 300 mi southwest of Acapulco, it was estimated to have already been a tropical storm with 60 mph (100 km/h), a peak intensity that was later downgraded in best track data to 50 mph (85 km/h). The same picture also showed a compact central dense overcast, a large mass of deep convection, spanning three degrees of latitude, cirrus outflow, and loose banding features. For the next two days, the center of circulation of Tropical Storm Tara became better defined while slowly growing larger. The intensifying Tara moved to the west at 12 mi/h km/h to 14 mi/h km/h before turning to the west-northwest at 12 mi/h km/h on October 23. At the time of the west-northwest turn, satellite pictures picked up a separation of the cirrus cap, causing the storm to weaken. The system lasted as a weak tropical storm until October 27, when it was determined to have weakened to a depression, although the possibility exists that it had been a depression for days. The depression dissipated the next day.|$|E

40|$|Meteorological {{assessment}} of dangerous wildfire environments has traditionally involved {{the identification of}} specific synoptic weather patterns empirically determined {{to be associated with}} wildfire development and spread. Specifically, in the Great Lakes region, high wildfire danger is often witnessed in association with 500 hPa ridges and surface high pressure systems. Such synoptic scale flow is regularly associated with large scale subsidence, adiabatic warming, drying of mid-tropospheric air from mid-levels as well as surface <b>anticyclogenesis.</b> In this thesis the notion that the 3 -D circulations associated with surface <b>anticyclogenesis</b> can play important roles in promoting wildfire development and spread is advanced through observations and interrogation of the output from numerical model simulations of four large fires in the western Great Lakes region. This 3 -D flow begins downstream of upper level ridge axes and provides: 1) large scale subsidence and drying that leads to the development of reservoirs of dry air just above the Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL), 2) the associated clockwise circulations that provide the means to advect the subsided air toward the fire environment.

40|$|We {{identify}} {{physical processes}} and localized atmospheric structures that modulate the global-scale atmospheric available potential energy (APE). A 1979 [...] 95 time series of Northern Hemisphere APE {{is derived from}} the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis. We discern an average three-day cycle in the APE depletion rate dA/dt with a time series of intraseasonal (1. 6 [...] 180 -day) fluctuations. Synoptic-scale APE depletion events are falls and subsequent rises in dA/dt, and are classified as APE collapses when exceeding climatologically-derived thresholds of APE fall and dA/dt. Three associated regional baroclinic waves are observed. West Pacific warm surges (Type A) accompany cyclogenesis over Japan, <b>anticyclogenesis</b> over the west-central North Pacific, and shallow East Asian cold surges. Bering warm surges (Type B) comprise intense southerly flow across the Bering Strait, cyclogenesis near the Kamchatka Peninsula, and intense <b>anticyclogenesis</b> over Alaska. Atlantic Canada warm surges (Type C) include onshore warm flow and eastern North American storm tracks. January/February 1989 brought the largest vacillation- and synoptic-scale APE collapses of the study period. A pronounced Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) modulated equatorial convection over the Indian Ocean during the APE build-up. The initial APE collapse coincided with Type A development and intensifying MJO convection shifting to the West Pacific warm pool, which was prominent because of the 1988 [...] 89 La Nina. Extensive large-scale ascent amplified the thermally direct Hadley cell circulation, with descent strong over East Asia. The second collapse was associated with Type B development characterized by a record-breaking Alaska anticyclone. Factors explaining lacking precision in energy budget calculations include missing o values above 100 hPa, limited representation of subgrid processes, and limited temporal resolution of diurnal convection over tropical landmasses. Correlation analysis shows baroclinic conversion (diabatic generation) accounting for 80 % (20 %) of vacillation-scale dA/dt fluctuations. Baroclinic conversion contributes considerably (69 %) to the synoptic variability only during synoptic-scale APE collapses (23 January to 4 February), illustrating the prominence of resolvable baroclinic processes during these periods...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Some new {{evidence}} that the weather is influenced by solar activity is reviewed. It appears that the solar magnetic sector structure {{is related to the}} circulation of the Earth's atmosphere during local winter. About 3 t days after the passage of a sector boundary the maximum effect is seen; apparently the height of all pressure surfaces increases in high latitudes leading to <b>anticyclogenesis,</b> whereas at midlatitudes the height of the pressure surfaces decreases leading to low pressure systems or to deepening of existing systems. This later effect is clearly seen as an increase {{in the area of the}} base of air with absolute vorticity exceeding a given treshold. Since the increase of geomagnetic activity generally is small at a sector boundary it is speculated that geomagnetic activity as such is not the cause of the response to the sector structure but that both weather and geomagnetic activity are influenced by the same (unknown) mechanism. 1...|$|E

40|$|The {{central theme}} of this project has been the {{diagnosis}} of blocking <b>anticyclogenesis</b> and the corresponding interactions with synoptic-scale circulations. To that end an extensive investigation of the dynamics and energetics of a major blocking anticyclone and two upstream cyclones, all of which occurred over the North Atlantic Ocean and the United States in January 1979, was undertaken. Data for the study were provided by Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres (GLA) 4 LAT by 5 LON FGGE analyses. The methodology has primarily focused on the diagnosis of circulation forcing mechanisms using the modified forms (referred to as the extended forms) of the height tendency and Zwack-Okossi equations developed by our research group. Calculations use routine second-order finite differencing with boundary layer fraction and sensible heating and latent heat release represented as parameterized quantities. Of particular interest are the latent heat release estimates, which combine convectional parameterized values with estimates derived from satellite IR data.

In this setting, the variables are sequences of k spatial fields of a given meteorological variable. PSPA is described and applied to a sample of 256 consecutive daily 1000 hPa geopotential height fields. The results of the application of the technique to 5 -day sequences demonstrate the advantages of this procedure in identifying field pattern sequences, thereby allowing the determination of the evolution and development of the systems, together with cyclogenesis and <b>anticyclogenesis</b> processes. In order to complete the study, the more traditional Extended Empirical Orthogonal Function (EEOF) analysis, which is the S-mode equivalent of the PSPA, was applied to the same dataset. For EEOF, it was not possible to identify any real sequences that could correspond to the sequences of patterns yielded by the EEOF. Furthermore, the explained variance distribution in the EEOF was significantly different from that obtained with PSPA. Conversely, the PSPA approach allowed for the identification of the sequences corresponding to those sequences observed in the data. Using diagrams of the squares of the component loadings values, as a function of time, the study of the times of occurrence of dominant field characteristics was also possible. In other words, successful determination of periods where the basic flow was dominant and times when strongly perturbed transient events with a significant meridional component occurred, was facilitated by PSPA.

40|$|A ground {{blizzard}} occurred from 16 to 18 November 1996 in {{the northern}} sectors of the Mackenzie River basin of Canada and the adjacent Beaufort Sea. This hazardous event, accompanied by a low-level jet with wind speeds approaching 20 m s 21 and extensive blowing snow near the surface (but clear sky aloft), is forced by a strong sea level pressure gradient that forms between a rapidly intensifying anticyclone over the Nunavut and Northwest Territories of Canada and an intense depression over the frozen Arctic Ocean. The event is first simulated at a horizontal grid size of 18 km using the uncoupled Canadian Mesoscale Compressible Community (MC 2) model. This experiment is shown to capture the rapid <b>anticyclogenesis</b> event within 2 hPa of its central sea level pressure and the blizzard conditions near the Canadian Arctic coastline and the Beaufort Sea. Mete-orological conditions observed at Trail Valley Creek (TVC), a small Arctic tundra watershed in which ground blizzard conditions were experienced during the event, are also accurately reproduced by the uncoupled simulation with the notable exception of the blowing snow process. Thus, the mesoscale model is then coupled to the ‘‘PIEKTUK’ ’ blowing snow model, and a second simulation is conducted. This additional experiment reveals the presence of extensive blowing snow associated with a strong low-level jet over TVC and the adjacent frozen Beaufort Sea. Over the 2 -day event, blowing snow sublimation and transport combined to erode 1. 6 mm snow water equivalent from the surface mass balance of TVC. The concurrent moistening and cooling of near-surface air due to blowing snow sublimation emerge during the blizzard but {{to a lesser extent}} than in an idealized modeling framework, as a consequence of entrainment and advective processes. Therefore, blowing snow sub-limation rates are evaluated to be 1. 8 times larger than in the stand-alone application of the PIEKTUK model to the same data. 1...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the climatological, large-scale, and synoptic-scale aspects of South American cold surges using NCEP-NCAR gridded reanalyses for the 1992 - 96 period. Three common cold surge types are identified {{on the basis}} of a thickness (1000 - 850 hPa) criteria: type 1 —a transient surge associated with weak anticyclone development east of the Andes in the absence of ridging aloft, type 2 —a strong and persistent surge associated with dynamic <b>anticyclogenesis</b> aloft and strong surface anticyclone development east of the Andes, and type 3 —a surge east of the Brazilian coastal mountains. Cold surges are most common during the winter and spring (Jun-Nov), accounting for 189 of the 256 events (74 %). Case studies of two events (19 - 22 Jul 1992 and 12 - 14 Apr 1993) are conducted from both a conventional isobaric and a potential vorticity (PV) perspective. The upper-air flow pattern in the July 1992 type 2 case is characterized by the presence of a strong ridge-trough couplet, which amplifies and becomes quasi-stationary, allowing for a deep layer of equatorward flow over South America. Dynamically, this flow pattern favors the development of a very strong surface anticyclone to the east of the Andes in response to a combination of differential anticyclonic vorticity advection, low-level cold advection, and, equivalently, positive PV advection. Because of the associated cold air damming east of the Andes, modified cool air is transported into the western part of Amazonia. Cold air damming east of the Brazilian coastal mountains is associated with the transition of the July 1992 type 2 surge into a type 3 surge. The cold surge of April 1993 is examined as a rare event that does not fit the above classification. It is characterized by explosive cyclogenesis close to the coast of Argentina. Unlike the representative type 2 cold surge of July 1992, which tends to occur in association with southwesterly flow aloft, the April 1993 cold surge occurs beneath westerly and northwesterly flow aloft. Cold air penetration into lower latitudes is restricted because the geostrophic wind has a component directed away from the Andes equatorward of the cyclone. The dynamical forcing mechanisms associated with the April 1993 event are of smaller scale than those of the much more common surges typified by the July 1992 event...|$|E
