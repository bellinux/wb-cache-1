In the charges, the EPA noted that the creamery twice certified that it had developed the RMP plan, once in 1999 and again in 2004.

Hershey Creamery complied and in April 2007 submitted the appropriate RMPs, which were confirmed to be in-place through subsequent inspection.

The {{object of}} this study is to evaluate recent advances in the use of <b>anhydrous</b> and aqua <b>ammonia</b> as nitrogenous fertilisers, with emphasis on the prospects and needs there are for their usage in New Zealand. There is at present a large dependence on New Zealand made organic and imported artificial fertilisers which are mostly low analysis materials. These nitrogenous fertilisers, with their low nitrogen content, have a high cost per pound of nitrogen. <b>Anhydrous</b> and aqua <b>ammonia</b> are high analysis materials whose use could prove worthwhile in this country on the grounds of economy and practicability. An appraisal of these prospects would appear to offer advantages in the development of horticulture (and agriculture) in New Zealand. Part I deals with the aspects of nitrogen in the soil and in plants. This introduces the trends in nitrogenous fertilisers and usage of the various forms, particularly <b>anhydrous</b> and aqua <b>ammonia.</b> Also dealt with is the history of nitrogenous fertilisers. Part II illustrates the usage of ammonia as a fertiliser. The manufacture, use for crops, equipment and basic economics are discussed, with a view to demonstrating that <b>anhydrous</b> and aqua <b>ammonia</b> fertilisers have been shown to be both efficient and very economical fertilisers overseas. Part III deals with the position in New Zealand. The types of nitrogen fertilisers used and the economic aspects of their usage.

40|$|Abstract Background In {{converting}} biomass to bioethanol, pretreatment {{is a key}} step {{intended to}} render cellulose more amenable and accessible to cellulase enzymes and thus increase glucose yields. In this study, four cellulose samples with different degrees of polymerization and crystallinity indexes were subjected to aqueous sodium hydroxide and <b>anhydrous</b> liquid <b>ammonia</b> treatments. The effects of the treatments on cellulose crystalline structure were studied, {{in addition to the}} effects on the digestibility of the celluloses by a cellulase complex. Results From X-ray diffractograms and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra, it was revealed that treatment with liquid ammonia produced the cellulose III I allomorph; however, crystallinity depended on treatment conditions. Treatment at a low temperature (25 °C) resulted in a less crystalline product, whereas treatment at elevated temperatures (130 °C or 140 °C) gave a more crystalline product. Treatment of cellulose I with aqueous sodium hydroxide (16. 5 percent by weight) resulted in formation of cellulose II, but also produced a much less crystalline cellulose. The relative digestibilities of the different cellulose allomorphs were tested by exposing the treated and untreated cellulose samples to a commercial enzyme mixture (Genencor-Danisco; GC 220). The digestibility results showed that the starting cellulose I samples were the least digestible (except for corn stover cellulose, which had a high amorphous content). Treatment with sodium hydroxide produced the most digestible cellulose, followed by treatment with liquid ammonia at a low temperature. Factor analysis indicated that initial rates of digestion (up to 24 hours) were most strongly correlated with amorphous content. Correlation of allomorph type with digestibility was weak, but was strongest with cellulose conversion at later times. The cellulose III I samples produced at higher temperatures had comparable crystallinities to the initial cellulose I samples, but achieved higher levels of cellulose conversion, at longer digestion times. Conclusions Earlier studies have focused on determining which cellulose allomorph is the most digestible. In this study we have found that the chemical treatments to produce different allomorphs also changed the crystallinity of the cellulose, and this had a significant effect on the digestibility of the substrate. When determining the relative digestibilities of different cellulose allomorphs it is essential to also consider the relative crystallinities of the celluloses being tested. </p...|$|R
