40|$|Risers are {{flexible}} multilayered pipes {{formed by}} an inner flexible metal structure surrounded by polymer layers and spiral wound steel ligaments, {{also known as}} armor wires. Since these risers are used to link subsea pipelines to floating {{oil and gas production}} installations, and their failure could produce catastrophic consequences, some methods have been proposed to monitor the armor integrity. However, until now there is no practical method that allows the automatic non-destructive detection of individual <b>armor</b> <b>wire</b> rupture. In this work we show a method using magnetic Barkhausen noise that has shown high efficiency in the detection of <b>armor</b> <b>wire</b> rupture. The results are examined under the cyclic and static load conditions of the riser. This work also analyzes the theory behind the singular dependence of the magnetic Barkhausen noise on the applied tension in riser armor wires.

40|$|As it is known, {{different}} {{maintenance and}} rehabilitation activities are conducted in oil & gas wells {{so as to}} ensure optimal flow rate, recovery volume, well safety and integrity. In doing all these activities, well intervention companies are highly dependent on the performance and reliability of wireline cables. However, senior technical people at Altus Intervention (formerly called Aker Well Service) have identified {{the presence of a}} miss-match between the performance of the currently available wireline cables (specially the 5 / 16 ″ - monoconductor cable) and the demand of a well intervention task as wells goes deeper, deviated, and acidic. For these reasons, the company has initiated this project work so as to look for the improvement potential of the currently used monoconductor cables. In order to pinpoint the limitations of the currently used cables, I have conducted a thorough discussion with senior technical people at Altus Intervention, extracted relevant information and data from the company’s Synergy page, participated in different wireline training courses, and also conduct relevant literature review. Overall, the inherent limitations of the currently used 5 / 16 ″ cables are found to originate from their limited strength, relatively heavy weight, integrity of the insulation material, and poor H 2 S resistance of the steel (high strength version) armor. Moreover, operational related problems such as gas breakthrough, development of kinks and bird nesting, and also the cost of corrosion resistance grades of the cable are found to be leading problems. Thus, formulating a new design approach so as to address these limitations either fully or partially was the main theme of this project work. In an attempt to solve these limitations, I have used a new design approach which effectively combines high strength Kevlar® 49 fiber with abrasion resistance and electrical conducting steel <b>armor</b> <b>wire.</b> The new approach is found to have a higher prospect towards reducing the cable weight, improving the breaking strength, fatigue life, and alleviating short circuiting and other common problems of the currently used 5 / 16 "- monoconductor cables. Furthermore, the conformance of the new concept cable to the harsh well environment, working condition, and operational demand of the well intervention task is also investigated using scientific data, mathematical modeling, software simulation, and other techniques. Though all the results found are highly encouraging, I strongly recommend the development of a prototype cable and undertake all the relevant tests so as to review the conformance of the new cable to the actual working condition. Developing a tailored inspection technique for this concept cable and also extending the concept towards other cable grades are identified as continuation works of this project work. Furthermore, the possibility of finding non-steel based but abrasion resistance materials so as to fully replace the entire <b>armor</b> <b>wire</b> is also sighted as possible and fascinating research topic as this further helps to reduce the cable weight...|$|E

40|$|A {{flexible}} riser {{operating in}} deep water will experience large environmental forces. Due {{to the length of}} the riser, dynamic tension from drag forces will be substantial. The tensile force is transferred directly into the end fitting, and fatigue damage may be critical at this point. In addition, the large hydrostatic pressure at the ocean floor may induce compressive stresses in the tensile armor, something this component is not designed for. In connection with these challenges, this thesis deals with two different phenomenons relevant for deep water risers: Local stresses in tensile armor wires at the end fitting due to contraint effects. Radial and lateral buckling of tensile armor wires. The first part of this report, section 2 and 3, {{is the result of a}} literature study regarding flexible pipe technology, failure modes and design criteria with special focus on those relevant for deep water applications. In section 4, theory important to the thesis work is presented. This includes analytical methods for stress analysis of flexible pipes, theory of thin curved beams, basic theory of restrained warping and finite element methods. In the last part of section 4, a new curved beam element for the nonlinear finite element program Aflex is presented. A central part of the thesis work has been to implement this new element into the original Aflex code. The element has rotational degrees of freedom about the bi-normal direction in addition to the degrees of freedom included in the original Aflex code. Hence, the element is capable of investigating both radial and lateral buckling modes. The element has also been implemented in a special version of the Bflex 2010 computer program. Section 5 is dedicated to analyses of stresses in tensile armor wires at the end fitting. The load case considered is axial straining of the pipe, which leads to a small change in lay angle. As the wires are restrained at the end fitting, a change in lay angle will not be allowed, and this constraint will induce local stresses. First, analytical calculations neglecting friction between the <b>armor</b> <b>wire</b> and supporting layer are performed for different wire dimensions. Next, the new curved beam element is used for numerical analyses of the same cases, and the transverse bending stress at the end fixation is studied for varying friction coeffcients. Both analytical and numerical results show that the relative magnitude of the local transverse bending stress increases as the axial straining of the pipe increase. As an example, the bending stress is found to exceed 16 % of the nominal axial stress when the axial stress is 400 MPa, for a flexible pipe including two tensile armor layers and a friction coeffcient of 0. 15. Section 6 deals with different buckling modes for tensile armor wires. Three different modes are presented, namely radial failure due to anti buckling tape rupture, radial elastic buckling and lateral buckling. Analytical formulas for predicting the capacity with respect to all three modes are established, and governing physical effects are discussed. Numerical analyses with the new curved beam element are performed, and the results are compared to the analytical solutions. It is found that the first radial failure mode is determined primarily by the strength of the anti buckling tape, while the elasticity of the tape is critical to the second radial mode. Comparison between the analytical solutions and finite element results indicate that the radial failure modes are accurately predicted by both methods. The lateral buckling capacity is more diffcult to predict, as the behaviour is dominated by friction forces, and the stick-slip transition. However, analytical and numerical results all indicate a strong dependence upon friction coeffcient and pipe curvature. The finite element model reports the lowest capacity, and these results are also believed to be the most accurate due to the more realistic modelling of friction. A smaller investigation of the lateral buckling capacity under cyclic curvature is done with the FE model, and it is found that buckling of tensile armor wires may occur after a number of curvature cycles even if the combination of stress and curvature is significantly lower than critical in static curvature conditions. The results from these analyses are unfortunately somewhat unclear, as they were found to be slightly influenced by the numerical parameters defining the friction springs. Nevertheless it is concluded that lateral buckling may occur as a result of gradual transverse slip under cyclic curvature conditions, and that this may happen for curvatures in the vicinity of 0. 1 m − 1 combined with a compressive stress in the <b>armor</b> <b>wire</b> equal to 300 MPa, given a friction coefficient of 0. 15.  </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of offshore fields has reached large water depths, and hence more challenges are met in design of offshore systems. The large water depths challenge the designer {{in terms of}} high temperature and pressure in complex reservoirs in addition to extreme environmental conditions. Pipelines and risers are normally designed for a service life of 20 – 25 years. For some oil fields, the average service life of a riser is only 50 % of its planned service life. Hence, {{it is important to}} perform extensive global and local analyses to provide a desirable service life of the riser system. One of the main topics that should be evaluated thoroughly is the fatigue damage of the riser. By performing local fatigue analyses, the fatigue life can be determined and so also a desirable service life. Fatigue is mainly a condition of structural damage that occurs {{as a result of a}} cyclic loading. When looking at fatigue of flexible risers, the cyclic loading is initiated by environmental loads causing movement of the floater and hence induces dynamic loading on the riser. The intersection between the riser and the floater is then one of the most vulnerable area for fatigue, depending on floater type, riser system, etc. When evaluating fatigue life of a flexible unbonded riser, the expected life of the pipe structural layers is found. The main focus is on the tensile armor and pressure armor layers, as they are generally exposed to fatigue failure and known to limit the service life of the pipe. As of today, there are no recognized, well-defined mathematical methods to calculate aging of the plastic layers in the cross-section. Hence; this is not discussed further in the thesis. Typically, the hang-off area must be protected from over-bending so additional devices are added. A common choice is to use a bend stiffener, which is a device that contributes to a moment transition between the riser and the end connection on the floater. The most common approach for evaluation of the fatigue life of a riser, is by making use of S–N curves and Minor summation method. Each layer of the riser cross-section has its own material properties, and hence its own S–N curve. The Minor summation method provides a failure criterion for the fatigue damage, and this should be fulfilled to gain a suitable riser configuration. A basic procedure of fatigue assessment is provided by DNV, DNV-RP-F 204 : Define fatigue loading Identify locations to be assessed Global riser fatigue analysis Local stress analysis Identify fatigue strength data Fatigue analysis Further actions if too short fatigue life Global analyses are performed to establish extreme interface loads during operation and long term distribution of fatigue loads for the deep-water riser application. In the global extreme analysis carried out in this thesis, it is found that near position of the vessel contribute to the highest maximum tension in addition to compression of the riser at touch down point, TDP. The far position normally cause highest value of top tension since this is where the riser is stretched the most. The curvature obtained in the analysis show a high result at the TDP, which has been found unacceptable in comparison with the minimum-bending radius, MBR. Even though the curvature result is unacceptable, it may be a result of numerical errors in the computations. Thus, the extreme analysis should be evaluated more thoroughly and optimizations of the riser configuration should be carried out. The highest and lowest results of tension in combination with bending angle found from the global extreme analysis are applied for the bend stiffener design. In the bend stiffener design, maximum shear force is applied. The maximum shear force is found for far position of the vessel. When the initial design of the bend stiffener is found by applying the shear force with accompanying bending angle, the design should then be verified by local analysis. Two cases are evaluated, where maximum bending angle in combination with maximum and minimum tension for the specific load case are applied. The verification has been done in terms of curvature and stress distribution along the riser in the bend stiffener area. The curvature is distributed with small values at the root of the riser and at the intersection between the bend stiffener and the riser. All stresses found for the riser cross-section are acceptable with reference to design criterion given by ISO 13628 - 2. The global analysis performed to establish long term distribution of fatigue loads, provides time series of maximum top tension and bending angles for the riser. The results obtained are applied in fatigue analysis of the structural layers of the riser, with focus on the bend stiffener area and the first tensile armor layer. The fatigue analysis is based on longitudinal failure mode, with evaluation in reference to the failure criterion of fatigue damage found in DNV-RP-F 204. Sixteen different cases, with different combinations of wave height, period and direction, are assessed. Maximum fatigue damage was found for the same node in each case, and evaluated based on a safety-factor of 10. By summation of the individual fatigue damage the total fatigue damage was found to exceed the damage criterion. Even though the criterion is not fulfilled, it is important to know that no optimization of the configuration has been carried out. A parametric study has been performed to outline the effect on stress level in the bend stiffener area. Temperature variation in the annulus of the riser and change of material properties has been assessed. The variation of temperature in the annulus of the riser resulted in a small increase of the stresses in the structural layers of the cross-section. However, the increased stresses obtained did not exceed the design criterion for the tensile <b>armor</b> <b>wire.</b> Fatigue damage has been evaluated for change of temperature. An overall increase of the fatigue damage was found, and as for the base case, the failure criterion was exceeded. The change from non-linear to linear material resulted in a decrease of the stress level in the bend stiffener area. Fatigue damage was not evaluated for this case. </p...|$|E

The {{presence of these}} more aggressive environments {{has led to the}} development of new technologies. Due to the construction characteristics of flexible pipes, any increase in CO 2 concentration in the conveyed fluid will, in turn, increase the CO 2 concentration in the pipe annulus, subjecting the metallic armor layers to a more aggressive environment.
