5|$|Colonization with H. pylori is not {{a disease}} in and of itself, but a {{condition}} associated {{with a number of}} disorders of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Testing for H. pylori is recommended if peptic ulcer disease or low-grade gastric MALT lymphoma is present, after endoscopic resection of early gastric cancer, first-degree relatives with gastric cancer, and in certain cases of dyspepsia, not routinely. Several ways of testing exist. One can test noninvasively for H. pylori infection with a blood <b>antibody</b> <b>test,</b> stool antigen test, or with the carbon urea breath test (in which the patient drinks 14C—or 13C-labelled urea, which the bacterium metabolizes, producing labelled carbon dioxide that can be detected in the breath). Also, a urine ELISA test with a 96% sensitivity and 79% specificity is available. None of the test methods is completely failsafe. Even biopsy is dependent on the location of the biopsy. Blood antibody tests, for example, range from 76% to 84% sensitivity. Some drugs can affect H. pylori urease activity and give false negatives with the urea-based tests. The most accurate method for detecting H. pylori infection is with a histological examination from two sites after endoscopic biopsy, combined with either a rapid urease test or microbial culture.|$|E

5000|$|The {{accuracy}} of saliva anti-HIV <b>antibody</b> <b>testing</b> {{has been demonstrated}} in numerous studies; two recent large-scale studies found both sensitivity and specificity to be 100%.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the performance of}} cell-based and <b>antibody</b> blood <b>tests</b> for the antemortem diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) in South American camelids (SAC). The sensitivity and specificity of the gamma interferon (IFN-) release assay, two lateral flow rapid <b>antibody</b> <b>tests</b> (Stat-Pak and Dual Path Platform [DPP]), and two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) -based <b>antibody</b> <b>tests</b> (Idexx and Enferplex) were determined using diseased alpacas fromMycobacterium bovis culture-confirmed breakdown herds and TB-free alpacas from geographical areas with no history of bovine TB, respectively. Our results show that while the sensitivities of the IFN- and <b>antibody</b> <b>tests</b> were similar (range of 57. 7 % to 66. 7 %), the specificity of the IFN- test (89. 1 %) was {{lower than those of}} any of the <b>antibody</b> <b>tests</b> (range of 96. 4 % to 97. 4 %). This lower specificity of the IFN- test was at least in part due to undisclosedMycobacteriummicroti infection in the TB-free cohort, which stimulates a positive purified protein de-rivative (PPD) response. The sensitivity of infection detection could be increased by combining two <b>antibody</b> <b>tests,</b> but even the use of all four <b>antibody</b> <b>tests</b> failed to detect all diseased alpacas. These antibody-negative alpacas were IFN- positive. We found that the maximum sensitivity could be achieved only by the combination of the IFN- <b>test</b> with two <b>antibody</b> <b>tests</b> in a “test package, ” although this resulted in decreased specificity. The data from this evaluation of tests with defined sensitivity and speci-ficity provide potential options for antemortem screening of SAC for TB in herd breakdown situations and could also find appli...|$|R

[...] Nevertheless, he still disagrees with the scientific consensus, and maintains that people infected with HIV only develop AIDS if exposed to cofactors such as other viruses and bacteria. He suggests that in many people HIV lies dormant without provoking a sufficient immune response to generate a positive <b>antibody</b> <b>test</b> result (seroconversion).|$|E

40|$|HIV <b>antibody</b> <b>testing</b> {{is a key}} {{measure of}} HIV {{prevention}} for {{men who have sex}} with men (MSM). The World Health Organization recommends sexually active and at-risk MSM to take up HIV <b>antibody</b> <b>testing</b> regularly. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of behavioral intention to take up HIV <b>antibody</b> <b>testing</b> in the next six months among Hong Kong MSM who were ever-testers. An anonymous cross-sectional survey recruited 326 MSM who had taken up HIV <b>antibody</b> <b>testing</b> from gay-friendly venues and internet in Hong Kong. Of the participants, 40. 8 % had had unprotected anal intercourse with regular or non-regular male sex partners in the last six months; they were at risk of HIV transmission despite experience in HIV <b>antibody</b> <b>testing.</b> Only 37. 2 % showed a strong intention to take up HIV <b>antibody</b> <b>testing</b> again in the next six months. Adjusted analysis showed that both perceived discrimination toward Hong Kong MSM (AOR =. 60, 95 % CI:. 36 -. 98) and the CARE Measure assessing perceived empathy of service providers (AOR = 1. 05, 95 % CI: 1. 02 - 1. 08) were significantly associated with intention for retesting. Perceived discrimination, however, became statistically non-significant (AOR =. 68, 95 % CI:. 41 - 1. 14), when both CARE Measure and perceived discrimination entered into the adjusted model. It is warranted to increase HIV retesting rate by removing perceived discrimination and reducing the negative effect of perceived discrimination through enhancement of empathy of service providers...|$|R
2500|$|An <b>antibody</b> <b>test</b> is also {{available}} for feline heartworm infection. [...] It will be positive {{in the event of}} exposure to D. immitis, so a cat that has successfully eliminated an infection may still be positive for up to three months. [...] The <b>antibody</b> <b>test</b> is more sensitive than the antigen test, but it does not provide direct evidence of adult infection. [...] It can, however, be considered specific for diagnosing previous larval infections, and therefore fairly specific for heartworm-associated respiratory disease.|$|E
2500|$|A {{variety of}} other tests for {{transfusion}} transmitted infections are often used based on local requirements. [...] Additional testing is expensive, {{and in some cases}} the tests are not implemented because of the cost. [...] These additional tests include other infectious diseases such as West Nile Virus. [...] Sometimes multiple tests are used for a single disease to cover the limitations of each test. [...] For example, the HIV <b>antibody</b> <b>test</b> will not detect a recently infected donor, so some blood banks use a p24 antigen or HIV nucleic acid test in addition to the basic <b>antibody</b> <b>test</b> to detect infected donors during that period. [...] Cytomegalovirus is a special case in donor testing in that many donors will test positive for it. [...] The virus is not a hazard to a healthy recipient, but it can harm infants and other recipients with weak immune systems.|$|E

50|$|Diagnosis of {{infection}} using <b>antibody</b> <b>testing</b> is a well-established technique in medicine.

Many current HIV <b>antibody</b> <b>tests</b> have sensitivity and specificity in excess of 96% and are therefore extremely reliable. While most patients with HIV show an antibody response after six weeks, window periods vary and may occasionally be as long as three months.|$|R

2500|$|Diagnosis of late-stage Lyme {{disease is}} often {{complicated}} by a multifaceted appearance and nonspecific symptoms, prompting one reviewer to call Lyme the new [...] "great imitator". Lyme disease may be misdiagnosed as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, lupus, Crohn's disease, HIV, or other autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases. As all people with later-stage infection {{will have a}} positive <b>antibody</b> <b>test,</b> simple blood tests can exclude Lyme disease as a possible cause of a person's symptoms.|$|E
2500|$|A CAP-RAST {{has greater}} {{specificity}} than RAST; it {{can show the}} amount of IgE present to each allergen. Researchers {{have been able to}} determine [...] "predictive values" [...] for certain foods, which can be compared to the RAST results. If a person's RAST score is higher than the predictive value for that food, over a 95% chance exists that patients will have an allergic reaction (limited to rash and anaphylaxis reactions) if they ingest that food. [...] Currently, predictive values are available for milk, egg, peanut, fish, soy, and wheat. Blood tests allow for hundreds of allergens to be screened from a single sample, and cover food allergies as well as inhalants. However, non-IgE-mediated allergies cannot be detected by this method. Other widely promoted tests such as the antigen leukocyte cellular <b>antibody</b> <b>test</b> and the food allergy profile are considered unproven methods, the use of which is not advised.|$|E

50|$|There {{are several}} methods to {{diagnose}} meningeal syphilis. One {{of the most}} common ways include visualizing the organisms by immunofluorescence and dark field microscopy. Dark field microscopy initially had the finding that the spirochete has a corkscrew appearance and that it is spirillar and gram (-) bacteria. Another method would also be through the screening test and serology. Serology includes two types of antibody test: Nontreponemal <b>antibody</b> <b>test</b> and Treponemal <b>antibody</b> <b>test</b> (specific test). The Nontreponemal <b>antibody</b> <b>test</b> screens with VDRL (Venereal Disease Research Lab) and RPR (Rapid Plasma Reagin). The Treponemal <b>antibody</b> <b>test</b> (specific test) confirms with FTA-ABS (Fluorescent treponemal antibody-absorption). Brain imaging and MRI scans may be used when diagnosing patients; however, they do not prove to be as effective as specific tests. Specific tests for treponemal antibody are typically more expensive because the earliest anitbodies bind to spirochetes. These tests are usually more specific and remain positive in patients with other treponemal diseases.|$|E
