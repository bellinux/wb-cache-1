2500|$|George Lucas was set {{to provide}} Abrams with advice as a {{creative}} consultant; however, Lucas had no involvement with the film, with his representative stating Lucas [...] "ideally would love not to see any footage until he walks into the theater next December. He has {{never been able to}} be surprised by a Star Wars film before <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> looking forward to it." [...] The film began pre-production on October 30, 2012. Production began in April 2014; it was released on December 18, 2015. In the US, the film is rated PG-13 [...] "for sci-fi action violence", the second Star Wars film to receive that rating after [...] (the five other films received a PG rating).|$|E
2500|$|Heineken {{is seen in}} {{the show}} as a client seeking to bring its beer to the {{attention}} of American consumers. Heineken was also the sole advertiser for the U.S. premiere of the last episode of Season 2, which featured only one commercial. Weiner stated that he is not opposed to product placement, if it can increase a show's budget or eliminate advertising breaks. However, he found the product placement for Mad Men to be a frustrating experience: he called the Heineken deal [...] "a disaster" [...] because Heineken's legal department objected to depictions of irresponsible drinking in the show, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> [...] "disgusted" [...] by the Unilever commercials, which were filmed on the Mad Men set against his will. Because of these frustrations, Weiner stated in 2012 that he would [...] "never again" [...] agree to product placement for Mad Men.|$|E
2500|$|Cissie was the Sultan's {{favourite}} {{until she}} died, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> heartbroken. Then, {{six days later}} he met a Romanian girl Marcella Mendl aged 25 who was selling Red Cross flags in London, and it was [...] "love at first sight". He courted her for twelve days and during {{this time he was}} visiting Cissie's parents to give his condolences - and perhaps to retrieve some jewellery that he had given to Cissie. On 6 November 1940, {{less than a month after}} Cissie's death, the Sultan married Miss Mendl at Caxton Hall register office in London; the bride was wearing [...] "a diamond brooch in which the Crown of Johore was flanked by the Sultan's crest, two tiger claws". Cissie's parents said that it had come as a great shock to them. By 10 November 1940, the Sultan was telling the Sunday Pictorial: [...] "I prefer to forget the past. [...] It is for the future I want to live." ...|$|E

60|$|MY DEAR MOTHER AND SISTER,--I Saw Gov.

6000|$|... 'You {{belonged to}} Coppy. Coppy told me so!' wailed Wee Willie Winkie disconsolately.

60|$|One {{of the men}} who {{had helped}} Billy Dill was Dunston Porter and the other was Samuel Lemington. They were both Americans and fairly well-to-do.

Oh, Dave, what shall we do?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The boys up {{home were}} telling me Mr. Wade had saved some of our cattle. Dad was delighted. You know he's lost a good many head of stock from this poison-weed. I saw so many dead steers on my last ride up the mountain. It's too bad our new man didn't get here sooner to save them. I {{asked him how he}} did it, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a doctor." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To Chicago, I think. He {{talked to}} himself a good deal. Said {{something}} about Chicago and St. Paul and Seattle.

6000|$|... "I'd {{a notion}} I could agree with him--I {{liked the way}} he talked--and I told him Helen could go, but {{the next time he}} called he was to walk right into the office instead of hanging round the counter. I asked him what he'd done with all the canned truck he'd bought, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{inclined}} to think his partner had eaten most of it.

6000|$|... "When {{we reached}} the Academy there were scores of {{students}} there {{from all over the}} Island. The first person we saw was Moody Spurgeon sitting on the steps and muttering away to himself. Jane asked him what on earth he was doing <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> repeating the multiplication table over and over to steady his nerves and for pity's sake not to interrupt him, because if he stopped for a moment he got frightened and forgot everything he ever knew, but the multiplication table kept all his facts firmly in their proper place! ...|$|E
60|$|There grew in Brangwen's heart now {{a secret}} {{desire to make}} her a lady.

60|$|It {{would seem}} to be the easiest thing in the world, when looking on the map, to go across the country from Loch Rannoch over to Katrine and all those celebrated parts, but we found we could not go that way, and so we went back to Edinburgh and made a fresh start.
