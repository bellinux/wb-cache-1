Latvia-A Linguistic Background The language situation in Latvia is characterised by great diversity. Among Russians, the largest minority by far, some 29 - 30 % of the population and other groups such as Belorussians, the usage of the Russian language is obvious as both citizens and non-citizens in the group alike tend to use it. There are Russian papers (printed both in Latvia and the Russian Federation) and Russian Federation TV (through cable and satellite). There are also minority programmes on the radio, through stately Doma Laukums or SWH+, a commercial station. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{determine}} and assess the rationale, objectives, and nature behind Canada’s bilateral electoral observation missions (EOM) to the country of Ukraine. Using international EOM standards and norms {{to act as a}} baseline, the thesis identifies differences that exist between the Canadian bilateral electoral missions to Ukraine and multilateral electoral missions operating in the country, specifically, those of the Organization for Security <b>and</b> <b>Cooperation</b> <b>in</b> <b>Europe’s</b> Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (OSCE-ODIHR). Furthermore, this thesis explores criticisms and concerns surrounding the missions and determines if such concerns apply to the missions’ rationale, objectives(s), and/or nature. Final mission reports, government documents, academic journals, news articles, as well as expert interviews with short-term observers, mission management, and mission directors will offer a comprehensive overview of Canada’s bilateral EOMs. This thesis advances the study of EOMs, specifically those between Canada and Ukraine. The subject of Canadian EOMs to Ukraine is of importance because there is very little academic study that pertains to their rationale, objectives, and nature. The amount of resources and human capital dedicated to these missions makes them an integral aspect of Canada’s development assistance to Ukraine, and situates them within Canada’s engagement with democratization efforts abroad. Furthermore, Canada is the only country to operate bilateral missions in Ukraine. This level of commitment brings attention to Canada’s unique relationship with Ukraine, sometimes dubbed a “special relationship,” and points to Canada’s stated commitment to democratization in areas of the world that are in transition. In exploring the implementation of the missions from 2004 - 2014, we are able to gain a greater understanding of the Canada-Ukraine relationship as well as insight into this important democratization effort...|$|R
