5|$|Third Lanark A.C. {{took over}} the second Hampden Park in 1903 and renamed it Cathkin Park. The club rebuilt the ground from scratch due to <b>a</b> <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> agree a fee for the whole stadium. Third Lanark went out of {{business}} in 1967 and Cathkin Park is now a public park with much of the original terracing still evident.|$|E
5|$|Abercrombie {{made two}} notable errors of {{judgment}} during the battle. One was <b>a</b> <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> recognize {{after the first}} wave of attacks that his chosen method of attack was unlikely to work. Instead of ordering additional waves of troops to the slaughter, he should have retreated to a safe distance and considered alternative actions. The second failure was that he apparently never considered ordering a flanking maneuver against the French right. At a minimum this would have stretched the French defenses, allowing his attackers elsewhere to find weak points. In fact, the French twice in the battle sent companies of militia out of their works on the right to enfilade the British attackers.|$|E

Included among them was a school established by John West, an Anglican missionary, at the Red River Colony in what is today Manitoba. Protestant missionaries also opened residential schools in the current Ontario region, spreading Christianity and working to encourage Indigenous peoples to adopt subsistence agriculture as a way to ensure they would not return to their original, nomadic ways of life upon graduation.|$|E
5|$|All of the aircrew {{involved}} in the crash had only limited flying time {{in the months before}} the crash. The B-52's aircrew were apparently unaware that the aircraft had stalled until shortly before impact, indicated by <b>a</b> <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> apply standard recovery techniques to the aircraft once it entered the stall. The investigation reported that, even if the proper stall recovery techniques had been applied, the aircraft was likely too low to recover before hitting the ground.|$|E
5|$|American goldfinches are {{occasionally}} {{victims of}} brood parasites, particularly brown-headed cowbirds. One {{study found that}} 9% of nests had brown-headed cowbird eggs in them. American goldfinches make very poor hosts for brood parasites, with studies showing low hatching rates of brown-headed cowbird eggs and no fledging success. This is {{despite the fact that}} the American goldfinch has no known behavioral adaptations against brood parasites. It is thought that the inability of brown-headed cowbird chicks to survive is due to <b>a</b> <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> get enough nutrition; the seed-rich diet of American goldfinch chicks varies from the usual insect-rich diet of other hosts.|$|E

5|$|As the Director-General was {{a public}} officer {{appointed}} by statute to discharge public duties, he was subject to an order of prohibition in an appropriate case. The Court found that on the affidavit evidence produced by the applicants, the Director-General could not reasonably {{have come to the}} conclusion he came to without hearing the applicants' witnesses. He had thus misdirected himself on the law as to the nature of the evidence that was required to be produced to prove the export of the goods. Finally, there had been an insufficient inquiry which had resulted in <b>a</b> <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> take into account relevant considerations, and an investigation that was unfair to the applicant. The Court therefore made an order of prohibition against the Director-General to prevent him from deducting money from the bankers' guarantees.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the project's conception, {{newspapers}} were reporting a rumor that the Soviet Union was planning to detonate a hydrogen bomb on the Moon. According to press reports in late 1957, an anonymous source had divulged to a United States Secret Service agent that the Soviets planned to commemorate the anniversary of the October Revolution by causing a nuclear explosion on the Moon to coincide with a lunar eclipse on 7 November. News reports of the rumored launch included mention of targeting {{the dark side of the}} terminator—Project A119 would also consider this boundary as the target for an explosion. It was also reported that <b>a</b> <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> hit the Moon would likely result in the missile returning to Earth.|$|E
5|$|Attachment {{disorder}} {{is a broad}} term intended to describe disorders of mood, behavior, and social relationships arising from <b>a</b> <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> form normal attachments to primary care giving figures in early childhood. Such a failure would result from unusual early experiences of neglect, abuse, abrupt separation from caregivers between 6 months and three years of age, frequent change or excessive numbers of caregivers, or lack of caregiver responsiveness to child communicative efforts resulting in a lack of basic trust. A problematic history of social relationships occurring after about age three may be distressing to a child, but does not result in attachment disorder.|$|E

5000|$|Norton v. Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance 542 U.S. 55 (2004) was a Supreme Court {{case that}} held that {{although}} the Administrative Procedure Act says that a person may challenge <b>an</b> agencys <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> act, this provision essentially just carries forward the writ of mandamus. Thus an agency cannot be compelled to act unless there is some non-discretionary, discrete act. Therefore, in this case, an interest group could not challenge <b>an</b> agencys <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> [...] "act so as to preserve the wilderness" [...] {{in accordance with the}} statute.|$|R

5|$|Following Oppenheimer's {{reorganization}} of the Los Alamos Laboratory in July 1944, {{the work on the}} uranium gun-type weapon was concentrated in Francis Birch's O-1 (Gun) Group. The concept was pursued so that in case of <b>a</b> <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> develop an implosion bomb, at least the enriched uranium could be used. Henceforth the gun-type had to work with enriched uranium only, and this allowed the Thin Man design to be greatly simplified. A high-velocity gun was no longer required, and a simpler weapon could be substituted, one short enough to fit into a B-29 bomb bay. The new design was called Little Boy.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{collision}} at least 31 lawsuits seeking damages were brought against United Airlines, the U.S. Government, or both. On September 24, 1958, United Airlines filed for damagesbased on the Federal Tort Claims Actagainst the United States in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. The airline {{alleged that the}} United States through its agents in the United States Air Force negligently operated the F-100F, and sought damages of US$3,576,698. The court found neither crew was negligent for <b>a</b> <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> see and avoid each other, but held the United States was liable because of other negligence. The case was settled on December17, 1962, with the United States agreeing to pay the airline $1.45million.|$|E
5|$|Ground for Three Rivers Stadium {{was broken}} on April 25, 1968. Due to the Steelers' suggestions, the stadium's design {{was changed to}} enclose centerfield. Construction continued, though it became plagued with {{problems}} such as thieves stealing materials from the building site. In November 1969, Arthur Gratz asked the city for an additional $3million ($ million today), which was granted. In January 1970, the opening target date of the stadium was set for May 29; however, because of <b>a</b> <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> install the lights on schedule, opening day was pushed back to July 16. The stadium was named in February 1969 for to its location at {{the confluence of the}} Allegheny River and Monongahela River, which forms the Ohio River. It would sometimes be called The House That Clemente Built after Pirates' right-fielder Roberto Clemente.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{after the}} fire, NASA convened the Apollo 204 Accident Review Board to {{determine}} the cause of the fire, and both houses of the United States Congress conducted their own committee inquiries to oversee NASA's investigation. The ignition source of the fire was determined to be electrical, and the fire spread rapidly due to combustible nylon material, and the high pressure, pure oxygen cabin atmosphere. The astronauts' rescue was prevented by the plug door hatch, which could not be opened against the higher internal pressure of the cabin. <b>A</b> <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> identify the test as hazardous (because the rocket was unfueled) led to the rescue being hampered by poor emergency preparedness.|$|E
5|$|In Thio Li-ann's view, {{it appears}} that the High Court allowed the matter to be decided {{according}} to the subjective discretion of the Minister. The only explanation given for deregistration was that the Jehovah's Witnesses' refusal to perform national service was contrary to the public interest. The Court did not require the executive to elaborate on exactly how <b>a</b> <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> perform national service would be contrary to public interest. It accepted the executive's discretion to derogate a fundamental right without a close scrutiny of the executive's rationale and explanations.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the plutonium implosion-type nuclear weapon and the plutonium gun-type fission weapon, the uranium gun-type weapon was straightforward if not trivial to design. The concept was pursued so that in case of <b>a</b> <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> develop a plutonium bomb, {{it would still be}} possible to use the gun principle. The gun-type design henceforth had to work with enriched uranium only, and this allowed the Thin Man design to be greatly simplified. A high-velocity gun was no longer required, and a simpler weapon could be substituted. The simplified weapon was short enough to fit into a B-29 bomb bay.|$|E
