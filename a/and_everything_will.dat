25|$|All that is {{required}} is to find an officer, even a captain would do, to win his heart or buy him with money {{to get him to}} agree to declare himself the savior of the Maronite population. Then the Israeli army will enter Lebanon, occupy the necessary territory, and create a Christian regime that will ally itself with Israel. The territory from the Litani southward will be totally annexed to Israel, <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> <b>will</b> fall into place.|$|E
2500|$|While absurdists {{believed}} {{that life is}} absurd, they also {{believed that}} death and the [...] "after life" [...] were equally absurd if not more, and that whether people live or not all of their actions are pointless <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> <b>will</b> lead to the same end (hence the repetitiveness {{in many of these}} absurdist plays).|$|E

2500|$|Most {{individual}} psalms {{involve the}} praise of God—for {{his power and}} beneficence, for his creation of the world, and for his past acts of deliverance for Israel. The psalms envision {{a world in which}} everyone <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> <b>will</b> praise God, and God in turn will hear their prayers and respond. Worst of all is when God [...] "hides his face" [...] and refuses to respond, because this puts in question the efficacy of prayer which is the underlying assumption of the Book of Psalms.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2008 {{television}} interview, Cornell {{said about}} religion, [...] "I don't follow any particular one. … Ultimately I think I'm {{sort of a}} freethinker and kind of open. … So many bad things–as well as good things–have happened based on people just sort of blindly following religion that I kind of feel like I want {{to stay away from}} any type of specific denomination or any religion period. If {{for no other reason than}} just that. I don't want to be involved with anything or condone any school of thought that at some point and in some way causes the death of innocent people, or tragedies where initial fantastic ideas [...] distorted. Like the life, for example, of Jesus is well-documented. It's corroborated by different people, who had different backgrounds, and different levels of education. And they wrote about it. We know that this guy existed, and we know pretty much what he said, and it's pretty simple. Everything from that point on in terms of wars and fighting over land and territories and religious things, none of that was even included in anything he said. His message was pretty simple, be really nice to each other <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> <b>will</b> be okay." ...|$|E
2500|$|On the {{philosophical}} side, Letters put forth {{the notion of}} der sinnliche Trieb / Sinnestrieb ("the sensuous drive") and Formtrieb ("the formal drive"). In a comment to Immanuel Kant's philosophy, Schiller transcends the dualism between Formtrieb and Sinnestrieb {{with the notion of}} Spieltrieb ("the play drive"), derived from, as {{are a number of other}} terms, Kant's Critique of the Faculty of Judgment. The conflict between man's material, sensuous nature and his capacity for reason (Formtrieb being the drive to impose conceptual and moral order on the world), Schiller resolves with the happy union of Formtrieb and Sinnestrieb, the [...] "play drive," [...] which for him is synonymous with artistic beauty, or [...] "living form." [...] On the basis of Spieltrieb, Schiller sketches in Letters a future ideal state (a eutopia), where everyone will be content, <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> <b>will</b> be beautiful, thanks to the free play of Spieltrieb. Schiller's focus on the dialectical interplay between Formtrieb and Sinnestrieb has inspired a wide range of succeeding aesthetic philosophical theory, including notably Jacques Rancière's conception of the [...] "aesthetic regime of art," [...] as well as social philosophy in Herbert Marcuse. In the second part of his important work Eros and Civilization, Marcuse finds Schiller's notion of Spieltrieb useful in thinking a social situation without the condition of modern social alienation. He writes, [...] "Schiller's Letters ... aim at remaking of civilization by virtue of the liberating force of the aesthetic function: it is envisaged as containing the possibility of a new reality principle." ...|$|E
