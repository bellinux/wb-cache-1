40|$|Ceramic {{materials}} are used extensively in non-nuclear {{components in the}} weapons stockpile including neutron tubes, firing sets, radar, strong link and weak link assemblies, batteries, and current/voltage stacks. Ceramics also perform critical functions in electronics, passively as insulators and actively as resistors and capacitors. Glass and ceramic seals also provide hermetic electrical feedthroughs in connectors for many weapons components. The primary goal of the ceramic material lifetime prediction program is to provide the enhanced surveillance program with the capability to specify the reliability and lifetimes of glass and ceramic-containing components under conditions typical of the stockpile environment. The authors have studied the reliability and subcritical crack growth (SCG) behavior of 94 % alumina (Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 }), which is likely the most common ceramic in the stockpile. Measurements have been made on aluminas manufactured by four war reserve qualified vendors (Coors, Wesgo, <b>AlSiMag,</b> and Diamonite). These {{materials are}} expected to be representative of typical product obtained from vendors who have supplied alumina for weapons components during the past several decades...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the results to}} date of a program that was initiated to predict and measure residual stresses in Mo-Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } cermet-containing components and to develop new materials and processes {{that would lead to}} the reduction or elimination of the thermal mismatch stresses. The period of performance includes work performed CY 95 - 97. Excessive thermal mismatch stresses had produced cracking in some cermet-containing neutron tube components. This cracking could lead to a loss of hermeticity or decreased tube reliability. Stress predictions were conducted using finite element models of the various components, along with the thermal coefficient of expansion (CTE), Young`s modulus, and strength properties. A significant portion of the program focused on the property measurements for the existing cermet materials, processing conditions, and the measurement technique. The effects of differences in the properties on the predicted residual stresses were calculated for existing designs. Several potential approaches were evaluated for reducing the residual stresses and cracking in cermet-containing parts including reducing the Mo content of the cermet, substituting a ternary alloy with a better CTE match with alumina, and substituting Nb for Mo. Processing modifications were also investigated for minimizing warpage that occurs during sintering due to differential sintering. These modifications include changing the pressing of the 94 ND 2 alumina and changing to a 96 % alumina powder from <b>AlSiMag...</b>|$|E
40|$|The work {{reported}} here {{has focused on}} the influence of substrate dissolution during the high temperature firing on the electrical properties of ruthenium dioxide-lead borosilicate thick film resistors. A resistor 25 (mu) m thick that is fired for 10 minutes at 840 (DEGREES) C will dissolve 4 (mu) m of the substrate surface. The presence of the alumina in the glass phase retards the growth of the resistor microstructure or chains of conducting particles by increasing the glass viscosity and slightly decreasing the solubility of RuO(, 2). These physical changes brought about measurable changes in the electrical properties. ^ Four glasses were made: a standard glass with 63 w/o PbO: 25 w/o B(, 2) O(, 3) : 12 w/o SiO(, 2); 4 w/o 614 <b>AlSiMag</b> substrate and 96 w/o standard glass; 6 w/o substrate and 94 w/o standard glass; 10 w/o substrate and 90 w/o standard glass. These glasses were powdered and mixed with 5 w/o RuO(, 2) powder then blended with screening agents. Four terminal resistors were fired onto 614 <b>AlSiMag</b> substrates under various conditions of time and temperature. The sheet resistance, hot (+ 125 (DEGREES) C) and cold (- 55 (DEGREES) C) temperature coefficients of resistance, normalized resistance versus temperature (- 55 to + 125 (DEGREES) C), and noise index were measured. As predicted, resistors with increasing amounts of substrate in the glass phase demonstrated slower development of electrical properties. It took about 14 minutes at 800 (DEGREES) C for a 10 w/o substrate resistor to reach its minimum sheet resistance compared to only 8 minutes for the standard glass resistor. ^ The hot and cold TCR 2 ̆ 7 s increased from large negative values (3 ̆c - 400 ppm/(DEGREES) C) for short firing times or low firing temperatures to near-zero values at longer firing times or higher firing temperatures. The noise index, in general, decreased with increasing firing time or temperature from about 40 dB down to 5 dB. With increasing weight percent substrate, the noise index increased. ^ A second group of experiments was performed to determine conduction mechanisms in thin films of the standard and 10 w/o substrate glasses. The glass was rf sputtered onto gold-coated, oxidized silicon wafers, then counter-electrodes of gold were evaporated on these films. Both ac and dc measurements were made. The parallel capacitance was a slowly decreasing function of frequency from 10 (2 ̆ 72) to 10 (2 ̆ 75) Hz. The conductivity increased linearly with frequency while the dissipation factor often showed a broad maximum implying the presence of an ionic impurity relaxation. The dielectric constants were found to be 11. 5 and 11. 2 for the standard and 10 w/o substrate glasses, respectively. The dielectric breakdown voltages were 2. 6 x 10 (2 ̆ 76) V/cm for the standard glass and 5. 5 x 10 (2 ̆ 76) V/cm for the 10 w/o substrate glass. The dc measurements indicate the conduction mechanism in the glass films is Schottky emission with an activation energy of approximately 0. 38 eV. ^ Using the normalized resistance versus temperature data for the thick film resistors, a unit model consisting of sintered particles of RuO(, 2) and non-sintered contacts with RuO(, 2) particles separated by a thin layer of the glass phase has been proposed. The temperature dependence of the theoretical unit has been derived and related to the experimental data by a curve-fitting process. ...|$|E
