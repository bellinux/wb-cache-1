5|$|Béart {{is given}} an {{ethereal}} quality by Lubtchansky's cinematography and lighting, and she subtly portrays Marie's detachment and vulnerability. In {{the latter part}} of the film Béart is dressed in grey and looks tired and wan, showing Marie's ageing and angst. Béart says she made deliberate use of silence in playing the part. Radziwiłowicz's performance allows the viewer to sympathise with Julien despite the character's initial dislikeable nature. Brochet as Madame X has <b>a</b> <b>cool</b> ease and grace.|$|E
5|$|Choctaw dyers use maple (Acer sp.) for a grey dye. Navajo weavers create black from mineral {{yellow ochre}} mixed with pitch from the piñon tree(Pinus edulis) and the three-leaved sumac (Rhus trilobata).

40|$|Graduation date: 1934 The {{object of}} this study was to compare the {{efficiency}} of <b>a</b> Hydro-Vac <b>cooler</b> with that of a 29 x 16 - 1 / 2 inch tubular surface cooler, as well as with that of two other coolers (tub cooler and sprinkler cooler). The <b>cooling</b> efficiency of <b>a</b> Hydro-Vac <b>cooler</b> was slightly lower than that of a 29 x 16 - 1 / 2 inch tubular surface cooler. The <b>cooling</b> efficiency of <b>a</b> sprinkler <b>cooler</b> was found to be higher than that of <b>a</b> tub <b>cooler,</b> but the cooling efficiency of either one of these two coolers was considerably lower than that of <b>a</b> Hydro-Vac <b>cooler.</b> When <b>a</b> Hydro-Vac <b>cooler</b> and <b>a</b> tubular surface <b>cooler</b> were thoroughly cleaned and sterilized there was no difference of' practical significance in the bacterial contamination of the milk by these two coolers. The flavor and odor of milk <b>cooled</b> with <b>a</b> tubular surface <b>cooler</b> or with <b>a</b> Hydro-Vac <b>cooler</b> was on <b>an</b> average slightly superior to the flavor and odor of milk from the same lot which was <b>cooled</b> with <b>a</b> tub <b>cooler</b> or with <b>a</b> sprinkler <b>cooler.</b> No difference was observed in the volume of cream forming on milk from the same lot when the milk was <b>cooled</b> with <b>a</b> tubular surface <b>cooler</b> or with <b>a</b> Hydro-Vac <b>cooler</b> or when it was not cooled. Cooling the same milk with <b>a</b> tub <b>cooler</b> produced <b>a</b> slightly greater cream volume than <b>cooling</b> with <b>a</b> tubular surface <b>cooler</b> or with <b>a</b> Hydro-Vac <b>cooler...</b>|$|R

5|$|Many {{species of}} sundews are self-fertile; their flowers will often self-pollinate upon closing. Often, {{numerous}} seeds are produced. The tiny black seeds germinate {{in response to}} moisture and light, while seeds of temperate species also require cold, damp, stratification to germinate. Seeds of the tuberous species require a hot, dry summer period followed by <b>a</b> <b>cool,</b> moist winter to germinate.|$|E
5|$|Salta, {{like the}} rest of the Solway plain, has an oceanic climate (Köppen climate {{classification}} Cfb), with warm summers and cool winters which generally avoid extremes of temperature. Salta has <b>a</b> <b>cool</b> climate, with average daytime highs of around 19°C during July and 7°C during December, although lows of −12°C have been recorded. It is wet all year round, with rain or drizzle expected on 16 to 19 days of most months. Snowfall is relatively uncommon.|$|E
5|$|The Catlins has <b>a</b> <b>cool</b> {{maritime}} temperate climate, somewhat {{cooler than}} {{other parts of}} the South Island, and strongly modified by the effect of the Pacific Ocean. Winds can reach considerable strength, especially on the exposed coast; most of the South Island's storms develop to the south or southwest of the island, and thus the Catlins catches the brunt of many of these weather patterns.|$|E

5|$|The bay has <b>a</b> <b>cool</b> wet, coastal {{temperate}} rainforest climate. Three climatic zones {{have been}} discerned in the Glacier Bay; the outer coast along the Gulf of Alaska, which records mild temperatures and higher precipitation. However, it experiences less snowfall, the upper Glacier Bay {{where it is}} much colder and heavy snowfall occurs, and the lower Glacier Bay, which experiences heavy rainfall throughout the year.|$|E
5|$|The north-south {{extent of}} the {{province}} (46°36'N to 60°22'N), prevalent westerly winds, cold ocean currents and local factors such as mountains and coastline combine to create the various climates of the province.

5|$|African-American {{writer and}} poet Maya Angelou (1928–2014) was honored by universities, {{literary}} organizations, government agencies, and special interest groups. Her honors include a Pulitzer Prize nomination for her book of poetry Just Give Me <b>a</b> <b>Cool</b> Drink of Water 'fore I Diiie, a Tony Award nomination {{for her role}} in the 1973 play Look Away, and five Grammys for her spoken albums. Beginning in 1982, Angelou held the first lifetime Reynolds Professorship of American Studies at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|Angelou {{followed}} her first two installations of her autobiography, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (1969) and Gather Together in My Name (1974), with Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas, published in 1976. It {{marked the first}} time a well-known African-American woman writer had expanded her life story into a third autobiography. She also published two volumes of poetry entitled Just Give Me <b>a</b> <b>Cool</b> Drink of Water 'fore I Diiie (1971), which was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize, and Oh Pray My Wings Are Gonna Fit Me Well (1975).|$|E

40|$|We {{review the}} general {{properties}} of the intracluster medium (ICM) in clusters that host <b>a</b> <b>cooling</b> flow, {{and in particular the}} effects on the ICM of the injection of hot plasma by a powerful active galactic nucleus (AGN). It is observed that, in some cases, the hot plasma produces cavities in the ICM that finally detach and rise, perhaps buoyantly. The gas dynamics induced by the rising bubbles can help explain the absence of <b>a</b> <b>cooled</b> gas component in clusters with <b>a</b> <b>cooling</b> flow. This scenario is explored using numerical simulations. Comment: 13 pages, no figures. Accepted for publication in Modern Physics Letters...|$|R
5|$|I'itoi {{onion is}} a {{prolific}} multiplier onion cultivated in the Baboquivari Peak Wilderness, Arizona area. This small-bulb type has a shallot-like flavour and {{is easy to}} grow and ideal for hot, dry climates. Bulbs are separated, and planted in the fall 1in below the surface and 12in apart. Bulbs will multiply into clumps and can be harvested throughout the cooler months. Tops die back {{in the heat of}} summer and may return with heavy rains; bulbs can remain in the ground or be harvested and stored in <b>a</b> <b>cool</b> dry place for planting in the fall. The plants rarely flower; propagation is by division.|$|E

For the first time, he enacted a character that lives in an urban area. He said that he accepted the film because he desperately wanted to play <b>a</b> <b>cool</b> dude on screen. Karthi's performances in Aayirathil Oruvan and Paiyaa earned him further nominations at the 58th Filmfare Awards South in the Best Actor category. Both films were dubbed into Telugu as Yuganiki Okkadu and Aawara, respectively, and were successful.|$|E
