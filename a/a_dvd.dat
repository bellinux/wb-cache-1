40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe goal of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the dose-dependency of morphometric changes in the coronary arterial wall after radioactive stenting. BackgroundRadioactive stents have been found to reduce intrastent intimal hyperplasia (IIH) but lead to a characteristic type of restenosis occurring predominantly at the stent edges. MethodsFifteen patients underwent intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) examination after implantation of a P- 32 radioactive stent and at the six-month follow-up. The post-stent IVUS measurements on seven predefined locations of each lesion were subjected to a computer algorithm for the development of dose-volume histograms (DVH). Thus, we derived the radiation doses delivered to at least 10 % and 90 % of the adventitia (DV 10, DV 90). The IIH and vascular remodeling at follow-up were correlated with the doses in each segment. ResultsThe IIH was most pronounced at the stent edges and lowest in the stent-body, whereas we detected a significant expansive remodeling within the stent body. The delivered doses correlated with a decreased IIH (r = 0. 52, p 90 Gy or <b>a</b> <b>DV</b> 90 > 15 Gy reduced IIH and induced expansive remodeling. Plaque growth was not reduced by radioactive stents. ConclusionsThe DVH analysis reveals a dose-dependent increase of external elastic lamina area behind radioactive stents, whereas plaque growth is not reduced but inverted into an outward direction from the stent. <b>A</b> <b>DV</b> 10 > 90 Gy or <b>a</b> <b>DV</b> 90 > 15 Gy results in a beneficial long-term outcome after radioactive stenting...|$|R
