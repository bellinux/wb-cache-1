5000|$|A tattoo {{machine is}} a {{hand-held}} device generally {{used to create}} a tattoo, a permanent marking of the skin with indelible ink. Modern tattoo machines use electromagnetic coils to move an <b>armature</b> <b>bar</b> up and down. Connected to the <b>armature</b> <b>bar</b> is a barred needle grouping that pushes ink into the skin. Tattoo artists generally use the term [...] "machine", or even [...] "iron", to refer to their equipment. The word [...] "gun" [...] is often used but many tattoo professionals dislike it. In addition to [...] "coiled" [...] tattoo machine there are also Rotary Tattoo Machines, which are powered by regulated motors rather than electromagnetic coils. [...] "The basic machine is pretty much unchanged today, in recent years variations of the theme have crept into the market, namely Manfred Kohr’s Rotary machine of 1976 or Carson Hill’s pneumatic machine that uses compressed air rather than electricity, but the principle is essentially the same." ...|$|E
50|$|A New York Times {{article from}} May 31, 1986 {{reported}} that inspection crews overseeing the restoration efforts had noticed several months earlier that a five foot long <b>armature</b> <b>bar</b> {{near one of}} the arms had been stamped with the forty names of the forty iron workers who had installed the armatures. The bar, which had to be replaced, was paid for by the contractors. Before being replaced, the bar was photographed; the image is in the June 1986 issue of Smithsonian magazine.|$|E
5000|$|Rotary tattoo machine: A exenter-rotary tattoo machine, {{invented in}} 1978 by Manfred Kohrs of Germany. [...] Rotary tattoo {{machines}} were the original machines, based on rotary technology, which {{was invented by}} Samuel O'Reilly and improved by the tattoo artists through the years. Rotary type machines use an electric motor to drive the needles. Some recent upgrades include using an <b>armature</b> <b>bar</b> to increase efficiency, a characteristic of coil machines. Recently, there have been improvements to make this type of machine pneumatic, {{in place of the}} electric motor used now.|$|E

5000|$|Copper was {{considered}} as a possible alternative metal for the replication of the [...] "puddled" [...] iron armatures, but was ruled out. The NPS performed tests to assess the suitability of a replacement for the iron bars. Ferralium, a steel-aluminum alloy, was decided on for the flat bars that connect the secondary framework to the armature. However, the approximately 1800 iron <b>armature</b> <b>bars</b> that were replaced were made from a 316L stainless steel. As the armatures provide the structural support for the copper skin, {{it was suggested that}} no more than four bars of one of four different sections of the statue be replaced (a total of sixteen bars could only be removed from the statue at any given time), and which were replicated (mostly by eye), had to be back in place of the corroded bars within 36 hours of their removal. An art restoration company working along with a steel contractor undertook the difficult task.|$|R

50|$|Although {{many of the}} {{armature}} bars were replaced in 1937-38, the restoration effort involved the successful attempt to replace nearly every 2 by 5/8 in ribbon like <b>armature</b> <b>bar</b> {{that made up the}} unique internal structure of the statue (as the bars are not connected to the copper skin, but are held in place by the copper saddles that are riveted into the copper skin). It was stated in a New York Times article from December 17, 1985, that the most serious internal problem with the statue, was the corrosion that had taken place in the iron armatures, which provide the support to the copper sheathing. The armature system had been provided with an ineffective solution to the galvanic corrosion problem. Eiffel knew that galvanic reaction would immediately pose a problem, owing to the dissimilarity of the metals used in the statue (copper and iron), which unless insulated would corrode rapidly.|$|E
40|$|Cooling in an end-winding {{region of}} a high-powered, large-sized {{generator}} still remains a challenge {{today because of}} a number of factors: a larger number of parts/components with irregular geometries, complexity in cooling flow paths, flow splitting and mixing, and interactions between rotor-induced rotating flows and nonrotating flows from stationary sections. One of the key challenges is to model cooling flows passing through armature bars, which are made up of bundles of strands of insulated copper wires and are bent oppositely to cross each other. This work succeeded in modeling a complex generator end-winding region with great efforts to simplify the model by treating the <b>armature</b> <b>bar</b> region as a porous medium. The flow and pressure fields at the end-winding region were investigated numerically using an axial symmetric computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. Based on the analysis, the cooling flow rate at each flow branch (rotor-stator gap, rotor subslot, outside space block, and small ventilation holes to the heat exchanger) was determined, and the high-pressure gradient zones were identified. The CFD results have been successfully used to optimize the flow path configuration for improving the generator operation performance, and the control of the cooling flow, as well as minimizing windage losses and flow-introduced noises...|$|E
5000|$|To {{obtain an}} {{approximate}} expression for the {{force on the}} railgun armature, we start by again assuming that the railgun rails can be modeled {{as a pair of}} semi-infinite conductors.
