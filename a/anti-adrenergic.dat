50|$|Pheochromocytoma is a {{neoplasm}} {{composed of}} cells {{similar to the}} chromaffin cells of the mature adrenal medulla. Pheochromocytomas occur in patients of all ages, and may be sporadic, or associated with a hereditary cancer syndrome, such as multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) types IIA and IIB, neurofibromatosis type I, or von Hippel-Lindau syndrome. Only 10% of adrenal pheochromocytomas are malignant, while the rest are benign tumors. The most clinically important feature of pheochromocytomas is their tendency to produce large amounts of the catecholamine hormones epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine. This may lead to potentially life-threatening high blood pressure, or cardiac arrythmias, and numerous symptoms such as headache, palpitations, anxiety attacks, sweating, weight loss, and tremor. Diagnosis is most easily confirmed through urinary measurement of catecholamine metabolites such as VMA and metanephrines. Most pheochromocytomas are initially treated with <b>anti-adrenergic</b> drugs to protect against catecholamine overload, with surgery employed to remove the tumor once the patient is medically stable.|$|E

These results were confirmed by RT-PCR analysis. In the unstimulated perfused heart, the left ventricular pressure (LVP) and maximal rate of left ventricular force development (dP/dtmax) of eNOS–/– hearts were not significantly different from those of WT hearts (LVP: 97 ± 11 mmHg WT vs. 111 ± 11 mmHg eNOS–/–; dP/dtmax: 3700 ± 712 mmHg s− 1 WT vs. 4493 ± 320 mmHg s− 1 eNOS–/–). The dobutamine (10 - 300 nm) -induced increase in LVP was enhanced in eNOS–/– hearts. In contrast, L-type Ca 2 + currents (ICa,L) in isolated cardiomyocytes of WT and eNOS–/– hearts showed no differences after β-adrenergic stimulation. Dibutyryl-cGMP (50 μm) reduced basal ICa,L in WT cells to 72 ± 12 % while eNOS–/–ICa,L was insensitive to the drug. The pre-stimulated ICa,L (30 nm isoproterenol) was attenuated by dibutyryl-cGMP in WT and eNOS–/– cells to the same extent. The Ca 2 + (1. 5 - 4. 5 mm) -induced increase in inotropy was not different between the two experimental groups and β-adrenergic receptor density was increased by 50 % in eNOS–/– hearts. The contractile effects of dobutamine could be inhibited almost completely by ACh or adenosine. The extent of the <b>anti-adrenergic</b> effect of both compounds was identical in WT and eNOS–/– hearts. Measurement of ICa,L in isolated cardiac myocytes yielded similar results. These data demonstrate that in the adult mouse (1) lack of eNOS is associated with increased cardiac contractile force in response to β-adrenergic stimulation and with elevated β-adrenergic receptor density, (2) the unaltered response of ICa,L in eNOS–/– cardiac myocytes to β-adrenergic stimulation suggests that endothelium-derived NO is important in mediating the whole-organ effects and (3) eNOS is unimportant for the <b>anti-adrenergic</b> effect of ACh and adenosine...|$|E

However, {{the effects of}} melatonin on cardiac muscle are still unknown. The first goal {{of the study was}} to investigate the role of melatonin on myocardial contractility in isolated rat papillary muscle using dose-response curves to melatonin, to isoproterenol and calcium either in the presence or in the absence of melatonin (0. 3 nM). Response curves to isoproterenol were additionally performed in the presence of melatonin plus the specific receptor antagonist N-acetyltryptamine (10 μM); the adenylate-cyclase stimulator forskolin (10 μM) was also used. Melatonin has no direct inotropic effect in isolated rat papillary muscle but counteracts isoproterenol but not [Ca 2 +] effects. In fact, the EC 50 for isoproterenol was significantly higher in the presence than in the absence of melatonin (p< 0. 001). This <b>anti-adrenergic</b> action occurs through an interaction to a specific cardiac receptor. Forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase induced an increase of contractile force (+ 118 ± 25 %) which was reduced in the presence of melatonin (+ 26 ± 10 %; p< 0. 01). In conclusion, we found that melatonin possess <b>anti-adrenergic</b> effect in isolated rat papillary muscle.

40|$|Myocardial aging {{leads to}} a {{reduction}} of beta-adrenergic receptor-induced metabolic and contractile responsiveness. We hypothesize that {{a change in the}} patterns of gene expression is important in these age-related events. To test this, hearts were harvested from young and aged male rats (3 - 4 and 20 - 22 mo, respectively). Total mRNA was extracted and prepared for hybridization to Affymetrix U 34 A GeneChips. Filtering criteria, involving fold change and a statistical significance cutoff were employed, yielding 263 probe pairs exhibiting differential signals. Of the 163 annotated genes, at least 56 (34 %) were classified as signaling/cell communication. Of these 56, approximately half were directly involved in G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathways. We next determined which of these changes might be involved in <b>anti-adrenergic</b> activity and identified 19 potentially important gene products. Importantly, we observed a decrease in beta 1 -adrenergic receptor and adenylyl cyclase mRNAs, whereas the mRNA encoding beta-arrestin increased. Furthermore, the results demonstrate an increase in mRNAs encoding the adenosine A 1 receptor and phospholipase D, which could increase <b>anti-adrenergic</b> effects. Moreover, the mRNAs encoding the muscarinic M 3 receptor, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor beta 3, and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor-related protein were increased as was the mRNA encoding guanylate kinase-associated protein. Interestingly, we also observed eight mRNAs whose abundance changed three- to sixfold with aging that could be considered as being compensatory. Although these results do not prove causality, they demonstrate that cardiac aging is associated with changes in the profiles of gene expression and that many of these changes may contribute to reduced adrenergic signaling...|$|E

The NO donors DEANO, SIN- 1, SNP, SNAP and GSNO had no significant effects on basal ICa,L. However, DEANO (100 μM) inhibited ICa,L after the current had been previously stimulated by either isoprenaline (Iso, 1 – 10 nM), a β-adrenergic agonist, or isobutylmethyl-xanthine (IBMX, 10 – 80 μM), a wide spectrum phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor. The <b>anti-adrenergic</b> effect of DEANO on ICa,L was not mimicked by other NO donors (SIN- 1, SNAP and SPNO). The NO-sensitive guanylyl cyclase inhibitor ODQ (10 μM), antagonized the inhibitory effect of DEANO on ICa,L. Likewise, inhibitors of the cGMP-dependent protein kinase (cG-PK), Rp- 8 -chloro-phenylthio-cGMP (10 μM) and KT 5823 (0. 1 and 0. 3 μM), also abolished the inhibitory effect of DEANO on Iso (1 –; 10 nM) -stimulated ICa,L. Intracellular dialysis with exogenous cAMP (10 – 100 μM) blunted the inhibitory effect of DEANO (10 and 100 μM) on ICa,L. SNAP and SNP also {{had no effect on}} the cAMP-stimulated ICa,L.

40|$|ABSTRACT In atrial muscle, {{acetylcholine}} (ACh) {{decreases the}} slow inward current (l~i) {{and increases the}} time-independent outward K § current. However, in ventricular muscle, ACh produces a marked negative inotropic effect only {{in the presence of}} positive inotropic agents that elevate cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP). A two-microelectrode voltage-clamp method was used on cultured reaggregates of cells from 16 - 20 -d-old embryonic chick ventricles {{to determine the effects of}} ACh on I~i and outward current during fl-adrenergic stimulation. Only double penetrations displaying low-resistance coupling were voltage-clamped. Cultured reaggregates are advantageous because their small size (50 - 250 /a-n) permits better control of membrane potential and adequate space clamp. Tetrodotoxin (10 - ~ M) and a holding potential of- 50 to- 40 mV were used to eliminate the fast Na + current. Depolarizing voltage steps above- 40 mV caused a slow inward current to flow that was sensitive to changes in [Ca]o and was depressed by verapamil (10 - 6 M). Maximal l~i was obtained at- 10 mV and the reversal potential was about + 25 inV. Isoproterenol (10 - 6 M) increased l~i at all clamp potentials. Subsequent addition of ACh (10 - 6 M) rapidly reduced Isi to control values (before isoproterenol) without a significant effect on the net outward current measured at 300 ms. The effects of ACh were reversed by muscarinic blockade with atropine (5 • 10 - 6 M). We conclude that the <b>anti-adrenergic</b> effects of ACh in ventricular muscle are mediated by a reduction in Ca 2 + influx during excitation...|$|E

40|$|Introduction Adenosine (ADO) is an {{endogenous}} purine derived in vivo from ATP, ADP, and AMP {{in response}} to adrenergic stimulation, hypoxia, ischemia, and other unfavorable oxygen supply-demand ratio situations. An elevated interstitial concentration of adenosine is known to attenuate the effects of ß-agonist stimulation of myocardium. ß-adrenergic receptor stimulation of the heart results in increases of contractility and metabolic state. Adenosine binds to the extracellular A 1 receptor subtype and activates an inhibitory G-protein that reduces the cyclic AMP excitatory cascade caused by ß-adrenergic stimulation. Therefore, one role of adenosine is {{to act as a}} negative feedback modulator of ß-adrenergic responses in the heart, essentially protecting the myocardium from the potentially deleterious effects of overstimulation. However, the cascade of events and mediators connecting adenosine to its effects is not completely understood. Nitric oxide (NO) has been shown to depress cardiomyocite response to ß-adrenergic stimulation in some studies. In addition, preliminary research data from this laboratory (J. M. Lee, et al. 2001) indicates that extracellular NO levels increase with stimulation by ADO (figure 1). Therefore, this investigation was designed to determine if NO is expressed as an <b>anti-adrenergic</b> mediator {{in response to}} ADO stimulation. This study used a NO-synthase inhibitor, N-nitro-L-arginine-methyl-ester (NMMA), to determine if blocking NO production affects the <b>anti-adrenergic</b> effect of ADO when hearts are stimulated by a ß-agonist, isoproterenol (ISO). Methods Hearts were obtained from 3 - 4 month old Sprague-Dawley rats. Immediately after isolation, hearts were retrograde constant flow perfused at 60 mmHg with physiological saline (PS; 37 ° C) containing (mM) : 118 NaCl, 4. 7 KCl, 2. 5 CaCl 2, 25 NaHCO 3, 1. 2 MgSO 4, 1. 2 KH 2 PO 4, and 10 glucose. The pH was maintained at 7. 4 by bubbling the PS with a 95 % O 2 – 5 % CO 2 mixture. Hearts were paced at 400 - 475 contractions/min via platinum were electrodes, depending on the need for overdrive pacing to suppress arrhythmia. The developed left ventricular pressure (DLVP) was determined by an intraventricular water-filled balloon-tipped cannula attached to a pressure transducer with the balloon inserted into the left ventricle via the atrium. The balloon pressure was set at 5 mmHg initially and kept between 5 - 10 mmHg throughout the experiment. Contractile function is reported as the maximum rate of development of left ventricular pressure (+dP/dtmax). DLVP, +dP/dt, and –dP/dt were continuously recording using a Gould 2600 recorder and abstracted into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. The data was then analyzed and graphed using GraphPad Prism 4. 0. Protocols Two different protocols were used during the experiment. First, using each heart as its own control, contractile response to ISO was compared with and without ADO perfusion, while using PS initially without NMMA and later with NMMA. After allowing the hearts to stabilize for 20 minutes, ISO was infused over 10 seconds into PS without NMMA through the tubing close to the heart at a rate, adjusted for PS flow, calculated to deliver a concentration of 2. 5 x 10 - 8 M. After allowing the contractility to return to baseline, approximately 10 minutes, ISO stimulation was repeated. Following 3 cycles of ISO infusion, ADO was infused at a constant rate calculated to deliver a concentration of 10 - 5 M, followed by 2 cycles of ISO infusion. Thereafter, ADO was withdrawn and the PS was quickly switched to PS with NMMA at 10 - 6 M. After approximately 10 minutes, 2 cycles of ISO stimulation were performed and the ADO was restarted. Following 2 cycles of ISO infusion with ADO and PS withNMMA, ADO was stopped, and 2 more ISO cycles were performed to gauge to post-test performance of the heart. (figure 2) Second, two series of hearts were studied using PS with or without NMMA throughout the experiments, but with increasing levels of ADO infusion, in order to establish a dose-response curves. After allowing the hearts to stabilize for 20 minutes, ISO was infused over 10 seconds into PS without NMMA through the tubing close to the heart at a rate, adjusted for PS flow, calculated to deliver a concentration of 2. 5 x 10 - 8 M. After allowing the contractility to return to baseline, approximately 10 minutes, ISO stimulation was repeated. Following 3 cycles of ISO infusion, ADO was infused at a constant rate calculated to deliver a concentration of 10 - 9 M, followed by 2 cycles of ISO infusion. Thereafter, ADO was increased one order of magnitude (10 - 8, 10 - 7, 10 - 6, 10 - 5) and after approximately 10 minutes, 2 cycles of ISO stimulation were performed. The entire cycle was repeated until the maximum study concentration of ADO was reached at 10 - 5 M. Following 2 cycles of ISO infusion at the maximal ADO concentration, ADO was stopped, and 2 more ISO cycles were performed to gauge to post-test performance of the heart. The same protocol was repeated on another series of hearts using PS with NMMA at 10 - 6 M. (figure 3) Summary 1. As assessed by the parameters of myocardial contractitily, the NO-synthase inhibitor NMMA prevented the antiadrenergic action of ADO. 2. There was an unexpected initial increase in contractility observed with NMMA infusion at lower concentrations of ADO. Conclusion: These results indicate that nitric oxide plays a role in the <b>anti-adrenergic</b> effects of adenosine in isolated, perfused rat hearts...|$|E
40|$|Increased {{mortality}} and reduced functional capacity {{are the two}} main characteristics of chronic heart failure. Activation of the renin-angiotensin and sympathetic systems has a primary role in the progressive worsening of heart failure and increased mortality of patients. In addition, both systems may be important in the pathogenesis of exercise intolerance, although {{there is only a}} weak relationship between neurohormonal activation and exercise capacity. While neurohormonal antagonists, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-blockers, consistently improve the prognosis of patients with heart failure, their effects on exercise tolerance have often been less significant. This problem has been emphasized by the introduction of beta-blockers for the therapy of heart failure. Beta blockade results in a significant improvement in left ventricular function during rest and exercise. However, the reduction in chronotropic response to exercise as well as the metabolic changes caused by these agents in skeletal muscle may result in an apparent lack of change in maximal functional capacity. This effect is particularly important with the new third generation non-selective beta-blockers. The pronounced <b>anti-adrenergic</b> activity of these compounds accounts for their greater negative chronotropic effect and relates to the lack of improvement in peak oxygen consumption (VO 2). Submaximal exercise testing can be used to assess changes induced by these agents. However, even the six-minute walk test may act as an almost maximal test in patients with advanced heart failure: moreover, the measurement of submaximal exercise duration may be sensitive enough to detect changes in single-centre trials, but not in multicentre trials. To date, direct assessment of symptoms by both patient and physician is still the most sensitive tool to monitor changes in functional status with non-selective beta-blockers. Thus, an accurate method of measuring patients' symptoms, in addition to the clinical examination, is still necessary when neurohormonal antagonists are used in patients with chronic heart failur...|$|E
40|$|Adenosine {{protects the}} heart from {{adrenergic}} overstimulation. This adenoprotection includes the direct <b>anti-adrenergic</b> action via adenosine A 1 receptors (A 1 R) on the adrenergic signaling pathway. An indirect A 1 R-induced attenuation of adrenergic responsiveness involves the translocation of PKC-ɛ to t-tubules and Z-line of cardiomyocytes. We investigated with sarcomere imaging, immunocytochemistry imaging, and coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) whether A 1 R activation of PKC-ɛ induces the kinase translocation to receptor for activated C kinase 2 (RACK 2) in isolated rat and mouse hearts and whether phospholipase C (PLC) is involved. Rat cardiomyocytes {{were treated with}} the A 1 R agonist chlorocyclopentyladenosine (CCPA) and exposed to primary PKC-ɛ and RACK 2 antibodies with secondaries conjugated to Cy 3 and Cy 5 (indodicarbocyanine), respectively. Scanning confocal microscopy showed that CCPA caused PKC-ɛ to reversibly colocalize with RACK 2 within 3 min. Additionally, rat and mouse hearts were perfused and stimulated with CCPA or phenylisopropyladenosine to activate A 1 R, or with phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate to activate PKC. RACK 2 was immunoprecipitated from heart extracts and resolved with SDS-PAGE. Western blotting showed that CCPA, phenylisopropyladenosine, and phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate in the rat heart increased the PKC-ɛ co-IP with RACK 2 by 186, 49, and > 1, 000 %, respectively. The A 1 R antagonist 8 -cyclopentyl- 1, 3 -dipropylxanthine prevented the CCPA-induced co-IP with RACK 2. In mouse hearts, CCPA increased the co-IP of PKC-ɛ with RACK 2 by 61 %. With rat cardiomyocytes, the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol increased sarcomere shortening by 177 %. CCPA reduced this response by 47 %, an action inhibited by the PLC inhibitor U- 73122 and 8 -cyclopentyl- 1, 3 -dipropylxanthine. In conclusion, A 1 R stimulation of the heart is associated with PLC-initiated PKC-ɛ translocation and association with RACK 2...|$|E
40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESThis study {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors attenuate beta-adrenergic contractility in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) through nitric oxide (NO) myocardial signaling. BACKGROUNDThe ACE inhibitors increase bradykinin, an agonist of NO synthase (NOS). Nitric oxide inhibits beta-adrenergic myocardial contractility in patients with heart failure. METHODSThe study patients were given the angiotensin- 1 (AT- 1) receptor antagonist losartan for one week. The hemodynamic responses to intravenous dobutamine were determined before and during intracoronary infusion of enalaprilat (0. 2 mg/min) with and without the NOS inhibitor NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA, 5 mg/min). RESULTSIn patients with DCM (n = 8), dobutamine increased the peak rate of rise of left ventricular pressure (+dP/dt) by 49 ± 8 % (p < 0. 001) and ventricular elastance (Ees) by 53 ± 16 % (p < 0. 03). Co-infusion with enalaprilat decreased +dP/dt to 26 ± 12 % and Eesto − 2 ± 17 % above baseline (p < 0. 05), and this <b>anti-adrenergic</b> effect was reversed by L-NMMA co-infusion (p < 0. 05 vs. enalaprilat). In addition, intracoronary enalaprilat reduced left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), but not left ventricular end-diastolic volume, consistent with increased left ventricular distensibility. Infusion with L-NMMA before enalaprilat in patients with DCM (n = 5) prevented the reduction in +dP/dt, Eesand LVEDP. In patients with normal left ventricular function (n = 5), enalaprilat did not inhibit contractility or reduce LVEDP during dobutamine infusion. CONCLUSIONSEnalaprilat attenuates beta-adrenergic contractility and enhances left ventricular distensibility in patients with DCM, but not in subjects with normal left ventricular function. This response is NO modulated and occurs {{in the presence of}} angiotensin receptor blockade. These findings may have important clinical and pharmacologic implications for the use of ACE inhibitors, AT- 1 receptor antagonists and their combination in the treatment of heart failure...|$|E
40|$|Dietary n- 3 {{polyunsaturated}} {{fatty acids}} (PUFAs) {{have been reported}} to exhibit antiarrhythmic properties, attributed to their capability to modulate ion channels. In the present review, we will focus on the effects of PUFAs on cardiac sodium channel (Nav 1. 5) and two potassium channels (Kv) (Kv 1. 5 and Kv 11. 1). n- 3 marine (docohexaenoic and eicohexapentaenoic acid) and plant origin (alpha-linolenic acid) PUFAs block Kv 1. 5 and Kv 11. 1 channels at physiological concentrations. Also, DHA and EPA decreased Nav 1. 5 and calcium channels. These effects on Na and Ca channels theoretically should shorten the cardiac APD, whereas the blocking actions of n- 3 PUFAs of Kv channels should lengthen the cardiac action potential. Experiments performed in female rabbits fed with a diet rich in n- 3 PUFAs show a longer cardiac action potential and effective refractory period. This study was performed to analyze if their antiarrhythmic effects are due to a reduction of triangulation, reverse use-dependence, instability and dispersion of the cardiac action potential (TRIaD as a measure of proarrhythmic effects). Dietary n- 3 PUFAs supplementation markedly reduced dofetilide-induced TRIaD and abolished dofetilide-induced torsades de pointes (TdP). Ultrafast sodium channel block by DHA may account for the antiarrhythmic protection of dietary supplements of n- 3 PUFAs against dofetilide induced proarrhythmia observed in this animal model. The cardiac effects of n- 3 PUFAs resemble those of amiodarone: both block sodium, calcium and potassium channels, have <b>anti-adrenergic</b> properties, can prolong the cardiac action potential, reverse TRIaD and suppress TdP. The main difference is that sodium channel block by n- 3 PUFAs has a much faster onset and offset kinetics. Therefore, the electrophysiological profile of n- 3 PUFAs appears more desirable: the duration of reduced sodium current (facilitates re-entry) is much shorter. The n- 3 PUFAs appear as a safer alternative to other antiarrhythmic agents...|$|E
40|$|The {{adrenergic}} blocking agents tolazoline, phentolamine, piperoxan, yohimbine, phenoxybenzamine, bretylium and guanethidine {{block the}} excitatory actions both of cholinergic nerves and of added acetylcholine {{on a variety}} of vertebrate smooth muscle preparations. These cholinergic blocking actions often occurred with concentrations lower than those required to block the response of the guinea-pig vas deferens to stimulation of the adrenergic hypogastric nerve. The anti-acetylcholine activities of these drugs have been studied in detail, using the guinea-pig rectum and the toad bladder as test organs. In preparations sensitive to eserine, the anticholinesterase actions of the drugs competed with their anti-acetylcholine actions, so that either potentiation or block of responses to acetylcholine and to cholinergic nerve stimulation occurred with different concentrations. The responses of the toad bladder to acetylcholine were not potentiated by eserine. This enabled the antagonism of acetylcholine by the <b>anti-adrenergic</b> drugs to be estimated without interference from their anticholinesterase activity. When blocking activity was assessed on guinea-pig rectum previously treated with dyflos, the results were qualitatively similar to those on the toad bladder. Phenoxybenzamine often completely blocks responses both to added acetylcholine and to cholinergic nerve stimulation in concentrations less than those required to block adrenergic nerves. Guanethidine and piperoxan also show strong cholinergic blocking activity. Bretylium, yohimbine, tolazoline and phentolamine were less potent. However, in concentrations required to block the effect on the vas deferens of hypogastric nerve stimulation, these drugs at least halved the effects of acetylcholine and often of cholinergic nerve stimulation. It is concluded that these adrenergic blocking agents cannot be used to distinguish conclusively between adrenergic and cholinergic nerves. For reliable analysis of autonomic innervation, the substances released upon nerve stimulation must be identified by specific biochemical techniques or bioassay...|$|E
40|$|Background: Polycystic ovary {{syndrome}} (PCOS) is {{a common}} complex condition. Evidences from studies on women with PCOS and rat PCO model suggest that the sympathetic regulatory drive to the ovary may be unbalanced (hyperactivity). Findings that support the involvement of sympathetic nervous system in the pathophysiology of PCOS are that the catecholaminergic nerve fibers in the polycystic ovaries of women with PCOS are denser than in normal ovaries. The {{purpose of this study}} was reduction of this hyperactivity. Methods: This study was clinical trial and was performed in Reproductive Health Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Iran, during January 2013 to 2015. A total of 61 women between aged 20 - 40 years and BMI under 28 kg/m 2, who were previously diagnosed with PCOS were assessed. The diagnosis of PCOS was made according to joint criteria of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology and the American Society of Reproductive Medicine (ESHRE/ASRM). The study objectives were explained to the patients before they entered the study, and an informed consent was obtained from all. They were divided into three groups as follows: (i) two study group (n= 39) and (ii) control group (n= 22). For evaluating effects of alpha- 2 inhibitors (Clonidine and Yohimbine) by Eliza, the following variables were evaluated before and after drug therapy: serum cortisol adrenaline (A) noradrenalin (NA) beta-endorphin (&beta-End) insulin as well as sex hormones including FSH, LH and Estradiol. Results: Our results showed that, Clonidine as central <b>anti-adrenergic</b> drug causes 61 % of all pregnancies in the study group. This is high percentage of the pregnancy rate compared with yohimbine (P< 0. 001). Yohimbine (Indol alkaloid) as alpha- 2 adenoceptor antagonist increases follicular development in this disease. This follicle growth is higher than clonidine (P< 0. 01). Conclusion: Our findings showed that increasing the pregnancy rate and follicular development represent the strategic role of sympathetic nervous system (SNS) in polycystic ovary syndrome and) SNS may thus offer a novel biological and pharmacological target in treatment of PCOS...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundIn {{the long}} QT {{syndrome}} (LQTS) the clinical efficacy of beta-blocker treatment differs {{according to the}} genotype. We aimed to asses the effect of beta-blocker treatment in LQT 1 and LQT 2 patients. Patients and methods 24 -hour Holter ECG were recorded before and after beta-blocking therapy initiation in genotyped LQT 1 (n= 30, 8 males, mean age 21 ± 17) and LQT 2 patients (n= 16, 8 males, mean age 19 ± 15). QT duration was measured on consecutive 1 -minute averaged QRS-T complexes leading to up to 1440 QT-RR pairs for each recording. Then, we computed subject- and condition-specific log/log QT/RR relationships which were used to calculate QT interval duration at RR= 1000 ms (QT 1000 = 1000 *). ResultsBefore treatment, coefficients were higher in LQT 2 than in LQT 1 patients (0. 53 ± 0. 10 vs. 0. 40 ± 0. 11, p< 0. 001) and QT 1000 was longer in LQT 2 than in LQT 1 patients (521 ± 38 vs. 481 ± 39 ms, p< 0. 01). Beta-blockers significantly prolonged the mean RR interval (RR = 827 ± 161 ms before treatment and 939 ± 197 ms on beta-blocker, p< 0. 0001). The coefficients were not significantly modified by beta-blockers (0. 41 ± 0. 9 in LQT 1 patients and 0. 52 ± 0. 12 LQT 2 patients). Beta-blocker treatment {{was associated with a}} prolongation of the QT 1000 interval (from 481 ± 39 to 498 ± 43 ms, p< 0. 01) in LQT 1 patients but with a shortening in LQT 2 patients (from 521 ± 38 to 503 ± 32 ms, p< 0. 01). ConclusionsOur results confirm the elevated coefficient of the QT/RR relationship in LQTS patients. LQT 2 patients showed higher coefficient and longer QT 1000 when compared to LQT 1 patients. The effect of beta-adrenergic blockade on QT 1000 duration was gene-specific. Given the demonstrated efficacy of beta-blockers in LQT 1 and 2 patients, our data suggest that QT 1000 might be a poor predictor of outcome under <b>anti-adrenergic</b> therapy...|$|E
