[...] In June 2006 the Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I was sold to Ronald Lauder for $135million, at the time a record price for a painting. Eileen Kinsella, the editor of ARTnews, considered the high price was due to several factors, particularly the painting's provenance, the increasing demand for Austrian Expressionism, rising prices in the art world and [...] "Lauder's passion for and pursuit of this particular work". Lauder placed the work in the Neue Galerie, the New York-based gallery he co-founded. The painting has been on display at the location since.|$|E

[...] He further stated that [...] "if anybody wants to tape my conversations, go right ahead, feel free to do it. I appreciate <b>anybody</b> <b>who</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> tape me openly and notoriously; and those who feel like they want to sneakily, and wear taping devices, I would remind them that it kind of smells like Nixon and Watergate."

Through this formal act they entered the Islamic community and showed their willingness to follow and obey Muhammad. The wordings of the oath differ in different traditions but it contains the shahada and prayers of repentance.|$|R
