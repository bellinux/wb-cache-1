Following his tour of the Archdiocese, O'Brien lamented the large presence of poverty and violence in Baltimore, saying, [...] "I think <b>anybody</b> <b>who</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> take a walk can find areas with very nice homes, well-kept lawns, good streets and sidewalks, and maybe 15 minutes later find themselves in a neighborhood that is just racked, torn apart, as if a war had just been fought." ...|$|E

[...] In June 2006 the Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I was sold to Ronald Lauder for $135million, at the time a record price for a painting. Eileen Kinsella, the editor of ARTnews, considered the high price was due to several factors, particularly the painting's provenance, the increasing demand for Austrian Expressionism, rising prices in the art world and [...] "Lauder's passion for and pursuit of this particular work". Lauder placed the work in the Neue Galerie, the New York-based gallery he co-founded. The painting has been on display at the location since.|$|E

[...] He further stated that [...] "if anybody wants to tape my conversations, go right ahead, feel free to do it. I appreciate <b>anybody</b> <b>who</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> tape me openly and notoriously; and those who feel like they want to sneakily, and wear taping devices, I would remind them that it kind of smells like Nixon and Watergate."

However, this differed from the proclamation of faith necessary to simply become a Muslim. In addition to this the prophet formally took bayʿah from the people and tribes. Through this formal act they entered the Islamic community and showed their willingness to follow and obey Muhammad. The wordings of the oath differ in different traditions but it contains the shahada and prayers of repentance.|$|R
