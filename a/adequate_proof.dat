A politically astute Octavian explains that their mission is only a gesture, since the theft of the eagle is actually a blessing in disguise to Caesar. Civil war between Caesar and Pompey is inevitable, but Caesar needs Pompey to make the first move so as not to appear the aggressor; Pompey is likely to do that if he believes Caesar's soldiers {{are on the verge of}} desertion.

The list of articles is provided in the last chapter of this paper. This paper is intended to be read by engineers and decision-makers, who may not be familiar with advanced terms in cryptography or in mathematics, thus all proofs and raw theorems have been omitted.

The second claim is that early member state participation reflected a concern to protect national laws, but that this pattern of member state participation is changing as member state evince more of a desire to influence the general trend of Commmunity law.

40|$|Croatian {{geological}} literature {{during the}} mid nineteen-eighties and nineties {{was marked by}} the appearance of a new geotectonic concept of the Dinarides proposing that the recent, very complex structural setting is a direct consequence of a specific palaeogeographic relationship during the Mesozoic, i. e. the proposed existence of two carbonate platforms separated by a long-lasting deep marine area (interplatform trough). Although the idea was very interesting and provoked discussion, resulting in the questioning of formerly established concepts, detailed analysis of available data indicate that the Karst Dinarides (External Dinarides) were formed by the destruction of a single, although morphologically considerably variable shallow water carbonate platform. This platform was in some periods very dynamic because of its palaeogeographic position during the Mesozoic, resulting in many periods of large-scale facies differentiation, especially during the Late Cretaceous. The final disintegration of the platform area culminated in the formation of flysch trough(s) in the latest Cretaceous and Palaeogene and the subsequent uplift of the Dinarides. Recently there have been some misunderstandings resulting from the imprecise use of newly established terms, which are, by circular logic, used to connect recent geotectonic relationships with Mesozoic palaeogeography without <b>adequate</b> material <b>proof.</b> Therefore, the terms Dinaricum and Adriaticum should be redefined and used only for description of the recent tectonic pattern, without implying a palaeogeographic component, since during the Mesozoic they represented a single entity.

And under the load, it is distinguished in 3 phases, i. e. contraction, contration followed relaxation and relaxation. 4) The influence of ATP concentration on the glycerinated muscle fiber was also studied. 5) The influence of Mg annexation on ATP effect was studied.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{laboratory}} tests {{have been conducted}} with Port Hills loess from the Ahuriri quarry. Tests have been conducted to obtain a theoretical basis for suggestions of good design practice for retaining wall filtration/drainage systems. The study has concentrated on investigation of geotextiles as filtration options, with granular filters being tested for comparison. Two of the tests (stage 1 test and gradient ratio test) are designed to provide comparative information on filter performance with specific soil types. The third test {{is a series of}} three laboratory scale retaining wall simulations. Information from these tests provides evidence of potential problems with commonly used retaining wall filtration/drainage systems. In conjunction with laboratory testing, field observations have been carried out to assess {{the current state of the}} practice, and identify additional areas of concern. Results from both the gradient ratio and stage 1 tests indicate good performance of a range of needle punched nonwoven geotextiles for filtering the specific soil tested (Ahuriri quarry loess). Scanning Electron Microscope investigation of the soil and geotextile filter structures formed during testing indicate bridging to be the dominant filter network, with one example of a vault network for the needle punched range. Small amounts of clogging observed within the geotextile structure have not resulted in significant reductions in permeability. Gradient ratio values for a selection of the needle punched range support evidence from the stage 1 test that satisfactory filter performance is provided. Gradient ratio values of greater than 3. 0 are recorded for two heat bonded nonwoven geotextiles, indicating a concerning level of clogging. Observations of tested heat bonded samples under the SEM show a degree of "blocking" (a specific form of clogging). These observations are supported by lower permeability values in both tests, comparative to the needle punched range, suggesting the needle punched range is better suited to filtering this specific soil type. Indications from the retaining wall simulations suggest a need for impermeable drain channels under drainage pipes to prevent erosion of loess resulting from water flow under the drain pipes. Also indicated by these tests is the presence of salts on the backfill material obtained from a local quarry. Although further investigation is recommended, the potential exists for corrosion of steel reinforcing where <b>adequate</b> water <b>proofing</b> is not placed. The need for adequate surface drainage (particularly during construction) in combination with good retaining wall design is emphasised. As a culmination of the testing and field work, a number of suggestions are put forward as aspects of good design practice for filtration/drainage systems for use in retaining walls on the Port Hills. Selection of an appropriate geotextile for a specific filtration project should ideally follow an in-depth design process, and should not be controlled by budget constraints, as is sometimes the case. Numerical design criteria, based on site specific soil properties and geotextile properties, as well as compatibility tests (such as the gradient ratio test, or the stage 1 test) are available to aid in the design process...|$|R
40|$|The paper summarises the {{fundamental}} {{aspects of the}} design of structure and structural parts in aluminium light alloys in cases when energy absorption performances are required. Particularly, the design of crashworthy helicopter structures {{and the development of}} leading edges, for wings or tail empennages, in bird impact conditions are considered. In both cases the structural performance turns out to be strongly influenced by the material properties beyond the elastic range, such as the ultimate strength, the overall toughness, the elongation at failure and file strain rate sensitivity of the plastic response. The design conditions of crashworthy helicopter structures are referred to potentially survivable crash scenarios where file absorption of the impact energy by means of absorbers located in the landing gears, in the subfloor and in the seats call significantly reduce the occupant injuries (Figure 1). The deceleration experienced by the occupants is actually influenced by file response of the whole structure of the helicopter, as it call be outlined by the experimental evidence in all helicopter crash test (Figure 2). As far as the subfloor and the landing gears are concerned, some design solutions developed to integrate energy absorbing elements in their structural lay-outs are presented (Figures 3, 4). The Working mechanism of light alloy absorbers is exemplified considering a light alloy crushing tube (Figure 5) and the role that call be played by numerical analyses in the design and verification of the absorbers integrated in the helicopter structure is outlined (Figure 6). Indeed, many helicopter structural parts contribute to transmit the loads thus allowing file absorbers to properly work and for thus parts, strength requirements have to be considered far more important than energy absorbing issues. To identify the A role played by the different parts and the consequent requirements, all hybrid multi-body/finite elements modelling technique is presented With all application to an helicopter subfloor (Figure 7). A general evaluation of the roles played by the strength level, the elongation at failure and the strain rate sensitivity in the design of light alloy absorbers is then carried out, basing oil analytical formulations for the prediction of the absorber performances that are correlated with a data base of experimental results (Figures 8, 9). Experiments performed with absorbers made of different light alloy are also discussed (Figures 10, 11). Attention is then focused oil the issues relevant to the bird impacts oil aircraft structures, after having pointing out that this occurrence turns out to be, basing oil the current civil aviation regulation, the dimensioning condition for many parts of fixed and rotary Wing aircraft structures. The force levels that call be exerted by a bird strike are evaluated (Figure 12) and file main design philosophies developed to design bird proof leading edges are presented (Figure 13). It is evidenced that, also in this case, the problem call not be reduced to design a structure and select a material for maximum energy absorbing capabilities. In fact, the risk of bird pocketing due to all excessive structural deformation suggests to take into considerations design solutions where the bird material is actually deflected. In such cases, the strength levels of the chosen light alloy may determine the development Of all <b>adequate</b> bird <b>proof</b> structure, These concepts are illustrated considering the bird impact oil a hybrid light alloy/carbon composite vertical stabilizer (Figure 14). A numercal model of the impact test is also presented discussing the key role performed, in the performed numerical analysis, by a damage law introduced to approximately model the tearing of the structural barrier (Figure 15). The completely different experimental outcomes obtained in two impact conditions are presented, indicating that the adopted simplified material characterisation call indeed evaluate the adequacy of the structural impact strength levels (Figures 76, 17). Globally, all the presented numerical cases highlight the potential role that can be played, in exploiting the full range of properties offered by aluminium alloys, by the execution of numerical analyses, when reliable and complete descriptions of file material behaviour beyond the elastic range are introduced in the models...|$|R
