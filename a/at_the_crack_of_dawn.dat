25|$|Diwali {{is celebrated}} in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana {{on the same}} day as central, east, west and north India, and the festivities center over two days {{observed}} as state holidays – Naraka Chaturthasi and Deepavali Amaavasya (Diwali). The festivities start out <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> <b>of</b> <b>dawn</b> and carry on well into the night. Most people make a trip to the local temple along with their families to seek the blessings of their respective gods. The night sky is lit up with a scintillating array of noisy fireworks.|$|E

2500|$|The advance {{commenced}} at 04:00 {{when one}} battalion and three companies of Indian soldiers progressed through the central {{area of the}} northern territory, aiming to seize the airfield. However, the surprise was lost when the Indian A Company tried to capture the Air Control Tower and the Indian battalion suffered three casualties. The Portuguese lost one soldier dead and six taken captive. The Indian D Company captured a position named [...] "Point 365" [...] just before the next morning. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> <b>of</b> <b>dawn,</b> two sorties by Indian Air Force Mystere fighters struck Portuguese mortar positions and guns inside Moti Daman Fort.|$|E

2500|$|Workers, {{including}} the new Polish arrivals, {{were introduced to the}} industry usually <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> <b>of</b> <b>dawn</b> outside one of the packing plants. Crowds of hundreds and sometimes thousands of laborers, mostly unskilled, gathered near the various employment offices. They appeared every morning at around six o'clock and waited for about an hour. The employment agent walked among the crowd and picked those who seemed the strongest and best able to do unskilled work at the plant. The agent did not allow any bargaining over wages or hours; he simply tapped the men he had chosen on the back and said: [...] "Come along!" [...] Generally, the agent only picked a few. The rest of the group would be back the next day.|$|E
2500|$|Knatchbull appealed unsuccessfully on {{the grounds}} that the judge had not {{directed}} that his body be dissected and anatomized, as required by law. [...] His hanging on 13 February 1844 occurred in Taylor Square and was witnessed by 10,000. John Knatchbull sentenced to hang for the murder of Ellen Jamieson: The execution to be held outside the gates of the three-year-old [...] gaol, was scheduled for 9a.m. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> <b>of</b> <b>dawn</b> scores of people, children included, were swarming across the racecourse (Hyde Park) towards Darlinghurst Hill. The Australian newspaper judged the throng to be 10,000 strong. The paper was disdainful of the ghoulish mob yet, at the same time, congratulated them on their good behavior. Captain John Knatchbull aged 56 years, was led out into Forbes Street, at the gaol gates on the Darlinghurst Ridge. [...] Wearing genteel black broadcloth, Captain Knatchbull then [...] "ascended the fatal scaffold without trepidation or fear, and was launched into another world with a noble and fervent prayer trembling on his lips". The bell of St Phillip's tolled thrice and John Knatchbull was dead.|$|E

The Mercury News wrote [...] "In a town very familiar with the words [...] "The Catch", Blanco made one for the ages: he took off on a dead sprint <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bat and made a diving catch on the warning track in center field, 400 feet from home plate." ...|$|R
60|$|Searing crept on, taking {{advantage}} of every accident of ground and growth to give himself better cover. His eyes penetrated everywhere, his ears took note of every sound. He stilled his breathing, and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>cracking</b> <b>of</b> a twig beneath his knee stopped his progress and hugged the earth. It was slow work, but not tedious; the danger made it exciting, but by no physical signs was the excitement manifest. His pulse was as regular, his nerves were as steady {{as if he were}} trying to trap a sparrow.|$|R

60|$|He kicked, as he spoke, at a {{shivering}} cur {{which was}} looking in <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bar-door, with a hazy view of calling {{its attention to}} the matter, and then, pulling up {{the collar of his}} rough pea-jacket, stepped boldly out into the rain. Three or four minutes’ walk, or rather roll, brought him to a dark narrow passage, which ran between two houses to the water-side. By a slight tack to starboard at a critical moment he struck the channel safely, and followed it until it ended in a flight of old stone steps, half of which were under water.|$|R
2500|$|The opening {{ceremony}} {{began with a}} tribute to the Australian pastoral heritage of the Australian stockmen and the importance of the stock horse in Australia's heritage. It was produced and filmed by Sydney Olympic Broadcasting Organisation and the home nation broadcaster, Channel 7. [...] This was introduced by a lone rider, Steve Jefferys, and his rearing Australian Stock Horse Ammo. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>cracking</b> <b>of</b> Jefferys' stockwhip, a further 120 riders entered the Stadium, their stock horses performing intricate steps, including forming the five Olympic Rings, to a special Olympics version of the theme which Bruce Rowland had previously composed for the 1982 film The Man from Snowy River.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we give {{in two and}} three {{dimensions}} a reconstruction formula for determining cracks buried in an inhomogeneous anisotropic elastic body by making elastic displacement and traction measurements <b>at</b> <b>the</b> boundary. The information is encoded in the local Neumann-to-Dirichlet map. With {{the help of the}} Runge property, the local Neumann-to-Dirichlet map is connected to the so-called indicator function. This function can be expressed as an energy integral involving some special solutions, called reflected solutions. The heart of our method lies in analyzing <b>the</b> blow-up behavior <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> indicator function, which is by no means an easy task for the inhomogeneous anisotropic elasticity system. To overcome the difficulties, we construct suitable approximations of the reflected solutions that capture their singularities. The indicator function is then analyzed by the Plancherel formula...|$|R

The conclusion about the undesirability of the aromatic compounds, exceeding 50 %-content in the raw material, has been made.

2500|$|The Ring, which Gollum {{referred}} to as [...] "my precious" [...] or [...] "precious", extended his life far beyond natural limits. Centuries of the Ring's influence twisted Gollum's body and mind, and, {{by the time of}} the novels, he had [...] "come to love and hate the Ring, just as he loved and hated himself." [...] Throughout the story, Gollum was torn between his lust for the Ring and his desire to be free of it. Bilbo Baggins found the Ring and took it for his own, and Gollum afterwards pursued it for the rest of his life. Gollum finally seized the Ring from Frodo Baggins <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cracks</b> <b>of</b> Doom in Orodruin in Mordor; but he fell into the fires of the volcano, where both he and the Ring were destroyed.|$|R
5000|$|Kumbh Mela, a mass-gathering of sadhus {{from all}} parts of India, takes place every three years at one of four points along sacred rivers in India, {{including}} the holy River Ganges. In 2007 it was held in Nasik, Maharashtra. Peter Owen-Jones filmed one episode of [...] "Extreme Pilgrim" [...] there during this event. It took place again in Haridwar in 2010. Sadhus of all sects join in this reunion. Millions of non-sadhu pilgrims also attend the festivals, and the Kumbh Mela is the largest gathering of human beings for a single religious purpose on the planet; the most recent Kumbh Mela started on 14 January 2013, <b>at</b> Allahabad. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> festival, sadhus appear in large numbers, including those [...] "completely naked with ash-smeared bodies, who sprint into the chilly waters for a dip <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> <b>of</b> dawn".|$|R
