5|$|Arable farming {{grew in the}} High Middle <b>Ages</b> <b>and</b> {{agriculture}} {{entered a}} period of relative boom between the thirteenth century and late fifteenth century.

There are also Scottish coins, although English coinage probably remained more significant in trade, and {{until the end of}} the period barter was probably the most common form of exchange. Craft and industry remained relatively undeveloped before the end of the Middle <b>Ages</b> <b>and,</b> although there were extensive trading networks based in Scotland, while the Scots exported largely raw materials, they imported increasing quantities of luxury goods, resulting in a bullion shortage and perhaps helping to create a financial crisis in the fifteenth century.|$|E

The main aim of {{the first part of the}} work was to map the views and approaches to senior <b>age</b> <b>and</b> <b>aging</b> occurring in the society. The second part is a research one and includes data analysis, and quantitative research among respondents in the issues of the approach to senior <b>age</b> <b>and</b> <b>aging.</b> The main aim of the second part of the work was to find the current view of the present middle-age generation to senior <b>age</b> <b>and</b> <b>aging.</b> The quantitative research was performed by the method of questioning by means of the standardized questionnaire technique examining the view of senior <b>age</b> <b>and</b> <b>aging.</b> The research shows that the middle-age generation views the senior <b>age</b> <b>and</b> <b>aging</b> positively.
