60|$|The {{confusion}} {{between the}} standards of a short story and {{the standards of}} the novel which leads at last to these--what shall I call them?--Westminster Gazettisms?--about the correct length to which the novelist should aspire, leads also to all kinds of absurd condemnations and exactions upon matters of method and style. The underlying fallacy is always this: the <b>assumption</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel,</b> like the story, aims at a single, concentrated impression. From that comes a fertile growth of error. Constantly one finds in the reviews of works of fiction the complaint that this, that or the other thing in a novel is irrelevant. Now it is the easiest thing, and most fatal thing, to become irrelevant in a short story. A short story should go to its point as a man flies from a pursuing tiger: he pauses not for the daisies in his path, or to note the pretty moss on the tree he climbs for safety. But the novel by comparison is like breakfasting in the open air on a summer morning; nothing is irrelevant if the waiter's mood is happy, and the tapping of the thrush upon the garden path, or the petal of apple-blossom that floats down into my coffee, is as relevant as the egg I open or the bread and butter I bite. And all sorts of things that inevitably mar the tense illusion which is the aim of the short story--the introduction, for example, of the author's personality--any comment that seems to admit that, after all, fiction is fiction, a change in manner between part and part, burlesque, parody, invective, all such thing's are not necessarily wrong in the novel. Of course, all these things may fail in their effect; they may jar, hinder, irritate, and all are difficult to do well; but it is no artistic merit to evade a difficulty any more than it is a merit in a hunter to refuse even the highest of fences. Nearly all the novels that have, by the lapse of time, reached an assured position of recognised greatness, are not only saturated in the personality of the author, but have in addition quite unaffected personal outbreaks. The least successful instance the one that is made the text against all such first-personal interventions, is, of course, Thackeray. But I think the trouble with Thackeray is not that he makes first-personal interventions, but that he does so with a curious touch of dishonesty. I agree with the late Mrs. Craigie that there was something profoundly vulgar about Thackeray. It was a sham thoughtful, sham man-of-the-world pose he assumed; it is an aggressive, conscious, challenging person astride before a fire, and a little distended by dinner and a sense of social and literary precedences, who uses the first person in Thackeray's novels. It isn't the real Thackeray; it isn't a frank man who looks you in the eyes and bares his soul and demands your sympathy. That is a criticism of Thackeray, but it isn't a condemnation of intervention.|$|E

The real story is undoubtedly more complex and more interesting. The novel does dominate modern literature but the particular form that it has assumed resulted from diverse and contingent factors. This suggests that there is nothing inevitable about the rise of the realist novel; other counterfactual literary histories could have happened and we should be wary of assuming that modern literature resulted from an inexorable process...|$|E

The first 'Australian novel' was published anonymously in 1831, when the transported forger Henry Savery wrote Quintus Servinton: A Tale Founded upon Incidents of Real Occurrence.

40|$|Refuting <b>the</b> <b>assumption</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> first <b>novels</b> after 1830 {{constitute}} {{the advent of}} Greek realism, this paper intends to corroborate Tziovas’s argument that these texts, drawing on the world construction of the Hellenistic and Byzantine adventure novel, constitute an idiosyncratic branch of European Romanticism. This will be evidenced through an analysis of A. Soutsos’s The Exile of 1831, theoretically underpinned by Bakhtin’s theory of the literary chronotope. A two-fold argument will be developed: ex negativo by opposing Bakhtin’s view on literary realism to the traditional {{manner in which the}} diegetic world of The Exile is constructed, and ex positivo by arguing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> narrative structure of <b>the</b> adventure <b>novel</b> can be regarded as a logical choice in view of <b>the</b> hypothesis <b>that</b> tension between <b>the</b> diegetic world and contemporary reality is characteristic of Romanticism.

40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between feminist criticism and Georges Bataille’s Story of the Eye. Much of the critical work on Bataille assimilates his psychosocial theories in Erotism with the manifestation of those theories in his fiction without acknowledging potential contradictions between the two bodies of work. The conflation of important distinctions between representations of sex and death in Story of the Eye and the writings of Erotism forecloses the possibility of reading Bataille’s novel as a critique of gender relations. This article unravels some of the distinctions between Erotism and Story of the Eye in order to complicate the <b>assumption</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> simply reproduces phallogocentric sexual fantasies of transgression.

Its primary purpose was to provide further insight into the influence of a microgravity environment on various aspects of mammalian physiology and well-being as part of an ongoing program of research aimed ultimately at understanding and ameliorating the deleterious influences of space on the human body. The present study took advantage of video collected from fixed, in-flight cameras within the habitat itself, to assess behavioral adaptations observed among in-flight mice aboard the ISS and differences in behavior with respect to a control group on the ground. Data collection consisted of several behavioral measures recorded by a trained observer with the assistance of interactive behavior analysis software. Specific behavioral measures included frequencies of conspecific interactionsociability, time spent feeding and conducting hygienic behavior, and relative durations of thigmotactic behavior, which is commonly used as an index of anxiety. Data were used to test tentative hypotheses that such behaviors differ significantly across mice under microgravity versus 1 g conditions, and the <b>assumption</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> experience of microgravity itself may represent an initially anxiogenic stimulus which an animal will eventually acclimate to, perhaps through habituation...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} problem of {{answering}} questions about images in the harder setting, where the test questions and corresponding images contain novel objects, which were not queried about in the training data. Such setting is inevitable in real world-owing to the heavy tailed distribution of the visual categories, {{there would be some}} objects which would not be annotated in the train set. We show that the performance of two popular existing methods drop significantly (up to 28 %) when evaluated on novel objects cf. known objects. We propose methods which use large existing external corpora of (i) unlabeled text, i. e. books, and (ii) images tagged with classes, to achieve novel object based visual question answering. We do systematic empirical studies, for both an oracle case where the novel objects are known textually, as well as a fully automatic case without any explicit knowledge of the novel objects, but with the minimal <b>assumption</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> objects are semantically related to the existing objects in training. The proposed methods for novel object based visual question answering are modular and can potentially be used with many visual question answering architectures. We show consistent improvements with the two popular architectures and give qualitative analysis of the cases where the model does well and of those where it fails to bring improvements.

Na ’n kort opsomming van navorsingsperspektiewe wat op die omgang van die leser met die teks fokus, word die opset en bevindinge van ’n leserstudie onder Afrikaanse lesers van romanses beskryf. ’n Vergelyking met ander studies oor dieselfde genre dui op ooreenkomste, soos dat die genre lesers help om aan die werklikheid te ontsnap en ontvlug, maar ook op verrassende verskille. Ten spyte van die patriargale omgewing waarin die Afrikaanse romanseleser lewe, word dit – anders as in ander studies – verswyg as rede vir ontvlugting. Die studie wys op die noue verbintenis tussen teks, leser en konteks wanneer die Afrikaanse romanselesers ontvlugting van misdaad as die werklikheid waarvan hulle wil ontvlug, aandui. This article {{highlights}} the gains of approaches {{other than that}} of text analysis {{to the study of}} literature. The romance is a literary genre that developed in Western culture mainly in English speaking countries. Romantic love is the essence of romantic fi ction and romances focus primarily on the love and romantic relationship {{between a man and a}} woman and have optimistic and emotionally satisfying endings. Until quite recently the idea of reading a romance often evoked derision, and there was a general <b>assumption</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>novels</b> were read by less educated and less sophisticated women. However, romance publishing is big business in the West and also in South Africa and the question thus arises as to why this genre is singled out for ridicule. This article, which is based on a readership study of Afrikaans readers of romance novels, seeks to understand this phenomenon. After a short overview of research perspectives <b>that</b> focus on <b>the</b> association of the reader with the text, the context and results of the readership study are discussed. The study was undertaken on behalf of a South African publishing house and focuses on the demography of Afrikaansspeaking romance readers, their overall reading practices and the reasons for reading romances. The investigation was loosely based on Radway’s seminal study on readers of romances as discussed in her book Reading the Romance (1983). Questionnaires were included in a consignment of romances sent to members of romance book clubs. The questionnaires included, inter alia, the questions of why the respondents read romances and why these novels are preferred, or are felt to be “better” to read, than other books. One of <b>the</b> main themes <b>that</b> emerged from <b>the</b> responses was the women’s need to escape from the unsatisfactory realities of everyday life. This corresponds directly with results obtained from other studies of the genre. However, a surprising difference with existing studies also emerged when the responses regarding what respondents were escaping from were analysed. In spite of the patriarchal environment in which Afrikaans speaking women in South Africa fi nd themselves, this was not, as was predominant in other studies, mentioned as a reason/factor from which to escape. Instead, the South African women overwhelmingly indicated that they read romance novels to escape from the realities of rampant crime and violence touching upon their everyday lives. The main contribution of this readership study therefore, in which Afrikaans romance readers indicate that through their reading of romance novels they manage to escape from an unsatisfactory, crime-ridden reality, is that it clearly shows the close relationship between reader, text and sociohistorical realities. It furthermore demonstrates that literature can also be studied for the role it plays in the life of the reader and how the reader, by means of romance texts, may cope with such contexts and/or realities.

40|$|This PhD {{describes}} a novel working principle for small electromechanical machines. The goal of <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> working principle {{is to increase}} the efficiency of these small electromechanical machines. In traditional electromechanical machines, a rotating magnetic field is used which is generated by time-varying currents in a set of stator coils. The stator Joule losses are responsible for 50 % of all losses when the power output is smaller than 1 kW. Using a configuration combining permanent magnets and a composite of piezoelectric and magnetostrictive materials, the stator Joule losses are annihilated. The stator Joule losses are replaced with dielectric losses, but they take only 20 % of the input power. The composite of piezoelectric and magnetostrictive materials, forming the anisotropic controllable ferromagnetic composite, converts electrostatic energy into magnetic energy. The internal stress, obtained by the piezoelectric material, changes the magnetic behaviour of the anisotropic controllable ferromagnetic composite, giving it the function of a variable reluctance. Such variable reluctances combined with permanent magnets are implemented in a permanent magnet switched reluctance machine design, preferably an axial-flux machine. <b>The</b> <b>novel</b> working principle is demonstrated using a magneto-mechanical finite element solver. This magneto-mechanical finite element solver is built around the improved energy based material model. The magneto-mechanical finite element solver consists of two solvers: (i) the radially symmetric magnetic solver and (ii) the Cartesian structural mechanical solver. The exploitation of radial symmetry in a dedicated 2 D FE solver is new. The extension to the radially symmetric magnetic solver and the energy based material model were crucial to simulate and study <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> working principle. Because <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> working principle is preferably implemented in an axial-flux machine, a radially symmetric 2 D finite element solver is set up. The radial symmetry is non-standard, which requires the development of a set of dedicated shape functions. The requires shape function has a particular dependency on the radial coordinate in order to guarantee the partion-of-unity property, the consistency property and the convergence of the scheme. Such a dependency does not occur in the standard 2 D Cartesian and the 2 D axi-symmetric finite element solver. <b>The</b> <b>novel</b> working principle uses the magnetostrictive material properties to convert magnetic energy into mechanical energy. This requires a proper understanding and simulation of the magneto-elastic material behaviour, which requires a physical material model instead of a phenological material model. The multi-scale approach suggested by L. Daniel et. al., is followed, because it still relies on microscopic approaches, but with a lower computational cost. This material model uses the micromagnetic theory based on a statistical distribution, which results in the anhysteretic behaviour. During a three month research visit to the RWTH Aachen, the hysteresis effect influenced by the stress has been implemented in this material model by introducing a new energy function, which models the hysteretic effect. These achievements allowed the finite element simulation of <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> motor. <b>The</b> simulation confirms the initial <b>assumptions</b> and shows <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> motor concept is a reliable alternative for small, traditional electric machines with stator coils. Moreover, <b>the</b> simulation shows <b>that</b> <b>the</b> performance of such a motor is comparable with a commercially available motor. This shows <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> motor principle has a great potential. status: publishe...|$|R

This essay argues that the history of novel-reading is more complicated and more varied than has been assumed; it goes on to explore, through the story of a single lesson, the possibilities for meaning-making that are the product of particular pedagogic practices {{as well as of the}} irreducibly social process of reading the class novel Key words: class novel, reading, roleplay, collabora-tive learning, pedagogy In what follows, I want to consider one kind of nar-Q 1 rative, the class novel, partly by providing another kind of narrative, an account of a single English les-son. The place of the class novel within the secondary English curriculum has been threatened within the last decade or so by the increased emphasis on objective-led teaching and the attendant attitude to texts as lit-tle more than vehicles for the transmission of isolable skills. Even before the advent of the National Liter-acy Strategy (DfEE, 2001), however, the class novel’s position in accounts of reading and reading develop-ment was an uncertain one. If the shared reading of a book-length text has always posed practical difficulties – questions of how to organise the reading and how to get through it all in the time available – these were (and are) compounded by underlying theoretical uncertain-ties, stemming from the <b>assumption</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> is a literary form to be consumed by silent, solitary read-ers.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the main male character's male {{dominance}} and the main female character's self-ownership as seen in Samuel Richardson's Pamela since I have the <b>assumption</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> mainly talks about those concepts. In this case, according to Brissenden, demonstrating moral and social predicaments of individual's rights, essentially the women's rights, is Richardson's obsession in Pamela. Two sets of feelings of the main female character, Pamela, and the main male character, Mr. B., which are inextricably involved, trigger the sexual conflicts concerning Pamela and Mr. B. with their concepts. In {{the course of their}} argumentations, I want to reveal how Mr. B. expresses his notion of male dominance toward Pamela, how Pamela also performs her notion of self-ownership toward Mr. B., and what the resolutions of their confrontations are. In this study, I apply a feminist approach since the theories of male dominance and the theories of self-ownership are in line with the world of feminist theories. In order to support the theories of self-ownership, I apply the extropian theories of self-ownership as they represent the idea of the individual's rights obviously. In this case, I view the extropian theories of self-ownership still from the feminist point of view. Furthermore, I apply literary theories, namely characterization and conflict in order to help me show Pamela's self-ownership and Mr. B. 's male dominance more clearly. In relation with the theory of characterization, I want to prove that Pamela and Mr. B. really have the concept of self-ownership and the concept of male dominance. In this case, their concepts of male dominance and self-ownership are reflected through their character traits. Next, I apply theories of conflict in order to evaluate the conflicts between Pamela and Mr. B [...] As of my analysis, I construe that Mr. B. is a man with dominance while Pamela is a woman with self-ownership since their speeches and actions prove that. Conclusively, I find out that despite the fact that Mr. B. has a strong notion of male dominance, fundamentally his domination fails since Pamela is able to overcome all his efforts to own her without marriage. Mr. B. also changes his manners toward Pamela. The fact that Mr. B. even requests her to marry him becomes the final resolution of their great conflicts...|$|E
