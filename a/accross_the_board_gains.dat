40|$|The {{diffusion}} of two general purpose technologies, electricity and ICT, in the Finnish manufacturing industry is observed.

In fact, LP slowed down in many industries, the notable exception of which is the electric and electronic appliance industry that experienced a mushroom-like boost in its LP growth. When the labour productivity growth was decomposed into the contributions of internal productivity growth, the employment share effect and the cross term, we found that labour shifting to industries with differing levels or growth rates of LP explains less of aggregate LP change in 19201938 (and even less in 19742000) than it did in 19011920. ...|$|R

40|$|Has {{the revival}} of the ASEAN Group in the early 1990 s {{affected}} the industrial growth of Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia? Two mechanisms are used to capture this potential impact: scale effects and intermediate imports variety. The analysis is performed on 22 three-digit ISIC industries over the 1971 - 1995 period. There is significant heterogeneity in industry level returns to scale. Furthermore, the three ASEAN members in our study have very small, mostly negative cross-industry scale effects. Therefore, the ASEAN members may not achieve large or across <b>the</b> <b>board</b> <b>gains</b> from their regional arrangement through scale effects. We find unexpected results with respect to the role of intermediate imports variety in industrial growth. We find no support for the hypothesis that non-regional (ROW) suppliers and goods variety {{have a positive effect on}} ASEAN industries via the channel of imported intermediate inputs. The regional variety measure, on the other hand, seems to impact the output growth of a handful of industries positively. This result seems due to the fact that these countries have had a long term and a strong, intra-regional and intra-industry trade whose history outdates and outweighs the ASEAN revival up to 1995...|$|R

5000|$|In planing {{conditions}} {{a harness}} is typically worn to more efficiently use the rider's weight {{to counter the}} force in the sail. As the wind increases, the rider continues to sheet the sail, the fin generates more lift, and <b>the</b> <b>board</b> <b>gains</b> speed, transitioning onto a plane. <b>The</b> volume of <b>board</b> in <b>the</b> water (displacement) decreases, and the rider moves rearward, stepping into the footstraps for improved control. When planing, <b>the</b> <b>board</b> skims on <b>the</b> surface rather than displacing water as it moves. Planing can be achieved at different wind speeds depending on the rider's weight, sail and fin size, wave conditions, and rider ability. With modern equipment planing can normally be achieved at a wind speed of around 12 knots. The transition from displacement motion to planing requires a jump in energy, but once planing, water resistance decreases dramatically. This means {{that it is possible}} to continue to plane, although the wind has dropped below a level that would be required to transition to plane. A board in plane can be much smaller than a board moving by displacement (thereby gaining an advantage in gear weight and board control). Lateral resistance to the wind is provided by the fin alone (generating more lift at higher speeds) and a centreboard is no longer used (smaller boards do not have one). A fin generates lift, transferring a strong load to <b>the</b> <b>board,</b> and so is usually constructed of carbon fiber for accurate shape and strength. A low-pressure area develops on the windward side of the fin, which can lead to cavitation, leading to a sudden loss of lift, called [...] "spin-out" [...] (equivalent to [...] "stalling" [...] in flight terminology). Ideal planing conditions for most recreational riders is 15-25 knots of wind, but experts can windsurf in much windier conditions. Planing is considered one of the most exhilarating aspects of the sport.|$|R

40|$|Vehicle drivetrains {{are complex}} {{integrated}} systems, which {{need to be}} designed for numerous thermodynamic, economic and environmental factors. As part of a project of the Alliance for Global Sustainability between the MIT, the SFITs and the University of Tokyo, a new evolutionary multi-objective optimisation algorithm has been developed and applied to various problems including vehicle drivetrain configurations. The simulation of a potential vehicle is complex and calculation intensive. The new algorithm, the Clustering Pareto Evolustionary Algorithm (CPEA) is attractive {{in this kind of}} problems because it allows an efficient use of each vehicle simulation - gathering more information about the solution domain for the same effort as a single point optimisation. In addition it allows optimisation of disparate objectives, for example, costs and emissions to be considered separately. Conventional, series electric hybrid and parallel electric hybrid have been evaluated over the ECE-EUDC and US 06 HWY drive cycles considering performance in terms of CO 2, NOx, fuel economy, estimated investment, operating and pollution costs. Although some own technology models have been developed and used, the major part of the optimisation results are based on models from Advisor which are available on the web. The parallel hybrids were shown to be preferable to series hybrids in all cases studied, but were frequently beaten by conventional vehicles. In this first study, pollution costs considerations were limited to NOx (13. 8 Frs/kg) and CO 2, (0. 03 Frs/kg) and diesel engine vehicles proved difficult to beat in terms of operating costs, and even overall investment and operating cost. Indeed it was found that a five fold increase in pollution costs traditionaly considered in the literature, would be needed before any difference would be observed. Of course the situation looks different if investment and operating cost, without any pollution costs, are evaluated only in comparison with the NOx emission levels or if a pollution cost of particulates is added. Among marketed hybrids the “Insight” was found to be highly attractive (keeping however in mind its limited seating capacity), although its exceptional performance is undoubtedly linked to the ultra light weight structure, which, in spite of the braking energy recovery of hybrids, is still shown to have a major effect. It {{is interesting to note that}} the pollution costs were found to be of low significance compared to the operating and investment costs and an average vehicle, mainly due to the significant level of tax already applied to fuel in the road transport domain. Politically it would seem that applying a uniform CO 2 cost <b>accross</b> <b>the</b> <b>board</b> of all energy domains will have a much more limited effect on the road vehicle technologis, than an other technologies such as those used for building heating and air conditioning...|$|R
