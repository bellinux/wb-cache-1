The article included the following passage: [...] "She loves America's Funniest Home Videos but remains baffled after sampling The Simpsons. [...] "It was the dumbest thing I had ever seen," [...] she says, [...] "but it's a family thing, and I guess it's clean." [...] The writers decided to respond by privately sending a polite letter on September 28 to Bush where they posed as Marge Simpson. On October 9, Bush sent a reply: [...] "Dear Marge, How kind of you to write. I'm glad you spoke your mind ... I foolishly didn't know you had one. I am looking at <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>you...</b> depicted on a plastic cup... with your blue hair filled with pink birds peeking out all over. Evidently, you and your charming family— Lisa, Homer, Bart and Maggie— are camping out. It's a nice family scene. Clearly you are setting a good example {{for the rest of}} the country. Please forgive a loose tongue." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I can't {{believe that}} you have thought of me so much as I have thought of you," [...] said Philip, timidly. [...] "Do you know, when I was away, I made <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> as you looked that morning in the study when {{you said you would}} not forget me." ...|$|E

50|$|Socially speaking, ambient {{awareness}} and social media {{are products of}} the new generations who are being born or {{growing up in the}} digital age, starting circa in 1998 and running to current times. Social media is personal media (what you're doing in the moment, how <b>you</b> feel, <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> where <b>you</b> are) combined with social communication. Social media is the lattice work for ambient awareness. Without social media the state of ambient awareness cannot exist.|$|R

It was <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> in riding-habit with your blue-ribbon horse, White Stockings--remember? It was taken at Newport. Well, Stewart tacked the picture up in his bunk-house and named his beautiful horse Majesty. All the cowboys knew it. They would see the picture and tease him unmercifully. But he didn't care. One day I happened to drop in on him and found him just recovering from a carouse. I saw the picture, too, and I said to him, 'Gene, if my sister knew you were a drunkard she'd not be proud of having her picture stuck up in your room.' Majesty, he did not touch a drop for a month, and when he did drink again he took the picture down, and he has never put it back." ...|$|E

5000|$|Flynt becomes {{smitten with}} Althea Leasure, a {{stripper}} {{who works at}} one of his clubs. With Althea and Jimmy's help, Flynt makes a fortune from sales of Hustler. With his success comes enemies - as he finds himself a hated figure of anti-pornography activists. He argues with the activists, saying that [...] "murder is illegal, but if <b>you</b> take <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> it <b>you</b> may get your name in a magazine or maybe win a Pulitzer Prize". [...] "However", he continues, [...] "sex is legal, but if <b>you</b> take <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> that act, <b>you</b> can go to jail". He becomes involved in several prominent court cases, and befriends a young lawyer, Alan Isaacman. In 1975, Flynt loses a smut-peddling court decision in Cincinnati but is released from jail soon afterwards on a technicality. Ruth Carter Stapleton, a Christian activist and sister of President Jimmy Carter, seeks out Flynt and urges him to give his life to Jesus. Flynt seems moved and starts letting his newfound religion influence everything in his life, including Hustler content.|$|R
