5000|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} bronze alloys, but typically modern bronze is 88% copper and 12% tin. <b>Alpha</b> <b>bronze</b> consists of the alpha solid solution of tin in copper. <b>Alpha</b> <b>bronze</b> alloys of 4-5% tin are used to make coins, springs, turbines and blades. Historical [...] "bronzes" [...] are highly variable in composition, as most metalworkers probably used whatever scrap was on hand; the metal of the 12th-century English Gloucester Candlestick is bronze containing a mixture of copper, zinc, tin, lead, nickel, iron, antimony, arsenic with an unusually large amount of silver - between 22.5% in the base and 5.76% in the pan below the candle. The proportions of this mixture suggests that the candlestick was made from a hoard of old coins. The Benin Bronzes are really brass, and the Romanesque Baptismal font at St Bartholomew's Church, Liège is described as both bronze and brass.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} bronze alloys, and the term is now tending to be regarded by museums as too imprecise, and replaced in descriptions by [...] "copper alloy", especially for older objects. Typically modern bronze is 88% copper and 12% tin. <b>Alpha</b> <b>bronze</b> consists of the alpha solid solution of tin in copper. <b>Alpha</b> <b>bronze</b> alloys of 4-5% tin are used to make coins {{and a number of}} mechanical applications.

40|$|Scrap {{printed circuit}} boards were {{selectively}} smelted at 1 200 °C to produce a metallic alloy having three phases. These phases were identified as a lead-rich phase, a low tin content <b>alpha</b> <b>bronze</b> phase, and a high tin delta phase. Electrochemical leaching studies on this alloy were done in 1 mol/dm 3 sulfuric acid or in 2 mol/dm 3 hydrochloric acid (adjusted to an ionic strength of 3 mol/dm 3). The lead rich phase was more strongly passivated in sulfate media, and in this medium the high tin content delta bronze was more resistant to corrosion than the lower tin <b>alpha</b> <b>bronze</b> phase. In chloride medium the lead phase and both bronze phases corroded readily, but with current densities about {{an order of magnitude}} lower than in sulfate medium (static conditions) for the bronze phases. The high tin delta bronze phase was found to form a passivating layer in sulfate media. A similar layer was not seen in chloride medium. The leaching studies in sulfate medium also showed the existence of an <b>alpha</b> <b>bronze</b> phase of lower tin content in the centres of the alpha phase grains. This phase was quite resistant to leaching in sulfate medium...|$|E
50|$|The <b>Alpha</b> Rho Chi <b>Bronze</b> Medal {{is awarded}} {{annually}} at accredited schools of architecture in the United States and Canada to honor graduating seniors who have demonstrated leadership, service, {{and the promise}} of professional merit. The recipients of the medal are decided by the faculty of each school. Membership in the fraternity is not a criterion for the award, nor is membership conferred to the medal's recipients. The medal program was established in 1931. Designed by sculptor Robert Merrell Gage, the medal is cast in bronze and features an image of a seated Athena holding a skyscraper.|$|R
40|$|A brief {{overview}} is given {{of the issues}} regarding the processing of waste {{electrical and electronic equipment}} (WEEE). The printed circuit board component of WEEE is an exceptionally complex feed to possible recycling processes. Scrap printed circuit boards were selectively smelted at 1 200 °C to produce a metallic alloy. Iron and aluminium were found not {{to be part of the}} alloy. The alloy was characterized by SEM-EDS, and three phases were identified: <b>alpha</b> and delta <b>bronzes,</b> and a leadrich phase. Calculations show that about 56 mass per cent of the alloy is the alpha phase, 35 per cent delta phase and 9 per cent lead phase. A simplified approach using appropriate binary phase diagrams was used to derive a phase composition for the alloy. This was further backed by FactSage calculations, which showed that the simplified approach was appropriate for this alloy. The experimental findings and theory were found to agree well...|$|R
