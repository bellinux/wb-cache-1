Evacuees were provided blankets {{on one of the}} flights to remain warm. Complications with the only in-flight refueling on the return nearly prevented refueling, which would have forced {{the helicopters}} to divert to the Somali desert and await a rescue. At 9:40, the helicopters arrived on Guam and unloaded the evacuees.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{elected to}} bat, and Miller, {{who had been}} {{promoted}} to No. 3, shared century partnerships with Barnes (78) and Bradman (81). A middle-order collapse then ensued as the remaining Australians struggled against the local spin attack, but last man Johnston managed to hold up his end in a 37-run last-wicket partnership that allowed Miller to reach his double century. He ended on 202 not out as Australia were dismissed for 448. The Australian-born slow bowler Vic Jackson was the best Leicestershire bowler, taking 5/91. Leicestershire scored only 130 in their first innings; another Australian expatriate, Jack Walsh, top-scored with 33. Ring took 5/34 and the hosts hampered their batting efforts with two run outs. Australia enforced the follow on and Leicestershire faced {{the prospect of being}} bowled out twice in a day after Johnson took the first wickets to have them 5/83. After a rain delay Australia took the final five wickets for 34 runs in <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> final day; Leicestershire were all out for 147 in an innings defeat. Johnson ended with 7/42.|$|E

5|$|In the 1920s, {{off-peak}} {{there was}} a train every 4–5minutes from Wembley Park to Baker Street. There were generally two services per hour from both Watford and Uxbridge that ran non-stop from Wembley Park and stopping services started from Rayners Lane, Wembley Park, and Neasden, although most did not stop at Marlborough Road and St John's Wood Road. Off-peak, stations north of Moor Park were generally served by Marylebone trains. During the peak trains approached Baker Street every 2.5–3minutes, half running through to Moorgate, Liverpool Street or Aldgate. On the inner circle a train from Hammersmith ran through Baker Street every 6minutes, and Kensington (Addison Road) services terminated at Edgware Road. Maintaining a frequency of ten trains <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> circle was proving difficult and the solution chosen was for the District to extend its Putney to Kensington High Street service around the circle to Edgware Road, using the new platforms, and the Met to provide all the inner circle trains at a frequency of eight trains an hour.|$|E
5|$|Northumberland, {{named after}} the {{ceremonial}} county, was ordered on 2 September 1861 from the Millwall Ironworks. She was laid down on 10 October 1861 at its shipyard in Millwall, London. She was altered while on the building slip after Sir Edward Reed succeeded Isaac Watts as Chief Constructor. Unlike her half-sisters, the ship spent five years on the stocks before {{she was ready to}} be launched, partially due to frequent changes in design, although Northumberland was much closer to completion. The additional weight caused her stick for <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> slipway before she slid halfway down with her stern only supported by air, threatening to buckle the ship. Efforts by hydraulic jacks and tugboats failed to get her into the water on the next spring tide failed, but the use of pontoons on 17 April 1866 proved successful. Her builders went into bankruptcy while the ship was being launched and the liquidators seized Northumberland as a company asset once she was in the water. Eight months passed before the Admiralty could take possession and begin fitting out the ship. She was commissioned in October 1868 and completed on 8 October for a cost a total of £444,256.|$|E

25|$|Although T1 patrol {{spent about}} <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> airfield, {{none of the}} New Zealanders had been hit and none of their {{vehicles}} had been put out of action. The LRDG drivers were skilled at manoeuvering at high speed, thus making their vehicles difficult targets, {{while at the same}} time the gunners were capable of keeping up an accurate and heavy concentration of fire. Another possible factor in the lack of damage to the unit was that the numerous anti-aircraft guns defending the airfield had been unable to fire horizontally along the ground.|$|E
25|$|Whymper {{and party}} stayed <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> summit. Then they began their descent. Croz descended first, then Hadow, Hudson and Douglas, Taugwalder senior, Whymper with Taugwalder junior coming last. They climbed down with great care, {{only one man}} moving at a time. When they were barely an hour from the summit and were all on the rope, Hadow slipped and fell on Croz, who {{was in front of}} him. Croz, who was unprepared, was unable to {{withstand}} the shock; they both fell and pulled down Hudson and Douglas. On hearing Croz's shout, Whymper and Taugwalder clasped the rocks; they stood firm but the rope broke. Whymper saw them slide down the slope, trying with convulsive hands to stop themselves, and then falling from rock to rock and finally disappearing {{over the edge of the}} precipice.|$|E
25|$|The party {{started from}} Zermatt on 13 July at half-past five. The eight members {{included}} Peter Taugwalder {{and his two}} sons, Peter and Joseph, who were acting as porters. At 8.20 they reached the chapel at Schwarzsee, where they picked up some material that was left there. They continued along the ridge and at half past eleven they reached {{the base of the}} peak. Then they left the ridge and proceeded for half <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> east face. Before twelve o'clock they had found a good position for the tent, and at a height of 3,380 metres they set the bivouac. Meanwhile, Croz and young Peter Taugwalder went on to explore the route, in order to save time on the following day. They turned back before 3 p.m., reporting that that ridge offered no great difficulties.|$|E

25|$|The {{university}} {{grew at a}} {{rapid rate}} throughout the 1960s, with three colleges and many other buildings on campus being completed {{by the end of}} the decade. The 1970s saw further construction, but the university also encountered the biggest physical problem in its history. The university had been built above a tunnel on the disused Canterbury and Whitstable Railway. In July 1974 the tunnel collapsed, damaging part of the Cornwallis Building, which sank nearly a metre within about <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> evening of 11 July. Fortunately, the university had insurance against subsidence, so it was able to pay for the south-west corner of the building to be demolished and replaced by a new wing at the other end of the building. Building elsewhere included the Park Wood accommodation village and the Darwin houses in 1989.|$|E

500|$|In July 1942, Kenney {{received}} {{orders to}} take over the Allied Air Forces and Fifth Air Force in General Douglas MacArthur's Southwest Pacific Area. MacArthur had been dissatisfied with the performance of his air commander, Lieutenant General George Brett. Andrews, by then a major general, turned down the job, and, offered a choice between Kenney and Major General James Doolittle, MacArthur chose Kenney. Kenney reported to MacArthur in Brisbane on 28 July 1942, and was treated to [...] "a lecture for approximately <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> shortcomings of the Air Force in general, and the Allied Air Forces in the Southwest Pacific in particular." [...] Kenney felt that MacArthur did not understand air operations, but recognized that he somehow needed to establish a good working relationship with him. When he asked MacArthur for authority to send people he considered [...] "deadwood" [...] home, something that his superiors in Washington, D.C. had refused to give, MacArthur enthusiastically approved.|$|E

500|$|Five C-47s of the 375th Troop Carrier Group {{carrying}} the gunners of the 2/4th Field Regiment {{took off from}} Ward's Airfield after the main force and landed at Tsili Tsili. After <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground, they set out for Nadzab. Most jumped from the first two aircraft. The next three aircraft dropped equipment, including the dismantled guns. The [...] "pushers out" [...] followed when the aircraft made a second pass over the drop. One Australian injured his shoulder in the drop. The gunners then had to locate and assemble their guns in the tall grass. Enough parts were found to assemble one gun and have it ready for firing within {{two and a half}} hours of dropping, although to maintain surprise they did not carry out registration fire until morning. It took three days to find the missing parts and assemble the other gun. At 1515, two B-17s dropped 192 boxes of ammunition. Their dropping was accurate, but some boxes of ammunition tore away from their parachutes.|$|E
500|$|Captain Henry Blackwood {{arrived at}} Merton early on 2 September, {{bringing}} {{news that the}} French and Spanish fleets had combined and were currently at anchor in Cádiz. Nelson hurried to London where he met cabinet ministers and was given command of the fleet blockading Cádiz. It was while attending one of these meetings on 12 September, with Lord Castlereagh, the Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, that Nelson and Major General Arthur Wellesley, the future Duke of Wellington, met briefly in a waiting room. Wellington was waiting to be debriefed on his Indian operations, and Nelson on his chase and future plans. Wellington later recalled, [...] "He (Nelson) entered at once into conversation with me, if I can call it conversation, for it was almost all on his side and all about himself and, in reality, a style so vain and so silly as to surprise and almost disgust me." [...] However, {{after a few minutes}} Nelson left the room and having been told who his companion was, returned and entered into an earnest and intelligent discussion with the young Wellesley which lasted for a quarter of <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> war, the state of the colonies and the geopolitical situation, that left a marked impression upon Wellesley. This was the only meeting between the two men.|$|E
500|$|Upon release, [...] "Tuscan Leather" [...] {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} from music critics, recognizing {{it as one}} of the most powerful intros to a hip-hop album in years. In her review of the album, Erika Ramirez of Billboard said of the song: [...] "Drake is aware of his greatness, and makes sure listeners are just as aware from the jump." [...] Andrew Unterberger of Popdust commended the song for being a strong opener, similar to his other album opener's; [...] "Fireworks" [...] and [...] "Over My Dead Body". Unterberger praised the use of the Whitney Houston sample, and finished his review as saying: [...] "How much time is Drake spending on the intro? As much time as he goddamn pleases, and if he wants to go <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> beat, we’ll listen for the whole thing and not check our watch once." [...] Writing for Spin, Brandon Soderberg included [...] "Tuscan Leather" [...] as one of the [...] "Rap Songs of the Week", calling it [...] "expertly conceptualized" [...] and praised it as properly introducing the album. Will Lavin of Gigwise gave the song a positive review, noting Drake's in depth discussions about his label, his friends, and his peers. Lavin went on to say: [...] "For Drake, when it comes to album openers, his track record is thought provokingly flawless." ...|$|E

2500|$|Later {{on in the}} letter, Gottlieb {{stated that}} he still had faith in Toole {{as a writer and}} that he wished to hold onto the {{manuscript}} in case he or Toole would be able to see a way around his objections. Toole decided that it would be best for Gottlieb to return the manuscript, saying [...] "Aside from a few deletions, I don't think I could really do much to the book now—and of course even with revisions you might not be satisfied." [...] Toole made a trip to New York to see Gottlieb in person; however, he was out of town and Toole came back disappointed. He felt that he had embarrassed himself by giving a rambling, uncomfortable speech explaining his situation to one of Gottlieb's office staff. He returned home having left a note for Gottlieb to call him, and they later talked for <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> phone.
