500|$|When the {{producers}} were auditioning actors for roles in Lost, Harold Perrineau {{was in the}} area. The producers called it a [...] "natural move" [...] to have him audition. Although initially skeptical about the show, he took the role when Lost creator J. J. Abrams explained more <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> of children were seen {{for the role of}} Walt. They were narrowed down to the top three, with Malcolm David Kelley winning it, after {{the producers}} were impressed with his role in Antwone Fisher. [...] Abrams had worked with Terry O'Quinn previously on Alias, and was keen to work with him again. He explained to O'Quinn that although the role in the first episodes would be fairly small, the character will develop afterwards. O'Quinn took the role as he trusted Abrams. He was also the only character who did not have to officially audition for a part of a main character. The producers were looking for someone who had a [...] "Paris Hilton quality" [...] to play Shannon, but she could not just be shallow, as the storyline would require more than that. [...] A lot of women were auditioned before the producers finally settled on Maggie Grace. She was written to be an antipathetic character in the first season as the producers needed a character they could use to create opposition and conflict. Unlike many other characters of the first season, who were rewritten based on their actors, Boone was largely the same through production. He was originally going to be named Boone Anthony Markham V, going by the nickname, [...] "Five". Ian Somerhalder was cast in the role, but {{he did not want to}} shoot a pilot; however, he jumped at the opportunity once he found out he would be working with Abrams.|$|E
