25|$|Wings with an {{asymmetrical}} {{cross section}} {{are the norm}} in subsonic flight. Wings with a symmetrical cross section can also generate lift by using a positive angle of attack to deflect air downward. Symmetrical <b>airfoils</b> have higher stalling speeds than cambered <b>airfoils</b> of the same wing area but are used in aerobatic aircraft as they provide practical performance whether the aircraft is upright or inverted. Another example comes from sailboats, where the sail is a thin membrane with no path-length difference between {{one side and the}} other.|$|E
25|$|The {{arrays of}} <b>airfoils</b> {{are set in}} rows, usually as pairs: one {{rotating}} and one stationary. The rotating <b>airfoils,</b> also known as blades or rotors, accelerate the fluid. The stationary <b>airfoils,</b> also known as stators or vanes, decelerate and redirect the flow direction of the fluid, preparing it for the rotor blades of the next stage. Axial compressors are almost always multi-staged, with the cross-sectional area of the gas passage diminishing along the compressor to maintain an optimum axial Mach number. Beyond about 5 stages or a 4:1 design pressure ratio a compressor will not function unless fitted with features such as stationary vanes with variable angles (known as {{variable inlet guide vanes}} and variable stators), the ability to allow some air to escape part-way along the compressor (known as interstage bleed) and being split into more than one rotating assembly (known as twin spools, for example).|$|E

25|$|Single rotor {{helicopters}} {{are limited}} in forward speed {{by a combination of}} sonic tip speed and retreating blade stall. As the advance ratio increases, the relative velocity experienced by the retreating blade decreases so that the tip of the blade experiences zero velocity at an advance ratio of one. Helicopter rotors pitch the retreating blade to a higher angle of attack to maintain lift as the relative velocity decreases. At a sufficiently high advance ratio, the blade will reach the stalling angle of attack and experience retreating blade stall. Specially designed <b>airfoils</b> can increase the operating advance ratio by utilizing high lift coefficient <b>airfoils.</b> Currently, single rotor helicopters are practically limited to advance ratios less than 0.7.|$|E

Therefore, the optimization of <b>airfoil</b> is necessary before the design of nano rotor. Nano rotor blade <b>airfoil</b> optimization is a multi-objective problem since the <b>airfoil</b> suffers a wide range of Reynolds number which increases the difficulty of optimization. In this paper, the <b>airfoil</b> of nano rotor was optimized based on the controlled elitist Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) coupling with the parameterization method of Class function/Shape function Transformation technique (CST) and the multi-objectives function processing method of statistical definition of stability.
