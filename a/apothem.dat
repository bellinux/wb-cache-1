40|$|AbstractThe paper {{addresses}} the dimensional tolerance and assembly accuracy of prosthetic components obtained by different manufacturing processes. The success of single tooth implant replacements {{hangs on the}} stability of the hexagonal connection, but no standard control procedures are available for its evaluation. The research aims at proposing a new protocol for the dimensional assessment of implant-abutment connections, based on non-contact measurement and statistical data processing. The procedure is applied to machined- and cast-on abutments, as well of the matching implants. Samples are measured using an optical measuring microscope and data are processed to obtain the international tolerance (IT) grade. The rotational misfit is then calculated using the <b>apothems</b> of the external and the internal hexagon. As to the results, all the components are classified between IT 8 and IT 9 and the maximum rotational misfit is around 4 ° for all the assemblies, inferior to the critical limits for the screw joint stability. An objective dimensional characterization of prosthetic components and assemblies is reported, which is the basis for their reliability in clinical applications. From a wider perspective, an original measuring protocol is proposed, independent of parts assembly and based on international tolerances...|$|R
2500|$|A pyramid {{in which}} the <b>apothem</b> (slant height along the {{bisector}} of a face) is equal to [...] times the semi-base (half the base width) is sometimes called a golden pyramid.

50|$|The {{perimeter}} {{in terms}} of <b>apothem</b> is:This coefficient is double the coefficient found in the <b>apothem</b> equation for area.|$|E
50|$|The area of {{a regular}} polygon is half its {{perimeter}} times the <b>apothem</b> (where the <b>apothem</b> is {{the distance from the}} center to the nearest point on any side).|$|E
5000|$|This {{can be seen}} by subdividing the unit-sided heptagon into seven {{triangular}} [...] "pie slices" [...] with vertices at {{the center}} and at the heptagon's vertices, and then halving each triangle using the <b>apothem</b> as the common side. The <b>apothem</b> is half the cotangent of [...] and the area of each of the 14 small triangles is one-fourth of the <b>apothem.</b>|$|E
50|$|For {{a regular}} n-gon, {{the sum of}} the {{perpendicular}} distances from any interior point to the n sides is n times the <b>apothem</b> (the <b>apothem</b> being the distance from the center to any side). This is a generalization of Viviani's theorem for the n=3 case.|$|E
50|$|The <b>apothem</b> a {{can be used}} to {{find the}} area of any regular n-sided polygon of side length s {{according}} to the following formula, which also states that the area is equal to the <b>apothem</b> multiplied by half the perimeter since ns = p.This formula can be derived by partitioning the n-sided polygon into n congruent isosceles triangles, and then noting that the <b>apothem</b> is the height of each triangle, and that the area of a triangle equals half the base times the height.|$|E
50|$|The <b>apothem</b> of {{a regular}} polygon can be found {{multiple}} ways.|$|E
50|$|The area of {{a regular}} polygon is half its {{perimeter}} times the <b>apothem.</b> As the number of sides of the regular polygon increases, the polygon tends to a circle, and the <b>apothem</b> tends to the radius. This suggests that the {{area of a}} disk is half the circumference of its bounding circle times the radius.|$|E

50|$|If a polygon is regular (both {{equiangular}} and equilateral), {{the sum of}} {{the distances}} to the sides from an interior point is independent of the location of the point. Specifically, it equals n times the <b>apothem,</b> where n is the number of sides and the <b>apothem</b> is the distance from the center to a side. However, the converse does not hold; the non-square parallelogram is a counterexample.|$|E
50|$|For {{a regular}} pyramid, {{which is a}} pyramid whose base is a regular polygon, the <b>apothem</b> is the slant height of a lateral face; that is, the {{shortest}} distance from apex to base on a given face. For a truncated regular pyramid (a regular pyramid with some of its peak removed by a plane parallel to the base), the <b>apothem</b> is {{the height of a}} trapezoidal lateral face.|$|E

5000|$|The circumradius R {{from the}} center of a regular polygon to one of the {{vertices}} is related to the side length s or to the <b>apothem</b> a by ...|$|E
50|$|An <b>apothem</b> of {{a regular}} polygon {{will always be a}} radius of the inscribed circle. It is also the minimum {{distance}} between any side of the polygon and its center.|$|E
5000|$|... where P is the {{perimeter}} of the polygon, and r is the inradius (equivalently the <b>apothem).</b> Substituting the regular pentagon's values for P and r gives the formulawith side length t.|$|E
50|$|For an {{equilateral}} triangle, the <b>apothem</b> {{is equivalent}} to the line segment from the midpoint of a side to any of the triangle's centers, since an equilateral triangle's centers coincide {{as a consequence of the}} definition.|$|E

5000|$|For regular polygons, {{the radius}} {{is the same}} as its circumradius. [...] The inradius of a regular polygon is also called <b>apothem.</b> In graph theory, the radius of a graph is the minimum over all {{vertices}} u of the maximum distance from u to any other vertex of the graph.|$|E
50|$|Every {{regular polygon}} is bicentric. In a regular polygon, the {{incircle}} and the circumcircle are concentric - that is, {{they share a}} common center, {{which is also the}} center of the regular polygon, so the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is always zero. The radius of the inscribed circle is the <b>apothem</b> (the shortest distance from the center to the boundary of the regular polygon).|$|E
5000|$|The <b>apothem</b> (sometimes {{abbreviated}} as apo) of {{a regular}} polygon is a line segment from the center to the midpoint {{of one of its}} sides. Equivalently, it is the line drawn {{from the center of the}} polygon that is perpendicular to one of its sides. The word [...] "apothem" [...] can also refer to the length of that line segment. Regular polygons are the only polygons that have apothems. Because of this, all the apothems in a polygon will be congruent.|$|E
5000|$|The common {{length of}} the sides equals the radius of the {{circumscribed}} circle, which equals [...] times the <b>apothem</b> (radius of the inscribed circle). All internal angles are 120 degrees. A regular hexagon has 6 rotational symmetries (rotational symmetry of order six) and 6 reflection symmetries (six lines of symmetry), making up the dihedral group D6. The longest diagonals of a regular hexagon, connecting diametrically opposite vertices, are twice the length of one side. From this {{it can be seen}} that a triangle with a vertex at the center of the regular hexagon and sharing one side with the hexagon is equilateral, and that the regular hexagon can be partitioned into six equilateral triangles.|$|E
