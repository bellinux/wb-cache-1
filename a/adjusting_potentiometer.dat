40|$|Subjects {{seated in}} a {{vertical}} axis rotation chair controlled their rotational velocity by <b>adjusting</b> a <b>potentiometer.</b> Their goal was to null out pseudorandom rotational perturbations {{in order to remain}} perceptually stationary. Most subjects showed a slow linear drift of velocity (a constant acceleration) to one side when they were deprived of an earth-fixed visual reference. The amplitude and direction of this drift can be considered a measure of a static bias in the subject's perception of rotation. The presence of a perceptual bias is consistent with a small, constant imbalance of vestibular function which could be of either central or peripheral origin. Deviations from perfect vestibulocular reflex (VOR) symmetry are also assumed to be related to imbalances in either peripheral or central vestibular function. Researchers looked for correlations between perceptual bias and various measures of vestibular reflex symmetry that might suggest a common source for both reflective and perceptual imbalances. No correlations were found. Measurement errors could not account for these results since repeated tests on the same subjects of both perceptual bias and VOR symmetry were well correlated...|$|R

Dynamical system is autonomous, deterministic and is described {{by a set of}} first-order ordinary differential equations. Our aim is to derive three different circuitry realizations each having specific properties. In the first case realization is canonical {{in the sense of the}} integrator block conception where the internal system parameters are <b>adjusted</b> by three <b>potentiometers.</b> Second realization represents modification towards independent adjustment of all four system parameters and, consequently, to tracing dynamical evolution of model solution.

50|$|In {{practical}} use, {{a series}} circuit {{is made of}} the detector, headphones, and a battery with a potentiometer. The wire is made positive, and the signal to be demodulated is applied directly to it; a small (about 5 ml) platinum cup filled with either sulfuric or nitric acid completes the headphone circuit, and is also connected to ground to complete the signal circuit. To adjust the cell, {{the point of the}} wire electrode is dipped into the electrolyte and the <b>potentiometer</b> <b>adjusted</b> until a hissing noise is heard in the headphones. The potentiometer setting is then moved to reduce the current until the noise just ceases, at which point the detector is in its most sensitive state.|$|R
40|$|Continuous offset tuning of a {{frequency}} stabilized CW gas laser {{is achieved by}} using a spectrophone filled with the same gas as the laser for sensing a dither modulation, detecting a first or second derivative of the spectrophone output with a lock-in amplifier, the detected output of which is integrated, and applying the integrator output as a correction signal through a circuit which adds to the dither signal from an oscillator a dc offset that is <b>adjusted</b> with a <b>potentiometer</b> to {{a frequency}} offset from the absorption line center of the gas, but within the spectral linewidth of the gas.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the observed-based {{realization}} {{of a given}} complex controller is used to derive an architecture suitable for its implementation. That is, an architecture in which physical tuning parameters are highlighted and can be <b>adjusted</b> as useful <b>potentiometers.</b> This approach {{is based on the}} well-known Youla controller parameterization, but its specific feature is that the on-board model, on which the observer-based realization is built, does not correspond to the synthesis model. A particular application, for which such a controller architecture is very interesting, is the implementation and adjustment of flight control laws during flight tests. Actually, the on-board last tuning is based on physical considerations and required only a few potentiometers to improve flying qualities in situ.

The ramp rate at the integrator output is further reduced by {{the ratio of the}} voltage divider (R 4, R 5). The maximum output voltage, or span, is given by the voltage across the resistor RE and is set for 25 mV.

30|$|The {{magnetic}} torque sensor has many advantages, such as durability, wide application, high reliability, and good prospects for development. It is widely concerned by researchers. ShaoPeng studied a ring torque sensor [7] {{based on the}} counter magnetostriction effect of amorphous alloy. It used the method of sticking the ribbon of the amorphous alloy. However, it was large, not easy to install, and not easy to monitor the torque in real time. Meng et al. studied a non-contact torque sensor [8] based on the change of magnetic induction, which was not suitable for dynamic measurement of torque because it needed manually <b>adjusting</b> two digital <b>potentiometers.</b> Muro et al. studied a ring torque sensor [9] based on the measurement of magnetic field by the Hall detection circuit, and magnetostrictive effect whose measuring range was small. Jiles studied the theory of magnetomechanical effects [10] and it provided a theoretical basis for the {{magnetic torque}} sensor. Sablik et al. studied the magnetostriction when the magnetic shaft suffered a tensile or compressive stress and applied a magnetic field. The stress and magnetic field were coaxial [11]. The torque sensor proposed in this paper uses the non-contact signal extraction circuit to detect the deflection angle of magnetization vector and explores {{the relationship between the}} deflection angle and the torque; instead of using the wireless communication equipment, the non-contact torque measurement is realized directly.|$|R
