25|$|The {{attempt by}} Austria {{to ensure a}} new {{administrative}} formula in the 1860s saw Mocioni's co-option into the Imperial Diet. He also organized, in 1860, a National Assembly in the Banat, an abortive project seeking to obtain autonomy on ethnic grounds. He then oscillated between ethnic federalism within a nominal Hungarian realm and full centralism in Austria's custody, while failing in his bid to promote election boycott as a political weapon. He had noted political rivalries with Romanians who sided with Hungarian radicalism, in particular Eftimie Murgu. Serving one full term in the Diet of Hungary, Mocioni also turned to cooperation with the Romanians of Transylvania, and helped Andrei Șaguna to reestablish an independent Transylvanian Metropolis for Romanian Orthodox Christians.

25|$|The trial, {{which opened}} in February 2003, centred on whether Baker had {{been aware of the}} {{contents}} of the suitcase as well as an examination of the interrogation records and the confession he had signed. Baker claimed that the statement was mispresentation of his words <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>lawyer,</b> Shunji Miyake, argued that since there was no video or audio recording of the interrogations, and no defence lawyer was present, {{there was no way to}} check whether falsifications and mistranslations had taken place. Miyake also questioned what he claimed were the 'leading nature' of the questions asked by the interrogators. Baker maintained that the bag was Prunier's, that he had never had the key to the case, and that he had been tricked into carrying the bag by Prunier. Prunier had been arrested for drug smuggling in Belgium a month after Baker's arrest, and his co-accused in the Belgian case had also claimed that Prunier had duped them into carrying bags with drugs.

500|$|Producer Kevin Feige {{commented on}} {{this version of}} the film, believing [...] "the people who had other {{opinions}} [...] will be won over by this new version." [...] Reviewers like Empires Danny Graydon seemed to reaffirm this opinion by considering this version a [...] "considerable improvement on the original version," [...] notably preferring the more violent undertones, a lesser focus on the romance, and the equal focus of Daredevil <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>lawyer</b> alias Matt Murdock and the subplot involving Coolio. Some critics continued to feel Affleck was unsuitable as Daredevil and that Duncan portrayed the Kingpin in an over-the-top manner. IGN's Jeff Otto and Andy Patrizio also deemed this version an improvement over the original. They felt this version was more loyal to the Frank Miller feel of the Daredevil world, with more focus on themes such as Murdock's struggle with his Catholic upbringing. On the whole they felt the film would be far more pleasing to the fans, and overall better than the theatrical release.|$|E
