5|$|A few {{thousand}} {{of the first}} circulation strikes, {{as well as a}} handful of proof coins, came from a prototype die with smaller letters in the motto than all other 1864 pieces. Although specimens of the two-cent piece, being of base metal, were not set <b>aside</b> <b>for</b> testing by the annual Assay Commission, Congress did order that internal checks be done at the Mint as to their composition and weight.|$|E

5|$|Already {{suffering}} from food shortages {{due to a}} five-month drought, President Fidel Castro announced {{that the government would}} supply people under the age of 14 and those over 60, which accounts for roughly 36% of Cuba's population, with extra food aid. An estimated 156,000 tonnes of food was set <b>aside</b> <b>for</b> this action and the food was worth several million dollars. People who qualified for the aid would receive 4.4lbs (2kg) of rice and peas if they lived in western Cuba and 6.6lbs (3kg) if they lived in eastern Cuba per month until July 1999. The United Nations World Food Program provided $20.5million in aid for both the effects of the drought and Georges. By December, the Cuban Government requested $90million to help recover from the hurricane and drought. By this time, about $40million had already been set <b>aside</b> <b>for</b> the same reason. The Cuban Red Cross supplied shelter for more than 92,000 residents and supplied them with hygiene kits, food, water, and other relief materials.|$|E
5|$|An all-rounder with a {{moderate}} first class record (averaging 32 with the bat and 40 with the ball), Cowdrey's debut as {{captain in the}} Fourth Test at Headingley was a disaster. He scored 0 and 5 and took no wickets, as England were crushed by 10 wickets, West Indies again winning at a canter. Worse for Cowdrey, he suffered a minor injury in a county match and was persuaded to step <b>aside</b> <b>for</b> the Fifth Test. He never played for England again.|$|E
5|$|Cocaine {{was already}} so {{prevalent}} {{on the set}} (like many other film productions of that era) that Aykroyd, who used far less than his partner, claims {{a section of the}} budget was actually set <b>aside</b> <b>for</b> purchases of the drug during night shooting. The stars had a private bar, the Blues Club, built on the set, for themselves, crew, and friends. Carrie Fisher, Aykroyd's girlfriend at the time, says most of the bar's staff doubled as dealers, procuring any drug patrons desired.|$|E

5|$|Coinage of eagles {{followed}} {{shortly after}} production of half eagles began, although the exact date is uncertain. The first group produced {{is believed to}} have been struck in August and September 1795; 1,097 eagles were made available for circulation on September 22. Four hundred of these were immediately paid out to the Bank of Pennsylvania, which had deposited gold at the Mint for striking into eagles. One piece was put <b>aside</b> <b>for</b> the Mint's coin collection by Eckfeldt.|$|E

5|$|Halliday and Hamilton {{left at the}} end of that championship-winning season, and Halliday was {{replaced}} by Davie Shaw. Aberdeen won the League Cup under his guidance, beating St Mirren in 1955–56, and reached another Scottish Cup final in 1959. However, Shaw stepped <b>aside</b> <b>for</b> another former favourite player, Tommy Pearson, in 1959. Pearson's time in charge coincided with a high turnover of players, and yielded no trophies. He retired in 1965, making way for Eddie Turnbull.|$|E

5|$|In 1985, {{almost no}} {{country in the}} world had a women's {{national}} football team. Djibouti was no exception: women's football was not officially organised in the country until 2002 and then, only for players sixteen years and older. As of 2009, there were only eight women's clubs for these players in the country. There is a regional and national women's competition, which was established in 2007. The league provided the first opportunity for women outside the capital and major cities to play football. The country has a women's national team but has no youth teams, meaning no U17 or U20 teams. 12% of the money from the FIFA Financial Assistance Programme (FAP) is targeted at the technical development of the game, which includes women's football, sport medicine and futsal. This compares to 11% specifically set <b>aside</b> <b>for</b> men's competitions and 10% set <b>aside</b> <b>for</b> youth football. Between 1991 and 2010, there was no FIFA FUTURO III regional course for women's coaching. A FUTURO III regional course men's coaching workshop was hosted in 2008. In 2007, there was a women's football seminar held in the country. In 2007, there was a FIFA MA course held for women/youth football.|$|E
5|$|In March 1825, Lafayette {{began to}} tour the {{southern}} and western states. The general pattern of the trip {{was that he would}} be escorted between cities by the state militia, and he would enter each town through specially constructed arches to be welcomed by local politicians or dignitaries, all eager to be seen with Lafayette. There would be special events, visits to battlefields and historic sites, celebratory dinners, and time set <b>aside</b> <b>for</b> the public to meet the legendary hero of the Revolution.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the storm, the Government of El Salvador was criticized for failing to keep the public well informed. It provided over $300,000 in aid and declared a state of emergency; additionally, a state of mourning was declared. The United Nations World Food program began distributing food set <b>aside</b> <b>for</b> victims of the El Salvador Civil War. The U.S. Embassy in Guatemala provided $25,000 in aid for the country. Mexican authorities rushed to supply food and water to the homeless.|$|E

In a show of support for this rule, Stein & Co. and AT adopted the rule for their private development.|$|E
