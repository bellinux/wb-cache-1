500|$|Regarding the {{negative}} {{impacts of the}} potential direct and indirect effect of land use changes on carbon emissions, the study commissioned by the Dutch government concluded that [...] "it {{is very difficult to}} determine the indirect effects of further land use for sugar cane production (i.e. sugar cane replacing another crop like soy or citrus crops, which in turn causes additional soy plantations replacing pastures, which in turn may cause deforestation), and also not logical to attribute all these soil carbon losses to sugar cane". The Brazilian agency Embrapa estimates that there is enough agricultural land available to increase at least 30 times the existing sugarcane plantation without endangering sensible ecosystems or taking land destined for food crops. Most future growth is expected to take place on abandoned pasture lands, as it has been the historical trend in São Paulo state. Also, productivity is expected to improve even further based on current biotechnology research, genetic improvement, and better <b>agronomic</b> <b>practices,</b> thus contributing to reduce land demand for future sugarcane cultures.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although {{table grape}} {{is one of}} the most {{cultivated}} and consumed fruits worldwide, no study has been reported on its geographical origin or <b>agronomic</b> <b>practice</b> based on stable isotope ratios. This study aimed to evaluate the usefulness of isotopic ratios (i. e. 2 H/ 1 H, 13 C/ 12 C, 15 N/ 14 N and 18 O/ 16 O) as possible markers to discriminate the <b>agronomic</b> <b>practice</b> (conventional versus organic farming) and provenance of table grape. RESULTS: In order to quantitatively evaluate which of the isotopic variables were more discriminating, a t test was carried out, in light of which only δ 13 C and δ 18 O provided statistically significant differences (P ≤ 0. 05) for the discrimination of geographical origin and farming method. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed no good separation of samples differing in geographical area and agronomic practice; thus, for classification purposes, supervised approaches were carried out. In particular, general discriminant analysis (GDA) was used, resulting in prediction abilities of 75. 0 and 92. 2 % for the discrimination of farming method and origin respectively. CONCLUSION: The present findings suggest that stable isotopes (i. e. δ 18 O, δ 2 H and δ 13 C) combined with chemometrics can be successfully applied to discriminate the provenance of table grape. However, the use of bulk nitrogen isotopes was not effective for farming method discrimination. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The arbuscular {{mycorrhizal}} {{fungi in}} the soil may establish an association with plant roots (mycorrhiza) which benefits the nutrient absorption by the plants and increase {{the effects of the}} applied inputs on plant growth.

The crop rotation is an <b>agronomic</b> <b>practice</b> that improves the propagation of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in the soil and stimulates mycorrhiza establishment and its effects in plant growth. An adequate rotational sequence to improve formation impplies in the use of mycorrhizal dependent cultures.

30|$|Diversifying crop types {{is another}} <b>agronomic</b> <b>practice</b> {{emerging}} as adaptation {{strategy in the}} study locations attributed to farmers’ risk aversion behavior.

This strategy is also further driven by improved access to market and growing experience of irrigation practices in the area. This result confirms the findings of previous studies that reported crop diversification as a contemporary practice in response to climate change (Asrat and Simane 2017 c; Nkonya et al. 2011). However, it is contrary to Jones and Thornton (2010), who predicted that climate change would induce a shift from crop to livestock production.|$|R

40|$|Most of the {{available}} research {{studies have focused on}} the production of high grain yields of wheat and have neglected yield stability. However, yield stability is a relevant factor in <b>agronomic</b> <b>practice</b> and, therefore, is the focus of this comprehensive survey. The aim was to first describe the importance of yield stability as well as currently used practical management strategies that ensure yield stability in wheat production and secondly, to obtain potential research areas supporting yield stability in the complex system of agronomy. The target groups were German farmers with experience in wheat production and advisors with expertise in the field of wheat cultivation or research. A sample size of 615 completed questionnaires formed the data basis of this study. The study itself provides evidence that the yield stability of winter wheat is even more important than the amount of yield for a large proportion of farmers (48 %) and advisors (47 %). Furthermore, {{in the view of the}} majority of the surveyed farmers and advisors, yield stability is gaining importance in climate change. Data analysis showed that site adapted cultivar choice, favorable crop rotations and integrated plant protection are ranked as three of the most important <b>agronomic</b> management <b>practices</b> to achieve high yield stability of wheat. Soil tillage and fertilization occupied a middle position, whereas sowing date and sowing density were estimated with lower importance.

40|$|Nitrogen {{fertilizer}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important inputs to corn production and farmers manage their crop by deciding how much to apply, when to apply it and how to apply it to maximize their yields and resulting profit. There is risk inherent in crop fertility management because once nitrogen is applied to the soil it is no longer immobile and cropland is subject to loss of this costly input under different weather conditions.

We conducted a meta-analysis of 38 published field trials with 333 observations {{to determine the}} effects of inoculation and root colonization by inoculated and non-inoculated (resident) AMF on P, N and Zn uptake, growth and grain yield of wheat. Field AMF inoculation increased aboveground biomass, grain yield, harvest index, aboveground biomass P concentration and content, straw P content, aboveground biomass N concentration and content, grain N content and grain Zn concentration. Grain yield was positively correlated with root AMF colonization rate, whereas straw biomass was negatively correlated. The most important drivers of wheat growth response to AMF were organic matter concentration, pH, total N and available P concentration, and texture of soil, as well as climate and the AMF species inoculated.

40|$|This study {{demonstrated}} that urea {{inclusion in the}} foliar Fe-­‐EDTA treatment solution significantly improved leaf penetration and translocation of Fe from the treated flag leaf at the reproductive growth stage (Table 1). When including urea in the treatment solution, the proportion of 59 Fe found in grains increased from 8. 8 to 34. 6 %, but this enhancing urea effect was not observed for 59 Fe translocation into shoots (Table 1). This result implies that transport of leaf-­‐applied Fe into grains is, at least partly, a sink-­‐driven process because developing grains are better competitors than shoots at the reproductive growth stage (Marschner, 2012). Results clearly indicate that urea facilitated penetration of Fe into, and translocation from the treated leaf, to the other plant parts such as grains. Treatments of leaf tips with urea increased concentration of soluble amino acids in the treated part of the leaves which probably contributed to transportation of Fe in the plant.
