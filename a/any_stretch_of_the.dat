5|$|In June, {{predictions}} from CSU and TSR {{were similar}} to pre-season forecasts due to the a lack of an El Niño and warmer-than-average sea surface temperatures across the Atlantic Ocean. However, by July and August, CSU and TSR all adjusted their forecasts downward because of predictions of cooler-than-average sea surface temperatures and above-average wind shear. NOAA also decreased the amount of activity in its final outlook, despite predicting a wetter-than-average western Africa and above-average sea surface temperatures in its report. On June3, CSU issued its first mid-season prediction {{for the remainder of}} the year. In its report, the organization continued to predict well above-average activity, with eighteen named storms, nine hurricanes, four major hurricanes, and an ACE index of 165 units. CSU stated that there was a 72% chance of at least one major hurricane impacting <b>any</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States coastline; the chances of a major hurricane hitting the East Coast and Gulf Coast were 48% and 47%, respectively. The following day, Tropical Storm Risk issued its third forecast for the 2013 Atlantic hurricane season, calling for sixteen named storms, eight hurricanes, four major hurricanes, and an ACE of 134 units; this activity was predicted to be roughly 30% above the 1950–2012 long-term mean. TSR gave a 65% probability that the landfalling ACE index would be above-average. A month later, TSR lowered its numbers to 15named storms, seven hurricanes, and three major hurricanes. On August2, Colorado State University issued another update for the season, lowering its numbers slightly. However, the organization continued to state that there was an above-average probability of a United States and Caribbean major hurricane landfall. Finally, on August8, NOAA issued its second and final outlook for the season, predicting 13 to 19 named storms, six to nine hurricanes, and three to five major hurricanes; these numbers were down slightly from its May outlook.|$|E

It also affirmed the principle of local participation in federally funded projects but acknowledged that the $292 million already spent by local interests was sufficient to cover local participatory costs. It is instructive to note that, in addition, sovereign immunity {{was given to the}} Corps of Engineers under Section 3 of the Flood Control Act of 1928, which states “no liability of any kind would attach or rest upon the United States for any damage from or by floods or flood waters at any place, provided that if on <b>any</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> banks of the Mississippi River it was impracticable to construct levees.” 33 U.S.C. § 702c.

[...] He continued, [...] "It wasn't perfect by <b>any</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> imagination, and it's not on the same level as the occasional brilliance that South Park reaches on about one occasion per season nowadays, but it's the most fun I've had watching the show that didn't involve a Star Wars parody in many years." [...] McFarland concluded his review by giving the episode a grade of A-. Kate Moon of TV Fanatic also enjoyed the episode, noting, [...] "'Back to the Pilot' was a great meta episode of Family Guy. From poking fun at its own flaws in the original series to acknowledging how silly the cutaway gags can be, Family Guy shone at its layered best tonight."

40|$|Interfering {{contexts}} of regulatory sequence elements E. N. Trifonov Motivation: Although one would normally expect a given regulatory element to perform best when it fully matches its consensus sequence, this is generally {{far from being}} the case. Usually, almost none <b>of</b> <b>the</b> actual sites fits the consensus exactly, and some of those that do fit do not perform well. The main reason for that is <b>the</b> very nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sequences and the messages (codes) they contain. Normally, <b>any</b> given <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sequence with one or another regulatory site not only carries this regulatory message, but several more messages of various types as well. These messages overlap with the regulatory element {{in such a way that}} the letter (base) which actually appears in any given sequence position simultaneously belongs to one or more additional codes. Apart from numerous individual codes (sequence patterns) specific for a given species or gene, there are many different general (universal) sequence codes all interacting with one another.

40|$|The Paleobiology Database now {{includes}} enough data on fossil collections to produce useful time series of geographical and environmental variables {{in addition to}} a robust global Phanerozoic marine diversity curve. The curve is produced by a new ‘shareholder quorum’ method of sampling standardization that removes biases but avoids overcompensating for them by imposing entirely uniform data quotas. It involves drawing fossil collections until the taxa that have been sampled at least once (the ‘shareholders’) have a summed total of frequencies (i. e. coverage) that meets a target (<b>the</b> ‘quorum’). Coverage <b>of</b> each interval’s entire data set is estimated prior to subsampling using a variant of a standard index, Good’s u. This variant employs counts of occurrences of taxa described in only one publication instead of taxa found in only one collection. Each taxon’s frequency within an interval is multiplied by the interval’s index value, which limits the maximum possible sampling level and thereby creates the need for subsampling. Analyses focus on a global diversity curve and curves for northern, southern and ‘tropical’ (30 °N to 30 °S) palaeolatitudinal belts. Tropical genus richness is remarkably static, so most large shifts in the curve reflect trends at higher latitudes. Changes in diversity are analysed as a function <b>of</b> standing diversity; <b>the</b> number, spacing and palaeolatitudinal position of sampled geographical cells; the mean onshore–offshore position of cells; and proportions of cells from carbonate, onshore and reefal environments. Redundancy among the variables is eliminated by performing a principal components analysis of each data set and using the axis scores in multiple regressions. The key factors are standing diversity and <b>the</b> dominance <b>of</b> onshore environments such as reefs. These factors combine to produce logistic growth patterns with slowly changing equilibrium values. There is no evidence of unregulated exponential growth across <b>any</b> long <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Phanerozoic, and in particular there was no large Cenozoic radiation beyond the Eocene. The end-Ordovician, Permo–Triassic and Cretaceous–Palaeogene mass extinctions had relatively short-term albeit severe effects. However, reef collapse was involved in these events and also may have caused large, longer term global diversity decreases in the mid-Devonian and across the Triassic/Jurassic boundary. Conversely, <b>the</b> expansion <b>of</b> reef ecosystems may explain newly recognized major radiations in the mid-Permian and mid-Jurassic. Reef ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to current environmental disturbances such as ocean acidification, and their decimation might prolong the recovery from today’s mass extinction by millions or even tens of millions of years. 25 page(s...|$|R

2500|$|Regarding his {{political}} views, Carolla has stated, [...] "I guess I would be Republican, {{in the sense}} that I want a secure border, I'm not into the welfare state, I'm not into all those freebie lunch programs. It just kind of demeans people." [...] He goes on to state, however, that he is also in favor of typically liberal causes such as the legalization of marijuana and support for as well some progressive causes such as [...] "... against semi-automatic and automatic weapons. I'm not an NRA guy by <b>any</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> imagination. I'd like alternative energy to be explored and electric cars to be used, but I want them to be powered by nuclear power plants." [...] (He {{is a member of the}} advisory board of the Marijuana Policy Project.) Elsewhere, he has stated, [...] "My feeling is this whole country is founded on the principle of 'If you are not hurting anyone, and you're not fucking with someone else's shit, and you are paying your taxes, you should be able to just do what you want to do.' It's the freedom and the independence." [...] In an interview with Reason TV, Carolla described his views as libertarian.|$|E
60|$|Pesita {{thought for}} several minutes. In {{his mind was}} a scheme which {{required}} the help of just such an individual as this stranger--someone who was utterly unknown in the surrounding country and whose presence in a town could not by <b>any</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> imagination be connected in any way with the bandit, Pesita.|$|E
50|$|Many {{of these}} new routes had few {{facilities}} such as modern runways, and this era also became <b>the</b> age <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great flying boats such as the German Dornier Do X, American Sikorsky S-42 and British Short Empire, which could operate from <b>any</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> clear, calm water.|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} reflex is the monosynaptic reflex or short-loop reflex, {{such as the}} monosynaptic stretch response. In this example, Ia afferent neurons are {{activated by}} muscle spindles when they deform due to <b>the</b> <b>stretching</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> muscle. In the spinal cord, these afferent neurons synapse directly onto alpha motor neurons that regulate <b>the</b> contraction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same muscle. Thus, <b>any</b> <b>stretching</b> <b>of</b> a muscle automatically signals a reflexive contraction of that muscle, without any central control. As the name and the description implies, monosynaptic reflexes depend on a single synaptic connection between an afferent sensory neuron and efferent motor neuron. In general <b>the</b> actions <b>of</b> monosynaptic reflexes are fixed and cannot be controlled or influenced by intention or instruction. However, {{there is some evidence}} to suggest that the gain or magnitude of these reflexes can be adjusted by context and experience.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Redfield, {{quite as}} urban as the house, was a slim little woman of {{delicate}} habit, {{very far from}} <b>the</b> ordinary conception <b>of</b> a rancher's wife. Her manner was politely considerate, but not heatedly cordial (the visitor was not precisely hers), and though she warmed a little after looking into Virginia's face, she could not by <b>any</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> phrase be called cordial.|$|R
