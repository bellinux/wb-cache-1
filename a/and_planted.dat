5|$|Under the Kingdom of Madagascar, {{plantations}} {{were established}} {{for the production of}} crops exported to foreign markets such as England and France. Cloves were imported <b>and</b> <b>planted</b> in 1803, and coconuts—which had been relatively sparse on the island—were cultivated on plantations for the production of oil. Similarly, coffee had been grown on family plots of four to five trees until the early 19thcentury, when more intensive cultivation for export began. Vanilla, later to become one of Madagascar's premiere export crops, was introduced by French entrepreneurs in 1840 <b>and</b> <b>planted</b> in eastern coastal rainforests. The technique of hand pollination, critical to higher vanilla yields, was introduced 30years later. Nonetheless, vanilla remained a marginal crop {{until the end of the}} monarchy.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of nitrogen <b>and</b> <b>plant</b> density on some morphological and agronomic characteristics of grain sorghum in the years 2001 - 2002. Experimental design was a split-split, randomized complete block with three replications. Three nitrogen levels (0, 75 and 150 kg ha - 1) <b>and</b> <b>plant</b> densities (70 x 10, 70 x 20 and 70 x 30 cm) were applied in three grain sorghum cultivars. Generally, nitrogen <b>and</b> <b>plant</b> density had no effect on <b>plant</b> height <b>and</b> stalk length. The effect of nitrogen on grain yield per plant was usually non-significant <b>and</b> increased <b>plant</b> densities tended to increase grain yield per <b>plant.</b> Both nitrogen <b>and</b> <b>plant</b> density have positively affected grain yield per unit area. The effects of cultivar, nitrogen level <b>and</b> <b>plant</b> density on flag leaf area were changeable and dependent on both years and locations. One thousand grain weight was mainly determined by both cultivar <b>and</b> <b>plant</b> density. It may be concluded that increased nitrogen <b>and</b> <b>plant</b> density levels generally give the best results in grain yield and yield components in sorghum...|$|R

The Australian National Botanic Gardens in Canberra has also had some success in cultivating the species. Seeds were sown in February 1996, <b>and</b> <b>planted</b> out in November 1997; seedlings planted into sections without good drainage died, but two seedlings that were planted into a section with excellent drainage were about a metre tall by 2002, and flowering prolifically.|$|E

5|$|I'itoi {{onion is}} a {{prolific}} multiplier onion cultivated in the Baboquivari Peak Wilderness, Arizona area.

40|$|Studies have {{indicated}} that consistent or well-constrained (relatively low variability) carbon:nitrogen:phosphorus (C:N:P) ratios exist in large-scale ecosystems, including both marine and terrestrial ecosystems. Little {{is known about the}} C, N and P stoichiometric ratios that exist in the soils <b>and</b> <b>plants</b> of Chenier Island in the Yellow River Delta (YRD). We examined the distribution patterns and relationships of C, N and P stoichiometry in the soils <b>and</b> <b>plants</b> of Chenier Island, as well as the potential influences of the island's micro-geomorphology. Based on a study of four soil profile categories and Phragmites australis <b>and</b> Suaeda heteroptera <b>plant</b> tissues, our results showed that micro-geomorphology could leave a distinct imprint on the soil <b>and</b> <b>plant</b> elemental stoichiometry of Chenier Island; significant variation in the atomic C:N:P ratios (RCNP) existed in soils <b>and</b> <b>plants,</b> indicating that the RCNP values in both the soil <b>and</b> <b>plants</b> are not well constrained at the Chenier Island scale. RCN and RCP in Chenier Island soils were high, whereas the RNP values were comparatively low, indicating that the ecosystems of Chenier Island are nutrient-limited by N and P. However, the RNP values in P. australis <b>and</b> S. heteroptera <b>plant</b> tissues were high, suggesting that the plants of Chenier Island are nutrient-limited by P. Finally, we suggest that soil <b>and</b> <b>plant</b> N:P ratios may be good indicators of the soil <b>and</b> <b>plant</b> nutrient status during soil development <b>and</b> <b>plant</b> growth, which could be a useful reference for restoring the degraded soils of Chenier Island...|$|R

5|$|Invasive plants include {{fountain}} grass, tamarisk, Malta starthistle, {{and many}} others, but {{by far the}} most severe threat to the native ecosystem is buffelgrass. This drought-tolerant plant, native to parts of Africa and Asia, was imported to the United States in the 1930s <b>and</b> <b>planted</b> near Tucson and elsewhere to create cattle forage and to control erosion. First detected in the park in 1989, it has dispersed widely in both districts. Competing with other plants for sustenance, buffelgrass fills the empty spaces normally found between native desert plants and creates a significant fire hazard. The noxious weed, considered impossible to completely eliminate, is managed in some areas of the park and in Tucson residential zones by hand-pulling and, during periods of wet weather, application of glyphosate-based herbicides.|$|E
