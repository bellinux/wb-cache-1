500|$|Kershaw's {{pitching}} style {{relies on}} deception, movement and changes of velocity. He keeps the ball hidden {{so that it}} is hard for the batter to pick up the ball and has a consistent overhand delivery on all of his pitches, he also consistently lands low on the strikezone below the catcher's knees, causing batters to chase the ball even when the ball is clearly going to hit the dirt. Out of the windup, Kershaw lowers his right foot vertically with a slight pause before moving it forward toward the plate. The motion was described during the 2015 National League Division Series as a [...] "kickstand move" [...] drawing comparison with one setting <b>a</b> <b>kickstand</b> on a bicycle. Out of the stretch, he uses a slide step as it makes it difficult for the base runner at first base to get a read on him. He has stated many times that he has modeled his pitching mechanics after his favorite pitcher growing up, Roger Clemens.|$|E

5000|$|The Surface and Surface Pro lines feature <b>a</b> <b>kickstand</b> which flips {{out from}} the back of the device to prop it up, {{allowing}} the device to be stood up at an angle hands-free. According to Microsoft, this is great for watching movies, video chatting, and typing documents. According to some reviewers, this kickstand is uncomfortable to use in one's lap and means the device won't fit on shallow desks. The first generation has <b>a</b> <b>kickstand</b> that can be set to a 22 degrees angle position. The second generation added a 55 degrees angle position which according to Microsoft makes the device more comfortable to type on the lap. The Surface 3 features three angle positions: 22, 44, and 60 degrees. The Surface Pro 3 is the first device to have a continuous kickstand that can be set at any angles between 22 and 150 degrees. With the fifth-generation Surface Pro, Microsoft added an additional 15 degrees of rotation to the hinge bringing the widest possible angle to 165 degrees, or what Microsoft calls [...] "Studio Mode".|$|E
50|$|The device {{consists}} of a tablet portion with a 13.5 in, 3000×2000 resolution display, and a keyboard attachment. That allows it to function similarly to a traditional laptop. Both components are constructed from machined magnesium. The Surface Book's keyboard utilizes a dynamic fulcrum hinge, which compresses when closed, and expands outwards when opened. The hinge design allows the tablet portion to be held up at an angle resembling a traditional laptop screen {{without the use of}} <b>a</b> <b>kickstand,</b> a supporting part found in Surface-series devices, and increases the physical room between the keyboard and the tablet.|$|E
50|$|On May 20, 2014, its successor, the Microsoft Surface Pro 3, was announced. It {{is bigger}} than its predecessor, with a 12-inch display, {{but at the same}} time is both thinner and lighter and comes with <b>an</b> improved, {{multi-stage}} <b>kickstand</b> which is held up by friction.|$|R
50|$|The IdeaPad Yoga Tablet is an Android tablet with a {{multi-mode}} {{device with}} <b>a</b> rear <b>kickstand</b> {{designed to allow}} it to be placed upright for viewing videos and other media or tilted for easier text entry. The Yoga Tablet has a round battery that can last as long as 18 hours. It comes in models with 10-inch and 8-inch screens. Internal storage varies from 16 gigabytes to 32 gigabytes.An upgraded version was added in February 2014, called Lenovo Yoga Tablet 10 HD+, which featured a Full HD display and a Qualcomm Snapdragon processor.|$|R
50|$|The Surface Pro 2 shares most of {{its design}} with its predecessor, the Surface Pro. The device's {{exterior}} is constructed from black magnesium alloy. The Surface Pro 2 weighs 915 grams (2.01 lb): the same as its predecessor. The Surface Pro 2 features a 10.6 inches (27 cm) display. The screen has a 16:9 aspect ratio, which is advantageous for video playback. Unlike its predecessor, the Surface Pro 2 has <b>a</b> two-stage <b>kickstand</b> that can be set to two different angles: 22 and 55 degrees. The new 55 degrees angle was added to make the device more comfortable on the lap. As with the previous Surface Pro, it includes 10.6-inch 10-point 1080p multi-touch digitizer LCD display with a Wacom stylus pen that supports 1024 different levels of pressure.|$|R

Features include a 30 GB HDD, a 4.3 inch, 16:9 aspect ratio widescreen WQVGA screen, a removable battery, <b>a</b> <b>kickstand,</b> {{and the ability to}} record video and audio from line-in sources (via the optional docking station or travel adapter), or the included microphone. It is thinner than the 504, and about the same thickness as the 404 and 404 camcorder. The screen is glossy unlike the 604 WiFi and the 404, which have semi-matte finishes. The 604 family uses the Texas Instruments DaVinci DM644x processor.|$|E
50|$|While not {{strictly}} <b>a</b> <b>kickstand,</b> the Flickstand {{is a small}} bracket that flips down from the down tube and engages the front tire to prevent the front end from steering and tire from rotating, and thus enabling the bike to be safely leaned against an object without danger of the front end turning and the bike subsequently falling to the ground. These were made by Rhode Gear Company in the 1970s and 1980s. While the Flickstand is no longer made, a Velcro strap can be employed for similar success by strapping a brake lever to lock the brake or strap the front wheel to the down tube.|$|E
50|$|The Surface 3 share {{a similar}} design to the Surface Pro 3 {{with a body}} made of {{magnesium}} alloy giving a matte gray finish {{to the back of}} the device. It features <b>a</b> <b>kickstand</b> that can be set to three different angles: 22, 44, and 60 degrees. The Surface 3 does not have a fan, therefore lacking the ventilation holes seen on Surface Pro line. The Surface 3 weighs 620 grams features a 10.8 in diagonal multi-touch display with a 3:2 aspect ratio. For a charger Surface 3 uses a standard Micro-USB, giving users a wider variety of charging options, including charging the device with a mobile phone charger.|$|E
50|$|Positioned as {{a direct}} {{competitor}} to Apple's iPad line, Surface included several notable features, including <b>a</b> folding <b>kickstand,</b> which allows the tablet to stand at some angles, {{and the ability to}} attach optional protective covers that incorporate keyboards. Surface served as the launch device for Windows RT, a variation of Windows 8 that was designed for devices based on ARM architecture. Windows RT contains notable differences and limitations compared to Windows 8, including several removed features, being bundled with a special edition of Microsoft Office 2013 Home & Student, and, besides software included with the operating system, being incompatible with desktop software that runs on Windows 8 for personal computers and tablets with Intel compatible processors. Windows RT can only run Metro-style apps obtained from Windows Store. However visually resembling Surface Pro 2-in-1 detachable, Surface is not considered a 2-in-1 PC, being in fact a variant of a hybrid tablet.|$|R
50|$|Utility {{bicycles}} often {{feature a}} step-through frame {{so they can}} be easily mounted, single speed, or with internal hub gearing, and drum brakes to reduce the need for maintenance, mudguards to keep the rider's clothing clean, a chain guard to prevent skirts or loose trousers from being caught in the chain, a skirt guard to prevent a long coat or skirt catching in the rear wheel or brakes, <b>a</b> center stand <b>kickstand</b> so it can be parked easily, and a basket or pannier rack to carry personal possessions or shopping bags.|$|R
40|$|A retrofittable, electronically-operated lock {{integrated}} into <b>a</b> bicycle <b>kickstand</b> {{was developed for}} the MIT Media Lab's Social Computing group {{as part of a}} peer-to-peer bike-share program currently in development. Connecting to the rear axle, the system consists of two modules, each constructed of many planar parts cut on the waterjet from aluminum. The first of these is a lock, which uses a servo-driven double rack and pinion that locks into keyways within the ring of the rho-shaped kickstand. The second is a mechanical retainer mechanism that uses a latching spring-loaded bar actuated by the user's foot via a pushbutton to retain the kickstand in the upright position while riding. With the alpha prototype complete, Social Computing can now begin system-wide testing of their program while easily iterating on the modular lock design to resolve any issues that arise. by Jacob A.

5000|$|The Moto Z {{features}} an accessory system known as [...] "Moto Mods". Mods are case-like accessories that {{are attached to}} the rear of the Moto Z via a series of magnets. Using the pogo pin connectors, Mods can communicate with the device to provide additional functionality. Mods are hot swappable, and are automatically detected by the operating system software once installed. During the launch event, Lenovo unveiled several mods to be available on launch, including battery packs, the [...] "SoundBoost" [...] (which features a JBL speaker and <b>a</b> <b>kickstand),</b> and a pico projector ("Insta-Share").

5000|$|The Yamaha WR250F is an {{off-road}} motorcycle made by Yamaha Motor Company. It has a [...] liquid-cooled single nikasil coated cylinder engine. First {{offered in}} 2001, it shared many components and design concepts with the YZ250F motocross model. It {{is basically the}} YZ250F detuned slightly for more controllable power, with a headlight and lighting coil, softer suspension, <b>a</b> <b>kickstand,</b> lower noise specifications, larger radiators, and lower emissions. [...] The WR in the name indicates a wide-ratio gear box common to most enduro or trail bikes and stands {{in contrast to the}} close-ratio gearbox essential to a motocross racer. Over the years the WR250F has benefited from the advances made in the YZ motocross version gaining advancements such as an aluminum frame and improved suspension.|$|E
50|$|There is no general {{agreement}} on how much, or even what {{use to make}} of the third wheel on a tilter. Sometimes it does little more than <b>a</b> <b>kickstand</b> with a caster, employed at low speed. These are called free-leaners and they must be balanced through countersteering before turning, just as on a motorcycle or other single-track vehicle. For comfort, the free-leaners are the best for cyclists, as the legs don't get thrown to the side when you hit a bump on one side, and no muscles are used for side support of the torso. Most motorcycles using this technology are scooters. According to the manufacturers' marketing these three-wheelers are more stable, have a better weight distribution and handle poor road surfaces better compared to a standard two-wheeler scooter.|$|E

50|$|In 2015, Ben Serotta helped {{redesign}} {{the bicycle}} {{to include a}} new seat, a simpler gear shifting mechanism, fewer and brighter lights, and <b>a</b> European-style center <b>kickstand.</b> All of Citi Bike's bicycles were renovated to include this new design. However, in 2016, a thousand of the newly redesigned Citi Bikes were taken out of service due to {{a part in the}} front wheel degrading faster than expected. In early 2017, as part of a pilot program with a firm named Blaze, 250 bikes received anterior laser lights that project a teal silhouette on the ground to warn drivers and pedestrians in their path.|$|R
40|$|Geckos are nature's elite climbers. Their {{remarkable}} climbing feats {{have been}} attributed to specialized feet with hairy toes that uncurl and peel in milliseconds. Here, we report that the secret to the gecko's arboreal acrobatics includes an active tail. We examine the tail's role during rapid climbing, aerial descent, and gliding. We show that a gecko's tail functions as an emergency fifth leg to prevent falling during rapid climbing. A response initiated by slipping causes the tail tip to push against the vertical surface, thereby preventing pitch-back of the head and upper body. When pitch-back cannot be prevented, geckos avoid falling by placing their tail in a posture similar to <b>a</b> bicycle's <b>kickstand.</b> Should <b>a</b> gecko fall with its back to the ground, a swing of its tail induces the most rapid, zero-angular momentum air-righting response yet measured. Once righted to a sprawled gliding posture, circular tail movements control yaw and pitch as the gecko descends. Our results suggest that large, active tails can function as effective control appendages. These results have provided biological inspiration for the design of an active tail on a climbing robot, and we anticipate their use in small, unmanned gliding vehicles and multisegment spacecraft...|$|R
