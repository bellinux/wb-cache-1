40|$|Purpose of review: Amniotic fluid {{embolism}} {{is a rare}} catastrophe {{unique to}} pregnancy. Its mortality rate remains high despite efforts <b>at</b> <b>prompt</b> and aggressive management protocols, highlighting {{the need to maintain}} a high index of suspicion. Recent findings: The intrusion of amniotic fluid into the maternal bloodstream may lead in certain women to a complex series of physiological reactions mimicking those seen in human anaphylaxis or sepsis, negating the purely embolic phenomenon theory as previously understood. The clinical picture is the sudden onset of cardiovascular collapse, cyanosis, haemorrhage or disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, during or soon after delivery. Summary: The mainstay of a successful outcome remains the identification of high-risk patients, as well as early clinical diagnosis and management. PublishedN/...|$|E

Bursts are generally the natural evolution of background leakages, driven by external factors that entail major water outflows, generating changes of WDN hydraulic functioning, detectable as anomalies in monitored flow/pressure data. Active leakage control strategies aim <b>at</b> <b>prompt</b> detection, localization and repair of pipe burst, thus reducing possible damages to private/public properties, minimize unplanned works, and reduce volume of lost water.

30|$|The early {{prediction}} of severity becomes {{a critical issue}} {{in the management of}} AP. When the prediction is accurate, it allows for proper patient stratification with clinical management implications: Patients predicted at risk of developing severe AP will get enhanced hemodynamic support and close monitoring aimed <b>at</b> <b>prompt</b> recognition of local or systemic complications that may require specific treatment. Unfortunately, our ability to identify with high accuracy those severe cases early {{in the course of the}} disease is still unsatisfactory. The current {{prediction of}} severity is mainly based on multifactorial scores (Ranson, Imrie, APACHE-II, BISAP, etc.) [4, 5]. However, some of them are cumbersome to calculate (APACHE-II, Ranson, Imrie) and, most importantly, these scoring systems have a limited accuracy for mortality or persistent organ failure (>  48  h) [5 – 8]. In addition, some reports indicate that these scoring systems are not superior to easier-to-determine biomarkers, such as blood urea nitrogen, C-reactive protein (CRP), hematocrit or creatinine [6]. In this scenario, a blood biomarker with improved accuracy in predicting severe AP (as compared to previously described predictors) would be a step forward toward better early management of patients with severe AP.|$|E
40|$|Modern {{academic}} {{education in}} economics, and especially {{that in the}} field of business, frequently tries, and rather seldom manages to combine, interfere and unify, to varying degrees, distinct disciplines with practical interests usually similar or even seemingly adverse; its concrete action {{is an example of the}} successful attempt <b>at</b> <b>prompt</b> adaptation to the entrepreneurial reality, which is constantly changing, and also to the more and more dynamic economic environment, perhaps excessively so in the last two decades. This paper attempts to clarify the conceptual differences and the relatively common parts of inter-, trans-, cross- and multidisciplinarity in general, and in particular in education, focusing on business education. A brief introduction structures the inter-, trans-, cross- and multidisciplinary investigative approach within an educational context in business, and a review of the scientific literature section clarifies both the meaning of those major concepts, extending from simple paradigm of each concept to their multiple aggregative paradigm, and some modern educational trends in economics. A second section is devoted to the method of investigating opinions, based on the volume of a sample determined statistically and from a scientific methodology of observation and recording, by collecting individual data, validating the rigor of research on the diversity in business education approaches, by simply and consistently noting them by the students and graduates of faculties of economics. The study of the graduates 2 ̆ 019 opinions focused on an original questionnaire, presented in the a annexes of the paper, and the resulting databases were subjected to a descriptive statistical analysis, made with the software package Eviews, with emphasis on the homogeneity, symmetry, skewness and normality of distributions. The third section is a brief analysis of the research results, supplemented naturally by some clarifying discussions, which outline the current option of the graduates towards early multidisciplinarity as a necessary goal resulting from the content analysis of opinions. The conclusions briefly describe the expected trends of inter-, trans-, cross- and multidisciplinary education in economics, relating to business, approached as any job well done, from several scientific viewpoints...|$|E
