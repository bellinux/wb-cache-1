5|$|Behaviorally, domesticated pet rats are tamer {{than those}} in the wild. They <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> around humans and known to seek out their owners while roaming freely. They have {{decreased}} reactions to light and sound, are less cautious of new food, and have better tolerance to overcrowding. Domesticated rats are shown to mate earlier, more readily, and {{for a longer period of}} time over their lifespan. Also, domesticated rats exhibit different behaviors when fighting with each other; while wild rats almost always flee a lost battle, caged rats spend protracted amounts of time in a belly-up or boxing position. These behavioral traits are thought to be products of environment as opposed to genetics. However, it is also theorized that there are certain underlying biological reasons for why some members of a wild species are more receptive to domestication than others, and that these differences are then passed down to offspring (compare Domesticated silver fox).|$|E
25|$|Social {{comparison}} {{means that}} individuals <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> interacting {{with others who}} share common characteristics with themselves, such as a psychiatric illness, {{in order to establish}} a sense of normalcy. By interacting with others who are perceived to be better than them, peers are given a sense of optimism and something to strive toward.|$|E
25|$|All Japanese {{who have}} {{attended}} elementary school since World War II {{have been taught}} {{to read and write}} romanized Japanese. Therefore, almost all Japanese are able to read and write Japanese using rōmaji, although it is extremely rare in Japan to use this method to write Japanese (except as an input tool on a computer or for special purposes like in some logo design), and most Japanese <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> reading kanji/kana.|$|E

25|$|Even among Welsh {{speakers}}, {{very few}} people speak only Welsh, with nearly all being bilingual in English. However, {{a large number of}} Welsh speakers <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> expressing themselves in Welsh than in English. Some prefer to speak English in South Wales or the urbanised areas and Welsh in the North or in rural areas. A speaker's choice of language can vary according to the subject domain (known in linguistics as code-switching).|$|E
25|$|The riding {{position}} {{places the}} feet forward and the hands are up relatively high, {{so that the}} spine is erect or leaning back slightly. At low to moderate speeds, cruisers <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> than other styles, but riding for long periods at freeway speeds can lead to fatigue from pulling back on the handlebars to resist {{the force of the}} wind against the rider's chest. Cruisers have limited cornering ability {{due to a lack of}} ground clearance.|$|E
25|$|The {{technically}} more advanced, stationary vertical looms {{are used}} in villages and town manufactures. The more advanced types of vertical looms <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable,</b> as they allow for the weavers to retain their position throughout the entire weaving process. The Tabriz type of vertical loom allows for weaving of carpets up to double {{the length of the}} loom, while there is no limit to the length of the carpet that can be woven on a vertical roller beam loom. In essence, the width of the carpet is limited by the length of the loom beams.|$|E

25|$|Wetsuits {{are limited}} {{in their ability to}} {{preserve}} warmth by three factors: the wearer is still exposed to some water, the suit is compressed by the ambient pressure, reducing effectiveness at depth, and the insulating neoprene can only be made to a certain thickness before it becomes impractical to don and wear. The thickest commercially available wetsuits are usually 10mm thick. Other common thicknesses are 7mm, 5mm, 3mm, and 1mm. A 1mm suit provides very little warmth and is usually considered a dive skin, rather than a wetsuit. Wetsuits can be made using more than one thickness of neoprene, to put the most thickness where it will be most effective in keeping the diver warm. A similar effect can be achieved by layering wetsuits of different coverage. Some makes of neoprene are softer, lighter and more compressible than others for the same thickness, and are more suitable for wetsuits for non-diving purposes as they will compress and lose their insulating value more quickly under pressure, though they <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> for surface sports because they are more flexible and allow more freedom of movement.|$|E
500|$|Romano and Glazer {{compared}} Silent Alarm to U2's early work, while Walters {{claimed that}} it distills [...] "twenty-five years of spiky British rock, from The Cure to Blur to hot Scots Franz Ferdinand". Pitchfork Media's Nitsuh Adebe noted particular similarities between [...] "Banquet" [...] and Franz Ferdinand's second single [...] "Take Me Out", calling both songs [...] "wonderfully tight and energetic—the {{same kind of}} spiffy half-dancing rock". Phares suggested that Bloc Party <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> with lyrical proclamations than their contemporaries Franz Ferdinand or The Futureheads, while Imran Ahmed of NME concluded, [...] "Silent Alarm is no Franz Ferdinand. In fact, listen to it with the words 'popular' and 'arty' in mind and its spirit {{is closer to the}} Manic Street Preachers' The Holy Bible." ...|$|E
500|$|Yaoi {{has been}} criticised for stereotypical and {{homophobic}} portrayals of its characters, and {{for failing to}} address gay issues. Homophobia, when it is presented as an issue at all, is often used as a plot device to [...] "heighten the drama", or to show {{the purity of the}} leads’ love. Matt Thorn has suggested that as yaoi is a romance narrative, strong political themes may be a [...] "turn off" [...] to the readers. Critics state that the genre challenges heteronormativity via the [...] "queer" [...] bishōnen ("beautiful boys"), and Andrew Grossman has written that the Japanese <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> with writing about LGBT themes in a manga setting, in which gender is often blurred, even in [...] "straight" [...] manga.|$|E

500|$|The Northern Stand {{holds the}} most season ticket-holders. It is a single-tier {{terracing}} section, with railing in various places across the stand for security and comfort. It can {{hold up to}} 100 wheelchair users and their companions in a dedicated section. The stand also houses conference facilities with views of the pitch, {{as well as the}} 2,000-capacity [...] "Restaurang 1910" [...] in the inside area, behind the terraced area of the stand, and a health club run by Friskis & Svettis. Malmö FF's official souvenir shop is {{on the outside of the}} stand, alongside an O'Learys sports bar, which holds up to 250 guests. The Eastern and Western Stands house 54 VIP boxes between them, which is more than any other football stadium in Sweden. Including all sports, is the second most after the multi-purpose indoor arena Malmö Arena, which has 72 boxes. The Eastern and Western Stands [...] also have 2,000 club seats along their upper tiers. These seats <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> than the regular seats, and come with half-time meals and snacks in [...] "Restaurang 1910". The Western Stand includes seating for the press, as well as a large press room inside the stand. The president's box, which holds up to 60 people, is also in the Western Stand.|$|E
500|$|The Type 94 pistol is {{operated}} by a different mechanism than previous Japanese sidearms. Unlike previously designed Nambu pistols, the Type 94 operates with a concealed hammer and with a firing pin rather than a hammer. According to authors, Harry L. Derby and James [...] D. Brown, the firing pin is inherently weak and is prone to breakage because of a recess cut provided for the crossbolt and is prone to breaking at this point. The sturdier hammer firing mechanism was developed and included in the Type 94 to replace the poor striker on the Type 14 Nambu. The locking system is a rising-block type which floats independently between the lugs underneath the chamber end of the barrel. The single coil mainspring is positioned around the barrel instead of {{to the rear of}} the barrel as found on other Nambu pistols. [...] The grip is smaller than other Japanese pistols and is finished with smooth wood but according to author Jeff Kinard, <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> for use by men with smaller hands. The magazine holds a maximum of six rounds because of the smaller grip and it is considered difficult to reload the weapon, with pressure from the bolt holding it inside the pistol. The magazine catch protrudes far enough to occasionally disengage when the [...] pistol is placed on its left side on a hard surface. The magazine could also disengage if squeezed into or jarred in a holster. The manual safety lever is located on the left rear of the frame and has the kanji for fire and safe stamped onto the frame. The front blade sight on the muzzle of the Type 94 pistol and the rear fixed V were occasionally inaccurately positioned making them useless when the weapon is being aimed. The rear sight was reduced from a U-shape to a simple notch in 1944 with the front blade being left unchanged but less attention to detail being applied as World War II progressed.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{treeless}} saddle designs {{may present}} problems for riders as well. [...] Without a supportive tree over the horse's withers, a treeless saddle may place the rider behind {{the movement of}} the horse, creating pressure on the horse's loin and the rider's low back. Inadequate support may also lead to the rider's seat bones digging into the horse's back. [...] Additionally, a solid tree supports the curvature of the rider's spine which is essential for communication between horse and rider. [...] On the other hand, many riders with preexisting back or hip problems <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> in a treeless saddle due to the extra padding, adjustability and shock absorption. [...] Treeless saddles have started to become popular in horse therapy and hippotherapy for this reason.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the past}} years, American Express has become {{increasingly}} involved in New York City Fashion Week, and in 2010 American Express sponsored Evolving Influence, the first international bloggers conference in New York City.

After Fashion Week, it was found that 6.37% of all articles written about [...] or related to Fashion Week had mentioned the Evolving Influence main sponsor, American Express. These blogs were not directly paid to mention American Express, so they served as a free source of advertisement for American Express.|$|E
2500|$|Jasper Sharp {{also gives}} the film a {{negative}} appraisal, {{calling it the}} poorest of Hasebe's films that he discusses in his Behind the Pink Curtain: The Complete History of Japanese Sex Cinema. He dismisses the film as a [...] "preposterous red-blooded macho fantasy" [...] which {{is little more than}} a series of attacks on women, and writes, that the final scene in which the two rapists are attacked by the vigilante gang, [...] "almost seems like an apology for the onscreen outrages committed in the name of entertainment". Sharp describes the film as a kind of [...] "buddy movie" [...] made for men who claim to be attracted by women, but <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> with other men. According to Sharp, the film trivializes the psychological effects of violence on women to a ludicrous degree, showing the victims enjoying the attacks to the point where one actually gives her attacker money, and asks him to return. 10kbullets.com also judges this aspect of the film—in which the victims come to enjoy their assaults—to be quite disturbing. Set pieces which stand out, according to Sharp include car chases, fistfights, and the ballerina's rape, set to the music of Swan Lake, with pillow feathers flying around the nude woman as if they were snowflakes.|$|E

2500|$|The band {{expected}} a less personal {{treatment for the}} film and were at times uncomfortable with {{the extent to which}} Guggenheim probed into their history. Responding to the band's concerns, Guggenheim said, [...] "I tell the story that's in front of me, warts and all. In the rock 'n' roll business, it's about adding layers. My process strips layers away. Rock stars <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>comfortable</b> creating an aura and mystique." [...] Despite U2's discomfort, they allowed Guggenheim to have creative control over the film. He remarked, [...] "They said from the beginning, we want you to make the movie that you want to make and they let me make the movie I wanted to make. It was pretty astounding. I think part of it is the trust we gained doing It Might Get Loud, they sort of let me have a free hand." [...] Bono said that it was the least involved the band had ever been in a U2 project. Additional filming took place on 27 May at Burton Cummings Theatre in Winnipeg during the band's rehearsals for the Glastonbury Festival 2011. A rough cut of the movie was shown to the group in July, much to their satisfaction. According to Guggenheim, [...] "They were over the moon. They loved it." [...] The only request the band made was that the film should be shortened in length, and Guggenheim agreed.|$|E
