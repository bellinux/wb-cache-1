40|$|The {{growing number}} of vehicle in each year {{resulting}} an inevitable congestion, {{one of them is}} jamming vehicle transaction in Tembalang toll gate. This condition can cause dissatisfaction to the toll road users in obtaining services. If the booth service that operates is just a little can causes a longer waiting time to get service, but if there are more booth services that can be operated, it can cut the waiting time. It is need to be specified the appropriate queue system model to the conditions of service in Tembalang toll gate. So it can be determined the number of booth service is working optimally. Based on the data analysis obtained from the Arena software, the queue system model that can describe the conditions of service at Tembalang toll gates with data total- time, time-total, and time-time the direction of Srondol-Jatingaleh at the regular toll booth is (Norm/G/ 2) :(GD/∞/∞), (G/Norm/ 2) : (GD/∞/∞), (G/G/ 2) : (GD/∞/∞) and at the <b>automatic</b> <b>toll</b> booth is (G/Tria/ 3) : (GD/∞/∞), (Tria/G/ 3) : (GD/∞/∞), (G/G/ 3) : (GD/∞/∞) while with the direction of Jatingaleh-Srondol at the regular toll booth is (Norm/G/ 3) : (GD/∞/∞), (G/Norm/ 3) : (GD/∞/∞), (G/G/ 3) : (GD/∞/∞) and (G/Tria/ 2) : (GD/∞/∞), (Tria/G/ 2) : (GD/∞/∞), (G/G/ 2) : (GD/∞/∞) at <b>automatic</b> <b>toll</b> booth.

A radio antenna detects when a vehicle with a transponder has entered and exited the highway, calculating the toll rate. For vehicles without a transponder, an automatic number plate recognition system is used. In both cases, monthly statements are mailed to users. The automatic number plate recognition system is linked to several provincial and U.S. state motor vehicle registries.|$|R

In this paper, a sliding window approach based on Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features {{is used for}} Brazilian license plate detection. This approach consists in scanning the whole image in a multiscale fashion such that the license plate is located precisely. The main contribution of this work consists in a deep study of the best setup for HOG descriptors on the detection of Brazilian license plates, in which HOG have never been applied before.

Indeed, all radio communications depend upon error transmission rate, particularly for exchanged security messages. As a result, transmission errors can degrade the reliability and the stability of some security solutions. This paper first discusses some existing security proposals for RFID systems; then, it focuses on the influence of transmission errors on these security proposals. Finally, we suggest a novel cross-layer architecture designed to improve the reliability of security and privacy solutions. Key words...|$|R

50|$|As {{early as}} 1989, the tollway {{authority}} had discussed implementing <b>automatic</b> <b>toll</b> collection {{across the entire}} system to relieve congestion caused by traffic stopping at mainline toll barriers. The tollway authority began testing I-Pass, the tollway system's electronic payment method, on the entire stretch of I-355 in 1993 at various tollbooths; by September 1994, every plaza on I-355 accepted I-Pass. By 1998, the tollway authority had installed dedicated I-Pass lanes (lanes specifically set aside for electronic toll collections) at both mainline toll barriers. In 1999, I-355 became the first tollway to receive I-Pass Express Lanes (also known as open road tolling, or ORT). With {{the installation of the}} express lanes, vehicles with I-Pass could be tolled at highway speeds of 55 mph. In 2005, the tollway authority widened the express lanes from two lanes to three lanes in each direction. This allowed the number of express lanes to match the number of travel lanes on the tollway.|$|R
