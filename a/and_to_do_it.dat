After asking many professors in the astronomy department whether they enjoyed their work and whether they made a satisfactory wage, and being content with their answers, he transferred to the College of Letters and Science to major in astronomy. [...] This did not set him back in his degree requirements because almost all of his first year studies had been in basic physical sciences and mathematics. [...] Eventually Mayall discovered that he greatly enjoyed astronomy, and decided upon a course of graduate level study followed by a career as a research scientist.|$|E

2500|$|Here he, {{like many}} other writers, notes the {{elements}} of musical form (then often described as [...] "closed forms") which characterize the opera and make it appear {{to be something of}} a return to the language of earlier times, [...] "the veritable apotheosis of bel canto with its demands for vocal beauty, agility and range," [...] notes Charles Osborne. Thus, the cantabile-cabaletta two-part arias, the use of the chorus, etc., which Verdi had originally asked Cammarano to ignore, are evident. But Verdi wanted something else: [...] "the freer the forms he presents me with, the better I shall do," [...] he wrote to the librettist's friend in March 1851. It was not what he received from his librettist, but he certainly demonstrated his total mastery over this style. Osborne's take on Il trovatore is that [...] "it is as though Verdi had decided to do something which he had been perfecting over the years, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> so beautifully that he need never to do it again. Formally, it is a step backward after Rigoletto".|$|E

A searcher, whose maximal velocity is one, starts from the origin and wishes to discover the hider in minimal expected time. It is assumed that the searcher can change the direction of his motion without any loss of time. It is also assumed that the searcher cannot see the hider until he actually reaches {{the point at which the}} hider is located and the time elapsed until this moment is the duration of the game."

2500|$|The other {{series that}} Moore began for Taboo was Lost Girls, which he {{described}} {{as a work of}} intelligent [...] "pornography". Illustrated by Melinda Gebbie, with whom Moore subsequently entered into a relationship, it was set in 1913, where Alice from Alice in Wonderland, Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz and Wendy from Peter Pan – who are each of a different age and class – all meet in a European hotel and regale each other with tales of their sexual encounters. With the work, Moore wanted to attempt something innovative in comics, and believed that creating comics pornography was a way of achieving this. He remarked that [...] "I had a lot of different ideas as to how {{it might be possible to}} do an up-front sexual comic strip <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> in a way that would remove a lot of what I saw were the problems with pornography in general. That it's mostly ugly, it's mostly boring, it's not inventive – it has no standards." [...] Like From Hell, Lost Girls outlasted Taboo, and a few subsequent instalments were published erratically until the work was finished and a complete edition published in 2006.|$|E
