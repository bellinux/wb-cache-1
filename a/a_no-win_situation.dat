25|$|As the Philippines {{among other}} {{countries}} who train and export labor repeatedly has faced failures in protecting labor rights the deskilling of labor has increased {{on a global}} scale. A strong worldwide demand for healthcare workers causes many Filipinos to emigrate without ever getting hired or become deskilling while possibly raising their salary. The result is <b>a</b> <b>no-win</b> <b>situation</b> for the sending and receiving country. The receiving countries lose as skilled workers are not fully utilizing their skills while the home country simultaneously experience a shortage of workers in emigrating prone sectors.|$|E
25|$|The Hatsuharu-class destroyers were {{designed}} to accompany the Japanese main striking force and to conduct both day and night torpedo attacks against the United States Navy as it advanced across the Pacific Ocean, according to Japan's naval strategic projections. They were to be armed much as the Fubuki class despite displacing only 1400 tons compared to the 1700 tons of the earlier destroyers. Furthermore, their fire control systems were to be more modern than the older systems and suitable for anti-aircraft use. This required the gun turrets to be modified for high-angle fire, which also meant more powerful motors to traverse and elevate the guns more quickly to engage high-speed aircraft. The torpedo launchers were {{to be given a}} protective shield to allow for use in heavy weather and to protect against splinter damage. And the Hatsuharu vessels were to be fitted with modern, enclosed command spaces protected against strafing aircraft. These requirements could only be met by adding weight high up on the ship and increased the ship's center of gravity. The only way to adhere to the allotted displacement was to try to reduce the weight of the hull and other equipment below the waterline as much as possible. But this put the ship's designers in <b>a</b> <b>no-win</b> <b>situation</b> as any reduction of weight below the waterline further raised the ship's center of gravity and reduced her stability.|$|E

50|$|An {{explosive}} situation erupts when a mob war thrusts a yakuza, an ex-cop, and his adolescent daughter into <b>a</b> deadly, <b>no-win</b> <b>situation.</b> Booted {{in disgrace}} from the L.A. police force Bob Malone suffers {{a seemingly endless}} unlucky streak. Matters don't improve when a robbery led by a crazed criminal transpires at the bank where Malone is filling out foreclosure papers. Witnessing the crime, something inside Malone snaps and he single-handedly wipes {{out most of the}} robber gang. Unfortunately, the ringleader escapes and Malone ends up jailed by his corrupt former colleague Lt. Tony Dussecq. At the same time, two Japanese yakuza arrive in L.A. to deliver a special message to L.A.'s most prominent Mafia don. The yakuza are in a restaurant when the bank robber (wearing a vest covered with explosives) bursts in and threatens to blow the place up. One of the Japanese, Koji, intervenes in an explosive sequence. He too ends up at the police station just as Malone's feisty teen daughter Chelsea arrives with bail money. The yakuza suddenly escapes, taking Chelsea and Malone with him as hostages. Now pursued by the crooked coppers and the mob, the unlikely threesome {{have no choice but to}} team up to survive.|$|R

500|$|Grim Fandango is an {{adventure}} game, {{in which the}} player controls Manuel [...] "Manny" [...] Calavera (calavera being Spanish for 'skull') as he follows Mercedes [...] "Meche" [...] Colomar in the Underworld. The game uses the GrimE engine, pre-rendering static backgrounds from 3D models, while the main objects and characters are animated in 3D. The player controls Manny's movements and actions with a keyboard, a joystick, or a gamepad. Manny must collect objects {{that can be used}} with either other collectible objects, parts of the scenery, or with other people in the Land of the Dead in order to solve puzzles and progress in the game. The game lacks any type of HUD. Unlike the earlier 2D LucasArts games, the player is informed of objects or persons of interest not by text floating on the screen when the player passes a cursor over them, but instead by the fact that Manny will turn his head towards that object or person as he walks by. The player reviews the inventory of items that Manny has collected by watching him pull each item {{in and out of his}} coat jacket. Manny can engage in dialogue with other characters through conversation trees to gain hints of what needs to be done to solve the puzzles or to progress the plot. As in most LucasArts adventure games, the player can never die or otherwise get into <b>a</b> <b>no-win</b> <b>situation</b> (that prevents completion of the game).|$|E

500|$|Burrell's {{study found}} women {{consistently}} rating Clinton more favorably than men by about ten percentage points {{during her first}} lady years. Jacobson's study found a positive correlation across all senators between being women and receiving a partisan-polarized response. Colorado State University communication studies professor Karrin Vasby Anderson describes the first lady position as a [...] "site" [...] for American womanhood, one ready made for the symbolic negotiation of female identity. In particular anderson states {{there has been a}} cultural bias towards traditional first ladies and a cultural prohibition against modern first ladies; by the time of Clinton, the first lady position had become a site of heterogeneity and paradox. Burrell, as well as biographers Jeff Gerth and Don Van Natta Jr., note that Clinton achieved her highest approval ratings as first lady late in 1998, not for professional or political achievements of her own, but for being seen as the victim of her husband's very public infidelity. University of Pennsylvania communications professor Kathleen Hall Jamieson saw Clinton as an exemplar of the double bind, who though able to live in a [...] "both-and" [...] world of both career and family, nevertheless [...] "became a surrogate on whom we projected our attitudes about attributes once thought incompatible", leading to her being placed in <b>a</b> variety of <b>no-win</b> <b>situations.</b> Quinnipiac University media studies professor Lisa Burns found press accounts frequently framing Clinton both as an exemplar of the modern professional working mother and as a political interloper interested in usurping power for herself. University of Indianapolis English professor Charlotte Templin found political cartoonists using a variety of stereotypes—such as gender reversal, radical feminist as emasculator and the wife the husband wants to get rid of—to portray Clinton as violating gender norms.|$|R

Although feral burros are an invader species introduced onto the North American Continent by 16 th Century Spanish explorers, they have both State and Federal protection. Under {{the umbrella of}} this protection, feral burro populations exploded in the 1970 s. By 1979 the Naval Weapons Center, China Lake, California, was being overrun by burros. Burros were destroying the desert environment and creating very real hazards to aircraft, vehicles and personnel. The Naval Weapons Center in an unprecedented move implemented an interim emergency removal program. A total of 1513 burros was removed under this program: 864 by live removal and 649 by direct reduction (shooting). Adverse national publicity followed the shooting phase of the emergency removal. Congress had determined in 1971 that wild burros were to be considered {{an integral part of}} the natural system of public lands. Had the Navy directly violated this statute?

50|$|The {{double bind}} is often {{misunderstood}} to {{be a simple}} contradictory situation, where the subject is trapped by two conflicting demands. While it's true that {{the core of the}} double bind is two conflicting demands, the difference lies in how they are imposed upon the subject, what the subject's understanding of the situation is, and who (or what) imposes these demands upon the subject. Unlike the usual <b>no-win</b> <b>situation,</b> the subject has difficulty in defining the exact nature of the paradoxical situation in which they are caught. The contradiction may be unexpressed in its immediate context and therefore invisible to external observers, only becoming evident when a prior communication is considered. Typically, a demand is imposed upon the subject by someone who they respect (such as a parent, teacher or doctor) but the demand itself is inherently impossible to fulfill because some broader context forbids it. For example, this situation arises when a person in a position of authority imposes two contradictory conditions but there exists an unspoken rule that one must never question authority.|$|R
