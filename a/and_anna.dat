5|$|Owen's {{argument}} that the Federal Reserve's deflationary stance was largely responsible for causing the Great Depression {{would have been considered}} unorthodox at the time he made it.

5|$|With her doctor's approval, Leigh {{was well}} enough to resume acting in 1946, {{starring}} in a successful London production of Thornton Wilder's The Skin of Our Teeth; but her films of this period, Caesar and Cleopatra (1945) <b>and</b> <b>Anna</b> Karenina (1948), were not great commercial successes.

5|$|Beauchamp was {{admitted}} to the bar in April 1823. He <b>and</b> <b>Anna</b> Cooke married in June 1824. Still determined to defend the honor of his wife, Beauchamp devised a ruse to lure Sharp to Bowling Green. He wrote letters to Sharp under various pseudonyms, each asking for his help in some sort of legal matter, and each sent from a different post office. When Sharp failed to respond, Beauchamp decided to go to Frankfort again and confront him.|$|E
5|$|Beauchamp {{was convicted}} of the murder and sentenced to hang. The morning of the execution, {{he and his wife}} {{attempted}} a double suicide by stabbing themselves with a knife she had smuggled into prison. She was successful; he was not. Beauchamp was rushed to the gallows before he could bleed to death, and was hanged on July 7, 1826. The bodies of Jereboam <b>and</b> <b>Anna</b> Beauchamp were arranged in an embrace and buried in a single coffin, as they had requested. The Beauchamp–Sharp Tragedy inspired fictional works such as Edgar Allan Poe's unfinished play, Politian, and Robert Penn Warren's World Enough and Time (1950).|$|E
