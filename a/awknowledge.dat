Betty refuses to <b>awknowledge</b> Gio as a boyfriend and shrugs off his claim. At the same time she sees her first article in Hot Flash, but is upset that Claire would alter her story, in which Claire told Betty that she needs to go beyond the [...] "safe" [...] approach. During lunch, Gio tricks Betty into practicing. Gio makes Betty an incredibly romantic offer, which is a trip to Rome, of which Betty accepts. But at home, Ignacio is against the idea of her going to Italy. Ironically, out of nowhere, Henry pops back into her life with a proposal of his own; a wedding proposal and an offer to go to Tucson to work at a magazine. The confusion also had Ignacio upset over both offers and was against it. However, later that evening Ignacio showed up at Mode to show Betty a series of family photos, then told her that she should make her own decisions by looking inside her own heart.|$|E

[...] In Sartre, Beauvoir, and the Race/Gender Analogy: A Case for Black Feminist Philosophy (a piece Gines contributed to Convergences: Black Feminism and Continental Philosophy), Gines argues that the absence of black feminist thought from continental philosophy has resulted in a significant void that has prevented continental analysis from coming to grips with how systems of oppression intersect and shape phenomenology.|$|R

The geographical, social, economical and psychological displacement and their implications in the formation of a woman’s identity shaped by personal history. The roles of language, uniting or dividing, as means to communicate as well as oppress, and the logos of objects conscious and subconscious as represented in the artwork and as met in world around us. The presence of objects, their relation to their visual representation and the viewer. The role of memory in the functions of the body and the mind, and the use of memory as a possible tool to instill empathy.
