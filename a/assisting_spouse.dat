40|$|This paper {{studies the}} new Directive on equal {{treatment}} in self-employment, adopted under the 2010 Spanish Presidency of the EU, paying {{special attention to}} the social security provisions. Firstly, the application of the principle of equal treatment in matters of social security at the Community level is reviewed, which is based on the so-called three pension pillars: statutory pensions, occupational pensions and private pensions. Then, the old 1986 Directive is analysed, which was a timid step forward with regards to equal treatment in self-employment given that some of its provisions are just recommendations. In relation to its social security provisions, it establishes that Member States shall establish a voluntary social security scheme for <b>assisting</b> <b>spouses</b> of selfemployed workers, provided that two conditions are met: there is a social security scheme for self-employed workers and the <b>assisting</b> <b>spouses</b> are not protected under the selfemployed worker's social security scheme. Maternity protection of self-employed women and female <b>assisting</b> <b>spouses</b> is just a recommendation. Lastly, the 2010 Directive is studied, which has been a significant progress, in particular with regards to social security issues. The Directive establishes that Member States shall establish a social security scheme for <b>spouses</b> and <b>assisting</b> life partners, which can be voluntary or mandatory, when there is a social security scheme for self-employed workers. By eliminating the second condition, the social protection of <b>assisting</b> <b>spouses</b> is at last acknowledged as a fully-fledged right, and not just as a secondary right. In addition, a maternity benefit of 14 weeks is established at an European level for the first time for female self-employed workers and female <b>spouses</b> and <b>assisting</b> life partners. Despite the huge social impact of the new Directive at Community level, it will not affect the Spanish legal system because its novelties are already included in it. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Family members play an {{important}} role in the physical and mental recovery of soldiers returning from Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF). Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been associated with strained marital and family relations and parenting difficulties, and many veterans with PTSD experience difficulty finding and maintaining employment. Family members who assist with the veteran's recovery also experience significant strain and may have to leave employment to care for the veteran. Our objective was to identify appropriate assessment measures for examining the well-being of <b>spouses</b> <b>assisting</b> with veterans' recovery and to identify opportunities for supporting veterans' spouses. We used a combination of expert panel input and qualitative methods (focus group interviews) to develop a battery of instruments for use in future research with OIF/OEF family members to examine well-being. Research is needed to elucidate and refine the special needs and issues surrounding PTSD in current and future OIF/OEF veterans and their families. This study provides a first step toward understanding appropriate measures. Expert panel methods and focus group interviews yielded valuable input on the domains and measures that should be included in the assessment battery as well as opportunities for <b>assisting</b> <b>spouses...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe study {{investigated}} the relationship between duration of marriage, personality trait, gender and conflict resolution strategies of spouses in Makurdi, Nigeria. The research design employed was ex-post facto survey design. Purposive and convenience sampling techniques were used to select two hundred participants made up of 100 males and 100 females. Two standardized psychological instruments were used namely: Conflict Resolution Strategies Scale (CRSS) and The Big five Inventory (BFI). Data was analyzed using independent t-test, One-way Anova and multiple regression. Results showed that while duration of marriage had no significant relationship with conflict resolution strategies of spouses, personality traits and gender showed significant relationship. The result also indicated a significant interactive relationship between duration of marriage, personality traits, gender and conflict resolution strategies of spouses. It was then recommended that counsellors should put into consideration the interplay of duration of marriage, personality traits and gender when issues of conflicts arise {{with a view of}} <b>assisting</b> <b>spouses</b> in adopting helpful resolution strategies...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} whether the depressive symptoms of the bullied respondents differed according to who the perpetrator was. Methods We used cross-sectional questionnaire data from two representative cohorts: the Danish Working Environment Cohort Study (DWECS 2010) and the Work and Health Study (WH 2012). After excluding respondents not having a leader, or being self-employed, <b>assisting</b> <b>spouses,</b> and those reporting multiple perpetrators in WH 2012, the statistical analysis included 2478 bullied individuals. We compared respondents reporting being bullied by their (1) leader, (2) subordinates, (3) clients / customers / patients / students, or (4) colleagues, respectively. The occurrence of depressive symptoms was measured by the Major Depression Inventory (MDI). Results The most frequent perpetrator of bullying was clients (41. 5  %) in DWECS 2010 and colleagues (60. 3  %) in WH 2012. In DWECS 2010, the MDI score of those being bullied by clients were significantly lower than the MDI scores of the other groups. In WH 2012, respondents who reported bullying from leaders had a significantly higher mean MDI score than participants being bullied by colleagues. Also in WH 2012, our results indicated that those who were bullied by leaders had a higher MDI score than those bullied by clients, although this difference was not statistically significant at conventional levels. Conclusion Our findings indicated a similar pattern in the two cohorts, with a tendency of more severe depressive symptoms among employees who are exposed to bullying by their leaders, and the least severe symptoms among those who are bullied by clients...|$|R
40|$|The role {{of women}} (and {{specifically}} {{those involved in the}} fisheries) on the island of Evia (Central Greece), the second biggest island in the country, was depicted through an extended survey. Evia is a significant fishing area, in terms of fishing fleets and number of fish farms. The field research was based on semi-structured interviews and on the usage of proper questionnaires. These were addressed to professional fishermen, owners of fish farms and conversion plants, women occupied in fish farms, local associations and local cooperatives. The data collected refers to the economic situation of the family, the structure of the family, the social status and the educational level. Care was taken that the interviewed were covering a minimum of 5 % in each category. Data was also used from the last National (Greek) census. The women on the island of Evia play a secondary role, in relation to males, in all fields of activity. The majority of fishermen's wives is not employed, but belongs to the category of <b>assisting</b> <b>spouses.</b> They have a lower educational level than their husbands, and their participation in public affairs is very limited. The women who are working do so, mainly in the primary sector (most commonly in the fisheries), and secondarily in the tertiary sector, usually in tourism or in the service field (in the urban areas). In fish farming, women are working independently from their husband's involvement in the field. Most of the women (59 %) are workers, 27 % are clerks in the offices and 14 % are technological or scientific staff. In the cooperatives, the {{role of women}} is also secondary: they do not participate in the administration, being mainly involved in the production and marketing of the products. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the effect of}} chronic debilitating illness {{on the quality of}} marital relationships. Twenty couples participated in qualitative interviews. Diagnosis and time duration of the illness, and demographic data were obtained. Subjects were asked to tell the researcher what it had been like for them as a couple to deal with the chronic illness. Couples must have been married for at least 5 years, must have one or both spouses or a dependent child affected by a chronic debilitating illness which had been diagnosed for at least 6 months and was not yet in the terminal phase, and both spouses were required to participate;Analysis of the data revealed the following: Couples who experienced areas of marital distress prior to the onset of the illness experienced an increase in their marital distress after the onset of the illness. High levels of individual stress did not correlate with high levels of marital stress or affect the level of quality of the marital relationship adversely. Roles were altered to accommodate the physical and emotional changes which occurred with the illness, but few power changes occurred. Illness which caused mental/emotional changes in the spouse created more marital distress than did illness which was more limited to physical alterations in functioning. Couples for whom illness created financial hardship experienced the highest levels of individual stress, but not necessarily increased marital stress. A satisfactory and high quality marriage served as a resistance factor, <b>assisting</b> <b>spouses</b> to cope with the illness;Certain family typologies and a strong religious or philosophical faith in a positive meaning of life experiences correlated with high marital satisfaction and quality. Social institutions, family and friends could serve as added stressors or as resistance factors. The majority of couples believed that the end effect of the illness on their relationships was to make them stronger, with increased bonding and appreciation of each other, often after an initial decrease in marital quality. Couples who experienced decreased satisfaction and lower levels of marital quality were those who had deficits in communication and affectional exchange and several areas of unresolved conflict prior to the illness...|$|R

40|$|Cardiac {{surgery is}} flourishing in today's health care {{industry}} and looks to prosper well into the future. More than ever, improved technology, surgical skill and the worldwide trend of increasing longevity means that surgical intervention is offered to patients rarely seen in cardiac units in previous years. Patients are now much older, with multiple co-morbidity including repeat cardiac surgery. In line with advances in cardiac surgery, critical pathways to map the expected recovery route for the patient have been introduced. These maps are used extensively as guides for treatment and care. It is not only health professionals who use the pathways; patients and their relatives also {{refer to them as}} indicators of a ‘normal’ post-operative route. As a result, the critical pathway provides an avenue for expectations of predicted progress through to discharge. These predictors appear to give spouses hope, access to earliest possible visitation and confidence in a positive outcome. Nevertheless, it has recently become increasingly clear that for partners of patients who fail to proceed as expected, who apparently ‘fall off’ the predicted road to recovery, the critical pathway is problematic. Partners of such patients tend to demonstrate greatly heightened anxiety and nurses often have to deal with them at the point of crisis. In the cardio-thoracic unit at which this study was undertaken, the significant number of spouses who ended up in crisis drew attention to the need for additional support to be built into the post openheart surgery critical recovery pathway. This study sought therefore to examine how nurses might <b>assist</b> <b>spouses</b> to adapt {{in the event of a}} complicated recovery following bypass surgery. A convenience sample of 39 spouses of cardiac surgical patients admitted to the cardio-thoracic recovery unit was obtained to assess stress responses at a critical post-operative data point, 5 days post-surgery. A symptoms of stress inventory was used to measure 94 items of physiological stress in 10 specific subscale categories. As a result of this study, it was found that incorporating a spousal support programme into the critical pathway of open-heart surgical patients significantly reduced stress suffered by spouses of patients who deviated from pre-determined recovery goals. The findings suggest that nurses need to understand the implications of the critical pathway and provide families with information concerning issues associated with complicated recovery. An unexpected finding of the study pointed to an apparent difference in the stress experienced by male spouses to that of female spouses. Recommendations from this study are to further explore the qualitative component of the stress felt by spouses and the negative association of stress with morbidity and mortality for women and patients without spouses. Nurses need to consider developing and implementing a stress management programme for spouses, establishing spousal support groups and exploring the possibility of incorporating spousal support strategies into the critical pathways of patients across hospital settings.

5000|$|Mama Ocllo was the {{daughter}} of the Inca Pachacuti Inca Yupanqui, and the sister of Topa Inca Yupanqui. She married her brother in accordance to custom and became his legitimate spouse and queen. She was the mother of Huayna Capac and Coya Cusirimay. Queen Mama Ocllo is described as a dominant figure, [...] "desirous for wealth" [...] and remembered for her stratagems by which she was to have wielded great influence upon the affairs of state. According to legend, the queen <b>assisted</b> her <b>spouse</b> in the conquest of a city in Chimor ruled by a female Capallana - the city was possibly Tumbez. When the Capallana refused the Inca's request to submit, Mama Ocllo asked her spouse to allow her to intercede and promised to give him the city without the loss of a single warrior. She had a message sent to the female ruler, that her courage had saved her city and that the Inca army would let it be. She only asked that the Inca ambassador bringing this news would be celebrated with a fest in honor of the gods of the sea, which naturally would take place on boats. When the whole city was occupied afloat at sea to celebrate, the Inca army stormed in and took the city. The Capallana herself became the personal captive of the queen in recognition of the role she had played in the conquest.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{descriptive}} correlational study was threefold: (a) to assess the relationships between boundary ambiguity, spirituality, marital relationship quality, and caregiver strain and depression among older African American spousal caregivers of persons with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD); (b) to identify which variables are the best predictors of caregiver strain; and (c) to identify which variables are the best predictors of depression. The sample consisted of 25 female and 15 male spouses, who were ages 60 to 87. The {{data were analyzed using}} descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation coefficients, and multiple regression. Marital relationship quality was correlated with the two dependent variables, caregiver strain and depression. In hierarchical multiple regression, a model containing gender, years since spouse’s diagnosis with AD and marital relationship quality predicted 40 % of the variance in caregiver strain. Marital relationship quality was the only significant predictor for depression. The model containing marital relationship quality predicted 22 % of the variance in depression. Additional findings were that participants scored high on the spirituality measure, that years since diagnosis of AD was negatively correlated with boundary ambiguity, spirituality, and caregiver strain, that there was a significant decrease in the quality of the marital relationship since the spouse became a caregiver, and that almost half had no help with caregiving. There was limited support for the proposed conceptual model, therefore, a revised model was proposed. Based on the study results, in dealing with spouses who are providing caregiving to AD patients, nurses need to assess the quality of the marital relationship, and to recognize that the longer the spouse is a caregiver the greater the strain and depression, and that community resources need to be mobilized to <b>assist</b> the <b>spouse</b> with caregiving.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{relationship}} between mutual spouse support and the psychological status of spouses whose mates were being treated for cancer. The conceptual framework was developed from a literature review in which empirical studies and interpersonal theories suggested the importance of social support to health promotion and maintenance in stressful life situations. A descriptive cross-sectional correlational design was used. A convenience sample consisted of 146 individuals (73 couples) one of whom was being treated for cancer. Subjects completed adapted versions of Tilden's Interpersonal Relationships Inventory and Braden's Disease Course Graphic Scale, Rosenberg's Self-Esteem Scale, and the Center for Epidemiological Studies - Depression Scale. Study findings indicate that: (1) Well spouses perceived less support in the marital relationship than did spouses with cancer. (2) Well spouses' depression was lower and self-esteem higher when both spouses perceived high levels of interpersonal support. (3) When both spouses perceived low levels of interpersonal support depression was higher and self-esteem lower in the well spouse. (4) When one spouse perceived high and the other low levels of interpersonal support depression was higher and self-esteem lower in the well spouse. (5) Well spouses' self-esteem was higher when both spouses perceived high levels of marital reciprocal support. (6) When both spouses perceived low levels of marital reciprocal support self-esteem was lower in the well spouse. (7) When one spouse perceived high and the other low levels of marital reciprocal support self-esteem was lower in the well spouse. (8) The greater the absolute difference in dyadic perception of interpersonal support the greater the well spouses' depression. (9) The more well spouses perceived marital reciprocal support the higher was their self-esteem and lower their depression. Research is needed that identifies whether health outcomes are better when spouses support each other than when the well spouse supports the patient without perceiving support in return. Results of this study provide a beginning point from which to pursue theory development, testing, and intervention studies to <b>assist</b> both <b>spouses</b> with optimal management of the cancer experience...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades, Canadian {{military}} members have experienced {{a significant increase in}} their participation in military operations, both abroad and at home, escalating the number of soldiers 1 dealing with psychological injuries. Those returning home from deployment with symptoms of psychological distress and reduced functioning have a profound impact on their family system.

40|$|Abstract This Master´s thesis {{examines}} {{the factors that}} affect the adjustment of expatriate families {{and the influence of}} the accompanying family on the perceived outcome of expatriate assignments. Due to increased competition and the need to rely on the knowledge of its human capital, companies are sending expatriates abroad to complete international assignments. In many cases, the family accompanies the expatriate manager abroad, which entails that the entire family needs to adjust to the new living situation. The accompanying family is often portrayed as negative as the inability of family members to adjust to the new living situation is the most commonly stated reason for assignment failure. Thus, this research aims to study the factors that might make the transition to the new environment smoother and discover how the accompanying family affects the perceived outcome of the assignment. The literature strongly emphasizes the role of the sending company to select, train and support the best expatriates by assessing the possible candidate and his or her family situation. Companies should carefully select the best employee to send abroad and provide cross-cultural training for the entire family prior to departure. The literature draws attention to the accompanying spouse´s challenging role in adjusting to his or her new role as a stay-at-home spouse and suggests companies to <b>assist</b> expatriate <b>spouses</b> in developing a meaningful life abroad. It is suggested that by making sure that the entire family gets adjusted through proper training and support the entire adjustment will be successfully completed. The research method is an interview-based international business research, which focuses on providing a dynamic and holistic view of the topic. The empirical part of this study was conducted through interviewing six different Finnish expatriate families from four different companies. The empirical findings convey that expatriate managers themselves view the company of their families as important during their international assignment. The accompanying family contributes to that there is a balance between work and spare time for the expatriate manager and integrates the expatriate to the new environment. The key finding of this thesis was that the attitudes, expectations and motivations of the entire family strongly affect their ability to adjust to a new environment. Although the literature emphasized the role of the sending company in {{the success or failure of}} the assignments, the empirical findings conveyed that expatriate families do not expect the sending company to help them with everything. However, the importance of a supportive expatriate community, proper housing and the external environment was highlighted as key enablers of the families’ successful completion of the assignment.

40|$|Abstract Background Since enteral {{nutrition}} therapy {{is the preferred}} nutritional support for dysphagic patients {{with a range of}} diagnoses, PEG has become part of traditional care. However, {{enteral nutrition}} with PEG transfers treatment responsibility and activity to the patients and their carers, so the advantages should be discussed. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate patients’ experience of living with a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) in order to increase the understanding of patients’ need for support. Method In a prospective study at Karolinska University Hospital in Sweden, data were collected consecutively at the time of PEG and two months later using a study-specific questionnaire about each patient’s experience of living with a PEG. Fishers exact test was used to test for statistically significant difference at five per cent level. Results There were 104 responders (response rate of 70 %). Women felt more limited in daily activity compared to men (p[*]=[*] 0. 004). Older patients experienced a more limited ability to influence the number of feeding times compared to younger (p[*]=[*] 0. 026). Highly educated patients found feeding more time-consuming (p[*]=[*] 0. 004). Patients with a cancer diagnosis reported that the PEG feeding interfered with their oral feeding more than patients with a neurological disease (p[*]=[*] 0. 009). Patients mostly contacted the PEG outpatient clinic with problems regarding their PEG, and were mainly <b>assisted</b> by their <b>spouse</b> rather than district nurses. Conclusions PEG feeding is time-consuming and interferes with daily life. Although 73 % was satisfied, patients’ experiences of living with a PEG may be dependent on age, sex, education and diagnosis. Spouses are the main carers for PEG patients at home, and patients prefer to go to the PEG outpatient clinic for help if problems occur. </p...|$|R

The method for collecting data was 1) to evaluate the emotional status of the spouse of the stroke patient with the POMS (Profile Of Mood State) inventory before he was exposed to the content of the psychological information program on stroke. 2) The spouse of the stroke patient was then introduced to the psychological information program, and any questions which arose were answered. 3) A follow up appointment was arranged for ten days later. During this appointment the POMS inventory was administered again to assess the spouse's emotional status after exposure to the psychological informationprogram on stroke. Any further questions were answered. Within a framework of identified themes a phenomenological description of the experiences of the spouse of the stroke patient was given. The most important experiences were identified as confusion, anxiety, tension, rage, frustration, tiredness, and feelings of not being motivated and depression. The phenomenological themes were "Om-te-wees (Dasein) ", "Die wereld", "In-die-wereld-wees", "Om-ingegooi-tewees- in-die-wereld", "Angs as basiese ingesteldheid tot die wereld" and "Liggaamlikheid". The current research was motivated after a thorough study of the literature on stroke. The literature survey revealed a deficiency in terms of availability of information on stroke to the spouse of the stroke patient after the stroke has occured. The literature survey disclosed that the focus of research has been on the stroke patient. Research identified the spouse of the stroke patient as the primary caretaker. Therefore {{it is important that the}} spouse of the stroke patient will have access to psychological information on stroke to assist them during their tasks of caretaking. Certain variables influenced theresults of the present research project. These variables were 1) the time when the psychological information was provided to the subjects, 2) the emotional status after the stroke had occurred, and 3) the extent of information the subjects received from other resources. During the current research project the subjects confirmed the value of the availability of psychological information on stroke. The psychological information on stroke is important in <b>assisting</b> the <b>spouse</b> of the stroke patient during their tasks of caret•king. The psychological information on stroke provides the spouse of the stroke patient with 1) a better understanding of the stroke patient, 2) knowledge of what to expect after a stroke had occured, and 3) realistic goals for the future...|$|R
40|$|Over 1000 Townsville based {{members of}} the Australian Defence Force (ADF) were {{deployed}} on an 8 -month military operation to Afghanistan from August 2011 until May 2012. A similar scenario occurred {{many times in the}} Townsville community between 1999 and 2013 as {{members of the}} ADF have been deployed repeatedly to East Timor, Iraq and Afghanistan. A military deployment presents major life changes for ADF members and their families. Families of ADF members learn to cope not only with having their loved one away on a dangerous operation but also with the additional pressures associated with having one less adult living in the family home (McGuire et al., 2012). Children in the family are required to adjust to changes in family structure and routines, and often take on additional individual responsibilities. It is not uncommon for students to express their reactions to these changes through behavioural changes at school. Academic progress, classroom and playground behaviour may be adversely affected by children's reactions to family stress (Leuscher, 2012; Huebner et al., 2007). Defence School Transition Aides (DSTAs) <b>assist</b> children and <b>spouses</b> of ADF members to develop positive coping strategies and build resilience to family changes associated with a parental deployment to a war zone. They are employed in over 100 Australian schools and offer a comprehensive program of support to students from ADF families in the school setting. During the 2011 - 12 deployment the DSTAs in Townsville articulated their work practice into a comprehensive model to enhance peer support networks for students and parents, facilitate communication between the family and school, promote whole school awareness of family contribution to military operational success as well as provide and facilitate individual student and parent support. This practice model has potential applications for a diverse range of families that also experience parental absence for varying periods of time. The identification of key times of potential stress for students and the application of well targeted strategies can assist to alleviate some of the pressures associated with family and individual child stress responses exacerbated by periodic parental absence...|$|R
50|$|The Court of Appeals, in {{an opinion}} {{authored}} by Judge Billings, affirmed the trial court's award of diminishing monthly alimony {{for a time}} period less than {{the length of the}} marriage as well as affirming a property division where there were certain assets that were not divided equally. Wife appealed the trial court's ruling that certain specific assets that were not divided equally. In affirming, the Court of Appeals noted that the goal of a property division is to receive a fair result between the parties. In awarding property, a court should determine which property is marital along with its value. The court should then divide the property equally unless it finds exceptional circumstances to do otherwise. Wife asserted that the trial court erred because it failed to divide certain marital property equally. The Court of Appeals held that a trial court is not required to divide each piece of property equally, but it can look to the marital estate in its entirety and divide the entire estate in a manner that best facilitates a clean break between the parties. The Court noted that husband had assumed all the marital deb and that the trial court made a specific finding that considering the debt, the property division was equitable. Wife also appealed her alimony award on two grounds: first that the trial court erred by not adjusting alimony (presumably an upward adjustment) based upon husband's fault and second that the court erred by awarding her diminishing alimony for a time less than the length of alimony. The Court of Appeals rejected wife's claim regarding fault by merely pointing out that the statute sets forth that a trial court may consider fault but is not required to consider fault. The Court of Appeals then considered the diminishing alimony award under a two part analysis: was it a prospective change to a traditional alimony award or was it rehabilitative alimony? The Court noted that making future adjustments to a traditional alimony award is generally only justified when the anticipated event is certain, such as reductions in child support increasing alimony by a similar sum. The Court indicated that if the event is not certain then the trial court would be {{in a better position to}} consider the event at the time of the event. Rehabilitative alimony on the other hand is designed to <b>assist</b> the recipient <b>spouse</b> in the transition to self-sufficiency. The Court remanded to the trial court to clarify whether it had made future adjustments to a traditional alimony award or awarded rehabilitative alimony and required the trial court to clarify the time of the alimony given that there was a mathematical error in the trial court's order.|$|R
