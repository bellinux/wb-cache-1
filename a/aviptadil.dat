40|$|Purification {{and quality}} control of {{therapeutic}} peptides is often performed by one single method, RP-HPLC. As usage of an orthogonal technique is highly advisable for quality assurance, capillary electrophoresis (CE) employing a coated capillary coupled via a sheathless interface to a mass spectrometer was applied in parallel. The basic therapeutic peptide <b>aviptadil</b> {{served as a}} model substance to study the impurity profiles revealing 15 detectable impurities using CE-MS, two were detected by an appropriate nanoRP-HPLC-MS method. None of the impurities detected by CE were observed in LC and vice versa. The LOD in CE-MS was determined in the base peak electropherogram at âˆ¼ 1 fmol, a value 2500 times smaller than the LOD found in nanoRP-HPLC-MS (3 pmol). In nanoRP-HPLC-MS only 0. 2 % of the extrapolated CE-MS signal for a 25 ng <b>aviptadil</b> load was observed. We conclude that both, the LOD {{as well as the}} impurity profile of <b>aviptadil,</b> as analyzed by nanoRP-HPLC are influenced by both, the ligand-derivatized silica matrix and the flow-rate. Peptides may disappear completely and their variable emergence may lead to the determination of incorrect ratios as present in the sample...|$|E
