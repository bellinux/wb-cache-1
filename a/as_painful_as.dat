5|$|Miguel feigned {{compliance}} with PedroI's plans. As {{soon as he}} was declared regent in early 1828, and backed by Carlota Joaquina, he abrogated the Constitution and, supported by those Portuguese in favor of absolutism, was acclaimed King Dom MiguelI. <b>As</b> <b>painful</b> <b>as</b> was his beloved brother's betrayal, PedroI also endured the defection of his surviving sisters, Maria Teresa, Maria Francisca, Isabel Maria and Maria da Assunção, to MiguelI's faction. Only his youngest sister, Ana de Jesus, remained faithful to him, and she later traveled to Rio de Janeiro to be close to him. Consumed by hatred and beginning to believe rumors that MiguelI had murdered their father, PedroI turned his focus on Portugal and tried in vain to garner international support for MariaII's rights.|$|E
25|$|Since bone {{healing is}} a natural process that will occur most often, {{fracture}} treatment aims to ensure the best possible function of the injured part after healing. Bone fractures typically are treated by restoring the fractured pieces of bone to their natural positions (if necessary), and maintaining those positions while the bone heals. Often, aligning the bone, called reduction, in good position and verifying the improved alignment with an X-ray {{is all that is}} needed. This process is extremely painful without anesthesia, about <b>as</b> <b>painful</b> <b>as</b> breaking the bone itself. To this end, a fractured limb usually is immobilized with a plaster or fiberglass cast or splint that holds the bones in position and immobilizes the joints above and below the fracture. When the initial post-fracture edema or swelling goes down, the fracture may be placed in a removable brace or orthosis. If being treated with surgery, surgical nails, screws, plates, and wires are used to hold the fractured bone together more directly. Alternatively, fractured bones may be treated by the Ilizarov method which is a form of external fixator.|$|E

After the video shoot, Girls Aloud {{decided it was time}} to change their choreographer, hiring Beth Honan, who continued to work with the band for several years. Walsh also said that the music video for [...] "The Show" [...] was her least favourite from the band. The story takes place in a salon called [...] "Curls Allowed." [...] Each member of the band plays a character working in the salon, pampering and making-up a variety of men. Nicola Roberts is [...] "Chelsea Tanner," [...] who sprays insulting messages with fake bronzer onto her male customers; Nadine Coyle is [...] "Frenchie", who ineptly tries to give her male customers facials; Sarah Harding is [...] "Supa Styler", a hair stylist who fails to satisfy any of her customers; Cheryl Cole is [...] "Maxi Wax", who makes the waxing process <b>as</b> <b>painful</b> <b>as</b> possible; and Kimberley Walsh is [...] "The Boss", who looks on amusedly as her employees take their revenge on the salon's male customers.|$|E

2500|$|On 21 November, having {{allowed herself}} {{six weeks to}} recover from her illness, Wellington set a new world record for an Ironman-branded race over the full Ironman {{distance}} in Tempe, Arizona of 8:36:13. Her time was the third-fastest female ironman-distance time to date, beaten only by her two records in Roth. Despite riding the last two miles of the bike course on a flat tyre, she beat the previous course record by 35minutes, and runner-up Linsey Corbin's time by 29minutes. Her marathon time was only 4:44 slower than the fastest men's run, and her swim time only 32seconds slower than the men's winner, Timo Bracht. Commentator Timothy Carlson quoted Wellington's boyfriend as saying, [...] "It's {{a sign of a}} true champion that she can pick herself up after something <b>as</b> <b>painful</b> <b>as</b> her withdrawal at Hawaii. Six weeks later, all the issues from Hawaii were behind her, and today she was phenomenal", to which Carlson added, [...] "Phenomenal might have been an understatement." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 2 March 1975, {{the shah}} {{dissolved}} the Iran Novin Party and its opposition elements {{in creating a}} single party system headed by the Rastakhiz (Resurgence/Resurrection) Party. In relation to Hoveyda, {{it is believed that}} the shah was being threatened by the growing influence wielded by party officials, Hoveyda being the most notable. The growth of an independent apparatus was contrary to the Shah's contrivance involving the consolidation of all power. Hoveyda's inability to garner any type of power base in government allowed him to concentrate much of his energy on developing the Iran Novin Party. The networks he had slowly developed over the years came to trouble the monarch. Although Hoveyda would be coerced into relinquishing his position as PM, he accepted a temporary intermediary role as secretary general of Rastakhiz before a new Prime Minister can be appointed. Nevertheless, the Shah still saw Hovedya as a trusted (if not pliable) figure, and he was appointed to be minister of court. In her memoirs, Queen Farah wrote that asking Hoveyda to leave the post of prime minister was <b>as</b> <b>painful</b> <b>as</b> [...] "giving birth to a baby".|$|E
2500|$|The {{use of the}} series' {{trademark}} humor {{received a}} mixed response. In one regard, some critics such as Team Xbox praised the voice work of Jon St. John, who did an [...] "excellent job as always with Duke's persona", whilst others such as Machinima.com appreciated the comedic gameplay tips and pop culture references; however, the same critic also noted that [...] "parts of the narrative and dialogue show clear evidence of the game's elongated development. Many pop culture references refer to media in the early 2000s, with one-liners co-opted from 'guy' movies like Old School, Highlander, and Commando, which in itself could cause blank stares {{from most of the}} current potential audience." [...] Australian gaming website PALGN felt the game was [...] "saved only by its humor and nostalgic value." [...] Official Xbox Magazine UK thought that the humor [...] "isn't so much offensive or misogynistic as just suffering from an adolescent fixation with boobs and crowbarred-in innuendo." [...] Joystiq noted that the game's multiplayer mode [...] "Capture the Babe", involving [...] "spanking a woman into submission", [...] "really is <b>as</b> <b>painful</b> <b>as</b> it sounds". Many critics conversely criticized the characterization of Duke Nukem, declaring his decidedly one-dimensional personality juvenile and outdated in comparison to more recent video game heroes.|$|E

2500|$|Presenting a child's life {{beginning}} with birth, Beauvoir contrasts a girl's upbringing with a boy's, who at age 3 or 4 is told he is a [...] "little man". A girl is taught to {{be a woman}} and her [...] "feminine" [...] destiny is imposed on her by society. She has no innate [...] "maternal instinct". A girl comes to believe in and to worship a male god and to create imaginary adult lovers. The discovery of sex is a [...] "phenomenon <b>as</b> <b>painful</b> <b>as</b> weaning" [...] and she views it with disgust. When she discovers that men, not women, are the masters of the world this [...] "imperiously modifies her consciousness of herself". Beauvoir describes puberty, the beginning of menstruation, and the way girls imagine sex with a man. She relates several ways that girls in their late teens accept their [...] "femininity", which may include running away from home, fascination with the disgusting, following nature, or stealing. Beauvoir describes sexual relations with men, maintaining that the repercussions of the first of these experiences informs a woman's whole life. Beauvoir describes women's sexual relations with women. She writes that [...] "homosexuality is no more a deliberate perversion than a fatal curse".|$|E
2500|$|Many of {{her other}} {{photographs}} containing her nude or hurt children caused controversy. For example, in [...] "The Perfect Tomato," [...] the viewer sees a nude Jessie, posing on a picnic table outside, bathed in light. Jessie told Steven Cantor during the filming {{of one of his}} movies that she had just been playing around and her mother told her to freeze, and she tried to capture the image in a rush because the sun was setting. This explains why everything is blurred except for the tomato, hence the photograph's title. This image was likely criticized for Jessie’s nudity and presentation of the adolescent female form. While Jessie was aware of this photograph, Dana Cox, in her essay, said that the Mann children were probably unaware of the other photographs being taken as Mann’s children were often naked because “it came natural to them.” This habit of nudity is a family thing because Mann says she used to walk around her house naked when she was growing up. Cox states that “the own artist’s childhood is reflected in the way she captures moments in her children’s lives.” One image that deals more with another aspect of childhood besides [...] "naked play", Jessie's Cut, shows Jessie's head, wrapped in what appears to be plastic, with blood running down the side of her face from the cut above her left eye. The cut is stitched and the blood is dry and stains her skin. <b>As</b> <b>painful</b> <b>as</b> the image looks, there are a great number of viewers who could relate to Jessie when they think about the broken bones and stitched up cuts they had during childhood.|$|E

60|$|Bolshevism, like {{everything}} Russian, is partly Asiatic in character. One may distinguish two distinct trends, developing into two distinct policies. On {{the one side}} are the practical men, who wish to develop Russia industrially, to secure the gains of the Revolution nationally, to trade with the West, and gradually settle down into {{a more or less}} ordinary State. These men have on their side the fact of the economic exhaustion of Russia, the danger of ultimate revolt against Bolshevism if life continues to be <b>as</b> <b>painful</b> <b>as</b> it is at present, and the natural sentiment of humanity that wishes to relieve the sufferings of the people; also the fact that, if revolutions elsewhere produce a similar collapse of industry, they will make it impossible for Russia to receive the outside help which is urgently needed.
