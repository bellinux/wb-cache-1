5|$|Hornish began {{competing}} in the NASCAR Busch Series in the No. 39 Dodge Charger late in the 2006 season for Penske Racing. He drove the last two events of the season, struggling in both races. At Phoenix, Hornish started 27th and finished 36th after <b>a</b> <b>crash</b> on lap 187. In the season-ending race at Homestead-Miami, he was involved <b>a</b> <b>crash</b> after five laps and finished last.|$|E

5|$|Alvarez's {{aviation}} responsibilities led to many adventures. For example, {{while working}} on GCA {{he became the first}} civilian to fly a low approach with his view outside the cockpit obstructed. He also flew many military aircraft from the co-pilot's seat, including a B-29 Superfortress and a Lockheed F-104 Starfighter. In addition, he survived <b>a</b> <b>crash</b> during World War II as a passenger in a Miles Master.|$|E
5|$|By 1949, Soviet-backed governments {{had already}} begun seizing control {{throughout}} Eastern Europe, forming such puppet states as the Hungarian People's Republic in Teller's homeland of Hungary, where much of his family still lived, on August 20, 1949. Following the Soviet Union's first test detonation of an atomic bomb on August 29, 1949, President Harry Truman announced <b>a</b> <b>crash</b> development program for a hydrogen bomb.|$|E

5|$|Hornish {{returned}} to the series in 2007, driving nine races for Penske in the No. 12. He had his best start and finish {{of the season in}} the Nicorette 300 at Atlanta Motor Speedway, starting fifth and finishing fifteenth. Hornish earned another top-ten start (sixth place) at the season-ending race at Homestead-Miami. Despite a good qualifying run, he finished 38th after <b>a</b> <b>crash</b> with Todd Bodine on lap 114.|$|E
5|$|Hōshō {{was fitted}} with a net used as <b>a</b> <b>crash</b> barrier aft of the forward {{elevator}} between 10 March and 2 July 1925. The barrier was intended to prevent landing aircraft from colliding with aircraft preparing to take off, and stop them from falling into the open elevator well. The barrier was hydraulically operated and could be erected in three seconds.|$|E

Tobias tried to correct the oversteer {{only to have the}} cousins collide {{on the opposite side of}} the ice wall, causing both to go airborne momentarily. Neither suffered any injury.|$|E
5|$|Metrolink {{has also}} {{featured}} in television drama. On 6 December 2010, the popular soap opera Coronation Street featured a storyline with an explosion which caused <b>a</b> <b>crash</b> on the Metrolink system at Weatherfield. The episode was written {{to celebrate the}} soap opera's 50th anniversary. Although a fictitious event, at least six calls were made to GMPTE asking if services had been affected.|$|E
5|$|On the AEC from 1949 to 1954, Smyth argued unsuccessfully against <b>a</b> <b>crash</b> {{course to}} develop the {{hydrogen}} bomb and in favor of international control of nuclear weapons. He was the sole {{member of the commission}} to vote against stripping J. Robert Oppenheimer's security clearance. As IAEA ambassador from 1961 to 1970 he {{played an important role in}} the realization of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.|$|E

5|$|On the {{declaration}} of war between the United Kingdom, France, and Germany in September 1939, the Belgian government launched <b>a</b> <b>crash</b> re-armament program, augmenting the national defenses by creating the K-W Line linking the National Redoubt at Antwerp with the south along the River Dijle, just behind the main Fortified Position of Liège.|$|E
5|$|The B-52B was {{the first}} version to enter service with the USAF on 29 June 1955 with the 93rd Bombardment Wing at Castle AFB, California. This version {{included}} minor changes to engines and avionics, enabling an extra 12,000 pounds of thrust using water injection. Temporary grounding of the aircraft after <b>a</b> <b>crash</b> in February 1956 and again the following July caused training delays, and at mid-year there were still no combat-ready B-52 crews.|$|E

5|$|The {{first test}} for the flying {{sequences}} involved simply catapulting <b>a</b> <b>crash</b> test dummy out of a cannon. Another technique had a remote control cast of Superman flying around. Both were discarded {{due to lack of}} movement. High-quality, realistic-looking animation was tried, with speed trails added to make the effect more convincing.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} a {{significant}} number of accidents involving the Sea Harrier; this accident rate has caused approximately half the fleet to be lost with only 11 fighters remaining in service. Following <b>a</b> <b>crash</b> in August 2009, all Sea Harriers were temporarily grounded for inspection. Since the beginning of operational service in the Indian Navy, seven pilots have died in 17 crashes involving the Sea Harrier, usually during routine sorties.|$|E
5|$|After the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) {{came into}} being in 1947 as a {{civilian}} agency in control of nuclear research and weapons issues, Oppenheimer was appointed as the Chairman of its General Advisory Committee (GAC). From this position he advised {{on a number of}} nuclear-related issues, including project funding, laboratory construction and even international policy—though the GAC's advice was not always heeded. As Chairman of the GAC, Oppenheimer lobbied vigorously for international arms control and funding for basic science, and attempted to influence policy away from a heated arms race. When the government questioned whether to pursue <b>a</b> <b>crash</b> program to develop an atomic weapon based on nuclear fusion—the hydrogen bomb—Oppenheimer initially recommended against it, though he had been in favor of developing such a weapon during the Manhattan Project. He was motivated partly by ethical concerns, feeling that such a weapon could only be used strategically against civilian targets, resulting in millions of deaths. He was also motivated by practical concerns, however, as at the time there was no workable design for a hydrogen bomb. Oppenheimer felt that resources would be better spent creating a large force of fission weapons. He and others were especially concerned about nuclear reactors being diverted from plutonium to tritium production. They were overridden by Truman, who announced <b>a</b> <b>crash</b> program after the Soviet Union tested their first atomic bomb in 1949. Oppenheimer and other GAC opponents of the project, especially James Conant, felt personally shunned and considered retiring from the committee. They stayed on, though their views on the hydrogen bomb were well known.|$|E
