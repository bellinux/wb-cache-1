5|$|During the off-season, an up-start league was created, the Players' League(PL), {{which drew}} many players away from teams {{from both the}} AA and NL teams. The Browns lost <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> best players as well, {{including}} Comiskey, their player-manager, and King, the team's top pitcher. Chamberlain re-signed with the team, but he was sold to the Columbus Solons after pitching in just five games. These movements left Stivetts and Toad Ramsey as the franchise's top two starters, with rookie Billy Hart cast as the occasional relief starter.|$|E
5|$|In 1972 and 1976 a {{large number}} of African {{countries}} threatened the IOC with a boycott to force them to ban South Africa and Rhodesia, because of their segregationist regimes. New Zealand {{was also one of the}} African boycott targets, because its national rugby union team had toured apartheid-ruled South Africa. The IOC conceded in the first two cases, but refused to ban New Zealand on the grounds that rugby was not an Olympic sport. Fulfilling their threat, twenty African countries were joined by Guyana and Iraq in a withdrawal from the Montreal Games, after <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> athletes had already competed.|$|E

However, the new masters of Mattau also inherited their enemies, with both Favorlang and Tirosen expressing hostility towards the VOC in the wake of their victory.|$|E

With no command structure, they were attached to the 1st Parachute Battalion to help defend the bridge. To the north, the Italian 372nd Coastal Battalion and the 10th Arditi Regiment had been informed of the parachute landings. Many of the 372nd Battalion had disappeared, while the Arditi mounted the first of a number of attacks on the British positions.

25|$|Hoobastank {{has been}} {{categorized}} under genres such as post-grunge, alternative rock, hard rock, and nu metal, On their early independent releases, the band used a funk metal and ska punk sound {{and had a}} saxophone musician in the band.

25|$|Both sides {{tried to}} break the {{stalemate}} using scientific and technological advances. On 22 April 1915, at the Second Battle of Ypres, the Germans (violating the Hague Convention) used chlorine gas {{for the first time}} on the Western Front. Several types of gas soon became widely used by both sides, and though it never proved a decisive, battle-winning weapon, poison gas became one of the most-feared and best-remembered horrors of the war. Tanks were developed by Britain and France, and were first used in combat by the British during the Battle of Flers–Courcelette (part of the Battle of the Somme) on 15 September 1916, with only partial success. However, their effectiveness would grow as the war progressed; the Allies built tanks in large numbers, whilst the Germans employed only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> own design, supplemented by captured Allied tanks.|$|E

On his way to the church, Gabriel saw his brothers Prince Konstantin and Prince Georgy walking on Morskaya Street. They had just met Antonina in a wedding dress in another car. Only later, the two brothers realized what had happened. Once married, Gabriel went to see his mother who, although she was very upset, at the end gave him her blessing. From then on Gabriel moved into Nesteroskaya's apartment where for a time, the couple lived quietly.|$|E
25|$|The end of {{the regular}} season brought in-state rival Oklahoma State to Norman. This rivalry, {{referred}} to as the Bedlam Series, is the most lopsided series in the nation featuring two teams from the same state. Entering the game, Oklahoma led the series 80–15–7. At that time, Oklahoma State was one of only two teams that had defeated the Sooners at home under Bob Stoops. However, the Sooners came into the game with a six-game winning streak over the Cowboys. The Cowboys came into the game with hopes of a BCS berth, depending on a victory. Oklahoma State was ranked number 11 while the Sooners were unranked, which marked the third time a ranked Cowboys team played an unranked Sooners team, while the opposite scenario had occurred 38times. Despite the ranking, Oklahoma was favored to win by eight points. In addition to the injuries Oklahoma had sustained throughout the season, Oklahoma State also came into the game missing <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> key players. OSU wide receiver Dez Bryant was ruled ineligible by the NCAA in the weeks prior to the Bedlam game. Quarterback Zac Robinson missed the Cowboys' previous game due to a concussion.|$|E
25|$|Liberty University has an {{internet}} education component {{which is called}} LU Online, previously the Distance Learning Program (DLP). Prior to the launch of its online education component in 2009, Liberty University provided adult learning courses through the LU School of Lifelong Learning (LUSLLL) by way of its External Degree Program. The LUSLLL was Liberty University's fastest growing school at the time with Jerry Falwell forecasting in his 1997 autobiography an enrollment of 40,000 students in the early 21st Century, with the expectation of an addition 10,000 students studying on campus at the same time. Both expectations have been surpassed by current enrollment figures. Liberty's online component currently provides degrees from Associates level to Doctorate. The online school runs unilaterally with the semester program offered at Liberty University's campus. One difference with LU Online is that students take 16-week (full semester) classes for <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> cataloged courses while the remainder are taken in 8-week subterms which are titled B, C, and D. These subterms provide the student with scheduling flexibility through shorter, slightly overlapping sessions. There is a separation at the 600-level and above at which courses are only offered in the B and D terms. LU Online promotes teacher/student discourse through interactive online discussions and class size limits (capped at 25 students). Liberty University reports that enrollment for their online program is six times greater than their residential enrollment, with about 80,000 of their 92,500 total students enrolled online.|$|E
