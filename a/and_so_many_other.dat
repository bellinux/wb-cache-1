500|$|Between 1853 and 1855, Offenbach wrote three one-act operettas {{and managed}} to have them staged in Paris. They were all well received, but the {{authorities}} of the Opéra-Comique remained unmoved. Offenbach found more encouragement from the composer, singer and impresario Florimond Ronger, known professionally as Hervé. At his theatre, the Folies-Nouvelles, which had opened the previous year, Hervé pioneered French light comic opera, or [...] "opérette". In The Musical Quarterly, Martial Teneo and Theodore Baker wrote, [...] "Without the example set by Hervé, Offenbach might perhaps never have become the musician who penned Orphée aux Enfers, La belle Hélène, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> triumphant works." [...] Offenbach approached Hervé, who agreed to present a new one-act operetta with words by Jules Moinaux and music by Offenbach, called Oyayaye ou La reine des îles. It was presented on 26 June 1855 and was well received. Offenbach's biographer Peter Gammond describes it as [...] "a charming piece of nonsense". The piece depicts a double-bass player, played by Hervé, shipwrecked on a cannibal island, who after several perilous encounters with the female chief of the cannibals makes his escape using his double-bass as a boat. Offenbach pressed ahead with plans to present his works himself at his own theatre and to abandon further thoughts of acceptance by the Opéra-Comique.|$|E

2500|$|Westmoreland's {{view has}} been heavily criticized by Nick Turse, {{the author of}} the book Kill Anything That Moves: The Real American War in Vietnam. Turse said that many of the Vietnamese killed were {{actually}} innocent civilians, and the Vietnamese casualties were not just caused by military cross-fire but were a direct result of the U.S. policy and tactics, for example the policy [...] "kill everything that moves" [...] which enabled the U.S. soldiers to shoot civilians who had [...] "suspicious behavior". He concluded that, after having [...] "spoken to survivors of massacres by United States forces at Phi Phu, Trieu Ai, My Luoc <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> hamlets, I can say with certainty that Westmoreland's assessment was false".

2500|$|On August 29, 2006 Sec. Donald Rumsfeld said “Over {{the next}} decades , a {{sentiment}} took root that contended that {{if only the}} growing threats that had begun to emerge in Europe and Asia could be accommodated, then the carnage {{and the destruction of}} then-recent memory of World War I could be avoided. It was a time when a certain amount of cynicism and moral confusion set in among Western democracies. When those who warned about a coming crisis, the rise of fascism and nazism, they were ridiculed or ignored. Indeed, in the decades before World War II, a great many argued that the fascist threat was exaggerated or that it was someone else's problem. Some nations tried to negotiate a separate peace, even as the enemy made its deadly ambitions crystal clear. It was, as Winston Churchill observed, a bit like feeding a crocodile, hoping it would eat you last. ...I recount that history because once again we face similar challenges in efforts to confront the rising threat of a new type of fascism. Today -- another enemy, a different kind of enemy -- has made clear its intentions with attacks in places like New York and Washington, D.C., Bali, London, Madrid, Moscow <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> places. But some seem not to have learned history's lessons. ...With the growing lethality and the increasing availability of weapons, can we truly afford to believe that somehow, some way, vicious extremists can be appeased?
