Despite the many advantages of <b>alternate</b> <b>access</b> programmes documented in literature, numerous Engineering Faculty members {{and members of the}} management of the University of Johannesburg believed that first time applicants with A and B symbols on their senior certificate were stronger students than those students who had completed an <b>alternate</b> <b>access</b> programme. Furthermore, they felt that the <b>alternate</b> <b>access</b> students took up the places which should have been given to those students with excellent senior certificate results. While many studies have been conducted on <b>alternate</b> <b>access</b> programmes {{there appears to be no}} evidence of the academic benefits that students derive from them. This generic qualitative study focused on what students perceive to be the academic benefits of <b>alternate</b> <b>access</b> programmes for their mainstream study. Purposeful sampling was used to select Engineering students from the 2005 and 2006 cohort to participate in focus group interviews and the data gathered during the interviews were analysed and interpreted using an Interpretivist lens. The themes that emerged from the study confirmed that students found the programmes to be beneficial but that they became aware of most of the academic benefits only once they joined the mainstream students in their second year of study. This study revealed the <b>alternate</b> <b>access</b> students were of the opinion that there are a number of academic benefits that they had derived from the <b>alternate</b> <b>access</b> programmes. They were in agreement that these benefits had helped to prepare them for mainstream study and they concluded that the benefits had contributed to their academic success in their mainstream studies. The findings of this study suggest that <b>alternate</b> <b>access</b> programmes have an important role to play in providing students with access, support and success in mainstream studies which in turn leads to the increased throughput of students and {{higher education}} institutions retaining subsidy...|$|R

40|$|ATP-driven proton pumps, {{which are}} {{critical}} to the operation of a cell, maintain cytosolic and organellar pH levels within a narrow functional range. These pumps employ two very different mechanisms: an elaborate rotary mechanism used by V-ATPase H+ pumps, and a simpler <b>alternating</b> <b>access</b> mechanism used by P-ATPase H+ pumps. Why are two different mechanisms used to perform the same function? Systematic analysis, without parameter fitting, of kinetic models of the rotary, <b>alternating</b> <b>access</b> and other possible mechanisms suggest that, when the ratio of protons transported per ATP hydrolyzed exceeds one, the one-at-a-time proton transport by the rotary mechanism is faster than other possible mechanisms across {{a wide range of}} driving conditions. When the ratio is one, there is no intrinsic difference in the free energy landscape between mechanisms, and therefore all mechanisms can exhibit the same kinetic performance. To our knowledge all known rotary pumps have an H+:ATP ratio greater than one, and all known <b>alternating</b> <b>access</b> ATP-driven proton pumps have a ratio of one. Our analysis suggests a possible explanation for this apparent relationship between coupling ratio and mechanism. When the conditions under which the pump must operate permit a coupling ratio greater than one, the rotary mechanism may have been selected for its kinetic advantage. On the other hand, when conditions require a coupling ratio of one or less, the <b>alternating</b> <b>access</b> mechanism may have been selected for other possible advantages resulting from its structural and functional simplicity...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe have {{investigated}} the conduction states of human serotonin transporter (hSERT) using the voltage clamp, cut-open frog oocyte method under different internal and external ionic conditions. Our data indicate discrepancies in the <b>alternating</b> <b>access</b> model of cotransport, which cannot consistently explain substrate transport and electrophysiological data. We are able simultaneously to isolate distinct external and internal binding sites for substrate, which exert different effects upon currents conducted by hSERT, in contradiction to the <b>alternating</b> <b>access</b> model. External binding sites of coupled Na ions are likewise simultaneously accessible from {{the internal and external}} face. Although Na and Cl are putatively cotransported, they have opposite effects on the internal face of the transporter. Finally, the internal K ion does not compete with internal 5 -hydroxytryptamine for empty transporters. These data can be explained more readily in the language of ion channels, rather than carrier models distinguished by <b>alternating</b> <b>access</b> mechanisms: in a channel model of coupled transport, the currents represent different states of the same permeation path through hSERT and coupling occurs in a common pore...|$|R

40|$|The {{mitochondrial}} ADP/ATP carrier (AAC) is a membrane transporter that exchanges a cytosolic ADP for {{a matrix}} ATP. Atomic structures in an outward-facing (OF) form which binds an ADP from the intermembrane space have been solved by X-ray crystallography, and revealed their unique pseudo three-fold symmetry fold which is qualitatively different from pseudo two-fold symmetry of most transporters of which atomic structures have been solved. However, any atomic-level information on an inward-facing (IF) form, which binds an ATP from the matrix side and is fixed by binding of an inhibitor, bongkrekic acid (BA), is not available, and thus its <b>alternating</b> <b>access</b> {{mechanism for the}} transport process is unknown. Here, we report an atomic structure of the IF form predicted by atomic-level molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the <b>alternating</b> <b>access</b> transition with a recently developed accelerating technique. We successfully obtained a significantly stable IF structure characterized by newly formed well-packed and -organized inter-domain interactions through the accelerated simulations of unprecedentedly large conformational changes of the <b>alternating</b> <b>access</b> without a prior knowledge of the target protein structure. The simulation also shed light on an atomistic mechanism of the strict transport selectivity of adenosine nucleotides over guanosine and inosine ones. Furthermore, the IF structure was shown to bind ATP and BA, and thus revealed their binding mechanisms. The present study proposes a qualitatively novel view of the <b>alternating</b> <b>access</b> of transporters having the unique three-fold symmetry in atomic details and opens the way for rational drug design targeting the transporter in the dynamic functional cycle...|$|R

40|$|Background: Access sites {{other than}} the {{anterior}} gastric wall may provide improved ergonomics for natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES). Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) guidance significantly reduces, but does not eliminate, risk of <b>access</b> through these <b>alternate</b> sites. This study evaluates the utility of hydroperitoneum {{as an adjunct to}} EUS-guided access and closure of <b>alternate</b> <b>access</b> sites for NOTES. Methods: Access and closure procedures were initially performed with EUS guidance alone, and subsequently, because of complications resulting from this technique, the procedures were performed {{with the aid of a}} transabdominal hydroperitoneum. Results: In this nonrandomized study, 6 access and closure procedures performed with EUS guidance alone resulted in 4 complications. After modifying the technique to incorporate pre-access hydroperitoneum, 7 EUS-guided access and closure procedures were performed without significant complications. Conclusions: Hydroperitoneum appears to be an effective adjunct to ensure the safety of EUS-guided peritoneal entry and closure of <b>alternate</b> <b>access</b> sites for NOTES...|$|R
