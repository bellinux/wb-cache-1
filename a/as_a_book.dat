5|$|Die drei Sprünge des Wang-lun (The Three Leaps of Wang Lun) was Döblin's third novel (although it was {{the first}} to be {{published}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>book),</b> and garnered him the Fontane Prize.

Wang Lun also had an influence on younger German writers, including Lion Feuchtwanger, Anna Seghers, and Bertolt Brecht; for the latter, Wang Lun provided an impulse {{for the development of the}} theory of epic theatre. In commercial sales, it is Döblin's most successful novel after Berlin Alexanderplatz.|$|E
