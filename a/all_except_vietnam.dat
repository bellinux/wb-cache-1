50|$|The First Indochina War (also {{called the}} French Indochina War) was fought in French Indochina from 1946 through 1954 between France and the French-controlled State of Vietnam {{on the one}} side, and the Communist-dominated {{independence}} movement, the Viet Minh, on the other. The Viet Minh won the war, gaining effective control of <b>all</b> northern <b>Vietnam</b> <b>except</b> an enclave around Hanoi.|$|R

40|$|For years, {{the world}} paid scant {{attention}} to the sporadic skirmishes and sovereignty squabbles in what is known {{by many as the}} South China Sea. However, in the past few years, there have been several noteworthy happenings that have drawn the attention of media outlets, including a Chinese oil rig placement near Vietnam, a Philippine international court case, a U. S. –ASEAN summit, and Chinese reclamation projects. Many of the countries involved are members of the regional grouping known as ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations). This study examined Asean’s English-language press, looking at the amount, patterns, and tone of coverage given to regional maritime disputes. Results indicate that use of the term ‘South China Sea’ prevails in <b>all</b> countries <b>except</b> <b>Vietnam.</b> The Asean newspapers have devoted a consistent and substantial amount of space to covering the topic. Indonesia’s Jakarta Post tended to use neutral or positive language when mentioning Asean and the US, while China saw more negative associations in the coverage. Further research is suggested, taking into account mass communication theories and perspectives...|$|R
