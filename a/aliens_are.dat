Whitmore that the <b>aliens</b> <b>are</b> hostile. Thomas orders large-scale evacuations of New York City, Los Angeles, and Washington D.C., but it is too late; the timer reaches zero and the saucers activate devastating directed-energy weapons, killing millions.

The creature regains consciousness and escapes, stealing the metallic orb and warning them that the aliens have already infiltrated the town. The watch members theorize that the <b>aliens</b> <b>are</b> stealing their victims' skins and disguising themselves as humans, so anyone in Glenview could be an alien.

Evan admits that he has been avoiding his wife Abby (Rosemarie DeWitt) because he is infertile, and reveals his worry that it may cause her to leave.|$|E
