25|$|Long a timber-exporting colony, New Brunswick {{became the}} {{destination}} {{of thousands of}} Irish immigrants {{in the form of}} refugees fleeing the potato famines during the mid-19th century as the timber cargo vessels provided cheap passage when returning empty to the colony. Quarantine hospitals were located on islands {{at the mouth of the}} colony's two major ports, Saint John (Partridge Island) and Chatham-Newcastle (Middle Island), where many would ultimately die. Those who survived settled on marginal agricultural lands in the Miramichi River valley and in the Saint John River and Kennebecasis River valleys. The difficulty of farming these regions, however, saw many Irish immigrant families moving to the colony's major cities within <b>a</b> <b>generation</b> <b>or</b> to Portland, Maine or Boston.|$|E

25|$|On the Great Plains {{very few}} single men {{attempted}} {{to operate a}} farm or ranch; farmers clearly understood {{the need for a}} hard-working wife, and numerous children, to handle the many chores, including child-rearing, feeding and clothing the family, managing the housework, and feeding the hired hands. During the early years of settlement, farm women played an integral role in assuring family survival by working outdoors. After <b>a</b> <b>generation</b> <b>or</b> so, women increasingly left the fields, thus redefining their roles within the family. New conveniences such as sewing and washing machines encouraged women to turn to domestic roles. The scientific housekeeping movement, promoted across the land by the media and government extension agents, as well as county fairs which featured achievements in home cookery and canning, advice columns for women in the farm papers, and home economics courses in the schools all contributed to this trend.|$|E

25|$|By the mid-eighties {{the stock}} of {{purebred}} mares had dwindled to just a handful, though there were some mares only <b>a</b> <b>generation</b> <b>or</b> two removed. In 1983 a group of supporters formed a special breed association {{under the jurisdiction of}} the Weser-Ems Studbook, approving stallions that were half-Hanoverian, half-Ostfriesen or Alt-Oldenburg. However, as the mares themselves were typically only halfbred, the foals did not have the desired type, and furthermore the genepool was simply too small. To replenish it, the breeders looked to the studs where Ostfriesen/Alt-Oldenburger stallions had stood for generations, picking up a few horses here and there. More horses came from greater strongholds: Silesian Heavy Warmbloods of Poland, the Danish Oldenbourgs, and the Groningen horse of the Netherlands. But the efforts of Dr. Herta Steiner, Moritzburg State Stud Equerry, were the keystone to saving the breed. She had championed for the last remaining heavy warmbloods in Saxony and Thuringia. Soon the old type was revived.|$|E
25|$|Giovanni died in 1429. According to Lorenzo, {{his fortune}} upon {{his death was}} worth around 180,000 gold florins. His death did not greatly affect the bank's operations, and the {{transition}} to Cosimo went smoothly, aided by Ilarione, who was retained as ministro. Fortunately for the bank, Lorenzo di Giovanni di Bicci de Medici was on excellent terms with Cosimo, and did not insist on dissolving the partnerships so he could receive {{his share of the}} patrimony (primogeniture not being operative here); many Florentine banks and mercantile businesses lasted only <b>a</b> <b>generation</b> <b>or</b> two because some of the inheriting sons usually wished to strike out on their own. At this time, the Medici bank was flourishing: besides the branches in Rome and Florence, the Venetian and Genevan branches had been founded. Ilarione would not last long in his position, and is mentioned as dead in a letter written in February 1433. The timing was unfortunate because the Albizzi government of Florence was moving against the young Medici-led resistance (galvanized by the Albizzi government's failure in a war against Lucca and Milan), culminating in Cosimo's exile to Venice. Despite the unfavorable politics in this period of the bank's history, its Italian branches turned in bumper profits, with as much as 62% of the total coming from Rome (in 1427, the Roman branch of the Medici bank had approximately 100,000 florins on deposit from the Papal Curia; in comparison, the total capitalization of the entire Medici bank was only about 25,000 gold florins) and 13% from Venice between 1420 and 1435 (with the later Medici branches opened in Bruges, London, Pisa, Avignon, Milan, and Lyon contributing nothing as they had not been founded yet). At this time, there seems to have been some sort of Medici office in Basel, and it seems to have lasted until 1443. De Roover speculates that it was a sub-branch of the Medici bank's Geneva branch serving the General Council of the Church, and was closed when the Council no longer made it worth their while to maintain it.|$|E
500|$|In general, {{science in}} {{continental}} philosophy is viewed from a world-historical perspective. [...] One {{of the first}} philosophers who supported this view was Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. Philosophers such as Pierre Duhem and Gaston Bachelard also wrote their works with this world-historical approach to science, predating Kuhn by <b>a</b> <b>generation</b> <b>or</b> more. All of these approaches involve a historical and sociological turn to science, with a priority on lived experience (a kind of Husserlian [...] "life-world"), rather than a progress-based or anti-historical approach as done in the analytic tradition. This emphasis can be traced through Edmund Husserl's phenomenology, the late works of Merleau-Ponty (Nature: Course Notes from the Collège de France, 1956–1960), and Martin Heidegger's hermeneutics.|$|E

500|$|Over {{the course}} of his career in far-right politics, Tyndall became less outspoken on race after his {{prosecution}} under the race relations legislation. In the mid-1970s, Tyndall used Spearhead to claim that [...] "the negro has a smaller brain and a much less complex cerebral structure" [...] than white Europeans. In 1988, Tyndall described his crime as having [...] "dared to publish an honest and frank opinion on the relative merits of Whites and Negroes." [...] Tyndall argued that non-whites were unassimilable to Britain and that those living in Britain should be repatriated. Tyndall strongly objected to interracial relationships and miscegenation and remarked in his book The Eleventh Hour: [...] "I feel deeply sorry for the child of a mixed marriage, but I can have no sympathy whatever for the parents... They produced an offspring that will never wholly fit, and will undoubtedly face a life much harder than the normal person born of pure race." [...] In contrast to his views on non-white migration, he spoke positively of white immigrants from Poland, Hungary, and the Baltic states, regarding them as being racially similar and sharing the [...] "same basic culture" [...] as the British and were thus easily able to assimilate [...] "within <b>a</b> <b>generation</b> <b>or</b> two".|$|E
500|$|Ceawlin is {{the second}} king in Bede's list. [...] All the {{subsequent}} bretwaldas followed more or less consecutively, {{but there is a}} long gap, perhaps fifty years, between Ælle of Sussex, the first bretwalda, and Ceawlin. [...] The lack of gaps between the overlordships of the later bretwaldas has been used to make an argument for Ceawlin's dates matching the later entries in the Chronicle with reasonable accuracy. [...] According to this analysis, the next bretwalda, Æthelberht of Kent, must have been already a dominant king by the time Pope Gregory the Great wrote to him in 601, since Gregory would have not written to an underking. [...] Ceawlin defeated Æthelberht in 568 according to the Chronicle. [...] Æthelberht's dates are a matter of debate, but recent scholarly consensus has his reign starting no earlier than 580. [...] The 568 date for the battle at Wibbandun is thought to be unlikely because of the assertion in various versions of the West Saxon Genealogical Regnal List that Ceawlin's reign lasted either seven or seventeen years. [...] If this battle is placed near the year 590, before Æthelberht has established himself as a powerful king, then the subsequent annals relating to Ceawlin's defeat and death may be reasonably close to the correct date. [...] In any case, the battle with Æthelberht is unlikely to have been more than a few years on either side of 590. [...] The gap between Ælle and Ceawlin, on the other hand, has been taken as supporting evidence for the story told by Gildas in De Excidio of a peace lasting <b>a</b> <b>generation</b> <b>or</b> more following a Briton victory at Mons Badonicus.|$|E

[...] Most often tubas and euphoniums will be combined into a studio taught by one professor, and at small schools they may be grouped with trombones and/or French horns as well, taught by one low brass professor. Universities will usually require professors in this situation to have a high level of proficiency on all the instruments they teach, and some of the best college euphonium studios are taught by non-euphonium players.|$|E
