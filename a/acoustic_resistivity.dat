40|$|Abstract. An {{influence}} of Cd content on the kinetics of a spontaneous low-temperature structure transformation in In-rich In- Cd alloys {{has been investigated}} using <b>acoustic,</b> <b>resistivity</b> and DSC-techniques. It is established that increase of the concentration of Cd leads to an essential increase of a driving force of the transition that results in an increase of the transition rate and in decrease of the relaxation time. The low-temperature instability of <b>acoustic,</b> <b>resistivity</b> and thermal properties is caused presumably by a decomposition of the solid solution that has features of a phase transition of the 1 st order. The main empirical activation parameters of the transformation are derived. The activation energy amounts to U 0 = 0. 43 eV, the attempt period is τ 0 = 5 × 10 - 9 s. The probable border of the decomposition in the phase diagram of the In-Cd system is established...|$|E
40|$|The {{simulation}} workshop CHORALE of the French DGA is used {{by government}} services and industrial companies for weapon system validation and qualification trials in the infrared domain, and detection of moving vehicles in the acoustic domain. Recently, acoustic simulation tests were performed on the 3 D geometrical database of the DGA/DCE/ETBS proving ground. Results have been compared to the acoustic measurements of the NATO-TG 25 trials. This article describes the trials, the modeling of the 3 D geometrical database and the comparison between acoustic simulation results and measurements. The 3 D scene is described {{by a set of}} polygons. Each polygon is characterized by its <b>acoustic</b> <b>resistivity</b> or its complex impedance. Sound sources are associated with moving vehicles and are characterized by their spectra and directivities. A microphone sensor is defined by its position, its frequency band and its directivity. For each trial, atmospheric profiles (air temperature, pressure and humidity according to altitude), trajectories and sound spectrum of moving objects were measured. These data were used to prepare the scenario for the acoustic simulation. 1...|$|E
30|$|Pore {{pressure}} {{within a}} formation {{can be determined}} using data from <b>acoustic</b> and <b>resistivity</b> well logs whereby the sonic transient time and formation resistivity are measured against depth. A formation pore pressure can also be simply calculated from the hydrostatic pressure gradient which shows a linear increase in hydrostatic pressure with depth. However, this {{does not account for}} deviations from the normal trend line or the normal compaction trend due to disparities in rock properties, for instance, in areas of abnormal compaction, porosity and fluid movement. An over-pressure condition can be easily generated in locations of high density and decreased porosity. Whereas the sonic transient time decreases linearly with depth due to reduced porosity, resistivity is shown to increase nonlinearly with depth. This trend was established by Hottmann and Johnson (1965). The divergence of the measured sonic transient time and resistivity from those observed from normal compaction trends in hydrostatic conditions is used as an indicator of the abnormal fluid pressure in the area. This is {{based on the premise that}} deviations from the normal pore pressure in an area are caused by changes in the petrophysical properties such as porosity, density and fluid flow (Azadpour et al. 2015).|$|R
40|$|Abstract: We {{describe}} {{a method of}} thin-bed petrophysical analysis that exploits the availability of both <b>acoustic</b> and <b>resistivity</b> images of the same rock. In developing our method we have gained anumber of insights into the contrasting response of these images to rock properties, which may be of general interest to the imaging community. The case-study we present is from a thin-bedded, eep-water siliciclastic depositional environment. The resistivity image was used to increase the resolution of a conventional resistivity device. Comparison of bedding dips between the two images suggests a resistivity dep hof investiga-tion of around three inches. However, the best fit between image and conventional resistivity was obtained using a somewhat deep-reading <b>resistivity</b> measurement. The <b>acoustic</b> image was used to increase the resolution of our porosity measurement. The best fit to acoustic image amplitude was with the neutron porosity log, rather than with density, slowness, or with any combination of two porosity logs. Given high-resolution resistivity and porosity measurements from the images, and the precise information on bed boundaries that images provide, we proceeded with petrophysical nalysis {{at a much higher}} resolution than obtainable from the conventional logging suite...|$|R
40|$|Compaction of {{cultivated}} soils is a {{major problem}} for agriculture in terms of yield decline and sustainable soil resource management. Tramline wheelings exacerbate runoff and increase erosion from arable land. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) LINK Project - a joint venture between agri-business, land managers and research groups - is currently evaluating a number of methods for alleviating compaction in tractor wheelings across a range of soil types in England. Using innovative applications of agri-geophysics (e. g. GPR, electrical <b>resistivity,</b> <b>acoustics,</b> x-ray tomography), this project aims to determine relationships between geophysical parameters (e. g. soil moisture, porosity), soil compaction and structural morphology. Such relationships are important for a clearer understanding of hydrological and biogeochemical processes in compacted soils, to address land management practices and develop cost-effective mitigation measures. Our poster will present some early results of this study...|$|R
40|$|A new {{empirical}} {{model has been}} developed by the authors to predict the flow <b>resistivity,</b> <b>acoustic</b> impedance and sound absorption coefficient of polyester fibre materials. The parameters of the model have been adjusted to best fit the values of airflow resistivity and sound absorption coefficient measured over a set of 38 samples. Calculated results are compared with normal incidence measurements carried out using two different techniques: the transfer-function method in an impedance tube (ISO 10534 - 2) and the free-field impulse response method (ISO 13472 - 1). Measurements performed on polyester fibre materials with different density and thickness values, and diameter ranging from 18 to 48 lm, are in good agreement with the predictions of the new model. It is concluded that the new model can predict the basic acoustic properties of common polyester fibre materials with any practical combination of thickness and density 2...|$|R
40|$|A {{combination}} of geophysical and hydraulic testing {{was conducted in}} granite near Oracle, Arizona. The purpose {{of the work is}} to determine relationships, if any, among fracture distribution, geophysical, and hydraulic properties of low permeability fractured rock. Neutron, gamma, <b>acoustic</b> velocity, electrical <b>resistivity,</b> and <b>acoustic</b> televiewer logs, and the results of over 100 single-hole straddle-packer injection tests were used to describe the fracture system. The geophysical techniques are sensitive to both subtle variations of the granite and to the fracture network. Fracture densities determined by the acoustic televiewer over hydraulically tested intervals do not correlate with measured hydraulic conductivities for the intervals. However, a strong correlation was noted between the neutron log response and measured hydraulic conductivities and used to estimate hydraulic conductivity in areas that were not hydraulically tested. A map of hydraulic conductivity was also constructed using the geostatistical technique of kriging...|$|R
40|$|Storing CO 2 in deep {{subsurface}} aquifers {{is considered}} to be a good solution for reducing the increasing atmospheric emissions of CO 2. To mitigate the possibility of stored CO 2 leaking out to the atmosphere, geophysical monitoring techniques are applied. These techniques must be able to detect small and big changes in CO 2 saturation. In this thesis <b>acoustic</b> and electrical <b>resistivity</b> measurement will be used to detect and monitor the injection of CO 2 into three brine saturated samples. Two sandstones from the Gres des Vosges formation with different orientation relative to bedding and one Berea sandstone were selected. Each sample is in turn placed in a nitrile sleeve with piezo-elements for acoustic and resistance measurements. A hydrostatic pressure vessel is used to simulate reservoir condition by using pumps to apply an effective pressure of 15 MPa on the sample and 10 MPa pore pressure when saturated. These samples are will undergo several experiment exposing them to different conditions. Each sample undergoes a set series of loading cycles (dry, fully CO 2 and full brine saturated) before drainage and imbibition. In drainage CO 2 is injected from the top and pushed downwards and in imbibition brine is injected from the bottom. Pressure and temperature are assumed constant during drainage and imbibition. For Gres des Vosges (drilled perpendicular to bedding) two additional drainage and imbibition experiments were done to asset flow rate influence on CO 2 injection. Rock physical and pore fluid analysis were used to interpret acoustic velocity and electrical resistivity measurements. Analysis shows CO 2 saturation and front movement are affected by injection flow rate, orientation of beddings, permeability and prior injection experiments. Acoustic velocities in axial direction decreases by 7. 8 %, 7. 4 % and 4. 8 % for respectively Gres des Voges drilled perpendicular to bedding, parallel to bedding and Berea. For saturation of CO 2 passes 20 %, the acoustic velocity has little to no significant changes. Front movement of CO 2 can be seen on both <b>acoustic</b> and <b>resistivity</b> measurement. At high saturation of CO 2 resistivity can be used to estimate saturation. Saturations found for Gres des Voges in axial direction are 60 % for perpendicular to bedding and 49 % for parallel to bedding. An increase in flow rate decreases the saturation of CO 2 shown constant flow rate from start to finish of 2. 5 mL/min results in 57 % while 0. 5 mL/min results in 58 %. Results from Gres des Voges suggest a continuous usage after first drainage and imbibition alters permeability of the sample...|$|R
40|$|Electron-phonon {{coupling}} in graphene is extensively modeled and simulated from first principles. We find that using an accurate {{model for the}} polarizations of the acoustic phonon modes is crucial to obtain correct numerical results. The interactions between electrons and acoustic phonon modes, the gauge field and deformation potential, are calculated at the DFT level {{in the framework of}} linear response. The zero-momentum limit of acoustic phonons is interpreted as a strain pattern, allowing the calculation of the acoustic gauge field parameter in the GW approximation. The role of electronic screening on the electron-phonon matrix elements is investigated. We then solve the Boltzmann equation semi-analytically in graphene, including both acoustic and optical phonon scattering. We show that, in the Bloch-Grüneisen and equipartition regimes, the electronic transport is mainly ruled by the unscreened acoustic gauge field, while the contribution due to the deformation potential is negligible and strongly screened. By comparing with experimental data, we show that the contribution of <b>acoustic</b> phonons to <b>resistivity</b> is doping- and substrate-independent. The DFT+GW approach underestimates this contribution to resistivity by about 30...|$|R
40|$|Interaction between {{electron}} and acoustic phonon in an in-plane {{magnetic field}} induced gapped quantum wire with Rashba spin-orbit interaction is studied. We calculate <b>acoustic</b> phonon limited <b>resistivity</b> (ρ) and phonon-drag thermopower (S_g) due to two well known mechanisms of electron-phonon interaction namely, deformation potential (DP) and piezoelectric (PE) scattering. In {{the so called}} Bloch-Gruneisen temperature limit both ρ and S_g depend on temperature (T) in a power law fashion i. e. ρ or S_g∼ T^ν_T. For resistivity, ν_T takes the value 5 and 3 due to DP and PE scattering respectively. On the other hand, ν_T is 4 and 2 due to DP and PE scattering, respectively for phonon-drag thermopower. Additionally, we find numerically that ν_T depends on Rashba parameter (α) and electron density (n). The dependence of ν_T on α becomes more prominent at lower density. We also study the variations of ρ and S_g with carrier density in the Bloch-Gruneisen regime. Through a numerical analysis a similar power law dependence ρ or S_g∼ n^-ν_n is established in which the effective exponent ν_n undergoes a smooth transition from a low density behavior to a high density behavior. At a higher density regime, ν_n matches excellently with the value obtained from theoretical arguments. Approximate analytical expressions for both resistivity and phonon-drag thermopower in the Bloch-Gruneisen regime are given.

40|$|The {{radioactive}} decay heat from high-level nuclear waste may, {{depending on the}} thermal load, create coupled thermal-mechanical-hydrological-chemical (TMHC) processes in the host rock of a repository. A heated large block test (LBT) is designed to {{understand some of the}} TNMC processes. A block of Topopah Spring tuff of about 3 x 3 x 4. 5 m was isolated at Fran Ridge, Nevada Test Site. Small blocks of the rock adjacent to the large block were collected for laboratory testing of some individual thermal-mechanical, thermal-hydrological, and thermal-chemical processes. The large block will be heated by heaters within so that a dryout zone and a condensate zone will exist simultaneously. Guard heaters on the block sides will be used to minimize horizontal heat losses. A constant load of about 4 MPa will be applied to the top and sides of the large block. The sides will be sealed with moisture and thermal barriers. Temperature, moisture content, pore pressure, chemical composition, stress, displacement, electrical <b>resistivity,</b> <b>acoustic</b> emissions, and acoustic velocities will be measured throughout the block during the heating and cool-down phases. The results from the experiments on small blocks and the tests on the large block will provide a better understanding of some concepts of the coupled TMHC processes.

40|$|We use first-principles calculations, at the density-functional-theory (DFT) and GW levels, {{to study}} both the electron-phonon {{interaction}} for acoustic phonons and the "synthetic" vector potential induced by a strain deformation (responsible for an effective magnetic field {{in case of}} a nonuniform strain). In particular, the interactions between electrons and acoustic phonon modes, the so-called gauge-field and deformation potential, are calculated at the DFT level in the framework of linear response. The zero-momentum limit of acoustic phonons is interpreted as a strain of the crystal unit cell, allowing the calculation of the acoustic gauge-field parameter (synthetic vector potential) within the GW approximation as well. We find that using an accurate model for the polarizations of the acoustic phonon modes is crucial to obtain correct numerical results. Similarly, {{in the presence of a}} strain deformation, the relaxation of atomic internal coordinates cannot be neglected. The role of electronic screening on the electron-phonon matrix elements is carefully investigated. We then solve the Boltzmann equation semianalytically in graphene, including both acoustic and optical phonon scattering. We show that, in the Bloch-Gruneisen and equipartition regimes, the electronic transport is mainly ruled by the unscreened acoustic gauge field, while the contribution due to the deformation potential is negligible and strongly screened. We show that the contribution of <b>acoustic</b> phonons to <b>resistivity</b> is doping and substrate independent, in agreement with experimental observations. The first-principles calculations, even at the GW level, underestimate this contribution to resistivity by approximate to 30 %. At high temperature (T > 270 K), the calculated resistivity underestimates the experimental one more severely, the underestimation being larger at lower doping. We show that, besides remote phonon scattering, a possible explanation for this disagreement is the electron-electron interaction that strongly renormalizes the coupling to intrinsic optical-phonon modes. Finally, after discussing the validity of the Matthiessen rule in graphene, we derive simplified forms of the Boltzmann equation in the presence of impurities and in a restricted range of temperatures. These simplified analytical solutions allow us the extract the coupling to acoustic phonons, related to the strain-induced synthetic vector potential, directly from experimental data...|$|R
40|$|Based on core observations, well {{logs and}} test results of siderite-bearing {{mudstone}} from the Benxi Formation to the Member 2 of the Shanxi Formations in the Linxing block, northeastern Ordos Basin, a logging identification model for siderite-bearing mudstone (key layer) was established. The porosity characteristics and sealing property were quantitatively evaluated by logging data. Sedimentary {{control on the}} formation of multi-superimposed gas-bearing system {{in the development of}} key layers in the sequence framework was also discussed. The results showed that the siderite-bearing mudstone has obvious logging response characteristics, e. g., high photoelectric absorption cross-section index (PE), high density (DEN), high amplitude natural gamma ray (GR), low <b>acoustic</b> (AC), low <b>resistivity</b> (M 2 RX) and low neutron porosity (CNCF). The quantitatively evaluated results of the porosity characteristics and sealing property for the key layer showed that the key layer has the characteristics of low porosity (with an average of 1. 20 percent), low permeability (with an average of 2. 29 × 10 μm), and high breakthrough pressure (with an average of 12. 32 MPa) in the study area. This layer acts as an impermeable gas barrier in a multi-superimposed gas system. The results also indicated that the material composition of the multi-superimposed gas-bearing system can be established by the sequence stratigraphic framework. The sedimentary evolution results in a cyclic rhythm of material composition vertically. The spatial distribution of the corresponding transgressive event layer near the maximum flooding surface (MFS) in the sequence framework restricts the spatial distribution of the key layer with high breakthrough pressure and low porosity, which constitutes the gas-bearing system boundary. The siderite-bearing mudstone formed near the MFS in the second-order sequence and constitutes a stable comparison of the first-order gas-bearing system boundary, which has a wide range of regional distribution and stable thickness. The siderite-bearing mudstone formed near the MFS in the third-order sequence is often incompletely preserved due to the late (underwater) diversion channel erosion and cutting. This layer forms the coal-bearing reservoirs, which we termed as a second-order gas-bearing system in adjacent third-order sequences to form a uniform gas-bearing system...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} few years, {{numerous}} works addressed the deformation processes in carbonate rocks. These studies, generally sponsored by the oil industry, aimed {{to a better understanding}} of the structural and hydraulic properties of fault zones as well as of the subsurface fluid pathways in deformed carbonate rocks. This effort was mainly driven by the economic significance that carbonate rocks have for the oil industry, since they represent important natural reservoirs of hydrocarbons. According to the many field-based research scientific articles published in the recent past, both structural and hydraulic properties of fault zones, and their evolution trough time, exert a first order control on subsurface fluid flow and accumulation in fractured carbonate reservoirs. In order to convert this knowledge into predictive modeling tools that would help to optimize their exploitation, it should be useful to integrate the field-based data together with the subsurface data, which generally consist of core and well log (<b>resistivity,</b> <b>acoustic,</b> gamma ray etc.) analyses usually gathered to assess the formation evaluation of carbonate reservoir. The presented work aims at filling this cognitive gap by the acquisition and elaboration of subsurface geophysical properties of a hydrocarbon-bearing oblique normal fault zone characterized by 10 ’s of m offset, and cropping out in an exposed analogue of fractured carbonate reservoir (Maiella Mountain, Italy). The deformation mechanisms associated to the processes of fault nucleation and development within the Oligo-Miocene shallow-water carbonate rocks were documented in the recent past by our research group. In this present contribution, we present the results of our elaboration of the geophysical data, obtained from well logs oriented perpendicular to the study fault zone. These results are consistent with the following statements: a) there is a meaningful correlations between cores and digital images; b) a detailed structural analysis of the deformed carbonates can be performed by using well cores and digital image data; c) both matrix (primary) and fracture (secondary) porosities can be obtained from subsurface data; d) some possible relationships exist between secondary porosity and the measured log geophysical properties (P- and S-wave velocities, Resistivity). In conclusion, the results of this multi-disciplinary study, which involved the analyses of well logs, core and outcrop data of an hydrocarbon-bearing fault zone permitted us, therefore, to obtain useful correlation between fracture porosity and geophysical properties. We propose some practical solutions to compute the petrophysical parameters in order to assess both primary and secondary porosity in fractured carbonate reservoirs...|$|R
40|$|CO 2 {{storage is}} {{considered}} {{as one of the}} most promising solutions to overcome global increase in temperature. In order to ensure the safety of the sequestrated CO 2, several geophysical monitoring methods are required, among them electrical resistivity and seismic velocity which depends on porosity, texture, mineralogy and fluid saturation. However, seismic data seldom allow us to estimate saturation accurately in geological reservoirs. On the other hand, resistivity is very sensitive to porosity and help to calculate fluid saturation. A combined use of both electrical resistivity and seismic velocity enables two complementary measurements: Seismic velocity measurement, which has better resolution efficiency in fluid mapping in geological reservoirs compared to electrical resistivity while the latter has a better precision in terms of quantifying relative saturation levels of immiscible fluids. The main challenge is to combine these two data sources to monitor CO 2 storage where water saturation varies due to CO 2 injection. Using an advanced experimental setup, a series of laboratory experiments have been carried out to monitor P-wave velocity and resistivity simultaneously in selected porous sandstones during liquid CO 2 injection. The sandstones studied are medium to fine grained Red Wildmoor (RW) and medium grained Berea. For the Red Wildmoor, two core plugs: one drilled perpendicular and the other drilled parallel to the layering were used. There experiments were conducted by simulating the reservoir conditions at depth of about 1000 m. A constant pore pressure of 10 MPa and confining pressure of 25 MPa were maintained throughout the flooding of liquid CO 2. Prior to CO 2 flooding, the sandstone core plugs were saturated with CO 2 and brine. Multidirectional <b>acoustic</b> velocity and <b>resistivity</b> measurements were then taken during drainage and imbibition processes. The laboratory results were compared with Gassmann s model based on CO 2 saturation estimated by Resistivity Index (RI) assuming that the samples were brine saturated prior to CO 2 injection. The results show that resistivity increased throughout the injection process and the P-wave velocity decreased drastically after the start of CO 2 injection. It is observed that the layering of core plugs influenced the fluid distribution pattern and saturation level. The observed velocities are in good agreement with predicted velocities using the Gassmann Fluid Substitution Model with the exception of the Berea sandstone. By comparing the velocity- saturation relation estimated by Gassmann and RI models, P-wave velocities becomes less sensitive after injecting 2 PV CO 2 for vertical Red Wildmoor, 1 PV for horizontal Red Wildmoor and 0. 4 PV for Berea while resistivity kept increasing with increase in CO 2 saturation. The study shows that electrical resistivity measurements can efficiently track the development of CO 2 front during injection and effectively complement the difficulty of P- wave velocity on quantifying the stored CO 2...|$|R
40|$|In low permeability, {{tight gas}} {{sandstone}} reservoirs, {{an understanding of}} fracture systems is important in hydrocarbon exploration and production, because fracture networks affect the fluid flow properties in such reservoirs. Rocks can deform either in a ductile or brittle way depending on the rock mechanical properties and the stress condition. To better understand the fluid flow characteristics of a fault system within a reservoir, {{the knowledge of the}} mechanical properties and the stress condition of the reservoir and the geometry of the fracture networks, both in seismic-scale and micro-scale, is important. This thesis presents a multidisciplinary and multi-scale analysis of the rock mechanical properties in sandstones relevant to tight reservoirs. Fractures and the geometry of fault damage zones were studied in two normal faults in Moab, Utah. The Courthouse Junction fault, which is a branch of the Moab Fault (with a throw of about 80 m) is characterised by cataclastic deformation bands and slip planes and minor fluid-flow alteration. In the cataclastic bands, grain and pore sizes range from about 1 to 0. 1 µm in diameter, about two orders of magnitude smaller than those of the host rock; so significantly reducing the permeability of this fault zone. The other fault is located at the Klondike Bluffs area (the maximum throw of about 10 m) which is characterised by minor cataclasis, strong diagenesis and dislocation or disaggregation deformation bands. In the deformation bands, the grains are not crushed and the average pore size is nearly double, which increases the permeability within the fractures. As a result of past fluid flow, calcite now fully fills the fractures, so rendering them as impermeable barriers. In general, the fracture density decreases logarithmically outwards from the fault core; however, irregularities tend to often disrupt this tendency. Peaks, i. e. increases in deformation band density, are not always related to faults. The orientations of the deformation bands are sub-parallel and their dip varies between 70 ° and 90 °. The width of the damage zone in the footwall at Klondike Bluffs is about 150 m and at the Courthouse Junction this varies from 200 to > 300 m. In the hanging wall at Klondike Bluffs, the damage zone ranges from 180 to 300 m. Along the faults, the width and the deformation band distribution change significantly; the range of dip and dip-direction varies moderately, while the fracture characteristics remain constant. The microstructure of fractures in North Sea Rotliegend Sandstone core samples and in the Moab field samples was analysed. The results show that the characteristics of the fractures and the host rocks of both the field study samples and the North Sea core samples are similar. In conclusion, the Moab sandstones may provide a good analogue to that of these North Sea sandstones. The second aim {{of the study was to}} analyse the relationship between the rock mechanical properties, log properties and the brittleness of rocks. The relationship between unconfined compressive strength (UCS), Young’s modulus and wireline well logs (i. e. <b>acoustic</b> velocity, density, <b>resistivity,</b> natural gamma-ray, spectral gamma-ray and neutron-porosity) was studied in North Sea Lower Germanic Triassic Sandstone (depths range 2700 to 4050 m) and Rotliegend Sandstone (depths range 3900 to 4900 m). A multivariate regression method was used to calculate the empirical correlation equations. In the Triassic sandstone, acoustic velocity has a much weaker dependence on velocity than it has in the Rotliegend sandstone. Multivariate regressions using more prediction variables provided better-fit correlation equations. A significant increase was observed in the goodness of regression using spectral gamma logs. The highest squared regression coefficient was attained as a result of a UCS-log multivariate regression for Rotliegend samples: R² = 0. 84 using spectral gamma logs, and for Triassic samples R² = 0. 55 when using a cumulative gamma log (due to the unavailability of spectral gamma logs). This same tendency was found in the results of regressions made for Young’s moduli and log properties. Strong dependency was exhibited between UCS and Young’s moduli (R² = 0. 9) in the Rotliegend samples; however, dependency was much lower in the Triassic samples (R² = 0. 46). Based on the brittleness index approach of Ingram and Urai (1999) and Hoogerduijn-Strating and Urai (2003), a new brittleness index equation has been developed in which stress conditions and UCS are considered. The derived UCS-log correlation equations were used to calculate brittleness logs in the wells from where the rock samples originate. By applying the calculated BRI logs to characterise the brittle, less brittle and ductile formations or intervals of North Sea sandstones were identified and provided good examples for the application of this BRI concept. The results of my work can provide a better understanding of the properties of faults and fractures, together with hydrocarbon migration through tight sandstone reservoirs, and may be applied to improve the seismic interpretation of faults...|$|R
