While in the hospital Peter realizes that Mr. Pewterschmidt and Dr. Hartman have a similar voice, then Mr. Pewterschmidt comes into the room and they both start talking about how their voices sound alike; this is a reference to the show's creator Seth MacFarlane as he voices both characters.|$|E
5|$|The {{leadership}} of the ACLU does not always agree on policy decisions; differences of opinion within the ACLU leadership have sometimes grown into major debates.

In 1939, a heated debate took place over whether to prohibit communists from serving in ACLU leadership roles. During the early 1950s and Cold War McCarthyism, the board was divided on whether to defend communists. In 1968, a schism formed over whether to represent Dr. Benjamin Spock's anti-war activism. In 1973, there was internal conflict over whether to call for the impeachment of Richard Nixon.

5|$|As Attorney General, Dosanjh {{oversaw the}} {{resolution}} of the Gustafsen Lake Standoff involving the Secwepemc Nation, set up a database for registering violent offenders, established a hate crime division in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and lobbied for more police officers, probation officers, and judiciary. At the same time his office drew criticism for reducing legal aid and closing courthouses. As the Minister Responsible for Multiculturalism, Human Rights and Immigration he successfully lobbied for laws giving same-sex couples the equal rights and responsibilities for child support, custody and access. In early 1999, a special prosecutor under the RCMP opened an investigation into possible influence peddling by Premier Glen Clark concerning casino licensing.

5|$|The attacks simmered {{down after}} mid-February {{due to the}} arrest and {{imposition}} of <b>a</b> <b>gag</b> order on Raj. Isolated cases of attacks, however, were reported until April 2008.
