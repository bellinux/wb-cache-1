40|$|Practical {{applications}} of smart structure technology to <b>active</b> acoustic <b>noise</b> control demand high performance at low cost. Typically, performance increases achieved by reducing control system latency are expensive. Furthermore, sonar echo cancellation {{is concerned with}} a wide frequency range for which linear time-invariant (LTI) controllers provide inadequate performance, and no direct error measurement is available to drive adaptive controllers. Real-time estimators of the cancellation error have been proposed to enable the use of adaptive controllers, however this significantly increases the system cost. In this paper, we introduce a frequency scheduled control architecture for echo cancellation which achieves adaptive control performance at LTI control prices, by exploiting the narrow instantaneous bandwidth commonly associated with individual sonar pings.

It has been demonstrated that both tonal noise and broadband noise (difference can refer to tonal versus broadband) can be actively attenuated by a carefully designed plasma actuator.|$|R

For example, atmospheric pressure fluctuations generate a gravity-noise foreground in measurements with super-conducting gravimeters. Gravity changes caused by high-magnitude earthquakes {{have been detected}} with the satellite gravity experiment GRACE, and we expect high-frequency terrestrial gravity fluctuations produced by ambient seismic fields to limit the sensitivity of ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) detectors. Accordingly, terrestrial gravity fluctuations are considered noise and signal depending on the experiment. Here, we will focus on ground-based gravimetry. This field is rapidly progressing {{through the development of}} GW detectors. The technology is pushed to its current limits in the advanced generation of the LIGO and Virgo detectors, targeting gravity strain sensitivities better than 10 ^– 23 Hz^– 1 / 2 above a few tens of a Hz. Alternative designs for GW detectors evolving from traditional gravity gradiometers such as torsion bars, atom interferometers, and superconducting gradiometers are currently being developed to extend the detection band to frequencies below 1 Hz.
