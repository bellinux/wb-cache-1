40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to describe the development of a remote sensing airborne <b>air</b> <b>sampling</b> system for Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and provide the capability for the detection of particle and gas concentrations in real time over remote locations. The design of the <b>air</b> <b>sampling</b> methodology started by defining system architecture, and then by selecting and integrating each subsystem. A multifunctional <b>air</b> <b>sampling</b> instrument, with capability for simultaneous measurement of particle and gas concentrations was modified and integrated with ARCAA’s Flamingo UAS platform and communications protocols. As result of the integration process, a system capable of both real time geo-location monitoring and indexed-link sampling was obtained. Wind tunnel tests were conducted in order to evaluate the performance of the <b>air</b> <b>sampling</b> instrument in controlled non-stationary conditions at the typical operational velocities of the UAS platform. Once the remote fully operative <b>air</b> <b>sampling</b> system was obtained, the problem of mission design was analyzed through the simulation of different scenarios. Furthermore, flight tests of the complete <b>air</b> <b>sampling</b> system were then conducted to check the dynamic characteristics of the UAS with the <b>air</b> <b>sampling</b> system and to prove its capability to perform an <b>air</b> <b>sampling</b> mission following a specific flight path. ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{atmosphere}} of the Earth serves as {{a key factor in}} sustaining the planetary ecosystem. The thin layer of gases that envelops the Earth is held in place by the planet's gravity. Dry air consists of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, 1% argon and other inert gases, such as carbon dioxide. The remaining gases are often referred to as trace gases, among which are the greenhouse gases such as water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone. Filtered air includes trace amounts of many other chemical compounds. Air also contains a variable amount of water vapor and suspensions of water droplets and ice crystals seen as clouds. Many natural substances may be present in tiny amounts in an unfiltered <b>air</b> <b>sample,</b> including dust, pollen and spores, sea spray, volcanic ash, and meteoroids.

2500|$|The {{activated}} NO2 luminesces broadband {{visible to}} infrared light as it reverts {{to a lower}} energy state. A photomultiplier and associated electronics counts the photons that are proportional {{to the amount of}} NO present. To determine the amount of nitrogen dioxide, NO2, in a sample (containing no NO) it must first be converted to nitric oxide, NO, by passing the sample through a converter before the above ozone activation reaction is applied. The ozone reaction produces a photon count proportional to NO that is proportional to NO2 before it was converted to NO. In the case of a mixed sample that contains both NO and NO2, the above reaction yields the amount of NO and NO2 combined in the <b>air</b> <b>sample,</b> assuming that the sample is passed through the converter. If the mixed sample is not passed through the converter, the ozone reaction produces activated NO2 only in proportion to the NO in the sample. [...] The NO2 in the sample is not activated by the ozone reaction. Though unactivated NO2 is present with the activated NO2, photons are emitted only by the activated species that is proportional to original NO. Final step: Subtract NO from (NO + NO2) to yield NO2 ...|$|E

5000|$|The ozone {{molecule}} absorbs ultraviolet radiation, {{and most}} ozone monitors utilized in regulatory applications use ultraviolet absorption to accurately quantify ozone levels.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} role of fungi in the {{production}} of sick building syndrome. METHODS: A 22 month study in the United States of 48 schools (in which there had been concerns about health and indoor air quality (IAQ). Building indoor <b>air</b> and surface <b>samples,</b> as well as outdoor <b>air</b> <b>samples</b> were taken at all sites to look for the presence of fungi or their viable propagules. RESULTS: Five fungal genera were consistently found in the outdoor air and comprised over 95 % of the outdoor fungi. These genera were Cladosporium (81. 5 %), Penicillium (5. 2 %), Chrysosporium (4. 9 %), Alternaria (2. 8 %), and Aspergillus (1. 1 %). At 20 schools, there were significantly more colony forming units per cubic metre (CFU/m 3) (p < 0. 0001) of propagules of Penicillium species in the <b>air</b> <b>samples</b> from complaint areas when compared with the outdoor <b>air</b> <b>samples</b> and the indoor <b>air</b> <b>samples</b> from noncomplaint areas.

In the remaining 11 schools, the fungal ratios and CFU/m 3 of air were not significantly different in different areas.
