40|$|It is {{important}} to properly segregate the different components present in the destination postal address under different labels namely addressee name, house number, street number, extension/area name, destination town name and the like for automatic address reading.

This paper presents a fuzzy symbolic inference system for postal mail <b>address</b> <b>component</b> extraction and labelling. The work uses a symbolic representation for postal addresses and a symbolic knowledge base for postal <b>address</b> <b>component</b> labelling. A symbolic similarity measure treated as a fuzzy membership function is devised and is used for finding the distance of the extracted component to a probable label.

40|$|Mapping of {{postal address}} to a mail {{delivery}} {{point is a}} very important task that affects the efficiency of postal service. This task is very complex in the countries such as India, where postal addresses are not structured. Further most of the times the destination addresses in such countries are incomplete, approximate and erroneous which adds to the complexity of mapping postal address to delivery point. Automation of this aspect of the postal service is a challenge. This paper presents a soft computing model to map the postal address to mail delivery point. Firstly machine readable postal address is processed to identify the address components using a novel fuzzy symbolic similarity analysis, and further these labeled components are organized as a symbolic postal address object. This postal address object is further processed using the newly devised fuzzy symbolic methodology for mapping the address to mail delivery point. Symbolic knowledge bases for postal <b>address</b> <b>component</b> labeling and mail delivery point mapping are devised. Fuzzy symbolic similarity measures are formulated once for <b>address</b> <b>component</b> labeling and the second time for mapping the entire address to a mail delivery point. In sequel to similarity computations, which are viewed as fuzzy membership values, an expert system comprising of alpha-cut de-fuzzification is proposed to evaluate the confidence factors, while inferencing the validity of <b>address</b> <b>component</b> labels and mail delivery points. The system is tested exhaustively and an efficiency of 94 % is obtained in <b>address</b> <b>component</b> identification and about 86 % in mail delivery point mapping, while working on an Indian postal data base of about 500 addresses.

The Preschool Behavioral and Emotional Rating Scales (PreBERS) is a normative {{assessment of}} emotional and behavioral strengths in preschool children. The PreBERS has well-established reliability and validity for typically developing {{children as well as}} children with identified special education needs, but this has not yet been established for children in Head Start programs, who tend to be at high risk for development of emotional and behavioral concerns. This study explores the factorial validity of the PreBERS scores for a large sample of children participating in Head Start programs around the United States. Results not only confirm the fit of the four-factor model of the PreBERS for this population, but also demonstrate the application of a bifactor model to the structure of the PreBERS which, in turn, allows for the computation of model-based reliability estimates for the four subscales (Emotional Regulation, School Readiness, Social Confidence, Family Involvement) and overall strength index score. The implications suggest that the PreBERS items are reliable scores {{that can be used to}} identify behavioral strengths in preschool children in Head Start, and support planning of interventions to selectively <b>address</b> <b>component</b> skills to promote child social and academic success...|$|E

40|$|Component-based {{information}} systems development {{is an area}} of research and practice of increasing importance. Information Systems developers have realised that traditional approaches to IS engineering produce monolithic, difficult to maintain, difficult to reuse systems. In contrast, the use of software components, which embody data, functionality and well-specified and understood interfaces, makes interoperable, distributed and highly reusable IS components feasible. Component-based approaches to IS engineering can be used at strategic and organisational levels, to model business processes and whole IS architectures, in development methods which utilise component-based models during analysis and design, and in system implementation. Reusable components can allow end users to compose and configure their own Information Systems, possibly from a range of suppliers, and to more tightly couple their organisational workflows with their IS support. This workshop proceedings contains a range of papers addressing {{one or more of the}} above issues relating to the use of component models for IS development. All of these papers were refereed by at least two members of an international workshop committee comprising industry and academic researchers and users of component technologies.

40|$|Our study {{supports}} the versatility of the imidazoline ring (message component) in evoking different biological responses {{depending on the}} particular kind of substituent inserted in position 2 (<b>address</b> <b>component)</b> (Schwyzer, R. ACTH: a Short Introductory Review. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci., 1977, 247, 3 - 26). In fact, using imidazoline nucleus as a universal template, we have obtained new compounds able to interact with: 1) α 2 -Adrenoreceptors (α 2 -ARs); 2) I 1 -Imidazoline Binding Sites (I 1 BS or I 1 Rs); 3) Muscarinic Receptors (mAChRs). 1) The α 2 -ARs are a heterogeneous class and three distinc subtypes (α 2 A, α 2 B, α 2 C), that are encoded by different genes, have been characterized in different species. The attribution of physiological functions to a given α 2 -AR subtype has been of great difficulty in vivo, {{due to the lack}} of sufficiently subtype-selective pharmacological tools and the functional role of α 2 C-AR still remains enigmatic. Therefore, with the aim to improve both potency and α 2 -AR subtype selectivity, a series of derivatives structurally related to potent α 2 A and α 2 C agonist biphenyline (3), has been prepared and studied. The results obtained, show that the presence of a correctly oriented function with positive electronic effect (+σ) in portion X of the ligands (Chart 2) is an important factor for a significant α 2 C-subtype selectivity. The dipole originated by functions, such as pyridine nitrogen in position 3 of (5) and –OH, –NO 2 and -F, in the meta position (13, 16, and 19), allowing the formation of a hydrogen bond with a corresponding receptor site is responsible for efficient and selective activation of α 2 C-AR subtype. Homology modeling and docking studies undertaken with 5, support the experimental data and highlight this bond between the pyridine nitrogen in position 3 of 5 and the –NH indole ring of Trp 6. 48, which is favorably oriented in the α 2 C-AR subtype only. 2) Imidazoline binding sites (IBs) also represent a heterogeneous class and, at present, they appear to be divided into I 1 -, I 2 -, and I 3 -subtypes. Pharmacological studies suggest that I 1 IBs are primarly involved in the regulation of cardiovascular functions. The fact that several classes of substances, including those bearing an imidazoline ring, interact with α 2 -ARs and I 1 -IBs suggests that both receptor systems may present analogies in the orientation of critical binding functions. Inspired by this hypothesis, we have designed the modulation of the I 1 -ligand biological profile from antagonist to agonist, according to what has been observed for the α 2 -AR system. Therefore, a phenyl group has been inserted in the ortho position of the aromatic ring of the I 1 -selective antagonist 3 in order to obtain a new I 1 -agonist, 4, potentially useful in the treatment of hypertension. The new compound 4, showing good affinity and selectivity for I 1 -IBs, injected intracisternally in anaesthetized normotensive rats, decreased mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate significantly in a dose dependent manner. Chirality proves to be crucial for activation of the I 1 -IBs since the hypotensive and bradicardic effects shown by the racemate 4 have been produced exclusively by the (S) -(+) - 4 form. The enantiomer (R) -(-) - 4 was devoid of emodynamic action. 3) Finally concerning the study of mAChRs (M 1 -M 5) we have prepared new antagonists bearing the diphenylmethane function variously spaced from the imidazoline ring. The preliminary results are encouraging and show that the potency and the M 1 -M 5 subtype selectivity is critically influenced by the carbon chain lenght...|$|E

Our method uses diverse pat tern recognition and image processing algorithms (t hresholding, underline removal. separation of lines, location and recognition of <b>address</b> <b>components,</b> and Postal directory access) to determine the DPC. Three separate encoding techniques are used, each accessing a separate USPS database. There are three methods of determining the DPC: (i) the ZIP code recognized {{happens to be a}} unique ZIP Code. In such cases, the 5 -digit ZIP Code itself is the DPC; (ii) the address has a P. O. Box number. In such cases, the ZIP Code and the P. O.

In such cases, the ZIP Code and the street number confine the possible street names to a small set using a USPS directory. The word recognition algorithm is invoked to find which of the street names in the set matches the street name image in the address. The selected street name has a 4 digit add-on which can be obtained from the Postal directory.
