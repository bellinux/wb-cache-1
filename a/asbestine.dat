50|$|<b>Asbestine</b> is {{a mineral}} {{compound}} composed of nearly pure fibrous magnesium silicate, with physical characteristics between those of asbestos and talc. It {{is used in}} paper manufacture and construction.|$|E
50|$|Trace amounts can {{be found}} in talc, which often {{contains}} asbestos fibers of various types. Studies into health risks associated with talc determined that with so many commercial varieties of talc being types of <b>asbestine</b> minerals, the resultant lung diseaseâ€”talcosis, which can follow their prolonged inhalation, is usually a variety of asbestosis.|$|E
