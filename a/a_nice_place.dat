500|$|... 1602, Nick Lowe and Joe Quesada, {{approached}} Gaiman after Quesada became Marvel's Editor in Chief {{with the}} intent for Gaiman {{to work on a}} project for Marvel. Gaiman eventually agreed to write a Marvel comic in August 2001, although he was not sure what it would contain. When the September 11, 2001 attacks occurred, Gaiman decided {{that he did not want}} planes, skyscrapers, bombs or guns in his comic. [...] "I didn't want it to be a war story, and I didn't want to write a story in which might made right – or in which might made anything." [...] On a trip to Venice soon after, Gaiman was struck by how the [...] "past seemed very close at hand"; he returned from the trip knowing the story he wanted to tell. The time was chosen because [...] "it was <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> <b>place</b> to set the story. It gave me America and it gave me a lot of things that I wanted in terms of the way the world was changing. It also gave me the sense of wonder and magic." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} devised {{following}} a lecture given by writer Mike Bullen {{and executive producer}} Andy Harries at the Screen Producers Association of Australia conference in November 2000. Bullen and Harries already knew that actress Fay Ripley {{did not want to}} renew her contract to play Jenny Gifford for the whole fourth series, so developed a storyline where Jenny's ex-husband Pete would meet and fall in love with an Australian woman after his divorce. The storyline would culminate in an episode set in Australia, which Harries wanted [...] "for no desperately good reason except that it's <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> <b>place</b> to go". The storyline was plotted and Kimberley Joseph was cast as Jo Ellison, who makes her first appearance in Series 4, Episode 1. As originally planned, the fourth series would have depicted all of the main characters permanently emigrating to Australia; Bullen said, [...] "One of them , whose relationship is no more, meets an Australian in England and he comes out here, and the notion is that the others follow. Then one of the others would have a reason for wanting to walk away from his life so he comes out here too. That's really an excuse to bring everyone out, and the final episode would be a 90-minute special looking back on their lives up to that point; because it would be the last episode with these characters." [...] Having the characters permanently based in Australia opened up the possibility of spin-off series set in the country. The direction of the fourth series, and thus the finale, changed significantly when Helen Baxendale announced that she was pregnant.|$|E

The patch worn on the left sleeve according to uniform wear in the Army is the current assignment of the person wearing it and in the episode <b>A</b> <b>Nice</b> <b>Place</b> to Visit shows that the team was assigned to the Special Forces with a tab Airborne over the shoulder patch.

[...] and [...] "Dwight, as played by the 41-year-old Wilson, has become one of the breakout characters in television comedy.

Oh, only the ten million-plus people who watched as you pepper sprayed the living daylights out of Roy for trying to pop Jim in the face last night. My God, have I missed you, man.

2500|$|Vices & Virtues has {{received}} mixed to positive reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album {{has received}} an average score of 62 out of 100, which indicates [...] "generally favourable reviews" [...] based on 15 reviews. Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post called the record [...] "one of 2011's {{best and most}} captivating albums," [...] calling [...] "Sarah Smiles" [...] the [...] "stand-out" [...] and noting the wise change in tone to high-energy with the second track, [...] "Let's Kill Tonight". Alternative Press also welcomed the new version of Panic! at the Disco. [...] "Perhaps Smith and Urie's biggest success on Vices is their disinterest in simply recreating either of their previous albums, instead choosing to meld the youthful exuberance of their debut with the restraint and maturity of 2008's Pretty. Odd.," [...] wrote critic Evan Lucy. [...] "The duo sound absolutely recharged, likely {{a result of the}} lineup shuffling, but also perhaps a realization that the '70s were <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> <b>place</b> to visit for a couple years, but life in the 21st century is much more fun." [...] He went on to praise the [...] "Elfman-esque string arrangements, creepy undertones and twinkling pianos" [...] on several tracks and enjoy the [...] "scaled-back," [...] more personal tracks, such as [...] "The Calendar" [...] and [...] "Memories". James Montgomery of MTV News said of the album, [...] "Vices is at its very core a studio album, one stuffed with ideas and instrumentation, which not only positions Panic! as perhaps this generation's Brian-Wilsons-on-a-budget, but serves as a solid starting point for wherever Urie and Smith choose to go from here." [...] He complimented the new sound of the band: [...] "It's not exactly new, not exactly old, but it's definitely something. Call it a fresh start, a return to form, a re-imaging of the past, just don't call it Pretty. Odd. because that ship has sailed. Panic! are back to their old tricks, exclamation point and all ... and perhaps that was the secret ingredient all along." ...|$|E
