25|$|In heating mode, {{the outdoor}} coil is an evaporator, while the indoor is a condenser. The {{refrigerant}} {{flowing from the}} evaporator (outdoor coil) carries the thermal energy from outside air (or soil) indoors. Vapor temperature is augmented within the pump by compressing it. The indoor coil then transfers thermal energy (including energy from the compression) to the indoor air, which is then moved around {{the inside of the}} building by an <b>air</b> <b>handler.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{duct system}} often begins at an <b>air</b> <b>handler.</b> The blowers in the <b>air</b> <b>handler</b> can create {{substantial}} vibration, {{and the large}} area of the duct system would transmit this noise and vibration to {{the inhabitants of the}} building. To avoid this, vibration isolators (flexible sections) are normally inserted into the duct immediately before and after the <b>air</b> <b>handler.</b> The rubberized canvas-like material of these sections allows the <b>air</b> <b>handler</b> to vibrate without transmitting much vibration to the attached ducts. The same flexible section can reduce the noise that can occur when the blower engages and positive air pressure is introduced to the ductwork.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Air</b> <b>handlers</b> {{typically}} {{employ a}} large squirrel cage blower {{driven by an}} AC induction electric motor to move the air. The blower may operate at a single speed, {{offer a variety of}} set speeds, or be driven by a Variable Frequency Drive to allow a wide range of air flow rates. Flow rate may also be controlled by inlet vanes or outlet dampers on the fan. Some residential <b>air</b> <b>handlers</b> in USA (central [...] "furnaces" [...] or [...] "air conditioners") use a brushless DC electric motor that has variable speed capabilities. [...] <b>Air</b> <b>handlers</b> in Europe and Australia and New Zealand now commonly use backward curve fans without scroll or [...] "plug fans".

40|$|A recent {{experience}} at ZBA in industrial energy conservation was investigating the energy savings potential of modifications to existing <b>air</b> <b>handlers</b> {{and to a}} central chilled water plant. Major system changes and new energy saving equipment require high cost to realize savings. This type of initial study is critical to assure that projected savings can be realized. The following examples are from an electronics manufacturing facility. Over 140 <b>air</b> <b>handlers</b> serving offices, laboratories and clean room manufacturing areas were investigated.

50|$|An <b>air</b> <b>handler,</b> or air {{handling}} unit (often abbreviated to AHU), is a device used to regulate and circulate air {{as part of a}} heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) system. An <b>air</b> <b>handler</b> is usually a large metal box containing a blower, heating or cooling elements, filter racks or chambers, sound attenuators, and dampers. Air handlers usually connect to a ductwork ventilation system that distributes the conditioned air through the building and returns it to the AHU. Sometimes AHUs discharge (supply) and admit (return) air directly to and from the space served without ductwork.|$|E
50|$|The air blower's {{flow rate}} is variable. For a single VAV <b>air</b> <b>handler</b> that serves {{multiple}} thermal zones, the flow rate to each zone must be varied as well.|$|E

50|$|Where {{supply and}} extract air is {{required}} in equal proportions for a balanced ventilation system, {{it is common for}} the supply and extract <b>air</b> <b>handlers</b> to be joined together, either in a side-by-side or a stacked configuration.|$|R
50|$|Very {{large scale}} {{systems can be}} built using the two-pipe principle. For example, rather than heating {{individual}} radiators, the water {{may be used in}} the reheat coils of large <b>air</b> <b>handlers</b> to heat an entire floor of a building.|$|R
40|$|Although it’s known {{theoretically}} that cleaning a coil {{can result}} in energy savings, little actual testing data and research exist to prove the point. As a result, building managers often ignore or reduce resources devoted to air-handler maintenance when faced with budget constraints. If proper maintenance is an important con-sideration in overall energy costs, conserving in that budget area can be self defeating. Through our privately funded testing, monitoring and analysis, we believe we found a methodology and regimen that proves maintaining air-handler compo-nents in a clean condition can save energy dollars and improve other building pa-rameter changes and efficiencies such as improved dehumidification and comfort, along with less mold and bacteria. Thus, we are encouraging IAQ environmental parameter improvements, better tenant satisfaction, and increased worker ef-fectiveness. It {{is difficult to find}} a building where such a study can be held. Fortunately, the owner and managers of a landmark 34 -floor building on Times Square in New York City wanted to see what impact a dramatic change in coil cleaning nature and frequency might have. This building has only four large <b>air</b> <b>handlers</b> (SF- 6, SF- 7, SF- 8, SF- 9; 250 [880 kW], 123 [433 kW], 121 [425 kW] and 81 tons [285 kW], respectively) to service its 1. 2 million ft 2 (111 500 m 2) of air-conditioned and heated space throughout the year. The test project was performed at the building July through September 2005 to monitor and analyze the HVAC energy use before and after restoration of two <b>air</b> <b>handlers,</b> SF- 8 (121 tons [425 kW]) and SF- 9 (81 tons [285 kW]), which are similar in their constant volume operation to the other two <b>air</b> <b>handlers</b> in the building, and are located on the 34 th floor mechanical room. This total of four <b>air</b> <b>handlers</b> interact by providing heating and cooling to the tenants of the 34 floors of the building. Periodi...|$|R
50|$|Regardless of who {{provides}} it, the chilled water (between 4° and 7°C (39-44 °F)) is pumped through an <b>air</b> <b>handler,</b> which captures {{the heat from}} the air, then disperses the air throughout the area to be cooled.|$|E
50|$|A heat {{exchanger}} (hydronic coil) {{is placed in}} the <b>air</b> <b>handler</b> similar to the refrigerant coil in a Heat Pump system or a Central AC. Copper is often specified in supply and return manifolds and in tube coils.|$|E

50|$|<b>Air</b> <b>handlers</b> {{may need}} to provide heating, cooling, or both to change the supply air temperature, and {{humidity}} level depending on the location and the application. Such conditioning is provided by heat exchanger coil(s) within the air handling unit air stream, such coils may be direct or indirect {{in relation to the}} medium providing the heating or cooling effect.|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{demonstration}} was to show how sensors in IT equipment could be accessed and used to directly control computer room air conditioning. The data provided from the sensors {{is available on the}} IT network and the challenge for this project was to connect this information to the computer room <b>air</b> <b>handler's</b> control system. A control strategy was developed to enable separate control of the chilled water flow and the fans in the computer room <b>air</b> <b>handlers.</b> By using these existing sensors in the IT equipment, an additional control system is eliminated (or could be redundant) and optimal cooling can be provided saving significant energy. Using onboard server temperature sensors will yield significant energy reductions in data centers. Intel hosted the demonstration in its Santa Clara, CA data center. Intel collaborated with IBM, HP, Emerson, Wunderlich-Malec Engineers, FieldServer Technologies, and LBNL to install the necessary components and develop the new control scheme.

50|$|In {{buildings}} with HVAC <b>air</b> <b>handlers</b> that admit outside air for ventilation, plumbing vents placed too closely to air intakes or windows {{can be a}} source of sewer gas odors. In some cases airflow around buildings and wind effects may contribute to sewer gas odor problems even with appropriately separated vents and air intakes. Increasing vent heights, adding vent pipe filters, or providing powered dilution and exhaust can help reduce occurrences.|$|R
50|$|Controls are {{necessary}} to regulate every aspect of an <b>air</b> <b>handler,</b> such as: flow rate of air, supply air temperature, mixed air temperature, humidity, air quality. They may {{be as simple as}} an off/on thermostat or as complex as a building automation system using BACnet or LonWorks, for example.|$|E
50|$|Mechanical, or forced, {{ventilation}} {{is provided}} by an <b>air</b> <b>handler</b> (AHU) and used to control indoor air quality. Excess humidity, odors, and contaminants can often be controlled via dilution or replacement with outside air. However, in humid climates more energy is required to remove excess moisture from ventilation air.|$|E
50|$|The {{equipment}} that regulates the airflow {{is called a}} damper. The damper {{can be used to}} increase, decrease or completely stop the flow of air. A more complex device that can not only regulate the airflow but also has the ability to create an airflow is an <b>air</b> <b>handler.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} indoor <b>air</b> quality, <b>air</b> <b>handlers</b> commonly have provisions to allow the introduction of outside air into, and the exhausting of air from the building. In temperate climates, mixing {{the right amount of}} cooler outside air with warmer return air can be used to approach the desired supply air temperature. A mixing chamber is therefore used which has dampers controlling the ratio between the return, outside, and exhaust air.|$|R
50|$|Most <b>air</b> <b>handlers</b> mix {{return and}} outside air so less temperature/humidity {{conditioning}} is needed. This {{can save money}} by using less chilled or heated water (not all AHUs use chilled or hot water circuits). Some external air is {{needed to keep the}} building's air healthy. To optimize energy efficiency while maintaining healthy indoor air quality (IAQ), demand control (or controlled) ventilation (DCV) adjusts the amount of outside air based on measured levels of occupancy.|$|R
