40|$|Practical {{implementations}} of activity-based {{travel demand}} models normally apply a disaggregate process to individual households and persons, generating their activity demands and other decisions leading ultimately {{to a list}} of individual trips. This enables heterogeneous choice behavior, finer spatial detail than zones (TAZs), deeply nested choice sets, and preserves linkages between persons and their itineraries and trips. However, assignment of those trips to the network typically relies on software and methods built for customary four-step aggregate models, which assign centroid-to-centroid in few discrete classes of path choice criteria (such as HOV lane use eligibility). Finer spatial detail and heterogeneity in path choice are deterred by the excessively large matrices and/or many shortest-path tree computations required. This study examines the practicality of individual trip assignment at overcoming these limitations, in terms of computational performance and empirical convergence toward equilibrium. The tested method uses the <b>A-star</b> path-choice <b>algorithm</b> and a simple iterative loading procedure. One path per individual trip is chosen, and a full relational linkage is retained between each trip, path, link, itinerary, and person in the model.

The Footprint-to-Pathfinder path-finding code implements a variation of an algorithm described by Nils Nilsson called the A Algorithm. The A Algorithm can guarantee the optimal, lowest cost path between two points when it uses an “admissible ” evaluation function. It is then called the A * (<b>A-Star)</b> <b>Algorithm.</b> The Footprint-to-Pathfinder implementation uses a simplification to the A Algorithm that preserves optimality when a particular condition exists.

However, there are admissible evaluation functions that will cause the simplified implementation to return a path that is sub-optimal.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} studies novel robotic systems {{based on}} tensegrity structures, {{with an emphasis}} on their locomotion capabilities. Naturally compliant tensegrity structures have several unique properties that are advantageous for co-robotic or soft robotic platforms; they are lightweight, deployable, robust, and safe. By leveraging these distinctive features of tensegrity structures, tensegrity robots are expected to overcome the barriers for today's robots. In this regard, tensegrity robots have been envisioned {{for a wide range of}} new applications that have not been explored before, including assistive and rehabilitative healthcare, search and rescue, and planetary space exploration, to name a few. In order to be actually deployed for these applications, tensegrity robots should have mobility in the rst place. For this reason, two modes of locomotion are examined for spherical tensegrity robots in this research: rolling and hopping. This research begins by presenting four hardware prototypes of spherical tensegrity robots that have been constructed at the Berkeley Emergent Space Tensegrities laboratory. Three of them (named TT- 1, TT- 2, and TT- 3) are based on a six-rod tensegrity structure, and the last one (named T 12 -R) is based on a twelve-rod tensegrity structure. A six-rod tensegrity structure is the simplest three-dimensional tensegrity structure that has an outer shape similar to a sphere, and for this reason, the structure is chosen as a basis for the rst three robots. However, the rolling speed of the TT-series robots is limited because their outer surfaces consist only of triangles, which forces them to move in a zig-zag way and lose their momentum as they do so. This motivated the development of T 12 -R whose outer surface consists of mostly rectangles. This geometry enables the robot to move in a straight line, and thus prevents the loss of momentum. The hardware designs of all four prototypes are described in details. A spherical tensegrity robot rolls by deforming its shape and by shifting its center of mass. The study of tensegrity deformation, however, is not trivial and poses a unique problem because kinematics and statics of tensegrity structures are tightly coupled and need to be considered concurrently. This work develops two systematic ways of obtaining desirable deformations of spherical tensegrity robots for rolling. As a first step to both approaches, a condition on the center of mass of a spherical tensegrity robot that must be satised for the desirable deformations is stated. The first approach relies on a greedy search algorithm, and it quickly finds one deformation satisfying the condition. This algorithm was implemented in the NASA Tensegrity Robotics Toolkit simulator and the outcome of the simulation was tested on TT- 1 and TT- 2. Our hardware experiments show that the robots can realize a piecewise continuous rolling motion with the deformations found in the simulation. However, it was also observed that the robots occasionally fail to roll because the algorithm did not take reliability of the rolling motion into account when searching for the desired deformations. To overcome this drawback, the second approach that combines a dynamic relaxationtechnique with a multi-generation Monte Carlo is proposed. It is known in the literaturethat the dynamic relaxation is well suited for solving for the deformation of tensegrity structures under non-uniform internal tension distributions. This work adapts the technique to nd the deformations of the hardware robots, but with an explicit description of the rod constraint forces such that the convergence property of the technique is improved. The multi-generation Monte Carlo is then used to find a set of good deformations for reliable rolling by sampling and evaluating a number of deformed shapes through the dynamic relaxation. This procedure is simulated by using a custom-written software in MATLAB, and the results of the simulation as well as their validation on TT- 2 are discussed in details. Furthermore, this latter approach is not limited to six-rod tensegrity robots only, and its generalization to other spherical tensegrity robots is presented and demonstrated with T 12 -R. Hopping is another viable option for the locomotion of tensegrity robots as they can survive from significant impact shocks due to their structural compliance, while protecting the payloads they are carrying. This contrasts to many other rigid robots that are likely to break if they are dropped from a large height. Hopping could be especially useful when tensegrity robots are deployed for planetary exploration missions because it allows the robots to quickly travel long distances and to be less affected by ground conditions that are potentially unknown. To enable hopping, a tensegrity robot with a cold-gas thruster system is studied and its motion is simulated in this work. The simulation study of different hopping profiles on the Moon shows that longer hops are more energy-efficient but are subject to higher impulse at landing, which may lead to damaging the robot. Hence there is a trade-off between energy-efficiency and safety of the robot. This work also presents a path planning algorithm that is based on the <b>A-star</b> search <b>algorithm,</b> and it combines hopping and rolling for economical navigation on the lunar surface. A localization method based on height measurements of surroundings is also discussed. Another observation from the simulation study is that a thrust vectoring mechanism isnecessary to increase the fuel efficiency of the thruster-based tensegrity robot. This workintroduces four mechanisms that could be used for this purpose, and among them, a system with two reaction wheels is extensively studied. A spin-axis stabilization problem of the reaction wheel system is formally posed, and the controller that orients the thrust to an arbitrary direction is developed. For this, the (z,w) -parameterization is used to describe the rotational kinematics of the thruster system, but this work modifies the parameterization to explicitly include the target orientation. Based on this description of rotational kinematics, the controller is designed by using the Lyapunov's direct method in conjunction with LaSalle's invariance principle. This controller is globally and asymptotically stable and the proof is given. The controller is simulated on an example thruster system and the results are provided...|$|R

40|$|Energy is a {{major factor}} in {{designing}} wireless sensor networks (WSNs). In particular, in the real world, battery energy is limited; thus the effective improvement of the energy becomes the key of the routing protocols. Besides, the sensor nodes are always deployed far away from the base station and the transmission energy consumption is index times increasing with the increase of distance as well. This paper proposes a new routing method for WSNs to extend the network lifetime using a combination of a clustering algorithm, a fuzzy approach, and an A-star method. The proposal is divided into two steps. Firstly, WSNs are separated into clusters using the Stable Election Protocol (SEP) method. Secondly, the combined methods of fuzzy inference and <b>A-star</b> <b>algorithm</b> are adopted, taking into account the factors such as the remaining power, the minimum hops, and the traffic numbers of nodes.

We investigated both exact and heuristic methods. We contributed with the design, analysis, evaluation, implementation and experimentation of several algorithms for grid map path planning for both exact and heuristic methods. We also designed an innovative algorithm called relaxed A-star that has linear complexity with relaxed constraints, which provides near-optimal solutions with an extremely reduced execution time as compared to A-star. We evaluated the performance of the different algorithms and concluded that relaxed A-star is the best path planner as it provides a good trade-off among all the metrics, but we noticed that heuristic methods have good features that can be exploited to improve the solution of the relaxed exact method. This led us to design new hybrid algorithms that combine our relaxed A-star with heuristic methods which improve the solution quality of relaxed A-star at the cost of slightly higher execution time, while remaining much faster than A* for large-scale problems.

The background of the thesis was the project [...] -Shanghai Cigarette Factory Automatic Guided Vehicle transport system. Now, the system has been put into use and operated steadily for half a year. The application of AGV transport system promoted the transport efficiency, solved the safety problem ever existed, improved the factory's automation level and management level. The normal、 reliable operation of the system verified the correctness and reliability of the methods and algorithm discussed in the thesis...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new Route Generation Algorithm that accurately and realistically represents human route planning and navigation for Military Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT). The accuracy of this algorithm in representing human behavior is measured using the Unreal Tournament(Trademark) 2004 (UT 2004) Game Engine {{to provide the}} simulation {{environment in which the}} differences between the routes taken by the human player and those of a Synthetic Agent (BOT) executing the <b>A-star</b> <b>algorithm</b> and the new Route Generation Algorithm can be compared. The new Route Generation Algorithm computes the BOT route based on partial or incomplete knowledge received from the UT 2004 game engine during game play. To allow BOT navigation to occur continuously throughout the game play with incomplete knowledge of the terrain, a spatial network model of the UT 2004 MOUT terrain is captured and stored in an Oracle 11 9 Spatial Data Object (SOO). The SOO allows a partial data query to be executed to generate continuous route updates based on the terrain knowledge, and stored dynamic BOT, Player and environmental parameters returned by the query. The partial data query permits the dynamic adjustment of the planned routes by the Route Generation Algorithm based on {{the current state of the}} environment during a simulation. The dynamic nature of this algorithm more accurately allows the BOT to mimic the routes taken by the human executing under the same conditions thereby improving the realism of the BOT in a MOUT simulation environment...|$|E
30|$|The authors {{present in}} [11] PSO-based {{technique}} {{for determining the}} optimal set of parameters for a second PSO for collective robotic search. Particle swarm optimization technique was used to optimize the velocity parameters of robots in [9], {{to arrive at the}} shortest collision-free trajectory, satisfying dynamic constraints. A hybrid technique for the control of swarms of robots, based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) and consensus algorithms, is presented in [12]. A MOPSO algorithm is utilized in [13] to generate trajectories for mobile robots that are working on the environments that the robots are working on and may be included danger sources. Darvishzadeh and Bhanu [14] present a framework to use a modified PSO (MPSO) algorithm in a multiple robot system for search task in real-world environments. Nakisa et al. [15] also proposes a new method (APSO) to create an efficient balance between exploration and exploitation by hybridizing basic PSO algorithm with <b>A-star</b> <b>algorithm.</b> Nakisa proposes a method based on the multi-swarm particle swarm optimization (PSO) with local search on the multiple robot search system to find a given target in a complex environment that contains static obstacles [16]. Rastgoo et al. [17] proposed an algorithm named the “modified PSO with local search (ML-PSO)” applied in the exploration search space by adding a local search algorithm such as A-star to guarantee global convergence with a reduction in the search time. Allawi and Abdalla [18] used PSO combined with reciprocal velocity obstacles (RVO) method, in order to choose the best paths for robots without collision and to get to their goals faster. Das [19] proposed a new methodology to determine the optimal trajectory of the path for multiple robot in a clutter environment using hybridization of improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) with an improved gravitational search algorithm (IGSA).|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} {{benefits}} {{of owning a}} battery electric vehicle, including zero tailpipe emissions, potential independence from oil, lower fuel costs, and the option to recharge the battery at home. However, a significant concern about owning a battery electric vehicle is range anxiety: the fear that the battery will run out of charge before the driver reaches his or her destination. We address range anxiety by providing a robust optimization framework to give drivers confidence that they can reach their destinations in {{a reasonable amount of}} time with enough energy in the battery, even when there is uncertainty in travel time and energy consumption on the roads. The robust optimization appropriately incorporates uncertainty without significantly increasing the complexity of the problem. This thesis describes that optimization framework and how to use it on real-world examples to find appropriate routes, with a central part being the application of robust optimization to the problem. We develop an energy model, an optimization-based formulation using robust optimization, and algorithms to quickly find good routes for battery electric vehicles. The combination of using robust optimization, the <b>A-Star</b> <b>algorithm</b> to find shortest paths, and Lagrangian relaxation allows us to solve the problem in seconds or less. For one example start and destination, our algorithms required less than 2 seconds for each instance (energy consumption limit). In addition, for example trips, we compute a Pareto frontier to illustrate the time-energy tradeoff from driving different routes. We use Lagrangian relaxation to provide lower bounds and estimates that suggest that our algorithms produce near-optimal solutions. We apply our methodology to example trips in Massachusetts and Michigan to demonstrate its practicality and its potential for real-world use. Future work could continue to improve the modeling accuracy and include algorithmic enhancements to further improve running time, especially for larger networks. by Matthew William Fontana.
