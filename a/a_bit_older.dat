25|$|Assessment of the NVA/PAVN fighter. Compared {{to their}} VC {{counterparts}} most NVA {{had a higher}} standard of literacy. While his preparation was not especially impressive by Western standards, the typical NVA soldier proved more than adequate for the task at hand. NVA training was surprisingly conventional, with little special emphasis on jungle warfare. Most of the troops' learning occurred on the job. Service and indoctrination under the communist system prior to army recruitment made the typical NVA fighter <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>older</b> and more seasoned than his American or ARVN opponent. Throughout the conflict, NVA defections and surrenders were extremely low, especially compared to that of the VC, a testimony to their motivation and organization.|$|E

500|$|As well as Jeff Tracy, English-Canadian actor Peter Dyneley voiced the {{recurring}} character of Commander Norman, chief of {{air traffic control}} at London International Airport. His supporting character voices were typically those of upper-class Englishmen. Shane Rimmer, the voice of Scott, was cast {{on the strength of}} his performance on the BBC soap opera Compact. Meanwhile, fellow Canadian Matt Zimmerman was selected at a late stage in the process. The expatriate West End actor was given the role of Alan on the recommendation of his friend, Holliday: [...] "They were having great difficulty casting the part of Alan as they wanted a certain sound for him, being the youngest brother.

2500|$|It {{has been}} claimed that Besson has written {{the script for}} a sequel, which {{director}} Olivier Megaton was to direct and in which Portman would reprise the Mathilda role.

Unhappy at Besson's departure, Gaumont Film Company [...] "has held The Professional rights close to the vest — and will not budge". According to Megaton, the sequel will more than likely never happen.|$|E
2500|$|Because {{the actress}} playing Ian's mother Kathy (Gillian Taylforth) was fair-haired, they also {{wanted him to}} be fair, and because of Taylforth's age he also had to look very young. Ian was meant to be 14 years old when the {{programme}} first aired, but because of licensing regulations, the actor cast was required to be a 16-year-old who could [...] "play down". Adam Woodyatt, born in East London, had worked as an actor in his youth, but had given it up and relocated with his family to Wales. He was recruited from his old agency and it was decided that he was perfect for the part and he was subsequently cast as Ian Beale. In 1990 Ian's age was increased and he celebrated his twenty-first birthday two years after his eighteenth. The producers felt Ian needed to be <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>older</b> and more mature for storylines planned for him later that year.|$|E

2500|$|Due to {{fears of}} {{instability}} {{that might be}} caused, the cabinet of ministers decided not to publicly proclaim the death of Menelik II. As a result, Iyasu was never officially proclaimed as Emperor Iyasu V. However, both Menelik's death and Iyasu's de facto accession were widely known and accepted. The Church authorities, the Lord Regent Ras Tessema, and the ministers agreed that Iyasu's coronation should be postponed until he was <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>older</b> and had taken Holy Communion with his wife, which would make his marriage insoluble {{in the eyes of}} the Orthodox Church. However, Iyasu quickly encountered problems with his rule and he was never crowned. He was widely disliked by the nobility for his unstable behavior, and the church held him in suspicion for his alleged Muslim sympathies. After a troubled few years, Iyasu was removed from power. Zewditu was summoned to the capital, and on 27 September 1916, the Council of State and the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church officially announced the death of Emperor Menelik II and deposed Iyasu in favour of Zewditu. Zewditu's official title was [...] "Queen of Kings" [...] (Negiste Negest), a modification of the traditional title [...] "King of Kings" [...] (Nəgusä Nägäst).|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to obtain the best {{composition}} of the nutritional value of the flour produced from the different ripeness of nipa palm fruit.

T 2 (Nipa palm fruit with the ripeness level of <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>old).</b> T 3 (Nipa palm fruit with the ripeness level of old). Results of analysis of variance showed that the degree of ripeness of nipa palm fruit significantly affected the moisture, ash, fat, protein, fiber and starch contents of the flour produced. Based on the results of the physical and chemical analysis, T 2 (Nipa palm fruit with the ripeness level of <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>old)</b> was selected as the best treatment with moisture content of 13. 57 %, ash 2. 22 %, fat 0, 06 %, protein 6, 39 %, fiber 20. 19 %, starch content 61. 53 % and flour with natural white colour...|$|R

He must be eighty-five to-day, but he does not look <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>older</b> than when I first came here. He is a great breeder of sheep, and deals extensively in cattle. He attends market days for miles around in every sort of weather, and drives sitting bowed low over the reins, his lank grey hair curling over the collar of his warm coat, and with a green plaid rug round his legs. The calmness of advanced age gives a solemnity to his manner. He is clean-shaved; his lips are thin and sensitive; something rigid and monarchal in the set of his features lends a certain elevation to the character of his face. He has been known to drive miles in the rain to see a new kind of rose in somebody's garden, or a monstrous cabbage grown by a cottager. He loves to hear tell of or to be shown something that he calls 'outlandish.' Perhaps it was just that outlandishness of the man which influenced old Swaffer. Perhaps it was only an inexplicable caprice. All I know is {{that at the end of}} three weeks I caught sight of Smith's lunatic digging in Swaffer's kitchen garden. They had found out he could use a spade. He dug barefooted.|$|E
6000|$|After sermon {{we looked}} at the old castle, which made me an old man. The castle was not <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>older</b> for the twenty-five years which had passed away, but the ruins of the visitor were very apparent; to climb up round staircases, to creep through vaults and into dungeons, were not the easy labours but the {{positive}} sports of my younger years; but that time is gone by, and I thought it convenient to attempt no more than the access to the large and beautiful hall in which, as it is somewhere described, an armed horseman might brandish his lance. The feeling of growing and increasing inability is painful to one like me, who boasted, in spite of my infirmity, great boldness and dexterity in such feats; the boldness remains, but hand and foot, grip and accuracy of step, have altogether failed me; the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak, and so I must retreat into the invalided corps and tell them of my former exploits, which may very likely pass for lies. We drove to Dalhousie Castle, where the gallant Earl, who had done so much to distinguish the British name in all and every quarter of the globe, is repairing the castle of his ancestors, which of yore stood a siege against John of Gaunt. I was Lord Dalhousie's companion at school, where he was as much beloved by his companions as he has been ever respected by his companions-in-arms, and the people over whom he has been deputed to exercise the authority of his sovereign. He was always steady, wise, and generous. The old Castle of Dalhousie--potius Dalwolsey--was mangled by a fellow called, I believe, Douglas, who destroyed, as far as in him lay, its military and baronial character, and roofed it after the fashion of a poor-house. The architect, Burn, is now restoring and repairing in the old taste, and I think creditably to his own feeling. God bless the roof-tree! ...|$|E
