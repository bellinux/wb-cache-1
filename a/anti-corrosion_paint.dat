40|$|Red lead (Pb 3 O 4) {{has been}} {{extensively}} {{used in the past}} in <b>anti-corrosion</b> <b>paints</b> for the protection of steel constructions such as electricity pylons or bridges. Until recently, little has been known about the behavior of these Pb compounds in soils. Therefore, three pylon soils and six red lead <b>anti-corrosion</b> <b>paints</b> were characterized in terms of solubility, Pb mineral composition, extractability, sorption and desorption, and the chemical speciation of Pb in soil extracts. The pylon soils were characterized by moderate total Pb concentrations (˜ 700 mg kg- 1), while NH 4 NO 3 extractable Pb was exceptionally high (up to 15 % of total Pb). In soil extracts, the free Pb 2 + fraction ranged from 33 to 81 % of total soluble Pb. The equilibrium concentration of Pb derived from Pb 3 O 4 in ultra-pure water reached 68. 5 mg L- 1. This high solubility explains the observed high extractability in soils and contradicts earlier reports of much lower water solubilities of the compound...|$|R

5000|$|From {{the mid-1970s}} on, Knoebel then turned towards a gestural {{use of color}} on layered plywood boards or metal plates. From 1975 to date, Knoebel {{has been working on}} {{overlapping}} coloured rectangles called [...] "Mennigebilder" [...] ("Red Lead Pictures"), named after an <b>anti-corrosion</b> <b>paint</b> used in steel construction by the name of Mennige Paint, which the artist has used in these works. Whereas in his early years his palette was reduced to white, black, and brown, since 1977 he has been producing works with more color. His painting has since been characterized by a gesturally expressive application of colour on panels of layered plywood and metal placed in specific spatial relation. In the 1980s, Knoebel continued his associative loading of geometricizing picture elements and started to focus on the portrait. The arrangement of three, in colour nuanced vertical rectangulars next to and between two horizontal rectangulars is Knoebel’s formal solution for depicting the notion ‘portrait’.|$|E

50|$|Having shipyards {{that have}} been {{operational}} {{for a long time}} could lead to serious pollution to the environment as years pass by. There have been many different studies that have shown that welding, sandblasting, paint, and maintenance are some of the many factors that contribute pollution to the environment. It is common for a ship to have a hull made of steel, but this process must go through many layers of anti-fouling or <b>anti-corrosion</b> <b>paint</b> to ensure that the metal doesn't corrode and prevent organisms from attaching to the surface. The painting process is inevitable but will it be at nearly every shipyard there is, and two of the most common ways to paint a ship is by airtight spraying and thermal spraying. Many studies have shown that painting is what generates almost half dangerous waste at a shipyard due to using high-pressure equipment to wash or remove any unwanted material that is on it like rust. Which will eventually make its way to the water and creates water pollution to the environment. Once these have compromised the surface of the hull the ship must go to the shipyard for maintenance. In a study in 2011 samples of sediments were collected from two sites in coastal marine area of Yongho Bay, one from the shipyard yard and the other 500m away. These results had analyzed that both samples contained metals that included Al, Fe, Li, V, Cr, Mn, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Cd, Sn, and Pb. In addition, it had been confirmed that the concentration was higher in the first sample that was by the shipyard then the sample taking 500m away and was due to paint fragments applied to the steel ship hulls.|$|E
50|$|Body shells {{are painted}} in a semi-clean {{environment}} using solvent-based paint. Shells are dipped in chemical tanks to cleanse them of any oils {{picked up on}} the panels during their manufacture in Body Shop. Once bodies have been dipped and cleansed, they are then immersed in an <b>anti-corrosion</b> <b>paint</b> dip called ED (Electrocoat Dip). This 'dip' coats the entire body, both inside and outside, and is the first paint coating it will receive. Once the 'dipped' body has been stoved in the ED oven, the body progresses to the 'Sealing' Booth. In this booth, the body has its interior panel joints, floor, tailgate, hood and door edges sealed with a PVC based sealant, to prevent water ingress and corrosion as the car is driven on the road. Also within this zone, sound pads are added to the floor and boot to reduce road noise (standard practice in the motor industry). The next booth it enters is the 'Underbody' Booth. In this booth, similar to 'Sealing' Booth, the body's wheel arches are sealed using the same PVC based sealant. Robots then apply the underseal to the underfloor and wheel arches. Also robots are used to apply the SGC (Stone Guard Coat) layer to the sills: this coating is designed for abrasion resistance, i.e. preventing stone chips, scuffs, etc. From here, the body proceeds into the Undercoat Oven. The next zone is 'ED Sanding' booth where the body is inspected for any minor imperfections received in the ED Coat. The next zone is the 'Surfacer' Booth, where the body receives its second coat of paint, this being the Surfacer Coat, then into the Surfacer Oven. Next is 'Surfacer Sanding' Booth: the same as ED Sanding, this zone inspects the body for any imperfections picked up within the Surfacer coating. Next comes the 'Topcoat' Booth, where the body receives its final coats of paint, these being Topcoat and Clearcoat layers. After being stoved in the Topcoat oven, the body then enters the 'Touch-up' Booth where the body has its final inspection for any imperfections picked up in the Topcoat process. Once the body leaves here, it then moves on to the PBS (Painted Body Store) above Trim and Chassis to await {{the next step in the}} production process.|$|E

40|$|Cathodic {{protection}} is a proven technique to halt or minimise corrosion of steel {{embedded in concrete}} structures and bridges exposed to chloride from road dicing salt. Cathodic protection for reinforced concrete has generally been limited to impressed current systems due to the relatively high resistivity of concrete and reduced life of galvanic zinc anodes at high chloride content. Zinc rich paints (ZRP) are widely used as an <b>anti-corrosion</b> <b>paint</b> on steel substrates, an alternative to hot-dip galvanising. A type of vapour-permeable zinc-rich paint made of 96 % zinc has been proposed for cost effective and low maintenance impressed current cathodic protection of reinforced concrete structures. To evaluate its potential application in practice, the electrical, and electrochemical properties of the material have been investigated. The zinc-rich anode was found to shift {{the potential of the}} steel to more negative potentials successfully and satisfy the performance criteria in accordance with BS EN ISO 12696. In this research it is found that the optimum conductivity will be achieved by three coats to produce 280 - 320 m thickness {{in order to get a}} good current distribution in the surface of the anod...|$|E
40|$|Purpose - Corrosion {{protection}} {{is one of}} the important performance properties of organic coatings. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to develop a paint system for the protection of steel substrates from corrosion at high temperature atmospheres using silicone resin blend materials. Design/methodology/approach - An <b>anti-corrosion</b> <b>paint</b> system for high temperature atmosphere has been developed using silicone polyester resins. Silicone resin has been chosen due to its good resistance for corrosion in all kinds of environments. The paint system was prepared from the best performing binder system with the addition of inorganic pigments. Heat stability was studied according to ASTM D 2485 standards. Adhesion, impact resistance, film formation, thermal stability and electrochemical properties of the prepared coatings were evaluated by cross hatch adhesion method, tubular impact testing, scanning electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (ELS), respectively. Findings - The paint system possessed good adhesion properties and had high-impact resistance. The SEM graphs showed the uniform formation of the film surface. From thermal analyses, the prepared paint system withstood temperatures up to 400 degrees C. The heat-treated specimen has also been evaluated for corrosion protection by EIS, which showed high resistance after 30 days of immersion in 3 percent NaCl solution. Originality/value - In this work, an attempt has been made to develop a good paint system using silicone resin and polyester resin blend materials. This research will be useful for the application for high temperature atmosphere and it can give a valuable guidance to the students who are interested in pursuing research in organic coatings...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. When a brittle {{material}} is loaded by a blunt indenter a Hertzian cone crack may form in its surface. This crack weakens {{the material and}} can lead to material removal. In many practical situations a thin compliant coating may be applied either to deliberately reduce this type of damage or for some other reason (e. g. an <b>anti-corrosion</b> <b>paint</b> layer). This paper models abrasion and impact on the coated system by the contact of a rigid sphere. The results of simple analyses for the stresses within the coating are used to determine how the tensile stresses in the surface of the material, which would lead to Hertzian fracture {{in the absence of the}} coating, are modified by the presence of the coating. The two extreme cases of rigid and zero adhesion of the coating to the substrate are directly compared. It is found that the stresses are most sensitive to the coating adhesion, Poisson’s ratio and thickness while the modulus of the coating material is only of secondary importance. It is shown that for optimum protection by the coating, it should be rigidly adhering to the substrate, that i t should be nearly incompressible (Poisson’s ratio> 0. 4) and that the coating thickness should be approximately 20 % of the radius of the contact between the coating and the sphere. These criteria allow a protective coating to be designed using theoretical argu-ments rather than to be developed empirically.
