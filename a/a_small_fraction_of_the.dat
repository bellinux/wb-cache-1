5|$|Ancestry {{information}} {{reported in}} the 2000 Census reflects the diversity of Teaneck residents, with no single country accounting for more than <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population. Residents listed Italian (6.2%), German (6.0%), Russian (5.3%), Irish (5.1%) and Polish (4.2%) as the most common countries of ancestry, and an additional 4.3% listed United States. 6.3% of residents identified themselves as being of West Indian ancestry, of which 3.4% were from Jamaica.|$|E
5|$|The {{molecules}} {{bound and}} acted upon by enzymes are called substrates. Although enzymes can consist {{of hundreds of}} amino acids, it is usually only <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> residues that {{come in contact with}} the substrate, and an even smaller fraction—three to four residues on average—that are directly involved in catalysis. The region of the enzyme that binds the substrate and contains the catalytic residues is known as the active site.|$|E

5|$|A One Day International (ODI) is an {{international}} cricket match between two representative teams, each having ODI status, {{as determined by the}} International Cricket Council (ICC). An ODI differs from Test matches in that the number of overs per team is limited, and that each team has only one innings. , 37 players have represented the Hong Kong national team in ODIs, since its debut in 2004. Many of these players are of South Asian origin, a demographic which comprises only <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> overall population of Hong Kong.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>small</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{contaminated}} spray {{was thrown}} {{back into the}} air as the base surge. Unlike the Wilson cloud, a meteorological phenomenon in clean air, the base surge was a heavy fog bank of radioactive mist that rolled across all the target ships, coating their surfaces with fission products. When the mist in the base surge evaporated, the base surge became invisible but continued to move away, contaminating ships several miles from the detonation point.|$|E

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>small</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> zircon is {{converted}} to the metal, which finds various niche applications. Because of zirconium's excellent resistance to corrosion, it is often used as an alloying agent in materials that are exposed to aggressive environments, such as surgical appliances, light filaments, and watch cases. The high reactivity of zirconium with oxygen at high temperatures is exploited in some specialised applications such as explosive primers and as getters in vacuum tubes. The same property is (probably) the purpose of including Zr nano-particles as pyrophoric material in explosive weapons such as the BLU-97/B Combined Effects Bomb.|$|E
5|$|Around 25–33% {{of white}} dwarfs have metal lines in their spectra, which is notable because any heavy {{elements}} in a white dwarf should sink into the star's interior in just <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> star's lifetime. The prevailing explanation for metal-rich white dwarfs {{is that they have}} recently accreted rocky planetesimals. The bulk composition of the accreted object can be measured from the strengths of the metal lines. For example, a 2015 study of the white dwarf Ton 345 concluded that its metal abundances were consistent with those of a differentiated, rocky planet whose mantle had been eroded by the host star's wind during its asymptotic giant branch phase.|$|E
5|$|Jewish {{religion}} was unusual in that Jews acknowledged only one God, they considered themselves chosen by him, {{and they wanted}} Gentiles to accept their God as the only God. Jews based their faith and religious practice on the Torah, five books {{said to have been}} given by God to Moses. The three prominent religious parties were the Pharisees, the Essenes, and the Sadducees. Together these parties represented only <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population. Most Jews looked forward to a time that God would deliver them from their pagan rulers, possibly through war against the Romans.|$|E

The town features a hospital, primary and secondary school, university, sports center with a swimming pool, library, culture center, cinema, bus transport, hotels, a bank, and several museums. The newspaper Svalbardposten is published weekly. Only <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mining activity remains at Longyearbyen; instead, workers commute to Sveagruva (or Svea) where Store Norske operates a mine. Sveagruva is a dormitory town, with workers commuting from Longyearbyen weekly.|$|E
5|$|Research on the {{treatment}} of mercury poisoning is limited. Currently available drugs for acute mercurial poisoning include chelators N-acetyl-D, L-penicillamine (NAP), British Anti-Lewisite (BAL), 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid (DMPS), and dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA). In one small study including 11 construction workers exposed to elemental mercury, patients were treated with DMSA and NAP. Chelation therapy with both drugs resulted in the mobilization of <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total estimated body mercury. DMSA was able to increase the excretion of mercury {{to a greater extent}} than NAP.|$|E

5|$|A 2006 {{study of}} inland {{bodies of water}} around Canberra where wedge-tailed eagles and white-bellied sea eagles share territories showed little overlap {{in the range of}} prey taken. Wedge-tailed eagles took rabbits, various macropods, {{terrestrial}} birds such as cockatoos and parrots, and various passerines including magpies and starlings. White-bellied sea eagles caught fish, water-dwelling reptiles such as the eastern long-necked turtle and Australian water dragon, and waterbirds such as ducks, grebes and coots. Both species preyed on the maned duck. Rabbits constituted only <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> white-bellied sea eagle's diet. Despite nesting near each other, the two species seldom interacted, as the wedge-tailed eagles hunted away from water and the white-bellied sea eagles foraged along the lake shores. However, conflict with wedge-tailed eagles over nesting sites in remnant trees has been recorded in Tasmania.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>small</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{genes in}} an organism's genome control the organism's development. These genes {{are called the}} developmental-genetic toolkit. They are highly conserved among phyla, meaning that they are ancient and very similar in widely {{separated}} groups of animals. Differences in deployment of toolkit genes affect the body plan and the number, identity, and pattern of body parts. Most toolkit genes are parts of signalling pathways: they encode transcription factors, cell adhesion proteins, cell surface receptor proteins and signalling ligands that bind to them, and secreted morphogens that diffuse through the embryo. All of these help to define the fate of undifferentiated cells in the embryo. Together, they generate the patterns {{in time and space}} which shape the embryo, and ultimately form the body plan of the organism. Among the most important toolkit genes are the Hox genes. These transcription factors contain the homeobox protein-binding DNA motif, also found in other toolkit genes, and create the basic pattern of the body along its front-to-back axis.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, {{with the}} IG Farben {{conglomerate}} dismantled {{because of its}} {{central role in the}} Nazi regime, Sterling Products bought half of Bayer Ltd, the British Bayer subsidiary—the other half of which it already owned. However, Bayer Aspirin made up only <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British aspirin market because of competition from Aspro, Disprin (a soluble aspirin drug) and other brands. Bayer Ltd began searching for new pain relievers to compete more effectively. After several moderately successful compound drugs that mainly utilized aspirin (Anadin and Excedrin), Bayer Ltd's manager Laurie Spalton ordered an investigation of a substance that scientists at Yale had, in 1946, found to be the metabolically active derivative of acetanilide: acetaminophen. After clinical trials, Bayer Ltd brought acetaminophen to market as Panadol in 1956.|$|E

5|$|Among constant-width shapes with a given width, the Reuleaux {{triangle}} has {{the minimum}} {{area and the}} sharpest (smallest) possible angle (120°) at its corners. By several numerical measures it is the farthest from being centrally symmetric. It provides the largest constant-width shape avoiding the points of an integer lattice, and {{is closely related to}} the shape of the quadrilateral maximizing the ratio of perimeter to diameter. It can perform a complete rotation within a square while at all times touching all four sides of the square, and has the smallest possible area of shapes with this property. However, although it covers most of the square in this rotation process, it fails to cover <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> square's area, near its corners. Because of this property of rotating within a square, the Reuleaux triangle is also sometimes known as the Reuleaux rotor.|$|E
5|$|During a total solar eclipse, the Moon's shadow covers only <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Earth. The Earth {{continues}} to receive at least 92 {{percent of the}} amount of sunlight it receives without an eclipse–more if the penumbra of the Moon's shadow partly misses the Earth. Seen from the Moon, the Earth during a total solar eclipse is mostly brilliantly illuminated, with only a small dark patch showing the Moon's shadow. The brilliantly-lit Earth reflects a lot of light to the Moon. If the corona of the eclipsed Sun were not present, the Moon, illuminated by earthlight, would be easily visible from Earth. This would be essentially the same as the earthshine which can frequently be seen when the Moon's phase is a narrow crescent. In reality, the corona, though much less brilliant than the Sun's photosphere, is much brighter than the Moon illuminated by earthlight. Therefore, by contrast, the Moon during a total solar eclipse appears to be black, with the corona surrounding it.|$|E
5|$|During {{the casino}} {{shutdown}}, 36,000 casino workers were given leave. The shutdown of casinos resulted in lost {{revenue for the}} state, as an estimated $1.3 million per day was collected in gambling taxes plus an additional $2 million per day due to {{the closure of the}} lottery system. However, the sum of revenue not collected during the shutdown from gambling amounted to just <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state's annual budget. Atlantic City's 12 casinos suffered losses estimated at $16–20 million per day during the shutdown. Revenue losses to lottery vendors and casino employees have not been calculated. Legislation signed by Governor Corzine in June 2008 would keep casinos and racetracks open {{in the event of a}} future budget showdown, with the Governor noting that the casino industry is vital to the New Jersey economy and that it should not operate under the threat of closure as it did in 2006.|$|E
