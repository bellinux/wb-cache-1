Between him being suspected, more New Gen murders occurring, and Shogun supposedly targeting him, Takumi finds himself experiencing hallucinations and paranoia, and is unsure of what is real and who he can trust.

5|$|When {{war broke}} out in Europe in 1939, Learned Hand adopted an anti-isolationist stance. He rarely spoke out publicly, {{not only because of}} his {{position}} but because he thought bellicosity unseemly in <b>an</b> <b>old</b> <b>man.</b> <b>In</b> February 1939, he became his court's senior circuit leader (in effect, chief judge, although the title was not created until 1948). In this post, Hand succeeded Martin Manton, who had resigned after corruption allegations that later led to Manton's criminal conviction for bribery. Not an admirer of Manton, Hand nonetheless testified at his trial that he had never noticed any corrupt behavior in his predecessor. Having sat in two cases in which Manton accepted bribes, Hand worried for years afterward that he should have detected his colleague's corruption.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a young {{traveller}} named Bartz, {{resting in}} the woods near Tycoon, witnesses a meteorite plunge to the planet's surface just outside the castle. Bartz promptly investigates, discovering Lenna lying unconscious from attack. After rescuing her, they discover <b>an</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> the debris with partial amnesia named Galuf. Lenna explains {{that she had been}} {{on her way to the}} Wind Shrine after her father. Galuf suddenly recalls that it was his original destination as well, opting to accompany her. Though the trio part ways, Bartz soon encounters Lenna and Galuf again assaulted by monsters in a quaking valley. The three travel together, finding all land routes blockaded by the upheavals caused by the meteorite's fall. Exploring an underground cavern, they encounter a den of pirates and their leader, Faris. With the help of the pirate captain, the group makes its way to the Wind Shrine to discover the shattered Crystal, but no sign of the missing king. The shards react to their presence, however, and an image of Tycoon appears, explaining to them that they must protect those Crystals that yet remain.|$|E

25|$|Despite the {{uncertainty}} surrounding his origins, {{it is possible}} that Fergus was of Norse-Gaelic and native Gallovdian ancestry. Traditionally, the Gallovidians appear to have looked towards the Isles instead of Scotland, and the core of his family's lands seems to have centred in valley of the river Dee and the coastal area around Whithorn, regions of substantial Scandinavian settlement. Whatever the case, the fact that Fergus died as <b>an</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> 1161 suggests that he was born before 1100.|$|E

25|$|Coca-Cola's {{advertising}} {{has significantly}} affected American culture, {{and it is}} frequently credited with inventing the modern image of Santa Claus as <b>an</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> a red-and-white suit. Although the company did start using the red-and-white Santa image in the 1930s, with its winter advertising campaigns illustrated by Haddon Sundblom, the motif was already common. Coca-Cola was not even the first soft drink company to use the modern image of Santa Claus in its advertising: White Rock Beverages used Santa in advertisements for its ginger ale in 1923, after first using him to sell mineral water in 1915. Before Santa Claus, Coca-Cola relied on images of smartly dressed young women to sell its beverages. Coca-Cola's first such advertisement appeared in 1895, featuring the young Bostonian actress Hilda Clark as its spokeswoman.|$|E
25|$|In a July 2007 webchat {{hosted by}} her {{publisher}} Bloomsbury, Rowling stated that The Pardoner's Tale of Geoffrey Chaucer's Canterbury Tales was {{an inspiration for}} a folktale retold by Xenophilius Lovegood in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.

Death, angry at being cheated, offers to give them three gifts, the Deathly Hallows, {{as a reward for}} evading him.

Will is somewhat of a womanizer and wants to make money, whereas Jake is more interested in fairy tales and adventures. Jake feels that Will doesn't care about or believe in him; but even into their adulthood, Will is still very pained by the loss of their sister and blames Jake's belief in magic and happy endings for her death. This feeling of resentment is compounded with Will's intense desire to protect Jake, at times from himself.|$|E

500|$|Although Goldfaden, {{by his own}} account, was {{familiar}} at this time with [...] "practically all of Russian literature", and also had plenty of exposure to Polish theater, and had even seen an African American tragedian, Ira Aldridge, performing Shakespeare, the performance at Grădina Pomul Verde was only {{a bit more of}} a play than Grodner had participated in three years earlier. The songs were strung together with a bit of character and plot and a good bit of improvisation. The performance by Goldfaden, Grodner, Sokher Goldstein, and possibly as many as three other men went over well. The first performance was either Di bobe mitn einikl (Grandmother and Granddaughter) or Dos bintl holts (The Bundle of sticks); sources disagree. (Some reports suggest that Goldfaden himself was a poor singer, or even a non-singer and poor actor; according to Bercovici, these reports stem from Goldfaden's own self-disparaging remarks or from his countenance as <b>an</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> New York, but contemporary reports show him to have been a decent, though not earth-shattering, actor and singer.) ...|$|E

Lennon said that [...] "if I had said television was more popular than Jesus, I might have got away with it" [...] but stressed that he was simply remarking on how other people viewed and popularised the band. He described his own belief in God by quoting the Bishop of Woolwich, saying, [...] "not as <b>an</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> the sky.

500|$|Initial {{reports by}} The Observer {{suggested}} that Madonna would perform [...] "Die Another Day" [...] {{in front of}} Queen Elizabeth II at the premiere of the film in London's Royal Albert Hall, {{but it did not}} happen. It was not until two years later that she first performed [...] "Die Another Day", as part of her 2004 Re-Invention World Tour. The song was to be included as the final performance in the set list, but [...] "Holiday" [...] was chosen instead and [...] "Die Another Day" [...] was included in the third segment of the show. Wearing a circus-themed corset designed by Chanel, she and her dancers performed a Tango-like choreography to the song, while backdrops displayed <b>an</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> his deathbed. The performance was received favorably by Joan Anderman of The Boston Globe, who explained that [...] "the abstract ballroom choreography of 'Die Another Day' was an elegant antidote to the rote gyrations favored by the next generation of pop stars." [...] Towards the end of the performance, Madonna's dancers tied the singer on an electric chair and as it was raised high above the stage, she started singing [...] "Lament" [...] from Evita. The performance of [...] "Die Another Day" [...] was included on Madonna's documentary live album I'm Going to Tell You a Secret (2006), which chronicled the tour.|$|E
500|$|The {{interlude}} {{was followed}} by a Cabaret-like performance of [...] "Hanky Panky", which started the Circus act.

Then followed [...] "Die Another Day", with Madonna and her dancers in a Tango-like choreography and backdrops displayed <b>an</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> his deathbed. After that, she was strapped into an electric chair as she started singing [...] "Lament" [...] from the soundtrack of the film Evita and the platform rises with her to the top. Madonna commented later that [...] "Lament" [...] was her [...] "favorite part, [...] I like the idea of being restrained. I'm singing about all the things I could have had, but my ego got in the way and I destroyed all my happiness." [...] The Orbital remix/video interlude of [...] "Bedtime Story" [...] was performed as dancers swung on trapezes. An acoustic-style segment started with [...] "Nothing Fails", with the guitar being played by Madonna herself. After that, she sang [...] "Don't Tell Me", recreating the choreography from the song's video with her dancers. The next song played was [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] where symbols of the 72 names of God were displayed on the backdrops. During the performance of the combined [...] "Mother and Father", Catholic images along with Madonna's Mother were displayed on the backdrops. Madonna then performed John Lennon's pro-peace song [...] "Imagine" [...] when photo montages of war-ravaged children, bombed-out villages and artillery were displayed in the backdrops. Asked why she chose to cover this song Madonna simply said: [...] "I wanted to make a statement with the ultimate peace song." ...|$|E
