40|$|We {{study how}} innovators can optimally design {{licensing}} contracts {{when there is}} incomplete information on the licensee 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>valuation</b> of the innovation, and limited control over the licensee 2 ̆ 7 s development efforts. A licensing contract typically contains an up-front payment, milestone payments at successful completion of a project phase, and royalties on sales. We use principal-agent models to formulate the licensor 2 ̆ 7 s contracting problem, and we find that under adverse selection, the optimal contract structure changes with the licensee 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>valuation</b> of the innovation. As the licensee 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>valuation</b> increases, the licensor 2 ̆ 7 s optimal level {{of involvement in the}} development-directly or through royalties-should decrease. Only a risk-averse licensor should include both up-front and milestone payments. Moral hazard alone is not detrimental to the licensor 2 ̆ 7 s value, but may create an additional value loss when combined with adverse selection. Our results inform managerial practice about {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the different terms included in licensing contracts and recommend the optimal composition of the contract.

40|$|The {{seller of}} N {{distinct}} objects is uncertain about the buyer 9 ̆ 2 <b>s</b> <b>valuation</b> for those objects. The seller 9 ̆ 2 s problem, to maximize expected revenue, consists of maximizing a linear functional over a convex set of mechanisms. A {{solution to the}} seller 9 ̆ 2 s problem can always be found in an extreme point of the feasible set. We identify the relevant extreme points and faces of the feasible set. With N = 1, the extreme points are easily described providing simple proofs of well-known results. The revenue-maximizing mechanism assigns the object with probability one or zero depending on the buyer 9 ̆ 2 s report. With N > 1, extreme points often involve randomization in the assignment of goods. Virtually any extreme point of the feasible set maximizes revenue for a well-behaved distribution of buyer 9 ̆ 2 <b>s</b> <b>valuations.</b> We provide a simple algebraic procedure {{to determine whether a}} mechanism is an extreme point...|$|R

The model stylizes a buyer-seller relationship but the results apply quite naturally to many contractual situations including regulation and optimal income-taxation.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} comprises {{of three}} separate but related studies. The first study presents an analytical model {{that characterizes the}} revenue generation process for a popular kind of online auction, namely Yankee auctions. Such auctions sell multiple identical units of a good to multiple buyers using an ascending and open auction mechanism, which {{has its roots in}} the English auction, yet is significantly different. We put forward a portfolio of tools, varying in their level of abstraction and information intensity requirements, which help the auctioneers to maximize their revenues. The study sheds new light on how online auctions can be used to construct empirical demand curves for the auctioned goods. The methodologies used to validate the analytical model range from empirical analysis to simulation. A key contribution is the design of a partitioning scheme of the discrete valuation space of the bidders such that equilibrium points with higher revenue structures become feasible. Our analysis indicates that the auctioneers are, most of the time, far away from the optimal choice of key control factors such as the bid increment, resulting in substantial losses in a market with already tight margins. The second study uses available information to make inferences about bidder valuations. Using such information, we derive a priori estimates of the bidders valuations. We present an analytical model that predicts a consumer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>valuation</b> for a product, based on the joint consideration of the bidding strategy pursued and the bid values revealed, both of which are observable on the Internet. Subsequently, using an automated agent, we test the valuation prediction model against thousands of bids made on hundreds of real online auctions from Samsclub. com. Our data analysis is able to accurately “type” the bidding strategy based on observable variables, and is successful at predicting the bidder 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> eventual <b>valuation.</b> The third study is aimed at increasing the efficiency of multi unit ascending price auctions, armed with the ability to predict the bidder 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>valuation,</b> we use such a priori valuation information to increase the efficiency of the auctions through realtime calibration. We develop an analytical model for the auctioneer 2 ̆ 7 s revenue and derive optimal dynamic bid increments. We compare the auction outcomes based on the analytically prescribed bid increments and heuristics that are motivated by a deterministic effort to order the bidders 2 ̆ 7 sequence as they approach the final bidding round. Our empirical analysis indicates that auctioneers can derive the same or more expected revenue with fewer bidding cycles. ...|$|R

After model development, a univariate analysis as well as a binomial logit estimate are conducted with the variables {{selected on the basis of}} a set of proposed hypotheses. ^ Above all, it appears that the cash flow theory best accounts for the determination of payment method. The significances of the bidder 2 ̆ 7 s cash flow and Q ratio reveal that low growth firms with large free cash flow may have the flexibility to support a management-led acquisition or a recapitalization that might include a big cash payout to shareholders. ^ The acquisition strategy hypothesis is also supported in this study. The binary variable for the existence of competing bid turns out to have the largest t-statistic in all analysis. ^ There is mixed support for the optimal capital structure hypothesis and Hansen model 2 ̆ 7 s implications. The results suggest that consideration of both the bidder and target 2 ̆ 7 s debt ratio influences the decision to some extent although it is not a major determinant in the payment method decision. ^ The support for the information asymmetry assertion which argues that overvalued (undervalued) bidders use stock (cash) payment seems to depend on which proxy variable is used for the bidder 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>valuation.</b> With these results we can not conclude that the payment method is directly related to the bidder 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>valuation.</b> ^ While we verify that the tax carryover variable is neutral to the choice of the payment method, we failed to provide strong empirical support for the hypothesis that the target 2 ̆ 7 s step-up basis has a positive effect on the cash payments.

40|$|Uncertainty exists everywhere; {{from the}} future price of a stock, to the routing time of a network packet and playing a slot machine. In {{presence}} of such uncertainty, one often has to take a decision without knowing the entire information. While one approach is to optimize for the worst possible scenario (i. e. a robust approach), this is undesirable as it leads to large scale inefficiencies. Instead, we focus on designing optimization techniques to handle such uncertainty by assuming the presence of statistical information about the input. In this regard, we study two important classes of allocation problems: (a) allocation in a general stochastic packing framework, and (b) allocation to selfish buyers in a Bayesian setting (i. e. Bayesian mechanism design). ^ We first consider a generic stochastic packing framework where the item sizes or profits come from item-specific distributions; this framework encapsulates {{a wide variety of}} natural scenarios that include (a) deadline scheduling, (b) bandwidth allocation to bursty connections, and (c) asset allocation for a risk averse investor. We design new techniques to construct a PTAS for any stochastic packing problem in this framework, assuming a slight relaxation in the packing constraints. Our techniques can handle adaptivity, and extend {{to a wide variety of}} risk-averse objectives. Our techniques also yield a new approximation result when the packing constraints are strict. ^ We next focus on Bayesian mechanism design. In a mechanism, buyers 2 ̆ 7 valuations are private and the seller has to optimize only based on his priors. This leads to a unique set of stochastic challenges; we focus on three specific aspects: ^ As the outcome of a mechanism is random, there is risk associated with it; thus, the buyers 2 ̆ 7 as well as the seller 2 ̆ 7 s risk-aversion play a strong role in the design of the mechanism. We design approximately optimal DSIC and BIC mechanisms for a risk-averse seller in presence of potentially risk-averse buyers. This uses our result on utility equivalence of correlated random variables for a concave objective function. ^ In addition to being a private information, a buyer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>valuation</b> may as well depend upon the entire allocation. In particular, we consider the positive network externality effect on a buyer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>valuation</b> and design approximately optimal mechanisms for various single-parameter and multi-parameter settings. ^ Finally, we study the problem of designing mechanisms with desirable payment properties, such as (a) quitting rights for buyers, (b) ex post individual rationality in presence of budget constraints, and (c) cost to borrow money beyond budget; we give a generic technique to design optimal mechanisms in presence of such desirable but complex payment constraints. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{evolution}} of the modern Swedish inheritance taxation from its introduction in 1885 to its abolishment in 2004. A thorough description is offered of the basic principles of the tax, including underlying ideas and ambitions, tax schedules, and rules concerning valuation of assets, liability matters and deduction opportunities. Using these rules, we calculate inheritance tax rates for the whole period for a number of differently endowed family firms and individuals. The overall trend in inheritance tax burden exhibits an inverse-U shape for all firms and individuals. Up until the end of World War I, inheritance tax rates were very low (never above four percent). Tax rates began to increase in the interwar period with tax hikes in 1918, 1920 and 1934. After World War II tax rates increased rapidly for both inherited firms and individual fortunes. Effective tax rates peaked in the mid- 1970 <b>s.</b> <b>Valuation</b> reliefs were introduced in the 1970 s, which sharply reduced tax rates for inherited family businesses. Tax rates for deceased individuals having non-corporate wealth were first cut in 1987 and then significantly reduced in 1991 – 1992. Finally, inheritance and gift tax revenues were relatively small, typically 0. 1 to 0. 2 percent of GDP. Updated 2015 - 08 - 05.
