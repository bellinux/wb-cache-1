Both these we had in our first campaign when we worked London south central, and west; and then, too, we had our first poster--the HEALTH, BEAUTY, AND STRENGTH one. That was his design; I happen still to have got by me the first sketch he made for it. I have reproduced it here with one or two others to enable the reader to understand the mental quality that initiated these familiar ornaments of London.|$|E

His alcohol abuse was at one of its worst points, with Allman consuming [...] "a minimum of a fifth of vodka a day." [...] He felt the local police pursued him heavily; during this time, he {{was arrested and charged with}} a DUI. While he did not consider himself [...] "washed up", he noted in his autobiography that [...] "there’s that fear of everybody forgetting about you." [...] Southern rock had faded from view and electronic music formed much of the pop music of the decade. [...] "There was hardly anybody playing live music, and those who did were doing it for not much money, in front of some die-hard old hippies in real small clubs", he later recalled. Nevertheless, he reformed the Gregg Allman Band and toured nationwide. At one point, he attempted to reconnect with his children, though, according to him, [...] "it just wasn’t a good situation".|$|E
