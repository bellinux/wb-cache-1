5|$|Indians {{confirmed}} in 1746 that French traders periodically arrived by sea {{to trade with}} tribes in the lower Trinity River region. Eight years later, the Spanish learned of rumors that the French had opened a trading post {{at the mouth of}} the Trinity River. In September 1754, the governor, Jacinto de Barrios y Jáuregui sent soldiers to investigate, and they captured five Frenchmen who had been living at an Indian village. To dissuade the French from returning, Spain built the presidio of San Agustín de Ahumada <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> of Nuestra Señora de la Luz de Orcoquisac near the mouth of the Trinity at Galveston Bay. Conditions were awful at the new location, and both the presidio <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> were closed in 1770.|$|E
5|$|Previous space {{missions}} to comets, such as Giotto and Stardust, were fly-by missions.

5|$|The Anglican Church of Melanesia, a {{province}} of the Anglican Communion, was established in 1849 by George Augustus Selwyn of New Zealand.

The Church of Melanesia in Honiara operates three missions, the Melanesian Board of Mission, the Melanesian Brotherhood <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mission</b> to Seafarers Society from Honiara.

5|$|In August 2000, NASA asked project {{managers}} to consider {{looking at the}} Space Shuttle, instead of the previously proposed EELV, as a launch vehicle.

5|$|In March, NASA was {{studying}} {{the possibility of}} flying the first Apollo mission as a joint space rendezvous with the final Project Gemini mission, Gemini 12 in November 1966. But by May, delays in making Apollo ready for flight just by itself, and the extra time needed to incorporate compatibility with the Gemini, made that impractical. This became moot when slippage in readiness of the AS-204 spacecraft caused the last-quarter 1966 target date to be missed, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> was rescheduled for February 21, 1967.|$|E

By 1797, the mission boasted the largest native population in Alta California, with over 1,400 neophytes living in and around the mission proper.
