5|$|The genus {{is named}} after Mr. John Kimber, student, teacher, and {{collector}} who lost his life during an expedition to Central Australia in 1964. Originally it was described with the name Kimberia. Dr. N. H. Ludbrook drew <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that the name Kimberia is preoccupied by Kimberia Cotton and Woods, a turtle subgenus. Accordingly, the new name Kimberella was proposed by Mary Wade in 1972.|$|E
5|$|A {{plea for}} a review by the Constitutional Tribunal was sought as a last-ditch attempt {{to stave off the}} {{execution}} of drug trafficker Shanmugam Murugesu. Shanmugam's lawyer contended that his client's right to equal protection under Article 12 of the Constitution had been infringed. Referring to cases of six recent offenders similarly convicted under the Misuse of Drugs Act, Shanmugam's lawyer drew <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that those offenders had imported more than 700grammes of cannabis, an offence which attracted the death penalty, but were eventually charged with possessing less than 500grammes of cannabis which resulted only in a jail sentence. In contrast, Shanmugam, who had imported 1,029.8grammes of cannabis, did not have the amount reduced and was sentenced to death. The plea was rejected by the President on 12 May 2005, one day before the execution date.|$|E
5|$|Jane's legal husband, who {{was still}} living in London, {{attempted}} to blackmail her in 1838 by publishing {{the details of her}} marital status in Barnard Gregory's The Satirist. Johnson published the notice after learning that she was living with a Mr. Hogg. He was mistaken as to the identity of her lover, however, and attempted to blackmail James Hogg, a Member of Parliament for Beverly. After James Hogg prepared to bring a libel suit, Johnson quickly disappeared. Although one journalist initially planned to publish the correct identities of the parties involved, at Mary Shelley's request Leigh Hunt convinced him not to publish the story. Johnson died in Hammersmith in 1840, ensuring an end to the matter. Though they were now free to marry, Jane and Thomas declined to marry in order not to draw <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that they had been unmarried for so long.|$|E

5|$|Not My Life calls <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that, in the United States, the {{sentencing}} for human trafficking is less severe than for drug trafficking. The film indicates {{a relationship between}} contemporary slavery and globalization. It asserts that most human trafficking victims are children, although the filmmakers have recognized the fact that millions of adults are also trafficked. The film depicts human trafficking {{as a matter of}} good and evil, provides interviews with survivors of human trafficking, and presents analysis from anti-trafficking advocates. Throughout the film, Robert Bilheimer encourages viewers to personally combat human trafficking. Bilheimer was sparing in his use of statistics in the film, feeling that overloading viewers with figures might numb them to the issues.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{research}} into Pattle's claims {{has shown that}} at least 27 claimed victories can be directly linked to specific Italian and German losses, while only six claims are discounted as no Axis losses are recorded. Other research dedicated {{to the history of}} German bomber units, some of which took part in the air battles against Pattle's unit, have drawn <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that 97–98 percent of all German primary records belonging to the Luftwaffe have been lost either through Allied bombing or through Hermann Göring's order to destroy all records {{in the first week of}} May 1945. This makes any {{research into}} German losses difficult.|$|E
5|$|Denise Wong, the Calgarian {{actor who}} portrayed Number 18 in the premiere, {{said that the}} play was about the human condition. Evelyn Chew, the Vancouverite actor {{who took over the}} role for the 2012 tour, said that the play is intense because it unabashedly deals with human trafficking, and that builds in {{intensity}} to its climax. Sienna Howell-Holden, who played Mama in the premiere and the 2012 tour, said that many audience members had not been previously familiar with 21st-century human trafficking. The character of Mama calls <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that poverty in the Third World fuels sex trafficking. Stephen Waldschmidt said he hoped that the play will educate Canadians about human trafficking and motivate them to act on what they learn, thereby turning them into anti-sexual slavery activists. He also said he hoped that the play will put a face on the million women and children sold into sexual slavery each year worldwide. Because of the play's heavy themes, producers of the first performances issued an advisory for parents. Waldschmidt also stressed the amount of action in the play and said that, if the play was a film, it would receive a PG-13 rating and would be billed a thriller. He also said it was difficult to stage a play that is inherently sexual and extremely violent in nature without making it feel pornographic. Waldschmidt said that he wanted to stage She Has a Name partially to show how horrible human trafficking is and partially because the play is so theatrically gripping.|$|E

In this he was a remarkable example of Enlightenment idealism at work. He stressed the empirical ideal of that age by lauding its anxious <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> and he set about completing the work left unachieved by the previous attempt mentioned above. The results are crucial to an understanding of Scotland on the eve of both the Industrial Revolution and the French Revolution.|$|R
40|$|This note calls <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> that (i) <b>the</b> {{conduction}} velocities {{of central}} axons {{may not be}} predicted {{on the basis of}} diameter alone, (ii) that such structure-function relations as do exist may not be invariant. Data are presented which indicate that conduction velocities of rabbit callosal axons vary with the history of impulse conduction along the fiber. Increases and decreases of conduction velocity occur. Constant latency does not, therefore, constitute a necessary condition for identification of antidromically activated neurons, and variable latency does not constitute a sufficient condition for identification of synaptically activated neurons. The results are further discussed in terms of temporal coding of information in the central nervous system...|$|R

A few days later, 53 crew and passengers of Virginius were summarily executed by the Spanish, including several Americans and Britons, creating a serious diplomatic crisis. While war was apparently imminent, a Spanish ironclad was coincidentally berthed in New York Harbor, drawing <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that the U.S. Navy had not a single ironclad in serviceable condition for the defence of America's ports.|$|E

He draws <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> the side of Lapangan Merdeka on which KOSTRAD was situated was not occupied, and that only those generals who might have prevented Suharto seizing power (except Nasution) were kidnapped. Scott also discusses the relationship between Suharto {{and three of the}} Army battalions involved in the coup, which were under his command and staffed by US-trained soldiers. He notes that these battalions switched sides during the rebellion, working to both instigate and quell the coup.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT] Groundwater is one {{of major}} water {{resources}} in the North China Plain (NCP). The area from Taihang Mountain to Buohaiwan along 38 °N latitude in NCP has been chosen <b>to</b> analyze <b>the</b> evolution of groundwater quality. In viewpoint of water cycle, the authors of present paper paid careful <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that <b>the</b> basic characteristics of groundwater qualities are in close relation to groundwater flow system. It was found that groundwater quality changed from Ca-HCO_ 3 type to NaCl type, which matches well with groundwater flow direction from recharge area to discharge area. Based {{on the results of}} groundwater usage as well as chemical analysis, it is clearly that both nature and human activities effected greatly on the groundwater quality in NCP...|$|R

25|$|The {{play was}} written between 1961 and 1962, drawing on Stoppard's {{experiences}} as a Bristol theatre critic. It was initially named The Stand-ins and later, The Critics. It is a parody of the stereotypical parlor mystery {{in the style of}} Agatha Christie's The Mousetrap, {{as well as of the}} critics watching the play, with their personal desires and obsessions interwoven into their bombastic and pompous reviews. The title is a direct reference to the ending of The Mousetrap, a play well known for guarding the secrecy of its twist ending, although the producers of Agatha Christie's play could not publicly object without drawing even more <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact.</b>|$|E
5000|$|During Gibson's time on {{the bench}} his law clerks {{included}} M. Jerome Diamond and James M. Jeffords, who clerked for Gibson from 1962 to 1963.

As related by Jeffords, Gibson once paid closer <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> than <b>the</b> letter of the law in order to arrive at a just outcome in a tort case involving skiing. When Jeffords questioned Gibson's approach, Gibson said [...] "Never let the law {{get in the way of}} justice; justice is what counts."

5000|$|Further {{development}} of archontology as academic discipline requires new approaches. More <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> determining <b>the</b> dates of reigns and offices.

What does officially determine the premature end of an office holder's tenure: the date of his/her resignation, the date when the resignation was accepted by national legislature, the installation of a successor? Such questions are often neglected or noted only occasionally. Therefore, the study of political developments and national legal systems should be recognized as essential tool in determination of dates.

25|$|Nottinghamshire's {{claim to}} Robin Hood's {{heritage}} is disputed, with Yorkists staking {{a claim to}} the outlaw. In demonstrating Yorkshire's Robin Hood heritage, the historian J. C. Holt drew <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that although Sherwood Forest is mentioned in Robin Hood and the Monk, there is little information about the topography of the region, and thus suggested that Robin Hood was drawn to Nottinghamshire through his interactions with the city's sheriff. And, the linguist Lister Matheson has observed that {{the language of the}} Gest of Robyn Hode is written in a definite northern dialect, probably that of Yorkshire. In consequence, it seems probable that the Robin Hood legend actually originates from the county of Yorkshire. Robin Hood's Yorkshire origins are universally accepted by professional historians.|$|E
