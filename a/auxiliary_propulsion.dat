25|$|The {{instantaneous}} {{attitude of}} the vehicle was compared with the desired vehicle attitude in the LVDC. Attitude correction signals from the LVDC were converted into control commands by the flight control computer. The required thrust direction was obtained by gimbaling the engines in the propelling stage to change the thrust direction of the vehicle. Gimbaling of these engines was accomplished through hydraulic actuators. In {{the first and second}} stages (S-IC and S-II), the four outboard engines were gimbaled to control roll, pitch, and yaw. Since the third (S-IVB) stage has only one engine, an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>propulsion</b> system was used for roll control during powered flight. The <b>auxiliary</b> <b>propulsion</b> system provides complete attitude control during coast flight of the S-IUB/IU stage.|$|E
25|$|If it were {{to remain}} on the same {{trajectory}} as the spacecraft, the S-IVB could have presented a collision hazard so its remaining propellants were vented and the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>propulsion</b> system fired to move it away. For lunar missions before Apollo 13, the S-IVB was directed toward the Moon's trailing edge in its orbit so that the moon would slingshot it beyond earth escape velocity and into solar orbit. From Apollo 13 onwards, controllers directed the S-IVB to hit the Moon. Seismometers left behind by previous missions detected the impacts, and the information helped map the interior structure of the Moon.|$|E

At {{the same time}} of maintain speed, ships with lower design speeds provide possibilities for further reducing fuel consumption by using <b>auxiliary</b> wind <b>propulsion</b> devices. A kite is one type of <b>auxiliary</b> wind <b>propulsion</b> device {{that can be used}} for this purpose. The aim of this study is to investigate the influence of <b>auxiliary</b> kite <b>propulsion</b> on the performance of a Panamax tanker, specifically on engine power reduction, maneuverability in different wind/wave directions and on course-keeping ability of the ship. The study was carried out by means of computer-based simulations. Scenario combinations are established for various ship speeds, headings and weather conditions. For the purpose of simulation, a simplified <b>auxiliary</b> kite <b>propulsion</b> model was built. Throughout the simulations, forces, moments and motions of the tanker were recorded, and so were rudder angle, ship thrust and engine power. The result shows that <b>auxiliary</b> kite <b>propulsion</b> can play a significant role in reducing engine power in following up to beam sea conditions. The present study is a first step towards a fully dynamic kite model where a control mechanism will be introduced to find the most favorable flying trajectory. ...|$|R

For the purpose of simulation, a simplified <b>auxiliary</b> kite <b>propulsion</b> model is built and verified against full scale data. The SSPA in-house time domain maneuvering and seakeeping software – SEAMAN II is used for the study. The kite model is created as a subroutine to the SEAMAN software. The kite flies on the spherical surface along a predefined track. It performs span-wise rotation to achieve an optimum angle of attack. A NACA 4415 wing profile is adopted as the cross section of the kite. Aerodynamic forces are calculated based on the effective relative wind velocity and the optimum angle of attack. The radial component of the aerodynamic forces provides a traction force in the connection line. The traction force contributes to forces and moments acting on the simulated tanker. The numerical kite model was verified against full scale data. The deviations of traction force and thrust force between simulation and full scale could be controlled within 7 %. Throughout the simulations, forces, moments, and motions of the tanker are recorded, as well as rudder angle and propeller efficiency. These output variables are plotted and analyzed to describe the influence of the <b>auxiliary</b> kite <b>propulsion</b> to ship performance. The result shows that <b>auxiliary</b> kite <b>propulsion</b> plays a significant role in reducing engine power in beam and following sea conditions. According to the SEAMAN simulations, a reduction of at least 40 % could be obtained in many cases. The course keeping ability of the simulated panamax tanker is not affected by using the kite. The present study is a first step towards a fully dynamic kite model, where a control mechanism will be introduced to find the most favorable flying trajectory...|$|R

25|$|Originally built without <b>auxiliary</b> <b>propulsion,</b> SuomenJoutsen was {{refitted}} {{with two}} Skandia hot bulb engines, each producing 200hp, coupled to three-bladed fixed pitch propellers. The twin-shaft propulsion arrangement was very uncommon at that time. In practice the engines were found {{out to be}} underpowered, but they could still be used to assist manoeuvering in ports and in heavy weather. Two generators (5kW and 8kW) were added to produce electricity for about three hundred lights.

25|$|The S-IVB-500 {{model used}} on the Saturn V {{differed}} from the S-IVB-200 used as {{the second stage of}} the Saturn IB, in that the engine was restartable once per mission. This was necessary as the stage would be used twice during a lunar mission: first in a 2.5 min burn for the orbit insertion after second stage cutoff, and later for the trans-lunar injection (TLI) burn, lasting about 6 min. Two liquid-fueled <b>Auxiliary</b> <b>Propulsion</b> System (APS) units mounted at the aft end of the stage were used for attitude control during the parking orbit and the trans-lunar phases of the mission. The two APSs were also used as ullage engines to settle the propellants in the aft tank engine feed lines prior to the trans-lunar injection burn.|$|E
25|$|Great Western was an iron-strapped, wooden, side-wheel paddle steamer, {{with four}} masts to hoist the {{auxiliary}} sails. The sails {{were not just}} to provide <b>auxiliary</b> <b>propulsion,</b> but also were used in rough seas to keep the ship {{on an even keel}} and ensure that both paddle wheels remained in the water, driving the ship in a straight line. The hull was built of oak by traditional methods. She was the largest steamship for one year, until the British and American's British Queen went into service. Built at the shipyard of Patterson & Mercer in Bristol, Great Western was launched on 19 July 1837 and then sailed to London, where she was fitted with two side-lever steam engines from the firm of Maudslay, Sons & Field, producing 750 indicated horsepower between them. The ship proved satisfactory in service and initiated the transatlantic route, acting as a model for all following Atlantic paddle-steamers.|$|E

500|$|The {{first major}} {{change to the}} ship of the line concept was the {{introduction}} of steam power as an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>propulsion</b> system. Steam power was gradually introduced to the navy {{in the first half}} of the 19th century, initially for small craft and later for frigates. The French Navy introduced steam to the line of battle with the 90-gun [...] in 1850—the first true steam battleship. Napoléon was armed as a conventional ship-of-the-line, but her steam engines could give her a speed of , regardless of the wind condition. This was a potentially decisive advantage in a naval engagement. The introduction of steam accelerated the growth in size of battleships. France and the United Kingdom were the only countries to develop fleets of wooden steam screw battleships although several other navies operated small numbers of screw battleships, including Russia (9), Turkey (3), Sweden (2), Naples (1), Denmark (1) and Austria (1). In addition, the Navy of the North Germany Confederacy (which included Prussia) bought [...] from Britain in 1870 for use as a gunnery training ship.|$|E
500|$|Subsequent {{research}} {{has suggested that}} another potential source for the lead may have been the ships' fresh-water systems rather than the tinned food. K.T.H. Farrer argued that [...] "it is impossible to see how one could ingest from the canned food the amount of lead, 3.3mg per day over eight months, required to raise the PbB to the level 80μg/dL at which symptoms of lead poisoning begin to appear in adults and the suggestion that bone lead in adults could be 'swamped' by lead ingested from food over a period of a few months, or even three years, seems scarcely tenable." [...] In addition, tinned food was in widespread use within the Royal Navy at that time and its use did not lead to any significant increase in lead poisoning elsewhere. However, and uniquely for this expedition only, the ships were fitted with converted railway locomotive engines for <b>auxiliary</b> <b>propulsion</b> which required an estimated one tonne of fresh water per hour when steaming. It is highly probable that it was for this reason that the ships were fitted with a unique water distillation system which, given the materials in use at the time, would have produced large quantities of water with a very high lead content. William Battersby has argued that this is a much more likely source for the high levels of lead observed in the remains of expedition members than the tinned food.|$|E
2500|$|Maine was {{designed}} initially with a three-mast barque rig for <b>auxiliary</b> <b>propulsion,</b> {{in case of}} engine failure and to aid long-range cruising.

The mizzen mast was removed in 1892, after the ship had been launched, but before her completion. Maine was completed with a two-mast military rig and the ship never spread any canvas.|$|E
