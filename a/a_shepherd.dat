5|$|Artisan poets {{included}} Molige Maraiah, a wood cutter; Madivala Machayya, a washerman; Ambigere Chowdiah, a ferryman; Madara Dhooliah, a cobbler; Hendada Mariah, a toddy tapper; Turugahi Ramanna, a cowherd; Kannadi Remmitande, {{a mirror}} maker; and Revanna Siddha, <b>a</b> <b>shepherd,</b> as {{but a few}} in {{a long list of}} poets. Poets Dakkeya Bommaiah, Bahuroopi Chowdaiah, Kalaketaiah and Nageya Maritande were ritual street performers and their poems reflect images from their trade.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the nativity scene {{featured}} seventeen new {{figures of}} spruce on loan to the Vatican from sculptors and wood sawyers {{of the town}} of Tesero, Italy in the Italian Alps. The figures included peasants, a flutist, a bagpipe player and <b>a</b> <b>shepherd</b> named Titaoca. Twelve nativity scenes created before 1800 from Tesero were put on display in the Vatican audience hall.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wealthy}} and {{powerful}} city of Troy, the pregnant queen Hecuba experiences a prophetic dream which distresses her. When consulted, a priestess of the Great Goddess tells Hecuba and her husband, King Priam, that the dream indicates she will birth a son who will bring destruction to Troy. Priam declares that this boy must be exposed to death, but upon his birth three days later, Priam agrees to Hecuba's pleas and has him fostered by <b>a</b> <b>shepherd</b> {{on the slopes of}} Mount Ida. Priam names the boy Alexandros (later Paris), and names his twin sister Alexandra, whom Hecuba keeps and decides to call Kassandra.|$|E

5|$|The first {{building}} in the area, dating from the 12th century, was in Højen {{on the west side}} of the peninsula. It belonged to Tronder, <b>a</b> <b>shepherd</b> who also became Skagen's first fisherman. Around 1340, Vesterby, on the east coast (to the south west of today's harbour), developed into the main village. Further to the south west, St Lawrence's Church was built at the end of the 14th century. In 1413, Erik of Pommern granted Skagen the status of market town with the result that for a time it became Vendsyssel's largest community with up to 2,000 inhabitants.|$|E
5|$|The next ring {{is named}} the Le Verrier ring after Urbain Le Verrier, who {{predicted}} Neptune's position in 1846. With an orbital radius of about 53,200km, it is narrow, with a width of about 113km. Its normal optical depth is 0.0062±0.0015, which corresponds to an equivalent depth of 0.7±0.2km. The dust fraction in the Le Verrier ring ranges from 40% to 70%. The small moon Despina, which orbits just {{inside of it}} at 52,526km, {{may play a role}} in the ring's confinement by acting as <b>a</b> <b>shepherd.</b>|$|E
5|$|While in {{the desert}} Moses defends three young girls from brigands, {{only to find out}} their older sister is Tzipporah. Moses is welcomed by Tzipporah's father and the high priest of Midian, Jethro. After assimilating this new culture, Moses becomes <b>a</b> <b>shepherd</b> and marries Tzipporah. One day, while chasing a stray lamb, Moses discovers a burning bush through which God tells him to go back to Egypt and guide the Hebrew slaves to freedom. God bestows Moses' {{shepherding}} staff with his power and promises that he will tell Moses what to say. Moses and Tzipporah return to Egypt, where Moses is happily greeted by Rameses, who is now Pharaoh.|$|E

5|$|In normal situations, lambs nurse after standing, {{receiving}} vital colostrum milk. Lambs {{that either}} fail to nurse or are prevented {{from doing so}} by the ewe require aid in order to live. If coaxing the pair to accept nursing does not work, one of several steps may then be taken. Ewes may be held or tied {{to force them to}} accept a nursing lamb. If a lamb is not eating, a stomach tube may also be used to force feed the lamb in order to save its life. In the case of a permanently rejected lamb, <b>a</b> <b>shepherd</b> may then attempt to foster an orphaned lamb onto another ewe. Lambs are also sometimes fostered after the death of their mother, either from the birth or other event.|$|E
5|$|John Hinton, {{known as}} Jack, {{was born in}} Colac Bay in Southland, New Zealand, on 17 September 1909, one of seven {{children}} of Harry Hinton, a railway man, and Elizabeth Mary. He was educated at local schools and on most days, before starting lessons, would milk a herd of 40 cows. When he was 12, he {{ran away from home}} after an argument with his father. He found a job at a grocer's in a nearby town but after a year signed on as a galleyhand aboard a Norwegian whaling ship, which spent the 1921/1922 whaling season in the Southern Ocean. On his return, and after reconciling with his parents, he started working as <b>a</b> <b>shepherd.</b> He soon tired of this and began the life of a swagman, working from town to town as he travelled around the South Island.|$|E
5|$|The inner moons {{are closely}} {{associated}} with Neptune's rings. The two innermost satellites, Naiad and Thalassa, orbit between the Galle and LeVerrier rings. Despina may be <b>a</b> <b>shepherd</b> moon of the LeVerrier ring, because its orbit lies just inside this ring. The next moon, Galatea, orbits just inside {{the most prominent of}} Neptune's rings, the Adams ring. This ring is very narrow, with a width not exceeding 50km, and has five embedded bright arcs. The gravity of Galatea helps confine the ring particles within a limited region in the radial direction, maintaining the narrow ring. Various resonances between the ring particles and Galatea may also have a role in maintaining the arcs.|$|E

5|$|The outer Adams ring, with an orbital {{radius of}} about 63,930km, {{is the best}} studied of Neptune's rings. It is named after John Couch Adams, who {{predicted}} the position of Neptune independently of Le Verrier. This ring is narrow, slightly eccentric and inclined, with total width of about 35km (15–50km), and its normal optical depth is around 0.011±0.003 outside the arcs, which corresponds to the equivalent depth of about 0.4km. The fraction of dust in this ring is from 20% to 40%—lower than in other narrow rings. Neptune's small moon Galatea, which orbits just inside of the Adams ring at 61,953km, acts like <b>a</b> <b>shepherd,</b> keeping ring particles inside a narrow range of orbital radii through a 42:43 outer Lindblad resonance. Galatea's gravitational influence creates 42 radial wiggles in the Adams ring with an amplitude of about 30km, which {{have been used to}} infer Galatea's mass.|$|E
5|$|Victorious, al-Hajjaj entered Kufa, {{where he}} tried and {{executed}} many rebels, but also pardoned those who submitted after admitting that through revolt {{they had become}} infidels. In the meantime, however, one of Ibn al-Ash'ath's supporters, Ubayd Allah ibn Samura, had recaptured Basra, to where Ibn al-Ash'ath now headed; and another, Muhammad ibn Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas, had captured al-Mada'in. Al-Hajjaj remained for a month in Kufa, before setting out to meet Ibn al-Ash'ath. The two armies met at Maskin on the river Dujayl. After two weeks of skirmishing, al-Hajjaj delivered the final blow by launching a simultaneous attack on the rebel camp from two sides: while he with {{the main part of}} his army attacked from one side, a portion of his army, guided by <b>a</b> <b>shepherd,</b> crossed the marshes and launched itself on the camp from the rear. Caught by surprise, the rebel army was nearly annihilated, with many rebels drowning in the river in their attempt to flee.|$|E
5|$|Zino's petrel {{has a very}} {{restricted}} {{range on}} the mountaintops of a single island, and is the most endangered European seabird. The birds, already confined to a limited area when discovered, {{were thought to be}} extinct by the mid-twentieth century. Two freshly fledged juveniles were found within the walls of the governor's palace in Funchal in the early 1940s, presumably attracted there by lights, but the species was not seen again until 1969. In 1969, Paul Zino played a tape of Fea's petrel from Bugio to <b>a</b> <b>shepherd</b> from Curral das Freiras; he immediately recognised the call, and led the researchers to the remaining nesting area. Predation by introduced rats meant that breeding success in the small population was low, and no young at all fledged in 1985. The Freira Conservation Project was founded in 1986 with the aim of increasing the population of Zino's petrel by controlling rats and human interference; the control was extended to cats after the mass predation of 1990.|$|E

5|$|An {{examination}} of a hunting tradition in northern Europe follows, where falcons assist humans in hunting by catching wild game, such as rabbits and pheasants. Further collaboration with man and animal is highlighted, {{this time with}} cheetahs. To demonstrate the cheetah's speed and effectiveness, a chase between a group of cheetahs and ostriches is arranged, in which the birds are hunted down and killed. The next animal collaborators are dogs, which hunt wild boar in Patagonia and a puma which has attacked a herd of sheep and <b>a</b> <b>shepherd.</b> In cities, however, stray dogs are the ones hunted by dog catchers, which the narrator claims demonstrates that the hunt is still active, but the prey has changed. Indios also use dogs to hunt monkeys, but their efforts are compared to mercenaries hunting the Indios themselves to clear them from their native land for development. In one such instance, mercenaries retaliate against a death of a workman by hunting down a group of Indios, one of which they torture, castrate and murder. Various scenes of wildlife are then shown, after which orangutans are hunted {{to be sold to}} zoos. The film then ends with the coexistence of man and animal between Erik Zimen, an ecologist, and wolves, the group of animals he wishes to save.|$|E
5|$|An {{individual}} {{domestic animal}} {{could also be}} regarded as a zduhać, such as <b>a</b> <b>shepherd</b> dog, ox, bellwether, horse, or billy goat. If an animal habitually made vocal sounds in sleep, it was assumed to be a zduhać. Such an animal was cherished, and was not for sale. The spirit of the animal zduhać would leave its body in sleep and fight against the enemy zduhaći, to protect its own flock or herd. Only the fertility of the livestock depended on the outcome of the battles fought by the animal zduhaći; they had no bearing on the crop yield. In the region of Užice, western Serbia, it was believed that storms and hail clouds were led by zduhaći who flew above them in the form of big birds. A black ox and a three-year-old rooster defended their village from them—especially the rooster, for which reason he was not killed for food, but kept as a home guardian. In folk spells for repelling hail clouds in Serbia, these clouds were called white cattle. This could be compared with the idea of the black ox as a defender from hail.|$|E
5|$|In 1868, Moore's {{father was}} again elected MP for Mayo {{and the family}} moved to London the {{following}} year. Here, Moore senior tried, unsuccessfully, to have his son follow a career in the military though, prior to this, he attended the School of Art in the South Kensington Museum where his achievements were no better. He was freed from any burden of education when his father died in 1870. Moore, though still a minor, inherited the family estate that was valued at £3,596. He handed it over to his brother Maurice to manage and in 1873, on attaining his majority, moved to Paris to study art. It took him several attempts to find an artist who would accept him as a pupil. Monsieur Jullian, who had previously been <b>a</b> <b>shepherd</b> and circus masked man, took him on for 40 francs a month. At Académie Jullian he met Lewis Weldon Hawkins who became Moore's flatmate and whose trait, as a failed artist, show up in Moore's own characters. He met many of the key artists and writers of the time, including Pissarro, Degas, Renoir, Monet, Daudet, Mallarmé, Turgenev and, above all, Zola, who was to prove an influential figure in Moore's subsequent development as a writer.|$|E

5|$|The {{day after}} Clifford's death {{the bulk of}} the Yorkist and Lancastrian armies faced each other at the Battle of Towton. After what is now {{considered}} the biggest and possibly bloodiest battle ever to take place on English soil, the Lancastrians were routed, and the son of the duke of York was crowned King Edward IV. On 4 November 1461, at Edward's first parliament, Clifford was attainted and his estates and barony forfeited to the king; a large portion were later granted to the earl of Warwick. The story– which would later be repeated by George Edward Cokayne in his Complete Peerage– of how Clifford's widow, fearing her son, Henry, would be slain in retaliation for Rutland's death, sent him into hiding as <b>a</b> <b>shepherd,</b> is almost certainly a folklore. As Dr James Ross has pointed out, the young Henry Clifford was pardoned in 1472, and as early as 1466 was named publicly as receiving a bequest, although Ross does suggest that Henry may well have gone into hiding for a time from his father's enemies.|$|E
5|$|Bravely Default {{is set in}} {{the world}} of Luxendarc, which is kept in balance by four {{elemental}} crystals. These crystals are protected and venerated by the Crystal Orthodoxy, a worldwide religious order. One day, the crystals are consumed by darkness, throwing the world into chaos. Agnès Oblige, Vestal of the Wind Crystal, escapes {{while the rest of the}} temple's worshipers perish to protect her. At the same time, a great chasm opens up beneath the village of Norende; Tiz Arrior, <b>a</b> <b>shepherd</b> of the village, is the only survivor. When he returns to the chasm hoping to find other survivors, he meets Agnès and her fairy companion Airy. The three are then attacked by forces from the hostile Duchy of Eternia, who seek to prevent Agnès from awakening the crystals. After defeating the soldiers, Tiz decides to travel with Agnès as her protector. They return to Caldisla, where they are also joined by Ringabel, an amnesiac vagabond who holds a book predicting future events, and Edea Lee, an Eternian soldier who becomes disillusioned and defects after her commanding officer commits war crimes. The party travels to the four temples, and Agnès awakens each of the crystals from darkness while being confronted by the forces of Eternia. During their journey, the group is aided by the ancient Sage Yulyana and observed by the immortal Lord DeRosso. The party eventually reaches Eternia, the home of the Earth Crystal, and are forced to defeat the leader of Eternia, Edea's father Braev Lee in battle. A column of light then appears in the chasm, which Airy says can be used to heal it. However, Airy's ritual instead sends them into a parallel world.|$|E
