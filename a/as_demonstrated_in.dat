5|$|The advancements in portraying {{realistic}} emotions {{achieved with}} Final Fantasy X through voice-overs and detailed facial expressions have since become {{a staple of}} the series, with Final Fantasy X-2 and other subsequent titles (such as , Final Fantasy XII, XIII and its sequels, and XV) also featuring this development. Traversing real-time 3D environments instead of an overworld map has also become a standard of the series, <b>as</b> <b>demonstrated</b> <b>in</b> Final Fantasy XI, XII, XIII and its sequels, XIV and XV. Final Fantasy X can be considered a pioneer in 3-D RPG maps.|$|E

Many sculptors and stone-cutters of the period lived at the foot of Mount Etna, making a diversity of objects, including balustrades, pillars, fountains and seats for buildings. Shades of black or grey were used to create contrasting decorative effects, accentuating the Baroque love of light and shade <b>as</b> <b>demonstrated</b> <b>in</b> (illustration 2).|$|E

Other known designations for the aircraft include the DIS-200 and Idzeliye 71, its factory designation. The bomber version, if it had entered production, might have been known as the MiG-2.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{strength}} of Malvern Hill, <b>as</b> <b>demonstrated</b> <b>in</b> the battle, McClellan felt he needed to continue with his planned withdrawal to Harrison's Landing, to Fitz John Porter's chagrin. Porter felt that the Army of the Potomac should remain atop the hill or perhaps even continue their advance to Richmond. McClellan however insisted that Confederate troops greatly outnumbered his own, felt he could not protect Harrison's Landing from his current position at Malvern Hill, and feared being cut off from his supply depot. McClellan's mentality prevailed. The Union batteries and McClellan's engineers began moving to Harrison's Landing soon {{after the end of}} the Battle of Malvern Hill. Starting at about 11p.m. unit after unit began to follow. Within hours, nearly all of McClellan's Army of the Potomac was marching towards Harrison's Landing. Once the last of these men had crossed the Turkey Island Bridge, they destroyed the bridge and felled trees over it to stymie any pursuit, leaving the James River between the Union and Confederate armies.|$|E
5|$|The {{region of}} Transoxiana (Arabic: Ma wara' al-nahr) had been conquered by the Umayyad leader Qutayba ibn Muslim in {{the reign of}} al-Walid I (r. 705–715), {{following}} the Muslim conquests of Persia and Khurasan in the mid-7th century. The loyalties of Transoxiana's native Iranian and Turkic populations and those of autonomous local rulers remained questionable, however, <b>as</b> <b>demonstrated</b> <b>in</b> 719, when the Transoxianian princes sent a petition to the Chinese and their Turgesh vassals for military aid against the Caliphate's governors. The Turgesh responded by launching a series of attacks against the Muslims in Transoxiana, beginning in 720. These incursions were coupled with uprisings against the Caliphate among the local Sogdians. The Umayyad governor of Khurasan, Sa'id ibn Amr al-Harashi, harshly suppressed the unrest and restored the Muslim position almost to {{what it had been}} during the time of Qutayba, except for the Ferghana Valley, control over which was lost.|$|E

25|$|Quazepam has potent sleep {{inducing}} {{and sleep}} maintaining properties. Studies in both {{animals and humans}} have demonstrated that EEG changes induced by quazepam resemble normal sleep patterns whereas other benzodiazepines disrupt normal sleep. Quazepam promotes slow wave sleep.

This makes quazepam unique in the benzodiazepine family of drugs.|$|E
25|$|Flexibility.
