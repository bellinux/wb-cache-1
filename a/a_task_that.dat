5|$|Despite this, while {{commanding}} Army Group Centre, {{he refused}} to dispatch troops {{to put down the}} Warsaw uprising (<b>a</b> <b>task</b> <b>that</b> ultimately was carried out by the SS), viewing it as a rear-area matter. He stated that the revolt arose from the mistreatment of the Polish population by the Nazis, and the army should {{have nothing to do with}} it. On the other hand, he showed no hesitation in clearing the Warsaw suburbs of Praga and Saska Kępa, through which vital supply lines ran.|$|E
5|$|Iwate {{played a}} minor {{role in the}} war, {{participating}} in the Battle of Tsingtao before sailing to the South Sea Islands to search for German commerce raiders. The ship began the first of her many training cruises for naval cadets of the Imperial Japanese Navy Academy in 1916, <b>a</b> <b>task</b> <b>that</b> would last {{until the end of}} 1939. Izumo began making training voyages of her own during the 1920s.|$|E

5|$|Sometimes {{in areas}} where the new wages were applied, {{factories}} would struggle to recruit workers for important tasks because the reform had given a low pay grade to <b>a</b> <b>task</b> <b>that</b> was considered to require a lower level of skill. For example, machine-tool operation was given a low pay grade, and at one factory in Kotlyakov some 30 machine-tools sat unused as factory managers were unable to recruit workers to operate them.|$|E
5|$|Following the Caliph's instructions, Yazid {{proceeded}} to Caesarea, {{and once again}} laid siege to the port city. Amr and Shurahbil marched to complete the occupation of Palestine, <b>a</b> <b>task</b> <b>that</b> was completed {{by the end of}} the year. Caesarea, however, could not be taken until 640, when at last, the garrison surrendered to Muawiyah I, then a governor of Syria. With an army of 17,000 men, Abu Ubaidah and Khalid set off from Jerusalem to conquer all of northern Syria. This ended with the conquest of Antioch in late 637. In 639, the Muslims invaded and conquered Egypt.|$|E
5|$|The Peace of Philocrates {{eventually}} {{broke down}} as hostilities reignited between Athens and Macedonia. Demosthenes, an Athenian statesman who was partially responsible for engineering the peace treaty, delivered {{a series of}} speeches encouraging his fellow Athenians to oppose Philip II. The Macedonian hegemony over Greece was secured by their victory over a Greek coalition army led by Athens and Thebes, at the Battle of Chaeronea in 338 BC. In the aftermath the federation of Greek states known as the League of Corinth was established, which brought these former Greek adversaries and others into a formal alliance with Macedonia. The League of Corinth elected Philip as strategos (i.e. commander-in-chief) for a planned invasion of the Achaemenid Empire of Persia. However, Philip was assassinated before he could begin the campaign, <b>a</b> <b>task</b> <b>that</b> instead fell to his son and successor, Alexander the Great.|$|E

5|$|The {{ecological}} {{conservation of}} seamounts is {{hurt by the}} simple lack of information available. Seamounts are very poorly studied, with only 350 of the estimated 100,000 seamounts in the world having received sampling, and fewer than 100 in depth. Much of this lack of information {{can be attributed to}} a lack of technology, and to the daunting task of reaching these underwater structures; the technology to fully explore them has only been around the last few decades. Before consistent conservation efforts can begin, the seamounts of the world must first be mapped, <b>a</b> <b>task</b> <b>that</b> is still in progress.|$|E
5|$|Work {{immediately}} began on constructing the abbey church, <b>a</b> <b>task</b> <b>that</b> took many decades. It was a conservative design, {{heavily influenced by}} the thoughts of St. Bernard and the order's early churches in its homeland of Burgundy. It was cruciform in shape with an aisled nave of seven bays, a short, square east end, and transepts each with two side chapels. The eastern parts of the church were built first, and were likely finished in 1232, {{at which point the}} abbey received a royal donation of oak to build choir stalls. The remainder was probably completed by mid-century.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, the Australian {{government}} decided to purchase two passenger jets for strategic transport, primarily to mitigate what it {{saw as the}} risk of terrorist attack inherent in carrying VIPs on commercial flights. Its attempts to procure one Boeing 727 each from domestic carriers Ansett and TAA were unsuccessful but, in December, Qantas agreed to sell the government two Boeing 707s for $14.5 million. Purchasing big jets for VIPs was controversial, but the 707s were also intended for general long-range transport, being capable of carrying cargo or up to 160 passengers. The first {{was transferred to the}} RAAF in March 1979, and its inaugural Air Force flight took place on 22April. Located at RAAF Base Richmond, New South Wales, the 707s were initially operated by No.37 Squadron. They were formed into No.33 Flight under the command of Wing Commander J.D. Grierson on 2February 1981. The flight's first mission took place the same day, when it ferried RAAF members and their families to RAAF Base Butterworth, Malaysia, <b>a</b> <b>task</b> <b>that</b> had previously necessitated a Qantas charter.|$|E

25|$|Some of {{the clues}} had changes to their rules. The Detour and Roadblock retain their rules, {{although}} there is no limit on individual Roadblocks. Fast Forwards appear in the race, but they are not optional. Instead, the team that completes it fastest gets a two-hour time credit. Also featured alongside the Detour and Roadblock is the Intersection. However, the Intersection's rules are drastically different.

25|$|Certain animals, {{including}} {{bats and}} cetaceans, {{have the ability}} to determine orientation to other objects through interpretation of reflected sound (like sonar). They most often use this to navigate through poor lighting conditions or to identify and track prey. There is currently an uncertainty whether this is simply an extremely developed post-sensory interpretation of auditory perceptions or it actually constitutes a separate sense. Resolution of the issue will require brain scans of animals while they actually perform echolocation, <b>a</b> <b>task</b> <b>that</b> has proven difficult in practice.|$|E
