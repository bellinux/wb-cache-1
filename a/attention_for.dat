40|$|OBJECTIVE: Restrained eating {{style and}} weight status are highly correlated. Though {{both have been}} {{associated}} with an attentional bias for food cues, in prior research restraint and BMI were often confounded. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine the existence and nature of an <b>attention</b> bias <b>for</b> food cues in healthy-weight female restrained and unrestrained eaters, when matching the two groups on BMI. METHOD: <b>Attention</b> biases <b>for</b> food cues were measured by recordings of eye movements during a visual probe task with pictorial food versus non-food stimuli. Healthy weight high restrained (n = 24) and low restrained eaters (n = 21) were matched on BMI in an attempt to unconfound the effects of restraint and weight on attention allocation patterns. RESULTS: All participants showed elevated <b>attention</b> biases <b>for</b> food stimuli in comparison to neutral stimuli, independent of restraint status. DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that <b>attention</b> biases <b>for</b> food-related cues are common for healthy weight women and show that restrained eating (per se) is not related to biased processing of food stimuli, at least not in healthy weight participants...|$|R
