40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel source code optimization technique called <b>advanced</b> <b>code</b> hoisting. It aims at moving portions of code from inner loops to outer ones. In contrast to existing code motion techniques, {{this is done}} under consideration of control flow aspects. Depending on the conditions of if-statements, moving an expression can lead to an increased number of executions of this expression. This paper contains formal descriptions of the polyhedral models used for control flow analysis so as to suppress a code motion in such a situation. Due to the inherent portability of source code transformations, a very detailed benchmarking using 8 different processors was performed. The application of our implemented techniques to real-life multimedia benchmarks leads to average speed-ups of 25. 5 %– 52 % and energy savings of 33. 4 %– 74. 5 %. Furthermore, <b>advanced</b> <b>code</b> hoisting leads to improved pipeline and cache behavior and smaller code sizes. 1...|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the {{computational}} OECD/NEA pressurized water reactor main steam line break (PWR MSLB) Benchmark is {{the evaluation of the}} prediction capability of <b>advanced</b> <b>code</b> systems by means of a code-to-code comparison. The postulated MSLB-transient is characterized by a strong non-symmetrical core thermal behaviour due to the feedback between neutron kinetics and plant thermal hydraulics. The analysis of such transients with pronounced spatial power distortion represents a considerable challenge for <b>advanced</b> <b>code</b> systems. The transient is initiated by a double-ended break of one main steam line when the reactor TMI- 1 is operated at nominal power. The high heat removal through the break leads to a strong cooldown of the primary coolant. Under such conditions a power increase and a re-criticality of the core despite scram can not be excluded due to the negative reactivity coefficients. The MSLB-Benchmark enfolds three exercises as follows: Exercise 1 : integral plant simulation with best-estimate codes using point kinetics, Exercise 2 : multidimensional simulation of the core for given initial and boundary conditions, and Exercise 3 : integral plant simulation with coupled, best-estimate codes using 3 D-neutron kinetics models. Das Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe (FZK) and Framatome Advanced Nuclear Power/Erlangen (former Siemens/KWU) participated on the MSLB-Benchmark with the code system RELAP 5 /MOD 3. 2 for the Exercise 1 : In this report, the integral plant model developed for this Exercise 1 together with the calculated results will be presented and discussed.

We present the tool-supported transformation of signal processing algorithms coded in floating-point ANSI C to a fixed-point representation in SystemC.

The design environment enables fast bit-true simulation by mapping the fixed-point algorithm to integral data types of the host machine. A speedup by a factor of 20 to 400 can be achieved compared to C++-library-based bit-true simulation.

Choosing {{whether or not}} to use interactivity that requires plug-ins is a critical decision in user experience design.

If the function requires <b>advanced</b> <b>coding</b> language skills, it may be too costly in either time or money to code compared to the amount of enhancement the function will add to the user experience. There's also a risk that advanced interactivity may be incompatible with older browsers or hardware configurations. Publishing a function that doesn't work reliably is potentially worse for the user experience than making no attempt. It depends on the target audience if it's likely to be needed or worth any risks.|$|R
