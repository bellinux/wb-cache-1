Cadwalladr explained in 2007 that the introduction of the Across Asia on the Cheap booklet was [...] "a generational call to arms", as it contained Tony Wheeler's motivational cry: [...] "All you've got to do is decide to go and the hardest part is over. So go." [...] Cadwalladr further states that Wheeler's peers throughout the world subsequently made the decision to travel, regardless of whether they possessed a Lonely Planet guide.

5000|$|Lewis {{completed}} her first headline tour The Labyrinth in July 2010 {{and soon after}} began making plans for her then-untitled third album. Recording and production officially began in late 2010 {{with a view to}} releasing the album in November 2011. Originally [...] "Collide," [...] a collaboration with Swedish DJ Avicii, was released in August 2011, with the album to follow in November. However Lewis was inspired to continue making music and used her Facebook account to announce that the album was being pushed back into early 2012. 26 March 2012 was confirmed as the new release date for Glassheart. To bridge the gap between Echo (2009) and Glassheart, Lewis teamed with British producer Fraser T Smith to record Hurt: The EP, an extended play (EP) of cover songs which was released in December. In January 2012, Lewis announced that the album was being pushed back again, this time to November 2012. During an interview with Digital Spy, Lewis confirmed that she had recorded with Scottish DJ Calvin Harris and that Smith had been brought on board to help with production. In April 2012, in an interview at the Ariella Couture fashion show, Lewis stated, [...] "I'm now planning to have the album out in the summer 2012. Simon Cowell has heard some of the tracks and he loves it". Cowell would later publicly offer his support, declaring to Lewis that although there's been a lengthy wait of two years for new music, [...] "I think this new album is sensational, you've never sounded better."On 21 June 2012, Smith spoke to Music Week about Glassheart being released on 26 November 2012.

40|$|China's {{economy has}} grown at {{remarkable}} {{rates in the}} last three decades, bringing about big improvements in people's quality of life. On the downside, the increased economic activity has contributed to serious environmental problems, many of which are related to the country's energy system. Focusing particularly on Beijing, this study aims at illuminating how income growth and lifestyle changes relate to energy use in the society. An extended input-output analysis is applied to estimate the direct and indirect household energy consumption (HEC) of Beijing households at different levels of development in the year 2005. Using observations of how HEC varies across income groups in 2005 as a basis, projections of HEC towards 2015 are made. According to the results, the total HEC in Beijing amounts to 42 % of the total direct energy use occurring in all sectors within Beijing's geographical boundaries. Hence, {{a significant portion of the}} energy use in the society can be linked with consumer activities. For urban residents, indirect influences on energy use are found to be more than three times greater than the direct influences. Mainly due to growing incomes, total HEC in urban Beijing will grow substantially in the period 2005 - 2015, even with overall efficiency improvements corresponding to the central government's targets. The results indicate that the share of transport related energy use to total HEC will increase significantly. Without major efficiency improvements, huge increases in transport related energy use is to be expected towards 2015. Air conditioners will be the most important single electrical appliance contributing to increased residential electricity consumption in the near future. Due to significant uncertainty, the figures should be taken <b>as</b> <b>rough</b> <b>guides</b> to the magnitude of different types of energy use only. Nonetheless, it is the author's opinion that the study produces valuable insights that can add to our understanding of the underlying drivers of energy use in the Beijing society. The estimates are considered sufficiently accurate to serve as a basis for making some recommendations for improving the energy efficiency of the society. Based on the findings of the study, the author calls on central and local governments to: 1) Further incorporate the important role of consumer behaviour and lifestyle into energy conservation policies; 2) Make strong efforts to mitigate transport related environmental problems, focusing attention both on producers and consumers; 3) Give high priority to constructing energy efficient buildings; 4) Further strengthen and expand the performance standard and labelling scheme for electrical appliances; 5) Consider imposing constraints on the promotion of consumerism by the mass media and advertising industry...|$|E

50|$|A shot on {{goal is a}} scoring attempt.

A scoring attempt in hockey (as opposed to soccer) is officially counted as a shot only when it is directed on goal, resulting in a goal or requiring the goaltender to make a save. The numbers of shots and saves in a game are especially relevant to goaltenders, whose save percentage is based on how many shots did not get past them. The number of shots taken by skaters and the percentage on which they score is also measured, but these numbers are generally given less weight. Some shots on goal are considered more {{likely to result in}} a goal and are called scoring chances.|$|R
