5|$|Europa is the smoothest known {{object in}} the Solar System, lacking {{large-scale}} features such as mountains and craters. However; according to one theory, Europa's equator may be covered in icy spikes called penitentes, which may be up to ten meters high, due to direct overhead sunlight on the equator, causing the ice to sublime forming vertical cracks. The prominent markings crisscrossing Europa appear to mainly be albedo features that emphasize low topography. There are few craters on Europa, because its surface is tectonically too active and therefore young. Europa's icy crust has an albedo (light reflectivity) of 0.64, {{one of the highest}} of all moons. This indicates a young and <b>active</b> <b>surface,</b> based on estimates of the frequency of cometary bombardment that Europa likely experiences, the surface is about 20 to 180 million years old. There is currently no full scientific consensus among the sometimes contradictory explanations for the surface features of Europa.|$|E

40|$|Introduction During {{the last}} decade, {{there has been}} an {{increasing}} effort in the medical image analysis community on the subject of reconstructing the human brain cortex from Magnetic Resonance (MR) images. Reconstructing the cortex, however, with its complex geometry of cortical foldings, is a challenging task. Traditional methods based on edge detection and edge linking are computationally intensive and sensitive to noise. Recently, work based on <b>active</b> <b>surfaces</b> [1, 2, 3] has shown some promising results. Sandor and Leahy [1] employed <b>active</b> B-spline <b>surfaces,</b> MacDonald et al. [2] improved the convergence of <b>active</b> <b>surfaces</b> by using a multi-resolution scheme, and Davatzikos et al. [3, 4] modified the external force for <b>active</b> <b>surfaces</b> to allow the <b>active</b> <b>surfaces</b> to find the middle layer of the cortex. These methods, however, are only capable of finding the outer cortex surface or areas where deep convoluted foldings are not p...|$|R

25|$|Impact craters are the {{dominant}} geographic features on many solid Solar System objects including the Moon, Mercury, Callisto, Ganymede and most small moons and asteroids. On other planets and moons that experience more <b>active</b> <b>surface</b> geological processes, such as Earth, Venus, Mars, Europa, Io and Titan, visible impact craters are less common because they become eroded, buried or transformed by tectonics over time. Where such processes have destroyed {{most of the}} original crater topography, the terms impact structure or astrobleme are more commonly used. In early literature, before the significance of impact cratering was widely recognised, the terms cryptoexplosion or cryptovolcanic structure were often used to describe what are now recognised as impact-related features on Earth.|$|E
2500|$|The Houston {{region is}} {{generally}} earthquake-free. While {{the city of}} Houston contains over 150 <b>active</b> <b>surface</b> faults (some have estimated as many as 300 active faults) with an aggregate length of up to 310 miles (500km), the clay below the surface precludes the buildup of friction that produces ground-shaking in earthquakes.

2500|$|Although Earth's <b>active</b> <b>surface</b> {{processes}} quickly {{destroy the}} impact record, about [...] terrestrial impact craters have been identified. These range in diameter {{from a few}} tens of meters up to about 300km, and they {{range in age from}} recent times (e.g. the Sikhote-Alin craters in Russia whose creation was witnessed in 1947) to more than two billion years, though most are less than 500 million years old because geological processes tend to obliterate older craters. They are also selectively found in the stable interior regions of continents. Few undersea craters have been discovered because of the difficulty of surveying the sea floor, the rapid rate of change of the ocean bottom, and the subduction of the ocean floor into Earth's interior by processes of plate tectonics.|$|E

2500|$|Recent {{evidence}} {{also points}} to similar activity either having occurred or continuing to occur elsewhere. The geology of Pluto, for example, described by Ward and Brownlee as [...] "without mountains or volcanoes ... devoid of volcanic activity", has since {{been found to be}} quite the contrary, with a geologically <b>active</b> <b>surface</b> possessing organic molecules and mountain ranges like Norgay Montes and Hillary Montes comparable in relative size to those of Earth, and observations suggest the involvement of endogenic processes. Plate tectonics has been suggested as a hypothesis for the Martian dichotomy and in 2012 Geologist An Yin put forward evidence for active plate tectonics on Mars. Europa has long been suspected to have plate tectonics and in 2014 NASA announced evidence of active subduction. In 2017, scientists studying the Geology of Charon confirmed that icy plate tectonics also operated on Pluto's largest moon.|$|E
2500|$|The Edward R. Roybal Learning Center (previously {{known as}} Belmont Learning Center or Vista Hermosa Learning Center), in the densely {{populated}} Westlake district {{just west of}} downtown, was originally envisioned as a mixed-use education and retail complex to include several schools, shops and a public park. After {{more than a decade}} of delays stemming from the environmental review process, ground was broken for construction in 1995 [...] Midway through construction it was discovered that explosive methane and toxic hydrogen sulfide were seeping from an old underground oil field. Later, an <b>active</b> <b>surface</b> fault was found under one of the completed buildings, necessitating its removal. The LAUSD had spent an estimated $175 million on the project by 2004, with an additional $110 million budgeted for cleanup efforts. The total cost is estimated by LAUSD at $300 million. Critics have speculated that it may end up costing closer to $500 million. Designed by architectural firm DLR Group WWCOT, the school opened in 2008 as Edward R. Roybal Learning Center.|$|E
2500|$|The Houston {{region is}} {{generally}} earthquake-free. While {{the city of}} Houston contains 86 mapped and historically <b>active</b> <b>surface</b> faults with an aggregate length of 149 miles (240km). These include the Long Point–Eureka Heights fault system which runs {{through the center of}} the city. No significant historically recorded earthquakes have occurred in Houston, but researchers do not discount the possibility of such quakes having occurred in the deeper past, nor occurring in the future. Land in some areas southeast of Houston is sinking because water has been pumped out of the ground for many years. It may be associated with slip along the faults; however, the slippage is slow and not considered an earthquake, where stationary faults must slip suddenly enough to create seismic waves. The clay below the surface precludes the buildup of friction that produces ground shaking in earthquakes. These faults generally move at a smooth rate in what is termed [...] "fault creep." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{interaction}} between <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> agents and dyestuffs at the oil-water interface, {{as well as}} the influence of inorganic electrolytes on it, was studied by measuring electro-capillary curves. When the oil phase contained the cationic <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> agent, or the amphoteric <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> agent at the acidic side, and the aqueous phase the anionic dyestuff, the decrease in the interfacial tension over the cathodic polarization range, which is characteristic to cationic <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> agents, was suppressed due to the binding be-tween the <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> agent and dyestuff at the interface. However, if the aqueous phase contained the anionic, instead of cationic, dyestuff, no binding was found to take place, and the ordinary builder effect, i. a. the increase in surface activity, was observed. When the oil phase contained the anionic <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> agent, or the amphoteric <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> agent at the alkaline side, and the aqueous phase the cationic dyestuff, the decrease in the interfacial tension over the anodic polarization range, which is characteristic to anionic <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> agents, was suppressed due to the binding between the dyestuff and <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> agent.
