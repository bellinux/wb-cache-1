40|$|AbstractAs {{indicated}} by {{research on the}} long-term effects of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), maltreatment has far-reaching consequences for affected children. Effective prevention measures have been elusive, partly due to difficulty in identifying vulnerable children before they are harmed. This study employs Risk Terrain Modeling (RTM), an analysis of the cumulative effect of environmental factors thought to be conducive for child maltreatment, to create a highly accurate prediction model for future substantiated child maltreatment cases in the City of Fort Worth, Texas. The model is superior to commonly used hotspot predictions and more beneficial in <b>aiding</b> <b>prevention</b> efforts in a number of ways: 1) it identifies the highest risk areas for future instances of child maltreatment with improved precision and accuracy; 2) it aids the prioritization of risk-mitigating efforts by informing about the relative importance of the most significant contributing risk factors; 3) since predictions are modeled as a function of easily obtainable data, practitioners do not have to undergo the difficult process of obtaining official child maltreatment data to apply it; 4) the inclusion of a multitude of environmental risk factors creates a more robust model with higher predictive validity; and, 5) the model does not rely on a retrospective examination of past instances of child maltreatment, but adapts predictions to changing environmental conditions. The present study introduces and examines the predictive power of this new tool to <b>aid</b> <b>prevention</b> efforts seeking to improve the safety, health, and wellbeing of vulnerable children...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT – Delirium (acute confusional state) is {{a common}} {{condition}} in older people, affecting up to 30 % of all older patients admitted to hospital.

Delirium is often not recognised by clinicians, and is often poorly managed. Delirium may be prevented in up {{to a third of}} older patients. The aim of this guideline update is to <b>aid</b> <b>prevention</b> as well as the recognition of delirium and to provide guidance on how to manage these complex and disadvantaged patients.

25|$|In 1985, Williams began {{organizing}} in San Francisco {{to address}} the AIDS epidemic spreading throughout his community.

In 1986, Williams was diagnosed HIV positive at the age of 35.|$|E
25|$|Williams, {{along with}} other members of NABWMT, began to notice the rapid spread of HIV in {{communities}} of color.

In 1988, Williams became one of the co-founders of the National Task Force on <b>AIDS</b> <b>Prevention</b> (NTFAP), aiming to create preventative services that are geared toward gay men of color. Williams secured a grant from the CDC to fund the NTFAP.|$|E
25|$|In March 2006, the State Council of the People's Republic of China officially {{announced}} the first legislation directly aimed at controlling HIV/AIDS: the <b>AIDS</b> <b>Prevention</b> and Control Regulations. These regulations, {{together with the}} Five-Year Action Plan to Control HIV/AIDS (2006–2010), are {{an important step in}} the development of government policy related to the care and prevention of HIV/AIDS. Although considered bold, these regulations were passed more than 20 years after the first case of HIV infection was identified, which was recently proven. The development of a coherent policy {{was the result of a}} long and unsystematic process that involved initial missteps, said Bauer, considerable domestic and international education, debate, and trivial amounts of iterative trial-and-error learning. The new legislation resulted from communication and coordination among many agencies, including administrators, service providers, lobbyists, politicians, and policymakers.|$|E

25|$|In 1986, {{at the age}} of 28, he {{discovered}} he was HIV positive, Lestrade developed a career as a freelance music journalist, writing for Gai Pied, Libération and Rolling Stone. He played an influential role in the new house/techno music scene, writing weekly reviews in Libération that were widely read. In 1989, at 31, he shifted his focus to AIDS activism, and founded the first French chapter of ACT UP with close friends and journalists Pascal R. Loubet and Luc Coulavin. He was president of Act Up-Paris for the three first critical years. In 1992, he {{played an important role in}} founding of , a coalition of major French AIDS organizations. TRT-5 was at the forefront of AIDS treatment issues, and Lestrade was one of its administrators until 2002. By 2000, Lestrade switched from treatment issues to <b>AIDS</b> <b>prevention</b> and became a leading voice against barebacking and confronted the ground-breaking writer Guillaume Dustan. The romanesque story of this fight was written (without Lestrade's approval) in Tristan Garcia's first book, awarded by the prix de Flore, La meilleure part des hommes in 2008.|$|E

500|$|Creators {{have used}} the comics medium to educate readers about LGBT-related issues {{including}} safe sex, examples being Strip AIDS; and to influence real-world politics, as with the British comics book AARGH (Artists Against Rampant Government Homophobia), produced by British, American, and Canadian artists {{in response to a}} law that would make [...] "promoting homosexuality" [...] illegal by the British government. The comic book format and humour has been described as giving such works a more positive message than typical education material. Comic strip style educational material about AIDS dates back to a chart in the French magazine Liberation from 1986, which used simple figures to explain unsafe practices. Fiction comics produced specifically to foster <b>AIDS</b> <b>prevention</b> include the widely distributed French-language La Sida (1995), created by the Institut Alfred Fourrier as part of its [...] "Prevention Sourire" [...] series. La Sida was aimed at a young audience and used humour to de-dramatise the subject, with HIV status indicated a metaphorical [...] "little green monster". Sexile, a graphic novel by Latin American writer Jaime Cortez, is based on transgender HIV activist and educator Adela Vazquez. Published through AIDS Project Los Angeles, the novel is narrated in English and Spanish while commenting on themes of gender identity, sexual experiences and HIV/AIDS awareness. Vazquez's life is highlighted in the graphic novel, particularly her transition from the political uprising in Cuba to the vibrant LGBT community in San Francisco during the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Sexile, a work commenting on HIV/AIDS prevention, was collaborated with Gay Men's Health Crisis.|$|E
