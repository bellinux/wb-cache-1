5|$|Due to Langmuir's efforts, and the {{research}} of Schaefer at General Electric, the concept of using cloud seeding to weaken hurricanes gathered momentum. Indeed, Schaefer had caused a major snowstorm on December 20, 1946 by seeding a cloud. This caused GE to drop out for legal reasons. Schaefer and Langmuir assisted the U.S. military as advisors for Project Cirrus, the first large study of cloud physics <b>and</b> <b>weather</b> modification.

(2) Investigate the influence of ''matrix diffusion'' on the dissolution and apparent disappearance of residual DNAPL. (3) Investigate potential for biodegradation of chlorinated solvents in fractured <b>and</b> <b>weathered</b> shales at an existing contaminated field site and {{through the use of}} laboratory studies in microcosms and undisturbed columns of fractured shale saprolite.

40|$|Aging <b>and</b> <b>weathering</b> {{can reduce}} the solar {{reflectance}} of cool roofing materials. This paper summarizes laboratory measurements of the solar spectral reflectance of unweathered, <b>weathered,</b> <b>and</b> cleaned samples collected from single-ply roofing membranes at various sites across the United States. Fifteen samples were examined {{in each of the}} following six conditions: unweathered; weathered; <b>weathered</b> <b>and</b> brushed; <b>weathered,</b> brushed <b>and</b> then rinsed with water; weathered, brushed, rinsed with water, and then washed with soap <b>and</b> water; <b>and</b> <b>weathered,</b> brushed, rinsed with water, washed with soap and water, and then washed with an algaecide. Another 25 samples from 25 roofs across the United States and Canada were measured in their unweathered state, <b>weathered,</b> <b>and</b> <b>weathered</b> <b>and</b> wiped. We document reduction in reflectivity resulted from various soiling mechanisms and provide data on the effectiveness of various cleaning approaches. Results indicate that although the majority of samples after being washed with detergent could be brought to within 90 % of their unweathered reflectivity, in some instances an algaecide was required to restore this level of reflectivity...|$|R

This thesis examines the physical aging process of materials and translates that information into data that can be applied to CG materials resulting in a new prototype system for simulating realistic aging <b>and</b> <b>weathering</b> of CG materials. This new system will enable artists to quickly and accurately generate materials with a realistic appearance of aging <b>and</b> <b>weathering.</b> The resulting user interface generated from this system allows artists to create a variety of realistic and customized layered materials which offers a wide array of complexities. This prototype was then implemented into a studio setting which helped speed up the production process for material generation...|$|R
