5|$|What {{is today}} Route31 was {{defined in the}} 1927 New Jersey state highway {{renumbering}} as Route30, a highway that began in Trenton and ended in Buttzville. In the 1953 renumbering, Route30 was renumbered as Route69, as the number conflicted with US30 in southern New Jersey. The bypass of Ringoes, shared with US202, opened in the1960s. Due to the sexual meaning of the number and resulting sign theft, Route69 was changed in1967 to Route31 once <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>signs</b> were removed. The justification for the removal was that people were stealing signs as a trophy for dorm rooms because of their interest in the number69.|$|E

A false warning might have led to cynicism about any later warnings, but delaying a warning until an eruption began might lead to thousands of deaths, so the volcanologists were under some pressure to deliver a timely and accurate assessment of the volcanic risk.|$|E

25|$|Although Disentis {{managed to}} escape the {{dissolution}} which was the fate of most religious houses at that time, the 19th century was nevertheless a difficult and precarious period, with dangerously diminished material resources coupled {{with a loss of}} morale and spiritual discipline so severe that the abbey was not expected to survive. In desperation, Abbot Paul Birker of St. Boniface's Abbey, Munich, was sent in to attempt to turn the situation around, but with so little success that in 1861 he left Disentis and returned to Munich as a simple monk. Nevertheless, despite <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>signs</b> to the contrary, the abbey did survive. In 1880, with the restoration of religious houses in Switzerland, Disentis opened a secondary school, which continues to this day, {{and by the end of}} the 19th century had entirely regained its spiritual and material health.|$|E
25|$|On 20 June 1989, a sack {{filled with}} {{dynamite}} sticks was discovered near a beach house Falcone had rented {{in the town}} of Addaura by policeman Nino Agostino. Although Falcone had been threatened before, this failed attempt bothered him in the extreme because it had <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>signs</b> of an inside job. At the time, he was meeting Swiss prosecutors Carla Del Ponte and Claudio Lehman from Lugano who were helping to investigate the Mafia's financial holdings in Switzerland. Falcone believed that the assassination attempt not only involved the Mafia but some people in government as well. During the investigations into the money laundering networks of the Mafia, it became clear that former Palermo police chief Bruno Contrada who had moved to the intelligence service SISDE had warned a suspect about his impending arrest so that he could escape in time.|$|E

25|$|Nevertheless, Jamphel Gyatso {{was also}} said to possess <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>signs</b> {{of being the}} true {{incarnation}} of the Seventh. This was also {{claimed to have been}} confirmed by many portents clear to the Tibetans and so, in 1762, at the age of 5, he was duly enthroned as the Eighth Dalai Lama at the Potala Palace. At the age of 23 he was persuaded to assume the throne as ruler of Tibet with a Regent to assist him and after three years of this, when the Regent went to Beijing as ambassador in 1784, he continued to rule solo for a further four years. Feeling unsuited to worldly affairs, however, and unhappy in this role, he then retired from public office to concentrate on religious activities for his remaining 16 years until his death in 1804. He is also credited with the construction of the Norbulingka 'Summer Palace' started by his predecessor in Lhasa and with ordaining some ten thousand monks in his efforts to foster monasticism.|$|E
25|$|Virtually <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>signs</b> and {{symptoms}} of Graves' disease result from the direct and indirect effects of hyperthyroidism, with exceptions being Graves' ophthalmopathy, goitre and pretibial myxedema (which are caused by the autoimmune processes of Graves' disease). These clinical manifestations are dramatic and involve virtually every system in the body. The mechanisms that mediate these effects are not well understood. The severity of the signs {{and symptoms}} of hyperthyroidism is related to the duration of the disease, the magnitude of the thyroid hormone excess, and the patient's age. There is also significant variability in the individual response to hyperthyroidism and individual sensitivity to thyroid hormone fluctuations generally. On top of that, Graves' disease patients can undergo periods of hypothyroidism (for further information, see symptoms of hypothyroidism): finding the right dosage of thyroid hormone suppression and/or supplementation can be difficult and takes time. The body's need for thyroid hormone can also change over time, like in the first months after radioactive iodine treatment (RAI). Thyroid autoimmune diseases can also be volatile: hyperthyroidism can interchange with hypothyroidism and euthyroidism.|$|E
25|$|Andy Hug was in Switzerland {{in early}} August 2000 when he {{suffered}} more than thirty-nine attacks of high fever and heavy nosebleeding. He visited {{a hospital for}} medical tests and examination but doctors found no sign of illness. Despite {{the advice of the}} doctors and his manager Rene Ernst, Hug travelled to Japan on August 14 to train ahead of his planned participation in the K-1 World Grand Prix 2000 in Fukuoka. On August 15, his Swiss personal physician found a swollen tumor {{on the left side of}} Hug’s neck and declared it malignant. He was rushed to the Nippon Medical School hospital in Bunkyo, Tokyo on August 19 after suffering more feverish attacks. The doctors diagnosed leukemia and began chemotherapy immediately. They also warned Hug that due to heart and circulation problems he had suffered for a while, the chemotherapy treatment might in fact adversely affect his condition. The doctors’ warnings proved true when, after starting chemotherapy, Hug suffered hemorrhaging of the brain and inflammation of the lungs (pneumonia) combined with extreme fever. His body showed <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>signs</b> of acute leukemia: purple spots, digestion pipe bleeding, eyeball bleeding, urinary tract bleeding and genitals bleeding.|$|E

500|$|Non-kosher {{birds are}} listed {{outright}} (...) but the exact zoological references are disputed and some references refer to families of birds (24 are mentioned). The Mishnah refers to four signs {{provided by the}} sages. [...] First, a dores (predatory bird) is not kosher. [...] Additionally, kosher birds possess three physical characteristics: [...] an extra toe in the back (which does not join the other toes in supporting the leg), a zefek (crop), and a korkoban (gizzard) with a peelable lumen. [...] However, individual Jews are barred from merely applying these regulations alone; an established tradition (masorah) is necessary to allow birds to be consumed, even {{if it can be}} substantiated that they meet all four criteria. The only exception to this is turkey. [...] There was a time when certain authorities considered the signs enough, so Jews started eating this bird without a masorah because it possesses <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>signs</b> (simanim) in Hebrew.|$|E
500|$|Scattered Palaeolithic and Bronze Age {{materials}} {{have been discovered}} in and around Quarrington but while nearby Old Sleaford {{is known to have}} been settled in the Iron Age and occupied by the Romans, there is little evidence for sustained pre-Saxon settlement at Quarrington. Between 1992 and 1995, archaeologists evaluating 34 trenches across 13 hectares of land around the village uncovered 56 ditches or gullies, a number of postholes, a large collection of pottery sherds and [...] "extremely rare" [...] evidence of metalworking from the 6th–7th centuries. The site has been dated to the 5th–9th centuries, representing an early and middle Anglo-Saxon settlement. Although noted for its metalworking and its size, the archaeologists concluded that it [...] "displayed <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>signs</b> of a typical rural community", reflecting how [...] "the vast majority" [...] of the Anglo-Saxon population lived. Analysis of animal bones revealed that sheep-farming increasingly replaced pig-rearing at the site during this period. A small early Anglo-Saxon cemetery containing inhumations was uncovered in the parish in 2000.|$|E

500|$|In his {{dealings}} with Edward III, Robert blamed his border magnates for the escalating attacks on the English zones, but regardless of this the Scots retained the recaptured lands, which were often portioned out among minor lords, so securing their interest in preventing English re-possession. [...] Despite Robert's further condemnations of his border lords, <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>signs</b> were that Robert backed the growing successful Scottish militancy following Edward III's death in 1377. [...] In a charter dated 25 July 1378 the king decreed that Coldingham Priory {{would no longer be}} a daughter house of the English Durham Priory but was to be attached to Dunfermline Abbey. [...] In early February the Scots—apparently unaware of the conclusion of an Anglo-French truce on 26 January 1384 that included the Scots in the cease-fire—conducted an all-out attack on the English zones winning back Lochmaben Castle and Teviotdale. [...] John of Gaunt led a reciprocal English attack that took him as far as Edinburgh, where he was bought off by the burgesses, but destroyed Haddington. [...] Carrick and James, Earl of Douglas (his father William had died in April), wanted a retaliatory strike for the Gaunt raid. [...] Robert may have concluded that as the French had reneged on a previous agreement to send assistance in 1383 and then having entered into a truce with England, that any military action would have been met with retaliation and exclusion from the forthcoming Boulogne peace talks. [...] On 2 June 1384, Robert resolved to send Walter Wardlaw, Bishop of Glasgow to the Anglo-French peace talks, yet Carrick ignored this and allowed raids into the north of England to take place. [...] Despite this, by 26 July, the Scots were part of the truce that would expire in October. [...] Robert called a Council in September, probably for working out how to proceed when the truce concluded, and to decide how the war was to proceed thereafter.|$|E
