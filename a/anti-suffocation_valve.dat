50|$|Mechanical {{ventilators}} {{are therefore}} carefully {{designed so that}} no {{single point of failure}} can endanger the patient. They may have manual backup mechanisms to enable hand-driven respiration in the absence of power (such as the mechanical ventilator integrated into an anaesthetic machine). They may also have safety valves, which open to atmosphere in the absence of power to act as an <b>anti-suffocation</b> <b>valve</b> for the spontaneously breathing patient. Some systems are also equipped with compressed-gas tanks, air compressors, and/or backup batteries to provide ventilation in case of power failure or defective gas supplies, and methods to operate or call for help if their mechanisms or software fail.|$|E
5000|$|A full {{pressure}} helmet with a locking clear visor {{and a black}} sunshade worn to reduce any glare from reflected sunlight, especially during the approach and landing phases of the mission. This is the same model used with the LES, it was chosen for its wide field of view, comfort and lack of headborne weight. A communications cap (originally white, but since changed to dark brown and identical to those worn by the Russian cosmonauts with the Sokol space suits worn aboard Soyuz missions), is worn underneath the helmet, and connected to a special plug inside the helmet, which is then connected to the intercom system in the Orbiter, via a white-colored plug similar in appearance to the communications [...] "pigtail" [...] on the old Mercury helmets. An <b>anti-suffocation</b> <b>valve</b> {{at the back of}} the helmet allows for the passing of carbon dioxide from the helmet. The helmet's clear pressure faceplace is locked into place using a mechanical seal with a prominent [...] "lockdown" [...] bar which can be easily reached with gloved hands.|$|E
