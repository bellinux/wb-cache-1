40|$|Degraded native grasslands in Mediterranean {{areas can}} be {{improved}} by encouraging seedling regeneration from soil seed banks using chemical fertilization. The effect of mineral fertilizers on soil seed banks was studied in natural pastures at two locations in southern Italy: Carpino and Rignano Garganico. The aim {{was to determine if}} nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and combined nitrogen and phosphorus (NP) fertilization can promote increased soil seed density. The seed-bank size and composition were analysed over two growth cycles (2004 - 2006) at two periods of the year: at the early summer and at the early autumn. The plant species were classified into three functional groups: grasses, legumes and other species (all other dicots). A two-pool model (ephemeral and base pools) derived from the germination patterns was developed to quantify the dynamics of the germinated seed populations. The mean total seed number in the seed bank ranged from 2, 915 to 4, 782 seed m - 2 with higher values in early summer than in early <b>autumn.</b> Mineral <b>fertilizer</b> <b>applications</b> increased the seed-bank size (by 27 %, 23 % and 46 %, for N, P and NP, respectively) and modified the composition in both localities.

40|$|Potato {{leafhopper}} Empoasca fabae (Harris) (Homoptera: Cicadellidae) {{and maple}} spider mite Oligonychus aceris (Shimer) (Acarina: Tetranychidae) are important pests of maple trees. Investigations determined how insecticide use and fertilization impacted {{the abundance of}} E. fabae and O. aceris on `Red Sunset 2 ̆ 7 red maple and `Autumn Blaze 2 ̆ 7 Freeman maples. Bifenthrin applications directed against leafhoppers reduced damage to both cultivars, but increased O. aceris on Autumn Blaze. Using a threshold of one leafhopper per branch to trigger pesticide applications protected Red Sunset maples from leafhopper injury. It also prevented outbreaks of O. aceris on Autumn Blaze because few trees reached this density. Two phytoseiid mites, Neoseiulus fallacis (Garman) and Typhlodromus caudiglans (Schuster) (Acarina: Phytoseiidae), and one stigmaeid, Zetzellia mali (Ewing) (Acarina: Stigmaeidae) were identified as predators of O. aceris on maple leaves. Populations of Z. mali were higher in both years on Red Sunset than <b>Autumn</b> Blaze. <b>Fertilizer</b> <b>applications</b> on field grown maples increased populations of leafhoppers and spider mites. More damage by E. fabae was observed on fertilized Red Sunset than on fertilized Autumn Blaze trees. O. aceris populations were higher on fertilized Autumn Blaze than fertilized Red Sunset trees. O. aceris populations were positively correlated with nitrogen content in the leaves in both cultivars. Mite populations increased at a lower rate with increasing concentration of nitrogen in the leaves of Red Sunset than on those of Autumn Blaze maples. Differences {{may be explained by}} a greater abundance of Z. mali (Ewing) on Red Sunset maples. In laboratory experiments N. fallacis consumed significantly more protonymphs and adults of O. aceris, whereas Z. mali consumed more eggs. N. fallacis consumed more Z. mali on Autumn Blaze than on Red Sunset maple. Z. mali consumed fewer N. fallacis on both maple cultivars than O. aceris. Leaf domatia on Red Sunset leaves provide refugia for Z. mali predators. Absence of leaf domatia on Autumn Blaze left Z. mali no place to hide from N. fallacis and diminished their contribution to O. aceris mortality Thus, differential susceptibility of these cultivars to spider mites is mediated by the capacity of leaf domatia to influence intraguild predation among phtyoseiid and stigmaeid predators...|$|R

Even under the heterogeneous climatic conditions of the region during our experimental period, the results showed that the trend was the same as observed in previous studies: millet production improved through <b>fertilizer</b> <b>application</b> compared to the control (without fertilizer). The harvest index was also higher compared to that of the control. This increased production was consistently the same for all application timings. The marginal value-cost ratio on the investment calculated using a budgeting analysis for the on-farm experiment showed that - regardless of application timing - millet farmers who fertilized their fields with inorganic fertilizer made more profit than those who did not (control). This was also true for farmers who were unable to fertilize at sowing - delayed application was still the more profitable option relative to the no fertilizer control. Our results indicate that small subsistence farmers can be offered more options for inorganic <b>fertilizer</b> <b>application</b> timing using the micro-dosing technology. Delayed inorganic <b>fertilizer</b> <b>application</b> can help small farmers who are often labor constrained at the sowing period improve their yields as well as their economic return...|$|R
40|$|New maize {{varieties}} {{could be}} obtained through improvement of their plant populations. The method used in selection in the crop improvement was based on values of their genetic parameters. Bisma {{is one of the}} maize varieties that has a broad genetic background. New maize varieties {{could be obtained}} by improving their population through selection under different environmental conditions. Genetic parameter value were estimated by conducting an experiment under NCD II crossing at Bogor. Twenty seven sets, which were developed from three females and three males of S 1 as parents of each set, were evaluated under three different fertilization schemes. Results of the experiment showed that the additive genetic variance was significantly different from zero, and so among the different levels of <b>fertilizer</b> <b>applications.</b> The dominant variances was not significant under the three different levels of fertilization applications. The additive genetic variance was lower under the low level of <b>fertilizer</b> <b>application</b> than that on the higher level of fertilization application. This might be due to the scale effect. To reduce effect of scale, the data were transformed by dividing the grand mean value. After the data transformation, the genetic variance under the low level of <b>fertilizer</b> <b>application</b> tended to be greater than that under the higher level of <b>fertilizer</b> <b>application.</b> There was a tendency that population improvement of Bisma variety could be achieved better under lower level of <b>fertilizer</b> <b>applications</b> than under the higher ones...|$|R
40|$|In a pot experiment, {{effects of}} N <b>fertilizer</b> <b>application</b> on the {{concentrations}} of Fe, Mn, Cu and Zn in shoot of rice {{and the quality of}} brown rice were studied. In the treatments with N <b>fertilizer</b> <b>application,</b> {{the concentrations of}} Fe, Mn, Cu and Zn in most parts of rice shoot increased compared with control (no N <b>fertilizer</b> <b>application).</b> This indicated that the transportation ability of microelements from root to shoot in rice was improved with N <b>fertilizer</b> <b>application.</b> Effect of N fertilizer on IR 68144 was similar to that of on IR 64, but the concentrations of the microelements in plant differed, suggesting that the characteristic expression of the two rice genotypes was not controlled by the amount of N fertilizer supplied. The concentrations of those microelements in brown rice increased at first and then decreased with increasing N <b>fertilizer</b> <b>application,</b> reaching the highest at 160 kg/ha, at which the Fe, Mn, Cu and Zn concentrations in brown rice increased by 28. 96 %, 41. 34 %, 58. 31 % and 16. 0 % for IR 64, and by 22. 16 %, 13. 75 %, 8. 75 % and 20. 21 % for IR 68144 compared with control, respectively. Moreover, N fertilizer promoted the accumulation of protein, decreased the accumulation of amylose in grain, and enhanced gel consistency of brown rice. These results indicate that appropriate N fertilizer management could increase micronutrient contents in grain and improve nutrition quality of rice...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Long–term {{manure and}} <b>fertilizer</b> <b>applications</b> to a soil can {{increase}} phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) transport in runoff. This {{study was conducted}} to determine P and N transport in runoff following long–term (since 1953) manure and <b>fertilizer</b> <b>applications.</b> Duplicate soil samples (32) were collected in 1998 from the top 0. 1 m of selected plots of a long–term manure and <b>fertilizer</b> <b>applications</b> field experiment and later placed in 1 m 2 soil pans in the laboratory. Manure and fertilizer were mixed with 16 of the soil samples, while no treatment was applied to the other half (long–term residual effect). Simulated rainfall was then applied to the soil during initial and wet (24 hours later) events. Manure added just before simulated rainfall resulted in significantly greater concentrations of dissolved P (DP) ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we focus}} a mixed farming system of intensive-dairy and crop production. The intensive-dairy and crop farming system {{provides}} manure, taken from stalls of improved dairy cattle, to {{crops such as}} banana. By using panel data of 894 rural households in 2003 and 2005 in Uganda, we find the number of improved cattle per ha increases the organic <b>fertilizer</b> <b>application</b> per ha at least by 170 kilograms in. The organic fertilizer use increases banana yield by about 5 percent, when the organic <b>fertilizer</b> <b>application</b> increases by one ton per ha, although this estimate could be downward biased because of the attenuation bias from the poor quality of organic <b>fertilizer</b> <b>application</b> in quantity and quality. The integration of dairy and banana production is suitable in Uganda where soil degradation is concerned...|$|R
40|$|Kosteletzkya pentacarpos (L.) Ledeb. (seashore mallow) is {{recognized}} as an important plant species for several industrial applications, especially in North America and Asia. In Europe, seashore mallow is highly threatened and subject of conservation actions (e. g. reintroduction). In order to define appropriate multipurpose cultivation protocols, suitable for biomass production and for conservation purposes, we investigated the effect of varying levels of soil salt content and nutrient availability on seashore mallow. As expected, seashore mallow had the best performance in terms of growth rate, flowering and fruit production when fertilizer was applied, while salt had only limited effects. Interestingly, seeds produced by fertilized plants showed a lower germination performance and higher mortality than seeds developed from non-fertilized plants. Our results highlight a trade-off between parental plant growth and seed performance, the former being enhanced and the latter being reduced by <b>fertilizer</b> <b>application.</b> The causes of this trade-off are related to a transgenerational maternal effect of <b>fertilizer</b> <b>application</b> that {{has important implications for}} seashore mallow cultivation. Biomass production benefits from <b>fertilizer</b> <b>application</b> but if the quality of seeds and the fitness of the next generation are major objectives (e. g. seed production and species conservation), <b>fertilizer</b> <b>application</b> is not recommended...|$|R
40|$|Summary. The {{capacity}} {{values of}} strongly acidic and weakly acidic ionexchangers of biopolymers {{and the total}} cation exchange capacity of leaves and stems of maize are determined in dependence of <b>fertilizer</b> <b>application</b> level, soil pH and growth stage under field experiment conditions. Acidification of leached cinnamonic forest soil at high <b>fertilizer</b> <b>application</b> levels leads to an increased share of strongly acidic ionexchangers, mainly in the leaves. This provides additional cation exchange and shows the adaptability of maize to high soil acidity. The cation exchange capacities of leaves and stems increase with the rise in <b>fertilizer</b> <b>application</b> level and plant age. The capacity of stems is {{higher than that of}} the leaves, but the difference between them decreases in the same direction. In milk ripenness stage and highest <b>fertilizer</b> <b>application</b> level the capacities of leaves and stems are almost equal. Key words: soil pH; fertilizer application; maize; leaves and stems; acidic and sorption properties of plant tissues Abbreviation: CEC SA – capacity value of strongly acidic ionexchangers of biopolymers; CEC A – capacity value of weakly acidic ionexchangers of biopolymers; CEC (SA+A) – total cation exchange capacity of plant tissue...|$|R
