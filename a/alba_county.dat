5|$|Born in Cenade {{village in}} Transylvania's <b>Alba</b> <b>County</b> (at {{the time in}} Alsó-Fehér County), Agârbiceanu was the second of eight children; his parents were Nicolae and Ana (née Olariu). His father and {{grandfather}} were both woodcutters, while he believed his great-grandparents were cowherds, {{as indicated by the}} surname of his grandfather, Vasile , who originated in the Sibiu area. The name Agârbiceanu came from the family's ancestral village, Agârbiciu. According to the novelist's own notes, his father was literate and subscribed to a number of Romanian-language publications that appeared in Transylvania. His mother, although a great lover of stories and storytelling, was illiterate.|$|E

Roughly speaking, present-day Harghita County encompasses the former Udvarhely and Csík, the latter including Gyergyószék; Covasna County covers more or less the territory of the former Háromszék; and what was once Maros-Torda is mostly part of present-day Mureş County.

50|$|One {{month after}} the {{military}} occupation, on August 2, 1940, the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic was established on {{the main part of}} the annexed territory, while smaller portions were given to the Ukrainian SSR. Six Bessarabian counties, and small portions of the other three counties, along with parts of the Moldavian ASSR (formerly part of Ukrainian SSR), which was disbanded on that occasion, formed the Moldavian SSR, which became one of 15 union republics of the USSR.

The couple had two sons and three daughters, all of whom survived into adulthood. The Bianu family was an old peasant one of some means, the village a small Romanian one on a hillside. Living in proximity to the spiritual center of the Romanian Greek-Catholic Church {{in what was then}} the Austrian Empire, they belonged to that faith. Bianu attended primary school in his native village. His father understood the importance of schooling, even if this implied material sacrifices, and the boy studied for nearly a decade at the gymnasium and the Romanian high school in Blaj. When he arrived in 1868, the local atmosphere was uncertain and marked by the faculty's activism against the recent Austro-Hungarian Compromise, which consecrated Transylvania part of the Hungarian Crown, against Romanian demands.|$|E

500|$|Tellurium (Latin tellus meaning [...] "earth") was {{discovered}} in the 18th century in a gold ore from the mines in Zlatna, near today's city of Alba Iulia, Romania. This ore was known as [...] "Faczebajer weißes blättriges Golderz" [...] (white leafy gold ore from Faczebaja, German name of Facebánya, now Fața Băii in <b>Alba</b> <b>County)</b> or antimonalischer Goldkies (antimonic gold pyrite), and according to Anton von Rupprecht, was Spießglaskönig (argent molybdique), containing native antimony. In 1782 Franz-Joseph Müller von Reichenstein, who was then serving as the Austrian chief inspector of mines in Transylvania, concluded that the ore did not contain antimony but was bismuth sulfide. The following year, he reported that this was erroneous and that the ore contained mostly gold and an unknown metal very similar to antimony. After a thorough investigation that lasted three years and included more than fifty tests, Müller determined the specific gravity of the mineral and noted that when heated, the new metal gives off a white smoke with a radish-like odor; that it imparts a red color to sulfuric acid; and that when this solution is diluted with water, it has a black precipitate. Nevertheless, {{he was not able}} to identify this metal and gave it the names aurum paradoxium (paradoxical gold) and metallum problematicum (problem metal), because it did not exhibit the properties predicted for antimony.|$|E

Three of the ten towns that were almost exclusively populated by Roman citizens (Apulum, Ampelum and Potaissa) were in present <b>Alba</b> Iulia <b>county,</b> {{not far from the}} Roman capital Sarmizegetusa. [...] Genetic isolate due to migration from unattested migration from the Middle East would not be a plausible historic-geographical event as even the eastern branch of R1b in Europe is different than these in the Middle East. [...] The only ethnic groups with higher frequencies of R1b in the East are the Aromanians due to their main ancestry from the Roman West. In some occasions the U106 branch, which is minimal among Romanians, rises to the prevailing clade in some cities, but still at a low frequency. The high frequency of R1b was found in other places in Transylvania – 25% in Maramureș and Harghita, 20% in Mehedinți, 14% in Bihor, 11% in Vrancea, 0% in Neamț.

The introduced genes are not expected to cause disease symptoms in poplar and will not result in the production of infectious agents. Some of the constructs containing the gene of interest and selectable marker genes also contain a non-coding region derived from a plant pest that has been safely used to regulate the expression of transgenes in many plants. Neither the genes encoding the desired traits, nor the regulatory elements controlling their expression, have any inherent plant pest characteristics, nor are they likely to pose a plant pest risk...|$|R

Through its direct and indirect impacts, tourism attracts significant foreign exchange, investment and know-how and stimulates the local economy, with a significant multiplier effect on many other areas of the economy. In the same time, it has to be paid a great attention to the effects generated upon the rural communities by the tourists’ activities. Certainly, tourism development should be considered with all financial, material and human efforts that have to be done in order to support it. Tourism development in rural area should be strategically planned and its negative effects on nature and social-cultural environment of tourism areas should be limited...|$|R
