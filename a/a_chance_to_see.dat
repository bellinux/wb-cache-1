Cartoon Network began providing sample chapters and streaming video content to its Adult Swim website, along with prominent links to Shonen Jump's official site.|$|E
5|$|The NCMP {{scheme was}} {{introduced}} in 1984, and was a significant modification of the traditional Westminster system of government. Since the ruling People's Action Party had won all parliamentary seats in the four general elections since independence, Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew argued that the NCMP scheme would ensure that opposition voices would be heard in Parliament. According to him, this would be beneficial to Singapore as it would give the younger generation of Singaporeans <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what an opposition can or cannot do. When the first constitutional amendment was made to initiate the NCMP scheme, between three and six NCMPs were allowed in Parliament. The Constitution was amended again in 2010 {{to allow for a}} maximum of nine NCMPs in Parliament.|$|E

However, after he had <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> it in person, and after Barthel declared it authentic, his 'skepticism was dispelled' (1957:184). The evidence is principally the paraphrasing rather than copying of text Gr, which would have required literacy in the script to accomplish.|$|E

25|$|Chigurh then ruthlessly tracks Moss down. The hotel {{confrontation}} between Moss and Chigurh plays out very {{differently in the}} film from the novel; rather than punching out the lock and wounding Moss, in the novel Chigurh apparently steals a key from a murdered clerk and quietly enters Moss's room, and Moss ambushes him and takes him captive at gunpoint, so they have <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> and know each other. Then Moss runs and the chase/shootout begins. As Chigurh and Moss face off in the hotel and the streets, they are interrupted {{by a group of}} Mexicans, all of whom Chigurh kills.
