In recalling her initial thoughts upon reading the book by Hubbard, Christman commented, [...] "I was really looking for a higher state of consciousness {{and a way of}} helping people. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> Dianetics and I felt [...] "WOW this is it!"

She stated in the book, [...] "I find life just gets better and better." [...] Christman has a son.|$|E
500|$|Work on Hooper's next film, The King's Speech, {{began in}} the same year. Hooper explained: [...] "It was a stage play, and my mother who's Australian was invited to a fringe [...] reading in London because she's part of the Australian community. The play's about the {{relationship}} between King George the Sixth and his Australian speech therapist. She came back and said 'you've got to read this play,' <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> it and it was brilliant ...". Hooper cast Colin Firth as George VI and Geoffrey Rush as Lionel Logue and spent three weeks with the actors reading the script and rehearsing. Principal photography took place on location around the UK from November 2009 to January 2010. During editing, Hooper continued to consult with Firth and Rush by sending them cuts of the film and listening to their feedback.|$|E
500|$|Bernthal was {{extremely}} comfortable with his character on set. [...] "The second {{he opened his}} mouth and started reading the scene, I knew it was him," [...] he said. [...] "There was no question. I saw Frank and I knew it. He's the guy. He's a wonderful actor, and he's going to kill it in this role." [...] Bernthal admitted that he had no prior knowledge of The Walking Dead. He reminisced that he reacted so [...] "organically" [...] to the script that he [...] "didn't want to be colored by anything else. When I did read the comic, I was shocked. Look, I'm not going to sit here and regret. One {{of the great things about}} doing TV versus film is to be surprised yourself, to not let where you're going color where you are." [...] The pilot episode's script was amongst several other scripts for proposed television pilots that Bernthal skimmed through; He felt that this script overshadowed the others. [...] " [...] pilot season, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> everything that was out there. I still remember the day that I got this script. I told my agent that I'd be thrilled to be an extra in this, it's so good. It just blew the rest of them right out of the water." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} idea {{was written by}} Jeffrey Reddick as a spec script for The X-Files {{in order to get}} a TV agent. [...] "I was actually flying home to Kentucky <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> a story about a woman who was on vacation and her mom called her and said, 'Don’t take the flight tomorrow, I have a really bad feeling about it.’ She switched flights and the plane that she would have been on crashed," [...] said Reddick. [...] "I thought, that’s creepy—what if she was supposed to die on that flight?" [...] Building on his idea, Reddick wrote script and got an agent, but never submitted the script to The X-Files after a colleague at New Line Cinema suggested he write it as a feature film. [...] One of the biggest misconceptions about the project is that it was based on the real-life disaster of TWA Flight 800 that occurred in 1996. Like in the movie, the TWA disaster involved a Boeing 747 that exploded after take-off from JFK International Airport in New York en route to Paris. [...] Moreover, five chaperones and sixteen high school students from Montoursville, Pennsylvania, were aboard the doomed flight, heading to Paris with their high school French club. The TV spec script for The X-Files [...] however, was actually written in 1994.|$|E
500|$|In August 2012, Marvel signed Joss Whedon to an {{exclusive}} contract through June 2015 for film and television. With the deal, Whedon would [...] "contribute creatively" [...] on Phase Two of the MCU {{and develop the}} first television series set in the universe. In March 2013, Whedon expanded on his consulting responsibilities, saying, [...] "I understand what Kevin [...] is going for and where he's heading, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> the scripts and watch cuts {{and talk to the}} directors and writers and give my opinion. Occasionally there could be some writing. But I'm not trying to get in anybody's soup, I'm just trying to be helpful." [...] Whedon later elaborated that [...] "Since the story has already been approved and everybody knows what we're doing with Avengers 2, we can really lay it out. It's not like anyone's saying [...] "well I don't know, what if I need that?" [...] It's like [...] "doing this is troublesome for us, whereas doing this will actually help us." ... You want to honor {{the events of the last}} movie but you don't want to be beholden to them, because some people will see Avengers who did not see any of the movies in between or even Avengers 1." [...] He also found working in television and script doctoring to be [...] "great training ground for dealing with this ... because you're given a bunch of pieces and told to make them fit—even if they don't." ...|$|E
500|$|Minogue {{has been}} {{recognized}} {{with a number of}} honorific nicknames. She has been compared to American recording artist Madonna in many media outlets, with Madonna identified as Queen of Pop and Minogue as the Princess of Pop. Birmingham Post said in 2000; [...] "nce upon a time, long before anybody had even heard of Britney, Christina, Jessica or Mandy, Australian singer Kylie Minogue ruled the charts as princess of pop. Back in 1988 her first single, I Should Be So Lucky, spent five weeks at number one, making her the most successful female artist in the UK charts with 13 successive Top 10 entries." [...] She is sometimes referred to as the Goddess of Pop/Pop Goddess. She has also been dubbed a Disco Queen. William Baker, co-author of her book , talking about her song [...] "Better the Devil You Know", commented, [...] "The track transferred well onto the dance-floor and heralded a long reign for Kylie as the new queen of disco... a pop princess." [...] Jon O'Brien from Allmusic reviewed her box-set [...] and stated [...] "Kylie has yet to make that one essential album, and the going-through-the-motions nature of her later releases suggests her time may have passed, but this box set still contains plenty of moments to justify her position as one of the all-time premier pop princesses." [...] In November 2011, on the twenty-fifth anniversary of the ARIA Music Awards, she was inducted by the Australian Recording Industry Association into the ARIA Hall of Fame. Many celebrities have named Minogue as a role model. Many media outlets have said many people, particularly woman, have undergone regular checks for cancer symptoms since her breast cancer diagnosis. In December 2006, Sugar named her the Most Inspirational Celebrity as voted by teenage girls. Editor of the magazine Annabel Brog stated, [...] " [...] couldn't be any more inspirational. She's friendly, gorgeous, talented – and this year she's shown just how strong she is too." [...] Television host Giuliana Rancic cited Minogue's cancer story as [...] "inspirational" [...] when she too was diagnosed with cancer. She said, [...] "When you get diagnosed, you don't know what to do… you Google. I went online <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> your story, and it gave me the strength to go public as well." [...] Musical entertainers who have cited Minogue as an influence include September, Diana Vickers, Paris Hilton, and The Veronicas.|$|E

So I think the idea of people overcoming adversity by using their own resources was strongly imprinted in me by those books, because those guys had nothing except their own strength and their own mind power.

And he's not, not as understanding of my pettiness about that. But why should we hear about body bags and deaths, and how many, what day it's gonna happen, and how many this or that or what do you suppose? Or, I mean, it's not relevant. So, why should I waste my beautiful mind on something like that, and watch him suffer.|$|E

Later on when asked why she did this, Dora said that she was moved [...] "to see how hard they worked" [...] and that she was also impressed by Escriva and his teaching. [...] Commenting on Escriva's The Way, Dora recalled, [...] "I was very enthused by ... With each thing that I heard, I thought, 'This is for me.'

2500|$|Meir {{was one of}} 24 signatories (including two women) of the Israeli Declaration of Independence on May 14, 1948. She later recalled, [...] "After I signed, I cried. When I studied American {{history as}} a schoolgirl <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> about those who signed the U.S. Declaration of Independence, I couldn't imagine these were real people doing {{something}} real. And there I was sitting down and signing a declaration of establishment." [...] Israel was attacked the next day by the joint armies of neighboring countries in what became the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. During the war, Israel stopped the combined Arab assault, and then it launched a series of military offensives to defeat the invading Arab armies and to end the war.|$|E
2500|$|Fiennes {{stated that}} he had two weeks to shoot the climactic {{showdown}} scene where he is gloating over a terrified Harry, played by Daniel Radcliffe. Fiennes said with a chuckle: [...] "I have no doubt children will be afraid of me now if they weren't before." [...] In preparation, he read the novel Goblet of Fire, but jokingly conceded: [...] "I was only interested in my scene, and I {{had to go through}} thousands and thousands of other scenes which I did, dutifully, until I got to my scene <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> it many, many, many, many, many times and that was my research." [...] Fiennes reprised his role as Voldemort in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1 and Part 2.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2008, it was {{announced}} that Lords had been cast in Kevin Smith's comedy Zack and Miri Make a Porno (2008). She said that at first she wanted to refuse but changed her mind after reading the script. [...] "It was really great that in taking the movie, because I didn't plan on going back to work right away, but I was dying to work with Kevin. I never thought it would be on something called Zack and Miri Make a Porno. What? So I went <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> the script at his house and I was prepared to say no. I thought I have the perfect out. I just had a kid. No one is going to blame me if I say I just can't do this right now. But it made me laugh out loud and it made me just literally cry. It was just funny." [...] Initially, Lords had a topless scene in the movie, but refused since she would breastfeed in between the takes. Katie Morgan, another former pornographic actress, also appeared in the film.|$|E

2500|$|Scouting for a {{supporting}} cast to play opposite her began. Dan Castellaneta, a relative unknown, {{was asked to}} read for the show after he was spotted by Ullman at Chicago's Second City. Castellaneta's portrayal of a blind {{man who wants to}} be a comedian brought her to tears instead of making her laugh. Actress Julie Kavner had co-starred in Brook's spin-off series to The Mary Tyler Moore Show, Rhoda, starring Valerie Harper. Kavner played Harper's younger, socially awkward sister Brenda, a role for which she won an Emmy Award. Kavner was at the top of the list of people Brooks wanted to be part of the show. Brooks on Kavner: [...] "When somebody's intrinsically funny -- you know, in-their-bones funny -- they never have to work at (being funny), so they're free to work on other things. We were all nuts about her work. She was the person we most wanted to work with Tracey." [...] Actor Sam McMurray read for a guest spot on the show playing William, lover of thirteen-year-old valley girl Francesca's (Ullman) father. McMurray recalling his casting: [...] "The first Francesca sketch, they said, 'Play the guy not so gay.' And I said 'I disagree.' I had a big mouth then -— still do. I said, 'I think he’s more the woman. I think he's more out there.' So I read <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>read</b> it big, and they cast me. It was just a one-off, and then we were on hiatus. I did the one week, and I had a friend coincidentally who used to write, a guy named Marc Flanagan, and he was on the show as a staff guy. He called me up and said, 'Did they call your agent?' I said, 'No, why?' He said, 'They wanna make you a regular.'" [...] Another actor who was originally cast for a guest shot which led to becoming a series regular was choreographer Joseph Malone. [...] The show now had its cast.|$|E
