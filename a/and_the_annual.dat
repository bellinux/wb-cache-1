5|$|Metanephrops challengeri is {{currently}} listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, {{due in part}} to the Quota Management System put in place by the New Zealand government. The species does appear to be declining, however, based both on burrow counts and analyses of catch per unit effort. Estimates of the total population size of M.challengeri vary depending on the methods used. Based on indirect measures, such as burrow counts, there may be as many as 28million individuals, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>annual</b> catch might represent only 2%–4% of the total population. Using more reliable figures based on those animals seen during surveys, there may be only 2–11million individuals available to trawlers, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>annual</b> catch may remove 12%–28% of that population. Bycatch from the New Zealand scampi fishery has included the New Zealand sea lion, Phocarctos hookeri, which is considered a vulnerable species by the IUCN.|$|E

5|$|Malvern {{lies in the}} Lower Severn/Avon plain affording it {{a degree}} of shelter caused {{by virtue of its}} {{nestling}} in between the Cotswold hills to the east, the Welsh Hills and Mountains to the west, and Birmingham plateau to the north.

The record maximum stands at 35.8c(96.4f) set in August 1990. Typically 17.3 days of the year will reach 25.1c(77.2f) or higher <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>annual</b> warmest day should reach 29.8c(85.6f) according to the 1971–00 observing period.|$|E
5|$|Norsk Vinterturistforening {{was founded}} in 1899 to work towards {{encouraging}} English tourists to visit Oslo, specifically by building tobogganing tracks. A committee was established in 1904 to look into building a new tobogganing track in the Holmenkollen area. It proposed that two new tracks be built, one from Voksenkollveien to Peisestuen, and one from Peisestuen to Midtstuen, and that Korketrekkeren be upgraded to allow for safer tobogganing. The investments cost 7,000 Norwegian krone (NOK) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>annual</b> operating costs estimated at NOK2,000.
