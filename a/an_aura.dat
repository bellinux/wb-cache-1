5|$|An {{articulate}} {{expression of}} Greek republicanism {{can be found}} in the works of the revolutionary author Rigas Feraios. Feraios' execution in 1798 at the hands of the Ottomans gave <b>an</b> <b>aura</b> of heroism to these political ideas, which also visualized the liberation of Greece in the context of political reforms. In addition to Feraios' writings, other works in the same polemical style took on a sharper revolutionary character, as social contradictions in the Ottoman Empire grew.|$|E
5|$|The Wizard Tower is {{the place}} where the ExtraOrdinary Wizard (Marcia Overstrand) resides along with Ordinary Wizards and the ExtraOrdinary Apprentice (Septimus Heap). Built by the first ExtraOrdinary Wizard, Hotep-Ra, it is a purple 21-floor tower with a gold pyramid at the top, {{surrounded}} by <b>an</b> <b>aura</b> of magyk. The Palace is the royal residence, home to Jenna, Sarah and Silas. It is much older than the Wizard Tower with secret places, such as the Queen's room, which is accessible only to the Queen or the Princess, and has a secret passage to the Marram Marshes.|$|E
5|$|Wessex kings carried <b>an</b> <b>aura</b> {{of power}} and success, which made them {{increasingly}} powerful in the 920s, while most Continental houses were in military trouble and engaged in internecine warfare. While the civil wars and the Viking attacks on the Continent had spelled the end of unity of the Carolingian empire, which had already disintegrated into separate kingdoms, military success had enabled Æthelstan to triumph at home and to attempt {{to go beyond the}} reputation of a great heroic dynasty of warrior kings, in order to develop a Carolingian ideology of kingship.|$|E

In ADEAF, family members have predominantly lateral temporal lobe seizures but mesial temporal lobe semiology may also occur. We report here three families with novel LGI 1 mutations (p.

Amongst the shades of greys, {{interactive}} objects are highlighted by <b>an</b> <b>aura</b> shining {{in one of}} several colours, with the colour of the aura indicating his potential interaction: orange characters can be possessed, red characters strangled, blue objects (or characters with environmental effects) knocked around, and green characters healed. Jodie frequently calls upon Aiden to provide different abilities, such as form a protective shield around her, allow the dead {{to speak to the}} living through her, grant her an ability to see events of the recent past, and enable her to heal a character's wounds.|$|E
5|$|As the 1990s began, Pei transitioned into a role of {{decreased}} {{involvement with}} his firm. The staff {{had begun to}} shrink, and Pei wanted to dedicate himself to smaller projects allowing for more creativity. Before he made this change, however, he set {{to work on his}} last major project as active partner: The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio. Considering his work on such bastions of high culture as the Louvre and US National Gallery, some critics were surprised by his association with what many considered a tribute to low culture. The sponsors of the hall, however, sought Pei for specifically this reason; they wanted the building to have <b>an</b> <b>aura</b> of respectability from the beginning. As in the past, Pei accepted the commission {{in part because of the}} unique challenge it presented.|$|E
5|$|Under the new constitution, Zimbabwe's Presidency was a {{ceremonial}} role with no governmental power; the first President was Canaan Banana. Mugabe had previously offered {{the position to}} Nkomo, who had turned it down in favour of becoming Minister of Home Affairs. Although working together, there remained <b>an</b> <b>aura</b> of resentment and suspicion between Mugabe and Nkomo. Mugabe gave ZAPU four cabinet seats, but Nkomo demanded more. In contrast, some ZANU-PF figures argued that ZAPU should not have any seats in government, suggesting that Zimbabwe be converted into a one-party state. Tekere and Enos Nkala were particularly adamant {{that there should be}} a crackdown on ZAPU. After Nkala called for ZAPU to be violently crushed during a rally in Entumbane, street clashes between the two parties broke out in the city.|$|E

5|$|Ba Cụt {{was born}} circa 1923 in Long Xuyên, a {{regional}} {{town in the}} Mekong Delta, in the far south of Vietnam. He was orphaned {{at an early age}} and adopted by a local peasant family. Ba Cụt was illiterate and was known from childhood as a temperamental and fiery person. The family's rice paddies were confiscated by a prominent landlord, the father of Nguyễn Ngọc Thơ. Ba Cụt's bitter personal experience imbued him with a permanent and fanatical hatred towards landowners. Thơ rose to become a leading politician in the 1950s and {{played a key role in}} Ba Cụt's eventual capture and execution. <b>An</b> <b>aura</b> of mystery surrounded Ba Cụt during his life, and foreign journalists incorrectly reported that he had severed his finger as part of a vow to defeat the French. As Ba Cụt became more fanatical in his religious beliefs and spent increasing time with local religious men, Ba Cụt's father demanded that he work more in the family's rice fields. A defiant Ba Cụt severed his index finger, which was necessary for work in the rice paddies.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{illegality}} of unions, the Syndicate {{maintained its}} network of workers through informal means. The {{latter half of}} 2004 symbolized a more organized Syndicate, giving it <b>an</b> <b>aura</b> of legitimacy not seen since its pre-1979 condition. Worker grievances once concealed by anti-union institutions, were now surfacing through the aid of union leaders such as Mansour Osanlou.|$|E

Communication is telepathic, travel instantaneous. There's no need to eat or sleep.

25|$|Leonid Brezhnev's {{years in}} power marked the height of party-military {{cooperation}} as he provided ample resources to the armed forces. In 1973 the minister of defense became a full Politburo member {{for the first time}} since 1957. Yet Brezhnev evidently felt threatened by the professional military, and he sought to create <b>an</b> <b>aura</b> of military leadership around himself in an effort to establish his authority over the armed forces.|$|E

25|$|Ever {{since the}} era of silent films, smoking has had a major part in film symbolism. In the hard-boiled film noir crime thrillers, {{cigarette}} smoke often frames characters and is frequently used to add <b>an</b> <b>aura</b> of mystique or nihilism. One of the forerunners of this symbolism {{can be seen in}} Fritz Lang's Weimar era Dr Mabuse, der Spieler, 1922 (Dr Mabuse, the Gambler), where men mesmerized by card playing smoke cigarettes while gambling.|$|E
25|$|VanDerZee worked {{predominantly}} in {{the studio}} and used a variety of props, including architectural elements, backdrops, and costumes, to achieve stylized tableaux vivant in keeping with late Victorian and Edwardian visual traditions. Sitters often copied celebrities of the 1920s and 1930s in their poses and expressions, and he retouched negatives and prints heavily to achieve <b>an</b> <b>aura</b> of glamour. He also created funeral photographs between the wars. These works were later collected in The Harlem Book of the Dead (1978), with a foreword by Toni Morrison.|$|E
25|$|Works by VanDerZee are artistic {{as well as}} {{technically}} proficient. His {{work was}} in high demand, {{in part due to}} his experimentation and skill in double exposures and in retouching negatives of children. One theme that recurs in his photographs was the emergent black middle class, which he captured using traditional techniques in often idealistic images. Negatives were retouched to show glamor and <b>an</b> <b>aura</b> of perfection. This affected the likeness of the person photographed, but he felt each photo should transcend the subject.|$|E

Then the king, {{in a move that}} would influence the fate of the kingdom for more than a century, turned to the traditional enemies of the Franks, the Bavarii, to marry a princess, Theodelinda, from the Lethings dynasty (i.e. descended from Wacho, king of the Lombards between 510 and 540 and a figure surrounded by <b>an</b> <b>aura</b> of legend, a member of a royal line of great ascendency over the Lombards).|$|E
25|$|Vance's {{science fiction}} runs {{the gamut from}} stories written for pulps in the 1940s to multi-volume tales set in the space age. While Vance's stories have {{a wide variety of}} {{temporal}} settings, a majority of them belong to a period long after humanity has colonized other stars, culminating {{in the development of a}} region of interstellar space called the Gaean Reach. In its early phase, exhibited by the Oikumene of the Demon Princes series, this expanding, loose and pacific agglomerate has <b>an</b> <b>aura</b> of colonial adventure, commerce and exoticism. Later it becomes peace-loving and stolidly middle class.|$|E
25|$|Genghis Khan, {{leader of}} the Mongolian Empire in the 13th century AD {{employed}} less subtle techniques. Defeating {{the will of the}} enemy before having to attack and reaching a consented settlement was preferable to actually fighting. The Mongol generals demanded submission to the Khan, and threatened the initially captured villages with complete destruction if they refused to surrender. If they had to fight to take the settlement, the Mongol generals fulfilled their threats and massacred the survivors. Tales of the encroaching horde spread to the next villages and created <b>an</b> <b>aura</b> of insecurity that undermined the possibility of future resistance.|$|E
