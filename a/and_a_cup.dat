25|$|The club draws {{its history}} {{from the very start}} of the Soviet {{football}} league competitions {{and is one of the}} oldest clubs in Ukraine. The club was a member of the Soviet Voluntary Sports Society of Shakhtyor, having connections with other Soviet teams from Karaganda (Kazakhstan), Soligorsk (Belarus), among others. In the late Soviet period, Shakhtar was considered a tough mid-table club of the Soviet Top League <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> competition specialist after winning the Soviet Cup two years in a row in 1961 and 1962.|$|E

25|$|In 1975 Nikis Georgiou {{proposed}} {{creating a}} volleyball team in Limassol {{to preserve the}} club since many Nea Salamis fans moved there after the occupation the year before. The volleyball team (created in 1976) is one of 20 charter members of the Cyprus Volleyball Federation, {{which was founded in}} 1978. In Nea Salamis' first Cyprus Volleyball Division 1 season the team finished second, also finishing second in 1981 and 1982. In 1981, they lost the championship on a points difference. In 1983 Nea Salamis won its first club-level cup final, defeating Anorthosis 3–1. The team won its first championship (and its second cup) in 1989–90, followed by another championship the next season <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> the season after that.|$|E
25|$|At 20 {{months of}} age, when {{presented}} with three familiar objects (e.g., a ball, a bottle <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup)</b> and one unfamiliar object (e.g., an egg piercer), children are able to conclude that in the request “Can I have the zib,” zib must refer to the unfamiliar object, i.e., the egg piercer, {{even if they have}} never heard that pseudoword before. Children as young as 15 months can complete this task successfully if the experiment is conducted with fewer objects. This task shows that children aged 15 to 20 months can assign meaning to a new word after only a single exposure. Fast mapping is a necessary ability for children to acquire the number of words they have to learn during {{the first few years of}} life: Children acquire an average of nine words per day between 18 months and 6 years of age.|$|E
25|$|Hungarian Pál Csernai, who {{had been}} {{assistant}} to Cramer's replacement, Gyula Lorant, became head coach. In his tenure, he revolutionised the style of Bayern by introducing the spatial defence, then in Munich referred to as Pal System. When Paul Breitner returned via Braunschweig from his years with Real Madrid, he formed a partnership with Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. The FC Breitnigge, reinforced with Belgian goalkeeping legend Jean-Marie Pfaff, Klaus Augenthaler and striker Dieter Hoeneß (brother of Uli), brought success back to Munich. Two championships <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> resulted from this era. Their dreams of another European Cup were thwarted in the final of Rotterdam against Aston Villa, when {{for a brief moment}} a man named Peter Withe stepped out of obscurity and scored the decider for the team from Birmingham. This was also the first official final that Bayern had lost in its history after 12 undefeated final appearances.|$|E

25|$|After a {{transfer}} dispute with former side Sliema Wanderers saw Buttigieg designated a free agent, {{he returned to}} the Maltese Premier League to sign for Floriana in 1991. He was named captain and won the double in the 1992–93 season <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> treble in 1993–94. In the 1993–94 season, Buttigieg was part of the Floriana team which was the first (and as of 2014, only) Maltese side to qualify for the first round proper of the Champions League. Buttigieg scored both goals in a 2–0 win over Lithuanian champions Ekranas in the qualifying round, which set the Greens up with a two-legged tie against Portuguese club Porto in the first round. Floriana went out 2–0 on aggregate, but salvaged some pride with a 0–0 draw at the Ta' Qali Stadium in the second leg. He also represented Floriana in the Intertoto Cup and the qualifying rounds of the Cup Winners' Cup and the UEFA Cup. By the time he departed Floriana in 1999, Buttigieg had made 155 league appearances and scored eight goals for the club. He held talks over the club's vacant manager's job in October 2009, but the position went to Stephen Azzopardi.|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} {{buildings at}} Watford Gap {{were designed by}} Harry W Weedon and Partners, already well known for their work for Odeon Cinemas. The restaurant opened in September 1960, but the Ministry were unhappy about the services' reputation as a truck-stop, dating back to Blue Boar's popularity with HGV drivers. They consequently redesigned the restaurant in 1964 to accommodate a waitress service, which they hoped would [...] "lose {{at least some of}} the stigma of having been started in 1959 as primarily a commercial driver's facility". Food was criticised for being expensive, though Tam Galbraith disputed this, noting he could buy steak and kidney pie with chips, buttered roll <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> of tea at Watford Gap for 4s 2d (£ today).|$|E

It was {{claimed to}} be better for digestion, and even that the [...] "pure" [...] coffee {{did not have the}} wakefulness effect of coffee from ground beans (a direct effect of caffeine content, present in both forms). After World War I ended, the American military's use of the coffee became another selling point. A different avenue for promotion came when the company sponsored The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes radio series on NBC and its Blue Network from 1930 to 1935, which started with Dr. Watson welcoming listeners to his recollections told by [...] "a blazing fire <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> of G Washington brewing."

500|$|Captured, Pechersky soon {{contracted}} typhus, but {{survived the}} seven-month-long illness. In May 1942, he escaped along {{with four other}} prisoners of war, {{but they were all}} recaptured the same day. He was then sent to a penal camp at Borisov, Belarus, and from there to a prisoners of war (POW) camp located in the forest next to the city of Minsk. During a mandatory medical examination it was discovered that he was circumcised. Pechersky recalled a German medical officer asking him: [...] "Do you admit to being a Jew?" [...] He admitted it, since any denial would result in a whipping, and was thrown into a cellar called [...] "the Jewish grave" [...] along with other Jewish POWs (prisoners of war), where for 10 days he sat in complete darkness, being fed 100grams (3.5oz) of wheat <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> of water every second day.|$|E
500|$|As {{the first}} major victory in the naval war for the British, the capture raised the shaken morale of the Royal Navy. After setting out on 5 September for a brief cruise under a Captain Teahouse, Shannon {{departed}} for England on 4 October, carrying the recovering Broke. They arrived at Portsmouth on 2 November. After the successful action Lieutenants Wallis and Falkiner were promoted {{to the rank of}} commander, and Messrs. Etough and Smith were made lieutenants. Broke was made a Baronet that September. [...] The Court of Common Council of London awarded him the freedom of the city and a sword worth 100 guineas. He also received a piece of plate worth 750 pounds <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> worth 100 guineas. [...] Captain Lawrence was buried in Halifax with full military honours, six British Naval Officers served as pall bearers. [...] Chesapeake, after active service in the Royal Navy, was eventually sold at Portsmouth, England, for £500 in 1819 and broken up. Some of the timbers of Chesapeake were used {{in the construction of the}} Chesapeake Mill in Wickham, Hampshire. Shannon was reduced to a receiving ship in 1831, and broken up in 1859.|$|E

[...] "I used to give him a chair <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> of coffee, and he told me about the fight at the O.K. Corral. So in My Darling Clementine, we did it exactly the way it had been." [...] When Ford was working on his last silent feature Hangman's House in 1928, which {{included}} the first credited screen appearances by John Wayne, Earp used to visit the set. John Wayne later told Hugh O'Brian that he based his Western lawman walk, talk and persona to his acquaintance with Wyatt Earp, who was good friends with Mix. [...] "I knew him... I often thought of Wyatt Earp when I played a film character. There's a guy that actually did what I'm trying to do." [...] Wyatt Earp's character has been the central figure in 10 films and featured in many more.

500|$|Finding {{accommodation}} {{was one of}} {{the greatest}} challenges faced by black travelers. Not only did many hotels, motels, and boarding houses refuse to serve black customers, but thousands of towns across the United States declared themselves [...] "sundown towns," [...] which all non-whites had to leave by sunset. Huge numbers of towns across the country were effectively off-limits to African Americans. By the end of the 1960s, there were at least 10,000 sundown towns across the U.S.– including large suburbs such as Glendale, California (population 60,000 at the time); Levittown, New York (80,000); and Warren, Michigan (180,000). Over half the incorporated communities in Illinois were sundown towns. The unofficial slogan of Anna, Illinois, which had violently expelled its African-American population in 1909, was [...] "Ain't No Niggers Allowed". Even in towns which did not exclude overnight stays by blacks, accommodations were often very limited. African Americans migrating to California to find work in the early 1940s often found themselves camping by the roadside overnight for lack of any hotel accommodation along the way. They were acutely aware of the discriminatory treatment that they received. Courtland Milloy's mother, who took him and his brother on road trips when they were children, recalled that [...] "after riding all day, I'd say to myself, 'Wouldn't it be nice if we could spend the night in one of those hotels?' or, 'Wouldn't it be great if we could stop for a real meal <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> of coffee?'
