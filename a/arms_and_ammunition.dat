5|$|In April 2009, donors at a UN-sponsored conference pledged over $250 {{million to}} help improve security. The funds were {{earmarked}} for AMISOM and supporting Somalia's security, including the build-up of a security force of 6,000 members {{as well as an}} augmented police force of 10,000 men. In June 2009, the Somali military received 40 tonnes worth of <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> <b>ammunition</b> from the U.S. government to assist it in combating the insurgency.|$|E
5|$|The RPF advance caused {{panic in}} France, which had long {{supported}} the Habyarimana regime. Several hundred French troops were immediately dispatched to Rwanda, along with <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> <b>ammunition,</b> {{to bolster the}} FAR forces. The arrival of these French troops in Kigali significantly changed the military situation on the ground. The RPF now found themselves under attack, with French shells bombarding them as they advanced southwards.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{strategy}} planned by Manekshaw, the army launched several preparatory operations in East Pakistan including training and equipping the Mukti Bahini (a local group of Bengali nationalists). About three brigades of regular Bangladesh troops were trained. As an additional measure, 75,000 guerrillas were trained and equipped with <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> <b>ammunition.</b> These forces {{were used to}} sporadically harass the Pakistani Army stationed in East Pakistan in the lead up to the war.|$|E

5|$|Among {{other events}} in the United States that {{have been linked to}} the {{conspiracy}} is the Black Tom explosion when, on the night of 30 July 1916, saboteurs blew up nearly 2 million tons of <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> <b>ammunition</b> at the Black Tom terminal at New York harbour awaiting shipment in support of the British war effort. Although blamed solely on German agents at the time, later investigations by the Directorate of Naval Intelligence {{in the aftermath of the}} Annie Larsen incident unearthed links between the Black Tom explosion and Franz von Papen, the Irish movement, the Indian movement as well as Communist elements active in the United States.|$|E
5|$|During the Saxon {{campaign}} of 1813, Walther continued {{command of the}} Guard Cavalry, and {{was present at the}} Battle of Lützen and Battle of Dresden, as commander of the Guard cavalry. At the Second Battle of Kulm (17 September 1813), he commanded the Imperial Guard Cavalry including the dragoons, Grenadiers à Cheval, and 1st (Polish) and 2nd (Dutch) Lancers. At the Battle of Leipzig, he commanded the 3rd Division of the cavalry of the Imperial Guard: The total cavalry of the Guard included 7,903men and 18guns. After refitting and resupply at Erfurt, where Napoleon had stashed a large depot of <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> <b>ammunition,</b> the French army continued to withdraw through western Germany, toward the Rhine.|$|E
5|$|In April 1942, the German Commanding General in Serbia, General der Artillerie (General) Paul Bader, issued orders giving unit numbers C39 to C101 to the Pećanac Chetnik detachments, {{which were}} put {{under the command}} of the local German {{division}} or area command post. These orders also required the deployment of a German liaison officer with all detachments engaged in operations, and limited their movement outside their assigned area. Supply of <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> <b>ammunition</b> was also controlled. In July 1942, Mihailović arranged for the Yugoslav government-in-exile to denounce Pećanac as a traitor. His continuing collaboration ruined what remained of the reputation he had developed in the Balkan Wars and World War I.|$|E
50|$|In this {{encounter}} that continued {{for about two}} hours, the police party had to retreat. Satapathy fought bravely till his last breath and laid down his life in fighting the militants. A large quantity of <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> <b>ammunitions</b> was recovered from the site.|$|R
50|$|Elephant {{poaching}} represents another {{threat to}} the park.

5|$|The Croatian {{government}} attacked JNA garrisons {{and arms}} depots {{throughout the country}} on 14 September– an offensive dubbed the Battle of the Barracks. Vukovar's JNA barracks {{was one of those}} attacked that day, but the JNA managed to defend it. In retaliation, Serb paramilitaries attacked areas to the southwest of Vukovar from the direction of Negoslavci, forcing about 2,000 people to flee. There were reports of mass killings and scores of civilian deaths. Croatian forces outside the Vukovar perimeter received large quantities of <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> <b>ammunition</b> from depots captured elsewhere, enabling them to hold the line against JNA attacks.|$|E
5|$|The Finns {{relied on}} {{military}} assistance from Sweden, and Eljas Erkko {{took part in}} the Stockholm assembly of Scandinavian leaders between 18 October and 19 October. There, Erkko met the Swedish foreign minister Rickard Sandler in private, and Sandler assured him that he would persuade the Swedish government to assist Finland during a possible war. During the actual war, however, Sandler failed in this task and resigned. Finland was totally isolated by a German and Soviet blockade, and attempted in October to obtain <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> <b>ammunition</b> in absolute secrecy by enlisting the German arms dealer Josef Veltjens.|$|E
5|$|During {{an action}} on 1 March 1968, {{in the early}} morning several Squadron One cutters were {{involved}} in the interdiction and destruction of four North Vietnamese trawlers attempting to smuggle <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> <b>ammunition</b> into South Vietnam at different locations. This co-ordinated attempt by the North Vietnamese was met by various elements of TF115; including U.S. Navy aircraft and vessels, RVN junks, U.S. Air Force aircraft, and U.S. Army helicopters. In addition, there were several Owasco-class cutter cutters from Coast Guard Squadron Three– , , and – as well as Point Grey, Point Hudson, and Point Welcome from Squadron One. As a result of this action, three North Vietnamese trawlers were destroyed and a fourth was turned back before it could reach the coast. After this action the incidence of smuggling by trawler was decreased and Communist forces had to resort to shipments along the Ho Chi Minh trail or through the port of Sihanoukville in Cambodia.|$|E
50|$|Jugantar, {{along with}} other revolutionary groups, and aided by Indians abroad, planned an armed revolt against the British rulers during the First World War. This plan largely {{depended}} on the clandestine landing of German <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> <b>ammunitions</b> in the Indian coast. This plan {{came to be known}} as the Indo-German Plot. However, the planned revolt did not materialise.|$|R
50|$|Other {{centers of}} culture include the “Maestro Fermín López” Municipal Library and Museum, housing {{personal}} belongings of Fermín López <b>and</b> Natalicio Talavera; <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> <b>ammunitions</b> from the Chaco War, {{a collection of}} Paraguayan coins and bills, {{as well as other}} artifacts: native arrows, axes and bows, old furniture, machines, paintings, photographs and pieces of religious art.|$|R
5000|$|Jitendra Nath {{through his}} Ghadar {{connections}} came {{in touch with}} Jatin Mukherjee, better known as “Bagha Jatin”, one of the extremist leaders in the Indian Freedom movement. Jitendra Nath operated out of the underground units in Germany {{and was one of}} the key facilitators in connecting the Indian extremist units with the Helferrich brothers in Germany. The hope was to mobilize <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> <b>ammunitions</b> strategically with German help and strategically oust British from India. Although his name did not come up in the leading list of revolutionaries associated with the Christmas Day Plot of 1915, he played a significant role behind the scenes. He was on board of the Maverick, the vessel which was responsible for shipping <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> <b>ammunitions</b> into India. However, owing to the unfortunate capture of “Bagha Jatin”, this mission was abandoned at the Bay of Bengal. Subsequently, Jitendra Nath went underground.|$|R
5|$|Luna also formed {{other units}} {{similar to the}} sharpshooters. One would be the unit, which would later be named after Bugallón, {{commanded}} by Rosendo Simón de Pajarillo. The unit emerged {{from a group of}} ten men wanting to volunteer in the regular Filipino army. Luna, still thinking of the defeat at the Battle of Caloocan, sent the men away at first. However, he soon changed his mind and decided to give the men an initiation. After taking breakfast, he ordered a subordinate, Colonel Queri, to prepare <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> <b>ammunition</b> for the ten men. Then, the men boarded a train destined towards Malinta, which was American-held territory. After giving orders to the men, he let them go and watched them with his telescope. The men, succeeding their mission, eventually returned unharmed. Admiring their bravery, he organized them into a guerrilla unit of around 50 members. This unit would see action in the Second Battle of Caloocan.|$|E
5|$|Not to {{be outdone}} by the Vietnamese {{military}} build-up, the Government of Democratic Kampuchea was busy strengthening its armed forces with Chinese support. In previous years, China had only provided the Kampuchean Revolutionary Army with {{a limited amount of}} <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> <b>ammunition,</b> but as relations with Vietnam worsened in 1978, Beijing established additional supply routes through Kampuchea and increased the volume of military hardware which travelled down each route. On the eve of the Vietnamese invasion, Kampuchea had an estimated 73,000 soldiers in the Eastern Military Zone bordering Vietnam. At that time, all branches of the Kampuchean armed forces were significantly strengthened by large quantities of Chinese-made military equipment, which included fighter aircraft, patrol boats, heavy artillery, anti-aircraft guns, trucks and tanks. Additionally, there were between 10,000 and 20,000 Chinese advisers in both military and civilian capacities, providing their support to the Khmer Rouge regime.|$|E
5|$|On 1 April 1944, Mickl was {{promoted}} to Generalleutnant. He identified that the Partisan 13th Division was using the Drežnica valley as a huge armoury, hiding captured Italian <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> <b>ammunition</b> in villages, basements, and even in fake graves in cemeteries. This was of major concern if the feared Allied landing eventuated. In mid-April, Mickl ordered Operation Keulenschlag (Mace Blow) to clear the area, using the 846th Infantry Regiment {{and parts of the}} 847th Infantry Regiment, supported by the divisional artillery and flak battalion. Over the next two weeks, the division pushed the Partisan 13th Division north to the area of Mrkopalj and Delnice, and captured sufficient material to equip two divisions, including 30 tons of small arms ammunition and 15 tons of artillery ammunition.|$|E
50|$|The {{objective}} of revolutionists {{was to get}} booty from the rich well-wishers of British Raj and to create problems for them. They had gathered camels, horses and formed a small army. Lothoo suggested his plan of attacking the Nasirabad cantonment. Nasirabad was one of biggest cantonments. There was a huge stock of <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> <b>ammunitions.</b> It had very tight security all around.|$|R

Above all the fall of Elephant Pass to the enemy would be catastrophic and counterproductive at a national level.|$|R
5|$|On July 18, 1998 a Yugoslav Army (VJ) {{border patrol}} ambushed over 200 Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) insurgents and foreign mujahideen {{just west of}} Dečani, on the {{frontier}} between Albania and Yugoslavia. The ambush resulted {{in the deaths of}} four KLA fighters and 18 mujahideen (mostly citizens of Saudi Arabia). Another six KLA fighters were arrested by the Yugoslav authorities and charged with illegal entry and gunrunning. The VJ reported seizing a significant amount of <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> <b>ammunition</b> that the militants had been smuggling. One Yugoslav border guard was seriously wounded in the clash. According to Israeli historian Shaul Shay, the ambush represented the first clash of the Kosovo War between the VJ and foreign mujahideen. Human Rights Watch advisor Fred C. Abrahams suggests {{it is possible that the}} mujahideen were deliberately led into a trap by the KLA as part of a plan to reduce the influence of Islamic extremists within the KLA's ranks.|$|E
5|$|The Huks {{began their}} anti-Japanese {{campaign}} as five 100-man units. They obtained needed <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> <b>ammunition</b> from Philippine army stragglers, which were escapees from the Battle of Bataan and deserters from the Philippine Constabulary, in exchange of civilian clothes. The Huk recruitment campaign progressed {{more slowly than}} Taruc had expected, due to competition with U.S. Army Forces Far East (USAFFE) guerrilla units in enlisting new soldiers. The U.S. units already had recognition among the islands, had trained military leaders, and an organized command and logistical system. Despite being restrained by the American sponsored guerrilla units, the Huks nevertheless took to the battlefield with only 500 men and much fewer weapons. Several setbacks {{at the hands of}} the Japanese and with less than enthusiastic support from USAFFE units did not hinder the Huks growth in size and efficiency throughout the war, developing into a well trained, highly organized force with some 15,000 armed fighters by war's end. The Huks attacked both the Japanese and other non-Huk guerrillas.|$|E
5|$|With {{only limited}} small <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> <b>ammunition</b> {{they moved to}} {{positions}} above Kalives {{on the shores of}} Suda Bay to undertake garrison duties in anticipation of a German attack on the island. Following the German invasion on 20 May 1941, some of these troops saw direct action against German paratroopers. After the Allied evacuation from the island a week later, they undertook active patrols around the island before being evacuated on 31 May 1941 aboard HMS Phoebe. They arrived in Alexandria on 1 June 1941. Two 2/3rd Battalion men were killed during the fighting on Crete, and one was wounded. Fifty became prisoners of war. Meanwhile, the rest of the battalion had concentrated in Palestine, where it was rebuilt in advance of its next campaign.|$|E

5|$|Peng {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} generals active in defending the Jiangxi Soviet, taking a leading role in defeating Chiang Kai-shek's first three Encirclement Campaigns, from December 1930 – May 1931. His successes were outmatched only by Lin Biao. On November 7, Peng was named to the Central Military Commission and to the Central Executive Committee of the Jiangxi Soviet, the first time that he had been named to a position of political leadership within the communist movement. After the consolidation of the Jiangxi Soviet, a number of USSR-trained Communist Party leaders arrived and took power in the Soviet: Peng, like most communist military leaders, supported their leadership until the Jiangxi Soviet was eventually overrun. In August 1933, Peng was named Vice-Chairman of the Central Military Commission; and, in January 1934, Peng was appointed as an alternate member to the Sixth CCP Central Committee. Peng continued the defense of the Jiangxi Soviet throughout the early 1930s. In August 1933, after the indecisive Fourth Encirclement Campaign, Peng broke through Kuomintang defenses and conquered a large area of western Fujian, capturing great quantities of <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> <b>ammunition.</b>|$|E
5|$|December 1915 {{also saw}} {{concrete}} {{progress on the}} mission's Turco-German objective. The Emir informed von Hentig {{he was ready to}} discuss a treaty of Afghan-German friendship, but said it would take time and require extensive historical research. Work on the treaty began with drafts proposed by von Hentig. The final draft of ten articles presented on 24 January 1916 included clauses recognising Afghan independence, a declaration of friendship with Germany, and establishment of diplomatic relations. Von Hentig was to be accredited the Embassy Secretary of the German Empire. In addition, the treaty would guarantee German assistance against Russian and British threats if Afghanistan joined the war on the Central side. The Emir's army was to be modernised, with Germany providing 100,000 modern rifles, 300 artillery pieces, and other modern warfare equipment. The Germans were to be responsible for maintaining advisors and engineers, and to maintain an overland supply route through Persia for <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> <b>ammunition.</b> Further, the Emir was to be paid £1,000,000. Both von Hentig and Niedermayer signed this document which created—as von Hentig argued in a telegram to the Foreign Office—an initial basis to prepare for an Afghan invasion of India. Niedermayer explained that the Emir intended to begin his campaign as soon as Germany could make available 20,000 troops to protect the Afghan-Russian front, and asked for urgently for wireless sets, a substantial shipment of arms, and at least a million pounds initial funding. He judged conditions to be ideal for an offensive into India, and informed the general staff to expect the campaign to begin in April.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Kupres was {{the first}} {{concrete}} result of the renewed BosniakCroat alliance in the Bosnian War, and the advance to Kupres {{was the first}} military effort coordinated between the ARBiH and the HVO since the Washington Agreement. Following the victory, morale of the ARBiH and the HVO soared. Further advantages for them were the recapture of initiative from the VRS and full control of the Split–Livno–Kupres–Bugojno road, allowing improved logistics of the ARBiH and the HVO in the area, as well as greater volume of transport of <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> <b>ammunition,</b> especially after the United States unilaterally ended the arms embargo against Bosnia and Herzegovina in November 1994. The move in effect allowed the HV to supply itself as the arms shipments flowed through Croatia. Finally, {{the outcome of the}} Battle of Kupres secured the right flank of the Livanjsko field, which became especially significant later that month when Operation Winter '94 was launched by the HV and the HVO northwest of Livno in order to draw off a part of the force besieging Bihać and prevent capture of Bihać by the VRS. The battle {{is considered to be a}} significant contribution to subsequent success of the HV in the Croatian War of Independence and the Bosnian War.|$|E
50|$|Anticipating secession, {{a number}} of Southern states asked for their quota of <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> <b>ammunitions</b> to be shipped from the St. Louis Arsenal to state armories and arsenals. Buchanan's Secretary of War, John B. Floyd, a Virginian, was accused of aiding in this {{transfer}} of <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> resigned his post in December 1860 to return to Virginia. An investigation cleared him, but many suspected that his involvement had helped arm the Confederate States of America and prepare it for war in advance of actual ordinances of secession from the individual states.|$|R
