The report alleged the ruse Somerset used was the Prince's fondness for buhl furniture: he invited him to inspect a buhl cabinet which was in the house, and that the Prince remained there no more than five minutes.|$|E
5|$|An Allied council met on 1 December {{to discuss}} {{proposals}} for the battle. Most of the Allied strategists had two fundamental ideas in mind: making {{contact with the}} enemy and securing the southern flank that held the communication line to Vienna. Although the Tsar and his immediate entourage pushed hard for a battle, Emperor Francis of Austria was more cautious and, as mentioned, he was seconded by Kutuzov, the Commander-in-chief of the Russians and the Allied troops. The pressure to fight from the Russian nobles and the Austrian commanders, however, was too strong, and the Allies adopted the plan of the Austrian Chief-of-Staff, Franz von Weyrother. This called for a main drive against the French right flank, which the Allies noticed was lightly guarded, and diversionary attacks against the French left. The Allies deployed most of their troops into four columns that would attack the French right. The Russian Imperial Guard was held in reserve while Russian troops under Bagration guarded the Allied right. The Russian Tsar rudely stripped the authority of Commander-in-chief M. I. Kutuzov {{and gave it to}} Franz von Weyrother. In the battle, Kutuzov could only command the IV Corps of the Allied army, although he was still the de facto commander because the Tsar was <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> over in case his favoured plan failed.|$|E

25|$|Alvertis was {{regarded}} {{for a long}} time {{as one of the best}} perimeter shooters in Europe. His shooting style, combined with his height, made him very hard to defend. His lack of athleticism did not allow him to show great regularity; nevertheless, he was never <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> clutch shots, and he was very often successful. He was also an above-average defender. He sometimes played at the power forward position in Panathinaikos, over the last 5years of his career, due to his height and size, although his all-around skills were quite average.|$|E

In doing so, he fostered close relationships with CEOs such as Henry Ford II, leading some blacks to charge that Young had sold out to the white establishment. Young denied these charges and stressed the importance of working within the system to effect change. Still, Young was not <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a bold stand in favor of civil rights. For instance, in 1963, Young was one of the organizers of the March on Washington despite the opposition of many white business leaders.|$|E

After the Empress Nü Kua defeated Kung Kung, the phoenix chose to return to his egg and await a time of peace when his power would not be misused {{and the role of the}} Guardian is created to protect the phoenix.

500|$|Myrie-Williams is {{generally}} deployed as a winger, and can play on either flank. He is predominantly left-footed, {{and has been}} used on the wing {{for the majority of}} his career. Despite being left-footed, Myrie-Williams states that he is much more comfortable on the right wing— cutting inside and getting a shot on goal. He has been described as being [...] "blessed with searing pace and an impressive left foot", causing defenders [...] "countless problems". Myrie-Williams believes that his strongest attribute is that he [...] "loves running at defenders", as well as being [...] "pretty confident with the ball at his feet" [...] and [...] "not being <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> anyone on due to his pace". He also states that he can [...] "spot a good pass", and gets as much enjoyment assisting goals as he does scoring them. He {{has been described as a}} [...] "direct winger" [...] with [...] "a habit of drifting out wide". Myrie-Williams often takes set-pieces and has been described as a [...] "dangerous crosser of the ball".|$|E

He was influenced by early rock and roll artists such as Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley, and has cited blues musician Howlin' Wolf as an influence on the album's sound, which he described as [...] "bluesy" [...] and [...] "harder" [...] than that of his previous album, with more aggressive tempos. In an interview for BULLETT Magazine, Saadiq explained his idea of the album's title, stating [...] "Stone Rollin basically symbolizes the action of throwing dice and taking chances with life.

50|$|It {{is common}} for people to dread some risks but not others: They tend <b>to</b> be very <b>afraid</b> of {{epidemic}} diseases, nuclear power plant failures, and plane accidents but are relatively unconcerned about some highly frequent and deadly events, such as traffic crashes, household accidents, and medical errors. One key distinction of dreadful risks seems to be their potential for catastrophic consequences, threatening to kill {{a large number of}} people within a short period of time. For example, immediately after the September 11 attacks, many Americans were <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> fly and <b>took</b> their car instead, a decision that led to a significant increase in the number of fatal crashes in the time period following the 9/11 event compared with the same time period before the attacks.|$|R
500|$|A Hollywood executive, not {{involved}} with the film, felt it succeeded because it [...] "has a self-deprecating tone that’s riotous. It’s never been done before. It’s poking fun at Marvel. That label takes itself so seriously; can you imagine them making fun of themselves in a movie?" [...] James Gunn, director of Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, refuted this and said Deadpool was a success because [...] "it’s original, it’s damn good ... and it wasn’t <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> risks". Gunn hoped studios would learn [...] "the right lesson" [...] from the film and not just try to make more films [...] "like Deadpool". After Fox's Logan (2017) also became a success, Forbes Paul Tassi reiterated Gunn's sentiments, saying the rating was [...] "appropriate given the 'adult' nature of these two heroes", but [...] "too much stock is being put into unrestrained violence rather than people examining what actually makes these movies work". Graeme McMillan at The Hollywood Reporter concurred, adding, [...] "Why not take the freedom that comes from that rating and try to re-approach the mainstream genre with that attitude?" ...|$|E
500|$|To {{prepare for}} the storyline, Divins {{consulted}} with his gay friends and asked them how to ensure the character was [...] "being represented correctly and honestly". Oprah Winfrey's discussion of the down-low on her talk show The Oprah Winfrey Show also helped Divins better understand the character. Divins {{was unaware of the}} developments in Chad's sexuality until he was given the script four days prior to the filming of the episodes. He said he was surprised by the reveal that Chad's affair was with a man, but thought the soap opera's [...] "storytelling style lends itself to dramatic changes". Divins praised the show for its inclusion of a black, gay character on daytime television regardless of any negative feedback from fans who preferred Chad and Whitney as a couple, and said that he wasn't <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> on the role, given the increased visibility of LGBT issues on television and in everyday society {{at the time of the}} storyline's broadcast. Chad's character and storyline were not to every cast member's taste; Tracey Ross, who played Eve Russell, later said she [...] "was never crazy about" [...] the incest plot, though Phillip Jeanmarie, who played Vincent Clarkson, commented that he was glad to have been part of the taboo-breaking story.|$|E

Genre magazine TV Zone subtitled Vala as a [...] "thief, arms dealer, mercenary" [...] who, when given an inch, will [...] "take a mile, {{and whatever else}} she can get her hands on." [...] SFX described Vala as a [...] "mischievous minx", whereas The San Diego Union-Tribune interpreted Vala as [...] "ethically challenged". Steven Eramo of Starburst gave Vala the attributes [...] "sexy, smart and always resourceful". Claudia Black characterized early Vala as [...] "sassy", [...] "intelligent", [...] "manipulative", and [...] "mercurial", but found it [...] "very {{hard to tell what}} the real core of Vala is." [...] Black later described Vala as [...] "a new, weird element", [...] "irritating", [...] "very vibrant", [...] "sort of the hair-pulling variety", [...] "really infuriating" [...] and [...] " [...] funny". With Vala being a departure from Black's former Farscape role as Aeryn Sun, Black regarded Vala as a comedic and energetic character with streaks of irreverence and naughtiness who [...] "says everything that everyone else is thinking, but doesn't dare say", although both characters share [...] "being damaged goods [...] and on a path to becoming a better person". Robert C. Cooper thought of Vala as [...] "a bit of a wild card" [...] and [...] "a very sexy character, who isn't <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> whatever she wants in any given situation."

Of Mrs. Finn it must be acknowledged that she was, perhaps fastidiously, <b>afraid</b> of appearing <b>to</b> <b>take</b> advantage of her friendship with the Duke's family. She would tell herself that though circumstances had compelled her to be the closest and nearest friend of a Duchess, still her natural place was not among dukes and their children, and therefore in her intercourse with the girl she did not at first assume the manner and bearing which her position in the house would have seemed to warrant.

500|$|Pfeiffer likened {{preparing}} {{herself for}} the role to a musician preparing to record an album, describing the process as twice as much work. At one point, she confessed to Kloves that {{she felt she was}} performing terribly; Kloves insisted that Pfeiffer is a poignant and insightful perfectionist. Producer Mark Rosenberg appreciated Pfeiffer for portraying Susie as a character who is [...] "so colorful and full of life that even Jack... has to perk up and pay attention". Pfeiffer decided to play her character in a way that ultimately uncovers [...] "the scared kid inside" [...] despite her profane and world-weary introduction. Although Pfeiffer was ultimately pleased with her singing, she sometimes doubted her own abilities while filming in fear that she might have [...] "outdone" [...] herself. Pfeiffer slightly slurred her speech to portray her character. Pfeiffer identified Susie's first scene, in which she walks into her audition demanding attention, as her most difficult to film because she initially struggled to channel her character's outgoing personality, which is different than her own introverted nature. A scene originally intended for the film in which Pfeiffer's character accidentally allows a bath she has begun pouring herself to overflow because she has become distracted thinking about Jack was ultimately edited out of the final film. Pfeiffer initially had reservations about performing atop a grand piano, fearing that it would appear [...] "silly" [...] and cause audience members to laugh. However, Kloves encouraged her to commit to the scene. Pfeiffer's short evening dress worn during the musical sequence was designed to be revealing enough without exposing Pfeiffer while she moves, which was choreographed by dancer Peggy Holmes. Pfeiffer touted her character [...] "one of the most alive characters that I've played", describing her as an [...] "emotional creature" [...] who is [...] "not <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> risks... doesn't lie to herself. If she makes a mistake, she doesn't blame anybody else. There's a purity in her honesty that I really respect", becoming a strong role model for the actress herself. Pfeiffer also credits Susie with helping her discover her own sexuality, prior to which she had felt uncomfortable exploring. According to the Orlando Sentinels Kathy Huffhines, Susie [...] "has a harder shell, a sharper edge, and a franker sexiness" [...] than previous characters Pfeiffer has played. According to film critic David Thomson of The Independent, the role of Susie allowed Pfeiffer to add an aspect to her filmography, prior to which had been [...] "dutiful" [...] yet [...] "routine".|$|E
