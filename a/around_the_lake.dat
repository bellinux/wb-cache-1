5|$|Access to the {{waterside}} {{is restricted}} in places {{to reduce the}} disruption to wildlife. Paths <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> are generally flat and, where paths are surfaced, wheelchair access is possible.|$|E
5|$|Development {{plans are}} under {{various stages of}} {{implementation}} to address the critical {{issues related to the}} lake. They aim to improve water quality, increase water storage capacity, prevent encroachment of the lake periphery, improve the ambience <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake,</b> as well as to introduce recreational and revenue generating schemes.|$|E
5|$|Four {{areas of}} {{woodland}} containing 157 trees has been planted by The Life for a Life Charity <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> on the Restaurant side, for the cremated remains {{of loved ones}} to be placed beneath them. These forests contain Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), English oak (Quercus robur), rowan (Sorbus aucuparia) and the silver birch (Betula pendula).|$|E

5|$|From {{the initial}} {{planning}} stages, proponents and opponents {{speculated that the}} large size of the reservoir created by the dam could affect the weather in Interior Alaska and the Yukon. Several studies were conducted in regards to these potential changes, {{and most of the}} reports hypothesized an effect similar to the weather that occurs around Great Slave Lake and Lake Baikal, both of which were of similar sizes and latitudes to the proposed reservoir. Forecasts predicted the lake would hold in heat longer during the autumn, thus keeping area temperatures slightly warmer than normal. In the spring, however, the area <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> would have been prone to increased precipitation due to the phenomenon of lake-effect snow. In the summer, the long periods of daylight would have caused the land <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> to become warmer than the lake itself, also creating the possibility of storms.|$|E
5|$|The lake is {{designated}} a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and a Special Protection Area (SPA) (Site Code: UK9010041) {{largely because of}} the diversity of species and habitats. Providing further protection, much of the area <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> also falls within the Mendip Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB).|$|E
5|$|The lake {{is located}} in the south east part of the park. Fishing is {{permitted}} in the lake, which is stocked with large mouth bass, crappie, bream, and catfish. A 2002 renovation of the lake added a new bridge connecting the two bodies of water and three fishing piers located <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake.</b>|$|E
50|$|There is {{a variety}} of marked walking routes <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>lakes,</b> -round routes in Olpe.|$|R
50|$|Lough Bunny has no {{permanent}} inflow or outflow. It is fed by springs and drains into fissures <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake's</b> northern end. <b>The</b> <b>lake</b> is oligotrophic.|$|R
50|$|A {{variety of}} birds can be {{observed}} <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake's</b> water, including California seagulls and ducks. On the eastern and southern sides of <b>the</b> <b>lake,</b> native plants have been planted.|$|R
5|$|The main {{geological}} outcrops <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> are mudstone, largely {{consisting of}} red siltstone {{resulting in the}} underlying characteristic of the gently rolling valley landscape. Bands of sandstone from the Triassic period contribute to the undulating character of the area. There are also more recent alluvial deposits beside {{the course of the}} River Chew.|$|E
5|$|A lake {{restoration}} plan {{based on a}} decentralised bioreactor system to eliminate the organic load that enters the lake {{in the form of}} non-point and point source pollutants has also been mooted. Phumdis could be harvested in a sustainable manner by conversion into fuel and compost by installing ‘Plug Flow Bioreactors’ in a modular manner <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> perimeter. Laboratory tests of key species of phumdis have proved its potential to produce biogas. The bioreactors could also be used to treat sewage and thus arrest flow of organic matter into the lake.|$|E
5|$|Elijah's son Robert Bruce Ricketts, {{for whom}} the park is named, joined the Union Army as a private at the {{outbreak}} of the American Civil War and rose through the ranks to become a colonel in the artillery. After the war, R. Bruce Ricketts returned to Pennsylvania and in 1869 began purchasing the land <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> from his father. By 1873 he controlled or owned , and eventually this grew to more than , including the glens and waterfalls and most of the park.|$|E

5|$|In 2002 a 1.9-mile (3-kilometre) safe cycle route, the Chew Lake West Green Route, {{was opened}} along the B3114 {{on the western}} part of the lake. It forms part of the Padstow to Bristol West Country Way, National Cycle Network Route 3. It has {{all-weather}} surfacing, providing a smooth off-road facility for ramblers, mobility-challenged visitors and cyclists of all abilities. It was funded by Bath and North East Somerset Council with the support of Sustrans and the Chew Valley Recreational Trail Association. Minor roads <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> are also frequently used by cyclists.|$|E
5|$|M-22 is an {{original}} trunkline, {{dating to the}} July 1, 1919 designation of the system. In 1929, the highway was rerouted along {{the west side of}} Little Glen Lake, using the modern M-109 <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake.</b> M-22 would be rerouted back around to the present routing the next year, and M-109 was designated {{on the west side of}} the lake in its place.|$|E
5|$|Most {{land around}} the oxbow is steep. It {{is covered by}} hemlock and {{hardwood}} forests, as well as skunk cabbage seeps. The forests <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> also contain black birch, yellow birch, white oak, red oak, sugar maple, tulip poplar, and Norway maple, while the understory contains slippery elm, European privet, Japanese barberry, American elderberry, wild hydrangea, witch hazel, mountain laurel, ironwood, and the rare American yew. The American yew population was in significant decline by 2004 due to heavy grazing by deer.|$|E

5|$|Much of {{the area}} <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> remains undeveloped and empty. Original plans {{included}} large recreation areas on both the eastern and western end of the lake complete with golf courses, campgrounds, swimming lakes, water parks and other amenities. The MWD still plans on building the additional recreation facilities, but lack of funding and lack of support from developers has prevented them from doing so.|$|E
5|$|Owing to the {{proliferation}} of beaches, boat ramps and jetties, the West Lake is the area most used by swimmers and vessels. A bike path also surrounds the lake, and riding, walking or jogging <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> are a popular activity on the weekends. Fireworks are often held over the lake on New Year's Eve, and a large show called Skyfire has been held at the lake since 1989.|$|E
