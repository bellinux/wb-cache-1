The RLM was also expecting, during the late spring of 1943 — about one year after the mid-Spring 1942 Amerika Bomber proposal first arrived in Göring's offices — that a trio of He 277 V-series prototype aircraft, and construction of ten pre-production He 277A-0 series service test machines were to be completed, as well as [...] "progressive development" [...] of the still-unbuilt and unfinalized design, were anticipated as coming from Heinkel's Schwechat southern plant complex in Austria. The initial starting place for the He 277's fuselage design had been meant to originate with the last [...] "coupled-engine" [...] proposed variant of the He 177 itself, the long-range A-7, which itself was to be the basis for a four-engined variant of the Greif as the He 177A-10, then redesignated the He 177B-7 in the late summer of 1943, as both the A-7 and B-7 had omitted the manned rear dorsal turret of the earlier A-series versions for lighter weight. The considerable changes in the He 277's overall design philosophy evolved after the Amerika Bomber proposal's emergence in May 1942, from the changes in the He 277's general <b>arrangement</b> <b>proposal</b> drawings during that time period. The original proposal, which was meant to use the He 177A-7's fuselage as the starting point, evolved into designing a dedicated, new and wider He 219-general pattern fuselage layout for the 277 from the Spring 1943 timeframe onward, which would be more capable of using a tricycle undercarriage then gaining favor with a few German aviation designers, even with the 277 not known to have been specifically considered by the RLM in the earlier timeframe for the Amerika Bomber proposal.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the issue of process optimalization in the field of test {{discipline}} which is a fundamental part of software development. An approach providing improvement of test processes is applied in the environment of a test department in a selected company. Concept of raising process capability and maturity presented in CMMI model is used for this purpose. The first goal of the thesis is a provision of theoretical background devoted to software testing, process approach and capability and maturity models, that will accommodate enough with the clarity of the document text, as well as to provide insight into the whole subject. Theoretical interpretation will be compiled using on-line resources available for free, author's bachelor thesis and facts obtained through the studies and from educational materials. Attention will be focused on the definition of important facts and mutual relationship between the areas of interest. Description of initial state, changes carried out and current state of organizational structure, processes and documentation in the test department of the company was selected as a following goal. Process models consisting of diagrams, description tables and textual characteristics of identified processes will be created. Structure of documentation and of its parts will be accentuated through the description of documentation state and changes, furthermore a chronological sequence of taking the documents into practice and explanation of its importance in testing will be present. In order to offer a comprehensive view, a description of organizational structure and department member's competence will be available. As the last goal, <b>arrangement</b> <b>proposal</b> to obtain a higher process maturity and further improvement of documentation and organizational structure was chosen. Process areas and recommendation related to the processes of test discipline will be selected from the CMMI model.

40|$|International audienceModern {{agriculture}} {{suffers from}} {{its dependence on}} chemical inputs and subsequent impacts on health and environment. Alternatively, protecting crops against pests can be achieved through the reinforcement of regulation ecological services. Our work propounds a data-driven methodological framework to derive relevant agricultural landscape rearrangements enhancing populations of beneficial organisms regulating pests. Building on spatialised entomological and geographic data, we developed a parsimonious reaction–diffusion model describing the population dynamics of beneficial organisms. Parameter estimation {{was carried out in}} a Bayesian framework accounting for uncertainty in the measurement. Thousands of agricultural landscapes were generated under agronomic specifications dealt with as constraint satisfaction problems. Population dynamics was simulated on each landscape with the fitted reaction-diffusion model mentioned above, and two metrics of abundances allowed the assessment of the regulation performance of the landscape spatial arrangements. One metric is a mean field performance criterion assessing the regulation performance from the landscape composition only, the other is a spatial performance metric assessing the performance resulting from the whole landscape spatial configuration. The former is computed with a non-spatialised form of the population dynamics model, the latter results from the reaction-diffusion model of the population dynamics. Comparing these metrics enabled to quantify the impact of spatial arrangements, hence allowing <b>arrangements</b> <b>proposals.</b> This framework was applied to the case study of a ground beetle species involved in the biological regulation of weeds. The <b>arrangement</b> <b>proposals</b> abides by the productive agronomic constraint that is the landscape composition, while they allow for significant habitat quality enhancement (or deterioration) for the beneficial organism (or a pest).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{dissertation}} {{is to develop a}} spatial <b>arrangement</b> <b>proposal</b> of the settlements Straža, Vavta vas and Rumanja vas with a review of detailed land use. The elaboration of the spatial <b>arrangement</b> <b>proposal</b> is based on a survey carried out among local residents and on a detailed land use analysis. The dissertation consists of a theoretical and an empirical part, and is an upgrade of the urban planning workshop Straža, 2011. The theoretical part of the dissertation presents the legislative basis of land use planning, and particularly focuses on the significance of including the public. The formal way of public participation is provided by the law, while all other forms and ways are treated as informal ways of public participation and depend on the needs and purposes of land use planning. An informal way of public participation in land use planning is also an urban planning workshop. The experience with the public at the urban planning workshop Straža, 2011, which included a survey among local residents, an exhibition and a public hearing on activities, and some of the solutions shown on a 1 : 1000 scale model of Straža for better spatial perception, is presented in the second, empirical part of the dissertation. On the basis of public opinion and on the basis of my own land use analyses presented cartographically and provided in descriptive form (protection and restriction zones, actual land use, traffic, morphological and visual analysis, and facility usage analysis) we have designed a conceptual framework {{for the development of the}} settlements Straža, Vavta vas and Rumanja vas, and further developed the concept into a spatial plan proposal shown on a map of detailed land use. ...|$|E

Infrared laser systems applied successfully, with high efficiency self-induced plasma mirrors for improving the contrast of the beam. Short wavelength laser beams however have a larger critical density in the plasma, and due to their deeper penetration the absorption is higher, the reflectivity, and the corresponding plasma mirror efficiency is lower. We show herewith that with carefully planned boundary conditions plasma mirrors can reach up to 70 % efficiency even for KrF laser radiation. Our observations can be qualitatively explained by the classical Drude model. The high reflectivity allows the use of plasma mirrors even after the final amplification or before the last amplifier.

We assume, considering the differences in present living conditions in both countries that there are {{significant differences in the}} motivation level of service sector employees. Subjects of the research were comparable hotels situated at the foot of mountains in the mentioned countries and in the towns with similar level of tourism, infrastructure and regional development. A questionnaire with closed questions was used to analyse the motivation level. Socio-demographic and qualification characteristics of employees were explored {{in the first part of}} the questionnaire. Individual motivation factors were included in the second part. Through them we acquired general information relating to motivation. Respondents evaluated individual motivation factors by one of the five levels of importance. On the basis of sample sizes and their independence a two-sample t- test was used to evaluate the significance and F-test was used to test the variances. The null hypothesis about the equality of individual motivation factors was tested at the significance level α = 0. 05. Significant differences were determined in the motivation factors, i. e. the opportunity to apply one's own ability, information about achieved performance results, moving up the corporate ladder, prestige, self-actualization, social benefits, mission of the company, education and personal growth, relation to the environment, recognition and basic salary. The result of the paper is the finding that despite the economic differences between countries the level of employee motivation of the studied subjects in Slovakia and in Austria is very similar.

40|$|Currently, CEO pay is {{determined}} by a company’s board of directors, subject to limited shareholder approval in certain circumstances. However, as Lucian Bebchuk and Jesse Fried have demonstrated, boards of directors and CEOs do not necessarily engage in real arms length bargaining over CEO pay. Instead, CEOs may exert managerial power to extract economic rents above and beyond what they could have obtained in an arms length negotiation. To address the problem, Bebchuk and Fried have proposed that large shareholders be allowed to nominate candidates for the board, and that companies be required to pay the expenses for any proxy fight if the shareholder’s nominee receives a designated minimum level of support. Some commentators have taken issue with their conclusion that CEOs are in fact overpaid, and others have objected to their proposed remedies. This article accepts the fundamental point that the CEO pay-setting process is flawed and that reforms are necessary. Nonetheless, it recognises that high CEO pay may be attributable to numerous factors other than managerial power, and it questions whether certain of Bebchuk and Fried’s proposed solutions might have unintended negative consequences for matters beyond CEO pay. Therefore, to remedy {{the problems in the}} pay-setting process, this article proposes that large shareholders be allowed to appoint non-executive “compensation representatives” to look after the interests of all shareholders on matters relating exclusively to CEO pay. Compensation representatives would have the right to attend all compensation-related meetings, to question board members, to make recommendations, and to report their views to shareholders. Shareholders in turn could use the representative’s report as a basis for rejecting unreasonable pay <b>arrangements.</b> This <b>proposal</b> would insert into the pay-setting process parties who are immune to CEO pressure and responsive to shareholder concerns. It would address compensation without fundamentally altering the relationship between the shareholders and the board. Its implementation is highly feasible, since it could be adopted by shareholder by-law, without changing existing law. Finally, it could be vindicated or discredited by the market itself. As such, it would constitute a prudent solution to excessive CEO pay...|$|R
40|$|Analysis {{simulation}} and experiments for optimization of photonics correlators with {{application to}} imaging interferometers for the microwave bandsThis thesis {{work has been}} devoted to the study of photonic techniques and devices applied to the treatment of signals at microwave frequencies, the so-called microwave photonics technology field. The benefits photonics may offer and the challenges that must be overcome to bring those to reality have been assessed and discussed. Specifically RF filtering, as a fundamental operation required on-board telecommunication satellites operating at microwave frequencies, has been identified as one key area in which contributions may be made, and a new proposal for a reconfigurable RF filter based on two tunable lasers has been studied, showing progress towards full demonstration of the practical feasibility of the filter. On the other hand, synthetic aperture radiometers in the microwave range have also been recognized as one promising area where the introduction of photonics may bring significant advantages. In this thesis a thorough state of the art review is made on the topic of photonic synthetic aperture radiometers, including the basics of brightness temperature map reconstruction through correlation of each pair of antennas in the interferometric <b>arrangement.</b> A new <b>proposal</b> to exploit the benefits of photonics into synthetic aperture radiometers has been presented and studied through numerical simulations, and its potential to improve performances in practical implementations has been assessed and compared with current proposals described in literature...|$|R
