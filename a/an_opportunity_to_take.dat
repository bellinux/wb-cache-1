5|$|Adler went on {{the road}} with Boris Thomashefsky, who at the time was {{pioneering}} the touring circuit for Yiddish theater in America. They played in Philadelphia and Chicago, where word arrived of <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> over Poole's, Heine having moved on to the Thalia. Adler returned to New York, where he managed also to win Mogulesko and Kessler away from Heine.|$|E
5|$|After Plunder the II Canadian Corps, {{commanded}} by Lieutenant General Guy Simonds, struck west and seized Emmerich, approaching the IJssel from the east. Crerar saw <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> Arnhem and open a route {{between the city}} and Zutphen to the north, and ordered his two Corps commanders to coordinate their advances accordingly. However, he was wary of trying to seize Arnhem before the IJssel had been bridged further north.|$|E
5|$|The Athenians {{then sent}} out a force to assist in garrisoning Corinth, with Iphicrates {{commanding}} the peltasts. The Spartans and the exiles, meanwhile, raided Corinthian territory from Lechaeum, and in 391 BC King Agesilaus led a large Spartan army to the area and attacked a number of strongpoints, winning a number of successes. The Athenians and their allies were largely bottled up in Corinth, but eventually found <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> advantage of Spartan negligence.|$|E

5|$|Following his {{admission}} to the New York Bar, MacMurray sought a career in government. A letter of commendation from Woodrow Wilson helped MacMurray secure <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the foreign service examination. In 1907, he was appointed as Consul-General and Secretary of Legation in Bangkok, Siam, and then became second secretary at the U.S. embassy in St. Petersburg. There he worked under ambassador William Woodville Rockhill, who was credited with helping to shape the United States’ open door policy towards China.|$|E
5|$|Partner {{communication}} {{is essential in}} a good defense. When one partner is under attack, the other partner {{should be aware of}} which pieces hurt most. Sitting strategies might be necessary, and it is therefore important to play the defense fast. Accepting a sacrifice can be lethal. On the other hand, it results in the attacker having a piece less to play with, with the defender's partner having a piece more. Sacrifices therefore give the partner of the defender <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> initiative.|$|E
5|$|Two {{attempts}} by the Japanese to extend their defensive perimeter {{in the south and}} central Pacific were thwarted in the battles of Coral Sea (May 1942) and Midway (June 1942). These two strategic victories for the Allies provided them with <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the initiative and launch an offensive against the Japanese somewhere in the Pacific. The Allies chose the Solomon Islands, specifically the southern Solomon Islands of Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and Florida as the location for their first offensive.|$|E

5|$|Born in Stockport, Greater Manchester, Crowther {{spent nine}} years at his local club Stockport County {{moving through the}} youth system, before making his first team debut for the club on 2 January 2006 in a 2–2 draw against Cheltenham Town, where aged just 17, he came on as a {{substitute}} and was made captain, making him the youngest captain in the club's history. He went on to make one other senior appearance for Stockport before the club were approached by Liverpool requesting <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> both Crowther and Greg Tansey on trial {{with a view to}} take them to a tournament in Milan, and agreed deals with Stockport for both players subject to satisfactory performances from the players at the tournament. The players both went to the tournament and Crowther joined Liverpool on 9 July 2007, with Tansey deciding to stay at Stockport. Crowther featured for the successful Liverpool reserve team during the 2007–08 season. On 18 August 2009, it was confirmed that he had left Liverpool by mutual consent.|$|E
5|$|On 4 February, {{the team}} beat União de Leiria {{at home by}} 3 goals to 2. Benfica took the lead with a goal from João Tomás. Roger and Van Hooijdonk {{increased}} their lead by two goals, until Nuno Valente settled the final score. With this win, Benfica climbed to second place the league, now only five points behind leader Boavista. On the 16th, Benfica played Estrela da Amadora away from home. The game ended with a 2–1 victory for Benfica. Along with Boavista's loss in Braga, this further reduced Benfica's separation from the league leader. Benfica played their last match of February on the 25th against Boavista. Benfica had <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the top place in the league table with a victory in that game, but they were unsuccessful at breaking the 0–0 draw. Van Hooijdonk had the best chance in the 78th minute, but his attempt struck the goalpost.|$|E
5|$|The Allies were greatly {{concerned}} about the Japanese airfield construction effort on Guadalcanal because, when completed, the aircraft operating from the airfield would be a significant threat to Allied operations between Australia, New Zealand, and the U.S. The two strategic victories for the Allies in the battles of the Coral Sea and Midway provided <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the initiative and launch an offensive against the Japanese somewhere in the Pacific. An Allied plan to attack the southern Solomons was conceived by U.S. Admiral Ernest King, Commander in Chief, United States Fleet. He proposed the offensive to deny {{the use of the}} southern Solomon Islands by the Japanese as bases to threaten the supply routes between the U.S. and Australia, and to use them as starting points for a campaign. His goal was to neutralize or capture the major Japanese base at Rabaul while also supporting the Allied New Guinea campaign, with the eventual goal of opening the way for the U.S. to retake the Philippines. U.S. Admiral Chester Nimitz—Allied commander-in chief for Pacific forces—created the South Pacific theater—with U.S. Vice Admiral Robert L. Ghormley in command—to direct the Allied offensive in the Solomons.|$|E

25|$|In early January, Yudenich {{secretly}} {{left its}} winter quarters and marched towards the major Ottoman fort at Erzurum.

The Russian General Yudenich viewed this as <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the Ottomans by surprise. The Russians achieved total surprise and destroyed an Ottoman division that was in winter quarters at Battle of Koprukoy (January 10–18).|$|E
