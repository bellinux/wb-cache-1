After a packed final service in the Willemskerk in August, he was sent off by [...] "half the population of Batavia"; his final sermon, based on Epistle to the Hebrews 13:18–19, suggested that he hoped to return to the Indies. Later, he characterized the Governor-General as more powerful than the Dutch king: [...] "he is the sun, at which <b>all</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> aimed; when he laughs, everyone laughs; if he looks serious, then the entire multitude frowns its face." ...|$|E

[...] Jenna Gregory of Marie Claire wrote that Beyoncé shows an [...] "amazing bod in parely-there clothes which you definitely wouldn't find in the maternity section." [...] Chris Coplan of Consequence of Sound found a 1980s vibe similar to the song's sound, adding {{that the only thing}} the [...] "family affair is missing is Jay-Z wearing sunscreen on his nose and a shirt from Tommy Bahama." [...] Ted Maider of the same publication, noted that Beyoncé [...] "adds some luster to the rusty surroundings, shining through as the beautiful pop icon that she has become. It just goes to show it doesn't matter where Beyonce is, or where her music is playing, she can turn any spot into a rager." [...] A writer of OK! said that Beyoncé [...] "don an unbelievable amount of cool oufits, all of which we need in our lives." [...] Rap-Up commented [...] "Summer may be over, but Beyoncé gives us another reason to celebrate with the vibrant video" [...] adding [...] "This is one party you won't want to miss." [...] Andrew Martin of Prefix Magazine described [...] "Party"'s video as a [...] "fittingly shindig-centric affair." [...] Jessica Misener of The Huffington Post praised the fashion used in the video saying that Beyoncé had a lot of [...] "chic looks". Another writer of the same publication praised the decision to make a simple party set. He further described the video as [...] "a gorgeous boast of her beauty as well as a helpful reminder that, even in these down economic times, one can party like a rock star." [...] At the 2012 BET Awards, Beyoncé and Alan Ferguson won in the category for Video Director of the Year after they collaborated on the music video for [...] "Party".|$|E

60|$|During the hush {{and whisper}} that pervade the room, <b>all</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> turned on this young {{minister}} of fortune. People begin to inquire his age, {{with a view}} to the next lottery; and the number of his brothers and sisters; and the age of his father and mother; and whether he has any moles or pimples upon him; and where, and how many; when the arrival of the last judge but one (a little old man, universally dreaded as possessing the Evil Eye) makes a slight diversion, and would occasion a greater one, but that he is immediately deposed, as a source of interest, by the officiating priest, who advances gravely to his place, followed by a very dirty little boy, carrying his sacred vestments, and a pot of Holy Water.|$|E

Meanwhile, the devoted pilchards press on--a compact mass of thousands on thousands of fish, swimming to meet their doom. <b>All</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> fixed on the [...] "huer;" [...] he stands watchful and still, until the shoal is thoroughly embayed, in water which he knows to be within {{the depth of the}} [...] "seine" [...] net.

There is {{somewhat}} touching in the madness {{with which the}} passing age mischooses the object on which all candles shine, and <b>all</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> turned; the care with which it registers every trifle touching Queen Elizabeth,[599] and King James,[600] and the Essexes,[601] Leicesters,[602] Burleighs,[603] and Buckinghams;[604] and lets pass without a single valuable note the founder of another dynasty, which alone will cause the Tudor dynasty[605] to be remembered,--the man who carries the Saxon race in him by the inspiration which feeds him, and on whose thoughts the foremost {{people of the world}} are now for some ages to be nourished, and minds to receive this and not another bias. A popular player,--nobody suspected he was the poet of the human race; and the secret was kept as faithfully from poets and intellectual men, as from courtiers and frivolous people. Bacon,[606] who took the inventory of the human understanding for his times, never mentioned his name. Ben Jonson,[607] though we have strained his few words of regard and panegyric, had no suspicion of the elastic fame whose first vibrations he was attempting. He no doubt thought the praise he has conceded to him generous, and esteemed himself, out of all question, the better poet of the two.|$|E

6000|$|Friedrich {{has left}} the {{mouse-trap}} open;--and latterly has been baiting it with a pleasant spicing of toasted cheese. One of his Spies, reporting from Prince Karl's quarters, Friedrich has at this time discovered to be a Double-Spy, reporting thither as well. Double-Spy, there is an ugly fact;--perhaps not quite convenient to abolish it by hemp and gibbet; perhaps it could be turned to use, as most facts can? [...] "Very good, my expert Herr von Schonfeld [that was the knave's name]; and now of all things, whenever the Prince does get across,--instant word to us of that! Nothing so important to us. If he should get BETWEEN us and Breslau, for example, what would the consequence be!" [...] To this purport Friedrich instructs his Double-Spy; sends him off, unhanged, to Prince Karl's Camp, to blab this fresh bit of knowledge. [...] "We likewise," [...] says Friedrich, [...] "ordered some repairs on the roads leading to Breslau;"--last turn of the hand to our bit of toasted fragrancy. And Prince Karl is actually striding forward, at an eager pace:--and Nadasti VERSUS Winterfeld, the other day, could Winterfeld have guessed it, was the actual vanguard of the march; and will be up again straightway! Whereupon Winterfeld too is called home; and <b>all</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> bent on the Landshut side.|$|E

Why was John Foterell murdered in the forest two nights gone? You won't answer? Then I will. Because he rode to Court to prove the truth about you and your treachery, and therefore you butchered him. Why do you claim my wife as your ward? Because you wish to steal her lands and goods to feed your plots and luxury. You think you have bought friends at Court, and that for money's sake those in power there will {{turn a blind eye to}} your crimes. So it may be for a while; but wait, wait. <b>All</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> not blind yonder, nor all ears deaf. That head of yours shall yet be lifted higher than you think--so high that it sticks upon the top of Blossholme Towers, a warning to all who would sell England to her enemies. John Foterell lies dead with your knave's arrow in his throat, but Jeffrey Stokes is away with the writings. And now do your worst, Clement Maldon. If you want my wife, come take her." ...|$|E
60|$|See {{those five}} talking earnestly, in {{the centre of}} a ring, which longs to overhear, and yet is too respectful to {{approach}} close. Those soft long eyes and pointed chin you recognize already; they are Walter Raleigh's. The fair {{young man in the}} flame-colored doublet, whose arm is round Raleigh's neck, is Lord Sheffield; opposite them stands, by the side of Sir Richard Grenville, a man as stately even as he, Lord Sheffield's uncle, the Lord Charles Howard of Effingham, lord high admiral of England; next to him is his son-in-law, Sir Robert Southwell, captain of the Elizabeth Jonas: but who is that short, sturdy, plainly dressed man, who stands with legs a little apart, and hands behind his back, looking up, with keen gray eyes, into the face of each speaker? His cap is in his hands, so you can see the bullet head of crisp brown hair and the wrinkled forehead, as well as the high cheek bones, the short square face, the broad temples, the thick lips, which are yet firm as granite. A coarse plebeian stamp of man: yet the whole figure and attitude are that of boundless determination, self-possession, energy; and when at last he speaks a few blunt words, <b>all</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>are</b> turned respectfully upon him;--for his name is Francis Drake.|$|E
