5000|$|On gay {{marriage}} and religious freedom, Beck said, [...] "If {{you want to}} get married, that's not my business, that's not the government's business. That's between you and God or you <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>spouse</b> or whatever. However, you can't tell my church who I have to marry. If my church says 'no I'm sorry', you can't force me to marry you. I can't force you not to get married someplace else.

5000|$|When a {{coordinate}} possessive {{construction has}} two personal pronouns, the normal possessive inflection is used, {{and there is}} no apostrophe (e.g. [...] "his and her children"). The issue of the use of the apostrophe arises when the coordinate construction includes a noun (phrase) and a pronoun.In this case, the inflection of only the last item may sometimes be, at least marginally, acceptable ("you <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>spouse's</b> bank account").The inflection of both is normally preferred (e.g. Jack's <b>and</b> <b>your</b> dogs), but {{there is a tendency to}} avoid this construction, too, in favour of a construction that does not use a coordinate possessive (e.g. by using [...] "Jack's letters and yours"). Where a construction like [...] "Jack's <b>and</b> <b>your</b> dogs" [...] is used, the interpretation is usually [...] "segregatory" [...] (i.e. not joint possession).|$|R
50|$|Prenuptial {{agreements}} are, at best, {{a partial}} solution to obviating {{some of the}} risks of marital property disputes in times of divorce. They protect minimal assets and are not the final word. Nevertheless, {{they can be very}} powerful and limit parties' property rights and alimony. It may be impossible to set aside a properly drafted and executed prenup. A prenup can dictate not only what happens if the parties divorce, but also what happens when they die. They can act as a contract to make a will and/or eliminate all your rights to property, probate homestead, probate allowance, right to take as a predetermined heir, and the right to act as an executor <b>and</b> administrator of <b>your</b> <b>spouse's</b> estate.|$|R

The characters lie to each other and the reader about affairs and disappearances. Amy fabricates a fake diary to implicate her husband for her disappearance and murder. Flynn says that, in writing the book, she wanted to examine how people within a marriage lie to each other: [...] "marriage is sort of like a long con, because you put on display your very best self during courtship, {{yet at the same time}} the person you marry is supposed to love you warts <b>and</b> all.

Even though the wind cools the temperature, the beauty of the Alaska landscape is cause enough for celebration. What a day this is! The ocean and the scenery are magnificent. A seafood feast planned for mid-afternoon has members of your party busy harvesting shellfish from the rocky beach. In less time than expected, buckets of harvested shellfish arrive {{at the feet of the}} chef. A steamer pot of boiling salt water quickly cooks the bounty, and a few minutes later the harvest is devoured with gusto. What qualities could better represent a day in the Great Land? Reluctant to disrupt the excitement of the outing, George tells you that he feels a strange tingling on his lips <b>and</b> face. <b>Your</b> <b>spouse</b> is also experiencing the same strange numbness on her face. You, too busy to eat much, don’t understand as each guest complains of this strange ailment. <b>Your</b> <b>spouse</b> stumbles as she carries more food to the table. George becomes dizzy and nauseous. While helping him to a beach chair, you notice the volleyball team is leaving the playing area as each person becomes listless. The game is over, and unfortunately, so is the party. What is happening to these people? Could seafood fresh from the ocean cause such a serious condition? The problem is paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP), and there is little you can do at this point except to get these victims to a medical facility and fast. A potentially lethal event, PSP is a crisis no one wants to experience. As many coastal residents know, eating personally harvested shellfish is risky. As Alaskans you need to know about PSP, what health dangers it presents, and how you can reduce your risk of contracting this dreaded ailment...|$|R

40|$|An {{integrated}} {{series of}} studies investigated 2 functional dimensions of self-regulation referred to as assessment and locomotion (E. T. Higgins and A. W. Krnglanski, 1995). Assessment constitutes the comparative aspect of self-regulation that critically evaluates alternative goals or means to decide which are best to pursue and appraises performance. Locomotion constitutes the aspect of self-regulation concerned with movement from state to state, including commitment of psychological resources to initiate and maintain such movement. Two separate scales were developed to measure individual differences in these tendencies. Psychometric work attested to the scales ' unidimensionality, internal consistency, and temporal stability. The authors found that (a) locomotion and assessment are relatively independent of each other, (b) both are needed for self-regulatory success, and (c) each relates to distinct task orientations and motivational emphases.

40|$|We use “I’ll be glad I did it ” {{reasoning}} all the time. For example, {{last night}} I {{was trying to}} decide whether to work on this paper or go out to a movie. I realized that if I worked on the paper, then today I would be glad I did it; if I went out to the movie, today I would regret it. This enabled me to see that I should work on the paper rather than going out to a movie. This looks like excellent reasoning: Paper argument: 1. If I work on my paper, I’ll be glad I did it. 2. Therefore, I should work on my paper. When we’re having trouble making a big life decision, we often try to picture what will happen each way we might choose, and imagine how we’ll feel in that outcome. Consider a very different case in which one might use this reasoning. Suppose you <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>spouse</b> have just had a baby, Stevie, and Stevie turns out to be deaf.
