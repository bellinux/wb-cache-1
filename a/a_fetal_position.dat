25|$|In 1978, the Munch scholar Robert Rosenblum {{suggested}} that the strange, sexless creature in the foreground of the painting {{was inspired by a}} Peruvian mummy, which Munch could have seen at the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris. This mummy, which was buried in <b>a</b> <b>fetal</b> <b>position</b> with its hands alongside its face, also struck the imagination of Munch's friend Paul Gauguin: it stood as a model for figures in more than twenty of Gauguin's paintings, among those the central figure in his painting, Human misery (Grape harvest at Arles) and for the old woman at the left in his painting, Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?. In 2004, an Italian anthropologist speculated that Munch might have seen a mummy in Florence's Museum of Natural History, which bears an even more striking resemblance to the painting. Nonetheless, later studies have confirmed Rosenblum's suggestion, disproving the Italian theory, for Munch had not been to Florence until after painting The Scream.|$|E

40|$|To {{determine}} whether nuchal translucency thickness {{is influenced by}} the <b>fetal</b> <b>position</b> at ultrasound examination. Transabdominal ultrasound examination for pregnancy dating and measurement of nuchal translucency thickness was performed at 10 - 14 weeks' gestation in all women attending the antenatal clinic of our hospital. During the examination special attention was paid to <b>a</b> change in <b>fetal</b> <b>position</b> from prone to supine or vice versa. For each fetus the nuchal translucency measurement was repeated when a positional change from prone to supine or vice versa was recorded. All measurements were recorded on hard copy. An image-scoring method was used and evaluated by three independent reviewers. Eighty-five fetuses were included in this study. The mean nuchal translucency for supine fetuses was 1. 91 mm compared with 1. 93 mm for prone fetuses. The mean quality-score was 6. 54 for supine fetuses and 6. 55 for prone fetuses. This difference was not statistically significant. <b>Fetal</b> <b>position</b> has no influence on the measurement of nuchal translucenc...|$|R

2500|$|The pottery of {{the area}} was {{influenced}} by the mineral deposits {{of the area}} for coloring and Olmec based influences coming from the east of the area.

There was a smooth hide belt around his waist. Additionally, the corpse had a noose made of plaited animal hide drawn tight around the neck and trailing down his back. Other than these, the body was naked. His hair was cropped so short as to be almost entirely hidden by his cap. There was short stubble (1mm length) on his chin and upper lip, suggesting {{that he had not}} shaved on the day of his death.|$|E
25|$|Prayer {{appears to}} have health implications. Empirical studies suggest that mindfully reading and reciting the Psalms (from scripture) can help a person calm down and focus. Prayer is also {{positively}} correlated with happiness and religious satisfaction (Poloma & Pendleton, 1989, 1991). A study conducted by Franceis, Robbins, Lewis, and Barnes (2008) investigated the relationship between self-reported prayer frequency and measures of psychoticism and neuroticism according to the abbreviated form of the Revised Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQR-A). The study included a sample size of 2306 students attending Protestant and Catholic schools in the highly religious culture of Northern Ireland. The data shows a negative correlation between prayer frequency and psychoticism. The data also shows that, in Catholic students, frequent prayer has a positive correlation to neuroticism scores. Ladd and McIntosh (2008) suggest that prayer-related behaviors, such as bowing the head and clasping the hands together in <b>an</b> almost <b>fetal</b> <b>position,</b> are suggestive of “social touch” actions. Prayer in this manner may prepare an individual to carry out positive pro-social behavior after praying, due to factors such as increased {{blood flow to the}} head and nasal breathing. Overall, slight health benefits have been found fairly consistently across studies.|$|R

The artwork was created by the band's longtime collaborator Kamikene of the group Hatos, who coincidentally was in Germany when the band asked him to create the artwork. The German translation was offered by a German contact Kamikene had, after letting them listen to the song. The photo of Yamaguchi was taken late at night in Yamaguchi's own apartment, an idea which came from the photographer, who wanted to take candid photos of Yamaguchi to create a documentary-like and everyday feel. The photo was taken of Yamaguchi asleep, after an all-night long drinking party that Yamaguchi held.|$|E

40|$|Introduction - Congenital {{intracranial}} {{tumors are}} rare and often incidentally diagnosed on routine ultrasound. We report {{a case of}} <b>a</b> <b>fetal</b> demise with <b>a</b> massive intracranial teratoma at 25 weeks of gestation and the management of her delivery {{in the setting of}} macrocephaly, breech presentation, and polyhydramnios. Case - A 31 -year-old G 3 P 1011 woman at 25 weeks' gestation presented with <b>a</b> recent <b>fetal</b> demise and <b>a</b> <b>fetal</b> intracranial tumor first identified at 16 weeks' gestational age. The patient had declined termination of pregnancy. Biometry was consistent with 24 weeks' gestation, except for a head circumference of 394. 4 [*]mm consistent with 39 weeks' gestation. The fetus was in a breech presentation. An external cephalic version (ECV) was successfully performed under epidural anesthesia and an amnioreduction was then performed to stabilize the <b>fetal</b> <b>position.</b> Immediate induction of labor and vaginal delivery followed.

50|$|Funerary customs {{developed}} during the Predynastic period {{from those of the}} Prehistoric Period. At first people excavated round graves with one pot in the Badarian Period (4400-3800 B.C.E.), continuing the tradition of Omari and Maadi cultures. By the end of the Predynastic period, there were increasing numbers of objects deposited with the body in rectangular graves, and there is growing evidence of rituals practiced by Egyptians of the Naquada II Period (3650-3300 B.C.E). At this point, bodies were regularly arranged in <b>a</b> crouched or <b>fetal</b> <b>position</b> with the face toward either the east the rising sun or the west (which in this historical period was the land of the dead). Artists painted jars with funeral processions and perhaps ritual dancing. Figures of bare breasted women with birdlike faces and their legs concealed under skirts also appeared in some graves. Some graves were much richer in goods than others, demonstrating the beginnings of social stratification. Gender differences in burial emerged with the inclusion of weapons in men's graves and cosmetics palettes in women's graves.|$|R

40|$|Since {{the late}} 19 th Century, {{abdominal}} palpation of the gravid uterus has been routine, worldwide obstetric practice to determine <b>fetal</b> <b>position.</b> <b>A</b> systematic review showed {{a dearth of}} research on the accuracy of this ubiquitous test.

Trained observers blind to the index test results performed the ultrasound independently. Midwives palpation data on the position of 629 women were obtained and 61 (9 %) fetuses were verified as LOA by ultrasound. The sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratio of abdominal palpation to detect LOA position were 34 % (23 - 46), 71 % (67 - 74) and 1. 2 (0. 83 - 1. 74) respectively. Higher accuracy was achieved by midwives with experience > 5 years (OR 4. 02; 1. 2 - 12. 9) and those who worked in the community (OR 0. 15; 0. 03 - 0. 9). Accuracy of abdominal palpation to determine LOA <b>fetal</b> <b>position</b> at the onset of labour is poor. If future research demonstrates that the optimal <b>fetal</b> <b>position</b> of LOA exists, midwives will need to confirm <b>fetal</b> <b>position</b> at the onset of labour by ultrasound to prognosticate...|$|R
