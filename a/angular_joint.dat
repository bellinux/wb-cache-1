A multibody biomechanical model of the wheelchair curling delivery was developed in reference to a Team Canada Paralympic athlete with a spinal cord injury.

The <b>angular</b> <b>joint</b> kinematics throughout the wheelchair curling delivery were experimentally measured using an inertial measurement unit system; the translational kinematics of the curling stone were additionally evaluated with optical motion capture. The experimental kinematics were optimized to satisfy the kinematic constraints of the multibody biomechanical model.

The neural motor control of the Paralympic athlete was modeled using forward dynamic optimization. The predicted kinematics from different optimization objective functions were compared with those experimentally measured throughout the wheelchair curling delivery. Of the optimization objective functions under consideration, minimizing <b>angular</b> <b>joint</b> accelerations resulted in the most accurate predictions of the kinematic trajectories and the shortest optimization computation time.

40|$|The toe flexor muscles {{maintain}} body balance during {{standing and}} provide push-off force during walking, running, and jumping. Additionally, {{they are important}} contributing structures to maintain normal foot function. Thus, weakness of these muscles may cause poor balance, inefficient locomotion and foot deformities. The quantification of metatarsophalangeal joint (MPJ) stiffness is valuable as it is considered as a confounding factor in toe flexor muscles function. MPJ and ankle joint stiffness measurement is still largely depended on manual skills as current devices do not have good control on alignment, <b>angular</b> <b>joint</b> speed and displacement during measurement. Therefore, this study introduces an innovative dynamometer and protocol procedures for MPJ and ankle Joint torque measurement with precise and reliable foot alignment, <b>angular</b> <b>joint</b> speed and displacement control. Within-day and between-day test-retest experiments on MPJ and ankle joint torque measurement were conducted on ten and nine healthy male subjects respectively. The mean peak torques of MPJ and ankle joint of between-day and within-day measurement were 1. 50  ±  0. 38  Nm/deg and 1. 19  ±  0. 34  Nm/deg. The corresponding torques of the ankle joint were 8. 24  ±  2. 20  Nm/deg and 7. 90  ±  3. 18  Nm/deg respectively. Intraclass-correlation coefficients (ICC) of averaged peak torque of both joints of between-day and within-day test-retest experiments were ranging from 0. 91 to 0. 96, indicating the innovative device is systematic and reliable for the measurements {{and can be used}} for multiple scientific and clinical purposes.

30|$|It {{has been}} under debate whether the {{conditioning}} contraction increases the force or torque generated by high-intensity contractions. Some studies reported that the electrically-evoked maximal isometric force was not increased by a conditioning contraction (Vandenboom et al. 1993; 1995; 1997) whereas others observed increases in the maximal voluntary concentric torque (Fukutani et al. 2012); (Miyamoto et al. 2011). One of the possible reasons for this discrepancy is {{that the type of}} contraction (i.e., isometric or concentric contractions) used to test the effect of the conditioning contraction varied among these studies. In the previous studies reporting positive potentiation effects, concentric contractions at relatively fast <b>joint</b> <b>angular</b> velocities (180 °/s in plantar flexion) were used for the testing (Fukutani et al. 2012); (Miyamoto et al. 2011). Babault et al. (2008) reported that the extent of increase in twitch torque induced by the conditioning contraction increased when the <b>joint</b> <b>angular</b> velocity during a twitch contraction increased, which indicates that the sensitivity to the positive effect of a conditioning contraction is high when the <b>joint</b> <b>angular</b> velocity is high. The extent of increase in the force induced by the conditioning contraction becomes smaller as the contraction intensity for examining the effect of the conditioning contraction increases (MacIntosh and Willis 2000). Thus, the torque attained during a high-intensity contraction may increases when the sensitivity to the positive effect of conditioning contraction is sufficiently high at, or higher than, a certain <b>joint</b> <b>angular</b> velocity. If so, there is possibility that if a lower <b>joint</b> <b>angular</b> velocity was used than the one used in previous studies (180 °/s, Fukutani et al. 2012 and Miyamoto et al. 2011), the increase in the maximal voluntary concentric torque may have been small or negligible. In this study, therefore, we investigated the effects of a conditioning contraction on the increase in the maximal voluntary concentric torque at not only fast (180 °/s) but also slow (30 °/s) <b>joint</b> <b>angular</b> velocities. We hypothesized that the maximal voluntary concentric torque increases only in the fast <b>joint</b> <b>angular</b> velocity condition.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} studies the electrical power reduction and control analysis of various motion tasks of a humanoid robot. These motions include {{standing up and}} sitting down. Each motion’s tasks have their stable and unstable phases throughout the complete motion cycle. Unstable phases {{can be caused by}} gravity forces and improper handling of the upper body of the humanoid robot leaning too forward or backward. Even though most of the dynamic motions seem to be accomplished very simply by humans; standing up and sitting down could create challenges for humanoid robots. Some of the critical challenges researches face are: dynamic nature of motions, humanoid robot joint coordination, whole body balance, stability of the model, limited energy source, energy saving techniques and modeling. Dynamic motions of humanoid robots can be modeled and analyzed to reduce electrical power use. In order to accomplish such energy savings, a researcher needs to study the kinematics, dynamics of a humanoid, and motion tasks with given constraints. The robot in this research is modeled as a planar humanoid robot. All motion tasks of a humanoid robot are characterized in terms of motion variables. These motion variables include <b>joint</b> <b>angular</b> positions, <b>joint</b> <b>angular</b> velocity, <b>joint</b> <b>angular</b> acceleration, humanoid robot center of mass (CoM) position, velocity and acceleration change and center of pressure (CoP) position change.

40|$|Abstract: In {{the context}} of a {{parallel}} manipulator, inverse and direct Jacobian matrices are known to contain information which helps us identify some of the singular configurations. In this article, we employ kinematic analysis for the Delta robot to derive the velocity of the end-effector in terms of the <b>angular</b> <b>joint</b> velocities, thus yielding the Jacobian matrices. Setting their determinants to zero, several undesirable postures of themanipulator have been extracted. The analysis of the inverse Jacobian matrix reveals that singularities are encountered when the limbs belonging to the same kinematic chain lie in a plane. Two of the possible configurations which correspond to this condition are when the robot is completely extended or contracted, indicating the boundaries of the workspace. Singularities associated with the direct Jacobian matrix, which correspond to relatively more complicated configurations of the manipulator, have also been derived and commented on. Moreover, the idea of intermediate Jacobian matrices have been introduced that are simpler to evaluate but still contain the information of the singularities mentioned earlier in addition to architectural singularities not contemplated in conventional Jacobians...|$|E
