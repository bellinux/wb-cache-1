5|$|Another of Harrison's goals was {{to raise}} {{the morale of the}} {{workforce}} and locomotive engineers; crews were assigned to the same locomotives, and senior engineers were allowed to paint their names on their engines. When business declined in 1914 Harrison reduced his salary by 20percent, but introduced smaller and graduated cuts for other staff, with the smallest percentages <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> pay scales. Other efforts to improve morale included rewards for fuel efficiency and the improvement of safety, including stricter investigation of accidents.|$|E
40|$|Temperature was an {{important}} factor in growth, development and reproduction of Meloidogyne hapla in lettuce. Growth, as measured by increase in diameter of females, was not appreciably different <b>at</b> <b>the</b> intermediate (21. 1 C night and 26. 7 C day) and high (26. 7 C night and 32. 2 C day) temperature regimes, but was considerably less <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>low</b> temperature regime (15. 5 C night and 21. 1 C day) than <b>at</b> <b>the</b> two higher temperature regimes.

5|$|Benzodiazepines can {{be useful}} for {{short-term}} treatment of insomnia. Their use beyond 2 to 4 weeks is not recommended due {{to the risk of}} dependence. It is preferred that benzodiazepines be taken intermittently and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> effective dose. They improve sleep-related problems by shortening the time spent in bed before falling asleep, prolonging the sleep time, and, in general, reducing wakefulness. However, they worsen sleep quality by increasing light sleep and decreasing deep sleep. Other drawbacks of hypnotics, including benzodiazepines, are possible tolerance to their effects, rebound insomnia, and reduced slow-wave sleep and a withdrawal period typified by rebound insomnia and a prolonged period of anxiety and agitation.|$|E

5|$|Russian {{scientist}} Peter Kropotkin {{first proposed}} {{the idea of}} fresh water under Antarctic ice sheets {{at the end of}} the 19th century.

Kropotkin's theory was further developed by Russian glaciologist I. A. Zotikov, who wrote his Ph.D. thesis on this subject in 1967.|$|E
5|$|Since 1974 Whitby {{has been}} {{administered}} by Scarborough Borough Council, {{one of the}} seven district councils in North Yorkshire. For borough council purposes the town comprises three wards, Mayfield, Streonshalh and Whitby West Cliff. The borough council is a non-metropolitan district, responsible for housing, planning, leisure and recreation, waste collection, environmental health and revenue collection. North Yorkshire County Council is a non-metropolitan county providing education, transport, highways, fire, waste disposal, social and library services. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> level of governance Whitby has a town council which, for election and administrative purposes, is divided into six electoral wards represented by 19 councillors responsible for burial grounds, allotments, play areas and street lighting.

5|$|The {{restored}} east range measures around 31m by 10m, with a {{pitched roof}} and crow-step gables. It is entered through a richly carved doorway, dated 1622 and initialled SWS for Sir William Sinclair, which gives {{access to the}} third floor. The three lower floors are cut into the rock, and each has four vaulted rooms, with a fifth in the south-east tower.

5|$|The tunnel {{runs through}} {{an area with}} complex and varied geology. It runs through two rock complexes, the Halsnøy Basement Rock on the Sveio side, and Hardangerfjord Cover Complex on the Stord side. Both were created during the {{creation}} of the Caledonian orogeny 500 million years ago. The Halsnøy Basement Rock consists of Precambrian rock with elements of gneiss of both sedimentary and magmatic origin. They range between granite gneiss to mylonite. In the area between the two complexes, there is some amount of gabbro. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> point, the tunnel runs through a section of phyllite, which continues to be the dominant species until the tunnel reaches Otterøya. Below the island the tunnel reaches a section of greenstone, before it rises again through more phyllite.|$|E
5|$|After taking 5/18 in an innings {{win over}} North Eastern Transvaal, Johnston was {{ineffective}} in the high-scoring drawn Fourth Test, taking 1/68. He took {{a total of}} 6/52 and scored 24 not out against Griqualand West, and finished the Test campaign with 3/22 in the Fifth Test in Port Elizabeth, taking all his wickets in the second innings as Australia completed an innings victory and took the series 4–0. It was a successful tour for Johnston, with 23 wickets at 17.04, taking the most wickets <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> average among the Australian pacemen among those who took more than three wickets. The entire first-class campaign was even more successful; Johnston took a total of 7/37 as the Australians ended their tour with an innings victory over a South African XI. Johnston ended the African summer with 53 wickets at 14.09.|$|E
5|$|Also to this end, and {{to provide}} more {{professional}} military leadership, Diocletian separated military from civil command <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>lowest,</b> provincial level. Governors of provinces on the frontiers were stripped of command of the troops stationed there in favour of purely military officers called duces limitis ("border commanders"). Some 20 duces may have been created under Diocletian. Most duces were given command of forces in a single province, but a few controlled more than one province e.g. the dux Pannoniae I et Norici. However, at higher echelons, military and administrative command remained united in the vicarii and praefecti praetorio. In addition, Diocletian completed {{the exclusion of the}} senatorial class, still dominated by the Italian aristocracy, from all senior military commands and from all top administrative posts except in Italy.|$|E

5|$|Classic {{examples}} are {{found at the}} Banff townsite proper: Mount Rundle is a classic dip slope mountain. Just {{to the north of}} the Banff townsite, Castle Mountain is composed of numerous Cambrian age rock formations. The uppermost section of the peak consists of relatively harder dolomite from the Eldon Formation. Below that lies the less dense shales of the Stephen Formation and the lowest exposed cliffs are limestones of the Cathedral Formation. Dogtooth mountains, such as Mount Louis, exhibit sharp, jagged slopes. The Sawback Range, which consists of nearly vertical dipping sedimentary layers, has been eroded by cross gullies. The erosion of these almost vertical layers of rock strata in the Sawback Range has resulted in formations that appear like the teeth on a saw blade. Erosion and deposition of higher elevation rock layers has resulted in scree deposits <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> elevations of many of the mountains.|$|E
5|$|The brain {{contains}} several motor {{areas that}} project {{directly to the}} spinal cord. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> level are motor areas in the medulla and pons, which control stereotyped movements such as walking, breathing, or swallowing. At a higher level are areas in the midbrain, such as the red nucleus, {{which is responsible for}} coordinating movements of the arms and legs. At a higher level yet is the primary motor cortex, a strip of tissue located at the posterior edge of the frontal lobe. The primary motor cortex sends projections to the subcortical motor areas, but also sends a massive projection directly to the spinal cord, through the pyramidal tract. This direct corticospinal projection allows for precise voluntary control of the fine details of movements. Other motor-related brain areas exert secondary effects by projecting to the primary motor areas. Among the most important secondary areas are the premotor cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum.|$|E
5|$|The {{control systems}} {{also had some}} innovations. The control column was {{centrally}} placed and the pilot sat {{on the port side}} of the cockpit. The column had an extension arm fitted and had the ability to be swung over to the starboard side in case the pilot was incapacitated. The control instruments were located above the pilot's head in the ceiling, which allowed viewing and did not block the pilot's vision. The fuel instruments were electrical. The He 111 used the inner fuel tanks, closest to the wing root, first. The outer tanks acted as reserve tanks. The pilot was alerted to the fuel level when there was 100L (26US gal) left. A manual pump was available in case of electrical or power failure but the delivery rate of just 4½L (1.2US gal) per minute demanded that the pilot fly <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> possible speed and just below 3,048m (10,000ft). The He 111 handled well at low speeds.|$|E
