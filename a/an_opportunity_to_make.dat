5|$|The {{possibility}} of an en passant capture is relevant to claims of a draw by threefold repetition. Two positions whose pieces are {{all on the same}} squares, with the same player to move, are for this purpose considered different if there was <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> an enpassant capture in the first position, and of course that opportunity no longer exists the second time the same configuration of pieces occurs.|$|E
5|$|This {{pay raise}} {{proposal}} was submitted as {{an amendment to}} the government's general appropriations bill. Had Grant vetoed the bill, the government would not have any money to operate for the following fiscal year, which would have necessitated a special session of Congress.

5|$|Apart {{from these}} more {{spectacular}} pieces of resistance, {{in some places}} chantry priests continued to say prayers and landowners to pay them to do so. Opposition to the removal of images was widespread—so much so that when during the Commonwealth, William Dowsing was commissioned {{to the task of}} image breaking in Suffolk, his task, as he records it, was enormous. In Kent and the southeast, compliance was mostly willing and for many, the sale of vestments and plate was <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> money (but it was also true that in London and Kent, Reformation ideas had permeated more deeply into popular thinking).|$|E

5|$|In 1942, Hepburn {{returned}} to Broadway {{to appear in}} another Philip Barry play, Without Love, which was also written with the actress in mind. Critics were unenthusiastic about the production but with Hepburn's popularity at a high it ran for 16 sold-out weeks. MGM was eager to reunite Tracy and Hepburn for a new picture, and settled on Keeper of the Flame (1942). A dark mystery with a propaganda message {{on the dangers of}} fascism, the film was seen by Hepburn as <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a worthy political statement. It received poor notices but was a financial success, confirming the popularity of the Tracy–Hepburn pairing.|$|E
5|$|Max Power conceded {{a penalty}} scored by Reuben Reid {{early in the}} {{penultimate}} {{game of the season}} against Plymouth. He himself equalised the score inside the first half, but soon after Plymouth regained the lead through Tareiq Holmes-Dennis. With ten minutes remaining, the hosts doubled the lead and though Kayode Odejayi scored in the final minutes it was another Tranmere defeat. As Hartlepool United, since December led by former Tranmere Rovers manager Ronnie Moore, won their home game against Exeter City, Tranmere lost their last chance to remain in the Football League. In the final game of the season Alan Rogers gave teenager Tolani Omotola <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> his Football League debut as Bury won the game by a single Tom Soares goal, to win promotion to the League One.|$|E

The author and lead developer, Marco Pesenti Gritti, endorsed them and saw the rewrite as <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> Galeon simpler. Many other developers believed that reducing the number of preferences and simplifying the user interface would harm the project.|$|E
25|$|The {{work on the}} {{extensions}} started October 14, 1971 with Line 1 (Green) {{towards the}} east to reach {{the site where the}} Olympic Stadium was to be built and Autoroute 25 (Honoré-Beaugrand station) that could serve as a transfer point for visitors arriving from outside. The extensions were <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> improvements to the network, such as new trains, larger stations and even semi-automatic control. The first extension was completed in June 1976 just before the Olympics. Line 1 was later extended to the southwest to reach the suburbs of Verdun and LaSalle with the Angrignon as the terminus station, named after the zoo. This station opened in September 1978.|$|E

25|$|Albert J. Goddard, {{who owned}} and gave name to {{steamboat}} A. J. Goddard, was a Seattle businessman {{who owned a}} foundry and had expertise in fabrication and steam engineering. When the Klondike Gold Rush started he saw <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a profit by transporting prospectors. He intended to supply them with a river boat on upper Yukon and bought parts for two small prefabricated steamboats from San Francisco which were transported north in pieces to Lake Bennett where they were reassembled by new company The Upper Yukon Company. They used the White Pass Trail {{or a combination of}} this and the parallel Chilkoot Trail and they arrived at Bennett Lake by March 1898. Thousands of men and women were camped at the lake, waiting for the ice to go out, building boats and rafts. Over the course of weeks the company assembled two 16-metre steel sternwheelers on the shores of the lake. The A.J. Goddard was completed first, followed by the F.H. Kilbourne.|$|E
25|$|Garry Sobers, the West Indies' {{captain and}} their best cricketer, caused {{controversy}} by {{playing in a}} double-wicket competition in Rhodesia in September 1970. Although Sobers spent only 48 hours in Salisbury, he had time for a meal with the prime minister, Ian Smith, and described him as a great man to talk to. Sobers' statement and his participation in the tournament gave Caribbean politicians <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> clear their hatred of apartheid and racism. The Guyanese prime minister, Forbes Burnham, said Sobers was not welcome in his country until there was an apology. The Jamaican government called for his resignation as captain. The Indian prime minister, Indira Gandhi, forbade the Indian cricket team to tour the West Indies until the matter was sorted out. Sobers initially argued {{that he had done}} nothing wrong as he was a cricketer, not a politician, but ultimately apologised in October 1970 when the scandal threatened to break the West Indies team.|$|E
25|$|Finally, {{with the}} economy in serious {{recession}} and interest rates touching seventeen per cent, Richmond's creditors came knocking. At one point, {{an attempt was made}} to seize the club's 1973 and 1974 premiership trophies as securities for unpaid debts, an embarrassing situation. For a number of years, the exact amount that the club owed was not publicly known. After Bartlett came Allan Jeans, who then passed the job to ex-Richmond premiership player John Northey for 1993. Northey returned the team to the simple long-kicking style of the halcyon days under the legendary Tom Hafey. Along with some draft concessions granted by the AFL, Northey's efforts gradually improved Richmond. The team fumbled <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the 1994 finals, then opened 1995 with its best start to a season in 75 years and eventually made it to the preliminary final. With a talented playing list and a strong administration led by Leon Daphne (Richmond's first president from the corporate world, the Alan Bond farce aside), Richmond looked set to become regular finalists again.|$|E
