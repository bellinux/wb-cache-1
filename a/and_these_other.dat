5|$|Communications signals {{can be sent}} {{either by}} analog signals or digital signals. There are analog {{communication}} systems and digital communication systems. For an analog signal, the signal is varied continuously {{with respect to the}} information. In a digital signal, the information is encoded as a set of discrete values (for example, a set of ones and zeros). During the propagation and reception, the information contained in analog signals will inevitably be degraded by undesirable physical noise. (The output of a transmitter is noise-free for all practical purposes.) Commonly, the noise in a communication system can be expressed as adding or subtracting from the desirable signal in a completely random way. This form of noise is called additive noise, with the understanding that the noise can be negative or positive at different instants of time. Noise that is not additive noise is a much more difficult situation to describe or analyze, <b>and</b> <b>these</b> <b>other</b> kinds of noise will be omitted here.|$|E

25|$|Circa 1504, Raphael {{executed}} {{a pen and}} ink sketch, today in the Louvre museum, in which the subject is flanked by large columns,. Experts universally agree {{it is based on}} Leonardo’s portrait of Mona Lisa. Other later copies of the Mona Lisa, such as that in the National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design in Oslo, and The Walters Art Museum in Baltimore also display large flanking columns. As a result, it was originally thought that the Mona Lisa in the Louvre had side columns and had been cut. However, as early as 1993, Zöllner observed that the painting surface had never been trimmed. This was confirmed through a series of tests conducted in 2004. In view of this, Vincent Delieuvin, curator of 16th century Italian painting at the Louvre museum states that the sketch <b>and</b> <b>these</b> <b>other</b> copies must have been inspired by another version, while Frank Zöllner states that the sketch brings up the possibility that Leonardo {{executed a}}nother work on the subject of Mona Lisa.|$|E

500|$|During {{the last}} glacial period (110,000 to 10,000 years ago), {{especially}} in the Wisconsinian glaciation (31,000 to 10,000 years ago), the climate of Southern California changed radically from arid to wet, to a climate likely similar to the present-day Pacific Northwest. Prodigious rainfall gradually turned the small streams of the region into large and powerful rivers. It was this surge in volume that allowed Aliso Creek and other rivers {{to cut through the}} San Joaquin Hills. A [...] drop in sea level escalated the process, allowing the rivers to flow more rapidly and have more erosive power. As sea levels rose after the Wisconsinian glaciation, the water gaps the rivers had cut through the San Joaquin Hills, including Aliso Canyon, became fjord-like inlets. Aliso Creek <b>and</b> <b>these</b> <b>other</b> streams deposited sediments into the inlets, turning them into flat-floored alluvial valleys with an elevation very close to sea level. Eventually, the sediment deposited met the coastline. By then, the rivers and streams had diminished to their original flow before the glaciation.|$|E

The lack of the letter [...] "F" [...] in the pre-1987 Philippine alphabet, Abakada, had caused the letter [...] "F" [...] to be substituted with [...] "P". Upon official adoption of the modern, 28-letter Filipino alphabet in 1987, the term Filipino was preferred over Pilipino.

2500|$|Troy weight, avoirdupois weight, and apothecaries' weight are all {{built from}} the same basic unit, the grain, {{which is the same}} in all three systems. However, while each system has some overlap in the names of their units of measure (all have ounces and pounds), the {{relationship}} between the grain <b>and</b> <b>these</b> <b>other</b> units within each system varies. For example, in apothecary and troy weight, the pound and ounce are the same, but are different from the pound and ounce in avoirdupois in terms of their relationships to grains and to each other. The systems also have different units between the grain and ounce (apothecaries' has scruple and dram, troy has pennyweight, and avoirdupois has just dram, sometimes spelled drachm). [...] The dram in avoirdupois weighs just under half of the dram in apothecaries'. The fluid dram unit of volume is based on the weight of 1 dram of water in the apothecaries' system.|$|E
2500|$|According to Gallego Romero et al. (2011), their {{research}} on lactose tolerance in India suggests that [...] "the west Eurasian genetic contribution identified by Reich et al. (2009) principally reflects gene flow from Iran and the Middle East." [...] Gallego Romero notes that Indians who are lactose-tolerant show a genetic pattern regarding this tolerance which is [...] "characteristic {{of the common}} European mutation." [...] According to Gallego Romero, this suggests that [...] "the most common lactose tolerance mutation made a two-way migration out of the Middle East less than 10,000 years ago. While the mutation spread across Europe, another explorer must have brought the mutation eastward to India – likely traveling {{along the coast of}} the Persian Gulf where other pockets of the same mutation have been found." [...] In contrast, Allentoft et al.

2500|$|Another type {{of still}} life, known as ontbijtjes or [...] "breakfast paintings", {{represent}} both a literal presentation of delicacies that {{the upper class}} might enjoy and a religious reminder to avoid gluttony. [...] Around 1650 Samuel van Hoogstraten painted {{one of the first}} wall-rack pictures, trompe-l'œil still-life paintings which feature objects tied, tacked or attached in some other fashion to a wall board, a type of still life very popular in the United States in the 19th century. Another variation was the trompe-l'œil still life depicted objects associated with a given profession, as with the Cornelis Norbertus Gysbrecht’s painting [...] "Painter’s Easel with Fruit Piece", which displays all the tools of a painter’s craft. Also popular {{in the first half of}} the 17th century was the painting of a large assortment of specimens in allegorical form, such as the [...] "five senses", [...] "four continents", or [...] "the four seasons", showing a goddess or allegorical figure surrounded by appropriate natural and man-made objects. The popularity of vanitas paintings, <b>and</b> <b>these</b> <b>other</b> forms of still life, soon spread from Holland to Flanders and Germany, and also to Spain and France.|$|E
2500|$|In June 1984, Burroughs-Wellcome {{virologist}} Marty St. Clair set up {{a program}} to discover drugs {{with the potential to}} inhibit HIV replication. Burroughs-Wellcome had expertise in nucleoside analogs and viral diseases, led by researchers including George Hitchings, Gertrude Elion, David Barry, Paul (Chip) McGuirt Jr., Philip Furman, Martha St. Clair, Janet Rideout, Sandra Lehrman and others. Their research efforts were focused in part on the viral enzyme reverse transcriptase. Reverse transcriptase is an enzyme that retroviruses, including HIV, utilize to replicate themselves. Secondary testing was performed in mouse cells infected with the retroviruses Friend virus or Harvey sarcoma virus, as the Wellcome group did not have a viable in-house HIV antiviral assay in place at that time, <b>and</b> <b>these</b> <b>other</b> retroviruses were believed to represent reasonable surrogates. [...] AZT proved to be a remarkably potent inhibitor of both Friend virus and Harvey sarcoma virus, and a search of the company's records showed that it had demonstrated low toxicity when tested for its antibacterial activity in rats many years earlier. Based in part on these results, AZT was selected by nucleoside chemist Janet Rideout as one of 11 compounds to send to the NCI for testing in that organization's HIV antiviral assay.|$|E

The Bissetts <b>and</b> <b>these</b> <b>other</b> [...] "English" [...] families were those who had become like the Gaelic Irish, adopting their concepts of sovereignty, manners and styles. This was sometimes referred to as becoming more Irish than the Irish themselves, although the extent of Gaelicization varied by family. Some families were later brought back, and others not. We never get to find out in the case of the Bissetts because they have apparently gone under by the time the Kingdom of Ireland is proclaimed and Henry begins receiving the submission of the princes.|$|E
