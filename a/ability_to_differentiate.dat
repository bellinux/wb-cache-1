5|$|Children {{under five}} years old display the least {{effective}} strategies for delaying gratification, such as looking at the reward and thinking about its arousing features. By 5 years old, most children are able to demonstrate better self-control by recognizing the counter-productivity of focusing on the reward. Five-year-olds often choose instead to actively distract themselves or even use self-instructions to remind themselves of the contingency that waiting produces a reward of a greater value. Between 8 and 13 years old, children develop the cognitive <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>differentiate</b> and employ abstract versus arousing thoughts in order to distract their minds from the reward and thereby increase the delay. Once delaying strategies are developed, the capacity to resist temptation is relatively stable throughout adulthood. Preschoolers' performance on delayed gratification tasks correlates with their adolescent performance on tasks designed to measure similar constructs and processing, which parallels the corresponding development of willpower and the fronto-striatal circuit (neural pathways that connect the frontal lobe to other brain regions). Declines in self-regulation and impulse control in old age predict corresponding declines in reward-delaying strategies, specifically reduced temporal discounting due to a decrease in cooling strategies.|$|E

5000|$|The most typical {{psychological}} {{term for}} functions {{carried out by}} the prefrontal cortex area is executive function. Executive function relates <b>to</b> <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>differentiate</b> among conflicting thoughts, determine good and bad, better and best, same and different, future consequences of current activities, working toward a defined goal, prediction of outcomes, expectation based on actions, and social [...] "control" [...] (the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> suppress urges that, if not suppressed, could lead to socially unacceptable outcomes).|$|R
30|$|After {{the first}} passage, both SGC and LPC in dense {{cultures}} acquired the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> form clusters of small well-proliferating cells and large epithelial-like cells (Figures  1 C, D).

40|$|In {{the recent}} years, {{multipotent}} cells, like mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs), gained considerable interest in cell based {{cartilage tissue engineering}} strategies. MSCs <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>differentiate</b> into chondrocytes {{as well as to}} act as trophic mediators makes them a promising cell source for the use in cartilage repair. In general, this thesis addresses three major aspects for the use of MSCs in cartilage tissue engineering: I) the role of low oxygen tension to improve MSC performance during cellular expansion II) the role of low oxygen tension to alter chondrogenic differentiation quantity and quality and III) revealing MSCs role in co-culture approaches with human chondrocytes...|$|R
25|$|Endothelial {{stem cells}} {{are one of the}} three types of {{multipotent}} stem cells found in the bone marrow. They are a rare and controversial group with the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>differentiate</b> into endothelial cells, the cells that line blood vessels.|$|E
25|$|Other {{considerations}} for starting cell type include mutational load (for example, skin cells may harbor more mutations due to UV exposure), {{time it takes}} to expand the population of starting cells, and the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>differentiate</b> into a given cell type.|$|E
25|$|Mesenchymal {{stem cells}} (MSCs) are of stromal origin and may {{differentiate}} into {{a variety of}} tissues. MSCs have been isolated from placenta, adipose tissue, lung, bone marrow and blood, Wharton's jelly from the umbilical cord, and teeth (perivascular niche of dental pulp and periodontal ligament). MSCs are attractive for clinical therapy due to their <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>differentiate,</b> provide trophic support, and modulate innate immune response. These cells have the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>differentiate</b> into various cell types such as osteoblasts, chondroblasts, adipocytes, neuroectodermal cells, and hepatocytes. Bioactive mediators that favor local cell growth are also secreted by MSCs. Anti-inflammatory effects on the local microenvironment, which promote tissue healing, are also observed. The inflammatory response can be modulated by adipose-derived regenerative cells (ADRC) including mesenchymal stem cells and regulatory T-lymphocytes. The mesenchymal stem cells thus alter the outcome of the immune response by changing the cytokine secretion of dendritic and T-cell subsets. This results in a shift from a pro-inflammatory environment to an anti-inflammatory or tolerant cell environment.|$|E
5000|$|The {{reactivation}} of hTERT, {{and subsequently}} telomerase, in human iPS cells {{has been used}} as an indication of pluripotency and reprogramming to an ES (embryonic stem) cell-like state when using mortal cells. [...] Reprogrammed cells that do not express sufficient hTERT levels enter a quiescent state following a number of replications depending on the length of the telomeres while maintaining stem cell-like <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>differentiate.</b> Reactivation of TERT activity can be achieved using only three of the four reprogramming factors described by Takahashi and Yamanaka: To be specific, Oct3/4, Sox2 and Klf4 are essential, whereas c-Myc is not. However, this study was done with cells containing endogenous levels of c-Myc that may have been sufficient for reprogramming.|$|R
30|$|There are {{ethical issues}} {{regarding}} the use of embryonic stem cells. However, induced pluripotent stem cells formed from fully differentiated somatic cells were found to possess an embryonic-like state. These cells have the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> easily <b>differentiate</b> into large numbers of cardiomyocytes [14]. However, the use of proliferative undifferentiated pluripotent cells carries the risk of teratoma formation. Therefore, it is essential <b>to</b> <b>differentiate</b> the cells into cardiac lineages prior to transplantation.|$|R
5000|$|As organisms age and cells proliferate, telomeres shorten {{with each}} round of replication. Cells {{restricted}} {{to a specific}} lineage are capable of division only a set number of times, set by the length of telomeres, before they senesce. [...] Depletion and uncapping of telomeres {{has been linked to}} organ degeneration, failure, and fibrosis due to progenitors' becoming quiescent and unable <b>to</b> <b>differentiate.</b> Using an in vivo TERT deficient mouse model, reactivation of the TERT gene in quiescent populations in multiple organs reactivated telomerase and restored the cells’ <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>differentiate.</b> [...] Reactivation of TERT down-regulates DNA damage signals associated with cellular mitotic checkpoints allowing for proliferation and elimination of a degenerative phenotype. In another study, introducing the TERT gene into healthy one-year-old mice using an engineered adeno-associated virus led to a 24% increase in lifespan, without any increase in cancer.|$|R
25|$|Vertebrate palaeontology {{is heavily}} {{dependent}} on the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>differentiate</b> between different species {{in a way that}} is consistent both within a particular genus and across all organisms. The Bothriolepis genus is no exception to this principle. Listed below are a few of the notable species within the genus Bothriolepis; more than sixty species have been named in total, and it is likely that a sizeable proportion of them are valid due to the cosmopolitan nature of Bothriolepis.|$|E
25|$|Hep-2 cells, {{originally}} of laryngeal carcinoma origin, {{are actually}} a contamination of HeLa cells. They are routinely {{used in the}} diagnosis of ANA in diagnostic laboratories. HEp-2 cells provide a greater <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>differentiate</b> patterns of ANA than animal sections, due to the large nuclei and high mitotic rate of the cell line. Upon incubation with serum containing anti-dsDNA antibodies and fluorescent labelled secondary antibodies, homogeneous staining of interphase nuclei and condensed chromosomal staining of mitotic cells can be seen.|$|E
25|$|Properties of {{stem cells}} can be {{illustrated}} in vitro, using methods such as clonogenic assays, in which single cells are assessed for their <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>differentiate</b> and self-renew. Stem cells can also be isolated by their possession of a distinctive set of cell surface markers. However, in vitro culture conditions can alter the behavior of cells, making it unclear whether the cells shall behave {{in a similar manner}} in vivo. There is considerable debate as to whether some proposed adult cell populations are truly stem cells.|$|E
30|$|The {{other type}} of stem cell {{currently}} being investigated for its <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> treat OA is the mesenchymal stem cell (MSC). MSCs are a heterogeneous group of stromal cells that can come {{from a variety of}} sources including adipose tissue, bone marrow, and synovium; numerous studies have proven MSCs’ <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>differentiate</b> into chondrocytes and regeneratively treat OA [20]. While MSCs have a limited proliferative potential in comparison to pluripotent stem cells, many advantages exist for MSC based therapies [31]. MSCs and iPSCs offer the most realistic and best potential for viable regenerative cell treatment of OA; however, MSC based therapies have less risks associated with them and an easier means of production. The source of MSCs for treatment of OA is an important factor in cartilage tissue engineering and each cell type has its pros and cons (Table  2).|$|R
3000|$|Besides {{improving}} {{accuracy and}} efficiency of the machine-learning algorithms, FS techniques allow understanding, reducing and visualizing data as well as reducing storage and computational costs. Three main FS methods exist: (1) wrapper uses a learning algorithm; they are slow because they scan the whole space, searching the features subset which offers the highest learning performance, (2) Filter methods rank features independently of classifiers. Based on statistics (correlations, maximum variations, etc.) or on information theory (mutual information, entropy, etc.), features are selected depending on their <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>differentiate</b> data samples belonging to different clusters [...]. Filters are fast and do not require great computational resources, and (3) embedded methods are hybrids. They inject the feature selection technique into the learning algorithms as filtering step.|$|R
40|$|Adipose {{stem cells}} have {{prominent}} implications in tissue regeneration {{due to their}} abundance and relative ease of harvest from adipose tissue and their <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>differentiate</b> into mature cells of various tissue lineages and secrete various growth cytokines. Development of tissue engineering techniques in combination with various carrier scaffolds and adipose stem cells offers great potential in overcoming the existing limitations constraining classical approaches used in plastic and reconstructive surgery. However, as most tissue engineering techniques are new and highly experimental, {{there are still many}} practical challenges that must be overcome before laboratory research can lead to large-scale clinical applications. Tissue engineering is currently a growing field of medical research; in this review, we will discuss the progress in research on biomaterials and scaffolds for tissue engineering applications using adipose stem cells...|$|R
25|$|Pattern {{separation}} is the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>differentiate</b> one memory from other stored memories. Pattern separation {{begins in the}} dentate gyrus, {{a section of the}} hippocampus involved in memory formation and retrieval. Granule cells in the dentate gyrus process sensory information using competitive learning, and relay a preliminary representation to form place fields. Place fields are extremely specific, as they are capable of remapping and adjusting firing rates in response to subtle sensory signal changes. This specificity is critical for pattern separation, as it distinguishes memories from one another.|$|E
25|$|However, {{even among}} primates, full color vision differs between New World and Old World monkeys. Old World primates, {{including}} monkeys and all apes, have vision similar to humans. New World monkeys {{may or may}} not have color sensitivity at this level: in most species, males are dichromats, and about 60% of females are trichromats, but the owl monkeys are cone monochromats, and both sexes of howler monkeys are trichromats. Visual sensitivity differences between males and females in a single species is due to the gene for yellow-green sensitive opsin protein (which confers <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>differentiate</b> red from green) residing on the X sex chromosome.|$|E
25|$|Stem {{cells are}} {{characterized}} by their ability to self-renew for a prolonged time and still maintain the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>differentiate</b> along one or more cell lineages. Stem cells may be unipotent, multipotent, or pluripotent, meaning they can differentiate into one, multiple, or all cell types, respectively. Pluripotent stem cells can become cells derived {{from any of the}} three embryonic germ layers. Stem cells have the advantage over glial cells because they are able to proliferate more easily in culture. However, it remains difficult to preferentially differentiate these cells into varied cell types in an ordered manner. Another difficulty with stem cells is the lack of a well-defined definition of stem cells beyond hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Each stem cell 'type' has more than one method for identifying, isolating, and expanding the cells; this has caused much confusion because all stem cells of a 'type' (neural, mesenchymal, retinal) do not necessarily behave in the same manner under identical conditions.|$|E
50|$|The {{functional}} neuroimaging modalities of SPECT and PET {{are more}} useful in assessing long-standing cognitive dysfunction, {{since they have}} shown similar <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> diagnose dementia as a clinical exam and cognitive testing.

25|$|Adult {{stem cells}} {{are not able to}} proliferate and {{differentiate}} as effectively in vitro as they are able to in vivo. Adult stem cells can come from many different tissue locations, {{but it is difficult to}} isolate them because they are defined by behavior and not surface markers. A method has yet to be developed for clearly distinguishing between stem cells and the differentiated cells surrounding them. However, surface markers can still be used to a certain extent to remove most of the unwanted differentiated cells. Stem cell plasticity is the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>differentiate</b> across embryonic germ line boundaries. Though, the presence of plasticity has been hotly contested. Some claim that plasticity is caused by heterogeneity among the cells or cell fusion events. Currently, cells can be differentiated across cell lines with yields ranging from 10% to 90% depending on techniques used. More studies need to be done in order to standardize the yield with transdifferentiation. Transdifferentiation of multipotent stem cells is a potential means for obtaining stem cells that are not available or not easily obtained in the adult.|$|E
25|$|The {{impetus for}} SCNT-based stem cell {{research}} has been decreased by the development and improvement of alternative methods of generating stem cells. Methods to reprogram normal body cells into pluripotent stem cells were developed in humans in 2007. The following year, this method achieved a key goal of SCNT-based {{stem cell research}}: the derivation of pluripotent stem cell lines that have all genes linked to various diseases. Some scientists working on SCNT-based stem cell research have recently moved to the new methods of induced pluripotent stem cells. Though recent studies have put in question how similar iPS cells are to embryonic stem cells. Epigenetic memory in iPS affects the cell lineage it can differentiate into. For instance, an iPS cell derived from a blood cell will be more efficient at differentiating into blood cells, while it will be less efficient at creating a neuron. This {{raises the question of}} how well iPS cells can mimic the gold standard ESC in experiments, as stem cells are defined as having the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>differentiate</b> into any cell type. SCNT stem cells do not pose such a problem and continue to remain relevant in stem cell studies.|$|E
25|$|Inserting neurons into a bioartificial nerve conduit {{seems like}} the most obvious method for {{replacing}} damaged nerves; however, neurons are unable to proliferate and they are often short-lived in culture. Thus, neural progenitor cells are more promising candidates for replacing damaged and degenerated neurons because they are self-renewing, which allows for the in vitro production of many cells with minimal donor material. In order {{to confirm that the}} new neurons formed from neural progenitor cells are a part of a functional network, the presence of synapse formation is required. A study by Ma, Fitzgerald et al. is the first demonstration of murine neural stem and progenitor cell-derived functional synapse and neuronal network formation on a 3D collagen matrix. The neural progenitor cells expanded and spontaneously differentiated into excitable neurons and formed synapses; furthermore, they retained the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>differentiate</b> into the three neural tissue lineages. It was also demonstrated that not only active synaptic vesicle recycling occurred, but also that excitatory and inhibitory connections capable of generating action potentials spontaneously were formed. Thus, neural progenitor cells are a viable and relatively unlimited source for creating functional neurons.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{a unique}} reflective writing assignment {{used in an}} undergraduate social work course on human sexuality. We ask what new understandings reflective writing mediates (Vygotsky, 1978) regarding sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender relationsâ€”oft-neglected topics within pre-professional academic programs. One goal for this assignment was to mediate future social workers' <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>differentiate</b> between thoughts and feelings, and we evaluate {{the degree to which}} students did so in their writing. By adapting Hatton and Smith's (1994) framework for analyzing reflective writing, we also distinguish between descriptive and dialogical reflection, identifying and analyzing examples of both within the students' writing. Findings suggest that students engaged primarily in descriptive reflection, but also engaged in some dialogical reflection. We argue that both are useful but that the latter mediates deeper and more useful learning. We present recommendations for enhancing reflective writing assignment design in pre-professional academic programs...|$|R
40|$|The {{prognosis}} {{of breast}} cancer patients improves with early and accurate diagnosis. The quality of the strain image produced by displacement estimation algorithms are heavily influenced by the RF echo data recorded by different ultrasound systems. A small clinical {{study was conducted with}} 21 women having a single nonpalpable breast lesion, each detected mammographically with later pathology confirmation. Elasticity images were acquired on each patient to test for the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>differentiating</b> malignant and benign lesions. The mechanical relaxation time T 1 images showed a tissue-specific T 1 contrast that is negative for all 11 malignant lesions and positive for all 10 benign lesions. Strain images were estimated using a regularized multi-scale optical flow (ROF) algorithm. Adjustments to the input parameters to the ROF and their subsequent effects on T 1 estimation and computation time are shown to have a strong effect on diagnostic performance. ii To My Parents and Grandparents...|$|R
50|$|Oogonial {{stem cells}} (OSCs), {{also known as}} egg {{precursor}} cells or female germline cells, are diploid germline cells with stem cell characteristics, namely the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> self-renew and <b>differentiate</b> into other cell types different from their tissue of origin.|$|R
25|$|Supra{{threshold}} tests, {{which provide}} intensities of taste stimuli above threshold levels, {{are used to}} assess the patient's <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>differentiate</b> between different intensities of taste and to estimate the magnitude of suprathreshold loss of taste. From these tests, ratings of pleasantness can be obtained using either the direct scaling or magnitude matching method and may be of value in the diagnosis of dysgeusia. Direct scaling tests show the ability to discriminate among different intensities of stimuli and whether a stimulus of one quality (sweet) is stronger or weaker than a stimulus of another quality (sour). Direct scaling cannot be used to determine if a taste stimulus is being perceived at abnormal levels. In this case, magnitude matching is used, in which a patient is asked to rate the intensities of taste stimuli and stimuli of another sensory system, such as the loudness of a tone, on a similar scale. For example, the Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical Research Center asks patients to rate the intensities of NaCl, sucrose, citric acid and quinine-HCl stimuli, and the loudness of 1000Hz tones. Assuming normal hearing, the results of this cross-sensory test show the relative strength of the sense of taste in relation to the loudness of the auditory stimulus. Although many of the tests are based on ratings using the direct scaling method, some tests do use the magnitude-matching procedure.|$|E

The Quality of Service (QoS) for these networks is critical to their effectiveness. Evaluation of QoS in wireless networks provides information that supports their management.

In this work, fuzzy c-means clustering (FCM) and Kohonen unsupervised neural networks were compared for their <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>differentiate</b> between Good, Average and Poor QoS for voice over IP (VoIP) traffic. Fuzzy inference system (FIS), linear regression and multilayer perceptron (MLP) were evaluated to quantify QoS for VoIP.

40|$|Direct {{reprogramming}} {{of human}} somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells by defined transcription factors (TFs) provides great potential for regenerative medicine and biomedical research. This procedure has many challenges, including low reprogramming efficiency, many partially reprogrammed colonies, somatic coding mutations in the genome, etc. Here, we describe a simple approach for generating fully reprogrammed human iPS cells by using a single polycistronic retroviral vector expressing four human TFs in a single open reading frame (ORF), combined with a cocktail containing three small molecules (Sodium butyrate, SB 431542, and PD 0325901). Our results demonstrate that human iPS cells generated by this approach express human ES cells markers and exhibit pluripotency demonstrated by their <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>differentiate</b> into the three germ layers in vitro and in vivo. Notably, this approach not only provides a much faster reprogramming process but also significantly diminishes partially reprogrammed iPS cell colonies, thus facilitating efficient isolation of desired fully reprogrammed iPS cell colonies...|$|R
50|$|Other {{experiments}} {{have been conducted}} that show animals' <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>differentiate</b> between non-food quantities. American black bears demonstrated quantity differentiation abilities in a task with a computer screen. The bears were trained to touch a computer monitor with a paw or nose to choose a quantity of dots {{in one of two}} boxes on the screen. Each bear was trained with reinforcement to pick a larger or smaller amount. During training, the bears were rewarded with food for a correct response. All bears performed better than what random error predicted on the trials with static, non-moving dots, indicating that they could differentiate between the two quantities. The bears choosing correctly in congruent (number of dots coincided with area of the dots) and incongruent (number of dots did not coincide with area of the dots) trials suggests that they were indeed choosing between quantities that appeared on the screen, not just a larger or smaller retinal image, which would indicate they are only judging size.|$|R
