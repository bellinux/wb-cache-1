The identification division specifies {{the name and}} type of the source element and is where classes and interfaces are specified. The environment division specifies <b>any</b> <b>program</b> features that depend on the system running it, such as files and character sets. The data division is used to declare variables and parameters. The procedure division contains the program's statements. Each division is sub-divided into sections, which {{are made up of}} paragraphs.|$|E

Specifically, the trusted computing base must at least prevent its own software from being written to.|$|E

25|$|Lougheed {{spent most}} of his tenure as premier in a bitter fight with the federal {{government}} over control of Alberta's resources. His first term also saw the start of a decade-long development boom, and he later established the Alberta Heritage Savings Trust Fund, which used oil revenues to invest for the long term in such areas as health care and research. He won an even stronger mandate in 1975, reducing the opposition to only six MLAs in total (four Socreds, one New Democrat and one independent) on a record 62.7 percent of the popular vote, more than Manning had drawn during the height of Social Credit's power in the 1950s. He would lead the party to two more landslide victories in 1979 and 1982. His last victory netted the PCs a staggering 75 seats out of 79: in terms of percentage of seats won, the second-largest majority government in the province's history. As a result, he governed with very large majorities for virtually his entire tenure and {{was in a position to}} enact practically <b>any</b> <b>program</b> he wanted. Indeed, the six MLAs he faced in 1975 would be the most opposition he would face during his last decade in office. That served him well, since he was a Red Tory leading a party whose base was dominated by social conservatives in rural parts of the province.|$|E

This record {{includes}} a 750–109 (.873) mark at historic Allen Fieldhouse. The Jayhawks are first in NCAA history with 97 winning seasons, and tied for first in NCAA history with 100 non-losing (.500 or better) seasons with Kentucky. Kansas has the fewest head coaches (8) of <b>any</b> <b>program</b> {{that has been}} around 100 years, yet has reached the Final Four under more head coaches (6) than any other program in the nation. Every head coach at Kansas {{since the inception of}} the NCAA Tournament has led the program to the Final Four. Kansas has had four head coaches inducted into the Naismith Hall of Fame, more than any other program in the nation. A perennial conference powerhouse, Kansas leads Division I all-time in regular season conference titles with 60 in 110 years of conference play (the MVIAA Conference was created in 1907) through the 2016–17 regular season. The Jayhawks have won a record 17 conference titles and a record 10 conference tournament titles in the 21 years of the Big 12's existence. The program also owns the best Big 12 records in both those areas with a 274–57 record in conference play and a 41–10 record in tournament play. The Jayhawks won their 2,000th game in school history when they defeated Texas Tech in the 2009–2010 season, joining the University of Kentucky and the University of North Carolina as the only schools to boast such an achievement at that time.|$|E

[...] The displacement of Indians was facilitated by the growth of the railroad and the eradication of the buffalo.
