50|$|In {{monitoring}} and security solutions, {{an important contribution}} to <b>alarm</b> <b>detection</b> and alarm verification can be supplied, using sound recognition techniques. In particular, these methods could be helpful for intrusion detection in places like offices, stores, private homes or for the supervision of public premises exposed to person aggression. In all these cases, a recognition system can report about a danger or distress event. It could further identify sounds like glass break, doorbells, smoke detector alarms, red alerts, human screams, baby cries and others. Sometimes, the alarm is triggered by other of detectors (e.g. temperature or video-based) and the sound recognizer would be associated to these other modalities, to verify the alarm, with the purpose of decreasing the global false <b>alarm</b> <b>detection</b> rate.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} real-time {{adaptation of}} <b>alarm</b> <b>detection</b> models {{in a remote}} health monitoring system based on user feedback. Real-time adaptation enables systems to fine-tune {{to the needs and}} preferences of the user and changes in the environment. This way, the system performance is improved in terms of technical accuracy and subjective user wishes. Two types of <b>alarm</b> <b>detection</b> models were used: (1) models in the form of rules created by domain expert and (2) models induced by machine learning. The problem of adaptation for the rule-based models is defined as Markov decision process. Machine-learning models are adapted by rebuilding the model every time new data is obtained. We tested the adaptation capabilities of the two types of <b>alarm</b> <b>detection</b> models based on their accuracy and time-to-alarm (needed length of possibly critical activity, such as lying on the ground, which causes the models to raise an alarm). Both types of models achieved 90 % <b>alarm</b> <b>detection</b> accuracy. The rule-based models decreased time-to-alarm when user-triggered alarms were raised and increased it when the user indicated false alarm. We did not observe this process for the machine-learning models. 1...|$|E

In sequential decision making domains and domains in which creating representative dataset is expensive and time consuming, learning through interaction {{is the only}} feasible way to train a system.

Reinforcement learning is an approach for learning optimal action policy via experiencing, i. e. using observed reward in environment states. Reinforcement learning algorithms include adaptive dynamic programming, temporal difference learning and Q-learning[1]. Examples of successful applications of reinforcement learning are controller for sustained inverted flight on an autonomous helicopter [2] and learning to play the soccer game Keepaway[3].

All the messages considered as urgent need a quick answer from the call-center service in order to satisfy the customer. The strategy proposed is based on a classification scheme that takes into account all the features that can characterize a survey: answers to the closed questions, topics and opinions detected in the open question spoken message, confidence scores from the Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) modules. A field trial realized among real customers has shown that despite the ASR robustness issues, our system efficiently ranks the most urgent messages and brings a finer analysis on the surveys than the one provided by processing the closed questions alone...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an intelligent surveillance platform {{based on the}} usage {{of large numbers of}} inexpensive sensors designed and developed inside the European Eureka Celtic project HuSIMS. With the aim of maximizing the number of deployable units while keeping monetary and resource/bandwidth costs at a minimum, the surveillance platform is based on the usage of inexpensive visual sensors which apply efficient motion detection and tracking algorithms to transform the video signal in a set of motion parameters. In order to automate the analysis of the myriad of data streams generated by the visual sensors, the platform’s control center includes an <b>alarm</b> <b>detection</b> engine which comprises three components applying three different Artificial Intelligence strategies in parallel. These strategies are generic, domain-independent approaches which are able to operate in several domains (traffic surveillance, vandalism prevention, perimeter security, etc.). The architecture is completed with a versatile communication network which facilitates data collection from the visual sensors and alarm and video stream distribution towards the emergency teams. The resulting surveillance system is extremely suitable for its deployment in metropolitan areas, smart cities, and large facilities, mainly because cheap visual sensors and autonomous <b>alarm</b> <b>detection</b> facilitate dense sensor network deployments for wide and detailed coverage...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{acoustic}} environment {{is critical in}} Air Traffic Control (ATC), as operators exchange information with planes and must also {{be aware of the}} occurrence of auditory alarms. In such situations, observing inattentional deafness is likely. In this study, we aimed to identify the physiological indicators of inattentional deafness through the analysis of the P 300 evoked potential, known to be an indicator of attention allocation, an important step to a stimulus reaching consciousness. Based {{on the assumption that the}} high mental load generated by an ATC task may reduce the <b>alarm</b> <b>detection</b> rate, we wished to test whether this effect would be reflected in the alarm-evoked P 300 amplitude. Participants had to perform simulated ATC tasks within the LABY microworld while electroencephalographic (EEG) activity was recorded. Simultaneously to the LABY tasks, participants were asked to respond to target tones (the “alarm”) and to ignore standard tones. Behavioral results showed that 4. 6 % of alarms were not reported. For these <b>alarm</b> <b>detection</b> failures, the EEG analysis showed a diminution of the P 300 amplitude in comparison to a control condition in which participants only focused on the tones. These results suggest that the P 300 amplitude seems to be a valid physiological indicator of vulnerability to inattentional deafness in complex environments. Relevant applications include the prevention of alarm omission and the assessment of warning designs...|$|E
40|$|Cyber-Physical System (CPS) is an {{integration}} of physical processes with computation and communication. CPS connects {{the virtual world}} with physical world. It {{has the ability to}} add more intelligence to social life. A CPS integrates physical devices, such as sensors and cameras, with cyber (or informational) components to form a situation-integrated analytical system that responds intelligently to dynamic changes in the real-world scenarios. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) can be a vital part of CPS as strong sensing capabilities {{can be one of the}} major driving factors for CPS applications. Still CPS is considered as a nascent technology and there are many challenges yet to be addressed. These challenges are often posed due to the complexity of communication, computation and the uncertainty of physical processes. CPS can have wide ranging applications, such as smart medical technology, assisted living, environmental control and traffic management. Unfortunately, no unified architecture for CPS has yet been developed, primarily due to variations among the applications. In CPS healthcare application, a wide range of medical sensors are used, however these sensors generate a large number of false alarms. These false alarms add confusion and reduce the efficiency of overall healthcare service. Although a few CPS healthcare architectures have been proposed for healthcare application they all lack of efficient false <b>alarm</b> <b>detection.</b> In this paper, a novel false <b>alarm</b> <b>detection</b> architecture is proposed in CPS for healthcare applications. ...|$|E
40|$|Several <b>alarm</b> <b>detection</b> {{strategies}} for real-time STsegment monitoring (including detection using any single lead, any two leads, any two contiguous leads, any three leads, and STindex, computed as {{the sum of}} the absolute ST values from three quasi-orthogonal leads) have been evaluated using a 12 -lead ST database generated from the Dalhousie PTCA database. The database includes 95 patients with a total of 202 balloon occlusions. For all the occluded vessels combined, the detection sensitivity using any single lead for ST-alarm detection decreases from 84. 7 % to 74. 8 % when the threshold is increased from 1 mm to 1. 5 mm. For <b>alarm</b> <b>detection</b> using any two leads, two contiguous leads, and three leads, the results using a 1 -mm threshold are 79. 7 %, 78. 7 %, and 77. 2 %, respectively. The two-lead performance results can be improved to 87. 1 % for any two leads and to 84. 2 % for any two contiguous leads if a lower threshold of 0. 8 mm is used. For all the possible three-lead combinations, the STindex computed using leads III, V 2, and V 5 shows the highest correlation to {{the sum of the}} absolute ST values from all 12 leads.
