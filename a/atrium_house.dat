50|$|The {{homes of}} the early Etruscans (predecessors of the Romans) were simple, even for the wealthy or ruling classes. They were small {{familiar}} huts constructed on the axial plan of a central hall with an open skylight. It is believed that the Temple of Vesta was, in form, copied from these early dwellings because the worship of Vesta began in individual homes. The huts were probably made of mud and wood with thatched roofs and a centre opening for the hearth's smoke to escape. This {{could have been the}} beginnings of the atrium, which was common in later homes. As Rome became more and more prosperous from trade and conquest, the {{homes of the}} wealthy increased in both size and luxury emulating both the Etruscan <b>atrium</b> <b>house</b> and Hellenistic peristyle house.|$|E
50|$|The {{municipality}} of Medard has yielded {{a wealth of}} archaeological ﬁnds from prehistoric and Roman times. The Marialskopf in the southeast was in {{the time when the}} area was settled by the Celts ringed by walls and palisades, a refuge castle. The remnants of this settlement within the ringwall can still clearly be seen. In 1973 and 1983, archaeological digs unearthed and secured potsherds from vessels made by the Hunsrück-Eifel Culture. Signiﬁcant was the recovery of a silver coin struck in Pannonia, a quarter-stater with Zeus’s head on the obverse and an image of a rider on the reverse. Splinters and shards of old ceramic vessels are still to be found on those lands today. It is likely that the Celtic settlement remained once the Romans had conquered Gaul. Near Medard’s mediaeval church, foundations from a settlement built in Gallo-Roman times were discovered in 1973. It {{turned out to be a}} villa rustica from the turn of the 4th century AD. In 1979, 1980 and 1984, under Diethelm Malitius’s leadership, some outbuildings were also partly unearthed. The archaeologists also discovered fragments of sculptures, one showing a female ﬁgure, grapevine shoots and a horn of plenty full of fruits. In the Middle Ages, it is likely that many stone reliefs still lay all around in the ground, perhaps explaining the spolia from Roman times that can still be seen in the church walls today, showing such things as grapes and another female ﬁgure. Taken out of the church’s walling were the fragments of a relief that shows Medea on a wain drawn by snakes. Of Medea’s children, whom she killed out of jealousy, only the lower part of a boy’s body can still be seen. The image’s background shows her unfaithful husband, Jason. The relief was supposedly once part of a grave monument. During renovation work on the church, three sandstone blocks from Roman times were discovered near the portal in 1988, of which one was originally used as an ossuary (repository for bone ash). One side of this stone bears a well-preserved inscription that reads “(for Dis Manibus) … us Ammosus et Amandia Mandina Conjux Regulo ﬁlio suorum et suo vivi fecerunt”, or in English, “…us Ammosus and his wife Amandia Mandina set grave monument to their son Regulus and themselves to their lifetime.” The digs at the Roman settlement site resumed very extensively in 1995 and 1996 under Wolfgang Heinzelmann’s leadership on assignment from the Alt-Medard (“Old Medard”) Promotional Association and the State Ofﬁce for Monument Care. This work fully brought to light the former Roman settlement’s main house, the <b>atrium</b> <b>house,</b> together with other structures built up around it and the villa’s girding wall. It was apparently a great, certainly two-ﬂoor building with corner risalti at the front, of which one could be heated by a hypocaust facility. The house’s footprint measured 30 m in length and 20 m in breadth. The archaeologists found a column fragment, remnants of ﬂooring and plastering in Pompeian red. A bathing facility was only partially unearthed, but a drainage ditch was fully dug up, revealing a further series of single ﬁnds. All together, three different building periods were identiﬁed. It is presumed that this great villa rustica with its many outbuildings covered an area of some 3 ha. It may therefore be that this Roman estate unearthed on Medard’s outskirts is by far the biggest that has ever come to light in the whole Western Palatinate. To preserve them, the digs have once more been ﬁlled with earth.|$|E

40|$|In Classical Archaeology studies, Latin word villa {{has been}} {{generally}} meant to indicate an architectural model for rural and/or extra-urban private estates, developed since late republican era (end of 3 rd / beginning of 2 nd century BC) in Roman Italy and connected with rural exploitation based on slave labour. In particular, Roman Villa became a standard type of building composed by the axial nucleus of an <b>atrium</b> <b>house</b> (pars urbana) joint to a distinct part e devoted to food production (oil and wine presses, store rooms and so forth), animal breeding (such as stables) and slave compounds (pars rustica). Such an idea {{has been challenged}} by a recent discovery {{in the northern part}} of Roman Suburbium: the so called Auditorium Villa, which represents one of the most interesting and discussed archaeological discovery in Rome during the last few years. The paper will focus on earlier phases of this building (mid 6 th to the end of 4 th century BC) when a small archaic farm (300 m 2) has been destroyed and replaced around 500 BC by a much more substantial building (600 m 2). Size, distribution and possible functions of rooms and/or larger parts of the building allow us to identify, even at such an early stage in roman architecture, different spaces reserved to different social groups/entities: a residential quarter (pars urbana), a productive area (pars rustica) and possible slave compoun...|$|E
40|$|The {{idea behind}} the <b>Atrium</b> <b>House</b> Solar Revitalization project, may be briefly {{presented}} as: energy conserving, low rise, high density, related- to- the-sky residences. The proposed system consists of a reticulate grid - each case representing a house - with accesses at the bottom, and terraces and gardens at the upper part. The atriums are covered with new glazing products thus allowing full and comfortable use of these spaces all around the year. One of these new products, the Louvered Glass, has been specially designed to fulfill the thermal and visual requirements of these projects. Its characteristics, {{as well as other}} proposed glazing sandwiches, are analyzed in Chapter Four. Traditional facades are not provided, all the dwellings having their peripheral walls in common to make them behave thermally like berm insulated buildings, thus reducing the heat losses to the outside. A range of different sizes (affecting density) and relations to the atrium (life-style and climatic considerations) are studied under different aspects: 1. Design variations on the Atrium theme, from the traditional position to the "atrium in atrium", and finally to new forms of interior organization; 2. Glass roof forms and glazing materials, including existing, experimental and proposed products; 3. Interior thermal and visual comfort. The study includes plans, model pictures, data tables and graphs, and computer thermal calculations for ten Atrium Houses. This project proposes new forms of urban housing combining the advantages of the high density construction with those of individual residences. The research results demonstrate the feasibility of this housing formula from comfort and architectural standpoints. by Dan Roland Malamuceanu. Thesis (M. S.)

40|$|AbstractThe article {{discusses}} the issue {{connected with the}} formation and functioning of the <b>atrium</b> <b>housing</b> in the modern urban tissue.

Residential atrium estates were once {{the embodiment of the}} modern city in social terms and the guarantor of {{the quality of life of}} residents. But now this type of construction is unpopular and is very rarely found in developing Polish cities. Although this type of housing could fill the gap between the numerous multi-family buildings of major cities and single-family housing, presently, it is treated only as an experiment in shaping the residential environment. The original buildings undergo expansions and visual changes, while new projects are not created. What are the reasons for such a situation? Are they social, historical, economic or perhaps others? Is the demand for flexible and diverse architecture subjected to constant changes resulting from the times it concerns...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to reduce the energy cost of the low-income {{households}} in the hot and humid climates of the U. S. and thereby to help them afford comfortable homes. In this perspective, a new HVAC energy saving strategy, i. e. ?partial conditioning? was modeled and its potential to reduce the HVAC energy consumption of the low income homes in Texas was quantified. The ?partial conditioning? strategy combined three primary ideas: 1) using historic courtyard building schemes to provide a buffer zone between conditioned spaces, 2) zoning and applying occupancy based heating/cooling in each zone, and 3) reusing the conditioned air returning from the occupied zones in the unoccupied zones before it is returned to the system. The study was conducted in four steps: 1) data collection, 2) baseline design and modeling, 3) partial conditioning design and modeling, and 4) analyses and recommendations. First, a site visit was held to the Habitat for Humanity office in Bryan, Texas to collect data on the characteristics of the Habitat for Humanity houses built in Bryan. Second, a base-line Habitat for Humanity house was designed and modeled based on this information along with multiple other resources including International Energy Conservation Code 2012 and Building America benchmark definitions. A detailed comparison was made between the commonly used energy modeling tools (DOE- 2. 1 e, EnergyPlus and TRNSYS) and a modeling method was developed for the estimation of the baseline energy consumption. Third, the ?partial conditioning? strategy was introduced into the baseline energy model to simulate a partially conditioned <b>atrium</b> <b>house.</b> As the occupied zone and the direction of the airflow changed throughout the year in the partially conditioned house, this step required an innovative air loop model with interzonal air ducts that allowed for sched- uled bi-directional airflow. This air loop was modeled with the AirflowNetwork model of EnergyPlus. Fourth, the modeling results were analyzed and discussed to determine the performance of the partial conditioning strategy in a hot and humid climate. It was found that partial conditioning strategy can provide substantial (37 %- 46 %) reduction in the overall HVAC energy consumption of small residences (? 1, 000 ft 2) in hot and humid climates while performing better in meeting the temperature set points in each room. It was also found that the quantity of the energy savings that can be obtained with the partial conditioning strategy depends significantly on the ground coupling condition of the house for low rise residential buildings...|$|E
