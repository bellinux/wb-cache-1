It seems clear he was <b>a</b> <b>good-looking,</b> engaging young man, whose easy humour and kindness towards the sisters made a considerable impression. It is such a character that she portrays in Edward Weston, and that her heroine Agnes Grey finds deeply appealing.|$|E

Ronald Welch in Knight Crusader and Jean Plaidy (Eleanor Hibbert) in The Heart of the Lion both depict him sympathetically as likable and chivalrous. Both give the misleading impression that he was younger than King Richard: he was at least several years older.|$|E

Claire Heger was the second wife of Constantin, and {{it was she who}} founded and directed the school while Constantin had the responsibility for the higher French classes. According to Miss Wheelwright, a former pupil, he had the intellect of a genius. He was passionate about his auditorium, demanding many lectures, perspectives, and structured analyses.

500|$|In a {{retrospective}} {{review of the}} game in 2008, Destructoid's Conrad Zimmerman criticized Wizards & WarriorsIII for many issues. While he initially praised the game for its depth, he criticized the game by comparing Kuros to the previous games in the series, saying that he is [...] "still <b>a</b> <b>good-looking</b> knight with a useless sword which he holds as if it were his manhood when jumping" [...] and adding that he [...] "is {{still one of the most}} inept fighters in videogame history". He also criticizes the game for its lack of action and fighting, saying that it is [...] "more of a platforming game with the occasional boss fight". Other criticisms include slow and unresponsive controls and hard-to-defeat bosses. Overall, he says that Wizards & WarriorsIII [...] "isn't a bad game, just one that has some great ideas hampered by serious flaws".|$|E
500|$|On March 2, 2015, it was {{announced}} that Miceli would be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2015, under her Alundra Blayze moniker.

[...] During her speech, in response to constant questions about her dumping the WWF Women's Championship belt in the trash on Monday Nitro, her inductor, Natalya, wheeled a trash can onstage. Miceli (calling herself both Madusa and Alundra Blayze) withdrew the belt, which she stressed was <b>a</b> <b>good-looking</b> [...] "women's wrestling belt", and said it was finally [...] "back home where it belongs" [...] after 20 years. She held the belt on her shoulder, and referred to herself as the reigning WWF Women's Champion.|$|E
500|$|Julia {{started seeing}} Dykins {{a year after}} Victoria's birth (although they {{had known each other}} before) when she was working in the café near Lennon's primary school; Mosspits. Dykins was <b>a</b> <b>good-looking,</b> well-dressed man who worked at the Adelphi Hotel in Liverpool as a wine steward. She later moved into a small flat in Gateacre with Dykins. He enjoyed luxuries, and had access to rationed goods like alcohol, chocolate, silk {{stockings}} and cigarettes, which was what initially attracted her. The Stanley sisters called him [...] "Spiv", because of his pencil-thin moustache, margarine-coated hair, and pork-pie hat, and the young Lennon called him [...] "Twitchy" [...] because of a physical tic/nervous cough. Julia's family and friends remembered that he also had a fiery temperament, which could result in his being violent when drunk. Lennon remembered seeing his mother during a visit to Mimi's, when her face was bleeding after being hit by Dykins.|$|E

500|$|Friends of {{the couple}} were {{surprised}} by the marriage and dubious of its wisdom. Burckhard called Mahler [...] "that rachitic degenerate Jew," [...] unworthy for such <b>a</b> <b>good-looking</b> girl of good family. On the other hand, Mahler's family considered Alma to be flirtatious, unreliable, and too fond of seeing young men fall for her charms. Mahler was by nature moody and authoritarian—Natalie Bauer-Lechner, his earlier partner, said that living with him was [...] "like being on a boat that is ceaselessly rocked to and fro by the waves." [...] Alma soon became resentful because of Mahler's insistence that there could only be one composer {{in the family and}} that she had given up her music studies to accommodate him. She wrote in her diary: [...] "How hard it is to be so mercilessly deprived of... things closest to one's heart." [...] Mahler's requirement that their married life be organized around his creative activities imposed strains, and precipitated rebellion on Alma's part; the marriage was nevertheless marked at times by expressions of considerable passion, particularly from Mahler.|$|E
500|$|John Lennon was Julia's {{first child}} by Alfred Lennon, {{although}} she later {{had a daughter}} called Victoria (renamed Ingrid) after {{an affair with a}} Welsh soldier while Alfred was at sea. Julia was forced to give up the child for adoption after intense pressure from her father and her sisters. Although they had known each other previously, Julia started dating Dykins while working in a café near Mosspits, which was Lennon's primary school. Dykins was said to be <b>a</b> <b>good-looking,</b> well-dressed man who was several years older than Julia and worked at the Adelphi Hotel in Liverpool as a wine steward. Julia later moved into a small flat in Gateacre with Dykins, who had access to rationed goods like alcohol, chocolate, silks and cigarettes. The Stanley sisters called Dykins a [...] "spiv", because of his pencil-thin moustache, margarine-coated hair, and pork-pie hat, but the young Lennon called him [...] "Twitchy" [...] because of a physical tic and nervous cough Dykins had. Although Julia never divorced Alfred Lennon, she was the common-law wife of Dykins, although Paul McCartney admitted to being sarcastic to Lennon about his mother living in sin while Julia was still married.|$|E
500|$|However, some game editors {{have criticized}} Sephiroth's character. For example, IGN's Smith {{has stated that}} [...] "Sephiroth was {{certainly}} <b>a</b> <b>good-looking</b> fellow, but his motivations were about as clear as mud." [...] When comparing Sephiroth with the Final Fantasy VI villain, Kefka Palazzo, GamesRadar commented that he [...] "seems as interesting as a dead accountant painted brown." [...] 1UP.com took a humorous approach to Sephiroth's several appearances after apparent deaths and in other games, ranking him third in their [...] "They Is Risen" [...] feature, which covered the ten most notorious video game resurrections. The publication noted that if the character continued to be used, Square Enix would eventually [...] "run out of ways to remix One-Winged Angel." [...] GameSpy editor Ryan Scott called Sephiroth the [...] "King of Overrated Characters" [...] during GameSpy's villain feature for Dissidia Final Fantasy, arguing that gamers were impressed by him only because of his design and by how he killed Aerith during Final Fantasy VII. On the other hand, AnimeFringe called him [...] "the most notorious villain in the entire Final Fantasy series" [...] and [...] "quintessential bishōnen {{in the eyes of}} many fans -- male and female," [...] comparing him with Kefka and praising his complexity.|$|E

500|$|Most {{reviews of}} [...] "Secret Truths" [...] were positive, {{particularly}} praising {{its treatment of}} social issues. Maureen Ryan wrote for the Chicago Tribune that [...] "The lack of either cutesyness or condescension shown by this program is promising." [...] She also commended that the pilot [...] "doesn't shy away" [...] from issues pertaining to race, religion and sexuality. Kate Authur of The New York Times compared the pilot positively to other series, writing, [...] "If you took the plot of Beverly Hills, 90210 (<b>a</b> <b>good-looking</b> Midwestern family moves to Los Angeles), combined it with the identity issues of Degrassi (race, sexuality and class clash {{in a high school}} setting) and added a splash of One Tree Hills basketball backdrop, you would get South of Nowhere... That's meant to be a compliment." [...] Alessandra Stanley, another critic for The New York Times, mentioned [...] "Secret Truths" [...] in a feature about racial issues on television. She felt that the pilot distinguished itself from other teen shows by including a subplot about race; however, she still found it to be [...] "constrained and politically correct". Varietys Brian Lowry gave the episode a lukewarm review, comparing it to other teen dramas. He wrote that [...] "the web of relationships doesn't feel particularly fresh, mirroring the recent spate of nighttime teen serials", but he felt the pilot was an [...] "edgier treatment", noting that it [...] "isn't screwing around" [...] by addressing topics including abortion, drugs, homosexuality and racism. Karman Kregloe of AfterEllen.com, a website focused on the portrayal of lesbians in the media, thought that the episode was [...] "well-written, and the storyline for each of the lead characters is compelling". She praised the show greatly for its authentic portrayal of teenagers' questioning of their sexuality and the [...] "big step" [...] taken towards promoting tolerance.|$|E
