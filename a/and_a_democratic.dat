25|$|Ilia's main {{political}} and social goals were based on Georgian patriotism. He radically advocated {{the revival of the}} use of the Georgian language, the cultivation of Georgian literature, the revival of autocephalous status for the Georgian national church, and, finally, the revival of Georgian statehood, which had ended when the country became part of the Russian Empire. As the number of supporters for his ideas grew, so did opposition among the leading Social Democrats like the Menshevik Noe Zhordania; their main aims were focused on battling the Tsarist autocracy <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>democratic</b> transformation of the Russian empire. This did not include the revival of a Georgian state or of a Georgian self-identity. Ilia was viewed as bourgeois and as an old aristocrat who failed to realize the importance of the revolutionary tide.|$|E
25|$|Roosevelt held little {{passion for}} the {{practice}} of law, and confided to friends that he planned to eventually enter politics. Prior to the 1910 elections, the local Democratic Party recruited Roosevelt to run for a seat in the New York State Assembly. Roosevelt's campaign for the state assembly ended after the Democratic incumbent, Lewis Stuyvesant Chanler, chose to seek re-election. Rather than putting his political hopes on hold, Roosevelt ran for a seat in the state senate. The senate district, located in Dutchess County, Columbia County, and Putnam County, was strongly Republican, having elected one Democrat since 1856. The local party chose Roosevelt because his Republican cousin Theodore was still one of the country's most prominent politicians, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>Democratic</b> Roosevelt was good publicity; the candidate could also pay for his own campaign. Roosevelt, who acted as his own campaign manager, traveled throughout the district via automobile {{at a time when many}} could not afford cars. Due to his aggressive and effective campaign, the Roosevelt name's influence in the Hudson Valley, and the Democratic landslide that year, Roosevelt won the election, surprising almost everyone. Though legislative sessions rarely lasted more than ten weeks, Roosevelt treated his new position as a full-time career.|$|E

Italy, as an Entente ally, had made some post-war territorial gains; however, Italian nationalists were angered that the promises made by Britain and France to secure Italian entrance into the war were not fulfilled in the peace settlement. From 1922 to 1925, the Fascist movement led by Benito Mussolini seized power in Italy with a nationalist, totalitarian, and class collaborationist agenda that abolished representative democracy, repressed socialist, left-wing and liberal forces, and pursued an aggressive expansionist foreign policy aimed at making Italy a world power, promising the creation of a [...] "New Roman Empire".|$|E

500|$|The {{first major}} effort to give women {{the right to}} vote in all non-federal {{elections}} attempted to amend the state constitution. It passed by both houses of the state legislature in 1881; however, the bill failed to pass in the next legislative session in 1883 as state law required. Temperance efforts fared little better. In 1881 the Indiana chapter of the WCTU, along with organizations participating in the Indiana Grand Council of Temperance, successfully lobbied the Indiana General Assembly to pass an amendment to the state constitution to prohibit the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages in the state, but the Indiana Liquor League <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>Democratic</b> majority in the state legislature killed the bill in the legislative session in 1883. Following these legislative defeats women's suffrage and prohibition became sensitive issues in local politics as the Democrats rallied the opposition. In German strongholds such as Fort Wayne, opposition to prohibition and women's suffrage was strong until World War I. As one historian notes, [...] "within German working-class family traditions, women in particular were sharply defined in terms of family responsibilities. Suffrage and women's rights ran counter to deep social and religious traditions that placed women in a subservient relationship to men." [...] Renewed interest in women's suffrage did not occur {{until the end of the}} century, while prohibition crusaders continued to press for legislative action.|$|E
