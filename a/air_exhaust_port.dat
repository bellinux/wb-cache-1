40|$|Graduation date: 1966 The {{importance}} of automobile exhaust {{as a source}} of atmospheric pollutants has been recognized for several years. With the control of stationary sources in geographic areas such as Los Angeles County, the automobile has become the major uncontrolled source of air pollution. The three major pollutants emitted by automobiles are unburned hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and oxides of nitrogen. Seventy percent of the emissions are from the exhaust. Maximum emission standards of 275 ppm hydrocarbons as n-hexane and 1. 5 mole percent carbon monoxide in automotive exhaust have been enacted in California. Control measures for the oxides of nitrogen may possibly be effective for 1970 model vehicles. Exhaust control devices for hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions submitted to the California Motor Vehicle Pollution Control Board for approval have included catalytic converters, direct-flame afterburners, engine modification systems, and secondary air injection at the <b>exhaust</b> <b>port</b> systems. Three of the automobile manufactures may use the fourth system which involves introduction of secondary air into the engine <b>exhaust</b> <b>ports</b> to promote flameless oxidation of hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide and water. Since this control system introduces air to the high temperature exhaust gases at the <b>exhaust</b> <b>port,</b> the question arises whether oxides of nitrogen might be formed. This would be detrimental from the outlook that oxides of nitrogen must be controlled. The purpose of this work was to determine the effects on the emissions of oxides of nitrogen from a gasoline engine by the installation and operation of an <b>exhaust</b> <b>port</b> secondary <b>air</b> injection system. The engine under test, given to Oregon State University by the Ford Motor Company, was installed in a vehicle and operated on a chassis dynamometer. Measurements of oxides of nitrogen emissions with and without the air injection system in operation were made both during steady state and transient conditions. For transient measurements, the vehicle was operated on the California seven-mode test cycle. Oxides of nitrogen samples were taken by a progressive grab sampling technique and analyzed with an absorption spectrophotom eter built at Oregon State University. Further measurements included unburned hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide analyses with commercial non-dispersive infrared analyzers and total carbon measurement with a commercial hydrogen flame ionization analyzer. These analyses were made for the purpose of determining air dilution factors and correlating data with other work being done in the field. The results of the investigation are summarized as follows: 1) The addition of secondary <b>air</b> at the <b>exhaust</b> <b>ports</b> in creased the oxides of nitrogen emissions during acceleration for both rich and lean mixture operation. As high as 40 percent in crease occurred during operation with the rich carburetor. Appreciable increase also occurred during high speed steady state cruise conditions with the rich carburetor. Weighted average concentrations of NO[subscript x] for operation on the California cycle were not determined. 2) The grab sampling and spectrophotometric analysis methods for the oxides of nitrogen worked well during the testing. However, the time required to take a grab sample, three seconds, was too long to obtain instantaneous analysis. Sampling probes should be located closer to the engine to avoid mixing of exhaust from separate modes in the exhaust pipe prior to analysis. 3) Temperatures in the exhaust manifold were not markedly changed by the injection of secondary <b>air</b> into the <b>exhaust</b> <b>ports.</b> However, temperatures were 50 to 100 ° F higher {{at the end of the}} tailpipe due to increased exhaust mass flow rate. 4) The vehicle with the air system installed met California standards for operation with the rich carburetor, but emitted a higher concentration of unburned hydrocarbons than the standard during operation with the lean carburetor...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} made to reduce exhaust {{emissions}} and fuel consumption of a general aviation aircraft piston engine by applying known technology. Fourteen promising concepts such as stratified charge combustion chambers, cooling cylinder head improvements, and ignition system changes were evaluated for emission reduction and cost effectiveness. A combination of three concepts, improved fuel injection system, improved cylinder head with <b>exhaust</b> <b>port</b> liners and <b>exhaust</b> <b>air</b> injection was projected as the most cost effective and safe means of meeting the EPA standards for CO, HC and NO. The fuel economy improvement of 4. 6 % over a typical single engine aircraft flight profile does not though justify the added cost of the three concepts, and significant reductions in fuel consumption must {{be applied to the}} cruise mode where most of the fuel is used. The use of <b>exhaust</b> <b>air</b> injection in combination with <b>exhaust</b> <b>port</b> liners reduces <b>exhaust</b> valve stem temperatures which can result in longer valve guide life. The use of <b>exhaust</b> <b>port</b> liners alone can reduce engine cooling air requirements by 11 % which is the equivalent of a 1. 5 % increase in propulsive power.

2500|$|Mazda's RX-8 {{car with}} the Renesis engine met California State fuel economy requirements, {{including}} California's low emissions vehicle (LEV) standards. This was achieved {{by a number of}} innovations. The <b>exhaust</b> <b>ports,</b> which in earlier Mazda rotaries were located in the rotor housings, were moved to the sides of the combustion chamber. This solved the problem of the earlier ash buildup in the engine, and thermal distortion problems of side intake and <b>exhaust</b> <b>ports.</b> A scraper seal was added in the rotor sides, and some ceramic parts were used in the engine. This approach allowed Mazda to eliminate overlap between intake and <b>exhaust</b> <b>port</b> openings, while simultaneously increasing the <b>exhaust</b> <b>port</b> area. The side port trapped the unburned fuel in the chamber, decreased the oil consumption, and improved the combustion stability in the low-speed and light load range. The HC emissions from the side <b>exhaust</b> <b>port</b> Wankel engine are 35–50% less than those from the peripheral <b>exhaust</b> <b>port</b> Wankel engine, because of near zero intake and <b>exhaust</b> <b>port</b> opening overlap. Peripheral ported rotary engines have a better mean effective pressure, especially at high rpm and with a rectangular shaped intake port. [...] However, the RX-8 was not improved to meet Euro 5 emission regulations and was discontinued in 2012.|$|R

50|$|The major {{limitation}} {{for performance}} on the 235 was {{the design of the}} intake and <b>exhaust</b> <b>ports.</b> Unlike more modern straight sixes, the 235 had siamesed ports, with three intake <b>ports</b> and four <b>exhaust</b> <b>ports.</b> This meant the adjacent cylinders 2 and 3 and cylinders 4 and 5 shared a single <b>exhaust</b> <b>port</b> between them, whereas cylinders 1 and 6 had their own <b>exhaust</b> <b>ports.</b> Secondly, since there were only three intake ports, each port was divided between a pair of adjacent cylinders: 1 and 2, 3 and 4, and 5 and 6 shared an intake port. The design of the intake manifold also favored the middle port (and therefore the middle two cylinders). This ultimately caused the four end cylinders to receive less mixture, resulting in an unequal and unbalanced work load between the six cylinders.|$|R

5000|$|These {{conflicting}} {{requirements are}} reconciled by constructing the exhaust pipe with diverging and converging conical sections to create pressure wave reflections which travel {{back up the}} pipe and are presented at the <b>exhaust</b> <b>port.</b> The <b>exhaust</b> <b>port</b> opens while there is still significant pressure in the cylinder, which drives the initial outflow of exhaust. As the pressure wave from the pulse of exhaust gas travels down the pipe, it encounters a diverging conical section; this causes a wave of negative pressure to be reflected back up the pipe, which arrives at the <b>exhaust</b> <b>port</b> {{towards the end of}} the exhaust phase, when the cylinder pressure has fallen to a low level, and helps to draw the remaining exhaust gas out of the cylinder. Further along the exhaust pipe, the exhaust pressure wave encounters a converging conical section, and this reflects a positive pressure wave back up the pipe. This wave is timed to arrive at the <b>exhaust</b> <b>port</b> after scavenging is completed, thereby [...] "plugging" [...] the <b>exhaust</b> <b>port</b> to prevent spillage of fresh charge, and indeed may also push back into the cylinder any charge which has already spilled.|$|R

5000|$|Uniflow engines {{potentially}} allow greater {{expansion in}} a single cylinder without the relatively cool exhaust steam flowing across the hot end of the working cylinder and steam ports of a conventional [...] "counterflow" [...] steam engine during the exhaust stroke. This condition allows higher thermal efficiency.

2500|$|The {{shape of}} the Wankel {{combustion}} chamber is more resistant to preignition operating on lower-octane rating gasoline than a comparable piston engine. The combustion chamber shape may also lead to relatively incomplete combustion of the air-fuel charge. This {{would result in a}} larger amount of unburned hydrocarbons released into the exhaust. The exhaust is, however, relatively low in NOx emissions, because combustion temperatures are lower than in other engines, and also because of some inherent exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) in early engines. Sir Harry Ricardo showed in the 1920s that for every 1% increase in the proportion of exhaust gas in the admission mix, there is a 7°C reduction in flame temperature. This allowed Mazda to meet the United States Clean Air Act of 1970 in 1973, with a simple and inexpensive [...] "thermal reactor", which was an enlarged chamber in the exhaust manifold. By decreasing the air-fuel ratio, unburned hydrocarbons (HC) in the exhaust would support combustion in the thermal reactor. Piston-engine cars required expensive catalytic converters to deal with both unburned hydrocarbons and NOx emissions. This inexpensive solution increased fuel consumption, which was already a weak point for the Wankel engine, and the oil crisis of 1973 raised the price of gasoline. Toyota discovered that injection of <b>air</b> into the <b>exhaust</b> <b>port</b> zone improved fuel economy and reduced emissions. The best results were obtained with holes in the side plates; doing it in the exhaust duct had no noticeable influence. The use of a three-stage catalysts, with air supplied in the middle, as for two-stroke piston engines, also proved beneficial.|$|R
