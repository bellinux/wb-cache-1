Additionally, branched <b>arabinans</b> (Br-Arabinans) or debranched <b>arabinans</b> (Deb-Arabinans; isolated from sugar beet) and galactans (isolated from potato) were shown bind to cellulose microfibrils. The adsorption of Br-Arabinan and galactan was lower than that of Deb-Arabinan. The maximum adsorption affinity of Deb-Arabinan to cellulose was comparable to that of xyloglucan. The study of sugar beet and potato alkali-treated cell walls supports the hypothesis of pectin-cellulose interaction. Natural composites enriched in <b>arabinans</b> or galactans and cellulose were recovered.

40|$|Treatment {{of either}} Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} or M. smegmatis with ethambutol results both in inhibition of <b>arabinan</b> synthesis and in copious loss of previously formed <b>arabinan</b> from the cell wall. The loss of <b>arabinan</b> {{has been shown}} to be due to the action of an endogenous arabinase. To better understand this phenomenon, a quantitative assay for endogenous arabinase was developed. Using the assay it was determined that various subcellular fractions of M. smegmatis showed significant amounts of endogenous arabinase activity. Surprisingly, treatment with ethambutol yielded only minor changes in the amounts of endogenous arabinase activities. Endogenous arabinase was present in the cell wall, and consistently, incubation of the M. smegmatis cell wall in only buffer resulted in the release of <b>arabinan,</b> mimicking the effect of ethambutol on whole cells.

In addition, as <b>arabinan</b> was one of the major components in plant cell wall, endo-arabinanase used in juice industry can also improve the yield of juice because they can promote the degradation of the pectin in the fruit and vegetable [9]. Endo-arabinanases from several microorganisms have been characterized.

To test this hypothesis, we investigated possible impacts of the laurina mutation on the cell wall composition of seeds over a time course, and more precisely on polysaccharides. The identification of cell wall polysaccharides (CWP) was deduced from permethylation analysis, whereas cell wall monosaccharide (CWM) composition was estimated using trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and H 2 SO 4. The observation of CWM over time allowed defining three phases. The phi 1 phase, from the 8 th to 14 th week after flowering (WAF), was characterized by the predominance of arabinogalactans, arabinoxylans and <b>arabinans.</b> The phi 2 phase, from the 14 th to 20 th WAF, was mainly characterized by the increased importance of highly branched galactomannans at the expense of arabinoxylans. Lastly, galactomannans constituted the main CWP present in the third phase (from the 20 th to the 32 nd WAF), associated with arabinogalactans and <b>arabinans.</b> Variations in CWP composition were connected to fruit and seed development. The end of the phi 1 phase coincides {{with the end of the}} fruit growth, i. e., with the end of the endosperm development. During the phi 2 phase, endosperm becomes milky and then hard due to the galactomannan deposition. Moreover, the phi 3 phase corresponded to the fruit maturation stage in which CWM composition did not change over time. Galactomannans were less substituted and constitute the main seed CWP. Lastly, the evidence of laurina mutation impact on cell wall polysaccharides of seeds was only observed during the fruit growth period.

Further studies of the effect of ethambutol on cell wall biosynthesis revealed that the synthesis of galactan in the cell wall core is strongly inhibited by the drug. In addition, ethambutol treatment resulted in the cleavage of arabinosyl residues present in the mycobacterial cell wall; more than 50 % of the <b>arabinan</b> in the cell wall core was removed from the wall 1 h after addition of the drug to growing mycobacterial cultures. In contrast, galactan was not released from the cell wall during ethambutol treatment. The natural function of the arabinosyl-releasing enzyme remains unknown, but its action in combination with inhibition of synthesis during ethambutol treatment results in severe disruption of the mycobacterial cell wall. Accordingly, ethambutol-induced damage to the cell wall provides a ready molecular explanation for the known synergetic effects of ethambutol with other chemotherapeutic agents.

The <b>arabinan</b> component is biosynthesized by a family of arabinofuranosyltransferases (araTs) using the substrate decaprenolphosphoarabinose (DPA) as the donor of arabinose. This project targets the biosynthesis of <b>arabinan</b> by synthesizing analogues of DPA as potential inhibitors of araTs. A sulfamide moiety was chosen as an isosteric replacement of the phosphate group of DPA. To mimic the polyprenyl chain of DPA, a series of alkyl chains of varying length and a triethylene glycol (TEG) derived chain were used...|$|E
40|$|Aims: To {{determine}} the fermentation profiles by human gut bacteria of arabino-oligosaccharides of varying degree of polymerization. Materials and Methods: Sugar beet <b>arabinan</b> was hydrolyzed with a commercial pectinase and eight fractions, of varying molecular weight, were isolated by gel-filtration chromatography. Hydrolysis fractions, arabinose, <b>arabinan</b> and fructo-oligosaccharides were fermented anaerobically by gut bacteria. Total bacteria, bifidobacteria, bacteroides, lactobacilli and the Clostridium perfringens/histolyticum sub. grp. were enumerated using fluorescent in situ hybridization. Results: Bifidobacteria were stimulated to different extents depending on molecular weight, i. e. maximum increase in bifidobacteria after 48 h was {{seen on the}} lower molecular weight fractions. Lactobacilli fluctuated depending on the initial inoculum levels. Bacteroides numbers varied according to fraction; <b>arabinan,</b> arabinose and higher oligosaccharides (degree of polymerization, dp > 8) resulted in significant increases at 24 h. Only carbohydrate mixtures with dp of 1 - 2 resulted in significant increases at 48 h (log 8. 77 +/- 0. 23). Clostridia decreased on all substrates. Conclusions: Arabino-oligosaccharides {{can be considered as}} potential prebiotics. Significance and Impact of the Study: <b>Arabinan</b> is widely available as it is a component of sugar beet pulp, a co-product from the sugar beet industry. Generation of prebiotic functionality from <b>arabinan</b> would represent significant added value to a renewable resource...|$|E
50|$|While α-galactose {{as a part}} of {{glycoprotein}} glycans from vertebrates {{other than}} higher apes was {{known for a long time}} as being a prominent xeno-antigen, its implication in allergy only began to materialize when complications during treatment with a recombinant monoclonal antibody (Erbitux) were attributed to IgE directed against α-Gal containing N-glycans on this antibody. The incidencies of anaphylaxis due to Erbitux were confined to a certain area in the eastern United States, which raised speculations about the involvement of a particular type of tick endemic in this area. However, IgE antibodies against the α-Gal epitope should be taken into account in the diagnosis of milk and meat allergy. It is currently largely unexplored whether this type of CCD is generally also clinically irrelevant such as the plant/insect CCDs. The very localized case of Erbitux complications points at a possible if rare clinical significance of α-Gal.Yet other potentially immunogenic carbohydrates with widespread occurrence such as N-Glycolylneuraminic acid, which does not occur in humans, or plant O-glycans (arabinogalactans and <b>arabinans)</b> may be mentioned but have so far not qualified as either IgE or as cross-reactive determinants.|$|R
40|$|Two {{kinds of}} L-arabinans have been {{isolated}} from a broth of Streptomyces fradiae 3739 strain. Both of these <b>arabinans,</b> named P-l and P- 2, possess potential anti-car-rageenin abscess activity. Chromatographic differences on TEAE-cellulose between P-l and P- 2 {{can be attributed}} to differences in the contents of D-galacturonic acid in these polysaccharides. From the results of various experiments, it is concluded that these L-arabinans have almost linear structures made up of 1 —> 5 linked a-L-arabinofuranose units. D-Galacturonic acid was found to be linked to L-arabinose by an a-glycosidic linkage. The molecular weights of P-l and P- 2 were determined to be 9, 800 and 4, 700, respectively, by ultracentrifugal analyses. Periodate oxidation of these polysaccharides resulted in loss of biological activity. During studies on biologically active compo-nents produced by bacteria, we found that Streptomyces fradiae 3739 strain produces cer-tain substances having potential anti-car-rageenin abscess activity (/). We charac-terized these substances as polysaccharides, and were able to purify them by ion exchange cellulose chromatography. The fractions which were eluted by 0. 05 M and 0. 08 M sodium chlo-ride on TEAE-cellulose retained remarkable biological activity. These fractions, termed P-l and P- 2, respectively, were finally purified on TEAE-cellulose by continuous NaCl gradient elution. They were both composed of ove...|$|R
40|$|Insect galls may be study {{models to}} test the {{distribution}} of pectins and arabinogalactan-proteins (AGPs) and their related functions during plant cell cycles. These molecules are herein histochemically and immunocitochemically investigated in the kidney-shaped gall induced by Baccharopelma dracunculifoliae (Psyllidae) on leaves of Baccharis dracunculifolia DC. (Asteraceae) on developmental basis. The homogalacturonans (HGAs) (labeled by JIM 5) and the <b>arabinans</b> (labeled by LM 6) were detected either in non-galled leaves or in young galls, and indicated stiffening of epidermal cell walls, which {{is an important step}} for cell redifferentiation. The labeling of HGAs by JIM 7 changed from young to senescent stage, with an increase in the rigidity of cell walls, which is important for the acquaintance of the final gall shape and for the mechanical opening of the gall. The variation on the degree of HGAs during gall development indicated differential PMEs activity during gall development. The epitopes recognized by LM 2 (AGP glycan) and LM 5 (1 – 4 -b-D-galactans) had poor alterations from non-galled leaves towards gall maturation and senescence. Moreover, the dynamics of pectin and AGPs on two comparable mature kidney-shaped galls on B. dracunculifolia and on B. reticularia revealed specific peculiarities. Our results indicate that similar gall morphotypes in cogeneric host species may present distinct cell responses in the subcelular level, and als...|$|R
