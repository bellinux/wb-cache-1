50|$|The <b>andean</b> <b>bear</b> is {{threatened}} due to poaching and habitat loss. Poaching might have several reasons: trophy hunting, pet trade, religious or magical beliefs, natural products trade and conflicts with humans.|$|E
50|$|The {{intensity}} of poaching can create ecological traps for <b>andean</b> <b>bears.</b> That is, if bears {{are attracted to}} areas of high habitat quality that are also high in poaching risk.|$|R

40|$|Many animals display {{seasonal}} {{patterns of}} behaviour and metabolism {{that can be}} also be observed in captivity. During an obesity-control program in <b>Andean</b> <b>bears</b> (Tremarctos ornatus) at Zoo Zurich, a seasonal fluctuation of body mass war observed once ideal body mass had been reached. The focus {{of this study was}} the question if metabolism of a male and three female animals was affected by seasonality according to their seasonal breeding behaviour, using data on pelleted food intake (from computer controlled feeders) and body mass (from regular weighing). The pelleted diet in the feeder boxes was provided additionally to a daily ration containing vegetables, fruits, pellets for environmental enrichment, and fish. This daily ration was adjusted, within prescribed limits, by the animal keepers depending on the previous day's consumption. Formulas developed for dogs were used to estimate the metabolizable energy (ME) content of the diet and maintenance requirement of the bears depending on their individual body mass. Energy requirements for minimum walked distances between the feeders was calculated as well as energy requirement for fat accretion or energy gained from body fat by body mass loss. Body mass showed a seasonal fluctuation with maxima in spring and minima in autumn, in contrast to the pattern typically observed in animals from the temperate zone; in the male, the body mass maximum occurred later than in the females. Feed intake from feeder boxes peaked in autumn, at the beginning of body mass gain in the females. These patterns cannot be explained as seasonal adaptations to climatic changes in the zoo environment, but match the natural breeding season of <b>Andean</b> <b>bears</b> in their natural habitat, suggesting genetically fixed photoperiodic clues. The data indicate that body mass fluctuation in a range considered ideal for the species was mostly based on the additional food whose amount was adjusted - within limits - by the keepers on a daily basis. Such adjustment, without incurring the risk of obesity in bears that are known as voracious eaters, {{is a good example of}} the skill required in animal husbandry...|$|R
5000|$|The Robert R. McCormick Bear Habitat, or [...] "Bear Line", sat {{directly}} next to Regenstein African Journey, and housed many carnivores {{over the}} years in a number of naturalistic exhibits with trees, water falls, rocky grottos and climbing structures for bears and wolves to use. At the north end is the 266,000-gallon polar bear pool and underwater window, one of the largest polar bear habitats in the world. The zoo received two polar bears, brother and sister Lee and Anana, in 2001, but currently only Anana remains, as Lee was sent to the Detroit Zoo to assist in a breeding program. The only other remaining member of the bear line is a single Malayan sun bear. The zoo was also home to two elderly <b>Andean</b> <b>bears,</b> Goliath and Manny that have since been sent to another zoo, as have the spotted hyenas. The exhibit used to house the maned wolf and Mexican gray wolf but both species were removed when the Pritzer Family Children's Zoo opened its own red wolf habitat in 2005.|$|R
50|$|The Spectacled Bear Conservation Society - Peru (SBC) {{is a team}} of {{researchers}} and conservationists working to study and protect the endangered spectacled bear (Tremarctos ornatus), also known as the <b>Andean</b> <b>bear.</b> Spectacled bears are the only surviving species of bear native to South America, and the only surviving member of the subfamily Tremarctinae, the short-faced bears.

50|$|The Salisbury Zoological Park, {{commonly}} referred to as the Salisbury Zoo, is a 12 acre zoo located on the Delmarva Peninsula in the Salisbury, Maryland city park. The Salisbury Zoo chooses to mainly house species native to North, South America, and Australia. Its collection of over 100 animals includes wallabys, American alligators, flamingos, North American river otters, ocelots, Patagonian cavys, red wolves, two-toed sloths, jaguars, llamas, turtles, macaws, rescued raptors and owls, and a spectacled or <b>Andean</b> <b>bear.</b>|$|E
50|$|Conflicts with humans, however, {{appear to}} be {{the most common cause of}} {{poaching}} in large portions of its distribution. Andean Bears are often suspected of attacking cattle and raiding crops, and are killed for retaliation or in order to avoid further damages. It has been argued that attacks to cattle attributed to <b>andean</b> <b>bear</b> are partly due to other predators. Raiding of crops can be frequent in areas with diminishing natural resources and extensive crops in former bear habitat, or when problematic individuals get used to human environments.|$|E
50|$|A verdant {{and species}} rich valley {{in the highest}} reaches of the Andes, Guandera {{represents}} the last of forest type that once carpeted the upper slopes of moister valleys within the tropical Andes from Colombia to Peru.

However, this forest is nearly 2 ½ miles above sea level and evening temperatures hover around freezing. Also stretching above the tree line, Guandera’s protected area includes an expansive and unique páramo - a type of moist, alpine grassland whose bizarre plant forms create an almost otherworldly landscape. A last haven for the <b>Andean</b> spectacled <b>bear,</b> <b>Andean</b> fox, mountain lion, and the grey-breasted mountain-toucan, as well as species found only here - such as an endemic cotinga, it is the last place of its kind.|$|R

Its closest relatives are the extinct Florida spectacled bear, and the giant short-faced bears of the Middle Pleistocene to Late Pleistocene age. Spectacled bears are the only surviving species of bear native to South America, and the only surviving member of the subfamily Tremarctinae. The species is classified as Vulnerable by the IUCN because of habitat loss.|$|E

50|$|In {{terms of}} wildlife, Sajama {{is home to}} a unique set of organisms {{particular}} to the alpine regions of the Andes. Plants and animals must be able to handle high altitudes with less available oxygen, cold nightly temperatures and frosts well into the spring, little shade or protection from the elements, and arid, dry conditions. One example of unique wildlife in the park is the vicuña, a species of camelid related to the llama and the alpaca. These animals are prized because of their soft and warm, but extremely lightweight fur. Historically, only Incan emperors were allowed to wear their wool. Indigenous populations in the area still continue a rich cultural tradition of myths, legends, and rituals involving the vicuña. Once poached to near extinction because their fine, valuable wool, they are now protected in the area and their numbers are rebounding.

5000|$|There are {{a little}} over thirty {{hotspots}} now recorded and used for research. A couple other hotspots include the Caribbean Islands, Himalaya, and Japan. Due to a hotspots great diversity and endemic species, conservation biology and many other sources conduct research in these locations. Research is also needed considering the amount of threatened species in hotspots. Researchers {{have the opportunity to}} preserve many species along with their habitats within hotspots. Some organizations that use hotspots for research are World Conservation Monitoring Centre, Birdlife International, Conservation International, and World Wildlife Fund. Research is also done on human impacts to the hotspots land and species that reside in them. Funding for hotspot conservation has been estimated at $750 million accumulated over the past fifteen years. By focusing research on hotspots, many species can be helped at once. One specific research studies fires impact on vegetation in Northern Ecuador of the Tropical Andes. This location's variety of vegetation includes different forests, land used for agricultural and páramo, or tropical alpine found at 4,500 meters. Páramo, is dominated by grasses but still high in diversity. The article Fire Ecology and Conservation in the High Tropical Andes: Observations from Northern Ecuador, looks at páramo's ability to withstand disturbances such as fire. The fact that humans have lived in this location for 7,000 years, the páramo has been through fires and grazing. The writer believes policies used to implement fire suppression are not probable or beneficiary to the plants species. [...] Policies instead should be written up according specific plant species and impact on natives living there. This is a small example of research in the Tropical Andes that could make a big impact to saving diversity. Further research is also processed on looking into the decrease in avian populations, focusing in hotspots due to its massive diversity. The study focuses in Endemic Bird Areas or EBA in order to understand why they become extinct and possible conservation plans. [...] there was 218 EBA's with over 30 percent bird species threatened. EBA's located in hotspots interfere with many human activities leading to habitat loss in 51 percent EBA's. According to the articles chart, five EBA's with habitat loss are located in the Tropical Andes. By studying the effect of human activities on EBA's that are losing avian populations, plans to help the future of other EBA's is possible. Their results showed if a species has habitat specificity and large in size the chance of extinction increases. Habitat loss will impact those with habitat specificity greatly. Conservation goals need to look into human activities and the bird's habitat specificity {{in order to make a}} positive impact. An example of research on a specific threatened species in the Tropical Andes is the Tremarctos ornatus, or known as <b>Andean</b> (or spectacled) <b>bears.</b> By capturing two male species, radio collars were attached in order to track and study their habits and movement. The two bears portrayed similar patterns compared to many other bear species. These findings contrasted with the belief of spectacled bears being nocturnal and no change in patterns between seasons because only slight change in temperature. The radio collars proved these spectacled bears to be diurnal. The bears were in motion from sunrise to sunset with periods of rest in-between. There was a small change in level of activity between seasons with an increase during the dry season. Due to the technology of radio collars, hypothesis about the rare spectacle bears in the Tropical Andes were tested. By knowing species habitat and lifestyle, we can better understand and help threatened species.|$|R
40|$|The Andean, or spectacled, bear (Tremarctos ornatus) is Latin America’s only bear species. Over {{the past}} several decades, deforestation, forest fragmentation, and {{poaching}} have threatened <b>Andean</b> <b>bear</b> populations; recent estimates suggest that less than 18, 000 bears survive in the wild today, many surviving in patches that may be too small to sustain them in the long-term.
