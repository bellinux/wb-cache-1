5|$|Parallel {{computing}} {{can also}} {{be applied to the}} design of fault-tolerant computer systems, particularly via lockstep systems performing the same operation in parallel. This provides redundancy in case one component should fail, and also allows automatic error detection and error correction if the results differ. These methods can be used to help prevent single event upsets caused by transient errors. Although <b>additional</b> <b>measures</b> may be required in embedded or specialized systems, this method can provide a cost effective approach to achieve n-modular redundancy in commercial off-the-shelf systems.|$|E
5|$|The console {{can monitor}} its {{internal}} temperature and adjust accordingly to prevent overheating; alongside increasing fan speed, <b>additional</b> <b>measures</b> can be taken, including forcing the hardware {{to run in}} a lower power state—a feature that was not present on Xbox 360. Restricting power consumption lowers maximum performance, but the setting would be intended {{as a last resort}} to prevent permanent hardware damage.|$|E
5|$|As {{construction}} {{of schools and}} hiring of teachers continued in Ravalomanana's second term, <b>additional</b> <b>measures</b> were adopted to improve education quality, including a shift to Malagasy as the language of instruction in grades one to five, expansion of primary schools to house grades six and seven for greater access to lower secondary schooling and {{an overhaul of the}} national curriculum, which had been modified piecemeal since independence from France in 1960. In the Constitution of 2007, English was added to Malagasy and French as an official language, in reflection of Ravalomanana's goal to increase Madagascar's participation in the global market.|$|E

5|$|Henry {{maintained}} {{peace with}} Scotland during his reign, {{where he was}} the feudal lord of Alexander II. Henry assumed that he had the right to interfere in Scottish affairs and brought up the issue of his authority with the Scottish kings at key moments, but he lacked the inclination or the resources to do much more. Alexander had occupied parts of northern England during the First Barons' War but had been excommunicated and forced to retreat. Alexander married Henry's sister Joan in 1221, and after he and Henry signed the Treaty of York in 1237, Henry had a secure northern frontier. Henry knighted Alexander III before the young King married Henry's daughter Margaret in 1251 and, despite Alexander's refusal to give homage to Henry for Scotland, the two enjoyed a good relationship. Henry had Alexander and Margaret rescued from Edinburgh Castle when they were imprisoned there by a rebellious Scottish baron in 1255 and took <b>additional</b> <b>measures</b> to manage Alexander's government during the rest of his minority years.|$|E
5|$|The F-22 was {{designed}} to be highly difficult to detect and track by radar. Measures to reduce radar cross-section include airframe shaping such as alignment of edges, fixed-geometry serpentine inlets that prevent line-of-sight of the engine faces from any exterior view, use of radar-absorbent material (RAM), and attention to detail such as hinges and pilot helmets that could provide a radar return. The F-22 was also designed to have decreased radio emissions, infrared signature and acoustic signature as well as reduced visibility to the naked eye. The aircraft's flat thrust-vectoring nozzle reduces infrared emissions to mitigate the threat of infrared homing ("heat seeking") surface-to-air or air-to-air missiles. <b>Additional</b> <b>measures</b> to reduce the infrared signature include special paint and active cooling of leading edges to manage the heat buildup from supersonic flight.|$|E
5|$|Before a {{property}} is {{inscribed on the}} List of World Heritage in Danger, its condition is assessed and a potential programme for corrective measures is developed {{in cooperation with the}} State Party involved. The final decision about inscription is made by the committee. Financial support from the World Heritage Fund may be allocated by the committee for listed properties. The state of conservation is reviewed on a yearly basis, after which the committee may request <b>additional</b> <b>measures,</b> delete the property from the list if the threats have ceased or consider deletion from both the List of World Heritage in Danger and the World Heritage List. Of the two Former UNESCO World Heritage Sites, the Dresden Elbe Valley was delisted after placement on the List of World Heritage in Danger while the Arabian Oryx Sanctuary was directly delisted. As of 2017, there are 54 entries (17 natural, 37 cultural) on the List of World Heritage in Danger. Some sites have been designated as World Heritage Sites and World Heritage in Danger in the same year, such as the Church of the Nativity, traditionally considered to be the birthplace of Jesus. Arranged by the UNESCO regions 22 of the listed sites are located in the Arab States (of which 7 are located in Syria and 5 in Libya), 15 in Africa (of which 5 are in the Democratic Republic of the Congo), 7 in Latin America and the Caribbean, 6 in Asia and the Pacific, and 4 in Europe and North America (all by 2017). The majority of the endangered natural sites (11) are located in Africa.|$|E

25|$|Parks Canada is {{currently}} planning to build 17 additional crossing structures across the TCH to increase driver safety near the hamlet of Lake Louise. Lack of effectiveness of standard fencing in reducing bear mortality demonstrates that <b>additional</b> <b>measures</b> such as wire 'T-caps' {{on the fence}} may be needed for fencing to mitigate effectively for bears (Hallstrom, Clevenger, Maher and Whittington, in prep).|$|E
25|$|<b>Additional</b> <b>measures</b> {{included}} {{the replacement of}} the summit batteries with two 81mm fortress mortars, entirely buried in the mountain's peak. A battery of twinned 120mm mortars was added in the 1960s. Both batteries remained in service until 1994. These batteries covered the entire Savatan massif. The abandoned Batterie de Plex was replaced by the Batterie Dailly Nord, which remained operational until the end of 2003.|$|E
40|$|Compared {{with the}} {{domestic}} trade in livestock, intra-communal trade across the European Union (EU) {{is subject to}} costly, <b>additional</b> veterinary <b>measures.</b> Short-distance transportation just across a border requires more measures than long-distance domestic transportation, while {{the need for such}} <b>additional</b> cross-border <b>measures</b> can be questioned. This study examined the prospects for cost reductions from relaxing <b>additional</b> cross-border <b>measures</b> related to trade within the cross-border region of the Netherlands (NL) and Germany (GER); that is, North Rhine Westphalia and Lower Saxony. The study constructed a deterministic spread-sheet cost model to calculate the costs of both routine veterinary measures (standard measures that apply to both domestic and cross-border transport) and <b>additional</b> cross-border <b>measures</b> (extra measures that only apply to cross-border transport) as applied in 2010. This model determined costs by stakeholder, region and livestock sector, and studied the prospects for cost reduction by calculating the costs after the relaxation of <b>additional</b> cross-border <b>measures.</b> The selection criteria for relaxing these measures were (1) a low expected added value on preventing contagious livestock diseases, (2) no expected additional veterinary risks in case of relaxation of measures and (3) reasonable cost-saving possibilities. The total cost of routine veterinary <b>measures</b> and <b>additional</b> cross-border <b>measures</b> for the cross-border region was € 22. 1 million, 58 % (€ 12. 7 million) of which came from <b>additional</b> cross-border <b>measures.</b> Two-thirds of this € 12. 7 million resulted from the trade in slaughter animals. The main cost items were veterinary checks on animals (twice in the case of slaughter animals), export certification and control of export documentation. Four <b>additional</b> cross-border <b>measures</b> met the selection criteria for relaxation. The relaxation of these measures could save € 8. 2 million (€ 5. 0 million for NL and € 3. 2 million for GER) annually. Farmers would experience the greatest savings (99 %), and most savings resulted from relaxing <b>additional</b> cross-border <b>measures</b> related to poultry (48 %), mainly slaughter broilers (GER), and pigs (48 %), mainly slaughter pigs (NL). In particular, the trade in slaughter animals (dead-end hosts) is subject to measures, such as veterinary checks {{on both sides of the}} border that might not contribute to preventing contagious livestock diseases. Therefore, this study concludes that there are several possibilities for reducing the costs of <b>additional</b> cross-border <b>measures</b> in both countries...|$|R
25|$|As an <b>additional</b> <b>measure,</b> {{and as a}} forerunner to fire insurance, rich merchants would prepay wood {{retailers}} for {{the materials}} needed for building a house.

25|$|According to {{many analysts}} the {{currency}} war had largely fizzled out by mid-2011, though others including Mantega disagreed. As of March 2012, outbreaks of rhetoric were still occurring, with <b>additional</b> <b>measures</b> being adopted by countries like Brazil {{to control the}} appreciation of their currency. Yet by June, there were signs that currency misalignment had been levelling out in China and across the world, with even Mantega relaxing some of Brazils anti-appreciation controls. Alarms were raised concerning a possible second 21st currency war in January 2013, {{this time with the}} most apparent tension being between Japan and the Euro-zone.|$|E

25|$|Another {{problem with}} Volta's {{batteries}} was short battery life (an hour's worth at best), which {{was caused by}} two phenomena. The first was that the current produced electrolysed the electrolyte solution, resulting in a film of hydrogen bubbles forming on the copper, which steadily increased the internal resistance of the battery (this effect, called polarization, is counteracted in modern cells by <b>additional</b> <b>measures).</b> The other was a phenomenon called local action, wherein minute short-circuits would form around impurities in the zinc, causing the zinc to degrade. The latter problem was solved in 1835 by William Sturgeon, who found that amalgamated zinc, whose surface had been treated with some mercury, didn't suffer from local action.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} infrastructure, the city aims {{to build up}} a network of {{distinctive}} bicycle routes in order to achieve these objectives. At a final stage, the network will consist of main routes (Hauptrouten) for everyday use and comfort routes (Komfortrouten), with the latter focussing on leisure cycling. <b>Additional</b> <b>measures</b> such as special Velostationen providing bike related services are expected to help to further improve the quality. One of the key projects of the system is a tunnel beneath the tracks of the main railway station planned to combine a main connection with staffed possibilities where commuters can leave their bikes throughout the day. Apart from infrastructural measures, further approaches are planned in the fields of communication, education and administration.|$|E
25|$|Besides smoking cessation, the {{prevalence}} of smoking among people with schizophrenia also calls for <b>additional</b> <b>measures</b> in evaluation by mental health providers. Researchers argue that providers should incorporate tobacco use assessment into everyday clinical practice, as well as continuing assessments of cardiovascular health through measures such as blood pressure and diagnostics such as electrocardiography. Additionally there are ethical and practical concerns if healthcare facilities prohibit smoking without providing alternatives, particularly since withdrawal can alter the presentation of symptoms and response to treatment and may confuse or even exacerbate symptoms. Clinicians should also {{be aware of the}} consequences that can result from a lack of cigarettes, such as aggression, prostitution, trafficking, and general disruption. These consequences indicate that providers may need to help patients obtain cigarettes and/or monitor usage, although this may result in ethical concerns as well.|$|E
