5|$|Bibliographers do not <b>always</b> <b>agree</b> {{who should}} be listed as editor of any given issue of Amazing. For example, Gernsback was in control {{for the first three}} years, but Sloane {{performed}} all the editorial duties related to fiction, and he is sometimes described as the editor. Similarly, later editors were sometimes under the supervision of editorial directors. The table below, and the charts above, generally follow the mastheads in the magazines, with short notes added. More details are given in the publishing history section, above, which focuses on when the editors involved actually obtained control of the magazine contents, instead of when their names appeared on the masthead.|$|E
5|$|The {{leadership}} of the ACLU does not <b>always</b> <b>agree</b> on policy decisions; differences of opinion within the ACLU leadership have sometimes grown into major debates. In 1937, an internal debate erupted over whether to defend Henry Ford's right to distribute anti-union literature. In 1939, a heated debate took place over whether to prohibit communists from serving in ACLU leadership roles. During the early 1950s and Cold War McCarthyism, the board was divided on whether to defend communists. In 1968, a schism formed over whether to represent Dr. Benjamin Spock's anti-war activism. In 1973, there was internal conflict over whether to call for the impeachment of Richard Nixon. In 2005, there was internal conflict {{about whether or not}} a gag rule should be imposed on ACLU employees to prevent publication of internal disputes.|$|E
5|$|More recently, Maurice Friedman {{writes about}} the book {{in the context of}} the various {{attempts}} to find a universal essence - or perennial philosophy - within religion. He finds that Time and Eternity is a more systematic attempt at this than those proposed by Aldous Huxley or Ananda Coomaraswamy, but no more successful. For Friedman, the philosophy that Stace lays out in the book is derived from metaphysical speculation (that, like the ideas of Huxley and Coomaraswamy, is influenced by Vedanta), rather than mystical experience. Central to Friedman’s critique is the notion that there is a vast gulf between the mystical experience which Stace defines as beyond thought, and his philosophical system built on this. He also mentions that mystics do not <b>always</b> <b>agree</b> on what experiences, symbols and philosophies are the closest to the divine.|$|E

5|$|Systematic botany {{is part of}} {{systematic}} biology, which {{is concerned with the}} range and diversity of organisms and their relationships, particularly as determined by their evolutionary history. It involves, or is related to, biological classification, scientific taxonomy and phylogenetics. Biological classification is the method by which botanists group organisms into categories such as genera or species. Biological classification is a form of scientific taxonomy. Modern taxonomy is rooted in the work of Carl Linnaeus, who grouped species according to shared physical characteristics. These groupings have since been revised to align better with the Darwinian principle of common descent – grouping organisms by ancestry rather than superficial characteristics. While scientists do not <b>always</b> <b>agree</b> on how to classify organisms, molecular phylogenetics, which uses DNA sequences as data, has driven many recent revisions along evolutionary lines and is likely to continue to do so. The dominant classification system is called Linnaean taxonomy. It includes ranks and binomial nomenclature. The nomenclature of botanical organisms is codified in the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN) and administered by the International Botanical Congress.|$|E

25|$|Various {{schools of}} thought exist {{regarding}} the precise nature of Proto-Indo-European religion, which do not <b>always</b> <b>agree</b> with each other. Vedic mythology, Roman mythology, and Norse mythology are the main mythologies normally used for comparative reconstruction, though they are often supplemented with supporting evidence from the Baltic, Celtic, Greek, Slavic, and Hittite traditions as well.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{evidence}} consists of fossils. For many years, fossils of Mesozoic mammals and their immediate ancestors were very rare and fragmentary; but, since the mid-1990s, {{there have been many}} important new finds, especially in China. The relatively new techniques of molecular phylogenetics have also shed light on some aspects of mammalian evolution by estimating the timing of important divergence points for modern species. When used carefully, these techniques often, but not <b>always,</b> <b>agree</b> with the fossil record.|$|E

25|$|Van Til drew upon {{but did not}} <b>always</b> <b>agree</b> with, {{the work}} of Dutch Calvinist {{philosophers}} and theologians such as D. H. Th. Vollenhoven, Herman Dooyeweerd, Hendrik G. Stoker, Herman Bavinck, and Abraham Kuyper. Bahnsen describes Van Til's approach to Christian apologetics as pointing out the difference in ultimate principles between Christians and non-Christians and then showing that the non-Christian principles reduce to absurdity. In practice, this school utilizes {{what has come to}} be known as the transcendental argument for the existence of God.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} Holocene epoch, {{volcanism}} at Hoodoo Mountain produced lava flows with well-preserved lava channels on its northwestern and southwestern flanks and are largely unglaciated, suggesting the last eruptive activity at Hoodoo Mountain occurred in an ice-free environment. These lava flows originated from the mountain's flat-topped summit and volcanic vents on its flanks. Geologists do not <b>always</b> <b>agree</b> on {{the dates of}} these more recent eruptions, some dating them to nice thousand years ago, others to as recently as seven thousand years ago.|$|E
25|$|The {{advantage}} of this method {{is that it is}} easily measured with the appropriate equipment. The dis{{advantage of}} this criterion is that it is often irrelevant. For instance when making a rough cut, the surface finish is of no importance. Also, finish cuts often require a certain accuracy that naturally achieves a good surface finish. This rating method also doesn't <b>always</b> <b>agree</b> with other methods. For instance titanium alloys would rate well by the surface finish method, low by the tool life method, and intermediate by the power consumption method.|$|E
5000|$|The past participle almost <b>always</b> <b>agrees</b> {{with the}} subject when the {{auxiliary}} verb is être (beware, though, that pronominal verbs may produce tricky cases), or when the past participle is used as an adjective (which {{is essentially the same}} case).|$|R

25|$|The {{final phase}} of eruptive {{activity}} was effusive in nature with no explosive activity (VEI-0). This effusive volcanism produced lava flows with well-preserved lava channels on the northwest and southwest flanks of Hoodoo Mountain in the early Holocene epoch and are largely unglaciated, suggesting the final eruptive phase occurred in an ice-free environment. These lava flows originated from the mountain's flat-topped summit and volcanic vents on its flanks. Geologists do not <b>always</b> <b>agree</b> on the dates of these more recent eruptions, some dating them to nine thousand years ago, others to as recently as seven thousand years ago.|$|E
25|$|In {{drafting}} this prose scenario, Wagner drew upon numerous {{works of}} German and Scandinavian mythology, both primary texts (usually in contemporary German translations, though Wagner had {{some knowledge of}} Old Norse and Middle German) and commentaries on them. The most important of the former were the Völsunga Saga, the Poetic Edda, the Prose Edda, the Nibelungenlied and Thidriks saga af Bern, while {{the most important of}} the latter were Jacob Grimm's German Mythology and Wilhelm Grimm's The German Hero-Saga. In addition to these, however, Wagner picked up various details from at least twenty-two other , including a number of key philosophical texts that informed the symbolism of the Ring. Wagner contradicts his sources on various points – necessarily so as the sources don’t <b>always</b> <b>agree</b> with one another – conflates disparate stories into continuous narratives, creates some new, memorable characters by combining minor characters from different sources, etc. The final scenario is as much a unique recreation of the original myths as the Nibelungenlied was in its day.|$|E
25|$|Another {{possible}} {{source of}} heterogeneity among study results is {{the variation in}} techniques used to assess vitamin concentrations in milk. HPLC {{was selected as the}} ‘‘gold standard’’ method for determination of fat-soluble vitamins by AOAC International. No gold standard has been identified for water-soluble vitamins; fluorescence spectroscopy, chromatography, and microbiological methods are all referenced in the AOAC official methods. Metaregression for vitamin B1 and folate studies revealed a significant association between study and method used to quantify vitamins; however, this variable was not significant for other vitamins. Analytic methods must take into consideration separation of vitamers for each vitamin, the methodology used for calibration of external standards, retention of vitamer conformation, and successful recovery. The solvents, standards, execution of extraction procedures, and equipment used to carry out these analyses may differ among investigators and can introduce variation among studies. Hollman et al. investigated 18 laboratories that were asked to analyze water-soluble vitamin contents in selected foods. These authors reported that in contrast to the fat-soluble vitamins a wider range of methods was used for water-soluble vitamins and that results from different methods did not <b>always</b> <b>agree</b> for vitamins B2 and C.|$|E

500|$|Both the Liber Wigorniensis and Hemming's work {{contain a}} number of forged charters. The {{historian}} Julia Barrow has determined that at least 25 of the 155charters in the Liber are forged, but cautions {{that this is the}} minimum estimate. Barrow identifies more than 30 of the charters in Hemming's work as forgeries, including some that are duplicates from the Liber. Some of the stories that form Hemming's narrative do not <b>always</b> <b>agree</b> with other sources, and Ker says [...] "it is safer to trust to the main facts than to the details of his [...] stories".|$|E
500|$|Each god descends {{from his}} or her own genealogy, pursues differing interests, has a certain area of expertise, and is governed by a unique personality; however, these {{descriptions}} arise from a multiplicity of archaic local variants, which do not <b>always</b> <b>agree</b> with one another. When these gods are called upon in poetry, prayer or cult, they are referred to by a combination of their name and epithets, that identify them by these distinctions from other manifestations of themselves (e.g., Apollo Musagetes is [...] "Apollo, [...] leader of the Muses"). Alternatively the epithet may identify a particular and localized aspect of the god, sometimes thought to be already ancient during the classical epoch of Greece.|$|E
500|$|Hazlitt ends his {{detailed}} account of the plays with a chapter on [...] "Doubtful Plays of Shakespear", {{the greater part of}} which consists of direct quotations from Schlegel, whose remarks Hazlitt finds worth considering, if he does not <b>always</b> <b>agree</b> with them. Most of the plays now accepted as Shakespeare's, or at least partly by Shakespeare, were also accepted as his by Hazlitt. The two notable exceptions were Titus Andronicus and Pericles, Prince of Tyre. Of the former, Hazlitt nevertheless respected Schlegel's defence of it enough to quote the latter at length. And he allows that some parts of Pericles could have been by Shakespeare but more likely were [...] "imitations" [...] of Shakespeare [...] "by some contemporary poet." ...|$|E
