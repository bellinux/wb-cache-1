40|$|Objective : To {{assess the}} effect of {{different}} aids on the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> hemiplegic subjects took from them. The relationship between the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>support,</b> severity <b>of</b> hemiplegia and walking ability were also assessed. Design : Hemiplegic subjects’ gait and the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> they took from the aid were measured as they walked with a normal height stick, a high stick and a tripod. Subjects : Fifteen subjects with a hemiplegia of more than three months’ duration who could walk independently were recruited. Outcome measures : Velocity, the gross function section of the Rivermead Motor Assessment, percentage bodyweight taken through the aid, the aid contact time, {{the placement of the}} aid, and the lateral shift of the pelvis when weight bearing were assessed. Results : No differences in the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> or walking ability were found with the different aids. There was a significant relationship between severity of hemiplegia and the percentage of bodyweight taken through the aid (r = – 0. 67), between aid contact time and severity of hemiplegia (– 0. 53) and between aid contact time and walking ability (– 0. 53). No relationship between walking ability and other measures <b>of</b> the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> was found. Conclusions : Different types of aid did not influence the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> taken by hemiplegic subjects. These results contradict the beliefs of many neurological physiotherapists in Britain and the clinical implications are discussed...|$|R
