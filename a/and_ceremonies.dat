5|$|Although {{most of the}} {{writings}} that have survived from this period are religious in nature, there is sufficient literary evidence that secular writing was also popular in the imperial court. Some of these writings carry useful information on urban life, grandeur of the imperial and provincial courts, royal weddings <b>and</b> <b>ceremonies.</b> Other works refer the general town planning, fortifications and ordnance details at Vijayanagara and other important cities, irrigation reservoirs, merchants and shops dealing {{in a variety of}} commodities. On occasion, authors dwell on mythical cities that reflect their idealised views on contemporary life. Commonly found in these works are description of artists and professionals and their relationship with the court. These included poets, bards, composers, painters, sculptors, dancers, theatrical performers and even wrestlers. Others who find mention are political leaders, ambassadors, concubines, accountants, goldsmiths, moneylenders and even servants and door keepers.|$|E
5|$|By 1665, he was {{collecting}} information for his county history, The Antiquities of Berkshire; and in 1672 he published The Institution, Laws <b>and</b> <b>Ceremonies</b> of the Most Noble Order of the Garter, a lavish folio with illustrations by Wenceslaus Hollar, {{for which he}} had conducted years of research. An earlier attempt to promote himself as the official historiographer of the order had failed but this work firmly established Ashmole as an expert. He had written a large part of it in 1665 while living in the country to escape the Great Plague which was then raging in London. Presentation copies sent to the foreign members of the order were reciprocated by gifts of gold insignia from the King of Denmark, the Elector of Brandenburg and the Elector Palatine. Ashmole performed the heraldic and genealogical work of his office scrupulously, and he was considered a leading authority on court protocol and ceremony.|$|E

5|$|Commitment to SS {{ideology}} was emphasized {{throughout the}} recruitment, membership process, and training. Members of the SS were indoctrinated in the racial policy of Nazi Germany, and were taught {{that it was}} necessary to remove from Germany people deemed by that policy as inferior. Esoteric rituals and the awarding of regalia and insignia for milestones in the SS man's career suffused SS members even further with Nazi ideology. Members were expected to renounce their Christian faith, and Christmas was replaced with a solstice celebration. Church weddings were replaced with SS Ehewein, a pagan ceremony invented by Himmler. These pseudo-religious rites <b>and</b> <b>ceremonies</b> often took place near SS-dedicated monuments or in special SS-designated places. In 1933, Himmler bought Wewelsburg, a castle in Westphalia. He initially intended it to be used as an SS training centre, but its role came to include hosting SS dinners and neo-pagan rituals.|$|E
5|$|Even before Carpathia {{arrived in}} New York, efforts were getting {{underway}} {{to retrieve the}} dead. Four ships chartered by the White Star Line succeeded in retrieving 328bodies; 119 were buried at sea, while the remaining 209 were brought ashore to the Canadian port of Halifax, Nova Scotia, where 150 of them were buried. Memorials were raised in various placesâ€“ New York, Washington, Southampton, Liverpool, Belfast and Lichfield, among othersâ€“ <b>and</b> <b>ceremonies</b> were held {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic to commemorate the dead and raise funds to aid the survivors. The bodies of most of Titanics victims were never recovered, and the only evidence of their deaths was found 73years later among the debris on the seabed: pairs of shoes lying side by side, where bodies had once lain before eventually decomposing.|$|E
5|$|Glinicki was {{philosophical}} {{about the}} win, noting in December 2012 {{that there were}} many awards <b>and</b> <b>ceremonies,</b> but that the memory of London was fading over time.

It {{went on to win the}} national championship for the eighth time in 2013. The national team was not so fortunate, losing the European Championship to the Netherlands by a point, 56â€“57, before a home town crowd in Frankfurt in July 2013.|$|E
