50|$|In October 1956, the Air Provost Marshal {{requested}} {{permission to}} design and field test an official <b>Air</b> Police <b>Shield.</b> By May 1957, permission had been received and the design process had been completed. Units across the Air Force in three major commands began receiving the first official <b>Air</b> Police <b>Shields</b> to field test. Initially, the shield {{was similar to the}} current representation, save for {{the fact that it was}} silver-plated with blue and white inlays and bore the words 'Air Police.' During field trials, AP's reported that the inlays often chipped off, giving the shield a worn look. Additionally the pins that held the shield to the uniform often broke off. Following a redesign, the inlays were deleted, and the pins were replaced by a clasp much the same as found on civilian police badges. Starting in February 1959, distribution of the new <b>Air</b> Police <b>Shield</b> to units across the Air Force was begun, and completed in 1960. During this transition, AP's continued to wear the original brassard.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{compare the}} {{accuracy}} of BiliCheck™ (Respironics, Marietta, GA) and Konica-Minolta <b>Air</b> <b>Shield</b> JM- 103 (Drager Medical Inc, Telford, PA) to evaluate total serum bilirubin (TSB). METHODS: Prospective blinded study comparing two diagnostic devices in 630 neonates requiring TSB measurement. RESULTS: Linear regression analysis showed a good correlation between BiliCheck™ and TSB (r= 0. 8212) {{as well as between}} JM- 103 and TSB (r= 0. 8686). BiliCheck shows a tendency to underestimate TSB. The mean difference in TSB-TcB was - 1. 4 mg/dL for BC (- 4. 7 /+ 1. 8 mg/dL) and 0. 3 mg/dL for JM- 103 (- 2. 6 /+ 3. 2 mg/dL). ROC analysis for TSB≥ 12 mg/dL showed area under the curve for BiliCheck™ significantly lower than those for JM- 103 (p< 0. 0001). JM- 103 resulted less time expensive than BiliCheck. CONCLUSIONS: In spite of similar diagnostic accuracy JM- 103 could be preferred for some practical advantages, but its suitability in performing universal screening for severe hyperbilirubinemia deserves further investigations...|$|E
40|$|Currently, {{thousands}} of model 9975 transportation packages are in {{use by the}} US Department of Energy (DOE); the design {{of which has been}} certified by DOE for shipment of Type B radioactive and fissile materials in accordance with Part 71, Title 10 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), or 10 CFR 71, Packaging and Transportation of Radioactive Material. These transportation packages are also approved for the storage of DOE-STD- 3013 containers at the Savannah River Site (SRS). As such, the 9975 has been continuously exposed to the service environment {{for a period of time}} greater than the approved transportation service life. In order to ensure the material integrity as specified in the safety basis, an extensive surveillance program is in place in K-Area Complex (KAC) to monitor the structural and thermal properties of the fiberboard of the 9975 shipping packages. The surveillance approach uses a combination of Non-Destructive Examination (NDE) field surveillance and Destructive Examination (DE) lab testing to validate the 9975 performance assumptions. The fiberboard in the 9975 is credited with thermal insulation, criticality control and resistance to crushing. During surveillance monitoring in KAC, an increased axial gap of the fiberboard was discovered on selected items packaged at Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site (RFETS). Many of these packages were later found to contain excess moisture. Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) testing has resulted in a better understanding of the relationship between the fiberboard moisture level and compaction of the fiberboard under storage conditions and during transport. In laboratory testing, the higher moisture content has been shown to correspond to higher total compaction of fiberboard material and compaction rate. The fiberboard height is reduced by compression of the layers. This change is observed directly in the axial gap between the flange and the <b>air</b> <b>shield.</b> The axial gap measurement is made during the pre-use inspection or during the annual recertification process and is a screening measurement for changes in the fiberboard...|$|E
40|$|Life {{extension}} package LE 1 (9975 - 03382) was instrumented {{and subjected}} to a temperature/humidity environment that bounds KAMS package storage conditions for 92 weeks. During this time, the maximum fiberboard temperature was {approx} 180 F, and was established {{by a combination of}} internal heat (12 watts) and external heat ({approx} 142 F). The relative humidity external to the package was maintained at 80 %RH. This package was removed from test in November 2010 after several degraded conditions were observed during a periodic examination. These conditions included degraded fiberboard (easily broken, bottom layer stuck to the drum), corrosion of the drum, and separation of the <b>air</b> <b>shield</b> from the upper fiberboard assembly. Several tests and parameters were used to characterize the package components. Results from these tests generally indicate agreement between this full-scale shipping package and small-scale laboratory tests on fiberboard and O-ring samples. These areas of agreement include the rate of fiberboard weight loss, change in fiberboard thermal conductivity, fiberboard compression strength, and O-ring compression set. In addition, this package provides an example {{of the extent to which}} moisture within the fiberboard can redistribute in the presence of a temperature gradient such as might be created by a 12 watt internal heat load. Much of the moisture near the fiberboard ID surface migrated towards the OD surface, but there was not a significant axial moisture gradient during most of the test duration. Only during the last inspection period (i. e. after 92 weeks exposure during the second phase) did enough moisture migrate to the bottom fiberboard layers to cause saturation. A side effect of moisture migration is the leaching of soluble compounds from the fiberboard. In particular, the corrosion observed on the drum appears related primarily to the leaching and concentration of chlorides. In most locations, this attack appears to be general corrosion, with shallow attack of the drum surface. The primary areas susceptible to corrosion are weld/heat-affected zones. However, one corrosion location not immediately associated with a weld was tested for, and confirmed as having, throughwall penetration. An increase in the axial gap at the top of the package is also related to the migration of moisture within the fiberboard. As moisture redistributes within the package, a majority of the fiberboard loses moisture (on average) and shrinks axially. In addition, an increased moisture content of the bottom fiberboard layers locally reduces its compression strength, leading to compaction of those layers under the weight of the package internal components. In addition to these moisture-driven phenomena, the fiberboard will shrink due to slow pyrolysis in an elevated temperature/humidity environment. Under the collective influence of these effects, the axial gap in the LE 1 package increased from an initial value of 0. 58 inch and exceeded the 1 inch (maximum) criterion after approximately 18 weeks conditioning. The axial gap eventually reached 1. 86 inches. Despite the degradation seen in several of the package components (drum, fiberboard, shield and O-rings), the package appears to have retained sufficient integrity to meet the functional requirements for storage in KAMS. This demonstrates a degree of robustness in the package design relative to the storage environment...|$|E

The benefits of using ICP are shown in terms of the range of transmission loss that cover compared to the current carbon and metal based materials are demonstrated. The experimental results are shown that the transmission loss (S 21) of the ICP materials varies and depends on its conductivity, permittivity, and permeability. This article establishes that Electromagnetic Radiation (EMR) measurement simulated by COMSOL 4. 3 b provides valid results.

40|$|Conclusions. The {{characteristic}} {{features of}} the Hh specimen conformed {{to those of other}} Pleistocene human fossils, indicating strong cranial structures and a heavy mandible. The mastoid was large and suggested a powerful sternocleidomastoid muscle. The inner ear and tympanic cavities were similar in size and orientation, suggesting that their functions were probably similar. Our observations suggest that the left ear of this Hh specimen was healthy. The large canaliculo /fenestral angle confirms that this ancestor was bipedal. It also strongly suggests that Hh individuals were predisposed to develop certain pathologies of the labyrinth capsule associated with bipedalism, in particular otosclerosis. Objective.
