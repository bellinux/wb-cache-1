In early 1915, the sections of UB-10 were shipped to Antwerp for assembly in what was typically a two- to three-week process.

40|$|<b>Load</b> {{carriage}} <b>and</b> {{muscular fatigue}} {{are two major}} stressors experienced by military recruits during basic training. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the influences of <b>load</b> carriage <b>and</b> muscular fatigue on ground reaction forces <b>and</b> ground reaction <b>loading</b> rates during walking. Eighteen healthy males performed the following tasks in order: unloaded <b>and</b> unfatigued walking, <b>loaded</b> <b>and</b> unfatigued walking, fatiguing exercise, <b>loaded</b> <b>and</b> fatigued walking, and unloaded and fatigued walking. The fatiguing exercise consisted of a series of metered step-ups and heel raises with a 16 -kg rucksack. Loaded walking tasks were performed with a 32 -kg rucksack. Two-way repeated measures analysis of variances were used to determine the effects of fatigue <b>and</b> <b>load</b> carriage on ground reaction forces <b>and</b> <b>loading</b> rates. Muscular fatigue has a significant influence on peak vertical ground reaction force <b>and</b> <b>loading</b> rate (p 3 ̆c 0. 01). Load carriage has a significant influence on peak ground reaction forces <b>and</b> <b>loading</b> rates (p 3 ̆c 0. 001). As both muscular fatigue <b>and</b> <b>load</b> carriage lead to large increases of ground reaction forces <b>and</b> <b>loading</b> rates, the high incidence of lower extremity overuse injuries in the military may be associated with muscular fatigue <b>and</b> <b>load</b> carriage...|$|R

5|$|Although {{the outward}} {{terminal}} {{of the line}} {{was to be the}} quay at Watchet, the west pier had been practically unusable for some considerable time, and boats were beached <b>and</b> <b>loaded</b> direct from carts brought on to the foreshore. After considerable public pressure, the Watchet Harbour Act was passed in 1857, placing it under the control of Commissioners; they built a new east pier and rebuilt the west pier; the work was finished in 1862, and 500ton vessels could enter the harbour. The WSMR used the west pier, and the newly arrived, broad gauge West Somerset Railway, a branch from the Bristol and Exeter Railway, used the east pier.|$|E

The first part examines the behaviour of the horse while it is being harnessed <b>and</b> <b>loaded,</b> then unloaded and unharnessed, and the remaining three parts evaluate the way the horse behaves when being driven.

5|$|A {{storm in}} the {{southern}} Atlantic caused the loss of several ships, and the six remaining ships eventually rendezvoused in the Mozambique Channel before proceeding to Calicut in India. Cabral was originally successful in negotiating trading rights, but Arab merchants saw Portugal's venture {{as a threat to}} their monopoly and stirred up an attack by both Muslims and Hindus on the Portuguese entrepôt. The Portuguese sustained many casualties and their facilities were destroyed. Cabral took vengeance by looting and burning the Arab fleet and then bombarded the city in retaliation for its ruler having failed to explain the unexpected attack. From Calicut the expedition sailed to the Kingdom of Cochin, another Indian city-state, where Cabral befriended its ruler <b>and</b> <b>loaded</b> his ships with coveted spices before returning to Europe. Despite the loss of human lives and ships, Cabral's voyage was deemed a success upon his return to Portugal. The extraordinary profits resulting from the sale of the spices bolstered the Portuguese Crown's finances and helped lay the foundation of a Portuguese Empire that would stretch from the Americas to the Far East.|$|E

With the aircraft refuelled <b>and</b> <b>loaded</b> with bombs, he—in company with the rest of the squadron—then led his flight on a total of four sorties against the enemy insurgents. No.45 Squadron succeeded in destroying with its bombs a pontoon bridge, a boat, and a trench filled with soldiers, before inflicting at least a hundred casualties with machine gun fire. Heavy rain washed other bridges away and by 18 June the stranded Austrian forces on the Allied bank of the river were routed by a counterattack.|$|E
