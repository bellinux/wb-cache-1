5|$|Palestine {{had been}} a British Mandate {{since the end of}} World War I. Under the terms of the mandate, Great Britain was {{responsible}} for the government <b>and</b> <b>security</b> <b>of</b> the country. It had long been a stated British aim to establish a Jewish homeland in Palestine and between 1922 and 1939 over 250,000 Jewish immigrants had arrived in the country. However, Arab resistance and World War II prompted the British to curtail immigration. The time also saw the rise of the Jewish Resistance Movement, which eventually came into conflict with the British authorities.|$|E

5|$|The Bintulu Port Authority was {{established}} in 1981. It started port operation in 1983 at Tanjung Kidurong. Following a privatisation exercise, Bintulu Port Sdn Bhd (BPSB) was founded on 23 December 1992 and commenced operation on 1 January 1993. BPA is currently responsible for regulatory exercises <b>and</b> <b>security</b> <b>of</b> the port. Meanwhile, BPSB is responsible for cargo handling at the Bintulu International Container Terminal (BICT). The port also provides Vessel traffic service to shipping vessels. The annual total cargo throughput is 45.4 million tonnes, consisting of 58% LNG and 42% non-LNG products. As of 31 December 2014, it generated a total revenue of RM552.3 million per year. Bintulu Port is the busiest port in Sarawak.|$|E

5|$|Because males emerge {{earlier than}} females, the males compete for mating territories {{surrounding}} the nests {{in which the}} females are located. During a fight, the males risk damaging their wings or appendages by butting and grappling. Another defense technique is to grab another male and carry it high into the air, which {{is thought to be}} a demonstration of strength. As a general rule, the larger the male the more predominant he is in battles. Age influences the success in the defense <b>and</b> <b>security</b> <b>of</b> territory; the younger the wasp the greater the chance of a successful takeover of territory. Some small males even engage in non-territorial mating tactics, and delay their emergence so as to have a fairer chance of survival.|$|E
5|$|In Singapore, the Penal Code {{lays out}} {{sanctions}} for non-compliance with the Termination of Pregnancy Act, which limits abortion {{to women who}} have not been pregnant for more than 24 weeks. By not conferring the right to life upon fetuses younger than the stipulated period, the legislation has accorded greater weight to the safety <b>and</b> <b>security</b> <b>of</b> expectant mothers who are threatened by their unborn children. This is in contrast with the approach taken in the Philippines, where the Constitution provides that the state shall equally protect {{the life of the mother}} and the life of the unborn from conception. Similarly, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms of the Czech Republic states that human life deserves to be protected before birth. Chances of a universal consensus on this issue are slim due to the difficulty in defining the beginning of life.|$|E

5|$|The Priory's {{principal}} church, St Bartholomew-the-Great, was reconfigured {{after the}} dissolution of the monasteries losing the western third of its nave. Reformed as an Anglican parish church, its parish boundaries were limited {{to the site of the}} ancient priory and a small tract of land between the church and Long Lane. The parish of St Bartholomew the Great was designated as a Liberty, responsible for the upkeep <b>and</b> <b>security</b> <b>of</b> its fabric and the land within its boundaries. With the advent of street lighting, mains water and sewerage during the Victorian era, maintenance of such an ancient parish with so few parishioners became increasingly uneconomical after the Industrial Revolution. Thus, in 1910, it agreed to be incorporated by the Corporation of London which guaranteed financial support and security. Great St Barts' present parish boundary includes just 10 feet (3.048 m) of Smithfield — possibly delineating a former right of way.|$|E
5|$|There are 30,200 {{officers}} {{under the}} prefecture, and {{a fleet of}} more than 6,000 vehicles, including police cars, motorcycles, fire trucks, boats and helicopters. In addition to traditional police duties, the local police monitors the number of discount sales held by large stores (no more than two a year are allowed) and verify that, during summer holidays, at least one bakery is open in every neighbourhood. The national police has its own special unit for riot control and crowd control <b>and</b> <b>security</b> <b>of</b> public buildings, called the Compagnies Républicaines de Sécurité (CRS), a unit formed in 1944 right after the liberation of France. Vans of CRS agents are frequently seen in {{the centre of the}} city when there are demonstrations and public events.|$|E
5|$|With {{only one}} {{significant}} opencast {{in the local}} area mining past 2008, along with another smaller opencast at Stony Heap, {{there is a need}} for more local supplies of coal for the station because of the risks in depending upon overseas sources of coal. Long distance supplies of coal can see sharp fluctuations in price, as well as the flexibility <b>and</b> <b>security</b> <b>of</b> the supply, whereas local sources aren't as vulnerable to interruptions and have fixed, contracted prices. The station is not an established importer of coal, having only imported since 2005. It is situated a long way from the major coal unloading ports of Teesside, Hull and Immingham, which have been booked by power stations closer to them. This means that coal for the power station needs to be imported via Blyth or the Port of Tyne. However, because of the small sizes of these docks, they can only receive ships from Poland and Russia. Due to high production costs and industry restructuring in Poland though, the only realistic source of imported coal for the station is Russia. The environmental impact of shipping 1,000,000 tonnes of coal from Russia to Lynemouth is the production of 12,812 tonnes of CO2, whereas hauling coal from local mines to the station would produce only 703 tonnes of CO2. There are currently two local opencast mines for which planning approval have been granted, one at Shotton near Cramlington approved in 2007, the other at Potland Burn near Ashington approved in October 2008. However, the coal mined from Potland Burn would have too high a sulphur content to meet the station's environmental requirements, meaning it wouldn't be an immediate choice of coal for the station. Coal had been provided by the Delhi surface mine at Blagdon, owned by Banks Developments, since 2002. It finished extracting coal in March 2009, following the permission of extension proposals to its original plans in May 2007.|$|E
