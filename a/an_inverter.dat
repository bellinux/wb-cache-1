5|$|Controller {{advances}} have exploited dramatic {{increases in the}} voltage and current ratings and switching frequency of solid-state power devices {{over the past six}} decades. Introduced in 1983, the insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) has {{in the past two decades}} come to dominate VFDs as <b>an</b> <b>inverter</b> switching device.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two primary}} {{alternatives}} for configuring this conversion equipment; centralised and string inverters, although {{in some cases}} individual, or micro-inverters are used. Single inverters allows optimizing the output of each panel, and multiple inverters increases the reliability by limiting the loss of output when <b>an</b> <b>inverter</b> fails.|$|E
5|$|The {{array of}} a {{photovoltaic}} power system, or PV system, produces direct current (DC) power which fluctuates with the sunlight's intensity. For practical use this usually requires conversion to certain desired voltages or alternating current (AC), {{through the use}} of inverters. Multiple solar cells are connected inside modules. Modules are wired together to form arrays, then tied to <b>an</b> <b>inverter,</b> which produces power at the desired voltage, and for AC, the desired frequency/phase.|$|E

5|$|The VFD {{controller}} is a solid-state {{power electronics}} conversion system consisting of three distinct sub-systems: a rectifier bridge converter, a direct current (DC) link, and <b>an</b> <b>inverter.</b> Voltage-source inverter (VSI) drives (see 'Generic topologies' sub-section below) {{are by far}} {{the most common type of}} drives. Most drives are AC-AC drives in that they convert AC line input to AC inverter output. However, in some applications such as common DC bus or solar applications, drives are configured as DC-AC drives. The most basic rectifier converter for the VSI drive is configured as a three-phase, six-pulse, full-wave diode bridge. In a VSI drive, the DC link consists of a capacitor which smooths out the converter's DC output ripple and provides a stiff input to the inverter. This filtered DC voltage is converted to quasi-sinusoidal AC voltage output using the inverter's active switching elements. VSI drives provide higher power factor and lower harmonic distortion than phase-controlled current-source inverter (CSI) and load-commutated inverter (LCI) drives (see 'Generic topologies' sub-section below). The drive controller can also be configured as a phase converter having single-phase converter input and three-phase inverter output.|$|E

25|$|The Duality Principle, or De Morgan's laws, can be {{understood}} as asserting that complementing all three ports of an AND gate converts it to an OR gate and vice versa, as shown in Figure 4 below.

The triangle denotes the operation that simply copies the input to the output; the small {{circle on the}} output denotes the actual inversion complementing the input. The convention of putting such a circle on any port means that the signal passing through this port is complemented on the way through, whether it is an input or output port.|$|E

25|$|Fluorescent lamps can run {{directly}} from a direct current (DC) supply of sufficient voltage to strike an arc. The ballast must be resistive, and would consume about as much power as the lamp. When operated from DC, the starting switch is often arranged to reverse the polarity of the supply to the lamp each time it is started; otherwise, the mercury accumulates {{at one end of}} the tube. Fluorescent lamps are (almost) never operated {{directly from}} DC for those reasons. Instead, <b>an</b> <b>inverter</b> converts the DC into AC and provides the current-limiting function as described below for electronic ballasts.|$|E
25|$|A {{inverter}} or capsizing {{line can}} {{be attached to the}} top of the bag. This line should be long enough and strong enough to attach to an independent anchor point so that if the lift bag or rigging fails the bag will be inverted and the air will escape, preventing a runaway lift. This procedure is generally used for short distance transport near the bottom, as when aligning large components for assembly. With this method the load will generally hold the bag in the upright position, so the tripping line may be subjected to considerable load and the bag may not invert. <b>An</b> <b>inverter</b> line can also be attached to the load, so it will capsize the bag if it breaks free of the load, but this will not stop a runaway lift, and a holdback line is used for this purpose.|$|E

2500|$|Converting DC {{power from}} one voltage to another {{is much more}} complicated. [...] One method of DC-to-DC {{conversion}} first converts power to AC (using a device called <b>an</b> <b>inverter),</b> then uses a transformer to change the voltage, and finally rectifies power back to DC. A frequency of typically several tens of kilohertz is used, as this requires much smaller inductance than at lower frequencies and obviates the use of heavy, bulky, and expensive iron-cored units. Another method of converting DC voltages uses a charge pump, using rapid switching to change the connections of capacitors; this technique is generally limited to supplies up {{to a couple of}} watts, owing to the size of capacitors required.|$|E
