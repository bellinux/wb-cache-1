40|$|The human-platelet {{aggregating}} {{factor in}} preparations of bovine plasma and bovine <b>antihemophilic</b> <b>factor</b> {{has been reported}} to be an activity of bovine <b>antihemophilic</b> <b>factor.</b> However, we show that activities of aggregating factor and <b>antihemophilic</b> <b>factor</b> are present in varying proportion in different preparations of <b>antihemophilic</b> <b>factor.</b> Aggregating factor activity is more stable on storage than is <b>antihemophilic</b> <b>factor</b> activity and can be selectively adsorbed by human platelets.

The factors were also separated during agarose chromatography in 0. 25 M CaCl 2, which yields a small-molecular-weight moiety with <b>antihemophilic</b> <b>factor</b> activity; aggregating factor activity continued to elute in the void volume. Thus, aggregating factor activity is clearly separable from <b>antihemophilic</b> <b>factor</b> activity. The usual physiologic platelet-aggregating reactions require fresh platelets.

40|$|Platelet-active “von Willebrand factor” is {{a poorly}} {{characterized}} activity of a plasma-protein macromolecular complex. A new simple assay for von Willebrand factor {{is based on}} the dose response relation of the factor and the ristocetin platelet aggregation time. This assay uses the “snowstorm” macroscopic endpoint. A multiply transfused subject with von Willebrand's disease was observed to have a circulating inhibitor that blocks normal ristocetin aggregation of platelets, but not ADP-, epinephrine-, or collagen-induced aggregation. The inhibitor was not adsorbed by normal platelets, and was stable to heating at 56 ° for 30 min and to repeated freezings and thawings. This inhibitor also prevents action on human platelets by platelet-aggregating factor of bovine plasma, indicating this bovine factor activity is a function of von Willebrand factor. Three inhibitors were compared: (1) the von Willebrand factor inhibitor specifically blocked von Willebrand factor activity, (2) a human antibody from a hemophiliac inhibited only <b>antihemophilic</b> <b>factor</b> activity, and (3) a rabbit antiserum to a preparation of human <b>antihemophilic</b> <b>factor</b> inhibited both activities.

40|$|One of {{the more}} puzzling {{features}} of modern blood coagulation theory is the pathogenesis of hemophilia with its mutually exclusive "procoagulant-deficit " and "anticephalin-excess" hypotheses. Briefly, in the "procoagulant-defidt " hypothesis the hemophilia gene is expressed biochemically as inadequate production of the <b>antihemophilic</b> <b>factor</b> (AHF), a coagulant factor required for normal hemostasis. The <b>antihemophilic</b> <b>factor</b> {{is considered to be}} produced in adequate amounts in normal animals by the action of the normal allele(s) at the hemophilia locus (1). This factor is thought to be necessary at an early stage in dotting for the normal rapid transformarion of the proenzyme, prothrombin, into its active form, thrombin (2). The "anticephalin-excess " hypothesis postulates that the bleeding tendency in hemophilia results from excess of a circulating inhibitor, "anticephalin. " This substance is believed to be present also in normal blood at a lower titer acting to prevent intravascular dotting (3 - 7). An important corollary of this hypothesis {{is that there is a}} full complement of coagulant factors in hemophilic blood.

40|$|I T HAS BEEN {{apparent}} {{from its inception}} that the thromboplastin generation test 1 ’ 2 {{is more complicated than}} the simple interaction, in the presence of calcium, of three factors whose names are given to the reactants of the test: platelets, <b>antihemophilic</b> <b>factor</b> and Christmas factor (plasma thromboplastin component, PTC). The platelet reactant contributes at least two factors active in this test: a protein-linked phospholipid, and accelerator globulin (AcG), the latter probably having been adsorbed from plasma. The <b>antihemophilic</b> <b>factor,</b> supplied as aluminum hydroxide- or barium sulfate-adsorbed plasma, is accompanied by at least three other factors: accelerator globulin (AcG), plasma thromboplastin antecedent (PTA) 3 and Hageman factor. ’ It may also contain inhibitors.
