5|$|In 1989, <b>Air</b> <b>France</b> {{signed a}} letter of {{agreement}} to donate a Concorde to the National Air and Space Museum in Washington D.C. upon the aircraft's retirement. On 12 June 2003, <b>Air</b> <b>France</b> honoured that agreement, donating Concorde F-BVFA (serial 205) to the Museum upon the completion of its last flight. This aircraft was the first <b>Air</b> <b>France</b> Concorde to open service to Rio de Janeiro, Washington, D.C., and New York and had flown 17,824 hours. It is {{on display at the}} Smithsonian's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center at Dulles Airport.|$|E

5|$|British Airways and <b>Air</b> <b>France</b> {{operated}} the supersonic airliner Aerospatiale-BAC Concorde, and the world's first supersonic passenger service flew in January 1976 from London Heathrow to Bahrain. Services to the US began on 24 May 1976 with {{a flight to}} Washington Dulles airport, and flights to New York JFK airport followed on 22 September 1977. Service to Singapore was established in co-operation with Singapore Airlines as {{a continuation of the}} flight to Bahrain. Following the <b>Air</b> <b>France</b> Concorde crash in Paris and a slump in air travel following the 11 September attacks in New York in 2001, it was decided to cease Concorde operations in 2003 after 27 years of service. The final commercial Concorde flight was BA002 from New York JFK to London Heathrow on 24 October 2003.|$|E
5|$|Cathay Pacific or Singapore Airlines need {{to balance}} {{frequency}} and capacity. China Southern struggled {{two years to}} use its A380s from Beijing and finally received Boeing 787s in Guangzhou where it is based, which can’t command a premium unlike Beijing or Shanghai. In 2013, <b>Air</b> <b>France</b> withdrew A380 services to Singapore and Montreal and switched to smaller aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Concorde had livery restrictions; the {{majority}} of the surface had to be covered with a highly reflective white paint to avoid overheating the aluminium structure due to heating effects from supersonic flight at Mach 2. The white finish reduced the skin temperature by 6 to 11 degrees Celsius. In 1996, <b>Air</b> <b>France</b> briefly painted F-BTSD in a predominantly blue livery, {{with the exception of the}} wings, in a promotional deal with Pepsi. In this paint scheme, <b>Air</b> <b>France</b> was advised to remain at Mach 2 for no more than 20 minutes at a time, but there was no restriction at speeds under Mach 1.7. F-BTSD was used because it was not scheduled for any long flights that required extended Mach 2 operations.|$|E

5|$|From December 1978 to May 1980, Braniff International Airways leased 11 Concordes, five from <b>Air</b> <b>France</b> and six from British Airways. These {{were used}} on subsonic flights between Dallas-Fort Worth and Washington Dulles International Airport, flown by Braniff flight crews. <b>Air</b> <b>France</b> and British Airways crews then took {{over for the}} {{continuing}} supersonic flights to London and Paris. The aircraft were registered in both the United States and their home countries; the European registration was covered while being operated by Braniff, retaining full AF/BA liveries. The flights were not profitable and typically less than 50% booked, forcing Braniff to end its tenure as the only US Concorde operator in May 1980.|$|E
5|$|In January 2015, the US National Transportation Safety Board cited Flight 370 and <b>Air</b> <b>France</b> Flight 447 when it issued eight safety {{recommendations}} related to locating aircraft wreckage in remote or underwater locations; and repeated recommendations for a crash-protected cockpit image recorder and tamper-resistant flight recorders and transponders.|$|E
5|$|In October 2009 <b>Air</b> <b>France</b> withdrew its interest. This led to Veolia {{looking for}} new partners, with the {{announcement}} that it would begin working on new proposals in cooperation with Trenitalia to run services from Paris to Strasbourg, London and Brussels.|$|E

5|$|On February 29, 2000, Boeing {{launched}} its next-generation twinjet program, initially called 777-X, and began issuing offers to airlines. Development was slowed by an industry downturn {{during the early}} 2000s. The first model {{to emerge from the}} program, the 777-300ER, was launched with an order for ten aircraft from <b>Air</b> <b>France,</b> along with additional commitments. On February 24, 2003, the -300ER made its first flight, and the FAA and EASA (European Aviation Safety Agency, successor to the JAA) certified the model on March 16, 2004. The first delivery to <b>Air</b> <b>France</b> took place on April 29, 2004. The -300ER, which combined the -300's added capacity with the -200ER's range, became the top-selling 777 variant in the late 2000s, benefitting as airlines replaced comparable four-engine models with twinjets for their lower operating costs.|$|E

5|$|During the 1970s, Douglas DC-8s {{were also}} taken into use. Pan American World Airways had flights to New York City from 1967 to 1973 and from 1976 to 1978. Braathens SAFE started taking {{delivery}} of Boeing 737-200s and Fokker F-28s in 1969, and these gradually took {{over most of}} the domestic routes. In 1970, <b>Air</b> <b>France</b> and Swissair started flying to Fornebu from Paris and Zurich, respectively. They were supplemented by Aeroflot's Moscow route in 1972.|$|E
