5|$|In early 2013, the Recess Gallery in New York City's SoHo {{neighbourhood}} presented We Buy White Albums, <b>an</b> <b>installation</b> {{by artist}} Rutherford Chang. The piece {{was in the}} form of a record store in which nothing but original pressings of the LP was on display. Chang created a recording in which the sounds of one hundred copies of side one of the LP were overlaid.|$|E
5|$|The 3.1 Sarge {{release was}} made in June 2005. This release updated 73% of the {{software}} and included over 9,000 new packages. A new installer with a modular design, Debian-Installer, allowed installations with RAID, XFS and LVM support, improved hardware detection, made installations easier for novice users, and was translated into almost forty languages. <b>An</b> <b>installation</b> manual and release notes were in ten and fifteen languages respectively. The efforts of Skolelinux, Debian-Med and Debian-Accessibility raised the number of packages that were educational, had a medical affiliation, and ones made for people with disabilities.|$|E
5|$|The Chapel of the Order is the Henry VII Lady Chapel in Westminster Abbey. Every four years, <b>an</b> <b>installation</b> ceremony, {{presided over}} by the Great Master, and a {{religious}} service are held in the Chapel; the Sovereign attends every alternate ceremony. The last such service was in May 2014 and was attended by the Sovereign. The Sovereign and each knight who has been installed is allotted a stall in the choir of the chapel.|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of <b>a</b> video <b>installation,</b> the method of {{presentation}} becomes critical.

5|$|Version 2002 was {{announced}} August 28, 2001. The Family Edition was dropped, so parental controls and information filtering are bundled with this release. The installation was noted as quick and simple by both PC Magazine and CNET. <b>An</b> <b>installation</b> requires a reboot, and afterwards the Security Assistant guides users through a questionnaire to best configure the settings. A problem CNET encountered when upgrading from the prior release was {{the loss of}} customized settings. PC Magazine found the default settings, aimed at avoiding frequent notifications, were somewhat permissive. Windows 95 support was also dropped.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Wong created Wandering Home, <b>an</b> <b>installation</b> {{consisting}} of a mobile home conceptualised on city living and the homeless, which was shown at the Venice Biennale of Architecture. The small tin hut {{on the back of}} a tricycle is a comment on Hong Kong society, and the plight of people who sleep on the streets and who are forced to move on periodically by government officials. Costing HK$5,000 to make, the house is not exactly a practical solution to the homeless, but the concept was tried out on street sleepers in Sham Shui Po. In 2008, Wong created Tin Man No.11, an essay in space in the form of a metallic robot that transforms into a bed. He extended the concept by creating Famiglia Grande, a series of transformable cases. In 2009, Wong attended the Subvision Festival in Hamburg as a skyscraper.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} {{memorials}} was the Tribute in Light, <b>an</b> <b>installation</b> of 88 searchlights at the footprints of the World Trade Center towers. In New York City, the World Trade Center Site Memorial Competition was held to design an appropriate memorial on the site. The winning design, Reflecting Absence, was selected in August 2006, and consists {{of a pair of}} reflecting pools in the footprints of the towers, surrounded by a list of the victims' names in an underground memorial space. The memorial was completed on September 11, 2011; a museum also opened on site on May 21, 2014.|$|E

5|$|In {{cases of}} self {{consumption}} of the solar energy, the payback time {{is calculated based on}} how much electricity is not purchased from the grid. For example, in Germany, with electricity prices of 0.25 €/kWh and insolation of 900 kWh/kW, one kWp will save €225 per year, and with <b>an</b> <b>installation</b> cost of 1700 €/KWp the system cost will be returned in less than seven years. However, in many cases, the patterns of generation and consumption do not coincide, and {{some or all of the}} energy is fed back into the grid. The electricity is sold, and at other times when energy is taken from the grid, electricity is bought. The relative costs and prices obtained affect the economics. In many markets, the price paid for sold PV electricity is significantly lower than the price of bought electricity, which incentivizes self consumption. Moreover, separate self consumption incentives have been used in e.g. Germany and Italy. Grid interaction regulation has also included limitations of grid feed-in in some regions in Germany with high amounts of installed PV capacity. By increasing self consumption, the grid feed-in can be limited without curtailment, which wastes electricity.|$|E
5|$|Tang has {{expressed}} concern about environmental and social issues through his art, such as the works They Poach the Rhino, Chop Off His Horn and Make This Drink (1989), Under the Table All Going One Direction (1992) and Tiger's Whip. He first presented the latter work, <b>an</b> <b>installation</b> and performance piece, in 1991 in Singapore's Chinatown. It consisted of ten life-sized tigers made from wire mesh covered with white linen. Tang, wearing a sleeveless white garment, dragged one of the tigers behind him. A {{modified version of the}} installation is in the Singapore Art Museum. It features a tiger with its front paws resting {{on the back of a}} rocking chair, which is draped with a piece of red cloth and with a phallus painted on it in red. The work highlights how the tiger is being hunted to extinction for its penis, which some Chinese believe has aphrodisiac qualities. In February 1995, the Museum chose Tiger's Whip to represent Singapore at the Africus International Biennale in Johannesburg, South Africa. Another of Tang's works in the Singapore Art Museum is an untitled sculpture often called Axe (1991), which is an axe with a plant growing out of its wooden handle. It is regarded as an early example of found art in Singapore.|$|E
5|$|The Order {{was without}} a {{ceremonial}} home until 1881 when arrangements {{were made to}} display banners, helms and hatchment plates (the equivalent of stall plates, {{in the absence of}} stalls) in the Great Hall, officially called St. Patrick's Hall, in Dublin Castle. On the establishment of the Irish Free State the banners of the living knights were removed. When the Hall was redecorated in 1962 it was decided that it should be hung with the banners {{of the members of the}} Order in 1922. The existing banners were repaired or new ones made; it is these banners which can be seen today. The Hall, which was renamed St Patrick's Hall from its association with the Order, also served as the Chancery of the Order. Installation ceremonies, and later investitures, were held here, often on St Patrick's Day, until they were discontinued. A banquet for the Knights was often held in the Hall on the occasion of <b>an</b> <b>installation.</b> St Patrick's Hall now serves as the location for the inauguration of the President of Ireland. If an incumbent Irish president dies in office (such as Erskine Hamilton Childers in 1974), he lies in state in the hall.|$|E
