40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{to determine whether}} or not Portuguese wheat policies have resulted in a stabilization of the wheat price and/or the stabilization of income for wheat growers in the Alentejo region. It was found that these policies have contributed to a stabilization of price rather than a stabilization of income. It was also found that the income variability caused by yield variability was greater for the Alentejo farmers than that for the country as a whole. Weather uncertainties measured by rainfall were found to be a major source of that variability in both area and yield equations. Therefore, it was concluded that rainfall is significant in explaining variations in wheat supply and cannot be eliminated from the model specification. Finally, this study looked at a policy that would stabilize output returns to Alentejo farmers since high yield variability will continue to constrain farmers' willingness to invest in wheat production. An insurance program may be the policy to implement in this region since yield risks are the predominant source of income variability. However, the cost of financing an <b>agricultural</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>scheme</b> as well as the delineation of homogeneous areas are crucial determinants to the success of an all-risk insurance program...|$|E

We {{argue that the}} aggregation of elementary crop yields is likely to produce nonnormal distributions if, contrary to the standardCLTcase,thenumberof cropacres exhibits substantial timevariation. This case is covered by limit theorems for random sums of random variables, which predict nonnormal limiting distributions. The case of substantial variation {{in the number of}} summands produces an empirical hypothesis that we test using data from U. S. aggregate state crop yields. The results provide empirical support against the applicability of the CLT. Key words: aggregate crop yield, central limit theorem, limit theorem for random sums of random variables, normality. JEL codes: C 16, C 51, Q 14. The probability distribution of crop yields has been extensively investigated over the last twenty years; however, its characterization remains an open issue. The appropriate char-acterization of this distribution is an important issue, as it affects the estimation of the rele-vant production functions on which the design and assessment of alternative agricultural and agri-environmental policies are based (e. g., the design of efficient taxes and subsidies on agri-cultural inputs and outputs, extension services that create the correct incentives for technol-ogy adoption and diffusion, land management <b>schemes,</b> crop-yield <b>insurance</b> contracts, and other <b>agricultural</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>schemes).</b> In turn, the design of these policies will affect pro-duction decisions at the farm level.

Against this background, this paper has examined the features and performance of National <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Insurance</b> <b>Scheme</b> (NAIS) operating {{in the country and}} has suggested some modifications to make it more effective. NAIS coverage in terms of crop area, number of farmers and value of agricultural output is very small. If crop insurance programme is to be made an important tool in agricultural risk management, the present level of coverage will have to be improved, at least by 3 - 4 fold. Such an expansion can occur only with improvements in and broad-basing of the insurance scheme. Every suggested improvement has financial implications and affect the concerned insurance practices. It requires renewed efforts by the government in terms of designing appropriate mechanisms and providing financial support to agricultural insurance. Providing of similar support to the private sector insurers would help in increasing the insurance coverage and improving the viability of insurance schemes over time. The study has also suggested that different general insurance companies in the country may be assigned some reasonable targets to cover agricultural insurance, and to begin with, it could be equal to the share of agriculture in the national income.

Crop insurance itself cannot increase productivity or be a source of financing, but it can playa role in enhancing both. The Comprehensive Crop Insurance Scheme (CCIS) introduced during the Vllth Five-year plan period, despite its shortcomings, farmers received nearly 6 times the premium as claims, but the coverage could not go beyond 5 % of the total farming community.

40|$|To {{insulate}} farmers against {{risks in}} agriculture, government has launched several schemes such as National <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Insurance</b> <b>Scheme</b> and weather index based crop insurance schemes. But their coverage {{seems to be}} limited among the farmers primarily {{due to lack of}} full information. This paper has reported the results of a survey of 600 farmers conducted to assess their perception about various facets of crop insurance schemes. The Probit and Tobit models have been employed to analyse the factors affecting awareness among the farmers. Crop diversification index has also been used to examine the farmers’ adjustment mechanism against risks. The survey has revealed that most farmers (65 %) are aware of risk mitigation measures of the government. But, only half of the farmers have been found aware about the crop insurance schemes/products. This implies that there is need to disseminate information about insurance schemes across the target groups. Further, {{it has been shown that}} factors such as gross cropped area, income from other than agricultural sources, presence of risk in farming, number of workers in the farm family, satisfaction with the premium rate and affordability of the insurance premium amount significantly and positively influence the adoption of insurance and premium paid by the farmers.

40|$|To {{establish}} {{a healthy and}} sustainable policy-driven <b>agricultural</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>scheme,</b> {{a discussion of the}} importance of Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) is timely in light of the challenges that governments are facing against the backdrop of increasing scale and frequency of major agro-related natural disasters across the globe. Most recently in 2008, it is reported a total of 137 natural catastrophes led to overall economic losses of USD 258 billion in the world. Moreover, as complexity and costs escalate, neither group- public nor private- can meet the challenge alone. This is particularly true for agricultural industry and rural areas in emerging economies that lack sufficient funds to deal with the increasing frequency and severity of natural disasters. Public private partnerships (PPPs), especially those involving reinsurance and capital market solutions, can improve risk management and prepare stakeholders for the consequences of uncertainties. A recent example is the agricultural reinsurance contract signed by the Beijing Municipal Government and Swiss Re. In 2007, Beijing imposed a new agricultural insurance policy for local farmers to promote the development of urban agriculture. Under the new policy, the Beijing municipal and district governments subsidized farmers up to 75 % who buy agricultural insurances for certain crops/livestock, and 50 % of management costs of the participating insurers are shouldered by governments. The municipal government also set up a protection funds for agro-related natural catastrophe events and regulated the loss ratio of 160 % as an attachment point to start up the fund.

40|$|In India, {{agriculture}} is inherently a risky venture due to uncertainty in production and volatility in price, and {{more so in}} the context of increased climatic aberrations and globalisation. Therefore, there is a great need for crop insurance to provide economic support to farmers, stabilise farm income, induce farmers to invest in agriculture, reduce indebtedness and decrease the need for relief measures in the event of crop failure. This paper assesses the performance of the National <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Insurance</b> <b>Scheme,</b> NAIS (area based crop yield insurance) and the pilot Weather Based Crop Insurance Scheme, WBCIS (area based rainfall insurance) under implementation in the state of Odisha, the climate change hot spot of India. Analysing secondary time series data on performance of these two schemes and information gathered through focussed group discussion with insurance users, the paper concludes that WBCIS seems to perform better than NAIS because of higher coverage, larger percentage of farmers benefited, lower premium, faster and more frequent compensation payment and more transparency. But WBCIS covers only weather related risk and the sum assured and the compensation amount are lower. Therefore, instead of having two schemes, a hybrid product combining the advantages of both the schemes should be offered. To increase the penetration of insurance in rural areas, insurance companies may be asked to provide priority insurance services to farmers just like priority lending to agriculture sector. The public sector may address catastrophic risk and provide multi-peril insurance where subsidy requirement is high, but allow private sector to provide insurance products for less severe events and for individual independent idiosyncratic and localized risk. In the context of climate change with increasing agricultural risk, {{there is a need to}} redesign insurance products not merely as a risk transfer mechanism but as a potent device to reduce risk and crop loss by inducing desirable proactive and reactive responses in insurance users...|$|E
40|$|The broad {{structure}} of Modified National <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Insurance</b> <b>Scheme</b> (mNAIS), the main crop insurance program in India, is technically sound and appropriate {{in the context}} of India. The NAIS is based on an indexed approach, where average crop yield of an insurance unit, or IU, (i. e., block) is the index used. The insurance is mandatory for all farmers that borrow from financial institutions, though insurance cover is also available to non-borrowers. The actual yield of the insured crop (as measured by crop cutting experiments) in the IU is compared to the threshold yield. If the former is lower than the latter, all insured farmers in the IU are eligible for the same rate of indemnity payout. Individual crop insurance will have been prohibitively expensive, or even impossible, in a country such as India with so many small and marginal farms. Further, the method of using an 'area based approach' has several other merits and, most importantly, it mitigates moral hazard and adverse selection. This report offers detailed analysis of a number of technical and operational issues which should be addressed if mNAIS is to be implemented. GOI is to be complemented on its bold vision of the future of agriculture insurance through modifying NAIS, an action which, if well implemented, has the potential for significant economic and political economy gains. The policy note World Bank (2010) supported this vision and offered specific policy recommendations for mNAIS, with reference to the Joint Group report (2004).
