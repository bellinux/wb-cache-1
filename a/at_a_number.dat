40|$|Drag and {{longitudinal}} trim at low lift of the North American YF- 100 <b>A</b> airplane <b>at</b> Mach <b>numbers</b> from 0. 76 to 1. 77 as determined from the flight {{test of a}} 0. 11 -scale rocket model are presented herein. Also included are some longitudinal stability and some qualitative pitch-damping data. The subsonic external-drag-coefficient level was about 0. 012, and the supersonic level was about 0. 043. The drag rise occurred <b>at</b> <b>a</b> Mach <b>number</b> of 0. 95. The {{longitudinal trim}} change at low lift consisted basically of a mild nose-up tendency <b>at</b> <b>a</b> Mach <b>number</b> of 0. 90. An indication of wing flutter was present at Mach numbers from 0. 95 to 1. 11. However, the full-scale airplane wing has approximately twice the scaled first-bending frequency as the model tested and, hence, will probably be free {{of this type of}} flutter. The aerodynamic-center location was 71 percent behind {{the leading edge of the}} mean aerodynamic chord <b>at</b> <b>a</b> Mach <b>number</b> of 1. 03 and 62 percent <b>at</b> <b>a</b> Mach <b>number</b> of 1. 74.

40|$|Direct {{measurements}} {{have been}} made of the drag of a special test body and its stabilizing tail surfaces throughout free drops from high altitudes. The data obtained have been used to establish the relation between the drag coefficient and the Mach number for the body and for the tail surfaces over a range of Mach numbers from 0. 85 to 1. 15. For bodies of the form tested, the drag per square foot of frontal area increased abruptly from about 3 percent of atmospheric pressure <b>at</b> <b>a</b> Mach <b>number</b> of 0. 95 to 17 percent of atmospheric pressure <b>at</b> <b>a</b> Mach <b>number</b> of 1. 00, then linearly with Mach number to 28 percent of atmospheric pressure <b>at</b> <b>a</b> Mach <b>number</b> of approximately 1. 15. Some doubt exists as to the applicability of the tail drag results to the estimation of wing drag at transonic speeds because of the possibility of appreciable interference effects between the vertical and the horizontal surfaces and between the body and the tail surfaces. Insofar as they are applicable, the tail drag results indicated that with symmetrical 6 -percent-thick area may be expected to increase abruptly from 4 percent of atmospheric pressure <b>at</b> <b>a</b> Mach <b>number</b> of 0. 88 to 36 percent of atmospheric pressure <b>at</b> <b>a</b> Mach <b>number</b> of 1. 00, then linearly with Mach number to approximately 50 percent of atmospheric pressure <b>at</b> <b>a</b> Mach <b>number</b> of 1. 15...|$|R
