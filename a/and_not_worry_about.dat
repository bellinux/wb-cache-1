25|$|Josh and Babe become close friends. On October 31, 2005, Josh tells Babe that he cannot deny it anymore: he {{is falling}} for her, {{and he wants}} her {{to be happy and}} to enjoy her life <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> JR or Jamie anymore. During this talk, they share a kiss. Babe is taken aback by Josh's declaration. Although she is flattered, she tells him she simply is not ready to be in another romantic relationship. Babe later becomes romantically {{involved}} with JR again, however, which later leads to a murder attempt made on her by JR when he has an extreme mental breakdown.|$|E
500|$|Forty-nine {{cars were}} entered for {{qualifying}}, but only 43 raced per NASCAR's qualifying procedure. Unlike most races during the season, the qualifying session only determined {{the first two}} positions, {{while the rest of}} the drivers qualified by the 2011 Gatorade Duels. Earnhardt clinched his 10th pole position during his career, with a time of 48.364seconds. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Jeff Gordon. Once the qualifying session completed, Earnhardt commented, [...] "The main thing [...] does for me is take the pressure off Thursday's race. I can go out and have fun <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> where I finish or getting a good starting spot for the Daytona 500." ...|$|E

5000|$|Wanting {{to stretch}} the limits {{as to what they}} could do artistically and musically, the band {{recorded}} some of its darkest and heaviest music to date. McGovern, Davis' boyfriend at the time, clashed with Garay in the studio, and ended up de facto producer and arranger for the album, which was titled Apocalypso. Martha Davis considers this period [...] "the last time the Motels were uninhibited, wild, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> our place on the charts." ...|$|R
5000|$|After a 2013 summer {{residency}} at the Sanskritti Foundation in New Delhi, Hill made 300 rubbings of {{the same}} 1960s Eastman Kodak slide carousel, which she mounted on the walls, partly overlapping one another. Recalling her decision to do so, Hill adds, [...] "My idea of drawing is that I could cultivate that sense of being really engaged <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> the future, or what the work means {{in terms of the}} overarching ideas, and just be deeply involved in my work." ...|$|R
500|$|Racism also shaped {{his lifelong}} {{paradigm}} {{as a team}} player. [...] "At that time", he has said, [...] "it was never acceptable that a black player was the best. That did not happen... My junior year in college, I had what I thought was {{the one of the}} best college seasons ever. We won 28 out of 29 games. We won the National Championship. I was the [...] at the Final Four. I was first team All American. I averaged over 20 points and over 20 rebounds, and I was the only guy in college blocking shots. So after the season was over, they had a Northern California banquet, and they picked another center as Player of the Year in Northern California. Well, that let me know that if I were to accept these as the final judges of my career I would die a bitter old man." [...] So he made a conscious decision, he said, to put the team first and foremost, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> individual achievements.|$|E
500|$|Meyer {{has been}} {{particularly}} well received by female Holby City fans, elevating Irving to sex-symbol status. The Dail Mail Lynda Lee-Potter described him as [...] "devastatingly attractive, brusque and autocratic" [...] and [...] "the kind of domineering, unsmiling hero who made Mills & Boon heroines swoon." [...] Irving {{felt that this was}} [...] "fairly predictable in terms of the nature of Meyer–tough and masterful–combined with the aphrodisiac of power, and the life and death aspects of his job." [...] He commented that he was surprised by the positive reaction to his character, explaining: [...] "He seems to have captured people's imaginations, but it's difficult to put your finger on what he has. I think it's got something to do with being a character who says exactly what he means all the time. He's got integrity, which I admire anyway, and I expect the audience responds to that. Surgeons seem to like him too. I find that particularly gratifying. He's got the courage to do what's right for his work and his patients <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> popularity or being liked." [...] Conversely, Irving noted that after assuming the role, members of the public would sometimes [...] "give a kind of shudder" [...] upon encountering him, associating him with his character.|$|E
500|$|After {{an almost}} four-month delay, Oblivion went gold on March 2, 2006 and was {{released}} for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 on March 21, 2006. Early rumors notwithstanding, Oblivion shipped on a single DVD-DL disc. One journalist voiced concern for the game's release date, as it was set in the same week as that of EA's [...] Hines dismissed the suggestion, saying, [...] "We {{tend to focus on}} what we can control <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> what we can't control. Given the level of interest and the number of pre-orders and so forth, we had a pretty good idea we'd be just fine no matter what else was happening that week." [...] Oblivion was the first RPG title to be released for Microsoft's Xbox 360 console. In addition to the standard release version, a Collector's Edition was released for both Windows and Xbox 360 which includes the 112-page Pocket Guide to the Empire, a bonus DVD containing concept art, renders, and an approximately 45-minute-long documentary on the making of Oblivion, and a coin replica of the in-game currency of Tamriel. Its suggested release price of US$69.99 brought back [...] "memories of game prices circa the Nintendo 64" [...] for one Kotaku commentator. Some suggested that the included coin be used to create a [...] "garish piece of jewelry".|$|E

30|$|Marketers {{are aware}} of the {{comparative}} importance of volunteer act of the nodes of a network in passing pieces of information, compared to diffusion of the messages using mass media (see Kaplan and Haenlein 2011; Pescher et al. 2014; Camarero and San José 2011). They are interested in putting out a message on the network <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> the costs of distributing it, hoping that people would take care of the job and make the process of marketing affordable (Aksoy et al. 2013).|$|R

500|$|Writer Toby Whithouse {{originally}} planned {{to write a}} different episode set in [...] "some sort of labyrinth", but after the idea had been developed for a while executive producers Steven Moffat and Piers Wenger {{thought that it was}} too similar to other episodes in the series, and asked him to write something else, while Whithouse's original idea was pushed to the next series (The God Complex). He was asked to write [...] "a big bold romantic episode" [...] which would also serve as a [...] "sort of reboot episode" [...] and a good introduction to Doctor Who. Whithouse was asked to set it [...] "anywhere in the world" [...] that was romantic, and he chose Venice, which he called [...] "one of my favourite places in the world". Whithouse believed that the vampires fit into the setting. Whithouse had a positive experience writing the episode, reflecting that [...] "writing on the show is a delight and a pleasure". As he is executive producer of Being Human, he was pleased he only had to write the episode <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> the other aspects of production. The major plot point of [...] "sinking Venice" [...] was conceived as Whithouse needed to use the identity of the location {{and it was a very}} aquatic city, and Venice was [...] "constantly fighting" [...] enemies in its history but this time it proved to be its own worst enemy.|$|E
500|$|American Pharoah's next {{race was}} the Haskell Invitational, held August 2 at Monmouth Park, New Jersey. Zayat wanted the horse's first race back be an [...] "easy" [...] race against other 3-year-olds, {{he wanted to}} race the horse in Zayat's home state of New Jersey, {{and he wanted to}} race on a Sunday to avoid a clash with the Jewish Sabbath. Zayat explained, [...] "He can run anywhere... as long as he's happy and healthy... I told ... 'I want to do it for the sport <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> the money and stuff." [...] Nonetheless, Monmouth Park raised the purse money for the race from $1 million to $1.75 million. Zayat had {{previously}} won the Haskell with Paynter in 2012, and Baffert already held the record for the most Haskell wins, having seven previous victories. Over 60,000 people showed up at Monmouth Park, which featured the Bruce Springsteen song [...] "Born to Run" [...] in the post parade. Viewed as being in even better physical condition than in the Belmont, American Pharoah took the lead in the far turn and easily opened up a five-length lead over the six other horses in the race before Espinoza eased him back as second-place finisher Keen Ice made a strong finishing push. He won the race by [...] lengths with a time of 1:47.95 for the 9-furlong distance. Espinoza quipped, [...] "He was having fun, and so was I." [...] Baffert said, [...] "He just keeps bringing it; he's a great horse." ...|$|E
500|$|Some {{media have}} been {{critical}} of the adult-oriented material created by fans. In some cases, these videos may appear in Internet searches that children may perform while looking for online copies of the program or while searching for images of characters from the show, forcing parents to have to discuss pornography and sex with their children. One parody series, drawn by animator Max Gilardi in the style of John Kricfalusi, places the characters in explicit adult situations and was described by the web site io9 as [...] "disgusting ... and most certainly NSFW". A segment on The Howard Stern Show in July 2012 weighed on the pornographic aspect of the brony fandom, often referred to as [...] "clop". Slates Amanda Marcotte opined that the transformation of the pony characters into teenage girls for the [...] feature film was a move to satisfy the adult fans who [...] "have expressed a strong interest in seeing the Ponies in sexy, humanized forms". In one case, a brony who claimed to be engaged to Twilight Sparkle wrote to a fan artist who drew the character in erotic situations, demanding that he cease such work; the letter was highlighted by several media outlets as evidence of the ridiculous nature of the fandom and the Internet as a whole. The fandom acknowledges that such material is generated by a subset of the group, but considers it [...] "an unavoidable part of any online fandom", as described by TV Guides Sadie Gennis, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> this facet. A study performed by graduate students from the University of Connecticut found that [...] "a particularly extreme subset" [...] of the brony fandom shows characteristics of hegemonic masculinity, where male members strive to keep their majority in the numbers by purposely excluding and alienating females.|$|E
5000|$|Moltzen made a slow {{recovery}} from injury, {{starting from the}} bench in first games of the 2011 season, saying it took time to get back, [...] "into the old ways, getting tackled <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> getting up <b>and,</b> you know, my leg's fallen off." [...] By round 8 he had recovered enough to make his representative debut for Country Origin, but was struggling to refind his form from before the injury. By {{the end of the}} season, Moltzen's performances were being praised, and he had replaced Wade McKinnon as starting fullback. He played in every game of the 2011 season.|$|R

2500|$|Not {{much was}} {{recorded}} about Li Heng's life as crown prince, {{although it is}} known that in 817, the imperial consultant Wei Shou (韋綬), who was an attendant to Li Heng in his studies, drew disfavor from Emperor Xianzong for providing Li Heng with expensive food and pleasing him with humor. [...] Emperor Xianzong removed Wei from his post as attendant, and soon sent him out of the capital Chang'an to serve as the prefect of Qian Prefecture (虔州, in modern Ganzhou, Jiangxi). [...] Meanwhile, the powerful eunuch Tutu Chengcui had often urged Emperor Xianzong to replace Li Heng with Li Kuan (whose name had been changed to Li Yun by this point). [...] Tutu, however, did not relent in his hopes to have Li Yun made crown prince, even by 820, when Emperor Xianzong had become seriously ill. [...] Li Heng, worried about what would happen next, requested advice from his uncle (Consort Guo's brother) Guo Zhao (郭釗), who advised him to simply serve his father with filial piety <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> the rest.|$|E
2500|$|In 219, Lü Meng {{came up with}} a plan to help Sun Quan seize {{control of}} Liu Bei's territories in Jing Province. He pretended to be sick and asked for {{permission}} to return to Jianye to seek medical treatment. Sun Quan played along by pretending to approve his request. Lu Xun went to visit Lü Meng and said, [...] "Guan Yu is near the border. How can we remain far behind the border <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> having to guard against him?" [...] Lü Meng replied, [...] "What you've said is true, but I'm seriously ill now." [...] Lu Xun then said, [...] "Guan Yu is proud of his own valour and he scorns others. He may have made great achievements, but he's overly conceited. Besides, he's heading north and he has never seen us a threat. When he knows you're sick, he'll definitely lower his defences. If we attack him when he lowers his guard, we can capture him. I came here to discuss with you a plan to attack him." [...] Lü Meng replied, [...] "Guan Yu is known for his bravery and ferocity in battle, and he's a formidable foe. Besides, he's in control of Jing Province. He governs with virtue and has made great accomplishments, while the morale of his army is at its peak. It won't be easy to defeat him." ...|$|E

50|$|Bōnenkai {{are seen}} as times for bureiko or letting one's hair down <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> the boss/employee formal {{relationship}} or the rank and age divisions. When a business decides to have a bōnenkai, they take into account several things before planning a party. Some of their concerns are to ensure that enough of the employees and management will attend. They also try to set a generalized cost {{of no more than}} 5,000 yen per person; this is used {{to cover the cost of}} the party <b>and</b> to <b>not</b> discourage employees from attending a party that is too expensive. Some companies pay the entire cost of the party and will at times opt to not have the party at a traditional izakaya (restaurant and drinking places where the majority of bōnenkai are held) and instead have it on the business premises and save a lot of money in the process.|$|R
500|$|After {{being dropped}} by Columbia, the band {{set off to}} Brazil to support All Time Low in January 2011. They {{subsequently}} began recording their fifth studio album with producer and longtime friend Ed Ackerson at his studio, Flowers Studio, in Minneapolis. The band recorded on their own time with their own resources, which both provided comfort {{and a sense of}} nervousness to the group. They did <b>not</b> sit down <b>and</b> preconceive the album as a change in style, but rather relaxed and took their time writing it. [...] "We just felt like it was like we were just taking our time and just kinda living life <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> too much other than getting together and making music," [...] remarked Taylor. Pierre has since looked back on Go with mixed emotions, citing it as his personal least favorite album by the band. He noted that he was struggling with dark thoughts and felt that the band's collective misery translated to the record.|$|R
