The U.S. Army Signal Corps inherited this network between 1870 and 1874 by an act of Congress, and expanded it to the west coast soon afterwards. At first, not <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>data</b> on the map was used {{due to a lack of}} time standardization. The United States fully adopted time zones in 1905, when Detroit finally established standard time.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-40b, {{formerly}} known as KOI-428b, is a hot Jupiter discovered in orbit around the star Kepler-40, which {{is about to become}} a red giant. The planet was first noted as a transit event by NASA's Kepler spacecraft. The Kepler team made data collected by its satellite publicly available, including data on Kepler-40; French and Swiss astronomers used the equivalent to one night of measurements on the SOPHIE échelle spectrograph to collect <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>data</b> needed to show that a planet was producing the periodic dimming of Kepler-40. The planet, Kepler-40b, is twice the mass of Jupiter and slightly larger than it in size, making it as dense as Neptune. The planet is also nearly thirteen times hotter than Jupiter and orbits five times closer to its star than Mercury is from the Sun.|$|E

25|$|Considering all {{the places}} of the field {{together}} produces the adele ring of the number field. The adele ring allows one to simultaneously track <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>data</b> available using absolute values.

25|$|Generally, {{if we have}} n data points, {{there is}} exactly one {{polynomial}} of degree at most n1 going through <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>data</b> points. The interpolation error {{is proportional to the}} distance between the data points to the power n. Furthermore, the interpolant is a polynomial and thus infinitely differentiable. So, we see that polynomial interpolation overcomes most of the problems of linear interpolation.|$|E

Vessels that sank in fair weather had suspicious cargo, sent no mayday or the crew vanished.|$|E
25|$|A {{host device}} can lock an SD card using a {{password}} {{of up to}} 16bytes, typically supplied by the user. A locked card interacts normally with the host device except that it rejects commands {{to read and write}} data. A locked card can be unlocked only by providing the same password. The host device can, after supplying the old password, specify a new password or disable locking. Without the password (typically, in the case that the user forgets the password), the host device can command the card to erase <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>data</b> on the card for future re-use (except card data under DRM), but {{there is no way to}} gain access to the existing data.|$|E
25|$|The program's developer, {{who goes}} by the online name Hephaest0s, created it in {{response}} to the circumstances of the arrest of Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht, during which U.S. federal agents were able to get access to incriminating evidence on his laptop without needing his cooperation by copying data from its flash drive after distracting him. It maintains a whitelist of devices allowed to connect to the computer's USB ports; if a device not on that whitelist connects, it can take actions ranging from merely returning to the lock screen to encrypting the hard drive, or even deleting <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>data</b> on it. However, it can also be used as part of a computer security regime to prevent the surreptitious installment of malware or spyware or the clandestine duplication of files, according to its creator.|$|E

25|$|An {{advantage}} of copy-on-write is that, when ZFS writes new data, the blocks containing the old {{data can be}} retained, allowing a snapshot version of the file system to be maintained. ZFS snapshots are consistent (they reflect the entire data as it existed at a single point in time), and can be created extremely quickly, since <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>data</b> composing the snapshot is already stored, with the entire storage pool often snapshotted several times per hour. They are also space efficient, since any unchanged data is shared among the file system and its snapshots. snapshots are inherently read-only, ensuring {{they will not be}} modified after creation, although they should not be relied on as a sole means of backup. Entire snapshots can be restored and also files and directories within snapshots.|$|E
25|$|The {{algorithm}} {{attempts to}} set up a congruence of squares modulo n (the integer to be factorized), which often leads to a factorization of n. The algorithm works in two phases: the data collection phase, where it collects information that may lead to a congruence of squares; and the data processing phase, where it puts <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>data</b> it has collected into a matrix and solves it to obtain a congruence of squares. The data collection phase can be easily parallelized to many processors, but the data processing phase requires large amounts of memory, and is difficult to parallelize efficiently over many nodes or if the processing nodes do not each have enough memory to store the whole matrix. The block Wiedemann algorithm can be used {{in the case of a}} few systems each capable of holding the matrix.|$|E
25|$|In 1951, the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) was {{planning}} on stopping funding for the ABCC's work in Japan. However, James V. Neel made an appeal and the AEC decided to fund them $20,000 a year, for three years, to continue research. In 1956, Neel and William J. Schull published their final draft of The Effect of Exposure to the Atomic Bombs on Pregnancy Termination in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This monograph gave {{a detailed description of}} <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>data</b> they had collected Despite their efforts, trust in the ABCC was declining, so the ABCC became the Radiation Effects Research Foundation (RERF), and with the new name and administrative organization, funding for the research on survivors was to be provided equally by the United States and Japan. The RERF was established on 1 April 1975. A binational organization run by both the United States and Japan, the RERF is still in operation today.|$|E

25|$|For {{the first}} time, in situ {{analysis}} of the atmosphere of another planet was performed and the data sent back to Earth; the analysis included chemical composition, temperature and pressure. The measured ratio of carbon dioxide to nitrogen of about 13 corrected the previous estimates so much (an inverse ratio was expected in some quarters) that some scientists contested the observations. The main station detected no radiation belts; relative to Earth, the measured magnetic field was 3000 times weaker, and the hydrogen corona was 1000 times less dense. No atomic oxygen was detected. <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>data</b> suggested that water, {{if it had been}} present, had leaked from the planet long before. This conclusion was unexpected considering the thick Venusian clouds. Because of the negligible humidity, the sugar lock system, employed on Venera 4 in case of a water landing, was abandoned in subsequent Venus probes.|$|E
500|$|The {{discovery}} of Kepler-40b demonstrated that smaller telescopes, such as SOPHIE, are effective when used as follow-ups to space missions like Kepler.
