40|$|The {{forests of}} BC’s central {{interior}} range from dry, lodgepole pine dominated forests, to high-elevation cold, wet spruce and sub-alpine fir forests. The forests pro-vide {{a multitude of}} resources and support a range of activities including guide-outfitting, trapping, recre-ation, and timber harvesting. Forest management in the central interior of British Columbia began {{with the promise of}} a railway passing through Prince George, and increased dramatically during the world wars and with the establishment of pulp mills in the region. Forestry in the central interior has undergone many changes in legislation and management practices which are summarized for the Prince George, Mackenzie, and Quesnel Timber Supply areas. This paper shows how Crown forest lands are partitioned for resource utiliza-tion and discusses the determination and allocation of the <b>allowable</b> <b>annual</b> <b>cut</b> in these areas. Forest land clas-sification and management practices are summarized, and current influences on the landscape, such as the mountain pine beetle, are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{mountain}} pine beetle (MPB) epidemic {{is a natural}} disturbance agent that is affecting the forest ecosystems in large portions of British Columbia. Affected ecosystems still provide {{for a variety of}} functions and services which include lumber production, clean water and habitat for plants and animals. However, the MPB is is impacting the capacity of the forest ecosystems to continue to provide for timber supply in the mid-term. In effect, the {{mountain pine}} beetle will result in significant decrease in timber supply. This decrease in timber supply will in turn have negative socio-economic effects on the forest industry and on forestry-dependent communities. As part of a project aimed at exploring opportunities to mitigate the projected decline in mid-term timber supply, analyses were undertaken in four timber supply areas (TSAs) : Williams Lake, Quesnel, Prince George and Lakes. For the Lakes TSA, these analyses forecast a mid-term harvest level of 0. 5 million cubic metres per year. The pre-mountain pine beetle timber supply projection for the mid-term (2020 to 2070) was 1. 5 million cubic metres per year and the current <b>allowable</b> <b>annual</b> <b>cut</b> is set at 2 million cubic metres per year. Mitigation opportunities explored as part of this project fall within two distinct categories: forest sector management practices and administration opportunities, and relaxation or deferral of objectives for non-timber forest values. While the technical working group solicited licensee input to evaluate potential opportunities, none other than those currently implemented (e. g. focusing harvest in pine and fertilization of young plantations under the LBIS) were identified under the forest sector management practices and administration category for the Lakes TSA. ...|$|E
40|$|Northwest Russia is {{the most}} {{important}} forest industry district producing 34 % of the merchantable wood, 32 % of the sawn wood, and 64 % of the paper in Russia in 2007. The combination of the rich and diverse forest resources, rather developed forest infrastructure, long forest industy history, and geographical location close to Western markets and the major domestic markets of St. Petersburg and Moscow increase its attractiveness both from the economic and ecological point of view. The purpose was therefore to overview the development of forest management and to describe the main tendencies of forest use, regeneration, and nature conservation for Russia in general and the Northwest in particular towards an intensive model of forest management for this area, which would cover the period from just {{after the collapse of the}} Soviet Union up to the passage of the new Forest Code in 2007. In the Northwest, forest use has been rather extensive during the period 1993 2006, on average, about 40 % of the <b>allowable</b> <b>annual</b> <b>cut,</b> which applies solely to final felling, was utlized. The actual volume of intermediate felling has been insignificant in comparison to what is needed to increase the quality of stands; in 2005 and 2006, it comprised about a tenth of the area and a third of the volume. In the area, during the period 1999 2006, almost every fifth hectare of clear felling was left without active forest regeneration measures. This development threatens the sustainability of forest management by reducing the quality of newly forming stands. The age-class structure is skewed due to this and other past forest management. More than half of the total area of coniferous forests is still composed of mature and overmature stands. These types of coniferous stands prevail in the Komi republic, and the Arkhangelsk and Murmansk regions, this is because of the economically limited accessibility and the significantly low productivity of these forest resources. Although the forests of Northwest Russia are of great economic importance, the issues of nature conservation and biodiversity in these forests are still highly recognised. In 2002, 28 % of the forested area belonged to different forest conservation categories of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) ...|$|E

40|$|Bangladesh faces two {{mangrove}} management challenges: {{the first}} is the management of the resources of the Sundarbans natural mangrove areas on a sustainable basis, while protecting the high levels of biodiversity. The second challenge is to manage the planted mangroves of the Bangladeshi shoreline under competing, and sometimes conflicting, management objectives and expectations. Management of the Sundarbans has been based on selective felling, with felling cycles and minimal DBHs adjusted for each of the main commercial species. The <b>allowable</b> <b>annual</b> <b>cut</b> is determined by ongoing forest inventories to ensure harvesting is equal or lower than the growth and reproduction rate. However, despite the adoption of sustainable yield, some degradation of the mangroves is occurring, the primary causes being human interference (e. g. illegal harvesting and pollution) and changed hydroedaphic conditions (e. g. erosion and accretion, and increased soil salinity due to water abstraction). The protection from cyclone damage afforded by the Sundarbans mangrove forests, led the Forestry Department in 1966 to commence a programme of planting mangroves outside the protective coastal embankments in order to provide greater protection for the other coastal areas. Harvestable size is reached in 15 – 25 years, but prior to harvest, a new crop must be established, so that coastal lands are not unvegetated and liable to erosion. The mangrove greenbelt has brought many obvious benefits, but despite these benefits, there are problems which are not silvicultural, but result from population pressure; illicit felling of trees and unlawful grazing of coastal lands, threaten the mangroves and the encroachment in some areas by shrimp farms comprises a major concern. The protective benefits from the sustainable management of natural and planted mangroves in Bangladesh are beyond dispute – the minimal damage suffered by the coastal areas from the Indian Ocean tsunami on 26 Dec 2004 can be ascribed simply to the good condition of the natural and planted mangrove greenbelt of that country. When viewed together with the benefits that mangrove habitats bring to biodiversity conservation, it would seem to be obvious that mangrove greenbelts should be actively promoted.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are by age class, sub-zone and site series to i) document MPB attack levels, ii) document changes in stand characteristics of pine dominated stands following MPB attack and iii) assess the potential of stand development after MPB attack without management intervention. The lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. Ex Loud. Var. latifolia Engelm.) forests of British Columbia (BC) are currently experiencing the largest mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) (MPB) outbreak observed since the arrival of European settlers (Eng et al. 2005). The BC Ministry of Forests and Range (MoFR) and licensees have been tracking the spread of the outbreak since 1995 (Rakochy 2005). It is predicted {{that by the end of}} the epidemic 80 percent of the susceptible pine will have been killed (Eng et al. 2005) and the mid term timber supply in the Prince George TSA will have fallen from a pre – MPB AAC (<b>allowable</b> <b>annual</b> <b>cut)</b> of 9. 1 million m 3 to about 6. 9 million m 3 10 years from today (Eng et al. 2005, Pousette 2006). The post MPB epidemic cut is based on several assumptions i) oldest attacked stands are harvested first, ii) only mature stands are affected with attack rates of about 80 percent in age class 5 and older and attack rates of about 50 percent in age class 4, iii) no attack in age classes 1 to 3, iv) regeneration delay of 15 years in areas not logged, and v) a shelf life of 15 years with 5 years for sawlogs (Eng et al. 2004, 2005). Also the former BC Chief Forester has suggested that between 25 to 40 percent of the MPB killed timber would not be harvested (BC Ministry of Forests 2004 a, b). Maintaining MPB attacked but stocked, older age class stands on the landscape may assist in minimizing the creation of large areas of young pine stands across the landscape. This approach may also be more effective at meeting mid term timber supply needs than starting from bare ground. An understanding of how these unlogged stands change (develop) over time is requisite for assessing the impending impacts on stand dynamics and potential mid-term timber supply. Changes will primarily be related to the MPB induce...|$|E
40|$|The biomass and {{biofuels}} {{markets have}} increased substantially {{in the last}} two decades, mainly driven by the national and European policy targets on green energy. The same positive trend is registered in particular for wood pellet markets. In comparison with other wooden biofuels (firewood or wood-chips) pellets have a number of positive aspects such as: -	regular and optimized shape; -	wide range of energetic applications (to produce thermal energy, syngas, electricity); -	high solid density resulting in the concentration of a huge amount of energy in small volume; -	high calorific value on volume bases (i. e. : energy density); -	high energetic conversion factors due to the efficiency and regularity of their burning; -	possibility to enhance the qualitative parameters of some biomasses or bio-wastes in a recycling perspective. The supply chains of wood pellets were traditionally based on residues and by-products from the lumber production industry which could be purchased at low cost locally. Even if these raw materials represent the best option, the potential of residual biomasses has now already reached its availability limit and new forms of supply are needed. The research program aims to verify the technical and economical feasibility to develop and improve alternative raw materials supply chains for wood pellet production verifying their qualitative output and environmental performances compared with traditional ones. The research will consider the forestry sector as main source of raw material, as a large amount of low quality timber is annually harvested and even bigger amounts of <b>allowable</b> <b>annual</b> <b>cut</b> (AAC) are not actually harvested both for technical or economic issues. The possibility to build a forest-wood-pellet chain is going to be studied and tested. The project is mainly focus on four pillars: 1) 	The study of the actual quality of commercial pellets in the market. Through a consistent sampling activity and the statistical elaboration of the acquired data via SIMCA modeling it is possible to build a model able to classify each sample and predict its certifiability. The model defines a critical metric distance below which a sample can be considered of certifiable quality. 2) 	The study of the achievable quality that can be technically obtained from forestry assortments. A experimental design is established for the sampling of different raw material retrievable form forest operation in the alpine region. The analysis of wood pellets, produced by the mean of a pilot pelletizing plant, give answers {{about the quality of the}} final product. 3) 	The study of the color of pellets and its relationship with quality parameters. The color of each sample from point 1) is measured through a spectrometer and image scanner and the results elaborated and statistically analyzed to find correlation between color and quality parameter of pellets. 4) 	The impact assessment of different supply and production pellet chains with the LCA methodology. Five supply and production scenarios are studied and discussed from their environmental performance point of view. Each of them is separated into elementary processes involved in the whole chain and their energetic input and emission output studied and analyzed to detect the best option possible compared with reference one. The results of this study show that there are still chances of improvement in the production potential of wood pellets by an optimal organization of the supply, not only of traditional raw materials, but also of innovative ones. Their exploitation, moreover, can find a proper position in the market of commercial pellets since the quality performance of such products is comparable with traditional ones. ...|$|E
40|$|A new {{approach}} to calculating parameters of the <b>annual</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>cut</b> for sustainable forest management in mature and over-mature exploitable forests and computer-based programs, developed on its base that allows to calculate {{the parameters of the}} <b>annual</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>cut</b> for sustainable forest management in these forests for a predetermined number of years are presented. The proposed approach is based on the simulation model of the age structure dynamics of the stand – from initial age classes of ("sapling stands ") to older ones ("mature stands"). The advantage of the proposed approach is that the procedure and the results of simulation are independent of any predefined formulas for calculating the allowable cut, thus {{it can be used to}} calculate allowable cut for exploitable forests with a variable initial age structure and intensity of forest management. Unlike currently applied formulas of the <b>annual</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>cut,</b> based on the thought model of the depletion of over-mature, mature, ripening and other stands in certain time, the simulation model enables to calculate in detail the process for all different age groups of trees. In fact, the entire age structure of the stand is reconstructed in numerical form (virtually, within the computer) for any chosen period of time. Cuttings are considered as abrupt and territorially localized changes in the stand age structure, and the model aims to compute their consequences, as well as to solve the problem of calculating the optimal allowable cut under the restrictions in a given area.

40|$|Crisis in {{supplying}} {{regions and}} the country related to available forest resources and low profitability of forest sector, as a whole, is an indicator of failure of the existing model of forest management and forest use organization in Russia at the present time. Many Russian regions, which are traditionally considered as forest industrial territories, {{face the challenge of}} lack of economically accessible forests. The forests are decreasing against a background of under exploitation of the <b>annual</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>cut.</b> This situation occurs in Siberia as well. In many cases, using calculated allowable cut will result in unsustainable harvest levels and a future decrease of accessible forest resources. Thus, the statement that «a volume of wood resource utilization is determined by allowable cut represented the scientifically grounded norm of sustainable forest use» is considered as no more than the declarative proposition. Modeling the normal forest, and using a formula of allowable cut calculation estimated for some decades based on the modeling, is totally unreliable and unreal. The long-term forecast should use analog methods, but it will hardly be sufficiently accurate and adequate to set norms. In order to estimate ecological and economic accessibility of forest resources, an algorithm was made, and a method and model were developed. This model is based on GIS-database and makes it possible to estimate accessibility of forest resources and to map it as well.

Former Boksitogorsky, Tihvinsky and Sugozersky leshoses in the Tihvin and Boksitogorsk administrative districts have been selected for analysis. There are possibilities for intensification of forest resources utilisation in the region, as <b>annual</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>cut</b> and intermediate fellings are not fully used. Actual available volume of energy wood generated by fellings in the region is 424, 000 m³ yr>. Full utilisation of <b>annual</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>cut</b> would increase volume of available energy wood up to 637, 000 m³ yr - 1 or + 50 %. If also intermediate fellings are entirely utilised, available volume of energy wood could be increased up to 774, 000 m³ yr - 1 or + 83 % to actual available volume. Productivity and costs of cut-to-lenth, tree length, full tree and tree section harvesting methods in the 1 st and 2 nd commercial thinnings and in final fellings with the transport of energy wood up to 100 km were analysed. The supply systems based on manual felling in thinnings have lower costs of energy wood compared to the supply systems which utilise harvesters. Utilisation of harvesters becomes more feasible for final felling, where high productivity allows the cut-to-length method to be more efficient compared to the full tree and tree length methods with manual felling. Costs of energy wood harvesting per energy unit are competitive with the price of electricity and light oil as primary energy sources. Wood fuels can compete with the price of heavy oil in the case of short transporting distances up to 50 km.

40|$|Increasing {{global demand}} for energy, a push by governments and {{industry}} to reduce greenhouse gases (GHG), {{and a desire}} to increase energy independence are driving the demand for renewable alternatives to fossil fuels. As a source of renewable carbon {{that can be used in}} the existing energy infrastructure, woody biomass is an attractive feedstock for the production of bioenergy (meant here to include biomassbased energy carriers in solid, gaseous and liquid forms) in the form of heat, power and liquid transportation biofuels. [ [...] . ] Under the current forest harvest regimes in Ontario, Quebec, and Atlantic Canada, a substantial volume of dead, damaged, and low-grade trees go unutilized despite being part of the <b>annual</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>cut</b> (the government-dictated maximum harvest volume) or available harvest area. Forest operators leave these materials on site because they do not meet quality requirements for lumber and/or pulp production (Barrette et al. 2015). These types of low-grade trees are often too dry or too rotten, which restricts their suitability for the conventional forest industry (Barrette et al. 2012). For example, they may have been affected by fungi, cankers, cambial necrosis, trunk fissures or foliage loss...|$|R

40|$|Planning and {{management}} of forest resources in Papua New Guinea (PNG) has sometimes resulted in overcutting, resource depletion, unintended environmental impacts and uncertainty about the long-term capacity of forests to supply the future needs of local communities or industry. Sound inventory and planning are critical for sustainable forest management. Good systems are in place in PNG to determine forest area, forest inventory and future forest growth. However, {{they have not been}} integrated effectively for strategic forest planning. This paper describes some simple tools for integrating this information to provide more robust estimates of future timber yields and more realistic levels of <b>annual</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>cut.</b> It allows for assumptions relating to available forest area and harvest intensity to be explicitly presented and assessed by those approving forest operations. The system is scalable and could be applied to smaller areas under community management, larger timber-harvesting operations or national-level analysis. The operation of the system is demonstrated through application to a case study area in Madang province. Some of the challenges, constraints and desired improvements to the system are discussed. Forest planning is not a linear or static exercise. Plans for long projects covering large areas must be periodically reviewed to incorporate new information, changing standards and changing community expectations...|$|R
40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the method of}} estimating the optimal plan for felling. The paper deals with the following objectives: to study the nature of influence of the productivity of pine tree stands on the felling age (according to the ripeness of economic forests), the calculation of the average increase {{in the value of}} wood in accordance with the current forest fees as well as the defi ning the age at which most cost-effective cutting of stands is achieved. When optimizing the size of the main use it is necessary to distin-guish two problems which, because of their relationship and influence on each other, must be addressed comprehensively: the establishment of the optimum cutting age, based on the theory of ripeness of the forest, and the determination of the <b>annual</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>cut,</b> taking into account the age structure of forests. Methods of assessing the losses from the delays in the felling may be used in the calculation of the objective functions based on this value, and to compare different options for the design of the main forest use. The indicators of growth of the pine stands: Bagi nsky normal stands, Baginsky modal stands, Zagreyev, Miroshnikov, Yurkevich and the tables of growth of economic forests have been taken as the test data...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) has {{a pivotal role}} for both the Cameroonian legal {{framework}} and market-based instruments such as forest certification. We assess the different impacts on timber harvesting of the forest legal framework {{as compared to the}} adoption of forest certification, on the ten Forest Management Unit (FMUs) that had received a Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification by mid- 2009, and discuss some differences between legal and certified timber. Results show that the average reduction in the <b>annual</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>cut</b> (AAC) of concerned FMUs is about 11 % when legal harvesting rules are adopted, about 18 % when the FSC rules as requested by the certifying bodies (CBs) are applied, and about 34 % when the ‘FSC logic of sustainable harvesting’, as agreed upon on paper by logging companies and CBs, is used. Our findings confirm that forest certification has the potential to improve weak normative frameworks that allow the unsustainable use of forests. However, they also suggest that certifying bodies tend to reduce the stringency of the FSC rules in certified FMUs if not backed by a uniform FSC standard and by a stronger legal framework. We elaborate on the reasons why that may occur and provide suggestions for improvement...|$|R
40|$|Much of Alberta's {{woodland}} caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) range outside protected areas {{is subject to}} commercial forest management. In this paper, I discuss some perspectives of the forest industry regarding caribou-related issues. Six forest companies holding Forest Management Agreements (FMAs) in Alberta were polled. Forest managers were most concerned about 2 aspects of caribou management: reductions of <b>annual</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>cut</b> (AAC) that {{may be necessary to}} provide for caribou habitat needs; and management of public access. Perceived information gaps fell into 3 categories: caribou demographics (population size, trends and densities); primary limiting factors of caribou populations (including the influence of human activity); and caribou habitat requirements (including the effects of timber harvest on caribou habitat). Increased costs associated with consideration of caribou have been incurred at the planning and operational levels. However, those costs have been low, primarily because much proposed harvest in caribou ranges has been deferred. Costs are expected to increase substantially in the future as timber from caribou ranges is required to meet harvest objectives. Other issues identified included: the desire for an adaptive management approach to caribou-forestry interactions; the need to incorporate natural-disturbance-regime models into forest planning; consideration of the cumulative effects on caribou of all industrial and recreational activities; and unmanaged harvest by First Nations people. A list of caribou-related projects conducted or supported by forest companies in Alberta during the past 5 years is provided...|$|R
40|$|Natural {{forests in}} the humid tropics differ from {{temperate}} and plantation forests in several ways: there may be many tree species; many of these may occur infrequently; {{there may be a}} large range of tree sizes and shapes present; tree ages may be unknown and indeterminate; and despite the luxuriant appearance some rainforests, growth rates may be relatively low. This has many implications for timber harvesting and yield estimation and means that most of the estimation techniques devised for even-aged single-species forests cannot be used. A timber harvest represents the culmination of many years of growth, even in "fast growing" plantations. Thus, unlike the farmer of annual crops, the forest manager must consider the distribution of the harvest over time. Several "rules-of-thumb" for estimating the <b>annual</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>cut</b> are examined, with special emphasis given to the selection of the cutting cycle, to growth and harvesting models, and to inventory and monitoring systems. Strengths and weaknesses of cutting cycle analysis are discussed, and are contrasted with the more sophisticated yield scheduling systems. Tools, techniques and information sources for estimating timber yields are reviewed. Yield calculations should make full use of existing information, including data from old surveys and casual inspections. Remote sensing and geographic information systems offer several interesting possibilities for yield estimation, particularly for sensitivity testing, but are not without limitations. A check list and extensive references are given...|$|R
40|$|This {{evaluation}} {{involved the}} compiling of all pertinent cost {{information and the}} development of a model in order to forecast the annual operating cost of a proposed integrated sawlog-pulpwood-fuelwood site on Bonavista Peninsula, Newfoundland (Department of Forest Resources and Lands, Forest Management Unit 2). It is an attempt to follow a systematic approach to cost analysis of a proposed expanded forest industry in the area which involves a centralized chip processing operation. Production and transportation parameters are specified in the series of mathematical equations which comprise the model. The influence of varying wood delivery form, product selection, and transportation mode on the annual operating cost can be examined with use of the model. [...] The aspect of long distance product delivery to market was examined for three modes of transportation: (1) marine (2 barge - 1 tug system); (2) rail ("piggy-back" method of rail shipment) and (3) road (5 -axle truck-semi-trailer combination). Within the production restraint set by the <b>annual</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>cut</b> which places a limit on maximum volume of wood processed, it was concluded that road transport was the most economical mode. [...] Potential revenue from the proposed operation is tabulated and intangible benefits expounded. This was done to view costs and benefits in perspective of one another. The operation on a purely economic basis is not feasible under existing conditions and existing markets...|$|R
