2500|$|Motorcycle {{and other}} power-sport riders benefit by wearing foam earplugs when legal {{to do so}} to avoid {{excessive}} road, engine, and wind noise, but their ability to hear music and intercom speech is actually enhanced when doing so. The ear can normally detect 1-billionth of an atmosphere of sound pressure level,Pa (...) Standard atmospheric pressure is 101,325Pa. 2 x 10−5 / 100,000 = 0.2 x 10−9, a ratio of less than a billionth. hence it is incredibly sensitive. At very high sound pressure levels, muscles in the ear tighten the tympanic membrane and {{this leads to a}} small change in the geometry of the ossicles and stirrup that results in lower transfer of force to the oval window of the inner ear (the <b>acoustic</b> <b>reflex).</b>|$|E
40|$|SummaryMoebius Sequence {{has been}} {{described}} as a pathology which involves the VI and VII cranial nerves, causing facial palsy. <b>Acoustic</b> <b>reflexes</b> are elicited by a high intensity stimulation of the stapedius and the tensor tympani muscles. The VII cranial nerve is responsible for innervating the stapedius muscle. No <b>acoustic</b> <b>reflexes</b> are expected for individuals with this Sequence. Aim: To describe immittance findings in a series of individuals with Moebius Sequence. Materials and Methods: We had 17 individuals with Moebius Sequence of both gender, with age raging from 3 to 13 years, who were submitted to otoscopy and immittance measures. Results: The results of this study indicated a Type A tympanometry in the majority of the analyzed ears, demonstrating normal function of the stapedius muscle. For the contralateral <b>acoustic</b> <b>reflexes</b> we observed it present in 50 % of the ears. The ipsilateral <b>acoustic</b> <b>reflexes</b> were absent in the majority of the ears. Conclusion: The results of the <b>acoustic</b> <b>reflexes</b> suggested that this measure could help in the prognosis of VII cranial nerve lesions, since half of the individual presented those reflexes...|$|R
40|$|A 64 {{year old}} {{woman with a}} {{predominantly}} midline pontine tegmental haemorrhage presented with bilateral total deafness.

At that time contralateral <b>acoustic</b> <b>reflexes</b> were bilaterally absent, whereas ipsilateral <b>acoustic</b> <b>reflexes</b> and waves IV and V of the {{brainstem auditory evoked potential}} were bilaterally preserved. It is proposed that this patient's hearing deficit was due to inactivation of the ventral acoustic striae decussating in the trapezoid body.

2500|$|Electroneuronography {{tests are}} {{performed}} by audiologists, {{and have been}} since their invention in the late 1970s, when they replaced <b>acoustic</b> <b>reflex</b> measurements. [...] Typically, the system calculates the difference between compound muscle action potentials generated near the nose (nasolabial fold) in response to supramaximal electrical stimulation near the ear (stylomastoid foramen). [...] Thus, the electrical stimulus travels along the facial nerve, allowing it to be specifically pinpointed. [...] Increasing sensitivity and specificity of the recordings {{has been a constant}} goal, and it is believed that variability arises from the location and pressure of the electrodes, the stimulating current, and skin resistance. [...] Esslen and Fisch placed the electrodes on the nasolabial fold, and this has become the standard, but May and Hughes experimented with electrodes placed on the nasal ala, citing better waveforms. [...] The two positions were compared with respect to supramaximal threshold, waveform shape/amplitude, and repeatability. [...] With regard to the supramaximal threshold, the nasal alae demonstrated a superior biphasic waveform while requiring less input stimulation to yield adequate results. [...] In all other categories, however, there was no statistical difference between taking measurements at the nasolabial fold compared to the nasal alae.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The {{disorder}} {{known as}} "Auditory neuropathy (AN) " {{is not new}} but has recently become more clearly defined and understood. Auditory neuropathy {{is a form of}} hearing impairment in which the cochlear function is normal but neural transmission in the auditory pathway is disordered. This condition accounts for approximately 7 % of permanent childhood hearing loss and 0. 2 - 4 % of high risk neonates. Case Reports: Four children (three boys and one girl) younger than two years with auditory neuropathy symptoms are presented. Based on audiologic and clinical findings there were high risk factors in two cases. In each case, absent auditory brainstem response (ABR), absent <b>acoustic</b> <b>reflexes,</b> present cochlear microphonics (CM) and present transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE) were shown.

40|$|From {{previous}} in vivo investigations, it {{has been}} shown that toluene can mimic the effects of cholinergic receptor antagonists and may thereby modify the response of protective <b>acoustic</b> <b>reflexes.</b> The current study aimed to define the relative effects of aromatic solvents on the middle ear and inner ear <b>acoustic</b> <b>reflexes.</b> Toward this end, the cochlear microphonic (CMP) elicited with a band noise centered at 4 kHz, and the compound action potential (CAP) elicited with 4 -kHz tone pips was measured in rats. Both potentials were recorded before, during, and after triggering the protective reflexes by a 110 -dB SPL contralateral octave band noise centered at 12. 5 kHz (12. 5 kHz-OBN). In several rats, the middle ear muscles were severed to identify the relative effects of toluene on the two reflexes.

40|$|Introduction: Hearing is the sensorial {{system that}} helps mankind in the {{acquisition}} {{and development of}} the oral language and enables their insertion into the socio-cultural environment. Objective: To characterize the hearing of children since birth until 14 years and 11 months of age, living in Itajaí. Method: Prospective study whose population was composed by inhabitants of the urban region of the city of Itajaí, SC. All individuals living in the sorted houses were included in the audiological evaluation, and the collective, commercial and non-inhabited dwellings were excluded. The children older than 4 years old were evaluated as for the acoustic meatus, audiological selection in the frequencies of 1000, 2000 and 4000 Hz, research of <b>acoustic</b> <b>reflexes</b> and tympanometry. In the children younger that 3 years and 11 months the behavioral and transient evoked otoacoustic emissions evaluations were carried out. Results: From the 119 children evaluated, the occurrence of some kind of auditory deficiency was of 16. 84 % in the children older than four years, in the analysis of the best ear. No case of incapacitating auditory deficiency was found. When we matched the behavioral evaluation results of children aged up to three years and 11 months with the results from the tympanometry of the research of ipsilateral <b>acoustic</b> <b>reflexes</b> and transient otoacoustic emissions, we confirmed the occurrence of 59. 10 % of audiological alterations, and from these there were alterations predominantly in the tympanometry and <b>acoustic</b> <b>reflexes,</b> which suggested conductive problems.

40|$|It {{is widely}} known that a {{stressed}} animal releases specific pheromones, possibly for alarming nearby conspecifics. We previ-ously investigated an alarm pheromone in male rats {{and found that}} this alarm pheromone evokes several responses, includ-ing increases in the defensive and risk assessment behaviors in a modified open-field test, and enhancement of the <b>acoustic</b> startle <b>reflex.</b> However, {{the role of the}} vomeronasal organ in these pheromone effects remains unclear. To clarify this point, vomeronasal organ-excising or sham surgeries were performed in male rats for use in 2 experimental models, after which they were exposed to alarm pheromone. We found that the vomeronasal organ-excising surgery blocked the effects of this alarm pheromone in both the modified open-field test and <b>acoustic</b> startle <b>reflex</b> test. In addition, the results of habituation/ dishabituation test and soybean agglutinin binding to the accessory olfactory bulb suggested that the vomeronasal organ-excising surgery completely ablated the vomeronasal organ while preserving the functioning of the main olfactory system. From the above results, we showed that the vomeronasal organ {{plays an important role in}} alarm pheromone effects in the modified open-field test and <b>acoustic</b> startle <b>reflex</b> test.

40|$|Objective: Moebius {{sequence}} is a pathology {{not very well}} understood regarding to the hearing status. the main goal {{of this study was}} to describe the audiologic findings in children and adolescent who carry Moebius sequence. Method: Participated in this study 17 children and adolescent, with age ranging from 3 to 13 years old. Prior to the testing, the family answered an interview. It was realized external auditory canal inspection, and the hearing testing (auditory instrumentation, pure tone audiometry, speech audiometry, immittanciometric measures, and otoacoustic emissions) on the participants. Results: the auditory instrumentation evaluation (n = 6) was present in all participants. the pure tone audiometry presented normal hearing levels in 75. 0 % of the tested ears, one ear with conductive hearing toss, two ears with sensory neural hearing toss, and one ear with mixed hearing toss. the tympanometric measures showed Type A tympanograms in 63. 0 % of the ears, Type B in 11. 1 %, Type C in 18. 5 %, and Type As in 7. 4 %. T the <b>acoustic</b> <b>reflexes</b> measure showed contralateral. <b>acoustic</b> <b>reflexes</b> present in 50. 0 % of the ears, and ipsilateral <b>acoustic</b> <b>reflexes</b> present in 34. 6 % ears. the OAE results showed presence in 73. 0 %, for the TOAE, and 76. 9 % for the DPOAE. Conclusion: These results support the idea that there is no audiologic pattern for conductive hearing loss. the majority of the participants presented hearing in the normal range. Care should be taken in drawing conclusions regarding to auditory status of the individual with Moebius sequence, but what can be said is that not always those individuals present hearing toss.

40|$|This is {{a report}} of a patient with an air-bone gap, thought 10 years ago to be a {{conductive}} hearing loss due to otosclerosis and treated with a stapedectomy. It now transpires that the patient actually had a conductive hearing gain due to superior semicircular canal dehiscence. In retrospect {{for as long as}} he could remember the patient had experienced cochlear hypersensitivity to bone-conducted sounds so that he could hear his own heart beat and joints move, as well as a tuning fork placed at his ankle. He also had vestibular hypersensitivity to air-conducted sounds with sound-induced eye movements (Tullio phenomenon), pressure-induced nystagmus and low-threshold, high-amplitude vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials. Furthermore some of his <b>acoustic</b> <b>reflexes</b> were preserved even after stapedectomy and two revisions. This case shows that if <b>acoustic</b> <b>reflexes</b> are preserved in a patient with an air-bone gap then the patient needs to be checked for sound- and pressure-induced nystagmus and needs to have vestibular-evoked myogenic potential testing. If there is sound- or pressure-induced nystagmus and if the vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials are also preserved, the problem is most likely in the floor of the middle fossa and not in the middle ear, and the patient needs a high-resolution spiral computed tomography (CT) of the temporal bones to show this. 5 page(s...|$|R

40|$|A new {{animal model}} of {{posttraumatic}} stress disorder (PTSD) is proposed in which non-habituation of the acoustic startle response is used to identify animal subjects with altered alarm responses subsequent to trauma exposure.

50|$|The <b>acoustic</b> <b>reflex</b> (also {{known as}} the stapedius reflex, middle-ear-muscles (MEM) reflex, {{attenuation}} reflex, or auditory reflex) is an involuntary muscle contraction that occurs in the middle ear in response to high-intensity sound stimuli or when the person starts to vocalize.|$|E
50|$|In {{the absence}} of a pathology, a loud sound (generally greater than 70 dB above threshold) causes the stapedius muscle to contract, {{reducing}} the admittance of the middle ear and softening the perceived loudness of the sound. If the mobility of the stapes is reduced due to otosclerosis, then stapedius muscle contraction does not significantly decrease the admittance. When <b>acoustic</b> <b>reflex</b> testing is conducted, the <b>acoustic</b> <b>reflex</b> thresholds (ART) cannot be determined when attempting to measure on the affected side. Also, a conductive pathology will attenuate the test stimuli, resulting in either elevated reflex thresholds or absent reflexes when the stimulus is presented in the affected ear and measured in the other ear.|$|E
