500|$|Stead {{finds that}} kids today {{are much less}} {{independent}} since her childhood. She wrote, [...] "rom age nine, my friends <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> the streets, walking home, going to each other's houses, going to the store. I really {{wanted to write about}} that: the independence that's a little bit scary but also a really positive thing in a lot of ways. And I'm not sure that most kids have that today". Throughout the novel, Miranda and her friends often walk around town without any adults. They are even found working in a sandwich store at lunch and walking home from school while trying to avoid the laughing man. While writing the novel, Stead hoped to show her sons the time period in which she lived, [...] "send them on a little time-travel journey of their own". Laura Miller of The New Yorker found that this lack of independence in today's youth is mainly {{due to the fact that}} kids now grow up with adults constantly watching them. Miller noted how, despite the lower crime rate in current times, the [...] "characters, middle-class middle school students, routinely walk around the Upper West Side by themselves, a rare freedom in today's city." ...|$|E

[...] said Riegel of the [...] "grueling" [...] day. [...] "It was insane, in fact. [...] <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> the set from 9 a.m. to like 7:30 at night, {{just the two of}} us." [...] Havins agreed and relayed, [...] "It was so intense to tape. It was a long, long day, a 12-hour tape day." [...] They were warned by All My Children executives that the episode would be [...] "especially" [...] demanding. [...] "I don't think they've ever handed that much material to just two actresses before, so they wanted us to be prepared," [...] said Riegel. [...] "It was the most dialogue I've ever had in my entire life. To the point where several weeks before they gave me the script, our producer, Julie , sat us down and said to us, 'This is just so important.,'" [...] added Havins. [...] "And she turned to me and said, 'We're almost nervous because it's so much material. If it's too much, let us know.' It was that dialogue-heavy." ...|$|E

Linda <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> this horse with no saddle, no reins, just the mane. If anybody fell, that camera truck is there to roll under. It was a very dodgey scene. You're galloping through gopher holes, etc. And they got the mares down at the far end. The stallion {{getting ready to go}} is smelling the mares and he's running like a bat out of hell and Linda's behind me saying, 'I'm very nervous about this horse.' And I said, 'Join the club. Just hang on and if you feel you can't do it, just don't do it. It's risky. There's no question about it, it's not a safe shot. What a horse is going to do, no one can tell.' But she was courageous, foolhardy or not, maybe me, too. She went ahead and we did it. I recall afterwards Loren Janes, my stunt man, came up and said,'You're crazy. I wouldn't have done that. It's too dangerous.' And he's probably right. I thought it was very foolish to have done it. Anyway, Linda was a gutsy little gal and she did it. So she was very pleasant to work with and very nice." ...|$|E

Not only did it change my career path, it also changed my life.

60|$|On {{the third}} morning {{after we had}} entered the fort Sergeant Corney <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> duty as sharpshooters, and, before we had been upon the walls many moments, I called his {{attention}} to what seemed like an unusual hurrying to and fro {{on the part of}} the enemy.

500|$|Massa's {{touch on}} Hamilton's car <b>on</b> lap two <b>was</b> {{labelled}} by the McLaren driver [...] "as deliberate {{as it could}} be". Massa rejected the allegation, saying [...] "I had two wheels on the gravel. I could not stop the car <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> the gravel because he pushed me into the gravel." [...] Media coverage of the incident suggested that though the contact was Massa's fault, it was unintentional. Simon Arron, writing for The Daily Telegraph, said Hamilton's accusation of deliberate contact was [...] "unworthy and unwise", adding that the contact was simply a racing incident. The gap between the drivers in the Drivers' Championship after the race stood at five points, in Hamilton's favour, with two races remaining. In the Constructors' Championship, McLaren's failure to score points, combined with Ferrari's third and seventh, moved Ferrari to a seven-point lead.|$|R

60|$|After a {{brief time}} we took leave with full and stately formality. I think both she <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> our guard against giving way before my brother, who had that grave self-restrained countenance which only Englishmen seem able to maintain. He was thin, {{and there was a}} certain {{transparency}} of skin about his cheeks and hands; but to my mind he looked better than when he left us at Paris, and I could not but trust that the hope which had returned to him would be an absolute cure for all his ill-health.
