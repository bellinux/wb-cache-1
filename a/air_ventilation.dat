5|$|By early 1997, {{after almost}} two decades of activity, the only repairs {{completed}} were phase one of the <b>air</b> <b>ventilation</b> system to dehumidify the hollow base, the drainage pipes and a new inner roof. Plans now included the erection of a temporary two-story metal building to protect all but the giant Father Time from the harsh winters and to facilitate year-round repair; the reinforcement of corroded steel interior portions; the replacement of inconsistent patches; the substitution of engineered spacing for natural cracks, and finally, hand-brushed concrete recoating. The temporary building was budgeted at $270,000; the city spent a total of $450,000 on repairs approved by the Park District that year.|$|E
5|$|At the time, the Princess was {{considered}} a showpiece of elegance and modernity. It was the first building west of Winnipeg to be faced with marble. The Edmonton Journal remarked {{on the quality of}} the “photoplay house’s” finishings, remarking on the solid marble facade, frescoes, brass mirrors and the abundance of gold leaf decoration. On the technical side, two modern projectors were housed in their own fireproof machine room. The Princess was serviced by a freight elevator, which was an unusual feature for a building of its size, and the theatre lighting was indirect and gentle on theatregoers’ eyes. The Journal was also impressed by three novel firsts for a movie theatre in Edmonton: an electric ticketing machine, an “electric time-projecting clock”, and a refrigerated drinking fountain. Perhaps most importantly, the forced <b>air</b> <b>ventilation</b> system was capable of filtering, heating, and cooling air and featured dedicated intake and output fans making the Princess by far the most comfortable theatre in Edmonton.|$|E
5|$|From 1969 until 2007, the Nassif Building {{served as}} the {{headquarters}} of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT). The building was designed to have removable interior walls to permit easy reconfiguration of the interior space. In November 1970, the federal government exercised its powers of eminent domain and seized control of the three-story basement parking garage from Nasif in order to provide inexpensive parking for DOT workers. Over the years, so many government workers complained of ailments while working in the structure that some believed it suffered from sick building syndrome. David Nassif Associates, owner of the building, disputed these claims. However, when the Department of Transportation announced it would leave the building in 2000, the owners promised a $100 million renovation that included a new <b>air</b> <b>ventilation</b> and cleaning system as an inducement for the agency to stay. The owners also unsuccessfully sued the General Services Administration in 1999 to force it to renew the federal lease on the building. The Department of Transportation completed their move out of the Nassif Building and into their new headquarters in June 2007.|$|E
5000|$|In {{many smaller}} buildings, 'forced' or 'mechanical' {{ventilation}} {{is not used}} to introduce <b>ventilation</b> <b>air.</b> Instead, natural <b>ventilation,</b> via openable windows and other openings, exhaust fans, and infiltration are used to provide <b>ventilation</b> <b>air.</b> Typically, at least one-third air change per hour is considered the minimum. ASHRAE Standard 62.2 was adopted in 2004; it clarifies the <b>ventilation</b> <b>air</b> requirements for low-rise residences. The Standard specifies that forced ventilation is required in houses with infiltration less than 0.35 ACH. [...] This is typically accomplished with heat recovery ventilation or exhaust fans running constantly or periodically.|$|R

25|$|Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a {{relatively}} easy to measure surrogate for indoor pollutants emitted by humans, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Carbon dioxide at levels that are unusually high indoors may cause occupants to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to function at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are usually 350-450 PPM whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level considered acceptable is 1000 PPM. Humans are the main indoor source of carbon dioxide in most buildings. Indoor CO2 levels are {{an indicator of the}} adequacy of outdoor <b>air</b> <b>ventilation</b> relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.|$|E

25|$|The shelters {{are made}} from {{aluminum}}, steel, and glass. <b>Air</b> <b>ventilation</b> works through fins on the aluminum part of the shelters.

Some of the connecting elevated bridge ramps have gentle slopes (with some exceptions) to accommodate the disabled. One disadvantage {{of some of the}} ramps is that passengers need to walk a relatively long way up the ramps and then double back to reach the boarding shelters. The floors of the bridge are mostly tread plates although some are made from concrete. One problem with the tread plate is that considerable noise is generated by the movement of passengers across the tread plate surfaces. Another problem {{is that some of the}} tread plate surfaces can become very slippery during the rainy season. There are no sanitary facilities in most of the shelters.|$|E

2500|$|When {{carbon dioxide}} {{concentrations}} are elevated indoors relative to outdoor concentrations, {{it is only}} an indicator that ventilation is inadequate to remove metabolic products associated with human occupancy. Plants require carbon dioxide to grow and release oxygen when they consume carbon dioxide. [...] A {{study published in the}} journal Environmental Science & Technology considered uptake rates of ketones and aldehydes by the peace lily (Spathiphyllum clevelandii) and golden pothos (Epipremnum aureum.) Akira Tani and C. Nicholas Hewitt found [...] "Longer-term fumigation results revealed that the total uptake amounts were 30−100 times as much as the amounts dissolved in the leaf, suggesting that volatile organic carbons are metabolized in the leaf and/or translocated through the petiole." [...] It is worth noting the researchers sealed the plants in Teflon bags. [...] "No VOC loss was detected from the bag when the plants were absent. However, when the plants were in the bag, the levels of aldehydes and ketones both decreased slowly but continuously, indicating removal by the plants". Studies done in sealed bags do not faithfully reproduce the conditions in the indoor environments of interest. Dynamic conditions with outdoor <b>air</b> <b>ventilation</b> and the processes related to the surfaces of the building itself and its contents as well as the occupants need to be studied.|$|E

2500|$|One way of quantitatively {{ensuring}} {{the health of}} indoor air is by the frequency of effective turnover of interior air by replacement with outside air. [...] In the UK, for example, classrooms are required to have 2.5 outdoor air changes per hour. [...] In halls, gym, dining, and physiotherapy spaces, the ventilation should be sufficient to limit carbon dioxide to 1,500 ppm. In the USA, and according to ASHRAE Standards, ventilation in classrooms {{is based on the}} amount of outdoor air per occupant plus the amount of outdoor air per unit of floor area, not air changes per hour. Since carbon dioxide indoors comes from occupants and outdoor air, the adequacy of ventilation per occupant is indicated by the concentration indoors minus the concentration outdoors. The value of 615 ppm above the outdoor concentration indicates approximately 15 cubic feet per minute of outdoor air per adult occupant doing sedentary office work where outdoor air contains 385 ppm, the current global average atmospheric CO2 concentration. In classrooms, the requirements in the ASHRAE standard 62.1, Ventilation for Acceptable Indoor Air Quality, would typically result in about 3 air changes per hour, depending on the occupant density. Of course the occupants aren't the only source of pollutants, so outdoor <b>air</b> <b>ventilation</b> may need to be higher when unusual or strong sources of pollution exist indoors. When outdoor air is polluted, then bringing in more outdoor air can actually worsen the overall quality of the indoor air and exacerbate some occupant symptoms related to outdoor air pollution. Generally, outdoor country air is better than indoor city air. Exhaust gas leakages can occur from furnace metal exhaust pipes that lead to the chimney when there are leaks in the pipe and the pipe gas flow area diameter has been reduced.|$|E
60|$|From {{the time}} of his first taking {{possession}} of Aberfilly he had kept a party of men steadily engaged in excavating a passage from the castle towards a wood a mile distant. The ground was soft and offered but few obstacles, but the tunnel throughout its whole length had to be supported by massive timbers. Wood, however, was abundant, and the passage had by this time been completed.
