5|$|In 1566, {{the capital}} city of Valletta was founded on the Sciberras Peninsula, which did not have a good water supply. Rainwater {{collected}} within the city was not enough {{to meet the needs of}} its population. Water had to be carted from springs to the city, but this became difficult by the end of the 16th century, when the city had become the largest settlement in Malta.

In 1972, Gaza's military governor dismissed the city's mayor, Rashad al-Shawa, for refusing to annex al-Shati camp to the municipality of Gaza. Since the 1970s, frequent conflicts erupted between Palestinians and the Israeli <b>authorities</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city, leading to the First Intifada in 1987.

Producers with combined market share of 90% agreed to reduce capacity, shutting down the older and inefficient plants. The producers compensated those who closed plants.

The members of what was in effect a cartel were forced to drop the quota agreement by the EU.|$|E

Nonetheless the growth of pirate radio in the 1980s was so rapid {{that at one point}} pirate radio operators outnumbered legal broadcasters. Pirate stations such as Radio Invicta, JFM, and London Weekend Radio continued to gain popularity and increasingly operated openly. Pirate radio targeted music communities ignored by mainstream broadcasting, such as reggae, hip hop, jazz, indie rock, indie pop and rhythm and blues. Stations like London Greek Radio, which broadcast to the Greek and Greek Cypriot community, also catered to ethnic minorities.|$|E
