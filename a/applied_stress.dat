5|$|Copper, silver, {{and gold}} are in group 11 of the {{periodic}} table; these three metals have one s-orbital electron {{on top of}} a filled d-electron shell and are characterized by high ductility, and electrical and thermal conductivity. The filled d-shells in these elements contribute little to interatomic interactions, which are dominated by the s-electrons through metallic bonds. Unlike metals with incomplete d-shells, metallic bonds in copper are lacking a covalent character and are relatively weak. This observation explains the low hardness and high ductility of single crystals of copper. At the macroscopic scale, introduction of extended defects to the crystal lattice, such as grain boundaries, hinders flow of the material under <b>applied</b> <b>stress,</b> thereby increasing its hardness. For this reason, copper is usually supplied in a fine-grained polycrystalline form, which has greater strength than monocrystalline forms.|$|E
25|$|Viscoelastic creep {{data can}} be {{presented}} {{in one of two}} ways. Total strain can be plotted as a function of time for a given temperature or temperatures. Below a critical value of <b>applied</b> <b>stress,</b> a material may exhibit linear viscoelasticity. Above this critical stress, the creep rate grows disproportionately faster. The second way of graphically presenting viscoelastic creep in a material is by plotting the creep modulus (constant <b>applied</b> <b>stress</b> divided by total strain at a particular time) as a function of time. Below its critical stress, the viscoelastic creep modulus is independent of stress applied. A family of curves describing strain versus time response to various <b>applied</b> <b>stress</b> may be represented by a single viscoelastic creep modulus versus time curve if the applied stresses are below the material's critical stress value.|$|E
25|$|For {{dislocation}} creep, Q = Q(self diffusion), m = 4–6, and b = 0. Therefore, dislocation creep has {{a strong}} dependence on the <b>applied</b> <b>stress</b> and the intrinsic activation energy, but no grain size dependence.|$|E

Indentation response was measured {{as a function of}} the applied biaxial stress-state for 100 nm thick Au films. An increase in measured elastic modulus with <b>applied</b> compressive <b>stress,</b> and a decrease with <b>applied</b> tensile <b>stress</b> was observed. Measurements of elastic modulus before and after <b>applying</b> <b>stress</b> were identical indicating that the observed change in response is not due to a permanent change in film properties...|$|R

25|$|Harper–Dorn creep is a climb-controlled {{dislocation}} mechanism at low {{stresses that}} has been observed in aluminum, lead, and tin systems, in addition to nonmetal systems such as ceramics and ice. It is characterized by two principal phenomena: a linear relationship between the steady-state strain rate and <b>applied</b> <b>stress</b> at a constant temperature, and an independent relationship between the steady-state strain rate and grain size for a provided temperature and <b>applied</b> <b>stress.</b> The latter observation implies that Harper–Dorn creep is controlled by dislocation movement; namely, since creep can occur by vacancy diffusion (Nabarro–Herring creep, Coble creep), grain boundary sliding, and/or dislocation movement, and since the first two mechanisms are grain-size dependent, Harper–Dorn creep must therefore be dislocation-motion dependent.|$|E

The relative intensity ratios of optical modes at low Raman shifts (IE(1 LO) /IE(2 TO) and IE+B 1 /IE(2 TO)) under different <b>applied</b> <b>stresses</b> were calculated.

25|$|A yield {{strength}} or yield stress is the material property {{defined as the}} stress at which a material begins to deform plastically whereas yield point is the point where nonlinear (elastic + plastic) deformation begins. Prior to the yield point the material will deform elastically and will return to its original shape when the <b>applied</b> <b>stress</b> is removed. Once the yield point is passed, some fraction of the deformation will be permanent and non-reversible.|$|E
25|$|Elastic {{deformation}} in solids is {{reversible change}} in the internal molecular structure of an object. Stress does not necessarily cause permanent change. As deformation occurs, internal forces oppose the applied force. If the <b>applied</b> <b>stress</b> is not too large these opposing forces may completely resist the applied force, allowing the object to assume a new equilibrium state and to return to its original shape when the force is removed. This is known as elastic deformation or elasticity.|$|E

To first order, {{there is only one}} independent piezoelectric coefficient in zincblende, called e14, coupled to shear components of the strain.

40|$|Cold {{upsetting}} {{experiments were}} carried out on sintered Fe- 0. 8 %C steel preforms in order to evaluate the technical relationship that exist between the <b>applied</b> <b>stresses</b> against continuous deformation and densification. Powder preforms of 86 % theoretical density and 0. 40 of initial aspect ratio were subjected to incremental compressive loading of 0. 04 MN under three different friction conditions such as dry, graphite and zinc stearate employed during deformation until fracture appears at free surfaces. Experimental results revealed that the response of <b>applied</b> <b>stresses</b> with induced strain and attained densification exhibits a continuous enhancement but with three different stages. Irrespective of friction conditions {{the first and third}} stage shows steep rise, which offers high resistance to deformation, whereas the second stage shows virtually steady state; deformation needed gradual increase in <b>applied</b> <b>stresses</b> but with high rate of densification. Further, preform deformed under without lubricant exhibited maximum strain hardening as well as an enhanced rate of strain hardening through out the deformation in comparison with lubricants employed conditions...|$|R
25|$|The {{volumetric}} {{activation energy}} {{indicates that the}} rate of Harper–Dorn creep is controlled by vacancy diffusion to and from dislocations, resulting in climb-controlled dislocation motion. Unlike in other creep mechanisms, the dislocation density here is constant and independent of the <b>applied</b> <b>stress.</b> Moreover, the dislocation density must be low for Harper–Dorn creep to dominate. The density has been proposed to increase as dislocations move via cross-slip from one slip-plane to another, thereby increasing the dislocation length per unit volume. Cross-slip can also result in jogs {{along the length of the}} dislocation, which, if large enough, can act as single-ended dislocation sources.|$|E
25|$|The rate of {{deformation}} is {{a function}} of the material properties, exposure time, exposure temperature and the applied structural load. Depending on the magnitude of the <b>applied</b> <b>stress</b> and its duration, the deformation may become so large that a component can no longer perform its function — for example creep of a turbine blade will cause the blade to contact the casing, resulting in the failure of the blade. Creep is usually of concern to engineers and metallurgists when evaluating components that operate under high stresses or high temperatures. Creep is a deformation mechanism that may or may not constitute a failure mode. For example, moderate creep in concrete is sometimes welcomed because it relieves tensile stresses that might otherwise lead to cracking.|$|E

The creep increases with increasing <b>applied</b> <b>stress,</b> since the <b>applied</b> <b>stress</b> tends to drive the dislocation past the barrier, and make the dislocation get into a lower energy state after bypassing the obstacle, {{which means that the}} dislocation is inclined to pass the obstacle. In other words, part of the work required to overcome the energy barrier of passing an obstacle is provided by the <b>applied</b> <b>stress</b> and the remainder by thermal energy.|$|E

2500|$|The acoustoelastic effect {{describes}} how the sound velocities (both longitudinal and shear wave velocities) of an elastic material change if subjected to an initial static stress field.

In classical linear elasticity theory small deformations of most elastic materials can be described by a linear relation between the <b>applied</b> <b>stress</b> and the resulting strain. This relationship {{is commonly known as}} the generalised Hooke's law. The linear elastic theory involves second order elastic constants (e.g. [...] and [...] ) and yields constant longitudinal and shear sound velocities in an elastic material, not affected by an <b>applied</b> <b>stress.</b> The acoustoelastic effect on the other hand include higher order expansion of the constitutive relation (non-linear elasticity theory) between the <b>applied</b> <b>stress</b> and resulting strain, which yields longitudinal and shear sound velocities dependent of the stress state of the material.
