Methods We developed a budget impact analysis checklist and scoring system for budget impact <b>analyses,</b> which we then adapted for cost-effectiveness <b>analyses,</b> based on current International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research Task Force recommendations. We applied both budget impact analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis checklists and scoring systems to examine the extent to which existing economic evaluations provide sufficient evidence about budget impact to enable decision making. We used rotavirus vaccination as an illustrative case in which low- and middle-income countries uptake has been limited despite demonstrated cost effectiveness. A systematic literature review was conducted to identify economic evaluations of rotavirus vaccine in low- and middle-income countries published between January 2000 and February 2017. We critically appraised the quality of budget impact <b>analyses,</b> and assessed the extension of cost-effectiveness <b>analyses</b> to provide useful budget impact information.

More recently, association studies using diplotypes (haplotype pairs on homologous chromosomes) have become increasingly common. This article reviews the rationale of the four types of association <b>analyses</b> and discusses the situations in which diplotype-based <b>analyses</b> are more powerful than the other types of association <b>analyses.</b> Haplotype-based association <b>analyses</b> are more powerful than allele-based association <b>analyses,</b> and diplotype-based association <b>analyses</b> are more powerful than genotype-based <b>analyses.</b> In circumstances where there are no interaction effects between markers and where the criteria for Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) are met, the larger sample size and smaller degrees of freedom of allele-based and haplotype-based association <b>analyses</b> make them more powerful than genotype-based and diplotype-based association <b>analyses,</b> respectively.

This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Subgroup <b>analyses</b> are commonly {{performed in the}} clinical trial setting {{with the purpose of}} illustrating that the treatment effect was consistent across different patient char-acteristics or identifying characteristics that should be targeted for treatment. There are statistical issues involved in performing subgroup <b>analyses,</b> however. These have been given considerable attention in the literature for <b>analyses</b> where subgroups are defined by a pre-randomization feature. Although subgroup <b>analyses</b> are often performed with sub-groups defined by a post-randomization feature—including <b>analyses</b> that estimate the treatment effect among compliers— discussion of these <b>analyses</b> has been neglected in the clinical literature. Such <b>analyses</b> pose a high risk of presenting biased descriptions of treatment effects. We summarize the chal-lenges of doing all types of subgroup <b>analyses</b> described in the literature. In particular, we emphasize issues with post-randomization subgroup <b>analyses.</b> Finally, we provide guide-lines on how to proceed across the spectrum of subgroup <b>analyses...</b>|$|R

The {{goal of the}} diploma thesis was to design a renewed manual for such <b>analyses</b> in ArcGIS tool. We have therefore referred to the existing manual (Bobnar, 2005), that we adjusted especially due to the technological changes and changes in content of the functioning of ArcGIS tool. The content is divided into a theoretical and practical part. In the first part, we present the spatial <b>analyses</b> in the geographical information systems (GIS). Firstly, the spatial <b>analyses</b> and the <b>analyses</b> of spatial data are defined, furthermore, the basic approaches to spatial <b>analyses</b> are presented. The thesis discusses in more detail the functional approach of spatial <b>analyses</b> classification. The second, practical part contains the so-called manual for spatial <b>analyses</b> in ArcGIS tool. Besides the renewed procedures for spatial <b>analyses,</b> the procedures {{in the field of}} network <b>analyses</b> in GIS environment are also added to the manual. The manual consists of ten exercises, which are performed in ArcGIS 10. 2 and later versions. This software solution offers a wide range of tools to perform the spatial <b>analyses.</b> The user learns about the tools to launch the spatial <b>analyses,</b> calculate distances, perform network <b>analyses</b> and about the raster-based data layers and tools for their compilation.
