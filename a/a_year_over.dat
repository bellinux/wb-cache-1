25|$|Many {{look to the}} Veterans Health Administration as a {{model of}} lower cost {{prescription}} drug coverage.

25|$|On value, Petty {{continued}} the debate begun by Aristotle, and chose {{to develop an}} input-based theory of value: all things ought to be valued by two natural Denominations, which is Land and Labour (p.44). Both of these would be prime sources of taxable income. Like Richard Cantillon after him, he sought to devise some equation or par between the 'mother and father' of output, land and labour, and to express value accordingly. He still included general productivity, one's 'art and industry'. He applied his theory of value to rent. The natural rent of a land was the excess of what a labourer produces on it in <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>over</b> what he ate himself and traded for necessities. It was therefore the profit above the various costs related to the factors involved in production.|$|E

It was to be built in two phases—the first phase from 126th to 34th Streets, the second phase from 34th to Whitehall Streets. The line's planned stops in Manhattan, spaced farther apart than those on existing subway lines, proved controversial; the Second Avenue line was criticized as a [...] "rich man's express, circumventing the Lower East Side with its complexes of high-rise low- and middle-income housing and slums in favor of a silk stocking route.” People protested for almost <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>over</b> the lack of stations at 72nd Street, and a stop at Lenox Hill (72nd Street) station was added in October 1970.|$|E

The office of Prime Minister was abolished in October; Mugabe became the country's first executive President two months later. Mugabe and Nkomo signed a unity accord at the same time merging ZAPU into ZANU–PF with the stated goal of a Marxist–Leninist one-party state.|$|E

His activities usually centred on the innumerable Lyons, ABC and Express Dairies teashops and their staffs of waitresses. Davidson was mesmerised, says Blythe, by [...] "the ineffable harmonies created by starched linen crackling over young breasts and black-stockinged calves in chubby conference just below the hem of the parlourmaid's frock". Many rejected his advances; a number of teashops considered him a pest and barred him. Landladies took exception to his habit of visiting their female tenants {{at all hours of}} the night. Commentators have found little evidence that he behaved indecently, or molested the girls; he bought them tea, found them rooms, listened to their problems and sometimes found them work on the stage or in domestic service.

500|$|Ash {{had only}} served as Beth Hamedrash Hagodol's rabbi {{intermittently}} during this time; during the American Civil War he had briefly {{been a successful}} manufacturer of hoopskirts, before losing his money, and returning to the rabbinate.

The more learned members of the congregation contested his scholarship. Ash resigned as rabbi in 1877, and in 1879, directors of Beth Hamedrash Hagodol proposed that a Chief Rabbi be hired for New York. A number of New York City synagogues formed the [...] "United Hebrew Orthodox Congregations", and agreed to select the Malbim (Meïr Leibush ben Jehiel Michel Weiser) for the role. The appointment was announced in Philadelphia's Jewish Record, but the Malbim never filled the position. Beth Hamedrash Hagodol re-hired Ash to fill the vacant role of congregational rabbi at a salary of $25 per month (or $300—today $—per year). The following year the congregation hired a new cantor, Simhe Samuelson, for $1,000 (today $) <b>a</b> <b>year,</b> <b>over</b> three times Ash's salary.|$|E
500|$|Coal {{has been}} mined at Bradford {{since at least}} the early 17th century, when the {{endeavour}} could be very profitable albeit with significant financial risk. Thomas Charnock is recorded as having invested £300 in his Bradford Colliery during the reign of King James I (1603–1624) (equivalent to more than £500,000 as of 2009, At about that time the seams at Bradford were producing about 10,000 long tons (11,200 short tons) of coal a year, and probably an average of 20,000–30,000 long tons (22,400–33,600 short tons) <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>over</b> the course of the 17th century.
