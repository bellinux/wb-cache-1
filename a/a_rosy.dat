25|$|That the Drillers {{inflated}} their announced attendance {{came as no}} surprise, as it is {{a common}} practice in pro sports, but part way through the season {{the degree to which the}} Drillers did became public and the numbers did not paint <b>a</b> <b>rosy</b> picture. It was exposed that while the club was announcing attendance in the 5,800 range, when the actual was only ~4,200. Coupled with even the announced figures falling far short of the previously stated 8,000 break even point, there were questions abound about how long Wojcicki could continue bankrolling the team.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers {{were more}} {{critical}} concerning the game's sound. Although {{the quality of}} the musical compositions was praised, both RPGFan and RPGamer found that there were too few adequately long tracks, with mediocre ambient sound effects to fill the dead time, and Scary Larry complained of the player character's dog [...] "constantly" [...] barking. Super Play and GamePro both found that the game was not up to the standards held by other Square games. Others argued that Secret of Evermore was a decent first attempt by the American team. Game Players anticipated another game from the same development team, and a critic for Next Generation said that while the game suffered from a number of amateur mistakes, [...] "as a debut title for a new team of designers, it points to <b>a</b> <b>rosy</b> future".|$|E

The “sober reality” was twelve to fourteen hours of dreary, exhausting work, which many workers experienced as hostile to intellectual development.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{results of}} {{comparative}} surveys have demonstrated great differences of perceived life quality. Yet there is doubt whether these differences mean {{that people are}} really more satisfied in one country than in another. It is generally believed that the responses are distorted by actors such as language, familiarity with concepts like satisfaction, and social desirability pressures. Though often alleged. the truth of these charges {{has not yet been}} demonstrated empirically. Ostroot & Snyder (1985) now claim to have demonstrated that about 40 % of the difference in satisfaction between the French and Americans is due to 'cultural bias'. in particular to <b>a</b> <b>rosier</b> outlook of the latter. Yet their arguments labor under two defects: firstly, their use of the word 'bias' is misleading. They do not demonstrate any discrepancy between avowed satisfaction and 'true' satisfaction. Speaking of a 'cultural effect' would be more appropriate. Secondly, Ostroot & Snyder do not demonstrate that the greater satisfaction of Americans is due to <b>a</b> <b>rosier</b> outlook on their part. The data did not allow the conclusion that Americans hold <b>a</b> <b>rosier</b> view than the French, nor that such a view is responsible for their greater satisfactio...|$|R

The Maverick was available molded in at least five colors: medium green, dusty rose (kind of <b>a</b> <b>rosy</b> gray), butterscotch, light blue, and red. The Maverick was often available in magazines like National Geographic offered for free or limited cost just by cutting out, completing and mailing in the ad.

In response to criticism that only well-to-do Cuban citizens receive a decent standard of health care, Michael Moore adduced on his website the result of an independent Gallup Poll in which [...] "a near unanimous 96 percent of respondents say that health care in Cuba is accessible to everyone".
