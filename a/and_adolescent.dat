The practical part is based on my personal experience with the artistic creations of children <b>and</b> <b>adolescents</b> with somatic diseases admitted to the paediatric department. Artistic works with children <b>and</b> <b>adolescents</b> in the hospital became an incentive for asking these questions: What are the common features of the artistic expressions among children <b>and</b> <b>adolescents</b> with long-term chronic diseases?

The organization of an internal working model is generally seen as leading to more stable attachments in those who develop such a model, rather than those who rely more on the individual's state of mind alone in forming new attachments.|$|E

5|$|The sand whiting is an inshore species, inhabiting exposed {{coastal areas}} such as beaches, sandbars and surf zones as well as quieter bays, {{estuaries}} and coastal lakes. Sand whiting enter estuaries, including intermittently open ones, and penetrate far upstream to the tidal limits of rivers and creeks where juveniles <b>and</b> <b>adolescent</b> fish may be abundant. The adults congregate around the mouths of estuaries, bars, and spits, in depths down to 5 m where they may constitute {{a large percentage of}} the icthyofauna of such regions.

5|$|According to the American Academy of Child <b>and</b> <b>Adolescent</b> Psychiatry (AACAP), {{children}} who exhibit signs of reactive attachment disorder need a comprehensive psychiatric assessment and individualized treatment plan. The signs or symptoms of RAD {{may also be}} found in other psychiatric disorders and AACAP advises against giving a child this label or diagnosis without a comprehensive evaluation. Their practice parameter states that the assessment of reactive attachment disorder requires evidence directly obtained from serial observations of the child interacting with his or her primary caregivers and history (as available) of the child’s patterns of attachment behavior with these caregivers. It also requires observations of the child’s behavior with unfamiliar adults and a comprehensive history of the child’s early caregiving environment including, for example, pediatricians, teachers, or caseworkers. In the US, initial evaluations may be conducted by psychologists, psychiatrists, Licensed Marriage and Family Therapists, Licensed Professional Counselors, specialist Licensed Clinical Social Workers or psychiatric nurses.|$|E
5|$|MIT's {{inability}} {{to secure a}} more stable financial footing during this era can largely {{be attributed to the}} existence of the Lawrence Scientific School at Harvard. Given the choice between funding technological research at the oldest university in the nation, or at an independent <b>and</b> <b>adolescent</b> institution, potential benefactors were indifferent or even hostile to funding MIT's competing mission. Earlier overtures from Harvard President Charles William Eliot towards consolidation of the two schools were rejected or disrupted by Rogers in 1870 and 1878. Despite his tenure at the analogous Sheffield School of Yale University, Walker remained committed to MIT's independence from a larger institution. Walker also repeatedly received overtures from Leland Stanford to become the first president of his new university in Palo Alto, California, but Walker remained committed to MIT owing to his Boston upbringing.|$|E
40|$|In the {{theoretical}} part participation {{is defined as}} a process in which children <b>and</b> <b>adolescents</b> express their views on matters of their concern. It is the need and the right of children <b>and</b> <b>adolescents.</b> Through participation in the family, friends, school, local and social environment, children <b>and</b> <b>adolescents</b> develop into active citizens. In {{spite of the fact that}} participation has a positive effect on both children <b>and</b> <b>adolescents,</b> as well as on the society in which they live, there are barriers in individuals or in the society, which prevent them from active participation of children and youth in decision-making. Empirical part is based on a study, which included 293 children from eighteen different elementary schools in Slovenia <b>and</b> 101 <b>adolescents</b> from nine different secondary schools in Slovenia. I was interested in how do children <b>and</b> <b>adolescents</b> know the right to participation and the extent to which they practice it in everyday life. I acquired the data by questionnaire. Results confirm two of the nine hypotheses and one partially. Through analysis of the answers I have found that children <b>and</b> <b>adolescents</b> have a very poor knowledge of children's rights and that on average children know more than <b>adolescents,</b> <b>and</b> the right to participation is known to both groups the same. In defining the right to participation children <b>and</b> <b>adolescents</b> have the same definitions, the most common is the "right to expression of opinion". The study did not demonstrate differences among children <b>and</b> <b>adolescents</b> in understanding behaviours that define (not) participation. Among all the social environments children <b>and</b> <b>adolescents</b> most commonly participate within the family environment, in the local environment, however, the differences in participation is shown only in carrying out voluntary work as fireman. In environment with friends children more often begin to resolve some of the problems independently, and in other environments we have not demonstrated differences between children <b>and</b> <b>adolescents</b> in solving problems independently. Surprising, however, is the fact that children <b>and</b> <b>adolescents</b> are least frequently involved in solving the problems in the school environment. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the requirements of}} children <b>and</b> <b>adolescents</b> with severe spinal cord injuries. The requirements are expressed by {{the parents of the}} children <b>and</b> by <b>adolescents</b> <b>and</b> are in contrast to official views of their 'needs'. There is no literature on the needs of these children <b>and</b> <b>adolescents.</b> The thesis thus begins with a examination of the literature on the needs of people with disabilities and people with spinal cord injury. Proponents of the social model of disability, which is based on the experiences of people with disabilities, contend that the main requirements of people with disabilities is ending their social marginalisation, and it is hypothesised that the requirements of the children <b>and</b> <b>adolescents</b> will be related to ending social marginalisation. Open-ended unstructured interviews with parents, parents <b>and</b> <b>adolescents</b> <b>and</b> <b>adolescents</b> alone (a total of 20 interviews) provided data for analysis. Analysis of the data shows that the requirements of the children <b>and</b> <b>adolescents,</b> like adults with spinal cord injuries, differ from those of people with disabilities in that there are important concerns in addition to marginalisation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background: Obesity affects ethnic {{minority}} groups disproportionately, especially in the pediatric population. However, {{little is known about}} the impact of obesity on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in children <b>and</b> <b>adolescents</b> from mixed-ethnic samples. The purpose of this study was to: 1) measure HRQoL in a mixed-ethnic clinical sample of obese children <b>and</b> <b>adolescents,</b> 2) compare HRQoL assessments in obese participants and healthy controls, and 3) compare HRQoL in obese children <b>and</b> <b>adolescents</b> according to their pubertal status. Methods: A clinical sample of children <b>and</b> <b>adolescents</b> with obesity (n = 96) and healthy children <b>and</b> <b>adolescents</b> attending local schools (n = 444) completed the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL; UK version 4). Age-appropriate versions were self-administered by children <b>and</b> <b>adolescents</b> aged 8 - 18 years, and interview administered to children aged 5 - 7 years. Multiple regression analyses controlling for age, gender, pubertal status, and ethnicity were used to compare the PedsQL scores of the two samples. Results: The clinical sample of obese children <b>and</b> <b>adolescents</b> had poorer HRQoL scores on all dimensions of the PedsQL compared to the healthy controls (p < 0. 005). Subsequent analyses also demonstrated that in this sample of mixed-ethnic children <b>and</b> <b>adolescents,</b> prepubescent obese children achieved the poorest scores in the emotional functioning dimension. Conclusions: Obesity significantly impacts on physical, emotional, social and school functioning of mixed-ethnic children <b>and</b> <b>adolescents.</b> Clinicians need to be aware of the significant impact of obesity on all aspects of functioning. More effort is required to target interventions to improve the quality of life of children with obesity. ...|$|R
