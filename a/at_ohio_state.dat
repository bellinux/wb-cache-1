5|$|Adamle's {{decision}} {{to drop out}} was controversial because of rules that under normal circumstances would have barred him from playing professionally before graduating.

The Browns denied that they encouraged Adamle to drop out. Adamle may have been convinced to join the Browns by Gene Fekete, Dante Lavelli, Lou Groza and Bill Willis, four Browns players who were back <b>at</b> <b>Ohio</b> <b>State</b> to finish their studies after the 1946 season.|$|E

Brown was fourth in balloting for national Coach of the Year.|$|E
