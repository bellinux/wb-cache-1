5|$|A {{new edition}} was planned {{beginning}} in 1914 by Walther von Dyck (1856–1934). Dyck compiled copies of Kepler's unedited manuscripts, using international diplomatic contacts {{to convince the}} Soviet <b>authorities</b> <b>to</b> lend him the manuscripts kept in Leningrad for photographic reproduction. These manuscripts contained several works by Kepler {{that had not been}} available to Frisch. Dyck's photographs remain the basis for the modern editions of Kepler's unpublished manuscripts.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{had left}} Canton, Simão de Andrade landed at Xiamen and Ningbo, {{establishing}} settlements there. Simão continued to defy local Chinese laws at Ningbo, and when his men were cheated on a trade deal with a Chinese man in 1545, Simão sent a band of armed men into the town, pillaged it, and took local women and young girls as their captives. The outraged locals banded together and slaughtered the Portuguese under Simão. A similar episode occurred later when Coelho de Sousa seized {{the house of a}} wealthy foreign resident in Jinzhou of Fujian, which led <b>authorities</b> <b>to</b> cut off supplies to the Portuguese; the Portuguese then attacked and ransacked a nearby village for supplies, which prompted Chinese <b>authorities</b> <b>to</b> destroy thirteen of their ships while thirty Portuguese survivors of this settlement fled to the Portuguese settlement at Macau in 1549.|$|E
5|$|Although {{many species}} have been named, modern paleontologists {{recognize}} only one, T. bataar, as valid. Some experts see this species as an Asian representative of the North American genus Tyrannosaurus; this would make the genus Tarbosaurus redundant. Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus, if not synonymous, {{are considered to be}} at least closely related genera. Alioramus, also from Mongolia, is thought by some <b>authorities</b> <b>to</b> be the closest relative of Tarbosaurus.|$|E

5|$|Although their {{suspected}} {{white supremacist}} affiliations led federal <b>authorities</b> <b>to</b> investigate possible ties {{to a larger}} group, authorities later downplayed the trio as drug addicts who had little chance of actually carrying out the plot.

5|$|As a result, the {{memorial}} stone became {{the memorial}} itself. The monument was later {{moved by the}} <b>authorities</b> <b>to</b> {{make way for the}} gentrification of the Fullerton Building, and was relocated to the National Archives of Singapore, where it stands almost forgotten today. The authorities hope that when Singapore's community of values had evolved to the point that a common language of art could be used to complete the task of building such a monument again.|$|E
5|$|At 9:00pm three Guards regiments {{arrived on}} the scene. Although the troops {{assisted}} in crowd control, their arrival was also a reaction of the <b>authorities</b> <b>to</b> fears of a possible insurrection, for which the destruction of parliament could have signalled the first step. The three European revolutions of 1830—the French, Belgian and Polish actions—were still of concern, as were the unrest from the Captain Swing riots, and the recent passing of the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, which altered the relief provided by the workhouse system.|$|E

5|$|Few zoos hold termites, {{due to the}} {{difficulty}} in keeping them captive and to the reluctance of <b>authorities</b> <b>to</b> permit potential pests. One of the few that do, the Zoo Basel in Switzerland, has two thriving Macrotermes bellicosus populations– resulting in an event very rare in captivity: the mass migrations of young flying termites. This happened in September 2008, when thousands of male termites left their mound each night, died, and covered the floors and water pits of the house holding their exhibit.|$|E

The supplies, consisting of medical supplies, tents, and one tonne of rice, {{were given to}} local <b>authorities</b> <b>to</b> be distributed to the affected population.

Aqil and his men accomplished the task successfully.|$|E

Stanford was determined to end the practice, and after six years he persuaded the university <b>authorities</b> <b>to</b> agree. Three years' study at the university became a prerequisite for sitting the bachelor of music examinations.|$|E
5|$|In 1888, Cantor {{published}} his correspondence with several philosophers on the philosophical implications of his set theory. In an extensive attempt to persuade other Christian thinkers and <b>authorities</b> <b>to</b> adopt his views, Cantor had corresponded with Christian philosophers such as Tilman Pesch and Joseph Hontheim, {{as well as}} theologians such as Cardinal Johannes Franzelin, who once replied by equating the theory of transfinite numbers with pantheism. Cantor even sent one letter directly to Pope Leo XIII himself, and addressed several pamphlets to him.|$|E
