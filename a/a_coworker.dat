5|$|In Waters v. Churchill (1994), the Court {{was faced}} with two differing {{accounts}} of the speech at issue. The question presented to the Court was whether the Connick test ought be applied to what the employer thought was said or what was actually said. The case revolved around a nurse dismissed for a conversation she had with <b>a</b> <b>coworker.</b> There was a discrepancy between what she argued was said and what her employer thought was said. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, joined by a plurality of justices, opined that the Connick test must {{be applied to the}} speech the employer thought occurred, and on which it acted, rather than that which the finder of fact determines did occur.|$|E
5|$|Keith (Enrico Colantoni) is {{visited by}} Mindy O’Dell (Jamie Ray Newman), who {{tells him to}} {{investigate}} Dean O’Dell’s (Ed Begley, Jr.) death.

The researchers believe that a PETA-like organization, named PHAT, is responsible. At the PHAT meeting, Mac flirts with the group leader, Bronson, {{but there is no}} reason to think that they’re guilty. Weevil invites Keith to investigate Dean O’Dell’s office, and he finds a 40-year-old bottle of scotch unopened.

Back at the lab, Veronica notices <b>a</b> <b>coworker</b> being mean to the monkey researchers. After a slight hazing ritual, Veronica and Mac are accepted into the group. In order to impress the leader of the group, Veronica, Mac, and Parker (Julie Gonzalo) participate in a party.|$|E
5|$|In May 2009, Chris Hemsworth was in {{negotiations}} {{to portray the}} title role after a back-and-forth {{process in which the}} 25-year-old actor was refused early on, then given a second chance to read for the part. Hemsworth's brother, Liam also auditioned for the role, but was passed on by Marvel Studios head Kevin Feige. The next day, Marvel announced that Tom Hiddleston, who had worked with Branagh before and had initially been considered to portray the lead role, had been cast as Loki. In June 2009, Feige confirmed that both Hemsworth and Hiddleston had signed on. Feige mentioned that the film would take place on both modern day Earth and Asgard but Thor's human host, Dr. Donald Blake, would not be included. In July 2009, Marvel announced that Natalie Portman would portray Jane Foster. Jaimie Alexander and Colm Feore were reported to have joined the cast in September, with Alexander portraying Sif and Feore's role unrevealed, though it was thought to be a villain. In an interview with Swedish news site Ystads Allehanda, Stellan Skarsgård stated that he had joined the cast, though he did not specify his role. By late October Anthony Hopkins had been cast as Odin in the film. The following month, Marvel announced that they had cast the Warriors Three; Fandral was to be played by Stuart Townsend, Hogun was to be played by Tadanobu Asano and Volstagg was to be played by Ray Stevenson. Idris Elba was announced to have joined the cast, portraying Heimdall.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the study}} was to examine the {{relationship}} between role stress, emotional exhaustion, and <b>a</b> supportive <b>coworker</b> climate among health care workers, by adopting a multilevel perspective. Methods: Aggregated data of 738 health care workers nested within 67 teams of two Italian hospitals were collected. Multilevel regression analysis with a random intercept model was used. Results: Hierarchical linear modeling showed that a lack of role clarity was significantly linked to emotional exhaustion at the individual level. At the unit level, the cross-level interaction revealed that <b>a</b> supportive <b>coworker</b> climate moderated the relationship between lack of role clarity and emotional exhaustion. Conclusion: This study supports previous results of single-level burnout studies, extending the existing literature with evidence on the multidimensional and cross-level interaction associations of <b>a</b> supportive <b>coworker</b> climate as <b>a</b> key aspect of job resources on burnout...|$|R

40|$|Click on the DOI link {{below to}} access the article (may not be free). Drawing on the {{labeling}} perspective of deviance, we investigate employee reactions to coworkers perceived as deviants. We look at two positive effects for employees {{in the presence of}} <b>a</b> deviant <b>coworker.</b> First, in comparison to a deviant individual, other employees can draw more positive conclusions about themselves; and second, a deviant can be informative about organizational norms, thereby improving employee role clarity. We also examine individual and situational moderators. For the purpose of the study, we developed a measure of the presence of a deviant. The hypothesized relationships were tested in two large samples using multiple regression analyses. The results revealed that in the presence of <b>a</b> deviant <b>coworker,</b> employees reported enhanced self-evaluation. The presence of <b>a</b> deviant <b>coworker</b> was associated with better role clarity only for employees with more interdependent jobs. We also discuss practical implications of the findings and future research directions. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|According {{to balance}} theory (Heider, 1958), when 2 {{coworkers}} develop {{different levels of}} leader-member exchange (LMX) relationships with their supervisor, a triadic relational imbalance will arise among the 3 parties that may result in hostile sentiments and poor social interactions between them. This study examines the consequences and psychological processes of (dis) similar levels of LMX on the interpersonal interactions between coworkers. Using data from 2 independent studies, the results of social relations analyses show that (a) actual (dis) similarity in LMX between <b>Coworkers</b> <b>A</b> and B increases <b>Coworker</b> <b>A's</b> feelings of contempt for Coworker B and decreases <b>Coworker</b> <b>A's</b> perception of help received from Coworker B (Study 1); (b) <b>Coworker</b> <b>A</b> {{is more likely to}} experience contempt for Coworker B when <b>Coworker</b> <b>A</b> perceives that he/she has a higher or lower level of LMX compared to Coworker B than when <b>Coworker</b> <b>A</b> perceives that his/her level of LMX is similar to Coworker B's (Study 2); and (c) these relationships only hold true for employees with a high social comparison orientation (SCO) in both Studies 1 and 2. Particularly, in Study 1, we also show that contempt is a crucial mediator that transmits the interactive effect of LMX (dis) similarity and SCO on perceptions of help received from <b>coworkers.</b> Furthermore, <b>an</b> average level of perceived help from coworkers is positively related to the sales performance of individual employees.

25|$|From 1928 to 1932, the Hungarian {{research}} team of Albert Szent-Györgyi and Joseph L. Svirbely, {{as well as}} the American team led by Charles Glen King in Pittsburgh, first identified the anti-scorbutic factor. Szent-Györgyi had isolated the chemical hexuronic acid (actually, L-hexuronic acid, although he did not know the stereochemistry at that time) from animal adrenal glands at the Mayo clinic, and suspected it to be the antiscorbutic factor, but could not prove this without a biological assay. At the same time, for five years King's laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh had been trying to isolate the antiscorbutic factor in lemon juice using the original 1907 model of scorbutic guinea pigs which developed scurvy when not fed fresh foods, but were cured by lemon juice.

One day, <b>a</b> <b>coworker</b> steals a letter about Cosette from Fantine, revealing to the other workers that Fantine has a child.

Desperate for money, she sells her locket and hair, finally becoming a prostitute ("Lovely Ladies"). When she fights back against an abusive customer, Bamatabois, Javert, now a police inspector stationed in Montreuil-sur-Mer, arrives to arrest her. But Valjean, passing by the scene, pities Fantine, and when he realizes she once worked for him and that she blames him for her misfortune, he is guilt-stricken.
