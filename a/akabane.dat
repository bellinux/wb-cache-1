Two subwriters were Haha Kikuchi, {{who worked on the}} {{scenarios}} of Nier and Drakengard 3, and Yoshiho <b>Akabane</b> of external company Highestar. The team defined the game's central theme as [...] "", a Japanese word meaning to struggle out of a bad situation. Another theme Saito pointed out was [...] "love", which he stated was unusual given that all the central cast were robots, which were not normally associated with emotions. According to Saito, {{a lot of time and}} effort went into creating the story and character interactions so they would match up to the original Nier. When creating the story, Yoko was hesitant about adding Devola and Popola to the story due to their integral role in the original game, but eventually decided to feature them. According to Yoko, while the scenario of Nier was [...] "wet" [...] in its emotional content, for Nier: Automata he aimed for a [...] "dry" [...] narrative concerning the world's inherent unfairness and the prejudices the characters are forced to confront. A recurring element from Yoko's earlier work was his examination of why people kill, and the impact of killing on others—this stems from his observation of people coming to enjoy killing enemies encountered in games, which suggested to him that something was wrong or missing inside them.|$|E
