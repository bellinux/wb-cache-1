There are also Christian, Sikh, Jain, Buddhist and Parsi communities and iconic temples, mosques and churches can be seen. According to the 2011 census, the religious make-up of Greater Hyderabad was: Hindus (64.93%), Muslims (30.13%), Christians (2.75%), Jains (0.29%), Sikhs (0.25%) and Buddhists (0.04%); 1.56% did not state any religion.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the Second World War, many shophouses, usually {{two stories}} with {{functional}} shops {{on the ground}} floor and separate residential spaces upstairs, were built <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> city centre. These shop-houses drew inspiration from Straits Chinese and European traditions. Some of these shophouses have made way for new developments but there are still many standing today around Medan Pasar (Old Market Square), Chinatown, Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman, Jalan Doraisamy, Bukit Bintang and Tengkat Tong Shin areas.|$|E

5|$|There is {{a single}} rail link to the Rhondda, the Rhondda Line, based <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> Taff Vale Railway which {{serviced}} both the Rhondda Fach and Rhondda Fawr. The Rhondda Line runs through the Rhondda Fawr, linking Rhondda to Cardiff Central. The railway stations that once populated the Rhondda Fach were all closed after the Beeching Axe. The railway line serves ten Rhondda stations with the villages not directly linked connected through bus services.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, the area <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> City walls was barren and undeveloped. It was only notable for the {{junction}} of paths that would become Jaffa Road and the highway to Jaffa, with the road to Hebron outside the Jaffa Gate. Among its first structures was the Hospice Saint Vincent de Paul, part of the emerging French Compound. The early building developed {{as an extension of}} the adjacent souk along the city walls at the Jaffa Gate as a quarter for merchants and artisans. It became home for commerce and residences that could not find room within the overcrowded Old City, and several of Jerusalem's prominent modern businesses, like Hotel Fast, were first built here. In 1908, the Ottoman authorities erected a clock tower above Jaffa Gate. The British removed it a decade later.|$|E
5|$|Industry {{appeared}} {{very early}} in Sélestat. The town had already several factories {{at the beginning of}} the 19th century: a tilery, a sawmill, 12 tanneries and 11 mills. Sélestat quickly became specialised in wire gauze making but it never became a large industrial centre, remaining a small town with limited influence. The completion of the Strasbourg-Basel railway (1840), one of the first to be built in France, did not lead to significant urban development. The town walls that still encircled the town were a significant factor in its economic and demographic stagnation. After the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, Alsace and a part of Lorraine were annexed by the new German Empire. The German authorities demolished the city walls in 1874 and built new spacious neighbourhoods <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> town, as they did in Strasbourg and Metz.|$|E
25|$|The {{first line}} of walls are {{reinforced}} by cylindrical towers and interrupted by vertical openings. The castle's bastions, completed in the 18th century, are distributed <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>older</b> part of <b>the</b> settlement of Abrantes.|$|R

5|$|Some of the city's {{earliest}} still-standing buildings {{date back}} to the late 16th and early 17th centuries. Although most are clustered <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Montreal area, such as the Sulpician Seminary adjacent to Notre Dame Basilica that dates back to 1687, and Château Ramezay, which was built in 1705, examples of early colonial architecture are dotted throughout the city. Situated in Lachine, the Le Ber-Le Moyne House is the oldest complete building in the city. In Point St. Charles visitors can see the Maison Saint-Gabriel, which can trace its history back to 1698. There are many historic buildings in Old Montreal in their original form: Notre Dame of Montreal Basilica, Bonsecours Market, and the 19th‑century headquarters of all major Canadian banks on St. James Street (French: Rue Saint Jacques). Montreal's earliest buildings are characterized by their uniquely French influence and grey stone construction.|$|E
5|$|With {{sites such}} as Danebury {{where there is no}} modern {{habitation}} or built environment, extensive excavations can be undertaken to establish the general layout. The modern settlement of Mellor extends over the Iron Age hill fort, which restricts archaeological investigation. A geophysical survey was performed to establish the extent of the settlement; methods such as magnetometry and ground-penetrating radar were successful in identifying the eastern and northern sections of the ditch encircling the site. Excavations have been concentrated <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Vicarage. By 2004 there were 43trenches, 14trial trenches, and 17test pits. The investigation of the site has revealed two ditches. While the external ditch encloses a larger area, it has smaller dimensions than the internal ditch.|$|E
5|$|In 1782, William Hornby {{assumed the}} office of Governor of Bombay, and {{initiated}} the Hornby Vellard engineering project of uniting the seven islands into a single landmass. The purpose of this project was to block the Worli creek and prevent the low-lying areas of Bombay from being flooded at high tide. However, the project {{was rejected by the}} British East India Company in 1783. In 1784, the Hornby Vellard project was completed and soon reclamations at Worli and Mahalaxmi followed. The history of journalism in Bombay commenced with publication of the Bombay Herald in 1789 and the Bombay Courier in 1790. In 1795, the Maratha army defeated the Nizam of Hyderabad. Following this, many artisans and construction workers from Andhra Pradesh migrated to Bombay and settled into the flats which were constructed by the Hornby Vellard. These workers where called Kamathis, and their enclave was called Kamathipura. The construction of the Sion Causeway (Duncan Causeway) commenced in 1798. The construction of the Sion Causeway was completed in 1802 by Governor Jonathan Duncan. It connected Bombay Island to Kurla in Salsette. On 17 February 1803, a fire raged through the town, razing many localities <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Fort, subsequently the British had to plan a new town with wider roads. In May 1804, Bombay was hit by a severe famine, which led to a large-scale emigration. On 5 November 1817, the British East India Company under Mountstuart Elphinstone defeated Bajirao II, the Peshwa of the Maratha Empire, in the Battle of Kirkee which took place on the Deccan Plateau. The success of the British campaign in the Deccan witnessed the freedom of Bombay from all attacks by native powers.|$|E

25|$|By {{the early}} nineteenth century Bern had {{expanded}} as far as it could within the old city walls. An increasing number of people were living outside the city walls in neighboring communities. Throughout the nineteenth century, this ring of modern cities grew up <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> City without forcing it to demolish the medieval city core. However, the growth <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> City did lead to several projects.|$|E

25|$|The {{mouth of}} the Singapore River was the old Port of Singapore, being {{naturally}} sheltered by the southern islands. Historically, the city of Singapore initially grew around the port so the river mouth became the centre of trade, commerce and finance.

25|$|Although strike {{planners}} {{intended for}} the strike to be peaceful, violence quickly broke out. White was arrested after exchanging insults and blows with police officers.

25|$|To {{accommodate}} the growing volume of traffic, construction {{began on the}} current bridge in 1927. It was designed by Mott, Hay and Anderson and fabricated by the famous bridge building firm of Sir William Arrol & Co. at their Dalmarnock Ironworks in Glasgow (they also built the famous Forth Rail Bridge and the steel structure of Tower Bridge in London). The new bridge was built <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> one to allow the road to remain open. It was opened on 31 October 1929 by the Duke of York (who would later become King George VI).|$|E
25|$|But by 1934, {{although}} {{the government had}} cleared land <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Post Office Building, Congress was increasingly opposed to demolishing the structure. Tearing down a structurally sound 35-year-old building during the Great Depression seemed foolish. But the executive branch agencies overseeing the Federal Triangle's construction still wanted it gone. Yet, it was not demolished. Four years passed. Although a push was made to remove the Old Post Office Building again in 1938, Senator Elmer Thomas defended it and attacked the erection of a Neoclassical office building in its place as financially unacceptable.|$|E
25|$|By the 1950s, the {{neighborhood}} <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Post Office Pavilion had also declined. Pennsylvania Avenue NW {{was marked by}} deteriorating homes, shops, and office buildings {{on the north side}} and monumental Neoclassical federal office buildings on the south. After witnessing the poor state of the avenue during his inaugural parade, President John F. Kennedy appointed a President's Council on Pennsylvania Avenue to study ways to improve the area. The council's draft plan was ready for Kennedy's approval when he was assassinated on November 22, 1963. The draft plan retained the Old Post Office Pavilion.|$|E
