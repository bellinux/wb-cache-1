40|$|This {{paper is}} focused on the retail core banking {{services}} market. The demand side of this market is affected by the negative effects of the information asymmetry. European Union authorities are aware of that as they monitor the situation as well as they set out possible solutions that should reduce the main sources of asymmetry – offer opacity and the lack of offer comparison tools. In the Czech Republic there was introduced independent comparison tool project in the 2010. This system’s database holds more than 15, 000 answers about the day-to-day usage. This serves as a data source for our analysis. The aim is to classify the Czech working age e-banking clients, i. e. to identify basic retail core banking services usage patterns. As preparations there were performed verification-validation phase, logarithmical transformation and dimension reduction by principal component analysis. The two-step cluster analysis was performed on 8, 549 members classified by 19 variables concerning the type of the service, moth usage frequency or average amount of mo- ney, communication channel used to order the service and the bank the money were transferred to. Analysis indentified as an optimal number of clusters 3. There were identified mainstream client, more <b>active</b> <b>client</b> and the client with the “at the desk” preference. Sub-optimal, but still accepta- ble, solution was consisted of 4 clusters: mainstream client with his or hers own bank preference, mainstream client with other bank preference, less <b>active</b> <b>client</b> and “at the desk” preference cli- ent. Identified clusters don’t just describe the demand side as standard marketing research output but they can be used again as an information asymmetry reduction tool...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} flexible abstractions for specifying {{resource management}} policies, together with efficient mechanisms for implementing those abstractions. Several novel scheduling techniques are introduced, including both randomized and deterministic algorithms that provide proportional-share control over resource consumption rates. Such control {{is beyond the}} capabilities of conventional schedulers, and is desirable across {{a broad spectrum of}} systems that service clients of varying importance. Proportional-share scheduling is examined for several diverse resources, including processor time, memory, access to locks, and disk bandwidth. Resource rights are encapsulated by abstract, first-class objects called tickets. An <b>active</b> <b>client</b> consumes resources at a rate proportional to the number of tickets that it holds. Tickets can be issued in different amounts and may be transferred between clients. A modular currency abstraction is also introduced to flexibly name, share, and protect [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Fault {{tolerance}} schemes {{can be used}} {{to increase}} the availability and reliability of network services. One aspect of such schemes is service failover — the reconfiguration of available resources and restoration of state required to continue providing the service despite the loss of some of the resources and corruption of parts of the state. We have previously presented CoRAL, a fault tolerance scheme for Web service based on a redundant standby backup server and logging. The focus of this paper is the implementation and evaluation of client-transparent failover for this scheme. In the event of a primary server failure, <b>active</b> <b>client</b> connections failover to a spare where their processing continues seamlessly. If extra server resources are available, a new server can be reintegrated into the system to reestablish fault-tolerant operation. Our performance results indicate short failover times and low overhead during fault-free operation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} an internet-based distributed data-acquisition system for fiber-optic pressure sensors. There {{is a great}} need in industry to coordinate remote resources to perform a common task. The architecture described is based on remote access, via the internet, to {{a large number of}} fiber-optic pressure sensors located in different geographical areas. Distribution is done with server applications, which schedule requests for service and control the actual sensor device. Servers also detect conflicts between new requests and their current schedules. Client applica-tions act as virtual instrument panels that dispatch measurement tasks for servers. The architecture supports multiple sensors, which can be added/removed from the system dynamically. As well, there can be multiple clients attempting to access servers simultaneously. Thus, the sensors in question are publicly shared among the various <b>active</b> <b>client</b> applications. Index Terms—Fiber-optic sensors, internet resource sharing, re-source distribution, sensor grids, senor monitoring. I...|$|E
