5000|$|Radial leads project {{more or less}} in {{parallel}} from the same surface or aspect of a component package, rather than from opposite ends of the package. Originally, radial leads were defined as more-or-less following a radius of a cylindrical component (such as a ceramic disk capacitor). [...] Over time, this definition was generalized in contrast to <b>axial</b> <b>leads,</b> and took on its current form. When placed on a board, radial components [...] "stand up" [...] perpendicular, occupying a smaller footprint on sometimes-scarce [...] "board real estate", making them useful in many high-density designs. The parallel leads projecting from a single mounting surface gives radial components an overall [...] "plugin-nature", facilitating their use in high-speed automated component insertion ("board-stuffing") machines.When needed, an axial component can be effectively converted into a radial component, by bending one of its leads into a [...] "U" [...] shape so that it ends up close to and parallel with the other lead. Extra insulation with heat-shrink tubing may be used to prevent shorting out on nearby components. Conversely, a radial component can be pressed into service as an axial component by separating its leads as far as possible, and extending them into an overall length-spanning shape. These improvisations are often seen in breadboard or prototype construction, but are deprecated for mass production designs. This is because of difficulties in use with automated component placement machinery, and poorer reliability because of reduced vibration and mechanical shock resistance in the completed assembly.|$|E
40|$|The {{signalling}} molecule Sonic hedgehog {{is involved}} in a multitude of distinct patterning processes during vertebrate embryogenesis. In the nascent body axis of the zebrafish embryo, sonic hedgehog is co-expressed with axial (HNF 3 beta in mammals), a transcription regulator of the winged helix family. We show here that misexpression of <b>axial</b> <b>leads</b> to ectopic activation of sonic hedgehog expression in the zebrafish, suggesting that axial is a regulator of sonic hedgehog transcription. The sonic hedgehog gene was cloned from zebrafish and its promoter was characterized with respect to activation by axial. Expression of axial or rat HNF 3 beta in HeLa cells results in activation of co-transfected sonic hedgehog promoter-CAT fusion genes. This effect is mediated by two Axial (HNF 3 beta) recognition sequences. We furthermore identified a retinoic acid response element (RARE) in the sonic hedgehog upstream region which can be bound by retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR) heterodimers in vitro and confers retinoic acid inducibility to the sonic hedgehog promoter in the HeLa cell system. Our results suggest that both Axial (HNF 3 beta) and retinoic acid receptors are direct regulators of the sonic hedgehog gene...|$|E
40|$|Preliminary {{studies have}} been made {{on the use of}} the {{modified}} <b>axial</b> <b>lead</b> system in infancy and childhood. A highly significant correlation between internipple distance and height suggested that internipple distance be used as an index for the selection of a template to facilitate placement of the chest electrodes (Z and X). A series of 4 triangular templates was designed. The use of a template one size too large or too small was shown not to lead to any significant error in waveform measurement. A further study showed that the reference level for the application of the praecordial electrodes should be the 5 th intercostal space as for adults, but that no serious diagnostic error was likely to arise if the 4 th or 6 th intercostal space was chosen by mistake. A study of the Frank lead system suggested that the use of the 5 th intercostal space as a reference level was more appropriate than the 4 th intercostal space, which is generally adopted by users of that system. The conclusion reached was that the <b>axial</b> <b>lead</b> system is the preferred orthogonal lead system for children, with templates for 4 ranges of internipple distance (less than 10 cm; 15 to 20 cm; and less than 20 cm [...] adult build) being proposed to simplify electrode placement...|$|R

40|$|The {{introduction}} of electrocardiography into the clinical study {{of heart disease}} aroused the hope that a method might thereby be available for a quantitative measurement of myocardial power. But unfortunately because of the complicated electrical reaction which is expressed as a resultant in the waves of the electrocardiogram, it became evident that a close correlation {{was not to be}} expected between the power of the heart muscle and the amplitude of the electrical deflections of the galvanometer. Moreover it can be shown that fatally damaged hearts are capable of producing wide deviations of the string {{at a time when they}} are entirely powerless to provide an effective circulation to the body. For some years, however, it has been shown by physiologists working with these problems, notably by Einthoven and his pupils, that in animal experiments, in which direct leads can be used and monophasic curves recorded, there is a correlation between the force of muscular contraction, including the heart beat, and the size of the electrical waves produced. In other words the electrical potential difference developed during muscular activity may be an index of the mechanical activity of the muscle. This observation can not be transferred to the electrocardiogram in man, as recorded from the ordinary <b>axial</b> <b>leads,</b> for the reason that such records are diphasic and are not inscriptions of potential differences in the true electrical axis of the heart. They are in addition relatively crude and compound records of the contraction of a very complicated muscle structure the activity of whose various layers and syncytial connections defies analysis...|$|E

The extremely high level of radiation tolerance inherent in the ARM design is assured as a result of extensive research, thorough analysis and testing, careful selection of components and lot verification testing of finished hybrids.

Capable of uniformly high performance through long term exposures in radiation intense environments, this series sets the standard for distributed power systems demanding high performance and reliability. The ARM converters are hermetically sealed in a rugged, low profile package utilizing copper core pins to minimize resistive DC losses. Long-term hermeticity is assured through use of parallel seam welded lid attachment along with International Rectifier’s rugged ceramic pin-to-package seal. <b>Axial</b> <b>lead</b> orientation facilitates preferred bulkhead mounting to the principal heat-dissipating surface.

The shaft speed of the NNSTU's NSO- 01 pump, onto which changeable impellers were installed, was changed in steps of 100 rev/min in an interval of 600 – 1100 rev/min. The blade diameter was about 200 mm, and the maximum lead coolant flow rate in the course of the tests reached ∼ 2000 t/h. The performance of 27 impellers was investigated.

To do so the VENUS reactor (SCK-CEN) will be coupled with a new GENEPI neutron source under construction by CNRS (France). To accommodate this new source (a 250 keV deuteron accelerator) in a vertical coupling configuration, the VENUS building is being heightened.

The vertical beam line will have the distinctive feature to be retractile, allowing target changing or complete removal (for critical configuration for example).

The definite dipole was placed on the heart center of the torso filled with 0. 1 % NaCl solution. Electrode position on the torso surface is defined by two quantities; levels (number 1 throngh 10) and angles in the transverse plane. The levels were separated each other at a distance of 3 cm.
