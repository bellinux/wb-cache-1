The Amur tiger is a keystone species in the region of Russia Far East, Eastern Mongolia, Northeastern China, and North Korea, and its population declined dramatically during the past century, from the historical record of 3, 000 to the current low level of about 500 because of different kinds of anthropogenic disturbances. The extant tiger population is distributed mainly in the Russia Far East region, including one large habitat area along the Sikhote Mountain and two smaller habitat patches near the Russia-China border. A small number of tiger individuals are also found in several small isolated habitat patches in northeastern China. The primary causes for the decline of the tiger population were poaching, habitat loss, and habitat fragmentation. The scarcity of prey and wars were also responsible for the decrease in the tiger population. To better conserve this endangered species, we propose the following strategies and measures: to establish a long-term monitoring platform; to strictly prohibit tiger poaching and restrict forest logging, hunting, and building roads and other artificial structures within the tiger distribution areas; and to build <b>animal</b> movement <b>corridors</b> among reserves and across the China-Russia border. To achieve these goals, large-scale land use planning and habitat pattern optimization are needed, and conservation goals must be integrated with the overall goal of sustainable development in the region that simultaneously considers environmental, economic, and social factors based on the principles of landscape ecology and sustainability science...|$|R

They are also important for tourism. Partners believe that investment in the north eastern parks contributes to the ecological and economic development of the KAZA TFCA.The north eastern national parks are relatively new compared with other Namibian protected areas. Khaudum, Mudumu and Mamili (now Nkasa Rupara [...] ) national parks were created shortly before Namibia gained Independence from South Africa in 1990. Bwabwata National Park was created in 2007.

40|$|Among {{the most}} popular {{strategies}} for maintaining populations of both plants and animals in fragmented landscapes is to connect isolated patches with thin strips of habitat, called corridors. Corridors are thought to increase the exchange of individuals between habitat patches, promoting genetic exchange and reducing population fluctuations. Empirical studies addressing the effects of corridors have either been small in scale or have ignored confounding effects of increased habitat area created {{by the presence of}} a corridor. These methodological difficulties, coupled with a paucity of studies examining the effects of corridors on plants and plant–animal interactions, have sparked debate over the purported value of corridors in conservation planning. We report results of a large-scale experiment that directly address this debate. In eight large-scale experimental landscapes that control for patch area and test alternative mechanisms of corridor function, we demonstrate that corridors not only increase the exchange of animals between patches, but also facilitate two key plant–animal interactions: pollination and seed dispersal.

We estimated population genetic structure using 11 microsatellite loci and identified a single genetic cluster and no genetic differences were found among the watersheds as a result of high levels of gene flow. At finer scales, we assessed the correlation between individual pairwise genetic distances and Euclidean distance as well as different models of least cost path (LCP). We used a range of cost values for the landscape types in order to build our LCP models. We found a positive relationship between genetic distance and least cost distance when we considered roads as corridors for movements.

In this context, the present study has been devoted to the analysis of the causes and potential solutions to the problem in the Province of Soria (Central Spain), where more than 50 percent of the reported car accidents were related in 2000 to the presence of wild animals on the road. The study was funded by the Dirección General de Medio Natural from the Consejería de Medio Ambiente of Junta de Castilla y León (the regional body in charge of game and wildlife) with a total budget of ca. $ 11, 650. The modelling has been carried out at two different spatial scales, a regional one focused oo the defi nition of the areas with high accidentality, and a local one aimed at the search of factors determining the exact locations of accidents. The study was based on the database of car acidents provided by the Dirección General de Tráfi co with indication of date, hour and location of the accident (approximated to the nearest 0. 1 km post), and species involved in the crash. This database comprised a total of 2, 067 accident locations corresponding to the 1988 - 2001 period. An initial analysis of the spatial contagion among accident locations lead to the defi nition a set of 41 “black sections” in roads, with 0. 8 to 47. 3 km length each. These sectors embrace more than 70 percent of accident locations, though totalizing only a 7. 7 percent of the road network of the province. A GIS-based analysis of the landscape features corresponding to these sectors was carried out in comparison with a set of 43 “white sections” interspersed among them. This task was based on the forest map of the province (1 : 50. 000 scale) working with 1 km radius circles centered on the midpoint of “black” and “white” sections. Nine land-use variables plus the length of ecotones and the diversity of substrata were used as input variables. The statistical analysis and the modelling showed the accident-prone areas to be characterized by their high forest cover, low presence of human structures, and a high diversity of vegetation types with some presence of crops. The analysis at the accident-point scale was carried out within a total of 18 “black sections” of roads, through a sampling of 12 points with accidents recorded and 12 free of them in each section. In each point 28 quantitative and qualitative variables were measured. The variables covered the most relevant features believed to be potentially related to accidentality, such as the road characteristics from the driver’s point of view (distance to curve, signaling), habitat structure (land-uses, distance to trees), and local morphology (natural geomorphology plus human-made structures). The statistical analyses and modelling showed the accidents happening at points of <b>animal</b> <b>corridors</b> crossing the road, with vegetation, local morphology plus human structures forcing the animals to cross at predictable points. The results thus show the potential to predict the points with higher probabilities to be accident-prone, thus opening the way for the effi cient expenditure in mitigative and preventive measures for both the problem of animal-car collisions and for the alleviation of population fragmentation by roads. Moreover, modelling points to the possibility of mitigating the problem of animal-vehicle collisions in small roads by a combination of fencing and the ubication of alternative animal passes at certain points.

Interviews in the area werealso operated, and data about how <b>animal</b> use the <b>corridors</b> were used along with registered human-tiger conflicts. The results show that during the first period, a total of 360 km 2 of the area changed vegetation type, mostly due to an increase of agricultural areas. The second largest change (79 km 2) was an increase of moist mixed deciduous forest which seems to have taken over some of the semi evergreen forest’s previous area. If that is the case it is most likely an effect of selective logging from the local people, who use fire wood as fuel. All in all, there has been a great habitat loss along withfragmentation of the landscape. The conflict data shows that tigers are present between the core areas, and the interviews show that the migrations of other animals are also common. To maintain the high ecological values in Karbi Anglong, it is of great importance to maintain connectivity between core areas and stop further habitat loss and fragmentation...|$|R

These multi-sensory neural representations allow animals to successfully navigate {{in space and}} to form relevant associative memories critical to survival. The remembered location of a plentiful food source or a predator could {{mean the difference between}} life and death. To form survival relevant associative memories across multiple sensory modalities animals must be able to sense, encode, and integrate information from their immediate environment. The Information gathered across multiple sensory systems must therefore be temporally correlated and converge within the brain. The mammalian hippocampus is one such structure where sensory information converges. Hippocampal place cells are known to fire at a particular location within an animal’s environment (place field). As the animal moves through a place field action potentials proceed in phase with respect to hippocampal theta oscillations (phase precession). Place fields encode specific positions in the animal’s environment, and therefore provide a suitable substrate for the integration of diverse sensory inputs with spatial information. Such association would position sensory landmarks within the environment and would thus be crucial for successful spatial orientation and navigation. To better understand how multisensory information is integrated for the formation of a neuronal place map, I performed in-vivo extracellular recordings in the hippocampus of behaving Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus). Specifically, I sought to understand the relative contribution of visual and locomotor inputs to place cell activity. Recordings were performed in a virtual reality behavioural setup in which animals ran along a virtual linear <b>corridor.</b> <b>Animal</b> locomotion was determined via a tracking-ball treadmill. By altering the gain factor between the movement of the ball and the speed of the visual projection on a single trial basis I could decouple visually perceived movement from the animal’s locomotion. Through these experiments I showed that place cells in Cornu Ammonis area 3 (CA 3) responded differentially to closed loop manipulation. One subset of place cells formed its place field based on visual information within the virtual environment, independent of the distance travelled by the animal. Such visually driven place fields predominantly occurred at visual texture changes within the virtual corridor. A second subset of place cells relied predominantly on locomotor inputs, as place fields remained at the same running distance on a single trial basis. This was also confirmed in dark trials during which the projection was switched off. This meant that animals had to rely on internal cues such as path-integration and proprioceptive/motor efference information. A third subset of cells exhibited two place fields, with each field being driven by one of the two different inputs. As a population both types of place fields formed input-specific maps that were simultaneously represented in the hippocampus. This notion is corroborated by the fact that place field firing was adjusted on a single trial basis without adaptive processes required. Furthermore, I investigated whether overlapping input-specific place maps are integrated in a common processing frame. To this end I analysed phase precession of overlapping place fields, which is thought to be crucial for encoding time ordered events that are compressed within a theta cycle. I found that theta-scale timing correlations shift with gain changes, which argues against mechanisms based exclusively on recurrent CA 3 connections for memory formation. My results therefore indicate that the hippocampus preserves information from distinct processing streams to form coexisting space representations. These coexisting input-specific maps could then be associated on a population level in order to form multimodal memories. Such association is likely to be formed from sensory information, fed-forward via the hippocampus, rather than via recurrent hippocampal connections. Thus, the hippocampus provides animals with several maps of their environment, each specified for a specific sensory-input. Animals could therefore rely on the most appropriate map such that locomotor information would be more precise than visual information when the animal is navigating in darkness...|$|R
40|$|Cue: It?s widely {{acknowledged}} that HIV and AIDS pose an enormous threat to food production {{in many of}} Africa?s agriculture-dependent countries. For anyone to die from AIDS is a tragedy, but in Africa, {{many of those who}} are dying are the backbone of the farming labour force. How can those who are left behind, the very old, the very young, the widows and the orphans, manage to grow the crops they require for their own food and income needs? One answer, being promoted by the NGO Africare, is the use of labour saving technologies, that allow cultivation of sufficient areas of land with much less human labour than has been needed in the past. Africare has designed new implements, such as ploughs, planters and harvesters, which can be operated even by old people or fairly young children. Chris Kakunta recently visited a field day in his home country of Zambia, {{to find out more about}} the equipment Africare is promoting. He sent us this report. IN:		?I am here at the Africare ?? OUT:		??You are most welcome. ? DUR?N	 4 ? 58 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Chris Kakunta reporting from Magoye, Zambia, on new labour-saving equipment being promoted by the NGO Africare. Transcript Kakunta	I am here at the Africare stand, Magoye, Mazibuka, some 150 km south of Lusaka. Africare is one of the NGOs that has come to exhibit some of their equipment that they are promoting among small scale farmers at this year?s field day, particularly to small scale farmers who are vulnerable. And with me is Munachoongo Muleya, the field officer with the organisation. To start with Munachoongo, what are some of these equipment that you are trying to promote? Muleya	What we are doing actually, we are looking at two main areas. We are looking at conservation tillage and crop processing. So what we have here are conservation tillage implements and we have post-harvest machinery. Kakunta	How can the farmers benefit from this equipment that you are promoting? Muleya	You know these days, Chris, we are talking of HIV and AIDS, and actually we are talking of farmers who have lost their <b>animals</b> due to <b>Corridor</b> [disease]. And what you can see here, we have the rippers, we have the groundnut lifter, we have the cultivators, we have the weed-sweep. These implements that you see can be used by a farmer who has maybe two oxen. That farmer can use and actually rip the field as much as he wants. Kakunta	Let?s take for instance the ripper, this one, which is looking like a small plough really. Muleya	Actually this ripper that we are seeing here, it?s a ripper that can be used by any farmer, and what we have done it we have just designed this attachment and then you put it onto the usual beam. You know these beams at our farms, the plough beams that we have, you know the farmers have this tendency of saying, ?No, they have brought up this new technology but it is very expensive. ? Everything now we are making, it has to be fitted on the old beam, the old plough beam that we have on our farm. So you just have to attach the ripper to the beam which we have; then you use it to make your own furrows at the farm. Kakunta	When you came up with all this equipment, what was in your mind? Muleya	You know if you go to the villages now, Chris, you only find the old and the young. And actually in the villages there, the people who do most of the work are the women. Now we are saying, since we have the old men there at the farms, we have the old men in the village, if we bring these implements, and you can see on that poster Chris, that?s a poster for a maize sheller, and that?s a poster for a ripper, you know these men they get interested. The next thing you can see there is the ripper planter. Instead of the women following the animals everyday, the man will just put on the ripper planter, put the seed, he will make the furrow, he will plant, and the same ripper planter you are seeing has a covering mechanism. You rip, then it plants behind, and it covers. Then it does three jobs at once. So it will be easier for the old men in the village there to do the work alone. Kakunta	How are the vulnerable, the women and children, the widows and orphans, how are they able to access some of this equipment. Do you have a mechanism in place? Muleya	We don?t give direct loans, but we work with lending institutions like micro-bankers trust, and women finance co-operatives. These people, when we go into the villages, we go with them, and the farmers are able to access money from these lending institutions and are able to buy our machines. I can give you an example; that group that you can see there is Manyama farmers group. They were able to access that peanut butter machine and now here in Magoye, these women are making peanut butter. That means the family and themselves, even their husbands - you can see that husband there is getting interested, because there is money coming out. And that peanut butter, actually, when you talk of HIV and AIDS, they can use it for the porridge, for the children. They can put it in relish. And you know it makes life easier. Kakunta	What about the health concerns. How are you addressing them? Muleya	Actually Chris, on health, it?s not direct, that we go to those people who are directly affected by HIV/AIDS. We are targeting those people who are there in the villages, who have remained. We are talking of the old and the young. You know, the old ladies who are looking after the orphans and those orphans who have been left; we don?t want these people to make excuses, that?s why we have made sure that we have these implements which are labour saving, which can be used by the old women - the ripper can be used by an old man, even a young boy. The ripper will just go, within two hours it will be a hectare. And that woman, what she needs is just to go and put in the seed when the rains come. That means that woman will be able to harvest; she won?t even make an excuse that she had nothing to use, and that?s why she is going hungry now. These farmers have to change with time, because everything is changing. Even the rains are changing. Then why don?t you change the implements that you are using as a farmer? Kakunta	I would like to thank you so much. Muleya	You are most welcome. End of track.
