5|$|During {{the second}} lap {{a number of}} drivers were forced to retire with broken wheels. Both Darracq drivers, A. Rawlinson and Algernon Lee Guinness, {{suffered}} from the issue; Rawlinson broke his in Ramsey, while Lee Guinness hit a well at Hilberry. A. J. Dew also broke <b>a</b> <b>wheel,</b> but continued the race in W. H. Warren's car; both being entered by J. W. H. Dew. A fourth driver, {{in one of the}} White steam cars, succumbed to the same problem, while A. J. Hancock crashed his Vauxhall into a tree, also breaking <b>a</b> <b>wheel.</b> Napier was once again the quickest driver around the circuit, followed by Percy Northey in a Rolls Royce, and Norman Littlejohn in the Vinot-Deguingand.|$|E
5|$|Front {{flat tire}}. Braking <b>a</b> <b>wheel</b> {{with a flat}} tire can cause the tire {{to come off the}} rim which greatly reduces {{friction}} and, {{in the case of a}} front wheel, result in a loss of balance.|$|E
5|$|Some organisms use rolling as a {{means of}} locomotion. These {{examples}} do not constitute the use of <b>a</b> <b>wheel,</b> as the organism rotates as a whole, rather than employing separate parts which rotate independently.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} {{solutions}} are {{proposed to improve}} the performance of <b>a</b> <b>wheeled</b> robot for rural environment. These solutions {{can be used for}} <b>a</b> <b>wheeled</b> mobile robot that moves upon curved surfaces, surfaces with irregularities and small coefficient of static friction between the wheels and the surface. The design and control of the robot are based on a new concept of <b>a</b> <b>wheeled</b> mobile robot, which can work in two different modes...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To study {{immediate}} gait {{changes in}} persons with PD when walking with different assistive walking devices. Methods: Ten individuals with idiopathic PD {{participated in the}} study. Gait parameters were recorded while walking with a cane and <b>a</b> <b>wheeled</b> walker, and were compared to a free walk without a walking device. Results: Persons with PD walked with slower gait speed when using a cane and <b>a</b> <b>wheeled</b> walker compared to walking without any device (p = 0. 007, p = 0. 002, respectively). Stride length reduced significantly when walking with <b>a</b> <b>wheeled</b> walker (p = 0. 001). Walking with the assistive devices did not affect cadence, double support phase, heel to heel base of support, stride time, and stance period. Conclusion: Persons with PD immediately walked with slower gait speed when using either a cane or <b>a</b> <b>wheeled</b> walker, and with shorter stride length when walking with <b>a</b> <b>wheeled</b> walker. The results may lead to more cautious clinical practice in gait rehabilitation using ambulatory assisted devices...|$|R

5|$|Another {{potential}} problem that arises at {{the interface between}} wheel and axle (or axle and body) is the limited ability of an organism to transfer materials across this interface. If the tissues that make up <b>a</b> <b>wheel</b> are living, {{they will need to}} be supplied with oxygen and nutrients and have wastes removed to sustain metabolism. A typical animal circulatory system, composed of blood vessels, {{would not be able to}} provide transportation across the interface. In the absence of circulation, oxygen and nutrients would need to diffuse across the interface, a process that would be greatly limited by the available partial pressure and surface area, in accordance with Fick's law of diffusion. For large multicellular animals, diffusion would be insufficient. Alternatively, <b>a</b> <b>wheel</b> could be composed of excreted, nonliving material such as keratin, of which hair and nails are composed.|$|E

5|$|On 15 September 2005, B-1B (s/n 85-0066) was {{extensively}} {{damaged by}} fire while landing at Andersen Air Force Base, Guam. The {{investigation into the}} incident concluded that leaking hydraulic fluid and sparks from <b>a</b> <b>wheel</b> being gouged caused a fire to start in the aircraft's right main landing gear as it touched down. The resulting fire damaged the B-1's right wing, engine nacelle, airframe and landing gear, leading to an estimated repair cost of more than $32million.|$|E

5|$|The hoop snake, a {{creature}} of legend in the United States and Australia, is said to grasp its tail in its mouth and roll like <b>a</b> <b>wheel</b> towards its prey. Japanese culture includes a similar mythical creature, the Tsuchinoko. Buer, a demon mentioned in the 16th-century grimoire Pseudomonarchia Daemonum, was described and illustrated in Collin de Plancy's Dictionnaire Infernal as having radially-arranged arms on which it rolled.|$|E
5|$|A {{male figure}} {{depicted}} holding certain {{objects such as}} a conch (symbol of eternal, heavenly space) and <b>a</b> <b>wheel</b> (eternal time and destructive power) is Vishnu. If a female figure is depicted holding these objects, she is seen as his consort, Lakshmi. In all the depictions Vishnu is holding four objects: a conch, <b>a</b> <b>wheel,</b> a lotus and a Kaumodaki (mace). These can be held {{in any of the}} icon's hands, making possible twenty-four different forms of Vishnu, each with a unique name. Apart from these, Vishnu is depicted in any of his ten avataras, which include Vishnu sitting on Anantha (the celestial snake and keeper of life energy also known as Shesha), Vishnu with Lakshmi seated on his lap (Lakshminarayana), with the head of a lion disembowelling a demon on his lap (Lakshminarasimha), with head of a boar walking over a demon (Varaha), in the Krishna avatar (as Venugopala or the cow herder playing the Venu (flute), dancing on the head of the snake Kaliya, lifting a hill such as Govardhana), with his feet over head of a small figure (Vamana), along with Indra riding an elephant, with Lakshmi seated on Garuda, and the eagle (stealing the parijata tree).|$|E
5|$|Although {{longitudinally}} stable when stationary, bikes {{often have}} a high enough center of mass and a short enough wheelbase to lift <b>a</b> <b>wheel</b> off the ground under sufficient acceleration or deceleration. When braking, depending on {{the location of the}} combined center of mass of the bike and rider with respect {{to the point where the}} front wheel contacts the ground, bikes can either skid the front wheel or flip the bike and rider over the front wheel. A similar situation is possible while accelerating, but with respect to the rear wheel.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> worn {{grinding}} <b>wheel</b> can {{be dressed}} to restore its grinding properties. Dressing <b>a</b> grinding <b>wheel</b> causes new grains {{to be produced}} on a glazed or loaded grinding <b>wheel.</b> <b>A</b> glazed grinding <b>wheel</b> {{is the result of}} high attritious wear causing the grains to become dull. <b>A</b> loaded grinding <b>wheel</b> is <b>a</b> result of chips clogging the grains on the grinding wheel due to the grinding of soft materials, improper grinding wheel selection processing parameters. In addition to sharpening <b>a</b> grinding <b>wheel</b> dressing {{can also be used to}} true <b>a</b> grinding <b>wheel</b> that is out of round or to shape the profile of <b>a</b> grinding <b>wheel</b> to produce specific features on the workpiece.|$|R

5|$|Beyond {{the area}} of Roman occupation, {{in the west and}} north, there are over 60 sites {{identified}} of wheelhouses. Perhaps a development of earlier Atlantic roundhouses, these have a characteristic outer wall surrounding a circle of stone piers (bearing a resemblance to the spokes of <b>a</b> <b>wheel).</b> Over 400 souterrains, small underground constructions, have been discovered in Scotland, many of them in the south-east, and although few have been dated, those that have suggest a construction date in the second or third centuries CE. They are usually found close to settlements (whose timber frames are much less well-preserved) and may have been for storing perishable agricultural products.|$|E
5|$|During the argument, {{a scuffle}} ensued between Pandey {{and the group}} of men. He was beaten, gagged and knocked {{unconscious}} with an iron rod. The men then dragged Jyoti {{to the rear of}} the bus, beating her with the rod and raping her while the bus driver continued to drive. Medical reports later said that she suffered serious injuries to her abdomen, intestines and genitals due to the assault, and doctors said that the damage indicated that a blunt object (suspected to be the iron rod) may have been used for penetration. That rod was later described by police as being a rusted, L-shaped implement of the type used as <b>a</b> <b>wheel</b> jack handle.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} Saxon and early medieval period {{there were at}} least four {{buildings}} on the summit.
