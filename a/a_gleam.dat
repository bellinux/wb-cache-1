In California of the South (1888), described by David Fine as [...] "one of the earliest booster tracts" [...] Widney and Walter Lindley wrote: [...] "The health-seeker who, after suffering in both mind and body, after vainly trying the cold climate of Minnesota and the warm climate of Florida, after visiting Mentone, Cannes, and Nice, after traveling to Cuba and Algiers, and noticing that he is losing ounce upon ounce of flesh, and his cheeks have grown more sunken, his appetite more capricious, his breath more hurried, that his temperature is no longer normal,... turns with <b>a</b> <b>gleam</b> of hope toward the Occident"—by which they meant Southern California. Many people followed that gleam and found it something more than hope".|$|E
500|$|Alexis Petridis from The Guardian {{listed the}} song as the weakest effort on MDNA, adding that [...] "its {{position}} as the album's lead single {{seems to have had}} more to do with showing off the presence of Nicki Minaj and M.I.A. than its featherweight melody." [...] A writer for Virgin Media gave the song three out of five stars, writing: [...] "Like most Madonna singles, it skips along at a furious pace with <b>a</b> <b>gleam</b> in its eye, but the self-references get tiresome and ultimately she is just trying too hard." [...] Nick Levine, writing for The National, relegated the track as a [...] "lighter pop morsel". Matthew Parpetua from Pitchfork Media panned the song, saying that Solveig's production on the track was paired with equally [...] "bland lyrics". Brad O'Mancey from Popjustice declared that the track was [...] "proof that sometimes you can listen to something many, many times and still not have any idea whether it's any good or not." [...] Chicago Tribune journalist Greg Kot was disappointed with the song and its lyrics, which he found to be meaningless, while Bernard Zuel of The Sydney Morning Herald relegated it as [...] "trite and disposable". Alex Macpherson from Fact found the song to be [...] "sheer misconceived awfulness".|$|E
500|$|An {{officer in}} one of the 38th Division's {{infantry}} battalions, who met Cubitt in early June, shortly after he took command, described him as [...] "a very large and fierce-looking major-general, with two rows of ribbons, and <b>a</b> <b>gleam</b> in his eye", who proceeded to interrogate a subaltern about the exact type and position of his unit's trench latrines, apparently something of a pet topic. A [...] "fire-eater with a marvellous flow of language", it was Cubitt's manner of speech, more than anything else, which made an impact on his contemporaries; a front-line officer in 1918 described watching him, during the October offensive, clearing a traffic jam with merely [...] "a magnificent gush of language". A colleague from his early days in the artillery described him as a [...] "perpetual joy to the soldier's world ... because of his picturesque language, which never gave offence because it was so absolutely natural and so aptly fitted the occasion", but under some circumstances it proved less suitable. Following a failed raid in 1918, he visited the offending battalion and harangued the officers collectively for some time, before demanding that they [...] "damn well had to do the raid over again, and damn well see that [...] made a proper job of it, or, by God, damn well go on raiding until [...] damn well did." [...] To the officers on the receiving end, already tired and dissatisfied, this was seen as a [...] "contemptible exhibition" [...] for a senior officer to make.|$|E

500|$|Producers {{identified}} {{the scene in}} which Elsa sings [...] "Let It Go" [...] as a pivotal point in the character's development. The scene depicts her choice to [...] "let go" [...] of her fear of using her powers. Character design supervisor Bill Schwab said, [...] "Before 'Let It Go', Elsa is really buttoned up, her hair is up—everything is perfect. During the song, she gives herself permission to be who she is and everything changes—her hair is more wild, her gown is magical. She's finally free—even if she is all alone." [...] Animators designed Elsa's appearance to reflect her metamorphosis; in the beginning, she is shown primarily in restrictive and confining outfits. Menzel said that, after accepting her abilities, Elsa's appearance becomes [...] "very vampy", continuing, [...] "She's quite sexy for Disney, I have to say—they're pushing the limits there a little bit! But there's <b>a</b> <b>gleam</b> in her eye and a supermodel walk {{that goes with it}} and, for me, it was fun to be a blonde because I'm not in real life." [...] In a January 2014 interview with John August and Aline Brosh McKenna, Lee disclosed that Lasseter personally helped with conceptualizing Elsa's physical transformation: [...] "y favorite thing about it ... is the actual model for doing it was John Lasseter .... he was a huge help in talking through how we translate that emotional journey ... with the animation ... e got up and he’s like, .... 'her hair goes, and she transforms, and she struts,' and he’s doing it. He’s acting it out." ...|$|E

[...] <b>A</b> <b>gleam</b> of sunlight catches the apple-blossom and strikes across the grass beyond." [...] The painting is labeled, O primavera, gioventù del anno/O gioventù, primavera della vita (O spring, youth of the year/O youth, the springtime of life).|$|E

It grapples once again with topics Mr. Cohen has pondered throughout his career: love, desire, faith, betrayal, redemption. Some of the diction is biblical; some is drily sardonic." ...|$|E

2500|$|The work of re-organization over, Marshal Turenne {{began the}} {{campaign}} in June 1644 by crossing the Rhine at Breisach, but almost instantly an army under the Duke of Enghien (afterwards the great Condé) joined him. The Duke, as a prince of the royal house, took the chief command of the united armies of [...] "France" [...] and [...] "Weimar". The four famous campaigns which followed brought to an end the Thirty Years' War. The desperately fought battle of Freiburg against Franz von Mercy's Bavarians (3, 5 and 9 August 1644) proved the chief event of the first campaign, after which the French successfully besieged Philippsburg. Before the capitulation Enghien withdrew and left Turenne in command. The marshal opened the campaign of 1645 with a strong forward movement, but Mercy surprised and defeated him at Mergentheim (Bad Mergentheim) on 2 May. Enghien again came to the front with the army of France, and Turenne's army received substantial reinforcement {{with the arrival of}} a Swedish force and of a contingent from Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel). The Swedes soon departed, but Enghien commanded 20,000 men when he met the Bavarians in a battle even more stubbornly contested than Freiburg. The French forces killed Mercy and decisively defeated his army at Allerheim near Nördlingen (3 August 1645). Ill-health forced Enghien to retire soon afterwards, leaving Turenne {{for the third time in}} command of the French army. Again he did not fare well against the larger imperial forces, but the campaign ended with <b>a</b> <b>gleam</b> of success in his capture of Trier (Trèves).|$|E
