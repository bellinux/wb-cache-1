This would effectively raise levies on soybean exports from 35% to 44% {{at the time of}} the announcement. This new taxation scheme, proposed by Minister Martín Lousteau, led to a nationwide lockout by farming associations, with the aim of forcing the government to back down on new tax system. They were joined on 25 March by thousands of pot-banging demonstrators massed around the Buenos Aires Obelisk and the presidential palace. These demonstrations were followed by others at locations <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>that</b> included road blockades and food shortages.|$|E

By 1959, {{tens of millions of people}} had starved to death. From October–December 1958, the economic system in the countryside broke down as farmers refused to go to work in the fields, raided government granaries for food, and in Guangdong, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Sichuan, and Qinghai, rebelled. In December 1958 China's leaders quietly decided to reverse the policies of the Great Leap.|$|E

25|$|Government {{marriage}} {{officers who}} have an objection of conscience to solemnising same-sex marriages may note this objection in writing to the Minister of Home Affairs, {{and if they do}} so they cannot be compelled to solemnise same-sex marriages. (This provision does not apply to religious marriage officers because they are in any case not obliged to solemnise a marriage that would violate the doctrines of their religion.) Several constitutional scholars have argued that this provision is unconstitutional, representing as it does state-sanctioned discrimination in violation of the right to equality. In September 2016, almost a decade after same-sex marriage was legalized in South Africa, the Department of Home Affairs released a list of marriage offices <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>that</b> are willing to solemnise same-sex marriages. According to the list, of the 409 marriage offices only 117 (or 28.6%) are willing to do so. In Gauteng, 17 out of 57 offices said they would conduct same-sex marriages, 10 out of 59 in the Eastern Cape, 5 out of 28 in the Free State, 10 out of 58 in Mpumalanga, 16 out of 61 in Limpopo, 10 out of 34 in the Western Cape, 9 out of 22 in the Northern Cape, 29 out of 68 in KwaZulu-Natal and 10 out of 22 in North West. Following its release, Minister of Home Affairs Malusi Gigaba said the list {{was just one of the}} strategies that the Department had undertaken to resolve the issue, which include increasing sensitisation of Home Affairs officials and ensuring that LGBT people are treated respectfully and according to policies and laws by staff.|$|E

500|$|More {{than just}} the events were changed during the 1998–99 season—the style of study {{required}} of students changed. Prior to that season, students had performed their own research for each event, and test writers {{did not have to}} base their questions on material USAD published. However, after a policy change {{at the beginning of the}} 1999–2000 competition year, test writers were required to base the tests on official USAD materials. After the change in policy, scores vastly increased <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> <b>That</b> year at Nationals, James E. Taylor High School had the highest team score yet seen at the competition. The following season, USAD once again altered their testing policies; 50% of test questions were to come from USAD published [...] "Resource Guides" [...] and 50% were to come from unspecified sources. Economics focused on business organizations and profiles in individual enterprise rather than macroeconomics and microeconomics as it had for the previous 19 years. A decrease in scores followed these changes; the national winner that year, El Camino Real High School, scored 5,923 fewer points than James E. Taylor High School had the previous year. The following year, USAD settled on an organization of test materials that it would use for almost a full decade, with a mixture of questions from the provided material and independent research.

500|$|The {{survivors}} of the failed uprisings fled to Brittany, where they openly supported Henry's claim to the throne. At Christmas, Henry Tudor swore an oath to marry Edward IV's daughter, Elizabeth of York, to unite the warring houses of York and Lancaster. Henry's rising prominence made him a great threat to Richard, and the Yorkist king made several overtures to the Duke of Brittany to surrender the young Lancastrian. Francis refused, holding out {{for the possibility of}} better terms from Richard. In mid-1484 Francis was incapacitated by illness and while recuperating, his treasurer Pierre Landais took over the reins of government. Landais reached an agreement with Richard to send back Henry and his uncle in exchange for military and financial aid. John Morton, a bishop of Flanders, learned of the scheme and warned the Tudors, who fled to France. The French court allowed them to stay; the Tudors were useful pawns to ensure that Richard's England did not interfere with French plans to annex Brittany. [...] On 16 March 1485 Richard's queen, Anne Neville, died, and rumours spread <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>that</b> she was murdered {{to pave the way for}} Richard to marry his niece, Elizabeth. The gossip alienated Richard from some of his northern supporters, and upset Henry across the English Channel. The loss of Elizabeth's hand in marriage could unravel the alliance between Henry's supporters who were Lancastrians and those who were loyalists to Edward IV. Anxious to secure his bride, Henry recruited mercenaries formerly in French service to supplement his following of exiles and set sail from France on 1 August.|$|E
