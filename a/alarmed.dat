When termites detect a potential breach, the soldiers usually bang their heads, apparently to attract other soldiers for defence and to recruit additional workers to repair any breach. Additionally, an <b>alarmed</b> termite bumps into other termites which causes them to be <b>alarmed</b> and to leave pheromone trails to the disturbed area, {{which is also a}} way to recruit extra workers.|$|E

Methods : A risk analysis was performed before implementation. <b>Alarms</b> from patient monitors recorded for a year were identified, classified and counted. The first <b>alarms,</b> which went to the nurse responsible for the patient, were distinguished from the repeat <b>alarms</b> that were generated if the nurse failed to respond within 45 sec. Results : The <b>alarm</b> handling protocol was changed as staff felt they needed a greater overview of the NICU <b>alarms</b> to avoid risks. In 1 year, 222 751 critical <b>alarms</b> including 12 309 repeat <b>alarms</b> were generated by patient monitors, equivalent to two <b>alarms</b> per patient per hour.

40|$|A {{phenomenon}} called <b>alarm</b> fatigue {{has been}} identified as an outcome of nearly 40 different <b>alarms</b> that sound at any given time in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) (Borowski et al., 2011). <b>Alarm</b> fatigue can result in impaired recognition of worsening patient conditions and has been implicated in fatal patient events (Kowalczyk, 2010; Altimari, 2017). A quality improvement research study (QIRS) was conducted, aimed at reducing total <b>alarms</b> including noncritical (clinically irrelevant) and false <b>alarms</b> that contribute to the incidence of <b>alarm</b> fatigue and the potential for unsafe conditions.

Just as time-based <b>alarms</b> are set {{to remind us of}} the arrival of a future reference time point, spatial <b>alarms</b> are set on a spatial location of interest which the subscribers of the <b>alarm</b> will travel to sometime in the future. Spatial <b>alarm</b> processing requires meeting two demanding objectives: high accuracy, which ensures zero or very low <b>alarm</b> misses, and high scalability, which requires highly efficient and optimal processing of spatial <b>alarms.</b> In this paper we present a motion-aware framework, facilitated by two systematic methods, for scalable processing of spatial <b>alarms.</b> First, we introduce the concept of safe period to minimize the number of unnecessary spatial <b>alarm</b> evaluations, increasing the throughput and scalability of the system. We show that our safe period-based <b>alarm</b> evaluation techniques can significantly reduce the server load for spatial <b>alarm</b> processing compared to the periodic evaluation approach, while preserving the accuracy and timeliness of spatial <b>alarms.</b> Second, we develop a suite of spatial <b>alarm</b> grouping techniques based on spatial locality of the <b>alarms</b> and motion behavior of the mobile users, which reduces the safe period computation cost for spatial <b>alarm</b> evaluation at the server side. We evaluate the scalability and accuracy of our approach using a road network simulator and show that the proposed motion-aware safe period-based approach to spatial <b>alarm</b> processing offers significant performance enhancements for the <b>alarm</b> processing server while maintaining high accuracy of spatial <b>alarms,</b> especially compared to the conventional periodic <b>alarm</b> evaluation approach. 1...|$|R
