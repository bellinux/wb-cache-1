5|$|We played Birmingham City in {{pre-season}} {{and he got}} {{a lovely}} ovation from their supporters and it was the same at Yeovil last year. He got a lovely clap at Northampton a few weeks ago when he was taken off. I don't think that happened by coincidence. And I've got <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> if he leaves Cheltenham he will get a similar reception if he comes back with another club. Supporters recognise him and they see the whole-heartedness and the commitment and the ability that he has got.|$|E

5|$|For {{the third}} {{successive}} tournament, Wales had {{missed out on}} qualification by a slender margin, having missed the 1982 World Cup on goal difference, and the 1984 European Championship by a single point. Despite this setback, which {{was followed by a}} 3–0 home defeat to Hungary in October, the team went {{through the rest of the}} season with only one other defeat, against Canada in May 1986. There was also the sense of history repeating itself in that, just as in 1977, it was a controversial penalty decision that ended up costing them dearly. Despite this however, there was also <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that,</b> given the group of players available to them, they would qualify for the next tournament. As it was, Wales failed to qualify for a major tournament until the 2016 European Championships.|$|E
5|$|The Giants {{defeated}} the Redskins 24–14 in week 14 {{to move into}} sole possession of {{first place in the}} NFC East. The Redskins held Joe Morris, who had rushed for 181yards in the Giants week eight victory, to 62yards on 22 carries. However, Lawrence Taylor recorded three sacks and harassed Redskins' quarterback Jay Schroeder all game, as the Giants recorded four sacks and the Redskins only recorded one. Phil Simms threw touchdown passes to Mark Bavaro, Bobby Johnson, and Phil McConkey in the victory. Schroeder threw six interceptions in the game, matching Sammy Baugh's franchise record, and the Redskins had 7 turnovers overall. After the game, Parcells gave the Redskins credit for their performance and told the reporters that he had <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> the two would meet again sometime in the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|After Byzantium, the Spartans were {{allegedly}} {{eager to}} end their involvement in the war. The Spartans were supposedly of the view that, with the liberation of mainland Greece and the Greek cities of Asia Minor, the war's purpose had already been reached. There was also perhaps <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> securing long-term security for the Asian Greeks would prove impossible. In the aftermath of Mycale, the Spartan king Leotychides had proposed transplanting all the Greeks from Asia Minor to Europe as the only method of permanently freeing them from Persian dominion. Xanthippus, the Athenian commander at Mycale, had furiously rejected this; the Ionian cities were originally Athenian colonies, and the Athenians, if no-one else, would protect the Ionians. This marks {{the point at which}} the leadership of the Greek Alliance effectively passed to the Athenians. With the Spartan withdrawal after Byzantium, the leadership of the Athenians became explicit.|$|E

5|$|Durkheim {{believed}} {{there was more to}} suicide than extremely personal individual life circumstances: for example, a loss of a job, divorce, or bankruptcy. Instead, he took suicide and explained it as a social fact instead of a result of one’s circumstances. Durkheim believed that suicide was an instance of social deviance. Social deviance being any transgression of socially established norms. He created a normative theory of suicide focusing on the conditions of group life. The four different types of suicide that he proposed are egoistic, altruistic, anomic, and fatalistic. He began by plotting social regulation on the x-axis of his chart, and social integration on the y-axis. Egoistic suicide corresponds to a low level of social integration. When one is not well integrated into a social group it can lead to <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> he or she has not made a difference in anyone’s lives. On the other hand, too much social integration would be altruistic suicide. This occurs when a group dominates the life of an individual to a degree where they feel meaningless to society. Anomic suicide occurs when one has an insufficient amount of social regulation. This stems from the sociological term anomie meaning a sense of aimlessness or despair that arises from the inability to reasonably expect life to be predictable. Lastly, there is fatalistic suicide, which results from too much social regulation. An example of this would be when one follows the same routine day after day. This leads to he or she believing there is nothing good to look forward to. Durkheim suggested this was the most popular form of suicide for prisoners.|$|E

25|$|Panic {{disorder}} is an anxiety disorder characterized by recurrent unexpected panic attacks. Panic attacks are sudden periods of intense fear that may include palpitations, sweating, shaking, shortness of breath, numbness, or <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> something really bad {{is going to}} happen. The maximum degree of symptoms occurs within minutes. There may be ongoing worries about having further attacks and avoidance of places where attacks {{have occurred in the}} past.|$|E

25|$|Miller {{then opened}} the bowling and took 2/8 as Oxford University were {{dismissed}} for 70 after electing to bat. He then made 19, before taking 3/19 in a victory by an innings and 86 runs. However, he felt that umpire Frank Chester had taken a hostile attitude towards the Australians, <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> would persist through the summer. Miller then missed the innings victory against Minor Counties, instead spending the weekend with Princess Margaret.|$|E
25|$|NAC Breda’s longest-running and deepest rivalry is {{with their}} nearest neighbour, Willem II from Tilburg, colloquially known as Stillem II (English: Quietness II). This rivalry {{originated}} in the twenties of the 20th century. Matches between the two {{are referred to as}} the derby of Brabant. The two cities of Breda and Tilburg are just 20 kilometres apart, leading to an intense feeling of a cross-town rivalry, heightened by <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> it is city against city with local pride at stake.|$|E

25|$|One {{cause of}} the change in young women's {{behavior}} was World War I which ended in November 1918. The death of large numbers of young men in the war, and the Spanish flu epidemic which struck in 1918 killing between 20–40 million people, inspired in young people <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> life is short and could end at any moment. Therefore, young women wanted to spend their youth enjoying their life and freedom rather than just staying at home and waiting for a man to marry them.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the large}} number of Turkish Kurds, {{successive}} governments have viewed the expression of a Kurdish identity as a potential threat to Turkish unity, <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> has been compounded since the armed rebellion initiated by the PKK in 1984. One of the main accusations of cultural assimilation relates to the state's historic suppression of the Kurdish language. Kurdish publications created throughout the 1960s and 1970s were shut down under various legal pretexts. Following the military coup of 1980, the Kurdish language was officially prohibited in government institutions.|$|E

25|$|Memory-based {{explanations}} {{may lead}} {{to the development of a}} number of non-invasive experimental methods by which a long sought-after analogue of déjà vu can be reliably produced that would allow it to be tested under well-controlled experimental conditions. Cleary suggests that déjà vu may be a form of familiarity-based recognition (recognition that is based on <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> an event or experience currently being experienced has already been experienced in the past) and that laboratory methods of probing familiarity-based recognition hold promise for probing déjà vu in laboratory settings.|$|E
25|$|RTVA {{revealed}} {{that they were}} unhappy with the European Broadcasting Union (EBU)'s decision to allow Spain to switch semi-finals for their voting. Having originally been drawn {{to vote in the}} first semi-final, the same semi-final as Andorra, TVE asked the EBU to switch semi-finals to allow for promotion of Eurovision itself. RTVA announced their disappointment on this decision, as RTVA believed that, without Spain voting, Andorra's chances of qualifying would be lower. There was also <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> the amount of promotion done in Spain was to no avail.|$|E
25|$|When World War I {{broke out}} on 4 August 1914 No.9r was nearly ready for erection, and despite {{competing}} demands for materials and manpower for other projects, construction continued {{during the first}} months of the war. However, there was <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> the project was no longer favoured by the Admiralty: Winston Churchill, then First Lord of the Admiralty was known to be unenthusiastic about airships, and on 12 March 1915 he cancelled the order for the ship. The reasons given for this decision were that it was expected that the war would be finished in 1915, and that the vessel would not be operational by then and thus was a waste of valuable resources.|$|E
