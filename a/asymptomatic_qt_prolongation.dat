40|$|Arsenic {{trioxide}} (AS 2 O 3) for leukaemia {{treatment was}} described a century ago. Recent resurgence {{in the use}} of arsenic trioxide is related to its high efficacy in acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL). Most arsenic trioxide preparations are intravenous, although an oral formulation is similarly efficacious. Side effects of arsenic trioxide are usually minor, including skin reactions, gastrointestinal upset, and reversible increases in transaminases. During therapy, a leukocytosis occasionally occurs, which may be complicated by fluid accumulation and pulmonary infiltration. Arsenic trioxide causes an <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>QT</b> <b>prolongation</b> in most patients. However, if concomitant cardiopulmonary diseases or electrolyte disturbances are present, more sinister arrhythmias may develop. Therefore, before commencement of arsenic trioxide therapy, a full cardiac assessment and avoidance of drugs that prolong QT interval should be instituted. Arsenic trioxide is partly renally excreted and, therefore, dose adjustment is required when renal function is impaired. in addition to its use in APL, arsenic trioxide is now tested in other malignancies, notably multiple myeloma. © 2004 Ashley Publications Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

Overdose of these medications can occur by accidental ingestion or ingestion for suicide attempt. Morbidity and mortality are higher in these poisonings compared to other poisonings. In this study, BB or CCB drug poisoning cases are discussed and the literature is reviewed. Material and Method: Between January 2011 and July 2012, 590 cases of drug poisoning were admitted in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit. In this study, 16 of these 590 subjects who were poisoned with calcium channel blockers or beta blockers were evaluated. 11 (68. 8 %) patients were female and 5 (31. 2 %) were male. Mean age of the patients was 11. 8 ± 5. 94 (2. 5 - 18) years. Results: Hypotension {{was the most common}} clinical sign in CCB poisoning. Two patients were <b>asymptomatic.</b> On ECG, <b>QT</b> <b>prolongation</b> was found in four patients, AV block was found in two patients and ST depression was found in one patient. Nausea, vomiting, hypotension, lethargy and tremor were the most common clinical findings in patients with BB intoxication. Although seven patients had normal ECG, one patient had <b>QT</b> <b>prolongation</b> and one patient had Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome. Only dopamine was given to two patients with CCB poisoning, dopamine and dobutamine were given to one patient and dopamine, dobutamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, glucagon and insulin were given to another patient. Inotropic drugs were not given to any patient with BB poisoning. IV Ca-gluconate was given to all patients with CCB poisoning except two patients who were asymptomatic. 15 patients were discharged, while one patient with CCB poisoning was lost. Conclusions: Because the prognosis of CCB or BB poisoning may be very severe, these patients should be followed up in a fully-equipped pediatric intensive care unit.

Six (67 %) of the 9 family members with <b>QT</b> <b>prolongation</b> had late potentials on the signal-averaged electrocardiogram (ECG) compared with 1 of the 13 normal subjects (p < 0. 007). Positive predictive accuracy of the signal-averaged ECG for the detection of subjects with <b>QT</b> <b>prolongation</b> was 86 %; negative predictive accuracy was 80 %. During exercise testing, the QT interval normalized, whereas late potentials did not change significantly. Exercise testing did not reveal the presence of coronary artery disease as a possible cause of late potentials. It is concluded that 1) compared with family members with a normal QT interval, patients with this type of bradycardia-dependent <b>QT</b> <b>prolongation</b> have a high incidence of late potentials; 2) late potentials persist despite normalization of the QT interval at high heart rates, indicating that there is no direct relation between late potentials and QT prolongation; and 3) late potentials are not caused by coronary artery disease in these subjects.

Although this has improved our understanding of drug-induced <b>QT</b> <b>prolongation</b> {{there has been much}} less research aimed at helping clinicians assess risk in individual patients with drug induced <b>QT</b> <b>prolongation.</b> This review will focus on assessment of drug-induced <b>QT</b> <b>prolongation</b> in clinical practice using a simple risk assessment approach. Accurate measurement of the QT interval is best done manually, and not using the measurement of standard ECG machines. Correction for heart rate (HR) using correction formulae such as Bazett's is often inaccurate. These formulae underestimate and overestimate the duration of cardiac repolarization at low and high heart rates, respectively. Numerous cut-offs have been suggested as an indicator of an abnormal QT, but are problematic in clinical practice. An alternative approach is the QT nomogram which is a plot of QT vs. HR. The nomogram has an ‘at risk’ line and QT-HR pairs above this line have been shown in a systematic study to be associated with TdP and the line is more sensitive and specific than Bazett's QT c of 440 [*]ms or 500 [*]ms.

40|$|Sudden {{cardiac death}} {{is among the}} most common causes of {{cardiovascular}} death in developed countries. The majority of sudden cardiac deaths are caused by acute ventricular arrhythmia following repolarization disturbances. An important risk factor for repolarization disturbances is use of QT prolonging drugs, probably partly explained by gene-drug interactions. In this review, we will summarize QT interval physiology, known risk factors for <b>QT</b> <b>prolongation,</b> including drugs and the contribution of pharmacogenetics. The long QT syndrome can be congenital or acquired. The congenital long QT syndrome is caused by mutations in ion channel subunits or regulatory protein coding genes and is a rare monogenic disorder with a mendelian pattern of inheritance. Apart from that, several common genetic variants that are associated with QT interval duration have been identified. Acquired <b>QT</b> <b>prolongation</b> is more prevalent than the congenital form. Several risk factors have been identified with use of QT prolonging drugs as the most frequent cause. Most drugs that prolong the QT interval act by blocking hERG-encoded potassium channels, although some drugs mainly modify sodium channels. Both pharmacodynamic as well as pharmacokinetic mechanisms may be responsible for <b>QT</b> <b>prolongation.</b> Pharmacokinetic interactions often involve drugs that are metabolized by cytochrome P 450 enzymes. Pharmacodynamic gene-drug interactions are due to genetic variants that potentiate the QT prolonging effect of drugs. <b>QT</b> <b>prolongation,</b> often due to use of QT prolonging drugs, is a major public health issue.

Previous studies have generally considered the presence or absence of <b>QT</b> <b>prolongation</b> as a marker of the potential risk for TdP.

BACKGROUNDPolymorphic VT {{in the setting of}} acute MI generally occurs during the hyperacute phase, is related to ischemia, and is not associated with <b>QT</b> <b>prolongation.</b> Although <b>QT</b> <b>prolongation</b> after MI is well described, typical pause-dependent polymorphic VT (torsade de pointes) secondary to uncomplicated MI was previously unknown. METHODSOf 434 consecutive admissions for acute MI, 8 patients had progressive <b>QT</b> <b>prolongation</b> that led to typical torsade de pointes. None of these patients had active ischemia or other known causes of <b>QT</b> <b>prolongation.</b> These patients were compared with 100 consecutive patients with uncomplicated MI who served as controls. RESULTSThe incidence of torsade de pointes following MI was 1. 8 % (95 % confidence interval 0. 8 % to 3. 6 %). The QTc intervals of patients and controls were similar on admission. The QTc lengthened by day 2 in both groups, but more so in patients with torsade de pointes (from 470 ± 46 to 492 ± 57 ms [p < 0. 05] and from 445 ± 58 to 558 ± 84 ms, respectively [p < 0. 01]). Maximal <b>QT</b> <b>prolongation</b> and torsade de pointes occurred 3 to 11 days after infarction. Therapy included defibrillation, magnesium, lidocaine and beta-blockers.

This first-in-human {{study investigated the}} MTD, recommended dose for expansion (RDE), safety, preliminary activity, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of ribociclib in patients with Rb+ advanced solid tumors or lymphomas. Experimental Design: Patients received escalating doses of ribociclib (3 -weeks-on/ 1 -week-off or continuous). Dose escalation was guided by a Bayesian Logistic Regression Model with overdose control principle. Results: Among 132 patients, 125 received ribociclib 3 - weeks-on/ 1 -week-off and 7 were dosed continuously. Nine dose-limiting toxicities were observed among 70 MTD/RDE evaluable patients during cycle 1, most commonly neutropenia (n = 3) and thrombocytopenia (n = 2). The MTD and RDE were established as 900 and 600 mg/day 3 -weeks-on/ 1 -week-off, respectively. Common treatment-related adverse events were (all-grade; grade 3 / 4) neutropenia (46 %; 27 %), leukopenia (43 %; 17 %), fatigue (45 %; 2 %), and nausea (42 %; 2 %). <b>Asymptomatic</b> Fridericia's corrected <b>QT</b> <b>prolongation</b> was specific to doses ≥ 600 mg/day (9 % of patients at 600 mg/day; 33 % at doses > 600 mg/day).
