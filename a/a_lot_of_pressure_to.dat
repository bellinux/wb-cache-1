During an Inside Soap feature on the Moon {{brothers}} vs the Mitchell brothers, Kate Woodward said [...] "Two sexy brothers to shake up Albert Square? That sounds familiar! But are Anthony and Tyler really the new Grant and Phil Mitchell?" [...] Lapinskas commented on this, saying [...] "It's <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> put us both under, but what a duo to be compared to!... Phil and Grant were in the show together for at least 10years, and they were fantastic– so {{to be linked to}} them is phenomenal. It really is a lot to live up to, but Tony and I are hoping to come in with out own energy and bring something completely new to EastEnders. Rachel Tarley from the Metro said [...] "it's nice to have a bit of fresh blood in the soap, especially since the appearance of another one of his siblings always seems to leave Michael a little more demented than he was before. Lapinskas revealed to the Daily Mirror that because of his role in EastEnders, he is recognised in public, calling the experience [...] "surreal". Cecile Metcalf of the Daily Mail branded Anthony [...] "the loveable rogue of the square, with a cheeky answer for everything".|$|E
500|$|For The Last of Us, {{the team}} had to create new engines to satisfy their needs. The {{artificial}} intelligence (AI) was created to coordinate with players on an intimate level, {{as opposed to the}} action elements from their previous projects; the addition of Ellie as AI was also a major contributor to the engine. The team intentionally added a feature in which Ellie remains close to Joel, in order to avoid being conceived as a [...] "burden". Programmer Max Dyckhoff stated that, when working on Ellie as AI, he tried to imagine her experiences throughout the game's events, in an attempt to achieve realism. The enemy AI, {{considered one of the most}} important features of the game, was developed to make random choices; they study their surroundings, finding tactics to attack the player. This uniqueness to gameplay was a factor into the attempt at making players feel emotions towards the enemies. The lighting engine was also re-created to incorporate soft light, in which the sunlight seeps in through spaces and reflects off surfaces. The team found great difficulty in developing the gameplay for The Last of Us, as they felt that every mechanic required thorough analysis. [...] "You feel <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> add things to make it 'more fun' and it gets super difficult to keep those out sometimes," [...] Druckmann said. In The Last of Us, the weapon that players have equipped change the behavior of the human NPCs. In addition, the stealth system was intentionally developed to offer a sense of desperation, to make players feel the same.|$|E

2500|$|Recording for {{the album}} began in 1991, and {{continued}} into 1992, while {{taking place at}} Ian London Studios, North Shore Soundworks, and Power Play Studios. During this time, Redman did another collaboration with EPMD on their fourth album Business Never Personal (1992). As EPMD member Parish Smith was often credited for mentoring Hit Squad artists Das EFX and K-Solo, Erick Sermon helped mentor Redman throughout the album, while receiving co-production credits {{for most of the}} album's songs. In spite of this, Redman was still left alone throughout the majority of the writing and recording process. He later recollected [...] "For that whole album I was under <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> learn, and learn quickly. Erick showed me a couple of recording moves, then threw me in the studio and just left me there. I had to learn and do it myself. Erick was always there if I really needed him, so it wasn't that bad. But he had his own shit to deal with and he figured I was okay on my own." [...] Redman further stated [...] "When I first started doing the album I was mad at Erick for leaving me in the studio. I was like 'what the fuck am I doing here?' I had an album to hit the world with, and it was just up to me. But I'm glad he did it, because I learned everything that I needed to." ...|$|E

[...] When Wesley's father finally did appear in Angel season five, he said:I had mixed feelings [...] It was <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> have to define something that had been speculated about for many years. I was worried that by making it specific, it would lose its power, both {{in the mind of the}} character and in the minds of the audience. All my concerns disappeared as soon as I read it. There are responses to powerful figures in your life, like your parents, that you can't necessarily control. Wesley's a very controlled person on the exterior and presents a very collected persona to the people around him, being with his father he would no longer be able to control his responses. That's one of the things I wanted to explore with this, the subtle ways in which you respond to the conditioning of your parents. Wesley has difficulty around his father on a physical level, on an emotional scale, and on an intellectual scale. He is extremely intimidated by his father, and at the same time, still seeking the approval that we all essentially want from our parents when we're children. The shooting [...] was an exhilarating moment in which there was the most dangerous person in his life on every level, and there is a woman he is obsessed with. And to have the woman jeopardized by something as dangerous as his father [...] I played that moment as a moment of pure instinct. Wesley is centered in his intellect and is more uncertain in his emotional life, but in that moment, he becomes pure instinct because he has to choose between the woman he loves and his father.|$|E

50|$|For example, if the {{plaintiff}} class {{is composed of}} 50,000 shareholders, each shareholder owns an average of 1000 shares, and each shareholder claims to have sustained losses of $10 per share, the potential compensatory damages are $500 million.

Even if {{the plaintiff}} has a relatively weak case, the expected value of going to trial will put the defendant under pressure to settle.
