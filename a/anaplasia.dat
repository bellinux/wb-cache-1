5000|$|<b>Anaplasia</b> (from ἀνά ana, [...] "backward" [...] + πλάσις plasis, [...] "formation") is a {{condition}} of cells {{in which they have}} poor cellular differentiation, losing the morphological characteristics of mature cells and their orientation with respect {{to each other and to}} endothelial cells.

5000|$|Such loss of {{structural}} differentiation is especially seen in most, but not all, malignant neoplasms. Sometimes, the term also includes an increased capacity for multiplication.

The term <b>anaplasia</b> literally means [...] "to form backward". It implies dedifferentiation, or loss {{of structural}} and functional differentiation of normal cells.

Anaplastic cells have lost total control of their normal functions and many have deteriorated cell structures. Anaplastic cells often have abnormally high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratios, and many are multinucleated. Additionally, the nuclei of anaplastic cells are usually unnaturally shaped or oversized. Cells can become anaplastic in two ways: neoplastic tumor cells can dedifferentiate to become anaplasias (the dedifferentiation causes the cells to lose all of their normal structure/function), or cancer stem cells can increase their capacity to multiply (i.e., uncontrollable growth due to failure of differentiation).|$|E
5000|$|NETs {{are often}} small, yellow or tan masses, often {{located in the}} {{submucosa}} or more deeply intramurally, {{and they can be}} very firm due to an accompanying intense desmoplastic reaction. The overlying mucosa may be either intact or ulcerated. Some GEP-NETs invade deeply to involve the mesentery. Histologically, NETs are an example of [...] "small blue cell tumors," [...] showing uniform cells which have a round to oval stippled nucleus and scant, pink granular cytoplasm. The cells may align variously in islands, glands or sheets. High power examination shows bland cytopathology. Electron microscopy can identify secretory granules. There is usually minimal pleomorphism but less commonly there can be <b>anaplasia,</b> mitotic activity, and necrosis.|$|E
50|$|Anaplastic cells display marked pleomorphism (variability). The nuclei are {{characteristically}} extremely hyperchromatic (darkly stained) and large. The nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio may approach 1:1 {{instead of}} the normal 1:4 or 1:6. Giant cells that are considerably larger than their neighbors may be formed and possess either one enormous nucleus or several nuclei (syncytia). Anaplastic nuclei are variable and bizarre in size and shape. The chromatin is coarse and clumped, and nucleoli may be of astounding size. More important, mitoses are often numerous and distinctly atypical; anarchic multiple spindles may be seen and sometimes appear as tripolar or quadripolar forms. Also, anaplastic cells usually fail to develop recognizable patterns of orientation to one another (i.e., they lose normal polarity). They may grow in sheets, with total loss of communal structures, such as gland formation or stratified squamous architecture. <b>Anaplasia</b> is the most extreme disturbance in cell growth encountered in the spectrum of cellular proliferations.|$|E

30|$|There {{are three}} {{histological}} distinct subtypes of P-EMC: one presents with a dual ductal component, {{which is a}} defined characteristic feature of this tumor (19 cases including our case); one presents with a solid component mainly consisting of spindle and polygonal-shaped myoepithelial cells (14 cases); and one mainly consists of myoepithelial cells with increased nuclear atypia, called myoepithelial <b>anaplasia</b> (four cases) [3, 25, 26]. For distinguishing the minor malignant cases from others, many pathologists have attempted to identify a specific histopathological finding as a predictive factor. Poor prognostic factors of the salivary gland EMC are often applied to P-EMCs. Seethala et al. reported that positive margin status, presence of angiolymphatic invasion, necrosis, and myoepithelial <b>anaplasia</b> in the EMC in salivary glands were predictors of decreased disease-free survival (DFS). Histology of both patients who died of P-EMC showed myoepithelial cell-predominant features with <b>anaplasia</b> [3, 24].

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the role and}} significance of TP 53 mutation in diffusely anaplastic Wilms tumors (DAWTs). Experimental Design: All DAWTs registered on National Wilms Tumor Study- 5 (n = 118) with available samples were analyzed for TP 53 mutations and copy loss. Integrative genomic analysis was performed on 39 selected DAWTs. Results: Following analysis of a single random sample, 57 DAWTs (48 %) demonstrated TP 53 mutations, 13 (11 %) copy loss without mutation, and 48 (41 %) lacked both [defined as TP 53 -wild-type (wt) ]. Patients with stage III/IV TP 53 -wt DAWTs (but not those with stage I/II disease) had significantly lower relapse and death rates than those with TP 53 abnormalities. Indepth analysis of a subset of 39 DAWTs showed seven (18 %) to be TP 53 -wt: These demonstrated gene expression evidence of an active p 53 pathway. Retrospective pathology review of TP 53 -wt DAWT revealed no or very low volume of <b>anaplasia</b> in six of seven tumors. When samples from TP 53 -wt tumors known to contain <b>anaplasia</b> histologically were available, abnormal p 53 protein accumulation was observed by immunohistochemistry. Conclusions: These data support the key role of TP 53 loss {{in the development of}} <b>anaplasia</b> in WT, and support its significant clinical impact in patients with residual anaplastic tumor following surgery. These data also suggest that most DAWTs will show evidence of TP 53 mutation when samples selected for the presence of <b>anaplasia</b> are analyzed. This suggests that modifications of the current criteria to also consider volume of <b>anaplasia</b> and documentation of TP 53 aberrations may better reflect the risk of relapse and death and enable optimization of therapeutic stratification...|$|E

In the present study, we re-evaluated a series of 347 medulloblastomas from the SIOP II clinical trial of the International Society of Paediatric Oncology to identify features predictive of clinical outcome. Relapse free survival for medulloblastomas with severe <b>anaplasia</b> [5 -year rate: S(60) = 49. 5 %], was significantly shorter than for tumours with moderate or mild <b>anaplasia</b> S(60) = 65. 4 %; P= 0. 001).

40|$|Unlike the {{original}} definitions of focal (FA) and diffuse <b>anaplasia</b> (DA) in Wilms tumor (WT), recently redefined FA and DA {{proved to be}} of prognostic significance. The aim {{of the study was}} to analyze WT from the SIOP file, the majority of which were treated with preoperative chemotherapy, in order to investigate whether chemotherapy influenced the presence of <b>anaplasia,</b> whether the new definitions were applicable to these tumors, and whether they were of prognostic significance. The unilateral anaplastic WT of children up to 16 years of age from the SIOP 6 and 9 nephroblastoma trials and studies were first classified according to {{the original}} definitions and analyzed. Then they were reclassified and analyzed according to the new definitions. <b>Anaplasia</b> was diagnosed in 86 (5. 5 %) of 1, 554 unilateral WT. The age at diagnosis ranged from 9 to 175 months (median, 63) and more than half of children were over 5 years of age. From 15 % to 85 % of the tumor mass showed chemotherapy-induced changes. Blastemal <b>anaplasia</b> was seen in 74, stromal in 23, and epithelial in 22 cases. According to the original definitions, FA was diagnosed in 55 (64 %) and DA in 31 (36 %) cases. In total, 48 % children were alive and well, including 53 % with FA and 39 % with DA (P = 0. 23). When reclassified, 39 old FA cases were moved to the new DA group, resulting in 70 (81 %) DA and 16 (19 %) FA cases. The female-to-male ratio for FA changed from 1. 9 : 1 to 1 : 1 while remained unchanged for DA. The percentage of FA stage I cases increased from 31 % to 44 %, while it decreased from 25 % to 6 % for stage III. For other stages it remained virtually unchanged.

MÉTODOS: A coorte de estudo incluiu 132 casos de tumor de Wilms unilateral em menores de 15 anos de idade matriculados em serviço de oncologia pediátrica, {{de janeiro}} de 1990 a dezembro de 2000. Curvas de sobrevida foram confeccionadas utilizando-se o método de Kaplan-Meier e fatores prognósticos foram analisados pelo modelo de riscos proporcionais de Cox. RESULTADOS: A estimativa de sobrevida global em cinco anos foi 84, 6 %. As probabilidades de sobrevida para os estádios I, II, III e IV foram de 100 %; 94, 2 %; 83, 2 % e 31, 3 %, respectivamente. A taxa de sobrevida para os pacientes com: histologia favorável foi de 89, 4 %, para aqueles com <b>anaplasia</b> focal 66, 7 % e com <b>anaplasia</b> difusa 40 %. Todos os pacientes com doença em estádio IV e <b>anaplasia</b> difusa foram a óbito (n= 4).

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the survival {{and the main}} prognostic factors among patients with unilateral Wilms' tumor patients. METHODS: The study cohort included 132 patients with unilateral Wilms' tumor aged under 15 years, who were enrolled in a pediatric oncology service. Survival curves were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and the prognostic factors were analyzed using the Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: The overall survival rate for five years was 84. 6 %. The survival probabilities for disease in stages I, II, III and IV stages were: 100 %, 94. 2 %, 83. 2 % and 31. 3 %, respectively. The survival rate was 89. 4 % for patients with favorable histology, 66. 7 % for focal <b>anaplasia</b> and 40 % for diffuse <b>anaplasia.</b> All patients with stage IV disease and diffuse <b>anaplasia</b> died (n= 4).
