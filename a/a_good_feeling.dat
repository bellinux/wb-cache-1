25|$|In February 2012, Schuyler Yancey {{was cast}} {{in the role of}} Dr. Cameron Davis. Yancey made his debut on the April 5, 2012 episode. Supermodel, turned actor, known for his {{appearance}} as Rihanna's love interest the California King Bed music video, Nathan Owens began taping the role in late September, in secret. On October 1, 2012, several sources, including Soap Opera Digest confirmed that Owens had joined the cast. Owens was spotted on set for the show's 12, 000th episode during a press conference. However, the producers refused to comment on the role Owens would be playing. The actor himself later confirmed through his own personal Facebook that he had been cast in the role of Cameron. Owens's Instagram message about the casting was believed to be an accident. Soaps In Depth later confirmed that Owens would make his first appearance on the December 21 as a replacement for Yancey. However, due to news coverage of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, Davis first air date was postponed to December 24, 2012. Owens found out about the role through his manager. In an interview, Owens revealed that he went out for the role of Rodney. He worked with casting director, Marnie Saitta and went through several tests. Owens admitted that he had <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>feeling</b> about the casting because he was given several opportunities to go over the material. Saitta called him back shortly after his test and told Owens to come back in a few days. He went back and forth a few times before he met with the producers and tested with Kate Mansi who portrayed Abigail. Owens signed on to play Cameron and beat out 15 other actors for the role. Owens admitted to being hesitant about replacing someone, though Yancey was only in the role {{for a short period of}} time, people had already gotten used to him, and Owens said that he felt like he was under a magnifying glass when he started, and that the potential critics made him a bit nervous. On September 21, 2013, at Kate Mansi's birthday party, Owens announced his departure from the series and revealed that he would last air in November.|$|E
500|$|The song proved {{popular with}} both {{young and old}} listeners. The public enjoyed hearing a {{supergroup}} of musicians singing together on one track, and felt satisfied in buying the record, knowing that the money would go towards a good cause. People reported they bought more than one copy of the single, some buying up to five copies of the record. One mother from Columbia, Missouri purchased two copies of [...] "We Are the World", stating, [...] "The record is excellent whether it's for a cause or not. It's fun trying to identify the different artists. It was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>feeling</b> knowing that I was helping someone in need." ...|$|E
500|$|Kershaw {{started the}} 2010 season by posting a 3.07 ERA in April, but {{did so by}} walking 22 batters in 29 innings. On May 4, he had his worst start of his career against the Milwaukee Brewers at Dodger Stadium, {{throwing}} just 57 pitches in 1 innings, while retiring only four of the 13 batters he faced—including the pitcher. He was booed loudly upon being pulled from the game. Kershaw said after the game, [...] "I didn't give our team any kind of chance. It's just not <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>feeling</b> to let your teammates down, let everybody down. It stings, it hurts. I've got to figure things out." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2004, De Ravin {{was cast}} to portray Claire Littleton {{on the hit}} ABC drama Lost. Speaking about the success of Lost, she said: [...] "It's sort of hard to say. You read {{something}} and have <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>feeling</b> about it, it sounds great, ties nicely together and then shooting something, editing it, the music, the actors involved, everything sort of plays a huge part. Everyone involved had a great feeling towards it, but you never really know." [...] She was a series regular {{for the first four}} seasons and the sixth and final season. She was not a regular in season five but was under a holding contract with ABC Network.|$|E
500|$|Although not {{included}} in the Test squads to face either New Zealand or South Africa, White was named in the ODI and Twenty20 squads to face South Africa at home, and professed [...] "it was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>feeling</b> to know you are still in the mix". White played in a more familiar role in the Twenty20s, batting in the middle-order, and after a disappointing 7 in the first match, made 40* off 18 in the second to push Australia's total up beyond South Africa's reach. He had a steady ODI series, in which he was again used as a middle-order batsman, and part-time spinner. [...] He retained his place for the one-day series against New Zealand, but had limited involvement, making 27runs from his two innings, though he did claim two wickets in his seven overs bowling.|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} {{the first}} day on the station, Shepherd {{requested}} the use of the radio call sign [...] "Alpha", which he and Krikalev preferred it to the more cumbersome [...] "International Space Station". The name [...] "Alpha" [...] had previously been used for the station in the early 90's, and following the request, its use was authorized for the whole of Expedition 1. Shepherd had been advocating the use of a new name to project managers for some time. Referencing a naval tradition in a pre-launch news conference he had said: [...] "For thousands of years, humans have been going to sea in ships. People have designed and built these vessels, launched them with <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>feeling</b> that a name will bring good fortune to the crew and success to their voyage." [...] Yuri Semenov, the President of Russian Space Corporation Energia at the time, disapproved of the name [...] "Alpha"; he felt that Mir was the first space station, and so he would have preferred the names [...] "Beta" [...] or [...] "Mir 2" [...] for the ISS.|$|E

500|$|Vincent Kartheiser, then 23, {{was looking}} for {{something}} more stable than the usual feature movies. He decided to audition after his agent sent him the role and tapes of all previous seasons. The producers wanted the character to be a surprise to audiences, so not even Kartheiser was informed that he was trying out for Angel's son. Instead he auditioned for a character created for the purpose of audition, ‘the Street Kid’, a normal teenager who had Angel as his guardian. [...] "Right away everyone kind of had <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>feeling</b> about me joining the cast," [...] Vincent says. [...] "It seemed that I just fit right in." [...] Kartheiser was excited after learning that his real role was 'Angel's son, a demon killer from Quor'toth.’ He was confused about his portrayal, thinking that the character was to have a [...] "living-in-the-brush kind of ‘failed being’ attitude." [...] Instead, he was told to just [...] "stand up straight, [...] normal voice," [...] and let a regular boy come on. Vincent Kartheiser was initially contracted for three episodes with an option to pick him up further.|$|E
2500|$|Tilders later {{worked with}} The Legends Band. During the 2000s he issued three more albums, One More Time – Live at St Andrews (2001), Highlights of Bob Barnard's Jazz Party (2003) and Mine & Some I Adopted (2005). Tilders {{described}} his concept {{for the latter}} album, [...] "he idea was to show-case what I love to do best, playing solo, without the restrictions of an ensemble". He categorised his style of music [...] "ome of it is not strictly blues but it has {{the basis of that}} genre. I like to think that the listener gets <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>feeling</b> and doesn't take me too seriously. I'm a little irreverent at times but tongue in cheek".|$|E
2500|$|On {{the final}} day, 3 wickets {{from each of}} Dominic Cork and Muttiah Muralitharan helped dismiss Worcestershire for 191 runs, with David Wigley unable to bat because of a broken hand {{sustained}} when James Anderson bowled a beamer {{at him in the}} first innings. After the match Cork talking about his match performance of 7 for 115 said, [...] "The ball is coming out well at the moment. I've worked hard with Mike Watkinson over the winter with it. It's early season and these sort of conditions suit a bowler like myself." [...] Watkinson, in response, spoke of Lancashire's determination to get straight back into the first Division after the disappointment of relegation last season, [...] ""We talked about {{the start of the season}} and the need to start well and to get a positive number in the wins column is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>feeling.</b> We have two home games now coming up against Derbyshire and Durham and maybe we can kick on from here." ...|$|E

It really does feel like there is a collective consciousness." ...|$|R
5000|$|Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert, {{gave the}} film {{one of its}} rare {{positive}} reviews, awarding it 3/4 stars and stating [...] "As I watched this sequel, <b>a</b> certain <b>good</b> <b>feeling</b> began to make itself known. Yes, the movie is unnecessary. However, it is unnecessary {{at a higher level}} of warmth and humor than the recent remake Yours, Mine, and Ours." [...] Ebert also highly praised Alyson Stoners performance, favorably comparing the then-twelve year old actress to Reese Witherspoon.|$|R
2500|$|Larry had {{expressed}} apprehension that day about performing the stunt. [...] Larry shared with Mondo {{that he did}} not have <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>feeling</b> about doing it, but he felt pressure to do it. [...] Bambi said that normally Larry did this stunt after the bigger stunts as [...] "his way of blowing off steam...winding down." [...] As Larry was performing the maneuver, something went wrong and the front end of his bike started to wobble. Rather than being able to jump down in the seat and regain control, Larry fell off the bike, hitting his head. [...] Larry sustained serious head injuries and he was airlifted to the Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte. [...] Indian Larry died from his injuries on Monday, August 30, 2004 at 3:30am. [...] He was 55 years old. [...] The last words that Larry uttered were to his wife Bambi (who was at the event) saying, [...] "Sweetie, sweetie." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1996, Miho Hatori and Yuka Honda of Cibo Matto {{were invited}} by Ono to remix the song [...] "Talking to the Universe" [...] for a Rising remix EP Rising Mixes. They met Lennon and {{invited him to}} join them on tour as a bass player. This {{eventually}} led to Lennon's contributing to their side-project Butter 08 and to his becoming {{a member of the}} group. He continued to play with them on tour, joining them on television and providing bass guitar and vocals on their EP Super Relax. Through his association with Cibo Matto, Lennon was approached by Adam Yauch (of Beastie Boys), who expressed an interest in his music and persuaded him to sign a record contract with Grand Royal Records. Regarding Grand Royal, Lennon has said:I think I found the only label on the planet who doesn't care who my parents are and what my name is. It's <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>feeling</b> to know that I wouldn't have gotten the offer if they wouldn't have liked my songs. That's pretty rare in the music business! ...|$|E
2500|$|The first {{resident}} crew, Expedition 1, {{arrived in}} November 2000 on Soyuz TM-31.

5000|$|BZN (Band Zonder Naam; Dutch for [...] "Band Without Name") was a {{successful}} Dutch pop group that had a string of hits from 1966 to 2007 on.

2500|$|The damage {{occurred}} {{when she was}} flying a mission over Baghdad on April 7, 2003. [...] "We did our job with the guys there on the ground, and as {{we were on our}} way out is when I felt the jet get hit. It was pretty obvious — it was loud... I lost all hydraulics instantaneously, and the jet rolled left and pointed toward the ground, which was an uncomfortable feeling over Baghdad. It didn't respond to any of my control inputs." [...] She tried several procedures to get the aircraft under control, none of which worked; last, she put the plane into manual reversion, meaning she was flying the aircraft without hydraulics. The aircraft immediately responded. [...] "The jet started climbing away from the ground, which was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>feeling</b> because there was no way I wanted to eject over Baghdad." [...] With some technical advice from her flight leader, Lieutenant Colonel Turner, she flew the injured plane for an hour back to the air base. [...] "The jet was performing exceptionally well. I had no doubt in my mind I was going to land that airplane." [...] Landing was tricky: [...] "When you lose all the hydraulics, you don't have speed brakes, you don't have brakes, and you don't have steering." ...|$|E
60|$|It seemed, however, to Cuthbert, {{watching}} narrowly {{what was}} going on, that there existed by no means <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>feeling</b> between {{the men of the}} different armies; and he thought that this divergence so early in the campaign boded but little good for the final success of the expedition.|$|E

6000|$|There was {{something}} wrong and something right in the boy's proposal to Marco, to conceal {{the loss of the}} bucket. His object was to befriend and help Marco in his distress. This was right. The means by which he proposed to accomplish the object were secrecy and fraud. This was wrong. Thus, the end which he had in view was a good one, and it evinced <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>feeling</b> in him; but the means for promoting it were criminal. Some persons have maintained that if the end is only right, it is of no consequence by what means we seek to promote it. Hence, they have had this maxim, viz., [...] "The end sanctifies the means." [...] But this maxim is not sound. The contrary principle is correct. It is sometimes expressed by this saying: [...] "We must not do evil that good may come;" [...] which is a much safer proverb to be guided by.|$|E
60|$|Between {{the four}} {{boys on the}} ship <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>feeling</b> existed. All had been chosen as a special favor, upon the {{recommendation}} of one or other of those in authority. Each of them had {{made up his mind}} that, one of these days, he, too, would command an expedition to the West Indies. Each thought of the glory which he would attain; and although, in the hearts of many of the elder men in the expedition, the substantial benefits to be reaped stood higher than any ideas of glory or honor; to the lads, at least, pecuniary gain exercised no inducement whatever. They burned to see the strange country, and to gain some of the credit and glory which would, if the voyage was successful, attach to each member of the crew. All were full of fun, and took what came to them, in the way of work, so good temperedly and cheerfully, that the men soon ceased to give them work for work's sake.|$|E
