With that directive, former {{director}} of soccer Mo Johnston hired Preki and made wholesale changes to the roster to reflect the U.S. Hall of Famer's plan to play a tough, defensive style. Despite scoring troubles, TFC played well at the start, going undefeated in seven games at one time. The team struggled following the World Cup break. Sensing problems in the locker room and to try to salvage the season, MLSE dismissed both Johnston and Preki on September 14, naming Earl Cochrane interim director of soccer and Nick Dasovic interim coach. The players responded to Dasovic's more open flexible style, but it wasn't enough as the club was eliminated from playoff contention with three games left in the season. Off-field issues with season-seat holders over the 2011 season ticket package added to the fans' frustrations, forcing MLSE to hold a series of town hall meetings.|$|E
5|$|Serbs who {{neglected}} {{to join the}} uprising were brutalized in equal measure. Males who could not produce an adequate excuse for why they were not fighting were killed and their houses torched. While most of the rebels were Serbs, the Pashalik's Romani (Gypsy) residents, the majority of whom were Muslim, also actively {{took part in the}} revolt. In 1806, the rebels twice dispatched the diplomat Petar Ičko to Constantinople to negotiate with the Porte. The two parties eventually reached an understanding, which {{came to be known as}} Ičko's Peace, in which the Ottomans agreed to grant the rebels extensive autonomy. Due to the Balkans' poor communications and transport infrastructure, it took several months for news of the Porte's offer to reach the rebels. In August 1806, the rebels defeated the Ottomans at the Battle of Mišar. Later that month, they scored another victory at the Battle of Deligrad. Smederevo was captured in November and made the capital of Karađorđe's revolutionary state. Belgrade, with the exception of its imposing fortress, fell in early December. The outbreak of the Russo-Ottoman War that month, compounded by Russia's avowal to provide extensive materiel and financial support to the rebels should they continue fighting, convinced Karađorđe not to accept <b>anything</b> <b>short</b> of complete independence. He promptly refused to accept the terms of the agreement negotiated by Ičko. In March 1807, Karađorđe issued a promise to Suleiman Pasha, the Governor of Belgrade, that he and his garrison would be granted safe passage if they vacated the city's besieged fortress. When Suleiman and his garrison emerged from the fortress, they were ambushed. Adult men were killed on the spot. Women and girls were converted to Christianity, and forced to marry or re-marry the men that had captured them, while children were placed in the care of Christian families. One contemporary account suggests that as many as 3,000 non-Christians – mostly Muslims, but also Jews – were converted. Jews that resisted conversion were either killed or expelled. The city's mosques were destroyed or turned into churches.|$|E

25|$|Jerusalem {{was still}} being rebuilt {{following}} the destruction caused by Titus in AD 70. Emperor Hadrian had built during the 130s a temple over the site of Jesus's tomb near Calvary, and renamed the city Aelia Capitolina. Accounts differ concerning whether the temple was dedicated to Venus or Jupiter. According to tradition, Helena ordered the temple torn down and, according to the legend that arose {{at the end of}} the 4th century, chose a site to begin excavating, which led to the recovery of three different crosses. The legend is recounted in Ambrose, On the Death of Theodosius (died 395) and at length in Rufinus' chapters appended to his translation into Latin of Eusebius' Ecclesiastical History, the main body of which does not mention the event. Then, Rufinus relates, the empress refused to be swayed by <b>anything</b> <b>short</b> of solid proof and performed a test. Possibly through Bishop Macarius of Jerusalem, she had a woman who was near death brought from the city. When the woman touched the first and second crosses, her condition did not change, but when she touched the third and final cross she suddenly recovered, and Helena declared the cross with which the woman had been touched to be the True Cross. On the site of discovery, Constantine ordered the building of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre; churches were also built on other sites detected by Helena. Sozomen and Theodoret claim that Helena also found the nails of the crucifixion. To use their miraculous power to aid her son, Helena allegedly had one placed in Constantine's helmet, and another in the bridle of his horse.|$|E

However, shorter dialysis is not a panacea and may engender trade-offs in terms of patient morbidity and mortality. We examine the literature with the ben-efit of hindsight and in light of recent studies that have improved understanding of the complex relationship between dialysis dose and outcome.

[...] The US naval attaché opined that, barring <b>anything</b> <b>short</b> of a revolution, the contracts would be given to the British.

500|$|Deryck Cooke {{argues that}} Mahler's {{popularity}} escalated when a new, postwar generation of music-lovers arose, untainted by [...] "the dated polemics of anti-romanticism" [...] which had affected Mahler's {{reputation in the}} inter-war years. In this more liberated age, enthusiasm for Mahler expanded even into places—Spain, France, Italy—which had long been resistant to him. Robert Carr's simpler explanation for the 1950s Mahler revival is that [...] "it was the long-playing record [...] rather than the Zeitgeist which made a comprehensive breakthrough possible. Mahler's work became accessible and repeatable in the home." [...] In the years following his centenary in 1960, Mahler rapidly {{became one of the}} most performed and most recorded of all composers, and has largely remained thus. In Britain and elsewhere, Carr notes, the extent of Mahler performances and recordings has replaced a relative famine with a glut, bringing problems of over-familiarity. Harold Schonberg comments that [...] "it is hard to think of a composer who arouses equal loyalty," [...] adding that [...] "a response of <b>anything</b> <b>short</b> of rapture to the Mahler symphonies will bring [...] long letters of furious denunciation." ...|$|E

500|$|Nuclear {{physicists}} {{knew about}} fission, {{but not the}} hydrodynamics of conventional explosions. As a result, there were two additions to the team that made significant contributions {{in this area of}} physics. First was James Tuck whose field of expertise was in shaped charges used in anti tank weapons for armour piercing. In terms of the plutonium bomb the scientists at Los Alamos were trying to wrestle with the idea of the implosion issue. Tuck was sent to Los Alamos in April 1944 and used a radical concept of explosive lensing which was then put into place. Tuck also designed the Urchin initiator for the bomb working closely with Seth Neddermeyer. This work was crucial {{to the success of the}} plutonium atomic bomb: Italian-American scientist Bruno Rossi later stated that without Tuck's work the plutonium bomb could not have exploded in August 1945. The other was Sir Geoffrey Taylor, an important consultant who arrived a month later to also work on the issue. Taylor's presence was desired so much at Los Alamos, Chadwick informed London, [...] "that <b>anything</b> <b>short</b> of kidnapping would be justified". He was sent, and provided crucial insights into the Rayleigh–Taylor instability. The acute need for scientists with an understanding of explosives also led Chadwick to obtain the release of William Penney from the Admiralty, and William Marley from the Road Research Laboratory. Peierls and Fuchs worked on the hydrodynamics of the explosive lenses. Bethe considered Fuchs [...] "one of the most valuable men in my division" [...] and [...] "one of the best theoretical physicists we had." ...|$|E
500|$|The Man-Eating Myth was {{reviewed}} by Ivan Brady for the American Anthropologist journal. He {{noted that the}} framework for Arens' scepticism was not coherent and was never spelled out explicitly in the text, even {{if it could be}} deduced from reading the entirety of the work. Brady sees this framework as an [...] "unsophisticated" [...] version of positivism and naturalism, an approach that he laments was becoming increasingly popular in anthropology. Casting a critical eye over Arens' scepticism, he admits to being perplexed as to why only [...] "direct observation" [...] will do as evidence, pondering whether Arens would accept <b>anything</b> <b>short</b> of affidavits by practicing cannibals as evidence for the practice. Brady notes that there are other activities in the world that surely go on [...] such as masturbation in monasteries and homosexual activity in the armed forces [...] but that these would be hidden by a veil of secrecy and therefore difficult to observe directly, suggesting that the same may be true for cannibalism. Moving on, Brady attacks Arens' criticism of anthropology, believing that he has constructed a straw man argument by comparing the early accounts of travellers to the later, 20th-century accounts of anthropologists, and lambasts him for portraying himself as an objective figure in the debate. He argues that in cases such as that of the Carib people, the evidence for cannibalism is [...] "indeterminate", rather than negative, as Arens believes. Concluding his review, Brady admits that he agrees with Arens' premise that socially accepted cannibalism is not as globally widespread as some anthropologists have suggested, but disagreed that anthropologists have been as [...] "reckless" [...] in their claims as Arens charges them with, and furthermore disagrees with Arens' suggestion that the cause can be blamed on poor observation standards.|$|E
