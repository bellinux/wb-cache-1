40|$|Although in practice, {{there are}} many ways of {{arriving}} at a price, these can be reduced for simplicity to two basic methods namely, cost-oriented and demand-oriented price determination. Cost-oriented pricing is typical in the real world. Accounting systems can estimate or accumulate the costs of doing particular tasks and profit – and – loss statements show very clearly that all costs should be covered. Costs provide a floor which prices cannot go (for long anywhere) and it is only logical that prices should be built on seemingly precise cost data. Cost-oriented pricing is not as simple or full-proof as it might seem at first glance. The analytical tools presented can improve cost-oriented pricing but management judgment is still required. Price determination is a serious matter that deserves careful study. The discussion shall begin by examining how most firms, including retailers and wholesalers set oriented prices.

5000|$|The term [...] "lower of cost or market" [...] is now {{obsolete}} and {{is officially}} replaced by [...] "lower of cost and net realizable value." [...] According to the FASB Accounting Standards Update, [...] "An entity should measure inventory {{within the scope}} of this Update at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation." [...] This FASB update makes usage consistent with the IFRS wording and removes the use of [...] "or" [...] in a context where [...] "and" [...] was always the correct one. However, the update does not apply to all companies. Companies that use the FIFO (first-in, first-out) and <b>average-cost</b> <b>methods</b> of inventory valuation are required to implement the changes, whereas companies that use the LIFO (last-in, first-out) and retail inventory methods are not affected by the update.|$|R
40|$|Development impact {{fees are}} {{one-time}} charges applied {{to offset the}} additional public-service costs of new development. They are usually applied {{at the time a}} building permit is issued and are dedicated to provision of additional services, such as water and sewer systems, roads, schools, libraries, and parks and recreation facilities, made necessary by the presence of new residents in the area. The funds collected cannot be used for operation, maintenance, repair, alteration, or replacement of existing capital facilities and cannot just be added to general revenue. They are essentially user fees levied in anticipation of use, expanding the capacity of existing services to handle additional demand. The amount of the fee must be clearly linked to the added service cost, not some arbitrary amount. There are two basic approaches to setting impact fees — the <b>average-cost</b> pricing <b>method</b> that sets a flat connection fee an...|$|R
