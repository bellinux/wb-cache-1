5|$|In January 2001, when no {{contestant}} had won $1 {{million in}} any show that aired {{over a period}} of five months, the top prize was then changed from a flat $1 million to an accumulating jackpot that increased by $10,000 for each episode where the top prize was not won. On April 10, 2001, Kevin Olmstead correctly answered the final question and won $2,180,000, making him the biggest winner in television history at the time. The top prize for correctly answering the final question returned to $1 million following Olmstead's win and has remained unchanged since; just five days after Olmstead's win, the standard $1 million prize was awarded to Bernie Cullen. The last top prize winner on the original network version was Ed Toutant, on the episode aired September 7, 2001; he had previously appeared on the episode aired January 31, 2001 when the jackpot was $1,860,000, where he was ruled to have <b>answered</b> <b>his</b> $16,000 question incorrectly, but when it was discovered that there was a mistake in that question, Toutant was invited back and won the $1,860,000 jackpot. On the Super Millionaire spin-off, Robert Essig won $1,000,000 after answering the twelfth question and then walked away, not reaching the final question for $10,000,000.|$|E

25|$|John Brown (1800–1859), an {{abolitionist}} {{who considered}} slavery to be a sin, led an anti-slavery movement in Kansas and hoped to arm slaves and lead a violent revolt against slavery. With 18 armed men on October 16–17, 1859, he took hostages and freed slaves in Harpers Ferry, but no slaves <b>answered</b> <b>his</b> call and instead local militia surrounded Brown {{and his men}} in a firehouse. The President sent in a unit of U.S. Marines led by Robert E. Lee; they stormed the firehouse and took Brown prisoner. Brown was convicted of treason against the state of Virginia and hanged.|$|E
25|$|Duchovny has guest hosted Saturday Night Live twice (May 13, 1995 and May 9, 1998). Both {{shows were}} season finales. In 2000 he {{starred in the}} feature film Return to Me, a romantic comedy/drama {{directed}} by Bonnie Hunt and co-starring Minnie Driver and Carroll O'Connor. In 2001, Duchovny starred as Ira Kane in the sci-fi comedy film Evolution, alongside Seann William Scott, and had a cameo as hand model J.P. Prewitt in the Ben Stiller comedy Zoolander. He appeared in a celebrity edition of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? in May 2000. He got to the $250,000 question, but <b>answered</b> <b>his</b> $500,000 question incorrectly and lost $218,000, leaving him with $32,000. He appeared on Celebrity Jeopardy! in 1995 and 2010.|$|E
25|$|Open {{rebellion}} against Stjepan Kosača {{broke out in}} March 1452. Vladislav, along {{with his mother and}} grandmother, raised an army and took control over most of his father's territory. Thomas, Vladislav's king and brother-in-law, <b>answered</b> <b>his</b> call for help and arrived with his army the following month. Ragusa joined them too. King Thomas proved reluctant to attack, however, and soon went back north to ward off a Turkish incursion. Kosača seized the opportunity to enlist help from Venice, which took Drijeva from Vladislav, and to entice uprisings against the rebels themselves. Thomas returned, as he had promised, chasing out Venetians from Drijeva and easily defeating his brother-in-law's enemies. The coalition then suddenly fell apart {{when it became clear that}} Vladislav would not hand over parts of his patrimony which Thomas claimed as his due, namely Drijeva and Blagaj, which was the Kosača seat and the key to Zachlumia.|$|E

25|$|Although {{there were}} still {{concerns}} about Cook's form and technique ahead of the 2010-11 Ashes series, Cook <b>answered</b> <b>his</b> critics {{in the best way}} possible. Following a century in one of the warm-up games, Cook opened his series account with 67 as England won the toss and batted at the Gabba in Brisbane. After surrendering a first-innings deficit of 221, Cook fought back with fellow-opener Strauss and Jonathan Trott. Strauss scored 110 as England scored 188 for the first wicket. With this partnership, Cook and Strauss became England's highest scoring opening partners across their four years together, beating an eighty-year-old record set by Jack Hobbs and Herbert Sutcliffe; albeit taking 44 more innings to do so. Cook was joined by Trott and they scored an unbeaten partnership of 329; Cook recorded his first double-century in first-class cricket, finishing on 235 not out, and Trott scored 135 not out before England declared on 517–1. Cook's 235* overtook Don Bradman's record score at the ground and several other records were set in that innings.|$|E

In an attempt to excite the crowd, Pinky Downs, a 1906 Texas A graduate and member of the school's Board of Regents, asked the crowd [...] "What {{are we going to do}} to those Horned Frogs?"

500|$|Late in 1095, Pope Urban II (died 1099) first proclaimed {{an armed}} pilgrimage, or penitential holy war, {{that led to}} the First Crusade of 10961102. Before the end of the year, tens of {{thousands}} of men, women, and children <b>answered</b> <b>his</b> call to re-establish Christian control of Jerusalem. The particular terminology employed by the Chronicle of Mannthat Lǫgmaðr departed the kingdom [...] "marked with the sign of the Lord's cross"suggests that he participated in a crusade. On the other hand, since the chronicle was compiled in the thirteenth century, during a period when the idea of a cross-bearing pilgrim was well established, it is possible that this depiction of Lǫgmaðr has been contaminated by anachronistic conceptions.|$|E
500|$|Douglas H. Erwin, {{reviewing}} {{the book for}} Artificial Life, noted that life forms from fruit flies to humans have far fewer genes than many biologists expected – human beings have only some 20,000. [...] "How could humans, in all our diversity of cell types and complexity of neurons, require essentially {{the same number of}} genes as a fly, or worse, a worm (the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans)?" [...] asks Erwin. He <b>answered</b> <b>his</b> own question about the [...] "astonishing morphological diversity" [...] of animals coming from [...] "such a limited number of genes", praising Carroll's [...] "insightful and enthusiastic" [...] style, writing in a [...] "witty and engaging" [...] way, pulling the reader into the complexities of Hox and PAX-6, as well as celebrating the Cambrian explosion of life forms and much else.|$|E
500|$|In August 1811, Tecumseh again {{met with}} Harrison at Vincennes. Tecumseh assured Harrison that the Shawnee {{brothers}} meant {{to remain at}} peace with the United States. Tecumseh traveled to the Southeast {{on a mission to}} recruit allies among the [...] "Five Civilized Tribes". [...] Most of the southern nations rejected his appeals, but a faction of the Creek, who {{came to be known as}} the Red Sticks, <b>answered</b> <b>his</b> call to arms. They led the Creek War, an internal war among factions that were divided over adoption of some European-American ways. This became a part of the War of 1812, as the Red Sticks opposed the United States. By contrast, the Creek of the Lower Towns were more integrated with American culture and supported the US against Britain.|$|E

500|$|Aggies {{today will}} often end public {{addresses}} and emails to other Aggies with a hearty [...] "Thanks and Gig 'em!". The [...] "Gig 'em" [...] tradition began at a 1930 Midnight Yell Practice held before {{the football game}} against the Texas Christian University Horned Frogs. In an attempt to excite the crowd, Pinky Downs, a 1906 Texas A graduate {{and member of the}} school's Board of Regents, asked [...] "What {{are we going to do}} to those Horned Frogs?" [...] Using a term for frog hunting, he <b>answered</b> <b>his</b> own question, [...] "Gig 'em, Aggies!" [...] For emphasis, he made a fist with the thumb extended. The phrase and hand signal proved popular, and it became the first hand sign of the Southwest Conference. Gig 'em is also the name of one of the school yells, which is used during football kickoffs.|$|E
500|$|On September 9, {{two days}} before the Iraq {{commanding}} General David Petraeus addressed the Senate, Biden stated that, [...] "I really respect him, and I think he's dead flat wrong [...] ". He criticized the president, arguing, [...] "This president has no plan – how to win and/or how to leave". During the September 11 testimony by the General, Biden stated that the question to be asked to determine progress was [...] "Are we any closer to a lasting political settlement in Iraq at the national level today than we were when the surge began eight months ago?" [...] He <b>answered</b> <b>his</b> own question by stating [...] "In my judgment, I must tell you, based on my experience and my observation here, as well as in-country, the answer to... questions is no."

500|$|Houllier was {{disappointed}} with Liverpool's start and noticed his players {{struggled with the}} humidity.

[...] Houllier revealed he gave a frank assessment of the task facing his players before the match; although in his words Arsenal were [...] "...probably a bit better than us, probably more mature, more experienced, more ability in some areas," [...] dealing with setbacks would make the difference on the day. He dismissed accusations that Liverpool were boring, rather describing his team as difficult to beat. Owen, the match winner, felt he <b>answered</b> <b>his</b> critics by scoring left-footed: [...] "It's nice to prove people wrong when they say you haven't got a left foot. I {{was supposed to be the}} worst header and the worst player with my left foot in the league, and how could an England player play when they haven't got a left foot.... It does go to show that I have improved and I am improving." ...|$|E

500|$|After the {{election}} was called in April 1957 for 10 June, Howe raised sufficient money to enable the Liberals to heavily outspend their opponents. [...] As there were few Liberal ministers from western Canada, Howe was called upon to make appearances throughout the region. He found that the Manitoba Farmers Union was organizing opposition to the Liberals; at some meetings Howe had difficulty getting heard at all. At other meetings, Howe engaged in well publicised conflicts with audience members. On 19 May in Morris, Manitoba, Howe told one man demanding to speak that when his own party held a meeting, he could ask all the questions he wanted. The man, Bruce Mackenzie, {{proved to be the}} head of a local Liberal association. As Howe left, another man asked why he had not <b>answered</b> <b>his</b> question, posed earlier. Howe replied, [...] "Look here, my good man, when {{the election}} comes, why don't you go away and vote for the party you support? [...] In fact, why don't you just go away?" [...] At another meeting a few days later, Howe was asked why he did not care about the farmers's economic plight. [...] "Looks like you've been eating pretty well under a Liberal government", Howe replied, poking the questioner in the midsection.|$|E
500|$|On 11 September 2014, {{as part of}} the {{coverage}} of the Scottish independence referendum, Nick Robinson had a dispute with Scottish National Party leader Alex Salmond. The previous day Robinson had reported that Lloyds Bank and RBS would be moving their registered offices from Scotland to London {{in the event of a}} [...] "Yes" [...] vote. In the exchange Robinson asked Salmond two questions: the first about the economic impact of RBS moving its headquarters; the second, more general, about why to trust a politician when CEO's of certain companies advised against independence. In his response, Salmond made points about how the BBC had obtained market-sensitive information. A report was shown on all BBC evening news programmes later that day as part of which Robinson stated Salmond had not <b>answered</b> <b>his</b> question but had instead chosen to lay accusations against the BBC. The BBC received complaints from viewers over the implication that Salmond had not answered a question put to him; there was a protest in Glasgow, in which between 1000 and 2000 protestors called for Robinson to be sacked. The BBC responded: [...] "The BBC considers that the questions were valid and the overall report balanced and impartial, in line with our editorial guidelines.|$|E
