5|$|Following in {{the path}} paved by {{linguist}} Noam Chomsky, Fodor developed <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> the idea of psychological nativism. Nativism postulates the innateness of many cognitive functions and concepts. For Fodor, this position emerges naturally out of his criticism of behaviourism and associationism.

5|$|The Republic of Ireland {{has shown}} <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> {{renewable}} energy, ranking {{as one of}} the top 10 markets for cleantech investment in the 2014 Global Green Economy Index. Research and development in Ireland in renewable energy such as wind power has increased since 2004. Large wind farms are being constructed in coastal counties such as Cork, Donegal, Mayo and Antrim. The construction of wind farms has in some cases been delayed by opposition from local communities, some of whom overall consider the wind turbines to be unsightly. The Republic of Ireland is also hindered by an ageing network that was not designed to handle the varying availability of power that comes from wind farms. The ESB's Turlough Hill facility is the only power-storage facility in the state.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between voluntary participation in environmental organisations and the justifiability of littering behaviour. Previous empirical work regarding determinants of littering and littering behaviour remains scarce, particularly in socio-economic analysis. We address these deficiencies, demonstrating <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> empirical link between environmental participation and reduced public littering in the European Values Survey (EVS) data for 30 Western and Eastern European countries. The results suggest that membership in environmental organisations is related <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> anti-littering behaviour, thereby supporting improved environmental quality...|$|R
30|$|European elites have an {{intellectual}} and emotional <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> {{the idea of}} “Europe” {{that is not necessarily}} mirrored in their national citizenries.

Since then, the country has made some progress with regard to improving access to water supply: It reached universal access to an improved water source in urban areas, and in rural areas the share of those with access increased from 66% to 79% from 1990 to 2010.|$|E

25|$|The Southern Railway had <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> electrification. The intensively used {{commuter}} {{system in}} a relatively small geographical area made the Southern a natural candidate for electrification. After the Grouping, the LSWR's 660V DC third rail system was adopted for the whole region. LSWR metro area was initially electrified, soon followed by conversion LBSCR's 6.6kV AC Overhead electrified London Metro lines and then the SECR's metro lines around London in the 1920s. The 1930s saw mainline electrification of the Brighton Main Line and the Portsmouth Direct Line with associated several surround lines (such as the East and West Coastways). Outer suburban electrification was also extensive (e.g. to Gillingham, Maidstone, etc.). Proposal existed for further to the Kent Coast but the war halted these plans. Originally, only electric multiple unit trains were used, but later electric locomotives and electro-diesel hybrids were developed.|$|E

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{environmental}} practices on firm performance raises an ongoing debate {{in which the}} review of the existing literature yields no conclusive results. Different methods have been used to study this relationship and most of the analyses have focused on manufacturing companies. This paper examines the link between environmental practices and firm performance in the Spanish hotel industry using two methods: a cluster analysis and a regression analysis. First, three groups were defined according to their environmental proactivity, and hotels showing <b>a</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> environmental practices proved to reach higher performance levels.

In 1824, the Canadian government had passed legislation authorizing fabrique schools. He urged the pastors {{to take advantage of}} this law and to set up schools as part of their parishes. In this way, he hoped to form the mind of the next generation in <b>a</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>to</b> the Catholic faith. He set up a school for this purpose, also in his official residence. Within a year, it was educating some 80 children. He founded a second school at a separate location.|$|R
