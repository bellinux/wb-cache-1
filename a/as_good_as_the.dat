5|$|As the {{war began}} to draw to a close, the ships of Battleship Division Nine {{remained}} busy. With frequent gunnery drill, the ships showed marked improvement in performance compared to the early days with the Fleet. The average spread for the whole division, including the newcomers Texas and Arkansas, was now less than , which was much better than previously, if still not <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> British average.|$|E

You didn't care {{if they were in}} time with the dance steps or whether one was {{overweight}} or one wasn't <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> others. It was something more. It just made you feel happy. Like great pop records.|$|E
5|$|An {{average of}} 23.2 million viewers in the United Kingdom watched the event, with an {{estimated}} 750 million worldwide. Critics were generally positive, but noted {{that it was not}} <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> opening ceremony. Some of the foreign reviews questioned whether everyone would have understood the nods to British film and television. George Michael was roundly criticised for his song choice while Kate Moss, Naomi Campbell and Russell Brand were criticised for not demonstrating the Olympic ethos in their past behaviour. Some performers were initially reluctant to appear, and other high-profile acts turned down invitations to perform at the ceremony. NBC in the United States and Prime TV in New Zealand were criticised by viewers for their broadcasts of the ceremony. There was also a concert in Hyde Park to close the Olympics, featuring Blur, New Order, and The Specials.|$|E

5|$|In the Northern Territory, P. fimbriata has {{no special}} tactics against other jumping spiders {{and tries to}} treat {{them as if they}} were web spiders, and then either tries to jump on them or gives up. Hence this variant is poor at {{catching}} other jumping spiders. The Northern Territory variant of P. fimbriata is not <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Queensland one as catching web spiders, but better than the Sri Lanka variant and some other species of Portia. It is not enthusiastic about pursuing insects, but very good at catching those it pursues, as the performance table above shows While pursuits by the Queensland variant typically take 26minutes, those of the Northern Territory variant typically take 3 to 5minutes, like some other species of Portia.|$|E
5|$|Resident Evil 3 was {{released}} for the Microsoft Windows and Dreamcast platforms in 2000, featuring enhanced 3D character models and higher resolution graphics. The Dreamcast version includes more alternate costumes {{than in the}} PlayStation version. Critical reception for these ports was not as positive. The Microsoft Windows version was criticized for not being optimized for keyboard and mouse and for not letting players save their progress at any time. Critics noted {{that some of the}} pre-rendered backgrounds in the Dreamcast version of the game were not improved, resulting in them looking not <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> PlayStation version's due to the Dreamcast's higher graphic fidelity. CVC generally praised the Dreamcast version, but admitted that the difference in graphical quality between Resident Evil 3 and Code: Veronica was very large.|$|E
5|$|The {{effectiveness}} of the system was determined not by how long a sensor would last in the field, but by the adequacy of coverage by a particular string of sensors. For instance, a well placed string with several failed sensors was more effective than a fully functional string placed in the wrong location. The electronic data was, however, only <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> human analysts and operators at the ISC. The knack of timely sensor activation depended on careful study of device locations and the patterns of PAVN logistical behavior.|$|E

5|$|In December 1939, Massey {{joined a}} {{group at the}} Admiralty Research Laboratory in Teddington led by Stephen Butterworth. They were soon joined {{by a number of}} other physicists, {{including}} Bates, Buckingham, Francis Crick and John Gunn. Together, they came up with a series of countermeasures that enable the Navy to successfully sweep the mines. With this in hand, Massey became Deputy Chief Scientist to the Scientific Section of Mine Design Department at the Admiralty Mining Establishment in Havant in early 1941. This time, the job was to create mines <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> German ones. Massey brought his team with him. While Bates worked on packaging to protect the mine when it was dropped from an aircraft, Buckingham and Gunn calculated its theoretical effectiveness, and Crick designed the circuitry. Their mine codenamed MX, was soon in service, and the group turned its attention to developing acoustic or pressure mines. On the retirement of A. B. Wood in 1943, Massey became Chief Scientist at Havant.|$|E
5|$|Neuner's {{shooting}} performances {{have been}} a regular topic in the German media. At times she {{has been reluctant to}} discuss her shooting in interviews and has said the public's fixation on it contributes to the problem. She has insisted her difficulties in the standing position are not due to technical weaknesses but psychological, and her training results are just <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> results of her team mates. She explained in interviews that she had developed a fear of the standing shooting over time, knowing she had to justify herself after the race if she missed. In 2008, Neuner trained with Bundeswehr shooting coach and former large calibre world champion, Rudi Krenn, and subsequently changed her stance slightly. Since 2009, she has worked with a psychologist, primarily focusing on mental techniques to build her confidence on the shooting range. Her standing position average has improved from 60% to 75% from 2008 to 2011. Neuner has been wearing ear plugs during some of the races in order to better concentrate while shooting. The individual race, which places a high emphasis on shooting, has traditionally been her worst discipline (each shooting error results in a one-minute time penalty, instead of a penalty loop).|$|E
5|$|Quatermass II {{received}} positive newspaper {{reviews in}} the Daily Mail and the Daily Express, although the BBC's Radio Times listings magazine published letters of both praise and criticism for the serial. The serial was also criticised internally at the BBC by Cecil McGivern, who felt {{it to be}} not <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> original. One letter received by the production team before the transmission of episode five came from a woman in Haverfordwest who was concerned {{that she would never}} find out what happened in the end as the week before the final episode's transmission she was due to move to Ireland {{to spend the rest of}} her life in a convent; she wondered if the BBC could possibly write to her and let her know how the story resolved. After some debate as to whether the letter was a journalistic trick to uncover advance story details, Kneale eventually decided that it was genuine, and allowed Cartier to send a reply outlining the storyline's conclusion. Following episode six, some viewers wrote in to the BBC concerned at Quatermass's survival, as he had not been seen to definitely return to Earth in the experimental rocket ship.|$|E

50|$|Three {{generations of}} VNTR typing for M. {{tuberculosis}} are noted. The first scheme, called exact tandem repeat, used only five loci, but the resolution afforded by these five loci was not <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> PFGE. <b>The</b> second scheme, called mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit, had discrimination <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> PFGE. <b>The</b> third generation (mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit - 2) added a further nine loci {{to bring the}} total to 24. This provides a degree of resolution greater than PFGE and is currently the standard for typing M. tuberculosis. However, with regard to archaeological remains, additional evidence may be required because of possible contamination from related soil bacteria.|$|R

WinTPC is available for software assurance customers and relies on cloud computing in a business network. Wireless operation is supported since WinTPC has full wireless stack integration, but wireless operation may not be <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> operation on a wired connection.|$|E

25|$|The 1904 {{club was}} almost <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> {{previous}} year's team, {{but due to}} the emergence of the New York Highlanders as a strong contender, the Americans found themselves in a tight pennant race through the last games of the season. Foreshadowing what would eventually become a storied rivalry, the 1904 race featured such controversial moves as the trade of Patsy Dougherty to the Highlanders for Bob Unglaub.|$|E
25|$|The {{games have}} also {{received}} generally positive reviews, both in Japan and the West. Critics have enjoyed the story, {{the music and}} visuals, and {{the implementation of the}} gameplay elements within the visual novel presentation, although some have noted how it is complicated and difficult to unlock certain routes. An Anime News Network writer said that the series has well-paced mysteries and uses creative concepts, but that the conclusions often are not <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> set-ups.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} was designed {{in response to}} a Polish Air Force requirement of 1933 for a new army cooperation plane, a successor of the Lublin R-XIII. The RWD team of the DWL workshops (Doświadczalne Warsztaty Lotnicze) initially proposed the RWD-12 project, based on the RWD-8 trainer. It was however considered as not <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> R-XIII, and was not built. Another aircraft, the RWD-14 was designed by Stanislaw Rogalski and Jerzy Drzewiecki instead. Designer Tadeusz Chyliński prepared its technical documentation.|$|E

We use monthly US data and predict multiperiod returns over 1, 3, and 5 years with long-horizon regressions. In-sample regressions show that money growth {{is useful for}} predicting returns. Higher recent money growth has a significantly negative effect on subsequent returns of the S&P 500.

25|$|The {{game was}} criticised for its {{technical}} issues. Carter called its climbing animations stiff, noting that some gameplay bugs would hinder player progress. According to Wallace, the game's load times were too long. Leack {{noted that the}} game had a graphic downgrade, and the actual game did not look <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> 2013 demonstration. Senior, Phipps and Ingenito noted frame rate issues; although Ingenito thought it did not impact the gameplay, Phipps called it a persistent problem which overshadowed many of the game's achievements.|$|E
25|$|The boatmen (usually {{with their}} families) were a rough {{independent}} lot, forming a class within themselves, and intermarrying {{within their own}} group. They frequently fought amongst each other for any reason, be it racial slurs (real or perceived), precedence at a lock, or for exercise. They fought with lockkeepers over company rules, or even with the company for changes in toll rates. During winter when the boats were tied up, they often lived {{in their own communities}} away from others. One boat captain observed that on the canal, women and children were <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> men, and if weren't for the children, the canal wouldn't run one day.|$|E
25|$|On 7 September, the {{government}} issued {{a warning that}} the invasion could be expected {{within the next few}} days and, that night, Bomber Command attacked the Channel ports and supply dumps. On 13 September, they carried out another large raid on the Channel ports, sinking 80 large barges in the port of Ostend. 84 barges were sunk in Dunkirk after another raid on 17 September and by 19 September, almost 200 barges had been sunk. The loss of these barges may have contributed to Hitler's decision to postpone Operation Sea Lion indefinitely. The success of these raids was in part because the Germans had few Freya radar stations set up in France, so that air defences of the French harbours were not nearly <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> air defences over Germany; Bomber Command had directed some 60% of its strength against the Channel ports.|$|E
