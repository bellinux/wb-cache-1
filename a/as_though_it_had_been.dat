500|$|The name Shaw {{is derived}} from the Old English word sceaga, meaning [...] "wood". The name Crompton is also of Old English derivation, from the words crom or crumb, meaning [...] "bent" [...] or [...] "crooked", and ton, for [...] "hamlet or village". A local {{historian}} stated that [...] "this name aptly describes the appearance of the place, with its uneven surface, its numerous mounds and hills, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> crumpled up to form these ridges". The University of Nottingham's Institute for Name-Studies has offered the suggestion that the name Crompton means [...] "river-bend settlement", which may reflect Crompton's location on a meander of the River Beal.|$|E
500|$|In {{the final}} {{act of the}} show, Jack conspires with {{the cast and crew}} to give Liz a last-minute {{birthday}} surprise which he wants to appear <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> planned all along. Meanwhile, Carol safely lands his plane and rushes to greet Liz on set. All they can muster on short notice is a polka band and a large cake with Fonzie on it—gifts that were intended to celebrate janitor Jadwiga's birthday. She proceeds to ruin the TGS goodnights and tear into the cake with her bare hands. In Jack's office, Liz and Jack share a drink as Liz's birthday wish. In the final scene, as Jack takes a drink, the program reverts to a pre-recorded segment and Jack says, [...] "That's more like it." [...] The episode ends with a live goodnight from the TGS stage by the cast of the episode, a la Saturday Night Live.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} the first to be filmed, in September 2010. It was mainly filmed on a council estate in Bath, Somerset, while the scenes in the dollhouse were filmed in Dyrham Park. The Bristol estate was chosen because of its [...] "crisp architecture". The country house of Dyrham Park was chosen because of its {{staircase}} and checked flooring. The antiques were stripped out of the building and replaced with [...] "child-like" [...] furniture that was placed to look <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> played with. Several designs of the dolls were made, trying to achieve the desired balance of a normal doll and a scarier, more [...] "crude"-looking one. The actors portraying the dolls were choreographed to move with stiff legs but swing their arms. In the scene in which Alex and the Doctor are in the kitchen they open and close the fridge as they are talking; this was not in the script, but improvised by Smith and Mays on set. Mays was invited to guest-star in the episode, and was drawn to the story because of the family element; he has a young son like George. The scene in which Purcell sinks into the carpet was filmed with actor Andrew Tiernan on a hydraulic platform that lowered him into green-coloured liquid.|$|E

500|$|... "spices, drugs, silks, calicos, quilts, {{carpets and}} colors, [...] The spices were pepper, cloves, maces, nutmegs, {{cinnamon}} and greene ginger: the drugs were benjamin, frankincense, Galangal, mirabilis, aloes zocotrina, camphire: the silks, damasks, taffatas, alto bassos, that is, counterfeit, [...] cloth of gold, unwrought China silk, sleeved silk, white twisted silk, curled cypresse. The calicos were book-calicos, calico-launes, broad white calicos, fine starched calicoes, course white calicos, brown broad calicos, brown course calicos. There were also canopies, and course diapertowels, quilts of course sarcenet and of calico, carpets {{like those of}} Turky; whereunto are to be added the pearl, muske, civet, and amber-griece. The rest of the wares were many in number, but less in value; as elephants teeth, porcelain vessels of China, coco-nuts, hides, [...] ebenwood as black as jet, bested of the same, cloth of the rind's of trees very strange for the matter, and artificial in workmanship". There was also a rutter and a document, printed at Macau in 1590, containing valuable information on the China and Japan trade; Hakluyt observed that it was [...] "enclosed {{in a case of}} sweet Cedar wood, and lapped up almost an hundredfold in fine Calicut-cloth, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> some incomparable jewel".|$|E
500|$|Louis Dow {{had died}} in 1944, with Frances Hand at his side. The Hands' {{marriage}} then entered its final, happiest phase, in which they rediscovered their first love. Former law clerks have provided intimate details of Hand's character {{during the last decade}} of his life. Legal philosopher Ronald Dworkin recalls that Hand, scrupulous about public economy, used to turn out the lights in all the offices {{at the end of each}} day. For the same reason, he refused Dworkin the customary month's paid vacation at the end of his service. Shortly afterward, to Dworkin's surprise, Hand wrote him a personal check for an extra month's pay as a wedding present. Hand was known for his explosive temper. Gunther remembers him throwing a paperweight in his direction which narrowly missed. Hand had a habit of turning his seat 180° on lawyers whose arguments annoyed him, and he could be bitingly sarcastic. In a typical memo, he wrote, [...] "This is the most miserable of cases, but we must dispose of it <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> presented by actual lawyers." [...] Despite such outbursts, Hand was deeply insecure throughout his life, as he fully recognized. In his 80s, he still fretted about his rejection by the elite social clubs at Harvard College. He was convinced that his wife had rescued him from a life as a [...] "melancholic, a failure [...] I should have thought myself so, and probably single and hopelessly hypochondriac".|$|E
2500|$|The film's {{musical score}} was {{composed}} by Giovanni Fusco, who had scored all of Antonioni's films {{up to that}} time. Antonioni usually only used diegetic music in his films {{and this was one}} of the last times that he (briefly) included a musical score for scenes other than during the credits. For L'avventura, Antonioni asked Fusco to compose [...] "jazz <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> written in the Hellenic era." ...|$|E

2500|$|Much like Germany, Austria {{was divided}} into American, British, French, and Soviet zones and governed by the Allied Commission for Austria. As {{forecast}} in the Moscow Declaration in 1943, [...] a subtle difference {{was seen in the}} treatment of Austria by the Allies. The Austrian government, consisting of Social Democrats, Conservatives, and Communists (until 1947), and residing in Vienna, which was surrounded by the Soviet zone, was recognised by the Western Allies in October 1945 after some doubts that Renner could be Stalin's puppet. Thus, the creation of a separate Western Austrian government and the division of the country was avoidable. Austria, in general, was treated <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> originally invaded by Germany and liberated by the Allies.|$|E
2500|$|Houses loom {{large in}} Bowen's work (as {{is evident in}} Bowen Court, her 1946 book memorialising her ancestral house, Bowen Court, one of the Irish great houses, which {{she was forced to}} sell and which was {{subsequently}} demolished) and in The House in Paris the main setting is the house where Naomi and Mme Fisher live, which is characterised as full, stuffy, and oppressive: [...] "The inside of this house—with its shallow door-panels, lozenge door-knobs, polished brass ball {{on the end of the}} banisters, stuffy red matt paper with stripes so artfully shadowed as to appear bars—was more than simply novel to Henrietta, it was antagonistic, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> invented to put her out. [...] She felt the house was acting, nothing seemed to be natural; objects did not wait to be seen but came crowding in on her, each with what amounted to its aggressive cry." [...] Naomi's deceased aunt's home in Twickenham is similarly described, though there is a suggestion of future redemption: [...] "the aunt's house was hollow, completely dead. But someone else would move in almost at once, and be here next spring, no doubt, to enjoy the cherry." [...] A third house is the home of Colonel and Violet Bent lived in Rushbrook, the house in Ireland that Karen briefly visited before returning to the Michaelis home in Chester Terrace, Regent's Park, London. But that Irish home is itself a replacement of an earlier great house, the ancestral home of Colonel Bent, which was burned during the Irish War of Independence.|$|E

60|$|The {{vision was}} vouchsafed them, steeped in an {{immaterial}} splendor, for perhaps five minutes, and then <b>it</b> faded <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> never been. Miss Austerly, who <b>had</b> gazed at <b>it</b> rapt and eager-eyed, drew in her breath.|$|R
