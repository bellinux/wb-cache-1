5|$|The {{expedition}} {{was composed}} of 20 warships, 21 frigates, and 32 transport ships, containing 800 cannons, 3,000 soldiers, and 10,000 marines. The expedition was to retake Louisbourg and then Annapolis Royal. However, after a three months crossing, and the dispersal of the fleet between Sable Island and the mainland, the expedition {{turned out to be}} a disaster for the French, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> try to recapture Port Royal again.|$|E
5|$|The 17th Airborne was to land its {{units in}} the {{southern}} portion of the area chosen for the operation, engaging the German forces that were defending the area, securing the Diersfordterwald Forest which dominated the surrounding area and capturing three bridges that spanned the River Issel. It would then hold the territory it had captured until it linked up units from the British 6th Airborne Division, which would land in the northern section of the operational area, and finally advance alongside 21st Army Group once the Allied ground forces had made contact with the airborne forces. To avoid heavy casualties such as those incurred by the British 1st Airborne Division during Operation Market Garden, both Allied airborne divisions would be dropped only after Allied ground units had secured crossings over the Rhine; the two divisions would also be dropped only a relatively short distance behind German lines, to ensure that reinforcements {{would be able to}} link up with them after only a few hours <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be isolated.|$|E
5|$|The little {{railroad}} went broke a {{few years}} later. At about this time, the Arkansas, Oklahoma & Western Railroad (AO) was forming. The railroad ran from Rogers to Siloam Springs, over a distance of approximately 30miles (43km). It was opened for traffic on New Year's Day 1908, connecting with the Frisco at Rogers and the Kansas City, Pittsburgh and Gulf (P) at Siloam Springs. The AO planned to build eastward to Eureka Springs. On December 1, 1909, the AO purchased the Monte Ne railroad. To connect the AO and the Monte Ne, a track {{would have to be}} laid from Hazelwood, Arkansas on the AO to Lowell; the Frisco line was in the way, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> allow a connection. The AO instead built an expensive underpass of the Frisco. The construction of the underpass enabled the Monte Ne line to turn over much of its outbound freight business to the AO rather than competitor Frisco. So the line enjoyed a brief but substantial volume of outgoing freight traffic from the Rogers White Lime Company located at Limedale. The underpass still exists and is still crossed by trains of Frisco Central Division successor Arkansas and Missouri Railroad.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{concerns}} about its toxicity, {{the use of}} trichloroethylene in the food and pharmaceutical industries has been banned {{in much of the}} world since the 1970s. Legislation has forced the substitution of trichloroethylene in many processes in Europe as the chemical was classified as a carcinogen carrying an R45 risk phrase, May cause cancer. Many degreasing chemical alternatives are being promoted such as Ensolv and Leksol; however, each of these is based on n-propyl bromide which carries an R60 risk phrase of May impair fertility, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be a legally acceptable substitute.|$|E

An overwhelming majority of Sri Lankans hold them responsible {{due to the fact that}} Kadirgamar was responsible for getting the US among many countries to classify the LTTE as a terrorist organisation.

25|$|In 1866, {{following}} the Battle of Sadova and the Austrian {{defeat in the}} Austro-Prussian War, the Austro-Hungarian empire began to experience increased internal problems. In an effort to shore up support for the monarchy, Emperor Franz Joseph began negotiations for a compromise with the Magyar nobility to ensure their support. Some members of the government, such as the Austro-Hungarian prime minister Count Belcredi, advised the Emperor to make a more comprehensive constitutional deal {{with all of the}} nationalities that would have created a federal structure. Belcredi worried that an accommodation with the Magyar interests would alienate the other nationalities. However, Franz Joseph was unable to ignore the power of the Magyar nobility, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> accept anything less than dualism between themselves and the traditional Austrian Ã©lites.|$|E

Instead, he turned toward teaching, gaining a government scholarship to start a course at Pretoria Bantu Normal College, a teacher training institution, in 1951. There, he served as treasurer of the Student Representative Councillor, helping to organise the Literacy and Dramatic Society, and chairing the Cultural and Debating Society for two years. It was during one local debating event that he first met the lawyer and future President Nelson Mandela; the latter did not remember the meeting <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> encounter each other again until 1990.

[...] Conservationist publications were optimistic that Bradley and other wardens would be successful in their enforcement; in AOU's January 1904 issue of The Auk, an editor wrote: [...] "The natives {{are beginning to realize}} that the birds are to be protected and that the wardens are fearless men who are not to be trifled with.

500|$|Mary Dyer's time in England {{lasted for}} over five years, and during her stay {{she had become}} deeply taken by the Quaker {{religion}} established by George Fox around 1647. [...] Formally known as the Society of Friends, the Quakers {{did not believe in}} baptism, formal prayer and the Lord's Supper, nor did they believe in an ordained ministry. [...] Each member was a minister {{in his or her own}} right, women were essentially treated as men in matters of spirituality, and they relied on an [...] "Inner Light of Christ" [...] as their source of spiritual inspiration. [...] In addition to denouncing the clergy, and refusing to support it with their tithes, they also claimed liberty of conscience as an inalienable right and demanded the separation of church and state. [...] Their worship consisted of silent meditation, though those moved by the Spirit would at times make public exhortations. [...] They minimized the customs of bowing or men removing their hats, they would not take an oath, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> fight in wars. [...] The Puritans in Massachusetts viewed Quakers as being among the most reprehensible of heretics, and they enacted several laws against them.|$|E
500|$|Gerald {{tells us}} further that a Breton knight {{had come to}} the church for Mass and found a band of about twenty young men, all armed and {{equipped}} according to the local custom.

He then {{tells the story of the}} murder of a bishop of Llanbadarn, murdered by the predecessors of the present generation of clergy. We cannot be sure how much of this was true. But Gerald disapproved of married clergy (which had been declining generally though only finally abolished by Rome in the eleventh century and deplored in principle the inheritance of church office. But all he tells us of Llanbadarn is hearsay, apart from the name of the abbot. In any case, no move was made by Archbishop Baldwin in favour of reform: the Lord Rhys was with them, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> have wished to offend him.

A poll conducted by the journal Evenimentul Zilei nominated the track as the best song of 1993, and the nationwide station Radio Contact awarded Pascu its [...] "Composer of the Year" [...] title. Mixed Grill marked Pascu's brief experimentation with a fusion of rock and reggae. [...] Hits such as [...] "Gizzi" [...] and [...] "Mi-am luat colac" [...] ("I Got Me a Lifebuoy") led some to consider {{him one of the}} pioneers of Romanian reggae, years ahead of acts like El Negro and Pacha Man. The mix of genres became characteristic of Pascu's work in music: [...] "When I was writing records, I figured that, should someone, say, be playing my record at a party, they would have several kinds to choose from, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> grow bored. But it's not because of that, I think that's how inspiration visits me, that this is how I write. I won't stick to any one musical genre." [...] In addition to the piano, guitar and drums, Pascu also began playing the harmonica.|$|E
500|$|During {{the night}} of 4â5 February, a few protesters {{continued}} to camp out in Tahrir Square. Early in the morning shots were fired as protesters said pro-Mubarak activists tried to assault the square. Troops then fired into the air to disperse them. Demonstrators later formed a human chain to prevent tanks from passing through the barricades into the square; a witness said scuffles broke out when an army general asked demonstrators to take down their makeshift barricades of corrugated steel and debris. As the army tightened access to Tahrir Square, {{the head of the}} army met protesters and asked them to return home. Protesters responded that [...] "he (Mubarak) will go" [...] <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>not.</b> The army was also more organized and present than on any other day of the protest. A heavy military presence continued in central Cairo. An Interior Ministry spokesman said that [...] "the army remains neutral and is not taking sides because if we protect one side we will be perceived as biased....our role is to prevent clashes and chaos as we separate the opposing groups." [...] Scuffles were reported during the day in Tahrir Square and one protester was said to have died. A group of foreigners including an English protester on the 5th and a Swede on the 6th joined the protesters in Tahrir Square, handing out flowers in a sign of solidarity and holding up a banner in English. Five hundred protesters arrived in Tahrir Square from Suez. There were reports of over 10,000 people continuing to stay in Alexandria through the night.|$|E
500|$|Keating {{asked that}} Lincoln {{be given a}} lenient {{judgment}} by the FHLBB, so it could limit its high risk investments {{and get into the}} relatively safe home mortgage business, allowing the business to survive. A letter from audit firm Arthur Young & Co. bolstered Keating's case that the government investigation was taking a long time. McCain initially refused to meet with Keating over the FHLBB matter and Keating called McCain a [...] "wimp" [...] behind his back. The two had a heated, contentious meeting in which McCain said he had not spent years in North Vietnamese prisoner-of-war camps to have his courage or integrity questioned; the friendship ended <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> speak again. In April 1987, the group of senators met twice with FHLBB members who were investigating American Continental Corporation and Lincoln, in an attempt to end the investigation. Meanwhile, Keating filed a lawsuit against the FHLBB, saying it had leaked confidential information about Lincoln. The outgoing head of the FHLBB in Washington deferred judgment and the new head was more sympathetic to Keating. In May 1988, the FHLBB agreed to an unprecedented memorandum of understanding giving Lincoln a clean slate and forgiveness for any violations up to that point. (In 1991, the senators would be rebuked to various degrees by the Senate Ethics Committee, with Cranston receiving the harshest verdict and Glenn and McCain the least. McCain later testified against Keating in a civil lawsuit brought by Lincoln bondholders, while the other four refused to testify.) ...|$|E
