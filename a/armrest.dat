25|$|A couch, bench, {{or other}} {{arrangement}} of seats {{next to each}} other may have <b>armrest</b> at the sides or arm rests in between. The latter may be provided for comfort, but also for privacy (e.g., in public transport and other public places), and in some park benches, to prevent homeless people from lying down or sleeping on the bench. Arm rests reduce both desired and undesired proximity between people seated side by side. A loveseat in particular, has no <b>armrest</b> in between two seating positions.|$|E

25|$|Interior trim also {{received}} minor revisions, and a bench seat with center <b>armrest</b> returned as a no-cost option {{to the standard}} Strato bucket seats and console. Bench seat-equipped Grand Prixs got a steering column-mounted shifter with the automatic transmission along with a dashboard-mounted glovebox, replacing the console-mounted shifter and glovebox of bucket-seat cars. Power front disc brakes became standard equipment this year.|$|E
25|$|Regal {{interiors}} {{were generally}} more luxurious than lesser Century models with woodgrain trim on dashboard and door panels, along with door-pull straps and bench seats with center armrests with cloth, velour, or vinyl upholstery.

25|$|Inside were revised {{interiors}} {{featuring a}} two-spoke cushioned {{steering wheel and}} new instrument panel with horizontal sweep speedometer and instrument placement similar to previous full-sized Chevrolets. Caprices continued with higher grade interiors than their Impala counterparts with luxurious cloth-and-vinyl upholstery, wood grain trim on dash, steering wheel and door panels plus carpeting on lower door panels on both sedans and coupes. A center front seat <b>armrest</b> was also featured on sedans.|$|E

25|$|VAM {{originally}} intended the Rally SST to include as standard equipment only the same accessories as the 1981 Rally GT and the optional equipment {{list of the}} 1981 Rally AMX except for its own share of exclusive and not available accessories. However, the same story as the 1980 Rally GT repeated itself for the 1981 Rally SST. The need to stress differences between not just the three-version Rally line but also the new Spirit-based Lerma model forced VAM to act any way it could. Once again, the company's sales department determined that virtually all Rally SST units included all optional convenience accessories available in the Rally line from the factory. The final list of equipment for the Rally SST consisted of a tinted windshield, intermittent wipers, rear defroster, electric antenna, full light group including reading dome light, AM-FM stereo radio, quartz clock, center console with compartment and <b>armrest</b> with rear ashtray, lighted vanity mirror, side <b>armrest</b> safety reflectors, cigarette lighter, front ashtray, locking glove box, leather wrapped sports steering wheel, inside hood release, air conditioning, parcel shelf, power door locks, power windows, power trunk release, dual remote-controlled mirrors, reclining bucket seats, retractable seatbelts, and removable trunk cover.|$|E
25|$|The 1966 Grand Prix {{received}} only minor appearance revisions from the 1965 edition {{including a new}} more rounded split grille and new taillight trim. Inside, a revised instrument panel included a squared off gauge panel and new Strato bucket seats in either Morrokide or cloth upholstery with higher seatbacks and more contoured cushions for improved lateral support. The Strato buckets were standard equipment along with a console, but a notchback bench seat with center <b>armrest</b> was a no-cost option.|$|E
25|$|Interiors were revised with all-new {{instrument}} panels featuring a larger dose of walnut trim which now {{extended to the}} center console standard with bucket seats, along with a new steering wheel with horn bars replacing the horn ring used in previous years. The standard bucket seats could be upholstered either in expanded Morrokide vinyl or a new cloth-and-Morrokide trim. New for 1965 was a no-cost bench seat option with center <b>armrest</b> available with either upholstery choice.|$|E

25|$|The first Grand Prix was a Catalina hardtop coupe trimmed to {{standards}} {{similar to the}} larger top-line Bonneville, with a distinctive grille and taillights.

The center console-mounted transmission shifter included a storage compartment and a tachometer.

40|$|BACKGROUND: There is {{a demand}} for {{interiors}} to support other activities in a car than controlling the vehicle. Currently, {{this is the case}} for the car passengers and – in the future – autonomous driving cars will also facilitate drivers to perform other activities. One of these activities is working with handheld devices. OBJECTIVE: Previous research shows that people experience problems when using handheld devices in a moving vehicle and the use of handheld devices generally causes unwanted neck flexion [Young et al. 2012; Sin and Zu 2011; Gold et al. 2011]. In this study, <b>armrests</b> are designed to support the arms when using handheld devices in a driving car in order to decrease neck flexion. METHODS: Neck flexion was measured by attaching markers on the C 7 and tragus. Discomfort was indicated on a body map on a scale 1 – 10. User experience was evaluated in a semi-structured interview. RESULTS: Neck flexion is significantly decreased by the support of the <b>armrests</b> and approaches a neutral position. Furthermore, overall comfort and comfort in the neck region specifically are significantly increased. Subjects appreciate the body posture facilitated by the <b>armrests</b> and 9 out of 10 prefer using handheld devices with the <b>armrests</b> compared to using handheld devices without the <b>armrests.</b> CONLUSION: More efforts are needed to develop the mock-up into an established product, but the angles and dimensions presented in this study could serve as guideline...|$|R
25|$|Despite this, the Aura {{has a few}} criticisms. The Aura's {{interior}} {{has been}} criticized for using cheap materials. Also, the steering wheel {{has been criticized for}} being too big for some drivers and that rear headroom was tight when equipped with the optional sunroof. The Aura was also criticized for being noisy over bumps and its lack of a rear <b>armrest</b> and head restraint, and that the push button controls on the steering wheel cannot be operated while holding the wheel. Robert Cumberford of Autombile magazine claimed that the Aura is a good car watered down by GM's cost cutting department.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} of the Supra had optional power windows and power locks {{as part of the}} convenience package. The convenience package also included cruise control and special door trim with door pull straps, with an optional sunroof. As for standard features, in the center console there was an extendable map light and a flip-top <b>armrest,</b> which provided storage. Some other features were the tilt steering wheel, deep zippered pockets {{on the backs of the}} front seats, and a tonneau cover under the liftback. The dashboard also contained a state of the art AM/FM/MPX 4-speaker stereo radio, analog clock, and tachometer as part of the instrument panel.|$|E
25|$|Isabella d’Este {{has been}} {{proposed}} as a plausible candidate for Leonardo’s ‘Mona Lisa’ of 1502-06, which is usually considered a portrait of Lisa del Giocondo. (Lisa was {{the wife of a}} merchant in Florence and Giorgio Vasari wrote of her portrait by Leonardo– it remains open whether this is the portrait now known as the ‘Mona Lisa’.) Evidence in favor of Isabella as the subject of the famous work includes Leonardo’s drawing ‘Isabella d’Este’ from 1499 and her letters of 1501-06 requesting the promised painted portrait; further arguments are the mountains in the background and the <b>armrest</b> as a Renaissance symbol for a portrait of a sovereign.|$|E
