50|$|Polarized-media {{electronic}} <b>air</b> <b>cleaners</b> use active electronically enhanced {{media to}} combine {{elements of both}} electronic <b>air</b> <b>cleaners</b> and passive mechanical filters. Most polarized-media electronic <b>air</b> <b>cleaners</b> convert 24-volt current to safe DC voltage to establish the polarized electric field. Airborne particles become polarized as they pass through the electric field and adhere to a disposable fiber media pad. Ultra-fine particles (UFPs) that are not collected on their initial pass through the media pad are polarized and agglomerate to other particles, odor and VOC molecules and are collected on subsequent passes. The efficiency of polarized-media electronic <b>air</b> <b>cleaners</b> increases as they load, providing high-efficiency filtration, with air resistance typically equal to or less than passive filters. Polarized-media technology is non-ionizing, which means no ozone is produced.|$|R

25|$|To {{adapt the}} BMW M52 engine to the Defender chassis, the {{engineers}} {{were able to}} utilize some of the parts from the recently developed BMW M51 diesel powered Range Rover 2.5 DSE. They used the clutch housing, clutch, flywheel, and slave cylinder from that vehicle to connect the engine to the R380 gearbox, {{but they had to}} produce a new clutch housing adaptor (bell housing) for the petrol M52 engine in the Defender. The unique clutch housing adaptor was necessary because the petrol M52 engine is tilted 10 degrees compared to the diesel M51 engine and it needed to be longer to match the input shaft of the R380 gearbox borrowed from the 300Tdi Defender. Due to the large diameter gearbox input shaft, the standard BMW pilot bearing could not be fitted, so a unique pilot bushing made of Oilite bronze was developed. It had an inside diameter of 7/8 inch with an outside diameter of 32mm. A mixture of non-metric and metric specifications are common on Land Rovers. Other unique parts that were developed for the 2.8i were the air intake ducts {{both before and after the}} Donaldson FPG RadialSeal™ <b>air</b> <b>cleaner,</b> engine mounts, radiator cowl, cooling hoses, fuel lines, clutch lines, air conditioning system, engine wiring, tachometer gauge, exhaust system, and a specially tuned Siemens MS41.0 DME with a Lucas 10AS alarm in place of the Drive Away Protection system (EWS) used on BMWs. There were also major changes for the 1999 model year, which included updated instrumentation, different chassis and engine wiring, an updated cooling system with aluminum radiator, and an updated fuel system with new fuel tank. The 1.667:1 gear ratio LT230 transfer box gave the vehicle a “rev happy” nature which delighted many off-road enthusiasts and made the vehicle particularly well suited for traversing a wide range of grueling terrain such as sand dunes. The high gear ratio also helped the 2.8i sprint from 0–100km/h in 9.3 seconds, making it the fastest production Defender ever made.|$|E

The goal of this research project {{was to understand the}} impact of mitigation strategies for residences impacted by sched-uled prescribed burns and wildfires. Pairs of residences were solicited to have PM 2. 5 concentrations monitored inside and outside of their houses during four fires. The effect of using <b>air</b> <b>cleaners</b> on indoor PM 2. 5 was investi-gated, as well as the effect of keeping windows closed. Appropriately sized <b>air</b> <b>cleaners</b> were provided to one of each pair of residences; occupants of all of the residences were asked to keep windows shut and minimize opening of exterior doors. Additionally, residents were asked to record all of the activities that may be a source of partic-ulate matter, such as cooking and cleaning. Measure-ments were made during one prescribed burn and three wildfires during the 2002 fire season. Outdoor 24 -hr av-erage PM 2. 5 concentrations ranging from 6 to 38 g/m 3 were measured during the fires, compared with levels of 2 – 5 g/m 3 during background measurements when no fires were burning. During the fires, PM 2. 5 was 3 g/m 3 inside all of the houses with <b>air</b> <b>cleaners</b> installed.

Conflicting data have emerged regarding the potential benefit of <b>air</b> <b>cleaners</b> with respect to reduction of indoor pet allergens and therapy of pet allergic asthma. In a randomized controlled trial 33 asthmatic children (age 6 - 17 years) with sensitisation to cat and/or dog allergens were included in order to study the effect of <b>air</b> <b>cleaners</b> containing so-called HEPA-filters (High Efficancy Particle Arrest) or sham filters placed in living- and bedrooms. After 6 months there was an additional installation of allergen impermeable mattress encasings (active and sham encasings).

While the main-filters of the sham <b>air</b> <b>cleaners</b> were found to retain only little amounts of allergens, the active filters were found to contain very high Fel d 1 and Can f 1 concentrations. The pre-filters also contained high amounts of Fel d 1 and Can f 1 allergens with no difference between sham and active filters. The <b>air</b> <b>cleaners</b> obviously removed large amounts of pet allergens from the air.

2500|$|The tractor used a , inline four-cylinder engine. The {{engine was}} similar to the Ford Model T engine in many respects. Like many engines of its day, it was multifuel-capable; it was usually tuned for {{gasoline}} or kerosene, but alcohol could also be burned. (Tractor vaporising oil [...] existed in 1920 but was not yet widely used. It entered broader use in the 1930s and 1940s.) Like many other multifuel machines, the Fordson started on gasoline from a small auxiliary tank (just a few quarts) and then switched over to the main fuel tank once warmed up sufficiently (no more than 5 minutes). To handle the kerosene (or, rarely, TVO), the intake system had a vaporizer downstream of the carburetor. The mixture coming from the carburetor was intentionally rich, and the vaporizer heated it and mixed it with more air to lean it out to the final ratio before entering the intake manifold. The intake system also had a water-bath <b>air</b> <b>cleaner</b> to filter the dust out of the air inhaled by the engine (an invention that did not originate at Ford but that was still rather novel in 1917). Air cleaning is critical to engine lifespan, even for road vehicles and most especially for farming and construction vehicles (which work in environments where dirt is frequently stirred up into the air).
