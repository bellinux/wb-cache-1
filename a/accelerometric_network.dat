During a strong earthquake, the modern accelerometers are the only instruments which can provide near source high-quality data that are important both for scientific and for civil protection purposes. Automatic and fast techniques have been developed by the University of Trieste for the automatic real-time strong motion {{data analysis}}. These techniques have been installed and optimized in the data acquisition centre of the Department of Civil Protection of Italy (DPC) to process the quasi real-time data of the National <b>Accelerometric</b> <b>Network</b> (RAN). RAN counts more than 450 stations covering all the Italian territory. Two local networks, the Friuli Venezia Giulia <b>Accelerometric</b> <b>Network</b> (RAF), located in NE Italy, and the Irpinia Seismic Network (ISNet), contribute their data into the RAN data acquisition system. 148 stations of the integrated RAN triggered the main shock of the Ferrara arc 2012 sequence.

The final goal of this project is to help the vulnerability assessment of cities in moderate seismic hazard countries. The French <b>Accelerometric</b> <b>Network</b> (RAP) chose to install a permanent network of 6 accelerometers recording continuously the vibrations of the Grenoble City Hall at the basement and at the top. The 13 -story building is a RC shear walls building, typical of the RC structures designed {{at the end of the}} 60 's in France. All the data collected in the building are available on the online access database of the RAP. In addition to the permanent network, an ambient vibration experiment has been performed in 36 points of the whole building. Using the Frequency Domain Decomposition method, these data allowed estimating precisely the different modes of vibration of the structure for low amplitudes. Only the first bending modes in each direction (1. 15 and 1. 22 Hz) and the first torsion mode (1. 44 Hz) are excited. We compared the frequencies obtained using ambient vibration to those for a moderate earthquake recorded by the permanent network. Thanks to the continuous recording, a statistical approach of the torsion mode pointed out the position of the centre of rotation of the building.

40|$|International audienceGround-motion {{prediction}} equations (GMPE) {{are essential}} in probabilistic seismic hazard studies for estimating the ground motions {{generated by the}} seismic sources. In low seismicity regions, only weak motions {{are available in the}} lifetime of <b>accelerometric</b> <b>networks,</b> and the equations selected for the probabilistic studies are usually models established from foreign data. Although most ground-motion prediction equations have been developed for magnitudes 5 and above, the minimum magnitude often used in probabilistic studies in low seismicity regions is smaller. Desaggregations have shown that, at return periods of engineering interest, magnitudes lower than 5 can be contributing to the hazard. This paper presents the testing of several GMPEs selected in current international and national probabilistic projects against weak motions recorded in France (191 recordings with source-site distances up to 300 km, 3. 8 ≤Mw≤ 4. 5). The method is based on the loglikelihood value proposed by Scherbaum et al. (2009). The best fitting models (approximately 2. 5 ≤LLH≤ 3. 5) over the whole frequency range are the Cauzzi and Faccioli (2008), Akkar and Bommer (2010) and Abrahamson and Silva (2008) models. No significant regional variation of ground motions is highlighted, and the magnitude scaling could be predominant in the control of ground-motion amplitudes. Furthermore, we take advantage of a rich Japanese dataset to run tests on randomly selected low-magnitude subsets, and check that a dataset of ~ 190 observations, same size as the French dataset, is large enough to obtain stable LLH estimates. Additionally we perform the tests against larger magnitudes (5 - 7) from the Japanese dataset. The ranking of models is partially modified, indicating a magnitude scaling effect for some of the models, and showing that extrapolating testing results obtained from low magnitude ranges to higher magnitude ranges is not straightforward...|$|R

The latter is indeed of primary importance for the usability of the accelerometric database. Surface wave analysis has been chosen as the primary investigation method since it offers the possibility of reaching the required accuracy with reasonable costs. A range of different techniques, both of the active-source and passive-source types, has been adopted to cope with the objectives of the characterization in relation to specific geological settings. Quality assessment of experimental data has been implemented to check the consistency of the measurements also with respect to the fundamental hypotheses of the method. Strategies to improve the reliability and robustness of the surface wave data inversion were exploited in order to mitigate problems arising from solution non-uniqueness and influence of higher modes in the propagation. Comparisons with independent borehole tests, available at some specific sites, confirm the reliability of the results. Although the research program covered only a subset of the network, the obtained results show the importance of specific experimental investigations aimed at estimating the shear wave velocity profile.

40|$|In Italy, strong-motion {{monitoring}} {{was started}} in 1972 by different Institutions, although mainly through Ente Nazionale per l'Energia Elettrica (ENEL; Italian National Electricity Company) and Dipartimento della Protezione Civile (DPC; Italian Department of Civil Protection), with different purposes. These included permanent acceleromet- ric monitoring and temporary monitoring during seismic se- quences or before permanent installation. Today, the National <b>Accelerometric</b> <b>Network</b> (RAN; Rete Accelero- metrica Nazionale) [Gorini et al. 2010, Zambonelli et al. 2011] is operated by the DPC and consists of 464 digital sta- tions. These are distributed throughout the whole national territory, with a prevalence for areas of major seismicity. In 2006, the INGV began strong-motion monitoring, by installing 22 accelerometric stations in northern Italy (RAIS; Rete Accelerometrica Italia Settentrionale; <b>Accelerometric</b> <b>Network</b> of Northern Italy; [URL] In 2008, the monitoring was extended to a national scale: this effort led to the installation of 105 accelerometers, collocated with the velocimetric sensors, in selected Rete Sismica Nazionale (RSN; National Seismic Network) sites [Amato and Mele 2008] that are managed by the Centro Nazionale Terremoti (CNT; National Earthquake Centre). Overall, the 127 strong- motion stations that form the INGV Italian strong-motion network homogeneously cover the whole Italian territory. The progress achieved in Italy {{in the field of}} strong-mo- tion monitoring and strong-motion data archiving and dis- semination was illustrated in a recently published special issue of the Bulletin of Earthquake Engineering [Luzi et al. 2010]. The strong-motion data recorded by the RAN have been distributed and are available on request to the DPC and to the Italian Accelerometric Archive (ITACA), as the Italian strong-motion database ([URL] [Pacor et al. 2011 a], which has been updated with records to 2009. The INGV strong-motion data are archived in real-time and dis- tributed through the European Integrated Data Archive (EIDA; [URL] web portal. Recently, an INGV working group developed the first version of a web portal with the aim of archiving, processing and distributing accelerometric data recorded by permanent and temporary INGV stations. This web portal (www. mi. ingv. it/ISMD/; Figure 1, top panel) is composed of two main modules: the former is known as the INGV Strong Motion Data (ISMD, www. mi. ingv. it/ISMD/ismd. h tml/; Figure 1, bottom left panel) and has as its main scope the analyse and distribution in quasi-real time (a few hours after event oc- currence) of the uncorrected accelerometric data, and the related metadata obtained after an automatic processing pro- cedure. This latter, known as the Dynamic Archive (DYNA, [URL] Figure 1, bottom right panel) is a dynamic database where manually post- processed accelerometric waveforms are provided, together with their metadata. Both of these archives are designed and structured {{in such a way that}} their compilations and updat- ing will be almost completely automatic. At the end of May 2012, a first prototype of the ISMD module was published, providing the uncorrected strong- motion data recorded by the INGV stations for the main events of the Emilia seismic sequence [Massa et al. 2012]...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{countries}} with a moderate seismic hazard, the classical methods developed for strong motion prone countries {{to estimate the}} seismic behaviour and subsequent vulnerability of existing buildings are often inadequate and not financially realistic. The main goals of this paper are {{to show how the}} modal analysis can contribute {{to the understanding of the}} seismic building response and the good relevancy of a modal model based on ambient vibrations for estimating the structural deformation under moderate earthquakes. We describe the application of an enhanced modal analysis technique (Frequency Domain Decomposition) to process ambient vibration recordings taken at the Grenoble City Hall building (France). The frequencies of ambient vibrations are compared with those of weak earthquakes recorded by the French permanent <b>accelerometric</b> <b>network</b> (RAP) that was installed to monitor the building. The frequency variations of the building under moderate earthquakes are shown to be slight (~ 2 %) and therefore ambient vibration frequencies are relevant over the elastic domain of the building. The modal parameters extracted from ambient vibrations are then used to determine the 1 D lumped-mass model in order to reproduce the inter-storey drift under weak earthquakes and to fix a 3 D numerical model that could be used for strong earthquakes. The correlation coefficients between data and synthetic motion are close to 80 % and 90 % in horizontal directions, for the 1 D and 3 D modelling, respectively...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of the new Italian strong-motion database ITACA (ITalian AC-celerometric Archive, [URL] is in progress under the sponsorship of the National Department of Civil Protection (DPC) within Project S 4, {{in the framework of}} DPC-INGV 2007 – 2009 research agreement. This work started from the alpha version of ITACA [8], where 2, 182 3 -component records from 1, 004 earthquakes, mainly recorded by the National <b>Accelerometric</b> <b>Network,</b> RAN, operated by DPC, were processed and included in the database. Earthquake metadata, recording station information and reports on the available geologicalgeophysical information of 452 recording sites, corresponding to about 70 % of the total, were also included. Subsequently, ITACA has been updated and will reach its final stage by the end of Project S 4, around mid- 2010, with additional features, improved information about recording stations, and updated records, including the Mw 6. 3 L’Aquila earthquake. All records were re-processed with respect to the alpha version [9], with a special care to preserve information about late-triggered events and to ensure compatibility of corrected records, i. e., velocity and displacement traces obtained by the first and second integral of the corrected acceleration should not be affected by unrealistic trends. After a short introduction of ITACA and its most relevant features and statistics, this paper mainly deals with the newly adopted processing scheme, with reference to the problems encountered and the solutions that have been devised...|$|E
40|$|Seismograms from 55 intermediate-depth Vrancea {{earthquakes}} (M 4 : 0 – 7 : 1) {{recorded at}} 43 stations of an <b>accelerometric</b> <b>network</b> in Romania {{are used to}} derive source spectra and site amplification functions from S waves in the frequency range 0. 5 – 20 Hz with the generalized inversion technique (GIT) (Castro et al., 1990). Attenuation is taken into account using the nonparametric attenuation functions derived by Oth et al. (2008) from the same dataset, and the attenuation-corrected data are then split into source and site contributions. The source spectra follow the ω 2 model (Brune, 1970, 1971) with high corner frequencies and a related Brune stress drop {{of the order of}} 100 MPa. The site amplification functions are separately determined for both horizontal and vertical components. Contrary to widespread expectation, the vertical component shows significant amplification effects at high frequencies. The H=Z ratios determined from the GIT results compare well with H=V ratios computed directly from the S-wave window of the accelerograms (Lermo and Chávez-García, 1993). The basic assumption for the determination of site effects from H=V ratios is that the vertical component is not or only little affected by site effects. For Vrancea earthquakes, this assumption is incorrect; consequently, site effects should not be estimated from H=V ratios. The reason for this peculiar fact is the geometry of intermediate-depth seismicity that leads to almost vertical ray paths beneath the stations...|$|E
40|$|When {{accompanied}} by appropriate training and preparedness of a population, Earthquake Early Warning Systems (EEWS) are effective and viable tools for the real-time reduction of societal exposure to seismic events in metropolitan areas. The Italian <b>Accelerometric</b> <b>Network,</b> RAN, {{which consists of}} about 500 stations installed over all the active seismic zones, {{as well as many}} cities and strategic infrastructures in Italy, has the potential to serve as a nationwide early warning system. In this work, we present a feasibility study for a nationwide EEWS in Italy obtained by the integration of the RAN and the software platform PRobabilistic and Evolutionary early warning SysTem (PRESTo). The performance of the RAN-PRESTo EEWS is first assessed by testing it on real strong motion recordings of 40 of the largest earthquakes that have occurred during the last 10 years in Italy. Furthermore, we extend the analysis to regions that did not experience earthquakes by considering a nationwide grid of synthetic sources capable of generating Gutenberg-Richter sequences corresponding to the one adopted by the seismic hazard map of the Italian territory. Our results indicate that the RAN-PRESTo EEWS could theoretically provide for higher seismic hazard areas reliable alert messages within about 5 to 10 s and maximum lead times of about 25 s. In case of large events (M 6. 5), this amount of lead time would be sufficient for taking basic protective measures (e. g., duck and cover, move away from windows or equipment) in tens to hundreds of municipalities affected by large ground shaking...|$|E
40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} a stable automatic method to estimate {{in real time}} the seismic moment, moment magnitude and corner frequency of events recorded by a network comprising broad-band and accelerometer sensors. The procedure produces reliable results even for small-magnitude events MW≈ 3. The real-time data arise from both the Trans-frontier network at the Alps-Dinarides junction and from the Italian National <b>Accelerometric</b> <b>Network</b> (RAN). The data is pre-processed and the S-wave train identified {{through the application of}} an automatic method, which estimates the arrival times based on the hypocenter location, recording site and regional velocity model. The transverse component of motion is used to minimize conversion effects. The source spectrum is obtained by correcting the signals for geometrical spreading and intrinsic attenuation. Source spectra for both velocity and displacement are computed and, following Andrews (1986), the seismic moment and the first estimate of the corner frequency, f 0, derived. The procedure is validated using the recordings of some recent moderate earthquakes (Carnia 2002; Bovec 2004; Parma 2008; Aquila 2009; Macerata 2009; Emilia 2012) and the recordings of some minor events in the SE Alps area for which independent seismic moment and moment magnitude estimates are available. The results obtained with a dataset of 843 events recorded by the Transfrontier and RAN networks show that the procedure is reliable and robust for events with MW≥ 3. The estimates of f 0 are less reliable. The results show a scatter, principally for small events with MW≤ 3, probably due to site effects and inaccurate locations...|$|E
40|$|A {{monitoring}} system is operative in the Peschiera Springs slope (Central Apennines, Italy) {{to mitigate the}} landslide risk related to the hosted main drainage plant of Rome aqueducts by providing alert warning. Such a strategy allows to avoid out-of-service episodes so reducing extra-costs of water distribution management. The Peschiera Springs slope {{is involved in a}} rock mass creep characterized by an average steady strain rate of 1 mm year- 1 and responsible for several landforms including sinkholes, subvertical scarps and trenches. Moreover, an average aquifer discharge of 19 m 3 s- 1 causes an intense limestone dissolution concentrated in correspondence with release bands and discontinuities that dislodge the jointed rock mass. Since 2008, an <b>accelerometric</b> <b>network</b> has been operating within the slope; about 1300 microseismic local events were recorded up to now, distinguished in failures and collapses. A control index, based on frequency of occurrence and cumulative energy of the recorded microseismic events was defined to provide three levels of alert. In 2013, a temporary nanoseismic Seismic Navigation System (SNS) array was installed inside a tunnel of the drainage plant to integrate the pre-existent seismic {{monitoring system}}. This array allowed to record 37 microseismic events, which locations are in good agreement with the evolutionary geological model of the ongoing gravitational slope deformation. In 2014, a permanent nanoseismic SNS array was installed in the plant and allowed to record several sequences of underground collapses including more than 500 events. The nanoseismic monitoring system is allowing to: (1) increase the detection level of the monitoring system; (2) locate hypocentres of the events; and (3) detect precursors of the strongest events...|$|E
