40|$|What are <b>alkylphenols?</b> <b>Alkylphenols</b> are {{a family}} of {{chemicals}} that form when another group of chemicals, the alkylphenolethoxylates (AP ethoxylates) partially biodegrade. The most important member of the alkyphenol family is nonylphenol. Approximately 80 percent of the <b>alkylphenols</b> in commerce are nonylphenols. AP ethoxylates are high volume chemicals {{that have been used}} for over 50 years as commercial and consumer detergents. These compounds have been in the news lately because new developments in analytical chemistry have enabled chemists to detect them at very low levels in the environment. Why are some people concerned about <b>alkylphenols?</b> AP ethoxylates and <b>alkylphenols</b> are widely and safely used in personal and health-care products. Issues about <b>alkylphenols</b> in the environment have been raised recently, primarily in Europe, where some governmental agencies and researchers have speculated that <b>alkylphenols</b> are endocrine disruptors (chemicals that interfere with natural hormones) that may cause reproductive and growth problems to aquatic life, particularly fish.

40|$|Five {{technical}} lignins (three organosolv, Kraft {{and soda}} lignin) were depolymerised to produce monomeric biobased aromatics, particularly <b>alkylphenols,</b> {{by a new}} two-stage thermochemical approach consisting of dedicated pyrolysis followed by catalytic hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of the resulting pyrolysis oils. Pyrolysis yielded a mixture of guaiacols, catechols and, optionally, syringols in addition to <b>alkylphenols.</b> HDO with heterogeneous catalysts (Ru/C, CoMo/alumina, phosphided NiMO/C) effectively directed the product mixture towards <b>alkylphenols</b> by, among others, demethoxylation. Up to 15 wt% monomeric aromatics of which 11 wt% <b>alkylphenols</b> was obtained (on the lignin intake) with limited solid formation (< 3 wt% on lignin oil intake). For comparison, solid Kraft lignin was also directly hydrotreated for simultaneous depolymerisation and deoxygenation resulting in two times more <b>alkylphenols.</b> However, the <b>alkylphenols</b> concentration in the product oil is higher for the two-stage approach.

5000|$|<b>Alkylphenol</b> ethoxylates {{are widely}} used {{nonionic}} detergents for domestic and industrial use. They are susceptible to microbial or photochemical degradation into alkylphenols: lipophilic, hormone mimicking compounds. [...] Endocrine disruption of alkylphenols was evidenced by research affirming cell proliferation in cells treated with alkylphenols, a response usually generated by oestradiol binding. Further investigation revealed that hormone mimicking alkylphenols affiliate with the oestradiol receptor and averts the proper binding and function of oestradiol. Male trout in <b>alkylphenol</b> contaminated rivers showed reduced testicular growth and synthesized 570,000 times more vitellogenin than did control male trout. The astonishing quantity of vitellogenin, a precursor of lipo- and phosphoproteins that make up egg-yolk protein, in the male trout population from River Lea of England exceeded that of females just before ovulation.|$|E

50|$|Nonylphenol can be {{produced}} industrially, naturally, and by the environmental degradation of <b>alkylphenol</b> ethoxylates. Industrially, nonylphenols are produced by the acid-catalyzed alkylation of phenol {{with a mixture of}} nonenes. This synthesis leads to a very complex mixture with diverse nonylphenols. Theoretically there are 211 constitutional isomers and this number rise to 550 isomers if we take the enantiomers into account. To make NPEs, manufacturers treat NP with ethylene oxide under basic conditions. Since its discovery in 1940, nonylphenol production has increased exponentially, and between 100 and 500 million pounds of nonylphenol are produced globally every year, meeting the definition of High Production Volume Chemicals.|$|E
50|$|Nonylphenols are {{a family}} of closely related organic {{compounds}} called alkylphenols.

Nonylphenol has attracted attention due to its prevalence in the environment and its potential role as an endocrine disruptor and xenoestrogen, due to its ability to act with estrogen-like activity. The estrogenicity and biodegradation heavily depends on the branching of the nonyl sidechain. Nonylphenol {{has been found to}} act as an agonist of the GPER (GPR30).|$|E

40|$|International audienceAmong {{the wide}} range of {{substances}} discharged continuously in the environment, <b>alkylphenols</b> became a major focus of environmental research in the last decades, as it was found that they possess endocrine disrupting properties. Knowledge about the occurrence and levels of <b>alkylphenols</b> in environment is critical for the risk assessment of these compounds on both ecosystem and human health. However, the analysis of traces of <b>alkylphenols</b> in environmental matrices is a very difficult task, and the suitable methods involve generally an extraction followed by an extensive sample clean-up before detection, steps often time-consuming and costly. In order to reduce the analysis time, obtain a high throughput of analysis and thus improve work efficiency, the objective of the present study is to investigate the use of immunochemical technique (ELISA) for the determination of nonylphenol and octylphenol in soils and various kinds of water.

40|$|Présentation PosterNational audienceGrowing {{source of}} {{evidence}} suggests that exposure to estrogen mimicking agents is {{a risk factor for}} breast cancer onset and progression. Long chain alkylphenols are man-made compounds still present in household products, industrial and agricultural processes, leading to a global environmental and human contamination. These molecules are known to exert estrogen-like activities through binding to classical estrogen receptors. Recently, we have demonstrated that a realistic mixture of 4 -tert-octylphenol and 4 -nonylphenol can stimulate proliferation and modulate epigenetic status of testicular cancer germ cells through a rapid, Estrogen Receptor alpha 36 (ERα 36) - dependent non genomic pathway (Ajj et al, 2013; doi: 10. 1371 /journal. pone. 0061758). In a retrospective study of breast tumor samples, we also validated ERα 36 expression as a reliable prognostic factor for cancer progression from an estrogen dependent proliferative tumor toward an estrogen dispensable metastatic disease (Chamard-Jovenin et al, 2015; doi: 10. 1186 /s 12918 - 015 - 0178 - 7). Since high ERα 36 expression enhances expression of migration/invasion markers in breast tumors, we addressed the question of its involvement in response to <b>alkylphenol</b> exposure in vitro (MCF- 10 A mammary epithelial cell line and MCF- 7 estrogen-sensitive cancer cells) and in vivo (C 57 /Bl 6 mice).  MethodsIn order to characterize the molecular events in <b>alkylphenol</b> exposed cells, ERα 36 overexpression (knock in) or gene-silencing (knock down) strategies combined to microarray analyses of the mixture target genes were used in MCF- 10 A cells. Molecular and cellular biology experiments confirmed the predicted phenotypes. A customized database was designed to analyze comprehensive gene expression results, nonlinear correlation analyses, and mutual information computations helpful for the modeling of alkylphenol/ERα 36 -dependent pathways. In vivo, <b>alkylphenol</b> mixture doses, representative of human exposure, were orally given to C 57 /Bl 6 pregnant females and histological analyses were then performed on F 1 mammary glands.  Key ResultsOur results highlight a key role for ERa 36 in <b>alkylphenol</b> non genomic src protein kinase /PI 3 -kinase/serine-threonine kinase Akt/ nuclear factor-kappa B signaling in non cancerous epithelial breast cells. Flow cytometry analyses, scratch-wound assays and caspase clivage measurements indicate that the <b>alkylphenol</b> mixture may promote a neoplastic like phenotype, i. e. proliferation, apoptosis escape and migration in MCF- 10 A epithelial cells through an ERα 36 dependent pathway. These results are currently used to build a model of alkylphenol-directed breast cancer induction and progression.
