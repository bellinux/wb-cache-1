40|$|Atrazine (1), <b>Atraton</b> (2) and Ametryn (3) are photodegraded upon 254  nm irradiation, {{yielding}} 2 -OH-atrazine (4) as a photoproduct. Dealkylation {{products are}} also generated, and 4 -ethylamino- 6 -isopropylamino-(1, 3, 5) -triazine {{was also found}} as a photoproduct of 3. The main photoreaction is proposed to be an addition-elimination, yielding 4, which subsequently photodegrades. The ease of photodegradation depends on the electron availability at position C- 2, the observed order of photoreactivity being 1 > 3 > 4 > 2. Copyright © 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|The triazines are a {{group of}} {{chemically}} similar herbicides including atrazine, cyanazine, and propazine, primarily used to control broadleaf weeds. About 64 to 80 million lbs of atrazine alone are used {{each year in the}} United States, {{making it one of the}} two most widely used pesticides in the country. All triazines are somewhat persistent in water and mobile in soil. They are among the most frequently detected pesticides in groundwater. They are considered as possible human carcinogens (Group C) based on an increase in mammary gland tumors in female laboratory animals. In this research, we performed the Microtox Assay to investigate the acute toxicity of a significant number of triazines including atrazine, <b>atraton,</b> ametryne, bladex, prometryne, and propazine, and some of their degradation products including atrazine desethyl, atrazine deisopropyl, and didealkyled triazine. Tests were carried out as described by Azur Environmental [1]. The procedure measured the relative acute toxicity of triazines, producing data for the calculation of triazine concentrations effecting 50 % reduction in bioluminescence (EC 50 s). Quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) were examined based on the molecular properties obtained from quantum mechanical predictions performed for each compound. Toxicity tests yielded EC 50 values of 39. 87, 273. 20, 226. 80, 36. 96, 81. 86, 82. 68, 12. 74, 11. 80, and 78. 50 mg/L for atrazine, propazine, prometryne, <b>atraton,</b> atrazine desethyl, atrazine deisopropyl, didealkylated triazine, ametryne, and bladex, respectively; indicating that ametryne was the most toxic chemical while propazine was the least toxic. QSAR evaluation resulted in a coefficient of determination (r 2) of 0. 86, indicating a good value of toxicity prediction based on the chemical structures/properties of tested triazines...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Prometon {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{consistently}} detected herbicides in the U. S. environment. However, no previous assessment of the potential for prometon or related methoxytriazine herbicides to act as endocrine-disrupting chemicals has been conducted. This study used an array of in vitro bioassays to assess whether prometon, <b>atraton,</b> terbumeton, or secbumeton might act as potent (ant) agonists of the aryl hydrocarbon, estrogen, androgen, or glucocorticoid receptors or as aromatase inhibitors or inducers in vitro. Potential effects of prometon were also evaluated using a 21 -d fathead minnow reproduction assay. Concentrations of methoxytriazines, as great as 1 mg/L (4. 4 �M), did not induce significant dioxin-like responses in H 4 IIE-luc cells, estrogenic responses in MVLN cells, or androgen or glucocorticoid receptor–mediated responses in MDA-kb 2 cells, nor did the methoxytriazines significantly affect aromatase activity in vitro. In the fathead minnow assay, exposure to 20, 200, or 1, 000 �g prometon/L significantly reduced the weight of the male fat pad (an androgen-responsive tissue) relative to body weight. Exposure to 20 �g prometon/...|$|E

40|$|As {{a renowned}} s-triazine herbicide, ametryn is {{worldwide}} emitted {{into the atmosphere}} in both gaseous and particulate phases via spray drifts from treatments and post application emissions, but its chemical degradation in the atmosphere has not been well characterized. In this study, the heterogeneous kinetics of particulate ametryn with NO 3 radicals were investigated with a mixed-phase relative rate method. A vacuum ultraviolet photoionization aerosol time-of-flight mass spectrometer (VUV-ATOFMS) and an atmospheric gas analysis mass spectrometer were synchronously used to online monitor the decays of particulate ametryn and gas-phase isoprene. The reactive uptake coefficient of NO 3 radicals on ametryn particles was calculated to be 2. 9 x 10 (- 2), according to the measured ametryn loss ratio and the average NO 3 concentration. The effective rate constant for the heterogeneous reaction of particulate ametryn with NO 3 radicals measured under experimental conditions was 8. 4 x 10 (- 13) cm(3) molecule(- 1) s(- 1). In addition, <b>atraton,</b> ametryn sulfoxide and ametryn sulfone were identified as the reaction products by gas-chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. The experimental results might {{shed light on the}} chemical behavior of atmospheric ametryn at night-time...|$|E
