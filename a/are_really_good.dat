500|$|All but {{two songs}} on the album were written by Corgan. The closing track from the first disc, [...] "Take Me Down", was written and sung by Iha, while the album's final track, [...] "Farewell and Goodnight", {{features}} lead vocals by all four band members and, according to the BMI database, was written solely by Iha, despite being credited on the album liner notes as being written by both Iha and Corgan. Iha wrote additional songs during {{the making of the}} album, but they did not make the final cut. Corgan said in a 1995 Rolling Stone interview, [...] "here are some B sides that James did that <b>are</b> <b>really</b> <b>good.</b> They just don't fit {{in the context of the}} album. And part of me feels bad. But over the seven years we've been together, the least uptight part of the band has been the music." ...|$|E

He said: [...] "This song was really simple to mix. It {{was produced by}} Stargate and the sounds <b>are</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> and they all made sense, and {{there was lots of}} room for all the instruments." [...] Goldstein used a board equalizer for the drums' treatment. For the acoustic guitars, he used the analogue flanger of a TC 1210 spatial expander [...] "to sweeten the sound" [...] and to give them [...] "a little bit more spread". Goldstein thought [...] "Irreplaceable" [...] sounded [...] "a bit old-school"; an eighth note delay echo was placed on the song's lead vocal at 341ms, using the Echo Farm plug-in software. For the backing vocals, Goldstein used Echo Farm with a quarter note delay at 682ms and Sony's Oxford Dynamics compressor/limiter in dual-mono mode.|$|E

And then, so, for this, uh, this contract with Island Def Jam, in the beginning I separated it to this English language album, and I don't do Japanese translations. I just, my integrity as an artist just would not take that, could not take that." ...|$|E
500|$|IGN's Ramsey Isler {{gave the}} episode a mixed review, noting that [...] "its concept is intriguing, bold, and {{extremely}} risky. I'm {{just not sure}} if it works. It's such a drastic change of scenery and tone it's hard to say whether this is genius or madness." [...] Isler observed that he would have [...] "absolutely loved" [...] the episode if he had been [...] "given appropriate context through a suitable setup... But the approach we got feels an awful lot like a gimmick, and this show does not need to gamble with gimmicks at this point." [...] Isler did find positive elements of the episode however, and rated it 8 out of 10, an indication of a [...] "great" [...] episode. He praised Walter's return [...] "to a much more confident, focused man who's a bit scary in his determination and resolve," [...] as well as the events that followed. Isler concluded that [...] "the core ideas <b>are</b> <b>really</b> <b>good,</b> but the way the new concepts were introduced seems haphazard, and a huge gamble that could turn off all but the most hardcore viewers." ...|$|E
500|$|Although they {{initially}} {{worked well}} together, Simon and Groening's relationship became [...] "very contentious" [...] according to Groening. Simon never expected {{the show to}} be a success, often proclaiming to fellow staff members [...] "We're thirteen and out"—meaning that the show would be canceled after the thirteen episodes of the first season. Therefore, he also told the staff that they had creative freedom {{to do whatever they}} wanted to make The Simpsons as good a show as possible, regardless of network or public opinion, because he thought it inevitably would not be renewed; he elaborated in 2009 that [...] "really I was saying that to take the pressure off of everyone. I was just saying let's just go out and make 13 episodes that <b>are</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> and really funny." [...] However, Groening interpreted it as meaning Simon was uncommitted and did not care whether the show was a success or not, as Simon's career would survive, whereas his own would not. In 2001, Groening described Simon as [...] "brilliantly funny and one of the smartest writers I've ever worked with, although unpleasant and mentally unbalanced." [...] According to John Ortved's book , when the show became successful Simon resented the media attention Groening received, particularly the praise for the show's writing; Simon felt that Groening's involvement was limited, and that he should have been the one receiving credit for the show. Simon later spoke well of Groening's influence, particularly on the show's positive tone.|$|E

We saw Tricky {{a couple of weeks ago}} in Paris and it was quite an amicable meeting after five or six years." [...] Tricky agreed to record with the band and he revealed in a June 2013 interview that [...] "there's a couple of songs which are OK, which <b>are</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> actually to be honest with you".

If all you do is race on simulators at home, then maybe they are pretty good!” Hans-Jürgen Abt, the team principal of Audi Sport ABT, felt the Vegas eRace was [...] "a good example" [...] of how the series was moving farther than several other sporting championships: [...] "For more than six decades, we have been racing in motorsport on all of the world’s race tracks – but this event is a total first for us." ...|$|E

6000|$|In {{the summer}} of 1836 Miss Martineau {{returned}} to England, having added this great question to the stock of her foremost objects of interest and concern. Such additions, whether literary or social, are {{the best kind of}} refreshment that travel supplies. She published two books on America: one of them abstract and quasi-scientific, Society in America; the other, A Retrospect of Western Travel, of a lighter and more purely descriptive quality. Their success with the public was moderate, and in after years she condemned them in very plain language, the first of them especially as 'full of affectations and preachments.' Their only service, and it was not inconsiderable, was the information which they circulated as to the condition of slavery and of the country under it. We do not suppose that they are worth reading at the present day, except from a historical point of view. But they <b>are</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> specimens of a kind of literature which is not abundant, and yet which is of the utmost value--we mean the record of the sociological observation of a country by a competent traveller, who stays long enough in the country, has access to the right persons of all kinds, and will take pains enough to mature his judgments. It was a happy idea of O'Connell's to suggest that she should go over to Ireland, and write such an account of that country as she had written of the United States. And we wish at this very hour that some one as competent as Miss Martineau would do what O'Connell wished her to do. A similar request came to her from Milan: why should she not visit Lombardy, and then tell Europe the true tale of Austrian rule? ...|$|E

60|$|Insensibly Mr. Brumley {{moved with}} his times. It is the {{necessary}} first {{phase in the}} break-up of any system of unsound assumptions {{that a number of}} its votaries should presently set about padding its cutting corners and relieving the harsh pressure of its injustices by exuberances of humour and sentimentality. Mr. Brumley became charitable and romantic,--orthodox still but charitable and romantic. He was all for smashing with the generalization, but now in the particular instance he was more and more for forgiveness. One finds creeping into the later Euphemia books a Bret-Harte-like doctrine that a great number of bad women <b>are</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> and a persuasion in the 'Raffles' key that a large proportion of criminals are really very picturesque and admirable fellows. One wonders how far Mr. Brumley's less ostensible life was softening in harmony with this exterior change, this tender twilight of principle. He wouldn't as yet face the sterner fact that most people who are condemned by society, whether they are condemned justly or not, are by the very gregariousness of man's nature debased, and that a law or custom that stamps you as bad makes you bad. A great state should have high and humane and considerate laws nobly planned, nobly administered and needing none of these shabby little qualifications sotto voce. To find goodness in the sinner and justification in the outcast is to condemn the law, but as yet Mr. Brumley's heart failed where his intelligence pointed towards that conclusion. He hadn't the courage to revise his assumptions about right and wrong to that extent; he just allowed them to get soft and sloppy. He waded, where there should be firm ground. He waded toward wallowing. This is a perilous way of living and the sad little end of Euphemia, flushed and coughing, left him no doubt in many ways still more exposed to the temptations of the sentimental byway and the emotional gloss. Happily this is a book about Lady Harman and not an exhaustive monograph upon Mr. Brumley. We will at least leave him the refuge of a few shadows.|$|E
60|$|Lastly, always {{recollect}} that {{to educate}} rightly {{is not a}} simple and easy thing, but a complex and extremely difficult thing, the hardest task which devolves on adult life. The rough-and-ready style of domestic government is indeed practicable by the meanest and most uncultivated intellects. Slaps and sharp words are penalties that suggest themselves alike to the least reclaimed barbarian and the stolidest peasant. Even brutes can use this method of discipline; as you may see in the growl and half-bite with which a bitch will check a too-exigeant puppy. But if you would carry out with success a rational and civilised system, you must be prepared for considerable mental exertion--for some study, some ingenuity, some patience, some self-control. You will have habitually to consider what are the results which in adult life follow certain kinds of acts; and you must then devise methods by which parallel results shall be entailed on the parallel acts of your children. It will daily be needful to analyse the motives of juvenile conduct--to distinguish between acts that <b>are</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> and those which, though simulating them, proceed from inferior impulses; while you will have to be ever on your guard against the cruel mistake not unfrequently made, of translating neutral acts into transgressions, or ascribing worse feelings than were entertained. You must more or less modify your method to suit the disposition of each child; and must be prepared to make further modifications as each child's disposition enters on a new phase. Your faith will often be taxed to maintain the requisite perseverance in a course which seems to produce little or no effect. Especially if you are dealing with children who have been wrongly treated, you must be prepared for a lengthened trial of patience before succeeding with better methods; since that which is not easy even where a right state of feeling has been established from the beginning, becomes doubly difficult when a wrong state of feeling has to be set right. Not only will you have constantly to analyse the motives of your children, but you will have to analyse your own motives--to discriminate between those internal suggestions springing from a true parental solicitude and those which spring from your own selfishness, your love of ease, your lust of dominion. And then, more trying still, you will have not only to detect, but to curb these baser impulses. In brief, you will have to carry on your own higher education {{at the same time that}} you are educating your children. Intellectually you must cultivate to good purpose that most complex of subjects--human nature and its laws, as exhibited in your children, in yourself, and in the world. Morally, you must keep in constant exercise your higher feelings, and restrain your lower. It is a truth yet remaining to be recognised, that the last stage in the mental development of each man and woman is to be reached only through a proper discharge of the parental duties. And when this truth is recognised, it will be seen how admirable is the arrangement through which human beings are led by their strongest affections to subject themselves to a discipline that they would else elude.|$|E
