5|$|Ferrara's {{stint as}} Juventus manager, however, {{proved to be}} unsuccessful, with Juventus knocked out of Champions League and Coppa Italia, as well as just lying on the sixth place in the league table {{at the end of}} January 2010, leading to the {{dismissal}} of Ferrara and the naming of Alberto Zaccheroni as caretaker manager. Zaccheroni could not help the side improve, as Juventus finished the season in seventh place in Serie A. For the 2010–11 season, Jean-Claude Blanc was replaced by Andrea Agnelli as the club's president. Agnelli's first action was to replace Zaccheroni and director of sport <b>Alessio</b> Secco with Sampdoria manager Luigi Delneri and director of sport Giuseppe Marotta. However, Delneri failed to improve their fortunes and was dismissed. Former player and fan favourite Antonio Conte, fresh after winning promotion with Siena, was named as Delneri's replacement. In September 2011, Juventus relocated to the new Juventus Stadium.|$|E
5|$|French naturalist Lucien Quélet {{transferred}} the species to the now-obsolete genus Dictyopus in 1886, {{which resulted in}} the synonym Dictyopus torosus. Boletus xanthocyaneus, first described by Henri Romagnesi in 1948 as Boletus purpureus var. xanthocyaneus and classified as a species in 1976, was considered by Italian mycologist Carlo Luciano <b>Alessio</b> to be synonymous with B. torosus. Others, however, regard this fungus a distinct species. In 2013 Italian mycologists Valerio Bertolini and Giampaolo Simonini observed that the brevity of the original species description meant that some subsequent papers used B.torosus for specimens that aligned more closely with descriptions of Boletus rhodopurpureus or B.luteocupreus (both now placed in the genus Imperator). They did note that Swiss and French authors had adhered to a more detailed description by Quélet, and that this was the only description faithful to the original description with a grey cap and yellow pores that slowly turn red. They concluded the original description must have been based on specimens growing near the French-Swiss border and hence selected a neotype specimen from this region.|$|E
5|$|On 27 December 2014, it was {{announced}} that Torres' move to Milan would be made permanent on 5 January 2015, but two days later, he agreed to rejoin La Liga club Atlético Madrid on loan {{until the end of the}} 2015–16 season. The loan was agreed after <b>Alessio</b> Cerci went the opposite way from Atlético to Milan on the same day, 5 January. Torres' unveiling at the Vicente Calderón Stadium on 4 January 2015 drew a crowd of 45,000 persons. He played the first match of his second spell on 7 January 2015, starting in the first leg of a Copa del Rey last 16 tie against Real Madrid. He had no shots on target and was replaced by Koke after 59 minutes, but Atlético won 2–0. Eight days later in the second leg, he scored two goals – in the first minute of each half – as Atlético advanced, his first goals in an away Madrid derby. Torres scored in the first minute again in the quarter-finals, albeit in a 2–3 home defeat against Barcelona.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1433 an army led by Sinan Pasha, beylerbey of Rumelia, pillaged the areas of Kanina and Yannina and moved northwards, where they subdued the rebels in the domains of Gjon Kastrioti, who was reduced again to vassal status, while his son Skanderbeg, who was also called to join the revolt, {{remained}} in Ottoman service in Anatolia. In August 1433, the senate of Venice convened to evaluate the situation and deemed that the revolt posed {{a threat to the}} Venetian territories in the region too. However, by the end of October they reevaluated the crisis and rejected the deployment of a war galley to the Venetian colonies. In northern Albania Nicholas Dukagjini captured territories of the pre-Ottoman Principality of Dukagjini and besieged and captured Dagnum. Dukagjini then tried to ally himself with Venice by offering to accept Venetian suzerainty and granting them control of Dagnum. However, Venice refused any kind of involvement in his plan and the revolt in general. Dukagjini was not aware that Hasan Bey, the Ottoman governor of Dagnum, had requested Venetian assistance after his defeat. As Venice did not want to provoke Ottoman hostility, the captain of Shkodër (Scutari) was ordered to assist Hasan Bey in recapturing Dagnum. Arms were subsequently sent to the garrison of Lezhë (<b>Alessio)</b> and by 1435 the fort had been returned to Ottoman control. In central Albania, Andrea Thopia unsuccessfully besieged the castle of Krujë, while in the region of Vlorë the siege of the fort of Kaninë began. Vlorë was lost to the rebels as early as May 1432, but must have been recovered by May 1434 as contemporary Venetian documents mention an Ottoman official (subaşi) stationed there at that time.|$|E

On 24 May 1939, the prototype performed its maiden flight. Flight testing of the prototype revealed it {{to be able to}} outfight several significant combat aircraft of the time, including even the more modern Macchi C.200 and the German Messerschmitt Bf 109E fighters.

During the season, Fiorentina topped their Europa League group, moving on to the round of 32 to face Danish side Esbjerg fB, which Fiorentina defeated 4–2 on aggregate. In the following round of 16, however, they then lost to Italian rivals Juventus 2–1 on aggregate, ousting Fiorentina from the competition. At the end of the season, the team finished fourth again in the league, and also finishing they year as Coppa Italia runners-up after losing 3–1 to Napoli in the final.|$|E
25|$|Three days later, Parma played away at Fiorentina, who {{had also}} won one and lost one of their first two league games. With Valiani and Pellè both missing due to injury and Giovinco serving his one-match suspension, four changes were made from the weekend's winning team, as both Abderrazzak Jadid and Zé Eduardo were given their first starts in a Parma shirt. Fiorentina made the only chances of the first half, but were largely {{restricted}} to long-range efforts. Before 30 seconds had passed in the second half, Fiorentina took a deserved lead from a close-range Stevan Jovetić tap-in after Alessandro Lucarelli failed to clear the ball. <b>Alessio</b> Cerci then doubled La Violas lead with a diving header halfway through the second half, before Jovetić coolly added a third with ten minutes to go.

25|$|A pre-match {{protest in}} the Curva Nord at the refereeing {{performances}} in Parma matches was {{the prelude to}} Fiorentina's re-arranged visit on Wednesday 7 March. Parma started well and dominated the game with the surprising inclusion of Jaime Valdés in central midfield not hindering them. After 28 minutes, Giovinco played through ball ahead of Stefano Okaka, whose shot was saved, but the Italian striker finished well on the rebound. On the hour mark, Fiorentina equalised after an excellent wide free-kick found Matija Nastasić, who nodded home from close range. Parma continued to have chances, but Fiorentina miraculously took the lead via a cute <b>Alessio</b> Cerci finish. Late on, Giovinco won a contentious penalty for a shirt tag and stepped up to score the penalty to level the scores at two each. Confusion reigned late on; {{it looked as though}} Valon Behrami had been sent off, but the red card was rescinded after discussions between the referee and the linesman. Andrea Lazzari should have won the game for Fiorentina in injury time, but fired just wide.|$|E
25|$|At Juventus, Capello {{rejected}} the club's board members' requests to field a three-man front line {{and once again}} reverted to his preferred 4–4–2 formation. Capello won consecutive league titles, and put together a balanced and efficient side which was built upon a strong and highly organised back-line, which was further supported by two dynamic, defensive-minded box-to-box midfielders in the centre, such as Manuele Blasi, Stephen Appiah, <b>Alessio</b> Tacchinardi, Emerson, and later Patrick Vieira, who both alternated defensive and playmaking duties in midfield; the team's attacking wingers, Pavel Nedvěd and Mauro Camoranesi, were required both to drop back defensively and also assist the strikers from an offensive standpoint. Capello usually partnered the team's main striker David Trezeguet alongside the emerging Zlatan Ibrahimović up-front, with the latter playing in a more creative role, while the team's captain, Alessandro Del Piero, was used mostly as a substitute. Capello also introduced several younger players into the squad, such as the Romanian striker Adrian Mutu, and left-back Giorgio Chiellini; the latter's performances later prompted Capello to bench Jonathan Zebina and shift left-back Gianluca Zambrotta to right-back, {{in order to accommodate}} the youngster into the first team.|$|E
25|$|The {{qualifying}} period was {{split into two}} sessions; the first was held on Thursday afternoon and ran for 40 minutes with the second held on Friday afternoon and lasting for 30 minutes. The fastest time set by each driver from either session counted towards his final starting position for the qualification race. The first qualifying session saw Rosenqvist {{come out on top}} with a time of two minutes and 11.842 seconds on the final lap of the session with new tyres. He was eight-tenths of a second quicker than the best-placed rookie Ilott in second position with teammate Giovinazzi another thousandth of a second in arrears in third place. Ilott and Giovinazzi held the lead at various points in the session before Rosenqvist's last lap effort. Sam MacLeod improved on his last lap to end the session in fourth place having had four new tyres installed at his pit stop. On his last timed lap, Juncadella recovered from an earlier free practice gearbox problem to end up provisionally fifth. Having been in contention for much of first qualifying, Pommer finished sixth, with Sekiguci and Mikkel Jensen in close proximity on the time sheets. Gustavo Menezes and Sims rounded out the top ten. Following them were Charles Leclerc, Kanamaru with Stroll and Arjun Maini provisionally lining up on the seventh row of the grid. <b>Alessio</b> Lorandi was next up ahead of Dennis–whose air restrictor fell off his car and then suffered gearbox issues–Dorian Boccolacci, Yamashita, Santino Ferrucci and Cassidy. The rest of the order was completed by Albon, Sérgio Sette Câmara, Martin Cao, Ryan Tveter, Takaboshi, Matt Solomon, Zhi Cong Li and Wing Chung Chang. The session passed relatively smoothly, with only Sette Câmara running into the barriers, and then stopping at San Francisco Hill so he could not risk any further damage by driving back to the pit lane.|$|E

500|$|The {{defeat of}} the Ottoman forces showed that the League of Lezhë {{had yet to be}} fully defeated. This allowed Skanderbeg to visit Ferdinand before his {{departure}} from Italy, but he received only 1,000 ducats, 300 carts of grain, and 500 [...] ducats to support Krujë's munitions. While Skanderbeg was in his court, Ferdinand received an ambassador from Mehmed offering peace, signaling that the Ottomans did not have any aggressive intentions towards Naples. Ferdinand accepted the proposal and Skanderbeg thus began his return to Albania. Ballaban continued to strengthen the siege against Krujë. Upon returning to Albania, the political situation began to change. The once distant Albanian nobles, among them Dukagjini, were now convinced of their impending defeat and allied themselves with Skanderbeg. Meanwhile, the Venetians ended their attempts to negotiate peace with Mehmed and accepted cooperation with Skanderbeg. Skanderbeg met with Dukagjini and other northern Albanian nobles in <b>Alessio</b> (Lezhë) where they gathered an army to assault Ballaban's forces. Together with 400 of Dukagjini's cavalry and a large number of infantry, 600 heavily armed Italian soldiers, and 4,000 locals from Durazzo, Scutari, <b>Alessio,</b> Drivast (Drisht), and Antivari (Bar), Skanderbeg commanded 13,400 men to relieve Krujë as reported by Demetrio Franco, one of Skanderbeg's primary biographers and personal associates, who also served in Skanderbeg's ranks. Among those who joined Skanderbeg was Nicolo Moneta, a lord of Scutari and wealthy Venetian patrician.|$|E
500|$|George Kastrioti Skanderbeg, {{the son of}} the {{powerful}} prince John Kastrioti, had been a vassal of the Ottoman Empire as a sipahi, or cavalry commander. After his participation in the Ottoman loss at the Battle of Niš, Skanderbeg deserted the Ottoman army and rushed to Albania alongside 300 other Albanians. By forging a letter from Murad II to the Governor of Krujë, he became lord of the city in November 1443. Hungarian captain John Hunyadi's continued operations against Sultan Murad II gave Skanderbeg time to prepare an alliance of the Albanian nobles. Skanderbeg invited all of Albania's nobles to meet in the Venetian-held town of <b>Alessio</b> (Lezhë) on 2 March 1444. <b>Alessio</b> was chosen as the meeting point because the town had once been the capital of the Dukagjini family and to induce Venice to lend aid to the Albanian movement. Among the nobles that attended were George Arianiti, Paul Dukagjini, Andrea Thopia, Lekë Dushmani, Teodor Korona, Peter Spani, Lekë Zaharia, and Paul Stres Balsha. Here they formed the League of Lezhë, a confederation of all of the major Albanian princes in alliance against the Ottoman Empire. The chosen captain (...) of this confederation was Skanderbeg. The League's first military challenge came in the spring of 1444, when Skanderbeg's scouts reported that the Ottoman army was planning to invade Albania. Skanderbeg planned to move towards the anticipated entry point and prepared for an engagement.|$|E
