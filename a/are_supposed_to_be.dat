Conversely, stories published in 1937 by the clergyman George Sutherland suggest these hybrids are considered to be of superior quality to normal pedigree cattle in the far north of Scotland.|$|E

5|$|Stephenie Meyer {{says that}} the idea for Twilight came {{to her in a}} dream on June 2, 2003. The dream was about a human girl, and a vampire who was in love with her but thirsted for her blood. Based on this dream, Meyer wrote the {{transcript}} of what is now chapter 13 of the book. Despite having very little writing experience, in a matter of three months she had transformed that dream into a completed novel. After writing and editing the novel, she signed a three-book deal with Little, Brown and Company for $750,000, an unusually high amount for a first time author. Meyer's literary agent, Jodi Reamer of Writers House, discovered her only because the inexperienced assistant who received Meyer's original letter did not know that young adult books <b>are</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> 40,000 to 60,000 words in length, not 130,000 words. Megan Tingley, the Little, Brown editor who signed Meyer, said that halfway through the reading of the Twilight manuscript, she realized that she had a future bestseller in her hands. The book was released in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Unlike many of {{the sets}} {{featured}} on the show which were filmed on a Fox soundstage, the shot of the buried alien space craft was actually filmed in the hills near Simi Valley, California. Carter wanted a full-scale mock-up of the alien ship {{to be buried in}} the ground. This was unusual for the show; usually, {{a small portion of the}} ship would have been buried in the ground and the rest would have been filled in either via digital graphics, or with a scale model. In this episode, however, all of the shots of the alien ship, sans the take off, were done practically. To create the otherworldly glow of the ship, over 100 lamps were hidden within the craft. In addition, the ship itself was covered in glyphs that <b>are</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> part of an unknown alien language. This was accomplished by designing fictional characters and programming them into a computer. These were then printed as letters which could be applied to the ship's hull.|$|E
5|$|Robert was Lord Chancellor {{from spring}} 1140 to summer 1154, serving King Stephen of England. It {{is not known}} exactly when Stephen {{appointed}} Robert chancellor nor why Stephen choose him for the office. The historian Richard Sherman speculated that Stephen appointed Robert as a favour to Walter de Gant, perhaps because of Walter's presence at the Battle of Cowton Moor in 1138. Three charters which date from March 1140 to January 1141 and <b>are</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> witnessed by Robert all have difficulties with either the dating or whether the signature attributed to Robert is actually Robert, so exact dating of his term of office isn't possible from charter evidence. For a brief period in 1141, Stephen's rival Empress Matilda also appointed two chancellors– William de Vere and William fitzGilbert– {{but they did not}} interrupt Robert's term of service. Robert was with Stephen at Caistor during the middle of 1143, where he was a witness on charters. Throughout his approximately 14 years as chancellor, Robert only witnessed 20 charters certainly and perhaps another 13 that are not securely attributed to Robert. Stephen's two previous chancellors, Roger le Poer and Philip de Harcourt, had a much higher rate of attesting charters– 62 in 3.5 years for Roger and 12 in 9 months for Philip. Even Baldric, Robert's subordinate and holder of the office of keeper of the royal seal, attested 17 charters during Stephen's reign. Various reasons have been put forward for why Robert attested at a lower rate than the earlier chancellors, including indifference to his office, deputising the duties to another clerk, or difficulty in following the itinerant court due to age. Robert's last secure appearance as chancellor as a witness to a charter is one dated to the summer of 1154 at Lincoln.|$|E

25|$|A broad {{distinction}} is made between general and specialized dictionaries. Specialized dictionaries include words in specialist fields, {{rather than a}} complete range of words in the language. Lexical items that describe concepts in specific fields are usually called terms instead of words, {{although there is no}} consensus whether lexicology and terminology are two different fields of study. In theory, general dictionaries <b>are</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> semasiological, mapping word to definition, while specialized dictionaries <b>are</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> onomasiological, first identifying concepts and then establishing the terms used to designate them. In practice, the two approaches are used for both types. There are other types of dictionaries that do not fit neatly into the above distinction, for instance bilingual (translation) dictionaries, dictionaries of synonyms (thesauri), and rhyming dictionaries. The word dictionary (unqualified) is usually understood to refer to a general purpose monolingual dictionary.|$|E
