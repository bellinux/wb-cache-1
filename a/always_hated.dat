5|$|Piru Singh {{was born}} on 20 May 1918, in village Beri, Jhunjhunu, Rajasthan. He {{was the son of}} Lal Singh. His family {{consisted}} of seven children—three brothers and four sisters—with Singh being the youngest son. As a young boy, Singh <b>always</b> <b>hated</b> school, as he was unable to cope with the restricted environment. One day, after being scolded by his class teacher for quarreling with one of his classmates, Singh ran away, and never returned to school. After that, Singh continued to help his parents in their farm, and grew up to be well-built and handsome youth. Shikar, a local Indian sport, was his favourite game. Though Singh wanted to join the army from his childhood, he was rejected twice, as he was too young, before he was accepted at the age of eighteen.|$|E
25|$|Underwood {{was almost}} unplayable on damp wickets, but on dry tracks he would often push the ball through a little quicker and flatter, {{not wanting to}} risk being hit over his head, which he <b>always</b> <b>hated.</b> Oddly, he rarely {{completed}} a whole Test series for England, as a succession of England captains would switch to bigger turners of the ball, such as Norman Gifford.|$|E
500|$|Speaking {{out against}} homophobia, Radcliffe began filming public service {{announcements}} in 2009 for The Trevor Project, promoting awareness of gay teen suicide prevention. He first learned of the organisation while working on Equus on Broadway in 2008 and has contributed financially to it. [...] "I have <b>always</b> <b>hated</b> anybody who is not tolerant of gay men or lesbians or bisexuals. Now I am in the very fortunate position where I can actually help or do something about it," [...] {{he said in a}} 2010 interview. In the same interview, he spoke of the importance of public figures advocating for equal rights. Radcliffe received The Trevor Project's Hero Award in 2011 for his contributions.|$|E

6000|$|I <b>always</b> <b>hate</b> it, and I avenged {{myself by}} {{answering}} simply, [...] "Bless my soul, {{he has no}} business!" [...] and letting him take up the word now or not, as he liked.|$|R

500|$|Ned Flanders' {{religion}} was {{not mentioned in}} his first few appearances {{and in the first}} few seasons he was only mildly religious and his primary role was to be so [...] "cloyingly perfect as to annoy and shame the Simpsons", whereas Homer Simpson has <b>always</b> <b>hated</b> Ned Flanders and always tries to undermine him. There has been a consistent effort among the show's writers to make him not just [...] "goody good and an unsympathetic person". In the later seasons, Flanders has become more of a caricature of the Christian right, and his role as an irritating [...] "perfect neighbor" [...] has been lessened. For example, some recent episodes Flanders has appeared to show rather prejudiced attitudes towards gays and people of religions other than Christianity.|$|E
500|$|Shearsmith {{identified}} [...] "The Riddle of the Sphinx" [...] {{as one of}} his two favourite {{episodes of}} the series, along with [...] "The Devil of Christmas". For the writers, the episode was not comedic, and they expressed awareness of the differences between episodes of Inside No. 9 like [...] "The Riddle of the Sphinx" [...] and the expectations of viewers for television comedies. The pair acknowledged the particular complexity of the plot, with Pemberton saying [...] "If you missed two sentences in a row, you'd be like 'what?' Even I was thinking how are people following this? It's insane." [...] Pemberton also noted that not everyone enjoys crosswords, hence [...] "I <b>always</b> <b>hated</b> cryptic crosswords. Why can't people just say what they mean instead of trying to trick you all the time?" [...] from Shearsmith's Tyler.|$|E
500|$|The {{band has}} made heavy use of guitars since its inception, and pioneered their {{use during the}} band's early days in Germany. Although not a metal fan, Konietzko said his [...] "infatuation with ripping off metal licks" [...] stemmed from his {{experiments}} with E-mu's Emax sampler in late 1986, adding, [...] "What I <b>always</b> <b>hated</b> most about heavy metal was that the best riffs came only once and were never repeated. So the fascination, actually, was to sample a great riff, loop it, and play {{it over and over}} again." [...] While the album Don't Blow Your Top was more sparse in content, due to the influence of producer Sherwood, it was {{the exception rather than the}} rule. Ministry founder and frontman Al Jourgensen, on tour with the band in 1989, described KMFDM as [...] "a battalion of guitars marching through Europe." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Maybe,' said Robina, a {{sensible}} little woman; 'but you'll do no good by half and half. If you don't {{do well in}} the examination, Felix will be horribly vexed, and you'll <b>always</b> <b>hate</b> the thought of it.' ...|$|R

500|$|The South Park {{football}} team plays a rival team from Middle Park, Colorado. Like South Park itself, Middle Park is an actual basin in the Rocky Mountains of north-central Colorado. Matt Stone said the Middle Park kids {{were made to}} seem richer and cooler than the South Park students {{because that was the}} perception real South Park residents have of the actual Middle Park. Richard Stamos, who sings during halftime in the episode's football game, is the fictional brother of John Stamos, a real-life actor best known for his roles on Full House and ER. Trey Parker and Matt Stone did not know Stamos when they wrote [...] "Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride", but Parker said they assumed he was [...] "a big douche" [...] because of his role on Full House, which Parker called [...] "just the most horrible thing ever put on television". Since the episode aired, however, Parker and Stone have become acquainted with Stamos and found him to be [...] "a really, really cool guy". John Stamos told them he loved the inclusion of the Richard Stamos character in [...] "Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride". Richard Stamos sings [...] "Lovin' You", a 1975 hit single by singer-songwriter Minnie Riperton. Parker chose it because he felt it was a popular song in the gay community, and also because, [...] "I've just <b>always</b> <b>hated</b> that song. I hate any song from that era, really. It's just a horrible time for music." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{holding the}} press conference, Litvinenko was {{dismissed}} from the FSB. Later, {{in an interview}} with Yelena Tregubova, Putin said that he personally ordered the dismissal of Litvinenko, stating, [...] "I fired Litvinenko and disbanded his unit ...because FSB officers should not stage press conferences. This is not their job. And they should not make internal scandals public." [...] Litvinenko also believed that Putin was behind his arrest. He said, [...] "Putin had the power to decide whether to pass my file to the prosecutors or not. He <b>always</b> <b>hated</b> me. And there was a bonus for him: by throwing me to the wolves he distanced himself from Boris [...] in the eyes of FSB's generals." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although Bond {{had made}} him a star, Connery {{eventually}} grew tired of the role and the pressure the franchise put on him, saying [...] " [...] fed up to here with the whole Bond bit" [...] and [...] "I have <b>always</b> <b>hated</b> that damned James Bond. I'd like to kill him". Michael Caine said of the situation, [...] "If you were his friend in these early days you didn't raise the subject of Bond. He was, and is, a much better actor than just playing James Bond, but he became synonymous with Bond. He'd be {{walking down the street}} and people would say, [...] "Look, there's James Bond." [...] That was particularly upsetting to him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{perhaps you}} won't <b>always</b> <b>hate</b> him. Some day {{you may have}} a chance to do him a good turn. It's rather banale; but there doesn't seem any other way. Well, I have given you his message. Are you going with me to get that poem?" ...|$|R
6000|$|When {{she thanked}} {{me for being}} so REASONABLE I told her I was [...] not doing it to please her, but for Paul's sake, because I [...] would not spoil his life, and that I would <b>always</b> <b>hate</b> her. [...] She smiled again and went away.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{he was a}} jolly decent fellow—generous, open-handed. The folks didn't like him, {{because they}} couldn't {{get to the bottom}} of him; they <b>always</b> <b>hate</b> a thing they can't fathom. He was close, there's no mistake—save when he was asleep sometimes." [...] The doctor looked at his glass and sighed.|$|R
2500|$|Figgis had {{problems}} because permits were not issued for some street scenes. This {{caused him to}} film some scenes on the Las Vegas strip in one take to avoid the police, which Figgis said benefited production and {{the authenticity of the}} acting, remarking [...] "I've <b>always</b> <b>hated</b> the convention of shooting on a street, and then having to stop the traffic, and then having to tell the actors, 'Well, there's meant to be traffic here, so you're going to have to shout'. And they're shouting, but it's quiet and they feel really stupid, because it's unnatural. You put them up against a couple of trucks, with it all happening around them, and their voices become great".|$|E
2500|$|Henry Miller's Theatre, on West 43rd Street in New York City, {{was renamed}} the Stephen Sondheim Theatre on September 15, 2010 for the composer's 80th birthday. In {{attendance}} were Nathan Lane, Patti LuPone and John Weidman. Sondheim said {{in response to}} the honor, [...] "I'm deeply embarrassed. Thrilled, but deeply embarrassed. I've <b>always</b> <b>hated</b> my last name. It just doesn't sing. I mean, it's not Belasco. And it's not Rodgers and it's not Simon. And it's not Wilson. It just doesn't sing. It sings better than Schoenfeld and Jacobs. But it just doesn't sing". Lane said, [...] "We love our corporate sponsors and we love their money, but there's something sacred about naming a theatre, and there's something about this that is right and just".|$|E
2500|$|Around this time, Bankhead {{began to}} attract a passionate and highly loyal {{following}} of gay men, some of whom she employed as help when her lifestyle began to take a toll on her, affectionately calling them her [...] "caddies". Though she had long struggled with addiction, her condition now worsened – she began taking dangerous cocktails of drugs to fall asleep, and her maid had to tape her arms down to prevent her from consuming pills during her periods of intermittent wakefulness. In her later years, Bankhead had serious accidents and several psychotic episodes from sleep deprivation and hypnotic drug abuse. Though she <b>always</b> <b>hated</b> being alone, her struggle with loneliness began to lapse into a depression. In 1956, playing the truth game with Tennessee Williams, she confessed, [...] "I’m fifty-four, and I wish always, always, for death. I’ve always wanted death. Nothing else do I want more." ...|$|E
60|$|Will {{you let me}} know, {{either at}} Southampton or Portsmouth, whether any of you, {{and how many of}} you, if any, are coming over, so that Arthur Smith may reserve good seats? Tell Lotty I hope she does not {{contemplate}} coming to the morning reading; I <b>always</b> <b>hate</b> it so myself.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Master, {{that is the}} truth, or part of it. You {{saved my}} life, and {{sheltered}} me when I was alone in a strange land, and for this and for yourself I came to love you very greatly, and love, if it be true, is always jealous and <b>always</b> <b>hates</b> a rival." ...|$|R
60|$|Party men <b>always</b> <b>hate</b> a {{slightly}} differing friend {{more than a}} downright enemy. I quite calculate on my being one day or other holden in worse repute by many Christians than the Unitarians and open infidels. It must be undergone by every one who loves the truth {{for its own sake}} beyond all other things.|$|R
2500|$|Agassi's autobiography, Open: An Autobiography, (written with {{assistance}} from J. R. Moehringer), {{was published in}} November 2009. In it, Agassi admitted that he used and tested positive for methamphetamine in 1997. In response to this revelation, Roger Federer declared himself shocked and disappointed, while Marat Safin argued that Agassi should return his prize money and be stripped of his titles. In {{an exclusive interview with}} CBS, Agassi justified himself and asked for understanding, saying that [...] "It was a period in my life where I needed help." [...] He also revealed that he had <b>always</b> <b>hated</b> tennis during his career because of the constant pressure it exerted on him. He also revealed he wore a hairpiece earlier in his career and thought Pete Sampras was [...] "robotic". The book reached No. 1 on the New York Times Best Seller list and received favorable reviews. It won the Autobiography category of the 2010 British Sports Book Awards.|$|E
2500|$|In The OMAC Project limited series, Booster Gold gathers the old Justice League International heroes to {{investigate}} Blue Beetle's disappearance. At the series' end, he is ruined physically and emotionally, having destroyed {{much of his}} gear {{in the fight against}} the OMACs. He has seen his friend Rocket Red die in battle. He discovered that another friend, Maxwell Lord, is responsible for killing Blue Beetle and that in fact, Lord <b>always</b> <b>hated</b> metahumans and superheroes. In a moment of self-reflection, he realizes that if only he had bothered to recall more of what was history in his native era, he {{might have been able to}} warn his friends. Giving a farewell kiss to the forehead of his wounded teammate Fire as she lay in a hospital bed, he drops his trademark goggles on the floor and leaves, saying only that he has decided to [...] "go home", implying a return to the 25th century.|$|E
2500|$|In 1801, {{his mother}} {{declared}} [...] "he {{must go to}} a public school", and Byron was soon after sent to Harrow. His experience at Harrow was dissatisfying to Byron as his lame foot, his lack of money, and his previously neglected education caused to say later that [...] "I <b>always</b> <b>hated</b> Harrow till {{the last year and}} a half." [...] The Headmaster, Dr Joseph Drury, believed that Byron was [...] "a wild mountain colt" [...] who had a [...] "supersensitive vanity", and as a result placed him under the individual tutorial guidance of his own son Henry Drury, an assistant master, until he could be placed in a class of boys that were his own age. In response to the harsh treatment that he felt that he received at Harrow from the schoolmasters and some of the fellow students, Byron wrote to his mother in 1804: [...] "I will cut myself a path through the world or perish in the attempt. Others have begun life with nothing and ended Greatly. And shall I who have a competent if not a large fortune, remain idle, No, I will carve myself the passage to Grandeur, but never with Dishonour." ...|$|E

"There, Baas, {{that is the}} truth, and all the truth, {{and that}} is why I hate Baas Frank, because he shot my father and mother, and why Baas Frank hates me, because he cannot forget that he did it and because I saw him do it, for, as our people say, 'one <b>always</b> <b>hates</b> a man one has wounded with a spear.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For one thing," [...] {{she said}} hesitatingly, and casting her eyes down, [...] "I <b>always</b> <b>hate</b> those who injure me--and--and I am very unforgiving."

2500|$|In 1900, Chamberlain visited Britain for {{the first}} time in decades, a place he disparagingly called [...] "the land of the Boer-eaters". Writing to Cosima Wagner from London, Chamberlain stated sadly that his Britain, the Britain of aristocratic rule, hard work and manly courage, the romanticized [...] "Merry Old England" [...] of his {{imagination}} was no more; replaced by what Chamberlain saw as a materialist, soulless society dominated entirely by greed, atomized into individuals with no sense of the collective purpose. Chamberlain wrote that Britain since the 1880s had [...] "chosen the service of Mammon", for which he blamed the Jews, writing to Wagner: [...] "This is the result, when one has studied politics with a Jew for a quarter century". The [...] "Jew" [...] Chamberlain was referring to was Disraeli, whom Chamberlain had <b>always</b> <b>hated</b> with a passion. Chamberlain concluded: [...] "My old England was nowhere recognizable". Chamberlain declared in his letter that all British businessmen were now dishonest; the middle class smug and stupid; small farmers and shops no longer able to compete with Jewish-owned big business; and the monarchy was [...] "irretrievably weakened" [...] by social change. In short, for Chamberlain Britain was no longer his country.|$|E

60|$|Sunshine was on Luggela, and Horatia's ailments were abating, so, as {{her temper}} was not alleviated, Lucilla thought peace {{would be best}} {{preserved}} by sallying out to sketch.

6000|$|... "Mr. Winters, whom I shall <b>always</b> <b>hate</b> for it, {{has been}} telling that at some battle in Virginia, where he got his hurt, you were seen {{crouching}} behind a tree.
