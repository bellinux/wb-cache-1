40|$|International audienceThe former use <b>of</b> {{chlordecone}} (<b>CLD)</b> in the French West Indies {{has resulted}} in long-term pollution of soils and <b>of</b> food chains. <b>CLD</b> may be transferred into eggs of hens reared outdoors, through polluted soil ingestion. Tropical volcanic soils display variable capacities <b>of</b> pollutant retention: <b>CLD</b> is less available and more persistent in andosol than in nitisol. The impact of soil type on CLD bioavailability to hens was tested through a relative bioavailability study. The deposition <b>of</b> <b>CLD</b> in egg yolk and in abdominal fat was measured in 42 individually housed laying hens fed with diets containing graded levels <b>of</b> <b>CLD</b> from polluted andosol, nitisol, or spiked oil during 23 days. Within each ingested matrix, the concentration <b>of</b> <b>CLD</b> in yolk and in abdominal fat linearly increased with the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> ingested <b>CLD</b> (P 0. 1), indicating that CLD was equally bioavailable to laying hens, irrespective of the matrix. This suggests that the hen's gastrointestinal tract efficiently extracts CLD from the two tropical volcanic soils, regardless of their retention capacity. Thus, hens reared on polluted soils with CLD may lay contaminated eggs...|$|R
40|$|Chronic {{liver disease}} (CLD) is a chronic {{condition}} {{that has a}} variety of causes, including alcohol consumption, exposure to various drugs and toxic chemicals, and viral hepatitis.

Inflammasomes are multiprotein complexes that can sense and recognize various exogenous and endogenous danger signals, eventually activating interleukin (IL) - 1 β and IL- 18. The sensor component of the inflammasome system is a nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD) -like receptors (NLRs). The NLRs family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP 3) inflammasome {{has been involved in}} the initiation and progression <b>of</b> <b>CLD.</b> However, the molecular mechanisms by which it triggers liver inflammation and damage remain unclear.

Additionally, we also discuss various pharmacological inhibitors identifying the NLRP 3 inflammasome signaling cascade as novel therapeutic targets in the treatment <b>of</b> <b>CLD.</b> In summary, this review summarizes the relevance of the NLRP 3 inflammasome in the initiation and progression <b>of</b> <b>CLD,</b> and provides critical targets to suppress the development <b>of</b> <b>CLD</b> in clinical management...|$|R
40|$|The former use <b>of</b> {{chlordecone}} (<b>CLD)</b> in the French West Indies {{has resulted}} in long-term pollution <b>of</b> soils. <b>CLD</b> {{is known to be}} potentially transferred towards animal products of animals reared outdoors, mainly through accidental soil ingestion. Several studies indicate that soil bound CLD is bioavailable when administered to farm animals. Currently {{there is a need to}} quantify the level <b>of</b> <b>CLD</b> absorption and its toxicokinetic characteristics in the ruminant and particularly in the goat. These are considered as important farm species in the French West Indies. The objective of this study was to evaluate the absorption rate and the half-life <b>of</b> <b>CLD</b> in the non-lactating goat. The goats were administered either intravenously (i. v., n ¼ 6) or orally (p. o., n ¼ 6) one dose (1 mg kg 1 body weight) <b>of</b> <b>CLD.</b> Blood samples were collected at defined times up to 160 days post-dosing. CLD was analyzed in serum by highresolution gas chromatography. A comparison of the area under the serum concentration-time curves (AUC) showed that the i. v. route is equivalent to the oral route. Thus, CLD is considered almost completely absorbed after p. o. administration, as shown by the mean absolute bioavailability. The comparison between the pharmacokinetic profiles <b>of</b> <b>CLD</b> following oral and intravenous dose showed a difference during the first 14 days and a similar kinetic after this period.

40|$|SpringerStudy objectives: Previous {{studies have}} shown that it is {{possible}} to improve the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of chronic lung disease (CLD) patients without a concurrent change in morbidity. A valid CLD index that discriminates between different levels <b>of</b> <b>CLD</b> severity and is associated with HRQoL status is an important tool for primary care settings. In this study a symptom-based CLD index was assessed for its validity and relationship with HRQoL in a representative Australian population sample. The study also measured the prevalence <b>of</b> self-reported <b>CLD.</b> Design: Representative population survey of adults aged 18 years and over using a multistage, systematic, clustered area sample. Setting: Metropolitan Adelaide and country centres in South Australia with a population of over 1000 persons. Participants: Three hundred twenty-nine adults with CLD identified through a representative population survey of 3010 South Australians. Measurements and Results: The CLD index and the SF- 36 were administered to participants to assess the association between each subscale <b>of</b> the <b>CLD</b> index with each HRQoL scale. The CLD index was also used to assess the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>CLD</b> and the distribution of severity in self-reported CLD in the South Australian population. Each symptom sub-scale <b>of</b> the <b>CLD</b> index was significantly correlated with all scales of the SF- 36. The prevalence <b>of</b> <b>CLD</b> as measured by the CLD index was 7. 7 % (mild), 2. 2 % (moderate) and 1. 0 % (severe). Conclusions: In the Australian context the CLD index is a reliable patient interview instrument that can be used to assess the effects <b>of</b> <b>CLD</b> on general HRQoL, improve assessment, and lead to interventions for physicians and their patients.

Root-shoot transfer <b>of</b> <b>CLD</b> was compared in the two species after two growing periods (2 then 6 months) after transplantation. CLD was found in all plant organs, roots, rhizomes, stems, leaves, and even flower spikes. The highest concentration <b>of</b> <b>CLD</b> was in the roots, 5398 ± 1636 (M. × giganteus) and 14842 ± 3210 ng g− 1 DW (M. sinensis), whereas the concentration in shoots was lower, 152 ± 28 (M. × giganteus) and 266 ± 70 ng g− 1 DW (M. sinensis) in soil contaminated at 1 mg kg− 1.

Methods: This was a long follow-up randomized clinical trial. The prophylactic effect of aminophylline on the incidence <b>of</b> <b>CLD</b> was investigated in very premature infants. The study group received aminophylline for the 1 st 10 days of life and control infants received no aminophylline during the 1 st 10 days of life. Results: Fifty-two infants participated (26 aminophylline, 26 controls). Premature infants on aminophylline had clearly shorter oxygen dependency time than those in the control group.

The findings show that: (1) In the first years: (a) CLD treatment has not been adequately performed; it means that the exact solution has not been found out in learning accommodation for CLD; (b) teachers 2 ̆ 7 perception and expectation on learning problems <b>of</b> <b>CLD</b> have not been quite positive; (c) the prototype <b>of</b> <b>CLD</b> treatment based on learning accommodation has been limitedly to test-driven and can be developed as a model <b>of</b> treatment for <b>CLD</b> in the elementary school. Its implementation is based on a manual of learning accommodation application for CLD. (2) In the second years, the model and product have been validated through the main field testing and operational field testing; and stated as a fit and effective model <b>of</b> <b>CLD</b> treatment in the elementary school. The effectiveness of the accommodation learning treatment is evident from indicators that the elementery school teachers have applied the model and product found in the manual books for CLD instructional flexibilities. In addition, the application of the model has improved the (a) learning motivation; (b) social interaction; and (c) academic achievement of CL...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Chronic {{lung disease}} (CLD) in the preterm newborn is {{associated}} with inflammation and fibrosis. Platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), a potent chemotactic growth factor, may mediate the fibrotic component <b>of</b> <b>CLD.</b> The objectives <b>of</b> this study were to determine if tracheal aspirate (TA) concentrations of PDGF-BB increase the first 2 weeks of life in premature neonates undergoing mechanical ventilation for respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), {{its relationship to the}} development <b>of</b> <b>CLD,</b> pulmonary hemorrhage (PH) and its relationship to airway colonization with Ureaplasma urealyticum (Uu). Methods Infants with a birth weight less than 1500 grams who required mechanical ventilation for RDS were enrolled into this study with parental consent. Tracheal aspirates were collected daily during clinically indicated suctioning. Uu cultures were performed on TA collected {{in the first week of}} life. TA supernatants were assayed for PDGF-BB and secretory component of IgA concentrations using ELISA techniques. Results Fifty premature neonates were enrolled into the study. Twenty-eight infants were oxygen dependent at 28 days of life and 16 infants were oxygen dependent at 36 weeks postconceptual age. PDGF-BB concentrations peaked between 4 and 6 days of life. Maximum PDGF-BB concentrations were significantly higher in infants who developed CLD or died from respiratory failure. PH was associated with increased risk <b>of</b> <b>CLD</b> and was associated with higher PDGF-BB concentrations. There was no correlation between maximum PDGF-BB concentrations and Uu isolation from the airway. Conclusions PDGF-BB concentrations increase in TAs of infants who undergo mechanical ventilation for RDS during the first 2 weeks of life and maximal concentrations are greater in those infants who subsequently develop CLD. Elevation in lung PDGF-BB may play a role in the development <b>of</b> <b>CLD.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|International audienceChlordecone (CLD) is an {{organochlorine}} insecticide {{that was used}} from 1978 to 1993 in the French West Indies (FWI) to control the populations of black weevil in banana plantations. This pesticide, with recognized neurotoxic, endrocrine, reproductive and carcinogenic effects, is nowadays responsible of an unprecedented sanitary, economic and social crisis in FWI. Thanks to the management options taken in the past years by the authorities to avoid the population dietary exposure the crisis is fortunately essentially contained. A final {{solution to the problem}} would consist however to eliminate the source <b>of</b> <b>CLD</b> responsible for the diffuse pollution of all the FWI environmental compartments and related food resources and so to destroy the stock <b>of</b> <b>CLD</b> still presents in the soils. One of the cheapest and most environmental friendly destruction methods corresponds to microbial degradation. Such a mode of destruction seems to be particularly appropriate in the case of FWI since it can often be implemented in situ, using techniques (e. g., watering; addition of nutrients, labile organic matter, microorganisms) that are fairly easy to incorporate into existing agricultural practices. The latter is important as the pollution is estimated to cover some 19, 000 ha of arable lands. Until now however {{there is no evidence of}} natural attenuation in the environments impacted by chlordecone and so of the possibility to stimulate the rate of the process. The reason usually advocated to explain this apparent absence of degradation in the environment is the peculiar chemical structure <b>of</b> <b>CLD</b> (bishomocubane “cage” structure with a high steric hindrance caused by the 10 chlorine atoms bound to the cage), coupled to its low aqueous solubility (3 mg/l at 20 °C) and high hydrophobicity (Log Kow 20 °C, pH 7 = 4. 5) that would make it refractory to degradation. In this chapter through a thermodynamic approach, we demonstrate that there is no energetic reason why the structure <b>of</b> <b>CLD</b> should not be amenable to microbial degradation and we propose some possible reasons for the apparent absence <b>of</b> <b>CLD</b> degradation in FWI and what could be done to reverse the situation...|$|R
40|$|Claudin (Cld) - 4 is one <b>of</b> the {{dominant}} <b>Clds</b> {{expressed in the}} kidney and urinary tract, including selective segments of renal nephrons and the entire urothelium from the pelvis to the bladder. We generated Cldn 4 (-/-) mice and found that these mice had increased mortality due to hydronephrosis of relatively late onset. While the renal nephrons of Cldn 4 (-/-) mice showed a concomitant diminution <b>of</b> <b>Cld</b> 8 expression at tight junction (TJ), accumulation <b>of</b> <b>Cld</b> 3 at TJ was markedly enhanced in compensation and the overall TJ structure was unaffected. Nonetheless, Cldn 4 (-/-) mice showed slightly yet significantly increased fractional excretion of Ca(2 +) and Cl(-), suggesting a role <b>of</b> <b>Cld</b> 4 in the specific reabsorption of these ions via a paracellular route. Although the urine volume tended to be increased concordantly, Cldn 4 (-/-) mice were capable of concentrating urine normally on dehydration, with no evidence of diabetes insipidus. In the urothelium, the formation of TJs and uroplaques {{as well as the}} gross barrier function were also unaffected. However, intravenous pyelography analysis indicated retarded urine flow prior to hydronephrosis. Histological examination revealed diffuse hyperplasia and a thickening of pelvic and ureteral urothelial layers with markedly increased BrdU uptake in vivo. These results suggest that progressive hydronephrosis in Cldn 4 (-/-) mice arises from urinary tract obstruction due to urothelial hyperplasia, and that Cld 4 {{plays an important role in}} maintaining the homeostatic integrity of normal urothelium...|$|R

40|$|Background: Chronic liver {{diseases}} (CLDs) {{are significant}} {{causes of death}} in adults in many countries and are usually diagnosed at late stages. Early detection may allow time for treatment to prevent disease progression. Objectives: The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the feasibility of screening for unrecognized CLDs in a primary care nurse consultancy and report findings from screening. Methods: Two experienced nurses in a primary care nurse consultancy were trained to perform transient elastography (TE). Subjects aged from 18 to 70 years were identified randomly from the health registry and invited to participate in a feasibility pilot study. Exclusion criteria were past or current history of liver diseases. Nurses collected demographic and clinical data and performed TE tests using Fibroscan tomeasure liver stiffness; a cutoff score of 6. 8 kPa or greater was used as an indicator of the presence <b>of</b> <b>CLD</b> with fibrosis. Results: Accurate measurements were obtained in 495 of 502 participants (98. 6 %). Prevalence of elevated liver stiffness was observed in 28 of 495 subjects (5. 7 %). Compared to patients with normal liver stiffness, patients with increased liver stiffness were older, were more frequently male, and had higher frequency of metabolic syndrome. Nonalcoholic fatty liver was the most common cause <b>of</b> <b>CLD.</b> Discussion: Following training in procedures for conducting TE, nurses in a primary care clinic were able to detect unrecognized CLDs in presumably healthy subjects. Early detection <b>of</b> <b>CLDs</b> is feasible in primary care clinics and may facilitate identification <b>of</b> undiagnosed <b>CLD</b> in adults...|$|R
40|$|Chlordecone (CLD) was an {{organochlorine}} insecticide whose previous use {{resulted in an}} extensive pollution of the environment with severe health effects and social consequences. A closely related compound, 5 b-hydrochlordecone (5 b-hydroCLD), has been searched for and often detected in environmental matrices from the geographical area where CLD was applied. The current consensus considered that its presence was {{not the result of}} a biotic or abiotic dechlorination <b>of</b> <b>CLD</b> in these matrices but rather the consequence of its presence as impurity (synthesis by-product) in the CLD released into the environment. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine if and to what extent degradation <b>of</b> <b>CLD</b> into 5 b-hydroCLD occurred in the field. To test this hypothesis, the ratios of 5 b-hydroCLD and CLD concentrations in a dataset of 810 soils collected between 2006 and 2012 in Martinique were compared to the ratios measured in 3 samples <b>of</b> the <b>CLD</b> dust commercial formulations applied in the banana fields of French West Indies (FWI) and 1 sample <b>of</b> the technical-grade <b>CLD</b> corresponding to the active ingredient used in such formulations. Soil data were processed with a hierarchical Bayesian model to account for random measurement errors and data censoring. Any pathway <b>of</b> <b>CLD</b> transformation into 5 b-hydroCLD occurring over the long term in FWI soils would indeed change the ratio of 5 b-hydroCLD/CLD compared to what it was in the initially applied formulations. Results showed a significant increase of the 5 b-hydroCLD/CLD ratio in the soils- 25 times greater in soil than in commercial formulations-which suggested that natural CLD transformation into 5 b-hydroCLD over the long term occurred in these soils. Results from this study may impact future decisions for the remediation of the polluted areas...|$|R
40|$|A {{physiological}} model {{based on}} diffusional clearance (<b>CLD)</b> <b>of</b> drug between plasma and interstitial fluid (IF) {{was used to}} describe the disposition of beta-lactam antimicrobial agents. The CLD represents the movement of drug in and out of physiological spaces and is dependent only on the transfer properties of the drug. Estimates <b>of</b> <b>CLD</b> obtained by fitting model equations to plasma concentration-time data for 11 cephalosporin studies in human subjects fell in a fairly narrow range, with a mean value of 1, 604 ml/min. Estimates <b>of</b> the <b>CLD</b> between plasma and blister fluid for three of the cephalosporins were five orders of magnitude smaller than the CLD. These observations are explained in terms of diffusion principles. Computer simulations with this model were used to assess the effect of changes in IF protein binding on antimicrobial distribution. Increases in the bound fraction of drug in IF enhanced the penetration of total (bound and unbound) drug into IF, but had no effect on the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> unbound, active antimicrobial agent reaching the IF. The time course of unbound drug in IF was altered, however, by changes in IF protein binding. This model may also be used to predict changes in the IF distribution of beta-lactam antimicrobial agents in disease states, particularly those in which the relative distribution of albumin between plasma and IF has been altered...|$|R

40|$|Until recently, little {{attention}} has been given to chronic lung disease (CLD) in HIV-infected children. As the HIV epidemic matures in sub-Saharan Africa, adolescents who acquired HIV by vertical transmission are presenting to health services with chronic diseases.

40|$|International audienceThe former use <b>of</b> {{chlordecone}} (<b>CLD)</b> in the French West Indies {{has resulted}} in long-term pollution of soils. In this area, CLD may be transferred into eggs of hens reared outdoors, through soil ingestion. In order to assess this risk, a kinetic study involving the contamination of laying hens (22 weeks of age) with a diet containing 500 mu g CLD kg(- 1) during 42 d, followed by a depuration period of 35 d was carried out. Forty-four hens were sequentially slaughtered all over the experimental period and their liver, egg, abdominal fat and serum were collected. Two additional edible tissues, pectoral and leg muscles, were collected in hens slaughtered {{at the end of}} the contamination period. The depuration half-life <b>of</b> <b>CLD</b> in liver, egg, abdominal fat and serum was estimated at 5. 0 +/- 0. 38 (mean +/- SE), 5. 5 +/- 0. 29, 5. 3 +/- 0. 37 and 5. 1 +/- 0. 66 d, respectively. CLD concentration {{at the end of the}} contamination period reached 1640 +/- 274, 460 +/- 41, 331 +/- 23, and 213 +/- 8. 5 mu g kg(- 1) fresh matter (FM), respectively. The corresponding concentrations in pectoral and leg muscles were 119 +/- 8. 4, 127 +/- 11 mu g kg(- 1) FM, respectively. The steady state carry over rate <b>of</b> <b>CLD</b> in eggs reached 43 +/- 7. 6 %. This experiment demonstrates the preferential accumulation <b>of</b> <b>CLD</b> in liver, its significant transfer to eggs and its quite short half-life.
