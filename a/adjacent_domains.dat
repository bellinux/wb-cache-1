50|$|In {{molecular}} biology, the GGDEF domain is {{a protein}} domain {{which appears to}} be ubiquitous in bacteria and is often linked to a regulatory domain, such as a phosphorylation receiver or oxygen sensing domain. Its function is to act as a diguanylate cyclase and synthesize cyclic di-GMP, which is used as an intracellular signalling molecule {{in a wide variety of}} bacteria. Enzymatic activity can be strongly influenced by the <b>adjacent</b> <b>domains.</b> Processes regulated by this domain include exopolysaccharide synthesis, biofilm formation, motility and cell differentiation.|$|E
50|$|The {{diffraction}} {{power of}} a crystalline material, and thus {{the intensity of the}} diffracted beam, changes with the type and number of atoms inside the crystal unit cell. This fact is quantitatively expressed by the structure factor. Different materials have different structure factors, and similarly for different phases of the same material (e.g. for materials crystallizing in several different space groups). In samples composed of a mixture of materials/phases in spatially <b>adjacent</b> <b>domains,</b> the geometry of these domains can be resolved by topography. This is true, for example, also for twinned crystals, ferroelectric domains, and many others.|$|E
50|$|Bandwidth Brokers can be {{configured}} with organizational policies, {{keep track}} of the current allocation of marked traffic, and interpret new requests to mark traffic in light of the policies and current allocation. Bandwidth Brokers only need to establish relationships of limited trust with their peers in <b>adjacent</b> <b>domains,</b> unlike schemes that require the setting of flow specifications in routers throughout an end-to-end path. In practical technical terms, the Bandwidth Broker architecture makes it possible to keep state on an administrative domain basis, rather than at every router, and the DiffServ architecture makes it possible to confine per flow state to just the edge or leaf routers.|$|E

50|$|They also co-occur with LRR <b>adjacent</b> <b>domains.</b> These are small, all {{beta strand}} domains, {{which have been}} {{structurally}} described for the protein Internalin (InlA) and related proteins InlB, InlE, InlH from the pathogenic bacterium Listeria monocytogenes. Their function appears to be mainly structural: They are fused to the C-terminal end of leucine-rich repeats, significantly stabilising the LRR, and forming a common rigid entity with the LRR. They are themselves not involved in protein-protein-interactions but help to present the adjacent LRR-domain for this purpose. These domains belong {{to the family of}} Ig-like domains in that they consist of two sandwiched beta sheets that follow the classical connectivity of Ig-domains. The beta strands in one of the sheets is, however, much smaller than in most standard Ig-like domains, making it somewhat of an outlier.|$|E
5000|$|... cbEGF-like domains show no {{significant}} structural deviations from EGF-like domains; however, {{as the name}} suggests, cbEGF-like domains bind a single calcium ion. The binding affinity to calcium varies widely and often depends on <b>adjacent</b> <b>domains.</b> The consensus motif for calcium binding is Asp-Leu/Ile-Asp-Gln-Cys. Coordination of calcium strongly correlates with an unusual posttranslational modification of cbEGF-like domains: either an asparagine or aspartate is beta-hydroxylated giving rise to erythro-beta-hydroxyasparagine (Hyn) or erythro-beta-hydroxyaspartic acid (Hya), respectively. Hya {{can be found in}} the N-terminal cbEGF module (see below) of factors IX, X, and protein C. The Hyn modification appears to be more prevalent than Hya and has been shown to occur in fibrillin-1, an extracellular matrix protein. Both modifications are catalyzed by the dioxygenase Asp/Asn-beta-hydroxylase, and are unique to EGF domains in eukaryotes.|$|E
50|$|The crystal {{structure}} of N(10)-formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase from Moorella thermoacetica {{shows that the}} subunit is composed of three domains organised around three mixed beta-sheets. There are two cavities between <b>adjacent</b> <b>domains.</b> One of them was identified as the nucleotide binding site by homology modelling. The large domain contains a seven-stranded beta-sheet surrounded by helices on both sides. The second domain contains a five-stranded beta-sheet with two alpha-helices packed on one side while {{the other two are}} a wall of the active site cavity. The third domain contains a four-stranded beta-sheet forming a half-barrel. The concave side is covered by two helices while the convex side is another wall of the large cavity. Arg 97 is likely involved in formyl phosphate binding. The tetrameric molecule is relatively flat with the shape of the letter X, and the active sites are located {{at the end of the}} subunits far from the subunit interface.|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} {{proteins}} to regulate their own enzymatic activity can be facilitated {{by changes in}} structure or protein dynamics in response to external regulators. Because many proteins contain SH 2 and SH 3 domains, transmission of information between the domains is a potential method of allosteric regulation. To determine if ligand binding to one modular domain may alter structural dynamics in an <b>adjacent</b> <b>domain,</b> allowing potential transmission of information through the protein, we used hydrogen exchange and mass spectrometry to measure changes in protein dynamics in the SH 3 and SH 2 domains of hematopoietic cell kinase (Hck). Ligand binding to either domain {{had little or no}} effect on hydrogen exchange in the <b>adjacent</b> <b>domain,</b> suggesting that changes in protein structure or dynamics are not a means of SH 2 /SH 3 crosstalk. Furthermore, ligands of varying affinity covalently attached to SH 3 /SH 2 altered dynamics only in the domain to which they bind. Such results demonstrate that ligand binding may not structurally alter adjacent SH 3 /SH 2 domains and implies that other aspects of protein architecture contribute to the multiple levels of regulation in proteins containing SH 3 and SH 2 domains...|$|R

40|$|The dipole {{patterns}} in the ferroelectric and antiferroelectric structures are drawn according to experimentally determined symmetry changes in the ferroelectrics and antiferroelectrics. For the ferroelectrics the dipoles of the unit cells for one domain are oriented in parallel and the directions of the polarisation in the <b>adjacent</b> <b>domains</b> are at definite angles to each other. It is assumed for the antiferroelectrics, that the superstructural unit cell is formed by the adjacent cells of the paraelectrical modification; the subcells having the antiparallel directions of the polarisation. It is these superstructural cells of the antiferroelectrics that are determined during the experimental investigations of the antiferroelectrics. The superstructural cells of the <b>adjacent</b> <b>domains</b> are different. In one case, {{the difference is that}} in the <b>adjacent</b> <b>domains,</b> the directions of the polarisation in the subcells form an angle (e. g., in PbZrO 3). In other cases the superstructural cells have not only different directions of the polarisation in the subcells but different signs of the enantiomorphism (e. g., NH 4 H 2 PO 4). In the third case, {{the only difference is that}} the superstructural unit cells in the <b>adjacent</b> <b>domains</b> are turned by an angle to each other round the direction of the subcell polarisation [e. g., (NH 4) 2 H 3 IO 6], etc...|$|E

40|$|Adhesion receptors of the {{classical}} cadherin family have {{a major role in}} establishing tissue organization and maintaining tissue homeostasis (Gumbiner, 1996). Classical cadherins are trans-membrane glycoproteins that use their extracellular domains to establish calcium-dependent trans homophilic interactions with cadherins in neighboring cells. To enhance adhesive strength, cadherin ectodomains oligomerize through lateral (cis) inter-actions, whereas their cytoplasmic domains anchor to the acto-myosin cytoskeleton. The cytoplasmic domain of cadherins is highly conserved and binds to proteins called catenins. p 120 -catenin (p 120) associates with the transmembrane <b>adjacent</b> <b>domain</b> (juxtamembrane; JMD) of the cadherin cytoplasmic tail, whereas -catenin interacts with the more distal portion of cad-herin’s cytoplasmic domain. -Catenin in turn, binds -catenin, which, through multiple interactions, both indirect and direct...|$|R
40|$|The σ-N (σN) subunit of the {{bacterial}} RNA polymerase is {{a sequence}} specific DNA-binding protein. The RNA polymerase holoenzyme formed with σN binds to promoters in an inactive form and only initiates transcription when activated by enhancer-binding positive control proteins. We now provide {{evidence to show}} that the DNA-binding activity of σN involves two distinct domains: a C-terminal DNA-binding domain that directly contacts DNA and an <b>adjacent</b> <b>domain</b> that enhances DNA-binding activity. The sequences required for the enhancement of DNA binding can be separated from the sequences required for core RNA polymerase binding. These results provide strong evidence for communication between domains within a transcription factor, likely to be important for the function of σN in enhancer-dependent transcription...|$|R

40|$|A multidomain global {{modeling}} {{technique is}} presented. The {{purpose of this}} multidomain methodology is to simultaneously analyze the three-dimensional compressible flow field in Space Shuttle main engine components. This technique provides flexibility and modularity for individual domain and also simplifies the grid generation task for each domain. A two-way coupling procedure is adopted for exchanging interface boundary conditions. This algorithm which requires that the <b>adjacent</b> <b>domains</b> share an overlapping grid slab, is fully conservative and implicit. For non-matching grid systems and for non-overlapping interfaces, an interpolation and/or extrapolation procedure is used when transferring the interface boundary conditions at the <b>adjacent</b> <b>domains.</b> To maintain overall conservation, a flux correction method is subsequently used. The coupling procedure was verified by modeling several geometries with features similar to SSME components. Satisfactory results for all test cases were obtained. Finally, this algorithm {{has been applied to}} the SSME flow simulation...|$|E

40|$|Extracellular matrix (ECM) {{underlies}} {{a complicated}} multicellular architecture that {{is subjected to}} significant forces from mechanical environment. Although various components of the ECM have been enumerated, mechanisms that evolve the sophisticated ECM architecture remain to be addressed. Here we show that periostin, a matricellular protein, promotes incorporation of tenascin-C into the ECM and organizes a meshwork architecture of the ECM. We found that both periostin null mice and tenascin-C null mice exhibited a similar phenotype, confined tibial periostitis, which possibly corresponds to medial tibial stress syndrome in human sports injuries. Periostin possessed <b>adjacent</b> <b>domains</b> that bind to tenascin-C and the other ECM protein: fibronectin and type I collagen, respectively. These <b>adjacent</b> <b>domains</b> functioned as a bridge between tenascin-C and the ECM, which increased deposition of tenascin-C on the ECM. The deposition of hexabrachions of tenascin-C may stabilize bifurcations of the ECM fibrils, which is integrated into the extracellular meshwork architecture. This study suggests a role for periostin in adaptation of the ECM architecture in the mechanical environment...|$|E

40|$|The {{symmetry}} of boundaries between ferroelectric, ferroelastic and antiphase domains {{is a key}} element for a theoretical understanding of their properties.

The domain wall symmetries are shown to coincide with directions of the order-parameter n-dimensional vector space, corresponding to sum of the vectors associated with <b>adjacent</b> <b>domain</b> states. This property is illustrated by the determination of the domain wall maximal symmetries in BaTiO 3, LaAlO 3, SrTiO 3 and Gd 2 (MoO 4) 3. Besides, the domain pattern in YMnO 3 is interpreted as resulting from an annihilation-creation process, the annihilation of the antiphase domain walls creating six ferroelectric domain walls merging at a single point.

40|$|The plasma {{membrane}} sodium/proton exchanger Salt-Overly-Sensitive 1 (SOS 1) {{is a critical}} salt tolerance determinant in plants. The SOS 2 -SOS 3 calcium-dependent protein kinase complex upregulates SOS 1 activity, but the mechanistic details of this crucial event remain unresolved.

The auto-inhibitory domain interacts intramolecularly with an <b>adjacent</b> <b>domain</b> of SOS 1 that is essential for activity. SOS 1 is relieved from auto-inhibition upon phosphorylation of the auto-inhibitory domain by SOS 2 -SOS 3.

We give numerical evidence that the coefficient of the area law term in these quantities is related to the coefficient of the area law term in the Rényi entropies. Whenever the curve shared by the <b>adjacent</b> <b>domains</b> contains vertices, a subleading logarithmic term occurs in these quantities and the numerical values of the corner function for some pairs of angles are obtained.

Among zero modes of string positions, the center of mass of strings in each region between two <b>adjacent</b> <b>domain</b> walls is shown to be non-normalizable whereas the rests are normalizable. We study dynamics of vortex-strings stretched between separated domain walls by using two methods, the moduli space (geodesic) approximation of full 1 / 4 BPS states and the charged particle approximation for string endpoints in the wall effective action. In the first method we obtain the effective Lagrangian explicitly and find the 90 degree scattering for head-on collision. In the second method the domain wall effective action {{is assumed to be}} U(1) N gauge theory, and we find a good agreement between two methods for well separated strings.
