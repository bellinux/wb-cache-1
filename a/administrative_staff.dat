5|$|After the Belgian {{surrender}} on 28 May 1940, the Germans {{formed a}} Militärverwaltung (Military Administration) in the country; commanded by the German aristocrat and career soldier, General Alexander von Falkenhausen.

5|$|At {{the time}} of {{graduation}} all officers are qualified for operational service. However, each employee must undergo 40 hours of yearly training, including firearms practice, to keep their operational certification. Without this, they cannot patrol, use firearms or participate in actions. Forty-four percent of police officers in 2012 lacked such certification. The main {{reason is that the}} police districts see it as a waste of resources to train investigation and <b>administrative</b> <b>staff</b> which do not participate in operative duty, and that a higher quality is achieved through specialization of tasks, such as dedicated investigation personnel.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} achieve this the {{military}} commander's staff was divided into military and administrative branches, and he was allocated personnel to form four area commands and about ten district commands, which reported to {{the chief of the}} <b>administrative</b> <b>staff,</b> and the military staff allocated the troops of the four local defence battalions across the area commands. The first military commander in the occupied territory was General der Flieger Helmuth Förster, a Luftwaffe officer, appointed on 20 April 1941, assisted by the chief of his <b>administrative</b> <b>staff,</b> SS-Brigadeführer and State Councillor, Dr. Harald Turner. Outside of the military commander's staff, there were several senior figures in Belgrade who represented key non-military arms of the German government. Prominent among these was NSFK-Obergruppenführer Franz Neuhausen, who had been initially appointed by Göring as plenipotentiary general for economic affairs in the territory on 17 April. A further key figure in the initial German administration was SS-Standartenführer Wilhelm Fuchs, who commanded Einsatzgruppe Serbia, which consisted of Sicherheitsdienst (Security Service, or SD) and Sicherheitspolizei (Security Police, or SiPo), and Geheime Staatspolizei (Secret State Police, or Gestapo) detachments, and controlled the 64th Reserve Police Battalion of the Ordnungspolizei (Order Police, or Orpo).

40|$|Thesis (Ph.

This analysis indicates how current <b>administrative</b> <b>staffing</b> levels are influenced by student enrollment, school size, student poverty, and district size. The interviews were the basis for grounding a theory to describe how human resources are allocated to schools and how principals invest those resources. The emergent Proactive-Reactive Relationship Resource Theory frames how principals invest in relationships to both mitigate the magnitude of emergent managerial work and create resources through relationship capital to support school administrative work demands.

This situation, together with the increasing cost of the retirement plans and the delay in its payments, were the causes of the financial and institutional crisis of 1998, which ended in the closure of the university in the second semester of 1998 and the suspension of payment to all the academic and <b>administrative</b> <b>staff</b> members.|$|E

Afterwards, he would have tea with his secretaries before going {{back down into the}} bunker complex for the night. After several weeks of this routine, Hitler seldom left the bunker except for short strolls in the chancellery garden with his dog Blondi. The bunker was crowded and the atmosphere was oppressive; air raids occurred daily. Hitler mostly stayed on the lower level, where it was quieter and he could sleep. Conferences took place for much of the night, often until 05:00.|$|E
