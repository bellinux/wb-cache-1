Schneider Electric (2014) performed and evaluated this operator training with 30 operation scenarios (15 scenarios each for CROPs and FOPs, respectively) via the EYESIM® immersive training package in a virtual reality simulation of the plant. Even though the above two strands of research try to develop FOP customized training solutions by integration of <b>accident</b> <b>simulation</b> or process simulation with immersive virtual reality systems, respectively, they are not able to train the whole process of accident initiated from process upsets and terminated at emergency response as they do not link the process simulation to <b>accident</b> <b>simulation</b> directly.

Nazir et al. (2015) evaluated and validated the training efficacy by applying this model to FOPs directly.

The time at which hot material arrives in a coolant-filled lower vessel head, thereby significantly increasing the steam flow rate through the core region, becomes significant to the progression and timing of a severe accident.

Based on two-dimensional spherical coordinates, heat conduction equation for transient state is solved implicitly. Together with solid vessel thickness, heat flux distribution and heat transfer coefficient at outer vessel surface are obtained. Heat transfer regime when critical heat flux has been exceeded (POST-CHF regime) could be simulated in the code, and the transition behavior of boiling crisis (from spatial and temporal points of view) can be predicted. The module is verified against a one-dimensional analytical solution with uniform heat flux distribution, and afterwards this module {{is applied to the}} benchmark illustrated in NUREG/CR- 6849. Benchmark calculation indicates that maximum heat flux at outer surface of RPV could be around 20 % lower than that of at inner surface due to two-dimensional heat conduction. Then a preliminary analysis is performed on the integrity of the reactor vessel for which the geometric parameters and boundary conditions are derived from a large scale advanced pressurized water reactor. Results indicate that heat flux remains lower than critical heat flux. Sensitivity analysis indicates that outer heat flux distribution is more sensitive to input heat flux distribution and the transition boiling correlation than mass flow rate in external reactor vessel cooling (ERVC) channel, and the correlation for molten vessel and ERVC coolant inlet temperature. According to the results achieved, the new developed module shows good applicability to simulate the pressure vessel behavior during melt pool formation. Thus it can be applied for the future study of the severe accidents relating to lower head integrity...|$|E

40|$|A {{steam line}} break {{accident}} {{is one of}} the possible severe abnormal transients in a pressurized water reactor. It is required to present an analysis of a steam line break accident in the Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR) of a nuclear power reactor. Only simple one-dimensional core simulations are currently applied to such accident analysis. However, the asymmetric characteristics of a steam break accident may require more detailed local information {{in order to determine the}} potential fuel damage resulting from the transient. TITAN, a coupled (neutronics and thermal-hydraulics) code with state-of-the-art neutronics and thermal-hydraulics models, is therefore modified and applied to steam line break <b>accident</b> <b>simulations.</b> The capabilities that are added to the code for a steam line break analysis include multiregion core inlet temperature forcing function, total inlet coolant flow rate boundary condition, total inlet coolant flow rate transient simulation capability, boron tracking equations, flow/coolant temperature transient plus control rod transient option, and one-dimensional, fully implicit numerical scheme. for thermal-hydraulics calculations. The modifications to TITAN are tested with a ten-channel PWR model. For inlet coolant temperature transients (one of the transients involved in a steam line break accident) test calculations lead to the conclusion that there is no significant difference between the results of closed- and open-channel calculations until boiling occurs. A ten-channel model with two partially inserted control rods is employed for the transient simulations. Steady state conditions are obtained first by both open- and closed-channel calculations. Results show that cross flow between channels is insignificant. Thus, the onedimensional, fully implicit numerical scheme for the thermal-hydraulics equations is useful to speed up the calculations. More than half of the computational effort is saved by using this scheme compared to the semi-implicit numerical scheme. Two extreme situations relevant to a steam line break accident are investigated: (1) Significant boiling due to severe depressurization when no return to power exists. (2) Return to power with no boiling because of high coolant temperature feedback coefficients. It is concluded that even after boiling occurs, the global parameters, such as total power and assembly power, still show no significant difference between the closed- and open-channel calcualtions. However, the local parameters, such as nodal power, void fraction and MDNBR, reveal differences between the two calculations. Results show that the open-channel calculation predicts lower MDNBR values as compared with the results of closed-channel calculation in a vapor generation process, since the coolant is driven away from of the hot spots. On the other hand, during a vapor condensation process, closed-channel calculations predict lower MDNBR results, since no cross flow is allowed to accelerated the condensation process. A closed-channel, uniform inlet coolant temperature transient calculation is performed. The results verify the necessity for a three-dimensional calculation of the <b>accident</b> <b>simulations,</b> since no boiling was predicted by-the one-dimensional calculation throughout the simulation period...|$|R
