The method works well with the American cockroach, but less so with the German cockroach.|$|E
5|$|Then {{suddenly}} he falteredâ€”and the disturbing truth became obvious. He wasn't reading his address at all. He had learned it by heart. To refresh his memory {{he brought the}} paper {{closer and closer to}} his eyes. When it was only <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> away he still couldn't read it, and had to fish for a magnifying glass in his pocket to make the typing visible to him. It was an agonizing moment.|$|E

60|$|By {{the time}} Tolly {{had come to}} this {{conclusion}} his horse and pony had obtained both rest and nourishment enough to enable them to raise their drooping heads and tails <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> <b>or</b> two, <b>so</b> that when the boy mounted the former with some of his old dash and energy, it shook its head, gave a short snort, and went off at a fair trot.|$|R
5000|$|Berets are {{not usually}} lined, but many are {{partially}} lined with silk or satin. In military berets, the headband is worn on the outside; military berets often have external sweatbands of leather, pleather or ribbon. The traditional beret (also worn by selected military units, such as the Belgian Chasseurs Ardennais or the French Chasseurs Alpins), usually has the [...] "sweatband" [...] folded inwardly. In such a case, these berets have only <b>an</b> additional <b>inch</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> of the same woollen material designed to be folded inwardly.|$|R

2500|$|A {{counter-example}} is {{the common}} technique for recording an automobile. [...] For recording [...] "Onboard" [...] car sounds (which include the car interiors), a three-microphone technique is common. [...] Two microphones record the engine directly: one is taped to {{the underside of the}} hood, near the engine block. [...] The second microphone is covered in a wind screen and tightly attached to the rear bumper, within <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> of the tail pipe. [...] The third microphone, which is often a stereo microphone, is stationed inside the car to get the car interior.|$|E

60|$|The lapse of {{time had}} {{asserted}} itself upon {{his upper lip}} in an inaggressive but indisputable moustache, in <b>an</b> added <b>inch</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> of stature, and in his less conscious carriage. For he no longer felt that universal attention he believed in at eighteen; {{it was beginning to}} dawn on him indeed that quite a number of people were entirely indifferent to the fact of his existence. But if less conscious, his carriage was decidedly more confident--as of one with whom the world goes well.|$|R

60|$|The {{words came}} clear to his ear, and just outside {{he could hear}} two men pacing {{backwards}} and forwards upon the deck.

60|$|She walked buoyantly {{along by}} my side, as tall within <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> as myself, {{and with a}} certain elegance in her gait {{a little hard to}} {{reconcile}} with her years. All the while she looked eagerly about her, her eyes shining with curiosity.|$|E

It's plain facts, Laddy, an' bein' across the U.S. line <b>a</b> few <b>inches</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> don't make no hell of a difference.

60|$|Mechanically {{stirring}} the wet plaster {{round and round}} for the second casting, the priest looked into the glass, and saw, as in a picture, all that was going forward in the inner room. Maddalena Lomi was standing behind the young nobleman, watching the progress he made with his bust. Occasionally she took the modeling tool out of his hand, and showed him, with her sweetest smile, that she, too, as a sculptor's daughter, understood something of the sculptor's art; and now and then, in the pauses of the conversation, when her interest was especially intense in Fabio's work, she suffered her hand to drop absently on his shoulder, <b>or</b> stooped forward <b>so</b> close to him that her hair mingled for a moment with his. Moving the glass <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> <b>or</b> two, <b>so</b> as to bring Nanina well under his eye, Father Rocco found that he could trace each repetition of these little acts of familiarity by the immediate effect which they produced on the girl's face and manner. Whenever Maddalena so much as touched the young nobleman--no matter whether she did <b>so</b> by premeditation, <b>or</b> really by accident--Nanina's features contracted, her pale cheeks grew paler, she fidgeted on her chair, and her fingers nervously twisted and untwisted the loose ends of the ribbon fastened round her waist.|$|R
60|$|This is {{manifest}} by the 5th, 9th, 12th, and 15th Observations. For {{by those}} Observations it appears, that {{one and the}} same sort of Rays at equal Angles of Incidence on any thin transparent Plate, is alternately reflected and transmitted for many Successions accordingly as the thickness of the Plate increases in arithmetical Progression of the Numbers, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, &c. so that if the first Reflexion (that which makes the first or innermost of the Rings of Colours there described) be made at the thickness 1, the Rays shall be transmitted at the thicknesses 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, &c. and thereby make the central Spot and Rings of Light, which appear by transmission, and be reflected at the thickness 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, &c. and thereby make the Rings which appear by Reflexion. And this alternate Reflexion and Transmission, as I gather by the 24th Observation, continues for above an hundred vicissitudes, and by the Observations in the next part of this Book, for many thousands, being propagated from one Surface of a Glass Plate to the other, though the thickness of the Plate be a quarter of <b>an</b> <b>Inch</b> <b>or</b> above: <b>So</b> that this alternation seems to be propagated from every refracting Surface to all distances without end or limitation.|$|R
6000|$|The {{first two}} were evidently elderly men {{who failed to}} come {{anywhere}} near the mark. Their failure was received with shouts of derision. They sank exhausted {{to the ground and}} from the motion of his body Alan could see that one of them was weeping, while the other remained sullenly silent. Then a younger man advanced and at the third try almost grasped the fetish. Indeed he would have grasped it had he not met with foul play, for the Asika, seeing {{that he was about to}} succeed, lifted it <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> <b>or</b> two, <b>so</b> that he also missed and with a groan joined the band of the defeated. Next appeared a fourth priest, even more horribly arrayed than those before him, but Alan noticed that his mask was of the lightest, and that his garments consisted chiefly of paint, the main idea of his make-up being that of a skeleton. He was a thin active fellow, and all the watching thousands greeted him with a shout. For a few seconds he stood back gazing at the mask as a wolf might at an unapproachable bone. Then suddenly he ran forward and sprang into the air. Such an amazing jump Alan had never seen before. So high was it indeed that his head came level with that of the fetish, which he snatched with both hands tearing it from Asika's grasp. Coming to the ground again with a thud, he began to caper to and fro, kissing the mask, while the audience shouted: ...|$|R
6000|$|Kemp {{stared at}} the bandage as it moved across the room, then saw a basket chair dragged across the floor and come to rest near the bed. It creaked, and the seat was {{depressed}} the quarter of <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> <b>or</b> <b>so.</b> He rubbed his eyes and felt his neck again. [...] "This beats ghosts," [...] he said, and laughed stupidly.|$|E
60|$|The makings were neatly {{laid out}} on a side-table, and to pour into a glass <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> of the raw spirit and shoosh some soda-water {{on top of it}} was with me the work of a moment. This done, I retired to an arm-chair and put my feet up, sipping the mixture with {{carefree}} enjoyment, rather like Caesar having one in his tent the day he overcame the Nervii.|$|E

6000|$|Besides these line engravings, and {{to protect}} you from what harm there is in their influence, you are to provide yourself, if possible, with a Rembrandt etching, or a {{photograph}} of one (of figures, not landscape). It does not matter of what subject, or whether a sketchy or finished one, but the sketchy ones are generally cheapest, and will teach you most. Copy it as well as you can, noticing especially that Rembrandt's most rapid lines have steady purpose; and that they are laid with almost inconceivable precision when the object becomes at all interesting. The [...] "Prodigal Son," [...] "Death of the Virgin," [...] "Abraham and Isaac," [...] and such others, containing incident and character rather than chiaroscuro, will be the most instructive. You can buy one; copy it well; then exchange it, at little loss, for another; and so, gradually, obtain a good knowledge of his system. Whenever you have an opportunity of examining his work at museums, &c., do so with the greatest care, not looking at many things, but a long time at each. You must also provide yourself, if possible, with an engraving of Albert Durer's. This you {{will not be able to}} copy; but you must keep it beside you, and refer to it as a standard of precision in line. If you can get one with a wing in it, it will be best. The crest with the cock, that with the skull and satyr, and the [...] "Melancholy," [...] are the best you could have, but any will do. Perfection in chiaroscuro drawing lies between these two masters, Rembrandt and Durer. Rembrandt is often too loose and vague; and Durer has little or no effect of mist or uncertainty. If you can see anywhere a drawing by Leonardo, you will find it balanced between the two characters; but there are no engravings which present this perfection, and your style will be best formed, therefore, by alternate study of Rembrandt and Durer. Lean rather to Durer; it is better for amateurs to err on the side of precision than on that of vagueness: and though, as I have just said, you cannot copy a Durer, yet try every now and then a quarter of <b>an</b> <b>inch</b> square <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> and see how much nearer you can come; you cannot possibly try to draw the leafly crown of the [...] "Melancholia" [...] too often.|$|R

60|$|About {{this time}} the wind began to rise, and came in {{irregular}} gusts.

60|$|Five blocks {{down the}} main street was the gold-recorder's office. The street was packed as for the {{witnessing}} of a parade. Not so easily this time did Smoke gain to his giant rival, {{and when he did}} he was unable to pass. Side by side they ran along the narrow aisle between the solid walls of fur-clad, cheering men.

And before even the nearest of the bystanders could realise what had happened Brott lay across the pavement a dead man, and Hedley was calmly handing over the revolver to a policeman who had sprang across the street.|$|E
