5|$|Shortly {{after the}} band's formation, Pluto Records offered As I Lay Dying a {{recording}} contract and, after accepting the offer, the band entered the studio {{one month later}} to record their first album Beneath the Encasing of Ashes, released in June 2001. The band then recorded five songs for a split album, <b>again</b> <b>through</b> Pluto Records, with San Diego post-hardcore band American Tragedy.|$|E

She has come to believe Mulder's assertion that Boggs arranged everything. Mulder asks her why she refused the chance to hear from her father <b>again</b> <b>through</b> Boggs. She tells him {{that she did not}} need to hear anything, because she already knew what her father would have said.|$|E
5|$|Crisp {{was hired}} by his former head coach Charles A. Bernier, who had {{resigned}} from VPI to become the head basketball coach and athletic director at Alabama, in February 1921. His first position on the Crimson Tide football staff was as line coach under Xen C. Scott for the 1921 team. The next season, he was the {{head coach of the}} freshman team, and in 1923 he was retained by new head coach Wallace Wade as the line coach once <b>again</b> <b>through</b> the end of his tenure at Alabama in 1930. During the Wade era, Crisp was an assistant coach for the 1925, 1926 and 1930 squads that each captured a share of the national championship.|$|E

5|$|Just before half time, a try by Newport's Jack Wetter was {{disallowed}} for {{a forward}} pass. The ball was then worked back to Fred Birt, standing within range {{in front of}} the posts, and he kicked a drop-goal, putting the home side 4–0 ahead at the break. In the second half, the Springboks repeatedly attacked but the Newport defence kept them from crossing the line, although a break from Dick Luyt, the South African centre, left Douglas Morkel to score under the posts. Luyt failed to convert and Newport remained a point ahead. Newport scored <b>again</b> <b>through</b> a cross-kick from Wetter, which Birt jumped on over the line for a try, which he then converted.|$|E
5|$|Porto {{were unable}} to hold onto their lead for long; two minutes after the restart, Celtic {{equalised}} when Henrik Larsson met Didier Agathe's cross to send a looping header in over Porto's goalkeeper Vítor Baía to get his tenth goal of the tournament and his 200th Celtic goal. However, within five minutes, it was 2–1 to Porto when Deco's through ball found Dmitri Alenichev, who scored with a low shot. Just three minutes later, Celtic equalised once <b>again</b> <b>through</b> Henrik Larsson when he headed in Alan Thompson's corner. After this, the game stagnated {{until a couple of}} minutes {{from the end of the}} game when Jackie McNamara's errant pass found Alenichev, who shot over the crossbar.|$|E
5|$|State Opening of Parliament {{takes place}} {{annually}} at the Houses of Parliament. The heralds, including both ordinary and extraordinary officers, form the front {{part of the}} Royal Procession, preceding the Sovereign and other Great Officers of State. The procession starts {{at the bottom of}} the Victoria Tower, then up the Norman Porch to the Robing Chamber. Once the Sovereign has put on the Imperial State Crown, the heralds lead the monarch once <b>again</b> <b>through</b> the Royal Gallery into the House of Lords, where they remain with him or her during his or her speech and accompany the monarch until he or she leaves the Palace.|$|E

5|$|When {{the city}} {{government}} announced its budget in late June 2014 for the upcoming fiscal year beginning July 1, the ferry only received a $2 million further appropriation, enough to temporarily extend it <b>again</b> <b>through</b> October. The administration of Mayor Bill de Blasio stated {{that there was not}} enough ridership to justify the cost of operation. Despite last-minute efforts by local transportation advocates, civic leaders, and elected officials, ferry service ended on October 31, 2014. They promised to continue efforts to have the service restored. This led to many negotiations between the mayor's office and the parties interested in reopening the ferry. The mayor's office eventually agreed to restart the Rockaway ferry when the NYC Ferry system opened.|$|E
5|$|In 1801 in the Mediterranean, {{under the}} command of Admiral Lord Keith, Kent carried Sir Ralph Abercromby and his {{headquarters}} for the invasion of Egypt, a successful campaign which forced the surrender of the French occupying force. Hope was not present for the conclusion of the action, returning to Britain with Admiral Duncan after Sir Richard Bickerton raised his flag on Kent. He was awarded the Order of the Crescent by Emperor Selim III for this service. In 1800, Hope began his second career, gaining the seat of Dumfries Burghs in the House of Commons through family influence. During his time as MP, Hope rarely visited his constituency and equally rarely appeared in parliament. He lost the constituency to his brother in 1802, but in 1804 was elected to the seat of Dumfriesshire, <b>again</b> <b>through</b> family connections. He retained this post until his retirement from public life in 1830.|$|E

5|$|In both games, {{there are}} many {{circumstances}} when a previous item can be upgraded into a more useful form. The latter three dungeons in both games will hold a more powerful version of an item received earlier in the game. Both the sword's offensive power and the shield's defensive abilities can be upgraded twice, once through passwords and <b>again</b> <b>through</b> side quests. If Link swings an enhanced sword at full health, a sword-shaped beam will escape from the sword as a ranged attack. The number of bombs and Mystical Seeds that can be held can also be increased through the same ways as the shield and sword. Roc's Feather and the Power Bracelet are special cases, as, while the two are in both games, the former can only be upgraded in Oracle of Seasons while the latter only in Oracle of Ages.|$|E
5|$|Neil Rubenking of PC Magazine {{successfully}} {{installed the}} beta version on 12 malware-infected systems and commented on its small installation package (about 7 MB, {{depending on the}} operating system) and speedy installation. But the initial virus definition update took between 5 and 15 minutes, and the full installation occupied about 110 MB of disk space. Rubenking noted that the beta version sets Windows Update into fully automatic mode, although it can be turned off <b>again</b> <b>through</b> Windows Control Panel. Some full scans took {{more than an hour}} on infected systems; a scan on a clean system took 35 minutes. An on-demand scan test Rubenking conducted in June 2009 with the beta version found 89 percent of all malware samples: 30 percent of the commercial keyloggers, 67 percent of rootkits, but only half of the scareware samples. The product's real-time protection found 83 percent of all malware and blocked the majority of it: 40 percent of the commercial keyloggers and 78 percent of the rootkits were found.|$|E
5|$|Now {{returning}} to its pre-Kensington route, NY33 follows a six-lane, divided Genesee Street past the airport {{on one side}} and numerous associated businesses such as hotels and fast food restaurants on the other. The large aerospace contractor Calspan has its headquarters here, and Westinghouse once operated a large industrial lathe plant on the airport side of the road (it was torn down when the airport was rebuilt in the late 1990s). Beyond the airport, the divider ends, the travel lanes are reduced to four and, after a short curve and minimal descent, NY33 intersects Transit Road (NY78) and enters the town of Lancaster. After this junction, the highway becomes a two-lane route once <b>again</b> <b>through</b> the small hamlet of Bowmansville, where it crosses Ellicott Creek near some rapids.|$|E

5|$|On July 15, 1835, {{tensions}} and emotions finally overflowed and blood was spilled. Monroe County, Michigan, Deputy Sheriff Joseph Wood went into Toledo to arrest Major Benjamin Stickney, but when Stickney {{and his three}} sons resisted, the whole family was subdued and taken into custody. During the scuffle, Two Stickney, son of the major, stabbed Wood with a pen knife and fled south into Ohio. Wood's injuries were not life-threatening. When Lucas refused Mason's demand to extradite Two Stickney back to Michigan for trial, Mason wrote to President Jackson for help, suggesting that the matter be referred to the United States Supreme Court. At {{the time of the}} conflict it was not established that the Supreme Court could resolve state boundary disputes, and Jackson declined the offer. Looking for peace, Lucas began making his own efforts to end the conflict, <b>again</b> <b>through</b> federal intervention via Ohio's congressional delegation.|$|E
5|$|SR 125 {{begins as}} the South Bay Expressway toll road at an {{interchange}} with SR 11 and SR 905, although the southbound roadway ends {{just to the}} north at Otay Mesa Road, the former alignment of SR 905. The route heads north through an undeveloped area, encountering its first toll plaza just before entering the city of Chula Vista. The freeway cuts through the Eastlake neighborhood of Chula Vista before leaving the city and turning to the northeast, passing through Sweetwater Summit Regional Park near Sweetwater Reservoir. SR 125 intersects with SR 54, where the tolled portion ends. SR 54 runs concurrently with SR 125 north to the Jamacha Road exit. SR 125 continues north <b>again</b> <b>through</b> the unincorporated area of La Presa. The freeway briefly enters Lemon Grove before intersecting with SR 94 and crossing into the city of La Mesa.|$|E
5|$|The custom {{was first}} {{recorded}} in 1800, with subsequent accounts {{of it being}} produced into the early twentieth century. According to these, the Mari Lwyd was a tradition performed at Christmas time by groups of men. They would form into teams to accompany the horse on its travels around the local area, and although the makeup of such groups varied, they typically included an individual to carry the horse, a leader, and individuals dressed as stock characters such as Punch and Judy. The team would carry the Mari Lwyd to local houses, where they would request entry {{through the medium of}} song. The householders would be expected to deny them entry, <b>again</b> <b>through</b> song, and the two sides would continue their responses to one another in this manner. If the householders eventually relented, then the team would be permitted entry and given food and drink.|$|E

5|$|The highway was {{originally}} designated as Route 202 in 1933. By 1934, a road headed due south from Seeley, before turning east through Calexico and curving {{slightly to the}} north and then east <b>again</b> <b>through</b> Bonds Corners. The easternmost portion of the highway was unpaved. By 1938, the road from Coyote Wells east to the then-current routing had been constructed, but was a county road; the entirety of Route 98, which was signed, was either gravel or asphalt. Between 1952 and 1954, the western portion of SR 98 was rerouted onto the county road, moving the western terminus to southwest of Coyote Wells; however, the new portion was not paved. By 1956, the entire highway was paved. In the 1964 state highway renumbering, the highway was officially renumbered as Route 98. I-8 was extended to the western terminus of SR 98 by 1965, and to the eastern terminus of SR 98 by 1970.|$|E

Class continues without her, and a little while later Arianna, if the player rejected her earlier in the game, makes another attempt to have a relationship with Rook. The player may choose to accept or reject her <b>again.</b> <b>Through</b> Amie, Rook learns that both Charlotte and Kendall wish to resume their relationship, and can influence Charlotte to try again or not, which changes whether or not they get back together.

5|$|The tunnel {{runs through}} {{an area with}} complex and varied geology. It runs through two rock complexes, the Halsnøy Basement Rock on the Sveio side, and Hardangerfjord Cover Complex on the Stord side. Both were created during the {{creation}} of the Caledonian orogeny 500 million years ago. The Halsnøy Basement Rock consists of Precambrian rock with elements of gneiss of both sedimentary and magmatic origin. They range between granite gneiss to mylonite. In the area between the two complexes, there is some amount of gabbro. At the lowest point, the tunnel runs through a section of phyllite, which continues to be the dominant species until the tunnel reaches Otterøya. Below the island the tunnel reaches a section of greenstone, before it rises <b>again</b> <b>through</b> more phyllite.|$|E
