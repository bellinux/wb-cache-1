5|$|The White House's {{most famous}} alleged {{apparition}} {{is that of}} Abraham Lincoln. Eleanor Roosevelt never admitted to having seen Lincoln's ghost, but did say that she felt his presence repeatedly throughout the White House. Mrs. Roosevelt {{also said that the}} family dog, Fala, would sometimes bark for no reason at what she felt was Lincoln's ghost. President Dwight Eisenhower's press secretary, James Hagerty, and Liz Carpenter, press secretary to First Lady Lady Bird Johnson, both said they felt Lincoln's presence many times. The former president's footsteps are also said to be heard in the hall outside the Lincoln Bedroom. As reputable an eyewitness as Lillian Rogers Parks admitted in her autobiography My Thirty Years Backstairs at the White House that she had heard them. Margaret Truman, daughter of President Harry S. Truman, said she heard a specter rapping {{at the door of the}} Lincoln Bedroom when she stayed there, and believed it was Lincoln. President Truman himself was once wakened by raps at the door while spending a night in the Lincoln Bedroom. Others have actually seen an apparition of the former president. The first person reported to have actually seen Lincoln's spirit was First Lady Grace Coolidge, who said she saw the ghost of Lincoln standing at a window in the Yellow Oval Room staring out at the Potomac. Winston Churchill, Theodore Roosevelt, and Maureen Reagan and her husband have all claimed to have seen a spectral Lincoln in the White House. A number of staff members of the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration claimed to have seen Lincoln's spirit, and on one occasion Roosevelt's personal valet ran screaming from the White House claiming he had seen Lincoln's ghost. Perhaps the most famous incident was in 1942 when Queen Wilhelmina of The Netherlands heard footsteps outside her White House bedroom and answered <b>a</b> <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> only to see Lincoln in frock coat and top hat standing in front of her (she promptly fainted). Several unnamed eyewitnesses have claimed to have seen the shade of Abraham Lincoln actually lying down on the bed in the Lincoln Bedroom (which was used as a meeting room at the time of his administration), and others have seen Lincoln sit on the edge of the bed and put his boots on. The most famous eyewitness to the latter was Mary Eben, Eleanor Roosevelt's secretary, who saw Lincoln pulling on his boots (after which she ran screaming from the room).|$|E
500|$|At 7:00 am on {{the morning}} of June 21, 1957, Fisher {{answered}} <b>a</b> <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to his room, Room 839. Upon opening the door, he was confronted by FBI agents who addressed him as [...] "colonel" [...] and stated that they had [...] "information concerning [...] involvement in espionage." [...] Fisher knew that the FBI's use of his rank could have only come from Häyhänen. Fisher said nothing to the FBI and, after spending twenty-three minutes staring at Fisher, the FBI agents called in the waiting Immigration and Naturalization Service officers who arrested Fisher and detained him under section 242 of the Immigration and Nationality Act.|$|E

One story had Don Bradman {{answering}} <b>a</b> <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> late one night to see Miller dressed in a dinner suit. Miller advised Bradman that, as demanded, he was in bed at curfew and was now going out. His relationship with Bradman was one riddled with friction and mutual antipathy, [...] "...one a roundhead of massive influence, the other a cavalier and maverick". As Bradman moved from batting hero and team captain to selector and administrator, his influence grew; this [...] "...almost certainly cost Miller any chance of captaining his country".|$|E

[...] He said {{that they wanted to}} restore the old order, and for this purpose, [...] "the enemies of the people" [...] had linked up with the forces of reaction internationally. As a result, several hundred thousand honest people perished. Everyone lived in fear in those days. Everyone expected that at any moment there would be <b>a</b> <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> {{in the middle of the}} night and that knock on the door would prove fatal... eople not to Stalin's liking were annihilated, honest party members, irreproachable people, loyal and hard workers for our cause who had gone through the school of revolutionary struggle under Lenin's leadership. This was utter and complete arbitrariness. And now is all this to be forgiven and forgotten? Never! ...|$|E
50|$|The West Leeds High School {{opened on}} 7 September 1907 to improve {{standards}} in the city.

In a post-coital moment, Andrea declares to Don that he will continue meeting her for trysts because he can't change who he is. Don flies off the handle and chokes her to death.

500|$|Richard Bradley, {{editor-in-chief}} of Worth magazine, {{was the first}} mainstream journalist to question the Rolling Stone article, in a blog entry written on November 24, 2014. The entry began drawing national media attention {{in the days after}} paleoconservative pundit Steve Sailer made an entry on his own blog at the Unz Review on November 29 in which he discussed and linked to Bradley's piece. After an interview Erdely gave to Slate, in which she was questioned about the way she investigated the piece, some commentators escalated their questioning of the veracity of the article. It was later revealed Erdely had not interviewed any of the men accused of the rape. Erdely defended her decision not to interview the accused by saying that the contact page on the fraternity's website [...] "was pretty outdated". Washington Post media critic Erik Wemple rejected Erdely's statement, saying that the severity of the accusations she was reporting required [...] "every possible step to reach out and interview them, including e-mails, phone calls, certified letters, FedEx letters, UPS letters and, if all of that fails, <b>a</b> <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> No effort short of all that qualifies as journalism." ...|$|E

2500|$|The animal used {{to portray}} Nigger was an RAF dog, on loan to the production. [...] Richard Todd was the animal wrangler, and later {{recalled}} {{that the dog}} was an exemplary actor who hardly ever required a re-take. On two occasions, however, the dog caused difficulty. On the first occasion, the dog could not be persuaded to wait when filming the scene when Nigger answers <b>a</b> <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> in Gibson's bedroom. [...] The second occasion was when filming on location at RAF Scampton, where Nigger and Gibson were to stroll through a group of RAF men waiting outside of a building for a briefing. [...] The dog could not be persuaded to move off one spot, or even dragged past it on a leash. [...] It later transpired that the spot was {{the site where the}} real Nigger had been buried, some 8 years before, whose gravestone had been temporarily removed for filming.

5000|$|A {{reputation}} of Clifton Hall as haunted by ghosts stretches back {{to at least}} the {{time when it was}} used as a school. Anwar Rashid, a businessman with a £25 million fortune and a portfolio of 26 properties, bought Clifton Hall in January 2007. The 52-room Hall cost £3.6M and included 17 bedrooms, a gym, a cinema, 10 reception rooms and 10 bathrooms. Rashid made his fortune from a chain of nursing homes and a hotel in Dubai. Thirty-two-year-old Rashid and his family, consisting of his 25-year-old wife, three daughters, and a son, moved into the hall the same month they bought it. From the first day in the house they allegedly experienced paranormal activity, leading them to believe that Clifton Hall was haunted. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> first evening they spent in the house, there was reportedly <b>a</b> <b>knocking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wall and <b>a</b> voice saying [...] "is anyone there?", however they did not find anyone making the noises. Rashid said [...] "The day we moved in we had our first experience. We sat down in the evening to relax and there was <b>a</b> <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wall. We heard this, 'Hello, is anyone there'? We ignored it the first time but two minutes later we heard the man's voice again. I got up to have a look but the doors were locked and the windows were closed." [...] On another occasion Nabila, Anwar Rashid's wife, thought she saw her eldest daughter watching television downstairs at 5 am, however when she checked in her daughter's room, Nabila discovered her daughter was still in bed. Eventually, the family's friends refused to go round to the house.|$|R

50|$|Böcklin himself {{provided}} no public {{explanation as to}} the meaning of the painting, though he did describe it as “a dream picture: it must produce such a stillness that one would be awed by <b>a</b> <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> door.” The title, which was conferred upon it by the art dealer Fritz Gurlitt in 1883, was not specified by Böcklin, though it does derive from a phrase in an 1880 letter he sent to the painting’s original commissioner. Not knowing the history of the early versions of the painting (see below), many observers have interpreted the oarsman as representing the boatman Charon who ferried souls to the underworld in Greek mythology. The water would then be either the River Styx or the River Acheron and his white-clad passenger a recently deceased soul transiting to the afterlife.|$|R
