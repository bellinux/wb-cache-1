This results in an ideal 'thumbtack' <b>auto-ambiguity</b> <b>function,</b> making the arrays useful in applications such as sonar and radar. Costas arrays can {{be regarded}} as two-dimensional cousins of the one-dimensional Golomb ruler construction, and, as well as being of mathematical interest, have similar applications in experimental design and phased array radar engineering.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{ambiguity}} {{functions of}} a kind of direct chaotic radar system are investigated. In this radar system, a microwave chaotic Colpitts oscillator is employed to generate the source signal that is directly transmitted through a wideband antenna without modulation. The <b>auto-ambiguity</b> <b>function</b> of this radar system shows many sidelobes which makes the unambiguous detection difficult. It is because the spectrum of the chaotic signal is not very flat and smooth, with pulsation peaks in it. The cross-ambiguity functions of the direct radar system have also been investigated to evaluate the electronic counter countermeasure (ECCM) performance and the “multi-user” characteristic. It is shown that rather excellent ECCM capability can be achieved in this radar system with transmitting chaotic signals generated by circuits with same parameters but at different time or with slightly different circuit parameters. In addition, several possible methods to reshape the spectrum of the chaotic signal from microwave Colpitts oscillators to improve the unambiguous detection performance are suggested {{at the end of this}} paper. 2 Shi et al. 1...|$|E
40|$|RADAR 2014, International Radar Conference, Lille, France, 13 -/ 10 / 2014 - 17 / 10 / 2014 Costas {{codes are}} {{a variant of}} {{frequency}} hopping codes that achieve the «thumbtack» <b>auto-ambiguity</b> <b>function</b> needed in radar applications. However, they may show poor cross- ambiguity properties when selected and assigned randomly which makes them poorly adapted to multiuser radar applications. In this paper, we propose a multiuser adaptation of phase coded Costas signals. In fact, this modified version of Costas signals consists in replacing Costas constant frequency sub-pulses with phase codes. This modification allows to suppress autocorrelation function grating lobes that appears when orthogonality condition of Costas codes is not satisfied. Furthermore, the later design adds a degree of freedom for a possible adaptation of these waveforms to a multiuser context. Indeed, in the current work, the sub- pulse phase codes are used to generate a set of waveforms with good cross-correlation properties. Specific conditions on these codes are stated {{in order to achieve}} the needed cross-correlation properties, using a same Costas code. The auto-ambiguity and cross-ambiguity properties are also remarkable but within a bounded Doppler region. Furthermore, the families are expanded using different Costas codes with particular properties. Hence, since the phase codes and Costas codes diversity are used, the number of synthesized waveforms is improved...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} the local {{optimization}} of the periodic or aperiodic ambiguity functions {{of a set of}} complex sequences by using a gradient method. This optimization aims to locally minimize the cross-ambiguity and the <b>auto-ambiguity</b> <b>functions</b> of a family of sequences for Multi-Static Primary Surveillance Radar (MSPSR) systems. The optimization of the ambiguity functions is done by an optimized gradient. An extension is also presented for controlling both the spectrum and the ambiguity functions...|$|R
40|$|The {{motivation}} {{of having a}} joint radar and communication system on a single hardware is driven by space, military, and commercial applications. However, designing sequences that can simultaneously support radar and communication functionalities {{is one of the}} major hurdles in the practical implementation of these systems. In order to facilitate a simultaneous use of sequences for both radar and communication systems, a flexible sequence design is needed. The objective of this dissertation is to address the sequence design problem for integrated radar and communication systems. The sequence design for these systems requires a trade-off between different performance measures, such as correlation characteristics, integrated sidelobe ratio, peak-to-sidelobe ratio and ambiguity function. The problem of finding a trade-off between various performance measures is solved by employing meta-heuristic algorithms. This dissertation is divided into an introduction and three research parts based on peer-reviewed publications. The introduction provides background on binary and polyphase sequences, their use in radar and communication systems, sequence design requirements for integrated radar and communication systems, and application of meta-heuristic optimization algorithms to find optimal sets of sequences for these systems. In Part I-A, the performance of conventional polyphase pulse compression sequences is compared with Oppermann sequences. In Part I-B, weighted pulse trains with the elements of Oppermann sequences serving as complex-valued weights are utilized for the design of integrated radar and communication systems. In Part I-C, an analytical expression for the cross-ambiguity function of weighted pulse trains with Oppermann sequences is derived. Several properties of the related <b>auto-ambiguity</b> and cross-ambiguity <b>functions</b> are derived in Part I-D. In Part II, the potential of meta-heuristic algorithms for finding optimal parameter values of Oppermann sequences for radar, communications, and integrated radar and communication systems is studied. In Part III-A, a meta-heuristic algorithm mimicking the breeding behavior of Cuckoos is used to locate more than one solution for multimodal problems. Further, the performance of this algorithm is evaluated in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). It is shown that the Cuckoo search algorithm can successfully locate multiple solutions in both non-noise and AWGN with relatively high degree of accuracy. In Part III-B, the cross-ambiguity function synthesization problem is addressed. A meta-heuristic algorithm based on echolocation of bats is used to design a pair of sequences to minimize the integrated square error between the desired cross-ambiguity function and a synthesized cross-ambiguity function...|$|R
