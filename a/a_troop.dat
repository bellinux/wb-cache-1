5|$|In United States {{railroad}} terminology, <b>a</b> <b>troop</b> sleeper was {{a railroad}} passenger car {{which had been}} constructed to serve {{as something of a}} mobile barracks (essentially, a sleeping car) for transporting troops over distances sufficient to require overnight accommodations.

5|$|A {{number of}} design faults of the Tetrarch were {{revealed}} through its operational use. Its size limited the possible crew to three, a {{driver in the}} hull and a gunner and commander in the turret, resulting in too few crew members to operate the Tetrarch effectively. The gunner or commander, {{in addition to his}} own duties, had to act as loader for the 2 pounder, which caused delays in combat. A report on the tank written in January 1941 stated that as the commander had to both fight and control the tank, controlling <b>a</b> <b>troop</b> of Tetrarchs during combat would be almost impossible.|$|E
5|$|Assiniboine {{returned}} to Canada in June and was briefly used as <b>a</b> <b>troop</b> transport before a boiler room fire on 4 July effectively ended her career.

5|$|Conversion {{planning}} {{began in}} May 1942, {{and had the}} conversion been finished, {{she would have been}} the largest German aircraft carrier, longer even than the purpose-built s. The work was canceled in November 1942, however, after design problems, including serious instability and structural weaknesses, proved to be irreconcilable. No work was done on the ship, which was eventually seized by the US Army and used as <b>a</b> <b>troop</b> transport following the end of the war.|$|E
