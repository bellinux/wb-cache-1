Her brother Henry later said that [...] "Jane was fond of dancing, and excelled in it".|$|E

500|$|Religion {{played an}} {{important}} part in workhouse life: prayers were read to the paupers before breakfast and <b>after</b> <b>supper</b> each day. Each Poor Law Union was required to appoint a chaplain to look after the spiritual needs of the workhouse inmates, and he was invariably expected to be from the established Church of England. Religious services were generally held in the dining hall, as few early workhouses had a separate chapel. But {{in some parts of the}} country, notably Cornwall and northern England, there were more dissenters than members of the established church; as section 19 of the 1834 Poor Law specifically forbade any regulation forcing an inmate to attend church services [...] "in a Mode contrary to [...] Religious Principles", the commissioners were reluctantly forced to allow non-Anglicans to leave the workhouse on Sundays to attend services elsewhere, so long as they were able to provide a certificate of attendance signed by the officiating minister on their return.|$|E

2500|$|The Jesuits marshaled their neophytes to {{the sound}} of music, and in {{procession}} to the fields, with a saint borne high aloft, the community each day at sunrise took its way. Along the way at stated intervals were shrines of saints where they prayed, and sang hymns between shrines. As the procession advanced it became gradually smaller as groups of Indians dropped off to work the various fields and finally the priest and acolyte with the musicians returned alone. At noon each group assembled for the Angelus, after which came dinner and a siesta; work was then resumed until evening. <b>After</b> <b>supper</b> came the rosary and sleep. On rainy days they worked indoors. Frequent festivals with sham battles, fireworks, concerts, and dances enlivened the community.|$|E
2500|$|Our {{meal that}} night was on a more luxurious scale than {{anything}} that we had tasted for some time.

We also scraped up enough rum for a small tot all round. This we drank <b>after</b> <b>supper,</b> lying on a little sandbank and watching the sun sinking behind the dunes. [...] I cannot remember a meal that I enjoyed more or that seemed more wildly and agreeably extravagant. Extravagant it certainly was, for, when we had finished eating, there was no food left at all, and only enough water to half fill one water-bottle for each man.|$|E

In the next box was the King, who from accounts {{was more interested in}} flirting with Nell than watching the play. Charles invited Nell and her escort (a Mr. Villiers, a cousin of Buckingham's) to supper, along with his brother the Duke of York. The anecdote turns charming if perhaps apocryphal at this point: the King, <b>after</b> <b>supper,</b> discovered that he had no money on him; nor did his brother, and Gwyn had to foot the bill. [...] "Od's fish!" [...] she exclaimed, in an imitation of the King's manner of speaking, [...] "but this is the poorest company I ever was in!" ...|$|E
