DragonFly BSD is <b>a</b> <b>fork</b> from FreeBSD 4.8 aiming for a different multiprocessor synchronization strategy than the one chosen for FreeBSD 5 and development of some microkernel features. It does not aim to stay compatible with FreeBSD and has huge differences in the kernel and basic userland.

5|$|DragonFly BSD is a {{free and}} open source Unix-like {{operating}} system created as <b>a</b> <b>fork</b> of FreeBSD 4.8. Matthew Dillon, an Amiga developer in the late 1980s and early 1990s and a FreeBSD developer between 1994 and 2003, began work on DragonFly BSD in June 2003 and announced it on the FreeBSD mailing lists on 16 July 2003.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{experimentally}} examines how an electron vortex beam with {{orbital angular momentum}} (OAM) undergoes diffraction through <b>a</b> <b>forked</b> grating. The nth-order diffracted electron vortex beam after passing through <b>a</b> <b>forked</b> grating with <b>a</b> Burgers vector of 1 shows an OAM transfer of nh. Hence, the diffraction patterns become mirror asymmetric owing to the size difference between the electron beams. Such <b>a</b> <b>forked</b> grating, when used in combination with a pinhole located at the diffraction plane, could act as an analyzer to measure the OAM of input electrons.

2500|$|The phrase [...] "speaking with <b>a</b> <b>forked</b> tongue" [...] {{means to}} {{deliberately}} {{say one thing}} and mean another or, to be hypocritical, or act in a duplicitous manner. In the longstanding tradition of many Native American tribes, [...] "speaking with <b>a</b> <b>forked</b> tongue" [...] has meant lying, and a person was no longer considered worthy of trust, once he had been shown to [...] "speak with <b>a</b> <b>forked</b> tongue". This phrase was also adopted by Americans {{around the time of}} the Revolution, and may be found in abundant references from the early 19th centuryâ€“ often reporting on American officers who sought to convince the tribal leaders with whom they negotiated that they [...] "spoke with a straight and not with <b>a</b> <b>forked</b> tongue" [...] (as for example, President Andrew Jackson told the Creek Nation in 1829). According to one 1859 account, the native proverb that the [...] "white man spoke with <b>a</b> <b>forked</b> tongue" [...] originated as a result of the French tactic of the 1690s, in their war with the Iroquois, of inviting their enemies to attend a Peace Conference, only to be slaughtered or captured.|$|R
5|$|After leaving Rogers County, {{the next}} county along US-412 is Mayes County. South of Chouteau, the route {{provides}} access to US-69 via an interchange. Just west of US-412's crossing of the Grand River, the highway intersects SH-412B, which connects US-412 to SH-69A. After crossing the river, US-412 comes to <b>a</b> <b>fork</b> in the road; {{one half of the}} fork is the Cherokee Turnpike, which mainline US-412 follows, while the other is US-412 Alternate, which runs parallel to the turnpike on an old alignment of US-412.|$|E
5|$|Bree and her husband, Orson (Kyle MacLachlan), find it {{increasingly}} difficult to stage her fake pregnancy. Their hoax is almost revealed at a neighborhood barbecue when <b>a</b> <b>fork</b> stabs her pregnancy stomach pads. Orson suggests coming clean to avoid the humiliation if their lies were to be discovered, but Bree tells him that this child is her second chance at successfully raising a child. Meanwhile, Susan worries that Mike is dissatisfied with their marriage, especially after Adam, her new gynecologist, reveals that she may be entering menopause. However, Adam later informs Susan that his earlier assessment was a mistake and that she is pregnant.|$|E
5|$|In {{people with}} AD, the {{increasing}} impairment {{of learning and}} memory eventually leads to a definitive diagnosis. In a small percentage, difficulties with language, executive functions, perception (agnosia), or execution of movements (apraxia) are more prominent than memory problems. AD does not affect all memory capacities equally. Older memories of the person's life (episodic memory), facts learned (semantic memory), and implicit memory (the memory of the body {{on how to do}} things, such as using <b>a</b> <b>fork</b> to eat or how to drink from a glass) are affected to a lesser degree than new facts or memories.|$|E

5|$|Lincolnshire {{lies in a}} {{floodplain}} region, {{a consequence}} of the presence of the Des Plaines River and the proximity <b>a</b> <b>fork</b> of the Chicago River on the far east border. A third factor involves small Indian Creek, which runs north of Lincolnshire. The village participates in the National Flood Insurance Program, a Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) project, to alleviate a portion of the costs of flood damage that may overtax affected village residents. The village also implements the Community Rating System, a disaster readiness plan.|$|E
5|$|NY185 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY9N and NY22 in Crown Point. The route progresses eastward as a two-lane highway named Bridge Road. Heading {{away from the}} western terminus, there is <b>a</b> <b>fork</b> in the road: to the left is NY185, {{and to the right}} is a road to a housing development. Most of NY185 runs along the lowlands around Lake Champlain, making curves at intersections, and heading on relatively flat elevations. As the highway approaches the lake, it makes a curve to the north. There, it intersects with County Route48 (Lake Road) and begins to follow the lake shore.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>forked</b> {{fingering}} is <b>a</b> fingering {{in which}} an open hole has covered holes below it: fingerings for which the uncovering of the holes is not sequential. For example, the fingering 0123 is not <b>a</b> <b>forked</b> fingering, while 0123 56 is <b>a</b> <b>forked</b> fingering because the open hole 4 has holes covered below it - holes 5 and 6. Forked fingerings allow for smaller adjustments in pitch than the sequential uncovering of holes alone would allow. For example, at the same air speed the fingering 0123 5 sounds higher than 01234 but lower than 0123. Many standard recorder fingerings are forked fingerings. Forked fingerings may {{also be used to}} produced microtonal variations in pitch.|$|R
5|$|The highway {{follows the}} {{railroad}} tracks into Beekmantown until it bears left at <b>a</b> <b>fork,</b> trending further west to Beekmantown Corners, where another short local road, County Route 58, formerly NY456, comes to its western end. After crossing into the next town, Chazy, NY22 bears left again at another fork to drift further to the west. The terrain around the road becomes increasingly wooded, with long unbroken stretches of pine, in the northern portion of the town. This is briefly broken at another western terminus of a short local road, County Route 23, formerly NY191, in the hamlet of Sciota.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} Roseville Avenue station {{dates back}} to the opening of the Morris & Essex Railroad Station in 1856, when tracks were constructed through the Roseville district of Newark. These tracks went along Sixth and Seventh Avenues, while the original station served the Montclair Branch at <b>a</b> <b>fork</b> along Seventh Avenue and the Morris & Essex main line along Sixth Avenue. The station was designed with two platforms, one along each line, the Morris & Essex first made use of the Montclair Branch property in April 1868 after buying the Newark and Bloomfield Railroad.|$|E
5|$|The route {{initially}} heads {{east from}} Watkins Glen to skirt {{the southern edge}} of the lake, but turns north upon exiting the village and passing the southeastern tip of the waterbody. Just outside Watkins Glen, NY414 comes to <b>a</b> <b>fork.</b> The left fork carries NY414 {{to the foot of the}} valley, bringing it very close to Seneca Lake. The right fork holds NY79, which travels up the side of the valley toward the village of Burdett. NY414 continues to parallel Seneca Lake, but gradually ascends the side of the lake valley as it heads north through the town of Hector and enters Seneca County.|$|E

5|$|A {{few other}} {{lines have been}} tried, with the outcome varying from an {{immediate}} equality to a clear advantage for Black. The cooling 4.e6 avoids complications and heads for an equal endgame with 4...dxe6 5.Qxd8+ Kxd8, Black's loss {{of the right to}} castle being of no great importance since queens have been traded. If Black wants to avoid this early endgame, he can try 4...Bb4+ 5.Nc3 Bxc3+ 6.bxc3 dxe6 and now the exchange of queens would give a plus to Black, as the white queenside pawns are isolated and doubled. The greedy 4.f4 is weak because White neglects his development and weakens the a7â€“g1 diagonal. Black can immediately exploit this with 4...Bc5, which threatens <b>a</b> <b>fork</b> on f2 and forbids White's castling; Black may later push d7â€“d6 to open the centre, e.g. 5.Nh3 0-0 6.Nc3 d6 7.exd6 cxd6 when Black has good squares for its pieces while White's castling is delayed.|$|E
5|$|CR106 {{originated}} in 1824, when {{the road was}} chartered for the New Turnpike and headed from Monroe to Haverstraw. Back in the 1820s, what is now Southfields was known as Monroe. The New Turnpike started at a nail factory in Monroe to a crossing over the Ramapo River, and progressed eastward, passing Lake Stahahe (then known as Car Pond). The turnpike continued eastward, meeting the Old Turnpike at <b>a</b> <b>fork</b> in the road. At the fork, part of the road became NY210 in the 1930 New York State Route renumbering. In 1910, when the park opened, the road {{became known as the}} Southfields Road. Three years later, it became part of the Seven Lakes Drive. Three more years later, the route became known as County Highway416. In 1919 and 1920, the western section of the road was reconstructed. After a bridge was built to cross a river in 1923, a new route, making up part of the original Warwick Turnpike, became NY17A.|$|E
5|$|Crash Boom Bang!s stages {{resemble}} board games, as each {{play area}} is split {{into a number}} of squares. The game takes place among four players, with the computer assigned to spare players. All players simultaneously roll dice. The number each player rolls is the amount of squares they move forward. Depending on the type of square that the player lands on, Wumpa Fruit (which is used as points during the race) can be won or lost, an item can be obtained, a special event might be triggered, or a mini-game might commence. If a player lands on <b>a</b> <b>fork</b> in the road, the player will have to select the desired direction with either the stylus or the control pad.|$|E

5|$|In September 2015 at Wageningen University in the Netherlands, {{students}} and entrepreneurs presented a fully automatic, prototype vending machine that cooks frozen potato strips by deep frying them. The final product is served with mayonnaise, ketchup or curry. The process takes around two minutes {{from start to}} finish, in which the product is served in a paper cup. The potato strips are stored in a frozen state inside the machine at âˆ’18Â°C, and it cooks them in oil at 180Â°C. The unit uses a specially-designed dispenser to prevent the potatoes from being crushed or broken. As of September 2015, only the single prototype is available, which is housed at Wageningen University. Orders are placed using a touchscreen, and <b>a</b> <b>fork</b> and salt are provided separately in a box.|$|E
5|$|Marco Pesenti Gritti, the {{initiator}} of Galeon, {{originally developed}} Epiphany in 2002 as <b>a</b> <b>fork</b> of Galeon. The fork occurred {{because of the}} divergent aims of Gritti {{and the rest of}} Galeon development team about new features. While Gritti regarded Galeon's monolithic design and the number of user-configurable features as factors limiting Galeon's maintainability and user base expansion, the rest of the Galeon developers wanted to see more features added. At the same time the GNOME project created the GNOME human interface guidelines, which promoted simplification of user interfaces. As Galeon was oriented towards power users, most developers saw the implementation of those guidelines as unacceptable. As a result, Gritti created a new browser based on Galeon's codebase, with most of the non-mission-critical features removed. He intended Epiphany to comply fully with the GNOME human interface guidelines, with a very simple user-interface. As such, Epiphany does not have its own theme settings and uses GNOME's settings, which are specified in the GNOME Control Center.|$|E
