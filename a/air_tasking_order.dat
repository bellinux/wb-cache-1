Awareness of the severe consequence of errors in detection {{and the risk of}} physical harm may contribute to operator stress and anxiety. Operators high in trait anxiety might then be vulnerable to adverse consequences including excessive stress, workload and performance impairment. In addition, anxiety research shows a selective attention bias to threat-related information which may impact operator strategy. The current study aimed to investigate the effects of trait and state anxiety in dyads performing a simulated ABM task. In general, dyads high in trait anxiety appeared to cope fairly effectively with task demands, and performed better on defensive aspects of the ABM task.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} in unlimited. On day five of combat operations during Operation IRAQI FREEDOM, advances by coalition forces were nearly halted by a dust storm, {{initiated by the}} passage of a synoptically driven cold front. This storm impacted ground and air operations across the entire Area of Responsibility, and delayed an impending ground attack on the Iraqi capital. Military meteorologists were able to assist military planners in mitigating {{at least some of the}} effects of this storm. This thesis examines the synoptic conditions leading to the severe dust storm, evaluates the numerical weather prediction model performance in predicting the event, and reviews metrics pertaining to the overall impacts on the Operation IRAQI FREEDOM combined air campaign. In general, the numerical model guidance correctly predicted the location and onset of the dust storms on 25 March, 2003. As a result of this forecast guidance, mission planners were able to front load <b>Air</b> <b>Tasking</b> <b>Orders</b> with extra sorties prior to the onset of the dust storm, and were able to make changes to planned weapons loads, favoring GPS-guided munitions.

40|$|Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) sensing {{platforms}} {{are becoming}} increasingly complex. Consequently, the fidelity of collected data is continuing to increase, along {{with the number of}} deployable sensors that retrieve these data, such as those found on Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPAs). There are numerous, critical challenges when designing ISR systems because the technology and the human are tightly integrated, resulting in interdependent performance and behaviors. Predicting operator error can inform more effective means of managing erroneous decisions, but current methods of doing so are impractical because of the effort required to construct operator models. We explored human performance in a target detection task by conducting a human-in-the-loop experiment that examined the performance of operators who simultaneously monitored four simulated RPA video feeds and determined the presence of targets at points of interest (POIs). The results of this experiment confirm that performance varies significantly across certain flight conditions (e. g., combinations of altitude, speed, aspect angle). A statistical model was constructed from the human data to predict operator error in new situations. In future work, the model predictions will be integrated with an automated flight planner that will adjust RPA <b>air</b> <b>tasking</b> <b>orders</b> in real time and intelligently revisit POIs when human error is likely...|$|R
5000|$|The {{participation}} of the F-14 in the 1991 Operation Desert Storm consisted of Combat Air Patrol (CAP) over the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf and overland missions consisting of strike escort and reconnaissance. Until {{the waning days of}} Desert Storm, in-country <b>air</b> superiority was <b>tasked</b> to USAF F-15 Eagles due to the way the <b>Air</b> <b>Tasking</b> <b>Orders</b> (ATO) delegated primary overland CAP stations to the F-15 Eagle. The governing Rules of Engagement (ROE) also dictated a strict Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) requirement when employing Beyond Visual Range weapons such as the AIM-7 Sparrow and particularly the AIM-54 Phoenix. This hampered the Tomcat from using its most powerful weapon. Furthermore, the powerful emissions from the AWG-9 radar are detectable at great range with a radar warning receiver. Iraqi fighters routinely retreated as soon as the Tomcats [...] "lit them up" [...] with the AWG-9. The U.S. Navy suffered its only F-14 loss from enemy action on 21 January 1991 when BuNo 161430, an F-14A upgraded to an F-14A+, from VF-103 was shot down by an SA-2 surface-to-air missile while on an escort mission near Al Asad airbase in Iraq. Both crews survived ejection with the pilot being rescued by USAF Special Operation Forces and the RIO being captured by Iraqi troops as a POW {{until the end of the}} war. The F-14 also achieved its final kill in US service, a Mi-8 [...] "Hip" [...] helicopter, with an AIM-9 Sidewinder.|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, we {{introduce}} {{and analyze}} models for air asset scheduling within a military theater. Specifically, {{we seek to}} create models that generate aircraft-specific schedules for <b>Air</b> <b>Tasking</b> <b>Orders</b> (ATOs) within a Joint Aerospace Operations Center (JAOC). A JAOC provides command and control of all air and space assets tasked to a particular region/area of responsibility (AOR) or strategic command. Scheduling these assets requires {{a high level of}} unified effort whereby centralized planning must be handled in a decentralized fashion and is known as the <b>Air</b> <b>Tasking</b> Cycle. Given the complexity of this process, subject matter experts from diverse backgrounds are required to design and plan missions for most operations. In addition, the difficulty of the process dictates that mission prioritization and aircraft/munitions allocation are separated in the cycle, sacrificing some global perspective for the sake of efficiency in the scheduling process. We present a modeling framework that allows planners to simultaneously select missions and assign aircraft/munitions to the missions, allowing for the optimal air asset scheduling toward the pursuit of theater-level objectives. This flexible framework takes into account air refueling considerations as well as the need for certain missions to be completed by "packages" of particular aircraft types. We submit heuristic, mixed integer optimization (MIO), and hybrid models within this structure and analyze the value of their schedules and the corresponding trade-offs with computational solve time. 0 by Kevin Joseph Rossillon.

Once an air support request is received, the air support request is either approved or disapproved by the ground commander's land component chain of command.
