The system can automatically generate a set of life-like portraits in different styles from a frontal face image. The system includes three subsystems, each of which models hair, face and collar respectively. The face subsystem can be further decomposed into face components: eyebrows, eyes, nose, mouth, and face contour. Each component {{has a number of}} distinct sub-templates as a leaf-node in the <b>And-Or</b> <b>graph</b> for portrait. The <b>And-Or</b> <b>graph</b> for portrait is like a ”mother template ” which produces a large set of valid portrait configurations, which is a ”composite templates ” made of a set of sub-templates. Our approach has three novel aspects:(1) we present an <b>And-Or</b> <b>graph</b> for portrait that explains the hierarchical structure and variability of portrait and apply it into practice; (2) we combine hair, face and collar into a system that solves a practical problem; (3) The system can simultaneously generate a set of impressive portraits in different styles.

40|$|For face modeling, an <b>And-Or</b> <b>graph</b> {{model was}} first {{proposed}} in [9] as a compositional representation for high resolution face images. In an <b>And-Or</b> <b>graph,</b> the And nodes represent coarse-to-fine decompositions and the Or-nodes represent alternative components for diversity. The <b>And-Or</b> <b>graph</b> face model, as Fig. 1 illustrates, has three levels: {{the first level}} describes the general appearance of global face and hair; the second level refines {{the representation of the}} facial components (eyes, eye brows, nose, mouth) by modeling the variations of their shapes and subtle appearance; and the third level provides further details of the face components and divides the face skin into 9 zones where the wrinkles and speckles are represented.

40|$|SUMMARY Modern {{digital systems}} design {{requires}} us to explore a large and complex design space to find a best configuration which satis-fies design requirements. Such exploration requires a sound representation of design space from which design candidates are efficiently generated, each of which then is evaluated. This paper proposes a plan-generation-evaluation framework which supports a complete process of such design space exploration. The plan phase constitutes a design space of all possible design alternatives {{by means of a}} formally defined representation scheme of attributed <b>AND-OR</b> <b>graph.</b> The generation phase generates a set of can-didates by algorithmic pruning of the design space in an attributed <b>AND-OR</b> <b>graph</b> with respect to design requirements as well as architectural con-straints. Finally, the evaluation phase measures performance of design can-didates in a pruned graph to select a best one. A complete process of cache design is exemplified to show the effectiveness of the proposed framework. key words: design space exploration, plan-generation-evaluation frame-work, graph pruning, attributed <b>AND-OR</b> <b>graph</b> 1...|$|E

40|$|In the {{development}} of high-assurance systems, formal modeling, analysis and verification techniques are play-ing an increasingly important role. In spite of signifi-cant advances, formal modeling and verification still suffers from limited applicability due to exponential runtime space growth exibited by model checkers. In this paper, we describe an alternative to model check-ing. We describe an algorithm that automatically trans-lates Finite State Machine models used by model checkers into <b>AND-OR</b> <b>graphs.</b> State space verification of <b>AND-OR</b> <b>graphs</b> does not suffer from state space explosion, but its exhaustive search is an NP complete problem. Hence, we demonstrate that random searches of <b>AND-OR</b> <b>graphs</b> are a vaible alternative to model checking, suitable for system debugging and fast analysis during system development. We support our conclusions through the studies of two models, Dekker’s two process mutual exclusion algorithm and the Space Shuttle’s liquid hydrogen subsystem. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>And-or</b> <b>graphs</b> and theorem-proving graphs {{determine}} {{the same kind}} of search space and differ only in the direction of search: from axioms to goals, in the case of theorem-proving graphs, and in the opposite direction, from goals to axioms, in the case of <b>and-or</b> <b>graphs.</b> Bi-directional search strategies combine both directions of search. We investigate the construction of a single general algorithm which covers uni-directional search both for <b>and-or</b> <b>graphs</b> and for theorem-proving graphs, bi-directional search for path-finding problems and search for a simplest solution as well as search for any solution. We obtain a general theory of completeness which applies to search spaces with infinite or-branching. In the case of search for any solution, we argue against the application of strategies designed for finding simplest solutions, but argue for assigning a major role in guiding the search to the use of symbol complexity (the number of symbol occurrences in a derivation) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{probabilistic}} inference of current Probabilistic Logic Programming systems uses weighted model counting (WMC). To compute the success {{probability of a}} query, first the set of proofs of the query is computed. Next, the set of proofs is converted into a corresponding Boolean formula which is compiled into a suitable representation that allows WMC in polynomial time. The computational cost of each step depends on the size and {{the complexity of the}} output of the previous step. The set of proofs, computed in the first step, can become large. In this paper we propose a way {{to reduce the size of}} the collected proofs in order to improve the next steps. We use an <b>AND-OR</b> <b>graph</b> to represent the collected proofs.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} a numerical {{study of the}} bottom-up and top-down inference processes in hierarchical models using the <b>And-Or</b> <b>graph</b> as an example. Three infer-ence processes are identified for each node A in a recursively defined <b>And-Or</b> <b>graph</b> in which stochastic context sensitive image grammar is embedded: the α(A) process detects node A directly based on image features, the β(A) process com-putes node A by binding its child node(s) bottom-up and the γ (A) process predicts node A top-down from its par-ent node(s). All the three processes contribute to computing node A from images in complementary ways. The objective of our numerical study is to explore how much information each process contributes and how these processes should be integrated to improve performance. We study them in the task of object parsing using <b>And-Or</b> <b>graph</b> formulated un-der the Bayesian framework.

In the high-performance version of CSM, labels associated to edges are words (rather than letters) over the input alphabet. The throughput of a path p {{is defined as}} the sum of the lengths of the labels of the path, divided by the number of edges of p.

A discriminative learning algorithm, {{extended from the}} CCCP [23], is proposed to train the model in a dynamical manner: the model structure (e. g., {{the configuration of the}} leaf-nodes associated with the or-nodes) is automatically determined with optimizing the multi-layer parameters during the iteration.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{addresses}} a new problem, that of multiscale activity recognition. Our {{goal is to}} detect and localize {{a wide range of}} activities, including individual actions and group activities, which may simultaneously co-occur in highresolution video. The video resolution allows for digital zoom-in (or zoom-out) for examining fine details (or coarser scales), as needed for recognition. The key challenge is how to avoid running a multitude of detectors at all spatiotemporal scales, and yet arrive at a holistically consistent video interpretation. To this end, we use a three-layered <b>AND-OR</b> <b>graph</b> to jointly model group activities, individual actions, and participating objects. The <b>AND-OR</b> <b>graph</b> allows a principled formulation of efficient, cost-sensitive inference via an explore-exploit strategy. Our inference optimally schedules the following computational processes: 1) direct application of activity detectors – called α process; 2) bottom-up inference based on detecting activity parts – called β process; and 3) top-down inference based on detecting activity context – called γ process. The scheduling iteratively maximizes the log-posteriors of the resulting parse graphs. For evaluation, we have compiled and benchmarked a new dataset of high-resolution videos of group and individual activities co-occurring in a courtyard of the UCLA campus. ...|$|E

The grammar should achieve {{the following four}} objectives and thus servers as a unified framework of representation, learning, and recognition for {{a large number of}} object categories. (i) The grammar represents both the hierarchical decompositions from scenes, to objects, parts, primitives and pixels by terminal and non-terminal nodes and the contexts for spatial and functional relations by horizontal links between the nodes.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a novel Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) framework that can generate 3 D scenes by incorporating objects’ relevancy, hierarchical and contextual constraints in a unified model. This model is formulated by a Gibbs distribution, under the MaxEnt framework, {{that can be}} sampled to generate plausible scenes. Unlike existing approaches, which represent a given scene by a single <b>And-Or</b> <b>graph,</b> the relevancy constraint (defined as {{the frequency with which}} a given object exists in the training data) require our approach to sample from multiple And-Or graphs, allowing variability in terms of objects’ existence across synthesized scenes. Once an <b>And-Or</b> <b>graph</b> is sampled from the ensemble, the hierarchical constraints are employed to sample the Or-nodes (style variations) and the contextual constraints are subsequently used to enforce the corresponding relations that must be satisfied by the And-nodes. To illustrate the proposed methodology, we use desk scenes that are composed of objects whose existence, styles and arrangements (position and orientation) can vary from one scene to the next. The relevancy, hierarchical and contextual constraints are extracted from a set of training scenes and utilized to generate plausible synthetic scenes that in turn satisfy these constraints.

These sub-templates serve as leafnodes in a big <b>And-Or</b> <b>graph</b> where an And-node represents a decomposition of the graph into sub-configurations with Markov relations for context and constraints (soft or hard), and an Or-node is a switch for choosing one out of a set of alternative And-nodes (sub-configurations) – similar to a node in stochastic context free grammar (SCFG).

The compositional model represents faces in each age group by a hierarchical <b>And-Or</b> <b>graph,</b> in which And nodes decompose a face into parts to describe details (e. g., hair, wrinkles, etc.) crucial for age perception and Or nodes represent large diversity of faces by alternative selections. Then a face instance is a transverse of the And-Or graph—parse graph. Face aging is modeled as a Markov process on the parse graph representation. We learn {{the parameters of the}} dynamic model from a large annotated face data set and the stochasticity of face aging is modeled in the dynamics explicitly. Based on this model, we propose a face aging simulation and prediction algorithm. Inversely, an automatic age estimation algorithm is also developed under this representation. We study two criteria to evaluate the aging results using human perception experiments: 1) the accuracy of simulation: whether the aged faces are perceived of the intended age group, and 2) preservation of identity: whether the aged faces are perceived as the same person.

40|$|Graduation date: 2014 This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} problem of recognizing human activities in videos. Our focus is on activities with stochastic structure, where the activities are characterized by variable space-time arrangements of actions, and conducted by a variable number of actors. These activities occur frequently in sports and surveillance videos. They may appear jointly in multiple instances, at different spatial and temporal scales, under occlusion, and amidst background clutter. These challenges have never been addressed in the literature. Our hypothesis is that these challenges can be successfully addressed using expressive, hierarchical models explicitly encoding activity parts and their spatio-temporal relations. Our hypothesis is formalized using two novel paradigms. One specifies a new constrained hierarchical model of activities allowing efficient activity recognition. Specifically, we formulate Sum-Product Networks (SPNs) for modeling activities, and develop two new learning algorithms using variational learning. The other paradigm considers a more expressive (unconstrained) hierarchical model, <b>And-Or</b> <b>Graphs</b> (AOGs), requiring cost-efficient algorithms for activity recognition. In particular, we develop a new, Monte Carlo Tree Search based inference of AOGs. Our theoretical and empirical studies advance computer vision through demonstrated advantages of each paradigm, compared to the state-of-the-art...|$|R
