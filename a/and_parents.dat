40|$|Analyses {{assessed}} the degrees to which personality accounts for associations between marital quality <b>and</b> <b>parenting</b> <b>and</b> mediates genetic contributions to these relationships. Participants included 318 male and 544 female same-sex twin pairs from the Twin and Offspring Study in Sweden. All twins completed self-report measures of marital quality and personality (anxiousness, aggression, sociability). Composite measures of <b>parent</b> negativity <b>and</b> warmth {{were derived from}} the twins' and their adolescent children's ratings of the twins' disciplinary styles and the emotional tone of the parent-child relationship. Observational ratings of marital quality <b>and</b> <b>parenting</b> were also obtained for a subset of twins.

5|$|After the event, in {{response}} to Owen Hart's death, the WWF canceled the encore presentation of Over the Edge via pay-per-view, and they also canceled four live events in Canada and one in Illinois. Information about Over the Edge from the WWF (now named the WWE) is sparse because the event was never released on VHS or DVD due to Hart's death. In 2014, the event was shown in an edited form on the WWE Network. On May 24, 1999, the day following this event, a tribute to Hart was held on Raw is War in St. Louis, which the WWF called Raw is Owen. For this show, all storylines and rivalries were stopped, and wrestlers were given the option to wrestle or not. The show also featured interviews and testimonies from his coworkers and highlights of his professional wrestling career. Hart's funeral service was held on May 31, 1999, in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, and it was attended by family members, friends, and over 300 wrestlers who were acquainted with him. Following the funeral, Hart was buried in Calgary's Queens Park Cemetery later that day. Three weeks after the event, his widow, children, <b>and</b> <b>parents</b> sued the WWF for causing Owen's death with a poorly planned stunt; they claimed that the harness system was defective. After the court case had extended one-and-a-half years, a settlement was reached on November 2, 2000, when the WWF agreed to pay his widow, children, <b>and</b> <b>parents</b> US$18million. The manufacturer of the harness system had also been named as a defendant in the case but was dismissed from the case after the settlement was reached.|$|E

40|$|Adolescent {{pregnancy}} {{is often described}} as a major concern in public health and is associated with negative outcomes for educational and career attainment. Our objective was to compare the future aspirations of pregnant <b>and</b> <b>parenting</b> adolescents <b>and</b> identify social or structural barriers that they experience in their daily lives using journal entries from pregnant <b>and</b> <b>parenting</b> adolescents. The journals, which served as primary data sources, were completed by 52 multi-ethnic pregnant <b>and</b> <b>parenting</b> adolescents aged 15 to 19 in Indiana. Both pregnant <b>and</b> <b>parenting</b> adolescents aspired to provide a “better life” for their children that included finishing school and obtaining a career. An emergent theme is that the experience of pregnancy <b>and</b> <b>parenting</b> is transformative <b>and</b> may invoke a positive refocusing of life aspirations for educational and career attainment. However, social stigma and barriers exist that make achieving educational and employment opportunities difficult. The study findings indicate that pregnant <b>and</b> <b>parenting</b> adolescents need strong social support networks and practical tools to help harness their motivation and transcend social and material barriers to achieve their goals and aspirations...|$|R

40|$|MA (Psychology), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 Adolescent {{pregnancy}} {{has been}} a global phenomenon of great concern for a considerable time. Adolescent pregnancy <b>and</b> <b>parenting</b> can lead to negative consequences for both adolescents and their infants in health, psychological, developmental and educational spheres. In South Africa recent media reporting {{has pointed out that}} adolescent pregnancy at times culminates in infant abandonment. Adolescence is a difficult transition period and the added stress of pregnancy <b>and</b> <b>parenting</b> creates specific challenges. Adolescent parents’ conflicting roles as adolescents, striving for independence, <b>and</b> as <b>parents,</b> who have to care for their children in a selfless manner, have been shown to complicate their lives significantly. Research has indicated that adolescent pregnancy mostly occurs in resource-poor, black, rural, or semi-rural communities. Support for pregnant <b>and</b> <b>parenting</b> adolescents in such communities seems to be minimal, and research on experiences of adolescent pregnancy <b>and</b> <b>parenting</b> in the South African context is scant. Therefore the aim {{of this study was to}} explore late adolescents’ (18 - 22) experiences of their pregnancy <b>and</b> <b>parenting</b> during early adolescence (12 - 18). The research context was a resource-poor community, namely Sir Lowry’s Pass Village in the Helderberg basin in the Western Cape. The researcher wanted to shed light on the particular challenges and strengths of participants, to inform practice and make suggestions so as to promote support for such parents. From the findings of this study it became clear that participants found adolescent pregnancy <b>and</b> <b>parenting</b> to be a challenging experience. They made mention of various factors complicating their experience of pregnancy <b>and</b> <b>parenting,</b> such as their socio-economic circumstances; stigma experienced from the community, family, peers, and educational and health-related systems; loss and sacrifices; lack of support; and feelings of powerlessness. They felt overwhelmed by their parenting experiences as a result of lack of <b>parenting</b> skills, <b>and</b> the fact that their parental rights were often not respected. However, pregnancy <b>and</b> <b>parenting</b> were also viewed as positive and inspiring in that adolescent parents viewed their children as a source of comfort. Furthermore, they indicated that parenting was more manageable with support, <b>and</b> that becoming <b>parents</b> rendered them more responsible individuals. These findings concur with prior research on adolescent pregnancy <b>and</b> <b>parenting.</b> This study adds value to the field of adolescent pregnancy <b>and</b> <b>parenting</b> in that prior findings were corroborated, and that an adolescent father’s perspective was included. Research on adolescent fathers in the South African context is limited. This study provides a clearer understanding of pregnant <b>and</b> <b>parenting</b> adolescents’ needs <b>and</b> what they find supportive, which could assist health care professionals, welfare organisations, schools, and significant others in supporting them more adequately.

Using a community sample (n = 306) of children and their mothers assessed at three time points (children's ages 36, 54, and 63 months), observational measures of child temperament <b>and</b> <b>parenting</b> were obtained during laboratory tasks. Cross-lagged analyses were performed to examine whether temperament <b>and</b> <b>parenting</b> predict changes in one another, whether they each contribute independently to children's adjustment (total problems and social competence), and whether these transactional relations account for adjustment outcomes. There {{was no evidence of}} bidirectional relations between fear <b>and</b> <b>parenting.</b> Maternal negativity at 36 months predicted child frustration at 54 months. Maternal negativity and executive control predicted decreases in each other, whereas, scaffolding and executive control predicted increases in each other over time.
