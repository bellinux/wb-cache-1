5|$|Apart from Kong, Skull Island is {{inhabited}} by dinosaurs <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>large</b> fauna. Inspired by Dougal Dixon's works, the designers imagined what 65 million {{years or more}} of isolated evolution might have done to dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} speculated since the 1970s that Allosaurus preyed on sauropods <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>large</b> dinosaurs by hunting in groups.|$|E
5|$|Another myth {{surrounding}} this species {{is that it}} occasionally catches small monkeys <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>large</b> animals in its pitchers. Such tales have persisted {{for a very long}} time, but can probably be explained as rodents being mistaken for other species. It {{is interesting to note that}} one common name for Nepenthes plants is 'Monkey Cups'. The name refers to the fact that monkeys have been observed drinking rainwater from these plants.|$|E

5|$|Colletid bees of {{subgenus}} Cladocerapis {{within the}} genus Leioproctus exclusively forage on and pollinate flowers of {{many species of}} Persoonia. Bees of subgenus Filiglossa in the same genus also specialise in feeding on Persoonia flowers, but {{do not appear to}} be effective pollinators. The fruit are adapted to be eaten by vertebrates, such as kangaroos and possums, as well as currawongs <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>large</b> birds.|$|E
5|$|Dogs are not {{permitted}} on any trails in the park due {{to the presence of}} bears <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>large</b> mammals. Dogs are permitted at front country campsites that can be accessed by a vehicle and along paved roads.|$|E
5|$|Hyogo {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{industrial}} areas of Kobe. Fujitsu Ten is headquartered within the ward, <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>large</b> corporations including Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Mitsubishi Electric and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries have manufacturing facilities in Hyogo. In particular, railcars for the bullet train are manufactured in Hyogo by Kawasaki.|$|E

5|$|In the 19th and 20th centuries, organ {{builders}} {{began to}} build instruments in concert halls <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>large</b> secular venues, allowing the organ {{to be used as}} part of an orchestra, as in Saint-Saëns' Symphony No. 3. Frequently the organ is given a soloistic part, such as in Joseph Jongen's Symphonie Concertante for Organ & Orchestra, Francis Poulenc's Concerto for Organ, Strings and Tympani, and Frigyes Hidas' Organ Concerto.|$|E
5|$|Maritime trade {{along the}} coast of East Africa was {{facilitated}} by trade winds in the Indian Ocean, as well as relatively short distances between land masses. Gedi <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>large,</b> contemporary mainland sites often had poor anchorages compared to later sites {{along the coast}}, considering the exposure of their shorelines, availability of sheltered harbors, and water depth upon approach. However, despite reduced access to good anchorage, Gedi <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>large</b> mainland sites were able to maintain a high degree of economic success. Their success in trade may have been influenced by the early establishment of trade routes and available commercial support from their hinterlands.|$|E
5|$|Sharks <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>large</b> fishes, in {{particular}} the great hammerhead (Sphyrna mokarran), prey upon the roughtail stingray. The live sharksucker (Echeneis naucrates) is sometimes found attached to its body. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Acanthobothrium woodsholei, Anthocephalum centrurum, Lecanicephalum sp., Oncomegas wageneri, Polypocephalus sp., Pterobothrium senegalense, and Rhinebothrium maccallumi, the monogenean Dendromonocotyle centrourae, and the leech Branchellion torpedinis.|$|E
30|$|The ranges in lesion {{size and}} lesion {{components}} {{in these patients}} are quite wide, with some small lesions having only red components <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>larger</b> lesions being dominated by white areas.|$|R

25|$|As {{typical of}} K-selected species, the macaws <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>larger</b> parrot species have low {{reproductive}} rates. They require {{several years to}} reach maturity, produce one or very few young per year, {{and do not necessarily}} breed every year.|$|R
5|$|Since the Cambrian {{explosion}} {{there have}} been five distinctly identifiable mass extinctions. The last mass extinction occurred some 66 million years ago, when a meteorite collision probably triggered the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>large</b> reptiles, but spared small animals such as mammals. Over the past 66million years, mammalian life diversified.|$|E
5|$|Used for {{corporate}} catering <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>large</b> groups, Courtyard was originally known as King's Courtyard, {{until at least}} 1998. Public entry to the area is through a gate located between Wonderland Theatre and Riptide. Occasionally, other events are held at the Courtyard: in June 1998, the section hosted Alligators Alive!, an educational show about the Floridian animals.|$|E
5|$|At {{night just}} outside Paris, a woman drives along a {{riverbank}} and dumps a corpse in the river. After {{the body is}} recovered, Dr. Génessier identifies the remains as those of his missing daughter, Christiane Génessier, whose face was horribly disfigured {{in an automobile accident}} that occurred before her disappearance, for which her father was responsible. Dr. Génessier lives in a large mansion, which is adjacent to his clinic, with numerous caged German Shepherds <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>large</b> dogs.|$|E
50|$|The {{purpose of}} these muscles is to provide fine motor {{function}} in movements of the head. The actions of trapezius, sternocleidomastoid <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>larger</b> muscles that move the head are refined by the relatively small suboccipital triangle muscles.|$|R
5000|$|The {{village has}} a {{permanent}} population of around 605 (2011 census), however, {{in the summer}} months the numbers can soar past 1000 as expatriates return from abroad (e.g. Sweden, Germany, USA, Canada) and from Athens <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>larger</b> cities.|$|R
50|$|One {{of the key}} {{outcomes}} {{of the formation of}} Trades and Labour Councils <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>larger</b> union bodies was the establishment of trades halls, where unions <b>and</b> <b>others</b> involved in the labour movement could centrally gather for organizational activities, and to host educational and social events.|$|R
5|$|Because {{the kingdom}} was {{largely based on}} agriculture, the {{construction}} of irrigation works was a major achievement of the Anuradhapura Kingdom, ensuring water supply in the dry zone and helping the country grow mostly self-sufficient. Several kings, most notably Vasabha and Mahasena, built large reservoirs and canals, which created a vast and complex irrigation network in the Rajarata area throughout the Anuradhapura period. These constructions are {{an indication of the}} advanced technical and engineering skills used to create them. The famous paintings and structures at Sigiriya; the Ruwanwelisaya, Jetavana stupas, <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>large</b> stupas; large buildings like the Lovamahapaya; and religious works (like the numerous Buddha statues) are landmarks demonstrating the Anuradhapura period's advancement in sculpting.|$|E
5|$|Colletid bees of {{the genus}} Leioproctus {{subgenus}} Cladocerapis exclusively forage on and pollinate flowers of many species of Persoonia. Bees of subgenus Filiglossa in the same genus that also specialise in feeding on Persoonia flowers {{do not appear to}} be effective pollinators. Particular species recorded on P.levis include the longtongue bee Leioproctus carinatifrons. Weighing 1700mg (0.60oz), the fruit are adapted to be eaten by vertebrates, such as kangaroos and possums, as well as currawongs <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>large</b> birds. The flowers of P.levis are self-incompatible—that is, they are unable to fertilise themselves and require outcrossing to another plant.|$|E
5|$|Colletid bees of {{the genus}} Leioproctus, {{subgenus}} Cladocerapis exclusively forage on and pollinate flowers of many species of Persoonia. Bees of subgenus Filiglossa in the same genus, which also specialise in feeding on Persoonia flowers, {{do not appear to}} be effective pollinators. Weighing 1900mg (0.07oz), the fruit are adapted to be eaten by vertebrates, such as kangaroos, possums and currawongs <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>large</b> birds. Seeds have been recorded in the faeces of the brush-tailed rock-wallaby (Petrogale penicillata).|$|E
50|$|The gorge holds {{a variety}} of {{wildlife}} including abundant crocodiles, hippos, hyraxes, baboons, leopards <b>and</b> <b>other</b> small game. Elephants <b>and</b> buffalo <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>larger</b> game are common {{at both ends of}} the gorge, but have difficulty in accessing the central region due to the steep walls.|$|R

5|$|Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them premiered in New York City on 10 November 2016 and was {{released}} worldwide on 18 November 2016 in 3D, IMAX 4K Laser <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>large</b> format cinemas. It received largely positive reviews from critics and audiences, and grossed $814 million worldwide, making it the eighth highest-grossing film of 2016. The film was nominated for five BAFTAs, including Best British Film, winning Best Production Design, {{as well as two}} Academy Awards, winning Best Costume Design, becoming the first film in J. K. Rowling's Wizarding World to win an Academy Award.|$|E
5|$|In May and June 2015 cyclists {{were allowed}} to board the trams with their bikes, during a trial period which was {{supported}} by cycle campaign groups Spokes and Pedal on Parliament. Following this, Edinburgh trams became the first light rail network in the UK to permit the carriage of bikes on a permanent basis, with up to two bicycles being allowed per tram outwith peak hours (7.30am to 9.30am, and 4pm to 6.30pm) and excluding the festival period (7−31 August) <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>large</b> events.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to drive Allied forces from Guadalcanal and nearby islands and end the {{stalemate}} that had existed since September 1942, the Imperial Japanese Army planned a major ground offensive on Guadalcanal for 20–25 October 1942. In support of this offensive, and {{with the hope of}} engaging Allied naval forces, Japanese carriers <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>large</b> warships moved into a position near the southern Solomon Islands. From this location, the Japanese naval forces hoped to engage and decisively defeat any Allied (primarily U.S.) naval forces, especially carrier forces, that responded to the ground offensive. Allied naval forces also hoped to meet the Japanese naval forces in battle, with the same objectives of breaking the stalemate and decisively defeating their adversary.|$|E

50|$|Polypores <b>and</b> <b>other</b> {{decomposer}} fungi are {{the first}} step in food chains that feed on decomposed plant material. A rich fauna of insects, mites <b>and</b> <b>other</b> invertebrates feed on polypore mycelium and fruiting bodies, further providing food for birds <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>larger</b> animals. Woodpeckers <b>and</b> <b>other</b> hole nesting birds typically carve their nests in softer wood decomposed by polypores.|$|R
50|$|CLC {{contributed to}} the war effort in two world wars by {{manufacturing}} armaments and munitions, as did the competing shops of the Montreal Locomotive Works, the CPR, <b>and</b> <b>others.</b> <b>Large</b> numbers of locomotives were also built for the war effort and for reconstruction afterwards.|$|R
