5|$|Intentionality is the {{capacity}} of mental states to be directed towards (about) or be in relation with something in the external world. This property of mental states entails that they have contents and semantic referents and can therefore be assigned truth values. When one tries to reduce these states to natural processes there arises a problem: natural processes are not true or false, they simply happen. It would not make <b>any</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> say that a natural process is true or false. But mental ideas or judgments are true or false, so how then can mental states (ideas or judgments) be natural processes? The possibility of assigning semantic value to ideas must mean that such ideas are about facts. Thus, for example, the idea that Herodotus was a historian refers to Herodotus and {{to the fact that}} he was a historian. If the fact is true, then the idea is true; otherwise, it is false. But where does this relation come from? In the brain, there are only electrochemical processes and these seem not to have anything to do with Herodotus.|$|E

In 2003 he was one of 22 Nobel Laureates who signed the Humanist Manifesto.|$|E
25|$|Wittgenstein argues, in {{his later}} work, that this account of private {{language}} is inconsistent. If {{the idea of a}} private language is inconsistent, then a logical conclusion would be that all language serves a social function. This would have profound implications for other areas of philosophical and psychological study. For example, if one cannot have a private language, it might not make <b>any</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> talk of private experiences or of private mental states.|$|E

500|$|Sony Pictures Imageworks {{designed}} the visual effects sequences. Burton felt 3D was {{appropriate to the}} story's environment. Burton and Zanuck chose to film with conventional cameras, and convert the footage into 3D during post-production; Zanuck explained 3D cameras were too expensive and [...] "clumsy" [...] to use, and they {{felt that there was}} no difference between converted footage and those shot in the format. James Cameron, who released his 3D film Avatar in December 2009, criticized the choice, stating, [...] "It doesn't make <b>any</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> shoot in 2-D and convert to 3-D".|$|E
500|$|Michael Nader {{was fired}} from All My Children in July 1999, due to budget considerations, and Dimitri was killed off. This led to a fan outcry from viewers who campaigned for the actor's return. To {{partially}} appease them, the show's executive producer, Jean Dadario Burke, offered Nader his job back on a recurring basis. He rejected this offer because [...] "after being a major character for so long, it didn't make <b>any</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> me. So I declined.

500|$|Science {{fiction writers}} had {{a range of}} {{reactions}} to the film. Ray Bradbury praised the film's photography, but disliked the banality {{of most of the}} dialogue, and believed that the audience does not care when Poole dies. Both he and Lester del Rey were put off by the film's feeling of sterility and blandness in all the human encounters amidst all the technological wonders, while both praised the pictorial element of the film. Del Rey was especially harsh, describing the film as dull, confusing, and boring, predicting [...] "t will probably be a box-office disaster, too, and thus set major science-fiction movie making back another ten years." [...] However, the film was praised by science-fiction novelist Samuel R. Delany who was impressed by how the film undercuts the audience's normal sense of space and orientation in several ways. Like Bradbury, Delany picked up on the banality of the dialogue (in Delany's phrasing the characters are saying nothing meaningful), but Delany regards this as a dramatic strength, a prelude to the rebirth {{at the conclusion of the}} film. Without analyzing the film in detail, Isaac Asimov spoke well of Space Odyssey in his autobiography, and other essays. The film won the Hugo Award for best dramatic presentation, an award heavily voted on by science fiction fans and published science-fiction writers. James P. Hogan liked the film but complained about the ending that didn't make <b>any</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> him, leading to a bet about whether he could write something better or not; [...] "I stole Arthur's plot idea shamelessly and produced Inherit the Stars." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although the Gaekwads {{trace their}} origins to 1720, {{it was not}} until {{considerably}} later that Baroda can be truly thought of as an independent state. The first coins issued by the Gaekwads were issued by Manaji Rao (ruled 1789-93) and they followed the Maratha pattern of naming the Mughal emperor Shah Alam II, distinguishing themselves only by the placement of an extra mark or letter to indicate the issuer. Manaji, for example, placed a Nagari letter ma on his coins. After 1857, since the Mughal emperor had been formally deposed, it no longer made <b>any</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> issue coins in his name, so the designs were changed and coins were issued in the name of [...] "the Commander of the Sovereign Band," [...] a title of the Gaekwad. The legends on these coins were still in Persian and the coins themselves were still hand-struck. Finally, in stages during the 1870s, Nagari legends and different designs were introduced and also milled coins began to be issued, eventually featuring the portrait of the Gaekwad on them.|$|E

[...] In 2009, Cartoon Network ordered more episodes of The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack as well as greenlit Quintel's project, Regular Show. The agreement upon the premise of Regular Show was that the series would be about two park groundskeepers, Mordecai (a 6-foot blue jay) and Rigby (a hyperactive raccoon), who try to entertain themselves at their jobs while doing anything they can to avoid work and escape their everyday boredom. Along with his success at getting approval to develop Regular Show, in December 2009, Quintel and director John Infantino were nominated for an ASIFA-Hollywood Annie Award {{in the category of}} [...] "Directing in a Television Production" [...] for their directing work on the [...] episode in Season 2 of The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack. However, American animation director and fellow CalArts graduate Bret Haaland subsequently took the director Annie Award in February 2010 for Haaland's work on The Penguins of Madagascar – Launchtime. Nine months after Quintel was nominated for an Annie Award, Regular Show debuted in New York at 8:15 P.M. EST on September 6, 2010. In September 2011, while the first season of Regular Show was being aired, Quintel was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award in the Outstanding Short-format Animated Program category as executive producer and creator of Regular Show.
