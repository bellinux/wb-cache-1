5000|$|Emitters were sets of 12 exit hubs that {{automatically}} generated a pulse at each specified {{time in the}} card cycle. The twelve exit hubs were wired to contacts on a rotary switch that turned with the card cycle. Thus wiring the 6 exit from an emitter to a punch magnet entry would cause a 6 to be punched at that position. Emitters {{might be used to}} put a numeric constant value, say a date, on every card. <b>Alphanumeric</b> constant <b>data</b> could be created by carefully combining digit and zone pulses. Later machines, such as the 407 also had a complete set of alphanumeric emitters that only required one wire to use.|$|R

Participants from the Army Air Defense School performed THAAD tasks under two levels of information load, using four equipment status designs: two <b>alphanumeric</b> (tabular <b>data),</b> a schematic (iconic diagrams), and a combination alphanumeric-schematic. Task time and accuracy were analyzed using a repeated measures factorial ANOVA. The results showed the combination alphanumeric-schematic status design produced the best performance across task and information load conditions, while the alphanumeric designs produced the worst performance.

Two factors, one with two levels (gender: male and female), and the second factor with three levels (mood: positive, neutral, and negative) were used in the analysis. The output was measured as the amount of characters memorized in a string of random <b>alphanumeric</b> characters. <b>Data</b> gathered showed that gender was not a significant factor (P= 0. 09), yet mood was a significant factor (P 3 ̆c 0. 005). Based on Tukey test, each level in the mood factor is significantly different among them.

Based on an extended version of the SWM dataset produced after proper feature extraction (see “SWM dataset” section), the synthetic dataset’s entries consist of an id, 10 features and two target variables of continuous (floating point with 10 decimals) and binary data representation, respectively. Each feature is ranged from 1 to 99 and the id is <b>alphanumeric.</b> The <b>data</b> representation, number and range of features was selected in order to maintain a relatively high number of dimensions, while being able to create a large number of records and at the same time avoiding exceeding the memory limits of the setup (approx. 8192 MB per mapper or reducer for the Hadoop case).

50|$|The {{first three}} {{machines}} were {{delivered in the}} northern spring of 1955; in late 1958 a DEUCE Mark II improved model appeared. This version employed a combined card reader and punch. The combined IBM 528 reader and punch behaved like the separate Hollerith units on the earlier DEUCE Mark I machines; however, it was provided with hardware conversion of <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>data</b> to BCD on input, and vice versa on output. Data could also be read in and punched simultaneously at 100 cards per minute. The DEUCE Mark IIA provided seven extra mercury delay lines, each of 32 words.|$|E
50|$|From about 1958, 7 extra delay lines {{could be}} attached, giving 224 more words of {{high-speed}} store.

Automatic conversion of <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>data</b> to BCD was provided on input, and the reverse operation on output, for all eighty card columns. On this equipment, reading and punching could proceed simultaneously, if required, and thus could be used for reading in a record, updating it, and then punching an updated record simultaneously with reading in the next record. With the 7 extra delay lines, the DEUCE was denoted Mark IIA.|$|E
50|$|The {{invention}} of the Intel 8080 microprocessor chip in April 1974 made practical {{the development of the}} (relatively) affordable mass-market microcomputer. In the USA this first appeared in early 1975 {{in the form of an}} unassembled kit, the Altair 8800; shortly afterward pre-assembled Altairs were offered. The sudden popularity of desktop computers happened because the 8080 CPU could represent and manipulate 256 discrete values in its 8-bit registers. Thus the 7-bit ASCII standard for the representation of <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>data</b> became feasible for the first time in a machine much smaller and less expensive than the furniture-size minicomputers, with their processors that occupied entire circuit boards. This new class of computer was practical for serious work because it could input, process, and output alphanumeric information. It also enabled sophisticated programs such as database managers and BASIC interpreters to become available to a larger market consisting of people possessing lesser technical skills.|$|E

40|$|Constraints on the CRT display {{size for}} the shuttle orbiter cabin are studied. The viewing {{requirements}} placed on these monitors were assumed to involve display of imaged scenes providing visual feedback during payload operations and display of <b>alphanumeric</b> characters. <b>Data</b> on target recognition/resolution, target recognition, and range rate detection by human observers were utilized to determine viewing requirements for imaged scenes.

The monitor size necessary to meet the acuity requirements was established. An empirical test was conducted to determine required recognition sizes for displayed alphanumeric characters. The results of the test were used to determine the number of characters which could be simultaneously displayed based on the recognition size requirements using the proposed monitor size. A CRT display of 20 x 20 cm is recommended.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} features in an urban geographic information system is the ability to locate addresses, in any form employed by the population, in a quick and efficient way. From an organized set of georeferenced address data, local governments, infrastructure companies, and the various agents that need to work in urban spaces can reliably and precisely locate points of their interest, in fields of application as diverse as public health services, crime fighting, product distribution, postal delivery and many others. This activity is known as geocoding, which can be defined as the process of locating points {{on the surface of the}} Earth from <b>alphanumeric</b> addressing <b>data</b> associated to events. This paper shows how geocoding can be implemented over incomplete and possibly inaccurate addressing data (which is the prevailing situation in Brazilian cities) and how users can benefit from the results of such a process. A geocoding quality indicator is proposed, with the intention of providing an indication of the degree of certainty that is associated with each individual result of the geocoding process. This indicator can then be used in spatial analysis, by giving analysts the opportunity to include the uncertainty associated with the data in their work. This project is under development, and a set of (as yet unimplemented) geocoding tools is proposed and described in the paper...|$|R
