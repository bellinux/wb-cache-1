2500|$|In the Palearctic, {{the golden}} eagle co-exists {{with several other}} large {{raptorial}} birds called eagles. Unlike in their relationship with smaller raptors, golden eagles are rarely reported to hunt other eagle species. Most conflicts between different eagles are over kills or carrion, though some species will defend nesting territories from each other. When it comes to carrion and kills, usually the “aggressor” (that is the eagle who initiates the agonistic behavior) is victorious over the other eagle. Considering that they overlap considerably in both distribution and prey selection, there is remarkably almost no known accounts from Eurasia of golden eagles behaving aggressively with other Aquila eagles. This is possibly due to segregated habitat preferences amongst these species, with lesser and greater spotted eagles being essentially woodland or wooded wetland-dwelling birds, Spanish and eastern imperial eagles inhabiting fragmented, open woods and steppe eagles generally living in flat, often treeless steppe and desert-like habitats. In central Asia, where golden eagles and other Aquila species are rare or absent, steppe eagles sometimes nest in mountainous rock formations like golden eagles. Compared to these eagles, the Bonelli's eagle {{appears to have a}} more contentious relationship with golden eagles, as they are often attracted to similar prey (largely rabbits and gamebirds) and occur in abutting habitats. The larger golden eagle is apparently dominant and, in at least one case, has killed and consumed a Bonelli's. The two species defend their territories from one another exclusively, in the same way they defend them from others of their own species. Both will use nests built by the other species, more so the golden using Bonelli's nests than vice versa. Further east, in Israel, Bonelli's and golden eagles are competitors as well. In the dry, barren Negev Desert, golden eagles nests were found [...] apart and Bonelli's were scarce. In the Judaean Desert, which has more annual rainfall and more available prey, the distance between golden eagle nests averaged [...] and the Bonelli's eagle easily outnumbered them. Apparently, the Bonelli's eagle exceptionally outcompeted its larger cousin here due to a subtle topographic variation in the habitat. Still, in areas without unnatural human pressures, the gradation between these species is still adequate enough that they can exist without serious negative effect on either population. In Japan, golden eagles were observed to hunt mountain hawk-eagles (Nisaetus nipalensis), {{despite the fact that the}} local race of hawk eagle is around the same mass as a Japanese golden eagle. The Bale Mountains of Ethiopia is arguably the richest biosphere the golden eagle is known to inhabit and there, this species may potentially interact with more than 10 other eagle species and nearly 30 other accipitrid species, including both migratory and resident breeding species. These are often supported by an exceptionally diverse, dense population of rodents there. The Bale Mountains golden eagles were recorded kleptoparatisizing steppe eagles, <b>augur</b> <b>buzzard</b> (Buteo augur), pallid harrier (Circus macrourus) and lanner falcons (Falco biarmicus) and the eagles were themselves kleptoparatisized by steppe eagles on three occasions. The golden eagles were also observed to chase tawny and steppe eagles out of their nesting territories. In the Bale Mountains, the golden eagle overlaps with perhaps its closest living relative, the Verreaux's eagle. The golden eagles appear to vigorously defend their territories from the Verreaux's eagles and, as in its relationship with the Bonelli's, the two species appear to maintain exclusive territories. Several chases involving the golden chasing Verreaux's were witnessed but only one where a Verreaux's chased off the golden. Despite several reported antagonistic interactions, no other raptors were found as prey in the Bale Mountains nests of golden eagles.|$|E

50|$|The opening {{programme}} {{shows how}} life has {{adapted to the}} volcanic highlands bordering the Rift Valley. Volcanic activity created the Ethiopian Highlands 30 million years ago, and is still evident at Erta Ale’s molten lava lake. Further south, it thrust up huge peaks such as Kilimanjaro and Mount Kenya. The mountain hyrax, <b>augur</b> <b>buzzard,</b> giant lobelia and side-striped chameleon {{are some of the}} species filmed on the latter's storm-blasted mountain slopes. In the Aberdares, an older, more eroded range, elephants and mountain bongos are marooned by surrounding human development. In the central Rift Valley, giant mastiff bats roost in a cave beneath the collapsed lava plateau of Mount Suswa. Infrared cameras reveal the activities of the bats and their unusual cohabitants, a troop of baboons. Ol Doinyo Lengai is Africa's most active volcano. The 2007 eruption showered the Serengeti plains with ash, ideal fertiliser for the grass that supports the vast game herds. To the south, the remote Kitulo Plateau in Tanzania is attracting considerable scientific attention due to its unique flora and fauna. The programme includes the first professional footage of the kipunji, a rare primate discovered in 2005. Other species shown include the montane widowbird, the Temple's chameleon and various monkey beetles. The final scenes show mountain gorillas in the Virunga Mountains. Inside the Great Rift shows how the crew enlisted the help of a local Maasai tribe to film inside Mount Suswa's cave.|$|E

40|$|A {{comparative}} study of the breeding ecology and behaviour of the <b>augur</b> <b>buzzard</b> Buteo augur was made between 1995 and 1998 in the southern Lake Naivasha area, Kenya. Populations in Hell's Gate National Park (Hell's Gate) a protected area, and two other locations (both modified by humans) within the Lake Naivasha environs - Mundui and Sulmac-Oserian were compared. The main aspects studied were nesting density, nest-site selection, breeding behaviour, diet, hunting success, prey availability, breeding seasonality and breeding performance. The methods used were nest searches, <b>augur</b> <b>buzzard</b> ringing, nest and foraging observations, pellet and prey remains collection and analyses, transect counts to determine prey availability, nest site habitat data collection and recording the outcome of active nests.;Mundui had the highest density of augur buzzards at 0. 83 pairs per km 2 compared to Hell's Gate (0. 28 pairs per km 2) and Sulmac-Oserian (0. 23 pairs per km 2). <b>Augur</b> <b>buzzard</b> pairs were more widely spaced in areas where human impacts had increased. Augur buzzards nested mainly in cliffs (in Hell's Gate) or trees (partly in Hell's Gate, exclusively elsewhere). In Numdui and Sulmac, augur buzzards selected mature, large canopied Acacia xanthophloea as nest trees while in Hell's Gate and Oserian, mature Euphorbia magnicapsular trees that grew on the steepest slopes were selected.;Augur buzzard pairs in the lake environs spent more time caring for chicks {{than their counterparts in}} Hell's Gate. This was shown by increased maternal care and paternal foraging which resulted in larger broods and more prey deliveries to nests respectively. The factors responsible for these were an abundant food supply coupled with reduced predation pressure and inter/intra-specific interactions. Augur buzzards in Hell's Gate exploited a broader range of prey, while those in the lake environs specialised on rodents, particularly mole-rats...|$|E

Grass height {{was the most important}} predictor of mole-rat availability in all three sites, although the other variables rainfall, temperature range and soil conditions maybe proximate in nature and their effects on mole-rats difficult to detect. Key words: mole-rat, <b>Augur</b> <b>Buzzard,</b> prey availability, Buteo, south Lake Naivasha nonnally increase during the rainy seasons, sometimes reaching a peak of abundance well beyond the capacity of any socially-regulated raptor population to limit it. Most of the rodent-eating raptors breed during or after the rains, especially in the Lake Naivasha region, in Kenya's Rift Valley Province (Figure 1) where they have been recorded to breed during the long rains (March to May) and mid-year dry season (June to August) (Brown and Britton, 1980). These times of breeding are considered to coincide with peaks of rodent abundance as well as vegetative cover (Brown and Britton, 1980) ...|$|E
