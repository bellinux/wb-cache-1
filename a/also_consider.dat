5|$|In May 2016, Turtle Rock {{announced}} {{that the company was}} working on a new intellectual property to be published by Perfect World Entertainment. The studio would <b>also</b> <b>consider</b> releasing titles via Steam's early access program, which allows players to provide feedback on unfinished games or products as they are being developed.|$|E
5|$|Manuel Alberti {{worked in}} journalism as well, at the Gazeta de Buenos Ayres {{newspaper}} {{created by the}} Junta. The ruling that created this newspaper gave Alberti the duty of selecting the news reports to publish. This duty was exclusive of Alberti and not shared with {{the other members of}} the Junta. Some historians <b>also</b> <b>consider</b> that Alberti may be the real author of the newspaper's editorials, as they were not signed and the style is not similar to other reports by Mariano Moreno, who is usually considered the author.|$|E
5|$|Several {{researchers}} <b>also</b> <b>consider</b> {{the connection}} between the Skene's gland and the G-spot to be weak. The urethral sponge, however, which is also hypothesized as the G-spot, contains sensitive nerve endings and erectile tissue. Sensitivity is not determined by neuron density alone: other factors include the branching patterns of neuron terminals and cross or collateral innervation of neurons. While G-spot opponents argue that because there are very few tactile nerve endings in the vagina and that therefore the G-spot cannot exist, G-spot proponents argue that vaginal orgasms rely on pressure-sensitive nerves.|$|E

50|$|Any {{continuous}} {{deformation of}} the curve above is <b>also</b> <b>considered</b> a trefoil knot. Specifically, any curve isotopic to a trefoil knot is <b>also</b> <b>considered</b> to be a trefoil. In addition, the mirror image of a trefoil knot is <b>also</b> <b>considered</b> to be a trefoil. In topology and knot theory, the trefoil is usually defined using a knot diagram instead of an explicit parametric equation.|$|R

5|$|All {{but two of}} the Hydrobatidae {{are mostly}} dark in colour with varying amounts of white on the rump. Two species have {{different}} plumage entirely, the Hornby's storm petrel which has white undersides and facial markings, and the fork-tailed storm petrel which has pale grey plumage. This is a notoriously difficult group to identify at sea. Onley and Scofield (2007) state that much published information is incorrect, and that photographs in the major seabird books and websites are frequently incorrectly ascribed as to species. They <b>also</b> <b>consider</b> that several national bird lists include species which have been incorrectly identified or have been accepted on inadequate evidence.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the project's conception, {{newspapers}} were reporting a rumor that the Soviet Union was planning to detonate a hydrogen bomb on the Moon. According to press reports in late 1957, an anonymous source had divulged to a United States Secret Service agent that the Soviets planned to commemorate the anniversary of the October Revolution by causing a nuclear explosion on the Moon to coincide with a lunar eclipse on 7 November. News reports of the rumored launch included mention of targeting {{the dark side of the}} terminator—Project A119 would <b>also</b> <b>consider</b> this boundary as the target for an explosion. It was also reported that a failure to hit the Moon would likely result in the missile returning to Earth.|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} 2000–500 BCE, {{in terms of}} culture, many regions of the subcontinent transitioned from the Chalcolithic to the Iron Age. The Vedas, the oldest scriptures {{associated}} with Hinduism, were composed during this period, and historians have analysed these to posit a Vedic culture in the Punjab region and the upper Gangetic Plain. Most historians <b>also</b> <b>consider</b> this period to have encompassed several waves of Indo-Aryan migration into the subcontinent from the north-west. The caste system, which created a hierarchy of priests, warriors, and free peasants, but which excluded indigenous peoples by labeling their occupations impure, arose during this period. On the Deccan Plateau, archaeological evidence from this period suggests {{the existence of a}} chiefdom stage of political organisation. In South India, a progression to sedentary life is indicated by the large number of megalithic monuments dating from this period, as well as by nearby traces of agriculture, irrigation tanks, and craft traditions.|$|E

5|$|Hoping {{to attract}} a {{proposed}} ZAP electric vehicle manufacturing plant {{to the city of}} Franklin, Kentucky, Beshear issued an executive order permitting low-speed vehicles on many Kentucky roads in August 2008. The state also offered the company $48 million in tax incentives, contingent upon its delivering a promised 4,000 jobs. Construction of the proposed plant stalled, however, when GE Capital, a primary investor, pulled out of the project. ZAP officials maintained their intention to build the plant, but said they would <b>also</b> <b>consider</b> other states' proposals if they could not replace the $125 million commitment from GE.|$|E
5|$|Ornithologists James Hancock and Jim Kushlan <b>also</b> <b>consider</b> {{the two to}} be {{a single}} species, with the {{differences}} in plumage, size, skin coloration and degree of bill darkening during breeding season forming the diagnostic characters. They have proposed the populations recontacted in northwestern South America {{after a period of}} separation, and that the color difference is likely due to the presence of an enzyme that allows uptake of pigment in the diet. They have questioned whether white-plumaged birds of South America are in fact part of the ruber rather than the albus taxon, and acknowledge that more investigation is needed to determine this.|$|E

The registration process at Norid is fully automated and does not include any steps to ensure that the user has the rights to the name. Disputes regarding the right to a domain name are handled retrospectively, either through the Alternative Dispute Resolution Committee or court proceedings.

The dispute bodies will <b>also</b> <b>consider</b> the risk of confusion, based on the domain name itself rather than the content of the site. For one domain, , the issue of ownership was subject to a Supreme Court case.|$|E
