5|$|Months {{after the}} {{hurricane}} season, when the National Hurricane Center was performing its annual review {{of the season and}} its named storms, forecasters Jack Beven and Eric Blake identified this previously unnoticed subtropical storm.

5|$|The {{depression}} quickly {{showed signs}} of organization {{with the development of}} banding features around its blossoming convection. Due to a favorable upper level environment, forecasters predicted the depression to intensify to a 70mph (110km/h) tropical storm after making landfall on Haiti and eastern Cuba. Upper-level outflow remained well-defined, though convection waned near the center early on August 22. The depression appeared to continue organizing, with <b>a</b> <b>well-defined</b> cloud band to its north and east. However, strong southwesterly wind shear unexpectedly increased over the system, and the depression degenerated into a tropical wave late on August 22, south of the eastern tip of the Dominican Republic. The system retained <b>a</b> <b>well-defined</b> cloud pattern with a vigorous mid-level circulation, and forecasters at the National Hurricane Center indicated regeneration could have occurred at any time. The wave axis moved over the Dominican Republic early on August 23, and became disorganized over the mountainous terrain of Hispaniola. There existed the potential for redevelopment as it moved into a potentially more favorable area, though the National Hurricane Center ceased monitoring the system on August 25 when redevelopment appeared unlikely.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} Hurricane Florence {{were from a}} {{tropical}} wave that moved through the Lesser Antilles into the eastern Caribbean on September21. The wave tracked generally westward, and spawned a tropical storm on September23 about 100mi (160km) southeast of Jamaica. Given the name Florence, the storm steadily intensified after developing, although <b>a</b> <b>well-defined</b> circulation was not observed until September24. That day, Florence attained hurricane status in the Yucatán Channel between the Yucatán Peninsula and the western tip of Cuba.|$|E
5|$|The storm rapidly {{weakened}} as {{it continued}} northward, and degenerated into a tropical depression by July 20.

The storm then turned to the northeast and strengthened into a severe cyclonic storm on May 4. Soon after this, it peaked with winds of 150km/h (90mph) and <b>a</b> <b>well-defined</b> eye formed. The storm made its landfall near Cox's Bazar in easternmost East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) early in the morning of May 7 and dissipated over western Burma that evening.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August 29. It tracked slowly westward, and first showed signs of development two days later. On August 31, a second tropical wave exited the coast of Africa at a faster speed than its predecessor. The two waves interacted, and by September 2 combined to form a large area of disturbed weather across the eastern Atlantic Ocean. Convection increased within the system, and it developed a concentrated area of convection in conjunction with <b>a</b> <b>well-defined</b> low pressure area. By late on September 3, the system maintained a broad closed circulation and enough convective organization to be classified Tropical Depression Six while located about midway between the Lesser Antilles and Africa.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on October4. It moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean without development, and entered the eastern Pacific Ocean on October18. The next day, it combined with a previously existing area of disturbed weather, resulting in a large area of convection extending northward into southern Mexico. The broad and disorganized system moved westward at 1015mph (1624km/h). On October20, the system developed an area of low pressure, and began to show signs of organization. It continued to organize, and developed into Tropical Depression Seventeen-E on October21 while located about 265miles (425km) south-southwest of Manzanillo. Upon forming, the depression possessed a small, tight low-level circulation beneath <b>a</b> <b>well-defined</b> mid-level circulation. Easterly wind shear initially restricted upper-level outflow as the cyclone moved to the west, a motion due to a subtropical ridge to its north.|$|E
5|$|A {{vigorous}} tropical wave {{exited the}} west coast of Africa on September 3. It quickly developed an area of deep convection with <b>a</b> <b>well-defined</b> circulation, which prompted it being classified a tropical depression on September4. At the time it was situated hundreds of miles south of Cape Verde at a very low latitude of 7.2°N. Initial intensification was slow as the system moved northwestward, a movement caused by a large mid-level trough over the central Atlantic. On September5 the NHC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Isidore. Subsequently, it intensified at a faster rate, becoming a hurricane on September6. The following day, satellite estimates from the Dvorak technique suggested a peak intensity of 100mph (165km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 978 mbar (hPa; 28.88 inHg).|$|E
