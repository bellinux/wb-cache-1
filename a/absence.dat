40|$|Student <b>absences</b> are a {{potentially}} important, yet understudied, input {{in the educational}} process. Using longitudinal data from a nationally-representative survey and rich administrative records from North Carolina, we investigate the relationship between student <b>absences</b> and academic performance. Generally, student <b>absences</b> are associated with modest but statistically significant decreases in academic achievement. The harmful effects of <b>absences</b> are approximately linear, and are {{two to three times}} larger among fourth and fifth graders in North Carolina than among kindergarten and first-grade students in the nationally representative Early Childhood Longitudinal Study. In both datasets, <b>absences</b> similarly reduce achievement in urban, rural, and suburban schools. In North Carolina, the harm associated with student <b>absences</b> is greater among both low-income students and English language learners, particularly for reading achievement. Also, in North Carolina, unexcused <b>absences</b> are twice as harmful as excused <b>absences.</b> Policy implications and directions for future research are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Sick {{workers in}} many {{countries}} receive sick pay during their illness- related <b>absences</b> from the workplace. In several countries, {{the social security system}} insures firms against their workers 9 ̆ 2 sickness <b>absences.</b> However, this insurance may create moral hazard problems for firms, leading to the inefficient monitoring of <b>absences</b> or to an underinvestment in their prevention. In the present paper, we investigate firms 9 ̆ 2 moral hazard problems in sickness <b>absences</b> by analyzing a legislative change that took place in Austria in 2000. In September 2000, an insurance fund that refunded firms for the costs of their blue-collar workers 9 ̆ 2 sickness <b>absences</b> was abolished (firms did not receive a similar refund for their white-collar workers 9 ̆ 2 sickness <b>absences).</b> Before that time, small firms were fully refunded for the wage costs of blue- collar workers 9 ̆ 2 sickness <b>absences.</b> Large firms, by contrast, were refunded only 70...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{potential}} role of adverse working {{conditions in the}} determination of workers’ sickness <b>absences.</b> Our data contain detailed information on the prevalence of job disamenities at the workplace from {{a representative sample of}} Finnish workers. The results from reduced-form models reveal that workers facing adverse working conditions tend to have a greater number of sickness <b>absences.</b> In addition, reduced-form models clearly show that regional labour market conditions are an important determinant of sickness <b>absences.</b> Hence, sickness <b>absences</b> are more common in regions of low unemployment. Recursive models suggest that job disamenities are associated with job dissatisfaction and dissatisfaction with workers’ sickness <b>absences.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Whether or not {{value-added}} models should {{control for}} contemporaneous student <b>absences</b> is theoretically ambiguous, as such <b>absences</b> are only partly outside of teachers' control. Teachers often feel strongly that value-added models should account for student attendance, and many districts' value-added models condition on lagged student <b>absences</b> as a result. Using matched teacher-student administrative {{data from a}} state-wide longitudinal data system, this note investigates the practical importance of this modeling decision for value-added measures of teacher effectiveness (VAMs). This is done by comparing VAM-based rankings of teacher effectiveness generated by value-added models that either control for current <b>absences,</b> control for lagged <b>absences,</b> or exclude student <b>absences</b> altogether. Regardless of how between-school differences are accounted for, VAM-based rankings of teacher effectiveness are insensitive to how, and whether, student <b>absences</b> enter the value-added model's conditioning set. Spearman Rank Correlations are always larger than 0. 99 for both math and reading VAMs, suggesting that whether or not value-added models control for annual student <b>absences</b> is a relatively unimportant modeling decision, {{at least in the}} context of self-contained primary school classroom teachers. These results are consistent with recent research suggesting that simply conditioning on lagged achievement yields approximately unbiased VAMs. Moreover, these findings suggest that controlling for student <b>absences</b> in teacher evaluation systems' value-added models is a relatively inexpensive way to increase teacher buy-in...|$|R

The relationship between the percentage of school <b>absences</b> due to respiratory problems and the concentration of particulate matter in March and from April to June presented a distinct behavior: <b>absences</b> increased alongside the increase in particulate matter concentration.

40|$|Labor {{absenteeism}} {{has been}} identified as one of the main factors delaying construction projects. This paper reports an approach to quantitatively estimate the effect of labor absenteeism on the duration of construction activities in housing projects, using discrete event simulation. Absenteeism and productivity data from fourteen housing projects were used to estimate the effect of absenteeism on four construction activities from three different projects. Moreover, four different absenteeism scenarios were analyzed with this methodology: no <b>absences</b> of skilled or unskilled workers; with <b>absences</b> of unskilled workers only; with <b>absences</b> of skilled workers only; and with <b>absences</b> of both skilled and unskilled workers at the same time. As expected, the results exposed that the <b>absences</b> of skilled workers have a greater impact on the runtime of construction activities than the <b>absences</b> of unskilled ones; while the scenario with simultaneous <b>absences</b> of skilled and unskilled workers caused the greatest delays and productivity losses in the activities. The methodology was proved effective to determine the effect of labor absenteeism on the duration and productivity of construction activities. Contractors could apply this approach in order to improve their scheduling procedures, as well as to increase certainty in the attainment of project goals...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To test a {{theoretical}} {{model in which}} workaholism predicts both directly and indirectly, via psychophysic strain, job performance and sickness <b>absences.</b> METHODS: A multimethod study was performed examining a sample of 322 workers in a private company. The study was articulated into two phases, over a time period of 15 months. Workaholism was assessed using a self-report measure (time 1). Psychophysic strain {{was measured by the}} occupational physician, performance by the supervisor, and data on sickness <b>absences</b> were collected from the company's database (time 2). RESULTS: Results highlighted a positive relationship between workaholism and psychophysic strain. Psychophysic strain was negatively associated with job performance and positively associated with sickness <b>absences.</b> In addition, workaholism predicted sickness <b>absences.</b> CONCLUSION: Workaholism negatively affects the health of workers.
