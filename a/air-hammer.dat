40|$|The {{reason for}} the {{implementation}} of the project was that one wanted to optimize a drilling program. The drilling program should be used in the geothermal project to CEE energy in Slovakia. The research area is important to develop a broad understanding of drilling in its entirety, and also the possibility to combine <b>air-hammer</b> drilling with conventional rotary drilling. More equipment and planning are required, but better optimization can be obtained. It is also introduced an innovative drilling method called electromagnetic pulse drilling. This is not done calculations for, but it is discussed in theory as an alternative method. The problem of the project related to the thesis is to drill down to the reservoir with as large diameter as possible. This is necessary financially to meet the production target without pressure loss to become too large. This presents challenges particularly with <b>air-hammer</b> when you get large annulus with a lot of cuttings to be lifted. It has been working extensively with model building in this master. This is done {{as a result of that}} there is little knowledge of the formation. Moreover, it helps to create a theoretical basis that can serve as framework for the different drilling methods. For the hammer, the model was built with respect to lift cuttings and hammer effect associated with ROP. The model is limited to the settling velocity of spherical particle in the annulus. It also takes into account that the air can be compressed when pressure drop is calculated. For rotary drilling it was focused more on the calculation of the ROP against mechanical refractive energy. PDC and roller-cone drill bit was considered, the models takes parameters such as RPM, formation strength, number of teeth or cutters in contact with the formation, etc. Estimated ROP are compared to resulting MSE to check reality against other values from the reference. For PDC it is assumed that MSE is equal to formation strength when the bit is running smoothly. If not energy is lost. For <b>air-hammer</b> there are clear indications that the inflow of water aggravates the situation considerably. It is difficult to relate the estimated depth to reality especially in terms of complexity when the flow of water occurs. Theoretically the model varies the critical depth with both particle size and water in the annulus. Depth Interval with 22 inch hammer is 350 - 700 meters. It is believed that pressure, water and fractured formation falling from the well wall can quickly worsen this. For rotary drilling after the <b>air-hammer</b> stops one assumes that PDC bits has problems drilling this formation. This is especially due to the formation hardness and content of abrasive minerals. Broken cutters in the shape of grinding or bending are problematic and can quickly become expensive. Here roller-con bits are advantageous since they are better suited to hard formation. For roller-cone it was estimated an interval for ROP which is 1. 0 to 1. 5 [m / h]. This is not particularly fast, but in reality this may be bigger since uncertainty exists with respect to formation test. Another argument is that this is estimated on the basis of a solid and strong matrix. From the microscopy it can be seen that the matrix is fractured and oxidized, this can quickly lead to a significant increase of ROP which is very positive from an economic point of view. Based on the results, it is assumed that the roller-cone bit is more effective than PDC after you stop using the air hammer. If you do not meet high pore pressure at shallow depths it may also be desirable to decrease the diameter of the hammer. This can increase ROP and also the maximum attainable depth with the hammer. However, if the hammer meets high pressure one may get into trouble since air is to light to counter the pore pressure. This can result in a blowout. </p...|$|E
40|$|This report {{represents}} {{results from}} a study to determine the fatigue strength of steel beams with welded partial-length cover plates. Results of an experimental investigation that examined the fatigue strength of various cracked cover plate end details that were subsequently repaired are presented. The repair methods investigated included a slip-critical bolted splice plate connection, <b>air-hammer</b> peening, and {{a combination of the}} previous two called a partial bolted splice connection. Also, an analytical model was developed to predict the fatigue behavior of a cover plate and detail that is repaired using one of the three repair methods investigated and which contains a fatigue crack of a known size. The results of both the experimental and analytical studies indicated that a tapered cover plate detail can be effectively repaired with a corresponding improvement in the fatigue resistance...|$|E
40|$|Fatigue {{problem in}} steel bridge has been {{investigated}} {{for a long time}} by structural engineers. Various surface treatments such as shot peening, <b>air-hammer</b> peening, grinding, polishing, can improve the fatigue life of steel component. In recent years, Fluid Bed Peening (FBP) methods are investigated at the university of Rome “Tor Vergata”. Fluid Bed Peening (FBP) as a technique of surface treatments can dramatically improve the fatigue behaviour, and demand less operational parameters. Material tests done by M. Barletta et al. showed FBP can improve the roughness of material surface significantly. The measurements showed the surface properties were significantly improved, and were supposed to increase the fatigue resistance. In this paper, the fatigue behavior of specimens treated by FBP was investigated. The specimens were divided into four different groups: simple (group A), simple and treated by FBP (group B), notched (group C), notched and treated by FBP (group D), and were tested under cyclic constant-amplitude loading. Based on the tests, this paper focused on the improvement effect to the fatigue behavior of the specimens, and also the surface properties were discussed...|$|E
