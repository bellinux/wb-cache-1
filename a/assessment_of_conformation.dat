40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to test a {{possible}} way of monitoring cattle carcass classification using a statistical approach. For that purpose the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA by SAS) was used with the fixed effect of the abattoir, carcass weight (as a covariate) and their interaction. The analysis was based on the relationship between carcass weight and conformation or fatness grades. We tested if the regression lines of individual abattoirs differ from the average. The analysis comprised data for young bulls of Simmental breed slaughtered in Slovenia in the period from 2007 to 2010 (52, 624 records). Results showed that in many abattoirs the <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>conformation</b> and fatness deviates significantly from the average, i. e. regression lines for several abattoirs differ significantly from the average (population) line.

The results of 1, 232 starts of 894 four-, five-, six-, and seven-year-old horses, obtained during jumping championships for young horses which had not been evaluated in, alternative to championships, training centres were analyed. Nine traits were chosen of those recorded: ranking in the championship, elimination (y/n), conformation, rating of style on day one, two, and three, and penalty points on day one, two, and three of a championship. (Co) variance components were estimated via the Gibbs sampling procedure and adequate (co) variance component ratios were calculated. Statistical classifications were trait dependent but all fitted random additive genetic and permanent environment effects. It was found that such characteristics as penalty points and jumping style are potential indicators of jumping ability, and the genetic variability of the traits was within the range of 14 % to 27 %.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of the levels of replacement of ground corn by forage cactus meal in the diet on the muscularity and adiposity of carcass of Santa Inês lambs finished at feedlot. This study was carried out at Estação Experimental de Pendência, belonging to Empresa de Pesquisa Agropecuária da Paraíba S. A. (EMEPA-PB). Forty male Santa Inês lambs in feedlot were used in the experiment. Treatments were randomly assigned to the animals according to a completely randomized design, with four treatments, that consisted of growing substitution levels of ground corn for forage cactus meal: 0, 33, 66 and 100 % of substitution and ten replications (lambs). Animals were slaughtered and carcasses cooled for 24 hours for later <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>conformation,</b> morphometry, loin eye-muscle area, fatness, perirenal fat, marbling and subcutaneous fat thickness. Legs were separated for dissection of muscle, bone, subcutaneous fat, intermuscle fat and total fat, which were weighed for the determination of the muscle:bone and muscle:fat relation and the relative weight of tissue components. Averages were submitted to variance and regression analyses at a 5 % level of probability. Diets had no effect on carcass conformation. However, a negative linear effect on weights and yields of fats was observed with the increased levels of forage cactus meal in the diet, and the opposite was observed in the muscle yield behavior. Forage cactus meal is biologically as efficient as ground corn, because it increases the muscularity and reduces the adiposity of the carcass of Santa Inês lambs in feedlot...|$|E

Bulls entered the station at 6 to 8 weeks of age and, after an adaptation period of 3 months, were tested for growth, live fleshiness and bone thinness. Length of test was 196 days. Growth traits considered were gain at farm, gain during the adaptation period, gain on test and total gain at the station. Six different fleshiness traits and bone thinness were scored on live animals {{at the end of}} the test using a linear system. Live evaluations of fleshiness were adjusted for the weight at scoring in order to provide an <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>conformation</b> independent of body size. Genetic parameters were estimated using animal models. Heritability of live-weight gain ranged from 0 · 20 in the adaptation period to 0 · 60 for total gain at the station. Genetic correlations between gains at station in different periods were high (from 0 · 63 to 0 · 97). Residual correlation between gain during the adaptation period and gain during test was negative, probably due to the occurrence of compensatory growth of the animals. Live fleshiness traits and bone thinness were of moderate to high heritability (from 0 · 34 to 0 · 55) and highly correlated indicating that heavy muscled bulls also have thin bones. Accuracy of breeding values and therefore response to selection were improved by multiple trait analysis of the live fleshiness traits and bone thinness.

Heritability estimates were generally higher for shoulder tissue proportions (0, 3) than for visual scores (0. 2).

40|$|The {{hoof wall}} {{is adapted to}} take most of the {{weight-bearing}} of the foot and is anisotropic and homogeneous. Foals appear to be born with symmetrical paired feet which by maturity are frequently unequal in angle and width. They stand within minutes of birth subjecting the hoof wall to loading. Hoof growth rate and hoof compression may be factors affecting hoof shape. The effect of conformation changes during maturation upon loading and differential hoof growth was unknown. The aims were to; quantify and evaluate the epidermal structure, hoof growth rate, hoof renewal, dorsal hoof wall angle, plastic hoof compression, and hoof loading, during paediatric development. Hoof growth rate, renewal, and hoof angle were recorded in foals (n= 80) and weanlings/yearlings (n= 12) and the hoof wall structure of histological samples of fetuses and paediatric foals (n= 15) was determined. Solar loading, hoof growth, and hoof angle was recorded in healthy foals (n= 18) and compared to a group with acquired flexural deformity (n= 9). Horn tubule size and number increased significantly, and density decreased significantly during maturation. The dorsal hoof wall angle declined with age. Hoof renewal in newborn foals was 145 ± 15 days whereas weaning/yearlings were 283 ± 26 days. A relationship between plastic hoof compression and time was found (r = 0. 46, P = 0. 002). Hoof compression in foals was 0. 039 ± 0. 022 mm per day and in weanling/yearlings 0. 03 ± 0. 016 mm per day. Hoof growth rate, hoof compression, and dorsal hoof wall angle, all correlated to ageing and differed between the healthy and acquired flexural deformity foals. The original findings in this thesis give a broad understanding of the developing equine hoof wall. Knowledge of renewal times allows predictions of healing in cases of partial hoof wall avulsion.

40|$|The {{growth rate}} and carcass {{characteristics}} of rangy and short conformation types of steers in Angus, Hereford and Beef Shorthorn breeds were compared in two trials (Trials X and XI) at Massey University. Rangy and short type weaner steers were chosen {{on the basis}} of visual <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>conformation</b> by experienced stockmen. The Angus steers in Trial X came from the one herd as did the Hereford steers in Trial XI. The two types of Angus (Trial XI) and Beef Shorthorn (Trial X) steers were bred in four different herds. Types within a breed were chosen by the same people, but different persons selected the representative steers in each breed. The steers were grazed together at pasture (except for a short period on a wintering yard in their second year of life) and weighed "full" at various intervals. They were slaughtered at an age of about 30 months. They were processed according to normal commercial practice and various aspects of carcass yield, composition and data on carcass weight, grade, fat colour, and chiller shrinkage were collected, various carcass measurements were taken and the weights of fat and bone were recorded for the right side quarters of each carcass. Fifteen steers were purchased of each type. Trial X concluded in March 1976 (after a period of 625 days) with 13 rangy and 14 short Angus steers, and 14 rangy and 15 short Beef Shorthorn steers. There were no animal losses in Trial XI (633 days) which finished in April 1977 (with 15 steers in each type group) in which the two types in the Angus and Hereford breeds were compared. The results were analysed within trials by the fitting constants procedure using fixed-effects linear models. Type effects were compared within each breed group. One model included {{the right side of the}} cold carcass as a covariate for some aspects of the carcass data analysed within a breed. Rangy type steers in each breed had heavier initial and final liveweights and carcass weights than short type steers. Rangy steers grew more rapidly than short steers in three of the four comparisons. There was no significant difference in growth rate between types of Angus steers in either trial. Rangy Angus steers gained 0. 02 kg/day (n. s.) more than short Angus steers in Trial X, but the short steers grew faster in Trial XIf 0. 03 kg/day (n. s.) and they may have exhibited compensatory growth in the first half of the trial. Rangy Beef Shorthorn and Hereford steers showed a greater superiority in growth rate (Beef Shorthorn 0. 07 kg/day, P< 0. 001; Hereford 0. 06 kg/day, P< 0. 001), compared with short type steers of these two breeds. These differences are important advantages in beef production, however the large difference in growth rate meant that because all steers were slaughtered at the same time (to meet the experimental design) the faster-growing Beef Shorthorn and Hereford steers were carried to much heavier weights than would be normal in most farming situations and this adversely affected their carcass composition, because of higher proportions of fat resulting from their heavier carcass weights. An analysis of the order in which steers were slaughtered showed that they moved into the stunning box independent of their type, breed group or liveweight. This finding indicated that data collection subsequent to the processing of the carcasses or in the boning-out of the quarters would be spread across types and breeds randomly. There were very small, non-significant differences between types in dressing-out percentage, carcass shrinkage in the chiller overnight (by weight, or as a percentage of hot carcass weight), and between the weight of the right and left sides of the carcass. This meant that the types tended to rank in the same order if their mean carcass composition was expressed on either a right side, cold or hot carcass basis, or liveweight basis. Preliminary statistical analysis showed there was little difference between types in the distribution of trimmed, boneless lean, bone and trimmed-off fat between the forequarters and hindquarters of the right sides. Therefore the data for each quarter were pooled and the composition of the right side of each carcass was compared between types. Rangy steers yielded a greater weight of trimmed, boneless lean and bone in each breed group. They yielded a lower weight of excess fat in Angus steers, but not in Beef Shorthorn or Hereford steers. There were small, inconsistent differences between types in the percentage of commercially trimmed boneless lean and bone, but larger differences in the percentage of excess fat trimmed from the right side of the carcass. The size of the type differences was influenced by right side weight. The ratio of trimmed meat to bone did not differ significantly between types, therefore it was concluded that the main determinant of the differences in the percentage yields was the amount of excess trimmed fat. Rangy steers tended to have a lower percentage of excess fat and were leaner than short steers except in the case of the Beef Shorthorns and Herefords. Angus types had similar amounts of kidney and channel fat (no significant difference between types in Trials X and XI, respectively). Rangy steers had more kidney and channel fat than short steers in Beef Shorthorns (1. 73 kg, P< 0. 05) and Herefords (2. 22 kg, P< 0. 01). When adjusted for right side weight there was less kidney and channel fat in rangy than short Angus (0. 72 kg, n. s. Trial X, 1. 72 kg, P< 0. 05 Trial XI) and Beef Shorthorns (0. 53 kg, n. s.), but slightly more in rangy Herefords (0. 53 kg, n. s.). Rangy Angus (Trial X) and Beef Shorthorn steers had less fat over the 12 th ribeye than short steers (2. 0 and 1. 5 mm, n. s., respectively). There was little difference in fat depth between Angus (Trial XI) and Hereford types (0. 6 and 0. 8 mm, n. s., respectively). When the depth of fat over the ribeye of the 12 th rib was adjusted for right side weight short steers had a slightly greater depth of fat than rangy steers in Angus (2. 5 mm, n. s.) and Beef Shorthorns (5. 1 mm, n. s.) in Trial X. However in Trial XI rangy Angus steers had a slightly greater depth of fat than short steers (0. 4 mm, n. s.), but there was no difference between types in Herefords. Rangy steers had larger ribeyes than short steers except in Herefords. The difference in ribeye areas between types was 2. 51 cm 2 (n. s.) in Angus Trial X, 6. 77 cm 2 (P< 0. 01) in Beef Shorthorns and 5. 81 cm 2 (P< 0. 05) in Angus Trial XI. Short Hereford steers had larger ribeye areas than rangy steers by 3. 77 cm 2 (n. s.). These differences were reduced and became non-significant when adjusted for right side weight except in Herefords where short steers had significantly largerribeyes (6. 76 cm 2, P< 0. 01). Rangy steers had longer carcasses than short steers and longer bone measurements. They had a deeper carcass than short steers in Beef Shorthorn and Hereford steers, but not in Angus steers. The measurement of the depth of the carcass was influenced by fatness which appeared visually to increase the depth of short carcasses in relation to their skeletal size. The types did nof differ in the ratio of carcass length to carcass depth. When carcass dimensions were adjusted for right side weight the differences between types generally became non-significant except in Beef Shorthorn cattle. Rangy steers had slightly greater measures of carcass length, length of the leg and forearm, but had shorter measures of carcass depth than short-type steers except in Beef Shorthorns although the differences were not large. It was concluded that selection of rangy- compared to short-type weaner steers by visual <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>conformation</b> resulted in more beef being produced by the Angus, Hereford and Beef Shorthorn cattle. The reasons for increased production were various. In each comparison between types the superior initial weight of rangy weaner steers contributed about half of the increase in final yield of lean (assuming a similar composition at weaning). Rapid growth rate of rangy steers in Beef Shorthorn and Herefords contributed to their increased yield of lean although they were over-finished as a consequence of their greater growth rate and the experimental design requiring all cattle to be slaughtered at one time. Growth rate was not found to be an important factor in Angus steers where it appeared that a small superiority in carcass composition resulted in a greater yield of lean meat from rangy steers. Analysis of carcass composition and dimensions at slaughter showed considerable variation within each type. Ratios of body length to depth did not differ and in this respect rangy steers were "bigger" and heavier than short steers though not disproportionately so in relation to weight. The variation within each type suggested that some steers would have been classified into the other group had this been done at the conclusion of the trial. The ratio of body length to chest depth is not a true measure of skeletal size because of the influence of carcass fat in measuring chost depth. It would thus be unwise to draw conclusions about proportionality in size from this study. The experiment has indirectly shown the importance of a heavy weaning weight, of rapid growth rate, and of lean content in beef production. The relative importance of other factors such as age, pre-weaning growth rate, sire and dam and the pre-trial environment could not be assessed with the cattle purchased for this investigation. Visual assessment was not consistent in terms of selection for the same trait. This may have been due to the effect of different persons (between breeds) and their interpretation of "types" and to the amount of phenotypic variation for type in the population from which the steers were selected. The trends observed in this study are in the right direction to improve beef production of traditional beef breeds. The concept will be of use to farmers and others who choose cattle with or without records. The carcasses were graded either P 1 or G in both trials. The number of carcasses in each grade were: Trial X G= 33, P 1 = 23; Trial XI G= 16, P 1 = 44, An analysis tested the hypothesis that there were no differences between grades in carcass characteristics. Carcasses graded G were heavier (15. 4 kg, P< 0. 05) in Trial X, but not significantly so in Trial XI (7. 9 kg, n. s.). They had no more kidney and channel fat (1. 10 kg, n. s., Trial X and 0. 56 kg, n. s. Trial XI) than carcasses graded P 1. Results for other carcass characteristics were inconsistent between trials. Carcasses graded G in Trial X had a greater depth of fat over the 12 th ribeye (2. 4 mm, P< 0. 05), and a greater proportion of excess fat and less trimmed lean of the right side of the carcass (2. 26 % fat, P< 0. 001, and 1. 58 % lean, P< 0. 05). These results agree with grade expectations. In Trial XI however, carcasses graded G had the same fat depth over the 12 th ribeye (0. 0 mm, n. s.), less excess fat trim and more lean as a percentage of right side weight (1. 74 % fat, P< 0. 01, 1. 72 % lean, P< 0. 05) in direct contradiction to the results of Trial X and of grade expectations. Subjective visual assessment of fat depth from the uncut surface of the carcass resulted in 60 and 88 percent of carcasses being wrongly classified in relation to G grade standards (Trials X and XI, respectively). Graders had more success in classifying "leaner" carcasses 30 and 25 percent of carcasses graded P 1 had fat depths outside the grade specification (Trials X and XI, respectively) and then by only a few millimetres. Carcasses graded G in Trial X were of a similar "size" to those graded P 1, but were heavier, whereas in Trial XI carcasses graded G were "larger", but of a similar weight...|$|E

Firstly, the conformational behavior of calf-thymus DNA molecules in TE buffer solution is presented as a function of temperature. Secondly, their rheological behavior is discussed, as well as the evidence of the critical concentrations, i. e., the overlap and the entanglement concentrations (C* and Ce, respectively) from steady state flow and oscillatory dynamic shear experiments. The determination of the viscosity in the Newtonian plateau obtained from flow curves η () allows estimation of the intrinsic viscosity and the specific viscosities at zero shear when C[η] 2. 0 mg/mL) and temperature (10 °C < T < 40 °C) ...|$|R
40|$|Crystal {{structures}} {{deposited in}} the Protein Data Bank illustrate the diversity of biological macromolecular recognition: transient interactions in protein–protein and protein– DNA complexes and permanent assemblies in homodimeric proteins. The geometric and physical chemical properties of the macromolecular interfaces that may govern the stability and specificity of recognition are explored in complexes and homodimers compared with crystal-packing interactions. It is found that crystal-packing interfaces are usually much smaller; they bury fewer atoms and are less tightly packed than in specific assemblies. Standard-size interfaces burying 1200 – 2000 A ˚ 2 of protein surface occur in protease–inhibitor and antigen–antibody complexes that assemble {{with little or no}} conformation changes. Short-lived electron-transfer complexes have small interfaces; the larger size of the interfaces observed in complexes involved in signal transduction and homodimers correlates with the presence <b>of</b> <b>conformation</b> changes, often implicated in biological function. Results of the CAPRI (critical <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> predicted interactions) blind prediction experiment show that docking algorithms efficiently and accurately predict the mode of assembly of proteins that do not change conformation when they associate. They perform less well in the presence <b>of</b> large <b>conformation</b> changes and the experiment stimulates the development of novel procedures that can handle such changes...|$|R

40|$|The {{properties}} {{and functions of}} (bio) molecules {{are closely related to}} their molecular <b>conformations.</b> A variety <b>of</b> methods are available to sample the conformational space at a relatively low level of theory. If a higher level of theory is required, the computational cost can be reduced by selecting a uniformly distributed set <b>of</b> <b>conformations</b> from the ensemble <b>of</b> <b>conformations</b> generated at a low level of theory and by optimizing this selected set at a higher level. The generation of conformers is performed using molecular dynamics runs which are analyzed using the MD-Tracks code [J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2008, 48, 2414]. This article presents a Kennard Stone-based algorithm, with a distance measure based on the distance matrix, for the selection of the most diverse set <b>of</b> <b>conformations.</b> The method has been successfully applied to macrocyclic alkenes. The correct thermodynamic stability of the double-bond isomers of a flexible macrocyclic alkene containing two chiral centers is reproduced. The double-bond configuration has a limited effect on the <b>conformation</b> <b>of</b> the whole macrocycle. The chirality of the stereocenters has a larger effect on the molecular conformations...|$|R
