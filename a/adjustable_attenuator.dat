30|$|In {{order to}} {{simulate}} the attenuation introduced by the radio propagation in the 2.4 -GHz ISM band between the transmitter and the receiver, we utilize two <b>adjustable</b> microwave <b>attenuators</b> (the 8494 B [35] and 8496 B [36] models from Agilent). These manual step attenuators are able to operate from 0 to 18 GHz. The 8494 B model provides a calibrated attenuation level from 0 to 11 dB with an attenuation step of 1 dB. Similarly, the range and attenuation step of the 8496 B model are [0 - 110 dB] and 10 dB, respectively. As depicted in Figure 1, the two devices are coupled in series and connected with the SMA antenna connector of the transmitting BT board. Thus, a global adjustable signal attenuation of up to 121 dB with a resolution of 1 dB can be achieved.|$|R
40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the effectiveness of}} receiver/data loggers for monitoring the presence/absence of radiocollared animals in discrete areas. Our primary objective was to determine how variation in transmitter signal strength affected the size of area being monitored. This information will help researchers better manage the uncertainty related to determining an animal’s location relative to a discrete boundary. We used an <b>adjustable</b> <b>attenuator</b> to measure signal strength to determine the minimum number of decibels (dB) required to eliminate detection of a radio signal by receiver/data loggers. We quantified how dB varied depending upon orientation of the transmitter on the animal and distance from receiver/data logger (radius of detection). Based upon this signal strength variation, we then calculated a zone of uncertainty (i. e., {{the area in which}} detection of a radio signal was uncertain at a particular radius of detection). The zone of uncertainty increased exponentially with a linear increase in radius of detection. We do not recommend using receiver/data loggers to monitor radiocollared animals in discrete areas unless uncertainty is acceptable...|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} scheme of optical {{feedback}} cavity-enhanced absorption spectroscopy (OF-CEAS) including a fast optical switch to produce cavity ringdown spectra (OF-CRDS) simultaneously. This also {{works as a}} dynamically <b>adjustable</b> variable <b>attenuator</b> allowing to compensate for reduced signal levels in correspondence with absorption lines. For this, an acousto-optic deflector is used in a double-pass configuration to eliminate the single-pass frequency shift, which is incompatible with optical feedback. This {{is probably the most}} effective device providing the required fast response and the high extinction ratio necessary to perform clean ringdown measurements. The resulting direct comparison of OF-CEAS and OF-CRDS shows that these produce almost equivalent spectral data, with 0. 3 % maximal difference at the top of an absorption line having a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 3, 300. OF-CEAS is largely winning on the short-term noise level while OF-CRDS appears to be more immune from interference fringes, delivering cleaner spectra after longer averaging...|$|R
40|$|Different geographies {{and localities}} {{around the world}} have adopted various {{wireless}} interface standards for mobile communications. As a result roaming users will require multiple handsets with multiple standards and multiple band capabilities. Triple-band hand sets are currently offered for high end users. In the future quad-band handsets including GSM 850 will become common in the market. This trend will continue. The addition of third generation functionality to second generation platforms will be even more difficult and complex. The radio handset should {{be able to use the}} same hardware for communications anywhere in the world. Therefore users will require small low cost terminals with multimode/ multi-band capability. The software radio concept has been developed to address these challenges. The replacement of fixed frequency components in the front end of the software radio is one of the key architectural changes required. The duplexer is one such component. Since duplexing filters are not normally tuneable, each band requires a separate duplexer in a multi-band system. The duplexers are passive devices (ceramic or SAW) and multiple duplexers lead to a dramatic increase in terminal cost and size. Abstract Adaptive Duplexer for Software Radio iv This thesis proposes a new adaptive duplexer architecture to reduce/eliminate the multiple duplexer problem in software radio. This technique is based on combining a low isolation device with an adaptive double loop cancelling scheme. The proposed double loop cancellation provides the required transmitter leakage and transmitter noise isolation over wideband using a delay element and an <b>adjustable</b> vector <b>attenuator</b> in each cancellation path. This thesis analyses the double loop cancellation technique. The cancellation path delay constraints are derived for coefficients with limited adjustment range in the cancellation paths. A linear relationship between the bandwidth and the achievable cancellation level is obtained. It is shown that the residual signal power is proportional to the square of the duplexing frequency. It is concluded that the delays in the cancellation paths should be chosen to straddle the expected range variation of the delay in the main path, predominantly caused by variations in antenna matching. The new algorithm uses a single cost function to achieve simultaneous cancellation in both the transmit band and the receive band. A direct conversion receiver architecture was chosen for the hardware prototype, since it is more suitable for multi-band systems. Alternate structures are also possible. A prototype of the adaptive duplexer using a 20 dB circulator and a single loop cancelling technique was designed and implemented. It achieved a total Tx leakage cancellation of 69 dB at 2 GHz with 45 MHz duplexing frequency. However it was not possible to simultaneously cancel the transmitter noise in the receiver band. The original prototype was extended to include the second loop. The achieved isolation between the transmit and the receive signals and the achieved reduction of the transmitter noise in the receiver band were 66. 8 dB and 58 dB respectively. These results were obtained over 5 MHz bandwidth and using a 190 MHz duplexing frequency. The performance is more than adequate for W-CDMA applications. Lowering the duplexing frequency improves the cancellation bandwidth and so the scheme performs better with other standards, such as IS- 95 (CDMA), using 45 MHz duplexing offset...|$|R
