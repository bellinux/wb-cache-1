2500|$|The CR-4 is a low-wing {{monoplane}} {{with conventional}} landing gear. The construction is all-metal stressed skin. [...] The triangular wings featured a straight leading edge {{with a long}} chord tapering to a point at the wingtips. The left cowling held a combination oil tank and surface cooler. The seat and canopy adjusted up six inched in travel for {{take off and landing}} visibility. The landing gear used compressed air from a Lux <b>air</b> <b>bottle</b> rather than mechanical or hydraulic mechanism. Copper filings found later in the line, combined with wind resistance prevented on leg from locking.|$|E
5000|$|Hunt and Patrick Depailler, who {{was driving}} one of the six-wheeled Tyrrells, were dueling for top spot, with Depailler {{following}} Hunt's McLaren on the track, when the <b>air</b> <b>bottle</b> for the McLaren's compressor starter fell off and hit the Tyrrell's two left front wheels and the monocoque. Both wheels were broken, and even after stopping to replace them, Depailler's steering was out of line, and he could manage only seventh quickest. Later, as Hunt stood in the pits next to a four-foot, 150-pound <b>air</b> <b>bottle,</b> Rob Walker asked, [...] "Was that the one you threw at Depailler?" [...] James answered, [...] "No, we are keeping that one for Niki on Sunday!" ...|$|E
50|$|The {{engine was}} {{designed}} for simplicity and reliability, rather than sophisticated control. The pilot's only control was a simple on/off switch, with the valves and pump then controlled by an electromechanical timer. Power for actuating the main valves was then obtained by a compressed <b>air</b> <b>bottle</b> or fuel pressure.|$|E

50|$|A {{flamethrower}} section {{consisted of}} 4 soldiers: a commander, a gunner carrying the flamethrower and two carriers of fuel cans and spare <b>air</b> <b>bottles.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Type 10 is {{significantly}} {{smaller than the}} Type 1 and consequently has a much smaller warhead of 300 kg. The forward section of the weapon contains the warhead and the manual electric fuze, but no contact detonator unlike other kaiten types. The midsection contains {{the first set of}} Type 92 batteries as well as a steering <b>air</b> <b>bottle</b> strapped to the underneath of the weapon. The pilot's compartment contains firing, starting and gyroscope starting switches as well as a fixed periscope that could only be rotated but not raised or lowered, the rudder control, trim gauge and a sodium peroxide tin for air purification. The latter part of the weapon contained the remainder of the batteries and a small external steering <b>air</b> <b>bottle.</b> The control planes are identical to the Type 92 torpedo's other than having a manually operated rudder fitted.|$|E
50|$|Steinhorst has a {{volunteer}} fire-brigade. The number of active members amounted to, {{at the end}} of 2004, 29 members. The employment vehicle is an LF8 with a festinstallierten delete foam plant, which is pressurized by means of <b>air</b> <b>bottle</b> and is thus ready for use.The mayor of the municipality, Heinz-Peter Strunck, has been in office for 27 years.|$|E
50|$|The K-pattern {{flamethrower}} {{appeared a}} successful weapon, considering its primitive design {{and conditions of}} manufacturing. Its main flaw was that the air pressure decreased during operation so that successive bursts had a progressively shorter range. The weapon could be refueled by fuel carriers and the compressed <b>air</b> <b>bottle</b> replaced with a new one, in a procedure that took about 4 minutes.|$|E
25|$|The Air Unit {{provides}} {{service for}} firefighter SCBA equipment {{and also has}} a mobile air compressor truck to refill <b>air</b> <b>bottles</b> {{at the scene of}} a fire. This truck responds outside of Middletown to neighboring towns as requested.|$|R
2500|$|... 7:31p.m. – The first firefighters in the {{building}} have been breathing from their <b>air</b> <b>bottles</b> for approximately eighteen minutes and will soon run out of air. Conditions in the showroom continue to worsen while at least sixteen firefighters continue to work inside. Engine 3 is dispatched.|$|R
50|$|The storm allowed frigid <b>air</b> <b>bottled</b> up in much {{of western}} Canada and Alaska to flow south and overspread the United States, with sub-zero (°F) highs in the {{northern}} Plains. The colder air later reached {{the eastern half of}} the United States with much lesser impact.|$|R
50|$|Steering was {{accomplished}} by four rudders in a cruciform configuration. These were moved by four pairs of pneumatic servos, operated by solenoid valves. An <b>air</b> <b>bottle,</b> pressurized to , supplied air for the servos and also supplied the air that spun the three, air-blown gyroscopes in the missile's inertial navigation system. A high pressure air supply from the aircraft was also required to spin the gyros before the missile was launched.|$|E
50|$|Variometers {{measure the}} rate of change of {{altitude}} by detecting the change in air pressure (static pressure) as altitude changes. A simple variometer can be constructed by adding a large reservoir (a thermos bottle) to augment the storage capacity of a common aircraft rate-of-climb instrument. In its simplest electronic form, the instrument consists of an <b>air</b> <b>bottle</b> connected to the external atmosphere through a sensitive air flow meter. As the aircraft changes altitude, the atmospheric pressure outside the aircraft changes and air flows into or out of the <b>air</b> <b>bottle</b> to equalise the pressure inside the bottle and outside the aircraft. The rate and direction of flowing air is measured by the cooling of one of two self-heating thermistors and the difference between the thermistor resistances will cause a voltage difference; this is amplified and displayed to the pilot. The faster the aircraft is ascending (or descending), the faster the air flows. Air flowing out of the bottle indicates that the altitude of the aircraft is increasing. Air flowing into the bottle indicates that the aircraft is descending.|$|E
50|$|Newer {{variometer}} designs directly {{measure the}} static {{pressure of the}} atmosphere using a pressure sensor and detect changes in altitude directly from the change in air pressure instead of by measuring air flow. These designs tend to be smaller as {{they do not need}} the <b>air</b> <b>bottle.</b> They are more reliable as there is no bottle to be affected by changes in temperature and less chances for leaks to occur in the connecting tubes.|$|E

50|$|Fueling and Charging: Via {{the tank}} filler cap, 1,133 lbs (140 gallons) of petrol (B-Stoff) were added (later longer-range models held more). The twin spherical iron <b>air</b> <b>bottles</b> {{were charged with}} 900 psi air to power the {{automatic}} pilot (Steuergerät). Air at 90 psi powered the pneumatic servo-motors for the elevators and rudder.|$|R
50|$|Once {{the target}} was {{acquired}} and the host submarine was within range the pilot was briefed, the Kaiten's starting <b>air</b> <b>bottles</b> were charged and the cockpit was ventilated. The pilot then entered the vessel, the gyroscope was programmed with the correct bearing and depth and the pilot was given his final briefing.|$|R

50|$|The {{main parts}} of the {{flamethrower}} were two steel cylindrical tanks connected with each other, one for fuel (15 l capacity total, height 45 cm, diameter 16 cm) and a compressed <b>air</b> <b>bottle</b> (6 l, height 60 cm, diameter 12 cm). This tank assembly was fitted with straps to permit it to be carried on the operator's back. Fuel {{was a mixture of}} diesel fuel (75%) and gasoline (25%). There was a valve between the fuel and air tanks. A rubber fuel hose connected the assembly with a fuel gun, which was a pipe 114-cm long, fitted with a valve at the muzzle, operated with a handle.|$|E
50|$|The {{tanks were}} air pressurised, {{the fuel tank}} by engine {{compressor}} bleed air and the oxidiser tank by ram air and additionally by the stored <b>air</b> <b>bottle.</b> Ram air {{was taken from the}} supersonic inlet boundary layer bleeds. A single timer-controlled valve opened the stored air supply which then opened the pneumatic LP cocks. A second valve, after a delay, engaged the turbopump clutch. HP cocks were opened by a single hydraulic piston, driven by fuel pressure controlled through a third timed valve. Both fuel and oxidiser first flowed through a small pilot valve for ignition, before their main valves opened. Correct opening of all four valves was monitored by the timer control, to ensure a safe mixture.|$|E

50|$|A {{light and}} air unit, {{also known as}} a {{breathing}} support unit, is a specialized piece of firefighting apparatus used by firefighters to provide supplemental lighting and SCBA <b>air</b> <b>bottles</b> at the scene of an emergency. During prolonged emergencies, particularly structure fires, where firefighters must remain on air (wearing their SCBAs), these <b>air</b> <b>bottles</b> will need to be replaced and refilled. The light and air unit has the ability to refill the SCBA bottles while in the field using onboard air compressors. It also carries a supply of spare air cylinders. These units are highly customizable and can vary greatly between departments. These multifunctional units are also equipped with diesel generators which supplies electricity to power portable lights and overall scene illumination. This is usually done via a roof mounted telescoping light bank. The unit also has the ability to supply electrical power in an emergency to a shelter, base camp, or medical facility.|$|R
50|$|In 1989, B-427 was {{returning}} to Vladivostok from Vietnam when it ran into a typhoon. A mechanical breakdown {{that could not be}} fixed in time prevented the sub from diving. The storm battered the boat, destroying the light hull and damaging the ballast tanks and high pressure <b>air</b> <b>bottles.</b> B-427 was taken back to Vladivostok where it was repaired and refitted with a new light hull.|$|R
50|$|The Type 93 torpedo {{formed the}} {{majority}} of this model of Kaiten with the only alterations being the warhead yield being increased from 490 kg and the control planes enlarged and altered to allow both gyroscope and pilot control. Between the torpedo warhead and the engine section is the torpedo compressed air flask, 6 (or 8 in later models) steering air bottles and the forward trim tank, followed by the control area and the pilot's seat. In later models the 5.5 L Tetrachloromethane starting <b>air</b> <b>bottle</b> {{is located in the}} cockpit and a further smaller trimming tank is supplied for use at initial launch. The engine section is slotted in above the aft trim tank with the joint protected by a sheet metal cowl.|$|E
50|$|In {{a liquid}} fuel ramjet (LFRJ), {{hydrocarbon}} fuel (typically) is {{injected into the}} combustor ahead of a flameholder which stabilises the flame resulting from the combustion of the fuel with the compressed air from the intake(s). A means of pressurizing and supplying the fuel to the ramcombustor is required, which can be complicated and expensive. Aérospatiale-Celerg designed an LFRJ where the fuel is forced into the injectors by an elastomer bladder which inflates progressively {{along the length of}} the fuel tank. Initially, the bladder forms a close-fitting sheath around the compressed <b>air</b> <b>bottle</b> from which it is inflated, which is mounted lengthwise in the tank. This offers a lower-cost approach than a regulated LFRJ requiring a turbopump and associated hardware to supply the fuel.|$|E
50|$|To reach higher altitudes, a {{pressurized}} cockpit {{was added}} to the H models. The canopy was sealed via a circular tube filled with rubber foam which was inflated by a compressed <b>air</b> <b>bottle,</b> while the engine compartment was also sealed from the cockpit with a rubber foam ring. A Knorr 300/10 air compressor provided the pressure, maintaining the cockpit at 0.36 atmospheres (5.29 psi) above 8,000 m (26,250 ft). To prevent fogging, the windscreen was of a double-glazed style with a 6 mm (.236 in) thick outer pane and a 3 mm (.118 in) inner pane with a 6 mm (.24 in) gap. The gap was fitted with several silica gel capsules to absorb any moisture forming between the panes. The cockpit was not pressurized in the C models.|$|E
50|$|The {{supercharged}} engine {{may be the}} Vedeneyev M14P (standard production line version), M14PF or M14R, producing between 360 and 450 hp and driving the propeller via a reduction gearbox. The landing gear, brakes and engine starter are operated by compressed air. Replenished by an engine-driven compressor, the main and emergency <b>air</b> <b>bottles</b> are contained within the forward fuselage between the firewall and fuel tanks.|$|R
50|$|Beginning on January 2, 2014, sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) {{led to the}} {{breakdown}} of the semi-permanent feature across the Arctic known as the polar vortex. Without an active upper-level vortex to keep frigid <b>air</b> <b>bottled</b> up across the Arctic, the cold air mass was forced southward as upper-level warming displaced the jet stream. With extensive snow-cover across Canada and Siberia, Arctic air had no trouble remaining extremely cold as it was forced southward into the United States.|$|R
50|$|Blown bottles {{generate}} sound by {{utilizing a}} vibrating column of <b>air.</b> The <b>bottles</b> may be tuned by adding water or sand to the vessel.|$|R
50|$|Firefighting {{equipment}} in the United States is based on lightweight materials developed for the U.S. Space Program. NASA and the National Bureau of Standards created a lightweight breathing system including face mask, frame, harness, and <b>air</b> <b>bottle,</b> using an aluminum composite material developed by NASA for use on rocket casings. The broadest fire-related technology transfer is the breathing apparatus for protection from smoke inhalation injury. Additionally, NASA’s inductorless electronic circuit technology led to lower-cost, more rugged, short-range two-way radio now used by firefighters. NASA also helped develop a specialized mask weighing less than 3 oz to protect the physically impaired from injuries to the face and head, as well as flexible, heat-resistant materials—developed to protect the space shuttle on reentry—which are being used both by the military and commercially in suits for municipal and aircraft-rescue firefighters.|$|E
50|$|The Yak-52, {{like most}} Soviet {{military}} aircraft, {{was designed to}} operate in rugged environments with minimal maintenance. One of its key features, unusual in western aircraft, is its extensive pneumatic system. Engine starting, landing gear, flaps, and wheel brakes are all pneumatically actuated. Spherical storage bottles for air, replenished by an engine driven compressor, are situated behind the rear cockpit and contents displayed on the instrument panels. The operating pressure is between 10 and 50 bars (145 and 725 psi) and an emergency circuit is reserved for lowering the undercarriage if the normal supply is exhausted or the compressor fails. Additionally both main and reserve bottles can be charged from a port {{on the ground with}} compressed air, usually from a Scuba type <b>air</b> <b>bottle.</b> The ground steering/braking arrangement, especially, takes some adjustment for flyers accustomed to hydraulics, because the aircraft uses differential braking controlled by rudder pedals and a hand operated lever on the control stick.|$|E
50|$|The D.520 had a fire {{suppression}} system with a fire extinguisher activated from the cockpit. The engine was started by a simple but effective system, operating with compressed air. A Viet 250 air compressor charged several air bottles (one with a 12-litre capacity, as well as another eight litre tank, three smaller one litre units were matched to the weapons). The 12 litre <b>air</b> <b>bottle</b> {{was used for the}} brakes and later, for the Chauvière propeller's constant speed adjustment. The small air bottles provided up to 12 seconds at 9000 m or 20 seconds at low level, before the Viet air compressor recharged them. The pilot had a complete set of cockpit instruments, and a ten-litre oxygen bottle located in the fuselage just behind his seat, with either a Munerelle or Gourdou oxygen regulator system mounted on the right instrument panel. Equipment included a Radio Industrie Type Rl 537 radio-receiver set, an OPL RX 39 reflector sight (less effective than the Revi system), a height-adjustable seat, and a sliding canopy with large, clear panels. Except over the long nose, the pilot's view was good, since he was seated quite high over the forward fuselage; however, no rear-facing mirrors were fitted.|$|E
2500|$|Progress was {{typically}} by [...] "bottom walking", {{as this was}} considered less dangerous than swimming (note the absence of buoyancy controls). The use of oxygen put a depth limit on the dive, which was considerably mitigated by the extended dive duration. This was the normal diving equipment and methods until approximately 1960 when new techniques using wetsuits (which provide both insulation and buoyancy [...] ), twin open-circuit SCUBA air systems the development of side mounting cylinders, helmet-mounted lights and free-swimming with fins. The increasing capacity and pressure rating of <b>air</b> <b>bottles</b> also extended dive durations.|$|R
50|$|The {{team also}} {{supports}} local fire departments {{and law enforcement}} agencies by providing scene security details, perimeter control, traffic management, operational help (controlling hose lines, changing <b>air</b> <b>bottles,</b> etc.), evidence searching, and other non-hazardous services. Members frequently ride with Arapahoe County Sheriff's Office deputies, Littleton Police Department officers, and Littleton Fire Rescue personnel to assist with their daily operations. The Arapahoe Rescue Patrol is the designated light-duty rescue agency for the City of Littleton. All funding is provided by private donors. The Arapahoe Rescue Patrol is a non-profit 501 (c) (3) corporation and does not charge for its services.|$|R
