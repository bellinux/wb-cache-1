25|$|The diver {{needs to}} stay on the bottom to work some of the time, and may need to have neutral {{buoyancy}} some of the time. The diving suit is usually buoyant, so added weight is usually necessary. This can be provided in several ways. Unwanted positive buoyancy is dangerous to a diver who may need to spend significant time decompressing during the ascent, so the weights are usually attached securely to prevent <b>accidental</b> <b>loss.</b>|$|E

25|$|Nevertheless, {{in order}} to be fully {{compliant}} with the SDXC card specification, many SDXC-capable host devices are firmware-programmed to expect exFAT on cards larger than 32GB. Consequently, they may not accept SDXC cards reformatted as FAT32, even if the device supports FAT32 on smaller cards (for SDHC compatibility). Therefore, even if a file system is supported in general, it is not always possible to use alternative file systems on SDXC cards at all depending on how strictly the SDXC card specification has been implemented in the host device. This bears a risk of <b>accidental</b> <b>loss</b> of data, as a host device may treat a card with an unrecognized file system as blank or damaged and reformat the card.|$|E
25|$|Once in Chile {{the crew}} had serious {{difficulties}} with the generation of hydrogen, due to the <b>accidental</b> <b>loss</b> {{of most of the}} sulfuric acid imported from Argentina. Bradley decided to resort to coal gas, produced in Chile and readily available, with a high percentage of hydrogen. The odyssey would have been impossible without the cooperation of Chilean authorities, who responded more favorably to Bradley's request for support than did officials in his native Argentina. The crossing of the Andes on an aerostat filled with coal gas was finally accomplished on June 24, 1916. At an altitude of 8,100m, the temperature dropped to -30°C. The adventure lasted {{three and a half hours}} from the moment of liftoff in Santiago to the landing in Cerro de la Cepa, Uspallata, Mendoza, Argentina. Bradley and Zuloaga were welcomed in Argentina as national heroes.|$|E
25|$|Until the 1970s, when older-design revolvers such as Colt Single Action Armys and Ruger Blackhawks were {{re-engineered}} with drop safeties (such as {{firing pin}} blocks, hammer blocks, or transfer bars) that prevent {{the firing pin}} from contacting the cartridge's primer unless the trigger is pulled, safe carry required the hammer being positioned over an empty chamber, reducing the available cartridges from six to five, or, on some models, in between chambers on either a pin or in a groove for that purpose, thus keeping the full six rounds available. This kept the uncocked hammer from resting directly on the primer of a cartridge. If not used in this manner, the hammer rests directly on a primer and unintentional firing may occur if the gun is dropped or the hammer is struck. Some holster makers provided a thick leather thong to place underneath the hammer that both allowed the carry of a gun fully loaded with all six rounds and secured the {{gun in the holster}} to help prevent its <b>accidental</b> <b>loss.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{dissertation}} thesis {{deals with}} the problem of relevant volume of natural shrinkage and <b>accidental</b> <b>losses</b> of retail stock quota calculation. In frame of the dissertation thesis, factors affecting an extent of accidental shortage of inventories in retail business are investigated here. Then, possible approaches to a calculation of relevant volume of such a quota are recognized as well. By its scope, the dissertation thesis reacts on a problem that exists within the income taxes law since 1995, but any conceptual solution of this problem is still missing. This current problem that is felt especially in retail business is right the problem of relevant volume of a quota of natural shrinkage and accidental loses calculation. The dissertation thesis is based on wide research that has been done in both, in retail businesses and on the side of tax administration too. On the basis of this research’s outcomes, the main factors affecting an extent of <b>accidental</b> <b>losses</b> of retail stock have been determined. Then these factors and evaluation of their influence became construction elements of two mathematic models for the calculation of relevant volume of a quota of natural shrinkage and <b>accidental</b> <b>losses</b> of inventories in retail business. These models are the model that is based on the statistic method of multiple regression and the model based on the fuzzy logic, respectively on the fuzzy mathematics. For the conclusion of the dissertation thesis, both models are discussed from the point of their relevance {{as well as from the}} view of their practical application. Theoretical and practical contributions of the dissertation thesis are also concluded here along with an outline of possible future research in this area...|$|R

40|$|AbstractLosses in {{the amount}} of timber, {{especially}} the accidental ones, are a long-term issue for both the forestry public and forest owners. The objective determination of <b>accidental</b> <b>losses</b> – the natural decreases in amount, has always been an important factor for determining the liability of employees for any damage caused to the forest owner or for the loss {{in the amount}} of timber. The paper focuses on the issue of losses {{in the amount of}} produced and sold timber and the issue of differences in the amount of sold timber arising due to different methods of ascertaining the amount of timber for accounting and tax purposes. The aim of the paper is to define the specifics of losses in the untreated timber and the specifics of differences occurring during the transfer of the timber's ownership in business relations. Furthermore, it was also analyzed the current situation in timber accounting and tax records and were proposed possibilities of solving this problem.

I should not have failed to give you immediately any information upon this subject which could be of use; but in fact, though I began to publish in a newspaper, viz. the 'Courier, an <b>accidental</b> <b>loss</b> {{of two or three}} sheets of the manuscript prevented me from going on in that mode of publication after two sections had appeared. The Pamphlet will be out in less than a fortnight, entitled, at full length, 'Concerning the relations of Great Britain, Spain, and Portugal, to each other, and to the common enemy at this crisis, and specifically as affected by the Convention of Cintra; the whole brought to the test of those principles by which alone the independence and freedom of nations can be preserved or recovered.' This is less a Title than a Table of Contents. I give it you at full length in order that you may set your fancy at work (if you have no better employment for it) upon what the Pamphlet may contain. I sent off the last sheets only a day or two since, else I should have written to you sooner; it having been my intention to pay my debt to you the moment I had discharged this debt to my country. What I have written has been done according to the best light of my conscience: it is indeed very imperfect, and will, I fear, be little read; but if it is read, cannot, I hope, fail of doing some good; though I am aware it will create me a world of enemies, and call forth the old yell of Jacobinism. I have not sent it to any personal friends as such, therefore I have made no exception in your case. I have ordered it to be sent to two, the Spanish and Portuguese Ambassadors, and three or four other public men and Members of Parliament, but to nobody of my friends and relations. It is printed with my name, and, I believe, will be published by Longman.... I am very happy that you have not been inattentive to my suggestion on the subject of Topography. When I ventured to recommend the pursuit to you, I did not for a moment suppose that it was to interfere with your appropriate duties as a parish priest; far otherwise: but I know you are of an active mind, and I am sure that a portion of your time might be thus employed without any deduction from that which was due to your professional engagements. It would be a recreation to you; and also it does appear to me that records of this kind ought to be executed by somebody or other, both for the instruction of those now living {{and for the sake of}} posterity; and if so, the duty devolves more naturally upon clergymen than upon other persons, as their opportunities and qualifications are both likely to be better than those of other men.
