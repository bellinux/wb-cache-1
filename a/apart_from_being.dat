5|$|The Swedbank Stadion, {{often called}} Stadion, is a {{football}} stadium in Malmö, Sweden {{and the home}} of Allsvenskan club Malmö Fotbollförening, commonly known as Malmö FF. In UEFA competitions, the stadium is known as Malmö New Stadium for sponsorship reasons. The stadium is named after Swedish based banking group Swedbank, which owns its naming rights. <b>Apart</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> the home of Malmö FF, Swedbank Stadion has also hosted senior and youth international matches.|$|E
5|$|<b>Apart</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> {{a capable}} passer, Lin has {{established}} himself as a strong, fast-paced offensive player who attacks the basket and excels at the pick-and-roll. He improved his outside shooting from early in his career, and became a threat from three-point range. He has also been considered difficult to defend at times because of his ability to get to the free-throw line. An admitted risk taker, he has been criticized for his tendency to commit turnovers, as well as his perceived lack of effectiveness on defense.|$|E

Since the late 1990s, it has undergone a transformation from a modest Scandinavian capital into a metropolitan city of international appeal {{in the same league}} as Barcelona and Amsterdam. This is a result of huge investments in infrastructure and culture as well as the work of successful new Danish architects, designers and chefs. Copenhagen Fashion Week, the largest fashion event in Northern Europe, takes place every year in February and August.|$|E

Ljotić's father was forced out of the country in 1868 after being implicated in a {{conspiracy}} against the Obrenović dynasty and its head, Prince Milan. He did not return to Serbia until Milan's abdication on 6 March 1889. <b>Apart</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> a close friend of Serbia's future king, Peter I, Ljotić's father was also the first person to translate The Communist Manifesto into Serbian.

5|$|<b>Apart</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> an {{obligatory}} religious duty, the Hajj {{is seen to}} have {{a spiritual}} merit that provides the Muslims with an opportunity of self-renewal. Hajj serves {{as a reminder of}} the Day of Judgment when Muslims believe people will stand before God. Hadith literature (sayings of Muhammad) articulates various merits a pilgrim achieves upon successful completion of their Hajj. After successful pilgrimage, pilgrims can prefix their names with the title 'Al-Hajji', and are held with respect in Muslim society. However, Islamic scholars suggest Hajj should signify a Muslim's religious commitment, and should not be a measurement of their social status. Hajj brings together and unites the Muslims from {{different parts of the world}} irrespective of their race, colour, and culture, which acts as a symbol of equality.|$|E

5|$|Located at {{the highest}} point of the Municipality lies El Volcan, a small {{mountain}} of about 1500 meters from sea level. This mountain has a Downhill course that has about 500 meters of vertical drop, it is used by hundreds of riders a day during dry and wet weather, mostly on weekends. The course {{is open to the}} public and riding is neither specifically allowed nor prohibited by law. The trails are also used by hikers all week long. Shuttles are about 10 Venezuelan bolivars per trip, they run from the parking lot of a Farmatodo drug store in La Boyera, up to the summit using public avenues and paved roads, taking from 15 minutes to 30 minutes depending on traffic on the area. The course <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> used mostly for recreational purpose, also has been used for irregularly scheduled downhill races due to the lack of organisation in the riders community.|$|E
5|$|Nowitzki is {{the sixth}} player in NBA history, {{and the first}} European, to hit the 30,000-point milestone. <b>Apart</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> the Mavericks' all-time leader in points, rebounds, field goals, field goal attempts, 3-pointers, 3-point attempts, free throws, and free-throw attempts, Nowitzki has made the NBA All-Star games {{thirteen}} times and the All-NBA Teams twelve times.

5|$|Subfossil {{remains of}} the King Island emu show that the tibia was about 330mm (13in) long, and the femur was 180mm (7in) long. The pelvis was 280mm (11in) long, 64mm (2.5in) wide at the front, and 86mm (3in) wide at the back. The tarsometatarsus {{averaged}} 232mm (9in) in length. In males, the tibiotarsus averaged 261mm (10in), whereas it averaged 301mm (12in) in females. In contrast, the same bones measured 269mm (10.5in) and 305mm (12in) in the Kangaroo Island emu. <b>Apart</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> smaller, the King Island emu differed osteologically from the Kangaroo Island emu in the intertrochlear foramen of the tarsometatarsus usually being fully or partially abridged. The outer trochlea was more incurved towards the middle trochlea in the Kangaroo Island bird, whereas they were parallel in the King Island emu.|$|E

5|$|Thorpe and the Liberals were {{deflated}} by {{the outcome}} of the October 1974 election. Wilson's majority, albeit slim, denied Thorpe the role of kingmaker, leaving the Liberals without a clear role; as Dutton observes, <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> neither Conservative or Labour, the Liberals lacked a distinctive identity and their policies were largely unknown to the public. A further problem for the party was the divergence between its activists, who were radicals well {{to the left of the}} official party, and a large section of its recent supporters who were disgruntled Conservatives. Thorpe, whose personal majority in North Devon had fallen to under 7,000 in October, confided to an associate that, unless the party were soon to make a significant impact, his days as leader might be numbered.|$|E
5|$|After Zappas's death, and wholly {{due to the}} Greek {{government}} ignoring Zappas's {{instructions to}} refurbish the stadium in marble, {{it was necessary to}} refurbish the Panathenian stadium a second time, replacing wood for marble, in readiness for the Athens 1896 Olympic Games. After a period of litigation over Zappas's bequests, his cousin Konstantinos Zappas continued and expanded his endowment of the Games and maintained efforts for the continuation of the Olympic concept. In 1870, the new stadium, with a spectator capacity of 30,000, was ready to host the second Olympiad. The Olympic Games of 1870, <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> the first modern international Olympic Games to be hosted in a stadium, were better attended and hosted more events and athletes, and were much better organized in general. Additionally, the first modern Olympic building was built to support the contests (and hosted the fencing events of 1896), as well as an industrial exhibition that anti-athletic members of the Greek government had forced upon the concept of the Games. This building, located near the city's National Garden, was entirely funded by Zappas's legacy and was named Zappeion after him. The Zappeion officially opened on 20 October 1888.|$|E
5|$|<b>Apart</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> a close {{relative}} to the red rail, the relationships of the Rodrigues rail are uncertain and the two are commonly listed as separate genera, Aphanapteryx and Erythromachus, but have sometimes been united as species of Aphanapteryx. Günther and E. Newton first generically synonymised the two in 1879 because of their skeletal similarities. In 1945, the French palaeontologist Jean Piveteau found skull features of the two species different enough for generic separation, and in 1977, the American ornithologist Storrs L. Olson stated that though the two species were similar and derived from the same stock, they had also diverged considerably, and should possibly be kept separate. Based on geographic location and the morphology of the nasal bones, Olson suggested that they {{were related to the}} genera Gallirallus, Dryolimnas, Atlantisia, and Rallus. Mourer-Chauviré and colleagues also considered the two as belonging to separate genera. Rails have reached many oceanic archipelagos, which has frequently led to speciation and evolution of flightlessness. According to the British researchers Anthony S. Cheke and Julian P. Hume, the fact that the red rail lost much of its feather structure indicates it was isolated for a long time. These rails may be of Asian origin, like many other Mascarene birds.|$|E

Despite having been raised in a Jewish faith and unfamiliar with Christmas songs, Kurstin still agreed to produce the project. As a result, the record marked the second time her studio album only had a single producer (the first being David Kahne solely producing My December in 2007). It also marked the fourth time Kurstin had solely produced an entire studio album <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> a member of the musical groups The Bird and the Bee and Geggy Tah (the first three being Lily Allen's It's Not Me, It's You in 2009, Sia's We Are Born in 2010, and The Shins' Port of Morrow in 2012).|$|E
5|$|The largest {{stand at}} Turf Moor is the James Hargreaves Stand, which was opened in 1996 {{as part of}} a ground {{redevelopment}} project which saw two new stands built to replace the Longside and the Bee Hole End at a total cost of £5.3 million. When built it was named the North Stand, although it has its current name thanks to a six-figure sponsorship deal. The stand can accommodate 8,512 (+192 Corporate seats) spectators and was opened on 23 April 1996, replacing the Longside terrace. It runs parallel to the length of the pitch. The television gantry is located in the James Hargreaves Stand along with the media area, which is situated {{at the rear of the}} upper tier. The stand is the traditional seating area of the Suicide Squad, who had previously stood in the Longside until the terrace was demolished in 1995. In the space between the upper and lower tiers of the James Hargreaves Stand there is a corporate area, which <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> used for matchday hospitality is used for functions and events.

5|$|Buddhist traditions provide {{detailed}} {{descriptions of}} how this transfer proceeds. Transferring merit to another person, usually deceased relatives, is simply done by a mental wish. Despite the word transfer, the merit of the giver {{is in no way}} decreased during such an act, just like a candle used to light another candle does not diminish. The merit transferred cannot always be received, however. The dead relatives must also be able to sympathize with the meritorious act. If the relatives do not receive the merit, the act of transferring merit will still be beneficial for the giver himself. The transfer of merit is thus connected with the idea of rejoicing. The other person who rejoices in one's meritorious deeds, in that way also receives merit, if he approves of the merit done. Thus, rejoicing in others' merits, <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> one of the ten meritorious acts mentioned, is also a prerequisite for the transferring of merit to occur. The purposes for merit transfer differ. In many Buddhist countries, transferring merit is connected to the notion of an intermediate state. The merit that is transferred to the deceased will help them to cross over safely to the next rebirth. Some Mahāyāna traditions believe that it can help deceased relatives to attain the Pure Land. Another way of transferring merit, apart from helping the deceased, is to dedicate it to the devas (deities), since it is believed that these are not able to make merits themselves. In this way it is believed their favor can be obtained. Finally, many Buddhists transfer merits to resolve a bond of revenge that may exist between people, as it is believed that someone else's vengefulness may create harm in one's life.|$|E
