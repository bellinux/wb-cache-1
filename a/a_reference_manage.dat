One of the best Bosnian old-growth {{is located in the}} forest of Lom where a Forest reserve of 278 ha was established in 1956. Inside this reserve, 1 ha long-term intensive monitoring plot was established in 2005 to investigate the origin, spatio-temporal development and disturbance history of the stand. Structural characteristics of the stand were than compared with other Bosnian old-growth and with two well-preserved Italian forests belonging to the same forest type. The permanent plot is very rich in living biomass (1158 m 3 ha- 1) and in coarse woody debris (383 m 3 ha- 1 approximately 33 % of living trees). The oldest trees are more than 450 years old. The stand has developed without large-scale disturbances and, according to data coming from other Bosnian old-growth, appears to be highly stable.

By emulating historical disturbance processes, {{it is thought that}} forest management can produce forest composition and structure similar to the conditions that once supported the native biota. A recent project was designed to integrate social and ecological findings to investigate the important relationships between the state of ecological understanding of a region, the state of the region&# 8217;s biodiversity, and the state of the region&# 8217;s social understanding of how it might be managed for biodiversity conservation into the future. The project relied on established concepts of {{the historical}} range of variability (HRV) and developed the concept of the social range of variability to help explain the interaction of social and ecological assessments, particularly their interaction to create future ranges of variability. The Oregon Coast Range, where a rich history of HRV research has been completed starting with paleoecological reconstructions of the historical fire regime, was one of five sites in the United States that were selected as case studies. We found land development and impending climate change to be major hurdles impeding the use of the HRV as a management regime. We also found that the complexities and uncertainties of management preclude the use of any single tool to tackle landscape-scale challenges and suggest that land management needs to become a continuous process of negotiation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{quality of}} data is a {{critical}} factor {{for all kinds of}} decision-making and transaction processing. While {{there has been a lot}} of research on data quality in the past two decades, the topic has not yet received sufficient attention from the Semantic Web community. In this paper, we discuss (1) the data quality issues related to the growing amount of data available on the Semantic Web, (2) how data quality problems can be handled within the Semantic Web technology framework, namely using SPARQL on RDF representations, and (3) how Semantic Web reference data, e. g. from DBPedia, can be used to spot incorrect literal values and functional dependency violations. We show how this approach can be used for data quality management of public Semantic Web data and data stored in relational databases in closed settings alike. As part of our work, we developed generic SPARQL queries to identify (1) missing datatype properties or literal values, (2) illegal values, and (3) functional dependency violations. We argue that using Semantic Web datasets reduces the effort for data quality management substantially. As a use-case, we employ Geonames, a publicly available Semantic Web resource for geographical data, as <b>a</b> trusted <b>reference</b> for <b>managing</b> the quality of other data sources...|$|R

40|$|Parasite {{community}} structure {{can change}} seasonally with shifts in host habitat and in diet. However, anthropogenic activity {{may influence the}} natural changes in transmission dynamics of different parasite species. Effects of seasonal and agricultural activity on the parasite communities of newly metamorphosed northern leopard frogs (Rana pipiens) were investigated in July and September 2001 in 5 wetlands, 3 of which were exposed to pesticide runoff from surrounding agriculture. Nineteen parasite taxa were found. Component community richness was consistently high at the pristine reference wetland, whereas the communities at <b>a</b> <b>managed</b> <b>reference</b> wetland remained depauperate. Infracommunity richness increased throughout the season, but more so in frogs resident in agricultural wetlands. Digeneans using frogs as intermediate hosts dominated the communities, although many species were much lower in abundance in September, suggesting mortality of heavily infected frogs. Mean abundance of Haematoloechus spp. {{was positively related to}} that of odonate naiads in the frog diet, which appeared to reflect differential second intermediate host availability between reference and agricultural wetlands. Although virtually absent from wetlands in July just after frog metamorphosis, monoxenous nematodes were more prevalent and abundant at agricultural wetlands as the season progressed.

40|$|The EPA has {{developed}} a free-piston engine (FPE) and a hydraulic linear engine (HLE) for application as hydraulic power plants in a hydraulic hybrid vehicle. Both engines extract power from the piston motion using a linear hydraulic pump. This dissertation's objective is to compare HLE and FPE performance trends through modeling while developing the control tools necessary to enable reliable engine operation. A physics-based engine model combines dynamics, thermodynamics, and hydraulics correlations to evaluate performance trends and assist with control development. Preliminary simulations show that asymmetric piston behavior causes variations in cylinder-to-cylinder HLE efficiency that necessitate cylinder balancing. An adaptive control scheme estimates and adjusts for HLE cylinder performance discrepancies. A control-oriented model captures HLE behavior using an estimate of rotational kinetic energy sampled at the turnaround points. State feedback control ensures that the HLE tracks a set point and a recursive least squares algorithm estimates periodic differences in HLE response. An extremum seeking algorithm exploits the adaptive scheme to optimize injection timing of each cylinder individually. Precise control of piston turnaround location is paramount to reliable FPE operation. Combining an energy balance and the Otto cycle, a control-oriented model implicitly describes FPE clearance height evolution. A linearization of the control-oriented model suggests open-loop unstable operating conditions at high load. State feedback using dynamic inversion stabilizes the FPE system. In order to constrain piston motion, <b>a</b> <b>reference</b> governor <b>manages</b> load changes. When implemented on the physics-based model with the feedback control law, the reference governor successfully enforces a position constraint of 0. 5 mm. Using the proposed control and modeling methods, a series of physics-based simulations explore HLE, FPE, and conventional engine performance. The primary difference in engine behavior is friction. While the FPE exhibits low frictional losses and the highest relative hydraulic conversion efficiency, it also suffers from a restricted power range compared to the HLE and the conventional engine due to engine speed limitations. The HLE has lower friction than the conventional engine at most operating conditions. However, inertial forces resulting from a large piston assembly mass increase HLE bearing loads and friction at high speeds...|$|R

We characterized historical ecosystem diversity using available empirical data, expert opinion, and the spatially explicit vegetation dynamics model SIMPPLLE (SIMulating Vegetative Patterns and Processes at Landscape ScaLEs) for {{a landscape of}} approximately 946, 000 ac in eastern Wyoming. We used SIMPPLLE to simulate plant community dynamics {{as a result of}} historical disturbance events (for example, fire, bison grazing, and prairie dog activity), climate, and landscape elements (for example, ecological site, proximity to water, and elevation) and their interactions to derive estimates of the historical range of variability for each grass/shrub ecosystem. For each NRCS designated ecological site we defined the historical states that occurred in the presence of grazing by native herbivores and fire, and identified the processes for movements among states within each site. For each historically occurring state within the delineated landscape we determined the mean ac it occupied and the range of variability (in other words, minimum and maximum ac a state occupied). Comparisons of historical grass/shrub ecosystem diversity of the area with existing conditions indicate that there have been significant changes, most notably the lack of representation of ecosystems dominated by grass species that typically decrease with grazing, the widespread presence of introduced species especially annual brome, and alterations to fire regimes. Through comparisons of historical ecosystem diversity with existing conditions, we identified specific plant communities that are underrepresented and in need of restoration to maintain ecosystem diversity and wildlife habitat...|$|R

Objective: This study aimed to define a spatial position of the cochlea in the skull based on anatomical studies and to design an appropriate method of skull radiography for demonstration of the multichannel intracochlear electrode array and the structures of the inner ear, for use in evaluating the electrode position and its related pitch perception. Background: The conventional skull radiograph (plain radiograph) can offer a complete and direct image of an intracochlear electrode array, if the x-ray is directed to the cochlea and parallel to the axis of the cochlea. Methods: Measurement from computed tomography imaging and three-dimensional reconstruction were performed to define the spatial position of the cochlea in the skull. Results: A radiographic projection, the cochlear view, was designed. A detailed radiographic method and radiologic interpretation of the cochlear view is described. An improved clinical method for measuring the longitudinal and angular position of the electrodes from the cochlear view is recommended. Conclusions: The application of the cochlear view has proved that it is beneficial postoperatively in documenting the results of cochlear implantation, and in evaluating the depth of insertion and position of individual electrodes.
