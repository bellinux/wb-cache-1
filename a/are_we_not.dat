500|$|Writers have labeled The Age of Plastic as {{the first}} {{landmark}} of another electropop era. In his book <b>Are</b> <b>We</b> <b>Not</b> New Wave?: Modern Pop at the Turn of the 1980s, Theo Cateforis wrote that the album's title and the songs [...] "I Love You (Miss Robot)" [...] and [...] "Astroboy" [...] "picture {{the arrival of the}} 1980s as a novelty era of playful futurism". In a 1979 interview, Downes defined the album as [...] "science fiction music. It's like modern psychedelic music. It's very futuristic." [...] Writers have described it as a mixture of synthpop and new wave music, with elements of disco, punk, progressive rock and pop music from the 1960s. The music on the album was also influenced by groups such as 10cc, ELO and Kraftwerk.|$|E
