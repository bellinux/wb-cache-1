5|$|No {{matter which}} side of the debate the experts are on, they <b>all</b> <b>agree</b> on one thing: All forms of custody work best with good {{communication}} and a willingness for the parents to work and to shield children from being involved in their parents' disputes.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{scientific}} investigations support Waitt’s proposed {{separation of}} layers into records of sequential flood events. Although the various sources support temporal separation of floods, {{they do not}} definitively identify the source of water {{for all of the}} floods, though they <b>all</b> <b>agree</b> that Lake Missoula was source for at least some of them.|$|E
5|$|The {{paper was}} founded by a Huguenot family, the de la Fonts, and passed {{into the hands of}} another Huguenot family, the Luzacs, in 1738. Sources vary on the exact date it was founded, {{suggesting}} 1660, 1667 1669 or 1680; they <b>all</b> <b>agree</b> the publication continued to 1798 (or 1811 under a different name).|$|E

5|$|Historians hold differing {{views as}} to whether the mounted police were neutral in these {{disputes}} or sided with the employers, although <b>all</b> <b>agree</b> that the position of the police in managing the strikes became more difficult as organised labour became better established. The mounted police disliked labour agitators and strikers with eastern or southern European backgrounds, but they also had some sympathy for the difficulties faced by ordinary workers, and were often unwilling to actively assist the company owners if there was a risk it might cause disturbances to break out.|$|E
5|$|Jack {{orders the}} {{survivors}} to abandon ship, but Elizabeth, realizing the Kraken only wants Jack, tricks him and chains {{him to the}} mast so that the crew can escape. The Kraken drags Jack and the Pearl to Davy Jones' Locker. Jones opens the chest to discover the heart is gone. In Port Royal, Norrington gives Beckett {{the heart and the}} Letters of Marque meant for Jack, allowing him back into the navy as well as allowing Beckett to gain control of Davy Jones and the seas. The Pearls crew take shelter with Tia Dalma, where they <b>all</b> <b>agree</b> to rescue Jack. Tia Dalma introduces the captain that will guide them: the resurrected Captain Barbossa.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{differ on}} the exact cause and extent of the {{massacre}} in Maribor. <b>All</b> <b>agree</b> that on 27 January 1919, the Coolidge Mission's delegation, led by Sherman Miles, visited Maribor and found thousands of citizens of German ethnic origin gathered in the main city square and waving flags of German Austria, many of which also decorated nearby buildings. German Austrian sources indicate that there were 10,000 protesters singing songs and wearing patriotic dress. Twenty soldiers under Maister's command were stationed {{in front of the}} city hall, armed with rifles mounted with bayonets.|$|E

5|$|Stymied, Black {{and fellow}} Group member Lara Means (Kristen Cloke) {{investigate}} the ship, finding several bodies {{hidden in a}} crate, all having died of exposure. Black then interviews Law and his crew individually, each time being given a contradicting {{story of how the}} woman came to be on board the ship. However, they <b>all</b> <b>agree</b> that after she boarded, crew were discovered daily, dead of exposure on the ship's bow; Law had the woman chained up in the belief she was responsible.|$|E
5|$|Arriving {{back in the}} wilderness, {{the trio}} sets up camp when Snatchers find and chase them down. Hermione strikes Harry with a curse to {{disguise}} his features as the Snatchers take them all to Malfoy Manor. Bellatrix Lestrange imprisons Harry and Ron in the cellar with Luna, Ollivander, and Griphook the goblin. Bellatrix then tortures Hermione for information on how they got the sword of Gryffindor, which Bellatrix claims was in her vault at Gringott's. Harry requests help, communicating {{with a piece of}} broken mirror in his possession. Dobby apparates into the cellar to save them. Harry and Ron rush to save Hermione, and a battle ensues that sees Harry disarm Draco Malfoy. Dobby drops a chandelier above Bellatrix, forcing her to release Hermione. Bellatrix throws her knife at them as Dobby grabs everyone and disapparates. They arrive at Shell Cottage and find that Bellatrix's knife has fatally wounded Dobby. Harry insists that they bury Dobby properly without any magic, which they <b>all</b> <b>agree</b> to do.|$|E
5|$|Modern writers <b>all</b> <b>agree</b> that Andrée's North Pole {{scheme was}} unrealistic. He {{relied on the}} winds blowing {{more or less in}} the {{direction}} he wanted to go, on being able to fine-tune his direction with the drag ropes, on the balloon being sealed tight enough to stay airborne for 30 days, and on no ice or snow sticking to the balloon to weigh it down. In the attempt of 1896, the wind immediately refuted his optimism by blowing steadily from the north, straight at the balloon hangar at Danes Island, until the expedition had to pack up, let the hydrogen out of the balloon, and go home. It is now known that northerly winds are to be expected at Danes Island; but in the late 19th century, information on Arctic airflow and precipitation existed only as contested academic hypotheses. Even Ekholm, an Arctic climate researcher, had no objection to Andrée's theory of where the wind was likely to take them. The observational data simply did not exist.|$|E

5|$|Though writers {{disagree}} on {{details of the}} handwriting (see the section on handwriting below), they <b>all</b> <b>agree</b> that the handwriting of the latter portion of Drexel 4257 is probably that of John Gamble, given {{that there is a}} concentration of his work {{in that part of the}} manuscript. This suggests that the book was begun by someone else (whom Lynn Hulse recognized as Thomas Jordan; see below). Duckles surmised that Gamble came into possession of the book in 1642–43 when the musicians of the Royal Chapel were dispersed as a result of the English Civil War. Although Gamble lost most of his possessions in a fire in 1666, this book appears to have survived. He made out his will on June 30, 1680 in which he bequeathed his grandson (also named John Gamble) all his books of music.|$|E
5|$|Brains pilots {{the plane}} {{onto the top}} deck but is confronted by Foster and his two {{surviving}} associates. Holding Penelope hostage in the cockpit, Foster intends to abandon the others, but Alan shoots and kills Foster. The Tiger Moth lifts off again with all hanging on to either the wings or undercarriage, just before Skyship One crashes {{to the ground and}} obliterates the evacuated missile base in a chain reaction. A shootout on board the Tiger Moth disposes of the last of the White Ghost agents, but a bullet has penetrated the fuel tank and the controls will not respond to Penelope. After narrow misses with a bridge on the unfinished M104 motorway and an exhaust tower, Alan and Penelope finally manage to ditch the plane into a field with Tin-Tin and Brains unhurt, however they then realise that no-one has seen Parker since Alan shot Foster, leading them to believe he never made it off Skyship One, but a distant voice reveals that he was caught up in a tree the plane crashed through. Back on Tracy Island, Brains unveils Thunderbird 6 as none other than the repaired, repainted and revamped Tiger Moth, which <b>all</b> <b>agree</b> has proven its value as a rescue aircraft.|$|E

25|$|From mid-1943 to mid-1944, {{development}} of the 90mm up-armored T26 prototype continued to proceed slowly due to disagreements within the U.S. Army about its future tank needs. The accounts of what exactly happened during this time vary by historian, but <b>all</b> <b>agree</b> that Army Ground Forces was {{the main source of}} resistance that delayed production of the T26.|$|E
25|$|With the {{exception}} of Hversu Noregr byggdist, where he is only a name in a list, three elements are common {{to all of the}} accounts: {{he was the son of}} a Danish king Healfdene, the brother of Halga, and he was the uncle of Hroðulf. Apart from that, the Scandinavian tradition is unanimous in dwelling on the incestuous relationship between Halga and his daughter Yrsa which resulted in Hroðulf, a story which was either not presented in Beowulf or was not known to the poet. The Danish sources (Chronicon Lethrense, Annales Lundenses, Gesta Danorum) <b>all</b> <b>agree</b> with Beowulf by making Hrothgar the king of Denmark. The Icelandic (Skjöldunga saga, Bjarkarímur, Hrólf Kraki's saga) <b>all</b> <b>agree</b> with Beowulf by mentioning that they had a sister, and by mentioning their feud with Froda and Ingeld, albeit with alterations. What is unique to the Icelandic versions are the adventures of Hrothgar and Halga before one of the two brothers could become king.|$|E
25|$|The {{primary sources}} {{do not agree}} on what was said at the meeting. They <b>all</b> <b>agree</b> that Wellington promised aid to Blücher, but they {{disagree}} on whether Wellington made an unequivocal promise of aid, or whether Wellington {{made it clear that}} his ability to give timely assistance to Blücher was only possible if his forces were not engaged before he could send aid.|$|E
