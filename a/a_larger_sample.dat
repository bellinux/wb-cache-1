25|$|Cluster {{sampling}} (also {{known as}} clustered sampling) generally increases {{the variability of}} sample estimates above that of simple random sampling, {{depending on how the}} clusters differ between one another as compared to the within-cluster variation. For this reason, cluster sampling requires <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>sample</b> than SRS to achieve the same level of accuracy – but cost savings from clustering might still make this a cheaper option.|$|E
25|$|Emerging {{research}} suggests that gay men from religious backgrounds are likely to come out online via Facebook and Blogs as it offers a protective interpersonal distance. This largely contradicts the growing movement in social media research indicating that online use, particularly Facebook, can lead to negative mental health outcomes such as increased levels of anxiety. While {{further research is needed}} to assess whether these results generalize to <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>sample,</b> these recent findings open the door to the possibility that gay men's online experiences may differ from heterosexuals' in that it may be more likely to provide mental health benefits than consequences.|$|E

25|$|Research {{published}} in 2003 on Y-chromosome marker variation, taken from <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>sample</b> population and from more sites throughout Britain, {{came to a}} different conclusion. This study suggested that in most of England, continental (North German and Danish) paternal genetic input varied between 20% and 40%, with York forming an outlier at about 60%. Southern England, including Kent, had markedly lower frequencies of non-indigenous Y-chromosome markers than eastern England, where Danish Viking settlement is attested. However, the study could not distinguish between North German and Danish populations, thus the relative proportions of genetic input derived from the Anglo-Saxon settlements and later Danish Viking colonisation could not be ascertained.|$|E
25|$|There are, however, some {{potential}} drawbacks to using stratified sampling. First, identifying strata and implementing {{such an approach}} can increase the cost and complexity of sample selection, as well as leading to increased complexity of population estimates. Second, when examining multiple criteria, stratifying variables {{may be related to}} some, but not to others, further complicating the design, and potentially reducing the utility of the strata. Finally, in some cases (such as designs with a large number of strata, or those with a specified minimum sample size per group), stratified sampling can potentially require <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>sample</b> than would other methods (although in most cases, the required sample size would be no larger than would be required for simple random sampling).|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that approximately 68% of cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy experience disturbances in sensory perception such as dysgeusia. In a pilot study involving twelve lung cancer patients, chemotherapy drugs were infused with zinc in order to test its potential as a treatment. The results indicated that, after two weeks, no taste disturbances were reported by the patients who received the zinc-supplemented treatment while most of the patients in the control group who did not receive the zinc reported taste alterations. A multi-institutional study involving <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>sample</b> size of 169 patients, however, indicated that zinc-infused chemotherapy did not {{have an effect on the}} development of taste disorders in cancer patients. An excess amount of zinc in the body can have negative effects on the immune system, and physicians must use caution when administering zinc to immunocompromised cancer patients. Because taste disorders can have detrimental effects on a patient's quality of life, more research needs to be conducted concerning possible treatments such as zinc supplementation.|$|E

25|$|An {{update on}} the above study; it employs the same methodology, has <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>sample</b> (20,055 {{respondent}}s), and a broader respondent age range (16–69). The study found that 96.5% of the entire sample (or 96.8% {{of the men and}} 96.3% of the women) identified as heterosexual, a drop from the 2003 findings (97.5%). Homosexuals accounted for 1.9% of the male population and 1.2% of the female population, a non-significant difference between the sexes. Bisexuals accounted for 1.3% of the male population and 2.2% of the female population. Women were significantly {{more likely than men to}} identify as bisexual, and less likely to report exclusively other-sex or same-sex attraction and experience. Similarly, more women reported same-sex experience and same-sex attraction. Nine percent of men and 19% of women had some history of same-sex attraction or experience. More women identified as lesbian or bisexual than in 2001–02. Homosexual/gay identity was more common among men with university education and living in cities, and much less common among men with blue-collar jobs. Both male and female bisexuality were more common among respondents under the age of 20. Male bisexuality was also overrepresented among men in their sixties.|$|E
500|$|Acquiring <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>sample</b> of {{such objects}} would help in {{determining}} which scenario is most likely. [...] "I call Sedna a fossil {{record of the}} earliest Solar System", said Brown in 2006. [...] "Eventually, when other fossil records are found, Sedna will help tell us how the Sun formed {{and the number of}} stars that were close to the Sun when it formed." [...] A 2007–2008 survey by Brown, Rabinowitz and Megan Schwamb attempted to locate another member of Sedna's hypothetical population. Although the survey was sensitive to movement out to 1,000AU and discovered the likely dwarf planet , it detected no new sednoid. Subsequent simulations incorporating the new data suggested about 40 Sedna-sized objects probably exist in this region, with the brightest being about Eris's magnitude (−1.0).|$|E
500|$|French naturalist Henri Filhol first {{described}} Plesiorycteropus madagascariensis in 1895 {{on the basis}} of a partial skull found at the cave of Belo. His description was vague even by 19th-century standards, but he placed the animal close to the aardvark (Orycteropus). The generic name combines Ancient Greek plesio- [...] "near" [...] with Orycteropus, the genus of the aardvark, and the specific name refers to Madagascar. Charles Lamberton, who had access to <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>sample</b> for his 1946 review of the genus, noted substantial variation, but did not attempt to differentiate multiple species. In 1994, Ross MacPhee again reviewed Plesiorycteropus and was able to separate two species, the larger P.madagascariensis and a new, smaller species that he named Plesiorycteropus germainepetterae after scientist Germaine Petter. The two species differ in a number of morphological characters in addition to size.|$|E
