5|$|On <b>arrival</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{stations}} coffins {{would usually}} be unloaded onto a hand-drawn bier and pulled by LNC {{staff to the}} appropriate chapel. While this was taking place the mourners were escorted to the waiting rooms at the station. On <b>arrival</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> chapels first and second class funerals would generally have a brief service (third class funerals had a single service in the appropriate chapel for all those being buried). For those burials where the funeral service had already been held at either a parish church or the LNC's London terminus the coffins would be taken directly from the train to the grave.|$|E

It departed Munich Franz Josef Strauss Airport aboard an Antonov An-124 aircraft on 12 January, and arrived at Baikonur the next day. Following <b>arrival</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> launch site, final assembly and testing were conducted.|$|E
5|$|Kippenberger {{finally arrived}} on the Western Front in September 1916, as a private in the 1st Canterbury Regiment. His <b>arrival</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> front coincided with the Somme Offensive. He {{took part in the}} Battle of Flers-Courcelette which began on 15 September and {{remained}} in the front lines for over three weeks before the regiment was withdrawn. His unit suffered heavy casualties during this time; Kippenberger was one of just five soldiers left in his platoon after the battle ended.|$|E

He was cremated in Leipzig and his ashes laid in an urn and then buried at the Vienna Central Cemetery, Zentralfriedhof. An obituary of List authored by Berlin journalist Philipp Stauff then appeared in the Münchener Beobachter.|$|E

5|$|The {{altering}} of the qibla {{was precisely}} the reason the Rashidun caliph Umar, despite identifying the mosque which Muhammad used to ascend to Heaven upon his <b>arrival</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Noble Sanctuary in 638, neither prayed facing it nor built any structure upon it. This was because {{the significance of that}} particular spot on the Noble Sanctuary was superseded in Islamic jurisprudence by the Kaaba in Mecca after the change of the qibla towards that site.|$|E
5|$|The {{claim that}} the {{accordion}} feat was performed by Home using a small harmonica was originally suggested by J. M. Robertson in 1891.

5|$|Abyssobrotula galatheae, {{a species}} of cusk eel in the family Ophidiidae, is among the deepest-living species of fish. In 1970, one {{specimen}} was trawled from a depth of 8370meters in the Puerto Rico Trench. The animal was dead, however, upon <b>arrival</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> surface. In 2008, the hadal snailfish (Pseudoliparis amblystomopsis) was observed and recorded {{at a depth of}} 7700meters in the Japan Trench. These are, to date, the deepest living fish ever recorded. Other fish of the abyssal zone include the fishes of the Ipnopidae family, which includes the abyssal spiderfish (Bathypterois longipes), tripodfish (Bathypterois grallator), feeler fish (Bathypterois longifilis), and the black lizardfish (Bathysauropsis gracilis). Some members of this family have been recorded from depths of more than 6000meters.|$|E
5|$|At 01:30 on 7 June, the 9th Parachute Battalion, {{with only}} around ninety {{men at the}} time, marched through the unoccupied Bréville. Upon <b>arrival</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 3rd Parachute Brigade's position, the {{parachute}} battalion was ordered to dig in at {{the northern end of}} the brigade line. They would be responsible for defending an area from the Château Saint Come, across a clearing in the woods, to a house known as the Bois de Mont. To their front was a stretch of open land leading to Bréville-les-Monts and the road from Amfreville to Le Mesnil-les-Monts. A shortage in their numbers left a large gap between the 9th Parachute Battalion and No. 6 Commando, the most southern unit in the commando defensive position, to their north.|$|E
5|$|Due to a {{small number}} of embassies, Azerbaijan can be more {{difficult}} to obtain a visa when compared to other countries which have hosted the Olympiad. This issue was briefly raised during the 83rd FIDE Congress, and Azad Rahimov noted the country had a positive experience with the Eurovision Song Contest 2012, where all participants could receive a visa on <b>arrival</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> airport without any problem. In a similar manner, in April 2016, the President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev signed an order on simplifying the visa procedures for travellers to Azerbaijan in connection with the Chess Olympiad, allowing them to get visas in the country's international airports.|$|E

5|$|Feeling a {{sense of}} debt to Pit, Dark Pit takes him to the Rewind Spring so time can be {{reversed}} for Pit's body. On his journey there, he, Palutena, and Viridi learn that Hades has been profiting off the wars against the Underworld Army, Forces of Nature, Aurum, and Chaos Kin by using the souls of slaughtered humans to add numbers to his forces. Upon <b>arrival</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Rewind Spring, Pandora is revived due to the Spring's effects on her stolen powers within Dark Pit. Pandora then uses the Spring to restore her health and ultimately her physical body, but is still defeated by Dark Pit.|$|E
5|$|Following {{this the}} routine of the {{battalion}} became more settled and time was found for the men of each company to spend a fortnight at a hotel on the Lignano beach. Afterwards, preparations began for the battalion's return to New Zealand. The war with Japan continued however, {{and at the time}} it was believed that the Māoris would take part in further operations in the Pacific. New Zealand policy at the time was that long serving men were to be repatriated and their places taken by men with less time in service. In this regard, commencing in late May, drafts of men departed in the order of their <b>arrival</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> battalion. This included the commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Arapeta Awatere, who was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel James Henare.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} three months the siege {{continued}} with little significant activity on either side, until the <b>arrival</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of July of General François Watrin with 5,000 additional men and instructions from General Joachim Murat to prosecute the siege more vigorously. However, the arrival off Porto Ferrajo on 1 August of a powerful British squadron under Rear-Admiral Sir John Borlase Warren in HMS Renown, whose ship chased Bravoure and Succès as far as Leghorn and reopened the sea passage into the port, almost immediately frustrated Watrin's ambitions. At the same time, a small British force under Captain Gordon landed at Porto Ferrajo to augment the Tuscan garrison.|$|E
