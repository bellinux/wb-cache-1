25|$|Radiation fog {{is formed}} by the cooling of land after sunset by {{infrared}} thermal radiation in calm conditions with a clear sky. The cooling ground then cools adjacent air by conduction, causing the air temperature to fall below the dew point, forming fog. In perfect calm, the fog layer can be less than a meter thick, but turbulence can promote a thicker layer. Radiation fogs occur at night, and usually doesn't last long after sunrise, but it can persist <b>all</b> <b>day</b> <b>in</b> the winter months especially in areas bounded by high ground. Radiation fog is most common in autumn and early winter. Examples of this phenomenon include the Tule fog.|$|E

At 1:00 AM on 10 April, a body of 700 men under Captains Casas and Llovera crept up to the postern gate where Marquez and the Pons brothers waited. Rovira's feint had alerted the garrison and {{a large portion of}} it had been marching in the hills <b>all</b> <b>day</b> <b>in</b> a futile effort to catch the partisans.

By dawn the following day the battalion was just north of the Utrecht to Arnhem railway line. When they came under attack from German 88mm guns. Both battalions were ordered to start an assault on the position at 07:00. After repeated attacks the battalion got no further forward.

500|$|The National Repertory Orchestra {{was founded}} as the Blue Jeans Symphony in 1960 by cellist and {{conductor}} Walter Charles.

Charles had conceived the idea for an intensive summer training camp for aspiring orchestral musicians in the 1950s {{when he was the}} conductor of the Wichita Falls Symphony Orchestra and chose Estes Park after vacationing there with his wife. The program was launched with 55 musicians and a $2000 grant from the town's chamber of commerce. In its early days, the young musicians worked <b>all</b> <b>day</b> <b>in</b> jobs at the resort and rehearsed from 10p.m. to midnight. This was a requirement for all the musicians, regardless of their ability to pay for their room and board, and one which Charles described at the time as [...] "part of the philosophical training of the Blue Jeans program." [...] The orchestra performed their concerts in blue jeans, and Charles conducted in a denim white tie and tails especially made for him by Levi-Strauss.|$|E

Lyrically, the ballad employs several [...] "twist and turns", using very specific lyrics to describe both the performer's fascination with the human world and desire to walk among them, including [...] "walking around on those what-do-you-call-them?... feet" [...] and [...] "Up where they walk, up where they run/Up where they stay <b>all</b> <b>day</b> <b>in</b> the sun/Wanderin' free, wish I could be/Part of that world."

500|$|When bowling, Trumble {{made the}} most of his height, {{bringing}} the ball over the full extent of his right arm. His action was described by his team-mate and bowling partner, Monty Noble, as [...] "sidelong and insinuating, with his neck craned like a gigantic bird". He bowled off spinners with an impeccable length at medium pace and was able to swing the new ball. He had a well-disguised slower ball, hoodwinking batsmen such as Stanley Jackson, who said, [...] "You old devil. You get me caught-and-bowled whenever you like but I'll pick that slow one sooner or later." [...] He preferred English pitches, saying he hardly saw one on which he could not get some turn and the temperate weather allowed him to bowl <b>all</b> <b>day.</b> <b>In</b> Australia, Trumble had to work harder for his wickets on firmer pitches, relying on his change of pace and consistent accuracy; he claimed he could land the ball on a saucer [...] away five times out of six. Johnnie Moyes named him as an [...] "immortal of the art" [...] who succeeded by [...] "attacking the batsman's strength". W. G. Grace called him [...] "the best bowler Australia has sent us". While Trumble was able to score 1,183runs during the 1899 tour of England, the demands of bowling did not allow him to consistently score heavily. His long, [...] fingers helped him make a reputation as a fine slips fieldsman and {{he was the first to}} take 20catches in an Australian season. English cricketer Johnny Douglas said, [...] "Trumble should not be allowed on the cricket field—his natural place would be up trees in the bush." [...] He practised slip fielding by catching a tennis ball thrown against a brick wall; he believed this practise trained him not to [...] "snatch" [...] at the ball but allow it to fall into his safe hands.|$|E
