40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} band-structure calculations {{governed by the}} Helmholtz or Maxwell equations in piecewise homogeneous periodic materials. Methods based on boundary integral equations are natural in this context, since they discretize the interface alone and can achieve high order accuracy in complicated geometries. In order to handle the quasi-periodic conditions which are imposed on the unit cell, the free-space Green's function is typically replaced by its quasi-periodic cousin. Unfortunately, the quasi-periodic Green's function diverges for families of parameter values that correspond to resonances of the empty unit cell. Here, we bypass this problem {{by means of a}} new integral representation that relies on the free-space Green's function alone, adding <b>auxiliary</b> <b>layer</b> potentials on the boundary of the unit cell itself. An important aspect of our method is that by carefully including a few neighboring images, the densities may be kept smooth and convergence rapid. This framework results in an integral equation of the second kind, avoids spurious resonances, and achieves spectral accuracy. Because of our image structure, inclusions which intersect the unit cell walls may be handled easily and automatically. Our approach is compatible with fast-multipole acceleration, generalizes easily to three dimensions, and avoids the complication of divergent lattice sums.

40|$|The {{interaction}} topology {{among the}} constituents {{of a complex}} network {{plays a crucial role}} in the network's evolutionary mechanisms and functional behaviors. However, some network topologies are usually unknown or uncertain. Meanwhile, coupling delay are ubiquitous in various man-made and natural networks. Hence, it is necessary to gain knowledge of the whole or partial topology of a complex dynamical network by taking into consideration communication delay. In this paper, topology identification of complex dynamical networks is investigated via generalized synchronization of a two-layer network. Particularly, based on the LaSalle-type invariance principle of stochastic differential delay equations, an adaptive control technique is proposed by constructing an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>layer</b> and designing proper control input and updating laws so that the unknown topology can be recovered upon successful generalized synchronization. Numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The technique provides a certain theoretical basis for topology inference of complex networks. In particular, when the considered network is composed of systems with high-dimension or complicated dynamics, a simpler response layer can be constructed, which is conducive to circuit design. Moreover, it is practical to take into consideration perturbations caused by control input. Finally, the method is applicable to infer topology of a subnetwork embedded within a complex system and locate hidden sources. We hope the results can provide basic insight into further research endeavors on understanding practical and economical topology inference of networks...|$|E
30|$|Being a wide-band-gap {{semiconductor}} (a gap {{of approximately}} 3.4 eV at room temperature) {{with a high}} thermal and chemical stability, zinc oxide (ZnO) has recently attracted a great scientific interest due to its possible applications in electronics and optoelectronics. Thin films of ZnO can be prepared by several growth techniques, including pulsed laser deposition [11, 12] and radio-frequency magnetron sputtering [13, 14]. However, the quality of ZnO films obtained by these methods depends on either a high growth temperature (350 °C to 450 °C) or a post-growth annealing process. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) has emerged as an important technique {{for a variety of}} applications based on large area uniformity, precise thickness control, and highly conformal deposition. Most importantly, it can be applied under low-temperature growth, which is crucial for the fabrication of low-cost and flexible electronics components [15 - 17]. Based on the conformality, continuous, and pinhole-free films achieved by ALD [18], ZnO films can be used for encapsulation [19]. The electrical properties of ZnO are also a major research focus [20]. The conductivity of this material is strongly defect related. The control of defects is very important for related applications. However, the exact value of free-carrier concentration found in ZnO thin films strongly depends on the growth method and the parameters used in the process. Probably, the most important factor that influences the ZnO film electric parameters is the growth temperature, as it controls the thermodynamics of the growth process [21]. High-temperature deposition processes can intensify the oxygen vacancy or Zn interstitial formation and contribute in this way to the high level of n-electron doping [22]. We obtain ZnO films at the extremely low temperature of 60 °C and combine the ZnO films with AgNW anodes. In this work, we first apply the ZnO film as an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>layer</b> of the electrode to form AgNW/ZnO hybrid electrode. By the ALD method, a thin, relatively low viscosity of diethylzinc ((DEZn) [Zn(C 2 H 5) 2]) is applied, through which H 2 O molecules could easily penetrate into the porous AgNW network to form a conductive-bridging ZnO film and fill up the unoccupied spaces among the nanowires, forming the second dense conductive film alongside the AgNW network after the photopolymer is cured. When applying this approach, ZnO fills the vacancy between nanowires to a sufficient degree, which resolves the problem that the gaps between nanowires restrict the injection of carriers. As a result, the injection of carriers could be effectively improved. This approach is conducive to making mesh electrodes like nanowire electrodes reach a better performance. At the same time, the low temperature at which ZnO is grown simultaneously guarantees the flexibility and the mechanical properties of the plastic substrate, which is suitable for the development of flexible electronic devices.|$|E
40|$|Power {{electronic}} converter drives use, for {{the sake}} of high efficiency, pulse-width modulation that results in sequences of high-voltage high-frequency steep-edged pulses. Such a signal contains a set of high harmonics not required for control purposes. Harmonics cause reflections in the cable between the motor and the inverter leading to faster winding insulation ageing. Bearing failures and problems with electromagnetic compatibility may also result. Electrical du/dt filters provide an effective solution to problems caused by pulse-width modulation, thereby increasing the performance and service life of the electrical machines. It is shown that RLC filters effectively decrease the reflection phenomena in the cable. Improved (simple, but effective) solutions are found for both differential- and common-mode signals; these solutions use a galvanic connection between the RLC filter star point and the converter DC link. Foil chokes and film capacitors are among the most widely used components in high-power applications. In actual applications they can be placed {{in different parts of the}} cabinet. This fact complicates the arrangement of the cabinet and decreases the reliability of the system. In addition, the inductances of connection wires may prevent filtration at high frequencies. This thesis introduces a new hybrid LC filter that uses a natural capacitance between the turns of the foil choke based on integration of an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>layer</b> into it. The main idea of the hybrid LC filter results from the fact that both the foil choke and the film capacitors have the same roll structure. Moreover, the capacitance between the turns (“intra capacitance”) of the foil inductors is the reason for the deterioration of their properties at high frequencies. It is shown that the proposed filter has a natural cancellation of the intra capacitance. A hybrid LC filter may contain two or more foil layers isolated from each other and coiled on a core. The core material can be iron or even air as in the filter considered in this work. One of the foils, called the main foil, can be placed between the inverter and the motor cable. Other ones, called auxiliary foils, may be connected in star to create differential-mode noise paths, and then coupled to the DC link midpoint to guarantee a traveling path, especially for the common-mode currents. This way, there is a remarkable capacitance between the main foil and the auxiliary foil. Investigations showed that such a system can be described by a simple equivalent LC filter in a wide range of frequencies. Because of its simple hybrid construction, the proposed LC filter can be a cost-effective and competitive solution for modern power drives. In the thesis, the application field of the proposed filter is considered and determined. The basics of hybrid LC filter design are developed further. High-frequency behaviour of the proposed filter is analysed by simulations. Finally, the thesis presents experimental data proving that the hybrid LC filter can be used for du/dt of PWM pulses and reduction of common-mode currents...|$|E

40|$|Energy {{consumption}} in machining manufacturing systems is increasingly of interest due to concern for {{global climate change}} and manufacturing sustainability. To utilise energy more effectively, it is paramount to understand and characterise the energy consumption of machining manufacturing systems.

40|$|A {{scintillator}} is {{a material}} which emits light when excited by ionizing radiation. Such materials {{are used in}} a diverse range of applications; From high energy particle physics experiments, X-ray security, to nuclear cameras or positron emission tomography. Future high-energy physics (HEP) experiments as well as next generation medical imaging applications {{are more and more}} pushing towards better scintillation characteristics. One of the problems in heavy scintillating materials is related to their high index of refraction. As a consequence, most of the scintillation light produced in the bulk material is trapped inside the crystal due to total internal reflection. The same problem also occurs with light emitting diodes (LEDs) and has for a long time been considered as a limiting factor for their overall efficiency. Recent developments in the area of nanophotonics were showing now that those limitations can be overcome by introducing a photonic crystal (PhC) slab at the outcoupling surface of the substrate. Photonic crystals are optical materials which can affect the propagation of light in multiple ways. In this work, we used 2 D PhC slabs consisting of hexagonal placed rods of air or square shaped pillars made of silicon nitride. The 300 - 500 nm thick photonic crystal slab changes the reflection properties of the crystal-air interface in different ways. In our case the pattern was optimized to enable the light extraction of photons which are otherwise confined within the scintillator by total internal reflections. In the simulation part we could show light output improvements {{of a wide range of}} scintillating materials due to light scattering effects of the photonic crystal grating. For these calculations we used two different programs. At first, a Monte Carlo program called LITRANI was used to calculate the light propagation inside a common scintillation based detector setup. LITRANI calculates the path of a photon starting from the production inside the crystal by an ionizing event all the way through the different materials until it is absorbed or detected. It uses the Fresnel formulas to calculate the light transition and reflection between different absorbing or non-absorbing materials. The second program in our simulations was used to calculate the light extraction efficiency of our PhC structure. This program calculates the 2 D photonic crystal interface using a rigorous coupled wave analysis (RCWA) tool. It was used to determine the reflection and transition parameters of the PhC slab for a photon of a certain angle and polarization. With the combination of these two programs the overall gain of the PhC modified scintillators could be calculated and we could show a theoretical light yield improvement of 60 - 100 % by the use of PhCs. In the practical part of this work it is shown how the first samples of PhC slabs on top of different scintillators were produced. The aim of these demonstrator samples was to confirm the simulation results by measurements. Through the deposition of an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>layer</b> of silicon nitride and the adaptation of the standard electron beam lithography (EBL) parameters we could successfully produce several PhC slabs on top of $ 1. 2 	imes 2. 6 	imes 5 mm^ 3 $ lutetium oxyorthosilicate (LSO) scintillators. In the characterization process, the PhC samples showed a 30 - 60 % light yield improvement when compared to an unstructured reference scintillator. In our analysis it could be shown that the measured PhC sample properties are in close accordance with the calculations from our simulations...|$|E

The advantage of using this method is that the oscillating equations can be replaced by so-called effective ones with smooth coefficients which are easier to solve, and the oscillating cost function can be replaced by the effective drag which depends only on the so-called Navier matrix. The entries of this matrix can be calculated using an <b>auxiliary</b> boundary <b>layer</b> prob...|$|R
40|$|The {{performances}} of kriging, co-kriging, and kriging combined with regression were compared. These last two methods {{were applied to}} improve the interpolation of the soft-layer depth (Dsl), using the bulk soil electrical conductivity as an <b>auxiliary</b> variable. Soft <b>layers</b> were not detected within the boring depth of 1. 20 m at 10 % of the locations. Special {{attention was paid to}} these so-called censored observations on Dsl in the regression analysis and in the interpolations. Kriging combined with regression gave better results than co-kriging. Moreover, in kriging combined with regression fewer model parameters needed to be estimated...|$|R
40|$|With {{the number}} of {{wavelengths}} on fibers keeps increasing, the size {{and the cost of}} Optical Cross-Connect (OXC) are greatly enhanced and then the control and management of optical switches become more and more complicated. Therefore, the technique called waveband switching is proposed to reduce the size and the cost of OXC; that is, to save the All-Optical (OOO) switching ports in OXC. However, the existing waveband switching algorithms are all limited in single-domain optical networks. Actually, with the scale of optical backbone keeps enlarging, the network is divided to multiple independent domains to perform the hierarchy routing for achieving the scalability. In order to reduce the size and the cost of OXC meanwhile to achieve the scalability in multi-domains, in this paper we propose a new heuristic algorithm called Waveband Grooming with <b>Layered</b> <b>Auxiliary</b> Graph (WGLAG) since the waveband grooming problem is the NP-hard to perform the inter-domain routing based on the virtual topology of multi-domain network and the intra-domain routing based on the physical topology of single-domain network. In intra-domain routing with waveband grooming of each single-domain, we propose the <b>Layered</b> <b>Auxiliary</b> Graph (LAG) that includes one virtual topology layer and multiple waveband-plane layers to compute a single-hop, or multi-hop or hybrid waveband route for each connection request based on the sub-path waveband grooming scheme. Simulation results show that, WGLAG not only can effectively save more switching ports to reduce the cost of OXC but also can obtain lower blocking probability than other algorithm.

40|$|The overall aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the potential of Building Information Modelling (BIM) for construction waste minimization. We evaluated the leading BIM design software products and concluded that none of them currently support construction waste minimization. This motivates the development of a plug-in for predicting and minimizing construction waste. After a rigorous literature review and conducting four focused group interviews (FGIs), 12 imperative BIM factors were identified that should be considered for predicting and designing out construction waste. These factors were categorized into four layers, namely the BIM core features <b>layer,</b> the BIM <b>auxiliary</b> features <b>layer,</b> the waste management criteria layer, and the application layer. Further, a process to carry out BIM-enabled building waste analysis (BWA) is proposed. We have also investigated the usage of big data technologies in the context of waste minimization. We highlight that big data technologies are inherently suitable for BIM due to their support of storing and processing large datasets. In particular, the use of graph-based representation, analysis, and visualization can be employed for advancing the state of the art in BIM technology for construction waste minimization...|$|R
30|$|The DAB {{method is}} based on truncating the {{unbounded}} domain to produce a finite computational domain, and on applying a local high-order ABC on two parallel artificial boundaries, which are a small distance apart, and thus form a thin non-reflecting <b>layer.</b> <b>Auxiliary</b> variables are defined on the two boundaries and within the layer, {{and participate in the}} numerical scheme. In previous studies DAB was developed for acoustic waves which are solutions to the scalar wave equation. Here the approach is extended to time-dependent elastic waves in homogeneous and layered media. The equations are written in second-order form in space and time. Standard Finite Elements (FE) are used for space discretization and the damped Newmark scheme is used for time discretization.|$|R
