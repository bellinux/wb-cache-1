5|$|About {{a talent}} for composition... I can say nothing as yet. You have tried your powers too little... Yes, one can study on one's own. Sometimes one needs advice, but one must study... <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> that is, I myself and Borodin, and Balakirev, and {{especially}} Cui and Mussorgsky, did disdain these things. I consider myself lucky that I bethought myself in time and forced myself to work. As for Balakirev, owing to his insufficient technique he writes little; Borodin, with difficulty; Cui, carelessly; and Mussorgsky, sloppily and often incoherently.|$|E
5|$|Fischer won the 1962 Stockholm Interzonal by a 2½-point margin, going undefeated, with 17½/22 (+13−0=9). He was {{the first}} non-Soviet player to win an Interzonal since FIDE instituted the tournament in 1948. Russian {{grandmaster}} Alexander Kotov said of Fischer:I have discussed Fischer's play with Max Euwe and Gideon Stahlberg. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> experienced 'tournament old-timers', were surprised by Fischer's endgame expertise. When a young player is good at attacking or at combinations, this is understandable, but a faultless endgame technique {{at the age of}} 19 is something rare. I can recall only one other player who at that age was equally skillful at endgames — Vasily Smyslov.|$|E

5|$|It can {{be argued}} that private charity is {{insufficient}} because the benefits from it accrue to people other than those who make the gifts—... a neighborhood effect. I am distressed by the sight of poverty; I am benefited by its alleviation; but I am benefited equally whether I or someone else pays for its alleviation; the benefits of other people's charity therefore partly accrue to me. To put it differently, we might <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> be willing to contribute to the relief of poverty, provided everyone else did. We might not be willing to contribute the same amount without such assurance. In small communities, public pressure can suffice to realize the proviso even with private charity. In the large impersonal communities that are increasingly coming to dominate our society, it is much more difficult for it to do so.|$|E
5|$|McGugin {{took time}} off from {{coaching}} {{to work in the}} mining business during the First World War. On a draft registration card completed in 1918, McGugin stated that he was the president of the Kensee Mining Company in Marion, Kentucky. On August 10, 1918, while on protection patrol, Rabbit Curry was killed in an aerial combat over Perles, France. After learning about Curry's death McGugin wired this telegram to The Tennessean:During the four years of my intimate association with Irby Curry, I never heard him utter a word his mother might not hear and approve. A game sportsman and scholar, truly he was gentle as a dove. He had a lion's heart, and now a hero's death. Poor Little Rabbit! How he pulls at the heart-strings of <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> who knew him and therefore honored and loved him tenderly.|$|E
5|$|The census {{report of}} 2010 Zambian census was {{released}} {{during the first}} week of March 2013 by Fredson Yamba, Secretary to the Treasury of the Government of Zambia.

We now have the data, therefore, the challenge remains with <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> to ensure it is put into good use by making informed decisions for our people,”. United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) helped the Government of Zambia, especially the Child Welfare Ministry to update the data from the Living Condition Monitoring Survey (LCMS) and data on all key performance indicators of the National Development Plan (ZNDP) during 2013.|$|E
