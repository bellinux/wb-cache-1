2500|$|As {{a result}} of these efforts a new Catholic University of Ireland was opened in 1854 and John Henry Newman was {{appointed}} as its first rector. Newman had been an integral figure in the Oxford Movement in the 19th Century. The Catholic University opened its doors on the feast of St Malachy, 3 November 1854. On that day the names of seventeen students were entered on the register and Newman gave the students an address [...] "What <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>here</b> for" [...] and prophesied that in later years they would look back with pride on the day. The university opened with three houses: 86 St Stephen's Green, which was known as St Patrick's or University House, under the care of The Rev. Michael Flannery; 16 Harcourt Street, known as St Lawrence's under the care of The Rev. James Quinn, who also had his school there; and Newman's own house, 6 Harcourt Street, known as St Mary's under Newman's personal supervision.|$|E

6000|$|But <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>here</b> to pause? Not so.

Guiding our imaginations by that omniprevalent law of laws, the law of periodicity, are we not, indeed, more than justified in entertaining a belief—let us say, rather, in indulging a hope—that the processes we have here ventured to contemplate will be renewed forever, and forever, and forever; a novel Universe swelling into existence, and then subsiding into nothingness, at every throb of the Heart Divine? ...|$|E

No. Then why <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>here,</b> my friends?

It should be merrier; but grief Is of the fashion now--I know not why. You must not weep: do we not love each other? - That is enough. Death, what do you here? You were not bidden to this table, sir; Away, we have no need of you: I tell you It was in wine I pledged you, not in poison. They lied who told you that I drank your poison. It was spilt upon the ground, like my Lord's blood; You came too late.|$|E
