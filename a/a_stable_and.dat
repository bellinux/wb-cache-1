5|$|Aldona (baptized as Ona or Anna; her pagan name {{is known}} {{only from the}} {{writings}} of the 16th century chronicler Maciej Stryjkowski) married Casimir III of Poland, son of Władysław I of Poland, when he was 15 or 16 years old. The marriage took place on either 30 April or 16 October 1325, and was a purely political maneuver to strengthen the Polish–Lithuanian coalition against the Teutonic Knights (an alliance foreshadowing the Union of Krewo in 1385 and the Union of Lublin in 1569, with the latter resulting in <b>a</b> <b>stable</b> <b>and</b> powerful new state, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth). This preliminary coalition was short-lived, collapsing in about 1330, but {{there is no evidence of}} military conflict between Poland and Lithuania while Aldona was alive.|$|E
5|$|Building {{practices}} {{along the}} coast also included boathouses, fishing cottages, piers, etc. Here, houses for livestock and people were typically built up from the actual shoreline. A typical medium-sized farm in the inland of Norway would include a dwelling house (våningshus), hay barn (låve), livestock barn (fjøs), one or more food storage houses (stabbur), <b>a</b> <b>stable,</b> <b>and</b> occasionally separate houses for poultry, pigs, etc. Houses that had separate heat sources, e.g., washing houses (eldhus) and smithies were usually kept separate from the other houses to prevent fires. Outhouses were typically separate, small structures. If the farm housed craftsmen, there would also be separate houses for carpentry, wheel making, shoemaking, etc.|$|E
5|$|Olver {{has been}} a staunch {{opponent}} of the United States involvement in Iraq, and opposed a United States military presence in Iraq since the 2002 authorization {{for the use of}} force in Iraq. Olver has advocated for the removal of U.S. troops from Iraq, and has consistently voted against proposals to increase funding for military operations and increased deployment. Olver stated that he believes that the United States should seek out a political solution in cooperation with the states neighboring Iraq, such as Iran and Syria, rather than pursuing a strategy based primarily on military means in order to create <b>a</b> <b>stable</b> <b>and</b> democratic Iraq.|$|E

5|$|The {{purpose of}} {{marriage}} in the Bahá'i faith is mainly to foster spiritual harmony, fellowship and unity {{between a man and}} a woman and to provide <b>a</b> <b>stable</b> <b>and</b> loving environment for the rearing of children. The Bahá'í teachings on marriage call it a fortress for well-being and salvation and place marriage and the family as the foundation of the structure of human society. Bahá'u'lláh highly praised marriage, discouraged divorce, and required chastity outside of marriage; Bahá'u'lláh taught that a husband and wife should strive to improve the spiritual life of each other. Interracial marriage is also highly praised throughout Bahá'í scripture.|$|E
5|$|These moves {{were met}} with some criticism, as the {{preserved}} counties were created to sustain <b>a</b> <b>stable</b> <b>and</b> continuing layout, irrespective of interim local government reviews affecting principal areas. This led to some areas, such as the Aberconwy district, moving to a preserved county {{it had never been}} administered by in the past, and therefore these moves went generally unreported due to the preserved county's limited status. The Boundary Commission proceeded to retain the eight preserved counties, and modified their borders in 2003 to match with the incumbent principal area boundaries. The 2003 arrangement brings towns such as Llandudno, Conwy and Betws-y-Coed into the preserved county of Clwyd.|$|E
5|$|Across the country, {{statues of}} Cecil Rhodes were removed and squares and roads named after {{prominent}} colonial figures were renamed after black nationalists. In 1982 Salisbury was renamed Harare. Mugabe employed North Korean architects to design Heroes' Acre, a monument and complex in western Harare {{to commemorate the}} struggle against minority rule. Zimbabwe also received much aid from Western countries, whose governments hoped that <b>a</b> <b>stable</b> <b>and</b> prosperous Zimbabwe would aid the transition of South Africa away from apartheid and minority rule. The United States provided Zimbabwe with a $25 million three-year aid package. The UK financed a land reform program, and provided military advisers to aid {{the integration of the}} guerrilla armies and old Rhodesian security forces into a new Zimbabwean military. Members of both ZANLA and ZIPRA were integrated into the army, although there remained a strong rivalry between the two groups. As President, Mugabe retained Walls {{as the head of the}} armed forces.|$|E

5|$|The Delichon species {{typically}} feed {{higher in}} the air, and take smaller prey than other swallows. It is believed that this reduces inter-specific food competition, particularly with the barn swallow which shares much of the breeding and wintering range of the martins. The insects eaten are mostly small flies, aphids and Hymenoptera such as winged ants. A wide range of other insects are caught, including Lepidoptera, beetles and lacewings. The Asian house martin appears to occasionally take terrestrial springtails and larvae and the common house martin also sometimes feeds on the ground. These martins are gregarious, feeding in flocks often with other aerial predators like swifts, or other hirundines such as the barn or striated swallows. In the case of at least the common house martin, the start of egg laying appears {{to be linked to}} the appearance of large numbers of flying aphids, which provide <b>a</b> <b>stable</b> <b>and</b> abundant food supply.|$|E
5|$|The {{team from}} the University of Mainz were {{planning}} to study the electrodeposition of hassium atoms using the new TASCA facility at the GSI. Their aim was to use the reaction 226Ra(48Ca,4n)270Hs. In addition, scientists at the GSI were hoping to utilize TASCA to study the synthesis and properties of the hassium(II) compound hassocene, Hs(C5H5)2, using the reaction 226Ra(48Ca,xn). This compound {{is analogous to the}} lighter ferrocene, ruthenocene, and osmocene, and is expected to have the two cyclopentadienyl rings in an eclipsed conformation like ruthenocene and osmocene and not in a staggered conformation like ferrocene. Hassocene was chosen because it has hassium in the low formal oxidation state of +2 (although the bonding between the metal and the rings is mostly covalent in metallocenes) rather than the high +8 state which had previously been investigated, and relativistic effects were expected to be stronger in the lower oxidation state. Many metals in the periodic table form metallocenes, so that trends could be more easily determined, and the highly symmetric structure of hassocene and its low number of atoms also make relativistic calculations easier. Hassocene should be <b>a</b> <b>stable</b> <b>and</b> highly volatile compound.|$|E
5|$|Various {{other plans}} were {{considered}} to address the debt issues during the first session of Congress, but none were able to generate widespread support. In September 1789, with no resolution in sight and the close of that session drawing near, Congress directed Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton to prepare a report on credit. In his Report on the Public Credit (the first of three fiscal and economic policy reports), Hamilton called for the federal assumption of state debt and the mass issuance of federal bonds. Hamilton believed that these measures would restore the ailing economy, ensure <b>a</b> <b>stable</b> <b>and</b> adequate money stock, and {{make it easier for}} the federal government to borrow during emergencies such as wars. He also proposed redeeming the promissory notes issued by the Continental Congress during the American Revolution at full value. Many former soldiers had sold their notes at a fraction of face value, believing them to be worthless. He planned to buy back the promissory notes from their current holders. This idea drew loud objections from many who were of the opinion that the notes should be paid back either to the original holder or to both the current and original holder.|$|E
