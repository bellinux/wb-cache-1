5|$|<b>A</b> <b>focal</b> {{mechanism}} {{solution of}} the earthquake confirmed two nodal planes both striking north-south and dipping approximately 45degrees {{to the east and}} to the west. This faulting suggests dip slip reverse motion, and to a horizontal east-west axis of confining stress. The rupture also occurred partially on the New Madrid Fault, responsible for the great New Madrid earthquakes in 1812, consisting of the most powerful earthquakes to hit the contiguous United States.|$|E

50|$|One can {{see that}} if {{magnification}} remains constant, <b>a</b> longer <b>focal</b> length results in a smaller axial magnification, and <b>a</b> smaller <b>focal</b> length <b>a</b> larger axial magnification. That is, when using <b>a</b> longer <b>focal</b> length while moving the camera/lens away from the object to maintain the same magnification M, objects seem shallower, and the axial distances between objects seem shorter. The opposite-- increased axial magnification -- happens with shorter focal lengths while moving the camera/lens towards the object.|$|R
50|$|Paul's {{solution}} had <b>a</b> curved <b>focal</b> plane, {{but this}} was corrected in the Paul-Baker design, introduced in 1969 by James Gilbert Baker. The Paul-Baker design adds extra spacing and reshapes the secondary to elliptical, which corrects field curvature to obtain <b>a</b> flat <b>focal</b> plane.|$|R

There are also a number of statues, ornaments, tubs of small trees, and flowers.|$|E
5|$|Granny {{was also}} used as <b>a</b> <b>focal</b> point of {{environmental}} efforts {{that resulted in the}} Endangered Species Act protections for orca. Environmentalists estimate that Granny may have had a PCB load of up to 100 parts per million, and that her descendants' reproductive systems may have been damaged by exposure to pollution. Additionally, declining West Coast salmon populations put Granny and her family at risk.|$|E
5|$|In Victorian times Camberwell Road was <b>a</b> <b>focal</b> {{point of}} South London's Music hall scene, {{with a number}} of music halls opening from the 1850s onwards. Following the advent of the cinema and later of television, the music halls fell into decline, with the last closing in 1956. Nearby Orpheus Street marks the site of the Metropole Music Hall.|$|E

40|$|Microphone arrays {{offer the}} {{potential}} of obtaining a high-quality speech signal from a remote talker in a noisy, multi-source environment. In many important applications, sources of interest may be located anywhere within <b>a</b> large <b>focal</b> area and thus it is desirable that an array's performance be uniform over that area. In this paper, simulated and measured results are presented indicating the performances of representative small and large aperture arrays at various points in <b>a</b> large <b>focal</b> area. From these results, {{it is clear that}} uniformity over <b>a</b> large <b>focal</b> area is <b>an</b> advantage of largeaperture arrays...|$|R

The city was <b>a</b> <b>focal</b> point for colonization 200 {{years before the}} present game, but when colonization efforts failed in the main continent of Ulbuka, the nation fell in population and shifted to trade as a focus. Now colonization has begun once again, and players are free to explore the region.|$|E

The museum's model has been emulated in numerous other cities around the country, including Boston, Los Angeles, and Philadelphia.|$|E

5|$|The {{layout of}} the village largely {{originates}} from manorial times, but during the 19th century the village grew to become a substantial industrial community with lead mining and a cotton mill as the main sources of employment.

5|$|After {{aftershocks}} {{from the}} quake had concluded, examination took place, producing <b>a</b> <b>focal</b> {{solution to the}} small events. Movement of these shocks {{was similar to that}} of previous earthquakes around the Azores. For these earthquakes, scientists had determined that the conjugate nodal plane was responsible, seeing shearing on the right-lateral (dextral) side. All faulting in this area is strike-slip-oriented, and on a rather large scale. Because of this research, information now points towards Azores volcanism being controlled by earthquake movement.|$|E
5|$|After {{the active}} {{portion of a}} seizure (the ictal state) there is {{typically}} a period of recovery during which there is confusion, {{referred to as the}} postictal period before a normal level of consciousness returns. It usually lasts 3 to 15 minutes but may last for hours. Other common symptoms include feeling tired, headache, difficulty speaking, and abnormal behavior. Psychosis after a seizure is relatively common, occurring in 6–10% of people. Often people do not remember what happened during this time. Localized weakness, known as Todd's paralysis, may also occur after <b>a</b> <b>focal</b> seizure. When it occurs it typically lasts for seconds to minutes but may rarely last for a day or two.|$|E

5|$|Ann Arbor {{was founded}} in 1824, named for wives of the village's founders and the stands of Bur Oak trees. The University of Michigan moved from Detroit to Ann Arbor in 1837, and the city grew at a rapid rate {{in the early to}} mid-20th century. During the 1960s and 1970s, the city gained a {{reputation}} as a center for left-wing politics. Ann Arbor became <b>a</b> <b>focal</b> point for political activism and anti-Vietnam War movement, as well as various student movements.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{long period}} of decline, the house was {{purchased}} in the 1980s by a group of local residents and restored as part of its conversion to offices. It became <b>a</b> <b>focal</b> point for Ickenham during the biennial Ickenham Festival when the grounds were used to host the main gala day, until the house's new owners restricted access in 2014. Swakeleys is open in part once a year to the public as part of Open House London. Planning permission was granted in 2014 for the conversion of the house to form one large, residential property.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, the {{new owner}} of Swakeleys, CES Properties (Ickenham), {{received}} planning permission from Hillingdon Council to convert the house back into a single large residence, including 23 en-suite bedrooms, a party pavilion and a stable. CES Properties placed restrictions on the staging of the Ickenham Festival that year, leading to the festival's organising committee relocating its planned gala day and evening events to the nearby Vyners School. The festival had previously used {{the grounds of the}} house as <b>a</b> <b>focal</b> point for events. CES Properties placed the house up for sale in February 2015 for £45 million.|$|E
