50|$|Agricultural cooperatives or farmers' cooperatives are cooperatives where farmers pool their {{resources}} for mutual economic benefit. Agricultural cooperatives are broadly divided into agricultural service cooperatives, which provide various services to their individual farming members, and <b>agricultural</b> <b>production</b> <b>cooperatives,</b> where <b>production</b> {{resources such as}} land or machinery are pooled and members farm jointly. Known examples of <b>agricultural</b> <b>production</b> <b>cooperatives</b> are the cranberry-and-grapefruit cooperative Ocean Spray, collective farms in socialist states and the kibbutzim in Israel.|$|R
40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{foundations of}} the social subject of labor have been studied {{as well as the}} methodological approach in view of the quantitative measurement of its level. The essence of the category “sociological structure of production relations” is specified and the concept “social subject of labor” is defined on this basis. A statistical mathematical model is elaborated for quantitative measurement of the stage of development of the social relations in the <b>agricultural</b> <b>production</b> <b>cooperatives.</b> This model was applied by 110 farmers, members of 10 <b>agricultural</b> <b>production</b> <b>cooperatives.</b> ...|$|R
50|$|An {{agricultural}} cooperative, {{also known}} as a farmers' co-op, is a cooperative where farmers pool their resources in certain areas of activity.A broad typology of agricultural cooperatives distinguishes between agricultural service cooperatives, which provide various services to their individually farming members, and <b>agricultural</b> <b>production</b> <b>cooperatives,</b> where <b>production</b> resources (land, machinery) are pooled and members farm jointly. Examples of <b>agricultural</b> <b>production</b> <b>cooperatives</b> include collective farms in former socialist countries, the kibbutzim in Israel, collectively governed community shared agriculture, Longo Mai co-operatives and Nicaraguan production co-operatives.|$|R

5000|$|As {{a result}} of land reform {{following}} World War I the land within the village was broken up into smaller parcels. In further land reform following World War II 621 families were allotted 1800 kilo-hectares. The 1950s saw the collectivization and privatization of the village’s agricultural lands. Private land ownership was reinstated during the transition from socialism in 1993-1994 and the collective {{was replaced by a}} 20 member <b>agricultural</b> <b>production</b> <b>cooperative.</b>|$|E
50|$|Horticulture {{accounts}} for 10.2% {{of the total}} agricultural output. Grain farming, potatoes growing and vegetable farming {{are the most important}} sectors. Total grain output in 2013 was 165,700 tons (in weight after processing). Crop yield amounted to 21.5dt/ha. The major grain producers are Lenin Collective Farm (Zhukov District), SKhA Moscow (collective farm) (Borovsk District), Tsvetkov Plemzavod OAO (Maloyaroslavets District), Mayak Collective Farm (Peremyshl District), and Agroresurs OOO (Sukhinichi District). The highest grain crop yield (10,764 tons) was harvested in Mosmedynagroprom OAO (Medyn District). Total output in 2013: potatoes - 335,400 tons, field vegetables - 98,000 tons, greenhouse vegetables - 6,600 tons. Potatoes yield - 144.0 dt/ha, field vegetables yield -178.0 dt/ha. The major potatoes producers are Aurora OOO (Babynino District), Slavyansky Kartofel OOO (Duminichi District), Ordzhonikidze Kolkhoz ZAO (Kozelsk District), Rodina FSUAE (Maloyaroslavets District), Marx <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Production</b> <b>Cooperative</b> and Rus <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Production</b> <b>Cooperative</b> (Khvastovichi District), Mayak Collective Farm and Kaluzhskaya Niva OOO (Peremyshl District).

40|$|A self-managed {{cooperative}} is conceptually {{defined as}} an organization owned and managed by workers. This mode of production assumes an urgent relevance in light of ongoing challenges posed by global neoliberal capitalism. This study endeavours to historicize the shift towards non-traditional agricultural exports (NTAEs) in the operations of self-managed <b>agricultural</b> <b>production</b> <b>cooperatives</b> in Costa Rica; explore the social relations of production apparent in two case studies; and situate the reorientation of cooperative agriculture and transformation of cooperative labour {{within the context of}} global neoliberal capitalism. Through an ethnographic investigation of two self-managed <b>agricultural</b> <b>production</b> <b>cooperatives,</b> this investigation seeks to link daily realities to prevailing socioeconomic structures. Findings suggest that self-managed <b>agricultural</b> <b>production</b> <b>cooperatives</b> in Costa Rica have assimilated the NTAE imperative of the state and capital and have concurrently intensified the employment of hired workers from outside cooperative membership in apparent conflict with the tenet of worker self-management...|$|R

50|$|LRF {{was created}} in 1971 by fusion of two {{organisation}}s: Riksförbundet Landsbygdens folk (RLF), an organisation for farmers founded in 1929, and Sveriges Lantbruksförbund (SL), an organisation for <b>agricultural</b> <b>production</b> <b>cooperatives</b> founded in 1940, and which had a background in Sveriges Allmänna Lantbrukssällskap (SAL), founded in 1917.|$|R
50|$|In 1953, during , several hoteliers {{fled to the}} West {{and others}} were arrested. After this action, all hotels on the island were {{taken over by the}} Free German Trade Union Federation (FDGB). In the fifties, the museum and the Gerhart Hauptmann House were opened, and the Dornbusch <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Production</b> <b>Cooperative</b> (LPG) was founded. In 1962, the {{building}} of the dyke between Kloster and Vitte began. The cooperative shipping company was taken over by the Weiße Flotte and the fishermen integrated into the Fishery Production Cooperative of Marine and Coastal Fishermen De Süder branch in Neuendorf and Swantevit branch in Vitte.|$|E
5000|$|As a {{collective}} farm, a kolkhoz was legally organized as a production cooperative. The Standard Charter of a kolkhoz, which {{since the early}} 1930s had the force of law in the USSR, {{is a model of}} cooperative principles in print. It speaks of the kolkhoz as a [...] "form of <b>agricultural</b> <b>production</b> <b>cooperative</b> of peasants that voluntarily unite for the purpose of joint agricultural production based on ... collective labor". It asserts that [...] "the kolkhoz is managed according to the principles of socialist self-management, democracy, and openness, with active participation of the members in decisions concerning all aspects of internal life".|$|E
50|$|Another type of <b>agricultural</b> <b>production</b> <b>cooperative</b> in Cuba is UBPC - Unidad Básica de Producción Cooperativa (Basic Unit of Cooperative Production). The law {{authorizing the}} {{creation}} of UBPCs was passed on 20 September 1993. It {{has been used to}} transform many state farms into UBPCs, similar to the transformation of Russian sovkhozes (state farms) into kolkhozes (collective farms) since 1992. The law granted indefinite usufruct to the workers of the UBPC in line with its goal of linking the workers to the land. It established material incentives for increased production by tying workers' earnings to the overall production of the UBPC, and increased managerial autonomy and workers' participation in the management of the workplace.|$|E
30|$|Traditionally, much of APP is {{concentrated}} {{on a single}} company and {{may not always be}} focused on the cooperation among a set of production plants. Currently, many types of products are manufactured by cooperation of several producers. This means that most of plants use the various site production facilities in order to make economic competitive advantages. It is possible that particular segment of a family product is produced in different sites. The events like defection of device, the absence of operator, lack of expert work force can be of the reasons of allocation to different sites or plants. For example, <b>agricultural</b> <b>production</b> <b>cooperatives,</b> also called farmers co-ops, are activities in which a group of farmers that pool resources to improve their productivity and responsiveness to market demands (Cobia 1989). Several successful benchmarks of <b>agricultural</b> <b>production</b> <b>cooperatives</b> exist around the world such as Longo Mai cooperatives, Kibbutzim and Nicaraguan <b>production</b> <b>cooperatives</b> (Ruben and Lerman 2005).|$|R
50|$|There {{were several}} times {{of changes in}} {{ownership}} and control over land in China. Regarding rural land, these changes began {{with the establishment of}} the Higher <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Production</b> <b>Cooperatives</b> in 1956. Thereafter rural private land ownership was effectively abolished through Land Reform, which left land {{in the hands of the}} state or the collective.|$|R

50|$|Klump grew up {{the third}} of five {{siblings}} in Groß-Linichen, then a small village between Stettin and Bromberg in Pomerania. Her father was a small-scale farmer and tradesman. With the intensification of ethnic cleansing during 1945 the family fled on a hospital train, ending up in Glöwen, which after May found itself in the Soviet occupation zone in what remained of Germany. In October 1949 the area under Soviet administration was relaunched as a stand-alone Soviet sponsored state with its economic and political structures consciously modeled on those in the Soviet Union. Klump's father participated in the land ownership reforms, taking on leadership of the Landwirtschaftliche Produktionsgenossenschaft (LPG <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Production</b> <b>Cooperative)</b> in Glöwen.|$|E
5000|$|Carter visited Cuba in May 2002 and had full {{discussions with}} Fidel Castro and the Cuban government. He {{was allowed to}} address the Cuban public uncensored on {{national}} television and radio with a speech that he wrote and presented in Spanish. In the speech, he called on the US to end [...] "an ineffective 43-year-old economic embargo" [...] and on Castro to hold free elections, improve human rights, and allow greater civil liberties. He met with political dissidents; visited the AIDS sanitarium, a medical school, a biotech facility, an <b>agricultural</b> <b>production</b> <b>cooperative,</b> and a school for disabled children; and threw a pitch for an all-star baseball game in Havana. The visit made Carter the first President of the United States, {{in or out of}} office, to visit the island since the Cuban revolution of 1959.

50|$|An 18 m tall {{observation}} tower was opened in May 1883 by the Marienberg {{branch of the}} Ore Mountain Club, founded in 1878. It had been constructed by Maschinenfabrik C. Reinsch, Dresden, {{at a cost of}} 6000 Mark. In 1884 the tower was named Prinzeß-Marien-Turm after the wife of then Prince Georg of Saxony. It became a popular touristic destination, so that in 1886 Gustav Loose, a member of the Marienberg branch of the Ore Mountain Club, opened a restaurant in the nearby mining office (Huthaus) Alte Drei Brüder which had been erected in 1853/1854. The mountain restaurant Dreibrüderhöhe remained property of the Loose family until 1977, when it was sold to Gebäudewirtschaft Marienberg (the municipal real estate management) who operated it until 1985. It then passed {{into the hands of the}} Marienberg <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Production</b> <b>Cooperative</b> who sold it in 1992. In 1992/1993 it was rebuilt into a hotel (Berghotel Drei Brüder Höhe).|$|E
50|$|Today, {{there are}} several forms of <b>agricultural</b> <b>production,</b> {{including}} <b>cooperatives</b> such as UBPCs (Unidad Básica de Producción Cooperativa) and CPAs (Cooperativa de Producción Agropecuaria).|$|R
5000|$|In {{the initial}} years that {{followed}} the Cuban Revolution, government authorities experimented with <b>agricultural</b> and farming <b>production</b> <b>cooperatives.</b> Between 1977 and 1983, farmers began to collectivize into CPAs - [...] (<b>Agricultural</b> <b>Production</b> <b>Cooperatives).</b> Farmers were encouraged to sell their land to the state {{for the establishment of}} a cooperative farm, receiving payments for a period of 20 years while also sharing in the fruits of the CPA. Joining a CPA allowed individuals who were previously dispersed throughout the countryside to move to a centralized location with increased access to electricity, medical care, housing, and schools. Democratic practice tends to be limited to business decisions and is constrained by the centralized economic planning of the Cuban system.|$|R

Thus, the cooperatives transformed in a very hostile situation. They survived, and some prospered, yet, in general, they remain vulnerable to adverse economic developments.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{identify}} the fundamental factors that are key determinants in promoting effective operation of <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Production</b> <b>Cooperatives</b> (APCs). A theoretical framework "determinants of APCs' performance" was used to analyze the links between the webs of factors. A survey method was used to collect data from two southern provinces in Iran. Data were collected from 52 managers and 260 member farmers in 52 APCs using a stratified random sampling method. It is concluded that the theoretical model can to a great extent predict the performance of APCs. Cooperative structure and government support factors are the most important factors explaining the performance of APCs. Also, policy strategies need to focus on conditioning variables that affect the performance of APCs. Copyright 2005 International Association of Agricultural Economics. ...|$|R
