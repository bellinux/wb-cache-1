5000|$|Xunlei is {{different}} from P2P tools in {{that it does not}} support <b>active</b> <b>file</b> sharing. While copyright advocates view Xunlei as a P2P tool that facilitates copyright violation, P2P advocates criticize Xunlei as a leech with much more downloading than uploading. Also it is often observed that Xunlei prioritizes file sharing with Xunlei users rather than other client users. Many pure P2P tools have blocked Xunlei, although this trend weakened after Xunlei began balancing the number of downloads and uploads.|$|E

Other partitions may exist on the HDD {{that may or may}} not be visible as drives, such as recovery partitions or partitions with diagnostic tools or data.

A file domain is composed of any number of block devices, which could be partitions, LVM or LSM devices. A file set is a logical file system created in a single file domain. Administrators can add or remove volumes from an <b>active</b> <b>file</b> domain, providing that there is enough space on the remaining file domain, in case of removal. This {{was one of the}} trickier original features to implement because all data or metadata residing on the disk being removed had to first be migrated, online, to other disks, prior to removal.|$|E

With the present day demand for continuous access to data, backup has to be taken of an <b>active</b> <b>file</b> system, putting the consistency of the backup copy at risk. We propose a scheme to take a consistent backup of an <b>active</b> <b>file</b> system assuming that the file system supports transactions. We take into consideration that file operations include, besides reading and writing of files, directory operations, file descriptor operations and operations such as append, truncate, etc. We are putting our scheme into a formal framework to prove its correctness and we have devised algorithms for implementing the scheme. We intend to simulate the algorithms and run experiments to help tune the algorithms...|$|E

40|$|A key {{distinction}} between some models of IPO pricing (e. g., auctions and bookbuilding) and others (e. g., fixed-priced models) is whether price discovery {{occurs in the}} primary or secondary market. Higher investment bank reputation is associated with 1) more <b>active</b> <b>filing</b> price revisions and 2) reduced secondary market volatility, indicating greater resolution of uncertainty before trading begins. Revisions of nonreputable banks cluster on exactly zero dollars. Finally, the "partial adjustment" phenomenon [...] often attributed to information aggregation [...] is primarily due to the behavior of reputable underwriters.

50|$|From the start, the NetWare design {{focused on}} servers with copious amounts of RAM. The entire file {{allocation}} table (FAT) was read into RAM when a volume was mounted, thereby requiring a minimum amount of RAM proportional to online disk space; adding a disk to a server would often require a RAM upgrade as well. Unlike most competing network operating systems prior to Windows NT, NetWare automatically used all otherwise unused RAM for caching <b>active</b> <b>files,</b> employing delayed write-backs to facilitate re-ordering of disk requests (elevator seeks). An unexpected shutdown could therefore corrupt data, making an uninterruptible power supply practically a mandatory part of a server installation.|$|R

3000|$|Equation 9 {{is derived}} {{considering}} that the Web Browsing service sessions in the WLAN {{are not able to}} constitute a virtual [...] " [...] long-live" [...] TCP session. An <b>active</b> <b>File</b> Transfer service session can be considered as one [...] "long-live" [...] TCP session. As the value of encp is smaller than the number of File Transfer service sessions plus one, it means that, by neglecting the File Transfer service sessions, the Web Browsing service sessions cannot make the value of encp {{greater than or equal to}} one. Such result indicates that, on average, there is less than one Web Browsing service packet in contention to access the network channel at any time. Therefore, from a Web Browsing service session's point of view, during the ON period, the major competition it will face is from the <b>active</b> <b>File</b> Transfer service sessions rather than the peer Web Browsing service sessions.

To investigate this, we asked 289 participants to retrieve 1, 109 of their own <b>active</b> <b>files.</b> We analyzed the 4, 948 resulting retrieval steps, i. e. moves through the hierarchical folder tree. Results show: (a) significant differences in overall retrieval time between PC and Mac that arise from different organizational strategies rather than interface design; (b) the default Windows presentation is suboptimal - if changed, retrieval time could be reduced substantially and (c) contrary to our expectations, folder depth did not affect step duration. We discuss possible reasons for these results and suggest directions for future research...|$|R
40|$|Transparent file {{compression}} systems handle {{file compression}} and decompression of files automatically; they are thus transparent to users. The cost of many transparent file system compression schemes, however, is that file accesses require substantial processor time for compression and decompression.
