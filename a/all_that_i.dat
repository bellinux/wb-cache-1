25|$|Simply put, this {{legislation}} ensures that we respect our obligations under Geneva, recognizes the President's constitutional authority to interpret treaties, and brings accountability and transparency {{to the process}} of interpretation by ensuring that the executive's interpretation is made public. I would note that there has been opposition to {{this legislation}} from some quarters, including the New York Times editorial page. Without getting into a point-by-point rebuttal here on the floor, I would simply say that I have been reading the Congressional Record trying to find the bill that page so vociferously denounced. The hyperbolic attack is aimed not at any bill this body is today debating, nor even at the Administration's original position. I can only presume that some would prefer that Congress simply ignore the Hamdan decision, and pass no legislation at <b>all.</b> <b>That,</b> <b>I</b> suggest to my colleagues, would be a travesty.|$|E
25|$|Evan-Thomas {{continued}} {{to suffer from}} illness while in the Mediterranean, and in 1894 received sick leave to return to England. While he was indeed ill, the leave was also granted {{to allow him to}} formally propose to and marry Hilda Barnard, who he had intended to marry immediately before his unexpected posting to the Mediterranean. The wedding took place on 18 July 1894 at St. Saviours Church, Walton Place, Knightsbridge. In November the couple moved to Valletta on Malta where the fleet was based. Social life on Malta remained impressive, with royalty and other dignitaries stopping at Malta and being entertained at Admiralty House. Evan-Thomas' term in the Mediterranean ceased in December 1896. Culme-Seymour wrote that 'he has great tact and judgement - a thorough knowledge of his duties (signal and otherwise) and both with the fleet in the summer at sea and on shore in Malta has been <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could wish'. On 1 January 1897 he was promoted to commander.|$|E

500|$|Yeats had {{a life-long}} {{interest}} in mysticism, spiritualism, occultism and astrology. He read {{extensively on the}} subjects throughout his life, {{became a member of}} the paranormal research organisation [...] "The Ghost Club" [...] (in 1911) and was especially influenced by the writings of Emanuel Swedenborg. As early as 1892, he wrote: [...] "If I had not made magic my constant study I could not have written a single word of my Blake book, nor would The Countess Kathleen ever have come to exist. The mystical life is the centre of <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> do and <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> think and <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> write." [...] His mystical interests—also inspired by a study of Hinduism, under the Theosophist Mohini Chatterjee, and the occult—formed much of the basis of his late poetry. Some critics disparaged this aspect of Yeats's work; W. H. Auden called it the [...] "deplorable spectacle of a grown man occupied with the mumbo-jumbo of magic and the nonsense of India." ...|$|E

[...] "Trainfire", a classic country–style song inspired by Elvis Presley's cover of [...] "Mystery Train", addresses Townsend's former addiction to pornography, which he described as [...] "this crazy, crack cocaine on the internet that nobody wants to talk about." [...] The song continues the album's theme of honesty and self-acceptance, both about pornography and musical tastes. Townsend explained the song's musical style, saying [...] "yes, I like heavy music and am good at making it, {{but that is not}} <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> listen to, and that is not <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> want to play." ...|$|E
500|$|In a 1926 article {{written for}} the NEA News Service, he responded to those who asked him how the [...] "Shaughnessy System" [...] worked so well.

[...] "I had everything a man could want: leisure, enough money, a wonderful family. Yet with <b>all</b> <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> was eating my heart out."

500|$|The opening {{lines of}} [...] "XO" [...] are echo-laden and in {{contrast}} to other songs on Beyoncé, the ballad contains several hooks. Beyoncé starts the song by asking a loved one to kiss her. Some of the ascending chorus lines are call and response; Beyoncé is backed by a sing-along crowd as she sings about how her [...] "darkest nights" [...] are enlightened by the lover's face: [...] "In the darkest night hour / I search through the crowd / Your face is <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> see / I give you everything". The chorus ends with the singer adding, [...] "Baby love me, lights out", with a croak in her voice.|$|E

During a trip to Lake Biel, Hański went to arrange lunch, leaving his wife and Balzac alone. In the shade of a large oak tree, they kissed and exchanged vows of patience and fidelity. She told him of the family's plan to visit Geneva for Christmas; Balzac agreed to visit {{before the end of the}} year. Before he left Nauchâtel, she sent a passionate letter to his hotel: [...] "Villain! Did you not see in my eyes <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> longed for?

500|$|The long-held view is {{that the}} Empress {{accepted}} the circumscribed role in which she found herself, and that her life, duty and purpose were tied to her position as the Emperor's wife. However, her personal letters reveal that she could be strongheaded, sometimes at odds with her husband, and had a life of her own—albeit somewhat restricted. In a letter written on 2 May 1845 she stated: [...] "I wait for the moment when we will meet, good Pedro, and seek forgiveness for <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> did to you during these days." [...] In another letter of 24 January 1851, she acknowledged her difficult temperament: [...] "I am not irritated at you [...] and you should forgive me because this is my character." ...|$|E

500|$|Nurmi {{was more}} {{responsive}} to his fellow athletes than to the media. He exchanged ideas with sprinter Charley Paddock and even trained with his rival Otto Peltzer. Nurmi told Peltzer to forget his opponents: [...] "Conquering yourself is the greatest challenge of an athlete." [...] Nurmi was known to {{emphasize the importance of}} psychological strength: [...] "Mind is everything; muscle, pieces of rubber. <b>All</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am, I am because of my mind." [...] Regarding Nurmi's track antics, Peltzer found that [...] "in his impenetrability he was a Buddha gliding on the track. Stopwatch in hand, lap after lap, he ran towards the tape, subject only to the laws of a mathematical table." [...] Marathoner Johnny Kelley, who first met his idol at the 1936 Olympics, said that while Nurmi appeared cold to him at first, the two chatted for quite a while after Nurmi had asked for his name: [...] "He grabbed ahold of me— he was so excited. I couldn't believe it!" ...|$|E
500|$|Writing {{began in}} late 2009, when the American singer Holly Hafermann resided at the Artula Retreat in Bandon, Oregon, and {{composed}} songs. Later, in New York City, under her new stage name Skylar Grey, she visited her Universal Music publisher, Jennifer Blakeman, {{to seek help}} presenting her work; Blakeman suggested she collaborate with Alex da Kid. The producer emailed Grey his track, which suggested a theme of abusive romantic relationships {{to her as she}} spontaneously sang lyrics to the melody. She told the Los Angeles Times that she was in an abusive relationship with the music industry: [...] "I love it so much, and I give it <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have, yet it beats me down." [...] This idea inspired her writing, a process she found came naturally, as if she were creating an alternative pop song for herself. She wrote the chorus to [...] "Love the Way You Lie" [...] in fifteenminutes and recorded vocals for Alex da Kid's demo.|$|E
