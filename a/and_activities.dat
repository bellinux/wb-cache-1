These functions {{can be used}} {{to assess the impact of}} agricultural practices on sustainable crop production. In this five-year study, the effect of various agricultural practices on soil microbial diversity <b>and</b> <b>activity</b> was investigated in a summer rainfall area under South African dryland conditions. Microbial diversity <b>and</b> <b>activity</b> were measured in the 0 – 15 cm layer of a field trial consisting of two fertilizer levels, three cropping systems, and two tillage systems. Using the Shannon–Weaver and Evenness diversity indices, soil microbial species richness and abundance were measured. Microbial enzymatic activities: β-glucosidase, phosphatase and urease, were used to evaluate ecosystem functioning. Cluster analysis revealed a shift in soil microbial community diversity <b>and</b> <b>activity</b> over time. Microbial diversity <b>and</b> <b>activity</b> were higher under no-till than conventional tillage. Fertilizer levels seemed to play a minor role in determining microbial diversity <b>and</b> <b>activity,</b> whereas the cropping systems played a more important role in determining the activity of soil microbial communities.

40|$|With {{the recent}} {{overwhelming}} evidences that solar cycle <b>and</b> <b>activity</b> phenomena strongly influence the earth’s environment and climate (Hiremath 2009 a and references there in), {{it is necessary}} to understand physics of the solar cycle <b>and</b> <b>activity</b> phenomena.

40|$|Overweight and {{depressed}} mood {{are more common}} in knee osteoarthritis (OA) than in the general popula-tion [1 - 3], and are both positively associated with pain <b>and</b> <b>activity</b> limitations [4 - 13]. There is growing evi-dence that overweight, as indicated by body-mass index (BMI) ≥ 25 kg/m 2, {{and depressed}} mood are interrelated [14, 15], and that common biological and psychological mechanisms underlie the development of both overweight and depressed mood [16]. Therefore, the question arises whether BMI and depressed mood are independently as-sociated with pain <b>and</b> <b>activity</b> limitations in knee OA. This information may guide the design of interventions targeting bodyweight or depressed mood {{as a means to}} improve pain <b>and</b> <b>activity</b> limitations in knee OA. Two studies that examined a broad set of determi-nants of pain <b>and</b> <b>activity</b> limitations in patients with knee OA found that BMI and depressed mood were in-dependently associated with pain <b>and</b> <b>activity</b> limitation...|$|R
40|$|Background: Cathepsin L (CatL) is a {{cysteine}} protease {{with strong}} matrix degradation activity {{that contributes to}} photoaging. Mannose phosphate-independent sorting pathways mediate ultraviolet A (UVA) -induced alternate trafficking of CatL. Little is known about signaling pathways involved in the regulation of UVA-induced CatL expression <b>and</b> <b>activity.</b> This study aims to investigate whether a single UVA irradiation affects CatL expression <b>and</b> <b>activity</b> <b>and</b> whether mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) /activator protein- 1 (AP- 1) pathway {{is involved in the}} regulation of UVA-induced CatL expression <b>and</b> <b>activity</b> in human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs). Methods: Primary HDFs were exposed to UVA. Cell proliferation was determined by a cell counting kit. UVA-induced CatL production <b>and</b> <b>activity</b> were studied with quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western blotting, and fluorimetric assay in cell lysates collected on three consecutive days after irradiation. Time courses of UVA-activated JNK and p 38 MAPK signaling were examined by Western blotting. Effects of MAPK inhibitors and knockdown of Jun and Fos on UVA-induced CatL expression <b>and</b> <b>activity</b> were investigated by RT-PCR, Western blotting, and fluorimetric assay. Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance. Results: UVA significantly increased CatL gene expression, protein abundance, <b>and</b> enzymatic <b>activity</b> for three consecutive days after irradiation (F = 83. 11, 56. 14, and 71. 19, respectively; all P < 0. 05). Further investigation demonstrated phosphorylation of JNK and p 38 MAPK activated by UVA. Importantly, inactivation of JNK pathway significantly decreased UVA-induced CatL expression <b>and</b> <b>activity,</b> which were not affected by p 38 MAPK inhibition. Moreover, knockdown of Jun and Fos significantly attenuated basal and UVA-induced CatL expression <b>and</b> <b>activity.</b> Conclusions: UVA enhances CatL production <b>and</b> <b>activity</b> in HDFs, probably by activating JNK and downstreaming AP- 1. These findings provide a new possible molecular approach for antiphotoaging therapy...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To {{summarize}} {{recent studies}} on {{risk factors for}} functional decline (i. e. worsening of pain <b>and</b> <b>activity</b> limitations) in osteoarthritis of the hip or knee; after {{a long period of}} neglect, information on risk factors for functional decline has markedly improved in recent years. RECENT FINDINGS: Studies show slow worsening of pain <b>and</b> <b>activity</b> limitations over time. There is a considerable between-individual variation in the course of pain <b>and</b> <b>activity</b> limitations; identification of risk factors for functional decline is therefore highly relevant. Risk factors for functional decline include characteristic physical impairments in osteoarthritis (pain, stiffness, reduced muscle strength, laxity of the knee joint, proprioceptive inaccuracy, poor standing balance and impaired range of joint motion), cognitive and visual impairments, comorbidity and overweight, psychological and social factors (anxiety, depression, fatigue, poor self-efficacy and social support), health behaviors and sociodemographic factors. SUMMARY: The information on risk factors can be used pragmatically to construct prediction rules on functional decline in osteoarthritis patients. Both clinicians and patients value the ability to prognosticate future pain <b>and</b> <b>activity</b> limitations. Furthermore, the information on risk factors can be used to construct causative models to explain pain <b>and</b> <b>activity</b> limitations: examples include 'instability of joints' and 'avoidance of activity' as causal mechanism of pain <b>and</b> <b>activity</b> limitations. Improved understanding of pain <b>and</b> <b>activity</b> limitations is the basis for improved treatment and rehabilitation of osteoarthritis patient...|$|R

40|$|Background: Various diet- and activity-related {{parenting}} {{practices are}} positive determinants of child dietary <b>and</b> <b>activity</b> behaviour, including home availability, parental modelling and parental policies. There {{is evidence that}} parenting practices cluster within the dietary domain <b>and</b> within the <b>activity</b> domain. This study explores whether diet- and activity-related parenting practices cluster across the dietary <b>and</b> <b>activity</b> domain. Also examined is whether the clusters are related to child and parental background characteristics. Finally, to indicate {{the relevance of the}} clusters in influencing child dietary <b>and</b> <b>activity</b> behaviour, we examined whether clusters of parenting practices are related to these behaviours. Methods: Data were used from 1480 parent-child dyads participating in the Dutch IVO Nutrition <b>and</b> Physical <b>Activity</b> Child cohorT (INPACT). Parents of children aged 8 - 11 years completed questionnaires at home assessing their diet- and activity-related parenting practices, child and parental background characteristics, and child dietary <b>and</b> <b>activity</b> behaviours. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to identify clusters of parenting practices. Backward regression analysis was used {{to examine the relationship between}} child and parental background characteristics with cluster scores, and partial correlations to examine associations between cluster scores and child dietary <b>and</b> <b>activity</b> behaviours. Results: PCA revealed five clusters of parenting practices: 1) high visibility and accessibility of screens and unhealthy food, 2) diet- and activity-related rules, 3) low availability of unhealthy food, 4) diet- and activity-related positive modelling, and 5) positive modelling on sports and fruit. Low parental education was associated with unhealthy cluster 1, while high(er) education was associated with healthy clusters 2, 3 and 5. Separate clusters were related to both child dietary <b>and</b> <b>activity</b> behaviour in the hypothesized directions: healthy clusters were positively related to obesity-reducing behaviours and negatively to obesity-inducing behaviours. Conclusion: Parenting practices cluster across the dietary <b>and</b> <b>activity</b> domain. Parental education can be seen as an indicator of a broader parental context in which clusters of parenting practices operate. Separate clusters are related to both child dietary <b>and</b> <b>activity</b> behaviour. Interventions that focus on clusters of parenting practices to assist parents (especially low-educated parents) in changing their child's dietary <b>and</b> <b>activity</b> behaviour seems justified...|$|R
