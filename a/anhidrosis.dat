50|$|Type 4, {{congenital}} insensitivity to {{pain with}} <b>anhidrosis</b> (CIPA), is an autosomal recessive condition and affected infants present with episodes of hyperthermia unrelated to environmental temperature, <b>anhidrosis</b> and insensitivity to pain. Palmar skin is thickened and charcot joints are commonly present. NCV shows motor and sensory nerve action potentials to be normal. The histopathology of peripheral nerve biopsy reveals absent small unmyelinated fibers and mitochondria are abnormally enlarged.|$|E
50|$|Ross' {{syndrome}} {{consists of}} Adie's syndrome (myotonic pupils and absent deep tendon reflexes) plus segmental <b>anhidrosis</b> (typically associated with compensatory hyperhidrosis).|$|E
50|$|Congenital {{insensitivity}} to {{pain with}} <b>anhidrosis</b> (CIPA), {{also known as}} hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type IV (HSAN IV), is characterized by insensitivity to pain, <b>anhidrosis</b> (the inability to sweat), and intellectual disability. The ability to sense all pain (including visceral pain) is absent, resulting in repeated injuries including: oral self-mutilation (biting of tongue, lips, and buccal mucosa); biting of fingertips; bruising, scarring, and infection of the skin; multiple bone fractures (many of which fail to heal properly); and recurrent joint dislocations resulting in joint deformity. Sense of touch, vibration, and position are normal. <b>Anhidrosis</b> predisposes to recurrent febrile episodes that are often the initial manifestation of CIPA. Hypothermia in cold environments also occurs. Intellectual disability of varying degree is observed in most affected individuals; hyperactivity and emotional lability are common.|$|E
50|$|Tropical anhidrotic {{asthenia}} is a skin condition, a rare form of miliaria, with long-lasting poral occlusion, {{which produces}} <b>anhidrosis</b> and heat retention.|$|E
50|$|Congenital {{insensitivity}} to {{pain with}} <b>anhidrosis</b> may be misdiagnosed for leprosy, based on similar symptoms of severe injuries to {{the hands and}} feet.|$|E
5000|$|Treatment of AIGA {{almost always}} {{consists}} of steroid pulse therapy or high-dose oral steroids {{and is not}} consistently effective. Much remains unclear regarding the reasons for recurrent <b>anhidrosis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Occlusion {{miliaria}} is a {{skin condition}} that {{is accompanied by}} <b>anhidrosis</b> and increased heat-stress susceptibility, all after the application of extensive polyethylene film occlusion for 48 hours or longer.|$|E
50|$|Partial Horner's syndrome: In {{case of a}} third-neuron disorder, <b>anhidrosis</b> {{is limited}} to the middle part of the {{forehead}} or can be absent, resulting in a partial Horner's syndrome.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the first}} season episode [...] "The Courier (No. 85)" [...] of the TV series The Blacklist a {{criminal}} transporter (played by Robert Knepper) is diagnosed with congenital <b>anhidrosis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Naloxone is also {{experimentally}} used in {{the treatment}} for congenital insensitivity to pain with <b>anhidrosis,</b> an extremely rare disorder (one in 125 million) that renders one unable to feel pain or differentiate temperatures.|$|E
50|$|Skin biopsies {{are useful}} when <b>anhidrosis</b> occurs {{as part of}} a {{dermatological}} disorder. Biopsy results may reveal the sweat gland destruction, necrosis or fibrosis, in addition to the findings of the primary dermatological disorder.|$|E
50|$|The first sympathectomy was {{performed}} by Alexander in 1889. Thoracic sympathectomy has been indicated for hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating) since 1920, when Kotzareff showed it would cause <b>anhidrosis</b> (total inability to sweat) from the nipple line upwards.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, the {{following}} side effects {{have all been}} reported by patients: Chronic muscular pain, numbness and weakness of the limbs, Horner's Syndrome, <b>anhidrosis</b> (inability to sweat), hyperthermia (exacerbated by <b>anhidrosis</b> and systemic thermoregulatory dysfunction), neuralgia, paraesthesia, fatigue and amotivationality, breathing difficulties, substantially diminished physiological/chemical reaction to internal and environmental experience (e.g. pleasure and pain/ perceptual stimuli), somatosensory malfunction, aberrant physiological reaction to stress and exertion etc., Raynaud’s disease (ironically a possible indication for surgery), reflex hyperhidrosis, altered/erratic blood pressure and circulation, defective fight or flight response system, loss of adrenaline, eczema and other skin conditions resulting from exceptionally dry skin; rhinitis, gustatory sweating (also known as Frey's syndrome).|$|E
50|$|Idiopathic pure sudomotor failure (IPSF) is {{the most}} common cause of a rare {{disorder}} known as acquired idiopathic generalized <b>anhidrosis</b> (AIGA), a clinical syndrome characterized by generalized decrease or absence of sweating without other autonomic and somatic nervous dysfunctions and without persistent organic cutaneous lesions.|$|E
50|$|Congenital neurogenic ptosis is {{believed}} to be caused by the Horner syndrome. In this case, a mild ptosis may be associated with ipsilateral ptosis, iris and areola hypopigmentation and <b>anhidrosis</b> due to the paresis of the Mueller muscle. Acquired Horner syndrome may result after trauma, neoplastic insult, or even vascular disease.|$|E
50|$|Hypohidrosis {{is diminished}} {{sweating}} {{in response to}} appropriate stimuli. While hyperhidrosis is a socially troubling but benign condition, hypohidrosis can lead to hyperthermia, heat exhaustion, heat stroke and potentially death. An extreme case of hypohydrosis {{in which there is}} a complete absence of sweating and the skin is dry is termed <b>anhidrosis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Horner's {{syndrome}} {{is a combination}} of symptoms that arises when a group of nerves known as the sympathetic trunk is damaged. The signs and symptoms occur on the same side as the lesion of the sympathetic trunk. It is characterized by miosis (a constricted pupil), partial ptosis (a weak, droopy eyelid), apparent <b>anhidrosis</b> (decreased sweating), with or without enophthalmos (inset eyeball).|$|E
50|$|The title {{refers to}} a local saying that rare {{diseases}} are like quizzes God gives to humans {{so as not to}} become too arrogant. The first season dealt mostly with inherited rare diseases including porphyria, phenylketonuria, muscular dystrophy, Guillain-Barré syndrome, reflex anoxic seizures and Savant syndrome. Fabry disease, Kleine-Levin syndrome and congenital insensitivity to pain with <b>anhidrosis</b> were featured in the second season.|$|E
50|$|The {{treatment}} options for hypohidrosis and <b>anhidrosis</b> is limited. Those with hypohidrosis should avoid drugs that can aggravate the condition (see medication-causes). They should limit activities that raise the core body temperature and if exercises {{are to be}} performed, they should be supervised and be performed in a cool, sheltered and well-ventilated environment. In instances where the cause is known, treatment should be directed at the primary pathology. In autoimmune diseases, such as Sjogren syndrome and systemic sclerosis, treatment of the underlying disease using immunosuppressive drugs may lead to improvement in hypohidrosis. In neurological diseases, the primary pathology is often irreversible. In these instances, prevention of further neurological damage, such as good glycaemic control in diabetes, {{is the cornerstone of}} management. In acquired generalized <b>anhidrosis,</b> spontaneous remission may be observed in some cases. Numerous cases have been reported to respond effectively to systemic corticosteroids. Although an optimum dose and regime has not been established, pulse methylprednisolone (up to 1000 mg ⁄ day) has been reported to have good effect.|$|E
50|$|Sweat {{is readily}} visualized by a topical {{indicator}} such as iodinated starch or sodium alizarin sulphonate. Both undergo a dramatic colour change when moistened by sweat. A thermoregulatory sweat test evaluates the body’s {{response to a}} thermal stimulus by inducing sweating {{through the use of}} a hot box ⁄ room, thermal blanket or exercise. Failure of the topical indicator to undergo a colour change during thermoregulatory sweat testing can indicate <b>anhidrosis</b> and/or hypohidrosis (see Minor test).|$|E
50|$|To {{improve the}} blood {{circulation}} {{to the upper}} extremities, an anesthetic block of the stellate ganglion is performed. Due to this blockage, in addition to vasodilatation, in the entire innervation area this leads to reduced sweating (<b>anhidrosis)</b> and Horner's syndrome. The latter {{is a sign of}} successful blockade. A temporary blockade of the stellate ganglion is performed for e.g. the treatment of advanced complex regional pain syndrome. Surgical elimination of the stellate ganglion (sympathectomy) is a treatment of last resort for Raynaud's disease.|$|E
50|$|Enophthalmos (recession of the eyeball {{within the}} orbit) {{is the most}} common eye {{abnormality}} observed in Parry-Romberg syndrome. It is caused by a loss of subcutaneous tissue around the orbit. Other common findings include drooping of the eyelid (ptosis), constriction of the pupil (miosis), redness of the conjunctiva, and decreased sweating (<b>anhidrosis)</b> of the affected side of the face. Collectively, these signs are referred to as Horner's syndrome. Other ocular abnormalities include ophthalmoplegia (paralysis of {{one or more of the}} extraocular muscles) and other types of strabismus, uveitis, and heterochromia of the iris.|$|E
50|$|Aside {{from cancer}} general {{symptoms}} such as malaise, fever, weight loss and fatigue, Pancoast tumour can include a complete Horner's syndrome in severe cases: miosis (constriction of the pupils), <b>anhidrosis</b> (lack of sweating), ptosis (drooping of the eyelid) and enophthalmos (sunken eyeball). In progressive cases, the brachial plexus is also affected, causing pain and weakness in {{the muscles of the}} arm and hand with a symptomatology typical of thoracic outlet syndrome. The tumour can also compress the recurrent laryngeal nerve and from this a hoarse voice and bovine cough may occur.|$|E
50|$|This gene encodes {{a member}} of the {{neurotrophic}} tyrosine kinase receptor (NTKR) family. This kinase is a membrane-bound receptor that, upon neurotrophin binding, phosphorylates itself (autophosphorylation) and members of the MAPK pathway. The presence of this kinase leads to cell differentiation and {{may play a role in}} specifying sensory neuron subtypes. Mutations in this gene have been associated with congenital insensitivity to pain with <b>anhidrosis,</b> self-mutilating behavior, mental retardation and cancer. Alternate transcriptional splice variants of this gene have been found, but only three have been characterized to date.|$|E
50|$|When {{caused by}} Horner's syndrome, ptosis is usually {{accompanied}} by miosis and <b>anhidrosis.</b> In this case, the ptosis {{is due to}} the result of interruption innervations to the sympathetic, autonomic Muller's muscle rather than the somatic levator palpebrae superioris muscle. The lid position and pupil size are typically affected by this condition and the ptosis is generally mild, no more than 2 mm. The pupil might be smaller on the affected side. While 4% cocaine instilled to the eyes can confirm the diagnosis of Horner's syndrome, Hydroxyamphetamine eye drops can differentiate the location of the lesion.|$|E
5000|$|Congenital {{insensitivity}} to {{pain with}} <b>anhidrosis</b> (CIPA), also called hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type IV, {{is an extremely}} rare inherited disorder {{of the nervous system}} which prevents the sensation of pain, heat, cold, or any real nerve-related sensations (including feeling the need to urinate); however, patients can still feel pressure. CIPA is the fourth type of hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy (HSAN), known as HSAN IV. (It is also referred to as HSAN Type IV). A person with CIPA cannot feel pain or differentiate even extreme temperatures. [...] "Anhidrosis" [...] means the body does not sweat, and [...] "congenital" [...] indicates that the condition is present from birth.|$|E
50|$|HSAN I must be {{distinguished}} from hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy (HMSN) {{and other types of}} hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies (HSAN II-V). The prominent sensory abnormalities and foot ulcerations are the only signs to separate HSAN I from HMSN. HSAN II can be differentiated from HSAN I as it is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, it has earlier disease onset, the sensory loss is diffused to the whole body, and it has less or no motor symptoms. HSAN III-V can be easily distinguished from HSAN I because of congenital disease onset. Moreover, these types exhibit typical features, such as the predominant autonomic disturbances in HSAN III or congenital loss of pain and <b>anhidrosis</b> in HSAN IV.|$|E
5000|$|A {{much smaller}} number of people are {{insensitive}} to pain due to an inborn abnormality of the nervous system, known as [...] "congenital insensitivity to pain". Children with this condition incur carelessly-repeated damage to their tongues, eyes, joints, skin, and muscles. Some die before adulthood, and others have a reduced life expectancy. Most people with congenital insensitivity to pain have one of five hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies (which includes familial dysautonomia and congenital insensitivity to pain with <b>anhidrosis).</b> These conditions feature decreased sensitivity to pain together with other neurological abnormalities, particularly of the autonomic nervous system. A very rare syndrome with isolated congenital insensitivity to pain has been linked with mutations in the SCN9A gene, which codes for a sodium channel (Nav1.7) necessary in conducting pain nerve stimuli.|$|E
5000|$|In {{an article}} {{entitled}} [...] "ABC's 'Extreme Exploitation'", The Smoking Gun published an e-mail sent on March 10, 2006, from an ABC employee to network affiliates, relaying {{a message from}} the program's casting agent detailing specific tragedies and rare illnesses sought by the show. Included were a [...] "Muscular Dystrophy Child", a [...] "Family who has multiple children w/ Down Syndrome (either adopted or biological)" [...] and a child with Congenital insensitivity to pain with <b>anhidrosis.</b> This last request included a parenthetical remark stating, [...] "There are only 17 known cases in US - let me know if one is in your town!"This e-mail has led some major media networks and blogs to accuse the show of opportunism in seeking out the most sensational stories in a push for higher ratings.|$|E
