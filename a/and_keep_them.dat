5|$|Palahniuk's {{novel was}} optioned by 20th Century Fox {{producer}} Laura Ziskin, who hired Jim Uhls {{to write the}} film adaptation. Fincher {{was one of four}} directors the producers considered, and was selected because of his enthusiasm for the film. Fincher developed the script with Uhls and sought screenwriting advice from the cast and others in the film industry. The director and the cast compared the film to Rebel Without a Cause (1955) and The Graduate (1967). They said its theme was the conflict between a generation of young people and the value system of advertising. The director copied the homoerotic overtones from Palahniuk's novel to make audiences uncomfortable <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> from anticipating the twist ending.|$|E
5|$|The use of wool in {{the uniform}} {{meant that the}} uniforms were not suited to the warm climates that were common in the South. This contributed to many Confederate {{soldiers}} suffering from heatstroke on long marches. However, one understanding of the heavy woolen garments is that after the marching during the day time, when the soldiers would rest at night and cool themselves down, the thermal-shock could render some men unable to function the next day. As such, the woolen garments would protect the soldiers from this, <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> able to keep marching {{the next day to}} fulfill their duties. This was also the case with the better equipped U.S. Army. Many Confederate soldiers started the war with frock coats. However, cloth shortages and wartime wear insured that, by 1863, waist-length cadet gray or butternut shell jackets were generally worn by Confederates in the Eastern and Western Theater. Examples of frock coats being worn by enlisted men can be seen in photographs taken after the battles of Gettysburg, (1863), and Spotsylvania, (1864).|$|E
5|$|Nothing {{is known}} about its {{reproduction}} or nuptial flight. Collectors note that no alates or pupae resembling alate forms were found in excavated colonies between August and February, and the larvae collected were not {{large enough to be}} reproductive ants. However, it is possible that nuptial flight takes place in spring or summer, and like N. albisetosus and N.cockerelli, alates most likely start to occur by June. After nuptial flight, queens search for a suitable colony by building a chamber under objects such as stones and exposed roots of woody plants. This theory stated by entomologist Paul Kannowski is supported by the fact that these ants depend on stones buried in the soil for nest construction. The larvae and pupae are unsorted in the upper chambers of the nest that are joined together by hooked hairs {{on the side of the}} larvae. This arrangement most likely helps workers move the brood efficiently <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> together in a group. Incipient colonies may only have 30 workers and brood in all life stages. Unlike the larvae and pupae, the eggs and queen are not found in the uppermost galleries, but rather they are found in the deepest chambers of the nest. In large nests, small workers resembling the first generation of brood are either rare or absent.|$|E

5|$|The Highland peoples were {{renowned for}} their skill in headhunting, {{which was a}} symbol of bravery and valor. Almost every people group except the Yami (Tao) practiced headhunting. Once the victims had been {{dispatched}} the heads were taken then boiled and left to dry, often hanging from trees or shelves constructed for the purpose. A party returning with a head was cause for celebration, as it was believed to bring good luck. The Bunun people would often take prisoners and inscribe prayers or messages to their dead on arrows, then shoot their prisoner with the hope their prayers would be carried to the dead. Taiwanese Hoklo Han settlers and Japanese were often the victims of headhunting raids as they were considered by the aborigines to be liars and enemies. A headhunting raid would often strike at workers in the fields, or set a dwelling alight and then decapitate the inhabitants as they fled the burning structure. It was also customary to later raise the victim's surviving children as full members of the community. Often the heads themselves were ceremonially 'invited' to join the community as members, where they were supposed to watch over the community <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> <b>them</b> safe. The indigenous inhabitants of Taiwan accepted the convention and practice of headhunting as one of the calculated risks of community life. The last groups to practice headhunting were the Paiwan, Bunun, and Atayal groups. Japanese rule ended the practice by 1930, but some elder Taiwanese could recall the practice as late as 2003.|$|E
