Advisor: Dr. Hooi Ling Soh. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); <b>viii,</b> 197 pages, <b>appendices</b> <b>viii,</b> 197 pages, <b>appendices</b> A-E. This dissertation investigates {{the distribution of}} Iron Range English (IRE) reflexives, using judgments collected in a Magnitude Estimation task (Bard et al 1996), and presents a phase-based analysis for their distribution. IRE reflexives (e. g., himself) can corefer with nominal expressions outside their minimal clause in subject or object position. Coreference with an expression outside the minimal clause is not acceptable in two environments: (i) {{if there is an}} intervening subject that does not match the reflexive for person (c. f., Blocking Effects in Mandarin) or (ii) if the reflexive is in an island. The distribution of IRE reflexives is unexpected because generally only monomorphemic reflexives behave this way (Pica 1987). Complex reflexives that behave this way, such as Malay diri-nya `himself/herself' (Cole & Hermon 2003) and Turkish kendi-sin `himself/herself' (Kornfilt 2001), are shown to have pronominal qualities. IRE reflexives do not have pronominal qualities since they exhibit Blocking Effects and island effects. Therefore, they are true long-distance reflexives. Blocking and island effects provide evidence that the reflexive undergoes raising to [Spec, CP], as is suggested for long-distance reflexives in other languages (e. g., Katada 1991). From the [Spec, CP] position, the reflexive is able to corefer with a nominal expression in a higher clause, in accordance with the Phase Impenetrability Condition (Chomsky 2001). Two processes are needed to account for the distribution of IRE long-distance reflexives (c. f., Cole & Wang 1996) since the set of expressions that are potential antecedents and the set of expressions that trigger Blocking Effects are not the same: a reflexive can corefer with a subject or an object, but only subjects trigger Blocking Effects. I posit that reflexives have a [VAR] feature that must be valued by a c-commanding nominal expression within the same phase via Agree, extending Hicks' (2009) analysis of English anaphors. Agree accounts for coreference and offers an inherent c-command relationship between the antecedent and reflexive. I account for Blocking Effects by considerably modifying Hasegawa's (2005) analysis for English anaphors. I suggest that a [+multi] feature on T licenses the reflexive and requires that the reflexive and the subject Agree for person...|$|R

40|$|In 2005, the NDE Program used EPRI Materials Management Initiative {{funding to}} develop {{ultrasonic}} phased array technology for dissimilar metal pipe weld (DMW) inspection. EPRI and Zetec staff collaborated on the successful qualification of a procedure for ultrasonic phased array examination of DMW {{from the outside}} surface using the Omniscan instrument. This initial qualification covered DMW configurations with unobstructed access across the entire weld crown and butter. Thus, only untapered weld configurations were covered by the original qualified phased array procedures. This paper describes {{the extension of the}} phased array ultrasonic examination procedure for the inspection of dissimilar metal welds to complex configurations (tapered weld surfaces). A consortium of EPRI, utility, and vendor personnel successfully expanded the EPRI phased array procedure to cover two additional complex dissimilar metal weld configurations.

40|$|Abstract: A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess the ability of phased-array ultrasonic techniques to detect and accurately determine the size of flaws from the far-side of wrought austenitic piping welds. The work was sponsored by the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission under Contract DE-AC 06 - 76 RLO 1830; NRC JCN Y 6604; Ms. Deborah Jackson, Program Monitor. Far-side inspections of these welds are currently performed on a “best effort ” basis and do not conform to ASME Code Section XI <b>Appendix</b> <b>VIII</b> performance demonstration requirements. For this study, four circumferential welds in 610 mm diameter, 36 mm thick ASTM A- 358, Grade 304 vintage austenitic stainless steel pipe were examined. The welds were fabricated with varied welding parameters; both horizontal and vertical pipe orientations were used, with air and water backing, to simulate field welding conditions. A series of saw cuts, electro-discharge machined (EDM) notches, and implanted fatigue cracks were placed into the heat affected zones of the welds. The saw cuts and notches range in depth from 7. 5 % to 28. 4 % through-wall. The implanted cracks ranged in depth from 5 % through wall to 64 % through wall. The welds were examined with two phased-array probes, a 2. 0 MHz transmit-receive longitudinal wave array and a 2. 0 MHz transmit-receive shear wave array. These examinations showed that both phased-array transducers were able to detect and accurately length-size, but not depth size, all of the notches and flaws through the welds.

40|$|To {{help promote}} {{effective}} implementation of federal financial management reform, we studied the financial management practices and improvement efforts of nine leading {{public and private}} sector finance organizations to identify the success factors, practices, and outcomes associated with worldclass financial management. This executive guide is intended to assist federal agencies in achieving {{the objectives of the}} Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act of 1990 and subsequent related legislation by providing case studies of 11 practices critical for establishing and maintaining sound financial operations. The reforms laid out by the CFO Act and subsequent related legislation, when effectively implemented, will place the federal government on par with private sector corporations and state and local governments that have already made the necessary investment in financial management. While many agencies have made great strides toward generating more accurate and reliable annual financial statements, the process of preparing financial statements and subjecting them to independent audit is only the first step toward satisfying the requirements of the legislation. To reap the full benefits of financial reform, federal finance organizations must go beyond the audit opinion toward (1) establishing seamless systems and processes, (2) routinely generating reliable cost and performance information and analysis, (3) undertaking other value-added activities that support strategic decisionmaking and mission performance, and (4) building a finance team that supports the agency’s mission and goals.

For those who wish to learn how to make textures there exists little information available that is not contradictory or incomplete. The goal of this project was to provide practical information to those getting started in the field of texturing. The primary component of this project was the creation and comparison of a series of texturing procedures, developed to determine methods of generating high quality in-game assets in the most efficient ways possible. The products of these procedures were used in a survey administered to the public as a means of gauging the quality of the textures produced. Based on the survey results and personal observation, a digital environment was made showcasing what was learned from the texturing tests. <b>viii</b> <b>Appendices</b> {{at the end of the}} project give step-by-step instruction on the {{creation of}} the common types of textures and the creation of normal maps.

6000|$|But on {{a copy of}} An Evening Walk (1793 edition) Wordsworth wrote:--"This is {{the first}} of my {{published}} poems, {{with the exception of a}} sonnet, written when I was a schoolboy, and published in the European Magazine in June or July 1786, and signed Axiologus." [...] Even as to this date his memory was at fault. It was published in 1787, when he was seventeen years of age. Its full title may be given; although, for reasons already stated, it would be unjustifiable to republish the sonnet, except in an appendix to the poems, and mainly for its biographical interest. It was entitled, Sonnet, on seeing Miss Maria Williams weep at a Tale of Distress. But, fully ten years before the date mentioned by Dorothy Wordsworth in her Grasmere Journal--as the day on which she read Milton's sonnets to her brother, and on which he wrote the two on Buonaparte--he had written others, the existence of which he had evidently forgotten. On the 6th of May 1792, his sister wrote thus from Forncett Rectory in Norfolk to her friend, Miss Jane Pollard:--"I promised to transcribe some of William's compositions. As I made the promise, I will give you a little sonnet.... I take the first that offers. It is very valuable to me, because the cause which gave birth to it was the favourite evening walk of William and me.... I have not chosen this sonnet from any particular beauty it has. It was the first I laid my hands upon." [...] From the clause I have italicised, it would almost seem that other sonnets belong to that period, viz. before 1793, when An Evening Walk appeared. She would hardly have spoken of it as she did, if this was the only sonnet her brother had then written. Though very inferior to his later work, this sonnet may be preserved as a specimen of Wordsworth's earlier manner, before he had broken away, by the force of his own imagination, from the trammels of the conventional style, which he inherited. It is printed in the <b>Appendix</b> to volume <b>viii.</b>|$|R
