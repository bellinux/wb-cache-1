5|$|In {{this volume}} Kierkegaard {{examines}} {{the concept of}} 'First Love' as a pinnacle for the aestheticist, using his idiosyncratic concepts of 'closedness' (indesluttethed in Danish) and the 'demonic' (demoniske) with reference to Eugène Scribe. Scribe {{wanted to create a}} template for all playwrights to follow. He insisted that people go to plays to escape from reality and not for instruction. Kierkegaard is against any template in the field of literature or of Christianity. He was against systematizing anything in literature because the system brings the artist to a stop <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> just settles down in the system.|$|E

5|$|The {{sovereign}} is the Supreme Governor of {{the established}} Church of England. Archbishops and bishops are appointed by the monarch, {{on the advice of}} the Prime Minister, who chooses the appointee from a list of nominees prepared by a Church Commission. The Crown's role in the Church of England is titular; the most senior clergyman, the Archbishop of Canterbury, is the spiritual leader of the Church and of the worldwide Anglican Communion. The monarch takes an oath to preserve Church of Scotland <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> holds the power to appoint the Lord High Commissioner to the Church's General Assembly, but otherwise plays no part in its governance, and exerts no powers over it. The Sovereign plays no formal role in the disestablished Church in Wales or Church of Ireland.|$|E
5|$|The {{leader and}} cabinet model of decision-making, {{adopted by the}} city council under the Local Government Act 2000, is similar to {{national}} government. The council appoints the Leader (usually {{a member of the}} group with the political majority) <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> appoints up to nine other councillors to serve on the cabinet. The cabinet members, one of whom is appointed Deputy Leader, assume responsibility for different key areas of local governance. The full council meets around ten times a year. There are decisions that only full council can make, these include setting budgets and spending programmes, setting council tax levels and approving major policies and priorities. In addition to the Leader of the Council, the council also appoints the Mayor of Peterborough, the Deputy Mayor, committee chairmen and the chief executive. The cabinet and committees report to, and are accountable to, council.|$|E
5|$|As regards a bill {{mentioned}} in paragraph 1, the President, acting {{in accordance with}} the advice of the Cabinet, may refer to a Constitutional Tribunal {{the question of whether the}} bill circumvents or curtails the discretionary powers conferred on him or her by the Constitution. If the Tribunal is of the opinion that the bill does not have this effect, the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day after the day when the Tribunal's opinion is pronounced in open court. On the other hand, if the Tribunal feels that the bill does have the circumventing or curtailing effect, and the President either has withheld or withholds his assent to the bill, the Prime Minister may direct that the bill be submitted to the electors for a national referendum. In that case, the bill only becomes law if it is supported by not less than two-thirds of the total number of votes cast at the referendum. If 30 days have expired after a bill has been presented to the President for assent <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> has neither signified the withholding of assent nor referred the Bill to a Constitutional Tribunal, the bill is deemed to have been assented to on the day following the expiry of the 30-day period. The procedure is similar for a bill {{mentioned in}} paragraph 2, except that if the Constitutional Tribunal rules that the bill has a circumventing or curtailing effect, the Prime Minister has no power to put the bill to a referendum. This ensures that changes to the President's discretionary powers can only be made by way of constitutional amendments and not ordinary statutes.|$|E

25|$|However, Moscow under Luzhkov invited several {{restrictions}} to this rule, partially {{keeping the}} old system.

25|$|There are six sheriffdoms in Scotland, {{each with}} a sheriff principal. Within each sheriffdom are sheriff court districts, {{each with a}} court presided over {{by one or more}} sheriffs.

The Sheriffdoms are Glasgow and Strathkelvin, Grampian, Highland and Islands, Lothian and Borders, North Strathclyde, South Strathclyde, Dumfries and Galloway, and Tayside Central and Fife.|$|E
25|$|All {{criminal}} trials {{before the}} High Court are heard and disposed of before a single Judge of the High Court. When the Court {{is ready to}} commence a trial, the accused appears or is brought before the court. The charge is read and explained, and the accused is asked {{whether he or she}} is guilty of the offence or claims to be tried. If the accused pleads guilty the plea is recorded, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> may be convicted on it and sentenced. If the accused refuses to or does not plead, or if he or she claims trial, the Court proceeds to try the case.|$|E

25|$|As soon as an oral case {{presentation}} is finished, the justices retire for a closed {{meeting to discuss}} and vote on the case. One justice will {{be held responsible for}} introducing the matter and proposing a solution of the case <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> will usually write the opinion of the Court. If the views of the reporting justice do not have the support of a majority of the justices, the President will ask another justice to write the Court’s opinion, and the minority justices decide who will write a separate dissenting judgement. Finally, a complete judgement will be prepared, and the justices will sign a single copy which is filed in the Book of Opinions of the Court.|$|E
25|$|Brigade Captain (Yellow helmet {{with a red}} stripe) is {{the most}} senior rank in a brigade <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> is {{responsible}} for the operational and administrative aspects of the brigade. The position is elected by members of the brigade. Some of the things that a Captain will do are: undertaking responsibility for the proper management and maintenance of brigade property and equipment, ensuring members of the brigade are properly trained, take command of incidents and ensure that the chain of command within the brigade operates effectively, assisting with bushfire prevention and planning within the brigade's response area, liaising with other captains in adjacent brigades and managing the operations of the brigade in accordance with any determination of the CFS board.|$|E
25|$|Yet another {{explanation}} of the high correlation between extraversion and happiness comes from the study by Ashton, Lee, and Paunonen (2002). They suggested that the core element of extraversion {{is a tendency to}} behave in ways that attract, hold, and enjoy social attention, and not reward sensitivity. They claimed that one of the fundamental qualities of social attention is its potential of being rewarding. Therefore, if a person shows positive emotions of enthusiasm, energy, and excitement, that person is seen favorably by others <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> gains others' attention. This favorable reaction from others likely encourages extraverts to engage in further extraverted behavior. Ashton, Lee, and Paunonen's (2002) study showed that their measure of social attention, the Social Attention Scale, was much more highly correlated with extraversion than were measures of reward sensitivity.|$|E
50|$|The CompStat Unit also {{develops}} {{and prepares}} commander profile reports.

5000|$|In such cases, {{the burden}} of proof lies on the first of said parties (e.g. the government, parent, or doctor) to {{disprove}} undue influence on the second party. This requires the dominant party to establish that the second party [...] "knew <b>and</b> understood what <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> was doing, <b>and</b> that <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> was acting independently of the influence of the dominant party". One influential factor in deciding whether the second party was acting independently is whether <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> was given an independent advice, while such an advice is not indispensable for rebutting the presumption.|$|R
25|$|The {{focus of}} the governor's {{emergency}} powers is to ensure the security and stability of the state <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> receives comprehensive police powers in an emergency. In discharging those power to enforce laws, rules and regulations relating to emergency management, the governor assumes direct operational control of emergency management forces of the state, including the Oklahoma National Guard, state police agencies, state and local health departments, as well as county sheriff's offices and local police departments. These emergency police powers extend to providing for the evacuation of the state’s population from any affected or threatened area or areas within the state, regulating the conduct of civilians {{and the movement of}} pedestrians and vehicular traffic, and regulating public meetings and gatherings. The governor is responsible for providing for the care of all those regulated by his or her orders.|$|E
25|$|In addition, the {{minority}} leader {{has a number of}} other institutional functions. For instance, {{the minority}} leader is sometimes statutorily authorized to appoint individuals to certain federal entities; he or she and the majority leader each name three Members to serve as Private Calendar objectors; he or she is consulted with respect to reconvening the House per the usual formulation of conditional concurrent adjournment resolutions; he or she is a traditional member of the House Office Building Commission; he or {{she is a member of}} the United States Capitol Preservation Commission; <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> may, after consultation with the Speaker, convene an early organizational party caucus or conference. Informally, {{the minority leader}} maintains ties with majority party leaders to learn about the schedule and other House matters and forges agreements or understandings with them insofar as feasible.|$|E
25|$|At any {{stage of}} a trial before the Court before {{the return of the}} verdict, the {{prosecution}} may inform the Court that it will not further prosecute the accused upon the charge. All proceedings on the charge against the accused are then stayed, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> is discharged. The prosecution may act in this manner for various reasons; for example, if it no longer believes that the accused committed the offence, if it feels that the case against the accused is weak, or if it is of the view that further investigations are required to gather evidence for its case. Unless the judge expressly directs otherwise, such a discharge does not amount to an acquittal. This means that if the prosecution is able to obtain additional evidence to bolster its case, it may bring criminal proceedings against the accused again at a later stage.|$|E
