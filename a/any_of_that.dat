You hear, 'X number of people were killed today,' which I think does a huge disservice. It's like spitting on these {{young men and women}} who are over there fighting to help this country.|$|E
5|$|Skyler (Anna Gunn) calls Walter {{to inquire}} about buying the car wash where Walter once worked, which they plan {{to use as a}} front {{business}} for Walter's drug money. When Walter fails to act on the purchase, Skyler starts doing her own detailed research about the business's expenses and revenues. She later approaches the car wash owner, Bogdan (Marius Stan), about the proposed purchase, but he angrily rejects her, making sexist remarks and condemning Walter for having insulted Bogdan when he quit the car wash. Meanwhile, Marie (Betsy Brandt) continues struggling to deal with her husband Hank's (Dean Norris) deepening depression as he copes with physical therapy from having been shot. The bed-ridden and bitter Hank constantly ignores or insults Marie and, even after celebrating a successful session with his physical therapist, he refuses to share <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> excitement with Marie. Meanwhile, after three straight days of partying, Jesse tries to keep hanging out with Badger and Skinny Pete, but they are exhausted and go home, along with all of the other guests in Jesse's house. Alone with his thoughts, a depressed Jesse breaks down and cries, sitting less than an inch away from his speakers at an extremely high volume.|$|E

There was talk of Blackpool Borough Council stepping in to help, and also of a Manchester supermarket chain willing to buy the Bloomfield Road ground.|$|E
25|$|In 1783 and 1784, Polk {{was elected}} to the North Carolina Council of State, which {{assisted}} the governors in performing their executive duties. In 1786, the General Assembly elected Polk as a delegate to the Third Continental Congress, by that time known as the Congress of the Confederation, but Polk did not attend <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> body's sessions.

25|$|This taxon {{was first}} {{collected}} from near Perth in the 1840s, and published as Calymperes latifolium in 1846 by Georg Ernst Ludwig Hampe, in Volume II of Johann Georg Christian Lehmann's Plantae Preissianae. In the 1980s, a careful examination {{showed it to}} be only superficially similar to Calymperes (Calymperaceae). It was held {{to belong to a}} different family, the Pottiaceae, but did not fit into <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> family's published genera. In 1985, therefore, Ilma Grace Stone published Calymperastrum and transferred C.latifolium into it.|$|E
25|$|During {{her time}} working at Castelli Gallery, Lawler was making paintings, artist’s books, prints, and {{photographs}} of her own. But when she landed her first official gallery exhibition, in 1978 at Artists Space, she did not exhibit <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> work. Instead, she borrowed a small 1883 portrait of a horse from Aqueduct Racetrack — it had been hanging over a Xerox machine in the offices — and mounted it on an empty wall at the gallery. To highlight her appropriation, she installed two spotlights: one above the picture and another pointed out the window, at the building next door, hinting to sidewalk passersby {{that there was something}} of note going on upstairs.|$|E
25|$|Australia banned {{irradiated}} {{cat food}} after a national scare where cats suffered from paralyzation after eating a specific brand of highly irradiated catfood {{for an extended}} period of time. The suspected culprit was malnutrition from consuming food depleted of Vitamin A by the irradiation process. The incident was linked only to a single batch of one brand's product and no illness was linked to <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> brand's other irradiated batches of the same product or to any other brand of irradiated cat food. This, along with incomplete evidence indicating that the cat food was not sufficiently depleted of Vitamin A makes irradiation a less likely cause. Further research has been able to experimentally induce the paralyzation of cats by via Vitamin A deficiency by feeding highly irradiated food. For more details see the Long term impacts section.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} {{contract was}} for the game be completed within 18 months. In the course of its development, the game was nearly canceled twice: {{in the first instance}} due to the company's financial difficulties, and the second time under the pressure from Spectrum HoloByte after it had acquired Bill Stealey’s shares in MicroProse in 1993. Julian Gollop said the quality assurance team (Andrew Lucket, Phil McDonnel, and Jason Thompson) helped save the game from cancellation; their feedback also helped to polish the game. The game was in fact officially ordered to be canceled by Spectrum HoloByte, but MicroProse UK bosses Pete Moreland, Adrian Parr, and Paul Hibbard held a meeting and decided to ignore it and simply not inform Gollop about <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>that.</b> Thus, the development team continued their work without any knowledge of the parent company's executives, until it was eventually completed in March 1994, after 30 months in development since the initial contract. During the final three months, after Spectrum HoloByte was eventually informed of the game still being in production, the Gollop brothers were forced to work 7–12 in order to finish it {{before the end of the}} fiscal year. The overall development of the PC version cost £115,000.|$|E
