25|$|The case of BCIs {{today has}} {{parallels}} in medicine, as will its evolution. Much as pharmaceutical science {{began as a}} balance for impairments and is now used to increase focus and reduce need for sleep, BCIs will likely transform gradually from therapies to enhancements. Researchers <b>are</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> sound ethical guidelines, appropriately moderated enthusiasm in media coverage and education about BCI systems will be of utmost importance for the societal acceptance of this technology. Thus, recently more effort is made inside the BCI community to create consensus on ethical guidelines for BCI research, development and dissemination.|$|E
500|$|Lohan's next {{appearance}} was in Chapter 27 as a John Lennon fan who befriends Mark David Chapman, played by Jared Leto, {{on the day}} he murders Lennon. Filming finished in early 2006, but the film was not released until March 2008 due to difficulties in finding a distributor. In May 2007, the drama Georgia Rule was released. In the film, Lohan portrays an out-of-control teenager whose mother (Felicity Huffman) brings her to the house of her own estranged mother (Jane Fonda). Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote that [...] "Lohan hits a true note of spiteful princess narcissism." [...] During filming in 2006, Lohan was hospitalized, her representative saying [...] "she was overheated and dehydrated." [...] At the time Lohan was going through a breakup with Hard Rock Cafe heir Harry Morton, which contributed to her problems on the set, according to Allure. In a letter that was made public, studio executive James G. Robinson called Lohan [...] "irresponsible and unprofessional." [...] He mentioned [...] "various late arrivals and absences from the set" [...] and said that [...] "we <b>are</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> your ongoing all night heavy partying is the real reason for your so-called 'exhaustion.'" [...] In 2007, Lohan was cast in the film Poor Things. But in May of that year, she was arrested on a charge of driving {{under the influence of alcohol}} (DUI.) The film's producers initially voiced support, and production was put on hold, as Lohan entered the Promises Treatment Center rehabilitation facility where she stayed for 45 days. She ultimately lost the Poor Things part. In July, less than two weeks out of rehab, Lohan was arrested a second time on charges of possession of cocaine, driving under the influence and driving with a suspended license. In August, Lohan pleaded guilty to misdemeanor cocaine use and driving under the influence and was sentenced to an alcohol education program, community service, one day in jail, and was given three years probation. Lohan released a statement in which she said [...] "it is clear to me that my life has become completely unmanageable because I am addicted to alcohol and drugs." [...] The same month she entered the Cirque Lodge Treatment Center in Sundance, Utah for a third stint at rehabilitation, staying for three months until her discharge in October. In November Lohan served 84 minutes in jail. A sheriff spokesman cited overcrowding and the nonviolent nature of the crime as reasons for the reduced sentence.|$|E

2500|$|A {{small number}} of modern Jewish theologians, such as Yehezkel Kaufman and Rabbi Joseph H. Hertz, have {{suggested}} that perhaps only the Israelites were forbidden to worship idols, but perhaps such worship was permissible for members of other religions. (Yehezkel Kaufman, [...] "The Religion of Israel", Univ. of Chicago Press, 1960; J. H. Hertz, [...] "Pentateuch and Haftorahs" [...] Soncino Press, 1960, p.759). [...] Most Jewish theologians disagree, saying that the original {{meaning of the text}} was to condemn idolatry in total. However, a growing number of Jewish theologians question whether Hindus and Buddhists today should be considered idolaters in the Biblical sense of the term. Their reasons are that modern day Buddhists, Hindus and others (a) do not literally worship [...] "sticks and stones", as the idolaters in the Tanakh were described doing. Their beliefs have far more theological depth than ancient pagans, and they <b>are</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> icons they worship are only symbols of a deeper level of reality (though {{the same can be said}} of modern-day pagans), (b) they do not practice child sacrifice, (c) they are of high moral character, and (d) they are not anti-Jewish. Some Jews argue that God has a relationship with all gentile monotheists (or perceived monotheists), including Hindus, who in the past may have been (mis)interpreted as having a polytheist faith (see also Hindu views on monotheism), as well as with members of other religions such as Buddhism.|$|E
2500|$|The play {{opens in}} a {{fisherman}}'s hut near a {{lake in the}} forest. Outside a storm rages. [...] Here live the old fisherman Auguste and his wife Eugenie. [...] And here lives Ondine whom the old couple found as a baby {{at the edge of}} the lake, and brought up in place of their own daughter who was mysteriously snatched away as an infant. [...] Auguste is upset because Ondine is out somewhere in the storm. As Auguste rages, naiads, the wind, and even the King of the Ondines himself (throughout the play referred to as the Old One) peer in at the windows gently mocking Auguste. [...] Evidently this is not unusual—the [...] old couple <b>are</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> Ondine is “not like anyone else”. [...] A knight-errant, Hans von Wittenstein zu Wittenstein, arrives seeking shelter. He is welcomed and while he is in the midst of telling Auguste and Eugenie about his betrothed, the princess Bertha, Ondine appears. On seeing Hans she says, “How beautiful he is!” [...] In spite of taunts from Ondine's sister naiads, and against the advice of Auguste, Hans immediately falls in love with Ondine. [...] All thought of Bertha, his “dark angel”—the woman who sent him off on his quest—is banished. [...] Ondine in turn swears eternal love for [...] Hans. [...] The Old One warns her, “The man will deceive you. He will abandon you.” [...] Ondine does not believe him. [...] He gives a final warning “You will remember our pact.” [...] Ondine reluctantly agrees.|$|E
