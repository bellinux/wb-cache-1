In their financial report in April 2005, Eidos reported that Invisible War was among the titles to have sold between 500,000 and one million copies since release, placing it among their successful titles. As of April 2011, Invisible War has sold over 1.2 million copies worldwide, placing it above the original game in terms of copies sold.|$|E

5|$|England never seriously {{threatened}} {{to reach the}} victory target of 442 runs, which would have comfortably broken the world record for a fourth-innings run chase. Allan Lamb added to his reputation for mastering fast bowling with a defiant 113, but it was sizeable contributions from the tail and extras that took England to <b>a</b> <b>respectable</b> total of 307 – but a bad defeat by 134 runs.|$|E
5|$|German {{grandmaster}} Karsten Müller wrote:Fischer, who {{had taken}} the highest crown almost singlehandedly from the mighty, almost invincible Soviet chess empire, shook the whole world, not only the chess world, to its core. He started a chess boom {{not only in the}} United States and in the Western hemisphere, but worldwide. Teaching chess or playing chess as a career had truly become <b>a</b> <b>respectable</b> profession. After Bobby, the game was simply not the same.|$|E

He never misses a chance in his practice, which is a mark of respectability. He never takes any pleasure, which is another mark of respectability. He is reserved and serious, which is another mark of respectability. His digestion is impaired, which is highly respectable. And he is making hay of the grass which is flesh, for his three daughters. And his father is dependent on him in the Vale of Taunton.|$|R
5|$|The {{second session}} saw the Mercedes drivers doing only one timed run, which proved {{sufficient}} to proceed, while the Red Bull and Toro Rosso cars were split up, with Daniil Kvyat and rookie Max Verstappen failing {{to make it}} through.

5|$|Upon release, {{the song}} was <b>a</b> <b>respectable</b> success on the charts and became the fourth top ten hit from the album on the Billboard Hot 100. Despite its success, the single {{received}} mixed reviews from music critics who praised its composition, linking it to the works by Coldplay, but criticized its production and Levine's vocals. Following {{the release of the}} album, due to strong digital downloads, the song peaked at number nine on the singles chart in South Korea.|$|E
5|$|Adams {{returned}} to management in April 1999 with Division Three team Brighton & Hove Albion. The club {{were in the}} middle of a financial crisis, which had seen the board sell the Goldstone Ground just to stay afloat; on the pitch the club were facing a battle for their league status. His first full season as manager was a matter of consolidation as the club finished <b>a</b> <b>respectable</b> 11th, whilst Adams signed talent such as star striker Bobby Zamora. The £100,000 spent on Zamora was the only transfer outlay Adams made in building his squad.|$|E

5|$|In 1810, Hogg {{went up to}} University College, Oxford, his father's alma mater. There he met {{and became}} friends with Percy Bysshe Shelley in October 1810. Hogg and Shelley often {{discussed}} literature and metaphysics, had a shared disdain for religion and Oxford society, and were united in their belief in free love and free thinking. Although Shelley's father initially feared that his son was being corrupted by Hogg's ideas, he was reassured {{when he learned that}} Hogg was from <b>a</b> <b>respectable</b> family.|$|E

In the epic Mahabharata, Kubera is {{described}} {{as the son of}} Prajapati Pulastya and his wife Idavida and the brother of sage Vishrava. Kubera is described as born from a cow. However, from the Puranas, he is described as the grandson of Pulastya and the son of Vishrava and his wife Ilavida (or Ilivila or Devavarnini), daughter of the sage Bharadvaja or Trinabindu.|$|E
5|$|Murray {{was called}} to the Bar on 23 November 1730, taking a set of {{chambers}} at 5 King's Bench Walk. He was introduced to Alexander Pope around this time, and through his friendship met members of the aristocracy, some of whom later became his clients, including Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough. Pope also taught him oratory, which helped him enormously in court. His first two cases were in the English Court of Sessions in 1733, where he was led by Charles Talbot and opposed by Philip Yorke. The support of Talbot and Yorke allowed him to gain <b>a</b> <b>respectable</b> practice in the Court of Chancery.|$|E

5|$|On 11 October 1855, Brunner married Jane Robson, the 26-year-old {{daughter}} of a labourer who had brought his family to New Zealand the previous year. It was <b>a</b> <b>respectable</b> match for Jane as Brunner was considered a particularly eligible bachelor in Nelson, one of around 45 professionals working {{in the town of}} about 1600 people. His salary had increased to ₤300 (₤24,000) and he was now Chief Surveyor for the Nelson Province, the local returning officer and the Commissioner of Native Reserves for Nelson. He also owned three properties, including his Nelson office.|$|E
5|$|One other point, already mentioned, {{was how to}} {{deal with}} the problem of {{rendering}} the poem’s fourth line. Gray remarked to Anstey, “’That leaves the world to darkness and to me’ is good English, but has not the turn of a Latin phrase, and therefore, I believe, you were in the right to drop it.” In fact, all that Anstey had dropped was reproducing an example of zeugma with <b>a</b> <b>respectable</b> Classical history, but only in favour of replicating the same understated introduction of the narrator into the scene: et solus sub nocte relinqor (and I alone am left under the night). Some other translators, with other priorities, found elegant means to render the original turn of speech exactly.|$|E
5|$|SST Records {{released}} Double Nickels on the Dime {{on double}} vinyl in July 1984. SST delayed {{the release of}} Zen Arcade by Hüsker Dü so that both albums could be released simultaneously. After the release of Double Nickels on the Dime, Minutemen toured almost constantly to promote the record. One 1984 tour saw the band playing 57 dates in 63 days. The album sold fifteen thousand copies during 1984, <b>a</b> <b>respectable</b> amount for a band on an independent record label. As of 2008, Double Nickels on the Dime remains Minutemen's best-selling record.|$|E

5|$|Thanks to the promotion, Chamois Niortais {{became a}} {{professional}} club for the 1985–86 season. The season began {{well for the}} side, as they achieved a 1–0 win against USL Dunkerque on 16 July 1985. They went on to accomplish <b>a</b> <b>respectable</b> fifth-placed finish in their first season {{with a total of}} 37 points. The next campaign saw unprecedented success for the team, as they racked up a 17-match unbeaten run {{on the way to the}} league championship. Their title triumph was confirmed with a 2–0 victory over US Orléans at the Stade René Gaillard on 23 May 1987.|$|E
5|$|The blacknose shark {{has never}} been implicated in an attack on humans. However, caution should be {{exercised}} if it begins to perform a threat display. This species {{is regarded as a}} game fish and offers <b>a</b> <b>respectable</b> fight on light tackle (a more delicate fishing line). It is also of regional commercial importance, being taken intentionally and as bycatch via gillnets and surface longlines across its range, most significantly off southwestern Florida, Venezuela, and Brazil; the meat is sold dried and salted. Large numbers of blacknose sharks are also caught incidentally by shrimp trawlers, which may pose a greater threat to its population, as many of the sharks taken are immature.|$|E
5|$|Turning to coaching, Cook {{took over}} as {{the manager of the}} Cleveland Barons in the International-American Hockey League (IAHL) in the 1937–38 season. He {{inherited}} a team that had struggled the season before and led it to <b>a</b> <b>respectable</b> season, winning 34 of 50 games played combined between the regular season and playoffs. Cook was pressed into service as a player as a result of injuries. His team was able to dress only 10 of 17 players in the deciding game of the Barons' playoff series against the Syracuse Stars. Cook played a regular shift in the game, but the Barons lost, 3–2, in the fourth overtime period.|$|E
