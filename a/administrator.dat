40|$|The {{study was}} {{designed}} to examine and document the hierarchy of job wants as ranked by nurses. The ranked job wants by nurses were compared to the ranked nurse job wants as perceived by nurse <b>administrators,</b> hospital <b>administrators,</b> and physicians. A second purpose was to determine if a correlation existed between the ranked listings of each job classification groupings. The job want factors adopted for the study included the following: 1. Improved working conditions 2. Feeling "in" on things 3. Tactful evaluation 4. Full appreciation for work done 5. Administration loyalty to nurses 6. Improved wages 7. Opportunities for professional growth 8. Sympathetic understanding of personal problems 9. Job security 10. Meaningful workThe sample in the study consisted of 174 respondents. The 76 nurses, 29 nurse <b>administrators,</b> and 34 hospital <b>administrators</b> were employed in one of four hospitals in Northeastern Indiana. The 35 physicians practiced in {{at least one of the}} four hospitals selected for the study. A total of six hypotheses were tested.
