5|$|By 1472, {{at the age}} of twenty, Leonardo {{qualified}} as a master in the Guild of Saint Luke, the guild of artists and doctors of medicine, but even after his father set him up in his own workshop, his attachment to Verrocchio was such that he continued to collaborate with him. Leonardo's earliest known dated work is a drawing in pen <b>and</b> <b>ink</b> of the Arno valley, drawn on 5 August 1473.|$|E
5|$|Cott's {{account of}} all this (illustrated by his own pen <b>and</b> <b>ink</b> drawings) is the 550-page book Adaptive Coloration in Animals (1940).

5|$|Hunter focused {{for much}} of his life on landscapes and on still lifes, working in both pen <b>and</b> <b>ink</b> and oil on canvas. His still lifes of fruit are {{particularly}} distinctive, but he also painted a variety of landscapes, especially of Scotland and France. In his earlier paintings, Hunter was influenced by Cézanne to produce domestic landscapes. Later, however, in common with {{the other members of the}} Scottish colourists movement, he was heavily influenced by contemporary French artists like Monet and Matisse, and his paintings began to make bolder and more energetic use of colour.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1940s Koppelman {{worked at the}} Museum of Non-Objective Painting on 54th Street in Manhattan (which later became the Guggenheim Museum) with, among others, Jackson Pollock, Robert De Niro, Sr., Rolph Scarlett, Lucia Autorino, and Ward Jackson. Two of his early, {{abstract}} pen <b>and</b> <b>ink</b> drawings are in the Guggenheim collection. The first recorded exhibition of Koppelman's work {{was held in the}} Lounge Gallery of the Eighth Street Playhouse in 1942, and included drawings, paintings, and sculpture. The following year, he had a solo exhibition at the Outlines Gallery in Pittsburgh.|$|E
5|$|Syracuse University {{houses the}} Martin Branner Cartoons {{collection}} of 300 original daily cartoons from Winnie Winkle (1920–1957). There {{is a complete}} week from each year represented, with additional random cartoons from each year. (There are no holdings for 1946–47.) The daily cartoons display traces of graphite, blue pencil, Zip-A-Tone, brush, pen <b>and</b> <b>ink</b> on illustration board measuring approximately 7 ¼ x 22 ½ inches. The Smithsonian's National Museum of American History has 28 volumes of Branner's proofs for the strip.|$|E

5|$|Ancient Egyptian {{literature}} has been preserved {{on a wide}} variety of media. This includes papyrus scrolls and packets, limestone or ceramic ostraca, wooden writing boards, monumental stone edifices and coffins. Texts preserved and unearthed by modern archaeologists represent a small fraction of ancient Egyptian literary material. The area of the floodplain of the Nile is under-represented because the moist environment is unsuitable for the preservation of papyri <b>and</b> <b>ink</b> inscriptions. On the other hand, hidden caches of literature, buried for thousands of years, have been discovered in settlements on the dry desert margins of Egyptian civilization.|$|E
5|$|In 1900, Potter revised a {{tale about}} a rabbit named Peter {{she had written}} for a child in 1893, and {{prepared}} a dummy book of it in imitation of Helen Bannerman's 1889 best-seller The Story of Little Black Sambo. Unable to find a buyer, she published the book {{for family and friends}} at her own expense in December 1901. Frederick Warne & Co. had earlier rejected the tale, but, anxious to compete in the booming small format children's book market, reconsidered and accepted it following the recommendation of their prominent children's book artist L. Leslie Brooke. Potter agreed to colour the pen <b>and</b> <b>ink</b> illustrations of the private edition, and chose the then-new Hentschel three-colour process for reproducing her watercolours. On 2 October 1902 The Tale of Peter Rabbit was released.|$|E
5|$|June Kim, {{the author}} and {{illustrator}} for 12 Days, primarily drew the artwork in the realism style, although she occasionally rendered characters as super-deformed versions of themselves. While the cover art incorporates red and silver coloring, the artwork primarily appears in black and white, with occasional gray shading. Kim used pen <b>and</b> <b>ink</b> as the artistic medium, then toned her art with the software application ComicStudio. For the narrative, she explores the characters' pasts through dreams, and periodic, nonlinear flashbacks. Several character traits, such as Jackie's chocolate allergy, are presented to the reader through inference rather than exposition. Additionally, Kim uses a brief, untranslated Korean song alongside the predominantly English text.|$|E

5|$|Murasaki is {{best known}} for her The Tale of Genji, a three-part novel {{spanning}} 1100 pages and 54 chapters, which is thought to have taken a decade to complete. The earliest chapters were possibly written for a private patron either during her marriage or shortly after her husband's death. She continued writing while at court and probably finished while still in service to Shōshi. She would have needed patronage to produce a work of such length. Michinaga provided her with costly paper <b>and</b> <b>ink,</b> and with calligraphers. The first handwritten volumes were probably assembled and bound by ladies-in-waiting.|$|E
5|$|Prior to deindustrialisation in the late-20th century, Milnrow's {{economy was}} linked closely with a {{spinning}} and weaving tradition which had evolved from developments in textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution. Industries ancillary to textile production were also operational, such as coal mining at Tunshill, and metalworking at Butterworth Hall. Butterworth Hall Colliery {{was the largest}} colliery in the Rochdale region, employing around 300 men in 1912. Modern sectors in the area include engineering, packaging materials, the dyeing and finishing of textiles and carpets, <b>and</b> <b>ink</b> production. The main street comprises a variety of shops, restaurants and food outlets.|$|E
5|$|The ancient Chinese made careful {{observations}} of heavenly bodies and phenomena since {{observations of}} the cosmos were used for astrology and prognostication. The astronomer Gan De (fl. 4th century BCE) from the State of Qi {{was the first in}} history to acknowledge sunspots as genuine solar phenomena (and not obstructing natural satellites as thought in the West after Einhard's observation in 807 CE), while the first precisely dated sunspot observation in China occurred on May 10, 28 BCE during the reign of Emperor Cheng of Han (r. 33–7 BCE). Among the Mawangdui Silk Texts dated no later than 168 BCE (when they were sealed in a tomb at Mawangdui Han tombs site, Changsha, Hunan province), the Miscellaneous Readings of Cosmic Patterns and Pneuma Images (Tianwen qixiang zazhan 天文氣象雜占) manuscript illustrates in writings <b>and</b> <b>ink</b> drawings roughly three-hundred different climatic and astronomical features including clouds, mirages, rainbows, stars, constellations, and comets. Another silk text from the same site reports the times and locations of the rising and setting of planets in the night sky from the years 246–177 BCE.|$|E

5|$|The {{story and}} cut scene {{animations}} were created in-house. The plot was originally written by Fox, {{who had also}} written most of the Sly Cooper stories, and reviewed by Fleming. As they continued to develop the game, they rewrote pieces of the story to reflect changes in the game, {{making sure that the}} story remained enjoyable. As the game became more complex, they brought in Bill Harms, a published comic book author, who had previously written for Supreme Commander and other video games. Harms assisted with the story and in-game dialog in addition to marketing materials. Fleming noted that {{the second half of the}} story underwent significant changes in the last nine months of development; for example, when voice actor Caleb Moody voiced the lines for Zeke, he ad libbed additional lines that the team found to be enjoyable, and they reworked the story to incorporate them. The cut scenes were created in a similar format to the comics that the game was influenced by, and used to further extend the atmosphere of the superhero motif. The cut scenes were created by taking 2D art created in Corel Painter and Adobe Photoshop and placing them into artificial 3D stages built in Adobe After Effects to create a pseudo-3D effect that allowed them to play with camera placement and effects, and addition of organic elements such as dust clouds <b>and</b> <b>ink</b> spots.|$|E
