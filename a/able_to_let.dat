5|$|When cricket resumed {{after the}} war, few bowlers {{maintained}} the tactic, which was unpopular with spectators owing to its negativity. Fred Root, the Worcestershire bowler, used it regularly and with considerable success in county cricket. Root later defended {{the use of}} leg theory—and Bodyline—observing that when bowlers bowled outside off stump, the batsmen were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> the ball pass them without playing a shot.|$|E
5|$|While Walter and Agent Astrid Farnsworth (Jasika Nicole) {{ensure that}} the witness is safe at the hospital, Olivia takes Peter back to the lab. Peter, {{suffering}} from a headache, takes an aspirin and drinks out of what he believes to be an ordinary bottle of milk from the fridge. In reality, the milk contains a serum developed by Walter {{in order to help}} him recover his full mental function. However, the serum was incorrectly prepared, which causes Peter to begin convulsing. Over the phone, Walter directs Olivia to inject Peter with the correct compounds in order to save his life. Walter realizes that the serum would have killed him if he had consumed it, and that this was another step in the Observer's plot. Later that evening, September meets with another Observer, and identifies the fact that Walter was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> Peter go, despite believing that he may not survive, and that when the time comes, they can expect Walter to do it again.|$|E
25|$|Sigmund Freud {{believed}} {{that as a}} child progresses through each of the different stages in psychosexual development, during {{the third year of}} the child’s life, genitals are thought to become active. As children develop a greater understanding of their own sex they also develop either a castration complex (in boys) or penis envy (in girls). For boys, during the “phallic” stage, they are at the height of childhood sexuality. During this the Oedipus complex occurs, where the boy feels erotic love for his mother (Electra complex in girls where love is directed towards the father). As time progresses and the boy matures, he is slowly <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> go of the rival feelings he has towards his father and free himself from his love for his parents. At this time, the boy learns to emulate masculine attributes from his father and subsequently to identify with him.|$|E

500|$|Gordon {{said that}} love is the central conceit of the episode. Although, in {{the myth of the}} Golem, the {{creature}} is soulless, Gordon took [...] "some liberties" [...] with the legend. He wanted [...] "Kaddish" [...] to [...] "literally be about resurrection". Ariel creates an imperfect reflection of her husband by crafting the Golem from mud. In essence, she is trying to play God, a role that Gordon later likened to Victor Frankenstein, the scientist from Mary Shelley's famous novel Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus (1823). However, Ariel and Frankenstein differ in the fact that Ariel's flaw was related to her [...] "loving [...] too much, not being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> go, because of the cruelty and injustice of what she suffered." [...] In this manner, Ariel's motivation for creating the Golem are [...] "slightly more romantically skewed".|$|E
500|$|Various actresses {{auditioned for}} the role of Epiphany Proudfoot before Lisa Bonet secured the part. Bonet was then known for her role on the family-oriented sitcom The Cosby Show, and her casting in Angel Heart sparked {{significant}} controversy. Parker cast Bonet based on the strength of her audition and was unaware of her role on The Cosby Show. On preparing {{for the role}}, Bonet said, [...] "I did a lot of meditation and a lot of self-inquiry. I did some research on voodoo. My earnest endeavor was really to let go of all my inhibitions. It was really necessary for me to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> go of Lisa and let Epiphany take over." [...] Parker had difficulty finding an actress {{for the role of}} Margaret Krusemark, until Rourke suggested English actress Charlotte Rampling. Rampling secured the role after Parker contacted her to discuss the part.|$|E
500|$|Angelou {{is able to}} {{recognize}} similarities between African and African-American culture; as Lupton puts it, the [...] "blue songs, shouts, and gospels" [...] she has grown up with in America [...] "echo the rhythms of West Africa". [...] She recognizes the connections between African and American Black cultures, including the children's games, the folklore, the spoken and non-verbal languages, the food, sensibilities, and behavior. [...] She connects the behavior of many African mother figures, especially their generosity, with her grandmother's behaviors. [...] In {{one of the most}} significant sections of Traveling Shoes, Angelou recounts an encounter with a West African woman who recognizes her, on the basis of her appearance, as a member of the Bambara group of West Africa. As Lupton states, these and other experiences in Ghana demonstrate her maturity, as a mother who is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> go of her adult son, as a woman who is no longer dependent upon a man, and as an American who is able to [...] "perceive the roots of her identity" [...] and how they affect her personality.|$|E
5000|$|Thus, the {{fundamental}} {{reason that the}} precise identification of these two kinds of clinging to an identity - personal and phenomenal - is considered so important is again soteriological. Through first uncovering our clinging and then working on it, we become <b>able</b> <b>to</b> finally <b>let</b> go of this sole cause for all our afflictions and suffering.|$|R

500|$|The episode further {{develops}} {{the relationship between}} Bree and Chuck, which is complicated by her involvement in the cover-up. [...] "Bree’s dilemma {{is the fact that}} she’s falling for a cop and trying to cover up this crime that she was sort of the ringleader on," [...] Daily explained. [...] "So her thing is instead of balancing work and pleasure, it’s balancing crime and pleasure." [...] Cross stated, [...] "I think we’ll figure out if that’s really a big love for her or if she’s <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> it go." [...] Jonathan Cake, who appeared as Chuck in four episodes during the seventh season, was promoted to series regular with this episode. On the relationship between Bree and Chuck, Cake stated: [...] "As a detective, he's sort of drawn to this woman who seems both quite proper and conservative and yet can't seem to stop herself from being drawn into these sort of crazy, lurid scenarios. There's a sort of wild streak in Bree somewhere that he thinks is really interesting." [...] To prepare for the role, Cake watched key episodes of the series focusing on Bree's previous relationships.|$|E
500|$|In Traveling Shoes, Angelou {{was able}} to {{recognize}} similarities between African and African-American culture; as Lupton put it, the [...] "blue songs, shouts, and gospels" [...] she has grown up with in America [...] "echo the rhythms of West Africa". Marcia Ann Gillespie and her colleagues, writing in A Glorious Celebration, the book published in 2008 for Angelou's 80th birthday, agreed, stating that Angelou recognized the connections between African and American Black cultures, including the children's games, the folklore, the spoken and non-verbal languages, the food, sensibilities, and behavior. She connected the behavior of many African mother figures, especially their generosity, with her grandmother's actions.

500|$|Hu's {{most notable}} {{work is the}} Ten Bamboo Studio Manual of Painting and Calligraphy (Shizhuzhai Shuhuapu, [...] ), an {{anthology}} of around 320 prints by around thirty different artists (including Hu himself), published in 1633. It consists of eight sections, covering calligraphy, bamboo, flowers, rocks, birds and animals, plums, orchids and fruit. Some of these sections had been released previously as single volumes. As well {{as a collection of}} artworks, it was also intended as an artistic primer, with instructions on correct brush position and technique and several pictures designed for beginners to copy. Although these instructions only appear in the sections on orchids and bamboo, the book still remains the first example of a categorical and analytical approach to Chinese painting. In this book, Hu used his multiple-block printing methods to obtain gradations of colour in the images, rather than obvious outlines or overlaps. The manual is bound in the [...] "butterfly binding" [...] (hudie zhuang, [...] ) style, whereby whole-folio illustrations are folded so that each occupies a double-page spread. This binding style allows the reader to lay the book flat in order to look at a particular image. Cambridge University Library released a complete digital scan of the manual, including all writings and illustrations in August, 2015. Said Charles Aylmer, Head of the Cambridge University Chinese Department, [...] "The binding is so fragile, and the manual so delicate, that until it was digitized, we have never been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> anyone look through it or study it – despite its undoubted importance to scholars." ...|$|E

50|$|Sabrina Lorenz {{is a young}} Kommissarin hailing from Berlin.

However, she knows what she wants and is good at her job, and forms a perfect team with Berghammer (whom she occasionally teases for his set ways).|$|R

There is also an episode where Stanley's brother sees a T-Rex in the yard but dismisses the memory when it disappears back into the book.|$|R
500|$|In {{some of the}} raw moments {{captured}} in the documentary, Beyoncé appears completely bare. During one video, Beyoncé cries and asks herself: [...] "Why did God give me this life? Sometimes it's overwhelming. Why did God give me my talent, my gift, my family. But I know you're not supposed to question God." [...] She told Entertainment Tonight: [...] "I {{wanted to do something}} a little different with the film ... I wanted people to re-experience the show in a different way. Everyone that had been to the show -- I wanted them to see things that they didn't get to see. I figured it would be cool for everyone to see it from my point of view. It's a peek behind the curtain ... honestly, more than no makeup, the emotions and just being so real and raw, I don't think I'd be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> down my guard the way I did if anybody was in the room." [...] The last minutes of the film get very sentimental, with a performance of Etta James's classic [...] "At Last" [...] set to the backdrop of Civil Rights-era footage, followed by a close-up moment when Beyoncé admits that her life can be overwhelming, although she is blessed, stating, [...] "I'm grateful... I'm alive and I'm living my dreams." [...] The film's final performance shows Beyoncé performing [...] "Halo" [...] and sees her paying tribute to Michael Jackson. She also splices in footage of an old video from the night she attended her first Michael Jackson concert as a child. At the end of the performance, the whole production wraps as Beyoncé throws up the Roc sign and exits the stage.|$|E

His goal was to weaken Daniel's grip on reality to the point where Leo could take complete and total control of his mind. However, the Project caught Daniel/Leo after the murder, erased his memory, torched his house, and had him committed to Dixmor, where they had been working to study the effects of the implant and repair the damage, without success. Upon learning the truth, Daniel determines that he must destroy Leo once and for all. He enters a deep hypnotic state and faces off against Leo within the confines of his own mind. He is finally <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> go of the guilt he feels over his wife's death, allowing him to [...] "kill" [...] Leo and assert control.|$|E

Zosia's mental state causes real concern for her father Guy. Zosia keeps a video diary where she discusses her thoughts and state of mind. He realises that she needs help and sends her to a rehab clinic. While there she is told that she has bipolar disorder but Guy refuses to believe it. Arfwedson stated that [...] "mentally unstable" [...] Zosia is [...] "terrified of her ability to lose control, but she doesn't want to admit she's got this problem; that scares her more." [...] She fears that her career is ruined and her dreams of being a psychiatrist herself will be unattainable. The actress add [...] "It leaves her wondering: 'How can I understand other people, if I can't understand myself?'" [...] When she is discharged he ignores a psychiatrist's advice that Zosia undergoes more intense treatment. Zosia insists that she is of sound mind to return to work. As the CEO, Guy is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> her return and even invites her to work alongside him in the operating theatre. But while in there he notices that Zosia is still unwell. She behaves in a [...] "frenzied and disruptive" [...] manner and Guy struggles {{to concentrate on the}} procedure and has her removed from the theatre. The actress described her character as having [...] "waves of clarity where she feels almost super-human and everything makes sense". But then she start talking really fast, no one can understand her and she cannot understand why. At this point Guy accepts that he has been in denial and Zosia is ill.
