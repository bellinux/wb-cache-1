5|$|From 1978, {{the rate}} of {{exchange}} depreciation was fixed with a tablita, an active crawling peg {{that was based on}} a timetable to announce a gradually-declining rate of depreciation. The announcements were repeated on a rolling basis to create <b>an</b> <b>environment</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> economic agents could discern a government commitment to deflation. Inflation gradually fell throughout 1980 to below 100%.|$|E

5|$|Like {{many plants}} in {{south-west}} Western Australia, B.attenuata {{is adapted to}} <b>an</b> <b>environment</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> bushfire events are relatively frequent. Most Banksia species can be placed {{in one of two}} broad groups according to their response to fire: reseeders are killed by fire, but fire also triggers the release of their canopy seed bank, thus promoting recruitment of the next generation; resprouters survive fire, resprouting from a lignotuber or, more rarely, epicormic buds protected by thick bark. Bearing epicormic buds and a lignotuber, B.attenuata is one of the latter group, with follicles that may open spontaneously or by fire.|$|E

5|$|Like {{many plants}} in {{south-west}} Western Australia, B.oligantha {{is adapted to}} <b>an</b> <b>environment</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> bushfire events are relatively frequent. Most Banksia species can be placed {{in one of two}} broad groups according to their response to fire: reseeders are killed by fire, but fire also triggers the release of their canopy seed bank, thus promoting recruitment of the next generation; resprouters survive fire, resprouting from a lignotuber or, more rarely, epicormic buds protected by thick bark. B.oligantha is a reseeder; it has thin bark, and lacks a lignotuber, so it is killed by fire. However, the species is weakly serotinous: fire triggers seed release, yet seed release still occurs in the absence of fire.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many plants}} in {{south-west}} Western Australia, Banksia caleyi {{is adapted to}} <b>an</b> <b>environment</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> bushfire events are relatively frequent. Most Banksia species can be placed {{in one of two}} broad groups according to their response to fire: reseeders are killed by fire, but fire also triggers the release of their canopy seed bank, thus promoting recruitment of the next generation; resprouters survive fire, resprouting from a lignotuber or, more rarely, epicormic buds protected by thick bark. B.caleyi belongs to the reseeder group. In the wild, seedlings take at least three to four years to reach flowering after bushfire. Non-patchy fires occurring at intervals of less than seven years may wipe out local populations of reseeders.|$|E
5|$|Luís Alves' grandfather, José Joaquim, was a Portuguese {{military}} {{officer who had}} emigrated in 1767 to Brazil. He settled {{in the city of}} Rio de Janeiro, capital of both the Rio de Janeiro captaincy and of Brazil. He had neither noble rank nor noble ancestry and lacked patrons in <b>an</b> <b>environment</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> advancement depended upon exchanges of favors and family connections. Having fought against the Spaniards on Brazil's southern frontiers, he secured a place for himself in Rio de Janeiro's upper class when he married a member of a local and influential family.|$|E

5|$|Like {{many plants}} in Australia's southwest, Banksia aculeata {{is adapted to}} <b>an</b> <b>environment</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> bushfire events are {{relatively}} frequent. Most Banksia species can be placed {{in one of two}} broad groups according to their response to fire: reseeders are killed by fire, but fire also triggers the release of their canopy seed bank, thus promoting recruitment of the next generation; resprouters survive fire, resprouting from a lignotuber or, more rarely, epicormic buds protected by thick bark. Banksia aculeata is killed by fire because it possesses neither thick protective bark nor a lignotuber to reshoot from. It is serotinous—it accumulates a canopy seed bank that is released only in response to fire—so populations typically recover rapidly after a fire, but this strategy makes it dependent on a suitable fire regime. Plants take three to four years to reach flowering after a bushfire.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many plants}} in Australia's southwest, Banksia sceptrum {{is adapted to}} <b>an</b> <b>environment</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> bushfire events are {{relatively}} frequent. Most Banksia species can be placed {{in one of two}} broad groups according to their response to fire: reseeders are killed by fire, but fire also triggers the release of their canopy seed bank, thus promoting recruitment of the next generation; resprouters survive fire, resprouting from a lignotuber or, more rarely, epicormic buds protected by thick bark. Banksia sceptrum is a reseeder—killed by bushfire and regenerating by seed. The follicles on the old flower spikes remain closed until burnt by fire, after which they open and release the seed. New plants take three to five years to flower again. If bushfires are too frequent—occurring less than four years apart—they risk eradicating local populations of reseeders.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many plants}} in {{south-west}} Western Australia, B.prionotes {{is adapted to}} <b>an</b> <b>environment</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> bushfire events are relatively frequent. Most Banksia species can be placed {{in one of two}} broad groups according to their response to fire: reseeders are killed by fire, but fire also triggers the release of their canopy seed bank, thus promoting recruitment of the next generation; resprouters survive fire, resprouting from a lignotuber or, more rarely, epicormic buds protected by thick bark. B.prionotes is unusual in that it does not fit neatly into either of these groups. It lacks a lignotuber or thick bark, and so cannot be considered a resprouter; yet it may survive or escape some fires because of its height, the sparseness of its foliage, and because it occurs in dune swales where fire are cooler and patchier. On the other hand, it is not a typical reseeder either, because of its relatively low fire mortality rates, and because it is only weakly serotinous: although fire promotes seed release, seed release still occurs in the absence of fire.|$|E

5|$|The programmers {{identified}} {{early on}} that pathfinding—the ability of the variable-sized characters to navigate through the environment—would be a problem. Huebner cited the difficulty of programming characters to navigate <b>an</b> <b>environment</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> level designers are free to add stairs, ramps, and other 3D objects. They {{came up with a}} temporary solution and planned to improve the pathfinding later into development. By the time they properly addressed the problem, many of the levels were almost complete and featured few markers the programmers could use to control movement. They could identify walkable tiles but not walls, cliffs, and other environmental hazards. Ideal solutions, such as creating zones for characters could walk through would have taken too much time to retroactively add into the 100 created levels, so the programmers spent several weeks making small, iterative fixes to conceal the obvious errors in the pathfinding and leave less obvious ones intact.|$|E
5|$|While {{humans have}} the ability to learn any {{language}}, they only do so if they grow up in <b>an</b> <b>environment</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> language exists and is used by others. Language is therefore dependent on communities of speakers in which children learn language from their elders and peers and themselves transmit language to their own children. Languages are used by those who speak them to communicate and to solve a plethora of social tasks. Many aspects of language use can be seen to be adapted specifically to these purposes. Due {{to the way in which}} language is transmitted between generations and within communities, language perpetually changes, diversifying into new languages or converging due to language contact. The process is similar to the process of evolution, where the process of descent with modification leads to the formation of a phylogenetic tree.|$|E
