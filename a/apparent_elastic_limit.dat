40|$|We {{study the}} interplay between {{martensitic}} phase transformation and plastic slip in polycrystalline media. The work is motivated by the phenomenon of superelasticity – {{the ability of the}} material to recover strains beyond their <b>apparent</b> <b>elastic</b> <b>limit</b> – observed in shape-memory alloys. Often the recovery is not perfect with residual strain after a deformation and recovery cycle, and the stress–strain curve changes with cycling. We develop a mesoscale model at the single crystal level, and use it to study polycrystals. The model is able to reproduce various observations and provide important insight into the interplay. In particular, we show that transformation and plasticity can occur synergistically, with plasticity providing a mechanism for bridging across poorly oriented and thus non-transforming grains...|$|E

The films first deform elastically with the lattice strain equal to the true strain given by digital image correlation measurements. The Cu single thin film intrinsic elastic limit of 0. 27 % is determined below the <b>apparent</b> <b>elastic</b> <b>limit</b> of W and W/Cu nanocomposite thin films, 0. 30 % and 0. 49 %, respectively. This difference {{is found to be}} driven by the existence of as-deposited residual stresses. Above the elastic limit on the lattice strain-true strain curves, we discriminate two different behaviors presumably footprints of plasticity and fracture. The Cu thin film shows a large transition domain (0. 60 % true strain range) to a plateau with a smooth evolution of the curve which is associated to peak broadening. In contrast, W and W/Cu nanocomposite thin films show a less smooth and reduced transition domain (0. 30 % true strain range) to a plateau with no peak broadening. These observations indicate that copper thin film shows some ductility while tungsten/copper nanocomposites thin films are brittle. Fracture resistance of W/Cu nanocomposite thin film is improved thanks to the high compressive residual stress and the elimination of the metastable beta-W phase...|$|E

The <b>apparent</b> <b>elastic</b> modulus increased from 11. 5 +/- 1. 3 kPa for undifferentiated myoblasts to 45. 3 +/- 4. 0 kPa after 8 days of differentiation (P < 0. 05).

Myosin expression correlated with the <b>apparent</b> <b>elastic</b> modulus, but neither myosin nor beta-tubulin were associated with hysteresis.

The independent variables in the model are chemical composition of Al–Si–Cu cast alloys andcooling rate. The dependent parameters are hardness, microhardess, yield strength and <b>apparent</b> <b>elastic</b> <b>limit.</b> Design/methodology/approach: The experimental alloy used for training of neural network was prepared at theUniversity of Windsor (Canada) in the Light Metals Casting Laboratory, in a 10 kg capacity ceramic crucible. Thermal analysis tests were conducted using the UMSA Technology Platform. Compression tests were conductedat room temperature using a Zwick universal testing machine. Prior to testing, an extensometer was used tominimize frame bending strains. Compression specimens were tested corresponding to each of the three coolingrate. Rockwell F–scale hardness tests were conducted at room temperature using a Zwick HR hardness testingmachine. Vickers microhardness tests were conducted using a DUH 202 microhardness testing machine. Findings: The results of this investigation show that there is a good correlation between experimental and predicteddates and the neural network has a great potential in mechanical behavior modeling of Al–Si–Cu castings.

Micro-finite element (microFE) analysis allows computing the <b>apparent</b> <b>elastic</b> {{properties of}} trabecular bone biopsies, but the results depend on the type of applied boundary conditions (BCs). In this study, 167 femoral trabecular cubic biopsies with a side length of 5. 3 mm were analyzed using microFE analysis to compare their stiffness systematically with kinematic uniform boundary conditions (KUBCs) and periodicity-compatible mixed uniform boundary conditions (PMUBCs). The obtained elastic constants were then used in the volume fraction and fabric-based orthotropic Zysset-Curnier model to identify their respective model parameters. As expected, PMUBCs lead to more compliant <b>apparent</b> <b>elastic</b> properties than KUBCs, especially in shear. The differences in stiffness decreased with bone volume fraction and mean intercept length. Unlike KUBCs, PMUBCs were sensitive to heterogeneity of the biopsies. The Zysset-Curnier model predicted <b>apparent</b> <b>elastic</b> constants successfully in both cases with adjusted coefficients of determination of 0. 986 for KUBCs and 0. 975 for PMUBCs.

It shows that the deformation mechanism of the progressive collapse of the foam causes the non-uniform deformation in the foam during uniaxial compression, which leads to the decrease of <b>apparent</b> <b>elastic</b> modulus with the increase of strain in the plateau stress regime. Theoretical predictions are compared with experimental results for different closed-cell polymeric foams with satisfactory agreement. It is also shown that this method is not applicable to the in-plane compression of honeycombs and the numerical modeling based on macroscopic constitutive equation is incapable of predicting the {{degradation of}} apparent modulus in progressively crushable foams.
