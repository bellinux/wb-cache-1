5|$|The New York Yankees are a Major League Baseball (MLB) {{franchise}} {{based in}} The Bronx, New York City, New York. They {{play in the}} American League East division. The {{first game of the}} new baseball season for a team is played on Opening Day, and being named the Opening Day starter is an honor, which is often given to the player who is expected to lead the pitching staff that season, though there are various strategic reasons why a team's best pitcher might not start on Opening Day. The Yankees have used 57 different Opening Day starting pitchers in their 110seasons. Since the franchise's beginning in , the 58 starters have a combined Opening Day record of 57wins, 36losses, 1tie (57–36–1), and 17no decisions. No decisions are only awarded to the starting pitcher if the game is won or lost after the starting pitcher has left the game. Although in modern baseball, ties are rare due to extra innings, in 1910, New York's Opening Game against the Boston Red Sox was declared a tie due to darkness – at the time, Hilltop Park had lacked <b>adequate</b> <b>lighting.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{right to}} {{adequate}} housing, {{also referred to}} as the right to housing, is [...] "the right to live somewhere in security, peace and dignity". It requires [...] "adequate privacy, adequate space, adequate security, <b>adequate</b> <b>lighting</b> and ventilation, adequate basic infrastructure and adequate location with regard to work and basic facilities – all at a reasonable cost". Parties must ensure security of tenure and that access is free of discrimination, and progressively work to eliminate homelessness. Forced evictions, defined as [...] "the permanent or temporary removal against their will of individuals, families and/or communities from the homes and/or land which they occupy, without the provision of, and access to, appropriate forms of legal or other protection", are a prima facie violation of the Covenant.|$|E

2500|$|Tykwer {{describes}} {{the film as}} having [...] "a distinctly dark aesthetic", due to both the lack of <b>adequate</b> <b>lighting</b> during the film's time period {{and the nature of}} its storyline. The filmmakers took inspiration from painters that specialized in darkness with few sources of light such as Caravaggio, Joseph Wright of Derby and Rembrandt. The film begins with a cool, monochromatic color palette, and as Grenouille discovers more scents, the palette warms and opens up. In the scenes where Grenouille goes to Paris for the first time, the filmmakers subtly added more powerful colors in the sets, costumes, props and lighting to represent Grenouille's experience of the new smells.|$|E

50|$|Night {{blindness}} is {{the difficulty}} {{for the eyes}} to adjust to dim light. Affected individuals are unable to distinguish images in low levels of illumination. People with night blindness have poor vision in the darkness, but see normally when <b>adequate</b> <b>light</b> is present.|$|R
50|$|Underground/fully {{recessed}} construction: The {{ground is}} excavated, {{and the house}} is set in below grade.

However, the ideal location of a plant for decoration {{may not be the}} ideal spot for plant growth. Lack of <b>adequate</b> <b>light</b> is the most common factor limiting the growth of plants {{in many areas of the}} home.

2500|$|Automotive HID may {{be called}} [...] "xenon headlamps", though they are {{actually}} metal-halide lamps that contain xenon gas. The xenon gas allows the lamps to produce minimally <b>adequate</b> <b>light</b> immediately upon start, and shortens the run-up time. The usage of argon, as is commonly done in street lights and other stationary metal-halide lamp applications, causes lamps to take several minutes to reach their full output.|$|R
50|$|Assuming <b>adequate</b> <b>light</b> and {{nutrients}} {{are available to}} plants, the limiting factor in plant growth {{is the level of}} carbon dioxide (CO2). Ways of increasing carbon dioxide levels in the grow-room include: bottled carbon dioxide, carbon dioxide generators, a milk jug and yeast solution (in which yeast grows in a container thereby emitting CO2), a baking soda and vinegar mixture in a container, or dry ice.|$|R
40|$|Dihydroxyacetone and lawsone, in a {{vanishing}} cream base, {{applied to}} the skin was found to protect patients with erythropoietic protoporphyria against sunlight.

5000|$|The {{terrain of}} Gongcheng County is mainly mountainous and hilly, {{and there are}} {{relatively}} flat small alluvial plains along the Li river. The climate of Gongcheng is subtropical monsoon climate. Summer is hot, humid and long, whereas winters are dry and short. The county also receives <b>adequate</b> <b>light</b> and abundant rainfall. The average annual sunshine is approximately 1413.7 hours, annual rainfall is approximately 1453.1 millimetres, annual average humidity is 74%.|$|R
50|$|After {{the utility}} of the {{technique}} had been demonstrated, in January 1966, workers repurposed a larger explosive forming tank for neutral buoyancy testing.

50|$|<b>Adequate</b> <b>lighting</b> and {{ventilation}} {{is provided}} for all shearers and shedhands {{who work in}} the shed. Good light is essential for quality shearing, wool classing and grinding etc., and is a very significant factor affecting sheep flow in the penning area. In the southern hemisphere southern walls can have translucent sheeting installed there as a source of natural lighting because direct sunlight is never a problem.|$|E
50|$|In the {{lighting}} industry, foot-candles {{are a common}} unit of measurement used to calculate <b>adequate</b> <b>lighting</b> levels of workspaces in buildings or outdoor spaces. Foot-candles are also commonly used in the museum and gallery fields, where lighting levels must be carefully controlled to conserve light-sensitive objects such as prints, photographs, and paintings, the colors of which fade when exposed to bright light for a lengthy period.|$|E
50|$|Plant {{resistant}} varieties and space plants properly so they receive <b>adequate</b> <b>light</b> and air circulation. Always water from below, keeping water off the foliage. This is paramount for roses. Go {{easy on the}} nitrogen fertilizer. Apply fungicides according to label directions before problem becomes severe and follow directions exactly, not missing any required treatments. Sanitation is a must - clean up and remove all leaves, flowers, or debris {{in the fall and}} destroy.|$|R
50|$|Powdery Mildew {{is usually}} found on plants {{that do not}} have enough air {{circulation}} or <b>adequate</b> <b>light.</b> Problems are worse where nights are cool and days are warm and humid. The powdery white or gray fungus is usually found on the upper surface of leaves or fruit. Leaves will often turn yellow or brown, curl up, and drop off. New foliage emerges crinkled and distorted. Fruit will be dwarfed and often drops early.|$|R
40|$|The two central {{questions}} {{in this study}} are: How does a visual response mechanism, in our case a blowfly retinula cell perform? and How does it manage to do so? The first question is relatively easily answered by means of intracellular recording of the electrical potentials forming the response to <b>adequate</b> <b>light</b> stimuli. The second question is a good question but it is far too ambitious to expect to find an answer to it as yet. [...] . Zie: Summary...|$|R

The building was designed to ensure <b>adequate</b> <b>lighting</b> and natural ventilation.|$|E
50|$|Cutter {{served as}} editor of Library Journal from 1891 to 1893. Of the many {{articles}} he wrote during this time, {{one of the most}} famous was an article called “The Buffalo Public Library in 1983”. In it, he wrote what he thought a library would be like one hundred years in the future. He spent a lot of time discussing practicalities, such as how the library arranged <b>adequate</b> <b>lighting</b> and controlled moisture in the air to preserve the books.|$|E
50|$|Physical {{environment}} {{has to be}} maintained favorable to students in terms of infrastructure, <b>adequate</b> <b>light</b> and ventilation,student teacher ratio, hygiene and safe environment. Schools should also treat students with equality,justice respect, dignity and right of the students. Give equal opportunities for all {{students to participate in}} all activities without any bias. Policy of inclusion has {{to be part of the}} school where differently abled and children from marginalized section get equal opportunities. The schools should also be well equipped with libraries, laboratories and educational technology laboratories.|$|R
25|$|Of steel-frame {{structure}} {{sheathed in}} Indiana limestone, with Deer Island granite at its base, the tower was advertised as “A Business Building for Building Business.” It has six wings {{stemming from a}} central tower. Though stepped buildings in New York City had been a common solution for Manhattan's strict 1916 zoning policies regarding <b>adequate</b> <b>light</b> and air, there were no such restrictions in Providence; nevertheless, New York architects Walker & Gillette chose to include the innovative symmetrical stepped massing, {{with the assistance of}} local architect George Frederick Hall.|$|R
50|$|Devonshire Community Public School {{was built}} in 1910. Its Collegiate Gothic style is typical of Ottawa schools of this era. It {{features}} a Tudor arch entranceway, stone and brick details and stone foundation common to these structures. Its large windows and plan reflect its use as a school and the emphasis placed on providing <b>adequate</b> <b>light</b> and air circulation. For instance, the windows were designed specifically to allow sunshine to reach the interior wall of each classroom, thereby maximizing natural light and creating a healthy learning environment for its children.|$|R
