5|$|The {{real purpose}} of Đôn asking for martial law was to {{maneuver}} troops in readiness for a coup, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> concrete {{plans to send}} the regular army into the pagodas. Nhu sidestepped him and {{took the opportunity to}} discredit the army by using Tung's Special Forces and the combat police to attack the pagodas. Đính, the officer most trusted by the Ngô family, was the only general who was given advance notice of the raids.|$|E
5|$|After the trial, Kenealy instigated {{a popular}} radical reform movement, the Magna Charta Association, which championed the Claimant's cause for some years. Kenealy {{was elected to}} Parliament in 1875 as a radical {{independent}} but was not an effective parliamentarian. The movement was in decline when the Claimant was released in 1884, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> dealings with it. In 1895, he confessed to being Orton, only to recant almost immediately. He lived generally in poverty {{for the rest of}} his life and was destitute at the time of his death in 1898. Although most commentators have accepted the court's view that the Claimant was Orton, some analysts believe that an element of doubt remains as to his true identity and that, conceivably, he was Roger Tichborne.|$|E

5|$|The 14-day {{trial of}} Took began on 11 July 2005 before Justice Lai Kew Chai in the High Court. The {{prosecution}} relied on 76 witnesses, a video in which Took re-enacted the murder, forensic evidence and an autopsy that found several bruises on Huang Na's head. Based on the evidence, the prosecution alleged that Took lured Huang Na to the storeroom, then stripped and sexually assaulted her. After smothering and stomping {{on her to}} ensure her death, he stored her body in nine layers of plastic bags stuffed into a sealed cardboard box. The defence relied on the claim of diminished responsibility. Psychiatrist R. Nagulendran argued that Took was schizophrenic, as some of his behaviour, such as frequently smiling to himself and talking of spirits, was inappropriate <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> motive for the murder – Nagulendran also called Took's story about the three Chinese men a delusion.|$|E

25|$|On 22 December 1946, the {{manuscript}} was complete. Lucia, who now reciprocated Levi's love, {{helped him to}} edit it, to make the narrative flow more naturally.

25|$|Following the marriage, Tudor {{transferred}} to the 3rd Battalion, the Royal Tank Corps, which was based at Lydd, Kent, England.

The couple lived privately, but were often overheard laughing in the garden of their house. Though Tudor's income had been reduced when he left the Hussars <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> personal fortune, he had enough money to pay for a nurse for Larissa and to keep a horse stabled at a nearby farm.|$|E
25|$|According to Percival Serle, Denison {{was a man}} of high {{character}} and a good administrator. In his early days in Tasmania he spoke too frankly about the colonists in communications which he regarded as confidential, and this accentuated the feeling against him {{as a representative of the}} colonial office during the anti-transportation and responsible government movements. He showed great interest in the life of the colony, and helped to foster education, science and trade, during the period when Tasmania was developing into a prosperous colony. In New South Wales his task was easier, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> difficulty in coping adequately with the problems that arose during the early days of responsible government in Australia.|$|E

25|$|Soult marched {{south on}} 30 January 1809, aiming for Portugal. After being {{repelled}} in his initial attempt {{to cross the}} Minho River in mid-February, his forces marched to Ourense and crossed the bridge there. Soult's cavalry crushed a Spanish brigade at La Trepa on 6 March and the II Corps entered Portugal on the 9th. At the Battle of Braga on 20 March, the French routed a Portuguese army consisting of a few regulars and 22,000 militia. The First Battle of Porto on the 29th was another lopsided French victory marked by terrible Portuguese loss of life. But despite being established in Porto, Soult found his communications cut by regular and irregular Portuguese forces under General Francisco Silveira <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> idea of the whereabouts of Lapisse.|$|E
25|$|The bullet {{which killed}} Chevenix hit the gong (as {{the door to}} the study was open), which made Susan think that she heard the first gong (dinner was usually served after the valet would strike the gong 2 times), and it was Ms Lingard who smashed the mirror and made the whole affair look like suicide. She blew a paper bag to fake a shot. Poirot claims to suspect Ruth because he {{suspected}} Ms Lingard would rescue her daughter and confess, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> evidence against Ms Lingard. After everyone leaves and Ms Lingard stays alone in the room, she asks Poirot not to tell Ruth that she is her real mother. Poirot agrees as Ms Lingard is terminally ill, and does not reveal anything to Ruth who wonders why Ms Lingard committed the murder.|$|E

However, Caritoux did hold the lead and went into the final day with a 37 seconds lead, the final stage was a time trial, Caritoux was no time trialler and nearest rival Alberto Fernandez was. Caritoux rode the time trial knowing this might be his only chance to win a major race, his determination came through and won the 1984 Vuelta a España by a mere six seconds.|$|E
