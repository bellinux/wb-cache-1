5|$|The {{village of}} Mere was <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> {{unimportant}} {{settlement in the}} early 13th century. In 1243 Richard, the Earl of Cornwall, acquired the manor. Richard was the brother of Henry III and immensely rich. In 1253 he began to build a castle at Mere.|$|E
5|$|Both <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> large {{coat of arms}} existed from 1949 until 1957 {{based on}} {{representations}} of them prior to 1936. In 1957 both the large and small city coat of arms were newly arranged by the designer Eduard Ege. At the same time, the city council set the resolution on the December 17, 1957 that the large one was no longer for official use but only for particular representative purposes.|$|E
5|$|During the High Middle Ages, Crompton was a {{collection}} of scattered woods, farmsteads, moorland, swamp and a single corn mill, occupied by <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> close community of families. The area was thinly populated and consisted of several dispersed hamlets, including Whitfield, High Crompton, Cowlishaw, Birshaw and Bovebeale (above Beal). These hamlets were situated above the water-logged valley bottoms and below the exposed high moors. Owing to complicated local arrangements of land tenure, inheritance, and absentee landlords, the local lordship was weak, and Crompton failed to emerge as a manor with its own lord and court. This slowly facilitated comparative freedoms and independence for the early people of Crompton, which encouraged the influx of families from the neighbouring parish of Rochdale, including the Buckleys, Cleggs, Greaves and Milnes.|$|E

5|$|Euchambersia was <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> short-snouted therocephalian, {{possessing}} large canines as {{is typical}} of the group. However, it is notable among therocephalians for possessing ridges on its canines and a large indentation {{in the side of the}} skull. Under the erroneous assumption that the canines are grooved instead of ridged, it has been proposed that these structures supported a venom delivery mechanism. More recently, the internal structure of the skull of Euchambersia has been used as stronger evidence in favour of the hypothesis that it was venomous; other possibilities, such as the indentation supporting some sort of sensory organ, still remain plausible.|$|E
5|$|Following the attack, Sakonju judged {{that it was}} too {{dangerous}} to continue the raid as Behars distress message may have alerted the Allies to his force's presence. Accordingly, the Japanese turned back for the NEI that day. The heavy cruisers were again escorted through the Sunda Strait by Kinu, Ōi and five destroyers, and arrived back at the NEI on 15March. During this time, the Behar survivors were held in <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> extremely hot store room on board Tone, and were given little access to food and water, sanitary facilities and exercise.|$|E

5|$|Historically in Lancashire, Crompton (as it was {{originally}} known) and its surroundings have provided evidence of ancient British and Anglian activity in the area. During the Middle Ages, Crompton formed a small township of scattered woods, farmsteads, moorland, and swamp with <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> close community of families. The local lordship was weak or absent, and so Crompton failed to emerge as a manor with its own lord and court. Farming was the main industry of this broadly independent and self-supporting rural area, with locals supplementing their incomes by hand-loom woollen weaving in the domestic system.|$|E
5|$|Python is {{a widely}} used {{high-level}} programming language for general-purpose programming, created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. An interpreted language, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability (notably using whitespace indentation to delimit code blocks rather than curly brackets or keywords), and a syntax that allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than might be used in languages such as C++ or Java. The language provides constructs intended to enable writing clear programs on both <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> large scale.|$|E
5|$|The Austro-Hungarian Navy, {{which had}} <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> largely {{obsolete}} U-boat fleet, immediately began salvage efforts and succeeded in raising the lightly damaged submarine in early February 1915. After a refit, {{the boat was}} commissioned as SM U-14 in June, but had little success early in her career. When her commander fell ill in October, he was replaced by Georg Ritter von Trapp. U-14 was damaged by a depth charge attack in February 1916, and underwent an extensive modernization through November. Resuming duty under von Trapp, U-14 sank her first ship in April 1917, but had her most successful patrol in August, when she sank five ships—including , reportedly the largest cargo ship in the world—in a six-day span.|$|E

5|$|The Pondicherry shark (Carcharhinus hemiodon) is an {{extremely}} rare species of requiem shark, in the family Carcharhinidae. <b>A</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> stocky gray shark, it grows not much longer than , {{and it has a}} fairly long, pointed snout. This species can be identified by the shape of its upper teeth, which are strongly serrated near the base and smooth-edged near the tip, and by its first dorsal fin, which is large with a long free rear tip. Furthermore, this shark has prominent black tips on its pectoral fins, second dorsal fin, and caudal fin lower lobe.|$|E
5|$|Two {{weeks prior}} to the premiere, Chaplin decided to have an unpublicized preview at Los Angeles' Tower Theatre. It went poorly, {{attracting}} <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> unenthusiastic crowd. Better results were seen at the gala premiere on January 30, 1931 at the Los Angeles Theater. Albert Einstein {{and his wife were}} the guests of honor, and the film received a standing ovation. It next premiered at the George M. Cohan Theater in New York where Chaplin closely supervised the release, spending the day doing interviews, and previously spending $60,000 on the advertising, as he was frustrated with what UA's publicists had come up with. Chaplin demanded half of the total gross, and considering audiences would be more attracted by the film itself than its technology, he demanded higher ticket prices compared to talkies.|$|E
5|$|Voyager 2 passed {{closer to}} Enceladus (87,010km) on August 26, 1981, {{allowing}} higher-resolution images to be obtained. These images showed a young surface. They also revealed a surface with different regions with vastly different surface ages, with a heavily cratered mid- to high-northern latitude region, and a lightly cratered region {{closer to the}} equator. This geologic diversity contrasts with the ancient, heavily cratered surface of Mimas, another moon of Saturn slightly smaller than Enceladus. The geologically youthful terrains came as a great surprise to the scientific community, because no theory was then able to predict that such <b>a</b> <b>small</b> (<b>and</b> cold, compared to Jupiter's highly active moon Io) celestial body could bear signs of such activity.|$|E

5|$|Bonnie {{continued}} to the west-northwest; late on August 9, the storm presented a 9-mile (15-km) wide eyewall, {{a very unusual}} occurrence in <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> weak tropical storm. Bonnie quickly strengthened while turning to the north, a directional shift caused by {{a break in the}} mid-level ridge. The storm briefly weakened late on August 10; it re-strengthened again the following day to attain a peak intensity of 65mph (100km/h). Soon after, strong southwesterly wind shear disrupted the storm, causing Bonnie to weaken again. On August 12, Bonnie made landfall just south of Apalachicola as a 45mph (75km/h) tropical storm. It quickly weakened to a tropical depression, and accelerated northeastward through the southeastern United States. After paralleling the Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina coastlines, Bonnie lost its tropical characteristics on August 14 to the east of New Jersey. Its remnant low continued northeastward, making landfall in Massachusetts and Maine and continuing into Atlantic Canada.|$|E
5|$|Captain Lawrence {{realised}} {{that his}} ship's speed {{would take it}} past Shannon and ordered a 'pilot's luff'. This was <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> brief turn to windward which would make the sails shiver and reduce the ship's speed. Just after Chesapeake began this limited turn away from Shannon, she had her means of manoeuvring entirely disabled as {{a second round of}} accurate British fire caused more losses, most critically to the men and officers manning Chesapeakes quarterdeck. Here the helmsmen were killed by a 9-pounder gun that Broke had ordered installed on the quarter deck for that very purpose, and the same gun shortly afterwards shot away the wheel itself. Surviving American gun crews did land hits on Shannon in their second round of fire, especially American carronade fire which swept Shannons forecastle, killing three men, wounding others and disabling Shannons nine pounder bow gun while one round shot demolished Shannons ship's bell.|$|E

Produced by Pritish Nandy, publishing director of The Times of India, the film was made on a budget of Rs.25million (US$525,000), marking the sixth {{in a row of}} small to medium budget films made by Pritish Nandy Communications (PNC). Despite being part of a wave of offbeat films that mostly failed to make an impact at the box office, it drew public attention upon its release, which led to a commercial success among a restricted audience targeted by a selective release in twenty cities. It {{was one of the first}} films made in Hinglish, a mixture of Hindi and English. In 2005, she starred in Shaadi No. 1, which had no female lead. This comedy, based on the theme of modern marriage, was directed by David Dhawan, a renowned film director from this genre.|$|E
