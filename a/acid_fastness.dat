40|$|A {{new type}} of slowly growing, nonphotochromogenic {{mycobacterium}} was recovered from two patients with disseminated disease. The growth characteristics, <b>acid</b> <b>fastness,</b> and mycolic acids were consistent with those forMycobacterium species. The results of biochemical investigations, lipid analyses, and comparative 16 S rRNA sequencing showed that these isolates represent a new slowly growing Mycobacterium species which is named Mycobacterium conspicuum. Mycobacteria are aerobic, nonmobile bacteria that are char-acteristically acid fast (28). The property of <b>acid</b> <b>fastness,</b> {{which is due to}} waxy materials in the cell wall, is particularly impor-tant for recognizing mycobacteria. Members of the genus My-cobacterium are widespread in nature and range from soil-dwelling saprophytes to pathogens of humans and animals (29). Identification of mycobacteria has traditionally relied upon biochemical tests and lipid analysis (10, 24).

The {{effects of}} the nature and orientation of the substituents on the color and dyeing properties of these dyes for polyester fibers were evaluated. The newly synthesized compounds were characterized on the basis of elemental analyses and spectral data. On the other hand, the investigated dyes were applied to polyester fabrics and showed good light, washing, heat, and <b>acid</b> perspiration <b>fastness.</b> The remarkable degree of brightness after washings is indicative of the good penetration and the excellent affinity of these dyes for the fabric. The results in general revealed the efficiency of the prepared compounds as new monoazo disperse dyes.

40|$|SummaryMycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} infection remains a major {{global health}} problem complicated by escalating rates of antibiotic resistance. Despite the established role of mycolic acid cyclopropane modification in pathogenesis, the feasibility of targeting this enzyme family for antibiotic development is unknown. We show through genetics and chemical biology that mycolic acid methyltransferases are essential for M.  tuberculosis viability, cell wall structure, and intrinsic resistance to antibiotics. The tool compound dioctylamine, which we show acts as a substrate mimic, directly inhibits the function of multiple mycolic acid methyltransferases, resulting in loss of cyclopropanation, cell death, loss of <b>acid</b> <b>fastness,</b> and synergistic killing with isoniazid and ciprofloxacin. These results demonstrate that mycolic acid methyltransferases are a promising antibiotic target and that a family of virulence factors can be chemically inhibited with effects not anticipated from studies of each individual enzyme...|$|E
40|$|Acid-fast {{bacteria}} in the boundary surface between salt solution and a test oil (tricaprylin) are spontaneously wet and enveloped by the oil. This behavior contrasts with that of all other cells studied by the interfacial tension method. Four strains of human tubercle bacillus and an atypical bovine strain are {{an exception to the}} first statement above. These have possessed stability in the saline-oil interface; this stability is slight, however, and not comparable with that of non-acid-fast bacteria. Acid-fast bacteria subjected to prolonged extraction with alcohol show resistance to wetting by oil comparable to that of non-acid-fast bacteria. These "defatted" bacteria nevertheless retain their acid-fast staining properties. <b>Acid</b> <b>fastness</b> cannot then depend on the integrity of a surface membrane. Study of the cataphoresis of acid-fast bacteria by Freund has rendered the presence of protein in the surface highly probable. We are forced then to regard the surface of acid-fast bacteria as complex, containing at least lipoid and protein. Not improbably also carbohydrate is present...|$|E
40|$|A {{new species}} of rapidly growing, nonphotochromogenic mycobacteria, Mycobacterium alvei, is described. The {{inclusion}} of this organism in the genus Mycobacterium is based on its <b>acid</b> <b>fastness,</b> its mycolate pattern, and its G+C content. A study of six strains showed that they form a homogeneous group with an internal phenotypic similarity value of 97 ± 2. 22 %. DNA relatedness studies showed that the six M. alvei strains which we studied form a single DNA hybridization group which is less than 49 % related to 14 other species of the genus Mycobacterium; the ΔT(m) values determined for the strains which exhibited higher levels of DNA homology were all greater than 7. 9 °C. A lipid analysis showed that tuberculostearic acid was present. Docosanoic and tetracosanoic acid methyl esters were detected as mycolic acid cleavage products. All six isolates which we tested contained α-mycolic acids and relatively large amounts {{of a new kind}} of mycolic acid containing a methoxy group at ω- 1 position, a characteristic that has not been described previously in mycobacteria. Strain CR- 21 is the type strain; a culture of this strain has been deposited in the Collection Nationale de Cultures de Microorganismes de l'Institut Pasteur, Paris, France, as strain CIP 103464. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{reports of}} {{diarrhea}} resulting from Cyclospora {{species have been}} linked to travelers and immunocompromised patients. We conducted a prospective study of 1, 042 formalin-ethyl acetate fecal concentrates collected from patients with diarrhea. Between May and November 1993, we identified three patients for whom studies were positive for nonrefractile spherical organisms measuring 10 �m in diameter and containing a cluster of refractile membrane-bound globules. The cysts exhibited variable <b>acid</b> <b>fastness</b> consistent with Cyclospora species. These three patients had no history of recent travel and presented with relapsing, watery, nonbloody diarrhea that lasted from 12 days to 8 weeks. No other parasitic or bacterial pathogens were identified in their stools. All three instances of diarrhea occurred in May or June. No common source of food or water was identified. None of these patients were immunosuppressed, and their diarrhea resolved spontaneously. We suggest that Cyclospora species should be considered in community-acquired diarrhea. Cyclospora cayetanensis is a newly recognized protozoal parasite. It has been implicated as the etiologic agent of prolonged watery diarrhea, fatigue, and anorexia in humans. The mechanism of transmission is presumed to be ingestion of contaminated water (1). First reported in the diarrheal stools of travelers to Mexico and Haiti (13), these Cyclospora organisms have since been identified in patients in the United States...|$|E
40|$|Context: Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} (MTB), {{the human}} pathogen causes Tuberculosis (TB). It {{is a highly}} infectious and globally pandemic disease. The severity increases when the MTB becomes resistant to antituberculosis drugs. India {{is reported to be}} in the second place, with the highest number of drug-resistant TB cases. The treatment of drug-resistant TB is even more complicated. Materials and Methods: The present study comprises of 159 TB patients, in which 88 are reported to have drug-resistant TB (55. 3 %). All the patients are in the age group of 18 - 70 years. Patients having extrapulmonary TB and diabetes were excluded from the study. The collected samples were processed and stained for <b>acid</b> <b>fastness</b> and smear positivity. They were subjected to inoculation on Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ) slants. Results: The results showed that out of the four drugs - Streptomycin, Isoniazid, Rifampicin, and Ethambutol - the resistant cases reported in Streptomycin were 45 (24. 9 %), whereas, in Isoniazid, Rifampicin, and Ethambutol, the resistant cases were 62 (34. 2 %), 27 (14. 9 %), and 47 (26. 0 %), respectively. Isoniazid showed the highest percentage of resistance among the patients. Conclusion: Effective measures such as convincing the patients to take the prescribed drugs and follow the five major strategies under the Directly Observed Treatment, Short Course (DOTS), could help in managing such cases...|$|E
40|$|Objective/Background: Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} (MTB) causes {{active tuberculosis}} (TB) {{in only a}} small percentage of infected people. In most cases, the infection is clinically latent, where bacilli can persist in human hosts for years without causing disease. Surprisingly, the biology of such persister cells is largely unknown. This study describes the isolation, identification, and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of latent TB bacilli after 782 days (26 months) of latency (the ability of MTB bacilli to lie persistent). Methods: The in vitro double-stress model of latency (oxygen and nutrition) was designed for MTB culture. After 26 months of latency, MTB cells that persisted were isolated and investigated under light and atomic force microscopy. Spoligotyping and WGS were performed to verify the identity of the strain. Results: We established a culture medium in which MTB bacilli arrest their growth, reduce their size (0. 3 – 0. 1 μm), lose their <b>acid</b> <b>fastness</b> (85 – 90 %) and change their shape. Spoligopatterns of latent cells were identical to original H 37 Rv, with differences observed at spacers two and 14. WGS revealed only a few genetic changes relative to the already published H 37 Rv reference genome. Among these was a large 2064 -bp insertion (RvD 6), which was originally detected in both H 37 Ra and CDC 1551, but not H 37 Rv. Conclusion: Here, we show cell-wall free cells of MTB bacilli in their latent state, and the biological adaptation of these cells was more phenotypic in nature than genomic. These cell-wall free cells represent a good model for understanding the nature of TB latency...|$|E
40|$|Substances {{possessing}} the same histochemical properties as the ceroid in cirrhotic livers of rats fed choline-deficient diets {{have been prepared}} from various unsaturated fats, fatty acids and their esters by autoxidation but {{could not be obtained}} from hydrocarbons or saturated fats or fatty acids. The formation of ceroid-like substances occurred first on surfaces or at interfaces in the reaction mixtures. It was inhibited by antioxidants and was accelerated by the addition of tissues, blood cells, erythrocytic stroma, or hemoglobin, by emulsification, by increasing the surface exposed to the air, and by increasing the temperature. Histochemical studies provided much evidence that the following properties of ceroid might be attributed to the products of the autoxidation of unsaturated lipids: insolubility in organic solvents, sudanophilia, yellowing by concentrated nitric acid, positive periodic acid-Schiff's reaction, basophilia, <b>acid</b> <b>fastness,</b> positive hernofuscin reaction, and reduction of diammine silver carbonate and alkaline potassium permanganate. The normal reactivity of cells or tissues embedded in ceroid was effectively masked by the pigment, apparently, initially at least, by preventing the reagents' gaining access to them. It is suggested that the iron sometimes demonstrated in ceroid may be that of blood cells or tissue fragments incompletely masked by the ceroid. It is concluded that whenever conditions are such that unsaturated fats accumulate in tissues {{to such an extent that}} a relative lack of biological anti-oxidants results, autoxidation of the fats and their conversion to ceroid pigment are favored, and that ceroid and the lipofuscin pigment of vitamin E deficiency may be fundamentally similar...|$|E
40|$|Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} (MTB) can persist {{within the}} human host for years without causing disease, in a syndrome known as latent tuberculosis. The {{mechanisms by which}} M. tuberculosis establishes a latent metabolic state is unknown, but it is hypothesized that reduced oxygen tension may trigger the bacillus to enter a state of latency. Therefore, we are studying anaerobic culture of M. tuberculosis (H 37 RV) {{as a model of}} latency. For the first time, the sequential adaptation of latent bacilli (every 90 days for 48 months) viewed under Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). Two types of adaptation were observed and are described here. First, cells are undergoing temporary adaptation (from 1 to 18 months of latency) that includes; thickening of cell wall (20. 5 ± 1. 8 nm versus 15. 2 ± 1. 8 nm, P< 0. 05), formation of ovoid cells by “folding phenomena”(65 - 70 %), size reduction (0. 8 ± 0. 1 μm versus 2. 5 ± 0. 5 μm), and budding type of cell division (20 - 25 %). A second feature include changes that accompany development of specialized cells i. e., production of spore like cells (0. 5 ± 0. 2 μm) and their progeny (filterable non -acid fast forms; 150 to 300 μm in size). Although, these cells were not real spore because they fail to form a heat resistant colony forming units, after incubation for 35 - 40 min at 65 °C. The filterable non-acid fast forms of bacilli are metabolically active and increased their number by symmetrical type of cell-division. Therefore, survival strategies that developed by M. tuberculosis under oxygen limited condition are linked to its shape, size and conspicuous loss of <b>acid</b> <b>fastness...</b>|$|E
40|$|Mycobacteriosis affects {{various species}} of fish, {{including}} those cultured with commercial purposes. It is a chronic systemic with granuloma forming disease known as fish mycobacteriosis. In {{the last few}} years the interest of fish culture has been increasing due to the reduction of the natural fish stocks. However the intensification of fish culture has collaborated to the development of diseases such as mycobacteriosis, causing losses due to the chronic characteristics and difficult diagnosis. This study is to report two cases of mycobacteriosis observed at "Laboratório de Piscicultura Estuarina e Marinha of the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande (FURG) ", one for Brazilian flounder Paralichthys orbignyanus and another for barber goby Elacatinus figaro. The Fite-Faraco staining protocol was used. Membranes of mycobacterial cells contain a waxy substance composed of mycolic acids. These are ß-hydroxy carboxylic acids with chain lengths of up to 90 carbon atoms. The property of <b>acid</b> <b>fastness</b> is related to the carbon chain length of the mycolic acid found in any particular species. The fish mycobacterium is much less acid and alcohol fast than the tubercle bacillus and the classic Ziehl-Neelsen Staining Protocol may give false results. The presence of mycobacterial antigen lesions was studied by immunohistological methods using monoclonal antibodies to Mycobacterium marinum. Humans may be infected by these bacteria and develop cutaneous granuloma. In this paper the necessity is stressed for a correct diagnosis of the disease, contributing to the prevention of its establishment in aquatic facilities, and thus, preserving cultured fish as well as human beings from infection. As micobacterioses afetam várias espécies de peixes, tanto comerciais como ornamentais. É uma enfermidade sistêmica com formação de granulomas, conhecida como micobacteriose de peixes. O desenvolvimento da aquicultura tem aumentado o número de casos com essa enfermidade que muitas vezes é de difícil diagnóstico. Neste trabalho apresentamos dois casos de micobacterioses em Paralichthys orbignyanus e Elacatinus figaro provenientes do Laboratório de Piscicultura Estuarina e Marinha da Universidade Federal do Rio Grande (FURG). As micobactérias de peixes possuem menos ácidos graxos que as de mamíferos, por isso foi utilizado o protocolo de coloração de Fite-Faraco, uma vez que o protocolo de coloração clássico de Ziehl Neelsen pode resultar em falsos negativos. Para determinar o tipo de micobactéria foi utilizada a imuno-histoquímica com a qual se pode diagnosticar a presença de Mycobacterium marinum. A enfermidade pode ser transmitida para o homem e com esse trabalho ressalta-se a necessidade de fazer o diagnóstico correto e implantar medidas de proteção para as pessoas que estão em contato com os peixes infectados...|$|E
40|$|The project {{undertaken}} {{aimed at}} the exploitation of locally isolated bacteria {{for the production of}} amino acids. For this purpose, six strains of amino acid producing-bacteria were isolated from local soils and water samples by employing nutrient agar, Leifson's medium (18), MacConkey's bi 1 esalt-lactose-peptone liquid and agar media (20), and EMB agar. The methods employed in the screening and isolation procedures were microscopic examination of unstained and stained slide preparations, plating methods, presumptive coliform test and Eijkman test. Cultural morphological and physiological studies showed that the strains isolated were Escherichia coli, Aerobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella czaenae, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Bacillus megaterium and Bacillus subtilis, representing families Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonadaceae and Bacillaceae respectively. Cultural characteristics were studied by observing size, shape, margin, elevation, consistancy, odour, optical features and pigmentation of colonies on agar plates (nutrient agar, MacConkey agar, EMB agar, Endo agar and ammonium salt glucose agar), as well as growth patterns on agar slants, gelatin stabs, potatoes and nutrient broth. Streak, pour and spread plate techniques (17, 24) were used in the preparation or agar plates. Cultural characteristic studies revealed that E. coli, A. aerogenes and K. ozaenae were lactose fermenters and produced pink Colonies of different shades, having different consistancies, on MacConkey agar. The colonies of A. aerogenes resembled those of E. coli in every respect except for the slightly mucoid character exhibited by the former. K. ozaenae, though a lactose fermenter, produced much bigger and highly mucoid colonies which coalesced and became golden-brown with age. The colonies of P. fluorescens resembled those of E. coli and A. aerogenes in shape, smoothness, edge and elevation, and produced good growth on MacConkey agar. However the organisms were found to be non-Iactose-fermenters and chromogenetic, and made the dark brown colour of MacConkey agar dirty due to the excretion of greenish colour into the medium:. B. subtilis and B. megaterium failed to grow on MacConkey agar even after prolonged incubation, under optimum growth conditions. Thus MacConkey agar was found to be an excellent differential as well as selective medium which enabled not only the separation of Gram-negative fromGram-positive bacilli, but also helped to distinguish lactose fermenting Gram-negative bacilli from non-lactose fermenters. Morphological characteristi s were studied by means of Gram reaction (25, 312), <b>acid</b> <b>fastness</b> (Ziel-Neelson's method), motility test (26, 27) and spore test (heat resistant method) with modifications where required. Gram reaction revealed that E. coli, A. aerogenes, K. ozaenae and P. fluorescens were Gram-negative and species of Bacillus were Gram-positive. The cells of E. coli, A. aerogenes and p. fluorescens were seen to be short rods of 0. 5 by 1. 5 microns, 0. 8 by 1. 9 microns and 0. 28 by 1 microns respectively. The cells of K. ozaenae were found to been capsulated plump rods of 0. 9 by 2. 8 microns. All these Gram-negative bacilli were found to be non-spore formers and arranged mostly singly and rarely in pairs'. The cells of the species of Bacillus, appeared to be straight rectangular rods of 1. 5 to 2 by 5. 5 to 6 microns, occurring singly and also in pairs, and arranged end to end in chains'. They were found to be sporeformers - the spores being oval in-shape and central in position and nearly of the same cross diameter as the bacilli. Microscopic examination was done under oil immersion at a magnification of 2000 times by means of bright field microscopy. Test for <b>acid</b> <b>fastness</b> showed that the bacteria tested were all non-acid fast. The motility test revealed that E. coli and P. fluorescens were actively motile, A. aerognes slightly motile and K. ozaenae and species of Bacillus non-motile. It was seen from the spore test that only the species of Bacillus bore spores and the rest were non-spore formers. Physiological studies performed included Catalase test (29, 30), Oxidase test (32, 33, 34, 35), Oxidation fermentation test (O. F. test) (37), Indole production test (40, 41, 42), Methyl red test (44), Voges Proskaur test (45, 47, 306, 310), Citrate utilization test (48), Haemolysin production test (50, 51), Oxygen relation (54, 161), Hydrogen-sulphide production test (55, 56), Urease activity test (57, 58), temperature relation (159, 160), pH for growth (170, 171, 172, 173), Nitrate reduction test (304), Gluconate test (307), Carbohydrate break-doM 1 test (309, 311). The results of these tests revealed that indole was produced only by E. coli whereas acetylmethyl carbinol production was done by A. aerogenes. K. ozaenae and B. subtilies A positive methyl red test was shown by E. coli & K. Ozaenae but citrate was utilized by all organisms but E. coli gattalse production was observed in case or all bacteria but E. coli, and a positive oxidase test was given by K. ozaenae and P. fluorescens only. Hydrogen sulphide was produced by B. subtilis & P. fluorescens but nitrate was reduced by all the bacteria but B. megaterium. Ammonia production was shown by K. ozaenae, P. fluorescens and species of Bacillus. From the results or of test, it was evident that p. fluorescens was oxidative, B. subtilis, was oxidative as well as fermentative, whereas E. coli A. aerogenes and K. ozaenae were fermentative. A wholly positive gluconate test was obtained only in case of A. aerogenes. Acid and gas production varied in carbohydrate-break-down-test. For example acid and gas were produced by E. Coli, A. aerogenes and K. Ozaenae in glucose, sucrose and lactose, whereas acid without gas was produced by B. subtilis, B. megaterium and P. fluorescens in glucose. Acid was produced by all the organisms in mannitol. A partial haemolysis of blood was brought about only by species of Bacillus. Optimum growth temperature in case of all gram-negative bacilli was found to be 37 o C but in case of B. subtillis, and B. Megaterium, it ranged between 25 o to 35 oC. All organisms under study were found to be aerobic but species of Bacillus were also facultatively anaerobic. pH for growth ranged from 6. 5 to 7. 5. Identification of bacteria was achieved by comparing the results obtained, with those recorded in the diagnostic tables given by Cowan and steel (21) {{as well as with the}} information given in Bargey's manual of Determinative Bacteriology (60). An endeavour was also made to derive biochemical mutants by employing physical and chemical methods of mutation.
