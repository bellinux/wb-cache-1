40|$|Some Stemona {{alkaloids}} {{belonging to}} the tuberostemospironine group possess a spirolactone moiety with <b>anti-configuration</b> (C- 9 /C- 9 a). In this paper, we describe two approaches to this structural unity. By using bromine atom as a traceless directing group, the SmI 2 -mediated reductive coupling of ketone 6 and β-bromomethacrylate proceeded with complete anti-diastereoselectivity. In {{the absence of an}} α-directing (chelation) group, the one-pot reaction of the ketone derived from alcohol 15 with the organozinc reagent generated from bromomethacrylate afforded spiro-α-methylene-γ-lactone derivative 16 as a single diastereomer. These two highly diastereoselective methods would find application in the synthesis of stemona alkaloids containing anti-configured spiro-lactone/pyrrolidine moieties. In addition, on the basis of our previous work, the total synthesis of (&# 8722;) - 9 -epi- 11 -demethylsessilifoliamide J (11), and an improved synthesis of (&# 8722;) - 9, 11 -di-epi-sessilifoliamide J were accomplished. Completely anti-diastereoselective: This can be achieved by using bromine atom as a traceless directing group in the SmI 2 -mediated reductive coupling of α,β-unsaturated ester with ketones; or by the one-pot reaction of the organozinc reagent generated from bromomethacrylate with ketone. On the basis of these results, two approaches to the spirolactone moiety with <b>anti-configuration</b> (C- 9 /C- 9 a) found in some Stemona alkaloids were disclosed...|$|E
40|$|The various {{methods of}} {{investigating}} the crystal structure of sinigrin {{have led to}} the determination of parameters for the potassium and sulfur atoms. The potassium parameters were found by the use of the Patterson function while the parameters of the sulfur atoms were found by the use of the Patterson function and Fourier projections. On considering the distance between the two sulfur atoms and after examination of the neighboring peaks on the Fourier projections, it is probably safe to assume that the two sulfur atoms are of the syn-configuration. This is in agreement with the proposed <b>anti-configuration</b> for the sulfate group and the migrating group as proposed by Lundeen and Ettlinger. The parameters for the potassium and sulfur atoms are listed in Table 2.

40|$|Recently, we have {{reported}} {{on the existence of}} some monopoles, multimonopole, and antimonopoles configurations. In this paper we would like to present more monopoles, multimonopole, and antimonopoles configurations of the magnetic ansatz of Ref. [9] when the parameters p and b of the solutions takes different serial values. These exact solutions are a different kind of BPS solution. They satisfy the first order Bogomol’nyi equation but possess infinite energy. They can have radial, axial, or rotational symmetry about the z-axis. We classified these serial solutions as (i) the multimonopole at the origin; (ii) the finitely separated 1 -monopoles; (iii) the screening solutions of multimonopole and (iv) the axially symmetric monopole solutions. We also give a construction of their <b>anti-configurations</b> with all the magnetic charges of poles in the configurations reversed. Half-integer topological magnetic charge multimonopole also exist in some of these series of solutions. ...|$|R
