5000|$|It was on Reed's {{initiative}} that the fateful mission which had Susan Storm, Johnny Storm and Ben Grimm accompanying him into space took place. When their ship {{passed through the}} Van Allen belt they found their cockpit bombarded with nearly lethal doses of cosmic radiation. Reed had neglected {{to account for the}} <b>abnormal</b> <b>radiation</b> levels in the belt's atmosphere. The cosmic rays wreaked havoc on the starship's insufficient shielding and they were forced to return to Earth immediately. When they crash-landed they found that their bodies were changed dramatically. Reed's body was elastic and he could reshape any portion of his body at will. At his suggestion, they decided to use their new abilities to serve mankind as the Fantastic Four. Reed was chosen to lead the group, under the name [...] "Mr. Fantastic". He later told his daughter, by way of a bedtime story, that the reason he suggested they become adventurers and gave them such outlandish costumes and names as [...] "Mister Fantastic" [...] and [...] "The Thing" [...] was that he knew they would likely be hated and feared for their powers without such an over-the-top public image.|$|E

Our results indicate that mitotic nondisjunction of lymphocyte chromosomes can also be induced by exposure to a low dose of <b>radiation.</b> <b>Abnormal</b> segregation can be induced not only when the cells are irradiated but also when nonirradiated cells are incubated with irradiated cell-free plasma or serum.

40|$|The microvasculature was {{investigated}} in the normal bowel (n = 43 patients) and in radiation bowel disease (n = 18 patients). Tissue samples obtained from postoperative colectomy specimens in which the intramural vessels had been perfused with barium sulphate suspension were examined. Microradiography was used to study vascular pattern which was <b>abnormal</b> in <b>radiation</b> bowel disease. A recently described radiograph fluorescence system was used to estimate barium concentration, and hence microvascular volume. The radiation group showed a highly significant reduction in barium concentration (p less than 0. 001), {{when compared with the}} normal group. This reduction was diffuse in samples from 15 patients who had received combined intracavity and external radiotherapy, but localised in two patients who had received intracavity treatment only. It is concluded that microvascular compromise {{is an important factor in}} the natural history of radiation bowel disease...|$|R
50|$|Following {{the events}} {{related to the}} Fukushima I nuclear {{accidents}} of 2011, Dobos composed a powerful musical tribute, titled Hymn to The Fukushima 50, to honor the Fukushima 50, {{the men and women}} making a great sacrifice by performing work in <b>abnormal</b> levels of <b>radiation</b> at the damaged reactors, to honor the survivors of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, and to support the relief efforts by inspiring donations. He achieved the latter by publishing a 5-minute video, which features the Hymn to The Fukushima 50 music, precisely edited together with the video (not unlike the way film scores work), and asking viewers to donate to the Japan relief efforts through their choice of charity organization. In exchange for donations, Dobos offered a free download of the Hymn to The Fukushima 50.|$|R
40|$|The {{radiation}} {{response of}} Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) -immortalised lymphoblastoid cell lines derive from Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) and LFS-like individuals was investigated. Cells from all LFS and LFS-like cases showed {{an accumulation of}} p 53 protein following 137 Cs gamma-irradiation, which was associated with cell cycle arrest at the G 1 /S border. This response was indistinguishable from that seen in cells derived from normal individuals, and occurred in cases with missense mutations in the TP 53 gene at codons 175, 180, 220 and 248 and also in two LFS-like individuals with no TP 53 mutation. Previous studies using lymphocytes and fibroblasts from LFS individuals have demonstrated <b>abnormal</b> <b>radiation</b> responses in these cells.

40|$|Nine rad (for <b>abnormal</b> <b>radiation</b> sensitivity) mutants hypersensitive to {{ultraviolet}} light were {{isolated in the}} small nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The mutations are recessive to their wild-type alleles, map to {{four of the six}} linkage groups in C. elegans and define nine new games named rad- 1 through rad- 9. Two of the mutants—rad- 1 and rad- 2 —are very hypersensitive to X rays, and three—rad- 2, rad- 3 and rad- 4 —are hypersensitive to methyl methanesulfonate under particular conditions of exposure. The hypersensitivity of these mutants to more than one DNA-damaging agent suggests that they may be abnormal in DNA repair. One mutant—rad- 5, a temperature-sensitive sterile mutant—shows an elevated frequency of spontaneous mutation at more than one locus; rad- 4, which shows a cold-sensitive embryogenesis, reduces meiotic X-chromosome nondisjunction tenfold and partially suppresses some but not all mutations that increase meiotic X-chromosome nondisjunction; the viability of rad- 6 hermaphrodites is half that of rad- 6 males at 25 °; and newly mature (but not older) rad- 8 hermaphrodites produce many inviable embryo progeny. Meiotic recombination frequencies were measured for seven rad mutants and found to be close to normal...|$|E
40|$|Since 1994, most of {{the major}} steel {{industries}} in Taiwan have installed portal monitor to detect the <b>abnormal</b> <b>radiation</b> in metal scrap feed. As a result, the discovery of NORM (Naturally Occurring Radioactive Material) has increased in recent years. In order to save the natural resources and promote radiation protection, an experimental melting process for the NORM contaminated steel scraps was carried out by the Institute of Nuclear Energy Research (INER) Taiwan, ROC. The experimental melting process has a pretreatment step that includes a series of cutting and removal of scales, sludge, as well as combustible and volatile materials on/in the steel scraps. After pretreatment the surface of the steel scraps are relatively clean. Then the scraps are melted by a pilot-type induction furnace. This experiment finally produced seven ingots with a total weight of 2, 849 kg and 96. 8 % recovery. All of the surface dose rates are of the background values. The activity concentrations of these ingots are also below the regulatory criteria. Thus, these NORM-bearing steel scraps are ready for recycling. This study has been granted by the regulatory authority...|$|E
40|$|The Front End Enclosure (FEE) of the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) is a {{shielding}} housing {{located between}} the electron dump {{area and the}} first experimental hutch. The upstream part of the FEE hosts the commissioning diagnostics for the FEL beam.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{retrospective}} study was to establish the presence and severity of cerebral visual impairment in preterm infants with PVL. We also wished to establish whether abnormalities of visual function are related to brain MRI findings and more specifically {{not only to the}} involvement of optic radiations and occipital cortex but also to changes in the thalami, that are often affected in infants with PVL. Twelve infants with cystic PVL were assessed at 1 year (+ 2) corrected age with a battery of tests specifically designed to assess various aspects of visual function in infancy, such as ocular movements, visual acuity, visual fields and fixation shift. All infants also had a brain MRI. Eleven of the 12 had involvement of the optic radiations: all had some abnormalities of visual function and visual impairment was more severe in infants with more extensive involvement of the optic radiations. The child with normal optic radiations had normal visual function. Six of the 12 infants also had obvious signs of atrophy of the thalami and all had severe and wide-ranging abnormalities of visual function in all testing domains. Two children had equivocal atrophy of the thalami, both had some abnormalities of visual function. Four children had normal thalami and had normal visual function or only minor abnormalities on one of the visual tests. Our results suggest that the atrophy of the thalami may play an additional role in the abnormal development of visual function in infants with PVL and <b>abnormal</b> optic <b>radiations...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{the history}} of {{earthquake}} thermal infrared research, it is undeniable that before and after strong earthquakes there are significant thermal infrared anomalies which have been interpreted as preseismic precursor in earthquake prediction and forecasting. In this paper, we studied the characteristics of thermal radiation observed {{before and after the}} 8 great earthquakes with magnitude up to Ms 7. 0 by using the satellite infrared remote sensing information. We used new types of data and method to extract the useful anomaly information. Based on the analyses of 8 earthquakes, we got the results as follows. (1) There are significant thermal radiation anomalies before and after earthquakes for all cases. The overall performance of anomalies includes two main stages: expanding first and narrowing later. We easily extracted and identified such seismic anomalies by method of “time-frequency relative power spectrum. ” (2) There exist evident and different characteristic periods and magnitudes of thermal <b>abnormal</b> <b>radiation</b> for each case.

40|$|Objective: To {{find out}} {{correlation}} between the 3 D ultrasound and conventional urethral catheterization in terms of measurement accuracy of post void residual urine (PVR) volume, pain score, and elapsed time among patients attending Urogynecology Clinic, Siriraj Hospital between December 2011 to December 2012. Methods: With {{the approval of the}} institution’s Ethics Committees, a total of 64 participants were enrolled. Participants with conditions that could affect bladder volume, including previous pelvic surgery and <b>radiation,</b> <b>abnormal</b> anatomy of genitourinary system, and contraindications for urethral catheterization were excluded. A questionnaire asking about demographic data and clinical presentation of each participant was completed. PVR volume was measured using the BladderScan® (BVI- 9400), followed by urethral catheterization. Differences between PVR volume and elapsed time in both procedures were determined. At the end of each procedure every participant was asked to rate the pain score, from 0 (no pain) to 10 (most severe pain), according to the Visual Analog Scale. Results: The mean age was 60 years old, ranging from 33 to 81. The mean body mass index (BMI) was 26. 5 kg/m 2 ± 4. 1. The PVR volume measured by the BladderScan® was significantly correlated with that measured by the conventional catheterization with the correlation coefficient of 0. 92 (p< 0. 001). The mean pain score in the BladderScan® group was obviously less when compared with that of the catheterization group (0. 59 ± 1. 19 vs 3. 00 ± 2. 07; p< 0. 001). The mean time used in the BladderScan® group was significantly lower than that in the catheterization group. Conclusion: The BladderScan® had high correlation, time saving and less pain compared to conventional urethral catheterization for measurement of the post-void residual urine volume...|$|R
