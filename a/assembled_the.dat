5|$|As {{tensions}} between the U.S. and Great Britain escalated {{in the wake of}} the June 22, 1807, Chesapeake–Leopard Affair, Scott applied to Governor Christopher Greenup to raise a mounted militia unit in anticipation of an outbreak of hostilities. Although Greenup granted the requested authorization, Scott remarried on July 25, 1807, and never <b>assembled</b> <b>the</b> militia unit. His second wife, Judith Cary (Bell) Gist, was the 57-year-old widow of Colonel Nathaniel Gist, who had been a prisoner of war with Scott during the Revolutionary War. After their marriage, they moved to Canewood, Gist's family's plantation in Bourbon and Clark counties.|$|E
5|$|Concerned {{about the}} succession, Henry sought to persuade Louis VI {{to accept his}} son, William Adelin, as the {{legitimate}} future Duke of Normandy, {{in exchange for his}} son's homage. Henry crossed into Normandy in 1115 and <b>assembled</b> <b>the</b> Norman barons to swear loyalty; he also almost successfully negotiated a settlement with King Louis, affirming William's right to the Duchy in exchange for a large sum of money, but the deal fell through and Louis, backed by his ally Baldwin of Flanders, instead declared that he considered William Clito the legitimate heir to the Duchy.|$|E
5|$|During the Silurian period (444–419 Ma) the {{continent}} of Laurentia gradually collided with Baltica, joining Scotland to the area that would become England and Europe. Sea levels rose as the Ordovician ice sheets melted, and tectonic movements created major faults which <b>assembled</b> <b>the</b> outline of Scotland from previously scattered fragments. These faults are the Highland Boundary Fault, separating the Lowlands from the Highlands, the Great Glen Fault that divides the North-west Highlands from the Grampians, the Southern Uplands Fault and the Iapetus Suture, which runs from the Solway Firth to Lindisfarne and which marks {{the close of the}} Iapetus Ocean and the joining of northern and southern Britain.|$|E
40|$|Foreign body {{aspiration}} {{in children}} is a life threatening event and prompt bronchoscopy and extraction is essential for their survival. During a recent paediatric airway emergency at Torbay hospital, Devon, the theatre staff were unable to <b>assemble</b> <b>the</b> paediatric bronchoscope. We therefore investigated methods to improve the efficiency and timeliness of the assembly of the paediatric bronchoscope. To assess the current problem we asked ten theatre staff at random to <b>assemble</b> <b>the</b> paediatric bronchoscope. 70 % of the staff {{were not able to}} <b>assemble</b> <b>the</b> paediatric bronchoscope. A prompt poster was developed as a visual aid to help demonstrate how to <b>assemble</b> <b>the</b> paediatric bronchoscope. Another ten theatre staff were asked to <b>assemble</b> <b>the</b> paediatric bronchoscope. Now all of the staff were able to <b>assemble</b> <b>the</b> paediatric bronchoscope. The prompt poster enabled all the theatre staff tested to correctly <b>assemble</b> <b>the</b> paediatric bronchoscope and the average time taken was reduced. To further develop the service mandatory training sessions have been arranged to help theatre staff remain confident and continue to develop their skills and knowledge.

5|$|Four Class 66 {{units were}} {{ordered by the}} Norwegian State Railways (NSB) in 1939, {{to be used as}} express trains on the then newly or shortly-to-be {{electrified}} Sørland- and Østfold Lines. At the same time, similar Class 88 diesel multiple units were ordered for the non-electrified Bergen- and Dovre Lines. The trains were built by Strømmens Værksted, Skabo Jernbanevognfabrikk and Norsk Elektrisk & Brown Boveri (NEBB). The diesel series was assembled by Strømmen, while Skabo <b>assembled</b> <b>the</b> electric version. NEBB delivered the motors for the units.|$|E
5|$|Girl Pat left Grimsby on 1 April 1936. According to Stone's later account, {{when they}} entered the open sea, Orsborne <b>assembled</b> <b>the</b> crew—except for Jefferson—in the {{wheelhouse}} {{and told them that}} this would not be a normal fishing trip. Instead, he proposed to take the boat south, first calling at Dover where he would get rid of Jefferson, who was not included in his further plans. At this stage Orsborne was apparently undecided as to his longer-term intentions, but indicated that they would be sailing into southern waters and might go fishing for pearls.|$|E
5|$|Judas {{was killed}} in 160BCE and succeeded by his brother Jonathan, who {{attempted}} to build a barrier {{to cut off the}} Acra's supply line. Jonathan had already <b>assembled</b> <b>the</b> manpower required for the task when he was forced to confront the invading army of Seleucid general Diodotus Tryphon at Beth Shan (Scythopolis). Having invited Jonathan to a friendly conference, Tryphon had him seized and murdered. Jonathan was succeeded by another brother, Simon, who besieged and finally captured the Acra in 141BCE.|$|E

5|$|On {{the second}} day of battle, most of both armies had <b>assembled.</b> <b>The</b> Union line was laid out in a {{defensive}} formation resembling a fishhook. In the late afternoon of July 2, Lee launched a heavy assault on the Union left flank, and fierce fighting raged at Little Round Top, the Wheatfield, Devil's Den, and the Peach Orchard. On the Union right, Confederate demonstrations escalated into full-scale assaults on Culp's Hill and Cemetery Hill. All across the battlefield, despite significant losses, the Union defenders held their lines.|$|E

Devastated, Lisa runs to her room crying, while Bart is sent to his room by his parents for causing the incident.|$|E
5|$|Plunging {{itself through}} an active process of Westernization during the Meiji Restoration in 1868, Japan adopted Western political, {{judicial}} and military institutions and Western cultural influences integrated with its traditional culture for modern industrialization. The Cabinet organized the Privy Council, introduced the Meiji Constitution, and <b>assembled</b> <b>the</b> Imperial Diet. The Meiji Restoration transformed the Empire of Japan into an industrialized world power that pursued military conflict {{to expand its}} sphere of influence. After victories in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895) and the Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905), Japan gained control of Taiwan, Korea and the southern half of Sakhalin. Japan's population grew from 35 million in 1873 to 70 million in 1935.|$|E

The three-piece band consisted of Reznor on guitars and lead vocals, Ron Musarra on drums, and Chris Vrenna on keyboards. The band was poorly received, however, and {{they were asked to}} leave the tour after 10 dates. After the Skinny Puppy tour the band was rearranged and expanded to include a fourth member; Musarra departed and Vrenna moved to drums, Gary Talpas, Nick Rushe, and later David Hymes contributed on keyboards, while Richard Patrick was added as guitarist.|$|E

Slide and Fitzhugh fight over Slide's gun; the gun goes off and the bullet hits the car, revealing gold underneath the Ferrari's paint. They realize that Shaw used his money to buy gold, turn it into car parts, and <b>assembled</b> <b>the</b> car to hide the money in plain sight.

Rajneesh's personal secretary and second-in-command, Ma Anand Sheela (Sheela Silverman), <b>assembled</b> <b>the</b> group after Turner was appointed to investigate illegal activity at Rajneeshpuram.

5|$|The French {{military}} strategy against Austria {{was for a}} three-pronged invasion to surround Vienna, ideally capturing the city and forcing the Holy Roman Emperor into a surrender and acceptance of French Revolutionary ideals. The French <b>assembled</b> <b>the</b> Army of Sambre and Meuse commanded by Jean Baptiste Jourdan against the Austrian Army of the Lower Rhine in the north; the Army of the Rhine and Moselle, led by Jean Victor Marie Moreau, opposed the Austrian Army of the Upper Rhine {{in the south and}} the Army of Italy commanded by Napoleon Bonaparte approached Vienna through northern Italy.|$|E
5|$|The early {{nuclear weapons}} were large, complex and cumbersome. They were stored as {{components}} rather than complete devices and required expert knowledge to assemble. The short {{life of their}} lead-acid batteries and modulated neutron initiators, and the heat generated by the fissile cores, precluded storing them <b>assembled.</b> <b>The</b> large quantity of conventional explosive in each weapon demanded special care be taken in handling. Groves hand-picked a team of regular Army officers, who were trained in the assembly and handling of the weapons. They in turn trained the enlisted soldiers, and the Army teams then trained teams from the Navy and Air Force.|$|E
