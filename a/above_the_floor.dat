5|$|Josephson {{said that}} Trinity College's long {{interest}} in the paranormal meant {{that he did not}} dismiss these ideas out of hand. Several presidents of the Society for Psychical Research had been fellows of Trinity, and the Perrott-Warrick Fund, set up in Trinity in 1937 to fund parapsychology research, is still administered by the college. He continued to explore {{the idea that there is}} intelligence in nature, particularly after reading Fritjof Capra's The Tao of Physics (1975), and in 1979 took up a more advanced form of TM, known as the TM-Sidhi program. According to Anderson, the TM movement produced a poster showing Josephson levitating several inches <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> Josephson argued that meditation could lead to mystical and scientific insights, and that, as a result of it, he had come to believe in a creator.|$|E
5|$|Scientist Hector Hammond is {{summoned by}} his father, Senator Robert Hammond, {{to a secret}} {{government}} facility to perform an autopsy on Abin Sur's body {{under the watchful eye}} of Amanda Waller. A piece of Parallax inside the corpse enters Hammond, giving him telepathic and telekinetic powers at the cost of his sanity. After discovering that he was chosen for the secret work only due to his father's influence, Hammond attempts to kill his father by telekinetically sabotaging his helicopter at a party. Jordan saves the senator and the party guests, including his childhood sweetheart Carol Ferris. Back at the government facility, Hammond uses telekenisis to successfully kill his father by burning him alive. Hammond also elevates Waller high <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> As she's falling, Jordan arrives and saves the injured Waller by creating a pool of water which whisks her away out of further danger. During the encounter Jordan learns of Parallax coming to Earth.|$|E

5|$|Station 2 was {{constructed}} in the 1920s and considered significant as a rare surviving example of early 20th-century industrial architecture. It was designed in an industrial Beaux-Arts style, with large arched windows and stringcourse intended {{to prevent it from}} becoming an eyesore given its proximity to affluent communities. It {{was constructed}} with Flemish bond brickwork and decorative limestone elements. It was also constructed to minimize noise and ash pollution. Buildings with such architectural detail were usually found in urban areas, making the Glenwood plant unusual for being far from urban areas {{at the time of its}} construction. The building was divided into three sections: a narrow four-story administration section to the north containing offices; a five-story turbine room containing a large open space with decorated glazed buff brick walls; and a six-story boiler house mainly filled with equipment, topped by six 140-foot smoke stacks (ultimately reaching 265 feet <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> slab). At the time of its demolition the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation determined that it appeared to meet the criteria for listing on the National Register of Historic Places, triggering an alternative use analysis. Given the building's poor condition after three decades of disuse, the excessive cost of making the building structurally sound prevented any plans to retain or renovate it.|$|E

25|$|In the hangline approach, wood items being {{finished}} are hung by carriers or hangers {{that are}} attached to a conveyor system that moves the items overhead or <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> space.

A simple overhead conveyor system can be designed to move wood products through several wood finishing processes in a continuous loop. The hangline approach to automated wood finishing also allows the option of moving items up to warmer air at the ceiling level to speed up drying process.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} main rivers in the Sierra Gorda, {{all of which}} are part of the Pánuco River basin. These are the Santa María River, the Extoraz or Peñamiller River and the Moctezuma River.

Santa María marks part of the border between Querétaro and San Luis Potosí, and the Moctezuma River marks part of the border between Querétaro and Hidalgo. The Tula and Moctezuma Rivers meet in the Sierra Gorda of Hidalgo. Here, the Moctezuma River Canyon extends for twelve km and rises 480 meters <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|E
25|$|Lanier's campus {{has been}} {{expanded}} numerous times {{since it was}} first built. The most notable expansion was {{the addition of the}} area of the building housing the cafeteria and gymnasium. This expansion has resulted in some quirks in the building that are still visible today, most notably a door leading to stairs to the basement that is only half-exposed <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> of the hallway. These stairs are no longer in service, though the door can be opened even though it's blocked by the hallway floor. Students aren't allowed to open the door and/or go down those stairs. Prior to this expansion, the cafeteria was located where the library is today, on the third floor. A dumbwaiter, located where the elevator is today, carried food to the cafeteria.|$|E

25|$|The {{passenger}} train was the 16:45 from Cleethorpes to Manchester {{consisting of a}} brake van, three passenger carriages and a rear guard's van. The goods train which had left Grimsby {{earlier in the day}} for Doncaster consisted of 44 waggons loaded with larch tree trunks, three trunks to a load secured with chains. The length of the trunks (up to 42ft) necessitated the close coupling of the waggons. The goods train was being shunted on a curve at low speed adjacent to the main line when 5 trucks derailed just as the {{passenger train}} approached. One truck toppled over; its load of timber projecting over the main line. The brake van 'was carried away {{with the exception of the}} offside and roof'. The next two carriages were 'clean swept away' <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> level; the first compartment of the third passenger carriage was also destroyed.|$|E
25|$|Starting in late 1932 Kristiansand Municipality {{asked that}} the airport be {{moved out of the}} city center. They {{proposed}} Kongsgårdsbukta in Topdalsfjorden, a site which would from 1934 host the civilian Kristiansand Airport, Kongsgårdbukta. The Naval Air Service agreed, but of different reasons. At high tide and onshore wind the water level could be half a meter <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> level in the first hangar. The military proposed moving the station to Bragdøya. Meanwhile, Kristiansand Airport, Kjevik was being planned and opened in 1939. By then the Naval Air Service proposed that a new station would be built at Andøya and planning of this started. However, the Ministry of Defense instead wanted the air station situated at Kjevik. Nothing came of either plan until the German occupation in 1940. Luftwaffe opted to build a water aerodrome at Kjevik and closed the naval air station.|$|E
25|$|On 19 January 2012 the {{interior}} of the primary containment vessel of reactor 2 was inspected with an industrial endoscope. This device, 8.5 millimeters in diameter, is equipped with a 360 degrees-view camera and a thermometer to measure the temperature at this spot and the cooling-water inside, in an attempt to calibrate the existing temperature-measurements that could have an error-margin of 20 degrees. The device was brought in by a hole at 2.5 meter <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> where the vessel is located. The whole procedure lasted 70 minutes. The photos showed parts of the walls and pipes inside the containment vessel. But they were unclear and blurred, most likely due to water vapors and the radiation inside. According to TEPCO the photos showed no serious damage. The temperature measured inside was 44.7 degrees Celsius, and did not differ much from the 42.6 degrees measured outside the vessel.|$|E

25|$|The current museum {{building}} reopened to {{the public}} on October 21, 2001. The 2001 expansion, which increased the museum’s available space by 50,000 square feet, rests on the same footprint as the earlier additions. It is clad in dark Arabian granite so as to recede visually from the light-colored shellstone of the 1961 building. The expansion’s most arresting feature is a centrally located atrium, rising fifty-five feet <b>above</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> and topped by a curved roof with side windows, {{referred to as the}} Lantern. The atrium’s interior walls are clad in the signature shellstone. A double stairway gives access from the atrium to a complex of second-floor galleries where selections from the museum’s permanent collection, along with special exhibitions, are on display. In this new alignment, most of the galleries in the 1961 building, including the mezzanine area where the library and offices were once located, are used for rotating exhibitions of paintings and sculpture by Remington and Russell from Amon G. Carter’s original collection.|$|E
