5|$|The first semi-permanent {{inhabitants}} of regions near Antarctica (areas situated {{south of the}} <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Convergence)</b> were British and American sealers who used to spend {{a year or more}} on South Georgia, from 1786 onward. During the whaling era, which lasted until 1966, the population of that island varied from over 1,000 in the summer (over 2,000 in some years) to some 200 in the winter. Most of the whalers were Norwegian, with an increasing proportion of Britons. The settlements included Grytviken, Leith Harbour, King Edward Point, Stromness, Husvik, Prince Olav Harbour, Ocean Harbour and Godthul. Managers and other senior officers of the whaling stations often lived together with their families. Among them was the founder of Grytviken, Captain Carl Anton Larsen, a prominent Norwegian whaler and explorer who, along with his family, adopted British citizenship in 1910.|$|E
5|$|The {{porbeagle}} has {{an almost}} global amphitemperate distribution, i.e. it is {{absent from the}} tropics; in the North Pacific, its niche is assumed by the salmon shark. It is found mostly within 30–70°N and 30–50°S latitudes. In the North Atlantic, the northern limit of its range extends from the Newfoundland Grand Banks off Canada, through southern Greenland, to Scandinavia and Russia; the southern limit of its range extends from New Jersey and Bermuda, through the Azores and Madeira, to Morocco. It {{is found in the}} Mediterranean Sea, but not the Black Sea. Normally, North Atlantic sharks only stray as far south as South Carolina and the Gulf of Guinea, but pregnant females from the western North Atlantic population are known to range into the Sargasso Sea, almost as far as Hispaniola, to give birth. In the Southern Hemisphere, the porbeagle apparently occupies a continuous band bound in the south by the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Convergence,</b> and extending as far north as Chile and Brazil, the Western Cape province of South Africa, Australia to southern Western Australia and southern Queensland, and New Zealand. It is speculated that the porbeagle colonized the Southern Hemisphere during the Quaternary glaciation (beginning c. 2.6 Ma), when the tropical climate zone was much narrower than it is today.|$|E
5|$|In the 15th century, West European mariners—beginning with Portugal—started making still longer voyages of exploration, using {{improvements}} on translated Islamic star {{charts and}} {{a variation on}} African fishing boats called the caravel. In 1473, Lopes Gonçalves crossed the equator and disproved the Aristotelian notion that a ring of fire would bar exploration of the southern hemisphere. Bartolomeu Dias rounded the Cape of Good Hope in 1487; in 1498, Vasco da Gama reached Malindi, where a local pilot showed him how to follow the monsoon to India. In 1492, relying on incorrect estimates of the circumference of the Earth, the Genovese Christopher Columbus sailed from Cadiz to the Canaries and thence into the open Atlantic in a Spanish attempt to reach the Orient. Instead, he made landfall on {{an island in the}} Caribbean Sea. The resulting Columbian Exchange introduced potatoes, corn, and chili peppers to the Old World while smallpox epidemics devastated the indigenous peoples of the Americas. This disruption and depopulation permitted rapid Spanish conquests and led to the widespread adoption of African slavery to man lucrative tobacco, sugar, indigo, and cotton plantations. In 1519, Juan Sebastián Elcano completed Magellan's Spanish expedition to sail around the world. These and other voyages permitted European maps to attain a previously impossible degree of accuracy. In 1538, Gerardus Mercator devised a map projection conveniently making constant bearings (rhumb lines) straight. In the Arctic, in 1594, the Dutch captain Willem Barentsz reached Svalbard and the Barents Sea while, in the south, Anthony de la Roché crossed the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Convergence</b> in 1675 and three separate expeditions—one British, one American, and one Russian—all claimed to have discovered Antarctica in 1820. Not all voyages of discovery originated in Western Europe. Although accurate charting of the coasts of Russia only began in the 18th century and the archipelago of Severnaya Zemlya was not discovered until 1910, Novgorodians had been sailing the White Sea since at least the 13th century. Despite a long-standing preference for autarky, China briefly opened up under the Song and Mongol Yuan dynasties. In the early 15th century, Zheng He's fleet of treasure ships repeatedly sailed from Ming China with 37,000 men aboard 317 ships, reaching as far as the African coast. Chinese exploration, however, was soon curtailed again and finally outlawed. The peoples of East Asia were introduced to the true shape of the other continents from the maps of Matteo Ricci.|$|E
40|$|Based on {{the data}} {{obtained}} by the UMITAKA-MARU (Tokyo Univ. of Fisheries, 1453) during the period from Dec. 1961 to Feb. 1962, the general oceanographic conditions are discussed in this paper. During this expedition the temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, PH, Phosphate-P and Silicate-Si are investigated at all stations. As a result the followings are summarized; (1) along the oceanographic sections off Australia and Africa the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Convergences</b> are clearly distinguished, (2) in the Indian Antarctic waters the south-going warm deep water affects to the higher latitudes zone than in the Atlantic region, (3) in the Weddell cold water region where the northerly and southerly oceanographic sections are investigated the upwelling of Warm Deep Water is critically observed, (4) by the chart of dynamical topography the meandering of west-wind drift current around the Weddell cold water region is estimated...|$|R
40|$|Diatom populations {{from the}} <b>Antarctic</b> Polar Front (<b>convergence)</b> in the Drake Passage area {{exhibited}} relatively high photosynthesis: chlorophyll a ratios at light saturation. The permanent water column instability and the adverse meteorological conditions {{observed in the}} central Drake Passage area seem to product a light-color stress on the physiology of convergence diatoms that are restricted to a blue-green light environment during their life cycle. The enhanced photosynthesis: chlorophyll a ratios that were determined in experiments with Antarctic Polar Front diatoms when exposed to white (fluorescent) light sources, may bc related to the short-wavelength light background of these diatoms...|$|R
50|$|While Electrona risso can {{be found}} {{throughout}} the world, widespread in the Indian, Pacific, Atlantic Oceans, and Mediterranean, the other four species are limited to the southern hemisphere, mostly limited to the Southern Ocean. Their dispersion {{is dependent on the}} balance between current-mediated larval dispersal and adult active homing behavior. Besides E. rissoi is E. paucirastra the only species that is found north of the Southern Ocean.E. antarctica mainly inhabits the Antarctic deep and therefore warmer waters. E. carlsbergii inhabits the water south of the Antarctica <b>convergence</b> to the <b>Antarctic</b> coast, and between the <b>Antarctic</b> and sub-Antarctic <b>convergences.</b> Larval forms of many deep-water species are found to inhabit inshore waters. Migration patterns vary between different species, size groups, life history stages, sex, latitude, time and season.|$|R
25|$|The <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Convergence</b> is {{considered}} to be the best natural definition of the northern extent of the Southern Ocean.|$|E
25|$|The South Atlantic {{island of}} South Georgia, {{situated}} {{south of the}} <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Convergence,</b> was the first Antarctic territory to be discovered.|$|E
25|$|Some Falkland Islanders {{were even}} born beyond the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Convergence,</b> most {{recently}} in the 1980s in the territory of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands.|$|E
25|$|At between 52° – 57° {{south of}} the equator, Campbell Island group, Heard Island and McDonald Islands, Bouvet Island, South Georgia Group, Macquarie Island, and South Sandwich Islands are also located in the Furious Fifties. The {{geography}} of these islands is characterized by tundra, permafrost, and volcanoes. These islands are situated close to or {{south of the}} <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Convergence,</b> but north of 60°S latitude (the continental limit according to the Antarctic Treaty). Therefore, although some are located south of the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Convergence,</b> they should still be considered as subantarctic islands {{by virtue of their}} location north of the 60° latitude.|$|E
25|$|The Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources {{applies to}} the area south of 60° South {{latitude}} {{as well as the}} areas further north up to the limit of the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Convergence.</b>|$|E
25|$|Tristan da Cunha group, Île Amsterdam, Île Saint-Paul, and Gough Island are all {{isolated}} volcanic islands {{situated at}} between 37° - 40° {{south of the}} equator, {{just south of the}} southern Horse latitudes. Because they are located far {{to the north of the}} <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Convergence</b> and have a relatively temperate climate, they are not typically considered to be subantarctic islands.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the harsh}} {{conditions}} the islands do support vegetation and {{are part of}} the Scotia Sea Islands tundra ecoregion, along with South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, the South Orkney Islands and Bouvet Island. All these islands lie in the cold seas below the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Convergence.</b> These areas support tundra vegetation consisting of mosses, lichens and algae, while seabirds, penguins and seals feed in the surrounding waters.|$|E
25|$|South Georgia's {{coast and}} waters have been {{surveyed}} {{by a number}} of expeditions since those of Cook and Bellingshausen. In particular, the extensive oceanographic investigations carried out by the Discovery Committee from 1925 to 1951 yielded an enormous amount of scientific results and data, including the discovery of the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Convergence.</b> The first land-based scientific expedition on South Georgia was the 1882–83 German Polar Year expedition at Moltke Harbour, Royal Bay.|$|E
25|$|Managers {{and other}} senior {{officers}} of the whaling stations often had their families living together with them. Among them was Fridthjof Jacobsen whose wife Klara Olette Jacobsen gave birth to two of their children in Grytviken; their daughter Solveig Gunbjørg Jacobsen was the first child ever born south of the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Convergence,</b> on 8 October 1913. Several more children have been born on South Georgia: recently even aboard visiting private yachts.|$|E
25|$|Associated {{with the}} Circumpolar Current is the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Convergence</b> {{encircling}} Antarctica, where cold northward-flowing Antarctic waters meet the relatively warmer {{waters of the}} subantarctic, Antarctic waters predominantly sink beneath subantarctic waters, while associated zones of mixing and upwelling create a zone very high in nutrients. These nurture high levels of phytoplankton with associated copepods and Antarctic krill, and resultant foodchains supporting fish, whales, seals, penguins, albatrosses and a wealth of other species.|$|E
25|$|At between about 46° – 50° {{south of}} the equator, in the region often {{referred}} to as the Roaring Forties, are the Crozet Islands, Prince Edward Islands, Bounty Islands, Snares Islands, Kerguelen Islands, Antipodes Islands, and Auckland Islands. The geography of these islands is characterized by tundra, with some trees on Snares and Auckland Islands. These islands are all located near the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Convergence</b> (with Kerguelen {{south of the}} Convergence) and are properly considered to be subantarctic islands.|$|E
25|$|The Subantarctic is {{a region}} in the {{southern}} hemisphere, located immediately north of the Antarctic region. This translates roughly to a latitude of between 46° – 60° south of the Equator. The subantarctic region includes many islands in the southern parts of the Indian Ocean, Atlantic Ocean and Pacific Ocean, especially those situated north of the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Convergence.</b> Subantarctic glaciers are, by definition, located on islands within the subantarctic region. All glaciers located on the continent of Antarctica are by definition considered to be Antarctic glaciers.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} rapidly {{changing}} physical settings in the subantarctic has been produced on Heard Island {{by a combination of}} rapid glacial recession and climate warming. The consequent increase in habitat available for plant colonisation, plus the coalescing of previously discrete ice-free areas, has led to marked changes in the vegetation of Heard Island in the last 20 years or so. Other species and vegetation communities found on subantarctic islands north of the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Convergence</b> now absent from the Heard Island flora may colonise the island if climate change produces more favourable conditions.|$|E
25|$|As a {{postdoctoral}} researcher at Florida State University, US (1971–1973), Truswell {{participated in the}} first Deep Sea Drilling Program (DSDP) voyages to Antarctica, which still holds {{the record for the}} furthest south of such drilling. This voyage contributed to a new understanding of the age of the Antarctic ice sheet and the development of an early version of the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Convergence.</b> Subsequent work on Ocean Drilling Program material led her, along with M.K. Macphail, to decipher an unparalleled pollen record from Prydz Bay, revealing the composition of terrestrial plant communities during the earliest stages of ice-cap formation during the Late Eocene preglacial-glacial transition.|$|E
25|$|The subantarctic region {{comprises}} two geographic {{zones and}} three distinct fronts. The northernmost {{boundary of the}} subantarctic region is the rather ill-defined Subtropical Front (STF), {{also referred to as}} the Subtropical Convergence. To the south of the STF is a geographic zone, the Subantarctic Zone (SAZ). South of the SAZ is the Subantarctic Front (SAF). South of the SAF is another marine zone, called the Polar Frontal Zone (PFZ). The SAZ and the PFZ together form the subantarctic region. The southernmost boundary of the PFZ (and hence, the southern border of the subantarctic region) is the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Convergence,</b> located approximately 200 kilometers south of the Antarctic Polar Front (APF).|$|E
25|$|At between 51° – 56° {{south of}} the equator, the Falkland Islands, Isla de los Estados, Ildefonso Islands, Diego Ramírez Islands, and other islands {{associated}} with Tierra del Fuego and Cape Horn, lie north of the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Convergence</b> in the region {{often referred to as}} the Furious Fifties. Unlike other subantarctic islands, these islands have trees, temperate grasslands (mostly tussac grass), and even arable land. They also lack tundra and permanent snow and ice at their lowest elevations. Despite their more southerly location, it is debatable whether these islands should be considered as such because their climate and geography differs significantly from other subantarctic islands.|$|E
25|$|By {{way of his}} voyages in the 1770s, Captain James Cook {{proved that}} waters {{encompassed}} the southern latitudes of the globe. Since then, geographers have disagreed on the Southern Ocean's northern boundary or even existence, considering the waters as {{various parts of the}} Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans, instead. However, according to Commodore John Leech of the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO), recent oceanographic research has discovered the importance of Southern Circulation, and the term Southern Ocean has been used to define the body of water which lies south of the northern limit of that circulation. This remains the current official policy of the IHO, since a 2000 revision of its definitions including the Southern Ocean as the waters south of the 60th parallel has not yet been adopted. Others regard the seasonally-fluctuating <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Convergence</b> as the natural boundary.|$|E
25|$|On 7 April 1982, the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CAMLR Convention) {{came into}} force after discussions began in 1975 between {{parties of the}} then-current Antarctic Treaty to limit {{large-scale}} exploitation of krill by commercial fisheries. The Convention bound contracting nations to abide by previously agreed upon Antarctic territorial claims and peaceful use of the region while protecting ecosystem integrity south of the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Convergence</b> and 60 S latitude. In so doing, it also established a commission of the original signatories and acceding parties called the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) to advance these aims through protection, scientific study, and rational use, such as harvesting, of those marine resources. Though separate, the Antarctic Treaty and CCAMLR, make up part the broader system of international agreements called the Antarctic Treaty System. Since 1982, the CCAMLR meets annually to implement binding conservations measures like the creation of 'protected areas' {{at the suggestion of}} the convention's scientific committee.|$|E
2500|$|Antarctic krill has a {{circumpolar}} distribution, {{being found}} throughout the Southern Ocean, and {{as far north as}} the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Convergence.</b> At the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Convergence,</b> the cold Antarctic surface water submerges below the warmer subantarctic waters. This front runs roughly at 55° south; from there to the continent, the Southern Ocean covers 32 million square kilometres. This is 65 {{times the size of the}} North Sea.

2500|$|Several {{distinct}} water masses converge in {{the immediate}} vicinity of the APF or <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Convergence</b> (in particular the Subantarctic Surface Water (Subantarctic Mode Water or SAMW), Antarctic Surface Water, and the Antarctic Intermediate Water). This convergence creates a unique environment, noted for its very high marine productivity, especially for Antarctic krill. Because of this, all lands and waters situated south of the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Convergence</b> are considered to belong to the Antarctic from a climatological, biological and hydrological standpoint. However, the text of the Antarctic Treaty, article VI ("Area covered by Treaty") states: [...] "The provisions of the present Treaty shall apply to the area south of 60° South latitude". Therefore, Antarctica is defined from a political standpoint as all land and ice shelves south of 60°S latitude.|$|E
2500|$|Sir Edmund Halley {{surveyed}} {{the vicinity of}} South Georgia in January 1700 {{in the course of}} his work of charting magnetic declinations in the South Atlantic. His HMS Paramore (or Paramour) penetrated the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Convergence</b> to reach some 90nmi (170km) north of South Georgia, where he mistook few tabular icebergs for islands (as possibly did Vespucci before him).|$|E

2500|$|The {{first days}} of the voyage mainly {{involved}} the crossing of twenty degrees and a westerly current; on board there were further misfortunes, including the loss of a man. Crossing the 50°S parallel, they experienced unexpected falls in the air and water temperatures.

[...] On 20 January the expedition crossed the Antarctic Circle, with celebrations similar to crossing of the Equator ceremonies, and they sighted land the same afternoon.|$|E
2500|$|Bouvetøya is a {{volcanic}} island constituting {{the top of}} a volcano located {{at the southern end of}} the Mid-Atlantic Ridge in the South Atlantic Ocean. The island measures [...] and covers an area of , including a number of small rocks and skerries and one sizable island, Larsøya. It is located in the Subantarctic, south of the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Convergence,</b> which, by some definitions, would place the island in the Southern Ocean. Bouvet Island is the most remote island in the world. The closest land is Queen Maud Land of Antarctica, which is [...] to the south, and Gough Island, [...] to the north. The closest inhabited location is Tristan da Cunha island, [...] to the northwest.|$|E
2500|$|Despite this, the 4th edition {{definition}} has partial {{de facto}} usage by many nations, scientists and {{organisations such as}} the U.S. (the Central Intelligence Agency World Factbook uses [...] "Southern Ocean" [...] {{but none of the}} other new sea names within the [...] "Southern Ocean" [...] such as [...] "Cosmonauts Sea") and Merriam-Webster, scientists and nations – and even by some within the IHO. Some nations' hydrographic offices have defined their own boundaries; the United Kingdom used the 55°S parallel for example. Other organisations favour more northerly limits for the Southern Ocean. For example, the Encyclopædia Britannica describes the Southern Ocean as extending as far north as South America, and confers great significance on the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>Convergence,</b> yet its description of the Indian Ocean contradicts this, describing the Indian Ocean as extending south to Antarctica.|$|E
