5|$|Other tablets <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{cut with}} a steel blade, often rather crudely. Although steel knives were {{available}} after {{the arrival of the}} Spanish, this does cast suspicion on the authenticity of these tablets.|$|E

5|$|Casualty {{figures were}} {{extremely}} variable, but British casualties (killed, wounded, or captured) <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{in the low}} 30s according to press accounts (contrary to Dickinson's claim of 49 prisoners taken), while militia casualties were relatively small in number.|$|E
5|$|During evolution, darts <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> lost secondarily, i.e., {{after they}} had evolved and been functional. Vestigial darts (ones that exist only in a {{rudimentary}} condition) occur in the family Sagdidae, and in many Helicoidea, the surrounding organs have also degenerated (become non-functional). The sarcobelum is a fleshy or cuticle-coated papilla which {{is considered to be}} a degenerated, previously dart-bearing, organ.|$|E

5|$|In northwestern Iowa, Great Oasis {{underwent}} {{dramatic changes}} as Mill Creek sites appeared. While Mill Creek has many stylistic similarities with Great Oasis and some Mill Creek sites contain Great Oasis ceramic forms, Mill Creek sites are substantially different. Mill Creek sites became nucleated, often fortified, {{had a much}} higher dependence on maize and bison hunting, show substantial evidence of long-distance trade, and <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> occupied year-round. The Phipps and Chan-Ya-Ta sites are classic examples. Glenwood culture sites in southwest Iowa near the Missouri River appear to be unrelated to the earlier Great Oasis sites, and are notable for their large earthlodge sites. Glenwood sites <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> more oriented in lifeways and trade with the Central Plains Tradition cultures to the west than with the Mississippian cultures to the southeast. Around 1300 AD Mill Creek and Glenwood sites in Iowa disappeared, replaced by the rapidly spreading Oneota cultures.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo's notes <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{intended}} for publication {{because many of}} the sheets have a form and order that would facilitate this.

Why they were not published during Leonardo's lifetime is unknown.|$|E

5|$|On September 6, E. coli was {{detected}} in the water supply. According to the CDC, five people died from bacterial infections caused by the toxic waters. The deaths <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> caused by Vibrio vulnificus bacteria, of the Cholera family.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} ceratopsians, {{especially}} Centrosaurus and its relatives, <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> gregarious, living in herds.

5|$|The {{commissioning}} aside, Delaroche {{was inspired}} to create Bonaparte Crossing the Alps because {{he felt that he}} both looked like Napoleon, and that his achievements were comparable to Napoleon's. It is likely that Delaroche's painting is relatively historically accurate; details such as Napoleon's clothes <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> researched by Delaroche in an effort at authenticity.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} chairs started In ancient Egypt chairs <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> of great {{richness}} and splendour.

5|$|Though {{traditionally}} {{depicted as}} ungainly and awkward when on the ground, {{the anatomy of}} some pterosaurs (particularly pterodactyloids) suggests that they were competent walkers and runners.

5|$|Across the battlefield, as {{the first}} line of Persian ships was pushed back by the Greeks, they became fouled in the {{advancing}} second and third lines of their own ships. On the Greek left, the Persian admiral Ariabignes (a brother of Xerxes) was killed early in the battle; left disorganised and leaderless, the Phoenician squadrons <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> pushed back against the coast, many vessels running aground. In the centre, a wedge of Greek ships pushed through the Persians lines, splitting the fleet in two.|$|E
5|$|Amanita phalloides {{has been}} {{conveyed}} to new countries across the Southern Hemisphere with {{the importation of}} hardwoods and conifers.
