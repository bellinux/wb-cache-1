25|$|A multi-lane racer is a ride where between 4 and 8 riders dive head-first onto a mat {{and down}} a slide with several dips. As an <b>{{additional}}</b> <b>component</b> of this ride, both some offer an additional enclosed helix {{at the top of}} the ride. ProSlide offer ProRacers, Octopus Racers and Kraken Racers, while WhiteWater West have designed the Mat Racers and Whizzards.

500|$|On January 5, 2000, Mihdhar {{traveled}} to Kuala Lumpur, where he joined Hazmi, Attash and Yemeni, {{who were all}} arriving from Pakistan. [...] Hamburg cell member Ramzi bin al-Shibh was also at the summit, and Mohammed possibly attended. The group was in Malaysia to meet with Hambali, the leader of Jemaah Islamiyah, an Asian al-Qaeda affiliate. [...] During the Kuala Lumpur al-Qaeda Summit, many key details of the 9/11 attacks may have been arranged. At the time, the attacks plot had an <b>additional</b> <b>component</b> involving hijacking aircraft in Asia, {{as well as in}} the United States. [...] Attash and Yemeni were slated for this part of the plot, however, it was later canceled by Bin Laden for being too difficult to coordinate with United States operations.|$|E
500|$|While {{the above}} model of E-LTP {{describes}} entirely postsynaptic mechanisms for induction, maintenance, and expression, an <b>additional</b> <b>component</b> of expression may occur presynaptically. One hypothesis of this presynaptic facilitation is that persistent CaMKII {{activity in the}} postsynaptic cell during E-LTP {{may lead to the}} synthesis of a [...] "retrograde messenger", discussed later. According to this hypothesis, the newly synthesized messenger travels across the synaptic cleft from the postsynaptic to the presynaptic cell, leading to a chain of events that facilitate the presynaptic response to subsequent stimuli. Such events may include an increase in neurotransmitter vesicle number, probability of vesicle release, or both. In addition to the retrograde messenger underlying presynaptic expression in early LTP, the retrograde messenger may also {{play a role in the}} expression of late LTP.|$|E

2500|$|During and {{immediately}} after World War II a phenomenon named [...] "the tyranny of numbers" [...] was noticed, that is, some computational devices reached a level of complexity at which the losses from failures and downtime exceeded the expected benefits. Each Boeing B-29 (put into service in 1944) carried 300–1000 vacuum tubes {{and tens of thousands}} of passive components. The number of vacuum tubes reached thousands in advanced computers and more than 17,000 in the ENIAC (1946). Each <b>additional</b> <b>component</b> reduced the reliability of a device and lengthened the troubleshooting time. Traditional electronics reached a deadlock and a further development of electronic devices required reducing the number of their components.|$|E

2500|$|An {{afterburner}} (or reheat) is an <b>additional</b> <b>component</b> {{added to}} some jet engines, primarily those on military supersonic aircraft. Its {{purpose is to}} provide a temporary increase in thrust, both for supersonic flight and for takeoff (as the high wing loading typical of supersonic aircraft designs means that take-off speed is very high). [...] On military aircraft the extra thrust is also useful for combat situations. [...] This is achieved by injecting additional fuel into the jet pipe downstream of (i.e. after) the turbine and combusting it. [...] The advantage of afterburning is significantly increased thrust; the disadvantage is its very high fuel consumption and inefficiency, though this is often regarded as acceptable for the short periods during which it is usually used.|$|E
2500|$|In addition, an {{emergency}} application brings in an <b>additional</b> <b>component</b> of each car's air brake system: the emergency portion. The triple valve {{is divided into}} two portions: the service portion, which contains the mechanism used during brake applications made during service reductions, and the emergency portion, which senses the immediate, rapid release of train line pressure. In addition, each car's air brake reservoir {{is divided into two}} portions—the service portion and the emergency portion—and is known as the [...] "dual-compartment reservoir”. Normal service applications transfer air pressure from the service portion to the brake cylinder, while emergency applications cause the triple valve to direct all air in both the service portion and the emergency portion of the dual-compartment reservoir to the brake cylinder, resulting in a 20–30% stronger application.|$|E
2500|$|Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard was {{released}} on August 28, 2009. Rather than delivering big changes to the appearance and end user functionality like the previous releases of , Snow Leopard focused on [...] "under the hood" [...] changes, increasing the performance, efficiency, and stability of the operating system. For most users, the most noticeable changes were: the disk space that the operating system frees up after a clean install compared to Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard, a more responsive Finder rewritten in Cocoa, faster Time Machine backups, more reliable and user friendly disk ejects, a more powerful version of the Preview application, {{as well as a}} faster Safari web browser. [...] Snow Leopard only supported machines with Intel CPUs, required at least 1GB of RAM, and dropped default support for applications built for the PowerPC architecture (Rosetta could be installed as an <b>additional</b> <b>component</b> to retain support for PowerPC-only applications).|$|E

2500|$|Scheele {{made one}} other very {{important}} scientific discovery in 1774, arguably more revolutionary than his isolation of oxygen. [...] He identified lime, silica, and iron in a specimen of pyrolusite (impure manganese dioxide) {{given to him}} by his friend, Johann Gottlieb Gahn, but could not identify an <b>additional</b> <b>component</b> (this was the manganese, which Scheele recognized was present as a new element, but could not isolate). When he treated the pyrolusite with hydrochloric acid over a warm sand bath, a yellow-green gas with a strong odor was produced. [...] He found that the gas sank to the bottom of an open bottle and was denser than ordinary air. He also noted that the gas was not soluble in water. It turned corks a yellow color and removed all color from wet, blue litmus paper and some flowers. He called this gas with bleaching abilities, [...] "dephlogisticated muriatic acid" [...] (dephlogisticated hydrochloric acid, or oxidized hydrochloric acid). Eventually, Sir Humphry Davy named the gas chlorine.|$|E
