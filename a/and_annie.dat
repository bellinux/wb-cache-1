5|$|Knight {{presented}} an elaborate conspiracy theory involving the British royal family, freemasonry and the painter Walter Sickert. He {{concluded that the}} victims were murdered to cover up a secret marriage between the second-in-line to the throne, Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale, <b>and</b> <b>Annie</b> Elizabeth Crook, a working class girl.

5|$|In contrast, British {{alternative}} {{rock was}} distinguished {{from that of}} the United States early on by a more pop-oriented focus (marked by an equal emphasis on albums and singles, as well as greater openness to incorporating elements of dance and club culture) and a lyrical emphasis on specifically British concerns. As a result, few British alternative bands have achieved commercial success in the US. Since the 1980s alternative rock has been played extensively on the radio in the UK, particularly by disc jockeys such as John Peel (who championed alternative music on BBC Radio 1), Richard Skinner, <b>and</b> <b>Annie</b> Nightingale. Artists that had cult followings in the United States received greater exposure through British national radio and the weekly music press, and many alternative bands had chart success there.|$|E

Jeff returns to the study group, discovering that Abed has also invited Troy, Shirley, Pierce <b>and</b> <b>Annie.</b> Finding Britta smoking outside, he suggests the two study alone, but she persuades him to return.|$|E
