40|$|Recent {{concern over}} the state of patent law {{doctrine}} has led Congress to pass legislation reforming patent reexamination procedures. The effects of the new procedures will remain uncertain for several years. However, Dale Carlson, Co-chair of the Patent Practice Group at Wiggin 2 ̆ 6 Dana, and Jason Crain, a Yale Law School graduate, discuss {{the results of a}} preliminary study of the likely impact of the new inter <b>partes</b> reexamination <b>procedure.</b> In this presentation, Carlson and Crain examine some of the driving forces behind the reform initiative and compare ex <b>parte</b> reexamination <b>procedures</b> with inter <b>partes</b> reexamination <b>procedures.</b> In particular, they address concerns of biases inherent in the new procedure. Ultimately, Carlson and Crain suggest that the new procedure will provide a viable alternative to patent litigation, particularly for small inventors...|$|R
50|$|The {{background}} {{events are}} undisputed and quickly recounted. Maine has two procedures for involuntary psychiatric hospitalization. Section 3863 provides for temporary hospitalization following ex <b>parte</b> <b>procedures</b> — {{that is to}} say, without an adversary proceeding. The procedures include an application by a health or law enforcement officer, a certifying medical examination by a medical practitioner, and an endorsement by a judge or {{justice of the peace}} confirming that these procedures have been followed. Me.Rev.Stat. tit. 34-B, § 3863(1)-(3).|$|R
50|$|The {{search and}} {{examination}} process is principally conducted between {{the patent office}} and the applicant. However, in some jurisdictions, {{it is possible for}} interested third parties to file opinions on the patentability of an application.

Reform legislation is set to create an opposition system in the United States.|$|R

5000|$|Advocates {{argued that}} {{allowing}} a challenge of a patent {{in the first}} year after the issuance or reissuance of a patent would improve patent quality by allowing third party inputs. Opponents note that: (a) inter partes review under the Bill allows a third party to challenge the validity of any claim(s) in a patent *after* the first year; (b) re-exams are in fact used, not as an alternative to litigation, but rather as a supplement to litigation. In FY2008, 62% of current inter partes re-exams and 30% of ex parte re-exams were simultaneously in litigation; (c) predatory corporations can and do file multiple post-grant oppositions against startup companies for the purpose of inflicting financial pain and through this practice have successfully extracted patent licensing and purchase agreements on favorable terms; [...] (d) the existing inter partes process in a contested case now takes 34 to 53 months for an un-appealed reexam (assuming no “rework” by the patent office and no secondary appeals to the BPAI, the Federal Circuit, or the Supreme Court), and 5 to 8 years for appealed cases. [...] When Congress created inter partes reexamination, it directed the USPTO to conduct these reexaminations with [...] "special dispatch." [...] The Bill expands the existing inter <b>partes</b> <b>procedure,</b> addingdiscovery and a hearing in the Patent Trial and Appeal Board. Consequently, under the Bill, pendency of the inter <b>partes</b> <b>procedure</b> will likely increase, despite the legislative fiat requiring 18 month disposition;and (e) the Bill all but requires a federal district court to stay a patent infringement suit copending with an inter partes review. [...] Because of the enormous costs and long pendency of inter partes review, the grant of a stay in a copending infringement suit could effectively be [...] "game over" [...] for the patent owner.|$|R
50|$|In European patent law, the {{limitation}} and revocation procedures before the European Patent Office (EPO) are post-grant, ex <b>parte,</b> administrative <b>procedures</b> allowing any European patent to be centrally limited by an amendment {{of the claims}} or revoked, respectively. These two procedures were introduced in the recently revised text of the European Patent Convention (EPC), i.e. the so-called EPC 2000, which entered into force on 13 December 2007.|$|R
50|$|The {{opposition}} procedure before the European Patent Office (EPO) is a post-grant, contentious, inter <b>partes,</b> administrative <b>procedure</b> intended to allow any European patent to be centrally opposed. European patents {{granted by the}} EPO under the European Patent Convention (EPC) may be opposed by any person from the public (no commercial or other interest whatsoever need be shown). This happens often when some prior art was not found during the grant procedure, but was only known by third parties.|$|R
50|$|Accordingly, {{as federal}} and Maine law stood and still stand, Small and Rehlanderwere {{permanently}} deprived {{of a right}} to bear arms based solely on procedures suitable for temporary hospitalization under emergency conditions. Understandably, nothing in those procedures provided an advance adversary proceeding to test whether the subject was mentally ill or dangerous, but there is also no effective post-hospitalization means to recover the {{right to bear arms}} if the subject had in fact never been mentally ill or dangerous.The constitutional doubts raised by such a regime are sufficient that we now conclude that section 922 should not be read to encompass a temporary hospitalization attended only by the ex <b>parte</b> <b>procedures</b> of section 3863. The ordinary rule is that statutes are to be read to avoid serious constitutional doubts, if that course is possible, Jones v. United States, 529 U.S. 848, 857, 120 S.Ct. 1904, 146 L.Ed.2d 902 (2000), and it is readily possible here. Indeed, some circuit courts had read procedures like section 3863 not to create disability even without constitutional doubts awakened by Heller. See note 1, above. And it is textually permissible to read section 922 not to be triggered by a section 3863 hospitalization.|$|R
40|$|National Director of Public Prosecutions v Mohamed NO 2003 (1) SACR 561 (CC) was {{an appeal}} against {{a finding that}} s 38 of the Prevention of Organised Crime Act 1998 was unconstitutional. In essence, the section allowed the National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) to use an ex <b>parte</b> <b>procedure</b> {{to apply to the}} High Court for a {{preservation}} of property order (at para 1). The High Court had to make the order `if there are reasonable grounds to believe that the property concerned ± is an instrumentality of an offence referred to in Schedule 1; or is the proceeds of unlawful activities' (at para 14). The High Court held that s 38 should be read as if the words `by way of an ex parte application' did not appear in the section. The court also found that s 38 did not allow for a rule nisi procedure and that this was unconstitutional (at paras 8 and 9). Other challenges against the Act were dismissed by the High Court and the respondent did not challenge these findings in the appeal (at paras 9 and 10) ...|$|R
50|$|The grant {{procedure}} before the European Patent Office (EPO) is an ex <b>parte,</b> administrative <b>procedure,</b> {{which includes the}} filing of a European patent application, the examination of formalities, {{the establishment of a}} search report, the publication of the application, its substantive examination, and the grant of a patent, or the refusal of the application, in accordance with the legal provisions of the European Patent Convention (EPC). The {{grant procedure}} is carried out by the EPO {{under the supervision of the}} Administrative Council of the European Patent Organisation. The patents granted in accordance with the EPC are called European patents.|$|R
5000|$|The {{issues before}} us are legal and our review is {{therefore}} de novo. United States v. Volungus, 595 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.2010). The appellants press their constitutional claims in various permutations; {{the most potent}} is that, given Heller's pronouncement of an individual constitutional right to possess arms, the ex <b>parte</b> <b>procedures</b> employed under section 3863 may justify temporary hospitalization but not a permanent deprivation {{of the right to}} bear arms — permanent given the lack of any meaningful way ever to recapture that right.We conclude that this claim is sufficiently powerful that the doctrine of constitutional avoidance requires us to revisit our prior interpretation of section 922(g)(4); and, in doing so, we conclude that section 3863 proceedings do not qualify as a [...] "commitment" [...] for federal purposes. Ordinarily, panel decisions like Chamberlain are binding on subsequent panels but not where intervening Supreme Court precedent requires reconsideration. United States v. Rodríguez, 527 F.3d 221, 224-25 (1st Cir.2008).Chamberlain, at the time it was rendered, was a reasonable albeit not compulsory reading of section 922(g)(4). Although section 3863 did not use the word [...] "commitment" [...] and its procedures were effectively ex parte, it was clear from section 922's legislative history cited in the decision 48*48 that Congress intended an expansive interpretation. Other circuits reached differing conclusions regarding emergency hospitalization procedures similar to section 3863, see note 1, above, but none indicated that there was a constitutional dimension to the problem.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Index Alphabeticus" [...] {{the first}} catalog {{compiled}} by James, {{which consisted of}} 8,700 entries, appeared in July 1605. It was dedicated to Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, {{at the suggestion of}} Bodley (who thought that 'more reward was to be gained from the prince than from the king'). It includes both printed books and manuscripts, arranged alphabetically under the four classes of theology, medicine, law, and arts. A continuation of this classified index, embracing writers on arts and sciences, geography and history, {{is to be found in}} Rawlinson MS. Miscell. 730, drawn up by James after quitting the library. An alphabetical catalogue prepared by him in 1613 was not printed, but remained in the library. A second edition of the catalogue appeared in 1620. It abandoned the classified arrangement of the former catalogue, and adopts only one alphabet of names. There was also issued in 1635 'Catalogus Interpretum S. Scripturæ juxta numerorum ordinem qui extant in Bibliotheca Bodleiana olim a D. Jamesio … concinnatus, nunc vero <b>altera</b> fere <b>parte</b> auctior redditus. … Editio correcta,' Oxford. In 1604, Bodley noted some errors James had made in cataloguing the Hebrew manuscripts, suggesting that James should check with scholars fluent in Hebrew.|$|R
50|$|The {{defendants}} {{responded by}} entering a special {{appearance in the}} Delaware court {{for the purpose of}} moving to quash service of process and to vacate the sequestration order, thus contesting Delaware's exercise of jurisdiction over them. They contended that none of them had ever set foot in Delaware or conducted any activities in that state. They contended that the ex <b>parte</b> sequestration <b>procedure</b> did not accord them due process of law as required by the Fourteenth Amendment, as construed by Supreme Court cases defining the requirements of personal jurisdiction, and that exercising quasi in rem jurisdiction over property in the forum state that was unrelated to the subject-matter of the litigation was constitutionally impermissible.|$|R

Some of these refer to plant genera (cf. p. 273, "Spigelia anthelmintica", and are close to traces of dried plants, indicating that Linnaeus the Younger might have used the volume to press specimens. The imprint of dried specimens can be clearly seen on numerous pages (see pp. 280 - 281, 312 - 313, 329 - 330, 368 - 369, 388 - 389 [...] .). On p. 27, Linnaeus indicates that the specimen is in his collection by writing 'in Museo Linnaei'.

6000|$|Anno Dom. millesimo trecentesimo nonagesimo sexto, magna pars borealis Scotiae, trans Alpes, inquietata fuit per duos pestiferos Cateranos, et eorum sequaces, viz. Scheabeg et suos consanguinarios, qui Clankay, et Cristi Jonsonem ac suos, qui Clanqwhele dicebantur; qui nullo pacto vel tractatu pacificari poterant, nullaque arte regis vel gubernatoris poterant edomari, quoadusque nobilis et industriosus Dominus David de Lindesay de Crawford, at Dominus Thomas comes Moraviae, diligentiam et vires apposuerunt, ac inter partes sic tractaverunt, ut coram domino rege certo die convenirent apud Perth, et alterutra pars eligeret de progenie sua triginta personas adversus triginta de parte contraria, cum gladiis tantum, et arcubus et sagittis, absque deploidibus, vel armaturis aliis, praeter bipennes; et sic congredientes finem liti ponerant, et terra pace potiretur. Utrique igitur parti summe placuit contractus, et die lunae proximo ante festum Sancti Michaelis, apud North insulam de Perth, coram rege et gubernatore et innumerabili multitudine comparentes, conflictum acerrimum inierunt; ubi de sexaginta interfecti sunt omnes, excepto uno {{ex parte}} Clankay et undecim exceptis ex <b>parte</b> <b>altera.</b> Hoc etiam ibi accidit, quod omnes in procinctu belli constituti, unus eorum locum diffugii considerans, inter omnes in amnem elabitur, et aquam de Thaya natando transgreditur; a millenis insequitur, sed nusquam apprehenditur. Stant igitur partes attonitae, tanquam non ad conflictum progressuri, ob defectum evasi: noluit enim pars integrum habens numerum sociorum consentire, ut unus de suis demeretur; nec potuit pars altera quocumque pretio alterum ad supplendum vicem fugientis inducere. Stupent igitur omnes haerentes, de damno fugitivi conquerentes. Et cum totum illud opus cessare putaretur, ecce in medio prorupit unus stipulosus vernaculus, statura modicus, sed efferus, dicens: Ecce ego! quis me conducet intrare cum operariis istis ad hunc ludum theatralem? Pro dimidia enim marca ludum experiar, ultra hoc petens, ut si vivus de palaestra evasero, victum a quocumque vestrum recipiam dum vixero: quia, sicut dicitur, [...] "Majorem caritatem nemo habet, quam ut animam suam ponat suis pro amicis." [...] Quali mercede donabor, qui animam meam pro inimicis reipublicae et regni pono? Quod petiit, a rege et diversis magnatibus conceditur. Cum hoc arcus ejus extenditur, et primo sagittam in partem contrariam transmittit, et unum interficit. Confestim hinc inde sagittae volitant, bipennes librant, gladios vibrant, alterutro certant, et veluti carnifices boves in macello, sic inconsternate ad invicem se trucidant. Sed nec inter tantos repertus est vel unus, qui, tanquam vecors ant timidus, sive post tergum alterius declinans, seipsum a tanta caede praetendit excusare. Iste tamen tyro superveniens finaliter illaesus exivit; et dehinc multo tempore Boreas quievit, nec ibidem fuit, ut supra, cateranorum excursus.|$|R
