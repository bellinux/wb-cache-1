50|$|<b>Alone</b> in <b>the</b> Dark was {{supposed}} to be the first part of Infogrames' Call of Cthulhu series, and later of the Virtual Dreams series (the original French cover included the Virtual Dreams logo), but ended up starting its own franchise. The game was followed by five more games in <b>the</b> series: <b>Alone</b> in <b>the</b> Dark 2 (1993), <b>Alone</b> in <b>the</b> Dark 3 (1994), <b>Alone</b> in <b>the</b> Dark: The New Nightmare (2001), <b>Alone</b> in <b>the</b> Dark (2008) and <b>Alone</b> in <b>the</b> Dark: Illumination (2015), and inspired two live-action films <b>Alone</b> in <b>the</b> Dark and <b>Alone</b> in <b>the</b> Dark II.

Uwe Boll stated his disappointment on the region 1 DVD commentary but also said that Atari had face shots of Christian Slater for the newest game - <b>Alone</b> in <b>the</b> Dark 5, which was released on June 26, 2008.|$|R

5|$|About 3,000 runestones {{from the}} Viking Age have been {{discovered}} in Scandinavia of which c. 2,700 were raised within what today is Sweden.

In Uppland, c. 70% of the inscriptions are explicitly Christian, which is shown by engraved crosses or added Christian prayers, while only a few runestones are explicitly pagan. The runestone tradition probably died out before 1100, and at the latest by 1125.|$|E

5|$|At a {{time when}} medical {{practice}} was in its infancy, and patients often fared better if left <b>alone,</b> <b>the</b> Christian Science message was a welcome one. In 1882 Eddy set up the Massachusetts Metaphysical College in Boston, where, for $300 for a 12-lesson course, she and her students taught mostly women how to become Christian Science practitioners, licensed to offer Christian Science prayer to the sick. The college made Eddy a wealthy woman; when she died in December 1910 her estate was valued at $1.5 million.|$|E
