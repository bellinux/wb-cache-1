50|$|The building's {{original}} marble cladding {{was replaced}} after several panels {{fell from the}} building in 1985 and 1986. The problem was traced to <b>the</b> thinness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> panels (1.25 in and <b>the</b> method <b>of</b> <b>anchorage</b> to <b>the</b> <b>frame.</b> As a result <b>of</b> extensive investigation, <b>the</b> panels were replaced with neoparium, a glass product that appeared indistinguishable from marble at more than 100 ft. This failure mode was not uncommon in buildings of this era that employed thin marble cladding. Several buildings, most notably the Aon Center in Chicago were re-clad with materials other than marble.|$|R
