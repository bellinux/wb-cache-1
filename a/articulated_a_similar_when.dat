40|$|In this essay, Professor Siegel {{examines}} {{the nature and}} function of constitutional visions in the American constitutional order. He argues that Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg possesses such a vision and that her vision is defined by her oft-stated commitment to “full human stature,” to “equal citizenship stature. ” He then defends Justice Ginsburg’s characteristically incremental and moderate approach to realizing her vision. He does so in part by establishing that President Barack Obama <b>articulated</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> vision and approach in his Philadelphia speech on American race relations and illustrated its capacity to succeed during the 2008 presidential election...|$|R

The decision affirmed, by a 6–2 margin, the conviction of eleven communist leaders for conspiring to overthrow the US government under the Smith Act. In it, he again argued that judges [...] "are not legislators, that direct policy-making is not our province." [...] He recognized that curtailing the free speech of those who advocate the overthrow of government by force, also risked stifling criticism by those who did not, writing that [...] " [...] is a sobering fact that in sustaining the convictions before us we can hardly escape restriction on the interchange of ideas." ...|$|R

40|$|Ocampo (Argentina, 1890 - 1979) and Reyes (Mexico, 1889 - 1959) were arguably Latin America's most {{influential}} writers and cultural catalysts {{in the first}} half of the twentieth century. They met in Argentina in 1927 and their friendship and correspondence lasted until Reyes's death. Over three decades of private and public discourse, they <b>articulated</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> vision of Latin American identity and its future potential. Because they were both internationally known—Ocampo as founder and director of the literary review SUR, and Reyes as a diplomat and intellectual leader—their ideas found resonance in the Americas and Europe. Two dramatic works they wrote before meeting, Ifigenia cruel (Reyes) and La laguna de los nenúfares (Ocampo), prefigure their approach to the Latin American condition through the themes of displacement and self-renovation. Ocampo and Reyes believed that it would be the task of an educated elite to lead Latin America toward a transnational cultural synthesis and renewal. Ulysses's malady was their metaphor for the postcolonial condition that enabled Latin American minds to be open to exploration and dialogue in search of an authentic identity...|$|R
