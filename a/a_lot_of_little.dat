Gemma Whelan, who plays Yara, talked about filming the scene: [...] "Oh my goodness – I was so excited when I saw that I had a scene with those two [...]" [...] About the dynamic between the two women, Whelan said: [...] "It's clear as the scene plays out that Yara quite likes Dany. We share <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>little</b> looks and there's some playful language in how we talk to one another – Dany asks if the Iron Islands ever had a queen, and Yara says, 'No more than Westeros.' They recognize the girl-power undertow between the two of them." ...|$|E

2500|$|The band's first {{performance}} in 2005 {{was at the}} Live 8 concert, Barrie, Ontario on July 2 where the song [...] "Where Are You" [...] was premiered in its final form. For this tour they were accompanied by guitarist Joel Shearer of the band Pedestrian. Leading up to the album's release, they toured several small clubs in the Los Angeles area [...] "to work the bugs out" [...] and help the band get a better feel for the songs. They then toured steadily across North America, opening two shows for The Rolling Stones, until October when a family member of a band member became ill and several shows had to be canceled. The band chose to play smaller venues on this tour rather than arenas because the sound quality was better. [...] "And for us, this new record {{is one of those}} things where there are <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>little</b> guitar parts happening all over the place and little textures -- and we want to hear that stuff." [...] A cross-Canadian tour continued through summer of 2006 with the final show being played at Rogers Centre in Toronto. The band entered a hiatus period after this while Maida worked on his solo album, The Hunter's Lullaby. They wouldn't play live again until mid-2008.|$|E

5000|$|Carter Doston from TV Fanatic {{gave the}} episode {{three and a}} half stars out of five, saying [...] "There were <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> funny <b>little</b> lines, some cutaways that largely fell flat, It wasn't great, but I've sure seen worse from this series." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{idea for}} Pan's Labyrinth came from Guillermo del Toro's notebooks, {{which he says}} are filled with [...] "doodles, ideas, {{drawings}} and plot bits". He had been keeping these notebooks for twenty years. At one point during production, he left the notebook in a taxi in London and was distraught, but the cabbie returned it to him two days later. Though he originally wrote {{a story about a}} pregnant woman who {{falls in love with a}} faun, Sergi López said that del Toro described the final version of the plot a year and a half before filming. Lopez said that [...] "for two hours and a half he explained to me all the movie, but with all the details, it was incredible, and when he finished I said, 'You have a script?' He said, 'No, nothing is written'". López agreed to act in the movie and received the script one year later; he said that [...] "it was exactly the same, it was incredible. In his little head he had all the history with <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>little</b> detail, a lot of characters, like now when you look at the movie, it was exactly what he had in his head".|$|E

50|$|The last key {{principle}} {{is for the}} programs {{to be at the}} lowest cost possible and to be a sustainable development. The goal is to make <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> out <b>of</b> <b>little.</b> It is also important that the effort has a lasting impact not dependent on outside contribution later on.|$|R

I have a little Casio SK-1 that has a built in sampler. My favorite microphone I found at the landfill. It was on a CB base station.

5000|$|Matthew Gilbert of the Boston Globe's summary was typical: [...] " [...] "On the Lot" [...] {{does what}} every knockoff reality contest does -- three judges, <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> humiliation, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit <b>of</b> triumph, some product {{placement}} -- and it doesn't do it well." ...|$|R
5000|$|Yeah, we've got {{a ton of}} {{behind the}} scenes stuff. We made this in the era where {{everyone}} has a digital camera so we unearthed an interview from year one with Ellar, Lorelei, Patricia and myself, Patricia interviewed me in 2002. I hadn't seen this since we shot it, Ellar had forgotten {{quite a bit of}} it but he got to see himself as a wide-eyed six year old. For people who like the movie, I think there will be <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> cool <b>little</b> treasures.|$|R
6000|$|Ol' Mistah Buzzard {{had just}} {{told the story}} of why he has a bald head and is proud of it. You know he hasn't a feather on it, and it is very, very red.

60|$|GERALD. I hope I am. It's quite {{a relief}} to me to feel that I may be wicked. I fear I'm not.

60|$|That is what Farmer Brown's boy {{did when}} he met Buster Bear, and <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> the <b>little</b> people <b>of</b> the Green Forest and some from the Green Meadows saw him.

5000|$|A {{positive}} {{review by}} the CBC's Alison Gilmor wrote, [...] "In this offbeat crime caper by young local filmmaker...

60|$|In the Laughing Brook, which rippled {{and sings}} all day long, lived Mr. Trout and Mrs. Trout, and <b>a</b> whole <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>little</b> Trouts.

60|$|Poor Gerald, such <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>little</b> wheels to his make-up! He {{was more}} {{intricate}} than a chronometer-watch. But oh heavens, what weariness! What weariness, God above! A chronometer-watch--a beetle--her soul fainted with utter ennui, from the thought. So many wheels to count and consider and calculate! Enough, enough--there was {{an end to}} man's capacity for complications, even. Or perhaps there was no end.|$|E
60|$|<b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>little</b> meadow people heard Blacky say this, and Reddy knew it.

He would.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It rather puzzled {{me at the}} time,' said Mr Boffin, 'and {{it rather}} puzzled me and Mrs Boffin when we spoke of it afterwards, because (not to make a mystery of our belief) we have always {{believed}} a Secretary to {{be a piece of}} furniture, mostly of mahogany, lined with green baize or leather, with <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>little</b> drawers in it.

60|$|Some of {{the boys}} had their arms round one another's necks, talking as loud as they could into one another's faces, and some {{whooping}} and holloing, and playing Indian, and some throwing stones and scaring cats. They had nearly as many dogs as there were boys, and there were pretty nearly all {{the boys in the}} neighborhood. There seemed to be thirty or forty of them, they talked so loud and ran round so, but perhaps there were only ten or eleven. Hen Billard was along, and so were Piccolo Wright and Archie Hawkins, and then <b>a</b> great <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>little</b> fellows.|$|R
50|$|It {{starts with}} Lorraine {{discovering}} that Barbara's sugar bowl {{is full of}} salt. Lorraine notices <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> odd <b>little</b> things about Barbara's behavior. The main thing is that her daughter is uncharacteristically quick to anger. Lorraine asks George if he hasn't noticed the changes in Barbara, but he brushes it off. But George has indeed noticed the changes in Barbara and is most troubled by her temper, which has always had an edge, but seems now to be careening out of control. One evening she gets so angry during a squabble that she bites her husband.|$|R
60|$|At {{the time}} I failed {{to realize that}} our fleet of small boats {{amounted}} to nothing, as compared with either city which the British was threatening, and that the commodore never showed {{himself to be a}} better fighter than when he allowed the enemy to spend their time with <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> boats <b>of</b> <b>little</b> value, while he was marching his men across country to aid in the defense of Washington.|$|R
