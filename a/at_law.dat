5|$|It {{appeared}} that Brooks had exhausted all legal avenues at this point, but on June 16, 1873, he filed another lawsuit against Baxter, {{this time with}} the Pulaski County district court.

On October 8, 1873, Baxter filed a plea of non-jurisdiction, but he believed that the court might decide against him. He issued a telegram to President Grant informing him of the basic situation in Arkansas and asked for federal troops to help him maintain the peace. Grant denied his request.|$|E

5|$|For {{almost all}} of their history, Serjeants <b>at</b> <b>Law</b> and King's Serjeants were the only advocates given rights of {{audience}} in the Court of Common Pleas. Until the 17th century they were also first {{in the order of}} precedence in the Court of King's Bench and Court of Chancery, which gave them priority in motions before the court. Serjeants also had the privilege of being immune from most normal forms of lawsuit â€“ they could only be sued by a writ from the Court of Chancery. It was held as an extension of this that servants of Serjeants could only be sued in the Common Pleas. As part of the Court of Common Pleas the Serjeants also performed some judicial duties, such as levying fines. In exchange for these privileges, Serjeants were expected to fulfil certain duties; firstly, that they represent anybody who asked regardless of their ability to pay, and secondly that, due to the small number of judges, they serve as deputy judges to hear cases when there was no judge available.|$|E
5|$|The Briarcliff Manor-Scarborough Historical Society (BMSHS) is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit {{organization}} {{committed to}} local preservation, research, and education. In March 1974, after the village mayor appointed twelve {{people for a}} 75th anniversary committee, the committee began by forming the Briarcliff Manor-Scarborough Historical Society, which received its provisional charter around that time. The historical society published an updated village history (A Village Between Two Rivers: Briarcliff Manor) in 1977, marking the 75th anniversary of the village. The organization has since published several books, including a comprehensive history of the village. The publication, The Changing Landscape, a History of Briarcliff Manor-Scarborough, was written by Mary Cheever, wife of novelist John Cheever. In 2016, the society and village government created and dedicated a memorial to Medal of Honor recipient John Koelsch <b>at</b> <b>Law</b> Memorial Park.|$|E

5|$|The episode {{begins in}} an {{abandoned}} warehouse, where Dean (Ackles) is attacked by the djinn that he is hunting. He suddenly finds himself {{in a world in}} which his mother (Smith) was not killed by the demon Azazel. He and his brother Sam (Jared Padalecki) were not raised to be hunters of supernatural creatures, but are no longer close, as Dean is irresponsible, disloyal, and drinks too much in this alternate reality; when a confused Dean calls him for help, Sam thinks that he is drunk. In the new reality, Dean is dating the beautiful Carmen (Michelle Borth), and Sam is <b>at</b> <b>law</b> school and engaged to Jessica (Palicki)another victim of Azazel. Although Dean enjoys his new life, a ghostly young woman seems to be haunting him and he is confronted by an image of corpses in his closet. He realizes that all the people that he and Sam had saved as hunters are now dead, that he and Sam have a distant and somewhat adversarial relationship. After visiting the grave of his father John, who died the previous year of a stroke, Dean decides that he must give up his new-found happiness to save them.|$|E
5|$|The {{plaintiff}} in Lines International {{argued that the}} guidelines adopted by the multi-agency committee {{set up by the}} PSA, STPB and GSB were invalid as the committee had no existence <b>at</b> <b>law.</b> The High Court held that there was nothing unlawful or even intrinsically wrong with these government agencies setting up such a committee to discuss matters of relevance to their respective jurisdictions as long as each agency made its own decisions within the ambit of its own statutory powers. The notion that such a committee fettered PSA's discretion was dismissed by a further finding of fact that the ad-hoc committee had not acted as an entity in itself. Enforcement and appropriate action were left to the agencies. A meeting attended by the plaintiff's representatives at which the guidelines relating to cruises-to-nowhere were announced was facilitated by a moderator rather than a chairperson, and each of the agencies read out guidelines which they themselves would be adopting and implementing.|$|E
