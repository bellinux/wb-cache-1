50|$|After {{a number}} of ambitious schemes, one {{of which had been}} {{designed}} by the famed Oscar Niemeyer, to enlarge the college in the 1960s fell through due to lack of funds, the college decided to concentrate its efforts in providing {{for the construction of a}} small extension and acquisition of neighbouring properties. The Hilda Besse building, or 'New Building' as it was then known, was opened in 1970; this building still serves its original purpose to this day in housing the college's dining hall and graduate common room as well as a great number of <b>ancillary</b> <b>meeting</b> rooms. The next major expansion of the college came in 1993 with the completion of a new building to house the Nissan Institute for Japanese Studies and the Bodleian Japanese Library, whilst additional accommodation was not supplied until the Founder's Building was opened to mark the millennium in the year 2000.|$|E
