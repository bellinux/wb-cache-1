5|$|Testaroli {{is a type}} of pancake-like pasta {{prepared}} using water, {{wheat flour}} and salt that is sliced into triangular shapes. Chestnut flour is sometimes used in its preparation. The ingredients are mixed together and prepared as a batter, after which it is cooked, sometimes using a two-stage cooking process. In the typical first stage, and sometimes only stage of cooking, the batter is poured and cooked on a hot, flat surface in the style of a pancake or crêpe. In this process, testaroli is traditionally cooked on a testo, which may be prepared for use by being heated over hot coals. <b>A</b> <b>skillet</b> is another cooking device {{that can be used to}} cook the batter. The pasta is then sliced into triangles, and is sometimes directly served after this cooking process. In the second cooking stage that is sometimes performed, the pasta may be set aside to cool, and then cooked further in boiling water.|$|E
25|$|Ham {{and eggs}} {{is a popular}} dish often served as a breakfast meal in the United States. It is also {{consumed}} as a dinner or supper dish, for example {{in parts of the}} Southern United States, and is sometimes served as a lunch dish. Ham and eggs are the primary ingredients. Eggs served with the dish can be fried, scrambled or poached. Additional ingredients such as tomatoes and seasonings, such as Herbes de Provence, are sometimes used. The dish can be prepared on a stovetop in <b>a</b> <b>skillet</b> or frying pan, and also baked or broiled in an oven.|$|E

500|$|In {{the preface}} to the book, Villas states that vegetarians {{and those that do}} not eat pork for {{religious}} reasons are [...] "haunted instinctively by the sensuous, irresistible enticement". He asserts, [...] "There's no one who doesn't love bacon. It's the greatest food God has ever created." [...] Villas asks, [...] "Who, under any circumstances, is not rendered almost helpless by the tantalizing sound of bacon sizzling slowly in <b>a</b> <b>skillet,</b> by the taunting backwoods aroma that permeates the air ...?" [...] He notes that [...] "the greatest and most beloved food on earth" [...] is one of the worlds oldest forms of cooked meat. The author comments on the surge in interest in bacon products in the years prior to the book's publication, [...] "Just the 40 percent increase in bacon consumption in the United States {{over the past five years}} might have justified my writing this book." [...] The book includes photographs by Andrea Grablewski.|$|E

[...] The clip is centered around a trailer park hood and a subsequent soiree. It starts with a dog barking behind a fencing, followed by multiple intercut scenery, which includes two men engaged in a conversation, a woman leaning against a car, a little girl riding a bicycle and a saucepan caught in fire. Then, Beyoncé appears, dressed in bright colored as well as flashy garments, sporting neon-colored oval shaped nails, and bright-colored lipstick. She is cooking in <b>a</b> <b>skillet</b> while one of her neighbors drinks from a hose. As she sings, looking into the camera, she highlights and plays with her hair. The action shifts from the double wide to a sunny summer backyard barbecue, where Beyoncé and her friends dance as Solange is deejaying.

60|$|We passed {{next day}} two adventurers {{tramping}} {{their way to}} Hazleton. Each man carried a roll of cheap quilts, <b>a</b> <b>skillet,</b> and a cup.

That was a wise thought; matches were hardly known there in that day. They saw a fire smouldering upon a great raft a hundred yards above, and they went stealthily thither and helped themselves to a chunk. They made an imposing adventure of it, saying, [...] "Hist!" [...] every now and then, and suddenly halting with finger on lip; moving with hands on imaginary dagger-hilts; and giving orders in dismal whispers that if [...] "the foe" [...] stirred, to [...] "let him have it to the hilt," [...] because [...] "dead men tell no tales."

6000|$|No {{other single}} relation, however, can compare in importance, for Coleridge's poetic development, with that which sprang {{up in the}} summer of 1797 between him and William Wordsworth. Just when they first met is not recorded. We have seen that Coleridge was acquainted with Wordsworth's younger brother in his college days, and {{discussed}} with him Wordsworth's first published poems. In January, 1797, he told Cottle that he wished to submit his [...] "Visions of the Maid of Arc" [...] to Wordsworth for criticism. The earliest definite record of their personal acquaintance is a letter Coleridge wrote to Cottle while on a visit to Wordsworth at Racedown (just over the Somerset border in Dorsetshire) early in June. About the beginning of July he is again at Racedown; and when he returns he brings Wordsworth and his sister Dorothy with him for a visit. On the 7th Lamb arrived for his long-planned reunion with Coleridge. The second week of July, 1797, was thus a rich and long-remembered time for all of them, despite the fact that Mrs. Coleridge [...] "accidentally emptied <b>a</b> <b>skillet</b> of boiling milk" [...] on her husband's foot, which confined him [...] "during the whole time of Charles Lamb's stay." [...] The others took long walks in the neighborhood, amid such scenery as is described in [...] "This Lime-Tree Bower My Prison," [...] a poem that admirably voices the happiness, of those days of spiritual fellowship. The Wordsworths did not return to Racedown. [...] "By a combination of curious circumstances a gentleman's seat, with a park and woods, elegantly and completely furnished,... in the most beautiful and romantic situation by the seaside, four miles from Stowey--this we have got for Wordsworth at the rent of twenty-three pounds a year, taxes included!" [...] Coleridge triumphantly announced to Southey; and in this house, the Manor of Alfoxden, the Wordsworths remained for a year, in daily companionship with Coleridge and surrounded by scenes of natural beauty that have left a lasting mark on the work of both poets.|$|E
6000|$|My furniture, part {{of which}} I made myself--and the rest cost me nothing of which I have not {{rendered}} an account--consisted of a bed, a table, a desk, three chairs, a looking-glass three inches in diameter, a pair of tongs and andirons, a kettle, <b>a</b> <b>skillet,</b> and a frying-pan, a dipper, a wash-bowl, two knives and forks, three plates, one cup, one spoon, a jug for oil, a jug for molasses, and a japanned lamp. None is so poor that he need sit on a pumpkin. That is shiftlessness. There is a plenty of such chairs as I like best in the village garrets to be had for taking them away. Furniture! Thank God, I can sit and I can stand {{without the aid of}} a furniture warehouse. What man but a philosopher would not be ashamed to see his furniture packed in a cart and going up country exposed to the light of heaven and the eyes of men, a beggarly account of empty boxes? That is Spaulding's furniture. I could never tell from inspecting such a load whether it belonged to a so-called rich man or a poor one; the owner always seemed poverty-stricken. Indeed, the more you have of such things the poorer you are. Each load looks as if it contained the contents of a dozen shanties; and if one shanty is poor, this is a dozen times as poor. Pray, for what do we move ever but to get rid of our furniture, our exuviæ: at last to go from this world to another newly furnished, and leave this to be burned? It is the same as if all these traps were buckled to a man's belt, and he could not move over the rough country where our lines are cast without dragging them--dragging his trap. He was a lucky fox that left his tail in the trap. The muskrat will gnaw his third leg off to be free. No wonder man has lost his elasticity. How often he is at a dead set! [...] "Sir, if I may be so bold, {{what do you mean by}} a dead set?" [...] If you are a seer, whenever you meet a man you will see all that he owns, ay, and much that he pretends to disown, behind him, even to his kitchen furniture and all the trumpery which he saves and will not burn, and he will appear to be harnessed to it and making what headway he can. I think that the man is at a dead set who has got through a knot-hole or gateway where his sledge load of furniture cannot follow him. I cannot but feel compassion when I hear some trig, compact-looking man, seemingly free, all girded and ready, speak of his [...] "furniture," [...] as whether it is insured or not. [...] "But what shall I do with my furniture?"--My gay butterfly is entangled in a spider's web then. Even those who seem for a long while not to have any, if you inquire more narrowly you will find have some stored in somebody's barn. I look upon England today as an old gentleman who is travelling with a great deal of baggage, trumpery which has accumulated from long housekeeping, which he has not the courage to burn; great trunk, little trunk, bandbox, and bundle. Throw away the first three at least. It would surpass the powers of a well man nowadays to take up his bed and walk, and I should certainly advise a sick one to lay down his bed and run. When I have met an immigrant tottering under a bundle which contained his all--looking like an enormous wen which had grown out of the nape of his neck--I have pitied him, not because that was his all, but because he had all that to carry. If I have got to drag my trap, I will take care that it be a light one and do not nip me in a vital part. But perchance it would be wisest never to put one's paw into it.|$|E
