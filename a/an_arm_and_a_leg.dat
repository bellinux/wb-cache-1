500|$|Solitaire later leaves Mr Big and {{contacts}} Bond; the couple travel by train to St. Petersburg, Florida, where they meet Leiter. While Bond and Leiter are scouting one of Mr Big's warehouses used for storing exotic fish, Solitaire is kidnapped by Mr Big's minions. Leiter later {{returns to the}} warehouse by himself, but is either captured and fed to a shark or tricked into standing on a trap door over the shark tank through which he falls; he survives, but loses <b>an</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>leg.</b> Bond finds him in their safe house with a note pinned to his chest [...] "He disagreed with something that ate him". Bond then investigates the warehouse himself and discovers that Mr Big is smuggling gold [...] coins by hiding them {{in the bottom of}} fish tanks holding poisonous tropical fish, which he is bringing into the US. He is attacked in the warehouse by [...] "the Robber", Mr Big's gunman, and in the resultant gunfight Bond outwits the Robber and causes him to fall into the shark tank.|$|E
500|$|Fleming {{builds the}} main {{character}} in Live and Let Die to make Bond come across as more human than in Casino Royale, becoming [...] "a much warmer, more likeable man from the opening chapter", according to the American novelist Raymond Benson, who between 1997 and 2002 wrote a series of Bond novels and short stories. Savoye sees {{the introduction of a}} vulnerable side to Bond, identifying the agent's tears {{towards the end of the}} story as evidence of this. Similarly, over the course of the book, the American character Leiter develops and also emerges as a more complete and human character and his and Bond's friendship is evident in the story. Despite the relationship, Leiter is again subordinate to Bond. While in Casino Royale his role was to provide technical support and money to Bond, in Live and Let Die the character is secondary to Bond, and the only time he takes the initiative, he loses <b>an</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>leg,</b> while Bond wins his own battle with the same opponent. Although Fleming had initially intended to kill Leiter off in the story, his American literary agent protested, and the character was saved.|$|E

2500|$|In October 1960, {{at the age}} of eighty-three, Rummel broke <b>an</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>leg</b> in a fall, {{after which}} he nearly died from pneumonia. [...] Rummel {{recovered}} and continued to serve as archbishop for another four years, but his health was a recurring concern during the last few years of his life. [...] He was given a coadjutor, John Cody, in 1961.|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} was subsequently killed off, dying {{in her sleep}} in July 1988 after being frequently ill throughout the year. The character's final episodes were written by Tony Holland and directed by Julia Smith. Lou spent her final day arranging her affairs, seeing various members of her family, passing on advice and giving them presents {{and at the end}} of the episode she announced: [...] "That's you lot sorted. I can go now." [...] At the start of episode 359, Lou was found to have died peacefully in her sleep. The episode then jumped a few days later to the day of her funeral — an emotional episode, which featured Pete breaking down at Lou's graveside and ended with him proposing a toast in the Vic to absent friends and that [...] "bloody old bag." [...] The episode was also notable for featuring, for the first time, a train crossing the railway viaduct in Bridge Street — a special-effects shot commissioned especially for the occasion. The train was actually a ten-second illusion, produced by the BBC's electronic workshop. One EastEnders official commented: [...] "It cost <b>an</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>leg,</b> but old Lou was worth it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Tell {{him what}} we're driving at. Get {{it into his}} head somehow," [...] said Moorshed; and Pyecroft, {{snatching}} the cup from me, enfolded the old man with <b>an</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> mist of wonderful words.|$|R
6000|$|... "There goes <b>an</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> sword {{that might}} well shorten a Christian's days," [...] said the dissolute and shameless dealer in the church's abuses, [...] "and, {{yet no one}} asks his name or calling!" ...|$|R
60|$|Babalatchi twitched gently Lingard's sleeve, {{and when}} the old seaman had lifted up his head interrogatively, he {{stretched}} out <b>an</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> pointing forefinger towards Willems' house, now plainly visible {{to the right and}} beyond the big tree of the courtyard.|$|R
60|$|If Helen had {{not been}} so frightened for Bo she {{would have been able to}} enjoy her other sensations. Creeping, cold thrills chased over her as Bo, supple and quick, slid <b>an</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>leg</b> over Pony and {{straightened}} up on him with a defiant cry. Pony jerked his head down, brought his feet together in one jump, and began to bounce. Bo got the swing of him this time and stayed on.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you haven't got {{to believe}} it, Billy," [...] {{answered}} Tom. [...] "At the same time, you'll be a fine specimen of a college boy if you come back next Fall minus <b>an</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>leg.</b> How on earth {{are you going to}} any of the fashionable dances in that condition?" [...] And at this, there was a general snicker, in the midst of which William Philander arose, caught up his dresssuit case, and fled to another car.|$|E
60|$|There was a {{scrambling}} of feet in {{the passage}} outside, and then a repetition of the onslaught on the door. This time, however, the door, instead of resisting, swung open, and the human battering ram staggered through into the study. Mike, turning after relocking the door, was {{just in time to}} see Psmith, with a display of energy of which one would not have believed him capable, grip the invader scientifically by <b>an</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>leg.</b>|$|E
6000|$|I lastly {{was with}} Curtis among the {{floating}} batt'ries, [...] And there I left for witness <b>an</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> limb; [...] Yet let my country need me, with Elliot to head me, [...] I'd clatter on my stumps {{at the sound}} of a drum.|$|R

6000|$|... "Then Steel {{went back}} for the wagon after we found you had <b>an</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> {{collarbone}} broken. I rode in to the railroad <b>and</b> wired for <b>a</b> doctor. Sally came over to nurse you, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> pretty tough time she has had of it. You had fever mighty bad." ...|$|R
60|$|After {{five weeks}} it cut its two upper front teeth, {{but in all}} this time it had not grown the least bit, {{remaining}} both in size and weight the same as when I first procured it. This was no doubt owing to the want of milk or other equally nourishing food. Rice-water, rice, and biscuits were but a poor substitute, and the expressed milk of the cocoa-nut which I sometimes gave it did not quite agree with its stomach. To this I imputed an attack of diarrhoea from which the poor little creature suffered greatly, but a small dose of castor-oil operated well, and cured it. A week or two afterwards it was again taken ill, and this time more seriously. The symptoms were exactly those of intermittent fever, accompanied by watery swellings on the feet and head. It lost all appetite for its food, and, after lingering for a week a most pitiable object, died, after being in my possession nearly three months. I much regretted {{the loss of my}} little pet, which I had at one time looked forward to bringing up to years of maturity, and taking home to England. For several months it had afforded me daily amusement by its curious ways and the inimitably ludicrous expression of its little countenance. Its weight was three pounds nine ounces, its height fourteen inches, and the spread of its arms twenty-three inches. I preserved its skin and skeleton, and in doing so found that when it fell from the tree it must have broken <b>an</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>leg,</b> which had, however, united so rapidly that I had only noticed the hard swellings on the limbs where the irregular junction of the bones had taken place.|$|E
