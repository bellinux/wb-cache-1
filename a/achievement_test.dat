Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 46 - 48 Testing {{has been}} of interest to researchers, teachers, administrators, parents, and learners for a long time. Therefore, many studies on different aspects of testing has been done. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the attitudes of teachers and testers toward the <b>achievement</b> <b>tests</b> prepared by testers in the Department of Basic English (DBE) at Middle East Technical University (METU). Five research questions focused on the attitudes of teachers and testers towards the <b>achievement</b> <b>tests</b> prepared by testers, whether teachers and testers had different attitudes towards midterm exams and pop quizzes, and whether being an ex-tester affected teachers’ attitudes towards <b>achievement</b> <b>tests</b> prepared by testers. The research was conducted in DBE at METU. Seventy-two teachers and four testers participated in this study. Data were collected through two different but parallel questionnaires, one of which was for teachers and the other for testers. Both questionnaires consisted of two parts. The first part included questions ondemographic information about the participants and the second partwas made upof questions about the <b>achievement</b> <b>tests</b> prepared by testers. The teachers’ questionnaire included 40 questions and the testers’ questionnaire included 36 questions. The data were analysed in four sections, which are opinions about the present testing situation, teachers’ opinions about preparing their own <b>achievement</b> <b>tests,</b> the relationship between testing and teaching, and the design of tests. Testers were not asked about teachers preparing their own <b>achievement</b> <b>tests.</b> The results showed that on the whole both teachers and testers had positive attitudes towards the <b>achievement</b> <b>tests</b> prepared by testers. Both groups seem to be content with the present testing situation, how the relationship between testing and teaching is established, and the design of the tests. Furthermore, the questions which revealed teachers’ opinions about preparing their <b>achievement</b> <b>tests</b> showed that they were pleased with having the <b>achievement</b> <b>tests</b> prepared by testers because out of 72 teachers only one said he/she wanted to prepare the <b>achievement</b> <b>tests.</b> However, testers answers showed that they were ‘uncertain’ whether there was an active cooperation between teachers and testers. The analysis showed that being an ex-tester was not affecting teachers’ answers as the results of the correlations was insignificant. It also revealed that teachers and tester did not have different attitudes towards different <b>achievement</b> <b>tests,</b> which are midterm exams and pop quizzes. After analysing the data, some suggestions were made. It might be necessary to ask teachers to fill in questionnaires in order to give direct, systematic feedback and to reveal their positive attitudes. Furthermore, it might be good to make a change in the make up of the testing office in order to help the newly appointed testers. Kuntasal, İlknurM. S...|$|R
