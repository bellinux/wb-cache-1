5|$|Until {{the late}} 1950s, {{when the federal}} {{government}} shifted to a day school integration model, residential schools were severely underfunded and often relied on the forced labour of their students to maintain their facilities, although it was presented as training for artisan skills. The work was arduous, and severely compromised the <b>academic</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> development of the students. School books and textbooks were drawn mainly from the curricula of the provincially funded public schools for non-Indigenous students, and teachers at the residential schools were often poorly trained or prepared. During this same period, Canadian government scientists performed nutritional tests on students and knowingly kept some students undernourished to serve as the control sample.|$|E
5|$|When it {{was founded}} in March 1839 as the {{flagship}} school of what later became the Baltimore City Public Schools, Baltimore City College was charged with providing a unique classics- and liberal arts-based course of study and with holding all members of its school community to the highest standards of academic achievement and personal development. The school's mission is to prepare its students to succeed in the best colleges In the United States. The faculty and staff of the school strive to engage every student in a rigorous university preparatory study of liberal arts, provide strong extended <b>academic</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> support services, and to develop students who enjoy studying and learning. The school's ultimate goal is to produce competitive graduates who have an appreciation for scholarship, perform well on meaningful assessments, make meaningful contributions to society, behave with civility and respect, and perform as reasonable leaders.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} aims {{to study}} the information characteristics of humanities <b>academics</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> scientists in Thailand when producing <b>academic</b> articles <b>and</b> to identify the problems of their information usage. A set of questionnaires was sent to 203 samples who had articles published in six qualified journals indexed in both Thai and foreign databases. The findings showed that the types of information used were mostly books, following by research articles, reviewed articles, book/movie reviews. To produce one article, they used less than 10 books, 10 - 20 research articles, 10 - 20 reviewed articles, and less than 10 book/movie reviews. Most of the articles were written in the Thai language. The humanities <b>academics</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> scientists spent the longest time searching for research articles. The overall problems of information usage concerning information centers/libraries, humanities <b>academics</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> scientists themselves, humanities <b>and</b> <b>social</b> sciences information, <b>and</b> publishers were moderate. However, there were higher levels of problems in these aspects: audio-visual materials, real materials.

25|$|Lowell {{immediately}} embarked upon {{a series}} of reforms that were both <b>academic</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> in nature. Under his predecessor, Charles W.

That was a logical extension of the trend in U.S. education that had modeled the university on the German system, including the German principle of student freedom in choosing courses. So dominant was Harvard's role in American education that all large American colleges and universities had adopted the elective system by 1904. It appealed to all student types, those intellectually curious and energetic {{as well as the}} lazy without intellectual ambition.|$|E

In succeeding decades after his visit the American community substantially grew and then spread across South America, Australasia, Subsaharan Africa and the Far East.|$|E

25|$|The {{students}} of the University enjoy an unusual family tradition designed to make new students feel at home and build relationships within the student body. Traditionally, a Bejant or Bejantine acquires academic parents who are at least in their third year as students. These older students act as informal mentors in <b>academic</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> matters {{and it is not}} uncommon for such academic family ties to stretch well beyond student days. Tradition has it that a Bejant may ask a man to be his Senior Man but must be invited by a woman who is prepared to be his Senior Woman. Similarly, a Bejantine may ask a male to be her Senior Man but there is no overt rule regarding how she acquires a Senior Woman. The establishment of these relationships begins at the very start of the first semester – with the aim of being in place ahead of Raisin Weekend.|$|E

She is referred to as a freak by the other students. Because of her father's status, she has to have the protection of a bodyguard, Wahim, who isolates her from the other students until Mia sits with her after a fight with Lilly in the first novel. All three girls quickly develop a solid friendship, and Tina eventually uses her generous weekly allowance to support Lilly's Public-access television show. She first goes out with Dave Farouq-El-Abar from another school, 'Trinity', and, after Dave breaks up with her, later dates Boris Pelkowski after Lilly breaks his heart. After Mia and Lilly's estrangement {{at the end of the}} eighth novel, Mia comes to see Tina as her best friend. Tina constantly reads romance novels, making Mia consider her an expert in romance. Though prone to imaginative flights of fancy and often seen as a little silly, Tina can be extremely acute about both <b>academic</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> matters. Tina is very loyal to Mia, who consults her for sensitive advice rather than the harsher Lilly. Tina also believes that she must remain pure because she dreams that one day she will marry Prince William of Wales and to do so she must remain a virgin. Despite this, she confesses to having sex with Boris in Forever Princess.She later becomes a medical student in NYU New York University.She and Boris break up in the eleventh because Tina suspects him of having an affair.

500|$|Duke {{requires}} {{its students}} {{to live on}} campus {{for the first three}} years of undergraduate life, except for a small percentage of second-semester juniors who are exempted by a lottery system. This requirement is justified by the administration as an effort to help students connect more closely with one another and sustain a sense of belonging within the Duke community. Thus, 85% of undergraduates live on campus. All freshmen are housed in one of 14 residences on East Campus. These buildings range in occupancy size from 50 (Epworth—the oldest residence hall, built in 1892 as [...] "the Inn") to 190 residents (Gilbert-Addoms). Most of these are in the Georgian style typical of the East Campus architecture. Although the newer residence halls differ in style, they still relate to East's Georgian heritage. Learning communities connect the residential component of East Campus with students of similar <b>academic</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> interests. Similarly, students in FOCUS, a first-year program that features courses clustered around a specific theme, live together in the same residence hall as other students in their cluster.|$|E
