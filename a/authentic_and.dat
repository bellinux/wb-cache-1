5|$|On 18 February 2016, the INR in Warsaw {{announced}} it had seized {{a package of}} original documents that allegedly proved Wałęsa was a paid Communist informant. The documents dated from the period 1970–1976; they were seized from {{the home of a}} recently deceased former interior minister, General Czesław Kiszczak. The documents' authenticity was confirmed by an archival expert, but the prosecutors demanded a handwriting examination. Eventually, the requested examination concluded that the documents were <b>authentic</b> <b>and,</b> hence, Wałęsa had collaborated with the communist secret police.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{have noted}} that Narayan's {{writings}} {{tend to be more}} descriptive and less analytical; the objective style, rooted in a detached spirit, providing for a more <b>authentic</b> <b>and</b> realistic narration.

A significant contributor to his writing style was his creation of Malgudi, a stereotypical small town, where the standard norms of superstition and tradition apply.|$|E

40|$|Authentic {{leadership}} {{occurs when}} individuals enact their true selves in {{their role as}} a leader. This article examines the role of authentic followership in the previously established relationship between <b>authentic</b> leadership <b>and</b> follower in-role and extrarole performance behaviors. Consideration of followers who enact their true selves {{is important to understand}} how authentic leadership fosters follower self-determined work motivation and thus work role performance. Using self-determination theory (SDT) as a guiding framework, the authors propose that authentic leadership, <b>authentic</b> followership, <b>and</b> their interplay are positively related to the satisfaction of followers’ basic needs, which, in turn, are positively related to follower work role performance. The authors conducted a survey study of 30 leaders and 252 followers in 25 Belgian service companies. The results provide evidence of positive relationship for both <b>authentic</b> leadership <b>and</b> <b>authentic</b> followership with follower basic need satisfaction in a crosslevel model where authentic leadership was aggregated to the group level of analysis. Crosslevel interaction results indicated that authentic leadership strengthened the relationship between <b>authentic</b> followership <b>and</b> follower basic need satisfaction. Follower basic need satisfaction was shown to mediate the relationship of <b>authentic</b> leadership <b>and</b> <b>authentic</b> followership with follower work role performance. A test of mediated moderation further demonstrated that basic need satisfaction mediates the interaction of <b>authentic</b> leadership <b>and</b> <b>authentic</b> followership on follower work role performance. The implications for leadership research and practice are explored. status: publishe...|$|R
5|$|Gary Cooper (born Frank James Cooper; May 7, 1901 – May 13, 1961) was an American film actor {{known for}} his natural, <b>authentic,</b> <b>and</b> {{understated}} acting style and screen performances. His career spanned thirty-five years, from 1925 to 1960, and included leading roles in eighty-four feature films. He was a major movie star {{from the end of}} the silent film era through to the end of the golden age of Classical Hollywood. His screen persona appealed strongly to both men and women, and his range of performances included roles in most major movie genres. Cooper's ability to project his own personality onto the characters he played contributed to his appearing natural and authentic on screen. The screen persona he sustained throughout his career represented the ideal American hero.|$|E
5|$|In early 1957, Tubb persuaded Hamilton {{to switch}} the {{magazine}} from pocket-book to digest size format, {{in the hope}} that this would improve the magazine's visibility on bookstalls. The circulation did indeed rise, to about 14,000 copies per month—a surprisingly low figure given Landsborough's assertion that Authentic had been selling 30,000 copies in the early days. However, later that year, Hamilton made the decision to invest a substantial sum in the UK paperback rights of an American best-seller: it is not known for certain which book this was, but it is thought to have been Evan Hunter's The Blackboard Jungle. Hamilton could no longer afford to have cash tied up in <b>Authentic,</b> <b>and</b> in the summer of 1957 Tubb was given two months to close down the magazine, printing stories that had already been paid for. The last issue was dated October 1957.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) [...] North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2011 The {{provision}} of <b>authentic</b> teaching <b>and</b> {{learning in the}} Mathematics classroom {{is one of the}} corner stones of the National Curriculum Statement (NCS). This study investigated to what extent teachers provide <b>authentic</b> teaching <b>and</b> learning in their Mathematics classrooms. A literature study was undertaken to explain <b>authentic</b> teaching <b>and</b> learning. The use of teaching methods and strategies, learning activities, assessment methods and strategies, {{and the role of the}} teacher and learner in the context of <b>authentic</b> teaching <b>and</b> learning in the classroom were explored. The literature review provided the conceptual framework for the study; as well as the framework for designing questionnaires and an observation schedule. The questionnaires were utilized to obtain the perceptions of teachers and learners regarding opportunities provided by teachers for the {{provision of}} <b>authentic</b> teaching <b>and</b> learning experiences in the Mathematics classroom, and the observation schedule determined how and to what extent the principles of <b>authentic</b> teaching <b>and</b> learning were translated into practice. Data was collected by means of quantitative, non-experimental descriptive survey research. The self-constructed questionnaires were administered to a convenient sample of a purposively selected group of Grade 4, Grade 5 and Grade 6 Intermediate Phase Mathematics teachers (n = 24) and learners (n = 440) in the Johannesburg South District of the Gauteng Department of Education. In addition to this, the classroom practices of six of the teachers who completed the questionnaire were observed over a period of six months. The triangulation of teacher and learner data revealed similarities and differences in opinion related to the opportunities that teachers create for <b>authentic</b> teaching <b>and</b> learning in the Mathematics classroom. In essence, the data revealed that teachers who took part in the study apparently understand the principles that underpin <b>authentic</b> teaching <b>and</b> learning, and to some extent comply with the principles of <b>authentic</b> teaching <b>and</b> learning in their classrooms. In addition to this, the triangulation of the teacher responses to the questionnaire and the observations of the classroom practices of the teachers indicated that in practice all the application of the principles of <b>authentic</b> teaching, learning <b>and</b> assessment have not yet fully become a reality in the Mathematics classroom. According to the learner responses, to the questionnaire, as well as the observations, it appeared that the application of teaching and assessment strategies that promote <b>authentic</b> teaching <b>and</b> learning are under-utilized by the teachers. This study is concluded with recommendations to teachers on how to create classroom climates that promote the provision of <b>authentic</b> teaching <b>and</b> learning in the Mathematics classroom.

5|$|Research for {{the film}} was done through {{available}} sources, such as online information and newspaper archives. Kom's videos {{played a key role}} in the research. The writer also had several telephone and email conversations with her regarding her biography. In her interactions with Quadras and Kumar, Kom was forthcoming when it came to the details of her life, and had significant input in the screenplay. However, Quadras revealed that his biggest challenge was to make the film <b>authentic</b> <b>and</b> cinematic yet not documentary-like, so he wrote the film in a manner that showed the struggles Kom went through as a female sportsperson who had to confront opposition from her father, politics and making a comeback after a long career break. The film only shows the period from her early struggles and her comeback after motherhood. Her fifth World Boxing Championship win and the London Olympics were left out because of the contract that permitted a depiction of Kom's life up to 2008. The contract {{for the film}} was signed at that time when Kom had not even qualified for the London Olympics.|$|E

40|$|Drawing on {{cognitive}} moral development and moral identity theories, this study empirically examines the moral antecedents <b>and</b> consequences of <b>authentic</b> leadership. Machiavellianism, an individual difference variable {{relating to the}} use of the ‘end justifies the means’ principle, is predicted to affect the link between morality and leadership. Analyses of multi-source, multi-method data comprised case studies, simulations, role-playing exercises, and survey questionnaires were completed by 70 managers in a large public agency, and provide support for our hypotheses. Our findings reveal that Machiavellianism offsets the positive relationship between moral reasoning <b>and</b> <b>authentic</b> leadership. Specifically, we show that when Machiavellianism is high, both the positive relationship between moral reasoning <b>and</b> <b>authentic</b> leadership, <b>and</b> the positive relationship between <b>authentic</b> leadership <b>and</b> moral actions, are reversed. This study offers new insights on the underlying processes contributing to the emergence of leaders’ <b>authentic</b> behavior <b>and</b> moral action.
