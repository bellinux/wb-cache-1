5|$|After {{having my}} own child, it's pretty amazing what females are capable of. We're Supergirl, {{we do it}} all: we give the love, we give the milk. On the other hand, I'm running a business. I'm running my career. That comes with being labeled a bitch. If that's what I'm gonna be called by being {{assertive}} and knowing who I am and what I want out of life, then so be it. I will wear that label proudly. For me it's <b>about</b> <b>turning</b> that word into a positive.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the more}} {{immediate}} ideas for redevelopment of the base was {{to turn it into}} a federal prison, something which had been done previously at the former Carswell AFB in Texas when the Federal Medical Center, Carswell was opened on its grounds. Many other former Air Force facilities have had prisons opened up on their grounds as well. From the outset, there was some reluctance in the town <b>about</b> <b>turning</b> it into creating a prison culture in Limestone, but this was lessened once the government decided that it did not want to build a federal prison on the grounds of the former air base.|$|E
5|$|Uncle Tom's Cabin first {{appeared}} as a 40-week serial in The National Era, an abolitionist periodical, starting with the June 5, 1851, issue. It was originally intended as a shorter narrative that would run {{for only a few}} weeks. Stowe expanded the story significantly, however, and it was instantly popular, such that several protests were sent to the Era office when she missed an issue. Because of the story's popularity, the publisher John P. Jewett contacted Stowe <b>about</b> <b>turning</b> the serial into a book. While Stowe questioned if anyone would read Uncle Tom's Cabin in book form, she eventually consented to the request.|$|E

5|$|As {{he makes}} his way further down the city, Foster {{eventually}} arrives in the abandoned subway tunnels. There he discovers that LINC has grown exponentially, {{to the point where he}} is now half-machine, half-organic entity. However, in order to function, LINC needs a human host to share its brain. The current host is Foster's biological father, who is old and has become severely worn out from his symbiosis with LINC. It is revealed that LINC sent for Foster because, with the death of its current host inevitable, it needed a replacement, and only a blood relative would do. Foster ultimately defeats LINC by plugging Joey (now calling himself Ken) into the mainframe. Joey/Ken is able to take control of the system, and he and Foster set <b>about</b> <b>turning</b> Union City into a utopia.|$|E

25|$|In many ways, Migrant Mother is {{not typical}} of Lange's careful method of {{interacting}} with her subject. Exhausted {{after a long}} road-trip, she did not talk much to the migrant woman, Florence Thompson, and didn't record her information accurately. Although Thompson became a famous symbol of White motherhood, her heritage is Native American. The photograph's fame caused distress for Thompson and her children and raised ethical concerns <b>about</b> <b>turning</b> individuals into symbols.|$|E

Horton {{was in the process of}} re-fitting the Ben Franklin (PX-15) in North Vancouver for oil exploration, and Ballard convinced him that their new battery would be a perfect fit. Horton agreed to provide several thousand dollars a month in funding. With this in place, Ballard purchased an abandoned motel in Arizona for $2,000 and set <b>about</b> <b>turning</b> it into a lab.|$|E
25|$|SuomenJoutsen {{served as}} a seamen's school for 27 years, during which time 3,709 {{students}} received their basic training on board the full rigged ship. In the 1980s, the facilities on board the school ship were becoming too small and increasingly obsolete, and there were talks about closing the school {{by the end of}} the decade. There was also discussion <b>about</b> <b>turning</b> SuomenJoutsen to a museum ship. The school closed its doors in 1988 and three years later SuomenJoutsen was handed over to the city of Turku.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time Barks had started {{thinking}} <b>about</b> <b>turning</b> a hobby that he always enjoyed into a profession: that of drawing. Since his early childhood he spent his free time by drawing on any material he could find. He had attempted to improve his style by copying the drawings of his favorite comic strip artists from the newspapers where he could find them. As he later said, he wanted to create his own facial expressions, figures and comical situations in his drawings but wanted to study the master comic artists' use of the pen and their use of color and shading.|$|E

25|$|Realizing a {{need for}} {{up-to-date}} textbooks on dental hygiene, Wilkins began writing and mimeographing handouts for her students. Over the years, the stack of papers accumulated, and soon Wilkins was approached by a textbook seller <b>about</b> <b>turning</b> her writing into a book. The first edition of Clinical Practice of the Dental Hygienist was published in 1960. The book has since become a cornerstone of text in dental hygiene programs. Wilkins released updated editions of the textbook through its 12th edition in 2016. The book has been translated into many languages, including Japanese, Italian, Korean, Portuguese, and Canadian French, and is used in dental hygiene schools around the world.|$|E

[...] In his inaugural address, which received almost uniformly positive reviews, Nixon remarked that [...] "the greatest honor history can bestow {{is the title}} of peacemaker"—a phrase that would later be placed on his gravestone. He spoke <b>about</b> <b>turning</b> partisan politics into a new age of unity: ...|$|E
500|$|Denning was demobilised on 6 February 1919, and {{returned}} to Magdalen College four days later. He initially thought <b>about</b> <b>turning</b> to applied mathematics, but decided on pure mathematics. He studied hard, not participating {{in any of the}} university's numerous societies or clubs so that he could better focus on his work, and graduated in 1920 with a first in Mathematical Greats. He was offered a job teaching mathematics at Winchester College for £350 a year, which he accepted. As well as mathematics, he taught geology, despite not having studied it; instead, he [...] "read up on [...] the night before". He found the job boring, and after viewing the Assize Court at Winchester Castle decided he would like to be a barrister.|$|E

500|$|Hensleigh {{found the}} {{rewriting}} process {{to be too}} difficult and dropped out, and felt he [...] "wasted nine months in pre-production". It took another eight months for France to convince Universal and the producers to let him try to write a script for a third time. France claimed [...] "Someone within the Universal hierarchy wasn't sure {{if this was a}} science fiction adventure, or a comedy, and I kept getting directions to write both. I think that at some point when I wasn't in the room, there may have been discussions <b>about</b> <b>turning</b> it into a Jim Carrey or Adam Sandler movie." [...] France was writing the script on fast track from July—September 1999. Filming for Hulk was to start in April 2000.|$|E
500|$|... "Fresh Blood" [...] {{featured}} the final guest appearance by Sterling K. Brown as the vampire hunter Gordon Walker. The character's story arc {{for the season}} {{was intended to be}} longer, but Brown's commitments to the Lifetime Television series Army Wives limited his return to only two appearances. The episode was [...] "really hard" [...] for the actor; though he was fine with the character dying, the idea of Gordon turning an innocent girl into a vampire was [...] "horrific" [...] to him. Although Gordon's actions in previous episodes were questionable, Brown had always believed the character to be [...] "ultimately good". On this change, Brown commented, [...] "His endgame is to kill Sam, and anyone else who has to experience detrimental effects because of that is not a concern of his. That was tough for me to process and get on board with." [...] However, series creator Eric Kripke reasoned that the character was now a monster and should follow his instincts instead of logic. The writer of [...] "Fresh Blood", Sera Gamble, also penned Gordon's initial episode and helped Kripke conceptualize the character. She felt that she [...] "lucked out" [...] in being able to write the character's final appearance, and found there to be [...] "something so satisfying <b>about</b> <b>turning</b> him into a vampire and chopping his head off with a razor wire".|$|E
2500|$|The {{cyclic control}} {{was found to}} be {{difficult}} to perfect, and led to Sikorsky locking the cyclic and adding two smaller vertical-axis lifting rotors to either side aft of the tailboom. By varying pitch of these rotors simultaneously, fore and aft control was provided. [...] Roll control was provided by differential pitching of the blades. [...] In this configuration, {{it was found that the}} VS-300 could not fly forward easily and Sikorsky joked <b>about</b> <b>turning</b> the pilot's seat around.|$|E

[...] In 1926, they replaced their tennis courts with an Italian garden and in 1929 they replaced their kitchen vegetable garden with a large rose garden {{to the design of}} Butler Sturtevant of Seattle. Samuel Maclure, who was consultant to the Butchart Gardens, reflected the aesthetic of the English Arts and Crafts Movement.|$|E

2500|$|Many found Scargill inspiring; {{many others}} found him frankly scary. He {{had been a}} Communist and {{retained}} strong Marxist views and a penchant for denouncing anyone who disagreed with him as a traitor.... Scargill had indeed been elected by a vast margin and he set <b>about</b> <b>turning</b> the NUM's once moderate executive into [...] reliably militant group..... By adopting a position that no pits should be closed on economic grounds, even if the coal was exhausted...he made sure confrontation would not be avoided. Exciting, witty Arthur Scargill brought coalmining to a close in Britain far faster than would have happened had the NUM been led by some prevaricating, dreary old-style union hack.|$|E
