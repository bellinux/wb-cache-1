25|$|Meanwhile, {{the second}} and third planes were setting up for their attack. Tatum drove one of them off with gunfire, but the other pilot {{continued}} on toward the ship until a hail of gunfire caused him to lose control of his aircraft. He banked sharply to the right, passed by Tatums port side, and splashed about 100yards astern. Within seconds, his cautious comrade renewed his attack. He dove on the fast transport, barely missing the port wing of her bridge, and Tatums antiaircraft fire followed him up <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>climbed,</b> did a wing-over, and prepared to come in again. His third and final attack carried him across the ship's fantail and into the water about 50feet from her starboard quarter.|$|E
25|$|From 1930 to 1975, the Great Falls High School {{building}} housed Paris Gibson Junior High School. The north entrance {{was closed}} in the 1940s after the front steps were discovered to be sinking. The driveway {{in front of this}} entrance was removed in the 1970s and replaced with sod. The south entrance was used as the main entrance after 1940. In the late 1960s, while repairs to the structure's roof were being made, a student broke into the building and climbed atop the elevator. He rode the elevator to the roof. But he touched a power line <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>climbed</b> off the elevator, giving him a severe electrical shock and causing his shirt to catch fire. He survived with minimal injuries. Another accident occurred shortly before the building was {{closed in the}} 1970s. A student in the gymnasium (which was housed in the brick annex), attempted to do chin-ups on a water pipe. The pipe snapped, causing the gym to be flooded.|$|E
25|$|On 25 April, Berthold lost a dogfight. He made an {{emergency}} landing after enemy bullets crippled his Fokker's engine. He took off again in Pfalz E.IV serial number 803/15. Its engine quit <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>climbed</b> to about 100 meters altitude, and he crashed. When his limp body was pulled from the wreckage, he was believed dead until he revived momentarily with a fit of cursing. After a passing faint, Berthold awoke to find himself blind. He begged bystanders to shoot him, then again swooned. He reawakened two days later in Kriegslazarett 7 (Military Hospital 7) in Saint Quentin, in a room next to a British observer he had downed. Besides a badly broken left leg, Berthold had suffered a broken nose and upper jaw, with attendant damage to his optic nerves. He was prescribed narcotic painkillers for chronic pain. At that time, German military doctors used three narcotics as remedies—opium, morphine, and codeine. Cocaine was used to counteract the somnolence of these three depressant drugs. Berthold's exact prescription is unknown.|$|E

25|$|The {{main event}} was an Elimination Chamber {{match for the}} World Heavyweight Championship between Rob Van Dam, Kane, Triple H, Chris Jericho, Booker T, and Shawn Michaels. The match started off with Triple H, the second entrant, facing off against Rob Van Dam, the first entrant, while the {{remaining}} four superstars were locked in the four chambers. Superstars entered the match at five-minute intervals. Rob Van Dam dominated much of the beginning. At one point Van Dam gave Chris Jericho the middle finger <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>climbed</b> up the latter's pod. Jericho grabbed Van Dam's foot through the pod's mesh roof. However, Van Dam fought both him and Triple H. The next entrant was the aforementioned Chris Jericho, who upon entering teamed with Triple H in taking down Van Dam. The fourth entrant, Booker T, then made {{his way into the}} match. Rob Van Dam delivered a Five Star Frog Splash onto Triple H of the top of a pod, but he botched it and damaged the latter's esophagus. Booker T would capitalize on this and delivered a Missile Dropkick to Rob Van Dam to eliminate him from the match. However, Booker T would be the next elimination after Jericho pinned him following a Lionsault. The fifth entrant, Kane, dominated upon his entry into the match. The sixth entrant, Shawn Miachels, experienced brief control only to be chokeslamed by Kane. However, Kane would be the third elimination after receiving a Superkick from Michaels, a Pedigree from Triple H, and finally a Lionsault from Jericho. Jericho would be the next elimination after Michaels pinned him following Sweet Chin Music. The final elimination was made when Michaels delivered Sweet Chin Music to Triple H and pinned him, thus winning the match and the World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E
500|$|On 14 September 1718, Rogers {{received}} word that Vane was at Green Turtle Cay near Abaco, about [...] north of Nassau. Some of the pardoned pirates on New Providence took boats to join Vane, and Rogers {{decided to send}} two ex-pirate captains, Benjamin Hornigold and John Cockram, with a crew to gather intelligence, and, if possible, to bring Vane to battle. As the weeks passed, and hopes of their return dimmed, Rogers declared martial law and set all inhabitants to work on rebuilding the island's fortifications. Finally, the former pirates returned. They had failed to find an opportunity to kill Vane or bring him to battle, but had captured one ship {{and a number of}} pirate captives. Captain Hornigold was then sent to recapture the ships and crews who had gone pirate en route to Havana. He returned with ten prisoners, including captain John Auger, and three corpses. [...] On 9 December 1718, Rogers brought the ten men captured by Hornigold to trial. Nine were convicted, and Rogers had eight hanged three days later, reprieving the ninth on hearing he was of good family. One of the condemned, Thomas Morris, quipped <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>climbed</b> the gallows, [...] "We have a good governor, but a harsh one." [...] The executions so cowed the populace that when, shortly after Christmas, several residents plotted to overthrow Rogers and restore the island to piracy, the conspirators attracted little support. Rogers had them flogged, then released as harmless.|$|E

2500|$|When Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev {{declared}} a unilateral {{moratorium on the}} testing of nuclear weapons, which would begin on August 6, 1985—the 40thanniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima—the Reagan administration dismissed the dramatic move {{as nothing more than}} propaganda, and refused to follow suit. In response, US anti-nuclear and peace activists staged a series of protest actions at the Nevada Test Site, beginning on Easter Sunday in 1986 and continuing through 1987. Hundreds of people in the [...] "Nevada Desert Experience" [...] group were arrested, including Sagan, who was arrested on two separate occasions <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>climbed</b> over a chain-link fence at the test site during the underground Operation Charioteer and United States's Musketeer nuclear test series of detonations.|$|E
2500|$|According to Carrington, {{his orders}} were clear. [...] "Under no circumstances" [...] was the relief party to [...] "pursue over the ridge, that is Lodge Trail Ridge". Lt.

She said these orders were given twice, {{the second time}} by Carrington from the sentry walk after ordering the soldiers to halt {{as they left the}} front gate of the fort. Francis Grummond wrote that everyone present could hear the orders. On leaving the fort, however, Fetterman took the Lodge Ridge Trail northward rather than the trail northwest toward the pinery where the wagon train was. Carrington assumed that Fetterman intended to approach the Indians attacking the wood train from their rear. Within a short time, the signal came that the wood train was no longer under attack. About 50 Indians appeared near Fort Kearny, but Carrington dispersed them with a few cannon shots.

2500|$|The third {{match was}} a Taped Fist match between Diamond Dallas Page and Jim Duggan for Page's [...] "Lord of the Ring" [...] ring.

Back in the ring, Page countered a suplex attempt into a bulldog. Page climbed the turnbuckles but Duggan hit the top rope, causing Page to fall onto the top turnbuckle. After knocking Page's head repeatedly on the top turnbuckle, Duggan performed a clothesline, sending Page to the outside. Duggan then sent Page back in the ring. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>climbed</b> through the ropes, Page kicked the middle rope, which hit Duggan's groin.

2500|$|According to Le Petit Parisien, Reichelt's initial {{attempt to}} ascend {{to the first}} stage of the tower was blocked by a guard, M. Gassion, who had {{witnessed}} previous unsuccessful dummy drops and feared that Reichelt's attempt would end in disaster, though Le Figaro reported that he had merely not received a copy of the order and had to wait for telephone confirmation from his superiors. Despite the guard's resistance, by 8:00a.m. the matter had been resolved: Reichelt, who was visibly shaken by his argument with the guard, was allowed to mount the tower with his two friends and a cinematographer (another was stationed near the foot of the tower to record the jump from below). <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>climbed</b> the stairs he paused, turned back to the crowd, raised his hand and wished them a cheery [...] "". (See you soon). His friends continued to try {{to talk him out of}} the jump, but Reichelt was quite determined. At 8:22a.m., observed by a crowd of about 30 journalists and curious onlookers, he readied himself – facing towards the Seine – on a stool placed on a restaurant table next to the interior guardrail of the tower's first deck, a little more than [...] above the ground. After adjusting his apparatus with the assistance of his friends and checking the wind direction by throwing a piece of paper taken from a small book, he placed one foot on the guardrail, hesitated for about 40 seconds, then leapt outwards. According to Le Figaro, he was calm and smiling just before he jumped. His parachute, which had seemed to be only half-open, folded around him almost immediately and he plummeted for a few seconds before crashing into the frozen soil at the foot of the tower.|$|E
