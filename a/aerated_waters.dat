25|$|Presented as W Smith's Chemist and JR & D Edis Photographers, a two-storey {{building}} housing both {{a chemist}} and photographers shops {{under one roof}} opened on 7 May 2016 and represents {{the growing popularity of}} photography in the era, with shops often growing out of or alongside chemists, who had the necessary supplies for developing photographs. The chemist features a dispensary, and equipment from various shops including John Walker, inventor of the friction match. The photographers features a studio, where visitors can dress in period costume and have a photograph taken. The corner building is based on a real building on Elvet Bridge in Durham City, opposite the Durham Marriot Hotel (the Royal County), although the second storey {{is not part of the}} display. The chemist also sells aerated water (an early form of carbonated soft drinks) to visitors, sold in marble-stopper sealed Codd bottles (although made to a modern design to prevent the safety issue that saw the original bottles banned). <b>Aerated</b> <b>waters</b> grew in popularity in the era, due to the need for a safe alternative to water, and the temperance movement - being sold in chemists due to the perception they were healthy in the same way mineral waters were.|$|E
2500|$|The western river dory, though sharing {{features}} {{with sea}} dories, is adapted {{for a different}} place and purpose. [...] The key differentiating features are wider beam, more flare to prevent waves coming on board, and extensive built-in buoyancy/storage areas with water-resistant hatches to shed water and keep the boat afloat {{in the event of}} a capsize. [...] The first small flat bottomed dory run of note on the Colorado River was made by Ramon Montez and George Flavell on a 1896 river cruise from Green River, Wyoming, through the Grand Canyon to Temple Bar, Arizona. Western river dories have additional special features such as strong rowlocks, long oars, and long blade oars to operate in the highly <b>aerated</b> <b>waters</b> in rapids. In rapids the master rower faces down river to see the rock and or hydraulic obstacles. In a rapid the oars are often used to steer the boat as well as to propel it. The first documentation of this [...] "stern first" [...] technique in Grand Canyon was by George Flavell in 1896. Credit for the [...] "stern first" [...] technique is often given to Nathaniel Galloway who used it on his cruise through Grand Canyon a few months after the Flavell-Montez cruise.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the oxygen transfer characteristics of an ejector aeration system. In order to evaluate the oxygen transfer performance of the ejector aeration system, a comparative experiment was conducted on a conventional blower aeration system. The effect of entrained air flow rate and <b>aerating</b> <b>water</b> temperature on the oxygen transfer efficiency was investigated. The dissolved oxygen concentration increased with increasing entrained air flow rate, but decreased with increasing <b>aerating</b> <b>water</b> temperature for two aeration systems. The volumetric mass transfer coefficient increased with increasing entrained air flow rate and with increasing <b>aerating</b> <b>water</b> temperature for both aeration systems. The average mass transfer coefficient for the ejector aeration system was about 20 % and 42 % higher than that of the blower aeration system within the experimental range of entrained air flow rates and <b>aerating</b> <b>water</b> temperatures...|$|R

"A {{good many}} fellows have <b>aerated</b> <b>waters</b> sent up, but hot soda water {{is by no}} means a {{desirable}} drink--not to be compared with tea kept in porous jars; so I should not advise you to bother about it. You will want a water bottle. Get the largest you can find. It is astonishing how much water a fellow can get down, in a long day's march.|$|E
60|$|But the {{exceeding}} {{freshness of}} his feeling for Paula, which {{by reason of}} its long arrest {{was that of a}} man far under thirty, and was a wonder to himself every instant, would not long brook weighing in balances. He wished suddenly to commit himself; to remove the question of retreat out of the region of debate. The clock struck two: and the wish became determination. He arose, and wrapping himself in his dressing-gown went to the next room, where he took from a shelf in the pantry several large bottles, which he carried to the window, till they stood on the sill a goodly row. There had been sufficient light in the room for him to do this without a candle. Now he softly opened the sash, and the radiance of a gibbous moon riding in the opposite sky flooded the apartment. It fell on the labels of the captain's bottles, revealing their contents to be simple <b>aerated</b> <b>waters</b> for drinking.|$|E
60|$|The {{life of the}} ship, {{like the}} life of the sea, was a sodden monotony, with certain events which were part of the monotony. In the morning the little steward's bugle called the {{passengers}} from their dreams, and half an hour later called them to their breakfast, after such as chose had been served with coffee by their bedroom-stewards. Then they went on deck, where they read, or dozed in their chairs, or walked up and down, or stood in the way of those who were walking; or played shuffleboard and ring-toss; or smoked, and drank whiskey and <b>aerated</b> <b>waters</b> over their cards and papers in the smoking-room; or wrote letters in the saloon or the music-room. At eleven o'clock they spoiled their appetites for lunch with tea or bouillon to the music of a band of second-cabin stewards; at one, a single blast of the bugle called them to lunch, where they glutted themselves to the torpor from which they afterwards drowsed in their berths or chairs. They did the same things in the afternoon that they had done in the forenoon; and at four o'clock the deck-stewards came round with their cups and saucers, and their plates of sandwiches, again to the music of the band. There were two bugle-calls for dinner, and after dinner some went early to bed, and some sat up late and had grills and toast. At twelve the lights were put out in the saloons and the smoking-rooms.|$|E

6000|$|My {{forthcoming}} work in five volumes, [...] "The Neglect of Cheese in European Literature" [...] {{is a work}} of such unprecedented and laborious {{detail that}} it is doubtful if I shall live to finish it. Some overflowings from such a fountain of information may therefore be permitted to springle these pages. I cannot yet wholly explain the neglect to which I refer. Poets have been mysteriously silent on the subject of cheese. Virgil, if I remember right, refers to it several times, but with too much Roman restraint. He does not let himself go on cheese. The only other poet I can think of just now who seems to have had some sensibility on the point was the nameless author of the nursery rhyme which says: [...] "If all the trees were bread and cheese"--which is, indeed a rich and gigantic vision of the higher gluttony. If all the trees were bread and cheese there would be considerable deforestation in any part of England where I was living. Wild and wide woodlands would reel and fade before me as rapidly as they ran after Orpheus. Except Virgil and this anonymous rhymer, I can recall no verse about cheese. Yet it has every quality which we require in exalted poetry. It is a short, strong word; it rhymes to [...] "breeze" [...] and [...] "seas" [...] (an essential point); that it is emphatic in sound is admitted even by the civilization of the modern cities. For their citizens, with no apparent intention except emphasis, will often say, [...] "Cheese it!" [...] or even [...] "Quite the cheese." [...] The substance itself is imaginative. It is ancient--sometimes in the individual case, always in the type and custom. It is simple, being directly derived from milk, {{which is one of the}} ancestral drinks, not lightly to be corrupted with soda-water. You know, I hope (though I myself have only just thought of it), that the four rivers of Eden were milk, water, wine, and ale. <b>Aerated</b> <b>waters</b> only appeared after the Fall.|$|E
