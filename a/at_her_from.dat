Prudente had not realized that Dominca was a warship and approached. As {{soon as she}} realized her mistake, she attempted to escape. The wind being calm, Peter send Midshipman Jackson and eight volunteers in a boat to capture Prudente, while shooting grape and canister <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>from</b> Dominica.

500|$|To {{one side}} of the Gardens is the bizarre grotto {{designed}} by Bernardo Buontalenti. The lower façade was begun by Vasari [...] but the architecture of the upper storey is subverted by [...] "dripping" [...] pumice stalactites with the Medici coat of arms at the centre. The interior is similarly poised between architecture and nature; the first chamber has copies of Michelangelo's four unfinished slaves emerging from the corners which seem to carry the vault with an open oculus at its centre and painted as a rustic bower with animals, figures and vegetation. Figures, animals and trees made of stucco and rough pumice adorn the lower walls. A short passage leads to a small second chamber and to a third which has a central fountain with Giambologna's Venus in the centre of the basin, peering fearfully over her shoulder at the four satyrs spitting jets of water <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>from</b> the edge.|$|E
500|$|The video, which Beyoncé has {{considered}} intimate and romantic, begins as she stands against a wall, illuminated by light that {{passes through a}} window. In one scene, Beyoncé's character, dressed in a skin-tight leotard, performs a dance sequence while her love interest looks down <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>from</b> a balcony. According to Michael Slezak of Entertainment Weekly, the dance routines pay homage to the 1983 romantic drama film Flashdance. Beyoncé and Ealy later stare adoringly {{at each other as}} they snuggle on a sofa. During the climax of the video, Beyoncé is shown underwater, dressed in white, moving slowly upwards. As the chorus begins, she opens her eyes; after Ealy kisses the back of her neck, the pair come face to face in the final scene, in which Beyoncé lies in bed, with Ealy above her. Jennifer Cady of E! Online wrote that the bright shiny lights in the video [...] "make [...] look like an angel". Alison Maloney of The Sun praised Beyoncé's [...] "amazing figure".

500|$|The autobiographical {{story begins}} as a brunette Gaga is taken through a clinic on a stretcher, while an inner {{monologue}} about her past memories is heard. The nurses wear Calvin Klein Collection uniforms and Giuseppe Zanotti shoes. A nurse awakens Gaga and checks her heart rate and blood pressure. The nurse then tells Gaga how beautiful she is and how she looked just like her mother when she delivered the former. Gaga then claims {{that her mother was}} a saint, before taking a cigarette out of her bag. The nurse, startled by this, quickly then takes the cigarette out of her mouth and puts it on a table. Gaga cries and tells the nurse that she will become a star. She asks the nurse to play music and the camera zooms out to show viewers several female patients treated and wandering off. A new scene shows Gaga practicing ballet dancing to piano music, and a following one shows her taken back from the hospital to her New York apartment by her best friend Bo. Ludwig van Beethoven's [...] "Piano Sonata No. 8" [...] plays. Gaga is undressed from an outfit designed by Stéphane Rolland and taken to bed, but is interrupted by a phone call that notifies her of being dropped from her record label. Frustrated, she makes a mess in her apartment, pours breakfast cereal on herself, and jumps in the bath with her heels on. The piano music ends and Gaga is seen bleaching her hair, bathing in a tub, and humming [...] "Marry the Night". The monologue continues as Gaga says, [...] "But I still had my bedazzler and I had a lot of patches, shiny ones from M Trimmings, so I wreaked havoc on some old denim. And I did what any girl would do—I did it all over again." [...] According to Jocelyn Vena of MTV News, Gaga resembles pop artist Madonna in the film Desperately Seeking Susan. Gaga's dancers look down <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>from</b> a mezzanine as the clock chimes.|$|E

2500|$|According to {{much later}} accounts, in October 1837 a girl {{by the name}} of Mary Stevens was walking to Lavender Hill, where she was working as a servant, after visiting her parents in Battersea. On her way through Clapham Common, a strange figure leapt <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>from</b> a dark alley.

2500|$|Star Sapphire {{appears in}} episodes of Justice League, voiced by Olivia d'Abo in her natural English accent. She {{receives}} her {{power from the}} stone in her mask which gives her Green Lantern-like abilities that enable her to form shields, create energy constructs, fire power blasts and create a full-body field that enables her to fly and travel through deep space. While her origins are never elaborated upon of which version she's based on, the show's creators have confirmed she {{is intended to be}} Carol Ferris. In the episode [...] "Injustice For All", Star Sapphire is invited to join Lex Luthor's Injustice Gang to plot the destruction of the Justice League. She is initially repelled by the idea of working with [...] "common criminals" [...] but seems to warm to {{the amount of money that}} Luthor promises each of them (which also keeps her from quitting after their initial plan fails). In the Injustice Gang's final battle with the Justice League, she is defeated by Green Lantern. In the episode [...] "Fury", Star Sapphire is later recruited to the Injustice Gang's second incarnation led by Aresia to destroy the men of the world. When Aresia reveals the group's agenda, she is initially shocked, but ultimately joins enthusiastically. [...] While aligned with this Injustice Gang, she successfully tricks Wonder Woman and Hawkgirl into believing that she still wants to live in a world with men by luring the two women into a trap that subdues both them and Hippolyta. Later on, she and Aresia, along with Tsukuri, flee with Hippolyta aboard Aresia's plane. Wonder Woman and Hawkgirl pursue them and she is knocked out of the fight when Wonder Woman wrenches one of the plane's laser cannons free from its housing and hurls it <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>from</b> behind which plunges her into the sea. In the episode [...] "Hereafter", Star Sapphire is among the several supervillains from the mayhem that reigns in Metropolis shortly after Superman's supposed death at the hands of a group of supervillains but is again defeated by Green Lantern.|$|E

2500|$|The show {{continued}} {{with a short}} medley performed by her backup singers, The Mamas, followed by another video interlude featuring a coin toss between Knowles' emotional side and Sasha Fierce. Knowles then appeared from under the stage after the lights were turned off several times and several dance routines were performed by her dancers. Then a man banged a gong and Knowles appeared on the stage. She was then lifted out of a 20-foot train by a harness and over the audience she performed [...] "Baby Boy" [...] while she high-stepped in slow motion and front-flipped. She was then lowered to the B-stage where she finished the song and {{continued with}} Dawn Penn's [...] "You Don't Love Me (No, No, No)". A stripped-down version of [...] "Irreplaceable" [...] was sung afterwards and the crowd was asked to sing along the lines [...] "to the left, to the left".

Performances of [...] "Upgrade U" [...] and [...] "Video Phone" [...] followed; Knowles was accompanied by two female dancers and three male dancers, one of whom recorded a live stream of her with a camera throughout the routine during {{the performance of the}} latter song. This was followed by a rendition of [...] "Say My Name" [...] where she interacted with one member of the audience, asking that person what his or her name and then asking from them to say her name. As the song ended {{she went back to the}} main stage. In the penultimate section of the show, Knowles appeared in the middle of the stage wearing a gown with lights <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>from</b> all around the arena as she sang [...] "At Last". A footage of her performance of the song at Barack Obama's inauguration as President of the United States, video images of civil rights era footage and snippets from her performance of the song in the movie, Cadillac Records (2008) were shown on the screens behind here. The power ballad [...] "Listen" [...] was performed afterwards.

Knowles then sang the song while performing the Bob Fosse-inspired choreography. For the finale, she performed an extended version of [...] "Halo" [...] descending from the stage and shaking hands with the fans in the front rows. She then went to the top of the staircase and repeatedly said [...] "I am", awaiting the crowd to say it back.
