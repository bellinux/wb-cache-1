When current market shares matter for future demand, cost-based dumping can be profitable. Dumping thus arises as a form of investment in market shares. This might trigger the application of <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>law.</b> We further show that correctly anticipated duties do not necessarily hinder firms from selling below costs. The mere existence of <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>law,</b> however, significantly changes the structure of the game, leading to higher first-period prices for both firms. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} how {{anti-dumping}} legislation was implemented in Canada {{and in the}} European Communities. This comparison of Canadian and EC <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>law</b> aims at examining how the Anti-Dumping Code was transposed and applied in each jurisdiction by looking at each step of an anti-dumping investigation, starting with the initiation of an investigation, the calculation of the normal value and of the export price, {{the determination of the}} dumping margin, the finding of injury, and ending with other related matters such as anti-absorption and anti-circumvention rules. Having looked at Canadian and EC <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>law</b> as such, this paper examines the compatibility of anti-dumping actions with the creation of free trade areas and the effect of anti-dumping duties on such free trade areas. It looks specifically at the EC and the NAFTA examples. Both the NAFTA and the EC treaty create, generally speaking, a free trade area, however the approach taken vis-a-vis anti-dumping duties within the free trade area is different in each case: while the EC abolished anti-dumping duties within the free trade area, these duties are maintained under the NAFTA regime...|$|E

Also, the Byrd amendment makes it less likely that the anti-dumping duty will be prohibitive. Anti dumping; Research; Law; Firms; Domestic; Dumping; Welfare; Industry;...|$|E

To understand why these economies have increasingly applied <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>laws,</b> we build a simple theoretical model of vertical intra-industry trade and investigate the strategic incentives of exporting firms to undertake dumping. We show that the definition of dumping matters. Based on a comparison of low-quality and high-quality prices, only unilateral dumping by the low-quality firm obtains. By contrast, the standard WTO definition leads to either reciprocal or unilateral dumping by the high-quality firm, depending on cross-country differences in incomes, the height of tariff protection and on exchange rate changes.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the current trends {{of the application}} of anti-dumping measures by their most frequent users. Thus, it illustrates {{that in the last}} couple of decades, several developing countries including Mexico, have become the most frequent anti-dumping measures users in the world. In particular, it exposes Mexicos relevant AD facts and trends; and asserts that some empirical studies suggest that Mexicos AD measures pursue political purposes other than remedying unfair trade practices. In order to conduct a WTO compatibility assessment of the Mexican anti-dumping system, this thesis lays down, first, the WTO anti-dumping agreement or ADA, and the jurisprudence interpreting the rules and principles disciplining the activities of the WTO Members concerning anti-dumping measures. Subsequently, this thesis comprises a review of the entirety of the anti-dumping-related provisions contained in Mexicos Foreign Trade Act or FTA and its regulations, i. e. the Regulations of the Foreign Trade Act or RFTA; as well as of the body of interpretative criteria issued by the Mexican Ministry of Economy to further specify the provisions of the FTA and its regulations. Furthermore, this thesis completes the analysis of Mexicos laws and interpretative criteria on anti-dumping with information on the actual behavior of the investigating authorities, gathered through interviews with former officials of the Mexican investigating authority. The core section of this thesis contains the compatibility assessment between Mexicos <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>laws</b> and practices and the WTO law. This section builds upon the previous three parts as it engages directly with the process of contrasting Mexicos rules and practice on anti-dumping against the ADA. Thus, this part of the thesis searches and exposes those areas where the FTA and the ADA regimes converge and diverge creating potential synergies or friction. Finally, this thesis contains a set of general conclusions that aims at servings as a list of lessons obtained from Mexicos experience using anti-dumping remedies. These conclusions reflect the manner in which Mexico has chosen to design and apply its <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>laws.</b> In that sense, these conclusions may provide valuable lessons for developing countries other than Mexico, especially those that may face similar constraints and challenges when implementing and enforcing their own anti-dumping mechanisms.

Other researchers have explored the global (WTO Agreement) and the European Union’s (EU) <b>Anti-Dumping</b> <b>law</b> mostly with a commercial perspective. At doctoral level EU-China, EU-Japan and EU-Korea trade relations with reference to the application of protective measures have been studied. This dissertation is, however, the very first aimed to examine the application of EU <b>Anti-Dumping</b> <b>law</b> relating to Pakistan. This is a complete health check of EU-Pakistan trade relations with reference to the application of Anti-dumping duties on Pakistan. This study is a combination of doctrinal research and empirical research, whereby it critically evaluates the Commission’s investigation and the judgements of the EU Courts related to Pakistan and thus establish their consistency or inconsistency; it also studies the voting patterns within the Council and the impact of AD duties on Pakistani imports. It is a qualitative exploratory study based upon an inductive approach. Contradictions are found in the calculations of normal value and export price, constructed normal value, the comparison of normal value and export price, the calculation of dumping margin, and the calculation of injury. Suggestions are made as {{to the extent to which}} Unions’ anti-dumping rules need to be reviewed to moderate their tilt that unequivocally favours Union manufacturers. Moreover, this dissertation identifies many provisions of the basic regulation, which being too vague offers multiple interpretations, which are thus recommended to be amended. In the empirical part of this research the voting style of EU member states for or against the adoption of AD measures against Pakistan has been studied. Thereafter, the content analysis of stated reasons for specific voting styles reveals that the member states vote on the basis of the findings and conclusions of investigation as done by the Commission, thus trade partner loyalty is not the reason for their voting. Furthermore, application of the ADDs is found to be reason of import decline from Pakistan to the EU...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (PhD. (Law) North-Wets University, Mafikeng Campus, 2011 This thesis {{addresses}} {{issues of}} <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>law</b> and practice from a critical and juridical analysis position. In particular, the thesis seeks {{to determine whether}} the South African anti-dumping regime is compliant with the anti-dumping regime of the World Trade Organization (hereafter WTO), and to consider possible solutions for addressing instances where the South African law is not WTO compatible. The thesis departs from the hypothesis that the WTO merely requires functional equivalence of the implementation of national legislation on anti-dumping, and not the verbatim adoption of WTO jurisprudence and relevant provisions of the Agreement on the Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade of 1994 (hereafter URAA), into the legislation of State Parties. Some of the provisions of the URAA are not completely clear, and are cast in convoluted and complicated technical jargon, leaving loopholes that may be justifiably exploited by State Parties. The study in this thesis was achieved through the critical analysis of legislation and relevant legal documents, case law and contemporary literature. The primary research paradigm used in this study is interpretive and analytical, which is the same as qualitative research methodology. The legal comparative research method, with a historical component, also {{played an important role in}} this study. The literature study undertaken and the critical analyses made of the South African anti-dumping regime show mixed findings. The South African antidumping regime was found to have both positive aspects and problematic aspects when compared with WTO regulations. Some of the critical areas of the South African anti-dumping regime are WTO compatible whilst others are not. In some areas the South African anti-dumping regime has adopted functionally equivalent provisions to the provisions of the WTO law. However, the practice of the International Trade Administration Commission (ITAC) is sometimes fraught with inconsistencies. The compatibility of the South African anti-dumping system with the WTO regime came close to being examined by the WTO on 1 April 1999 in the dispute of South Africa - Anti-dumping Duties on the Import of Certain Pharmaceutical Products from India based on allegations that the method for calculating normal value used by the ITAC was found to be inconsistent with the URAA. Similarly, the conformity of the procedures and findings of the International Trade and Administration Act (ITAA) in anti-dumping cases came under attack in the cases of Algorax v The International Trade Administration Commission and others, and Scaw v The International Trade Administration Commission and others, respectively. Finally, the thesis ends with recommendations in response to the challenges identified and key submissions made throughout the analysis. Key recommendations include the broadening of the concept of interested parties to include registered trade unions and trade union federations; introducing an explicit and mandatory "public Interests" provision to ensure that South Africa's anti-dumping administration is free from political trappings in the form of the involvement of the Minister of Trade and Industry; introducing the new section 31 bis of the ADR in order to allow the initiation of anti-dumping petitions by a registered trade union or trade union federation; providing procedural guidelines for self-initiation of anti-dumping petitions by the ITAC; increasing transparency in anti-dumping proceedings and enquires; setting realistic time-lines for all anti-dumping processes and ensuring compliance with the same; improving the institutional and functional capacity of the ITAC; amending section 18. 3 of the ADR to allow search and seizure operations pursuant to the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act 51 of 1977 and the Customs Act; having a clear provision on verification visits confidentiality and a clear provision on producer knowledge; introducing a clear provision in the ADR dealing explicitly with zeroing pursuant to Article 2. 4. 3 (ii) of URAA; and the introduction of duty refund procedures. It is hoped that the recommendations made in this thesis, which are in the form of suggested legislative interventions required to upgrade certain areas of South African <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>law</b> and practice to be fully WTO compliant, will influence the introduction of suitably crafted anti-dumping legislation in South Africa. It is further hoped that the thesis will become an invaluable source of information for practitioners and students, and a critical source on the best practice for the imposition and implementation of anti-dumping measures. Moreover, the thesis will add to the body of academic writing on South African <b>anti-dumping</b> <b>law.</b> Doctora...|$|E
