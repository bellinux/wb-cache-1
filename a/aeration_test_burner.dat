40|$|The {{objective}} of this investigation is to characterize the operation of fan powered infrared (PIR) burner at various barometric pressures (operating altitude) and gas compositions and develop design guidelines for appliances containing PIR burners for satisfactory performance. In this program, the theoretical basis for the behavior of PIR burners will be established through analysis of the combustion, heat and mass transfer, and other related processes that determine the performance of PIR burners. Based {{on the results of}} this study, a burner performance model for radiant output will be developed. The model will be applied to predict the performance of the selected burner and will also be modified and improved through comparison with experimental results.

40|$|Abstract. A new burner {{configuration}} for {{a compact}} fuel-cell reformer with a high-temperature air combustion concept was studied. The burner was computationally {{designed for a}} 40 Nm 3 /hr hydrogen-generating reformer using natural gas-steam reforming method. In order to satisfy the primary requirements for designing a reformer burner (uniform distribution of temperature along the fuel processor walls and minimum heat losses from the reformer), {{the features of the}} present burner configuration included 1) a self-regenerative burner for an exhaust-gas-recirculation to apply for the high-temperature air combustion concept, and 2) an annular-type shield for protecting direct contact of flame with the processor walls. For the present design conditions, the predicted temperature distributions along the processor walls were found uniform within 100 K variation. Thus, the present burner configuration satisfied the requirement for reducing temperature gradients along the processor walls, and consequently demonstrated that the high-temperature air combustion concept could be applied to the practical fuel reformers for use of fuel cells. The predicted uniform temperature distributions along the processor walls were experimentally demonstrated for a <b>test</b> <b>burner...</b>|$|R

40|$|Recently, roofed {{landfills}} {{have been}} gaining popularity in Japan. Roofed landfills have several advantages over non-roofed landfills such as eliminating {{the visibility of}} waste and reducing the spread of offensive odours. This study examined the moisture balance and aeration conditions, which promote waste stabilisation, in a roofed landfill that included organic waste such as food waste. Moisture balance was estimated using waste characterization and {{the total amount of}} landfilled waste. Internal conditions were estimated based on the composition, flux, and temperature of the landfill gas. Finally, in situ aeration was performed to determine the integrity of the semi-aerobic structure of the landfill. With the effects of rainfall excluded, only 15 % of the moisture held by the waste was discharged as leachate. The majority of the moisture remained in the waste layer, but was less than the optimal moisture level for biodegradation, indicating that an appropriate water spray should be administered. To assess waste degradation in this semi-aerobic landfill, the concentration and flow rate of landfill gas were measured and an in situ <b>aeration</b> <b>test</b> was performed.

40|$|This paper reports proper {{orthogonal}} decomposition (POD) {{analyses for}} the velocity fields measured in a <b>test</b> <b>burner.</b> The Cambridge/Sandia Stratified Swirl Burner {{has been used}} in various studies as a benchmark for high resolution scalar and velocity measurements, for comparison with numerical model prediction. Flow field data was collected for a series of bluff-body stabilized premixed and stratified methane/air flames at turbulent, globally lean conditions (phi = 0. 75) using high speed stereoscopic particle image velocimetry (HS-SPIV). In this paper, a modal analysis was performed to identify the large scale flow structures and their impact on the flame dynamics. The high speed PIV system was operated at 3 kHz to acquire a series of 4096 sequential flow field images both for reactive and non-reactive cases, sufficient to follow the large-scale spatial and temporal evolution of flame and flow dynamics. The POD analysis allows identification of vortical structures, created by the bluff body, and in the shear layers surrounding the stabilization point. In addition, the analysis reveals that dominant structures are a strong function of the mixture stratification in the flow field. The dominant energetic modes of reactive and non-reactive flows are very different, as the expansion of gases and the high temperatures alter the unstable modes and their survival in the flow...|$|R

Although livestock wastewater is readily biodegradable in general, its variety in biodegradability can still be significant in practice. In addition, it is a common practice to periodically use disinfectants in livestock activities for health concerns. Obviously, the residual of the disinfectants in livestock wastewater may have serious inhibitory effect on the microbial activities during wastewater treatment. Thus, the main objective {{of this study was to}} examine the variety of livestock wastewater in biodegradability and its effect on the performance of a pilot scale tidal flow CWs (TFCWs) in organic matter and nitrogen removal.

The aerator prototype which has been developed is acrylic aerator tube with diameter of 240 mm and thickness of 5 mm. The tube was made 1 m long to provide with a sufficient space for indigo foam. Its bottom part is completed with spiral air hose having five small holes of 0. 2, 0. 4, and 0. 6 mm diameter uniformly located along the height of solution in the tube.

40|$|In this article, we {{describe}} {{the development of a}} simple laboratory test for the effective screening of foam control agents on a selected fermentation system, the mass production of Yarrowia lipolytica. <b>Aeration</b> <b>testing</b> is based on sparging air in the foaming medium allowing partial reproduction of the gas-liquid hydrodynamic encountered in bioreactors. "Dynamic sparge test," for which measurements are made during foam formation, was used to compare the capacity of three antifoams, based on different technologies, to control the foam produced in the fermentation broth. The selected foam control agents were: (1) an organic antifoam (TEGO AFKS 911), (2) a silicone-based emulsion containing in situ treated silica (DC- 1520) and (3) a silicone/ organic blend silica-free formulation. The testing results demonstrated dramatic differences among them and showed that the capacity of TEGO AFKS 911 and DC- 1520 to control the foam generated in the fermentation broth decreases as a function of fermentation time. This occurred to a much lesser extent for the silicone/ organic blend formulation. These results were correlated with the change of the foam nature and the increase of foam stability of the fermentation broth with culture time. The increase in protein content as a function of growth time was correlated with an increase in foam stability and antifoam consumption. A "synthetic fermentation broth" was also developed, by adding both proteins and microorganism to the culture medium. This allowed us to mimic the fermentation broth, shown by the similar antifoams behaviour, and is therefore a simple methodology useful for the selection of appropriate antifoams. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|It {{is shown}} that DGV and CH {{chemiluminescence}} measurements {{can be easily}} combined. By changing one interference filter, {{using one of the}} DGV cameras and the DGV optical probe for the visible spectral range CH chemiluminescence measurements are performed with the same optical set up. Even though the CH chemiluminescence intensity is more sensitive to the stoichiometry compared to OH chemiluminescence it gives a time and cost saving volumetric overview on the variation in time of the local heat formation. An application example demonstrates the capability of visualizing the overall flame structure to assure the correct flame symmetry before applying more cost-intensive techniques. Using a standard PC sound card, the microphone signal from the combustor and the camera trigger are recorded allowing a comparison of burner conditions in matters of combustion oscillation frequency, frequency stability and microphone signal amplitude stability over a time period. Probably as a consequence of an asymmetry in the gas supply the studied flame of the <b>test</b> <b>burner</b> showed an asymmetric heat formation and unstable oscillation frequencies. The flame asymmetry was verified also by OH chemiluminescence measurements. Due to the trigger instability it was impossible to realize phase resolved velocity measurements with the standard set up for DGV in flames. Nevertheless time averaged velocity measurements of the flow field were performed which showed in contrast to the chemiluminescence results highly symmetric velocity fields. The signal to background scattering intensity ratio of the DGV set up was improved by the use of black exhaust colour for surface stray light reduction and a water cooled light trap...|$|R

The propellant is often exposed to harsh environments during combustion such as extreme temperatures and high pressures. While the burning rates of AP/HTPB-based solid rocket propellants up to pressures of 2000 psi are well documented, relatively little data at higher pressures exists. Therefore, a new high-pressure, constant-volume strand burner facility has been installed and characterized at Texas A&M University to test pressures up to 10, 000 psi. The design is primarily based on the current <b>test</b> vessel, strand <b>burner</b> II or SB-II and includes a cylindrical main body, two endcaps, and a bolt which is used to hold the test specimen. In addition to high-pressure testing, the new strand burner will be used to determine the temperature sensitivity of AP/HTPB-based solid propellants at high and low temperatures. For low-temperature <b>tests,</b> the strand <b>burner</b> will be placed horizontally into a freezer and cooled to - 65 ?F; whereas for the high-temperature <b>tests,</b> the strand <b>burner</b> will be heated to 194 ?F using resistance heating tape and mounted vertically.
