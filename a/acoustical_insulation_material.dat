40|$|Two {{types of}} cement-based {{functional}} composites, thermal insulation and acoustical insulation materials, {{have been developed}} and characterized in this thesis. For thermal insulation material, paraffin and foam plastic beads had been incorporated into a short fiber reinforced cementitious composite. The extrusion technique is utilized to manufacture the composite panels. A series of heat transfer tests under both steady and transient condition is performed by using a controlled-environment multi-test facility. A combined conduction-convection system is arranged in the tests to evaluate the effect of paraffin and foam incorporation. The test results have proved that the foam can reduce the overall thermal conductivity of the composites and the paraffin can enhance the thermal capacity of the materials during transient period. These lead to a good heat insulation property. For <b>acoustical</b> <b>insulation</b> <b>material,</b> lead spheres coated with silicone rubber are used as coarse aggregates. The lead ball is a heavy mass and the silicone rubber behaves as a soft spring. The coated lead spheres are embedded into a short fiber reinforced cement-based matrix. When a sound wave passes through the composite panel, localized excitation occurring in the coated lead balls will be induced. And thus the sound transmission through the panel can be greatly reduced. Therefore, the composite panel improves acoustical insulation by the localized resonant excitation...|$|E

40|$|<b>Acoustical</b> <b>insulation</b> and {{absorption}} {{properties of}} nonwoven fabrics depend on fiber geometry and fiber arrangement within the fabric structure. The {{different structures of}} the fibers result in different total surface areas of nonwoven fabrics. Nonwoven fabrics such as vertically lapped fabrics are ideal materials for use as <b>acoustical</b> <b>insulation</b> products, because they have high total surface. Vertically lapped nonwoven technology consists of carding, perpendicular layering of the carded webs, and through-air bonding using synthetic binder fibers. The surface area of the fabric {{is directly related to}} the denier and cross-sectional shape of the fibers in the fabric. Smaller deniers yield more fibers per unit weight of the material, higher total fiber surface area, and greater possibilities for a sound wave to interact with the fibers in the fabric structure. The research in the literature uses two methods for measuring acoustical properties of fabric materials: the impedance tube and reverberation room method. Small test samples are in the impedance tube method and sound absorption coefficient is determined at each frequency. Large reverberation rooms and large test samples are used for the reverberation room method. A direct comparative acoustical properties measurement device that was designed and fabricated at Clemson University School of Materials Science & Engineering was used to measure <b>acoustical</b> <b>insulation</b> in this research. This paper provides a description of the measurement devices and acoustical measurement data for vertically lapped nonwoven fabrics made from three different polyester fiber shape and two denier levels...|$|R

Currently, to alleviate the road traffic noise damage, a demand for installation of soundproofing walls is rising. Among different shapes of soundproof walls being installed, the reflection-type <b>acoustical</b> <b>insulation</b> panel is highly drawing attentions of residents {{due to the fact that}} it does not obstruct their field of vision in contrast with the opaque <b>acoustical</b> <b>insulation</b> panel. On the other hand, improving the soundproofing wall of the reflection-type <b>acoustical</b> <b>insulation</b> barrier panel needs to be focused on since it has a possibility to cause a secondary damage by reflected sounds. Therefore, in this research, study has been carried out to improve the forms in order to minimize travelling of reflected sounds through changing the frontal surface shape and geometrical shape of the reflection-type soundproofing panel. A result from comparison between the normal reflection-type soundproofing panel and the improved soundproofing panel, with reduction effects in the noise reflection, showed that the curved type of soundproofing panel has an impact on reducing the noise up to 1. 5 dB. Furthermore, from the research conducted, it appears that the increase and decrease in the reflected sounds can be changeable depending on various design factors. Thus, it turns out that the study shows a potential possibility to develop a reduction technology of the reflected sound...|$|R
