In {{order to determine the}} critical arching radius, which marks the change from arching to flow, a situation where all the powder is in a critical passive state of stress is considered, and the powder in the standpipe is assumed to be composed of arched layers. The differential equations of force balance for <b>a</b> <b>elemental</b> arched layer corresponding to conical, trapezoidal, cylindrical, and rectangular tube shapes were given, respectively. The solutions of these differential equations, which can be used to determine the critical arching span, were also given. The boundary condition for solving these differential equations are that minor principal stresses equal zero at bottom surface of the arched layers. The calculated results of the critical arching span agree well with experimental data and these equations for predicting the possibility of arching can therefore be applied to industrial operation and design to preclude moving-bed flow from arching...|$|E
40|$|Two-dimensional (2 D) {{semiconductors}} isoelectronic to phosphorene {{has been}} drawing much attention recently {{due to their}} promising applications for next-generation (opt) electronics. This family of 2 D materials contains more than 400 members, including (<b>a)</b> <b>elemental</b> group-V materials, (b) binary III-VII and IV-VI compounds, (c) ternary III-VI-VII and IV-V-VII compounds, making materials design with targeted functionality unprecedentedly rich and extremely challenging. To shed light on rational functionality design with this family of materials, we systemically explore their fundamental band gaps and alignments using hybrid density functional theory (DFT) in combination with machine learning. First, GGA-PBE and HSE calculations are performed as a reference. We find this family of materials share similar crystalline structures, but possess largely distributed band-gap values ranging approximately from 0 to 8 eV. Then, we apply machine learning methods, including Linear Regression (LR), Random Forest Regression (RFR), and Support Vector Machine Regression (SVR), to build models for prediction of electronic properties. Among these models, SVR is found {{to have the best}} performance, yielding the root mean square error (RMSE) less than 0. 15 eV for predicted band gaps, VBMs, and CBMs when both PBE results and elemental information are used as features. Thus, we demonstrate machine learning models are universally suitable for screening 2 D isoelectronic systems with targeted functionality and especially valuable for the design of alloys and heterogeneous systems.

40|$|International audienceIn this work, {{we studied}} the selenization {{processes}} of sputtered Cu/ln stacked layers with two {{different kinds of}} Selenium (Se) sources: Se pellets (A) and an evaporated layer (B). Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM), Grazing Incidence X-Ray Diffraction (GIXRD) and Raman spectroscopy were used to characterize the selenized films. In the group <b>A,</b> <b>elemental</b> Se pellets were used to generate Se vapor and react with metallic precursors. When selenized at 270 degrees C, {{a large amount of}} Cu Se platelets exhibiting regular hexagonal or polygonal structures were observed at the film surface. After the selenization at 380 degrees C, the films were constituted of large CulnSe(2) grains with diameter in the 500 nm range. In the group B, an evaporated Se layer at the precursor surface was involved as Se source. At 270 degrees C, the film surfaces were homogeneously covered by the Cu Se wires. Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDS) and GIXRD both indicated that a Se concentration lower in the wires than that in the platelets formed in group A. At 380 degrees C, films were made of a single CulnSe(2) phase, with grain sizes in the 200 - 300 nm range, i. e. smaller than the grain sizes of group A. The relationships of film surface modifications during the selenization with different Se sources were discussed. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|PosterThe small {{volcanic}} massif of Balchit {{is one of}} the Pliocene silicic {{centers of}} the Wechecha Formation (Addis Ababa Rift Embayment). It is located some 25 km SE of Addis Ababa and 7 km NE of Melka Kunture, on the left interfluve of the Awash river. and has recently been dated at 4. 37 ± 0. 07 Ma by K-Ar. It constitutes a major obsidian source-area. In the vicinity of Melka Kunture, obsidian is a major component of lithic series since the Oldowayan. Since 1999, new investigations have been undertaken on the prehistory and volcano-sedimentary environments of Melka Kunture and a special attention was paid to obsidian artefacts and its primary and secondary sources. Analyses were performed on several obsidian samples from various locations, both in situ from a lava flow of Balchit and reworked debris or pebbles from different alluvial formations of the Awash river and its tributaries. The trace element contents of two Balchit samples from the main obsidianbearing lava flow and of nine obsidian pebbles from alluvial deposits were determined by ICP-MS at LGCA (Grenoble) and at SOCFAC (Southampton), using the same experimental procedure. Six obsidians pebbles were found to present the same (type <b>A)</b> <b>elemental</b> composition as the two Balchit obsidians and therefore might come from this mother-rock.

40|$|Background: The {{scientific}} {{contribution to}} the solution of crime cases, or throughout the consequent forensic trials, is a crucial aspect of the justice system. The possibility to extract meaningful information from trace amounts of samples, and to match and validate evidences with robust and unambiguous statistical tests, are the key points of such process. The present report is the authorized disclosure of an investigation, carried out by Attorney General appointment, on a murder case in northern Italy, which yielded the critical supporting evidence for the judicial trial. Methodology/Principal Findings: The proportional distribution of 54 chemical elements and the bacterial community DNA fingerprints were used as signature markers to prove the similarity of two soil samples. The first soil was collected on the crime scene, along a corn field, while the second was found in trace amounts on the carpet of a car impounded from the main suspect in a distant location. The matching similarity of the two soils was proven by crossing the results of two independent techniques: <b>a)</b> <b>elemental</b> analysis via inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) approaches, and b) amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis by gel electrophoresis (ARDRA). Conclusions: Besides introducing the novel application of these methods to forensic disciplines, the highly accurate level of resolution observed, opens new possibilities also {{in the fields of}} soil typing and tracking, historical analyses, geochemica...|$|E
40|$|The sound {{radiation}} properties of real normal modes {{are often used}} to characterise acoustic sources such as vibrating plates. The assumption of homogeneously distributed structural damping is usually made and in consequence the eigenmodes are real. With {{the increasing use of}} high-performance composite structures and the demanding requirements for acoustic comfort, damping treatments such as constrained layer damping or embedded elastomer layers may be distributed locally at some critical locations of the vibrating structure. This violates the assumption of homogeneously distributed structural damping and results in complex mode shapes. In this case, dynamics of the vibrating systems within the resonances is no longer dominated by pure standing waves, but also by a superposition with travelling waves. This paper presents the results of a numerical study on {{sound radiation}} properties of this phenom-enon, generally known as complex modes of vibration. The finite element model of an inhomoge-neously damped plate is used to generate and investigate complex vibration patterns. The level of modal complexity of the generated complex modes is characterized by the modal collinearity index and the spatial distribution of the standing wave ratio. The fluid structure interaction is implemented by <b>a</b> <b>elemental</b> radiator approach and used for the acoustic characterisation of vibration patterns in terms of far-field radiation efficiencies and spatial distributions of sound intensity. It is shown that the eigenvector complexity can seriously affect the sound radiation properties of structural modes...|$|E

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Bombesin prevents gut mucosal atrophy, which {{is produced by}} feeding rats <b>an</b> <b>elemental</b> diet. Administration of MTX produces a lethal enterocolitis in rats fed <b>an</b> <b>elemental</b> diet. METHODS: On treatment day 0, 60 rats were divided randomly into three groups and fed <b>an</b> <b>elemental</b> diet (Vivonex TEN, Sandoz, Minneapolis, MN) as {{the only source of}} nutrition. Groups were subdivided further to receive either saline or bombesin (10 micrograms/kg, subcutaneously, three times a day) beginning either on day 0 or day 14. Methotrexate (20 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) was given to all rats 14 days after the start of <b>an</b> <b>elemental</b> diet. RESULTS: Bombesin prevented the mucosal atrophy in the ileum produced by the elemental diet and significantly decreased mortality in rats given MTX (whether given as a pretreatment or at the time of MTX administration). CONCLUSION: Bombesin significantly improved survival in a lethal model of MTX-induced enterocolitis, possibly by maintaining gut mucosal structure.
