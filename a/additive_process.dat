In [MD] we {{defined and}} studied {{a class of}} summable <b>processes,</b> called <b>additive</b> summable <b>processes,</b> that {{is larger than the}} class {{previously}} studied by Dinculeanu and Brooks [D–B].

In this article we consider examples of processes that are integrable with respect to an <b>additive</b> summable <b>process</b> or locally integrable with respect to a locally <b>additive</b> summable <b>processes.</b> In particular, we show that if X is a locally <b>additive</b> summable <b>process,</b> then X − is integrable with respect to X.

40|$|Since {{the seminal}} work of Lamperti {{there is a lot}} of {{interest}} in the understanding of the general structure of self-similar Markov processes. Lamperti gave a representation of positive self-similar Markov processes with initial condition strictly larger than 0 which subsequently was extended to zero initial condition. For real self-similar Markov processes (rssMps) there is a generalization of Lamperti's representation giving a one-to-one correspondence between Markov <b>additive</b> <b>processes</b> and rssMps with initial condition different from the origin. We develop fluctuation theory for Markov <b>additive</b> <b>processes</b> and use Kuznetsov measures to construct the law of transient real self-similar Markov processes issued from the origin.

The present paper aims at {{investigating}} {{some basic}} properties of <b>additive</b> <b>processes</b> on local fields which are rotation-invariant, i. e., invariant under multiplications by any elements of norm 1. We {{will give the}} transition probabilities of such processes explicitly, and prove that each process is a limit of processes expressed as integrals. The Lévy measures of their transition probabilities {{will be used to}} tell whether they are recurrent, and whether they are stable. For stable processes, we will give some detailed observations. In § 1, we will give explicitly all rotation-invariant <b>additive</b> <b>processes</b> on any local field K. § 2 is devoted to show Lévy-Ito decomposition theorem for rotation-invariant <b>additive</b> <b>processes</b> on local fields, which represents them as limits of some integrals.

40|$|In this study, {{we review}} the {{connections}} between L'{e}vy processes with jumps and self-decomposable laws. Self-decomposable laws constitute a subclass of infinitely divisible laws. L'{e}vy <b>processes</b> <b>additive</b> <b>processes</b> and independent increments can be related using self-similarity property. Sato (1991) defined <b>additive</b> <b>processes</b> as a generalization of L'{e}vy processes. In this way, <b>additive</b> <b>processes</b> are those processes with inhomogeneous (in general) and independent increments and L'{e}vy processes correspond with the particular {{case in which the}} increments are time homogeneous. Hence L'{e}vy processes are considerable as a particular type. Self-decomposable distributions occur as limit law an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type process associated with a background driving L'{e}vy process. Finally as an application, asset returns are representing by a normal inverse Gaussian process. Then to test applicability of this representation, we use the nonparametric threshold estimator of the quadratic variation, proposed by Cont and Mancini (2007). </p...|$|R

5000|$|Originally, {{film was}} {{a strip of}} {{cellulose}} nitrate coated with black-and-white photographic emulsion. Early film pioneers, like D. W.

The first successful natural color process was Britain's Kinemacolor (1908-1914), a two-color <b>additive</b> <b>process</b> that used a rotating disk with red and green filters {{in front of the}} camera lens and the projector lens. But any process that photographed and projected the colors sequentially was subject to color [...] "fringing" [...] around moving objects, and a general color flickering.|$|E

After reading up on the subject in the library they started to experiment with additive color processes. Their experiments were continued during their college years, eventually producing a camera having two lenses that project images side by side on a single strip of film. The color rendition of this additive two-color process was not too bad, but aligning the two lenses of the projector needed was too difficult.|$|E

Intuitively, we expect the results which were obtained in this paper can enrich the above relative fields. Moreover, there are scant papers related to the admixture <b>additive</b> <b>processes</b> and the admixture multiplicative processes. The behaviors of the admixture <b>additive</b> <b>processes</b> and the admixture multiplicative processes deserve to be investigated extensively.|$|R
