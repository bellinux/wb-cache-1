Saffron's main colourant is the flavonoid crocin; it has been discovered in the less tediously harvestedand hence less costlygardenia fruit. Research in China is ongoing. In Europe saffron threads were {{a key component of}} an aromatic oil known as crocinum, which comprised such motley ingredients as <b>alkanet,</b> dragon's blood (for colour), and wine (again for colour). Crocinum was applied as a perfume to hair.

[...] Madder and related plants of the genus [...] Rubia [...] are native to many temperate zones around the world, and were already used as sources of good red dye, such as rose madder, in prehistory. [...] Madder has been identified on linen in the tomb of Tutankhamun, and Pliny the Elder records madder growing near Rome. Madder was a dye of commercial importance in Europe, being cultivated in the Netherlands and France to dye the red coats of military uniforms until the market collapsed following the development of synthetic alizarin dye in 1869.

When patrolling for young queens {{with which to}} mate, the males fly in circuits about 1 m above ground, marking objects with their pheromones to attract the queens. The bumblebee often visits thistles and bramble. The queen also feeds on flowers such as sallow, deadnettles, dandelion, bay, horse chestnut, lavender, and others. The males, on the contrary, visits clovers, green <b>alkanets,</b> hound's-tongues, knapweeds, and many others.|$|R
