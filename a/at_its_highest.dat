5|$|Under certain conditions, protons can {{re-enter}} the mitochondrial matrix without {{contributing to}} ATP synthesis.

The process results in the unharnessed potential energy of the proton electrochemical gradient being released as heat. The process is mediated by a proton channel called thermogenin, or UCP1. Thermogenin is a 33 kDa protein first discovered in 1973. Thermogenin is primarily found in brown adipose tissue, or brown fat, and is responsible for non-shivering thermogenesis.
