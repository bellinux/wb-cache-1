25|$|Islamic philosophy, imbued <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>with</b> Islamic theology, distinguishes {{more clearly}} than Aristotelianism the {{difference}} between essence and existence.

This was first described by Avicenna's works on metaphysics, who was himself influenced by al-Farabi.|$|E

The philosophy of Ibn Sīnā, particularly that part relating to metaphysics, owes much to al-Farabi.

25|$|Platelets do {{not need}} to belong to the same A-B-O blood group as the {{recipient}} or be cross-matched to ensure immune compatibility between donor and recipient unless they contain a significant amount of red blood cells (RBCs).

500|$|Many of {{the sound}} effects in Barton Fink are laden with meaning. For example, Barton is summoned by a bell while dining in New York; its sound is light and pleasant. By contrast, the eerie {{sustained}} bell of the Hotel Earle rings endlessly through the lobby, until Chet silences it. The nearby rooms of the hotel emit a constant chorus of guttural cries, moans, and assorted unidentifiable noises. These sounds coincide with Barton's confused mental state and punctuate Charlie's claim that [...] "I hear everything {{that goes on in}} this dump". The applause in the first scene foreshadows the tension of Barton's move west, mixed <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>with</b> the sound of an ocean wave crashing– an image which is shown onscreen soon thereafter.|$|E
500|$|To {{remedy the}} defects {{revealed}} by {{the passage of the}} Alien and Sedition Acts, Madison called for citizens to have an absolute right to free speech. Madison writes that the ability to prosecute speech amounts to [...] "a protection of those who administer the government, if they should at any time deserve the contempt or hatred of the people, against being exposed to it." [...] Freedom of the press was necessary, because [...] "chequered <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>with</b> abuses, the world is indebted to the press for all the triumphs which have been gained by reason and humanity over error and oppression." [...] The Report supported a strict interpretation of the First Amendment. While the Federalists interpreted the amendment as limiting the power of Congress over the press, but implying that such power existed, Madison argued that the First Amendment wholly prohibited Congress from any interference with the press.|$|E

500|$|Historians today {{generally}} {{dismiss the}} authenticity of the find, attributing it to a publicity stunt performed to raise funds to repair the Abbey, which was mostly burned in 1184. William of Malmesbury's history of the English kings stated [...] "Arthur’s grave is nowhere seen, whence antiquity of fables still claims that he will return" [...] and his work [...] "On the Antiquity of the Glastonese Church"—larded <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>with</b> known and suspected pious forgeries—nowhere mentions a connection between the abbey and either Arthur's grave or Avalon. The fact that the search for Arthur's body is connected to Henry II and Edward I, both kings who fought major Welsh wars, has had scholars suggest that propaganda may have played a part as well. Gerald, a constant supporter of royal authority, in his account of the discovery clearly aims to destroy the idea of the possibility of King's Arthur's messianic return: [...] "Many tales are told and many legends have been invented about King Arthur and his mysterious ending. In their stupidity the British [...] people maintain that he is still alive. Now that the truth is known, I have taken the trouble to add a few more details in this present chapter. The fairy-tales have been snuffed out, and the true and indubitable facts are made known, so that what really happened must be made crystal clear to all and separated from the myths which have accumulated on the subject." ...|$|E

[...] In the St. Petersburg Times, Adam Begley also noted the use of what he called [...] "techno-babble". In The Washington Post, Jack Womack wrote that Vachss describes the Batmobile [...] "lovingly yet gnomically, as if a Motor Trend review had been translated into Slovakian by someone more familiar with Czech" [...] and concluded that the novel was [...] "as satisfying — aesthetically, ethically, morally — as a pulse-pounding yarn in which pulp-fiction hero Doc Savage ransacks the shantytowns of South America in a terribly successful search for Doc Mengele." [...] In Kirkus Reviews, the story was compared to a generic [...] "Destroy All Exploiters" [...] video game where Batman [...] "disposes of each lower-level pimp, then moves up to the next level". Sybil Steinberg in Publishers Weekly noted that [...] "while no classic, this is likely the [...] most stylish adaptation yet of a comic-book figure, its cold stiletto prose and white-hot passions lifting it leagues above recent Spider-man and Incredible Hulk offerings. It's also Vachss' best work since Shella". [...] Both the Library Journal and Booklist predicted heavy demand for it at public libraries.|$|E

She questions Galsworthy's recommendation of the novel to sportsmen in the foreword, wondering [...] "how many budding sportsmen might have had conversion experiences in the face of Salten's unrelieved harangue and how many might have instead become alienated." [...] In comparing the novel to the Disney film, Steve Chapple of Sports Afield felt that Salten viewed Bambi's forest as a [...] "pretty scary place" [...] and the novel as a whole had a [...] "lot of dark adult undertones." [...] Interpreting it as an allegory for Salten's own life, Chapple felt Salten [...] " [...] across [...] a little morbid, a bleeding heart of a European intellectual."

500|$|While the {{majority}} of the critics gave [...] "Lord Snow" [...] a positive review, many suggested that it suffered from having to introduce many new characters and locations. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes surveyed 10 reviews of the episode and judged 80% of them to be positive with an average score of 8.75 out of 10. The website's critical consensus reads, [...] "'Lord Snow' is an intriguing and heavy transitional episode with standout performances from Bean and Gillen, though it would be better served with more focus on character change and development." [...] Myles McNutt wrote at Cultural Learnings that it was [...] "perhaps the most narratively uninteresting episode of the first six," [...] although he highlighted that it was [...] "hardly a bad episode of television, filled <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>with</b> satisfying sequences that capture many themes key to the series," [...] and added that many issues introduced in this episode had a payoff in future installments. Entertainment Weekly James Hibberd also thought that it was his least favorite episode of the first six, due to too much character development. However, Alan Sepinwall from HitFix, liked the [...] "more rambling quality of 'Lord Snow,' and while admitting it is heavy on exposition he felt it worked [...] "because the stories are being told with such passion." [...] IGN's Matt Fowler wrote that [...] "Lord Snow" [...] was [...] "dense and filled with tons of exposition and backstory, {{which may or may not}} have interested those new to this story - but I found myself hanging on every precious word." [...] Alan Sepinwall wrote a positive review of the episode for HitFix, saying [...] "Arya's fencing lesson is a wonderful scene, carried by the joy of Maisie Williams' performance and the playful, Inigo Montoya-ish quality of her new teacher Syrio, but it's also such a small, simple thing that you wouldn't ordinarily expect it to be the note that an episode of dramatic television goes out on" [...] and continued [...] "I liked the looser, more rambling quality of [...] "Lord Snow," [...] an episode largely about transitions, fish out of water, and old ghosts.|$|E
