5|$|Bigger {{guns were}} developed, {{and in the}} 15thcentury became an {{alternative}} to siege engines such as the trebuchet. The benefits of large guns over trebuchets– the most effective siege engine of the Middle Ages {{before the advent of}} gunpowder– were those of a greater range and power. In <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> them more effective, guns were made ever bigger, although this hampered their ability to reach remote castles. By the 1450s guns were the preferred siege weapon, and their effectiveness was demonstrated by Mehmed II at the Fall of Constantinople.|$|E

5|$|At 12:00, Dornal de Guy on Manche {{pulled away}} from her {{battered}} opponent, obeying Hamelin's order to join with his flagship. Hamelin then sent Manche and Créole after the slow Charlton and United Kingdom, using Vénus to chase Windham. Stewart had used the break in the action to effect rudimentary repairs to his battered ship and, with the agreement of his officers, determined to abandon the other ships and escape alone. Manche and the corvette rapidly overhauled and captured Charlton and United Kingdom, their captains Charles Mortlock and William D'Esterre making no serious attempt to resist or escape. Vénus however became embroiled in a lengthy chase as Stewart threw all not essential stores overboard in <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> his ship lighter and faster. For five days, Windham led Vénus in pursuit across the Bay of Bengal {{and it was not}} until 10:30 on 22 November that Hamelin finally closed with the British ship and forced her surrender.|$|E
5|$|Bouldering {{can damage}} {{vegetation}} that grows on rocks, such as mosses and lichens. This can {{occur as a}} result of the climber intentionally cleaning the boulder, or unintentionally from repeated use of handholds and footholds. Vegetation on the ground surrounding the boulder can also be damaged from overuse, particularly by climbers laying down crash pads. Soil erosion can occur when boulderers trample vegetation while hiking off of established trails, or when they unearth small rocks near the boulder in <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the landing zone safer. The repeated use of white climbing chalk can damage the rock surface of boulders and cliffs, particularly sandstone and other porous rock types, and the scrubbing of rocks to remove chalk can also degrade the rock surface. Other environmental concerns include littering, improperly disposed feces, and graffiti. These issues have caused some land managers to prohibit bouldering, as was the case in Tea Garden, a popular bouldering area in Rocklands, South Africa.|$|E

5|$|In 1789, Adams {{was elected}} Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts {{and served in}} that office until Governor Hancock's death in 1793, when he became acting {{governor}}. The next year, Adams was elected as governor in his own right, {{the first of four}} annual terms. He was generally regarded as the leader of his state's Jeffersonian Republicans, who were opposed to the Federalist Party. Unlike some other Republicans, Adams supported the suppression of the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794 for the same reasons that he had opposed Shays's Rebellion. Like his fellow Republicans, he spoke out against the Jay Treaty in 1796, a position that drew criticism in a state that was increasingly Federalist. In that year's U. S. presidential election, Republicans in Virginia cast 15 electoral votes for Adams in <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> him Jefferson's vice-president, but Federalist John Adams won the election, with Jefferson becoming vice-president. The Adams cousins remained friends, but Samuel was pleased when Jefferson defeated John Adams in the 1800 presidential election.|$|E
5|$|In <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> {{the vehicle}} {{stand out in}} the market against similar rivals, which {{included}} its own derivatives, Peugeot added a more glamorous two-door cabriolet to the standard three-door hatchback. Although announced at the hatchback's launch, the first models were not available until 1982. Designed and built by the Italian coachbuilder Pininfarina, who had been building open-top Peugeots since the 1960s, it came only with the 1360cc engine; two engine versions were offered, 53 or 59kilowatts (72 or 80PS)—the former was dropped after 1984, at which time a slightly revised cabriolet was released featuring the later style 104 dashboard, twin carburettors and a lined hood; the 80bhp engine was shared with the Rallye. At {{the time of its}} launch it was the only cabrio small car available from the manufacturer, although other models subsequently entered the market segment created by the Samba, including PSA's own Citroën Visa Decapotable. Pininfarina built 13,062Samba cabriolets.|$|E

In one case, a prisoner alleged that he had been forced to sign papers while blindfolded. Dr. Fatima Haji alleged that she was blindfolded and beaten in <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> her confess to faking the injuries to protesters during her Al Jazeera interview; she later identified her interrogator as a distant relative of the king. Ibrahim al-Demastani, head of the Bahrain Nurse's Society, alleged that he was deliberately kicked and kneed by guards in his back at a spot where he had told them he had a prolapsed disc; he was then denied medical care until he happened to meet a police officer to whom he had once taught first aid.|$|E

5|$|Although he {{was rarely}} in London, EdwardI {{undertook}} an expensive remodelling of the Tower, costing £21,000 between 1275 and 1285, over double that {{spent on the}} castle during the whole of HenryIII's reign. EdwardI was a seasoned castle builder, and used his experience of siege warfare during the crusades to bring innovations to castle building. His programme of castle building in Wales heralded {{the introduction of the}} widespread use of arrowslits in castle walls across Europe, drawing on Eastern influences. At the Tower of London, Edward filled in the moat dug by HenryIII and built a new curtain wall along its line, creating a new enclosure. A new moat was created in front of the new curtain wall. The western part of HenryIII's curtain wall was rebuilt, with Beauchamp Tower replacing the castle's old gatehouse. A new entrance was created, with elaborate defences including two gatehouses and a barbican. In <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the castle self-sufficient, EdwardI also added two watermills. Six hundred Jews were imprisoned in the Tower of London in 1278, charged with coin clipping. Persecution of the country's Jewish population under Edward began in 1276 and culminated in 1290 when he issued the Edict of Expulsion, forcing the Jews out of the country.|$|E
5|$|Cotes' {{ship was}} fit only to sail with the wind, {{and the captain}} urged his men to make greater efforts to repair their ship before Uranie {{could come up with}} them again. So engrossed was the British crew with their repairs that it was not until 16:00 that it was {{realised}} that the French frigate was no longer holding station within sight, and had completely disappeared. This led some on the British ship to assume that Uranie had sunk, although in fact the ship had simply turned away in <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it back to Rochefort to repair the damage suffered in the engagement. Also apparent were a number of sails in the distance. These rapidly approached and were revealed to be a frigate squadron flying the Union Flag. Cotes was unable to manoeuvre his ship or respond to the new arrivals, which were soon identified as French vessels wearing false flags. The leading frigate pulled up close to Thames and fired a broadside at the British frigate. Cotes immediately hailed the French, announcing that he was in no position to fight them due to the damage his ship had suffered and that he was striking his flag.|$|E
5|$|In March 1865, Irataba and the Mohave {{defeated}} the Chemehuevi after their allies, the Paiutes, killed two Mohave women. The Mohave pushed the Chemehuevi off their traditional territory {{and into the}} California desert, but they soon returned. To avoid fighting a two-front war, Irataba attacked the Chemehuevi first, then {{turned his attention to}} the Paiutes, who were planning an attack on the Mohave farm and granary on the Colorado's Cottonwood Island. During a subsequent battle with the Chemehuevi in October 1865, Irataba was taken prisoner while wearing his major general's uniform. According to a contemporary news report based on second hand accounts from white travelers, the captors feared that killing him would invite repercussions from the soldiers stationed at Fort Mohave, so they instead stripped him naked and sent him home badly beaten. In the Mohave account of the events as told by Chooksa homar, Irataba surrendered in <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> peace with the Chemehuevi, and offered his uniform to their chief as a gesture of peace. In 1867, a treaty signed by Irataba and the Chemehuevi leader Pan Coyer restored peaceful relations between the two nations.|$|E

5|$|The game's setting, Kyrat, is {{a fictional}} {{country in the}} Himalayas region. When {{building}} Kyrat, the developers merged elements from real-world regions including Nepal and Tibet, but exaggerated those elements. The map's size {{is similar to that}} of Far Cry 3, but is more dense, diverse, and features more varied environments. The developers hoped that players could experience a sense of exploration when traveling between the different terrains. The team also hoped that the new location could be believable, while remaining interesting for players. As a result, they created an identify for Kyrat by doing such things as adding different signboards to the game and creating a fictional mythology and religion for Kyrat. The game's world was also designed to accommodate new features such as the helicopter and the grappling hook. In <b>an</b> <b>effort</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the world feel real, the team added improvements to the design of side-quests. Instead of simply being activities for players to complete, the quests are narrative-driven, which was done to increase the connection between them and the world. In order to increase the credibility of the game's world, the studio sent a team to Nepal to experience and record the local culture, so that they could bring those ideas back to the studio. According to the developer, the trip changed the game's design; the focus shifted from the game's civil war, which is inspired by the real-world Nepalese Civil War, to developing unique and interesting characters.|$|E
