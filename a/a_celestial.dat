5|$|The {{discovery}} of volcanic {{activity on the}} moon Io was the greatest unexpected finding of the mission, {{as it was the}} first time an active volcano was observed on <b>a</b> <b>celestial</b> body other than Earth. Together, the Voyagers recorded the eruption of nine volcanoes on Io, as well as evidence for other eruptions occurring between the Voyager encounters.|$|E

5|$|A polar bear—the {{guardian}} of the ice wand—raises the ice wand from beneath the ocean. The fairies add an ice wand to each planet of the Solar System. Along with the white wand at Fairy World, the ice wands create <b>a</b> <b>celestial</b> smile that projects its light into The Darkness. The smile transforms it into a bright sun, The Kindness, and Timmy concludes The Darkness was only looking for a friend. The group returns to Dimmsdale, where an Eliminator, dubbed a 'Hug'inator by Cosmo, crashes {{in front of them}} and spews out everyone who had been sucked in. Everyone parties in Fairy World and celebrates the chosen one's accomplishment.|$|E
5|$|After the impact, villagers who had {{approached}} the impact site grew sick from a then-unexplained illness, {{with a wide}} array of symptoms. Two days later, Peruvian scientists confirmed that there had indeed been a meteorite strike, quieting widespread speculation that {{it may have been a}} geophysical rather than <b>a</b> <b>celestial</b> event. At that point, no further information on the cause of the mystery illness was known. The ground water in the local area is known to contain arsenic compounds, and the illness is now believed to have been caused by arsenic poisoning incurred when residents of the area inhaled the vapor of the boiling arsenic-contaminated water.|$|E
5|$|Before her death, Norman {{met with}} each of her followers; she died on July12, 1993, and was cremated. In her will, she promised to return to Earth, {{accompanied}} by the Space Brothers, in eight years. Students, {{some of whom were}} surprised and confused by her death, were instructed by leaders not to grieve because she was in <b>a</b> <b>celestial</b> state. Some of them privately mourned, and a few left the group. Items of Norman's were distributed to students, some of whom wore them at later events.|$|E

5|$|Both Buddhism and the Lingbao School {{share the}} idea of the Five Paths of Rebirth (Gati). People were reborn into earth prisons, as a hungry ghost, as an animal, as a man, or as <b>a</b> <b>celestial</b> being. After death, the body would be alchemically refined in the Palace of Supreme Darkness located in the north, and the Southern Palace in the south. The {{transmutation}} of the body consisted of two steps; the yin components of the person were refined in the Palace of Supreme Darkness, followed by the yang components in the Southern Palace. The Lingbao concept of rebirth is a Chinese adaptation of Buddhism, mixing traditional Chinese concepts with newly arrived Buddhist ideas.|$|E
5|$|Declination is {{positive}} for an eastward deviation {{of the field}} relative to true north. It can be estimated by comparing the magnetic north/south heading on a compass with the direction of <b>a</b> <b>celestial</b> pole. Maps typically include information on the declination as an angle or a small diagram showing the relationship between magnetic north and true north. Information on declination for a region can be represented by a chart with isogonic lines (contour lines with each line representing a fixed declination).|$|E
5|$|Only six Molyneux globes {{are known}} to exist today, two {{terrestrial}} globes and four celestial globes. Three celestial globes are in Germany, one each in Zerbst, Nuremberg (at the Germanisches Nationalmuseum (German National Museum)) and Kassel (Hessisches Landesmuseum (Hesse Museum), Kassel). The Hessisches Landesmuseum once had a 1592 terrestrial globe, but it {{is believed to have}} been destroyed during World War II. Three globes remain in England: one pair, consisting of a terrestrial and <b>a</b> <b>celestial</b> globe, is owned by Middle Temple in London and displayed in its library, while a terrestrial globe is at Petworth House in Petworth, West Sussex.|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} {{deploying}} multiple spacecraft is disclosed. The method {{can be used}} in a situation where <b>a</b> first <b>celestial</b> body is being orbited by <b>a</b> second <b>celestial</b> body. The spacecraft are loaded onto a single spaceship that contains the multiple spacecraft and the spacecraft is launched from the second <b>celestial</b> body towards <b>a</b> third <b>celestial</b> body. The spacecraft are separated from each other while in route to the third celestial body. Each of the spacecraft is then subjected to the gravitational field of the third celestial body and each of the spacecraft assumes a different, independent orbit about the first celestial body. In those situations where the spacecraft are launched from Earth, the Sun can act as the first celestial body, the Earth can act as the second celestial body and the Moon can act as the third celestial body...|$|R

Quill's group flee to Knowhere, a remote {{criminal}} outpost in space {{built in the}} giant severed head of <b>a</b> <b>Celestial.</b> A drunken Drax summons Ronan {{while the rest of}} the group meet Gamora's contact, the collector Taneleer Tivan. Tivan opens the orb, revealing an Infinity Stone, an item of immeasurable power that destroys all but the most powerful beings who wield it. Tivan's tormented assistant Carina grabs the Stone, triggering an explosion that engulfs Tivan's archive.|$|E
5|$|Taoist temples in {{southern}} China and Taiwan may often {{be identified by}} their roofs, which feature dragons and phoenixes made from multi-colored ceramic tiles. They also stand for the harmony of yin and yang (with the phoenix representing yin). A related symbol is the flaming pearl, which may be seen on such roofs between two dragons, {{as well as on}} the hairpin of <b>a</b> <b>Celestial</b> Master. In general though, Chinese Taoist architecture lacks universal features that distinguish it from other structures.|$|E
5|$|The Molyneux globes at the Hessisches Landesmuseum, Kassel, were {{inherited}} {{from the collection of}} William IV (William the Wise), the Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel), a pioneer of astronomical research. William himself died in 1592, so it has been surmised that his son and successor, Maurice, purchased the globes for the collection. They were first mentioned in 1765 in the index of the Mathematische Kammer (Mathematics Chamber) of the Fürstliches Kunsthaus (Princely Art Gallery) in Kassel, during the reign of Landgrave Frederick III. Only <b>a</b> <b>celestial</b> globe survives today; it is believed that the terrestrial globe was destroyed during World War II.|$|E

5|$|The {{reasons for}} the {{disguise}} are unknown. Hingley notes that many contemporary publications attempted to suggest women had {{played a role in}} their creation, perhaps to make them sound less threatening. He suggests that anonymity might have been necessary to protect Bloxam's position at Rugby, but notes Rugby was quite progressive, which makes this unlikely; and, finally, suggests modesty as a possibility. Ian Ridpath, noting the plagiarism of the art from <b>A</b> <b>Celestial</b> Atlas, suggests that this alone might be sufficient to cause the author to wish to remain anonymous.|$|E
5|$|Tycho Brahe, also {{credited}} with Coma's designation as a constellation, included {{it in his}} 1602 star catalogue. Brahe recorded fourteen stars in the constellation; Johannes Hevelius increased its number to twenty-one, and John Flamsteed to forty-three. Coma Berenices also appeared in Johann Bayer's 1603 Uranometria, {{and a few other}} 17th-century celestial maps followed suit. Coma Berenices and the now-obsolete Antinous are considered the first post-Ptolemaic constellations depicted on <b>a</b> <b>celestial</b> globe. With Antinous, Coma Berenices exemplified a trend in astronomy in which globe- and map-makers continued to rely on the ancients for data. This trend ended {{at the turn of the}} 16th century with observations of the southern sky and the work of Tycho Brahe.|$|E
5|$|Zhao Shaung's 3rd-century {{commentary}} in the Zhoubi suanjing describes two astronomical theories: in one, {{the heavens}} are shaped as a hemi-spherical dome extending over the earth, {{while the other}} compares the earth to the central yolk of an egg, where the heavens are shaped as <b>a</b> <b>celestial</b> sphere around the earth. The latter astronomical theory was mentioned by Yang Xiong in his Model Sayings (Fayan 法言) and expounded on by Zhang Heng in his Spiritual Constitution of the Universe (Lingxian 靈憲) of 120 CE. Thus, the Han-era Chinese believed in a geocentric model for the immediate solar system and greater universe, {{as opposed to a}} heliocentric model.|$|E
