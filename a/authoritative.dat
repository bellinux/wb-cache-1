5|$|Walker's {{objective}} in Three Mile Island {{was to write}} a comprehensive and <b>authoritative</b> history that would serve as an <b>authoritative</b> record for both the interested public and the NRC. The book provides {{a detailed account of}} the causes of the accident and the response to it by the NRC, the state of Pennsylvania, and the White House.|$|E
5|$|Definitions of mild {{traumatic}} brain injury (MTBI) were inconsistent until the World Health Organization's International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) provided a consistent, <b>authoritative</b> definition across specialties in 1992.|$|E
5|$|Eakin {{considered}} his impersonation of Spemann {{to be his}} most <b>authoritative,</b> due to knowing him personally from working in his lab in Germany, helping translate a book of his into English, and becoming good friends.|$|E
5|$|Justice Callinan dissented {{from the}} majority, holding that {{derivative}} governmental immunity extended to Baxter. Callinan followed Bradken, concluding that it remained <b>authoritative.</b>|$|E
5|$|Her {{political}} {{observations are}} clearly written {{from her own}} Tory viewpoint. However, her {{detailed description of the}} rivalry for power between the Tories and Liberals which took place between 1822 and 1830 {{is one of the most}} <b>authoritative</b> accounts of this struggle.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, an <b>authoritative</b> {{reference}} {{stated that}} the gray wolf could be found across mainland China. In 2017, a comprehensive {{study found that the}} gray wolf was present across all of mainland China, both in the past and today. It exists in southern China, which refutes claims made by some researchers in the Western world that the wolf had never existed in southern China.|$|E
5|$|The 2006 {{edition of}} the Gunn Report, an <b>authoritative</b> annual {{publication}} determining the advertising industry's most critically successful campaigns, revealed that noitulovE had received more awards that year than any other campaign worldwide. Among the awards were three Clios, two Golden Sharks, and the Special Jury Prize at the Imagina Awards.|$|E
5|$|The Saudi {{government}} only recognises {{contracts for}} foreign workers written in Arabic. Where bilingual contracts are available, the Arabic language one is <b>authoritative.</b> The contracts, which must contain {{the terms of}} employment, are held in duplicate, one for the sponsor {{and one for the}} worker. Wages for foreign workers vary, depending on the position, although in general Saudis holding similar positions earn more.|$|E
5|$|The {{canonical}} {{texts are}} {{the writings of}} the Báb, Bahá'u'lláh, `Abdu'l-Bahá, Shoghi Effendi and the Universal House of Justice, and the authenticated talks of `Abdu'l-Bahá. The writings of the Báb and Bahá'u'lláh are considered as divine revelation, the writings and talks of `Abdu'l-Bahá and the writings of Shoghi Effendi as <b>authoritative</b> interpretation, and those of the Universal House of Justice as <b>authoritative</b> legislation and elucidation. Some measure of divine guidance is assumed for all of these texts. Some of Bahá'u'lláh's most important writings include the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, literally the Most Holy Book, which defines many laws and practices for individuals and society, the Kitáb-i-Íqán, literally the Book of Certitude, which became the foundation of much of Bahá'í belief, the Gems of Divine Mysteries, which includes further doctrinal foundations, and the Seven Valleys and the Four Valleys which are mystical treatises.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnostic}} criteria for SCSFLS {{is based on}} the 2004 International Classification of Headache Disorders, 2nd edn (ICHD-II) (Table 1) (50) criteria. However, the presentation of patients with confirmed diagnosis may be very {{different from that of the}} clinical {{diagnostic criteria}} and cannot be considered <b>authoritative.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} comprehensive {{teachings of}} anekāntavāda doctrine {{is found in}} the Tattvarthasutra of Umasvati, considered to be <b>authoritative</b> by all Jain sects including Svetambara and Digambara. The century in which Umaswati lived is unclear, but variously placed by contemporary scholars to sometime between 2nd and 5th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} {{principles are}} frequently {{listed as a}} quick summary of the Bahá'í teachings. They are derived from transcripts of speeches given by `Abdu'l-Bahá during his tour of Europe and North America in 1912. The list is not <b>authoritative</b> {{and a variety of}} such lists circulate.|$|E
5|$|Uranian Worlds, by Eric Garber and Lyn Paleo, was {{compiled}} in 1983 {{and is an}} <b>authoritative</b> guide to science fiction literature featuring gay, lesbian, transgender, and related themes. The book covers science fiction literature published before 1990 (2nd edition, 1990), providing a short review and commentary on each piece.|$|E
5|$|Vaishnava {{followers}} including Dvaita scholars, such as Vijayendra Tirtha (1514–93) {{refute the}} portrayal of Narasimha as being destroyed by Sharabha as they consider the Shaivite Puranas as tamasic - and thus not <b>authoritative</b> - based on their reading of Sattvic Puranas and Shruti texts. The refutation of the Sharabha legend along with ten other Shaivite legends is discussed in a text by Vijayindra Tirtha called Shaivasarvasvakhandanam.|$|E
5|$|Baby becomes {{involved}} in a trivial argument with a loafer in {{the centre of the}} village. The dispute escalates, but passersby calm them down. However, Crispin appears and attacks the man who had argued with Baby. The man, joined by Jimson Augustine, jumps on Crispin in retaliation. Noticing the commotion, Mahesh tries to calm everyone down but Jimson, furious at Mahesh's <b>authoritative</b> stance, beats him up. Vincent breaks up the fight. Embarrassed, Mahesh vows to get back at Jimson and pledges that he will wear slippers only after he has avenged his humiliation.|$|E
5|$|Canon William Lummis, MC, was a {{military}} historian who built up an archive on the service records and final resting places of Victoria Cross holders. This was then summarised into a pamphlet which was taken to be an <b>authoritative</b> source on these matters. However, Lummis was aware of short-comings in his work and encouraged David Harvey to continue it. The result was Harvey's seminal book Monuments to Courage. In 2007 the Royal Mail used material from Lummis' archives to produce a collection of stamps commemorating Victoria Cross recipients.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Government's unequivocal {{view that}} the right to vote is an implied {{constitutional}} right, in Singapore it is the courts that ultimately determine the meaning of the Constitution. Thio Li-ann has suggested that since the right's status {{is not likely to be}} brought before the courts in a dispute, the Cabinet should refer the matter to the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore Tribunal pursuant to Article 100 of the Constitution for an <b>authoritative</b> opinion.|$|E
5|$|In the 1995 {{compilation}} Children and the Politics of Culture, anthropologist Vivienne Wee {{analyzed the}} perception of children by adults and how it supported the concept of children's rights. Wee wrote that in this model (which she called the European pattern), children were seen as defenseless, unadulterated, {{and in need of}} protection by <b>authoritative</b> adults. According to Wee, this European pattern led to the idea that children required the sanctuary of the United Nations Charter and the Convention on the Rights of the Child.|$|E
5|$|Peak {{benefits}} achieved for generalized {{anxiety disorder}} (GAD) may take up to a week. Tolerance to the anxiolytic and antipanic effects is controversial, with only some <b>authoritative</b> sources supporting the development of tolerance; tolerance will, however, develop to the sedative and hypnotic effects {{within a couple of}} days. Withdrawal symptoms or rebound symptoms may occur after ceasing treatment abruptly following a few weeks or longer of steady dosing, and may necessitate a gradual dose reduction. Other risks include increased rates of suicide, possibly due to disinhibition.|$|E
5|$|Speaking in Parliament on 12 February 2009, Nominated Member of Parliament Thio Li-ann {{posed the}} {{question}} of whether the right to vote is a constitutional one and suggested that the Law Minister obtain an advisory opinion to clarify the point. This issue was briefly dealt with by the Minister who simply answered it in the affirmative, rendering the need for a resolution by the constitutional tribunal nugatory. Thio subsequently expressed the view that it would be desirable to ask the Constitutional Tribunal to give its <b>authoritative</b> opinion as the courts are the final arbiter on questions of constitutionality in Singapore.|$|E
5|$|The European Parliamentary Research Service (EPRS) is the European Parliament's {{in-house}} research department and think tank. It provides Members of the European Parliament - and where appropriate, parliamentary committees - with independent, objective and <b>authoritative</b> analysis of, and research on, policy {{issues relating to}} the European Union, in order {{to assist them in}} their parliamentary work. It is also designed to increase Members' and EP committees' capacity to scrutinise and oversee the European Commission and other EU executive bodies.|$|E
5|$|The {{company was}} {{profitable}} {{for the first}} time in the second quarter of 2014, as a result of increasing ad spending by business owners and possibly from changes in Google's local search algorithm. It is dubbed as Google Pigeon, which helped <b>authoritative</b> local directory sites like Yelp and TripAdvisor, in getting more visibility. Over the course of the year, Yelp websites were launched in Mexico, Japan and Argentina. Also in 2014, Yelp expanded in Europe through the acquisitions of German-based restaurant review site Restaurant-Kritik and French-based CityVox.|$|E
5|$|The initial bars of melody {{are warm}} and quietly <b>authoritative,</b> {{but at the}} mention of {{dwelling}} with Him the movement takes on a very different character. The bass line becomes enlivened with little leaps of delight... The singer's last note is a bottom d (c in the transposed version) several notes lower than a bass's accepted range.... when achieved it is an arresting sound, confirming the rock-like certainty of the promise that we shall eventually reside with God.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} version, as {{recorded by}} the Japanese Imperial Army, indicated that he was executed and then hung upside down from a cherry tree due to his 2 days of stubborn retaliation and for not surrendering. (Other accounts say {{that he might have}} been tied to the tree first, then repeatedly bayoneted to death.) British accounts have confirmed that his corpse was found hung upside down after the surrender and this has been repeated in a number of <b>authoritative</b> texts on the Malayan campaign.|$|E
5|$|There is no official, {{canonical}} list of dinosaur genera. The closest is the Dinosaur Genera List, {{compiled by}} biological nomenclature expert George Olshevsky, which {{was first published}} online in 1995 and is regularly updated. The most <b>authoritative</b> general source {{in the field is}} the second (2004) edition of The Dinosauria. The vast majority of citations are based on Olshevsky's list, and all subjective determinations (such as junior synonymy or non-dinosaurian status) are based on The Dinosauria, except where they conflict with primary literature. These exceptions are noted.|$|E
5|$|There is {{no simple}} way of {{differentiating}} a venomous snake from a non-venomous one merely by using a scale character. Finding out whether a snake is venomous or not is correctly done by identification of the species of a snake {{with the help of}} experts, or in their absence, close examination of the snake and using <b>authoritative</b> references on the snakes of the particular geographical region to identify it. Scale patterns help to indicate the species and from the references, it can be verified if the snake species is known to be venomous or not.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{confusion}} over {{the number and}} name of ships {{that were part of}} the Reşadiye class. Some sources report Reşadiye and Mehmed Reşad V as having been different ships; these were in fact the same vessel, ordered originally under the latter name. Similarly, Fatih Sultan Mehmed is sometimes listed as Fatik or Fatih. Another ship, Reshad-i Hammiss, is sometimes reported to have been ordered in 1911 and cancelled in 1912, though according to Bernd Langensiepen and Ahmet Güleryüz in their <b>authoritative</b> The Ottoman Steam Navy, the Ottomans initially only had ordered one vessel.|$|E
5|$|Two essays written {{during this}} time {{foreshadow}} Smuts's later views, both political and philosophical. The first of these, entitled South African Customs Union, was written in 1890 in competition for the JB Ebden prize offered by the University of the Cape of Good Hope. This essay, {{an examination of the}} economic relations of the colonies and states of South Africa, though 'Highly Commended' by the judges, failed to win the prize. Nevertheless, despite achieving only modest success, it is unsurpassed as a clear and <b>authoritative</b> statement of Smuts's political outlook at this time.|$|E
5|$|An <b>authoritative</b> {{version of}} Marco Polo's book does not and cannot exist, {{for the early}} manuscripts differ significantly. The {{published}} editions of his book either rely on single manuscripts, blend multiple versions together, or add notes to clarify, for example in the English translation by Henry Yule. The 1938 English translation by A.C. Moule and Paul Pelliot {{is based on a}} Latin manuscript found in the library of the Cathedral of Toledo in 1932, and is 50% longer than other versions. Approximately 150 manuscript copies in various languages are known to exist, and before availability of the printing press discrepancies were inevitably introduced during copying and translation. The popular translation published by Penguin Books in 1958 by R.E. Latham works several texts together to make a readable whole.|$|E
5|$|An inflationary phase, an {{additional}} phase of strongly accelerated expansion at cosmic times of around 10−33 seconds, was hypothesized in 1980 {{to account for}} several puzzling observations that were unexplained by classical cosmological models, such as the nearly perfect homogeneity of the cosmic background radiation. Recent measurements of the cosmic background radiation {{have resulted in the}} first evidence for this scenario. However, there is a bewildering variety of possible inflationary scenarios, which cannot be restricted by current observations. An even larger question is the physics of the earliest universe, prior to the inflationary phase and close to where the classical models predict the big bang singularity. An <b>authoritative</b> answer would require a complete theory of quantum gravity, which has not yet been developed (cf. the section on quantum gravity, below).|$|E
5|$|Gerlachovský štít was {{not always}} {{considered}} the highest mountain in the Tatras. After the first official measurement of peaks in the Tatras {{during the period of}} the Habsburg Monarchy in the 18th century, Kriváň (2,494m) was considered the highest. Other candidate peaks for the status of the highest mountain at that time were Lomnický štít (2,633m) and Ľadový štít (2,627m). The first person to accurately name Gerlachovský štít as the highest peak was the forester Ľudovít (Ludwig) Greiner in 1838. Greiner's measurement was formally confirmed by an Austrian Army survey party in 1868. However, it was generally accepted only after the Vienna Military Institute for Geography issued a new, <b>authoritative</b> collection of maps of Central Europe in ca. 1875.|$|E
5|$|Hugh Trumble (12 May 1867 – 14 August 1938) was an Australian cricketer {{who played}} 32Test matches as a bowling all-rounder between 1890 and 1904. He captained the Australian team in two Tests, winning both. Trumble took 141wickets in Test cricket—a world record {{at the time}} of his retirement—at an average of 21.78runs per wicket. He is one of only four bowlers to twice take a hat-trick in Test cricket. Observers in Trumble's day, {{including}} the <b>authoritative</b> Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, regarded him as ranking among the great Australian bowlers of the Golden Age of cricket. He was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1897 and the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame, established in 1996, inducted him in 2004.|$|E
5|$|In Roman Egypt {{during the}} 2nd century CE, Claudius Ptolemaeus (Ptolemy) {{attempted}} {{to address the}} problem of the orbital motion of Mars. Observations of Mars had shown that the planet appeared to move 40% faster on one side of its orbit than the other, in conflict with the Aristotelian model of uniform motion. Ptolemy modified the model of planetary motion by adding a point offset from the center of the planet's circular orbit about which the planet moves at a uniform rate of rotation. He proposed that the order of the planets, by increasing distance, was: the Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and the fixed stars. Ptolemy's model and his collective work on astronomy was presented in the multi-volume collection Almagest, which became the <b>authoritative</b> treatise on Western astronomy for the next fourteen centuries.|$|E
5|$|It {{is thought}} that St. Rynagh (also Reynagh, Rinagh), who founded Banagher and after whom the parish is named, was a sister of St. Finnian of Clonard. According to research, they came from a place near New Ross in County Wexford. It is known that contact was {{maintained}} between Rynagh's Wexford home and her foundation at Banagher; and her mother came to live there. It is recorded that Reynagh's mother, Talech, or Talacia, became Abbess of the Banagher convent. The death of St. Finnian is assigned to 563, but there {{does not seem to}} be any <b>authoritative</b> statement as to the date of St. Rynagh's death, although according to St. Rynagh's Parish Church in Banagher, St. Rynagh died about 610. The place of her burial is uncertain but it is likely to have been in either Banagher or Kilmacduagh near Gort, the monastery founded by her son, St. Colman.|$|E
5|$|Kalimpong is the {{headquarters}} of the Kalimpong district. The semi-autonomous Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council (DGHC), set up by the West Bengal government in 1988, administers this district as well as the Darjeeling Sadar and Kurseong subdivisions. Kalimpong elects eight councillors to the DGHC, who manages the departments of Public Health, Education, Public Works, Transport, Tourism, Market, Small scale industries, Agriculture, Agricultural waterways, Forest (except reserved forests), Water, Livestock, Vocational Training and Sports and Youth services. The district administration of Darjeeling, which is the <b>authoritative</b> body for the departments of election, panchayat, law and order, revenue etc., also acts as an interface of communication between the Council and the State Government. The rural area in the district covers three community development blocks Kalimpong I, Kalimpong II and Gorubathan consisting of forty-two gram panchayats. A Sub-Divisional Officer (SDO) presides over the Kalimpong subdivision. Kalimpong has a police station that serves the municipality and 18 gram panchayats of KalimpongI CD block.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the early}} Māori names were {{replaced}} by Europeans during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Government amendments in 1894 {{and the establishment of}} the New Zealand Geographic Board in the mid-1940s led to the encouragement of original Māori names, although incorrect spellings and anglicised pronunciations persisted. Many names now have alternative or dual English and Māori names or, in a few rare cases, dual Māori names or dual English names. Most names have never been made official, but if they are mentioned in <b>authoritative</b> publications they are considered recorded names. Colloquial names in New Zealand result from an ironic view of the place's entertainment value, or plays on advertising mottos, or are shortened versions of the full name. Some places tried to capitalise on the success of The Lord of the Rings films by linking themselves to the movies.|$|E
