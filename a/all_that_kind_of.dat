25|$|The {{first episode}} of Chef! was {{developed}} over two years, and so Peter Tilbury and I were really put through loads of hoops about character motivation. Why is this character such an arsehole? Is this {{the right kind}} of character for Lenny Henry to be playing? <b>All</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> stuff. Once we got through that and they greenlit the series, Peter then had something like eight or nine weeks to write the rest of it. The remaining five episodes were much easier to write because we'd had every argument about who, what, where, and how. The world had been mapped out. Actually, the very first episode of Chef! was the hardest one to watch for me because we'd worked so hard on it and you could see all the things that had been rewritten in the first episode.|$|E
25|$|I grew up {{with three}} totally {{different}} parents that were into different music. My stepfather is into Willie Nelson and Elvis and <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> stuff. And my real father is into Mariah and Whitney and Aretha all those soulful singers. My mom is into more, like, adult contemporary—Celine Dion, Barbra , Bette , all those types of things. And then my brother is a big influence on me. He's like 10 years older than me, so you always wanna be around your cool brother and hang out, so I grew up loving Guns N' Roses. I was all about Metallica. I was all about all those bands, and I still am. I love Aerosmith and No Doubt. I have so many influences on me that are so different. And even country. I love Reba McEntire. I could listen to her all the time.|$|E
500|$|Ice-T {{introduced}} the band at Lollapalooza in 1991, devoting {{half of his}} set to his hip hop songs, and half to Body Count songs, increasing his appeal with both alternative rock fans and middle-class teenagers. Many considered the Body Count performances to be {{the highlight of the}} tour. The group made its first album appearance on Ice-T's 1991 solo album O.G. Original Gangster. The song [...] "Body Count" [...] was preceded by a staged interview in which the performer referred to the group as a [...] "black hardcore band," [...] stating that [...] "as far as I'm concerned, music is music. I don't look at it as rock, R & B, or <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> stuff. I just look at it as music. [...] I do what I like and I happen to like rock 'n' roll, and I feel sorry for anybody who only listens to one form of music." ...|$|E

500|$|On February 12, 2012, Lil' Wayne {{said that}} Christina Milian had joined Young Money, and will release her fourth album through Young Money Entertainment. The next day, a song titled [...] "Mr. Valentine" [...] leaked onto the internet. Milian told Carson Daly on 97.1 AMP Radio. [...] "Yeah, I've signed with Young Money. It was pretty awesome. This weekend {{we had a}} big party, a big YMCMB party, and Drake was {{performing}} and we were all up on the stage and Wayne got up there and he announced it himself. And so I was kind of surprised and I was like, 'Oh my gosh, this is awesome!'" [...] Milian is currently recording her fourth album. [...] "We're just getting started on it," [...] she said. [...] "I've already halfway gotten there and when my mom and I went to Wayne and we played him some of the music, off the second song, he was like, 'I love it. Let's do this deal.' I have some music that's already going to be on it and the second half I'm working with them now. [...] When they did a little background check, they saw even the songwriting, <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> stuff adds on top of, alright, she's an actress, she's a pretty face, she can actually sing, but not to mention she's a songwriter. I thought that was cool that they even saw that. [...] They all get on each other's records, so all I have to do is be home with everybody and we'll just do lots of features." ...|$|E
2500|$|Danielson {{described}} himself in ranking {{in the bottom}} 1 percentile for ambition in a personality test WWE gave him. In response, he said, [...] "I have no ambition for what society says is important as far as things like money, and <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> stuff. What I am ambitious about is I {{want to be the}} best wrestler that I can possibly be." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ferguson {{refused to}} give {{interviews}} to the BBC after a documentary called Fergie and Son was shown on BBC Three on 27 May 2004. According to an article in The Independent newspaper, the documentary had [...] "portrayed his agent son, Jason, as somebody who exploited his father's influence and position to his own ends in the transfer market". The same newspaper article {{made it clear that}} [...] "Ferguson Jnr" [...] was never found guilty of any wrongdoing, and it quoted Ferguson Senior as follows: [...] "They [...] did a story about my son that was whole lot of nonsense. It all [...] made-up stuff and 'brown paper bags' and <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> carry-on. It was a horrible attack on my son's honour and he should never have been accused of that." [...] Subsequent interviews on BBC programmes such as Match of the Day were done by his assistant Carlos Queiroz, and later Mike Phelan.|$|E

2500|$|... “Fearless is a {{statement}} against {{the current level of}} anxiety that's being sold by the loudest voices in our culture... But I've also been inspired by the stories of Christians in parts of India. A missionary our church supports tells us about many who are baptized there in spite of being shunned by family or even endangering their live. That's being fearless. We <b>all</b> need <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> courage.” ...|$|R
2500|$|In a {{subsequent}} teaching, [...] "What has {{happened after the}} 'Strange Fire' Conference" [...] (2013), MacArthur allowed that within the Charismatic movement {{there were those who}} believed in the authority of Scripture, honored the Lord, and pursued Godly living, and that the movement retained enough gospel truth so that souls could be saved within it. However, he saw its interdenominational presence as being [...] "a testimony to the absence of any theology," [...] and charged that [...] "its theology is both heterodox and heretical...everything is defined by experience..and therefore has a weak view of Scripture, that's the charismatic movement." [...] He further criticized the modern Charismatic movement, stating that [...] "In 1967 a bunch of Jesus freak people in the beach areas of Southern California go to Calvary Chapel..and for the first time, the church, that I know of in history, the church lets the very defined subculture dictate what it will be. Out go the ties, out go the hymns, out go all the normal and formal things...and the hippie culture, you know, kids coming out of drugs, communal living, free sex, and <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> casual thing, and that's a charismatic church, that's a four-square church...That's where the movement becomes what we know as Calvary Chapel." [...] "The first Calvary Chapel was essentially the church saying we'll let the culture tell us what we need to be...The charismatic movement has developed...its comfortable in Roman Catholicism, its comfortable in dead denominationalism...I thinks its a false form of Christianity." ...|$|E

As described by mall spokeswoman Paula Newhold: [...] "It was revolutionary to have a mall and to have late-night shopping and <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> stuff <b>that</b> is just quite normal for us now.
