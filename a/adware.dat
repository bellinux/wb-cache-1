5|$|Announced September 8, 2003, version 2004 adds <b>adware,</b> spyware, and {{keylogger}} protection. PC Magazine {{found the}} added protection to be weak. Out of the spyware samples Norton detected, {{a significant number}} were not removed completely, requiring manual removal. Norton also did little to prevent spyware infections.|$|E
5|$|Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE) is an {{antivirus}} software (AV) product that provides protection against {{different types of}} malicious software such as computer viruses, spyware, rootkits and Trojan horses. Before version 4.5, MSE ran on , Windows Vista and Windows 7, but not on Windows 8 and later, which have built-in AV components. MSE 4.5 and later do not run on Windows XP. The license agreement allows home users and small businesses to install and use the product free of charge. It replaces Windows Live OneCare, a discontinued commercial subscription-based AV service, and the free Windows Defender, which until Windows 8 protected users from only <b>adware</b> and spyware.|$|E
5|$|Microsoft Security Essentials is an {{antivirus}} software (AV) product that fights malicious software (malware), including computer viruses, spyware, Trojan horses and rootkits. It replaces Windows Live OneCare, a discontinued commercial subscription-based AV service, {{and the free}} Windows Defender, which until Windows 8 only protected users from <b>adware</b> and spyware. It automatically checks for and downloads the virus definitions it relies on from Microsoft Update, a web-based software service updated three times a day. Users may alternatively download the updates manually from the Microsoft Security Portal website. On 30 September 2011, a faulty definition update caused the product to incorrectly tag Google Chrome as malware. The issue was resolved within three hours. MSE originally ran on Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7, although versions 4.5 and later do not run on Windows XP and Microsoft stopped producing definition updates for Windows XP on 14 July 2015.|$|E
5|$|In October 2009, AV-TEST {{conducted}} {{a series of}} trials on the final build of the product in which it detected and caught 98.44 percent of 545,034 computer viruses, computer worms and software Trojan horses as well as 90.95 percent of 14,222 spyware and <b>adware</b> samples. It also detected and eliminated all 25 tested rootkits, generating no false-positives. Between June 2010 to January 2013, AV-TEST tested Microsoft Security Essentials 14 times; in 11 out of 14 cases, MSE secured AV-TEST certification of outperforming AV industry average ratings. Microsoft Security Essentials 2.0 was tested and certified on March 2011. The product achieved a protection score of 2.5 out of 6, a repair score of 3.5 out of 6 and a usability score of 5.5 out of 6. Report details show that although version 2.0 was able to find all malware samples of the WildList (widespread malware), it was not able to stop all Internet-based attacks because it lacks personal firewall and anti-spam capabilities. In an April 2012 test, version 2.1 achieved scores of 3.0, 5.5 and 5.0 for protection, repair and usability. Version 4.0 for Windows 7 SP1 (x64) was tested in June 2012 and achieved scores of 2.5, 5.5 and 5.5 for protection, repair and usability. In October 2012, the product lost its AV-TEST certification when Microsoft Security Essentials 4.1 achieved scores of 1.5, 3.5 and 5.5 for its protection, repair and usability.|$|E
25|$|Although {{it differs}} from spyware, <b>adware</b> often {{uses the same}} methods and technologies. Merchants {{initially}} were uninformed about <b>adware,</b> what impact it had, and how it could damage their brands. Affiliate marketers {{became aware of the}} issue much more quickly, especially because they noticed that <b>adware</b> often overwrites tracking cookies, thus resulting in a decline of commissions. Affiliates not employing <b>adware</b> felt that it was stealing commission from them. <b>Adware</b> often has no valuable purpose and rarely provides any useful content to the user, who is typically unaware that such software is installed on his/her computer.|$|E
25|$|Affiliates {{discussed}} {{the issues in}} Internet forums and began to organize their efforts. They believed {{that the best way}} to address the problem was to discourage merchants from advertising via <b>adware.</b> Merchants that were either indifferent to or supportive of <b>adware</b> were exposed by affiliates, thus damaging those merchants' reputations and tarnishing their affiliate marketing efforts. Many affiliates either terminated the use of such merchants or switched to a competitor's affiliate program. Eventually, affiliate networks were also forced by merchants and affiliates to take a stand and ban certain <b>adware</b> publishers from their network. The result was Code of Conduct by Commission Junction/beFree and Performics, LinkShare's Anti-Predatory Advertising Addendum, and ShareASale's complete ban of software applications as a medium for affiliates to promote advertiser offers. Regardless of the progress made, <b>adware</b> continues to be an issue, as demonstrated by the class action lawsuit against ValueClick and its daughter company Commission Junction filed on April 20, 2007.|$|E
25|$|In July 2015, Malwarebytes {{acquired}} AdwareMedic {{and released}} Malwarebytes Anti-Malware for Mac, which detects malware, <b>adware,</b> and potentially unwanted programs on Macintosh computers.|$|E
25|$|Malwarebytes {{also has}} {{numerous}} {{tools such as}} a Junkware Removal Tool to remove <b>adware,</b> an Anti-Rootkit Beta to remove and repair rootkits, StartUpLITE to boost {{the speed of the}} Windows reboot and FileASSASSIN to prevent locked files.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of Galeon's creation, the most popular Linux browsers, {{including}} Netscape and Mozilla, were large multi-functional programs. This made them slow to start and often impractical due to their high memory usage and processor requirements. Opera was somewhat faster, but it was proprietary software distributed in trialware and <b>adware</b> versions, both of which lacked some of the functionality of the Microsoft Windows version.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{emergence}} of affiliate marketing, {{there has been little}} control over affiliate activity. Unscrupulous affiliates have used spam, false advertising, forced clicks (to get tracking cookies set on users' computers), <b>adware,</b> and other methods to drive traffic to their sponsors. Although many affiliate programs have terms of service that contain rules against spam, this marketing method has historically proven to attract abuse from spammers.|$|E

This monitors computer systems for suspicious activity such as computer viruses, spyware, <b>adware,</b> and other malicious objects in 'real-time', in other words while data loaded into the computer's active memory: when inserting a CD, opening an email, or browsing the web, or when a file already on the computer is opened or executed.|$|E
500|$|Movieland {{said the}} pop-ups were [...] "an anti-fraud mechanism" [...] that cannot be {{received}} without consumers intentionally downloading the software through several intentional steps, {{each of which}} has a default setting of [...] "cancel".

2500|$|In February 2015, after media {{reported}} the hidden pre-installation of Superfish <b>adware</b> on some Lenovo notebooks, a researcher found a trusted root certificate on affected Lenovo machines to be insecure, as the keys {{could easily be}} accessed using the company name, Komodia, as a passphrase. [...] The Komodia library was designed to intercept client-side TLS/SSL traffic for parental control and surveillance, {{but it was also}} used in numerous <b>adware</b> programs, including Superfish, that were often surreptitiously installed unbeknownst to the computer user. In turn, these potentially unwanted programs installed the corrupt root certificate, allowing attackers to completely control web traffic and confirm false web sites as authentic.|$|E
2500|$|Conduit {{was founded}} in 2005 by Shilo, Dror Erez, and Gaby Bilcyzk. Between years 2005 and 2013, it ran a {{successful}} but controversial toolbar platform business. [...] This toolbar is flagged by most antivirus software as potentially unwanted and <b>adware.</b> Conduit's toolbar software is often downloaded by malware packages from other publishers.|$|E
2500|$|Past {{versions}} of RealPlayer {{have been criticized}} for containing <b>adware</b> and spyware. In 1999 security researcher Richard M. Smith dissected some of RealJukebox's network traffic and discovered that it was sending a unique identifier with information about the music titles to which its users were listening. [...] RealNetworks issued a patch, and the spyware was removed in version 1.02. Their download page stated RealJukebox included privacy enhancements and gave a link to the privacy policy.|$|E
2500|$|In September, Proofpoint, Inc. CEO Gary Steele {{joined the}} company's Board of Directors, with Kleczynski citing his [...] "deep {{expertise}} in the security software industry, and his proven ability [...] increasing sales revenue" [...] as {{the main reasons for}} his appointment. In October the company purchased AdwCleaner, a Windows program used to clean <b>adware</b> from computers. In February 2017 the company acquired Saferbytes, an Italian security start-up specialized in anti-malware, anti-exploit, anti-rootkit, cloud AV, and sandbox technologies.|$|E
2500|$|Internet Explorer {{has been}} {{subjected}} to many security vulnerabilities and concerns: much of the spyware, <b>adware,</b> and computer viruses across the Internet are made possible by exploitable bugs and flaws in the security architecture of Internet Explorer, sometimes requiring nothing more than viewing of a malicious web page in order to install themselves. This is known as a [...] "drive-by install". There are also attempts to trick the user into installing malicious software by misrepresenting the software's true purpose in the description section of an ActiveX security alert.|$|E
2500|$|Antivirus {{software}} was originally developed {{to detect and}} remove computer viruses, hence the name. However, {{with the proliferation of}} other kinds of malware, antivirus software started to provide protection from other computer threats. In particular, modern antivirus software can protect from: malicious browser helper objects (BHOs), browser hijackers, ransomware, keyloggers, backdoors, rootkits, trojan horses, worms, malicious LSPs, dialers, fraudtools, <b>adware</b> and spyware. Some products also include protection from other computer threats, such as infected and malicious URLs, spam, scam and phishing attacks, online identity (privacy), online banking attacks, social engineering techniques, advanced persistent threat (APT) and [...] botnet DDoS attacks.|$|E
2500|$|The Electronic Frontier Foundation {{criticized the}} case, stating {{that it was}} [...] "not to help [...] fight off <b>adware</b> and spyware" [...] but was rather {{intended}} to allow companies [...] "to gain control over [...] desktop", where the legal principles being employed [...] "would create a precedent that would enable trademark owners to dictate what could be open on your desktop when you visit their websites". [...] At {{the time of the}} appeal it filed an amicus curiae brief urging the Appeals Court to limit the reach of the [...] "initial interest confusion" [...] doctrine that had been applied by the District Court.|$|E
2500|$|GO Keyboard [...] virtual Android {{keyboard}} apps (GO Keyboard - Emoji {{keyboard and}} GO Keyboard - Emoticon keyboard) transmit personal information to its remote servers without explicit users' consent. This information includes user's Google account email, language, IMSI, location, network type, Android version and build, and device's model and screen size. The apps also download and execute a code from a remote server, breaching the Malicious Behavior {{section of the}} Google Play privacy policies. Some of these plugins are detected as <b>Adware</b> or PUP by many Anti-Virus engines, while the developer, a Chinese company GOMO Dev Team, claims in the apps' description that they will never collect personal data including credit card information. The apps with about 2 million users in total were caught on spying on September 2017 by security researches from AdGuard who then reported their findings to Google.|$|E
5000|$|When {{the term}} is used in this way, the {{severity}} of its implication varies. While some sources rate <b>adware</b> only as an [...] "irritant", others classify it as an [...] "online threat" [...] or even rate it as seriously as computer viruses and trojans. The precise {{definition of the term}} in this context also varies. <b>Adware</b> that observes the computer user's activities without their consent and reports it to the software's author is called spyware. However most <b>adware</b> operates legally and some <b>adware</b> manufacturers have even sued antivirus companies for blocking <b>adware.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Download Valley is {{a cluster}} of {{software}} companies in Israel, producing and delivering <b>adware</b> to be installed alongside downloads of other software. [...] The primary purpose is to monetize free software and downloads. These software items are commonly browser toolbars, <b>adware,</b> browser hijackers, spyware, and malware. Another group of products are download managers, possibly designed to induce or trick the user to install <b>adware,</b> when downloading a piece of desired software or mobile app from a certain source.|$|E
50|$|<b>Adware</b> is {{software}} that, once installed, automatically displays advertisements on a user's computer.

5000|$|ContextPlus {{shut down}} its {{operations}} in May 2006 and stated they were [...] "no {{longer able to}} ensure the highest standards of quality and customer care". The shutdown came after several major lawsuits against <b>adware</b> vendors had been launched. By September 2007, 121Media had become known as Phorm, and admitted a company history in <b>adware</b> and stated it had closed down the multimillion-dollar revenue stream from its PeopleOnPage toolbar, citing consumers’ identification of <b>adware</b> with spyware as the primary cause for the decision.|$|E
