40|$|A {{range of}} ‘effect’ sizes already exists, for {{presenting}} a {{relatively easy to}} interpret estimate of a difference or change between two sets of observations. All are based on use of the standard deviation of the observations, involving squaring and then square-rooting, which makes results hard to interpret, hard to teach and may distort extreme scores. An effect size based on the simpler <b>mean</b> <b>absolute</b> <b>deviation</b> overcomes these issues to some extent, while being at least as efficient and leading to the same substantive results in almost all cases. This paper proposes {{the use of an}} easy to comprehend effect size based on the mean difference between treatment groups, divided by their <b>mean</b> <b>absolute</b> <b>deviation.</b> Using a simulation of 1, 656 trials each of 100 cases using a before and after design, the paper shows that the substantive findings from any such trial would be the same whether a traditional effect size like Cohen’s d or the <b>mean</b> <b>absolute</b> <b>deviation</b> effect size is used.

40|$|Abstract. In {{the recent}} years the rapid {{prototyping}} technology has become increasingly important as a manufacturing method for many medical devices. Although the advantage of such technology is evident, a precise presentation of the actual anatomical parts as well as shape accuracy and surface quality is a major indicator for choosing the best technique. In this paper, evaluation and validation of the shape accuracy of fabricated models using Fused Deposition Modelling technique is presented. The surface deviation between anatomical models (a mandible) derived from Computed Tomography and their virtual presentation was investigated. A high level of conformity {{with regard to the}} surface feature of the anatomical part was observed. Furthermore, surface deviations in the range of ± 0. 5 mm with an <b>absolute</b> <b>mean</b> <b>deviation</b> of 0. 159 mm for the model were reported. The surface accuracies suggest that the reproduction of complex anatomical structures by FDM could potentially be used for surgical planning, custom-made implants and for surgical anatomy teaching...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new method for detecting differential item functioning (DIF), the unsigned Mantel-Haenszel (UMH) statistic, and compares this method {{with two other}} chi-square methods, the Mantel-Haenszel (MH) and the <b>absolute</b> <b>mean</b> <b>deviation</b> (AMD) statistics, in terms of power and agreement between expected and actual false positive rates. Three hundred datasets included items with uniform DIF; another 300 datasets included items with nonuniform DIF; and the other 300 datasets included items with both uniform and nonuniform DIF. All methods produced higher false positive rates than the theoretically expected false positive rates after application of a purification procedure. The second step of the purification procedure produced more false positives for the MH and UMH methods than the first step, but it reduced false positives for the AMID method. The two-step purification procedure also reduced power in most conditions for all three methods. (Contains 11 tables and 30 references.)

The flow from a manifold has many applications and in various fields of engineering such as civil, mechanical, and chemical engineering. In this study, physical and numerical models were employed to study the uniformity of the flow distribution from manifold with various configurations. The physical model consists of main manifold with uniform longitudinal section having diameter of 10. 16 [*]cm (4 [*]in), five laterals with diameter of 5. 08 [*]cm (2 [*]in), and spacing of 22 [*]cm. Different inlet flows were tested and the values of these flows are 500, 750, and 1000 [*]L/min. A manifold with tapered longitudinal section having inlet diameters of 10. 16 [*]cm (4 [*]in) and dead end diameter of 5. 08 [*]cm (2 [*]in) with the same above later specifications and flow rates was tested for its uniformity too.

40|$|Heating {{and cooling}} of {{buildings}} {{are responsible for}} {{a large percentage of}} world energy consumption. Today, ground source heat pumps offer one of the most energy efficient technologies to provide heating and cooling by using the renewable heat source of the building's surrounding ground volume. Primarily in Northern Europe these systems are becoming a common heating/cooling technology. Some currently available building simulation programs like TRNSYS or EnergyPlus have the ability to model them. In this paper a parameter estimation study of a water-to-water heat pump model, implemented in IDA-ICE simulation environment, is presented and validated using experimental data. The model is based on performance maps: user-supplied data files containing catalogue data for the delivered energy and power absorbed are based on the entering load and source temperatures. The simulation results show that, if the input parameters (e. g. heat pump typology and control operation) are known, the simulated heat-pump model corresponds closely with the experimental operation.

Patients with facial cleft defects, such as alveolar clefts, represent quite {{a challenge for}} the dental practitioner. These patients require a multidisciplinary care approach {{from the time they}} are born up until the anomaly is completely repaired. Many guidelines have been established to improve the treatment and closure of cleft defects. To this day, {{little is known about the}} trajectory taken by the nasopalatine canal (NPC) in cleft patients. The aim of this study is to describe the lateral deviation pattern of the NPC in alveolar cleft patients as compared to sex- and age-matched controls without such defects. Cone Beam Computed Tomography images (CBCT) of 29 unilateral cleft patients were evaluated and compared to a control group. The dimensions of the NPC and of the buccal alveolar process overlying the canal itself were also assessed. Among the 29 unilateral alveolar cleft patients observed in this investigation, 59 % occurred in males while 20 of 29 were on the left side. The NPC was significantly wider in a bucco-lingual dimension and slightly greater in a mesio-distal dimension in cleft patients than non-cleft patients. The width of the buccal alveolar process overlying the NPC was similar in both groups. Age was significantly and inversely associated with buccal alveolar bone width overlying the NPC in cleft patients, but not in control patients. The mean lateral deviation of the NPC was non-significant when compared between the groups. However, the <b>absolute</b> <b>mean</b> <b>deviation</b> of the NPC was statistically different between the 2 groups.

40|$|Since {{reconstruction}} of composite defects {{in the head}} and neck region is a challenging and demanding problem for head and neck surgeons, surgical aids have been sought for decades. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of prefabricated surgical resection templates used in mandibular segmental resections in comparison to the virtual surgical plan. A prospective study was performed in 11 consecutive patients, with a primary T 4 oral squamous cell carcinoma or osteoradionecrosis of the mandible. Preoperatively, a CBCT scan was acquired to delineate the size and extension of tumor invasion; a virtual patient-specific resection template was designed based on this information. Intraoperatively, the resection template was positioned on the mandible and secured using four fixation screws. Postoperatively, a CBCT scan was acquired. This scan was superimposed on the preoperative scan. Positioning of the resection template and inclination of the resection planes were evaluated on the virtual head model. In order to test the interobserver reliability of these new measurement methods, two different observers executed all measurements. The mean shift of the proximal resection templates was 3. 76 mm (standard deviation [SD] 3. 10 mm). For the distal resection templates, the mean shift was 3. 06 mm (SD 1. 57 mm) with no significant interobserver difference (ICC = 0. 99). An <b>absolute</b> <b>mean</b> <b>deviation</b> of 8. 5 ° (SD 5. 3 °) was found for the proximal resection angle and 10. 4 ° (SD 5. 0 °) for the distal resection angle. Again, no significant interobserver differences were found (ICC = 0. 98). The resection templates used in this study proved reasonably accurate.
