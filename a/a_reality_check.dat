[...] This was then followed up by two successive 0-0 draws at home to Accrington Stanley and away to Stevenage. [...] Although these results seemed to suggest the Gulls had got their defensive house back in the order, they were now struggling to find the back of the net. [...] With summer signings Billy Kee and Martin Gritton yet to register on the goalscorer charts, and Elliot Benyon out injured for the Accrington game and on the bench for most of the Stevenage match, the Gulls were starting to look a little light up front, despite the best efforts of the versatile Chris Zebroski who was being employed as both winger and striker.|$|E

30|$|In {{situations}} where prequestions enhance learning, another reason they may {{do so is}} by providing <b>a</b> metacognitive <b>reality</b> <b>check</b> that reduces students’ overconfidence, in turn enhancing the effort and attention devoted to learning the material. The current study is the first known study to collect students’ confidence ratings {{at the time of}} the prequestion. After controlling for other relevant factors, we found no relationship between students’ initial confidence in their answer to the prequestion and later accuracy on that question. This result must be interpreted with caution, however, as we did not obtain an overall benefit of prequestions, and Bayesian analyses revealed only weak evidence for the lack of effects in the regression model. Further, it is possible that the metacognitive <b>reality</b> <b>check</b> may only be beneficial if the learning episode is brief enough to permit sustained effort and attention to the material, as discussed above. Future research is encouraged that explores the effects of prequestions under conditions of varying presentation durations, different instructional approaches, and individual student differences.|$|R

Researchers need to face the complexities of scaling up to programs that actually serve a purpose. The move from toy domains into concrete ones has three big consequences for the development of AI.

40|$|Several discourses on {{environment}} and sustainability are characterised by a strong confidence in the potential of technology to address, if not solve, the ecological impacts resulting from physically expanding systems of production and consumption. The optimism is further encouraged by leading environmental engineering concepts, including cradle-to-cradle and industrial ecology, as well as broader frameworks, such as natural capitalism and the circular economy. This paper explores the viability of their promise from a biophysical perspective, {{which is based on}} insights from system dynamics and thermodynamics. Such <b>an</b> ecological <b>reality</b> <b>check</b> is generally ignored or underestimated in the literature on aforementioned concepts and frameworks. The paper ultimately reflects on what role society can realistically assign to technology for resolving its ecological concerns.
