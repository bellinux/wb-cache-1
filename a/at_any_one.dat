5|$|Not {{all of the}} castles were {{occupied}} simultaneously.

5|$|The brain {{produces}} roughly 500mL of {{cerebrospinal fluid}} per day, {{at a rate}} of about 25mL an hour. This transcellular fluid is constantly reabsorbed, so that only 125–150mL is present <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>one</b> time.|$|E

5|$|American Samoa is a {{territory}} of the United States that lies in the South Pacific Ocean {{to the far east}} of Australia. The dependency's debut at the Olympics was at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. Between 1988 and 2008, American Samoa sent a delegation to participate at seven Olympic games (six Summer Olympics and one Winter Olympics), not missing a single Summer Olympics since its first time in the competition. In 2008, American Samoa's delegation was composed of four athletes, including two women, which is the greatest number of women to have competed for American Samoa <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>one</b> games.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 1,500 {{personnel}} {{are assigned to}} both HQ, Tennessee Air National Guard and to the 118 AW at Berry ANGB. Approximately 400 are full-time Active Guard and Reserve (AGR) and Air Reserve Technician (ART) personnel, augmented by approximately 1100 traditional part-time air guardsmen. Approximately 100 additional foreign military {{personnel are}} also temporarily assigned to the 118 AW <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>one</b> time for training in the C-130E or C-130H aircraft.|$|E
5|$|At {{the edge}} of the Greenstead Parish {{boundary}} is Rovers Tye Farm, which has been documented as being established by 1353. A new causeway at this location had been built by 1429, by which point Ipswich Road ran on its current route. This road was turnpiked in 1725, when the road was predominantly rural in nature. In 1841, a prison, known as the House of Correction or County Gaol, was built on the road to alleviate pressure on Colchester Castle, but it only held about 25 or 30 prisoners, both male and female, <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>one</b> time.|$|E

5|$|B.s. var.spinulosa 'Coastal Cushion' (= 'Schnapper Point') was {{originally}} collected by Neil Marriott and called 'Schnapper Point' {{from the same}} locality as 'Birthday Candles'. This is a more spreading plant to 50cm tall and up to 1.5–2m across with dark red-styled gold flowers (a couple of shades darker than 'Birthday Candles') 15cm high by 6cm across. It is propagated by Richard Anderson of Merricks Nursery. It {{appears to be more}} adaptable to points north than other dwarf forms – growing reliably in southeastern Queensland. This form can be very floriferous, with some plants sporting more than 40 inflorescences <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>one</b> time.|$|E
5|$|Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a clear, colorless {{body fluid}} {{found in the}} brain and spinal cord. It is {{produced}} in the choroid plexuses of the ventricles of the brain, and absorbed in the arachnoid granulations. There is about 125mL of CSF <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>one</b> time, and about 500mL is generated every day. CSF acts as a cushion or buffer for the brain, providing basic mechanical and immunological protection to the brain inside the skull. The CSF also serves a vital function in cerebral autoregulation of cerebral blood flow.|$|E
5|$|Estimates of the {{strength}} of the Polish Legions also vary and it is believed that between 20,000 and 30,000 men served in the Legions' ranks <b>at</b> <b>any</b> <b>one</b> time over the course of their existence. The WIEM Encyklopedia estimate is 21,000 for the period up to 1803. Davies suggests 25,000 for the period of up to 1802–1803, as does Magosci et al. Bideleux and Jeffries offer an estimate of up to 30,000 for the period up to 1801. Most of the soldiers came from the ranks of the peasantry, with only about 10 percent being drawn from the nobility.|$|E
