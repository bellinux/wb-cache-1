He flatly refused to talk about Whitehead, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> him why, he said: 'That SOB never paid me what he owed me. My father had a hauling {{business}} and I often hitched up the horses and helped Whitehead take his airplane to {{where he wanted to}} go. I will never give Whitehead credit for anything. I did a lot of work for him and he never paid me a dime.'" ...|$|E

I {{was fascinated by the}} richness and the abundance, with which the people live until today (1861), but that time there was even more expanse in everything. The hospitality was especially developed in Siberia. Everywhere we were received like being in friendly countries, everywhere we were fed well, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> how much I owed them, they didn't want to take anything, saying [...] "Put a candle to the God"." ...|$|E
2500|$|While on {{tour with}} L. du Garde's A Horse! A Horse!, Pinter {{found himself in}} Eastbourne without a place to stay. He met a {{stranger}} in a pub who said [...] "I can take you to some digs but I wouldn't recommend them exactly," [...] and then led Pinter to the house where he stayed. Pinter told his official biographer, Michael Billington, I went to these digs and found, in short, a very big woman who was the landlady and a little man, the landlord. There {{was no one else}} there, apart from a solitary lodger, and the digs were really quite filthy ... I slept in the attic with this man I'd met in the pub ... we shared the attic and there was a sofa over my bed ... propped up so I was looking at this sofa from which hairs and dust fell continuously. And I said to the man, [...] "What are you doing here?" [...] And he said, [...] "Oh well I used to be...I'm a pianist. I used to play in the concert-party here and I gave that up." ... The woman was really quite a voracious character, always tousled his head and tickled him and goosed him and wouldn't leave him alone at all. <b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> him why he stayed, he said, [...] "There's nowhere else to go." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "And {{now about}} the people here," [...] she went on. [...] "I find Fritz's father {{completely}} changed {{on the subject of}} Fritz's marriage. <b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> what it means, I am told that Madame Fontaine has set everything right, in the most wonderful manner, by saving Mr. Keller's life. Is this true?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, don't {{joke about}} it! This {{perpetual}} joking, I believe it's that that's wearing me out. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> {{come to you}} for a little comfort in circumstances that drive me almost distracted, you want to amuse Mrs. Bowen, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> to be allowed to share in the amusement, you laugh at me! If you don't understand it all, I'm sure I don't." ...|$|R

60|$|They'd make a face, but they'd swallow {{me right}} enough. <b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> {{them down to}} the best shoot in England they'd come to the {{conclusion}} that I agreed with them very well.|$|E
60|$|No, my friends, {{that is not}} {{the meaning}} of the text; <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> you, Have you obeyed the text? <b>I</b> do not <b>ask</b> you that question; but one which I believe is {{something}} far more spiritual and more deep, something at least which is far more heart-searching, and likely to prick a man's conscience, perhaps to make him angry with me who ask.|$|R
60|$|It is over, and {{the earth}} is filled in, and we turn to come away. Before us stands our house, so pretty and unchanged, so linked in my mind with the young idea of what is gone, that all my sorrow has been nothing to the sorrow it calls forth. But they take me on; and Mr. Chillip talks to me; <b>and</b> <b>when</b> we get home, puts some water to my lips; <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> his leave {{to go up to}} my room, dismisses me with the {{gentleness}} of a woman.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well,--yes. I {{have said}} as much as that, but I have never got an answer. <b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> did <b>ask</b> her, she merely left me. She is not much given to talking.' ...|$|R
6000|$|She was an earnest, hearty girl. She {{was always}} in a good humor, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> her to do anything, she assented in a bright, cheerful way, and in a loud tone full of good-fellowship, as though she would say: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And at this, that giant {{from whom}} {{the light of}} reason was {{withheld}} threw out his mighty arms {{and asked me to}} forgive him. <b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> him for what he should be forgiven he answered: `For being right.' ...|$|E
60|$|I forgave him, comforted him, revived him; {{but there}} were moments when the remembrance of what I had seen troubled me in secret, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> myself if I really possessed my husband's full {{confidence}} as he possessed mine.|$|E
60|$|He was {{standing}} close behind me, <b>and</b> nodded simply <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> him. <b>And</b> Will Fotheringay came forward.|$|R
6000|$|I get in {{talk with}} {{a young man who}} has taken the {{orthodox}} side in some debate. He is a stranger, but explains that he has inherited magical art from his father, and asks me to his rooms to see it in operation. He and a friend of his kill a black cock, and burn herbs in a big bowl, but nothing happens except that the friend repeats again and again, [...] "Oh, my God," [...] <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> him why he has said that, does not know that he has spoken; and I feel that there is something very evil in the room.|$|R
60|$|Here was an opportunity, perhaps, of {{discovering}} what the Minister {{had failed to}} remember {{when he had been}} speaking of this woman, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> had <b>asked</b> if he had ever offended her. I was especially careful in making my inquiries.|$|R
6000|$|... "I heard Hoffman {{singing a}} Polish song to little Roserl, {{the burden of}} which was, 'Ma drogha, Ma drogha,' <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> him to {{translate}} it, those two words meant, 'My darling.' How dare you, ungrateful creature that you are!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "DOCTOR IGNATIUS LOYOLA!" [...] {{says the}} groom of the chambers, who {{pretends to be}} a scholar; and in the little genlmn went. When safely housed, the other chap came; <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> him his name, said, in a thick, gobbling kind of voice: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I was {{a solitary}} boy, and found my only playmates {{in the woods}} and fields. I learned their worth, they saw my need, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> their friendship, gave it freely. Now we should go; you are very tired, let me help you." ...|$|E
60|$|He was {{speaking}} to himself rather than to me, for he started <b>and</b> seemed confused <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> him what he meant.|$|R
40|$|Ladies <b>and</b> gentlemen, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> {{what the}} {{customary}} procedure was for this ceremony, I {{was told that}} the person receiving the award habitually gave a little talk on the subject of his choice. Since futurology is familiar to me, I have chosen to speak of energy economists in the twenty-first century. ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, but {{you talk}} of a painful {{difference}} of opinion with your husband, <b>and</b> then, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> {{for information on the}} point, you bring out a valise. And only a few moments ago you reproached me for not being serious. I wonder who is the serious person of us two now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There isn't none," [...] said Uncle Beamish; [...] "they are ruther squinched up, if anything. And as to delirium, I couldn't see {{no signs}} of it, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> the old lady about the numbness, she said she didn't believe there had been any." ...|$|E
6000|$|As I {{lifted my}} hand to the bell, my little companion's dread of a beating revived in full force. He hid himself behind me; <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> what he was about, he answered, confidentially: [...] "Please stand between us, sir, when mother opens the door!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... " [...] . disloyalty and unscrupulousness! What {{have you}} ever done to make me loyal? You have no grip on this country. I {{had to take care}} of myself, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> for {{protection}} I was met with threats and contempt, and had Arab slander thrown in my face. I! a white man!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Lulu {{glared at}} him and said, in a voice of honey and aloes, [...] "I'm sure, papa dear, <b>I</b> don't <b>ask</b> very much of you, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> do <b>ask</b> just this one little thing that I'm sure anybody else {{would be glad to}} help me with and me doing my very best to make you happy--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd gladly come down, Howard, if {{it seemed}} to make the least {{difference}} to you," [...] said Honora. [...] "But {{all you do is}} to sit with your newspaper propped up and read the stock reports, <b>and</b> growl <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> you a polite question.

6000|$|She {{pressed her}} {{handkerchief}} against her face, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> {{she could speak}} firmly said, in the muffled voice that follows sobbing, [...] "I will not--if you will let me have my way--I promise you not to thrust myself forward again. I have never broken my word to you--how many have you broken to me? When you gave me the diamonds to wear you were not thinking of having another wife.

Everything is {{to be taken away}} from me, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> for a straw, a chip--you deny it me." [...] She had spoken rapidly, but after a little pause she said more slowly, her voice freed from its muffled tone: [...] "I will not bear to have it denied me." ...|$|R
6000|$|What [...] "fa√ßons mondaines" [...] he {{discovered}} in my present winter merino and plain white collar, I own it puzzled me to guess: <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> him, {{he said it}} was all made with too much attention to effect--and besides, [...] "had I not a bow of ribbon at my neck?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; I {{asked you}} to come, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> you I knew that I was wrong. Though I meant to be kind, I knew that I was unkind. I saw that my husband disapproved it, though he had not the heart to tell me so. I wish he had. I wish he had." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{then there}} was a little general {{conversation}} about the potato, for no one came in for {{a quarter of an hour}} or so. The priest said that they were as badly off in Limerick and Clare as we are here.

40|$|In {{the last}} but one census of the {{population}} in the US, I had to respond as a foreigner resident, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was <b>asked</b> about my race, I chose to answer the ways I had heard the activists {{of the civil rights movement}} used to do in the US, when color blindness was an important thing to fight for ‚Äì to ‚ÄúRACE‚Äù I added ‚ÄúHUMAN‚Äù [...] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why? because I am what I am, {{too easily}} led by circumstances, too entirely possessed by {{whatever}} hope, belief, or fear rules {{me for the}} hour. Give me a steadfast nature like your own and I will be as strong. I know I am weak, but I am not wilfully wicked; <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> you to be silent, it is because I want to save him from the pain of doubt, and try to teach myself to love him as I should.

I am all in all to him, while you, so strong, so self-reliant, can do without my love as you have done till now, and will soon outlive your sorrow {{for the loss of}} that which might have made us happy had I been more patient." ...|$|R
