50|$|<b>Allyl</b> <b>hexanoate</b> is {{an organic}} {{compound}} with the formula C5H11CO2CH2CH=CH2. It is colorless liquid, although commercial samples appear yellowish. It occurs naturally in pineapples.|$|E
50|$|<b>Allyl</b> <b>hexanoate</b> is {{employed}} principally {{in the formulation}} of pineapple flavors {{but it can also be}} used for peach and apricot essences and for apple blossom, peach blossom, and wisteria perfume compositions. It is an ingredient of some lipstick perfumes. It also adds a sweet juicy note to citrus flavors.|$|E
50|$|Flavors include blue raspberry, orange, lemon, {{strawberry}}, apple, cherry, watermelon, cinnamon, banana, peppermint, cotton candy, and grape {{of which}} strawberry and banana {{can be achieved}} with ethyl methylphenylglycidate and isoamyl acetate limonene, respectively. Malic acid {{can be used for}} apple flavor, <b>allyl</b> <b>hexanoate</b> for pineapple, ethyl propionate for fruit punch, cinnamic aldehyde for cinnamon and acetophenone for cherry. More unusual flavors such as berry, cola, lemon lime, peach, tropical fruit, pineapple, orange, or fruit punch can also be found, as well as novelty tastes such as bacon or popcorn. Bubble gum itself is the flavor of Pepto-Bismol or as others have found, cotton candy.|$|E
5000|$|Squashes {{labelled}} [...] "no added sugar" [...] are artificially sweetened, {{usually with}} aspartame, acesulfame K, saccharin or sucralose, {{which is much}} cheaper for the manufacturers than both HFCS and natural sugar. They are very low in calories, sometimes having as few as 4 per 100ml diluted, and they are marketed towards families seeking low calorie alternatives. They {{tend to be very}} low in fruit juice, as fruit juice contains natural sugars, so they usually also contain natural or artificial flavourings (isoamyl acetate for pear or banana, or mixed with malic acid to make an apple-like flavour, ethyl methylphenylglycidate for strawberry, octyl acetate for orange, <b>allyl</b> <b>hexanoate</b> for pineapple etc.) {{to make up for the}} lack of fruit juice taste.|$|E
40|$|One {{source of}} {{uncertainty}} in the {{estimation of dietary exposure}} to flavouring substances is the {{uncertainty in the}} occurrence and concentration levels of these substances naturally present or added to foodstuffs. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the variability of concentration levels of <b>allyl</b> <b>hexanoate,</b> considered as a case study, in two main food categories to which it is often added: pineapple juice-based beverages and yogurts containing pineapple. Thirty-four beverages and 29 yogurts, with pineapple fruit or juice and added flavourings declared as ingredients on the package, were purchased from the local market (in Rome) and analysed. Analytical methods based on the stir bar sorptive extraction (SBSE) technique for the isolation of the target analyte, and on GC-MS analysis for final determination, were developed for the two food categories. In beverages, <b>allyl</b> <b>hexanoate</b> concentrations ranged from less than 0. 01 to 16. 71 mg l(- 1), whereas in yogurts they ranged from 0. 02 to 89. 41 mg kg(- 1). Average concentrations in beverages and yogurts with pineapple as the main fruit ingredient (1. 91 mg l(- 1) for beverages, 9. 61 mg kg(- 1) for yogurts) were in fair agreement with average use level data reported from industry surveys for the relevant food categories (4. 5 and 6. 0 mg kg(- 1), respectively). Within the group of yogurts a single product was found to contain a level of <b>allyl</b> <b>hexanoate</b> more than 10 -fold higher than the average reported use level. The screening techniques developed by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) using use level data provided by industry gave estimates of exposure that were of the same order of magnitude as the estimates obtained for regular consumers who would be loyal to the pineapple yogurt and beverage products containing the highest observed concentration of the substance of interest. In this specific case the uncertainty in the results obtained with the use of standard screening techniques for exposure assessment based on industry reported use levels is low...|$|E
40|$|Metathesis of allyl acetate, allyl {{propionate}} and <b>allyl</b> <b>hexanoate</b> {{was carried out}} using the heterogenized form of methyl trioxorhenium (MTO) and homogeneous and heterogeneous forms of Grubbs 2 nd (G), Hoveyda-Grubbs 2 nd (H-G) generation catalysts. In all cases {{it was found that}} the reaction rate and total achieved conversion increased with increasing length of chain of the substrate. A comparison of all used catalysts showed that homogeneous Ru carbene catalysts are significantly more active compared to MTO. In the heterogeneous arrangement Grubbs 2 nd generation and Hoveyda-Grubbs 2 nd generation catalysts are more predisposed for deactivation by solvent. The results obtained using the heterogeneous form of the Hoveyda –Grubbs 2 nd generation catalyst were comparable to the best results obtained using MTO. Moreover, when using MTO the selectivity to but- 2 -ene- 1, 4 -diyl dialkylate was in all cases 100 %. Keywords...|$|E
40|$|The {{first step}} of odor {{perception}} is an interaction between odorants and olfactory receptors (ORs) [1]. It is now accepted that the main strategy used by Humans to perceive thousands of odors results from a combinatorial coding [2]. Moreover, odors we perceived in our environment are mainly the result of mixtures of odorants; however, the processes involved remain poorly understood [3]. In previous studies performed in the CSGA of Dijon[4, 5], the perception of a mixture of specific proportions of ethyl isobutyrate (Et-iB, strawberry-like odor) and ethyl maltol (Et-M, caramel-like odor) was investigated in comparison with a reference (<b>allyl</b> <b>hexanoate,</b> Al-H, pineapple-like odor) chosen to evoke an odor close to the one expected in the mixture. The binary specific mixture of Et-iB and Et-M was judged as more typical of a pineapple odor than the individual components, whereas Al-H constitutes a good pineapple odor reference. Assuming that combinations of activated ORs encode odor qualities and that molecules sharing a same odorant quality possess common structural molecular property [6, 7], our assumption was that molecules sharing strawberry, caramel or pineapple odor should also share several common structural characteristics. We used Common Feature Pharmacophore Generation protocol (Discovery Studio 4. 1, Biovia) to generate pharmacophore hypotheses [8]; {{the maximum number of}} generated hypothesis for each run was set to 10. In our study, the pharmacophoric features considered are hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA) and hydrophobic regions (HY). On the one hand, pharmacophore generation performed with the three molecules allowed to obtain 10 hypotheses, and the best model is made up of 2 HY and 2 HBA. On the other hand, the best models obtained on each molecule (all conformers in a range 0 - 20 kcal/mol) are made up of at least 1 HY and 2 HBA. Side-by-side comparisons of pharmacophores reveal inter-features distance commonalities. By performing three tests by mapping of each molecules pair on the pharmacophore of the third molecule, we obtained good fit values for mapping of Et-M and Al-H on Et-iB model (3. 9 - 2. 3; the smallest values correspond to the mapping of Et-M conformers) and for mapping of Et-iB and Al-H on Et-M model (2. 8 - 2. 5; the smallest values correspond to the mapping of Et-iB conformers). Conversely, none of Et-M conformers and only half of Et-iB conformers map on Al-H model and fit values do not exceed 2. Taken together, these results suggest that a common binding site could exist for the three molecules, and Al-H could also bind on sites of Et-iB and Et-M. This is in good accordance with the schema of combinatorial coding [2], that is to say that each of the odor quality results from activation of a pattern of ORs. The existence of an intersection of these ORs patterns supports the hypothesis that molecules involved in a mixture that elicits an emergent odor, recognize a common set of ORs. References 1.
