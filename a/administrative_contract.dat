Ao se partir da premissa de que um contrato administrativo, tal como qualquer outro ato jurídico, introduz normas jurídicas no sistema jurídico-positivo, será preciso antes de tudo saber quando uma norma existe para o ordenamento jurídico, bem como quando ela será considerada válida ou inválida. Além disso, será importante apontar o sentido do termo eficácia. Em seguida, indicar-se-á o conceito de contrato administrativo a ser adotado neste trabalho, procurando analisá-lo a partir dos elementos e pressupostos do ato administrativo, o que se revelará bastante útil ao se estudar a convalidação dos contratos administrativos inválidos. Depois de se apresentar o conceito de invalidade e suas espécies no direito brasileiro, abordar-se-á as hipóteses de manutenção, no direito positivo, dos contratos administrativos inválidos, quais sejam, a convalidação, a conversão e o saneamento.

Due to the French origin of the theory and {{to the fact that}} this Article is addressed to an American readership, a tentative comparison with the main legal rules on the subject of these two countries will be offered. A discussion of the practical consequences of the application of the <b>administrative</b> <b>contract</b> doctrine, and some possible solutions to the problems created thereby will be then put forward. But first, the basic issues that this doctrine gives rise to will be defined and the French origin of the concept of contract administratif and its reception in Argentina will be explained. The analysis offered will be limited to the general substantive legal regime of Government contracts leaving aside the issues arising from the contracting procedure, i. e., the rules on competitive bidding. To the extent that this substantive regime results from laws and regulations, only those directly applicable to Government contracts shall be considered. Thus, the analysis will only deal tangentially with the impact on these contracts of the exercise of public powers granted by statutes that may affect indirectly the performance of the private contractor. Since such statutes may reach all Government contracts and not only those defined as “administrative” (unless a tautological definition is used, i. e., one that characterizes as “administrative” only those Government contracts that can be reached by laws granting regulatory or police powers to the Government), it may be argued that the issues raised by those statutes lie outside the scope of the doctrine of the <b>administrative</b> <b>contract.</b> Therefore, the issue of the conflict between the legislative powers of the State and the principle of the sanctity of the contract shall not be treated...|$|E

Due to more permissive regulations, until the moment the G. E.
