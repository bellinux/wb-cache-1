40|$|<b>Antifriction</b> <b>bearing</b> {{failure is}} a major factor in failure of {{rotating}} machinery. As a fatal defect is detected, it is common to shut down the machinery as soon as possible to avoid catastrophic damages. Performing such an action, which usually occurs at inconvenient times, typically results in substantial time and economical losses. It is, therefore, important to monitor the condition of <b>antifriction</b> <b>bearings</b> and to know the details of severity of defects before they cause serious catastrophic consequences. The vibration monitoring technique is suitable to analyze various defects in bearing. This technique can provide early information about progressing malfunctions. This paper describes the suitability of vibration monitoring and analysis techniques to detect defects in <b>antifriction</b> <b>bearings.</b> Time domain analysis, frequency domain analysis and spike energy analysis have been employed to identify different defects in bearings. The results have demonstrated that each one of these techniques is useful to detect problems in <b>antifriction</b> <b>bearings...</b>|$|R

40|$|Traditional ingot {{metallurgy}} {{was pushed}} to the limit for many demanding applications including <b>antifriction</b> <b>bearings.</b> New systems require corrosion resistance, better fatigue resistance, and higher toughness. With conventional processing, increasing the alloying level to achieve corrosion resistance results in a decrease in other properties such as toughness. Advanced powder metallurgy affords a viable solution to this problem. During powder manufacture, the individual particle solidifies very rapidly; as a consequence, the primary carbides are very small and uniformly distributed. When properly consolidated, this uniform structure is preserved while generating a fully dense product. Element tests including rolling contact fatigue, hot hardness, wear, fracture toughness, and corrosion resistance are underway on eleven candidate P/M bearing alloys and results are compared with those for wrought 440 C steel, the current SSME bearing material.

Extreme operating conditions, counterfeit or inferior quality bearings, inadequate lubrication, etc often lead to bearing failures. Each rolling contact bearing failure leaves traces of evidences on what caused its failure. Failure analysis of one such bearing {{is the subject of}} this paper. One of the engine ground tests was aborted due to the failure of a self aligning deep groove ball bearing used in turbo-pump of a liquid rocket engine. Series of engine ground tests are conducted as a part of injector acceptance for a liquid rocket engine. The bearing failure occurred in the seventh engine test of one of such series of ground tests. The bearing mentioned here is made of SAE 52100 steel. Post-test hardware inspection revealed that the bearing and the dynamic seals on either side of the bearing are in failed condition. Inner race of bearing was found blackish in appearance with indentation and corrosion marks. Localized black spots were observed in outer race. Bearing balls were found in deformed condition.

40|$|Squeeze film dampers are novel rotor dynamic devices used to {{alleviate}} small amplitude, large force vibrations {{and are used}} in conjunction with <b>antifriction</b> <b>bearings</b> in aircraft jet engine bearings to provide external damping as these possess very little inherent damping. Electrorheological (ER) fluids are controllable fluids in which the rheological properties of the fluid, particularly viscosity, can be controlled in accordance with the requirements of the rotor dynamic system by controlling the intensity of the applied electric field and this property can be utilized in squeeze film dampers, to provide variable stiffness and damping at a particular excitation frequency. The paper investigates the effect of temperature and electric field on the apparent viscosity and dynamic (stiffness and damping characteristics) of ER fluid (suspension of diatomite in transformer oil) using the available literature. These characteristics increase with the field as the viscosity increases with the field. However, these characteristics decrease with increase in temperature and shear strain rate as the viscosity of the fluid decreases with temperature and shear strain rate. The temperature is an important parameter as the aircraft jet engine rotors are located in a zone of high temperature gradients and the damper fluid is susceptible to large variations in temperature...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{the work}} is to develop a method for {{measuring}} the radial clearance of mounted <b>antifriction</b> <b>bearings</b> in an automatically and standardized way. The measurement of the radial clearance should take place on bearings mounted on a shaft before and after assembling. Based on this method a measurement setup was constructed which enables to measure the radial clearance of different types of bearings with different dimensions. First tests were done with roller bearings as well as ball bearings with different dimensions. Results of those tests show, that the developed system provides as good or better results than the manual test method for measuring the radial clearance of a bearing by hand. The measuring process itself runs automatically. The results are reliable, independent form the user and reproducible. Furthermore the whole assembling of the bearings on a shaft should be automated without to interrupt the process of mounting in order to measure the radial clearance. Based on the results of the measurements, the process of assembling could be readjusted. By using this closed loop method, it will be achieved that bearings will be mounted on a shaft with the specified radial clearance which is defined by the technical designer. A further part of this work is the automated documentation of the parameters which are connected with the process of assembling. During the assembling all important parameters will be measured automatically. In parallel they will be written to a database. Afterwards a protocol will be generated automatically, which could also be used as dimensional data sheet for each individual assembled bearing. A perfect traceability is than possible...|$|R

These tests {{are believed to be}} the first in the world to rotate a full three piece bogie with track twist loads applied to the wagon-bogie system. The lab testing expands on the simulation studies reported at the last CORE. The objectives of the project 82 laboratory test program were to validate the behaviours of centre bowl friction force occurring during curve transitions as identified in previous simulation studies. The testing included: <b>Centre</b> <b>bearing</b> longitudinal movement in transitions due to track twist loads, or the walking motion of the <b>centre</b> <b>bearing</b> that generates rim contact and adds rim contact rotational resistance [and] Change in the effective radius of friction rotation for the <b>centre</b> <b>bearing</b> due to <b>centre</b> <b>bearing</b> tilt from track twist, and the additional change in the rotational centre when rim contact occurs. Results include the effective centre of rotation and frictional effective radius in the centre bow as altered with pitching force on the bogie. The testing results show that no sliding movement occurs at the CCSB’s until large curving rotations of the bolster occur due to the low elastic stiffness of the CCSB resilient blocks.

Gas seal separates the fluid end from the power end, thus allowing infinite dry running operation and solids-handling capability to 40 percent particulates. Since the back end is separated, fluid-lubricated journal bearings are not required, and <b>antifriction</b> ball <b>bearings,</b> are used instead providing stiff rotor construction, with (L^ 3) /(D^ 4) ratio as low as 9. 3, which significantly minimizes deflections of the shaft.

Installation of the gas barrier design improved the mean time between failure for a tough application at a major chemical plant from six days to two years, and the pump continues to operate successfully.
