500|$|The play {{had a good}} initial run, {{although}} Horner's trick and {{the notorious}} china scene immediately raised offence. Wycherley laughed off such criticisms in his next play, The Plain Dealer (1676), where he has the hypocritical Olivia exclaim that the china scene in The Country Wife [...] "has quite taken away the reputation of poor china itself, and sullied the most innocent and pretty furniture of a lady's chamber". Olivia's sensible cousin Eliza insists that she'll go see The Country Wife anyway: [...] "All this will not put me out of conceit with china, nor the play, which is acted today, {{or another of the}} same beastly author's, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>call</b> him, which I'll go see." [...] Writing himself into The Plain Dealer as the [...] "beastly author" [...] of the china scene, Wycherley seems more amused than repentant. The Country Wife did in fact survive the complaints to become a dependable repertory play from 1675 till the mid-1740s, but by then public taste had changed too much to put up with the sex jokes any longer. Its last eighteenth century performance in 1753 was followed by a hiatus of 171 years, until the successful Phoenix Society production in 1924 at the Regent Theatre in London. The first-ever American performance of Wycherley's original Country Wife took place in 1931.|$|E
2500|$|Anthony Nutting {{recalled}} that Eden told him, [...] "What's all this nonsense about isolating Nasser or 'neutralising' him <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>call</b> it? I want him destroyed, can't you understand? I want him murdered, {{and if you}} and the Foreign Office don't agree, then you'd better come to the cabinet and explain why." [...] When Nutting pointed out {{that they had no}} alternative government to replace Nasser, Eden apparently replied, [...] "I don't give a damn if there's anarchy and chaos in Egypt." [...] At a private meeting at Downing Street on 16 October 1956 Eden showed several ministers a plan, submitted two days earlier by the French. Israel would invade Egypt, Britain and France would give an ultimatum telling both sides to stop and, when one refused, send in forces to enforce the ultimatum, separate the two sides – and occupy the Canal and get rid of Nasser. When Nutting suggested the Americans should be consulted Eden replied, [...] "I will not bring the Americans into this ... Dulles has done enough damage as it is. This {{has nothing to do with}} the Americans. We and the French must decide what to do and we alone." [...] Eden openly admitted his view of the crisis was shaped by his experiences in the two world wars, writing, [...] "We are all marked to some extent by the stamp of our generation, mine is that of the assassination in Sarajevo and all that flowed from it. It is impossible to read the record now and not feel that we had a responsibility for always being a lap behind ... Always a lap behind, a fatal lap." ...|$|E
2500|$|Both {{the film}} and the play take {{dramatic}} license with the on-air and behind-the-scene details of The Nixon Interviews. [...] Jonathan Aitken, one of Nixon's official biographers who spent much time with the former president at La Casa Pacifica, rebukes the film for its portrayal of a drunken Nixon making a late-night phone call as never having happened and says it is [...] "from start to finish, an artistic invention by the scriptwriter Peter Morgan." [...] Director Ron Howard discussed the scene in detail on his feature commentary for the DVD release, pointing out it was a deliberate act of dramatic license, and while Frost never received such a phone call, [...] "it was known that Richard Nixon, during ...the Watergate scandal, had occasionally made midnight phone calls that he couldn't very well recall the following day." [...] Aitken recalls that [...] "Frost did not ambush Nixon during the final interview into a damaging admission of guilt. What the former president 'confessed' about Watergate was carefully pre-planned. It was only with considerable help and advice from his adversary's team that Frost managed to get much more out of Nixon, in the closing sequences, by reining in his fierce attitude and adopting a gentler approach." [...] Elizabeth Drew of the Huffington Post and author of Richard M. Nixon (2007) noted some inaccuracies, including a misrepresentation {{of the end of}} the interviews, the failure to mention the fact that Nixon received 20% of the profits from the interviews, and what she says are inaccurate representations of some of the characters. Drew points out a critical line in the movie that is particularly deceptive: Nixon admitted he [...] "'...was involved in a 'cover-up,' <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>call</b> it.' The ellipsis is of course unknown to the audience, and is crucial: What Nixon actually said was, 'You're wanting me to say that I participated in an illegal cover-up. No!'" ...|$|E
