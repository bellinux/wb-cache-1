5|$|Sélestat {{was first}} {{mentioned}} in 727 AD but the town probably has an earlier Celtic or Roman origin. Archaeological findings {{provide evidence of}} human settlement during the Mesolithic, the Neolithic and the Bronze Age. A large number of wood piles dating from the 1st and 2nd centuries AD were discovered around St. Quirin chapel, suggesting a Roman settlement. At that time Sélestat might have <b>already</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> port on the river Ill.|$|E

Waters had <b>already</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> well-known blues musician across Europe and the United States in the '50s. His successful performances with his electric blues band, consisting of his half-brother Otis Spann (piano, vocals), Pat Hare (guitar), James Cotton (harmonica), Andrew Stevens (bass) and Francis Clay (drums), increasingly popularized the blues in mainstream music in the United States and Europe, especially among white audiences.|$|E
5|$|Bordeaux was an {{important}} port for the German war effort, receiving {{a great deal of}} cargo, mostly raw materials, from overseas. It was also a major naval base, with huge submarine pens for U-boats. The Gironde estuary and Bordeaux had <b>already</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> target for the Allies. Operation Frankton was a 1942 commando raid targeting important shipping in the port. In January 1944, the Allies intercepted communications indicating that German commanders were concerned by the possibility of landings in the Bay of Biscay region of France. The next month, German naval and air units undertook anti-invasion exercises in the area. Ironside was intended to amplify these concerns.|$|E
5|$|Sometime between 887 and 892, Alfred gave Asser {{the monastery}} of Exeter. Asser {{subsequently}} became Bishop of Sherborne, though {{the year of}} succession is unknown. Asser's predecessor as Bishop of Sherborne, Wulfsige, {{is known to have}} attested a charter sometime between 890 and 896. Asser's first appearance in the position is in 900, when he appears as a witness to a charter; hence the succession can only be dated to the years 890 to 900. In any event, Asser had <b>already</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> bishop prior to his appointment to the see of Sherborne, since Wulfsige is known to have received a copy of Alfred's Pastoral Care in which Asser is described as a bishop.|$|E

5|$|The Archbishop of Canterbury is the primate of the Church of England and the {{worldwide}} Anglican Communion {{owing to the}} importance of St Augustine, who served as the apostle to the pagan Kingdom of Kent {{around the turn of the}} 7th century. The city's cathedral became a major focus of pilgrimage following the 1170 martyrdom of Thomas Becket, although it had <b>already</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> well-trodden pilgrim destination since the murder of St Alphege by the men of King Canute in 1012. A journey of pilgrims to Becket's shrine served as the frame for Geoffrey Chaucer's 14th century classic The Canterbury Tales.|$|E
5|$|Operation Ironside was a Second World War {{military}} deception {{undertaken by}} the Allies in 1944. It formed part of Operation Bodyguard, a broad strategic deception plan instigated by the Allies throughout the year to help cover the June 1944 invasion of Normandy. Ironside supported the overall deception by suggesting to the Germans that the Allies would subsequently land along the Bay of Biscay. It complemented efforts to deceive the Germans into believing that the Allies would also land in southern France at this time (Operation Vendetta). Bordeaux was an important port for the German war effort and had <b>already</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> target of commando raids two years earlier. Ironside intended to play on German fears of an invasion in the region, {{with the aim of}} tying down defensive forces following Operation Overlord in June 1944.|$|E

25|$|King Jayavarman VII (reigned 1181–1219) was {{generally}} considered as Cambodia's greatest king. He had <b>already</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> military leader as a prince under previous kings.

He ascended the throne and continued {{the war against}} the neighbouring eastern kingdom for another 22 years, until the Khmer defeated Champa in 1203 and conquered large parts of its territory.|$|E
25|$|Reverend William Whateley (1583–1639), {{whose father}} was several times bailiff or mayor of Banbury, was a notable Banbury vicar, who was instituted in 1610 but had <b>already</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> 'lecturer' there for some years.

50|$|On March 2, 1861, the Congress {{proposed}} the Corwin Amendment, which if adopted {{would have prevented}} any federal legislation, including a future proposed amendment to the Constitution, that would have interfered with or abolished slavery. It is significant that, although this proposal <b>was</b> <b>already</b> titled as the Thirteenth Amendment, no one claimed that there <b>already</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> adopted Thirteenth Amendment. The 1861 proposal received only 5 ratifications. In 1865, when the actual Thirteenth Amendment, abolishing slavery, was proposed and adopted, no one protested that there <b>already</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> Thirteenth Amendment - either the 1810 or the 1861 proposals.|$|R

Around that time, Bolesław {{became the}} ruler of Lesser Poland, through it is not exactly clear in what circumstances. Jerzy Strzelczyk says that Bolesław {{received}} Lesser Poland from his father; Tadeusz Manteuffel states that he seized the province from his father with the local lords' support; and Henryk Łowmiański writes that his uncle, Boleslav II of Bohemia, granted the region to him.|$|E
25|$|Petrosian was not {{selected}} for the Soviet Olympiad side until 1958; he had <b>already</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> Candidate twice by that time. But he then made ten straight Soviet Olympiad teams from 1958 to 1978, won nine team gold medals, one team silver medal, and six individual gold medals. His overall performance in Olympiad play is impressive: +78−1=50 (only one game lost, to Robert Hübner, out of 129 played), for 79.8 per cent, the third all-time best performance after Anatoly Karpov (+43−2=23 for 80.1 per cent) and Mikhail Tal (+65−2=34 for 81.2 per cent).|$|E
25|$|For the reconstruction, {{contracts}} {{were awarded}} to private companies. Initially companies from countries that had {{opposed the war}} were excluded from these contracts, but this decision was reversed due to protests. Political activists and commentators allege that The Pentagon favoured companies like Halliburton, former employer of Vice President Dick Cheney, because they had connections to high-ranking members of the Bush administration. This suspicion had <b>already</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> concern during the global protests against the war on Iraq. An audit found that Halliburton subsidiary Kellogg, Brown and Root (KBR) may have overcharged the U.S. government $61million, on contracts worth billions, for bringing oil products for the U.S. army into Iraq via a Kuwaiti subcontractor, Altanmia Commercial Marketing Co.|$|E

25|$|For {{five months}} Bismarck did nothing. However, in November the Danish {{government}} instituted {{a new constitution}} whereby Holstein was bound closer to Denmark. Schleswig had <b>already</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> part of Denmark for centuries. By the year's end, the Prussian and Austrian armies were massing on the River Eider. On 1 February 1864 the Prussian-Austrian armies invaded Schleswig-Holstein, and ten days afterwards the Danish government requested British help to resist this. Russell urged Palmerston to send a fleet to Copenhagen and persuade Napoleon III that he should mobilise his soldiers that {{were placed on the}} borders of Prussia's Rhineland provinces. Palmerston replied that the fleet could not do much to assist the Danes in Copenhagen and that nothing should be done to persuade Napoleon to cross the Rhine.|$|E
25|$|Gavin {{arrived at}} West Point {{in the summer}} of 1925. On the {{application}} forms, he indicated his age as 21 (instead of 18) {{to hide the fact that}} he was not old enough to join the army when he did. Since Gavin missed the basic education which was needed to understand the lessons, he rose at 4:30 every morning and read his books in the bathroom, the only place with enough light to read. After four years of hard work, he graduated in June 1929. In the 1929 edition of the West Point yearbook, Howitzer, he was mentioned as a boxer and as the cadet who had <b>already</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> soldier. After his graduation and his commissioning as a second lieutenant, he married Irma Baulsir on September 5, 1929.|$|E
25|$|The {{conflict}} is known by multiple names. In British America, wars were often {{named after the}} sitting British monarch, such as King William's War or Queen Anne's War. There had <b>already</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> King George's War in the 1740s during King George's reign, so British colonists named this conflict after their opponents and it {{became known as the}} French and Indian War. This traditional name continues as the standard in the United States, but it obscures the fact that Indians fought {{on both sides of the}} conflict and that this was part of the Seven Years' War, a much larger conflict between France and Great Britain. American historians generally use the traditional name or sometimes the Seven Years' War. Less frequently used names for the war include the Fourth Intercolonial War and the Great War for the Empire.|$|E
