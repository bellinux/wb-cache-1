Chivalry, on the contrary, is the ideal world, such as it existed in the imaginations of the Romance writers. Its essential character is devotion to woman and to honour.|$|E

It consists of 17 scenes, four of them cancelled. It begins with the Ill May Day events of 1517: Foreign nationals, who have immigrated to England from Lombardy, which is the northern region {{of what is now}} known as Italy, are misbehaving in a variety of ways, and <b>are</b> <b>treating</b> the citizens of London with abuse and disrespect. This is outraging the workers of London, who decide to join together on Mayday and seek revenge on the newcomers. London noblemen are having difficulty deciding what to do about this, when rioting breaks out all across London, and even the Mayor of London is endangered. The noblemen decide to engage Sheriff Thomas More, who is popular and respected by the people, to try and calm the civil unrest.|$|E

Sweeney stated: [...] "Clearwater got that little bit more creepy recently, with the death - the police <b>are</b> <b>treating</b> it as suicide - of Shawn.

Senior IDF officers, Defense Minister Ehud Barak, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu viewed the footage, after which Barak spoke to Shalit's father Noam and {{grandfather}} Zvi by telephone. The video {{was sent to}} the Shalit family home in Mitzpe Hila, with the family reportedly viewing it together. Members of the Israeli negotiating team for Shalit's release viewed the footage to ensure it met with Israel's demands, primarily with regard to how recently it was filmed. The , the only contact from Shalit other than three letters written by him and an audio tape released in June 2007, was released to the public at around 4:00 in the afternoon on Israeli television. In the video, Shalit is seen sitting in a chair in a bare room, looking frail and emaciated but otherwise healthy. He addressed Netanyahu and his parents, and reminisced about times he spent with his family. At the end of the video, he stated that the [...] "Mujahideen of the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades <b>are</b> <b>treating</b> me very well".

40|$|Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) is a tick-borne disease {{caused by}} the {{arbovirus}} which {{is a member of}} the Nairovirus genus and has a high mortality rate if the patients don`t take treatment. This study was conducted to detect the clinical outcomes of treatment with oral ribavirin in children with CCHF. In this study, we evaluated the recovery rate and mortality rate among children with confirmed CCHF, who <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> with oral ribaririn within the three days of onset of disease and the patients who <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> after this time or had not <b>been</b> <b>treated.</b> Out of 29 children with Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (18 Male, 11 Female with age range 5 to 17 years) 25 patients had <b>been</b> <b>treated</b> by oral ribavirin within the initial three days, two patients <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> after three days of the onset of disease and two cases had not <b>been</b> <b>treated</b> with ribavin. Nearly all the patients except two children <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> with ribavirin. Both these two children not treated with ribavirin died. One patients who <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> six days after the onset of disease was expired. Sixteen percent of children who <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> during the initial 72 h of disease died. Fatality rate was 24. 1 % in all of the patients. The recovery rate was higher in the children who <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> during the initial 3 days than children who <b>were</b> <b>treated</b> after this time or <b>were</b> not <b>treated</b> (84 versus 25 %). We conclude that oral ribavirin is an effective treatment for children with CCHF, especially when it is used within 72 h of the onset of disease and as soon as it is possible...|$|R

2500|$|The Formula of Autonomy takes {{something}} important {{from both the}} Formula for the Universal Law of Nature and the Formula of Humanity. The Formula for the Universal Law of Nature involves thinking about your maxim {{as if it were}} an objective law, while the Formula of Humanity is more subjective and is concerned with how you <b>are</b> <b>treating</b> the person with whom you are interacting. The Formula of Autonomy combines the objectivity of the former with the subjectivity of the latter and suggests that the agent ask what she would accept as a universal law. To do this, she would test her maxims against the moral law that she has legislated. The Principle of Autonomy is, “the principle of every human will as a will universally legislating through all its maxims.” (4:432) Kant thinks that the Formula of Autonomy yields another “fruitful concept,” the kingdom of ends. The kingdom of ends is the “systematic union” of all ends in themselves (rational agents) and the ends that they set. All ends that rational agents set have a price and can be exchanged for one another. Ends in themselves, however, have dignity and have no equivalent. In addition to being the basis for the Formula of Autonomy and the kingdom of ends, autonomy itself plays an important role in Kant’s moral philosophy. Autonomy is the capacity to be the legislator of the moral law, in other words, to give the moral law to oneself. Autonomy is opposed to heteronomy, which consists of having one’s will determined by forces alien to it. Because alien forces could only determine our actions contingently, Kant believes that autonomy is the only basis for a non-contingent moral law. It is in failing to see this distinction that Kant believes his predecessors have failed: their theories have all been heteronomous. [...] At this point Kant has given us a picture of what a universal and necessary law would look like should it exist. However, he has yet to prove that it does exist, or, in other words, that it applies to us. That is the task of Section III.|$|E
