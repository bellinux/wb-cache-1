500|$|Architectural {{articulation}} [...] {{refers to}} the ornamental components that give shape {{to the outer wall}} of the shrine. These include projections, recesses, and representations that can produce a variety of patterns and outlines, either stepped, stellate (star-shaped), or square. If stepped (also called [...] "stepped diamond of projecting corners"), these components form five or seven projections {{on each side of the}} shrine, where all but the central one are projecting corners (projections with two full faces created by two recesses, left and right, that are <b>at</b> <b>right</b> <b>angles</b> <b>with</b> each other). If square (also called [...] "square with simple projections"), these components form three or five projections on a side, only two of which are projecting corners. Stellate patterns form star points which are normally 8-, 16-, or 32-pointed and are sub-divided into interrupted and uninterrupted stellate components. In an 'interrupted' stellate plan, the stellate outline is interrupted by orthogonal (right-angle) projections in the cardinal directions, resulting in star points that have been skipped. Two basic kinds of architectural articulation are found in Indian architecture: the southern Indian dravida and the northern Indian nagara.|$|E
500|$|Aware of Frederick's approach, Charles and {{his second}} in command, Count Leopold Joseph von Daun, {{positioned}} the army facing west on a [...] front in country of undulating plains. The Prince deployed his troops in two lines, the right wing at his northernmost point, anchored at Nippern. Leuthen served as the Austrian center. Charles established his command post there, using a church tower as his observation post, and stationing seven battalions in the village itself. The majority of Charles' forces stood on his right wing. A small advanced post stood at Borna, but with Frederick's arrival in force, they withdrew immediately to the east. [...] The Austrian position intersected <b>at</b> <b>right</b> <b>angles</b> <b>with</b> the principal road between Borna and Breslau, passing through Frobelwitz and Lissa. He secured Nippern with eight grenadier companies and placed his cavalry at Guckerwitz (present-day [...] ). The Austrian line extended {{as far south as}} Sagschütz (present-day Zakrzyce). There, his cavalry stood at right angles to the infantry, creating a line between Sagschütz and Gahla. The positions were secured with additional grenadiers and pickets. Troops filled villages and woods, and hastily made abatis and redoubts. Pickets guarded all communication points as well as road and path crossings. The left wing was his shortest, with cavalry placed at the far end, near a stream by the village of Gahla. Charles had an amalgamated force of Habsburg troops, including several contingents from the military frontier, and imperial troops from the duchies Württemberg and Bavaria.|$|E

2500|$|The {{university}} had {{its official}} beginnings when the Wisconsin Territorial Legislature in its 1838 session {{passed a law}} incorporating a [...] "University of the Territory of Wisconsin", and a high-ranking Board of Visitors was appointed. However, this body (the predecessor of the U.W. board of regents) never actually accomplished anything before Wisconsin was incorporated as a state in 1848. The Wisconsin Constitution provided for [...] "the establishment of a state university, {{at or near the}} seat of state government..." [...] and directed by the state legislature to be governed by a board of regents and administered by a Chancellor. On July 26, 1848, Nelson Dewey, Wisconsin's first governor, signed the act that formally created the University of Wisconsin. John H. Lathrop became the university's first chancellor, in the fall of 1849. With John W. Sterling as the university's first professor (mathematics), the first class of 17 students met at Madison Female Academy on February 5, 1849. A permanent campus site was soon selected: an area of [...] "bounded north by Fourth lake, east by a street to be opened <b>at</b> <b>right</b> <b>angles</b> <b>with</b> King street", [...] "south by Mineral Point Road (University Avenue), and west by a carriage-way from said road to the lake." [...] The regents' building plans called for a [...] "main edifice fronting towards the Capitol, three stories high, surmounted by an observatory for astronomical observations." [...] This building, University Hall, now known as Bascom Hall, was finally completed in 1859. On October 10, 1916, a fire destroyed the building's dome, which was never replaced. North Hall, constructed in 1851, was actually the first building on campus. In 1854, Levi Booth and Charles T. Wakeley became the first graduates of the university, and in 1892 the university awarded its first PhD to future university president Charles R. Van Hise.|$|E

Biographical Note: Born in Bruenn, Austria-Hungary (now Brno, Czech Republic) in 1896, Norbert Troller served as a soldier in World War I, {{spending}} time as a prisoner-of-war in Italy. After the war he studied architecture in Brno and Vienna and worked as an architect in Brno until the German occupation of Czechoslovakia. He was deported to Theresienstadt in 1942, where he worked as an architect for the Jewish self-adminstration of the camp, and produced works of art as well. In 1944 he was imprisoned by the Gestapo, and was sent to Auschwitz later that year. After liberation, he lived briefly in Cracow, and then reopened his architectural business in Prague and Brno. He emigrated to the United States in 1948 and worked for the National Jewish Welfare Board in New York designing Jewish community centers, before opening his own practice.

40|$|The {{generation}} {{of a coherent}} ion flow due to the injection in a plasma of a purely electrostatic wave of finite amplitude, propagating <b>at</b> <b>right</b> <b>angle</b> <b>with</b> the ambient uniform magnetic field, is investigated making use of a kinetic code which solves the fully nonlinear Vlasov equations for electrons and ions, coupled with the Maxwell equations, in one spatial and two velocity dimensions. A uniformly magnetized slab plasma is considered. The wave frequency is assumed {{in the range of}} the fourth harmonic of the ion cyclotron frequency, and the wave vector is chosen in order to model the propagation of an ion Bernstein wave. The computation of the first-order moment of the ion distribution function shows that indeed a quasistationary transverse average ion drift velocity is produced. The time evolution of the ion distribution function undergoes a "resonant" interaction of Cherenkov type, even if the plasma ions are magnetized (omega(ci) /omega(pi) approximate to 0. 5). During the wave-plasma interaction, the electron distribution function remains Gaussian-like, while increasing its energy content...|$|R
40|$|Theoretical {{modeling}} of the lesion formation process during radio-frequency ablation of the myocardium is presented. The model is axisymmetric {{and consists of}} a catheter electrode coming in contact <b>at</b> <b>right</b> <b>angle</b> <b>with</b> the heart tissue. The electric power dissipated in the tissue is calculated and from it the temperature distribution and the resulting lesion are evaluated {{as a function of}} time. The cooling effect of the blood flow and the temperature dependence of the electrical conductivity are included in the model, making it non-linear. The finite-element method is used to discretize the spatial domain and a finite-difference algorithm resolves the time dependence. The numerical simulator is validated with a series of experiments performed on a tissue-equivalent material. Both the measured temperature distribution in the tissue sample and the electrode resistance as a function of time agree well with the theoretical predictions. The model is used to study the effect of the electrode geometry and the electrical excitation on the resulting lesion. Theoretical predictions for the time evolution of the lesion size and the electrode resistance are presented for the first time. Recommendations for the improvement of the RF ablation procedure are formulated...|$|R
