40|$|We {{systematically}} {{investigate the}} magnetic properties and local structure of Ba 2 YIrO 6 {{to demonstrate that}} Y and Ir lattice defects {{in the form of}} <b>antiphase</b> <b>boundary</b> or clusters of antisite disorder affect the magnetism observed in this d^ 4 compound. We compare the magnetic properties and atomic imaging of (1) a slow cooled crystal, (2) a crystal quenched from 900 C after growth, and (3) a crystal grown using a faster cooling rate than the slow cooled one. Atomic imaging by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) shows that quenching from 900 oC introduces <b>antiphase</b> <b>boundary</b> to the crystals, and a faster cooling rate during crystal growth leads to clusters of Y and Ir antisite disorder. STEM study suggests the <b>antiphase</b> <b>boundary</b> region is Ir-rich with a composition of Ba 2 YIrO 6. The magnetic measurements show that Ba 2 YIrO 6 crystals with clusters of antisite defects have a larger effective moment and a larger saturation moment than the slow-cooled crystals. Quenched crystals with Ir-rich <b>antiphase</b> <b>boundary</b> shows a slightly suppressed saturation moment than the slow cooled crystals, and this seems to suggest that <b>antiphase</b> <b>boundary</b> is detrimental to the moment formation. Our DFT calculations suggest magnetic condensation is unlikely as the energy to be gained from superexchange is small compared to the spin-orbit gap. However, once Y is replaced by Ir in the antisite disordered region, the picture of local non-magnetic singlets breaks down and magnetism can be induced. This is because of (a) enhanced interactions due to increased overlap of orbitals between sites, and, (b) increased number of orbitals mediating the interactions.

30|$|The atomic {{structure}} and chemistry of thin films of Bi(Fe,Mn)O 3 (BFMO) films with a target composition of Bi 2 FeMnO 6 on SrTiO 3 are studied using scanning {{transmission electron microscopy}} imaging and electron energy loss spectroscopy. It is shown that Mn 4 +-rich <b>antiphase</b> <b>boundaries</b> are locally nucleated right at the film substrate and then form stepped structures that are approximately pyramidal in three dimensions. These have the effect of confining the material below the pyramids in a highly strained state with an out-of-plane lattice parameter close to 4.1  Å. Outside the area enclosed by the <b>antiphase</b> <b>boundaries,</b> the out-of-plane lattice parameter is much closer to bulk values for BFMO. This suggests that to improve the crystallographic perfection of the films whilst retaining the strain state through as much of the film as possible, ways need to be found to prevent nucleation of the <b>antiphase</b> <b>boundaries.</b> Since the <b>antiphase</b> <b>boundaries</b> seem to form from the interaction of Mn with the Ti in the substrate, one route to perform this would be to grow a thin buffer layer of pure BiFeO 3 on the SrTiO 3 substrate to minimise any Mn-Ti interactions.|$|R

Apart from the dislocations, two different kinds of <b>antiphase</b> <b>boundaries,</b> straight and zig―zagged, were observed.

The formation mechanism of the <b>antiphase</b> <b>boundaries</b> is attributed to the terrace or step on the surfaces of LaAlO 3 substrate.
