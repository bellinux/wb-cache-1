5|$|As of October2014, Caltrans had {{considered}} relinquishing {{the eastern part}} of SR54 from the SR94 junction up to the El Cajon city limits to the County of San Diego. Two years later, the CTC approved a Caltrans proposal to revoke the proposed freeway status of the unconstructed portion of SR54 since the existing roads including Jamacha Boulevard would be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> the projected traffic load; this would allow the unused land to be sold.|$|E
5|$|Even after Suys' {{proposal}} was officially adopted, Anspach faced strong {{opposition to the}} project. This opposition came first from engineers who felt that the covering was incompatible with Brussels’s geology, would accumulate potentially dangerous gases {{and would not be}} <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> enough water to prevent floods. Others opposed to the project complained about the high taxes resulting from its high cost, poor compensation for seized property and the lack of public input into the project. The press accused Anspach of being responsible for demolishing Brussels' old town, and published numerous caricatures mocking him.|$|E
5|$|Germanicus and Tiberius {{are often}} contrasted by ancient historians, poets who wrote using themes found in drama, with Germanicus playing the tragic hero and Tiberius the tyrant. The {{endurance}} of the Principate is challenged in these narratives, by the emperor's jealous trepidation toward competent commanders such as Germanicus. Attention is paid particularly to their leadership styles, i.e., {{in their relationship}} with the masses. Germanicus is painted as a competent leader <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> the masses whereas Tiberius is indecisive and envious.|$|E

5|$|Additionally, the {{population}} of Downtown Miami nearly doubled from 2000 to 2010, {{and is expected to}} increase by several thousand more in the current decade, largely due to many new high rise condo developments in the downtown area adding thousands of housing units which will benefit from having the tunnel. Although traffic and port activity has declined since the early 90's, losing some of it to the nearby Port Everglades, which overtook Port of Miami in 2007 as Florida's largest cargo port, the port is likely to see a large shift in the other direction after it becomes one of few deep water ports in the United States <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> the New Panamax ships by 2016. Within the first month of opening, it was reported that congestion in the downtown area had eased.|$|E
5|$|As the Game Boy Advance was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> newer, {{enhanced}} graphics, Ruby and Sapphire {{were the}} first games in the series that allowed up to four people to share information at one time, {{as opposed to the}} previous limit of two. However, the development team used a more basic graphics engine {{in order to keep the}} game simple and not overly confusing. The team wanted the games to appeal to a large audience, so the game was designed to be easy enough for younger generations of children to play, but new features were added to bring the veteran gamers back.|$|E

These plans were put on hold in March 2008, due to Paro Airport not being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> night flights and the airline only being able to secure landing slots at Mumbai's Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport at 3am.

5|$|The {{original}} {{plans for}} the I-94 overlap in downtown Saint Paul {{did not include the}} right-side ramps that eliminate weaving. The ramp from I-35E northbound to I-94 eastbound was added when I-35E was finally completed in 1990, and a five-year construction project that was completed in 1992 added the ramp from I-35E southbound to I-94 westbound, as well as a direct ramp from I-35E southbound to the Lafayette Freeway (US52) to avoid weaving across I-94 east. This project was done because the old Spaghetti Junction at the east split of I-35E and I-94 would not be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> the extra load from the completed I-35E parkway.|$|E
5|$|Bowling {{for long}} periods caused McCool to {{continually}} tear a callus on his third finger, which he used to impart spin on the ball. As a result, Bradman felt compelled to leave {{him out of the}} Test matches, feeling that his finger would not be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> the necessarily long bowling spells. This decision was aided by England and Australia’s agreement to allow a new ball to be used every 55 overs, instead of the incumbent regulation of permitting a new ball for every 200 runs scored, which usually took longer than 55 overs. This meant the ball was in a shiny state more often, and therefore more conducive to fast and swing bowling, so Bradman relied heavily on his pacemen. For the rest of his career, McCool was troubled by the skin rubbing off his spinning finger.|$|E
5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the typhoon, the Pacific Air Forces were on standby to deliver supplies to Guam, but were delayed by inoperable airstrips. Guam Memorial Hospital was damaged, but other civilian and military installations, including the Navy's hospital, were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> injured persons. On November12, Manuel Guerrero made an urgent appeal to the Government of the United States requesting that aid be rushed to the territory. Additionally, he instituted an island-wide curfew between 8:00p.m. and 6:00a.m. local time to limit looting. At schools, teachers were called in to guard supplies and equipment. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, under orders from United States President John F. Kennedy, declared Guam a major disaster area later that day, allowing residents to receive federal aid. Additionally, 15 United States Air Force communications technicians were deployed from Manila, Philippines carrying three plane-loads of communication supplies. Guerrero estimated that it would take four months to complete repairs to utilities. It was also estimated that schools on the island would be closed for six months.|$|E

5|$|Keeping {{track of}} the enemies' {{strengths}} and weaknesses was made more consistent with different types of health bars so that players {{did not have to}} estimate what types of challenges they were facing when fighting new enemies. The game's HUD was revised eight times during development. As the inventory management of the original Mass Effect received criticism, designing a new inventory system for Mass Effect 2 {{was one of the main}} concerns during development. Ideally, the inventory needed to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> a large number of characters with simplicity. Norman spent time examining various inventory systems from other RPG games, but none could be applied to support the game's large number of characters. Ultimately, the team opted to replaced it with a set of different systems that provide the same functionality without any sort of management. This concept allowed a character to use a weapon without taking it away from someone else.|$|E
5|$|The first Norwegian-built tram was {{delivered}} on 16 February 1983 {{and put into}} service on 9 March. The last unit was put into service on 10 January 1984. The Strømmen trams were numbered 111 through 125. There were few problems in the start, although the pantographs had technical problems and there were occasional power failures in the overhead wires due to out-of-date rectifiers not being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> the increase power usage. Trams no. 101 through 113 were put into service on Line 9 on the Lilleaker Line and the Ekeberg Line, replacing the Class E. The remaining trams of the first series were put into service on Line 1, on the Sinsen Line and the Briskeby Line, as well as Line 7, on the Ullevål Hageby Line and the Sinsen Line. On Line 9, that included both the tramway's light rail sections, only SL79-trams were used, while lines 1 and 7 used a mix of SL79 and SM53-trams.|$|E
5|$|The sparsely {{populated}} {{communities around the}} bay transformed during the 20th century. Following the devastating 1900 hurricane, donations by the newly created Red Cross, including millions of strawberry plants to Gulf Coast farmers, helped revive area communities. This and the subsequent establishment of a major strawberry farm in the area by Texaco founder Joseph S. Cullinan made Pasadena an important fruit producer for many years afterward. The newly established community of Texas City opened its port and railroad junctions shipping cotton and grain. In fact, because the port had opened just before the 1900 hurricane, it was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> Galveston's diverted shipping traffic until the island's damaged port was repaired. Following another hurricane in 1915, the Texas City Dike was built to protect the Texas City ship channel from sediment movement in future storms, thus helping to build confidence {{in the safety of}} the port. One of the most immediate effects of the dike, however, was to increase the salt levels in West Bay, between Galveston and the southwest coastline.|$|E

5|$|To prove she is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> her own affairs, Serena {{refuses to}} leave jail with either Lily or CeCe (Caroline Lagerfelt) {{although}} Lily drops the charges {{on which she}} had Serena arrested. Rufus (Matthew Settle) is also angry with Lily for Serena's arrest; Dan (Penn Badgley) and Jenny (Taylor Momsen) inform Vanessa (Jessica Szohr) that Rufus returned home without proposing to Lily, and he has remained in his bedroom ever since. Lily feuds with CeCe for telling Rufus about their lovechild. From jail, Serena encourages Blair (Leighton Meester) to enjoy prom with Nate (Chace Crawford) in the way Blair had chronicled in a scrapbook as a preteen, but each of the couple’s prom plans, such as the limo, hotel reservation and Blair's dress, inexplicably go awry. Nate suspects Chuck (Ed Westwick) of sabotaging the prom {{in an effort to}} win Blair back, but Chuck denies involvement. Dan convinces Serena to allow him to pay her bail and escort her to the Prom.|$|E
5|$|England beat Argentina 1–0 in {{the last}} eight, with Geoff Hurst scoring with a header; the match was sullied by the first-half sending off of Argentinian midfielder Antonio Rattín, who refused to leave the pitch after being {{dismissed}} for dissent. In contrast to the previous games, the semi-final against Portugal {{proved to be a}} fair contest between two sides of talented players eager to attack {{from the start of the}} match. Yet there was panic in the buildup to the game as trainer Harold Shepherdson forgot to buy chewing gum, which Banks used to make his hands stickier and better <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> the ball, and so Shepherdson had to run to a nearby newsagents to purchase gum as the teams were in the tunnel. Bobby Charlton scored two goals, but Portugal made a strong finish and won a penalty on 82 minutes after Jack Charlton handled the ball in the penalty area. Eusébio converted the penalty after sending Banks the wrong way, and the game finished 2–1 in England's favour. This was the first goal Banks had conceded for England in 721 minutes of regular play, since giving up Scotland's last goal after 81 minutes of the Home International clash in April. This remains a record for an England goalkeeper.|$|E
5|$|Before Crisis began {{development}} in 2002. The Compilation was first unveiled in 2003 with {{the announcement of}} Advent Children. None of the titles in the series {{up to that point}} were traditional role-playing games like the original. The explanation for this was that traditional RPGs took long production periods and a large staff, which would have made the project stand out a bit too much. One of the other considerations for the team was not to make the titles lightweight as X-2 had been, due to backlash from parts of the fanbase. Conversely, making Final Fantasy X-2 reminded the team that they did not need to stick to completely serious traditional RPGs, enabling the original creation of the Compilation. While Advent Children was the first Compilation title to begin production, it ran into problems during post-production, resulting in the first released title being Before Crisis, despite it being the second title to begin development. Before Crisis was also originally planned for release in North America, but the mobile phones available in North America at the time were not <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>handle</b> the game. In addition, the producer Kosei Ito left Square Enix in 2008 and Tabata moved on to other projects, leaving its localization unlikely. Japanese animation studio Madhouse created a commercial to promote Before Crisis. Due to its success and staff feelings that important scenes from VII represented in Advent Children had been needlessly disjointed, the studio was chosen to produce an animated film: this eventually became Last Order. Crisis Core was originally going to be an action game, but became an action RPG, staying within the staff's design strengths while incorporating action elements.|$|E
