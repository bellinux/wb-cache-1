40|$|SummaryBackgroundNo {{national}} {{audit of}} acute asthma in secondary care has been undertaken since 1991 {{in spite of}} further revisions of national guidelines. There has been no audit of the patient course through the ambulance, <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>units</b> (A&E), medical admission units (MEAU) and in-patient care in an integrated manner. AimTo audit the care of acute asthma in the various areas of secondary care in all hospitals in Wales in February 2006. MethodsStandardised audit forms were produced to assess ambulance performance during transfer, A&E and MEAU care and in-patient care where admission occurred. The results were compared to national guidelines. ResultsAcute asthma in Wales is a common reason for hospital attendance, 30 % of such patients appear to be mild but 19 % are severe/acute severe. British Thoracic Society (BTS) /Sign assessment of severity is rarely performed and both monitoring of progress and the discharge process are disappointing. There are major incompatibilities between BTS/Sign guidelines and the current Welsh Ambulance Service protocol. A similar problem exists with the British Society of <b>Accident</b> <b>and</b> <b>Emergency</b> Medicine (BAEM) protocol for moderate asthma. ConclusionsThis audit demonstrates disappointing adherence to BTS/Sign guidelines {{for the care of}} acute asthma. A new approach to acute asthma care in Wales is required...|$|R

50|$|During {{the unusually}} severe Winter of 2009-10 in Great Britain and Ireland, heavy snow had fallen {{over much of}} the country in late December and early January. By the second week of January, many of the roads and {{pavements}} had been cleared by local councils due to the use of rock salt gritting. However, during the early hours of January 12, a wet front moved across the country, causing freezing rain and heavy ice glaze, particularly in the South and West Yorkshire areas of Northern England (crucially, this rainfall had stopped before first light). When the local population prepared to set out for work and school, they saw from their windows what appeared to be clear roads and pavements but were in fact treacherous sheets of black ice. Cars and buses almost immediately encounted extreme difficulty, <b>and</b> <b>emergency</b> services were called to dozens of accidents. Pedestrians in the village of Holmfirth found the only safe way to proceed was to crawl on all fours. <b>Accident</b> <b>and</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>units</b> at hospitals in the Sheffield, Rotherham, and Barnsley areas found themselves inundated by people with broken bones, fractures, and sprains, and many schools were closed as it was judged unsafe for pupils to attempt to make their way there.|$|R

Aims and Objectives: To determine the prevalence of stress and its correlation with salivary biomarker among assistant medical officers in Ministry of Health hospitals. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 194 randomly selected assistant medical officers in all Ministry of Health hospitals. The questionnaire was a self-administered questionnaire on socio-demographic data, Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale- 42 (DASS- 42) and Job Content Questionnaires (JCQ). Salivary cortisol level was measured using Expanded Range High Sensitivity Salivary Cortisol Enzyme Immunoassay Kit (Salimetrics LLC, State College, PA, USA). Results: The prevalence of stress was 13. 7 % (95 % CI: 8. 61, 18. 79). There was no significant (P= 0. 393) correlation between salivary cortisol and stress score. The observed Spearman correlation was 0. 066 suggest no correlation. Salivary cortisol was significantly higher (P= 0. 033) among stressed compared to non-stressed assistant medical officers (0. 78 versus 0. 67 µg/dL respectively) Conclusions: There was no correlation between salivary cortisol and stress score. However, salivary cortisol was significantly higher among stressed compared to non-stressed assistant medical officers in Ministry of Health hospitals...|$|R
