Alcuin mentions several Latin and Greek classical authors, as well as the Fathers and other Christian writers that formed the 8th century canon. Æthelbert, in his search for books, travelled far, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> he visited Rome among other places. Alcuin's poem Versus lists 41 different authors, including some who wrote in Hebrew. He taught both the trivium as well as the quadrivium, plus how to figure the dates of church festivals and natural science.|$|E
25|$|The {{opinion that}} the Agathyrsi were almost {{certainly}} Thracians results also from the writings preserved by Stephen of Byzantium, who explains that the Greeks called the Trausi the Agathyrsi, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> the Trausi lived in the Rhodope Mountains. Certain details from their way of life, such as tattooing, also suggest that the Agathyrsi were Thracians. Their place was later taken by the Dacians. That the Dacians were of Thracian stock is not in doubt, and {{it is safe to}} assume that this new name also encompassed the Agathyrsi, and perhaps other neighboring Thracian people as well, as a result of some political upheaval.|$|E

Stephen Badsey, a historian who specialises in World War I, has noted that their situation was not easy as they [...] "found themselves as minor players trapped in a complicated hierarchical structure dominated by politicians, generals and newspaper owners." [...] Beach Thomas, however, received particular opprobrium. Paul Fussell, the historian, describes him as [...] "notoriously fatuous" [...] during the war period. Peter Stothard, editor of The Times between 1992 and 2002, describes him as [...] "a quietly successful countryside columnist and literary gent who became a calamitous Daily Mail war correspondent" [...] and believes {{that he may have}} been the inspiration for the character of William Boot in Evelyn Waugh's Scoop. John Simpson, a war correspondent, describes him as [...] "charming but unlovable" [...] and thinks that the troops despised Beach Thomas more than they did the other British war correspondents, even though all those journalists were playing a similar disinformation role. They considered his writing to be a trivialisation of the realities of war, jingoistic, pompous and particularly self-promoting, often giving the reader an impression that he was writing from the battlefield when in fact he was being fed information of dubious value by the authorities while based in their headquarters.|$|E

2500|$|A related view {{holds that}} Beckmesser was {{designed}} to parody the renowned critic Eduard Hanslick, who valorized the music of Brahms and held Wagner's music in low regard. [...] We know that the original name of the Beckmesser character was [...] "Veit Hanslick," [...] <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> Wagner invited Hanslick to his initial reading of the libretto, though whether then character still had the [...] "Hanslick" [...] name when Hanslick heard it is unclear.

"And, of course, {{sophisticated}} {{delivery systems}} aren't {{required for a}} chemical or biological attack; all that might be required are a small container and one terrorist or Iraqi intelligence operative to deliver it.

Over the years, Iraq has provided safe haven to terrorists such as Abu Nidal, whose terror organization carried out more than 90 terrorist attacks in 20 countries that killed or injured nearly 900 people, including 12 Americans. Iraq has also provided safe haven to Abu Abbas, who was responsible for seizing the Achille Lauro and killing an American passenger. <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> Iraq is continuing to finance terror and gives assistance to groups that use terrorism to undermine Middle East peace." ...|$|E

2500|$|This {{reaction}} {{was met with}} a virulent reply by Iorga, whose renewed accusations borrowed from antisemitic discourse: [...] " [...] about many things {{that he does not}} comprehend. He was crafting with his clumsy hands manuals, grammars, anthologies, dictionaries for speculative profit. I however had an explanation for such defects. We all know that Mr. Șăineanu is not a Romanian, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> which he is. His people has many traits that are very elevated and noble, but also many defects that are low and ungainly. These, I had been telling myself, are in his blood; he could never get rid of them. I wish to talk about the passion for high praise and multiple earnings, without much investment". In 1907, Iorga and his Neamul Românesc journal also retorted against Caragiale's praise for Șăineanu, calling Caragiale one who [...] "deals with the Jews", and prompting Caragiale to satirize Iorga's own scholarly ambitions.|$|E

[...] In a 2006 edition, the statement was altered to indicate that [...] "the Lamanites ... are among the ancestors of the American Indians." [...] This change, church leaders said, was in harmony with the claims of the Book of Mormon itself, and what some Latter-day Saints had long perceived. For instance, in 1929 Anthony W. Ivins, of the LDS Church's First Presidency, cautioned church members: “We must be careful in the conclusions that we reach. The Book of Mormon teaches the history of three distinct peoples … who came from the old world to this continent. It does not tell us that there was no one here before them. It does not tell us that people did not come after. And so if discoveries are made which suggest differences in race origins, it can very easily be accounted for, and reasonably, for we do believe that other people came to this continent.
