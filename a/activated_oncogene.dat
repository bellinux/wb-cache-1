40|$|The {{validity}} of rodent tumor end points {{in assessing the}} potential hazards of chemical exposure to humans is a somewhat controversial but very important issue since most chemicals are classified as potentially hazardous to humans {{on the basis of}} long-term carcinogenesis studies in rodents. The ability to distinguish between genotoxic, cytotoxic, or receptor-mediated promotion effects of chemical treatment would aid in the interpretation of rodent carcinogenesis data. <b>Activated</b> <b>oncogenes</b> in spontaneously occurring and chemically induced rodent tumors were examined and compared as one approach to determine the mechanism by which chemical treatment caused an increased incidence of rodent tumors. Different patterns of <b>activated</b> <b>oncogenes</b> were found not only in spontaneous versus chemically induced mouse liver tumors but also in a variety of spontaneous rat tumors versus chemically induced rat lung tumors. In the absence of cytotoxic effects, {{it could be argued that}} the chemicals in question activated protooncogenes by a direct genotoxic mechanism. These results provided a basis for the analysis of <b>activated</b> <b>oncogenes</b> in spontaneous and chemically induced rodent tumors to provide information at a molecular level to aid in the extrapolation of rodent carcinogenesis data to human risk assessment...|$|R

Offspring that contain the oncogene and have every cell in their body affected (including germ cells and somatic cells) by it are referred to as oncomice. Oncomice are useful for carcinogenic studies as they are more susceptible to carcinogens.

40|$|DNA {{replication}} must be tightly regulated {{to ensure}} that the genome is accurately duplicated during each cell cycle. When these regulatory mechanisms fail, replicative stress and DNA damage ensue. <b>Activated</b> <b>oncogenes</b> promote replicative stress, inducing a DNA damage response (DDR) early in tumorigenesis. Senescence or apoptosis result, forming a barrier against tumour progression. This may provide a selective pressure for acquisition of mutations in the DDR pathway during tumorigenesis. Despite its potential importance in early cancer development, the precise nature of oncogene-induced replicative stress remains poorly understood. Here, we review our current understanding of replication initiation and its regulation, describe mechanisms by which <b>activated</b> <b>oncogenes</b> might interfere with these processes and discuss how replicative stress might contribute to the genomic instability seen in cancers...|$|R

40|$|NIH/ 3 T 3 {{cells have}} been widely used for the study of {{activated}} oncogenes in DNA derived from neoplastic tissue because this mouse fibroblast line is both an efficient recipient for DNA transfection and is susceptible to full transformation by a single <b>activated</b> <b>oncogene,</b> producing foci of transformed cells which can be detected directly by inspection of monolayer cultures (Goldfarb et al., 1982; Krontiris & Cooper, 1981; Land et al., 1983; Shih et al., 1981).

40|$|Hematologic {{malignancies}} {{are typically}} associated with leukemogenic fusion proteins, which are required to maintain the oncogenic state. Previous {{studies have shown that}} certain oncogenes that promote solid tumors, such as RAS and BRAF, can induce senescence in primary cells, which is thought to provide a barrier to tumorigenesis. In these cases, the <b>activated</b> <b>oncogene</b> elicits a DNA damage response (DDR), which is essential for the senescence program. Here we show that 3 leukemogenic fusion proteins, BCR-ABL, CBFB-MYH 11, and RUNX 1 -ETO, can induce senescence in primary fibroblasts and hematopoietic progenitors. Unexpectedly, we find that senescence induction by BCR-ABL and CBFB-MYH 11 occurs through a DDR-independent pathway, whereas RUNX 1 -ETO induces senescence in a DDR-dependent manner. All 3 fusion proteins activate the p 38 MAPK pathway, which is required for senescence induction. Our results reveal diverse pathways for oncogene-induced senescence and further suggest that leukemias harbor genetic or epigenetic alterations that inactivate senescence induction genes...|$|E

40|$|A mouse strain {{with low}} lung tumor {{susceptibility}} (C 3 H) and a strain with high lung tumor susceptibility (A/J) were reciprocally crossed to produce C 3 A and AC 3 F 1 hybrid mice. Ki-ras oncogenes were detected in spontaneous and chemically induced lung tumors {{obtained from the}} C 3 A and AC 3 mice. To further explore the genetics of the Ki-ras gene in mouse lung tumor susceptibility, the parental origin of Ki-ras oncogenes detected in lung tumors from the F 1 hybrids was determined by a strategy based on a 37 -base-pair deletion in the second intron of the A/J Ki-ras allele. Ki-ras oncogenes were derived from the A/J parent in 38 of 40 tumors obtained from C 3 A mice and 30 of 30 tumors from AC 3 mice. The observation that the <b>activated</b> <b>oncogene</b> in hybrids originates from the susceptible parent suggests that the Ki-ras gene is directly linked to mouse lung tumor susceptibility.

40|$|Activated c-Ki-ras {{genes in}} liver tumors from rats {{exposed to the}} potent hepatocarcinogen {{aflatoxin}} B 1 were analyzed to determine {{the nature of their}} activation by characterization of two c-Ki-ras alleles present in tumor-derived NIH 3 T 3 mouse transformants. Using selective hybridization of synthetic oligonucleotides to transformant DNA, we have determined that a single G X C to A X T base transition in either the first or second position of the 12 th codon is associated with activation of the gene. Such mutations would lead to amino acid substitutions of aspartate or serine for glycine in the mutant proteins. To confirm these findings, we applied a technique for direct sequence analysis of a 90 -base-pair region of the rat c-Ki-ras gene produced by primer-directed enzymatic amplification. Findings produced by this approach, which provides a convenient method to characterize mutations in multiple alleles without the necessity to clone individual genes, confirmed the presence and identity of the 12 th codon mutations in the <b>activated</b> <b>oncogene,</b> as initially determined by the oligonucleotide hybridization technique...|$|E
