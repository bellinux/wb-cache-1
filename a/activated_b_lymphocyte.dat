40|$|Introduction: Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) is a {{heterogeneous}} group conformed by morphological and clinical varieties of neoplasms; it originates from peripheral B-cells and is distinguished into three groups: germinal center (GC), <b>activated</b> <b>B</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> (ABL), {{and the third}} type. The existence of DLBCL with anaplastic morphology and expression of CD 30 without t (2, 5) translocation is rare. The aim of the present article is to describe this morphol-ogic variant in a 54 -year-old woman and a 74 -year-old man, respectively. Materials and Methods: Patients diagnose...|$|E
40|$|Homeobox genes encode {{sequence}} specific DNA-binding proteins {{which have}} been implicated in the control of gene expression both in developing {{as well as in}} adult tissues (1). The carboxy terminus of the homeodomain exhibits similarity to the helix-turn-helix motif of DNA-binding regulatory proteins of prokaryotes and yeast, which suggested that the homeobox performed a similar function (2). Indeed, homeodomain containing proteins {{have been shown to be}} sequence specific DNA binding proteins (3). We report here the identification of a previously unknown human homeobox gene, HB 9, which is 38 — 58 % identical to the major classes of mammalian and Drosophila homeodomain. The HB 9 cDNA clone (1204 nt) from a human <b>activated</b> <b>B</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> cDNA library and overlapping genomic clones (3. 5 kb) were sequenced and an open reading frame was found which when translated encoded a homeobox.

40|$|LINE- 1 (abbreviated L 1) {{is a major}} {{class of}} retroelements in humans and mice. If unrestricted, retroelements {{accumulate}} in the cytoplasm and insert their DNA into the host genome, {{with the potential to}} cause autoimmune disease and cancer. Retroviruses and other retroelements are inhibited by proteins of the APOBEC family, of which activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) is a member. Although AID is mainly known for being a DNA mutator shaping the antibody repertoire in <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes,</b> we found that AID also restricts de novo L 1 integrations in B- and non-B-cell lines. It does so by decreasing the protein level of open reading frame 1 (ORF 1) of both exogenous and endogenous L 1. In <b>activated</b> <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes,</b> AID deficiency increased L 1 mRNA 1. 6 -fold and murine leukemia virus (MLV) mRNA 2. 7 -fold. In cell lines and <b>activated</b> <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes,</b> AID forms cytoplasmic high-molecular-mass complexes with L 1 mRNA, which may contribute to L 1 restriction. Because AID-deficient <b>activated</b> <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> do not express ORF 1 protein, we suggest that ORF 1 protein expression is inhibited by additional restriction factors in these cells. The greater increase in MLV compared to L 1 mRNA in AID-deficient <b>activated</b> <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> may indicate less strict surveillance of retrovirus...|$|R

40|$|A rat {{monoclonal}} antibody (mAb) (NIM-R 8), insolubilized by binding to plastic plates, induced a rapid and extensive formation of dendrite processes ('spreading') in <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> <b>activated</b> by anti-IgM and interleukin- 4 (IL- 4) or anti-CD 38 and IL- 4. In contrast, resting B cells {{were unable to}} spread similarly on the NIM-R 8 -coated plates. The NIM-R 8 antibody recognized a 90, 000 MW surface glycoprotein (gp 90) present on both <b>B</b> and T <b>lymphocytes.</b> The expression of this molecule was greatly increased after polyclonal (lipopolysaccharide, anti-IgM plus IL- 4 or concanavalin A) activation. The NIM-R 8 mAb with or without IL- 2 or IL- 4 was unable to induce proliferation of splenic lymphocytes. Following the demonstration that the NIM-R 8 mAb recognizes the murine equivalent of human CD 44, the induction of spreading of <b>activated</b> <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> was studied using a panel of mAb recognizing different epitopes of murine CD 44. All of these different mAb induced similar spreading of <b>activated</b> <b>B</b> cells.

40|$|Mismatch repair {{contributes}} to hypermutation in <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes,</b> both {{by increasing the}} frequency of mutations and by changing the mutational patterns. In this paper, we investigated whether or not mismatch repair influences activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) -mediated hypermutation in a non-B lymphocyte line. We did so by regulating expression of MutL homologue MLH 1, which is essential in mismatch repair, in a kidney cell line that had been transduced by an AID-containing vector. Whether or not MLH 1 was expressed, we found {{no difference in the}} mutation rates of an indicator gene.

40|$|Classical nonhomologous DNA end-joining (C-NHEJ), {{which is}} a major DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair pathway in {{mammalian}} cells, plays a dominant role in joining DSBs during Ig heavy chain (IgH) class switch recombination (CSR) in <b>activated</b> <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes.</b> However, in <b>B</b> cells deficient for one or more requisite C-NHEJ factors, such as DNA ligase 4 (Lig 4) or XRCC 4, end-joining during CSR occurs by a distinct alternative end-joining (A-EJ) pathway. A-EJ also has been implicated in joining DSBs found in oncogenic chromosomal translocations. DNA ligase 3 (Lig 3) and its cofactor XRCC 1 are widely considered to be requisite A-EJ factors, based on biochemical studies or extrachromosomal substrate end-joining studies. However, potential roles for these factors in A-EJ of endogenous chromosomal DSBs have not been tested. Here, we report that Xrcc 1 inactivation via conditional gene-targeted deletion in WT or XRCC 4 -deficient primary B cells {{does not have an}} impact on either CSR or IgH/c-myc translocations in <b>activated</b> <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes.</b> Indeed, homozygous deletion of Xrcc 1 does not impair A-EJ of I-SceI–induced DSBs in XRCC 4 -deficient pro–B-cell lines. Correspondingly, substantial depletion of Lig 3 in Lig 4 -deficient primary B cells or B-cell lines does not impair A-EJ of CSR-mediated DSBs or formation of IgH/c-myc translocations. Our findings firmly demonstrate that XRCC 1 is not a requisite factor for A-EJ of chromosomal DSBs and raise the possibility that DNA ligase 1 (Lig 1) may contribute more to A-EJ than previously considered...|$|R
40|$|Reactive Oxygen Intermediates (ROI) can {{significantly}} affect <b>B</b> <b>Lymphocyte</b> function, but {{the effects on}} key signaling pathways and gene expression in <b>activated</b> and non-activated <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> are largely undefined. This study demonstrates a concentration dependent effect of exogenous hydrogen peroxide on the transcriptional regulation of a 32 ̆ 7 regulatory region of the Immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (32 ̆ 7 IghRR). Specifically, low μM hydrogen peroxide induces an enhancing effect while higher μM hydrogen peroxide (greater {{than or equal to}} 100 μM) is suppressive. The enhancing effects of hydrogen peroxide on 32 ̆ 7 IghRR activity are dependent on the NFκB/Rel pathway, and appear to be most prominent in antigen <b>activated</b> <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes.</b> Moreover, treatment of <b>activated</b> <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> with a chemical inhibitor of ROI producing enzymes inhibited 32 ̆ 7 IghRR activity, Ig production, and NFκB/Rel activity, suggesting that endogenous ROI in part facilitate activation-induced Ig expression and NFκB/Rel activity. Furthermore, exposure of non-activated <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> with higher μM hydrogen peroxide concentrations suppressed NFκB/Rel activity and caused dramatic decreases in cellular viability. This effect of hydrogen peroxide on viability was suppressed by co-treatment with a pan caspase inhibitor, thus indicating an important role for caspases in the hydrogen peroxide-mediated cell death. Hydrogen peroxide-induced caspase activity was found to directly target critical components of the NFκB/Rel pathway, which is involved in maintaining cell survival signals in the <b>B</b> <b>lymphocyte.</b> We observed that hydrogen peroxide exposure induced caspase-dependent cleavage of a critical NFκB/Rel regulatory protein, IκBα that can result in the ΔN-IκBα form and most notably a novel 19 kDa form of IκBα. Hydrogen peroxide exposure also induced two caspase-dependent cleavage products of a prominent NFκB/Rel transcription factor, p 65 /RelA. We believe hydrogen peroxide mobilizes caspases activity as part of a mechanism to suppress the NFκB/Rel pathway during oxidative stress as co-treatment of hydrogen peroxide-exposed <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> with a pan caspase inhibitor markedly increased the expression of an NFκB/Rel transcriptional reporter. These observations demonstrate that ROI can modulate critical functions in the <b>B</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> such as Ig expression and cellular viability {{in a manner that is}} dependent upon the activation state of the cell, and at least in part, involves the modulation of the NFκB/Rel pathway. These findings may be highly relevant to further understanding the effects of ROI on NFκB/Rel-dependent <b>B</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> function in adaptive immunity and many disease states and treatments known to involve ROI...|$|R

These cloned cells suppressed Ig secretion when they constituted as few as 0. 2 % of the total cell population and inhibition did not require identity at the H- 2 locus.

Multivariate analysis confirmed the homogeneity of IgM repertoires of neonates toward self- and non-self-antigens. Multivariate analysis discriminated between newborn and adult repertoires for reactivity with two of five sources of self-proteins and with non-self-antigens.

XBP- 1 transcripts were rapidly upregulated in vitro by stimuli that induce plasma-cell differentiation, and were found at high levels in plasma cells from rheumatoid synovium.

40|$|Somatic {{hypermutation}} (SHM) {{and class}} switch recombination (CSR) are initiated in <b>activated</b> <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> by activation-induced deaminase (AID).

40|$|Functional {{interactions}} between T and <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> {{are necessary for}} optimal activation of an immune response. Recently, the T lymphocyte receptor CD 28 was shown to bind the B 7 counter-receptor on <b>activated</b> <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes,</b> and subsequently to costimulate interleukin 2 production and T cell proliferation. CTLA- 4 is a predicted membrane receptor from cytotoxic T cells that is homologous to CD 28 and whose gene maps to the same chromosomal band as the gene for CD 28. It is not known, however, if CD 28 and CTLA- 4 also share functional properties. To investigate functional properties of CTLA- 4, we have produced a soluble genetic fusion between the extracellular domain of CTLA- 4 and an immunoglobulin C gamma chain. Here, we show that the fusion protein encoded by this construct, CTLA 4 Ig, bound specifically to B 7 -transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells and to lymphoblastoid cells. CTLA 4 Ig also immunoprecipitated B 7 from cell surface 125 I-labeled extracts of these cells. The avidity of 125 I-labeled B 7 Ig fusion protein for immobilized CTLA 4 Ig was estimated (Kd approximately 12 nM). Finally, we show that CTLA 4 Ig was a potent inhibitor of in vitro immune responses dependent upon cellular {{interactions between}} T and <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes.</b> These findings provide direct evidence that, like its structural homologue CD 28, CTLA- 4 is able to bind the B 7 counter-receptor on <b>activated</b> <b>B</b> cells. <b>Lymphocyte</b> interactions involving the B 7 counter-receptor are functionally important for alloantigen responses in vitro...|$|R

40|$|The in vivo {{effect of}} {{bacterial}} lipopolysaccharides (LPS) on mouse spleen cell subpopulations was investigated. Intravenous administration of LPS resulted in marked {{enlargement of the}} spleen, accompanied by increased cellular proliferation and enhanced nucleated cell recoveries. At least two morphologically distinct cell types appeared to be targets for LPS. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes accumulated rapidly with a relatively minor degree of cell division.

40|$|Background: Based on the {{hypothesis}} that IgGs are potent tolerogens and that immature lymphohematopoietic antigen-presenting cells (APC), and even mature peripheral B cells, may be effective APC for tolerance induction, we designed an immunoglobulin fusion protein retroviral expression vector to test the role of B cells in a novel gene therapy strategy for the transfer of immune tolerance. Methods: An immunodominant epitope (residues 12 - 26 of the A repressor cI protein) was fused in frame to an IgG heavy chain in a retroviral vector, which was used to infect either bone marrow cells or <b>activated</b> peripheral <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes.</b> These cells were transferred into syngeneic recipients, who were subsequently challenged with the 12 - 26 peptide in adjuvant. Results: Bone marrow (BM) chimeras generated with retrovirally transduced bone marrow were shown to be profoundly unresponsive to the 12 - 26 peptide at both the humoral and cellular levels, but were competent to respond to an unrelated protein (lysozyme or PPD). Importantly, we also show that immunocompetent adult recipients infused with transduced mature, <b>activated</b> <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes,</b> are rendered unresponsive by this treatment. Surprisingly, lymphoid-deficient BM progenitors from syngeneic SCID donors could also be transduced to produce tolerogenic APC. Conclusions: Our data suggest that <b>activated</b> <b>B</b> cells are sufficient to be effective tolerogenic APC in immunocompetent adult mice, but that nonlymphoid cells may also induce tolerance in reconstituted hosts.

We compared control and FBZ-treated groups of young (age, 2 to 4 mo) and old (age, 22 to 24 mo) BALB/cN mice. The treated mice received a total of 4 wk (alternating-week treatment regimen) of FBZ-medicated feed. Spleen and bone marrow were collected for immunologic assays, and heart, stomach, intestines, kidneys, and liver were evaluated by histopathology.

In HHV- 8 +/EBV+ LCLs, which have the phenotype of <b>activated</b> <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> (CD 19 +, surface immunoglobulin M, CD 23 +, CD 30 +, CD 80 +), HHV- 8 was still present after more than 25 passages (more than 9 months of culture). Latent viral transcripts and proteins were present in nonstimulated HHV- 8 +/EBV+ LCLs. After induction by phorbol ester and n-butyrate, HHV- 8 +/EBV+ LCLs expressed lytic HHV- 8 transcripts and proteins. Moreover, HHV- 8 could be serially passaged from HHV- 8 +/EBV+ LCLs to fresh PBMC...|$|R
40|$|We have {{previously}} shown that T cell clones can mediate multiple biologic activities (1). Inducer T cell clones, for example, may stimulate immunoglobulin (Ig) secretion ~md activate mast cell and T cell proliferation (1, 2). Similarly, we found (3) that clones with {{natural killer cell}} activity can also mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Because these clones lysed syngeneic <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes,</b> we considered the possibility that this cell might {{be involved in the}} regulation of Ig secretion. We test this hypothesis in this report. We show that the antibody responses of T plus <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> containing < 1 % cloned natural killer (NK) cells are severely impaired, and the primary cellular target of suppression is the B cell. We suggest that some NK cells may regulate Ig secretion through the recognition of marker molecules expressed on the surface of <b>activated</b> <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> not linked to the major histocompatibility complex. Materials and Methods Animals. Cells for cloning were obtained from C 57 BL/ 6 mice. Cells from C 57 BL/ 6 or BALB/c mice (obtained from The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were used to produce conditioned medium. Antisera.

40|$|A {{monoclonal}} antibody, AT- 1, {{is shown}} to precipitate a p 60 - 65 molecule identical to the Tac antigen. With AT- 1, the expression of IL- 2 receptors by normal <b>activated</b> human <b>B</b> cells from peripheral blood and tonsils is documented by biosynthetic and immunofluorescence studies. AT- 1 precipitated a p 60 - 65 protein from [35 S]methionine-labeled <b>activated</b> <b>B</b> cells, similar to that from activated T cells. The interleukin 2 (IL- 2) receptor appeared shortly after activation with anti-IgM and B cell-stimulatory factor(s). Its expression reached its peak at 60 - 72 h with approximately 50 % of the B blasts stained by AT- 1. Other modes of activation of B cells, by T cell-independent, formalin- treated staphylococci and Epstein-Barr virus, and by T cell-dependent pokeweed mitogen, also induced IL- 2 receptor expression. The functional significance of this finding was investigated using recombinant IL- 2 (rIL- 2). While rIL- 2 did not induce resting B cells to proliferate {{in the presence of}} anti-IgM, it induced <b>activated</b> <b>B</b> cells to proliferate in the absence of other factors. On the other hand, rIL- 2 did not induce the differentiation of these <b>activated</b> <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes.</b> These data suggest that IL- 2 may {{play a significant role in}} B cell activation...|$|R
40|$|Mutation of Bruton's {{tyrosine}} kinase (Btk) causes human X-linked agammaglobulinemia and murine X-linked immunodeficiency syndrome (xid). Quantitative aspects of <b>B</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> development and function {{have been demonstrated}} to depend on Btk level in vivo by using a murine transgenic model system. A sensitive intracellular immunofluorescent assay was developed to measure Btk protein on a per cell basis {{to test the hypothesis}} that its dosage is dynamically regulated during B cell development or functional responses. Marrow-derived hematopoietic stem cells, common lymphoid progenitor cells, and developing B and myeloid lineages expressed Btk protein at comparable levels. Resting peripheral B lineage cells had a significantly lower amount of Btk than marrow-derived cells in both wild-type and xid mice. Activation of the B cell antigen receptor up-regulated Btk protein level 10 -fold within several hours by a phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase-dependent, posttranscriptional mechanism. In contrast, the protein level of Btk R 28 C in <b>activated</b> <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> from xid mice remained low. Bypass of the antigen receptor signaling pathways by treatment of cells with phorbol myristic acid and ionomycin rescued up-regulation of Btk protein in xid splenic B cells. These combined results suggest that certain receptor signals mediated by Btk regulate the level of expression of Btk protein in responding <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> to potentiate signal transduction. Dynamic regulation of Btk protein dosage is an additional mechanism to modulate <b>B</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> immune functions...|$|R
40|$|The virus plaque assay {{has been}} {{developed}} as a potential method for enumerating immunologically activated lymphocytes. It {{is based on the}} observation that, while resting lymphocytes are nonpermissive for a variety of RNA viruses, lymphocytes activated by antigens or mitogens are capable of producing virus. When a population of activated lymphocytes is infected with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) 1 and plated in agar above a monolayer of L cells, infectious centers or plaques are produced in the indicator layer by individual virus-producing lymphocytes (1). A variety of evidence has accrued which indicates that this assay is selective for activated T relative to <b>activated</b> <b>B</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> in the mouse (2, 3). In human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, increases in virus plaque-forming cells (V-PFC) are found after stimulation with T-cells mitogens, e. g., phytohemagglutinin (PHA) or concanavalin A (Con A), but not with a B-cell mitogen, Staphylococcus aureus, of the Cowan I strain (3, 4). In earlier studies on development of V-PFC in peripheral blood lymphocytes of tuberculin-sensitiv...|$|R
