5|$|Jenni is {{disturbed}} both by Mickey's {{belief that}} Marion's ghost wanders the estate and by Marion's self-portrait inside the house, which Jenni believes resembles her mother. When {{she begins to}} hear unexplained screaming noises and see skulls around her house, she believes that Marion is haunting her. Though Eric speculates to Jenni that Mickey, who was a childhood friend of Marion and thus dislikes Jenni, may be behind the trickery, Jenni worries that she is going insane. Eric suggests to remove Marion's self-portrait from the home. Eric and Jenni take the painting outside and burn it.

5|$|On June 28, Washington {{learned that}} the British fleet had set sail from Halifax on June 9 and were heading toward New York. On June 29, signals were sent from men {{stationed}} on Staten Island, indicating that the British fleet had appeared. Within a few hours, 45 British ships dropped anchor in Lower New York Bay. Less than a week later, there were 130 ships off Staten Island {{under the command of}} Richard Howe, the brother of the general. The population of New York went into panic <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British ships; alarms went off and troops immediately rushed to their posts. On July 2, British troops began to land on Staten Island. The continental regulars on the island took a few shots at them before fleeing, and the citizens' militia switched over to the British side.|$|E
5|$|Picard finds Bok {{waiting for}} him, who has another orb. Bok {{explains}} {{that it was}} his son in command of the Ferengi vessel at Maxia, and he came here seeking his revenge. He places the orb down and leaves Picard on the Stargazer bridge. The orb lights up once more, leaving Picard believing he is once again at the Battle of Maxia. On the Enterprise, Lt. Tasha Yar (Denise Crosby) and Lt. Worf (Michael Dorn) discover the orb brought over from the Stargazer in Picard's chest. They take it to Riker as the Stargazer powers up its weapon systems. Riker hails the Ferengi vessel and speaks to Kazago, who is suspicious <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> orb, which is a banned device. He promises to investigate.|$|E

5|$|Tegettoff {{turned his}} ships {{back to the}} south to chase Suenson, who in turn altered course to try {{to cut off the}} Prussian gunboats. As Schwarzenberg turned, the {{distance}} closed to just over , and she came under fire from all three Danish vessels. Jylland and Hejmdal then shifted fire to Radetzky. The Prussian vessels remained on the disengaged side of the Austrian frigates, firing at the Danish vessels with little effect. One of the Austrian vessels scored a hit on Jylland that killed or wounded all the men in one of her gun crews. The crews of the guns on either side fled their positions <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> carnage until one of the men returned, calling his comrades to join him. During this period of the battle, Schwarzenberg suffered multiple shell hits and was set afire three times. Her crew extinguished the first two, but the third, in her foretopsail, proved to be too difficult to fight.|$|E
5|$|The first {{clash between}} the two armies {{occurred}} on the same evening of 5 October, when Wang sent several hundred of his cavalry to attack Shan Xionxin's camp on the plain. Li sent forces from the hills to his general's aid, but the battle ended quickly {{with the arrival of}} night. This attack {{was nothing more than a}} diversion, drawing Li's attention to the east while, under cover of night, Wang sent 200 of his cavalry around and behind Li's forces. Concealing themselves in a ravine behind Li's camp, they waited. During the night Wang laid bridges across the canal, and before dawn his army crossed over and deployed in battle formation close to Li Mi's camps. At daybreak, Li Mi's troops were caught entirely by surprise <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> battle-ready enemy advancing onto them. As the camps were unfortified, the rebel troops tried to hastily form a battle line themselves, but they were unable to prevent Wang's forces from entering their encampments. At the same time, Wang signalled his hidden cavalry to attack. Charging down from the north into Li Mi's camp, the 200 horsemen began setting fire to it. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> camp to their rear going up in flames, Li Mi's army broke and fled. While Li Mi was able to escape with some 10,000 of his men, many of the rest surrendered to Wang. According to one account, Wang's victory was secured by a stratagem: one of his soldiers, who greatly resembled Li Mi, was bound and displayed to the rebel troops at the height of the battle, whereupon the latter collapsed.|$|E
5|$|Three months later, a {{masquerade}} party ensues in {{the opera}} house. At the party, Christine wears her new engagement ring from Raoul.

Raoul exits the room and Christine approaches the Phantom. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> engagement ring, the Phantom rips it from Christine and disappears into a trap on the floor. Raoul tries to follow him but is stopped by Madame Giry, who privately tells him {{the story of the}} Phantom's past. When she was a little girl, she went to a freak circus where they featured a deformed child in a cage. The child was beaten while everyone watched and laughed. The ringmaster then removed a burlap sack covering the child's face, revealing his deformity. Only the young Madame Giry pitied him. She was the last to leave and saw the child strangle the ringmaster with a rope. Chased by the police, Madame Giry helped him escape and found shelter for him beneath the opera house, where she has hidden him from the world ever since.|$|E

Then Ribault called a halt, sounded a trumpet-call, and displayed a white flag, to which MenÃ©ndez replied in the same fashion. The Spaniards having refused to cross at the invitation of Ribault, a French sailor swam over to them, and came back immediately in an Indian canoe, bringing the request that Ribault send over someone authorized to state what he wanted.|$|E

25|$|On 17 November 2002, the {{oil tanker}} Prestige split {{in half and}} sank in the Atlantic Ocean, after having had a huge leak in its tanks. A few days later, Man woke up to find his life ruined by an oil spill. Tons of oil had washed {{up on the beach}} where he lived. Most of his sculptures were irremediably {{destroyed}} and the oil even reached his house. Man was absolutely devastated, his whole life work destroyed before his eyes, and the natural environment where he lived heavily polluted for years to come. A month later, he was found dead in his hut. He had circulatory and respiratory problems, but most local people believe that he died of melancholy and sadness <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> complete and utter destruction of his life by the oil spill.

25|$|The next day, {{the hunters}} separate, {{with the younger}} one manning a spot high on a cliff near a {{waterfall}}. He descends from his post to wash {{up in a small}} waterfall in the hills. His gun out of reach, the hunter suddenly finds himself cornered by the grizzly, who rears and roars <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> man. Faced with certain death, the hunter cowers in fear. The grizzly, seemingly affected by the hunter's distress, turns and leaves. The young hunter, impressed by the bear's act of mercy, attempts to scare him off more quickly by shooting his gun into the air. When the hunter's companion joins him, having heard the gunshots, the younger man tells him that the bear is dead. However, spying the bear ascending a scree, the older man raises his rifle to shoot, only to be stopped by the other man. The three hunters return to their camp empty-handed, where they free the young cub and then ride off into the wilderness.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} morning of 16 April 1917 the Nivelle Offensive was launched. In the sector where the tanks {{operated}} the initial waves of French infantry succeeded in taking {{the first and second}} German trenches as planned, but with very heavy losses. The French artillery was insufficient in number to simultaneously sustain the creeping barrage and suppress the numerous German artillery batteries. This was aggravated by the German air superiority which allowed artillery observation planes to precisely direct German interdiction fire on the advancing French columns. Groupement ChaubÃ¨s suffered many losses before it was even able to leave the French lines. When arriving at the frontline in the early afternoon, it had to assist the infantry in clearing the second trench of the last German remnants. These did not panic <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French tanks but had been trained to hide from them, leaving their cover to engage the French infantry when the armoured vehicles had moved on. At the end of the day, the French infantry proved unable to continue the offensive and the last surviving French tanks had to be withdrawn. More to the east, north of Berry-au-Bac after which village later the entire tank action would be named, Groupement Bossut proved more successful. It managed to cross the various trench lines losing only a few vehicles and in the late morning concentrated to carry on the offensive. However, around 11:00 the tank of Bossut, Trompe-la-Mort ("Dare-devil") leading the advance, carrying a tricolour fanion blessed in the SacrÃ©-CÅur at Montmartre, received a direct heavy artillery hit, incinerating most of the crew and blowing Bossut himself from the rear entrance from which he had been directing the battle, killed by a shell splinter through the heart. Nevertheless, the Schneiders continued their progress, advancing several miles in a narrow penetration through a shallow valley towards the third German trench. The weakened infantry though, was unable to follow, forcing the tanks to wait for the arrival of reserve units. For several hours the tanks moved up and down the conquered terrain to avoid presenting static targets for the German artillery. Despite this many vehicles were hit, as they were in plain sight of German batteries on the surrounding hills. Flank assaults by Bavarian stormtroopers were repulsed. In the early evening, fresh infantry units together with the tanks conquered a sector of the third trench, marking the high tide of the French progress during the entire Second Battle of the Aisne. The Schneiders then withdrew, again suffering losses by artillery fire.|$|E
