40|$|Estimates of beaver (Castor canadensis) density play an {{important}} role in wildlife managers’ decisions about beaver population management, because managers anticipate higher incidence of problem complaints when a beaver population increases. To manage the impacts of beavers in an urbanizing landscape, managers need better information on changes in stakeholder beliefs and attitudes as beaver and human densities reach high levels. We conducted additional analysis of data collected in 2002 through mail surveys of residents in New York and Massachusetts to test hypothesized relationships between beaver density and damage experience, attitudes toward beavers, and norms about beaver management actions. Consistent with previous research, we found a correlation between personal experience with beaver-related problems, lower <b>acceptance</b> <b>capacity</b> for beavers, and higher acceptability of lethal beaver management actions. In comparison to residents living in areas with low beaver density, residents of areas with high beaver density were more likely to: experience beaver-related problems; believe that beaver-related damage had greatly increased in their area; express a preference for beaver population reduction; express less tolerant attitudes toward beaver presence; and accept lethal control of beavers as a response to beaver-related problems. These findings add to understanding of wildlife <b>acceptance</b> <b>capacity,</b> generally, and tolerance of beavers specifically. Based on our findings, we propose a conceptual model representing key dynamic interrelationships between stakeholder attitudes, norms, and common beaver management practices. We discuss a causal loop diagram representing the model to illuminate the challenges wildlife managers are likely to face as the context for beaver management changes. The model articulates the dynamic complexity of urban beaver management and fills a gap in the literature by conceptualizing beaver management as a coupled human–natural system. Such models may aid communication in locales where high densities of beaver and people set the stage for human–wildlife conflict and emergence of disruptive wildlife management issues...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWater {{resources}} {{management is}} a worldwide {{challenge for the}} 21 st century. Water resources management in urbanized cities {{raises the question of}} cohabitation between the collective wastewater services and the individualized systems. Thus, an objective measure of efficiency is required: this can be done by evaluating the level of provided service instead of evaluating the means available themselves. For several decades, the emergence of new alternative technologies has been raising the question of services efficiency offered by traditional technologies used in drainage management. This question is emphasized by the need for a global management of wastewater systems and the evolution of legislation, from discharges standards ("emission based") to standards in environment <b>acceptance</b> <b>capacities</b> ("immision based"). Integrating these impacts becomes a necessary step in order to plan sustainable drainage decisions. In this context, a methodology, named EDASR 1, is proposed to support wastewater management strategies. This methodology is applied on the SIVOM (Intermunicipal Union with multiple vocations) of the Mulhousian agglomeration (Alsace, France).

A nonrandom distribution of viral tRNAs was found compared with tRNA from normal liver or from AMV-infected leukemic myeloblasts, confirming previous reports. Methionine and proline tRNAs were considerably enriched, whereas glutamic acid, glutamine, serine, tyrosine, and valine tRNAs were markedly depleted in AMV relative to homologous cellular tRNAs. The seven AMV tRNAs {{with the greatest}} amino acid <b>acceptance</b> <b>capacities,</b> which were in order methionine, proline, lysine, arginine, histidine, isoleucine, and threonine tRNAs, were compared with homologous tRNAs from leukemic myeloblasts and liver by reversed-phase 5 chromatography. Of the 25 isoaccepting chromatographic fractions identified, no tRNA species unique to AMV was detected. Only methionyl-tRNA showed a substantial quantitative variation in isoaccepting species compared with the host cell. Thus, viral selectivity for amino acid-specific tRNAs is not, generally, paralleled by selectivity for individual isoaccepting tRNA species. Qualitative differences in arginyl- and histidyl-tRNA isoaccepting species were discovered in virus and leukemic myeloblasts compared with liver.

40|$|Introduction] The {{concentration}} of hydronium and hydroxide at the water-air interface {{has been under}} debate for a long time. Recent evidence {{from a range of}} experiments and theoretical calculations strongly suggests the water surface is somewhat acidic. Using novel polarizable models we have performed potential of mean force calculations of a hydronium ion, a hydroxide ion and a water molecule in a water droplet and a water slab {{and we were able to}} rationalize that hydronium, but not hydroxide, is slightly enriched at the surface for two reasons. First, because the hydrogen-bond <b>acceptance</b> <b>capacity</b> of hydronium is weaker than water it is more favorable to have the hydronium oxygen on the surface. Second, hydroxide ions are expelled from the surface of droplets, due to the entropy being lower when a hydroxide ion is hydrated on the surface. As a result, the water dissociation constant pK w increases slightly near the surface. The results are corroborated by calculations of surface tension of NaOH solutions that are in reasonable agreement with experiment. The structural and thermodynamic interpretation of hydronium and hydroxide hydration provided by these calculations opens the route to a better understanding of atmospheric- and surface chemistry...|$|E
40|$|The {{management}} of severe congestion in complex urban networks calls for dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) models that can replicate real traffic situations with long queues and spillbacks. DynaMIT-P, a mesoscopic traffic simulation system, was enhanced and calibrated {{to capture the}} traffic characteristics in a sub-area of Beijing, China. The network had 1698 nodes and 3180 directed links {{in an area of}} around 18 square miles. There were 2927 non-zero origin–destination (OD) pairs and around 630, 000 vehicles were simulated over 4 h of the morning peak. All demand and supply parameters were calibrated simultaneously using sensor counts and floating car travel time data. Successful calibration was achieved with the Path-size Logit route choice model, which accounted for overlapping routes. Furthermore, explicit representations of lane groups were required to properly model traffic delays and queues. A modified treatment of <b>acceptance</b> <b>capacity</b> was required to model the large number of short links in the transportation network (close to the length of one vehicle).

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that tropical soils (mainly Oxisols) have excellent physical characteristics such as high infiltration rates, high permeability of water, good and stable soil structure and that consequently, they can support mechanized agriculture. However in the Eastern Plains (Llanos Orientales) of Colombia, when Oxisols are subjected to tillage using disc harrow, soil physical conditions deteriorate rapidly.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate whether DNA hypomethylation in peripheral blood DNA (potentially representing status at the lung) was associated with increased risk for the development of lung cancer. We evaluated genome-wide and p 53 gene-specific hypomethylation in 100 lung cancer cases and controls selected from a large clinical trial of male smokers, the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study. Genome-wide methylation status was assessed using the in vitro methyl <b>acceptance</b> <b>capacity</b> assay and p 53 gene-specific methylation status using the HpaII quantitative PCR assay. Hypomethylation was evaluated as a risk factor using multivariate conditional logistic regression analyses. Genome-wide methylation status was unrelated to lung cancer risk; the odds ratio was 1. 25 and the 95 % confidence interval was 0. 48 – 3. 21 for those in the highest versus lowest quartile of hypomethylation status. Hypomethylation of the p 53 gene in exons 5 – 8, the hypermutable region, was associated with a 2 -fold increased risk for lung cancer (odds ratio, 2. 20; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 04 – 4. 65), whereas there was no risk increase for hypomethylation at exons 2 – 4, a region of the gene not known for its mutability or functional significance in cancer.

40|$|Make-to-order (MTO) {{operations}} have to effectively manage {{their capacity to}} make long-term sustainable profits. This objective can be met by selectively accepting available customer orders and simultaneously planning for capacity. We model a MTO operation of a job-shop with multiple resources having regular and non-regular capacity. The MTO firm has a set of customer orders at time zero with fixed due-dates. The process route, processing times, and sales price for each order are given. Since orders compete for limited resources, the firm can only accept some orders. In this paper a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) is proposed to aid an operational manager to decide which orders to accept and how to allocate resources such that the overall profit is maximized. A branch-and-price (B&P) algorithm is devised to solve the MILP effectively. The MILP is first decomposed into a master problem and several sub-problems using Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition. Each sub-problem is represented as a network flow problem and an exact procedure is proposed to solve the sub-problems efficiently. We also propose an approximate B&P scheme, Lagrangian bounds, and approximations to fathom nodes in the branch-and-bound tree. Computational analysis shows that the proposed B&P algorithm can solve large problem instances with relatively short time.

These demands, typically leading to Negative Active Material (NAM) failure, include: short, high-current surges; prolonged, minimal, overvoltage charging; repeated, Ah deficit charging; and frequent deep discharges. Research shows these failure mechanisms are attenuated by inclusion of carbon allotropes into the NAM. Addition of significant quantities of carbon, however, produces detrimental changes in paste rheology, leading to lowered industrial throughput. Additionally, capacity, cold-cranking performance, and other battery metrics are negatively affected at high carbon loads.
