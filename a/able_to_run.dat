It also was present in Bob Bakker's Raptor Red (1995), as a Utahraptor prey item. A main belt asteroid, , has been named 9941 Iguanodon in honour of the genus.|$|E
5|$|For the {{introduction}} of London Underground services, the original station was completely demolished and rebuilt. The station was provided with two additional platforms, giving four in total. The platforms comprise two parallel islands with tracks on both sides. This was necessary as {{the intention of the}} Northern Heights project was that trains would be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> south from East Finchley to Highgate via both the surface and the underground routes. The inner pair of tracks served the surface route, whilst the outer pair serve the tunnel route.|$|E
5|$|Fresno State was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> a 7-play, 72-yard {{drive to}} begin the fourth quarter that culminated with a 32-yard field goal by Breshears making the score 29-10. Any chance of a Bulldog {{comeback}} was quashed after Carr threw two interceptions returned for touchdowns to Reed and Hayden Greenbauer, the latter of which came with just 1:14 to play. The final score was 43-10, the Mustangs victorious.|$|E

5|$|Having {{recovered}} the ball, and with Virginia Tech having no remaining timeouts {{and no way}} to stop the clock, Florida State was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> out the remaining time in the game and secure a 2722 victory.

The penalties had no effect on the final outcome of the game, and Florida State won the ACC Championship Game and an automatic bid to the 2006 Orange Bowl.|$|E
5|$|SMP2 {{supports}} {{a trial of}} a special category of bigadv work units, designed to simulate proteins that are unusually large and computationally intensive {{and have a great}} scientific priority. These units originally required a minimum of eight CPU cores, which was raised to sixteen later, on February7, 2012. Along with these added hardware requirements over standard SMP2 work units, they require more system resources such as random-access memory (RAM) and Internet bandwidth. In return, users who run these are rewarded with a 20% increase over SMP2's bonus point system. The bigadv category allows Folding@home to run especially demanding simulations for long times that had formerly required use of supercomputing clusters and could not be performed anywhere else on Folding@home. Many users with hardware <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> bigadv units have later had their hardware setup deemed ineligible for bigadv work units when CPU core minimums were increased, leaving them only <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> the normal SMP work units. This frustrated many users who invested significant amounts of money into the program only to have their hardware be obsolete for bigadv purposes shortly after. As a result, Vijay Pande announced in January 2014 that the bigadv program would end on January 31, 2015.|$|E
5|$|The Scottish Challenge Cup {{has been}} {{sponsored}} several times {{since it was}} introduced in 1990. The sponsor {{has been able to}} determine the name of the competition. There have been four sponsors since the competition's formation as well as several name changes within the duration of each sponsorship. The competition relies on revenue earned from sponsorship although it has been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> without a sponsor over two periods but had to be suspended for one season in 1998–99 as a consequence.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the players}} are named after the game {{developers}} (M. Parker is Marshall Parker, G. Anders is Gavan Anderson, A. Milgrom is Alfred Milgrom).

5|$|After Sebastian Vettel's {{surprise}} victory {{two weeks}} prior in Malaysia, {{eyes were on}} Ferrari whether {{they would be able}} to continue their good race pace in China and challenge the Mercedes for the win. As lower track temperatures were expected for the race, a serious competitiveness of Ferrari was cast into doubt, as they had benefited from lower tyre degradation in the heat of Malaysia. All ten teams taking part in the championship participated in the race, with Marussia hoping to finally be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> both cars continually, after Will Stevens had failed to start in Malaysia.|$|E
5|$|Data {{from the}} ZDR was {{passed to the}} All-Target Processor (ATP), which ran initial {{processing}} on as many as 625 objects in a cloud. As many as 50 of these could be picked out for further processing in the Discrimination and Control Computer (DCC), which ran more tests on those tracks and assigned each one a probability of being the warhead or decoy. The DCC was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> 100 different tests. For exoatmospheric signals the tests included measure of radar return pulse-to-pulse to look for tumbling objects, as well as variations in signals strength due to changes in frequency. Within the atmosphere, the primary method was examining the velocities of the objects to determine their mass.|$|E
5|$|Exceptionally heavy {{rainfall}} in November 2012 caused a major {{break in the}} Grand Western Canal's banks, near Halberton, necessitating nearby homes to be evacuated. Two temporary dams were installed which allowed {{the rest of the}} canal to remain open and meant the horse drawn barge at Tiverton was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> throughout the summer of 2013. Around 400 fish were returned to the canal from a flooded field but many fish including pike, eels, perch, bream, tench and roach were lost. About 25 people from the Environment Agency and Tiverton Angling Club assisted with saving the fish. The Environment Agency restocked the canal with 3,000 fish in January 2013 and by May the Environment Agency said they were flourishing.|$|E
50|$|J++ {{applications}} {{using these}} features {{could not be}} run on Sun's Java SDK, but the Kaffe project developed extensions which made it possible <b>to</b> <b>run</b> J++ applications with these features on their open sourced JVM.

He has an older brother who is a doctor. Garfield was a gymnast and a swimmer during his early years, and was also an avid philatelist. He had originally intended to study business but became interested in acting at the age of sixteen when a friend convinced him to take Theatre Studies at A-level as they were one pupil short of being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> the class. Garfield attended Priory Preparatory School in Banstead and later City of London Freemen's School in Ashtead, before training at the Central School of Speech and Drama, University of London, from which he graduated in 2004.|$|E

5|$|On 17 February 1997, the W3C {{approved}} Yggdrasil {{to coordinate}} future development of Arena. Development {{was taken over}} by Yggdrasil, with the idea to turn Arena into an open source X Window System browser licensed under the GNU General Public License. Yggdrasil licensed an X emulator from Pearl Software to port Arena to Windows, although these builds were never released. Yggdrasil didn't provide any official binaries at this time, because they didn't want to expand the community with alpha-quality software. Although users would be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> Arena by compiling it from the published source code, volunteers created unofficial finished binaries. Yggdrasil had planned to implement browsing features that were already standard in competitive web browsers, which resulted in the new bookmarks feature in version 0.3.18 on 7 April 1997.|$|E
