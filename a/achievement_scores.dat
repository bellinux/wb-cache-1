25|$|University of California, Berkeley Professor David L. Kirp, in his 2011 book, Kids First, and his 2013 book, Improbable Scholars, praised Union City's {{education}} system for bringing poor, mostly immigrant kids (three quarters of whom live in homes where only Spanish is spoken {{and a quarter}} of which {{are thought to be}} undocumented and fearful of deportation) into the educational mainstream. Kirp, who spent a year in Union City examining its schools, notes that while in the late 1970s, Union City schools faced the threat of state takeover, they now boast <b>achievement</b> <b>scores</b> that approximate the statewide average. Kirp also observes that in 2011, Union City boasted a high school graduation rate of 89.5 percent—roughly 10 percentage points higher than the national average, and that in 2012, 75 percent of Union City graduates enrolled in college, with top students winning scholarships to the Ivy League. Kirp singles out the city's practice of enrolling almost every 3- and 4-year-old in kindergarten, and the leadership of Union City High School principal John Bennetti for the positive educational atmosphere in that school.|$|E

40|$|The {{existence}} of national plus schools in Indonesia is expanding, As one) f the national plus schools in Surabaya, Masa Depan Cerah Elementary School (MDC) adopts both national and English Singaporean curriculum. Although reading {{as one of}} the English basic language skills is taught in MDC, students' reading <b>achievement</b> <b>score</b> is 65 which below the expected passing grade (70). To improve the situation of increasing third graders reading achivement score, the researcher deciced to conduct the classroom action research CAR) using KWL (Know, Want and Learn) reading technique. KWL is chosen because it activates students' schemeta or prior knowledge and broaden their metacognitive ability by absorbing new knowledge from the text they read. Therefore, the research is laid upon a research question of knowing how is the improvement of the reading ac:hievement of the third graders of MDC elementary school after being taught using KWL reading technique? •	The implementation of KWL reading tecnique is done by some of the previous researchers, such as by Priyono in 2009 about improving his IX JPS 3 students reading and also by Sulistyawati in 2010 for her fifth students reading. Both of them were using KWL reading technique and were succesfully able to improve their students reading achievement. Thus, the KWL reading technique is well trusted to improved students' reading <b>achievement</b> <b>score.</b> To have sufficient data, this CAR was conducted through three cycles that conveyed in planning, acting, observing and reflecting. The implementation of KWL with multiple activities was executed in every meeting of each cycle. The score data gathered in every cycle was calculated quantitatively by using students' T-test through the comparison of pretest and posttest result score. Besides calculating the score, the process of the implementation of KWL in each cycle was reflected qualitatively in this research. After the execution of KWL reading technique, students'	reading <b>achievement</b> <b>score</b> was raised above the standardized score. On the first cycle, their reading <b>achievement</b> <b>score</b> was 73 which ranged points of the reading pre test. On the second cycle their reading <b>achievement</b> <b>score</b> was 84 which ranged• 19 points of the pre test. From the third cycle execution, their reading <b>achievement</b> <b>score</b> was 89 which was ranged 24 points of their pre test. Therefore, the implementation of KWL reading succesfully improved third graders reading <b>achievement</b> <b>score.</b> Besides, students were also more enthusiastic and had unstressful reading lesson. Thus, the research question was asnwered through the implementation ofKWL reading technique. Based on the findings, the implementation of KWL reading improved students' reading <b>achievement</b> <b>score</b> beyond the standardized score. Besides, the positive environment of reading lesson was built ince student enjoyed aU activities in KWL reading. Thus, KWL reading technique is not only to impmve the reading <b>achievement</b> <b>score,</b> but also to make the reading lesson enjoyable for students...|$|R
2500|$|Value-added {{modeling}} (also {{known as}} value-added analysis and value-added assessment) {{is a method}} of teacher evaluation that measures the teacher's contribution {{in a given year}} by comparing the current test scores of their students to the scores of those same students in previous school years, {{as well as to the}} scores of other students in the same grade. In this manner, value-added modeling seeks to isolate the contribution, or value added, that each teacher provides in a given year, which can be compared to the performance measures of other teachers. VAMs are considered to be fairer than simply comparing student <b>achievement</b> <b>scores</b> or gain scores without considering potentially confounding context variables like past performance or income. [...] It is also possible to use this approach to estimate the value added by the school principal or the school as a whole.|$|E

The subjects were 51 students, aged 8 - 0 to 12 - 0, who had been referred for psychoeducational assessment because of suspected learning disabilities. They were evaluated with both the K-ABC and the WISC-R as part of a standard battery. Descriptive statistics and univariate correlations were computed. Multiple regression procedures revealed that significant relationships existed between the composite of predictor variables, the Wechsler Verbal and Performance IQ's, and the criterion variables, the K-ABC Mental Processing Composite and the K-ABC <b>Achievement</b> <b>score</b> when each was considered separately. Stepwise multiple regression procedures indicated that the unique contribution of the Wechsler Verbal IQ to the prediction of the K-ABC Mental Processing Composite was statistically significant.
