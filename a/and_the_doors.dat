5|$|The band Spiff Rouch {{formed in}} 1976 in the Mornington Peninsula suburb of Mount Eliza on the {{outskirts}} of Melbourne. The group lineup featured James Reyne, brothers Bill and Guy McDonough, Paul Williams, Robert Walker and Simon Binks.

5|$|A station {{house is}} located above both platforms, {{containing}} a crossover, waiting area and fare control. The single street staircase outside of fare control {{goes down to}} West Road by the intersection of Noel Road next to the Rockaway-bound platform. This platform also has a set of exit-only turnstiles leading directly to this staircase so riders exiting the station on this side {{do not have to}} go through the station house. The station house is heated, while the platforms feature passenger-activated heaters; these heaters, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> separating the station house and staircases, were not originally part of the station. The station house used to have 1950s-era signage at its front entrance reading, but now only has modern MTA entrance signs.|$|E

5|$|The Buddhists in Saigon {{were aware}} that a raid on the pagodas was imminent. Buddhist {{relatives}} of Special Forces and combat police personnel had tipped off the monks, and Buddhists who lived near pagodas had observed them move into {{the region in the}} lead-up. American journalists were tipped off and traveled through Saigon to visit the pagodas ahead of the raids. The pagodas had been locked by the monks in preparation for the attacks <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> were barricaded with furniture and reinforced by nailing wooden planks across them. The monks told members of the U.S. press corps in Saigon that the raids were coming, allowing them to be more prepared for the event than the U.S. embassy.|$|E
5|$|The train {{doors were}} {{originally}} designed to be opened and closed automatically <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> would re-open if an object blocked them, much as elevator doors do. Almost immediately after the system opened in 1976 Metro realized these features were not conducive to safe or efficient operation and they were disabled. At present the doors may be opened automatically or manually. If a door tries to close and it meets an obstruction, the operator must re-open the door.|$|E
5|$|The Norman invaders of the 11th century {{took the}} city without resistance, {{and by the}} 12th century the walls were ill-maintained and of little {{military}} value. Fears of a French invasion during the Hundred Years' War led to an enquiry into Canterbury's defences in 1363. The decision was taken to restore the city walls and for around the next thirty years the old Roman defences were freshly rebuilt in stone, incorporating the older walls where they still remained. 24 towers were constructed around the circuit, and over the coming years many of the gatehouses were rebuilt in stone and brick, defended {{by some of the}} first batteries of guns in England. Parts of the wall were deliberately damaged by Parliament during the English Civil War of the 17th century <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> to the city's gates burnt; with the restoration of Charles II in 1660, new doors were reinstalled.|$|E

5|$|The {{counterculture}} was a youth {{movement that}} included political activism, especially {{in opposition to}} the Vietnam War, and the promotion of various hippie ideals. The hippies were associated primarily with two kinds of music: the folk-rock and country rock of people like Bob Dylan and Gram Parsons, and the psychedelic rock of bands like Jefferson Airplane <b>and</b> <b>The</b> <b>Doors.</b> This movement was very closely connected to the British Invasion, a wave of bands from the United Kingdom who became popular throughout much of the 1960s. The British Invasion initially included bands like the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and The Zombies who were later joined by bands like the Moody Blues and The Who. The sound of these bands was hard-edged rock, with the Beatles originally known for songs that resembled classic black rock songs by Little Richard, Chuck Berry, Smokey Robinson, The Shirelles and the Isley Brothers. Later, as the counterculture developed, The Beatles began using more advanced techniques and unusual instruments, such as the sitar, as well as more original lyrics.|$|E
5|$|To {{replace the}} aging Class C trains, from 1985 to 1987, ten T4s were {{converted}} to T1300. They were equipped with a pantograph, received a new front <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> were moved. Six additional T4s were converted in 1989, and given the designation T8. These only had the pantographs equipped and kept the same front and door arrangement. With {{the introduction of the}} T1300, the western lines could remove the conductor and have single-manned trains with the motorman selling tickets. The T1300-units have had better regularity than the older models they replaced. However, because they are designed for a closed system with automatic train protection, the braking systems are not sufficiently dimensioned for when the drivers use line of sight to regulate the speed and distances between trains. The 1300 units were numbered 1301–1349. After the conversions, Oslo Sporveier operated 49 T1300-cars and 146 T1000-cars. The trains were originally painted red with a beige cheatline.|$|E
5|$|As {{the crew}} began {{to prepare for}} arrival at Sioux City, they {{questioned}} whether they should deploy the landing gear or belly-land the aircraft with the gear retracted. They decided that having the landing gear down would provide some shock absorption on impact. The complete hydraulic failure left the landing gear lowering mechanism inoperative. Two options were available to the flight crew. The DC-10 is designed such that if hydraulic pressure to the landing gear is lost, the gear will fall down slightly and rest on the landing gear doors. Placing the regular landing gear handle in the down position will unlock the doors mechanically, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> and landing gear will then fall down into place and lock due to gravity. An alternative system is also available using a lever in the cockpit floor to cause the landing gear to fall into position. This lever has {{the added benefit of}} unlocking the outboard ailerons, which are not used in high-speed flight and are locked in a neutral position. The crew hoped that there might be some trapped hydraulic fluid in the outboard ailerons and that they might regain some use of flight controls by unlocking them. They elected to extend the gear with the alternative system. Although the gear deployed successfully, there was no change in the controllability of the aircraft.|$|E

25|$|The {{doors of}} the West-gate were made so that, when shut, they were from the outside {{invisible}} and unopenable by physical means. However to aid friendly visitors, the gateway was flanked by two giant holly-trees, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> were decorated with a design which became visible by uttering a password. This design contained a second password which enabled the doors to magically open. From the inside, the doors could be opened by normal means.|$|E
25|$|There is {{some doubt}} about the genuineness of an {{ordinance}} attributed to Roman Emperor Constantine, in which abstinence from public business was enforced for the seven days immediately preceding Easter Sunday, and also for the seven which followed it.
