5|$|<b>A</b> <b>biopsy</b> by fine needle aspiration, often {{guided by}} {{endoscopic}} ultrasound, {{may be used}} where there is uncertainty over the diagnosis, but a histologic diagnosis is not usually required for removal of the tumor by surgery to go ahead.|$|E
5|$|If {{there is}} {{doubt about the}} cause of the skin lesions, <b>a</b> <b>biopsy</b> of the skin may be {{performed}} to distinguish the purpura from other diseases that cause it, such as vasculitis due to cryoglobulinemia; on microscopy the appearances are of a hypersensitivity vasculitis, and immunofluorescence demonstrates IgA and C3 (a protein of the complement system) in the blood vessel wall. However, overall serum complement levels are normal.|$|E
5|$|Primary lung cancers {{themselves}} {{most commonly}} metastasize to the brain, bones, liver and adrenal glands. Immunostaining of <b>a</b> <b>biopsy</b> is often helpful {{to determine the}} original source. The presence of Napsin-A, TTF-1, CK7 and CK20 are helpful in confirming the subtype of lung carcinoma. SCLC derived from neuroendocrine cells may express CD56, neural cell adhesion molecule, synaptophysin or chromogranin.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> lung <b>biopsy</b> is {{required}} if the {{clinical history and}} imaging are not clearly suggestive of a specific diagnosis or malignancy cannot otherwise be ruled out. In cases where <b>a</b> lung <b>biopsy</b> is indicated, <b>a</b> trans-bronchial <b>biopsy</b> is usually unhelpful, and <b>a</b> surgical lung <b>biopsy</b> is often required.|$|R
50|$|In <b>a</b> nerve <b>biopsy,</b> <b>a</b> {{small sample}} of the nerve {{is removed from the}} body and {{examined}} in a laboratory. <b>A</b> nerve <b>biopsy</b> may be necessary when a patient experiences numbness, pain, or weakness in places such as the fingers or toes. <b>A</b> nerve <b>biopsy</b> can help to determine the cause of such symptoms.The procedure is usually only performed when all other options have failed in determining the cause of a disease. It is an outpatient procedure that is performed under local anesthetic.|$|R
50|$|If ADH {{is found}} on <b>a</b> core (needle) <b>biopsy</b> (<b>a</b> {{procedure}} which generally does not excise a suspicious mammographic abnormality), <b>a</b> surgical <b>biopsy,</b> i.e. <b>a</b> breast lumpectomy, to completely excise the abnormality and exclude {{breast cancer is}} the typical recommendation.|$|R
5|$|An X-ray of {{swallowed}} barium {{may be used}} {{to reveal}} {{the size and shape of}} the esophagus, and the presence of any masses. The esophagus may also be imaged using a flexible camera inserted into the esophagus, in a procedure called an endoscopy. If an endoscopy is used on the stomach, the camera will also have to pass through the esophagus. During an endoscopy, <b>a</b> <b>biopsy</b> may be taken. If cancer of the esophagus is being investigated, other methods, including a CT scan, may also be used.|$|E
5|$|Dilation and {{curettage}} or an {{endometrial biopsy}} {{are used to}} obtain a tissue sample for histological examination. Endometrial biopsy is the less invasive option, {{but it may not}} give conclusive results every time. Hysteroscopy only shows the gross anatomy of the endometrium, which is often not indicative of cancer, and is therefore not used, unless in conjunction with <b>a</b> <b>biopsy.</b> Hysteroscopy can be used to confirm a diagnosis of cancer. New evidence shows that D has a higher false negative rate than endometrial biopsy.|$|E
5|$|Muscle biopsy can {{be useful}} if an episode of {{rhabdomyolysis}} {{is thought to be}} the result of an underlying muscle disorder. <b>A</b> <b>biopsy</b> sample taken during an episode is often uninformative, as it will show only evidence of cell death or may appear normal. Taking the sample is therefore delayed for several weeks or months. The histopathological appearance on the biopsy indicates the nature of the underlying disorder. For instance, mitochondrial diseases are characterized by ragged red fibers. Biopsy sites may be identified by medical imaging, such as magnetic resonance imaging, as the muscles may not be uniformly affected.|$|E
50|$|In <b>an</b> incisional <b>biopsy</b> <b>a</b> cut is {{made through}} the entire dermis down to the subcutanous fat. <b>A</b> punch <b>biopsy</b> is {{essentially}} <b>an</b> incisional <b>biopsy,</b> except it is round rather than elliptical as in most incisional <b>biopsies</b> done with <b>a</b> scalpel. Incisional <b>biopsies</b> can include the whole lesion (excisional), part of a lesion, {{or part of the}} affected skin plus part of the normal skin (to show the interface between normal and abnormal skin). Incisional biopsy often yield better diagnosis for deep pannicular skin diseases and more subcutanous tissue can be obtained than <b>a</b> punch <b>biopsy.</b> Long and thin deep incisional biopsy are excellent on the lower extremities as they allow a large amount of tissue to be harvested with minimal tension on the surgical wound. Advantage of the incisional biopsy over the punch method is that hemostasis can be done more easily due to better visualization. Dog ear defects are rarely seen in incisional biopsies with length at least twice as long as the width.|$|R
50|$|Histomorphometry of bone {{involves}} obtaining <b>a</b> bone <b>biopsy</b> specimen {{and processing}} of bone specimens in the laboratory, obtaining {{estimates of the}} proportional volumes and surfaces occupied by different components of bone. First the bone is broken down by baths in highly concentrated ethanol and acetone. The bone is then embedded and stained {{so that it can}} be visualized/analyzed under a microscope. Obtaining <b>a</b> bone <b>biopsy</b> is accomplished by using <b>a</b> bone <b>biopsy</b> trephine.|$|R

5|$|If the {{clinical}} diagnosis is uncertain, a skin biopsy or scraping may be performed {{to rule out}} other disorders and to confirm the diagnosis. Skin from <b>a</b> <b>biopsy</b> will show clubbed epidermal projections that interdigitate with dermis on microscopy. Epidermal thickening is another characteristic histologic finding of psoriasis lesions. The stratum granulosum layer of the epidermis is often missing or significantly decreased in psoriatic lesions; the skin cells from the most superficial layer of skin are also abnormal as they never fully mature. Unlike their mature counterparts, these superficial cells keep their nucleus. Inflammatory infiltrates can typically be visualized on microscopy when examining skin tissue or joint tissue affected by psoriasis. Epidermal skin tissue affected by psoriatic inflammation often has many CD8+ T cells while a predominance of CD4+ T cells makes up the inflammatory infiltrates of the dermal layer of skin and the joints.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{treatment}} for endometrial cancer is surgery; 90% {{of women with}} endometrial cancer are treated with some form of surgery. Surgical treatment typically consists of hysterectomy including a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, which is {{the removal of the}} uterus, and both ovaries and Fallopian tubes. Lymphadenectomy, or removal of pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes, is performed for tumors of histologic grade II or above. Lymphadenectomy is routinely performed for all stages of endometrial cancer in the United States, but in the United Kingdom, the lymph nodes are typically only removed with disease of stage II or greater. The topic of lymphadenectomy and what survival benefit it offers in stage I disease is still being debated. In stage III and IV cancers, cytoreductive surgery is the norm, and <b>a</b> <b>biopsy</b> of the omentum may also be included. In stage IV disease, where there are distant metastases, surgery can be used as part of palliative therapy. Laparotomy, an open-abdomen procedure, is the traditional surgical procedure; however, laparoscopy (keyhole surgery) is associated with lower operative morbidity. The two procedures have no difference in overall survival. Removal of the uterus via the abdomen is recommended over removal of the uterus via the vagina because it gives the opportunity to examine and obtain washings of the abdominal cavity to detect any further evidence of cancer. Staging of the cancer is done during the surgery.|$|E
25|$|The only {{test that}} can fully confirm the {{diagnosis}} of prostate cancer is <b>a</b> <b>biopsy,</b> the removal of small pieces of the prostate for microscopic examination. However, prior to <b>a</b> <b>biopsy,</b> less invasive testing can be conducted.|$|E
50|$|In medicine, <b>a</b> muscle <b>biopsy</b> is <b>a</b> {{procedure}} {{in which a}} piece of muscle tissue is removed from an organism and examined microscopically. <b>A</b> muscle <b>biopsy</b> {{can lead to the}} discovery of problems with the nervous system, connective tissue, vascular system, or musculoskeletal system.|$|R

Prostate biopsies are routinely done on an outpatient basis and rarely require hospitalization. Antibiotics should be used to prevent complications like fever, urinary tract infections, and sepsis. Fifty-five percent of men report discomfort during prostate biopsy.|$|E

25|$|If {{the person}} has kidney failure or {{cutaneous}} vasculitis, <b>a</b> <b>biopsy</b> is obtained from the kidneys. On rare occasions, thoracoscopic lung biopsy is required. On histopathological examination, <b>a</b> <b>biopsy</b> will show leukocytoclastic vasculitis with necrotic changes and granulomatous inflammation (clumps of typically arranged white blood cells) on microscopy. These granulomas are {{the main reason for}} the name granulomatosis with polyangiitis, although it is not an essential feature. Nevertheless, necrotizing granulomas are a hallmark of this disease. However, many biopsies can be nonspecific and 50% provide too little information for the diagnosis of GPA.|$|E

25|$|The {{differential}} diagnosis of testicular cancer requires examining the histology of tissue obtained from an inguinal orchiectomy - that is, surgical excision {{of the entire}} testis along with attached structures (epididymis and spermatic cord). <b>A</b> <b>biopsy</b> should not be performed, as it raises the risk of spreading cancer cells into the scrotum.|$|E

50|$|In medicine, <b>a</b> nerve <b>biopsy</b> is <b>an</b> {{invasive}} procedure {{in which a}} piece of nerve is removed from an organism and examined under a microscope. <b>A</b> nerve <b>biopsy</b> {{can lead to the}} discovery of necrotizing vasculitis, amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, leprosy, metabolic neuropathies, inflammation of the nerve, loss of axon tissue, and demyelination.|$|R
40|$|The {{clinical}} significance of minimal acute rejection (grade A,) in lung transplant recipients is unknown. We prospectively analyzed 1, 159 transbronchial lung biopsies in 184 patients. Two hundred seventy-nine biopsies in 128 participants confirmed A, histology at a mean postoperative day of 229 +/- 340. Sixty four of 255 surveillance A, lesions progressed to high-grade acute rejection by 3 months of follow-up, whereas 40 developed new lymphocytic bronchiolitis. Twenty-four <b>A,</b> <b>biopsies</b> were symptomatic, {{with only two}} cases progressing to high-grade rejection after steroid therapy. Seventy-eight of 184 patients experienced multiple (greater {{than or equal to}} 2) <b>A,</b> <b>biopsies</b> in the first 12 months after transplant. Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome developed in 68 % of patients with multiple A(1) lesions at a mean of 599 +/- 435 days, compared with 43 % of patients with one or less A, lesions at a mean of 819 +/- 526 (p = 0. 022). Eighteen patients experienced multiple <b>A,</b> <b>biopsies</b> after transplant in the absence of high-grade rejection episodes yet also developed earlier obliterative bronchiolitis (456 +/- 245 days, p = 0. 020). We conclude that for A(1) transbronchial lung biopsies, the conventional treatment of observation only is now challenged even in patients who are asymptomatic. Patients who experience multiple A(1) lesions develop an earlier onset of obliterative bronchiolitis and may warrant alternative immunosuppressive strategies...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: When {{faced with}} {{biochemical}} recurrence after definitive radiotherapy for prostate cancer, clinicians must {{determine whether the}} recurrence is local or systemic. Post radiotherapy prostate biopsies to detect persistent local disease are difficult to interpret histopathologically and are subject to sampling error. Our study examines outcomes for patients with <b>a</b> negative prostate <b>biopsy</b> performed for rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels after prostate radiation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of 238 prostate cancer patients with <b>a</b> negative <b>biopsy</b> following definitive radiotherapy. Seventy-five of these patients had biochemical recurrence {{at the time of}} <b>biopsy.</b> <b>A</b> negative <b>biopsy</b> was defined as the absence of prostate cancer without radiation-treatment effect in the specimen. RESULTS: Patients underwent <b>biopsy</b> at <b>a</b> mean of 41 months after the completion of radiation. They had a mean PSA of 6. Patients were followed for an average of 63 months. Thirty-two patients (43 %) developed metastasis, and 11 (15 %) died of prostate cancer despite <b>a</b> negative post-radiation <b>biopsy.</b> Five of nine patients (56 %) with sequential <b>biopsies</b> had <b>a</b> positive second <b>biopsy.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Patients with PSA recurrence and <b>a</b> negative post-radiation <b>biopsy</b> have <b>a</b> high chance of persistent local disease, progression, and death from prostate cancer. Furthermore, <b>an</b> initial negative <b>biopsy</b> does not rule-out local recurrence. Patients with biochemical recurrence after radiotherapy for prostate cancer need to be evaluated earlier for local recurrence...|$|R
