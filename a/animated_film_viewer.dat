5000|$|Upon release, Charlotte's Web 2: Wilbur's Great Adventure {{received}} generally unfavorable {{reviews from}} critics. Robert Pardi of TV Guide reviewed the film saying that [...] "This 20-years-later follow-up fails {{to capture the}} zest of the original cartoon, transforming E.B. White's beloved characters into cute sidekicks worthy of Barney. The animation is only workmanlike, and the character conceptions are as pallid as the [...] "original" [...] tunes". Brian Webster of Apollo Guide gave the film 59/100, stating [...] "This {{is the sort of}} bland adventure that kids will have seen a hundred times before, with not-so-tense near-misses and not-so-exciting chases along the way." [...] Mike Long of DVD Talk opined that [...] "The lame story isn't helped by the mediocre at best animation. The art has no real style and could have come from any Saturday morning cartoon. The colors are good, but they only draw attention to the overall lack of detail here. For some reason, Wilbur has been given a ring of fur around his neck that keeps him from looking like the pig from the original film. Also, the Fern here looks nothing like the original. Typically, if an <b>animated</b> <b>film</b> is dull, <b>viewers</b> can hope for good animation to keep them entertained, but that's not the case here." ...|$|R
