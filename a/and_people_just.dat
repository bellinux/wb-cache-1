Wire commented {{in an interview that}} [...] "there was a sense of responsibility to do his words justice." [...] The album {{was released}} to positive critical reviews and reached No. 3 on the UK Album Chart. However the cover of the album generated some controversy, with the top four UK supermarkets stocking the CD in a plain slipcase, as the cover was deemed [...] "inappropriate". Bradfield regarded the decision as [...] "utterly bizarre", and has commented: [...] "You can have lovely shiny buttocks and guns everywhere in the supermarket on covers of magazines and CDs, but you show a piece of art <b>and</b> <b>people</b> <b>just</b> freak out." ...|$|E
2500|$|A British {{reconnaissance}} aircraft sighted Bismarck {{in the early}} morning hours of 26 May by following its oil slick. At dusk on 26 May, Fairey Swordfish torpedo aircraft from HMS Ark Royal attacked. Though much of the damage was superficial, one torpedo jammed Bismarcks rudders and steering gear. Lindemann was sure the damage could be repaired, but Lütjens apparently was quick to accept the worst. As Lindemann and his engineering officers discussed ways to repair the damage Lütjens compiled a note to the German command <b>and</b> <b>people</b> <b>just</b> 30 minutes after the torpedo struck and before the full extent of the damage was known. Divers were put over the side, but reported they could not clear the damage, as the sea was then too rough. The officers also considered using the aircraft hangar doors on board the ship as makeshift rudders but the proposals came to nothing. The crew was still able to steer Bismarck somewhat by adjusting the revolution speed of her propellers, but it reduced the ship's top speed to [...] and effectively left it circling in the water.|$|E

"The {{opening scene}} of the Revel was rather effective," [...] {{continued}} Cornelian; [...] "all the Shadow people reclined in the dimly-lit centre of the ballroom in an indistinguishable mass, and the human characters marched round the illuminated sides {{of the room to}} solemn processional music. Every now and then a shadow would detach itself from the mass, hail its partner by name, and glide out to join him or her in the procession. Then, when the last shadows had found their mates and every one was partnered, the lights were turned up in a blaze, the orchestra crashed out a whirl of nondescript dance music, <b>and</b> <b>people</b> <b>just</b> let themselves go. It was Pandemonium. Afterwards every one strutted about for half an hour or so, showing themselves off, and then the legitimate programme of dances began. There were some rather amusing incidents throughout the evening. One set of lancers was danced entirely by the Seven Deadly Sins and their human exemplars; of course seven couples were not sufficient to make up the set, so they had to bring in an eighth sin, I forget what it was." ...|$|E

60|$|On first {{coming to}} the cathedral I noticed a few pigeons sitting {{on the roof and}} ledges very high up, and, not seeing them well, I assumed that they were of the common or {{domestic}} kind. By and by one cooed, then another; and recognizing the stock-dove note I began to look carefully, and found that all the birds on the building--about thirty pairs--were of this species. It was a great surprise, for though we occasionally find a pair of stock-doves breeding on the ivied wall of some inhabited mansion in the country, it was a new thing to find a considerable colony of this shy woodland species established on a building in a town. They lived and bred there just as the common pigeon--the vari-coloured descendant of the blue rock--does on St. Paul's, the Law Courts, and the British Museum in London. Only, unlike our metropolitan doves, both the domestic kind and the ringdove in the parks, the Salisbury doves though in the town are not of it. They come not down to mix with the currents of human life in the streets and open spaces; they fly away to the country to feed, and dwell on the cathedral above the houses <b>and</b> <b>people</b> <b>just</b> as sea-birds--kittiwake and guillemot and gannet--dwell on the ledges of some vast ocean-fronting cliff.|$|E
