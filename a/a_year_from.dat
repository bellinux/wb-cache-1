Anne was voted a parliamentary allowance of £20,000 a year, while George received £10,000 <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>from</b> his Danish estates, although payments from Denmark were often late or incomplete. King Charles {{gave them a}} set of buildings in the Palace of Whitehall known as the Cockpit (near the site {{of what is now}} Downing Street in Westminster) as their London residence.|$|E

During this time he was involved in a dispute in which Equity threatened to expel Laurence Olivier as a member due to comments he made in a newspaper feature about the possibility of forming a breakaway union. The union also suffered from financial problems, and Morell continued to warn against destructive divisions amongst the members when he stepped down as president.|$|E

Statistics show that in the five years prior to Fàbregas's departure from Arsenal, Fàbregas created 466 goal-scoring chances, made 86 assists and scored 48 goals, all three statistics topping those of new teammates Xavi and Andrés Iniesta, despite both having made more appearances in the same period.|$|E
5|$|Robinett, as a {{means to}} {{maintain}} his name on his game, included a hidden message in Adventure identifying himself as the creator, inspired by the supposedly hidden messages left on various songs recorded by The Beatles. In discussing the game in 2015, Robinett considered the message {{as a means}} of self-promotion, noting that he had been paid only around $22,000 <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>from</b> Atari without any royalties, while Atari would sell a million units of a game at $25 a piece. This secret is one of the earliest known Easter eggs in a video game.|$|E

5|$|Tensions between Edward and the barons {{remained}} high, and the earls {{opposed to}} the King kept their personal armies mobilised late into 1311. By now Edward had become estranged from his cousin, the Earl of Lancaster, who held the earldoms of Lancaster, Leicester, Lincoln, Salisbury and Derby, with an income of around £11,000 <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>from</b> his lands, almost double that of the next wealthiest baron. Backed by the earls of Arundel, Gloucester, Hereford, Pembroke and Warwick, Lancaster led a powerful faction in England, {{but he was not}} personally interested in practical administration, nor was he a particularly imaginative or effective politician.|$|E

It {{is known as}} one of Chicago's better outdoor people-watching locations during the winter months.

5|$|About 1 in 1000 adults {{per year}} has DVT, {{but as of}} 2011, {{available}} data are dominated by North American and European populations. VTE is rare in children, with an incidence of about 1 in 100,000 <b>a</b> <b>year.</b> <b>From</b> childhood to old age, incidence increases {{by a factor of}} about 1000, with almost 1% of the elderly experiencing VTE yearly. During pregnancy and after childbirth, acute VTE occurs about once per 1000 deliveries. After surgery with preventative treatment, VTE develops in about 10 of 1000 people after total or partial knee replacement, and in about 5 of 1000 after total or partial hip replacement. About 300,000–600,000 Americans develop VTE each year, with about 60,000–100,000 deaths attributable to PE. In England, an estimated 25,000 a year die from hospital-related VTE. For unclear reasons, people of Asian descent have a lower VTE risk than whites.|$|E

5|$|Although {{her mother}} was a {{grandchild}} of King George III, May was only a minor member of the British Royal Family. Her father, the Duke of Teck, had no inheritance or wealth and carried the lower royal style of Serene Highness because his parents' marriage was morganatic. However, the Duchess of Teck was granted a parliamentary annuity of £5,000 and received about £4,000 <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>from</b> her mother, the Duchess of Cambridge. Despite this, the family was deeply in debt and lived abroad from 1883, in order to economise. The Tecks travelled throughout Europe, visiting their various relations. They stayed in Florence, Italy, for a time, where May enjoyed visiting the art galleries, churches, and museums.|$|E
5|$|Belcourt {{returned}} to Quebec, but was quickly {{sent out to}} serve at a parish at Rustico, Prince Edward Island. Arriving there in November 1859, the priest performed his first baptism among the local people the following month. Belcourt built a parish hall out of stone (which was used into the 1950s) and established the Farmers' Bank of Rustico. He founded a high school, where he taught until recruiting a teacher from Montreal to the island. The priest created a study group, the members of which had to agree to be teetotalers. He established a parish library, built {{with the assistance of}} 1,000 French francs <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>from</b> Emperor Napoleon III, nephew of Napoleon I. In October 1865, Belcourt resigned from his position at the parish at Rustico, and {{returned to}} Quebec for some weeks.|$|E
5|$|Born in Cologne, {{the son of}} {{a synagogue}} cantor, Offenbach showed early musical talent. At the age of 14, he was {{accepted}} as a student at the Paris Conservatoire but found academic study unfulfilling and left after <b>a</b> <b>year.</b> <b>From</b> 1835 to 1855 he earned his living as a cellist, achieving international fame, and as a conductor. His ambition, however, was to compose comic pieces for the musical theatre. Finding the management of Paris' Opéra-Comique company uninterested in staging his works, in 1855 he leased a small theatre in the Champs-Élysées. There he presented a series of his own small-scale pieces, many of which became popular.|$|E

5|$|Enamel is {{the hardest}} and most highly mineralized {{substance}} of the body. It {{is one of the}} four major tissues which make up the tooth, along with dentin, cementum, and dental pulp. It is normally visible and must be supported by underlying dentin. 96% of enamel consists of mineral, with water and organic material comprising the rest. The normal color of enamel varies from light yellow to grayish white. At the edges of teeth where there is no dentin underlying the enamel, the color sometimes has a slightly blue tone. Since enamel is semitranslucent, the color of dentin and any restorative dental material underneath the enamel strongly affects the appearance of a tooth. Enamel varies in thickness over the surface of the tooth and is often thickest at the cusp, up to 2.5mm, and thinnest at its border, which is seen clinically as the CEJ. The wear rate of enamel, called attrition, is 8 micrometers <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>from</b> normal factors.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his lecture}} series, Blackstone became more {{prominent}} in convocation and other university activities. Oxford and Cambridge {{at the time}} had a strange system of law; due to their unique natures, they had exclusive jurisdiction over both academics and students in a fashion which followed either the common law or their own customs, based on the civil law. With his appointment as assessor (or chief legal officer) of the Chancellor's Court, Blackstone became far {{more involved in the}} university's peculiar legal system, and records show him sitting between eight and ten times <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>from</b> 1753 to 1759, mainly dealing with small claims of debt. He also wrote a manual on the Court's practice, and through his position gained a large number of contacts and connections, as well as visibility, which aided his legal career significantly. This period also saw Blackstone write his last known piece of poetry, Friendship: An Ode, in 1756.|$|E
5|$|In 1702, King William III died, and Anne became Queen. Anne {{immediately}} offered John Churchill a dukedom, which Sarah initially refused. Sarah {{was concerned}} that a dukedom would strain the family's finances; a ducal family {{at the time was}} expected to show off its rank through lavish entertainments. Anne countered by offering the Marlboroughs a pension of £5000 a year, for life, from Parliament, as well as an extra £2000 <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>from</b> the Privy Purse, and they accepted the Dukedom. Sarah was promptly created Mistress of the Robes (the highest office in the royal court that could be held by a woman), Groom of the Stole, Keeper of the Privy Purse, and Ranger of Windsor Great Park. The Duke accepted the Order of the Garter, as well as the office of Captain-General of the army.|$|E

5|$|Small Heath Alliance Football Club, {{founded in}} 1875, played their first home games on waste ground off Arthur Street, in the Bordesley Green {{district}} of Birmingham, {{very near the}} site where the club's St Andrew's stadium would be built some thirty years later. In 1876, they made a temporary move to a fenced-off field in Ladypool Road, Sparkbrook, with a capacity estimated at 3,000; because the field was enclosed, admission could be charged. A year later they moved again, to a field in Small Heath, rented for an initial £5 <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>from</b> the family of Sam Gessey, a Small Heath player. The field had a capacity of 10,000 spectators, and was situated on the eastern edge of Birmingham's built-up area, just north of the main road to Coventry. It was bordered on two sides by developed streets, Muntz Street on the western side, Wright Street to the south; the other two sides of the enclosure adjoined farmland.|$|E
5|$|Soviet rail {{transport}} became, after the Great Patriotic War, {{one of the}} most developed in the world, surpassing most of its First World counterparts. The Soviet railway system was growing in size, at a rate of 639km <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>from</b> 1965 to 1980, while the growth of {{rail transport}} in First World countries was either decreasing or stagnating. This steady growth in rail transport {{can be explained by the}} country's need to extract its natural resources, most of which were located close to, or in Siberia. While some problems with the railways had been reported by the Soviet press, the Soviet Union could boast of controlling {{one of the most}} electrified railway systems at the time. During much of the country's later lifespan, trains usually carried coal, oil, construction material (mostly stone, cement and sand) and timber. Oil and oil products were one of the key reasons for building railway infrastructure in Siberia in the first place.|$|E
5|$|The main radio {{stations}} {{for the county}} are BBC Radio Lincolnshire, broadcasting on 94.9 FM and 104.7 FM frequencies, and the commercial station Lincs FM, on 102.2, 96.7 and 97.6 FM. The town's local newspapers are the Sleaford Standard (founded in 1924), the Sleaford Advertiser (founded in 1980) and the Sleaford Target (founded in 1984). Historically, the Sleaford Gazette operated between 1854 and 1960; the Sleaford Journal ran from at least 1884 until it was incorporated into the Gazette in December 1929, while the Sleaford Telegraph ran from 1888 to 1889 and the Sleaford Guardian was in print for <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>from</b> 1945 to 1946.|$|E
