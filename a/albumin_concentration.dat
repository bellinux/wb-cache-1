This study assessed the correlations between cerebrospinal fluid protein <b>concentrations,</b> serum <b>albumin</b> <b>concentrations</b> and intracranial pressure in a cohort of neurosurgical patients. After obtaining ethics committee approval, correlations between concomitant cerebrospinal fluid protein <b>concentrations,</b> serum <b>albumin</b> <b>concentrations</b> and the mean daily intracranial pressure of 63 consecutive neurosurgical patients, grouped as neurotrauma or intracranial haemorrhage, admitted between 1 January 2007 and 31 December, were assessed. The mean daily intracranial pressure {{was significantly associated with}} cerebrospinal fluid protein concentrations (Spearman correlation coefficient [SCC]= 0. 496, P= 0. 001), white cell counts (SCC= 0. 359, P= 0. 001), red cell counts (SCC= 0. 399, P= 0. 001) and serum <b>albumin</b> <b>concentrations</b> (SCC= 0. 431,P= 0. 001) in patients with neurotrauma (n= 23). Cerebrospinal fluid protein concentrations were also significantly associated with concomitant serum <b>albumin</b> <b>concentrations</b> (SCC= 0. 393, P= 0. 001) in these patients. In patients with intracranial haemorrhage (n= 40), the mean daily intracranial pressure was only significantly associated with cerebrospinal fluid white cell and red cell counts but not cerebrospinal fluid protein and serum <b>albumin</b> <b>concentrations.</b> In summary, intracranial pressure is correlated with cerebrospinal fluid protein and serum <b>albumin</b> <b>concentrations</b> in patients with severe neurotrauma, and these suggest that blood-brain barrier may not be completely intact after severe neurotrauma...|$|R

To {{study the}} {{influence}} of P-glycoprotein (P-glycoprotein, ABCB 1, MDR 1) function on placental transfer of lopinavir with ritonavir at different <b>albumin</b> <b>concentrations.</b> Methods. Cotyledons were perfused with lopinavir, ritonavir, and the internal control antipyrin, at various <b>albumin</b> <b>concentrations</b> (10, 30, 40 [*]g/L). After the control phase of each experiment, the P-glycoprotein inhibitor ciclosporin A was added at middle perfusion (45 minutes). Fetal Transfer Rate (FTR) and Clearance Index (CLI) were compared between the 2 phases. Results. In the control phase, the clearance index of lopinavir decreased from 0. 401 ± 0. 058 to 0. 007 ± 0. 027, as <b>albumin</b> <b>concentrations</b> increased from 10 [*]g/L to higher concentrations (30, 40 [*]g/L). When adding ciclosporin A at physiological <b>albumin</b> <b>concentrations,</b> the clearance index of lopinavir increased significantly 10. 3 fold (95 % of CI difference [− 0. 156, − 0. 002], P =. 046) and became positive for ritonavir. Conclusions. Even at high <b>albumin</b> <b>concentrations,</b> inhibition of placental P-glycoprotein increased placental transfer of lopinavir, suggesting that this efflux pump actively reduces placental transfer of the drug.

50|$|After a liver transplantation, {{there are}} three types of graft {{rejection}} that may occur. They include hyperacute rejection, acute rejection and chronic rejection. Hyperacute rejection is caused by preformed anti-donor antibodies. It {{is characterized by the}} binding of these antibodies to antigens on vascular endothelial cells. Complement activation is involved and the effect is usually profound. Hyperacute rejection happens within minutes to hours after the transplant procedure. Unlike hyperacute rejection, which is B cell mediated, acute rejection is mediated by T cells. It involves direct cytotoxicity and cytokine mediated pathways. Acute rejection is the most common and the primary target of immunosuppressive agents. Acute rejection is usually seen within days or weeks of the transplant. Chronic rejection is the presence of any sign and symptom of rejection after 1 year. The cause of chronic rejection is still unknown but an acute rejection is a strong predictor of chronic rejections.Liver rejection may happen anytime after the transplant.

Alterations in albumin in metabolic stress such as cardiac surgery have been previously investigated. We studied serum <b>albumin</b> <b>concentration</b> in children with congenital heart disease and also the association of hypoalbuminemia with mortality and morbidity after pediatric cardiac surgery. Methods: We measured serum <b>albumin</b> <b>concentration</b> prospectively in 300 children with congenital heart disease who underwent surgery between July and September 2008 in Shaheed Rajaee hospital. Serum <b>albumin</b> <b>concentration</b> was measured before and 48 hours after cardiac surgery and was subsequently compared between 2 groups: cyanotic and acyanotic and also with normal values. Results: Serum <b>albumin</b> <b>concentration</b> decreased on the second post-operative day in 70 (23. 3 %) patients. There was a positive correlation between the post-surgical hypoalbuminemia and cyanotic heart disease.
