Two type of insurances are available: (1) claim-based insurances, and (2) index-based insurances.

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{prominent}} theories of early and primary state formation is the hydraulic hypothesis, which contends that the state was a result of the need to build and maintain large-scale irrigation projects. The theory was most significantly detailed Karl August Wittfogel's argument that, in arid environments, farmers would be confronted by the production limits of small-scale irrigation. Eventually different <b>agricultural</b> <b>producers</b> would join together in response to population pressure and the arid environment, to create a state apparatus that could build and maintain large irrigation projects.|$|E

25|$|By {{the start}} of the 19th century, the aim of Hungary's <b>agricultural</b> <b>producers</b> had shifted from {{subsistence}} farming and small-scale production for local trade to cash-generating, large-scale production for a wider market. Road and waterway improvements cut transportation costs, while urbanization in Austria, Bohemia, and Moravia and the need for supplies for the Napoleonic wars boosted demand for foodstuffs and clothing. Hungary became a major grain and wool exporter. New lands were cleared, and yields rose as farming methods improved. Hungary did not reap the full benefit of the boom, however, because most of the profits went to the magnates, who considered them not as capital for investment but as a means of adding luxury to their lives. As expectations rose, goods such as linen and silverware, once considered luxuries, became necessities. The wealthy magnates had little trouble balancing their earnings and expenditures, but many lesser nobles, fearful of losing their social standing, went into debt to finance their spending.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1950s, the {{government}} began to replace a number of markets, which were stalls made of wood and lamínate, with modern buildings. During the presidency of Adolfo López Mateos (1958-1964) eighty eight markets were constructed in Mexico City. Mercados sobre ruedas (markets on wheels) was a concept implemented in 1969, to give <b>agricultural</b> <b>producers</b> a means to sell directly to consumers. The idea was that an association of producers could seek permission to sell their produce in a particular spot on a particular day of the week. However, many of these associations became dominated by intermediaries {{rather than by the}} farmers themselves, as the producers could not spend many days selling their merchandise. Today, [...] "mercados sobre ruedas" [...] is used to refer to informal street vendors who sell in large groups but generally can be found every day in the same location, rather than on market days, such as tianguis. According to INEGI, about 23 percent of the population earns money in the informal economy, with includes the mercados sobre ruedas and tianguis.|$|E
2500|$|As {{early as}} 1901 the {{possible}} benefits of tobacco pooling – in which entire crops were to remain unsold {{in an attempt}} to pressure the market into higher tobacco prices – were frequent topics of discussion. In the early 1900s, wholesale prices of the Hopkinsville leaf, a dark type, sold as low as four to six cents a pound. The American Society of Equity, in the meantime, had commenced to penetrate the tobacco areas of Kentucky and Tennessee and once again some of the most influential planters in the region talked of the possibilities of cooperative action. Operating on the theory that <b>agricultural</b> <b>producers</b> were not receiving an equitable price for their products, the American Society of Equity conceived the idea of organizing the farmers to place a price on all products of the [...] "farm and orchard." [...] The leaders of this organization predicted that the farmers, if properly organized, could wield a power comparable to that of the organized labor unions in the cities. Riding on the popularity of the American Society of Equity, the Planters’ Protective Association, at its peak in 1905, was estimated to have some 30,000 members in western Kentucky and Tennessee.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{focus on}} the time {{adjustment}} paths of the exchange rate and <b>agricultural</b> <b>producer</b> and industrial prices in response to unanticipated monetary shocks following model developed by Saghaian et al. (2002). Results indicate that agricultural prices adjust faster than industrial prices to innovations in the money supply, affecting relative prices in the short run, but strict long-run money neutrality does not hold. The impulse response analysis shows that an exogenous shock to the money supply has a significant and volatile effect on the three price variables. The extent of overshooting in agricultural prices is {{twice as large as}} for exchange rates or industrial prices. This indicates {{that in the case of}} monetary shocks the sectors associated with flexible changes bear the burden of adjustment vis-a-vis the sectors with sticky changes. The exchange rate pass-through on <b>agricultural</b> <b>producer</b> prices revealed by the forecast error variance analysis indicates the relatively greater importance of the exchange rate than the money supply in explaining the expected variation of the <b>agricultural</b> <b>producer</b> price. This is consistent with floating exchange rate policy, while agricultural trade policy for sensitive products has been more restricted until Slovenia joined the European Union. agricultural prices, exchange rates, monetary shocks, overshooting, transition economy, Agricultural Finance, International Relations/Trade,...|$|R
