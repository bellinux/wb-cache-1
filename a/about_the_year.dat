He belonged to the Banu Hashim clan, part of the Quraysh tribe, and was one of Mecca's prominent families, although it appears less prosperous during Muhammad's early lifetime. Tradition places the year of Muhammad's birth as corresponding with the Year of the Elephant, which is named after the failed destruction of Mecca that year by the Abraha, Yemen's king, who supplemented his army with elephants.|$|E

5|$|Born on July 18, 1913, in Vincennes, Indiana, Richard Skelton was {{the fourth}} and {{youngest}} son of Ida Mae (née Fields) and Joseph Elmer Skelton. Joseph, a grocer, died two months before Richard was born; {{he had once been}} a clown with the Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus. During Skelton's lifetime there was some dispute <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> of his birth. Author Wesley Hyatt suggests that since he began working at such an early age, Skelton may have claimed he was older than he actually was in order to gain employment. Vincennes neighbors described the Skelton family as being extremely poor; a childhood friend remembered that her parents broke up a youthful romance between her sister and Skelton because they thought he had no future.|$|E
5|$|Melbourne {{is a town}} in South Derbyshire {{close to}} the River Trent, which may have {{originated}} as buildings associated with the royal manor {{to the south of}} the nearby settlement at Kings Newton. Melbourne Castle was constructed on the site of an earlier manor house of unknown date; there is an old tradition that the manor was originally established in <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> 900, during the reign of Alfred the Great, but there is no evidence for this. As recorded in the Domesday Book, the manor of Melbourne and its lands were the property of King Edward the Confessor prior to the Norman Conquest. The property then passed into the hands of William I of England. After creating the Diocese of Carlisle in 1133, Henry I gave the manor for life to Æthelwold, the first bishop. Some time later, the diocese built a palace nearby on the site of what is now Melbourne Hall. When Bishop Æthelwold died in about 1156, the manor reverted to the crown.|$|E
5|$|The Normans {{arrived in}} Ceredigion in 1073–1074, {{and from the}} early twelfth century Norman {{political}} and ecclesiastical influence gradually increased, aided by the appointment, after 1115, of Norman bishops of St David's. In <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> 1106, Ithel and Madoc, who were in alliance with King Henry I, ravaged all the county of Cardigan, as Ceredigion was called by the Normans, {{with the exception of}} Llanbadarn Fawr and Llanddewi Brefi. Nevertheless, Llanbadarn Fawr suffered an attack upon its sanctuary, from which several of Owain ab Madoc’s men, who had taken refuge there, were dragged out by force and put to death. But by this time, scarcely a generation after Rhygyfarch was writing his Life of St David, the clas had declined in its spiritual and pastoral life, and its political importance, although its financial position remained strong, due to the substantial revenues of its extensive lands.|$|E

5|$|The word afternoon, which {{derives from}} after and noon, has been attested from <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> 1300; Middle English {{contained}} both afternoon and the synonym aftermete. The standard locative marking {{for the word}} was at afternoon in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries but has shifted to in the afternoon since then. In Southern U.S. and Midland American English, the word evening is sometimes used to encompass all times between noon and night. The Irish language contains four different words to mark time intervals from late afternoon to nightfall, this period being considered mystical. Metaphorically, the word afternoon refers to a relatively late period in the expanse of time or in one's life.|$|E

In 2003, Veitch discovered that a friend of hers who was working as a stripper had died as a result of alcoholism. Veitch began to evangelize to strippers because she wished she had told her friend about the gospel before she died.|$|E
5|$|For galaxies {{more distant}} than the Local Group {{and the nearby}} Virgo Cluster, but within a {{thousand}} megaparsecs or so, the redshift is approximately proportional to the galaxy's distance. This correlation was first observed by Edwin Hubble and {{has come to be}} known as Hubble's law. Vesto Slipher was the first to discover galactic redshifts, in <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> 1912, while Hubble correlated Slipher's measurements with distances he measured by other means to formulate his Law. In the widely accepted cosmological model based on general relativity, redshift is mainly a result of the expansion of space: this means that the farther away a galaxy is from us, the more the space has expanded in the time since the light left that galaxy, so the more the light has been stretched, the more redshifted the light is, and so the faster it appears to be moving away from us. Hubble's law follows in part from the Copernican principle. Because it is usually not known how luminous objects are, measuring the redshift is easier than more direct distance measurements, so redshift is sometimes in practice converted to a crude distance measurement using Hubble's law.|$|E

5|$|The house {{seems to}} have been rebuilt since the time that Sir Samuel Morland dwelt in it. <b>About</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> 1730, Mr. Jonathan Tyers became the {{occupier}} of it, and, there being a large garden belonging to it, planted with a great number of stately trees, and laid out in shady walks, it obtained the name of Spring Gardens; and the house being converted into a tavern, or place of entertainment, was much frequented by the votaries of pleasure. Mr. Tyers opened it with an advertisement of a Ridotto al Fresco, a term which {{the people of this country}} had till that time been strangers to. These entertainments were repeated in the course of the summer, and numbers resorted to partake of them. This encouraged the proprietor to make his garden a place of musical entertainment, for every evening during the summer season. To this end he was at great expense in decorating the gardens with paintings; he engaged a band of excellent musicians; he issued silver tickets at one guinea each for admission, and receiving great encouragement, he set up an organ in the orchestra, and, in a conspicuous part of the garden, erected a fine statue of Mr. Handel.|$|E
5|$|The see, if such {{it may be}} called, {{appears to}} have existed for a century, if indeed it didn't come into {{existence}} {{in the years after}} Padarn himself. There is note of a bishop of Llanbadarn in the minutes of a synod held at Abberley, Worcestershire, in <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> 603, though this is an unreliable source. Reportedly, at this meeting, there was an unsuccessful attempt by the Archbishop of Canterbury, St Augustine of Canterbury, to persuade Celtic bishops – Llanbadarn Fawr was one of seven present – to submit to his authority. Certainly the reputation of Padarn and the wealth and influence of his clas, ensured that the developing cultus of David did not prevail in northern Ceredigion, possibly in large part due to the extensive lands possessed by the clas, apparently from the river Clarach to the river Rheidol. In some cases, as in the Life of Saint Padarn, the Lives tell how the saint gains lands which as the time of writing were claimed by the saint’s foundation as its endowment.|$|E
