5|$|After {{teaching}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>master</b> of arts in Paris {{for over}} forty years, Robert was recalled to England by King Henry II in 1160, and was appointed Bishop of Hereford in 1163. He was consecrated at Canterbury on 22December by Archbishop Thomas Becket. Becket had been prominent among those recommending Robert for the vacancy at Hereford; one of Becket's later biographers said that Becket urged the king to find benefices for Englishmen living abroad. There {{is some evidence}} that Pope Alexander III had a hand in Robert's election, as Becket in 1166 reminded Robert and Roger of Worcester that they both owed their episcopates to Alexander.|$|E

5|$|Samuel Adams {{later became}} a {{controversial}} figure in American history. Accounts written in the 19th century praised him as someone who had been steering his fellow colonists towards independence long before {{the outbreak of the}} Revolutionary War. This view gave way to negative assessments of Adams {{in the first half of}} the 20th century, in which he was portrayed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>master</b> of propaganda who provoked mob violence to achieve his goals. Both of these interpretations have been challenged by some modern scholars, who argue that these traditional depictions of Adams are myths contradicted by the historical record.|$|E

While then-Sergeant Thomas Quiwonkpa led the plotters, it was the group led by Samuel Doe that found Tolbert in his office, and it was Doe, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>master</b> sergeant the highest ranking of the group, who went on the radio the next day to announce the overthrow of the long-entrenched True Whig Party government.|$|E

5|$|There is {{insufficient}} historical {{evidence to support}} the claim he knew any skills beyond archery. Contemporary records never once mention Zhou teaching Yue boxing. Despite this, various wuxia novels and folk legends have attributed many different military and supernatural skills to Zhou. These range from mastery of the bow, double swords and Chinese spear to that of Wudang hard qigong, Chuojiao boxing and even X-ray vision. Wang Shaotang's folktale even represents him <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>master</b> of Drunken Eight Immortals boxing.|$|E
5|$|Verdi was {{committed}} to the publisher Giovanni Ricordi for an opera—which became Stiffelio—for Trieste in the Spring of 1850; and, subsequently, following negotiations with La Fenice, developed a libretto with Piave and wrote the music for Rigoletto (based on Victor Hugo's Le roi s'amuse) for Venice in March 1851. This {{was the first of}} a sequence of three operas (followed by Il trovatore and La traviata) which were to cement his fame <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>master</b> of opera.|$|E
5|$|After a {{brief period}} of unemployment, he was hired <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>master</b> at the Collegiate School in Leicester to teach drawing, mapmaking, and surveying. Wallace spent many hours at the library in Leicester: he read An Essay on the Principle of Population by Thomas Malthus, and one evening he met the {{entomologist}} Henry Bates. Bates was 19 years old, and in 1843 he had published a paper on beetles in the journal Zoologist. He befriended Wallace and started him collecting insects. William died in March 1845, and Wallace left his teaching position to assume control of his brother's firm in Neath, but his brother John and he were unable to make the business work. After a few months, Wallace found work as a civil engineer for a nearby firm that was working on a survey for a proposed railway in the Vale of Neath.|$|E

5|$|Benbow {{continued}} {{aboard the}} Sovereign throughout 1691, {{and by the}} summer of 1692, was again master of the fleet, this time under Admiral Edward Russell, then aboard the Britannia. Benbow worked closely with his old colleague David Mitchell, then serving as Russell's first captain, and Josiah Burchett, Russell's clerk. Benbow may have advised Russell to take the Gull Passage inside the Goodwin Sands to the Downs, where they linked up with the Dutch forces. Benbow served as master of the fleet during the Battles of Barfleur and La Hogue. After the battles, Benbow returned to Deptford to resume his duties as master attendant, spending a brief period at Portsmouth Dockyard helping to oversee repairs to the fleet. He had already had his pay upgraded to that of a master attendant, he was now to be paid <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>master,</b> in addition to his master attendant's wage, presumably as an acknowledgement of his special services.|$|E
5|$|Gallaher played eight matchesthe {{first four}} as hooker and the {{remainder}} as wing-forwardout of eleven during the six-week tour. The party was captained by the veteran Otago player Jimmy Duncan, who was widely recognised <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>master</b> tactician. The first match in Australia, against New South Wales, was won 12–0 by the New Zealanders, despite their having a man sent off. After playing a Combined Western Districts side, New Zealand played a second match against New South Wales. New Zealand won again, but only 3–0 on a flooded pitch at Sydney Cricket Ground. The side continued touring the state before making their way north to Queensland, where they twice played the state side. The New Zealanders then returned to New South Wales, where the first-ever Australia–New Zealand rugby union Test match took place in Sydney.|$|E
