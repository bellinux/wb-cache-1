5|$|On 11 July, Bolt led another {{flight of}} four fighters in a {{reconnaissance}} mission above Sinuiju, his 37th combat {{mission of the}} deployment. Two of the aircraft departed after their fuel tanks were depleted, leaving him with one wingman to continue the patrol. Soon after, the two pilots spotted a formation of four MiGs taking off from <b>Antung</b> airfield on the Chinese side of the Yalu River. Despite being low on fuel, Bolt ordered an attack. He made a head-on dive toward the formation, which was attempting to gain altitude, and downed the leading airplane with four machine gun bursts. He then banked his aircraft and aimed for the second aircraft in the formation, continuing the attack and scoring hits on its fuselage. The pilot bailed out, and the remaining two MiGs fled. Within the first five minutes of the engagement, Bolt shot down two of the MiGs. This brought his tally of confirmed victories during the war to six. For these actions he became the final Marine aviator to be awarded the Navy Cross during the war. Bolt is the only non-USAF pilot to become an ace in the F-86 and the only naval aviator to become an ace in two wars. Shortly after this final mission, his tour of duty ended and he was rotated back to the United States for an extended rest and vacation, which he spent with his family.|$|E
25|$|The {{defending}} Soviet Air Forces (VVS) {{were represented}} on June 23, 1952, by the 64th Fighter Aviation Corps employing {{two of its}} three Soviet Air Defence Forces fighter aviation divisions (USAF wing-equivalent) on forward air bases of the <b>Antung</b> airfield complex in Northeast China, totaling six regiments with 246 MiG-15/MiG-15bis, of which 210 were rated combat-ready. In addition, six full-strength fighter aviation divisions of the Unified Air Army (UAA), a joint command of the People's Liberation Army Air Force and Korean People's Army Air Force, were also combat operational in Northeast China with 275 MiG-15s.|$|E
25|$|The {{regiment}} {{was led by}} World War II flying ace and Hero of the Soviet Union Ivan Semenyuk from January 1952. At {{the same}} time, the regiment left for China with the 190th IAD. It deployed to Miaogou near <b>Antung</b> in northeast China in February 1952 as part of Soviet participation in the Korean War, {{becoming part of the}} 64th Fighter Aviation Corps. At this point the pilots of the regiment were inexperienced on the MiG-15, and did not have more than 50 to 60 hours of flight in the MiGs.|$|E
25|$|On 25 June, {{a flight}} of 256th IAP MiGs engaged four Sabres over Anshan without result. The {{regiment}} {{was transferred to the}} new Dapu airfield on 30 June as a result of heavy attacks on Anshan. On 4 July, while repulsing airstrikes against the power grid of the Sui-ho Dam, the regiment claimed an F-86, on a day that the 190th suffered heavy losses on. In July, flying ace Vladimir Zabelin became the acting regimental commander after Semenyuk fell ill and was evacuated. On 20 July Zabelin claimed an F-86 over Dapu airfield. On 6 August, the regiment had several dogfights with F-86s while sweeping the air over <b>Antung</b> airfield. The 256th IAP lost a MiG whose pilot bailed out on the next day, and on 9 August, the regiment suffered its final loss when Senior Lieutenant Khalitov was shot down, although he safely ejected. Six pilots of the regiment were killed during the deployment. According to Thomas Polak in his 1999 book on Soviet aces, the regiment shot down 16 Sabres while losing sixteen MiGs during the deployment. Mikhail Bykov provides a different figure in his 2014 book, with the 256th IAP claiming 18 F-86s while losing 20 MiGs.|$|E
500|$|On March13, Hagerstrom and his wingman Elmer N. Dunlap {{came across}} two MiGs, {{the first of}} which Hagerstrom [...] "shot the daylights out of". He shot at the second until he ran out of ammunition, and the {{remaining}} MiG was leaking fuel and its engine had stopped. Hagerstrom told Dunlap to [...] "finish off" [...] the crippled plane, and the MiG's pilot bailed over the enemy's <b>Antung</b> Airfield. That mission gave him a total of 4.5 victories, just short of the five kills needed for ace status. Knowing that he was likely to be transferred out soon, he became even more determined to get another kill. On March27 he sneaked up behind six MiGs and fired on one, but by [...] "sheer ass luck ... it knocked his wing tip off." [...] He kept up the chase, shooting short bursts, until the pilot, Chinese ace Wang Hai, ejected right above his own base. On the way home, Hagerstrom destroyed another MiG, bringing the total to 6.5. He became the war's 28th ace and would be the only from the 18th wing. Before the Air Force sent him back to the U.S., he got one more MiG on April13. On his last day in Korea, while waiting for his flight out, he volunteered to do an impromptu mission, netting his last kill. This gave him a sum of 8.5 throughout the whole war over 101 missions.|$|E
2500|$|Incursions into Manchuria by pilots of the 51st FIG to {{surprise}} MiGs {{over their own}} airfields had resulted in heavy losses for the 64th IAK during the previous months, with {{at least half of}} the MiGs destroyed in April and May 1952 shot down during take-offs or landings. The Soviets developed a counter-tactic to cover takeoffs from <b>Antung</b> with combat air patrols launched from Mukden and Anshan, but on June 23, despite good weather over <b>Antung,</b> inclement conditions [...] at Mukden prevented covering MiGs from taking off. In turn, this kept Soviet fighters based at <b>Antung</b> from countering the strike, to avoid pointless losses during takeoffs.|$|E
2500|$|On September 15, Risner's flight escorted F-84 Thunderjet fighter-bombers {{attacking a}} {{chemical}} {{plant on the}} Yalu River near the East China Sea. During their defense of the bombers, Risner's flight overflew the MiG base at <b>Antung</b> Airfield, China. Fighting one MiG at nearly supersonic speeds at ground level, Risner pursued it down a dry riverbed and across low hills to an airfield 35 miles inside China. [...] Scoring numerous hits on the MiG, shooting off its canopy, and setting it on fire, Risner chased it between hangars of the Communist airbase, where he shot it down into parked fighters.|$|E
2500|$|The United Nations drive northward {{approached}} the Yalu River and the Korean/Chinese border as October ended. Communist Chinese [...] "volunteers" [...] under General Lin Biao launched massive ground assaults on the UN forces, driving {{them back to}} the south. The Chinese Air Force periodically raided into Korea, before retreating into the sanctuary of airfields in Manchuria. Chinese MiG-15s appeared; their air combat superiority to any UN aircraft rapidly became apparent. Their [...] "Allied Joint Headquarters" [...] at <b>Antung</b> was supposed to direct Chinese and North Korean air efforts; however, it was run by Russian advisers. In turn, the U.S. introduced F-86 Sabre jets into Korea as a counter to the Mig-15s. Successful Sabre pilots reported seeing Caucasian pilots eject from failing MiGs.|$|E
2500|$|The {{spring of}} 1952 saw {{a surge in}} the {{destruction}} of MiGs by both F-86 wings in Korea, but particularly in the 4th FIW. Flying with the 335th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, Col. Thyng recorded four additional MiG kills to become a jet ace on May 20, 1952, and was awarded his third Silver Star. Kenneth P. Werrell, in his study Sabres over MiG Alley, states that Thyng's kills in March and April likely took place over China. He cites RAF Air Marshal Sir John M. Nicholls KCB CBE DFC AFC, then a flight lieutenant exchange pilot with the 4th FIW, as stating Thyng sent him low over the primary MiG base at <b>Antung</b> [...] "to stir them up" [...] and then shot down a reacting MiG-15 after it had taken off. He next quotes USAF Lt. Gen. Charles G. Cleveland, then a 1st lieutenant in the 335th FIS, as being in a flight led by Thyng that resulted in a shoot down north of Mukden, although the claim submission placed the location {{at the mouth of the}} Yalu River.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the return}} flight, Risner's wingman, 1st Lt. Joseph Logan, was struck in his fuel tanks by {{anti-aircraft}} fire over <b>Antung.</b> In {{an effort to}} help him reach Kimpo, Risner attempted to push Logan's aircraft by having him shut down his engine and inserting the nose of his own jet into the tailpipe of Logan's, an unprecedented and untried maneuver. The object of the maneuver was to push Logan's aircraft to the island of Cho Do off the North Korean coast, where the Air Force maintained a helicopter rescue detachment. Jet fuel and hydraulic fluid spewed out from the damaged Sabre onto Risner's canopy, obscuring his vision, and turbulence kept separating the two jets. Risner was able to re-establish contact and guide the powerless plane out over the sea until fluids threatened to stall his own engine. Near Cho Do, Logan bailed out after calling to Risner, [...] "I'll see you at the base tonight." [...] Although Logan came down close to shore and was a strong swimmer, he became entangled in his parachute shrouds and drowned. Risner shut down his own engine in an attempt to save fuel, but eventually his engine flamed out and he glided to a deadstick landing at Kimpo.|$|E
2500|$|Two Air Commando H-19 pilots {{received}} the Silver Star and Distinguished Flying Crosses from an attempted rescue mission described in their citations as [...] "the deepest helicopter {{penetration of the}} Korean War". [...] Taking off from Cho-do Island {{in the early morning}} hours, Captain Frank J. Westerman and Lieutenant Robert Sullivan flew low-level through darkness for two hours, guided north by an Air Rescue SA-16 pathfinder aircraft flying overhead at an altitude of 100 feet. [...] At first light, the helicopter was 16 miles south of the Chinese border and within ten minutes flying time of the Chinese MiG fighter base at <b>Antung,</b> the largest Chinese fighter base in North Korea. [...] Racing inland they discovered the valley the downed pilot was reported to be in, {{which turned out to be}} a massive camouflage supply and troop depot. The valley contained at least a regiment of troops, all armed and firing as fast as they could. [...] The hills looked like a large warehouse, piles of equipment and supplies under camouflage nets. [...] It was quickly evident that no evading American was walking around in the area. [...] The Air Commandos fled for their lives, informing the SA-16 offshore to do the same. [...] It was likely that the rescue attempt was bait for a Chinese trap. All of the Air Commandos returned to Cho-do successfully.|$|E
60|$|I came to {{the city}} of <b>Antung,</b> and lodged with a merchant. He was a grain merchant. Corn he had, {{hundreds}} of bushels, stored in great bins of stout matting; peas and beans in sacks, and in the back yard his millstones went round and round, grinding out meal. Also, in his back yard, were buildings containing vats sunk into the ground, and here the tanners were at work making leather. I bought a measure of corn from mine host for my horses, and he overcharged me thirty cents. I was in China. <b>Antung</b> was jammed with Japanese troops. It was the thick of war. But it did not matter. The work of <b>Antung</b> went on just the same. The shops were wide open; the streets were lined with pedlars. One could buy anything; get anything made. I dined at a Chinese restaurant, cleansed myself at a public bath in a private tub with a small boy to assist in the scrubbing. I bought condensed milk, bitter, canned vegetables, bread, and cake. I repeat it, cake--good cake. I bought knives, forks, and spoons, granite-ware dishes and mugs. There were horseshoes and horseshoers. A worker in iron realized for me new designs of mine for my tent poles. My shoes were sent out to be repaired. A barber shampooed my hair. A servant returned with corn-beef in tins, a bottle of port, another of cognac, and beer, blessed beer, to wash out from my throat the dust of an army. It was the land of Canaan. I was in China.|$|E
60|$|Comes now the Japanese. On {{the streets}} of <b>Antung,</b> of Feng-Wang-Chang, or of any other Manchurian city, the {{following}} is a familiar scene: One is hurrying home through the dark of the unlighted streets when he comes upon a paper lantern resting on the ground. On one side squats a Chinese civilian on his hams, on the other side squats a Japanese soldier. One dips his forefinger in the dust and writes strange, monstrous characters. The other nods understanding, sweeps the dust slate level with his hand, and with his forefinger inscribes similar characters. They are talking. They cannot speak to each other, but they can write. Long ago one borrowed the other's written language, and long before that, untold generations ago, they diverged from a common root, the ancient Mongol stock.|$|E
50|$|<b>Antung</b> Province {{was first}} created in 1934 as an anto (province) of the Japanese-controlled Empire of Manchukuo, when the former Fengtian Province {{was divided into}} three parts: <b>Antung</b> Province, Fengtian Province and Jinzhou Province. <b>Antung</b> was further sub-divided in 1939 into <b>Antung</b> Province and Tonghua Province.|$|E
50|$|After the {{annexation}} of Manchukuo by the Republic of China {{after the end}} of World War II, the Kuomintang reunited <b>Antung</b> and Tonghua, and continued to recognize the area as <b>Antung</b> Province. However, under the administration of the People's Republic of China, <b>Antung</b> Province was renamed as Liaodong Province and it was abolished in 1954, and its area was divided between Liaoning Province and Jilin Province.|$|E
50|$|The {{capital of}} <b>Antung</b> Province from 1934-1939 was Tonghua (Chinese: 通化; Wade-Giles: T'unghua). However, after the 1939 {{administrative}} {{reorganization of the}} province, the capital moved to <b>Antung,</b> an important border town between Manchukuo and Korea, and a major center on the railroad from Korea to Mukden.|$|E

50|$|In June 1950 the Korean War began. By October 1950 Pepelyayev {{commanded}} the 196th IAP. Secretly the USSR sent several air regiments {{equipped with the}} MiG-15 to the Chinese base of <b>Antung</b> in Manchuria to support Chinese ground forces. In December 1950 the 64th IAK (Fighter Corps) with two fighter regiments was created; the 176th GvIAP and 196th IAP (Pepelyayev’s unit).

50|$|In April 1951, {{promoted}} to Polkovnik (colonel), he commanded the 324th IAD (Fighter Air Division) and dispatched to <b>Antung</b> airfield on the China-North Korea border {{to fly the}} MiG 15 during the Korean War supporting the North Korean forces. He was not given permission to participate in combat missions.

50|$|Immediately {{before the}} start of the Russo-Japanese War, Zasulich was given command of the 2nd Siberian Army Corps, with 16,000 infantry, 5,000 cavalry, and 62 {{artillery}} pieces, which formed the eastern wing of the Russian Manchurian Army. Assigned to prevent the Imperial Japanese Army from crossing the Yalu River into Manchuria, he made the tactical error of spreading his forces piecemeal over a 170-mile front and heavily fortifying the border of town of <b>Antung,</b> where he was convinced the main attack would come. Assuming that the Japanese army amassing near Wiju upstream from <b>Antung</b> was a feint, he refused requests to redeploy his forces. In the subsequent Battle of Yalu River, the Russian forces were routed by Japanese First Army under General Kuroki Tamemoto. Zasulich, who had a very low opinion of the Japanese, initially refused General Kuropatkin's orders to make a phased withdrawal, but as the Japanese army began to completely overwhelm his forces, he had no choice but to make a costly retreat to the north. Zasulich was replaced as field commander by Lieutenant General Fyodor Keller, but retained command of the Second Siberian Army Corps.|$|E
