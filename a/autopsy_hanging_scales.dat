40|$|Development {{partners}} and public investors assume that spate irrigation reduces household poverty and malnutrition. This article examines whether the poverty profiles of smallholder farmers and the nutritional outcomes {{of their children}} have improved {{as a result of}} using spate irrigation. The study areas were in two regional states in Ethiopia. Twenty-five users each, both from traditional and modern spate irrigation schemes, and an equal number of non-users responded to a structured questionnaire. Anthropometric measures of 122 children under five were measured using a <b>hanging</b> <b>scale</b> and stadiometer. The results indicated that all poverty indices were significantly lower for the spate irrigation users compared to non-users, and were even lower for modern spate compared to traditional spate systems. Our results did not show gender differences, using sex of the household head as a crude measure of gender, in poverty profiles. Stochastic dominance tests showed that the poverty comparisons between users, traditional and modern, and non-users are statistically robust. It can be concluded that the use of spate irrigation can significantly reduce poverty, and modernizing spate systems further increases its poverty-reduction impact. However, anthropometric measures indicated that use of spate irrigation did not have significant nutritional effects, suggesting the need for nutrition-sensitive interventions, such as nutrition education and awareness and multisectoral collaboration...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe hanging mark is {{the most}} {{relevant}} feature of hanging and its characteristics are {{well known in the}} literature. Most of the time, the ligature material is not available during <b>autopsy</b> examination in <b>hanging.</b> Hence, the features of the ligature material are not submitted to systematic analysis. However, the type and position of the knot {{plays an important role in}} the mechanism of death and <b>autopsy</b> findings in <b>hanging.</b> Out of the total hanging deaths, complete hanging was seen in 67. 7 % of the cases, but a typical hanging was noted in only 10. 2 % of the cases. The commonest type of ligature material used for ligation around the neck was nylon rope followed by odhni and jute rope. The fixed knot was noted in 64. 6 % of the cases and a running (slip) in 21. 3 % of the cases. The commonest position of the knot was at nape of the neck, followed by the left side of the neck at mastoid process. The number of turns/loops of a ligature around the neck was one turn in 72. 4 % and two in 25. 2 % the hanging deaths.

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{investigate}} the Morphometric Trait Characteristics of West African Dwarf (WAD) Goats in five Local Government Areas of Abia State. A total of One Hundred & Twenty Three (123) WAD goats (33 bucks and 90 does) were randomly sampled from local farmers in the area (Umuahia – South, Isiala –Ngwa North, Ikwuano, Isuikwuato and Ukwa East LGAs). The study lasted two consecutive months and the experimental animals were raised semi- intensively and fed with fresh green forages and kitchen wastes. Drinking water was provided ad libitum. Goats {{between the ages of}} less than a year and four years were used based on their dentition. The body weight and linear body measurements were determined using a <b>hanging</b> <b>scale</b> and tailor’s tape respectively. The following linear body measurements (LBMs) were taken: Withers Height (WH), Rump Height (RH), Rump Width (RW), and Body Length (BL). Others include Heart Girth (HG), Neck Circumference (NC), Face Length (FL), Neck Length (NL), Ear Length (EL) and Foreleg Length (FLL). Results obtained showed that BWT, RH and HG of WAD goats were significantly (p 0. 05) influenced on all morphometric traits studied. In all parameters studied, Does were superior to Bucks. Based on this study, it is established that Morphometric characteristics of WAD goats are affected by age and sex of the animals...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess the sheep breeds, traditional sheep breeding practices and flock structure in four selected representative rural kebeles in Burie district North Western Ethiopia. Informal and formal surveys in the selected kebeles were conducted. The farmers interviewed were selected by using random sampling method. In addition, sheep flocks within the selected kebeles were selected and body weight (BW) using <b>hanging</b> <b>scale,</b> sex and age (estimated based on dentition) of the animals were measured and recorded. There were two sheep breeds in the study area, Washera and Horro. The proportion of the sheep breeds in the sheep flocks among the study kebeles was different. There were more Washera sheep (98 %) in Woheni Durebetie kebele and more Horro sheep (92 %) in Boko Tabo kebele. On average, one farmer had 3. 7 ± 2. 46 heads of sheep per household (n = 127). The mean body weight of sheep in the sheep flocks was 21. 6 ± 9. 34 kg (n = 1211). The proportion of male and female sheep in the sheep flocks was 30. 5 % and 69. 5 %, respectively. Farmers in the study area practice crossbreeding Washera with Horro breed. There is a possibility of inbreeding in the sheep flocks. In addition, more productive male animals are being sold, slaughtered or castrated at a young age, so, there is a chance to reduce the population of such animals in future generations. To bring improvements in sheep production and to maintain genetic diversity in the sheep flocks in Burie District, proper sheep breeding system should be planned and implemented.

40|$|Individual {{leatherback}} hatchlings vary in size {{when compared}} to individuals from other nests, as well as individuals from the same nest. It is thought that many factors affect hatchling size but {{that one of the}} most influential factors is maternal size. Of all the aspects of a mother which could affect hatchling size, evidence for question concerning influence of mother size is determinable within the field using minimal tools and basic statistical analysis. If a direct correlation exists between mother size and hatchling size then the claim can be made that larger mothers produce larger offspring while smaller mothers produce smaller offspring (or vice versa). 776 hatchlings from 38 nests, representing 28 mothers, were massed using a <b>hanging</b> spring <b>scale</b> and measured (length, width, and depth of carapace) using digital calipers. These data for length and width of carapace for each nest were averaged and compared to the mother’s size data (length and width of carapace) to determine if a size correlation exists. It was found that no hatchlings measurements correlated with either of the mother size measurements. No size correlations may indicate other, more influential factors exist which affect hatchling size. These other factors may include mother age, genetics, health, and tissue toxin levels; the father’s genetics; and environmental conditions where the nest was laid during egg development. Future studies should determine if any of these factors have a direct affect on hatchling size...|$|R

Both systems of weighing were used on board a well-boat in which the well was divided into two separate compartments; and each load weighed was controlled after transport to land.

40|$|Abstract—Measuring hillslope erosion has {{historically}} been a costly, time-consuming practice. An easy to install low-cost technique using silt fences (geotextile fabric) and tipping bucket rain gauges to measure onsite hillslope erosion was developed and tested. Equipment requirements, installation procedures, statistical design, and analysis methods for measuring hillslope erosion are discussed. The use of silt fences is versatile; various plot sizes {{can be used to}} measure hillslope erosion in different settings and to determine effectiveness of various treatments or practices. Silt fences are installed by making a sediment trap facing upslope such that runoff cannot go around the ends of the silt fence. The silt fence is folded to form a pocket for the sediment to settle on and reduce the possibility of sediment undermining the silt fence. Cleaning out and weighing the accumulated sediment in the field can be accomplished with a portable <b>hanging</b> or platform <b>scale</b> at various time intervals depending on the necessary degree of detail in the measurement of erosion (that is, after every storm, quarterly, or seasonally). Silt fences combined with a tipping bucket rain gauge provide an easy, low-cost method to quantify precipitation/hillslope erosion relationships. Trap efficiency of the silt fences are greater that 90 percent efficient, thus making them suitable to estimate hillslope erosion...|$|R
50|$|Faraday force {{magnetometry}} {{uses the}} fact that a spatial magnetic field gradient produces force that acts on a magnetized object, F=(M⋅∇)B. In Faraday Force Magnetometry the force on the sample can be measured by a <b>scale</b> (<b>hanging</b> the sample from a sensitive balance), or by detecting the displacement against a spring. Commonly a capacitive load cell or cantilever is used because of its sensitivity, size, and lack of mechanical parts. Faraday Force Magnetometry is approximately one order of magnitude less sensitive than a SQUID. The biggest drawback to Faraday Force Magnetometry is that it requires some means of not only producing a magnetic field, but also producing a magnetic field gradient. While this can be accomplished by using a set of special pole faces, a much better result can be achieved by using set of gradient coils. A major advantage to Faraday Force Magnetometry is that it is small and reasonably tolerant to noise, and thus can be implemented {{in a wide range of}} environments, including a dilution refrigerator. Faraday Force Magnetometry can also be complicated by the presence of torque (see previous technique). This can be circumvented by varying the gradient field independently of the applied DC field so the torque and the Faraday Force contribution can be separated, and/or by designing a Faraday Force Magnetometer that prevents the sample from being rotated.|$|R
40|$|Assessment of {{the small}} {{ruminants}} production systems was conducted in four selected representative rural kebeles, namely, Woheni Durebetie, Woyenema Ambaye, Denbun and Boko Tabo in Burie Woreda to assess the farmers’ traditional small ruminants management practices, to identify and prioritize the constraints {{of the small}} ruminants production systems. The study was carried out through informal and formal surveys in the selected kebeles. The farmers interviewed in the informal survey were selected purposively and for the formal survey, by systematic random sampling method. In addition, sheep/ goat flocks in the grazing fields were selected randomly and body weight (BW) (using <b>hanging</b> <b>scale),</b> sex and age (by dentition) of the animals were measured and recorded. Farmers in the study area rear sheep for two main purposes, for cash income and home slaughter on festivals. On average, one household had 3. 7 ± 2. 46 heads of sheep (n = 127). There were two sheep breeds in the study kebeles, Washera and Horro. The mean body weight of sheep in the flock was 21. 6 ± 9. 34 kg (n = 1211). From the current survey result, it was evident that there were more Washera sheep (98 %) in Woheni Durebetie Kebele and more Horro sheep (92 %) in Boko Tabo Kebele in Burie Woreda. As farmers in the study area sell, castrate and slaughter males at a very young age, there is a possibility of inbreeding in the sheep flocks. The main feed resources for sheep in the area are natural pasture and stubble grazing. In addition, most farmers supplement salt and atella (a local beer (tela) residue) to their animals. There is feed shortage problem both during the dry and rainy seasons in the highland kebeles. Based on calculation of feed requirement for the existing livestock per household, there is a deficit of 0. 7 ton DM feed per household per year in the highland kebeles. One household in the area sold on average 1. 1 ± 1. 40 heads of sheep (n = 127) per year. Farmers mainly sell sheep during Easter, New Year and Christmas. Sheep from the woreda and neighbouring woredas and even neighbouring region enters into the woreda for marketing. Among the constraints identified in sheep production, sheep diseases, lack of adequate veterinary service and feed and nutrient shortage are the main ones. To bring improvements in sheep production in Burie Woreda, these constraints should be given more emphasis in research and development activities {{that are going to be}} undertaken in the area. The goat production system in the study area is similar in several respects to the sheep production system. Two on-farm feeding trials were conducted in Arebesi, Tiya Tiya and Sertekez kebeles in Burie Woreda. The objectives of the trials were to evaluate the weight change performance of the lambs when they were fed urea treated wheat straw and concentrates, to estimate the economic feasibility and to assess farmers evaluation of these feeding practices. The lambs used in the trial were all local breeds (Washera, Horro and crossbreds) and of male sex. The animals used in the grazing and wheat straw feeding trial had an initial body weight of 20. 8 ± 3. 88 kg (n = 18) and 23. 3 ± 4. 37 kg (n = 32) and an initial age of 8. 7 ± 1. 68 months (n = 18) and 10. 2 ± 1. 84 months (n = 32), respectively. The wheat straw that was used for the trial was treated with 5 % urea. The following treatments were used in the trials. In the grazing trial, farmers’ traditional fattening practices and grazing plus 200 g concentrate mix supplement. In the wheat straw feeding trial, untreated wheat straw plus 200 g concentrate mix and urea treated wheat straw plus 200 g concentrate mix supplement. The concentrate mix consisted of 75 % groundnut cake (150 g) and 25 % wheat bran (50 g). A completely randomized design was employed for the on-farm feeding trials. At the end of the feeding trials, farmers’ were interviewed individually and in a group to evaluate the results of the feeding trials. Economic analysis was done using partial budget analysis. The trials were conducted for 86 days. The experimental animals consumed almost all the concentrate feed mix offered to them during the trials. The animals’ consumption of urea treated and untreated wheat straw was very low, 52. 8 g and 7. 4 g per day, respectively. There was no difference (P> 0. 05) on final BW and daily BW gain between the treatments in the wheat straw feeding trial. But, in the grazing trial, there was a difference (P< 0. 05) on final BW and daily BW gain between the treatments. The animals in the concentrate supplemented treatment and the control group had a mean final BW of 24. 6 kg and 21. 9 kg and a mean daily BW gain of 43. 6 g and 12. 9 g per day, respectively. Supplementation of groundnut cake and wheat bran mix to grazing sheep was feasible based on partial budget analysis also. Furthermore, this treatment was selected to be the best by farmers’ evaluation and has a potential for adoption by farmers. Hence, this feeding practice can be scaled up to be widely used in the study area. Canadian International Development Agenc...|$|R
40|$|We have {{designed}} {{a series of}} fully dynamic numerical simulations aimed at assessing how the orientation of mechanical layering in rocks controls the orientation of shear bands {{and the depth of}} penetration of strain in the footwall of detachment zones. Two parametric studies are presented. In the first one, the influence of stratification orientation on the occurrence and mode of strain localisation is tested by varying initial dip of inherited layering in the footwall with regard to the orientation of simple shear applied at the rigid boundary simulating a rigid <b>hanging</b> wall, all <b>scaling</b> and rheological parameter kept constant. It appears that when Mohr–Coulomb plasticity is being used, shear bands are found to localise only when the layering is being stretched. This corresponds to early deformational stages for inital layering dipping {{in the same direction as}} the shear is applied, and to later stages for intial layering dipping towards the opposite direction of shear. In all the cases, localisation of the strain after only γ = 1 requires plastic yielding to be activated in the strong layer. The second parametric study shows that results are length-scale independent and that orientation of shear bands is not sensitive to the viscosity contrast or the strain rate. However, decreasing or increasing strain rate is shown to reduce the capacity of the shear zone to localise strain. In the later case, the strain pattern resembles a mylonitic band but the rheology is shown to be effectively linear. Based on the results, a conceptual model for strain localisation under detachment faults is presented. In the early stages, strain localisation occurs at slow rates by viscous shear instabilities but as the layered media is exhumed, the temperature drops and the strong layers start yielding plastically, forming shear bands and localising strain at the top of the shear zone. Once strain localisation has occured, the deformation in the shear band becomes extremely penetrative but the strength cannot drop since the shear zone has a finite thickness...|$|R
