5|$|Amarillo is {{considered}} the regional economic center for the Texas Panhandle as well as Eastern New Mexico and the Oklahoma Panhandle. The meat packing industry is a major employer in Amarillo; <b>about</b> <b>one-quarter</b> <b>of</b> the United States' beef supply is processed in the area. The city is also the location of headquarters for the Texas Cattle Feeders Association. Petroleum extraction is also a major industry. The helium industry has decreased in significance since the federal government privatized local operations in the late 1990s. Bell Helicopter Textron opened a helicopter assembly plant near the city's international airport in 1999.|$|E

5|$|Retreat of the Little Ice Age glaciers {{was slow}} until about 1920 when retreat became more rapid. Between {{the height of}} the Little Ice Age and 1950, Mount Rainier's glaciers lost <b>about</b> <b>one-quarter</b> <b>of</b> their length. Beginning in 1950 and {{continuing}} through the early 1980s, however, many of the major glaciers advanced in response to relatively cooler temperatures of the mid-century. The Carbon, Cowlitz, Emmons, and Nisqually Glaciers advanced during the late 1970s and early 1980s as a result of high snowfalls during the 1960s and 1970s. Since the early-1980s, however, many glaciers have been thinning and retreating and some advances have slowed.|$|E

5|$|In the 1970s, the {{predominantly}} mining and agricultural-based economy began a transition towards a more multi-sector economy. Since the 1980s, the industrial sector, {{with a high}} level of investment, has led the country's growth. The economy recovered from the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis earlier than neighbouring countries did, and has since recovered to the levels of the pre-crisis era with a GDP per capita of $14,800. Economic inequalities exist between different ethnic groups. The Chinese make up <b>about</b> <b>one-quarter</b> <b>of</b> the population, but accounts for 70 per cent of the country's market capitalisation. Chinese businesses in Malaysia are part of the larger bamboo network, a network of overseas Chinese businesses in the Southeast Asian market sharing common family and cultural ties.|$|E
5|$|On August 23, the modest-sized Austrian film {{industry}} {{came out with}} a talkie: G'schichten aus der Steiermark (Stories from Styria), an Eagle Film–Ottoton Film production. On September 30, the first entirely German-made feature-length dramatic talkie, Das Land ohne Frauen (Land Without Women), premiered. A Tobis Filmkunst production, <b>about</b> <b>one-quarter</b> <b>of</b> the movie contained dialogue, which was strictly segregated from the special effects and music. The response was underwhelming. Sweden's first talkie, Konstgjorda Svensson (Artificial Svensson), premiered on October 14. Eight days later, Aubert Franco-Film came out with Le Collier de la reine (The Queen's Necklace), shot at the Épinay studio near Paris. Conceived as a silent film, it was given a Tobis-recorded score and a single talking sequence—the first dialogue scene in a French feature. On October 31, Les Trois masques debuted; a Pathé-Natan film, it is generally regarded as the initial French feature talkie, though it was shot, like Blackmail, at the Elstree studio, just outside London. The production company had contracted with RCA Photophone and Britain then had the nearest facility with the system. The Braunberger-Richebé talkie La Route est belle, also shot at Elstree, followed a few weeks later.|$|E

40|$|By {{measuring}} time-dependent optical birefringence with 4 -femtosecond (fs) laser pulses, we {{determine the}} time scale for photoinduced melting of orbital {{order in the}} single-layer manganite La 0. 5 Sr 1. 5 MnO 4. Such high time resolution is required to distinguish atomic motions that control the Jahn-Teller distortion from even faster electronic rearrangements. The experiment reveals an 18 fs bottleneck {{for the loss of}} orbital order, corresponding to <b>about</b> <b>one-quarter</b> period <b>of</b> the in-plane Jahn-Teller mode. Furthermore, we observe coherent oscillations of this Jahn-Teller mode. Both their amplitude and the birefringence drop exhibit a threshold in their fluence dependence, indicating cooperativity in the lattice response...|$|R

Hannibal Collins, a freed slave and Oliver Hazard Perry's personal servant, is thought to be the oarsman in William Henry Powell's Battle of Lake Erie. Collins earned his freedom as a veteran of the Revolutionary War, having fought in the Battle of Rhode Island. He accompanied Perry for the rest of Perry's naval career, and was with him at Perry's death in Trinidad in 1819.|$|E
25|$|Max Weber {{and some}} schools of {{modernization}} theory suggest that cultural values could affect economic success. However, researchers have gathered evidence {{that suggest that}} values are not as deeply ingrained and that changing economic opportunities explain most of the movement {{into and out of}} poverty, as opposed to shifts in values. Studies have shown that poverty changes the personalities of children who live in it. The Great Smoky Mountains Study was a ten-year study that was unexpectedly able to demonstrate this. During the study, <b>about</b> <b>one-quarter</b> <b>of</b> the families saw a dramatic and unexpected increase in income. The study showed that among these children, instances of behavioral and emotional disorders decreased, and conscientiousness and agreeableness increased.|$|E

25|$|<b>About</b> <b>one-quarter</b> <b>of</b> {{the poems}} in the Carmina Burana are {{accompanied}} {{in the manuscript}} by music using unheighted, staffless neumes, an archaic system of musical notation {{that by the time}} of the manuscript had largely been superseded by staffed neumes. Unheighted neumes only indicate whether a given note is pitched higher or lower than the preceding note, without giving any indication of how much change in pitch there is between two notes, so they are useful only as mnemonic devices for singers who are already familiar with the melody. However, it is possible to identify many of those melodies by comparing them with melodies notated in staffed neumes in other contemporary manuscripts from the schools of Notre Dame and Saint Martial.|$|E
25|$|The area of Oaxaca {{has been}} divided into small {{entities}} since far {{back into the}} pre-Hispanic period. Much {{of the reason for}} this is the highly mountainous geography, although the occupation of the area by numerous ethnicities is a factor as well. The area resisted large scale Spanish domination through the colonial era, and maintained local traditions and customs better than other areas of Mexico. Even today, the state has far more municipalities and semi autonomous local authorities than any other state in the nation. Oaxaca is divided into 570 municipalities, <b>about</b> <b>one-quarter</b> <b>of</b> the total of the country. Many of the municipalities of the state had been ill-defined from colonial times until the 1990 INEGI survey which delineated them with exact coordinates. The most populated municipality is the capital, followed by San Juan Bautista Tuxtepec and Juchitán de Zaragoza. There is also a system of thirty districts to group municipalities.|$|E
25|$|The {{surviving}} {{texts of}} the Avesta, as they exist today, derive from a single master copy produced by Sasanian Empire-era (224–651 CE) collation and recension. That master copy, now lost, {{is known as the}} 'Sassanian archetype'. The oldest surviving manuscript (K1) of an Avestan language text is dated 1323 CE. Summaries of the various Avesta texts found in the 9th/10th century texts of Zoroastrian tradition suggest that {{a significant portion of the}} literature in the Avestan language has been lost. Only <b>about</b> <b>one-quarter</b> <b>of</b> the Avestan sentences or verses referred to by the 9th/10th century commentators can be found in the surviving texts. This suggests that three-quarters of Avestan material, including an indeterminable number of juridical, historical and legendary texts, have been lost since then. On the other hand, it appears that the most valuable portions of the canon, including all of the oldest texts, have survived. The likely reason for this is that the surviving materials represent those portions of the Avesta that were in regular liturgical use, and therefore known by heart by the priests and not dependent for their preservation on the survival of particular manuscripts.|$|E

Reports were mainly quantitative, and did not consistently distinguish (cyber) bullying from general aggression. Suggestions are made for future research in this area, in Thailand and other Southeast Asian countries...|$|R
