The pep band is entirely voluntary and all students at Cal Poly Pomona or <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area are free to join.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, Jamie presents Dylan {{with the}} contract to sign so she can land her commission for recruiting him. Not knowing <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city, he and Jamie quickly develop a strong platonic friendship. One night, they get {{on the topic of}} sex and relationships. They {{come to the conclusion that}} sex should not come with so many emotional attachments. As they both feel the need for a physical connection, they agree to have sex without emotion or commitment. After several trysts together, Jamie comes to the realization that this is not really what she wants and she would like to start dating again. She tells Dylan that they need to stop.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{excitement}} surrounding King's performance, the Americans did not fare well overall, {{and the results}} may have been worse than hoped for by the tour's promoters. Philadelphia won only two of their fifteen matches, losing nine and earning a draw in the remaining four. After their win against Sussex, the only other win of the tour came against Warwickshire. During this match, King took 5 for 95 and 7 for 72 and scored 46 runs. According to Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, King proved himself {{to be the best}} bowler on the American side and had to do much of the work. He bowled three hundred overs, more than <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> team, taking 72 wickets with a bowling average of a little over 24 runs. In addition to his bowling, King scored 441 runs as a batsman at a batting average of just over 20.|$|E

5|$|During 1948, Hutton scored heavily for Yorkshire. Despite missing {{more than}} half the County Championship matches, he scored more runs at a better average than <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> side. In county matches, Hutton {{averaged}} 92.05 and scored eight centuries. Some Yorkshire critics expressed concern at the team's dependence on Hutton and the poor performance of other batsmen. Hutton's main challenge that season came from the Australian side which toured England undefeated and won the Test series 4–0. In {{the early part of the}} tour, the Australians, and particularly the pace bowlers Lindwall and Miller, tried to shake Hutton's confidence by targeting him. Although Hutton failed on a difficult pitch in Yorkshire's match against the tourists, he was the only successful batsman against them when he appeared for MCC shortly after.|$|E
5|$|During the 2009–10 season, Rolle started 33 games, in 24 {{of which}} he scored in double figures and in 11 {{of which he}} had double-doubles. He {{rejected}} more shots than <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> WAC, averaging 2.1 blocks per game, and finished fourth in career blocked shots at Louisiana Tech despite playing there for only two seasons. Rolle also posted averages of 8.4 rebounds per game, third in the WAC (behind Luke Babbitt of Nevada and Chis Oakes of San Jose State), and 13.9 points per game, 12th in the WAC. His field goal percentage was 51.1, tied with Babbitt for third in conference and behind Tai Wesley of Utah State and Ike Okoye of Boise State. At the conclusion of the season, Rolle was named to the Lefty Driesell All-America Defensive Team, All-WAC Defensive Team, All-WAC Second Team, and All-Louisiana Second Team. He graduated from Louisiana Tech with a bachelor's degree in sociology in March 2010, becoming the first person in his family to earn a degree.|$|E
5|$|They realise {{that this}} was a trap {{arranged}} by Kovarian, as the Silence begin to escape confinement and overload the eyedrives (including Madame Kovarian's), killing their users. The Doctor and River escape {{to the top of the}} pyramid while Amy and Rory fight off a wave of Silence and Amy realises who Rory is. Madame Kovarian dislodges her own eyedrive as it begins to overload, but Amy forces it back in place with the intention of killing her as revenge for Kovarian taking her child (Melody Pond) away. Amy and Rory regroup with River and the Doctor. River tries to convince the Doctor that this frozen timeline is acceptable and that he does not have to die, but the Doctor explains that all of reality will soon break down. River claims she'll suffer more than <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> universe if she has to kill the Doctor, despite his horror at the idea. To stop it, the Doctor marries River on the spot and whispers something in her ear, declaring that he had just told her his name. He then requests that River allow him to prevent the universe's destruction. The two kiss, and reality begins to return to normal.|$|E

50|$|A quiet {{young girl}} who dresses in a very formal kimono dress and {{generally}} seems to have an aura of mystery around her. For some reason her hair always covers what some might believe to be her eyes — it is later {{found out that she}} underwent surgery to give her eyes to Chairman Yuki because he had gone blind and she felt sorry for him. However, it was discovered that she was a Dynamis user and thus did not need her eyes in order for her to see. Because she has lived such a long time without her eyesight, her Dynamis is much further advanced than <b>anyone</b> <b>else's</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> series, as she has the power to lift even the largest buildings. Later <b>in</b> <b>the</b> series she is in fact revealed to be Chairman Yuki's clone and therefore a boy. His death <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final battle is gruesome, as Tria's God Beast form tears him limb from limb.|$|R
50|$|Elkind {{also created}} terms to help {{describe}} the egocentric behaviors {{exhibited by the}} adolescent population such as what he calls an imaginary audience, the personal fable, and the invincibility fable. Usually when an egocentric adolescent is experiencing an imaginary audience, it entails the belief {{that there is an}} audience captivated and constantly present to an extent of being overly interested about the egocentric individual. Personal fable refers to the idea that many teenagers believe their thoughts, feelings, and experiences are unique and more extreme than <b>anyone</b> <b>else's.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> invincibility fable, <b>the</b> adolescent believes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> idea {{that he or she is}} immune to misfortune and cannot be harmed by things that might defeat a normal person. Egocentrism in adolescence is often viewed as a negative aspect of their thinking ability because adolescents become consumed with themselves and are unable to effectively function in society due to their skewed version of reality and cynicism.|$|R

25|$|In 1778, Samuel {{painted the}} women on a {{speculative}} basis without taking sittings {{in an attempt to}} advance his career as a portrait and history painter. The resulting work was exhibited at the exhibition in 1778 where it attracted little attention.

[...] If it was, they request medical records and try to interview the patient (or a proxy) and <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> incident (e.g. supervisors, applicators, and witnesses).

25|$|He {{continued}} to play domestic first-class cricket until a knee injury forced him to retire after the 1968-69 season.

50|$|Bugliosi writes {{at length}} about the {{allegations}} that LAPD detective Mark Fuhrman had planted a bloody glove in order to frame Simpson.

Bugliosi points out that it was highly improbable that Fuhrman or <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case would have tried to frame Simpson, as California law at the time provided that anyone who planted evidence in a death penalty case could have faced the death penalty themselves (though prosecutors ultimately did not seek the death penalty).|$|R

In the fall of 1934, she took a job {{teaching at the}} University of New Mexico in the Department of Anthropology where she made less than the male professors. As a professor Hawley was not considered easy; she expected her students to learn and to think on their own. She taught over 20 courses, several of which were usually taught by men.

25|$|In February–March 1994, {{detailed}} {{reports from}} the Canadian embassy in Kigali meant that the Canadian government {{was one of the}} best informed nations in the world about the coming Rwandan genocide. The foreign minister André Ouellet claimed that he nor <b>anyone</b> <b>else</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Cabinet ever saw the reports from Rwanda. On April 6, 1994, the Rwandan genocide began. The government in Ottawa was apparently kept well-informed about what was happening by diplomats and Canadian Forces serving as UN peacekeepers, but the genocide was not considered to be a major problem for Canada, with the Chrétien government taking the view that other powers would stop the genocide. The government first insisted in April 1994 that there was only a civil war in Rwanda, and once it become clear that genocide had begun, on May 2, 1994, Ouellet, speaking for the government in the House of Commons promised humanitarian aid and expressed the hope that the Organization for African Unity would do something to stop the genocide. In 2010, the Canadian government apologized to the people of Rwanda for indifference to the genocide of 1994.|$|E
