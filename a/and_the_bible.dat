5|$|Priestley {{eventually}} {{decided to}} return to his theological studies and, in 1752, matriculated at Daventry, a Dissenting academy. Because he had already read widely, Priestley was allowed to skip {{the first two years of}} coursework. He continued his intense study; this, together with the liberal atmosphere of the school, shifted his theology further leftward and he became a Rational Dissenter. Abhorring dogma and religious mysticism, Rational Dissenters emphasised the rational analysis of the natural world <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bible.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Age of Reason {{provoked}} a hostile reaction from most readers and critics, although {{the intensity of}} that hostility varied by locality. There were four major factors for this animosity: Paine denied that the Bible was a sacred, inspired text; he argued that Christianity was a human invention; his ability to command a large readership frightened those in power; and his irreverent and satirical style of writing about Christianity <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bible</b> offended many believers.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the process}} that was {{to lead to the}} 1996 Doctor Who film, Universal Television had Amblin Entertainment produce a writers' bible which {{detailed}} John Leekley's proposed pilot and episodes of a new series. The new series would have established a new continuity rather than following on from the classic series, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>bible</b> reused many elements from the classic series. It is unclear whether clearance could have been obtained for all the episodes detailed, as the costs would likely have fallen to the BBC.|$|E

5|$|In its {{original}} broadcast, the episode {{was seen by}} approximately 12.2million viewers, a drop from the previous episode which garnered 15.5million viewers. Following its broadcast, the episode received mixed reviews from critics, but won an Annie award {{in the category of}} Best Animated Television Production. In 2007, the episode was released as part of The Simpsons - The Complete Tenth Season DVD box set, and a promotional poster for the episode was included in an exhibition in Sherwin Miller Museum of Jewish Art in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The episode's ending scene is one of series creator Matt Groening's favorite moments on The Simpsons. The episode has been credited with fostering a critical literacy towards religion <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bible</b> among its viewers.|$|E
5|$|Locust plagues {{can have}} devastating effects on human {{population}}s, causing famines and population upheavals. They are mentioned {{in both the}} Koran <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bible</b> and have also been held responsible for cholera epidemics, resulting from the corpses of locusts drowned in the Mediterranean Sea and decomposing on beaches. The FAO and other organisations monitor locust activity around the world. Timely application of pesticides can prevent nomadic bands of hoppers from forming before dense swarms of adults can build up. Besides conventional control using contact insecticides, biological pest control using the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium acridum, which specifically infects grasshoppers, has been used with some success.|$|E
5|$|Stanton {{wished for}} {{a greater degree of}} {{scholarship}} in The Woman's Bible, but was unable to convince Bible scholars of her day to take part in what was expected to be a controversial project. Scholars continued to avoid addressing the subject of sexism in the Bible until 1964 when Margaret Brackenbury Crook published Women and Religion, a study of the status of women in Judaism and Christianity. In her 1973 book Beyond God the Father, Mary Daly discussed The Woman's Bible, and subsequent works by Letty Russell and Phyllis Trible furthered the connection between feminism <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bible.</b> Today, biblical scholarship by women has come into maturity, with women posing new questions about the Bible, and challenging the very basis of biblical studies.|$|E

5|$|On 6 August {{the police}} removed the McCanns' hired car. Keela and Eddie {{were taken to}} an {{underground}} car park opposite the Polícia Judiciária headquarters in Portimão, where 11 cars were parked, 20–30 feet apart, including the McCanns' and Robert Murat's. Eddie, the cadaver dog, gave an alert outside the McCanns' car and inside the boot (trunk). Keela alerted to the map compartment in the driver's door, which contained the ignition key and key ring. When the key ring was hidden underneath sand in a fire bucket, she alerted again, as she did when the bucket was moved to a different floor of the car park. One or both dogs gave alerts at Cuddle Cat, Kate's clothes <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bible.</b> The McCanns' lawyer said that, if there was indeed a smell of corpses on Kate's clothes, {{it could have been}} caused by her contact with corpses as a family doctor. Almost immediately the Portuguese press began running stories that Madeleine had died inside apartment 5A.|$|E
