Austin {{retained}} the Intercontinental Championship and regained the belt by defeating The Rock at D-Generation X: In Your House. Austin forfeited the title to The Rock the next night on Raw is War with the sole intention of going after the WWF World Heavyweight Championship before hitting The Rock with a Stone Cold Stunner.|$|E

5000|$|Meanwhile, Billy convinces Janie {{that she}} {{imagined}} the murder. He {{gives her a}} necklace and instructs her {{to go and get}} ready for her next client. Angel follows Billy to an abandoned store. Angel is surrounded by six pimps, menacingly wielding baseball bats. Billy asks him [...] "So... Curious John. What are you doing following me? Who are you?" [...] <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>beat</b> Angel says, [...] "The Dark Avenger." [...] The six thugs pause for a moment, unsure how to respond, giving Angel time to strike them by surprise. He fights off the men, then notices a symbol on the wall by the shrine, a cracked circle within an oval.|$|E
5000|$|Both Charles and James {{were raised}} in Olympia, Washington, home of K Records and Kill Rock Stars, and they soaked up a {{thriving}} indie music scene. [...] Before convening Math and Physics Club {{they were in a}} band called Drive Car Girl (named <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>Beat</b> Happening song). They played about a dozen shows at local clubs and coffee houses with a set of 12-15 original songs, along with covers of songs by REM, Nancy Sinatra and Kraftwerk. Former members of Drive Car Girl include Brent Cole Whats Up Magazine and Sean Berry Double Crown Records. Elsewhere, Ethan shared guitar chords with high school friend Carrie Brownstein and later, as a student at The Evergreen State College featured in Jenny Jenkins' musical [...] "Love Is Stupid" [...] opposite Mirah. Ethan also began the Internet's first Beach Boys related mailing list, called [...] "surfsup", in January 1994.|$|E
5000|$|Dallas Sheriff Schmid had {{previously}} warned Clyde Barrow before an ambush at Sowers, Texas in November 1933. When he called [...] "Halt!", gunfire erupted from the outlaw car, {{it made a}} quick U-turn, and he saw rapidly vanishing taillights. Hinton later said it was [...] "the most futile gesture of the week." [...] When the two Louisiana posse officers discussed calling [...] "Halt!", the four Texans [...] "vetoed the idea," [...] telling them that Clyde's history had always been to shoot his way out, as had occurred in Platte City, Dexfield Park, and Sowers. It is unlikely that Hamer planned to give warning, but Oakley stood up and opened fire; <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>beat,</b> the other officers joined him in firing. Later, Jordan was reported as saying he called out to Barrow, Alcorn said Hamer called out, and Hinton claimed Alcorn did. In another report, they each said they both did. These conflicting claims were most likely collegial attempts to divert the focus from their gun-jumping associate Oakley, who later admitted firing too early.|$|E

5000|$|An infamous {{case was}} the torture and {{execution}} by the SB of Catholic priest Jerzy Popiełuszko in 1984. Since 1990, several SB operatives have been tried for their crimes.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the effects of atrial contraction on left ventricular function, the pressure gradient technique {{was used to measure}} instantaneous aortic blood flow and pressure in nine patients, six having complete heart block and three having normal sinus rhythm. From these data both left ventricular stroke volume and stroke work were calculated. Ventricular rate was controlled by transvenous right ventricular pacing over a range of 50 - 158 beats/min. At each heart rate, beats which were not preceded by a P wave served as controls. The other beats were divided into six groups according to the duration of the preceding PR interval. The results indicated that stroke volume and stroke work were always affected similarly. In one patient the presence of a P wave did not alter the subsequent stroke volume significantly. In the other patients, beats preceded by P waves had stroke volumes greater than the controls. In general, {{there was no difference in}} stroke volume for beats preceded by a P wave having a PR interval within the range of 0. 05 - 0. 20 sec. As the PR interval lengthened beyond 0. 20 sec stroke volume tended to decrease, especially at more rapid heart rates. The absolute increase in stroke volume <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>beat</b> preceded by a P wave (PR interval 0. 05 - 0. 20 sec) was quite variable among the patients. For a given patient the absolute increase in stroke volume was essentially independent of heart rate. The percentage change in stroke volume, however, was always greater as the heart rate increased...|$|E

5000|$|All of the {{defendants}} endured incessant interrogations which, for everyone except Itzik Fefer, were coupled with beatings and torture. Eventually, these tactics led to forced, false confessions. One defendant, Joseph Yuzefovich told the court at the trial, [...] "I was ready to confess that I was the pope's own nephew and that I was acting on his direct personal orders" [...] <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>beating.</b> Another defendant, Boris Shimeliovich, said he had counted over two thousand blows to his buttocks and heels, {{but he was the}} only member of the accused who refused to confess to any crimes.|$|R
5000|$|In every Popeye cartoon, {{the sailor}} is {{invariably}} put into {{what seems like}} a hopeless situation, upon which (usually <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>beating),</b> <b>a</b> can of spinach which he apparently regularly carries with him falls out from inside his shirt. Popeye immediately pops the can open and gulps the entire contents of it into his mouth, or sometimes sucks in the spinach through his corncob pipe. Upon swallowing the spinach, Popeye's physical strength immediately becomes superhuman, and he is easily able to save the day (and very often rescue Olive Oyl from a dire situation). It did not stop there, as spinach could also give Popeye the skills and powers he needed, as in The Man on the Flying Trapeze, where it gave him acrobatic skills. (When the antagonist is the Sea Hag, it is Olive who eats the spinach; Popeye can't hit a lady.) ...|$|R
