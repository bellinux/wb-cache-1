25|$|The {{earliest}} vernacular children's {{songs in}} Europe are lullabies from the later medieval period. From soon <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> records of short children's rhyming songs, but most nursery rhymes were not written down until the 18th century. The first English collections were Tommy Thumb's Song Book and a sequel, Tommy Thumb's Pretty Song Book, are both {{thought to have}} been published before 1744, and John Newbery's, Mother Goose's Melody, or, Sonnets for the Cradle (c.1785), is the first record we have of many classic rhymes. These rhymes seem to have come from a variety of sources, including traditional riddles, proverbs, ballads, lines of Mummers' plays, drinking songs, historical events, and, it has been suggested, ancient pagan rituals. Roughly half of the current body recognised 'traditional' English rhymes were known by the mid-18th century. From this period we sometimes know the origins and authors of rhymes, like 'Twinkle Twinkle Little Star', which combined an 18th-century French tune with a poem by English writer Jane Taylor and 'Mary Had a Little Lamb', written by Sarah Josepha Hale of Boston in 1830. The first, and possibly the most important collection to focus in this area was, James Orchard Halliwell's, The Nursery Rhymes of England (1842) and Popular Rhymes and Tales in 1849. At the height of the revival Sabine Baring-Gould produced A Book of Nursery Songs (1895), and Andrew Lang produced The Nursery Rhyme Book in 1897. Children's songs, unlike folk songs, have remained part of a living and continuous tradition, for although added to from other sources and affected by written versions, most adults pass on songs they learned from oral sources as children.|$|E
500|$|Gilchrist's {{autobiography}} True Colours, {{published in}} 2008, {{was the subject}} of much controversy. Gilchrist questioned the integrity of leading Indian batsman Sachin Tendulkar in relation to the evidence he presented in the Monkeygate dispute, which was about allegations of racism against Harbhajan Singh. The autobiography said that Tendulkar told the first hearing that he could not hear what Harbhajan said to Andrew Symonds; Gilchrist said he was [...] "certain he [...] was telling the truth" [...] because he was [...] "a fair way away". Gilchrist then questioned why Tendulkar then agreed with Harbhajan's claim at the second hearing that the exchange was an obscenity, and concluded that the process was [...] "a joke". He also raised questions over Tendulkar's sportsmanship and said he was [...] "hard to find for a changing-room handshake <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> beaten India".|$|E

[Picture: Washing line] We stayed {{two days}} at Streatley, and got our clothes washed. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> tried washing them ourselves, in the river, under George’s superintendence, {{and it had}} been a failure.

500|$|There are 44 {{letters to}} White's friend Thomas Pennant (1726–1798), {{of which the}} first nine were never posted and are thus undated. Of those that were posted, the first, Letter 10 giving an {{overview}} of Selborne, is dated 4 August 1767; the last, Letter 44 on wood pigeons, is dated 30 November 1780. It is not known how the men became friends, or even if they ever met; White writes repeatedly {{that he would like}} to meet [...] "to have a little conversation face to face <b>after</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> corresponded so freely for several years" [...] so it is certain they did not meet for long periods, and possible they never met at all. The letters are edited from the form in which they were actually posted; for example, Letter 10 as posted had a cringing introductory paragraph of thanks to Pennant which White edited out of the published version.|$|E
