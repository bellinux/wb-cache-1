30|$|The {{scarcity}} of electromagnetic spectrum is obvious, {{but the real}} problem is not a dearth of radio spectrum; it's the way that spectrum is used. The radio spectrum is actually poorly utilized in many bands in the sense that large portion of the <b>assigned</b> <b>bands</b> are not used most of the time [1]. A solution to this inefficiency is to allow opportunistic unlicensed access to the poorly utilized frequency bands that have been already allocated. This more flexible allocation approach is known as cognitive radio (CR) [2].|$|R

The spectral simulation using a quasidiabatic Hamiltonian H(d) comprised of polynomials through 4 th order (thereby extending conventional quadratic expansions), is compared to both the experimental spectrum and a standard Franck-Condon (adiabatic) simulation. The quartic H(d) is far superior to the quadratic H(d), reproducing the main features of the experimental spectrum and allowing for their subsequent assignment.

In this paper we explore, from first principles, the fundamental requirements for such system that tries to avoid interference to potential primary users of a band. We first show {{that in order to}} deliver real gains, cognitive radios must be able to detect undecodable signals. This is done by showing how to evaluate the tradeoff between secondary user power, available space for secondary operation, and interference protection for the primary receivers. We prove that in general, the performance of the optimal detector for detecting a weak unknown signal from a known zero-mean constellation is like that of the energy detector (radiometer). However we show that the presence of a known pilot signal can help greatly. We further motivate the need for pilot signals by showing that the radiometer is rendered useless by just moderate noise uncertainty. Finally, we show that quantization combined with noise uncertainty can make the detection of signals by any detector absolutely impossible below a certain SNR threshold...|$|E

A range of dyes incorporating the benzotriazole {{group has been}} specifically designed to achieve this and they have proved successful labels for obtaining very sensitive analysis. However, if the spectra were more fully understood, {{the differences between the}} Raman spectrum in solution and on the surface could provide unique structural information {{on the nature of the}} surface layer. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations the Raman and Infra-red (IR) spectra of the dye 3, 5 -dimethoxy- 4 -(6 ′-azobenzotriazolyl) -phenylamine (ABT-DMOPA) were assigned. A good correlation was found between the computed and experimental frequencies. Two competing isomers were compared and gave a largest error in fit for any clearly <b>assigned</b> <b>band</b> in the Raman spectrum of 41 cm− 1 and an overall fit error of 15 cm− 1. For the IR spectrum the largest error was 24 cm− 1 with an overall fit error of 8 cm− 1. Comparison of resonance Raman, SERS and SERRS spectra of the dye showed intensity changes which suggest the formation of a complex with silver on the surface.

40|$|PCR ribotyping is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used Clostridium difficile genotyping method, but its utility is limited by lack of stan-dardization. In this study, we analyzed four published whole genomes and tested an international collection of 21 well-charac-terized C. difficile ribotype 027 isolates as the basis for comparison of two capillary gel electrophoresis (CGE) -based ribotyping methods. There were unexpected differences between the 16 S- 23 S rRNA intergenic spacer region (ISR) allelic profiles of the four ribotype 027 genomes, but six bands were identified in all four and a seventh in three genomes. All seven bands and another, not identified in any of the whole genomes, were found in all 21 isolates. We compared sequencer-based CGE (SCGE) with three dif-ferent primer pairs to the Qiagen QIAxcel CGE (QCGE) platform. Deviations from individual reference/consensus band sizes were smaller for SCGE (0 to 0. 2 bp) than for QCGE (4. 2 to 9. 5 bp). Compared with QCGE, SCGEmore readily distinguished bands of similar length (more discriminatory), detected bands of larger size and lower intensity (more sensitive), and <b>assigned</b> <b>band</b> sizes more accurately and reproducibly, making it more suitable for standardization. Specifically, QCGE failed to identify the largest ISR amplicon. Based on several criteria, we recommend the primer set 16 S-USA/ 23 S-USA for use in a proposed stan-dard SCGEmethod.

30|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{simulated}} annealing approach {{to solve the}} spectrum assignment problem. It maximizes aggregated user utility while taking into account of the spectrum capacity constraint, interference constraint, and user requirement constraints. The algorithm incorporates a migration strategy into its solution space. It also provides differential treatments to different classes of traffics. The algorithm outperforms the random and the greedy hill climbing assignment approaches {{regardless of whether the}} network is congested or not. So far, our algorithm only considers when the network is underutilized due to either type-A or type-B white spaces or both. However, even when the spectrum is fully utilized, there are still ways to exploit it. Some traffic like e-mail, text messaging, or even streaming with adaptive coding has large tolerance in terms of their QoS requirements. So even when the spectrum is used to its full extent by a PU with flexible QoS demand, it is still possible for an SU with critical transmission to negotiate with this flexible PU to give up portion of his <b>assigned</b> <b>band.</b> Though the overall throughput is the same, the aggregated utility is improved. We call this spectrum trading. Incorporating spectrum trading into our algorithm will be a major extension to our work. Other possible extensions include making a spectrum band sharable by more than two users and making the interference matrix continuous instead of binary. Right now, a user has a universal utility function regardless of what band is assigned to him, but in reality, due to the difference in power consumption, signal quality, and other quality-of-service requirements, a user should have a different utility function for each spectrum band.|$|E
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / September 15 - 17, 1969 / Sheraton Park Hotel, Washington, D. C. Telemetry systems {{require the}} {{transmission}} of information in analog, sampled, and digital forms. There also are requirements for spectrum conservation, for minimum spurious transmission outside the <b>assigned</b> <b>band,</b> and for highest flexibility in multiplexing and in accepting {{a wide range of}} sensors. The paper describes the conceptual design of an advanced information transmission system that operates basically in the sampled mode, but that can accept analog inputs through an information compressing sampler or digital inputs by taking one sample of each input bit and making binary decisions in the receiver. The system uses three different encoding processes in an integrated manner. The first encoding process is performed by a redundancy reducing computer-like subsystem called the contractive encoder. Its purpose is to eliminate unnecessary samples while keeping the essential samples at their correct place on the time scale. Repetition of already transmitted samples. or the insertion of samples from other channels will fill the space of samples that have been removed. The second encoding process is performed by a distributive encoder. The purpose of this part of the information processor is the protection of the information against sudden pulsive disturbances. The distributive encoder spreads the information content of each sample over tens to hundreds of other samples in an ordered manner. If, during transmission, one sample or a group of samples is heavily mutilated by pulsive disturbances, the corresponding decoder in the receiver will recover most of the information of these mutilated samples from the other undisturbed samples while spreading the energy of the pulsive disturbances over all samples so that it contributes only a negligibly small error to any one of them. The third encoding process is performed by the modulative encoder. This device has the task of shaping the samples that are produced by the distributive encoder into bandlimited waveforms so that a noise-like, bandlimited composite transmission signal with a uniform spectral distribution is finally fed into the communication channel. Many adaptive features and the option to use a return channel for repetitions of blocks of samples give the system high stability, high efficiency, and low error ratio...|$|E
