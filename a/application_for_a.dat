5|$|With {{effect from}} 1 May 2011, it became {{possible}} {{to include an}} <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> declaration together with an application for one or more prerogative orders. However, the <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> declaration cannot be made unless the court grants leave for the prerogative orders to be applied for.|$|E
5|$|A {{declaration}} is a pronouncement {{by a court}} {{stating the}} legal position between the parties to an action, based on the facts that have been presented to the court. Before 1 May 2011, {{it was not possible}} to apply for prerogative orders and declarations in the same set of legal proceedings. Following that date, changes to Order 53 of the Rules of Court permitted an <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> declaration to be made together with an application for one or more prerogative orders. However, the <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> declaration cannot be made unless the court grants leave for the prerogative orders to be applied for.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{effective}} regulation of the <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> appeal review reflecting it {{from the point of}} its value background, historical development and the relevant case-law. With an intention to point out the necessary backing for the critical assessment of specific elements and the present form of the <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> appeal review in a civil procedure as a whole, the thesis deals with the theoretical basis of the legal remedies in the civil procedure and with the role of the <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> appeal review in their effective regulation. In the thesis, particular attention is paid to the purposes of the <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> appeal review, i. e. to the unification of the case-law and the protection of the rights of an individual in a particular case, as far as to their relation to the legal certainty resulting from the final decisions, which the use of the <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> appeal review undermines. The thesis contains the general conclusions on the relationship between these values and the conclusions on the appropriateness of the regulation of the particular elements of the <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> appeal review, which are connected with these values. A special chapter of this thesis deals with the history of the appeals focusing only on that facts and legal constructs, which are [...] ...|$|R

5|$|Various {{groups have}} {{expressed}} reservations about, and criticisms of, {{parts of the}} New England Quarter development or the scheme as a whole.

5|$|Biomedical {{researchers}} {{have examined the}} applications of rhodium compounds and their derivatives in medicine and reported one potential <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> rhodocene derivative as a radiopharmaceutical to treat small cancers. Rhodocene derivatives are used to synthesise linked metallocenes so that metal–metal interactions can be studied; potential applications of these derivatives include molecular electronics and research into the mechanisms of catalysis. The value of rhodocenes tends {{to be in the}} insights they provide into the bonding and dynamics of novel chemical systems, rather than their applications.|$|E

On 19 September 2008, Thamiselvan Karuppaya, an Indian real estate agent who wished to speak at Speakers' Corner {{about the use of}} Tamil on public signs, had to change his plans after being informed by the police that he required a permit as the topic of his speech was racially sensitive. A subsequent <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> permit was turned down.|$|E

5|$|McCall {{had also}} been busy in the {{transfer}} market during January, with the trio of Ben Starosta, Scott Loach and TJ Moncur all arriving on loan. Bullock made his loan permanent and signed an 18-month contract, and David Brown signed after impressing on a trial. Five players also left Valley Parade on loan deals during January, with Craig Bentham joining Farsley Celtic, Luke Medley joining Cambridge City, Sean Taylforth and Luke Morgan both going to Droylsden, and Simon Ainge joining Halifax Town. Goalkeeper Donovan Ricketts was also expected to leave but his transfer to Queens Park Rangers collapsed after the Home Office rejected his <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> work permit.|$|E

On 11 September 2014, Allam confirmed an appeal has been submitted to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. He also held a news conference confirming the club had been put up for sale due to the English FA's decision on 9 April 2014.|$|E
5|$|People who owe 3,800,000 Lebanese Pounds ($2,500) or more {{in child}} support, are not {{eligible}} to receive a Lebanese passport.

5|$|The CCRC finally {{rejected}} the application in April 2012 in a 109-page report, which said the submission had not identified any new evidence or legal argument that {{would raise the}} real possibility of the Court of Appeal overturning the conviction. In November 2012 the High Court turned down Bamber's <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> judicial review of that decision. The following year di Stefano was sentenced in the UK to 14 {{years in prison for}} having fraudulently presented himself as a lawyer. As of December 2013 Bamber's defence team was said to be preparing a fresh submission.|$|E

In April 1897, the committee held a public offering of shares in A/S Lierbanen.

5|$|Wagner's early {{correspondence}} with Meyerbeer, up to 1846, is cringingly obsequious. However, {{from the early}} 1840s, as Wagner developed Tannhäuser and Lohengrin, his ideas on opera increasingly diverged from Meyerbeerean standards; even in 1843 Wagner had written to Schumann condemning Meyerbeer's work as 'a striving after superficial popularity'. During 1846 Meyerbeer turned down Wagner's <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> loan of 1,200 thalers, and this may have marked a turning point.|$|E

However, this was overturned on appeal and a two-year extension granted {{for the use of the}} site.|$|E
5|$|An online {{petition}} {{was formed}} {{in response to the}} concerns raised about the planned mosque, calling on the Prime Minister to prevent the building of the mosque; the petition closed with over 250,000 signatures and was at the time the most signed petition on the site. Her Majesty's Government responded that the local planning authorities are responsible for general control of development in their areas and are required to take into consideration the views of interested persons and particularly local communities. In regard to this specific proposal, the government was informed by the Newham London Borough Council that there is neither a current planning permission or <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> mosque, nor is one expected in the near future. In September 2012, a planning application was submitted to Newham Council and is under consideration by them.|$|E
