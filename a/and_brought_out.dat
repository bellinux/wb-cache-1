25|$|In the 1960s jazz {{split into}} two fields. Dance bands like the Elite Swingsters were popular, while avant-garde jazz {{inspired}} {{by the work of}} John Coltrane, Thelonious Monk and Sonny Rollins was also common. The latter field of musicians included prominent activists and thinkers, including Hugh Masekela, Abdullah Ibrahim (formerly known as 'Dollar Brand'), Kippie Moeketsi, Sathima Bea Benjamin, Chris McGregor, Johnny Dyani and Jonas Gwangwa. In 1959, American pianist John Mehegan organised a recording session using many of the most prominent South African jazz musicians, resulting in the first two African jazz LPs. The following year saw the Cold Castle National Jazz Festival, which brought additional attention to South African jazz. Cold Castle became an annual event for a few years, <b>and</b> <b>brought</b> <b>out</b> more musicians, especially Dudu Pukwana, Gideon Nxumalo and Chris McGregor. The 1963 festival produced a LP called Jazz The African Sound, but government oppression soon ended the jazz scene. Again, many musicians emigrated or went into exile in the UK or other countries.|$|E
25|$|Heseltine and Labovitch also {{founded the}} {{magazine}} publishing company Cornmarket, <b>and</b> <b>brought</b> <b>out</b> Directory of Opportunities for School Leavers and Directory of Opportunities for Qualified Men, which earned a steady income from advertising. Canadian, French and German versions were also launched, although these were less profitable. In late 1959, using £10,000 of a £30,000 profit on selling a freehold site off Regents Park, they acquired the famous (but unprofitable) magazine Man About Town whose title was shortened to About Town then simply Town. In 1962, they paid £10,000 for Topic, a weekly newspaper {{which had been}} launched in 1961 {{by a group of}} entrepreneurs including the Prime Minister's son Maurice Macmillan, and which was now owned by Norman Mascall (a pyramid scheme fraudster of the era). By then the economic climate was too difficult, and like many publishers they found that there is limited appetite for weekly papers in the UK. Topic ceased publication at the end of 1962, but its journalists later became The Sunday Times Insight Team.|$|E
25|$|On February 21, 2013 CMLL held a {{press conference}} to officially {{announce}} that the Homena a Dos Leyendas would pay tribute to Rayo de Jalisco ("The Lighting from Jalisco") <b>and</b> <b>brought</b> <b>out</b> Rayo's son, Rayo de Jalisco Jr., as part of the announcement. Rayo de Jalisco Jr. had not worked for CMLL since 2010 but made a special appearance due to the company honoring his father. During the press conference Rayo de Jalisco Jr.'s long time rival Universo 2000 interrupted Rayo de Jalisco Jr. and the two ended up challenging each other to a match that would take place at the 2013 Homenaje a Dos Leyendas, although the exact nature of the match was not announced at the time. The rivalry between the two wrestlers hailed back to at least 1997 where Universo 2000 defeated both Cien Caras and Rayo de Jalisco Jr. to win the CMLL World Heavyweight Championship. Universo 2000 defended the title three times during his reign: against Brazo de Plata, Máscara Sagrada, and Rayo de Jalisco Jr., before losing the championship to Rayo de Jalisco Jr. on September 13, 1998. Universo 2000 regained the title on December 10, 1999 Universo 2000's second reign became a recordbreaking reign in several areas, it was the longest to date as it lasted 1,225 days. He also became the champion with most successful title defenses in one reign including eight defenses against Rayo de Jalisco Jr. during their long running rivalry. After being masked since his debut in 1985 Universo 2000 lost a Lucha de Apuesta match to El Canek in the main event of the 71st Anniversary Show, on September 17, 2004, the match also included Rayo de Jalisco Jr. and Dr. Wagner Jr. and originally came about due to the Universo 2000/Rayo de Jalisco Jr. rivalry. Following his unmasking Universo 2000 won the 2004 Leyenda de Azul (Blue legend tournament). In subsequent years both Universo 2000 and Rayo de Jalisco Jr. left CMLL. In 2005 Rayo de Jalisco Jr. suffered another serious injury, he injured both his knees in a match against Universo 2000's brother Máscara Año 2000, where his legs got caught on the ropes as he jumped out of the ring and he tore ligaments in both knees. The injury kept him out of the ring for almost half a year but in the end Rayo de Jalisco Jr. was able to make a full recovery and return to the ring. The incident was used by several promoters as well as Rayo de Jalisco Jr. himself to create more interest in matches between himself and Universo 2000, Cien Caras and Máscara Año 2000. Rayo de Jalisco Jr. made his return to CMLL in May, 2010, siding with the CMLL loyalists in their feud with Los Invasores, especially Invasore members Universo 2000 and Máscara Año 2000, reiginting the long running storyline between them. But Rayo, Universo and Cien Caras only worked a select few dates for CMLL before leaving again. The official match between the long time rivals saw each team up with participants of the 2013 Torneo Parejas Increibles, only in this case they were on opposite sides instead of teaming up. Rayo de Jalisco Jr. would team up with Shocker and Rush while Universo 2000 would team up with Shocker's rival Mr. Niebla and Rush's rival El Terrible. Shocker and Mr. Niebla had a long backstory between then, having actually worked together as a regular tag team in the late 1990s. In 1998 the two defeated Dr. Wagner Jr. and Emilio Charles Jr. to win the CMLL World Tag Team Championship and would subsequently defend the tag team championship against teams such as Blue Panther and Black Warrior, Bestia Salvaje and Scorpio Jr. and the Hermanas Dinamita (Cien Caras and Universo 2000). In October, 1998 Mr. Niebla suffered an injury during a match, an injury that was so severe that Mr. Niebla was forced to vacate the Tag Team title. Upon his return Mr. Niebla continued to team with Shocker but the team were not able to win the Tag Team title back. On September 24, 1999, at the CMLL 66th Anniversary Show, the team of Nr. Niebla and Shocker faced Atlantis and Villano III in a Relevos suicida match, a match where the losing team would fight each other for their mask. In the main event match of CMLL's 66th Anniversary show, Atlantis and Villano III defeated the much less experienced team, afterwards Mr. Niebla defeated Shocker to unmask him. In the years since Shocker's unmasking the two have wrestled each other on numerous occasions, both in CMLL and other promotions. The two teamed up for the Parejas Increibles tournament and made it to the semi-final but lost to La Sombra and Volador Jr. when the tension between the two became a distraction in the match. The rivalry between Rush and El Terrible started when El Terrible defeated Rush in the finals of a tournament to determine a holder of the CMLL World Heavyweight Championship on January 1, 2012. The two were also paired up for the 2012 Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increibles, and in {{the weeks leading up to}} the tournament Rush stated that he was willing to put his differences with El Terrible aside as he wanted to win the Parejas Increibles tournament, despite the two having developed a heated rivalry over the last number of months. After getting along and qualifying for the final match Rush and El Terrible's miscommunication and dissension allowed their opponents to win the match and the tournament. Following the match Rush took a microphone and berated both El Terrible and the fans for their actions that night and then followed it up by challenging El Terrible to a Luchas de Apuestas, hair vs. hair match at a later date. El Terrible did not accept the challenge at that point in time. The two faced off in the main event of the CMLL 79th Anniversary Show in a Lucha de Apuestas, hair vs. hair match that was won by Rush. The storyline continued to develop in the months following the anniversary event and included El Terrible successfully defending the CMLL World Heavyweight Championship against Rush on January 22, 2013. The two rivals were simply unable to get along from the beginning, causing them to be eliminated in the first round of the Parejas Increibles tournament by Dragón Rojo Jr. and Niebla Roja.|$|E

In later life, Maylam focused his attentions on exploring his family history, privately publishing Maylam Family Records in 1932, before dying in 1939. In the century following his death, Maylam's book on hoodening became difficult to obtain and expensive to purchase, and so to mark the centenary of its first publication, it was republished under the altered title of The Kent Hooden Horse in 2009 by The History Press. Writing an introductory article for the second publication, Doel, a specialist in Kentish folklore, praised Maylam's book as a [...] "classic study" [...] which was [...] "impressive for its separation of fact from speculation as to the origins and significance of the custom." ...|$|E

It was there that he died in his sleep {{on the night of}} 28–29 November 1957. He had arranged for some of his letters and books to be destroyed, while others were to be sent to the Bodleian Library, with the proviso that some of them would not be opened until the year 2000. His body was buried in the church graveyard at Nursling. In accordance with his instructions, the title [...] "Editor of Antiquity" [...] was inscribed on his gravestone, reflecting his desire to be remembered primarily as an archaeologist.
