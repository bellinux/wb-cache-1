5|$|Although Nash {{would claim}} that he was never prouder than {{when he was a}} soldier, <b>always</b> <b>wore</b> his Returned Services League (RSL) badge and eagerly {{attended}} reunions of the 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion, he never marched on Anzac Day or applied for the campaign medals for which he was eligible.|$|E
5|$|Hungary {{was divided}} into three parts: Ottoman Hungary - {{a part of the}} Ottoman Empire, Royal Hungary - ruled by Mary's brother Ferdinand, and Eastern Hungarian Kingdom - ruled by John Zápolya. Ferdinand was elected King of Bohemia. Mary took a vow to never remarry and <b>always</b> <b>wore</b> the {{heart-shaped}} medallion worn by her husband in the fatal Battle of Mohács.|$|E
5|$|However, this outward {{dullness}} concealed a sharp {{mind and}} great administrative talent. He operated mainly {{behind the scenes}} and cultivated {{an image of a}} colourless bureaucrat – for example, he was the only Bolshevik leader who <b>always</b> <b>wore</b> a suit and tie. In 1928 Molotov replaced Nikolai Uglanov as First Secretary of the Moscow Communist Party and held that position until 15 August 1929. In a lengthy address to the Central Committee in 1929, Molotov told the members the Soviet government would initiate a compulsory collectivisation campaign to solve the agrarian backwardness of Soviet agriculture.|$|E

5|$|In January 1953, Plante {{was called}} up {{to play for the}} Canadiens. Bill Durnan, the goaltender who played for Montreal when Plante first began, had retired, and Gerry McNeil—their top goaltender—had {{fractured}} his jaw. Plante played for three games, but in that short time, he generated controversy. Coach Dick Irvin, Sr. did not wish his players to stand out by any addition to their regular uniforms. Plante <b>always</b> <b>wore</b> one of his tuques while playing hockey, and after an argument with Irvin, all of Plante's tuques had vanished from the Montreal locker room. Even without his good luck charm, Plante gave up only four goals in the three games he played, all of them wins.|$|E
25|$|Gretzky {{requested}} to wear # 9 for his idol Gordie Howe, but that number was already taken by teammate Brian Gualazzi. Gretzky then chose # 14 instead. After a few games, coach Muzz MacPherson suggested wearing two nines {{would be better}} than one. From that season on, Gretzky <b>always</b> <b>wore</b> the legendary # 99.|$|E
25|$|Rutten {{was born}} in Tilburg, Netherlands. At the age of 6 he {{developed}} eczema and severe asthma. Bas' eczema meant he <b>always</b> <b>wore</b> long sleeves, turtle necks and gloves, and his asthma meant {{he was unable to}} partake in exercise, and was consequently relatively skinny. He was bullied on a daily basis as a kid.|$|E

25|$|The Kaifeng Jews intermarried {{with local}} Chinese {{sufficiently}} to be indistinguishable in appearance from their non-Jewish neighbors. One trait that differentiated {{them from their}} neighbors was not eating pork. Qu Yinan, a Chinese woman who discovered her Jewish ancestry after her mother attended a conference on minorities in 1981, says her family did not eat pork or shellfish and her grandfather <b>always</b> <b>wore</b> a blue skullcap.|$|E
25|$|They {{were both}} long and thin, and Ber <b>always</b> <b>wore</b> dandy silk socks - {{he was not}} in the least like a parson to look at. A man with ideals that he lived up to-he was big - hearted enough to {{understand}} anyone and had it in him to enjoy vulgar fun as much as any. After we became intimate we often went to stay with the Walkes at St Hilary, as simple as any monastery in its furnishings.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} revolutionary {{products}} {{to come out on}} the market was the company's disposable Pampers diaper, first test-marketed in 1961, the same year Procter & Gamble came out with Head & Shoulders. Prior to this point, disposable diapers were not popular, although Johnson & Johnson had developed a product called Chux. Babies <b>always</b> <b>wore</b> cloth diapers, which were leaky and labor-intensive to wash. Pampers provided a convenient alternative, albeit at the environmental cost of more waste requiring landfilling.|$|E

25|$|His simple origins {{became clear}} right after his election, when {{he wore a}} {{pectoral}} cross made of gilded metal {{on the day of}} his coronation and when his entourage was horrified, the new pope complained that he <b>always</b> <b>wore</b> it and that he had brought no other with him. He was well known for cutting down on papal ceremonies. He also abolished the custom of the pope dining alone, which had been established by Pope Urban VIII, and invited his friends to eat with him.|$|E
25|$|When {{asked about}} his religion, Armstrong would answer that he was raised a Baptist, <b>always</b> <b>wore</b> a Star of David, and was friends with the Pope. Armstrong wore the Star of David {{in honor of the}} Karnofsky family, who took him in as a child and lent him the money to buy his first cornet. Louis Armstrong was, in fact, baptized as a Catholic at the Sacred Heart of Jesus Church in New Orleans, and he met popes Pius XII and Paul VI, though there is no {{evidence}} that he considered himself Catholic. Armstrong seems to have been tolerant towards various religions, but also found humor in them.|$|E
25|$|He {{was known}} on cricket grounds {{all over the}} country, being {{recognisable}} by the red carnation that he <b>always</b> <b>wore.</b> His memories of cricket went {{back as far as}} 1878, when as a small boy he was taken to the Gentlemen of England v. the Australians match at Prince's Cricket Ground. He first went to Lord's in 1880, when he met W. G. Grace. Later that season he watched the first Test match to be played in England, at The Oval. He attended no fewer than seventy of the annual Oxford v. Cambridge games. He was an enthusiastic statistician but a somewhat inaccurate one, a fact noted by Plum Warner in Sir Home's obituary.|$|E

25|$|On 18 February 1853, Franz Joseph survived an {{assassination}} attempt by Hungarian nationalist János Libényi. The emperor was taking a stroll {{with one of his}} officers, Count Maximilian Karl Lamoral O'Donnell of Tír Chonaill, on a city bastion, when Libényi approached him. He immediately struck the emperor from behind with a knife straight at the neck. Franz Joseph almost <b>always</b> <b>wore</b> a uniform, which had a high collar that almost completely enclosed the neck. The collars of uniforms at that time were made from very sturdy material, precisely to counter this kind of attack. Even though the Emperor was wounded and bleeding, the collar saved his life. Count O'Donnell struck Libényi down with his sabre.|$|E
25|$|Midnight Sun – an African child named M'Nai {{adopted by}} Fu Manchu, and raised {{alongside}} his son Shang-Chi. Fu Manchu {{impressed with his}} stoic nature trained {{him as one of}} the Si-Fan his elite assassins. Due to his badly disfigured face he <b>always</b> <b>wore</b> a mask, he was mute due to the attack that scarred his face. because they were equally skilled Fu Manchu sent him to kill Shnag Chi after Shang refused to assassinate James Petrie. Midnight {{died as a result of}} their second battle, but was later resurrected by the Kree in cloned body and gifted with cosmic powers strong enough to challenge the Silver Surfer. After a couple of battles with the Surfer he settled down to a peaceful life in the Blue Area of the Moon where he was accepted by the Inhumans.|$|E
25|$|He was a {{tall and}} bulky person with a {{prominent}} stomach and invariably played with a clean shaven head without any hat or cap {{or any kind of}} head gear. He <b>always</b> <b>wore</b> very loose pants and after batting for a while or keeping wicket for sometime his shirt will be hanging out of the trousers and somebody must tuck it in, now and then. He had a rather ugly and uncouth stance at the wicket as he held his bat very low and bent his body forward so much that his head was practically in line with the top of the wickets. Those who watched him from the on side could only see his prominent hind portion of the body sticking up while the head, bat and the rest of Dilawar Hussain were hardly visible. However, he had a very sound defense and so {{it was very difficult to}} get him out. He was the most selfish batsman that I have ever seen.|$|E

25|$|Ford was {{renowned for}} his intense {{personality}} and his many idiosyncrasies and eccentricities. From the early Thirties onwards, he <b>always</b> <b>wore</b> dark {{glasses and a}} patch over his left eye, which was only partly to protect his poor eyesight. He was an inveterate pipe-smoker {{and while he was}} shooting he would chew on a linen handkerchief—each morning his wife would give him a dozen fresh handkerchiefs, {{but by the end of}} a day's filming the corners of all of them would be chewed to shreds. He always had music played on the set and would routinely break for tea (Earl Grey) at mid-afternoon every day during filming. He discouraged chatter and disliked bad language on set; its use, especially in front of a woman, would typically result in the offender being thrown off the production. He rarely drank during the making of a film, but when a production wrapped he would often lock himself in his study, wrapped only in a sheet, and go on a solitary drinking binge for several days, followed by routine contrition and a vow never to drink again. He was extremely sensitive to criticism and was always particularly angered by any comparison between his work and that of his older brother Francis. He rarely attended premieres or award ceremonies, although his Oscars and other awards were proudly displayed on the mantel in his home.|$|E
500|$|Nowotny quickly {{recovered}} from his ordeal and on 31July claimed a Beriev MBR-2 flying boat north-west of Saaremaa and an Ilyushin DB-3 bomber {{south of the}} island. For {{the rest of his}} combat career, Nowotny <b>always</b> <b>wore</b> the trousers (German: Abschußhose roughly [...] "shoot down pants" [...] sometimes also referred to as [...] "victory pants") that he had worn during those three days in the Gulf of Riga – with one exception, his last sortie, at Achmer on 8November1944, when he was killed flying the Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighter.|$|E
500|$|Despite the band's [...] "gospel" [...] and [...] "ad-libbed" [...] {{approach}} to recording, the Make-Up's live performances were often quite structured, {{as opposed to}} the typical [...] "jam session". [...] Svenonius explained that [...] "there's a skeleton that we create and the form of our shows is unchanging - there's an intro, an outro, a middle break. It's very vaudevillian in form". [...] The Make-Up <b>always</b> <b>wore</b> matching uniforms on stage. [...] Like most of the Make-Up's identity, the uniforms were an ideological statement, meant to [...] " [...] individualism. Instead of there being this person [...] this member, and them having their separate personalities, or having them as separate entities. [...] We're trying to create a unification. A one-ness. That's basically what it is: they're uniforms".|$|E
