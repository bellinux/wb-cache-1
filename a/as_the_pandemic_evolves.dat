Here, we subjected a recombinant virus (rH 1 N 1) with the same constellation makeup <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>pandemic</b> H 1 N 1 / 2009 virus to nine serial passages in pigs. The severity of infection sequentially increased with each passage. Deep sequencing of viral quasispecies from the ninth passage found five consensus amino acid mutations: PB 1 A 469 T, PA 1129 T, NA N 329 D, NS 1 N 205 K, and NEP T 48 N. Mutations in the hemagglutinin (HA) protein, however, differed greatly between {{the upper and lower}} respiratory tracts. Three representative viral clones with the five consensus mutations were selected for functional evaluation. Relative to the parental virus, the three viral clones showed enhanced replication and polymerase activity in vitro and enhanced replication, pathogenicity, and transmissibility in pigs, guinea pigs, and ferrets in vivo. Specifically, two mutants of rH 1 N 1 (PB 1 A 469 T and a combination of NS 1 N 205 K and NEP T 48 N) were identified as determinants of transmissibility in guinea pigs.

40|$|S Supporting Information ABSTRACT: Influenza virus infections lead to {{numerous}} deaths {{and millions of}} hospitalizations each year. One challenge facing anti-influenza drug development is the heterogeneity of the circulating influenza viruses, which comprise several strains with variable susceptibility to antiviral drugs. For example, the wild-type (WT) influenza A viruses, such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> seasonal H 1 N 1, tend {{to be sensitive to}} antiviral drugs, amantadine and rimantadine, while the S 31 N mutant viruses, such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>pandemic</b> 2009 H 1 N 1 (H 1 N 1 pdm 09) and seasonal H 3 N 2, are resistant to this class of drugs. Thus, drugs targeting both WT and the S 31 N mutant are highly desired. We report our design of a novel class of dual inhibitors along with their ion channel blockage and antiviral activities. The potency of the most active compound 11 in inhibiting WT and the S 31 N mutant influenza viruses is comparable with that of amantadine in inhibitin...|$|R

Exploratory factor analysis in the form of principal component analysis, Cronbach alpha and correlation were respectively employed to assess scale simplification and summarization, scale internal consistency and relationship among variables. Result indicates that even as broadcast media campaigns and information is likely to influence behavioural change of Ebonyians, this impact is not traceable to the broadcast media campaigns/programmes of the EBOSACA. This paper and its finding was identified as indeed fundamental as previous researchers have conducted less research on the impact of broadcast media campaigns/programmes on the variables explored in this research and with evidence of lack of substantive empirical study on the subject within Non-western developing economy like Nigeria.

40|$|AbstractThe Global Action Plan (GAP) for Influenza Vaccines is {{a decade-long}} {{initiative}} that brings together a {{diverse range of}} stakeholders to work towards reducing anticipated global shortage of influenza vaccines and ensuring more equitable access to vaccines during <b>the</b> next influenza <b>pandemic.</b> Since its inception in 2006, significant {{progress has been made}} towards all the main objectives of GAP, namely: (1) an increase in seasonal vaccine use, (2) an increase in vaccine production, and (3) progress in research and development of more effective vaccines. The Technology Transfer Initiative (TTI), conceived and managed by WHO under the GAP, contributed to increasing regional influenza vaccine production capacity. This was achieved by facilitating technology transfer in 14 low- and middle-income countries, through grants to manufacturers to establish or strengthen influenza vaccine production capacity and support to their national regulatory authorities. Five of the countries subsequently licensed locally produced influenza vaccines; two pandemic and three seasonal vaccines received WHO prequalification. The success of GAP can be largely attributed to the regulatory support provided by WHO to both manufacturers and regulators. This support had two components: (1) direct regulatory support to GAP/TTI, and (2) support to GAP-related WHO programmes, such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pandemic</b> Influenza Vaccine Deployment Initiative in 2010 and <b>the</b> <b>Pandemic</b> Influenza Preparedness Framework since 2013, especially in non-vaccine-producing countries.

Currently, {{the absence of a}} global overview of the phenotypic and molecular characteristics of pandemic strains restricts our overall understanding of these strains, especially for environmental strains. To generate a global picture of the sero-prevalence and genetic diversity of pandemic V. parahaemolyticus, pandemic isolates from worldwide collections were selected and analyzed in this study. After a thorough analysis, we found that <b>the</b> <b>pandemic</b> isolates represented 49 serotypes, which are widely distributed in 22 countries across four continents (Asia, Europe, America and Africa). All of these serotypes were detected in clinical isolates but only nine in environmental isolates. O 3 :K 6 was the most widely disseminated serotype, followed by O 3 :KUT, while the others were largely restricted to certain countries. The countries with <b>the</b> most abundant <b>pandemic</b> serotypes were China (26 serotypes), India (24 serotypes), Thailand (15 serotypes) and Vietnam (10 serotypes). Based on MLST analysis, fourteen sequence types (STs) were identified among <b>the</b> <b>pandemic</b> strains, nine of which fell within clonal complex (CC) 3. ST 3 and ST 305 were the only two STs that have been reported in environmental pandemic strains. Pandemic ST 3 has caused a wide range of infections in as many as sixteen countries. Substantial serotypic diversity was mainly observed among isolates within pandemic ST 3, including as many as 12 combinations of O/K serotypes. At the allele level, the dtdS and pntA, two loci that perfectly conserved in CC 3, displayed a degree of polymorphism in some pandemic strains. In conclusion, we provide a comprehensive understanding of sero-prevalence and genetic differentiation of clinical and environmental pandemic isolates collected from around the world.
