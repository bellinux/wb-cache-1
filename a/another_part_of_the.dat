5|$|Monument 217 is <b>another</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cargador del Ancestro sculpture. It was {{embedded}} in the east face of Structure 7A in the same manner, {{and at the same}} time, as Monument 215.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> book {{consists}} <b>of</b> some of Adams' blog {{posts and}} entries.

5|$|Coronary artery {{bypass surgery}} {{is one such}} operation. In this operation, one or more arteries {{surrounding}} the heart that have become narrowed are bypassed. This is done by taking blood vessels harvested from <b>another</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body. Commonly harvested veins include the saphenous veins or the internal mammary artery. Because this operation involves the heart tissue, a machine is used so that blood can bypass the heart during the operation.|$|E
5|$|I-270 was {{constructed}} in several phases, beginning with a section from I-70 to Vasquez Boulevard. Following this section was <b>another</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> freeway from Vasquez Boulevard west to I-76, and finally a section from US36 to I-76. This last segment has undergone much more construction, including new bridges and ramps at interchanges.|$|E

5|$|In 1996, the underwire of a girl's bra {{helped save}} her life when she was impaled on a railing and, {{according}} to hospital personnel, the underwire from her bra probably helped deflect the spike from her heart. There have been multiple incidents where bullets were deflected by the underwire of a woman's bra, either keeping her entirely from harm, or directing the bullet away from the heart to <b>another</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, a beehive metal {{sculpture}} by Thompson Dagnall in Hyde, Greater Manchester, was {{criticized by the}} council for installment adjacent to the children’s play area in Hyde park for looking too rude and phallic. Although Dagnall was paid £3,500 a week for his efforts, council workers modified the structure by stumping it and moved it to <b>another</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> park.|$|E
5|$|In the engagement, the U.S. forces {{attempted}} to encircle and destroy Shōji's forces. Although Shōji's unit took heavy casualties, he {{and most of}} his men were able to evade the encirclement attempt and escape into the interior of Guadalcanal. As Shōji's troops endeavored to reach Japanese positions in <b>another</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> island, they were pursued and attacked by a battalion-sized patrol of U.S. Marine Raiders.|$|E

5|$|On 2 August 1944, the SS {{cleared the}} Gypsy camp. A witness in <b>another</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> camp later {{told of the}} Gypsies unsuccessfully battling the SS with improvised weapons before being loaded into trucks. The {{surviving}} population (estimated at 2,897 to 5,600) was then killed en masse in the gas chambers. The murder of the Romani people by the Nazis during World War II is known in the Romani language as the Porajmos (devouring).|$|E
5|$|The Crusaders' main home {{ground was}} the 36,000-capacity AMI Stadium in Christchurch. However, they stopped playing {{there during the}} 2011 Super Rugby season due to damage inflicted by the February Christchurch earthquake. The Crusaders usually took one game each year to <b>another</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{franchise}} area, most often when the New Zealand cricket team was playing at AMI Stadium. Previous venues included Trafalgar Park in Nelson, and Alpine Energy Stadium in Timaru.|$|E
5|$|The {{next day}} (28 November), the French Emperor {{requested}} a personal interview with Alexander I {{and received a}} visit from the Tsar's most impetuous aide, Count Dolgorouki. The meeting was <b>another</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trap, as Napoleon intentionally expressed anxiety and hesitation to his opponents. Dolgorouki reported to the Tsar an additional indication of French weakness.|$|E

50|$|Statistics for 1944 show between 546,000 and 700,000 Leningradians {{who managed}} to undergo <b>the</b> hardships <b>of</b> <b>the</b> blockade. After the siege was lifted, the {{evacuees}} were allowed to return, but <b>the</b> main source <b>of</b> renewal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population <b>of</b> Leningrad in <b>the</b> post-war years was <b>the</b> influx from <b>another</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union. Only in 1957-1958, or 18-19 years after 1939 when the 3-million citizen was born, the city managed to surpass this population mark again. 12 years later, in 1969-1970 the population reached 4 million, and in 1988-1989 — 5 million.|$|R
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 5th Division had {{gathered}} unseen below Courtnay's Post, {{which was held}} by the 14th Battalion, and at 04:00 they rushed the trench, throwing hand grenades. The post was only defended by an Australian section, two of whom were killed and another two wounded; as the Turks occupied {{that part of the}} post the surviving Australians retreated. The Turks were now in a position to observe and bring fire down on Monash Valley. However, from another section of the post Private Albert Jacka led a small group of men in a counter-attack on the Turks. Jacka shot five of the Turks, bayoneted another two, and chased the rest out of the post. For this feat he was awarded the Victoria Cross.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> machine's {{exhibition}} was {{the completion of}} the knight's tour, a famed chess puzzle. The puzzle requires the player to move a knight around a chessboard, touching each square once along the way. While most experienced chess players of the time still struggled with the puzzle, the Turk was capable of completing the tour without any difficulty from any starting point via a pegboard used by the director with a mapping of the puzzle laid out.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 2000, MDOT {{proposed}} several highway transfers in Detroit. Some {{of these}} involved transferring city streets in the Campus Martius Park area under the department's jurisdiction to city control; <b>another</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proposal involved MDOT assuming control over a section of Fort Street from the then northern terminus of M-85 to the then southern terminus of M-3 at Clark Street. When these transfers were completed the following year, M-3 was severed into two discontinuous segments by the Campus Martius changes, and the southern segment between Clark and Griswold streets was added to an extended M-85.|$|E

5|$|Dobroselova {{considers}} {{moving to}} <b>another</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city {{where she can}} work as a governess. Just as {{he is out of}} money and risks being evicted, Devushkin has a stroke of luck: his boss takes pity on him and gives him 100 rubles to buy new clothes. Devushkin pays off his debts and sends some to Dobroselova. She sends him 25 rubles back because she does not need it. The future looks bright for both of them because he can now start to save money and it may be possible for them to move in together.|$|E
5|$|In September 1937 the German {{government}} again {{requested that}} Lody's body be exhumed {{and moved to}} a separate grave. This proved impractical for several reasons; he had been buried with seven other men, each coffin had been cemented down and the lapse of time would make identification very difficult. Instead, the British Imperial War Graves Commission suggested that a memorial should be constructed in <b>another</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cemetery to bear the names of all the German civilians who were buried there. The proposal met with German agreement and the memorial was duly installed. During the Second World War, Lody's original headstone was destroyed by misaimed Luftwaffe bombs. It was replaced in 1974.|$|E
5|$|Once {{secretory}} proteins are formed, the ER membrane separates {{them from}} the proteins that {{will remain in the}} cytosol. Secretory proteins depart from the ER enfolded in the membranes of vesicles that bud like bubbles from the transitional ER. These vesicles in transit to <b>another</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cell are called transport vesicles. An alternative mechanism for transport of lipids and proteins out of the ER are through lipid transfer proteins at regions called membrane contact sites where the ER becomes closely and stably associated with the membranes of other organelles, such as the plasma membrane, Golgi or lysosomes.|$|E
