5|$|Normal {{blood flow}} is {{anterograde}} (going to the heart), and from superficial to deep veins via perforator veins. However, {{there are two}} exceptions: firstly, the great saphenous vein (GSV) collaterals, (the veins that run parallel), drain the <b>abdominal</b> <b>wall</b> and have a flow {{from top to bottom}} so that when an examiner tests the sapheno-femoral junction, a false positive diagnosis might be made; secondly, in the flow from the sole of the foot venous network around 10% drains to the dorsal venous arch of the foot, going therefore against the norm, from deep to superficial veins.|$|E
5|$|Redback spider bites are {{difficult}} to diagnose in pets unless witnessed. Dogs appear to have some resistance. They are at serious risk only if bitten many times, and rarely need antivenom. Cats {{are likely to be}} more susceptible and require antivenom, which can reverse symptoms very quickly. Guinea pigs, horses and camels are very susceptible. As with humans, the symptoms are predominantly autonomic in nature alongside pain at the bite site. Dogs may also suffer vomiting and diarrhoea, muscle tremors or clonic contractions, and <b>abdominal</b> <b>wall</b> rigidity, while cats may salivate excessively, protrude their tongue or be overexcitable.|$|E
5|$|Abdominal {{segments}} 3–6 and 10 each bear {{a pair of}} {{legs that}} are more fleshy. The thoracic legs are known as true legs and the abdominal legs are called prolegs. The true legs vary little in the Lepidoptera except for reduction in certain leaf-miners and elongation in the family Notodontidae. The prolegs contain {{a number of small}} hooks on the tip, which are known as crochets. The families of Lepidoptera differ in the number and positioning of their prolegs. Some larvae such as inchworms (Geometridae) and loopers (Plusiinae) have five pairs of prolegs or less, while others like Lycaenidae and slug caterpillars (Limacodidae) lack prolegs altogether. In some leaf-mining caterpillars there are crochets present on the <b>abdominal</b> <b>wall</b> which are reduced prolegs, while other leaf-mining species lack the crochets entirely. The abdominal spiracles are located {{on each side of the}} body on the first eight abdominal segments.|$|E

5|$|The lungs {{of mammals}} are spongy and honeycombed. Breathing is mainly {{achieved}} with the diaphragm, which divides the thorax from the abdominal cavity, forming a dome convex to the thorax. Contraction of the diaphragm flattens the dome, increasing {{the volume of}} the lung cavity. Air enters through the oral and nasal cavities, and travels through the larynx, trachea and bronchi, and expands the alveoli. Relaxing the diaphragm has the opposite effect, decreasing {{the volume of the}} lung cavity, causing air to be pushed out of the lungs. During exercise, the <b>abdominal</b> <b>wall</b> contracts, increasing pressure on the diaphragm, which forces air out quicker and more forcefully. The rib cage is able to expand and contract the chest cavity through the action of other respiratory muscles. Consequently, air is sucked into or expelled out of the lungs, always moving down its pressure gradient. This type of lung is known as a bellows lung due to its resemblance to blacksmith bellows.|$|E

50|$|Since the <b>abdominal</b> <b>walls</b> weaken with age, direct hernias tend {{to occur}} in the middle-aged and elderly.

25|$|The {{technique}} of the MS-TRAM flap {{is similar to}} the {{technique of}} the DIEAP flap, but the MS-TRAM flap is used if the perforators of the <b>abdominal</b> <b>wall</b> are located in different intramuscular layers and the muscle fibres between these vessels would need to be divided. This gives damage to the rectus muscle, necessitating a reinforcing mesh repair and causing higher chance of postoperative complications such as <b>abdominal</b> <b>wall</b> weakness, bulging or herniation. In this situation the MS-TRAM flap is performed, in which a small cuff of muscle fibres between and around the perforators is incorporated.|$|E

30|$|The {{peritoneum}} {{is one of}} {{the largest}} organs in humans with a surface of some 10.000  cm 2. It serves to minimise friction and facilitate free movement of abdominal viscera, to resist and localise infections and to store fat, especially in the greater omentum. It forms a closed sac in males and an open sac in females, lining the <b>abdominal</b> <b>walls</b> (parietal peritoneum) and the viscera (visceral peritoneum). It is composed of a continuous layer of mesothelial cells and a layer of loose connective tissue [8].|$|R
50|$|The swimbladder has two {{anterior}} extensions {{that arise}} medially, diverge and terminate. Two lateral extensions appear anteriorally, {{each with a}} blind tubule which curves to the <b>abdominal</b> <b>walls</b> and becomes a complex network of blind tubules. There are two posterior tapering extensions that project into and terminate into the caudal region. A duct like process is present from the lateral surface to the urogenital opening.

40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{reported}} that fetuses with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and infants with low birth weight present increased intima/media thickness (aIMT) of the <b>abdominal</b> aorta <b>wall</b> compared with fetuses and infants appropriate for gestational age (AGA). Evidence suggested that aIMT {{might be related to}} inflammation, probably indicating a very early stage of future adulthood disease, such as atherosclerosis. We aimed to investigate histological findings in the <b>abdominal</b> aorta <b>wall</b> of one IUGR stillbirth in which ultrasound had detected aIMT. Microscopy observations of the <b>abdominal</b> aorta <b>wall</b> confirmed the intima thickening and detected condensation of the elastic fibers forming an evident internal elastic membrane and presence of inflammatory elements, such as macrophages, activated endothelial cells, and fibroblastoid cells. The present study highlights that IUGR associated with aIMT is related to inflammation, which might represent a very early sign of future adult lesions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

40|$|SUMMARY A 21 -year-old {{woman with}} long-standing {{systemic}} lupus erythematosus developed extensive calcification of the soft tissues of the thoracic and <b>abdominal</b> <b>walls</b> and extremities early in her illness, and these calcifications gradually disappeared {{over the course of}} her disease. The extent of this calcinosis and apparent spontaneous regression are unusual events in {{systemic lupus erythematosus}}. Soft tissue calcification is commonly associated with progressive systemic sclerosis and with dermatomyo-sitis (Muller et al., 1959 a, b). It is less commonly found in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Only few cases of SLE with associated soft tissue calcification have been reported (Keats, 1961...|$|R
5000|$|The foregut is the {{anterior}} {{part of the}} alimentary canal, from the mouth to the duodenum {{at the entrance of}} the bile duct, and is attached to the <b>abdominal</b> <b>walls</b> by mesentery. The foregut develops from the folding primitive gut, and is developmentally distinct from the midgut and hindgut. Although the term “foregut” is typically used in reference to {{the anterior}} section of the primitive gut, components of the adult gut can also be described with this designation. Pain in the epigastric region, just below the intersection of the ribs, typically refers to structures in the adult foregut.|$|R
25|$|Males {{have two}} {{testicles}} of similar size {{contained within the}} scrotum, which {{is an extension of}} the <b>abdominal</b> <b>wall.</b> Scrotal asymmetry is not unusual: one testicle extends further down into the scrotum than the other due to differences in the anatomy of the vascululature.|$|E
25|$|Umbilical hernia* is {{a failure}} of the {{umbilical}} ring of the <b>abdominal</b> <b>wall</b> to close. They are very common and can be caused by genetics or by traction on the umbilical cord or by the cord being cut too close to the body. They are corrected by surgery.|$|E

40|$|Objectives The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} and compare the roles of the accessory respiratory muscles, latissimus dorsi (LD), and sternocleidomastoid, in classical singing. Methods Electromyography was used to record the activity of these muscles in six classically trained female singers carrying out a number of singing and nonsinging tasks. Movements of the chest and <b>abdominal</b> <b>walls</b> were monitored simultaneously using inductive plethysmography, and the sound of the phonations was recorded. Results In normal breathing, LD is active transiently during very deep inhalations and in inhalation against resistance. During exhalation it becomes active again as residual capacity is approached or when air is expelled with great force. Sternocleidomastoid (SCM) supports inhalation when lung volume nears 100...|$|R
