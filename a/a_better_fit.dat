She trained to be a ballerina, but at age 18 found musical theater to be <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>fit,</b> and from 1994 to 1998, she worked in dinner theater. Adams made her feature film debut with a {{supporting}} part in the 1999 satire Drop Dead Gorgeous. After relocating to Los Angeles, she made several guest appearances in television, and took on mean girl parts in small-scale features. Her first major role came in Steven Spielberg's 2002 biopic Catch Me If You Can, opposite Leonardo DiCaprio, but she was unemployed for a year after. Her breakthrough came {{in the part of}} a loquacious pregnant woman in the 2005 independent film Junebug.|$|E
5|$|By October 1963, {{according}} to Woods, {{the situation had}} become critical and some officials were beginning to examine alternative options, such as conventional fighter aircraft {{in the form of}} the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II. By November1963, the RAF reportedly still found the P.1154 to be a suitable platform, while the Royal Navy appeared to be considering the F-4 Phantom II as being <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>fit</b> for its needs. In response, HSA elected focused its efforts on the RAF version. In late 1963, dissatisfied with the progress of the 'bi-service' model, the government examined three alternative options for the programme; to proceed with an RAF-orientated P.1154 while the Naval version would be delayed, pursue the development of a full dual-service P.1154 model with only limited differences between the services, or the complete termination of the program with the service's requirements to be re-appraised.|$|E

25|$|Many medieval {{shoes were}} made using the turnshoe method of construction, {{in which the}} upper was turned flesh side out, and was lasted onto the sole and joined to the edge by a seam. The shoe was then turned inside-out so that the grain was outside. Some shoes were {{developed}} with toggled flaps or drawstrings to tighten the leather around the foot for <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>fit.</b> Surviving medieval turnshoes often fit the foot closely, with {{the right and left}} shoe being mirror images. Around 1500, the turnshoe method was largely replaced by the welted rand method (where the uppers are sewn to a much stiffer sole and the shoe cannot be turned inside-out). The turnshoe method is still used for some dance and specialty shoes.|$|E

The company thought that this would make the zombie trope more interesting. Rockstar also saw similar [...] "cinematic heritage" [...] between the Western and zombie horror genres.
