5|$|The film's set {{designers}} Eugène Lourié and Max Douy built one of {{the most}} expensive sets in French film history at the Joinville Studio. According to Douy they were based on the script and were not reproductions of the interior of Chateau de la Ferté-Saint-Aubin, where exterior scenes were shot. The music boxes used in the film were borrowed from several sources and some <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> museum in Neuilly-sur-Seine. Renoir thought the musical organ scene and Dalio's performance in it was the best scene he had ever filmed. He shot the scene several times before he was satisfied with it. The costumes for the film were designed by Coco Chanel.|$|E
5|$|Scully is {{approached}} by the Dark Figure, who is {{revealed to be}} a Seraph, an angel who descended from the heavens and fathered four children with a mortal woman. God sent the Seraph to return the girls to Heaven {{in order to keep}} the Devil from claiming them as his own. Scully and Starkey find the fourth girl, Roberta Dyer (Perkins) at Gregory's church. However, Scully sees Starkey's horned shadow, revealing his true origins. Scully tries to help Roberta escape, but the women are confronted by the Seraph. She reluctantly lets go of Roberta's hand, after seeing Emily in place of Roberta, and lets her enter Heaven. Later, Scully tells Mulder they should have been protecting the girls from Starkey, not Gregory. She also believes that they <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> place where they were meant to be.|$|E

25|$|In October 2002, a Spix named Presley was {{discovered}} in Colorado, and repatriated to Brazil. This Spix had not been among those known in 1987.

Presley died on 25 June 2014 outside São Paulo, at the approximate age of 40.|$|E
25|$|Late 2009: After a {{terrorism}} scare, {{the layout}} of Departures at Terminal 1 was changed: the only part accessible without going through security is a passage across the front where the airlines' ticket offices are.

25|$|The site of {{the closed}} Marlboro Psychiatric Hospital has on-site contamination—it is not {{considered}} a Superfund clean-up site. Mayor Jonathan Hornik estimates it could cost more than $11 million to clean up. Mayor Jonathan Hornik stated that the state clearly has the responsibility for cleaning up the site. He however, stated that {{in the interest of}} getting it done, the township may have to show some flexibility in helping the state defray the costs. In addition to the contamination on the site, the old buildings from the hospital <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> state of decay and are being demolished.|$|E
25|$|The Towers are {{the ruins}} of Alton Towers stately home and {{are the source of}} the park's name.

The Towers <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> state of disrepair following decades of neglect. The ruins {{are open to the public}} during most of the open season. However, some areas are closed off as part of a £1.1 million project in place to restore the oldest parts of the Towers. Key areas of The Towers include the banqueting hall, the chapel, conservatories, and Her Ladyship's Gardens.|$|E
25|$|Colour maps {{were sent}} to {{commercial}} printers for printing in five colours, with the overprinting being added after the map had been printed. This process was chosen as it gave a higher quality for the fine line-work than the industry standard four-colour process (CMYK). As computer and software technology has advanced, and the cost reduced, many clubs <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> position to print their own maps. This enables clubs to print the six colours together (map and overprinting symbols) using that same four-colour process, but with a reduction in quality over traditional printing. Printing costs can be minimised by using standard stock sizes of paper e.g. A4 or Letter. It is important to use the correct type of paper: both the weight and the coating affect the usability of the final map.|$|E

25|$|In a major {{split in}} the ranks of Al Qaeda's organization, the Iraqi franchise, known as Al Qaeda in Iraq covertly invaded Syria and the Levant and began {{participating}} in the ongoing Syrian Civil War, gaining enough support and strength to re-invade Iraq's western provinces under the name of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS/ISIL), taking over much of the country in a blitzkrieg-like action and combining the Iraq insurgency and Syrian Civil War into a single conflict. Due to their extreme brutality and a complete change in their overall ideology, Al Qaeda's core organization in Central Asia eventually denounced ISIS and directed their affiliates to cut off all ties with this organization. Many analysts believe that because of this schism, Al Qaeda and ISIL <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> competition to retain the title of the world's most powerful terrorist organization.|$|E
25|$|A {{second volume}} of the series {{launched}} alongside Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Ten in 2014. Angel defends Magic Town against threats such as Amy Madison during Faith's absence, and acquires several new allies: Eldre Koh, an ancient Nitobe demon freed from his prison {{by the end of}} magic; Detective Brandt; Rory, a magically-mutated bartender; and the mutant Tricia and her boyfriend Parker. Angel is also aided by Sophronia and Lavinia, as well as Nadira, a Slayer who hated him for his actions as Twilight but found inner peace after being mutated, and has a deep connection with the magic of Magic Town, which has become sentient. Following Illyria's death in Buffy Season Nine, Angel finds Fred alive again, having been restored by the reset of the laws of magic; she is forced to share her body with Illyria but is able to keep the ancient demon mostly under control. Faith also returns, now working for Zane Pharmaceuticals. A crossover with Buffy Season Ten reveals a new demon villain: Archaeus, who sired the Master and is able to control all the vampires from that bloodline, including Angel, Spike and Drusilla. Angel travels to San Francisco to help Buffy combat the demon lord, discovering that Buffy and Spike <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> relationship, which Angel believes will not last. Meanwhile, Faith and Fred discover Drusilla in Magic Town, building a vampire army for Archaeus, who follows Angel back to London. The season ends with a conflict between Archaeus and his vampire army (including Drusilla and Detective Brandt), and Angel and his makeshift 'family' (Faith, Fred/Illyria, Koh, Nadira, Sophronia and Lavinia, and the Magic Town populace). Observing the battle, the sentient magic is almost convinced to join Archaeus, but ultimately defends Nadira from him and traps Archaeus inside a statue.|$|E

[...] Additionally, Golub claims that Mills has acted without Daley administration authorizations for plans such as elimination of a proposed hotel {{in favor of a}} second apartment tower, as required by an agreement between Golub and Mills. In addition, Golub has sued over the residential portion of the project, which was given to Freed. Golub claims to have accepted the office space part of the project at a low profit with the expectation of making a larger profit on the residential portion. However, a court ruling has paved the way for Mills to terminate its contract with Chicago-based Golub & Co. to develop the project’s two residential towers and to sell the residential portion of the Block 37 project in the Loop to developer Joseph A. Freed & Associates LLC.|$|E
500|$|After the {{legislature}} adjourned on July 18, 1786 without substantively addressing these complaints, rural Massachusetts protestors organized direct action, and began protest marches that {{shut down the}} state's court system, which enforced tax and civil forfeiture judgments and had become a focus of the discontent. [...] Bowdoin issued a proclamation in early September denouncing these actions, but took no overt steps to immediately organize a militia response (unlike governors in neighboring Connecticut and New Hampshire). [...] When the foreclosure court in Worcester was shut down by similar action on September 5, the county militia (composed mainly of men sympathetic to the protestors) refused to turn out, much to Bowdoin's chagrin. [...] The closure of the Worcester court was followed by closings in Concord and Taunton, and when the militia marched into Great Barrington to force court open there, one of the Judges, William Whiting asked the militiamen to take sides. [...] 800 of the 1,000 men took the people's side of the road. [...] By October, one correspondent wrote, [...] "We <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> state of Anarchy and Confusion bordering on Civil War".|$|E
500|$|According to [...] No. 1272, {{a decree}} {{signed into law}} on 5 December 1900, there are two {{official}} designs of the national flag. Article Two established the national banner as the tricolor with the yellow stripe doubling {{the size of the}} blue and red stripes. Article Three establishes the national flag charged with the coat of arms and is directed to be used by the military, government offices and diplomatic agents outside of Ecuador. While this law establishes the flag with the coat of arms as the state flag, it did not forbid the civilian population from using the flag. The only restriction is stated in Article Six where the merchant marine is restricted to using the flag without the coat of arms. Because of this, this has been construed to be the civil flag as it was practiced in other South American countries, such as Peru, Bolivia and Argentina. Unlike Ecuador, several of these South American countries forbade the civilian population from using the national flag with the coat of arms or, in the case of Argentina until 1985, the national flag charged with the Sun of May in the middle. Peru and Bolivia still restricts the usage of the state flag to just the government bodies and institutions and reserves the plain flags for national celebrations or as directed by law. However, in practice the flag with the coat of arms is often used in place of the plain flag, especially when it is important to distinguish the latter from the flag of Colombia. In the case when Colombian merchant marine ships are at sea, the Colombian national flag is charged with a red and blue oval with a white star in the center. For city governments, Article 4 in the 1900 decree forbids them from using the national flag with the coat of arms. A special flag was created for the city governments to use; it is a plain national flag charged with white stars that are placed in a circle pattern. The number of white stars will correspond to the number of provinces in Ecuador. However, this flag is identical to Venezuela's flag from 1905 until 1930, and similar to Venezuela's current flag (the stars <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> semi circle pattern).|$|E
