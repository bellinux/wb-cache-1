40|$|<b>Alarms</b> in the {{operating}} room remain a major source of annoyance and confusion. Nearly all <b>alarms</b> result from a transgression of certain <b>alarm</b> limits. We surveyed manufacturers at a major meeting of anesthesiologists for their default <b>alarm</b> limits.

Anesthesiologists' chosen <b>alarm</b> limits tended to parallel the manufacturers' defaults. Fewer than 30 % of anesthesiologists stated that they did not turn off the <b>alarms.</b> The leading reason for turning off <b>alarms</b> was the large number of false <b>alarms.</b> Estimates of the number of false <b>alarms</b> varied from 30 % to 76 %.

Methods : A risk analysis was performed before implementation. <b>Alarms</b> from patient monitors recorded for a year were identified, classified and counted. The first <b>alarms,</b> which went to the nurse responsible for the patient, were distinguished from the repeat <b>alarms</b> that were generated if the nurse failed to respond within 45 sec. Results : The <b>alarm</b> handling protocol was changed as staff felt they needed a greater overview of the NICU <b>alarms</b> to avoid risks. In 1 year, 222 751 critical <b>alarms</b> including 12 309 repeat <b>alarms</b> were generated by patient monitors, equivalent to two <b>alarms</b> per patient per hour. Most of the <b>alarms</b> were oxygen desaturation <b>alarms,</b> followed by bradycardia <b>alarms.</b> About 3 % of the desaturation <b>alarms</b> and 0. 2 % of the bradycardia <b>alarms</b> were repeated.

40|$|<b>Alarm</b> fatigue is a {{practice}} problem {{that applies to}} hospitalized patients and the nurses who care for them. Addressing <b>alarm</b> fatigue is important to promote <b>alarm</b> safety and to decrease the risk of patient harm or death. The {{purpose of this study}} was to decrease <b>alarm</b> fatigue and improve <b>alarm</b> safety in a regional neonatal intensive care unit (RNICU). Guided by the conceptual model for <b>alarm</b> fatigue and <b>alarm</b> safety, this study addressed whether or not <b>alarm</b> management protocols designed to decrease false and nuisance <b>alarms</b> in the physiological monitoring of neonates improve <b>alarm</b> safety via decreased <b>alarm</b> burden and <b>alarm</b> fatigue as evidenced by statistically significant reductions in false and nuisance <b>alarms.</b> A quantitative, time series quasi-experimental design was used with 4 waves of data collection.

40|$|A {{phenomenon}} called <b>alarm</b> fatigue {{has been}} identified as an outcome of nearly 40 different <b>alarms</b> that sound at any given time in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) (Borowski et al., 2011). <b>Alarm</b> fatigue can result in impaired recognition of worsening patient conditions and has been implicated in fatal patient events (Kowalczyk, 2010; Altimari, 2017). A quality improvement research study (QIRS) was conducted, aimed at reducing total <b>alarms</b> including noncritical (clinically irrelevant) and false <b>alarms</b> that contribute to the incidence of <b>alarm</b> fatigue and the potential for unsafe conditions. The project included exploration of the critical care nurse’s attitudes toward <b>alarms,</b> review of the existing evidence based practice policy on clinical <b>alarm</b> management and introduction of a new bedside <b>alarm</b> parameter verification called an “Alarm Check”.

40|$|Spatial <b>alarms</b> {{extend the}} idea of {{time-based}} <b>alarms</b> to the spatial dimension. Just as time-based <b>alarms</b> are set {{to remind us of}} the arrival of a future reference time point, spatial <b>alarms</b> are set on a spatial location of interest which the subscribers of the <b>alarm</b> will travel to sometime in the future. Spatial <b>alarm</b> processing requires meeting two demanding objectives: high accuracy, which ensures zero or very low <b>alarm</b> misses, and high scalability, which requires highly efficient and optimal processing of spatial <b>alarms.</b> In this paper we present a motion-aware framework, facilitated by two systematic methods, for scalable processing of spatial <b>alarms.</b> First, we introduce the concept of safe period to minimize the number of unnecessary spatial <b>alarm</b> evaluations, increasing the throughput and scalability of the system. We show that our safe period-based <b>alarm</b> evaluation techniques can significantly reduce the server load for spatial <b>alarm</b> processing compared to the periodic evaluation approach, while preserving the accuracy and timeliness of spatial <b>alarms.</b> Second, we develop a suite of spatial <b>alarm</b> grouping techniques based on spatial locality of the <b>alarms</b> and motion behavior of the mobile users, which reduces the safe period computation cost for spatial <b>alarm</b> evaluation at the server side. We evaluate the scalability and accuracy of our approach using a road network simulator and show that the proposed motion-aware safe period-based approach to spatial <b>alarm</b> processing offers significant performance enhancements for the <b>alarm</b> processing server while maintaining high accuracy of spatial <b>alarms,</b> especially compared to the conventional periodic <b>alarm</b> evaluation approach. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Failure {{location}} in transparent optical networks {{is difficult because}} of corrupted <b>alarms</b> and {{the large amount of}} <b>alarms</b> that a failure can trigger. One problem that network operators often face is how to set the thresholds in monitoring devices. Setting the thresholds low results in false <b>alarms,</b> whereas setting them high presents the risk of missing a significant degradation in network performance because of missing <b>alarms.</b> In this work, we show that for a network with binary <b>alarms</b> (<b>alarms</b> are either present or not), there is an asymmetry between false and missing <b>alarms.</b> We prove that false <b>alarms</b> can be corrected in polynomial time but the correction of missing <b>alarms</b> is NP-hard. Because of this asymmetry between false and missing <b>alarms,</b> false <b>alarms</b> have a lesser effect on the accuracy of the diagnosis results than missing <b>alarms</b> do. Network operators therefore, when allowed, should set the threshold low to favor false <b>alarms...</b>|$|R
