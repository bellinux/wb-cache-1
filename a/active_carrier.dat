40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} {{incidence}} of neonatal group B streptococcus (GBS) infection in <b>active</b> GBS <b>carriers</b> with preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROMs) after penicillins and erythromycin prophylaxis. Materials and methods: Patients diagnosed to have PPROM between 2004 and 2009 inclusive were treated using erythromycin (erythromycin group), ampicillin, amoxicillin or co-amoxiclav (penicillin group), or no antibiotics (control group) according to department protocols depending on their gestation and their GBS status {{at the time of}} presentation. Patients receiving both erythromycin and penicillins were included in the penicillin group. The incidence of neonatal GBS infection was compared between groups categorized according to the antibiotic regime received. Results: A total of 680 women were diagnosed to have PPROM of which 85 (12. 5 %) were <b>active</b> GBS <b>carriers.</b> GBS isolates were 100 % sensitive to penicillins but only 35 % were sensitive to erythromycin. There were 16, 22, and 47 patients in the penicillin, erythromycin, and control groups, respectively. The incidence of neonatal GBS infection in the three groups was 0 %, 36 %, and 13 %, respectively, and was statistically significant (p =  0. 023). Conclusion: Penicillins are more effective than erythromycin in preventing neonatal GBS infection in women with PPROM who were <b>active</b> GBS <b>carriers.</b> Because most women do not know their GBS status at the time of PPROM and it is practically difficult to identify the <b>active</b> <b>carriers</b> before delivery, ampicillin/amoxicillin should be used as a prophylactic antibiotic for <b>active</b> GBS <b>carriers</b> and women with unknown GBS carriage status to prevent neonatal GBS infection following PPROM...|$|R

50|$|The transcellular pathway of {{transport}} {{is important in}} the intestinal absorption of drug molecules, the other being the paracellular pathway. The transcellular pathway {{of transport}} include transcellular diffusion, <b>active</b> <b>carrier</b> mediated transportation, and transcytosis. The transcelluar diffusion simply involves the movement of solutes based on a diffusion gradient moving from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration, however, the cell membrane is a hydrophobic environment and will not allow the passive diffusion of charged, hydrophilic, or zwitterion molecules. Active transport involves the use of energy to transport specific substrates across barriers, even against the concentration gradient. Macromolecules can sometimes be transported through transcytosis.|$|E

Dealing with large values of size of FSK modulation leads to low spectral efficiencies [31]. However, for ML> 1, the phase of the symbols carries information.

This technique is usually referred to as OFDM/OQAM in the literature.|$|E

On the other hand, whenever a collision occurs, the influence of the interfering signal is in fact worse than it were for U= 1, because the signal power per <b>active</b> <b>carrier</b> is increased by a factor U.
