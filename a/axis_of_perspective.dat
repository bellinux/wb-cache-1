40|$|We {{propose a}} novel {{formulation}} of minimal case so-lutions {{for determining the}} relative pose <b>of</b> <b>perspective</b> and generalized cameras given a partially known rotation, namely, a known <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> rotation. An <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> rotation may be easily obtained by detecting vertical vanishing points with computer vision techniques, or {{with the aid of}} sensor mea-surements from a smartphone. Given a known <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> rota-tion, our algorithms solve for the angle of rotation around the known axis along with the unknown translation. We for-mulate these relative pose problems as Quadratic Eigen-value Problems which are very simple to construct. We run several experiments on synthetic and real data to compare our methods to the current state-of-the-art algorithms. Our methods provide several advantages over alternatives meth-ods, including efficiency and accuracy, particularly in the presence of image and sensor noise {{as is often the case}} for mobile devices. 1...|$|R

50|$|The {{reason the}} {{rotation}} of the Earth in relation to the pendulum swing increases in time (decreases in effect) with decreasing latitude is related to the Coriolis Effect.

40|$|Principal {{component}} (PC) maps, which plot {{the values}} of a given PC estimated {{on the basis of}} allele frequency variation at the geographic sampling locations of a set of populations, are often used to investigate the properties of past range expansions. Some studies have argued that in a range expansion, the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> greatest variation (i. e., the first PC) is parallel to the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> expansion. In contrast, others have identified a pattern in which the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> greatest variation is perpendicular to the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> expansion. Here, we seek to understand this difference in outcomes by investigating the effect of the geographic sampling scheme on the direction <b>of</b> the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> greatest variation under a two-dimensional range expansion model. From datasets simulated using each of two different schemes for the geographic sampling of populations under the model, we create PC maps for the first PC.
