40|$|Viewing action-relevant stimuli {{such as a}} graspable {{object or}} another person moving can affect the observer's own motor system. Evidence exists that {{external}} stimuli may facilitate or hinder movement in Parkinson's disease, so we investigated whether action-relevant stimuli would exert <b>a</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>influence.</b> We measured the effect of action-relevant stimuli (graspable door handles and finger movements) on reaction times compared with baseline stimuli (bars and object movements). Parkinson's patients were influenced by {{the location of the}} baseline stimuli, but unlike healthy controls, action-relevant stimuli did not exert <b>a</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>influence.</b> This suggests that external cues exert their influence in Parkinson's disease through lower-level visual processes and the influence of action-relevant stimuli on the motor system is disrupted...|$|R

5|$|As English courts do {{not form}} part of Singapore's {{hierarchy}} of courts, decisions of such courts are not binding on Singapore courts.

Judicial precedents from other jurisdictions may also be persuasive in specific areas of Singapore law. For instance, Indian decisions are persuasive in the areas of criminal law and procedure because Singapore borrowed heavily from India in these areas.|$|E

5|$|Teuruarii's reign was {{disrupted}} by ongoing French expansionism in the Pacific. Teuruarii entreated the British to place Rurutu under a British protectorate, which the islanders deemed more favorable {{due to their}} predominant adherence to Protestantantism. These efforts failed and Rurutu was proclaimed a protectorate of the French Third Republic on 27 March 1889. Teuruarii was allowed to continue ruling as king until the annexation of the island to the territory of French Oceania in 1900, today part of the overseas country of French Polynesia.

5|$|The progressions in {{northern}} art developed almost simultaneously {{with the early}} Italian Renaissance. The philosophical and artistic traditions of the Mediterranean were not however part of the northern heritage, {{to the extent that}} many elements of Latin culture were actively disparaged in the north. The role of Renaissance humanism in art, for example, was less pronounced in the Low Countries than in Italy. Local religious trends had <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> <b>influence</b> on early northern art, {{as can be seen in}} the subject matter, composition and form of many late 13th- and early 14th-century artworks. The northern painters' doctrine was also built on elements of recent Gothic tradition, and less on the classical tradition prevalent in Italy.|$|E

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>strong</b> <b>influence</b> on Champagne wine {{production}} was the centuries-old rivalry between {{the region and}} Burgundy. From the key market of Paris to the palace of Louis XIV of France at Versailles, proponents of Champagne and Burgundy would compete for dominance. For most of his life, Louis XIV would drink only Champagne wine {{with the support of}} his doctor Antoine d'Aquin who advocated the King drink Champagne with every meal for the benefit of his health. As the King aged and his ailments increased, competing doctors would propose alternative treatments with alternative wines, to soothe the King's ills. One of these doctors, Guy-Crescent Fagon conspired with the King's mistress to oust d'Aquin and have himself appointed as Royal Doctor. Fagon quickly attributed the King's continuing ailments to Champagne and ordered that only Burgundy wine must be served at the royal table.|$|E
