5|$|As Buoso Donati lies {{dead in his}} curtained four-poster bed, his {{relatives}} gather round to mourn his passing, but are really more interested in learning {{the contents of his}} will. Among those present are his cousins Zita and Simone, his poor-relation brother-in-law Betto, and Zita's nephew Rinuccio. Betto mentions a rumour he has heard that Buoso has left everything to a monastery; this disturbs the others and precipitates a frantic search for the will. The document is found by Rinuccio, who is confident that his uncle has left him plenty of money. He withholds the will momentarily and asks Zita to allow him to marry Lauretta, daughter of Gianni Schicchi, a newcomer to Florence. Zita replies that if Buoso has left them rich, he can marry whom he pleases; she and the other relatives <b>are</b> <b>anxious</b> <b>to</b> begin reading the will. A happy Rinuccio sends little Gherardino to fetch Schicchi and Lauretta.|$|E

[...] In contrast, an editorial published in The Peninsula argued that the case showed China's leaders were losing their ability to control local authorities.|$|E
500|$|Throughout his writings, Du Bois {{supported}} women's rights,Donaldson, Shawn, [...] "Women's Rights", in Young, pp. 219–221. but {{he found}} it difficult to publicly endorse the women's right-to-vote movement because leaders of the suffragism movement refused to support his fight against racial injustice. A Crisis editorial from 1913 broached the taboo subject of interracial marriage: although Du Bois generally expected persons to marry within their race, he viewed the problem as a women's rights issue, because laws prohibited white men from marrying black women. Du Bois wrote [...] " [...] laws leave the colored girls absolutely helpless for the lust of white men. It reduces colored women {{in the eyes of the}} law to the position of dogs. As low as the white girl falls, she can compel her seducer to marry her... We must kill [...] not because we <b>are</b> <b>anxious</b> <b>to</b> marry the white men's sisters, but because we are determined that white men will leave our sisters alone."Du Bois quoted in Lubin, Alex (2005), Romance and Rights: The Politics of Interracial Intimacy, 1945–1954, University Press of Mississippi, pp. 71–72.|$|E

Birds may be used for breeding or kept after their hunting days are over, but falconers believe it is preferable that young, fit birds are flown at quarry.|$|E

I protest against such a union as that! Ours, sir, is the Government of a white race.... We <b>are</b> <b>anxious</b> <b>to</b> force free government on all; and I see that it has been urged ... that it is the mission of this country to spread civil and religious liberty over all the world, and especially over this continent. It is a great mistake.|$|E

[...] In 1978, however, Leeds City Council informed T that the factory was still [...] "badly contaminated" [...] with asbestos, with dust found in the basement, lift shaft, roof, ventilation shafts and beneath the floors. Hessian sacks containing asbestos fibre were still present, and the yard was filled with 'a few hundred tonnes' of blue asbestos waste mixed with soil. R.D. Lunt, T's Safety and Environment manager, wrote of the factory basement: [...] "Every nook and cranny has asbestos fibre in it". T contributed £15,000 towards the clean-up of the factory, and claimed they were doing so out of [...] "a moral, not a legal responsibility" [...] to do so. The surrounding houses and buildings {{were not included in}} this operation, and Leeds City Council and T [...] "agreed to keep the whole matter 'low-key' if approached by the media," [...] while a T internal memo stated [...] "The Principal Inspector of Factories and the Assistant Director of Environmental Health <b>are</b> <b>anxious</b> <b>to</b> play this down and have given us considerable support." ...|$|E

According to Hideyuki Takai, president of Toho Co.: “We are delighted in rebooting the character together to realize its much-anticipated return by fans from all over the world. We <b>are</b> <b>anxious</b> <b>to</b> find out where Godzilla’s new stomping will take us.” Legendary announced it would reboot the franchise with Warner Bros. co-producing and co-financing. Legendary announced it would make the new film closer in style to the original 1954 film rather than the 1998 film and its [...] "iguana-like creature". According to Thomas Tull, chairman and CEO of Legendary Pictures, [...] "Our plans are to produce the Godzilla that we, as fans, would want to see.
