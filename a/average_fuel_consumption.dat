25|$|The Proton Prevé {{was finally}} {{unveiled}} on 16 April 2012 at Seri Kembangan by the Prime Minister of Malaysia, Najib Razak. It launched {{with a choice}} of six colours and three trim variants, the Executive MT, Executive CVT and Premium CVT respectively. Both Executive trim variants are powered by Proton's 1.6L CamPro IAFM+ engine. The Executive MT is paired with a five-speed manual gearbox whereas the Executive CVT is equipped with a six-speed CVT. The Premium trim is offered with the superior 1.6L turbocharged CamPro CFE engine, mated to a seven-speed CVT, also known as ProTronic, Proton's version of a manumatic transmission. Safety-wise, the Executive variants are equipped with dual SRS airbags and an Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) with Electronic Brakeforce Distribution (EBD) whereas the Premium trim features an additional two airbags, Brake Assist (BA), Traction Control (TCS) and Electronic Stability Control (ESC) on top of those offered in the Executive. The Premium variant is also equipped with exclusive kit such as steering-mounted paddle shifters, automatic headlights and wipers, cruise control, climate control, a built-in touchscreen GPS head unit with Bluetooth, USB & iPod connectivity as well as push-start engine ignition. All Proton Prevés are equipped with a Smart Information Display system (SiD) that displays information such as <b>average</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption,</b> battery health and distance to empty. Another standard feature is in-car WiFi, made possible by a collaboration between Proton and Malaysian ISP, Yes 4G. The Prevé is priced between RM59,540 and RM72,990 respectively. It received over 11,000 bookings within two months of its official launch and became the 7th best-selling car in Malaysia for the month of May 2012, topping all rivals in its category.|$|E

We assessed variation in burn severity and <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> within and between wildfires that burnt British moorlands in 2011 and 2012. We adapted the Composite Burn Index (pCBI) to provide semi-quantitative estimates of burn severity. Pre- and post-fire surface (shrubs and graminoids) and ground (litter, moss, duff) fuel loads associated with large wildfires were assessed using destructive sampling and analysed using a Generalised Linear Mixed Model (GLMM). Consumption during wildfires was compared with published estimates of consumption during prescribed burns. Burn severity and <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> were related to fire weather, assessed using the Canadian Fire Weather Index System (FWI System), and pre-fire fuel structure. pCBI varied 1. 6 fold between, and up to 1. 7 fold within, wildfires. pCBI was higher where moisture codes of the FWI System indicated drier fuels.

Although {{the duration of the}} flight phases differs from flights of the first route, the emission trends are similar to those for the first route, particularly for HC and CO.

40|$|The Cacheu Mangroves Natural Park (PNTC) was {{established}} in the year 2000 with the objective of protecting the coastal forests of Northern Guinea-Bissau, which have been subject to deforestation and are at risk. Concomitantly, the need to find sustainable financial revenues to support forest conservation motivated the development of projects that explore avoidance of deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) as a potential income possibility. The 886, 150 ha of forest in the PNTC include a mosaic of different villages where communities with different cultural and socio-economic habits reside. In addition to the uncontrolled expansion of subsistence agriculture with the associated shortening of fallow periods, forests may have also been subject to degradation from selective logging, fuel wood collection, and charcoal production.
