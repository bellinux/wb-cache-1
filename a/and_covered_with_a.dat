5|$|A {{circular}} {{hole was}} {{cut into the}} backdrop <b>and</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> transparent material. A strong light behind this hole represented the moon. The light was occasionally manipulated to suggest the passage of clouds. Gautier and St. Georges wanted the pool {{to be made of}} large mirrors but Pillet rejected this idea because of its cost. In the 1868 revival, however, mirrors were acquired for this scene.|$|E
5|$|In 1998 {{management}} of the Tomaree National Park, in which the lighthouse is located, {{was transferred to the}} National Parks and Wildlife Service and the tower received some long due restoration, which completed in October 1998. At a cost of 85,000 the walls were cleaned <b>and</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> special waterproof membrane system, the cast steel staircase refitted and the lantern room resealed for waterproofing.|$|E
5|$|Viewed with a microscope, {{the wall}} of the {{apothecium}} is made of three tissue layers of roughly equal thickness. The first layer of tissue is black, leathery and compact, <b>and</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> fine layer of brownish-black hairs (a tomentum); the second layer consists of loosely interlaced brown hyphae suspended in a gelatinous matrix. The third layer is the fertile, spore-bearing surface, the brownish-black hymenium.|$|E

5|$|When {{designing}} the exterior, Pei {{borrowed from the}} tradition of Japanese temples, particularly those found in nearby Kyoto. He created a concise spaceframe wrapped into French limestone <b>and</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> glass roof. Pei also oversaw specific decorative details, including {{a bench in the}} entrance lobby, carved from a 350-year-old keyaki tree. Because of Koyama's considerable wealth, money was rarely considered an obstacle; estimates at the time of completion put the cost of the project at US$350million.|$|E
5|$|Arbroath smokies, {{for which}} Arbroath is {{well-known}} nationally and internationally, are made solely in Arbroath following the award of Protected Geographical Indication in 2004, which limits Arbroath smokie production to within 4km of Arbroath. Smokies {{are made from}} haddock using traditional methods {{dating back to the}} late 19th century where the fish are first salted overnight to preserve them, before being left tied in pairs to dry. Next, the dried fish are hung in a special barrel containing a hardwood fire <b>and</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> lid. After around an hour of smoking, the fish are golden brown and ready to eat. The preparation of smokies remains a cottage industry in Arbroath, centred almost exclusively at the harbour area. However, one larger processor, RR Spink, supplied Arbroath smokies to several UK supermarket chains. It appears that, nowadays, the firm concentrates on smoking other fish such as salmon or trout and no longer supplies the Arbroath Smokie. The company holds the Royal Warrant as a fishmonger to the Queen.|$|E
5|$|The frog cake {{is a small}} dessert {{shaped to}} {{resemble}} a frog with its mouth open, consisting of a sponge base with a jam centre, topped in artificial cream <b>and</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> thick layer of fondant icing. The recipe today remains {{identical to the one}} employed when the cake was first produced in the 1920s. When manufactured, large layers of sponge cake are combined and cut mechanically into shape, covered in the fondant, and the mouth is then formed with a hot knife. Fondant eyes of a contrasting colour are manually added to the head, and the completed dessert is presented in a paper patty-pan. The fondant is normally brown, green or pink, but for special occasions colours can include variations such as red and yellow.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} half of the 19thcentury the {{population}} of London more than doubled, from a little under a million people in 1801 to almost two and a half million in 1851. Despite this rapid growth in population, the amount of land set aside for use as graveyards remained unchanged at approximately , spread across around 200 small sites. The difficulty of digging without disturbing existing graves led to bodies often simply being stacked on top of each other to fit the available space <b>and</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> layer of earth. In more crowded areas even relatively fresh graves had to be exhumed to free up space for new burials, their contents being unearthed and scattered to free up space. In some cases large pits were dug on existing burial grounds, unearthing the previous burials, and fresh corpses crammed into the available space. Intact material from burials was sold on a thriving market in second hand coffin furniture, coffin wood was burned as household fuel, and exhumed bones were shipped in bulk to the north of England to be sold as fertiliser. Decaying corpses contaminated the water supply and the city suffered regular epidemics of cholera, smallpox, measles and typhoid; in 1842 the mean working life of a London professional man was 30 years and of a London labourer just 17 years.|$|E
25|$|The area is {{underlain}} by Carboniferous coal measures, {{which are}} capped by glacial deposits of varying thickness. Spring-lines are prominent {{on the lower}} valley slopes and {{have a significant effect}} on the vegetation. The soils are predominantly gley and acidic, well-drained <b>and</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> thin peaty layer on the higher ground, wetter and with a deeper layer of peat in less well-drained areas.|$|E
25|$|The coffin {{was then}} interred {{in the far}} western end of the Nave, {{only a few feet}} from the entrance, in soil brought from each of the main battlefields, <b>and</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> silk pall. Servicemen from the armed forces stood guard as tens of {{thousands}} of mourners filed silently past. The ceremony appears to have served as a form of catharsis for collective mourning on a scale not previously known.|$|E

25|$|On August 4, a {{fire was}} {{reported}} at DiMaggio's house in Boulevard, where firemen found {{the bodies of}} Anderson's mother, Christina, her eight-year-old brother Ethan, and the family dog Cali. Christina Anderson died of blunt force trauma, {{believed to have been}} caused by a crowbar. She was apparently tortured, and her body covered with a tarp. Cali was shot dead <b>and</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sleeping bag. An arrest warrant was issued for DiMaggio.|$|E
25|$|Hairdressing takes {{almost two}} hours, she said, and while {{my hair is}} busy, my mind stays idle. I am afraid that my mind escapes through the hair and onto the fingers of my hairdresser.

She was shrouded in a white, laced peignoir, her hair, unfastened and reaching to the floor, enfolded her entire body.|$|E
25|$|The C.430 Rafale was a two-seat {{development}} of the single seat Caudron C.362, {{the winner of the}} 1933 Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe. Slightly larger and heavier, though with a lower wing loading, the Rafale was a low wing cantilever monoplane, wood framed <b>and</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> mixture of plywood and fabric. Its one piece, single spar wing was strongly straight tapered to elliptical tips and was plywood covered with an outer layer of fabric. There were flaps inboard of the ailerons.|$|E

25|$|Most pottery {{produced}} in central Mexico is fired at low temperatures (low-fire) <b>and</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> glaze made with lead and other minerals. This is because lead will fuse {{and produce a}} shine at a firing temperature of less than 800C, while alternatives require temperatures twice as high. The use of lead in these wares has produced health warning in both Mexico and the United States, with the risks being known {{as early as the}} late 19th century. Lead from the glaze tends to leach into foods after repeated use. Use of this type of ware has been linked to elevated blood levels in children in Mexico City, Oaxaca and other places and severely high levels in children of potters. The lead content is highest in Oaxacan pottery. This lead content has blocked most rurally produced ceramics from the United States market, where they could fetch much higher prices.|$|E
25|$|Piye's tomb {{was located}} {{next to the}} largest Pyramid in the cemetery, {{designated}} Ku.1 (seen in {{the image on the}} right), at el-Kurru near Jebel Barkal in what is now Northern Sudan. Down a stairway of 19 steps opened to the east, the burial chamber is cut into the bedrock as an open trench <b>and</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> corbelled masonry roof. His body had been placed on a bed which rested {{in the middle of the}} chamber on a stone bench with its four corners cut away to receive the legs of the bed so that the bed platform lay directly on the bench. Further out to the edge of the cemetery (the first pharaoh to receive such an entombment in more than 500 years) his four favorite horses had been buried. This site would be also occupied by the tombs of several later members of the dynasty.|$|E
25|$|The larvae of {{this species}} are notorious tent {{caterpillars}}. Tent caterpillars do not make tents, but rather, weave a silky sheet where they lie together during molting. They lay down strands of silk as they move over branches and then travel along them like tightrope walkers. They follow pheromones secreted by other larvae rather than following the silk lines themselves. The caterpillars are social, traveling together to feed. The caterpillars live in deciduous trees, which they strip off leaves after emerging from their eggs. The adult moth {{of this species}} favors oak, sweetgum, tupelo, aspen, and sugar maple for oviposition, but the larvae can be found feeding on many other species of woody trees or shrubs. The females lay eggs in masses of up to 300, which are stuck to twigs <b>and</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> gluey cement called spumaline, which prevents them from desiccating and freezing. The eggs hatch the following winter.|$|E

25|$|The hull was a two-step design {{using the}} Linton Hope {{construction}} method. This used {{a system of}} circular formers separated by stringers <b>and</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> double layer of 0.125in (3.2mm) mahogany strips, the second {{at right angles to}} the first. This allowed the construction of smooth curved surfaces. The Pellet was a single-bay biplane without stagger and was often described as a sesquiplane because the lower wing was not only of smaller span but also of smaller chord. The lower wing was mounted {{on the top of the}} fuselage and carried wingtip floats mounted directly below the N-type interplane struts. There was another pair of these struts between the fuselage and upper wing supporting the engine, which was mounted tractorwise above the upper wing surface in a streamlined nacelle. The engine, a 450hp (340kW) Napier Lion was cooled with radiators fitted flush in the lower surface of the upper wing. The pilot sat in front of the propeller. At the rear of the aircraft, the braced tailplane was mounted about halfway up the single fin.|$|E
