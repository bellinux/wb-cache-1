[...] Cobham and Grey were to raise one-hundred and sixty thousand pounds (a figure that could be safely multiplied by twenty to convert to contemporary money) to bribe or hire an army. [...] Cobham {{was to be the}} go-between with the Count of Aremberg, who would do the <b>actual</b> <b>negotiations</b> with the Spanish court for the money.

That Gambetta after 1875 felt strongly that the relations between France and Germany might be improved, and that he made it his object, by travelling incognito, to become better acquainted with Germany and the adjoining states, may be accepted, but M.

On the other hand, the increased knowledge of Gambetta's attitude towards European politics which later information has supplied confirms the view that in him France lost prematurely a master mind, whom she could ill spare. In April 1905 a monument by Dalou to his memory at Bordeaux was unveiled by President Loubet.|$|E

In regards to negotiating with Brezhnev, Kissinger advised Ford that the [...] "best approach is to lay out frankly and soberly our position and let him absorb it". They both prepared for a confrontational stance presented by Brezhnev and his aides, which Ford believed would be a calculated effort [...] "to see if I would bend or fight back". According to Dobrynin, [...] "Kissinger played the leading role in the deliberations because Ford did not yet know all the details". Kissinger himself, however, referred to Ford's involvement in the negotiations as [...] "technical", contrasting Ford's approach with Nixon's tendency to let Kissinger handle the intricacies of negotiating.|$|E
2500|$|Lars Karl {{claimed that}} the Red Army liberated Europe, [...] "and therefore, the USSR {{had a right to}} have a say in its matters."

Karl added that no mention of the Stalin-Hitler Pact is made. Polish author Łukasz Jasina commented that the Bug River is spoken of as the Polish border already during 1944 – although the USSR annexed the eastern territories of Poland only after the war. Russian historian Boris Sokolov wrote that the film's depiction of Battle of Kursk [...] was [...] "completely false" [...] and the German casualties were exaggerated. Liberation presents the civilian population in Berlin welcoming the Red Army; German author Jörg von Mettke wrote the scene in which the German women flirt with the soldiers [...] "might have happened, but it was mostly otherwise." ...|$|E

While many studies implicitly assume a bargaining advantage of countries holding a referendum as ratification procedure, very few explicitly deal with the theoretical implications of this connection. In this paper a formal model is developed that analyses the connection between the preferences of the domestic audience and the institutional framework of a country. The model shows a clear causal connection between relative constraints of a country’s domestic ratification process and the bargaining power of governments. ...|$|R

50|$|Even though {{software}} applications {{can play an}} important role in the facilitation of a Role-Play Negotiation War Game, the method is inherently focused on role-play simulation. War Games can be used to prepare for virtually all two or three party negotiations.

A client’s employees will then become involved in the actual War Game by acting partly as the company itself, partly as the other negotiating party. Through a series of structured simulations, a tailor-made strategy can then be developed and calibrated.|$|R

In this article, I introduce a synthesizing approach for studying format appropriation. Drawing on format study, media industry research and structuration theory, I suggest that television formats should be understood and studied as a process of cultural negotiation in which global influences and local elements amalgamate on various levels of television culture (i. e., production, text, and reception); every level includes several sites of symbolic or <b>actual</b> <b>negotiation.</b> These sites emerge in the duality of structure and human agency...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{investigate}} people’s {{attitudes towards}} the possible use of mobile negotiation support systems (NSS) in different social contexts {{and the consequences}} for their design. For that purpose we developed an online survey based on existing models of technology acceptance. In the questionnaire we showed five filmed scenarios of NSS use contexts. The data collected from 120 respondents, showed (a) that subjective norm {{is an important factor}} influencing the intention to use the system and (b) that the acceptance of NSS depends on the use context. Therefore, we argue that NSS should be designed not merely as tools being used in the <b>actual</b> <b>negotiation</b> but as social devices harnessing social networks to provide support in all negotiation phases...|$|R

In constellations {{with many}} negotiation parties, each consisting of internal factions, varying internal decision rules and {{more or less}} defined organizational boundaries, bargaining over multiple issues over more than one sequence, make outcomes unpredictable.

This introductory piece offers some suggestions for selecting and prioritising stakeholders so that the process of <b>actual</b> <b>negotiation</b> (with mediation, if any) could be undertaken in an orderly and transparent manner...|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{approach}} to matchmaking in electronic marketplaces of peer entities, which mixes in a formal and principled way Datalog, fuzzy sets and utility theory, {{in order to determine}} the most promising matches between prospective counterparts. The use of Datalog ensures the scalability of our approach to large marketplaces, while Fuzzy Logic provides a neat connection with logical specifications and allows to model soft constraints and how well they could be satisfied by an agreement. Noteworthy is that our approach takes into account in the peer-to-peer matchmaking also preferences of each counterpart and their utilities. This allows to rule out of the match list those counteroffers that, although seemingly appealing for the buyer, would probably lead to failure due to contrasting preferences of the seller, and paves the way to the <b>actual</b> <b>negotiation</b> stage...|$|R

40|$|For {{a country}} like Lithuania the {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union {{marked the beginning of the}} second great transformation of gender relations in the 20 th century. While the first one at the beginning of the 1940 s brought an end to the then predominating catholic-conservative model, the second one during the 1990 s brought an end to the Soviet version of gender discrimination and its ideology of the dual role of women as worker-mothers. This paper confronts some of the institutional change in post-communist gender order and regime with an exemplary look into the <b>actual</b> <b>negotiation</b> of requirements and possibilities in the context of a concrete biographical situation.
