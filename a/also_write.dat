5|$|After Mzilikazi died in 1868, his son Lobengula {{replaced}} him in 1870, following a brief succession struggle. Tall and well built, Lobengula was generally considered thoughtful and sensible, even by contemporary Western accounts; {{according to the}} South African big-game hunter Frederick Hugh Barber, who met him in 1875, he was witty, mentally sharp and authoritative—"every inch a king". Based at his royal kraal at Bulawayo, Lobengula was at first open to Western enterprises in his country, adopting Western-style clothing and granting mining concessions and hunting licences to white visitors in return for pounds sterling, weapons and ammunition. Because of the king's illiteracy, these documents were prepared in English or Dutch by whites who took up residence at his kraal; to ascertain that what was written genuinely reflected what he had said, Lobengula would have his words translated and transcribed {{by one of the}} whites, then later translated back by another. Once the king was satisfied of the written translation's veracity, he would sign his mark, affix the royal seal (which depicted an elephant), and then have the document signed and witnessed by a number of white men, at least one of whom would <b>also</b> <b>write</b> an endorsement of the proclamation.|$|E
5|$|In his foreword, Kwee {{wrote that}} Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang was {{intended}} to lead readers to consider how fate is often {{at odds with the}} wants of those involved. Critical readings have, however, been diverse. The sinologist Myra Sidharta notes that the book is replete with mysticism common at the time, as does another sinologist, John Kwee. The latter cites four examples: a dream of Marsiti's, later shown to be prophetic, in which she is forcibly separated from Aij Tjeng despite his previous promise that they would never part; a discussion of reuniting with loved ones after death; Marsiti's spirit attending her daughter's wedding; and a scene {{towards the end of the}} novel in which Marsiti's spirit guides Roosminah's daughter to pick flowers for Aij Tjeng and Gwat Nio. Nio Joe Lan, in his history of Chinese Malay literature, notes that Kwee was the only Chinese writer of romances to <b>also</b> <b>write</b> on Eastern (particularly Chinese) philosophy. He finds mysticism to be a common theme in Kwee's works, noting it as particularly well-developed in the later novel Soemangetnja Boenga Tjempaka (The Joy of the Cempaka Flowers).|$|E

25|$|The rise of cuteness in Japanese culture {{emerged in}} the 1970s {{as part of a}} new style of writing. Many teenage girls began to write {{laterally}} using mechanical pencils. These pencils produced very fine lines, as opposed to traditional Japanese writing that varied in thickness and was vertical. The girls would <b>also</b> <b>write</b> in big, round characters and they added little pictures to their writing, such as hearts, stars, emoticon faces, and letters of the Latin alphabet.|$|E
25|$|People {{not only}} use these three {{slightly}} differing spelling systems, but they <b>also</b> <b>write</b> words {{more or less}} as they pronounce them. Because of this words are often spelt in various ways, for example sena/sina 'that, there', kothai/kothay/kothei/kothey/kothe 'back of head, occiput'. Variation like this depends on age, family, island, and other factors such as poetic speech. It can be difficult at times to decide which is most correct — different people have different opinions (and sometimes have very strong opinions).|$|E

25|$|A novelist is {{an author}} or writer of novels, though often novelists <b>also</b> <b>write</b> in other genres of both fiction and non-fiction.

25|$|Among their {{criticisms of}} Mao, Chang and Halliday argue that, despite his having been {{born into a}} {{relatively}} rich peasant family, he had little well-informed concern for the long-term welfare of the Chinese peasantry.

They <b>also</b> <b>write</b> that Mao had arranged for the arrests and murders {{of many of his}} political opponents, including some of his personal friends, and they argue that he was a far more tyrannical leader than had previously been thought.|$|E

25|$|Nagai {{and another}} playwright, Hisashi Inoue, have {{similarities}} in their approaches because they both aim {{to write about}} ordinary people going through extraordinary situations. Both playwrights <b>also</b> <b>write</b> differently compared to other playwrights in their own generation — such as Toshiki Okada and Oriza Hirata. The clear and logical structure of Nagai's plays makes it naturalistic The characters are caught in some predicament and the motor for the play's theatricality is how the characters are liberated from the predicament. Nagai's plays are easily accessible to Western audiences because her works are both traditionally Japanese while also being very universal at the same time. Another playwright, Yōji Sakate, also resembles Nagai because the motivation behind his dramas is his social conscience. Sakate and Nagai both combine elements of Shingeki and Angura.|$|E

500|$|Life of the Virgin – {{earliest}} complete {{biography of}} Mary, {{the mother of}} Jesus. This is an attributed work and now believed not to be by Maximus the Confessor.

500|$|The album's production, almost solely done by Dr. Dre and DJ Yella, {{was praised}} by several critics. Jason Birchmeier from Allmusic gave a {{considerable}} amount of attention to the album's production, saying that [...] "Dr. Dre and Yella meld together P-Funk, Def Jam-style hip hop, and the leftover electro sounds of mid-80s Los Angeles, creating a dense, funky, and thoroughly unique style of their own." [...] Birchmeier would <b>also</b> <b>write</b> that some songs—"Eazy Duz It", [...] "We Want Eazy", [...] "Eazy-er Said Than Dunn", and [...] "Radio"—are all heavily produced and have [...] "layers upon layers of samples and beats competing with Eazy-E's rhymes for attention." [...] Rapper Kanye West also touted Dr. Dre's production on the album.|$|E
