5|$|The {{build-up}} {{towards a}} war involving Lombards, Gepids, and Byzantines started possibly in 548 or 549, with Audoin and Thurisind each sending an embassy to Justinian's court at Constantinople, {{in attempts to}} obtain military support from Justinian or at least, {{in the case of}} Thurisind, to get a pledge of neutrality. To sway Justinian, Thurisind's envoys reminded him of their long tradition of alliance <b>and</b> <b>promised</b> to fight against Byzantium's enemies. However, the emperor sided with the Lombards; he made them formal allies <b>and</b> <b>promised</b> to provide troops against the Gepids. From Justinian's perspective, this war was of major importance in the larger context of the Gothic War, because possession of Pannonia was strategically necessary to keep open land communications between Italy and the Balkans.|$|E

As a warden of the Scottish Marches he grew constantly more frustrated with the King's idleness, and eventually negotiated a peace treaty with the Scots. This action on Harclay's part amounted to treason, and early in 1323 he was apprehended by the King's men, and hanged, drawn and quartered.|$|E

40|$|Concurrency {{plays an}} {{important}} role in programming language design. Logic variables in the form of futures <b>and</b> <b>promises</b> provide a means of synchronization and communication in concurrent computation. Futures <b>and</b> <b>promises,</b> which differ from general logic variables in that a distinction is made between reading and writing them, have been introduced previously. However, no formal operational semantics has been provided for promises. In order to formally investigate properties of futures <b>and</b> <b>promises</b> in a functional setting, a concurrent lambda-calculus extended with futures <b>and</b> <b>promises</b> is presented. It is intended to provide a computation model for the programming language Alice. We prove the calculus confluent, and give a proof showing strong normalization in the simply typed case without promises. Further, we introduce a type system so as to statically enforce proper use of promises in the calculus...|$|R
