5|$|Bryant and Milam were {{questioned}} by Leflore County sheriff George Smith. They admitted {{they had taken}} the boy from his great-uncle's yard but claimed they had released him the same night in front of Bryant's store. Bryant and Milam were arrested for kidnapping. Word got out that Till was missing, and soon Medgar Evers, Mississippi state field secretary for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and Amzie Moore, head of the Bolivar County chapter, became involved. They disguised themselves as cotton pickers {{and went into the}} cotton fields in search of <b>any</b> <b>information</b> <b>that</b> might help find Till.|$|E
5|$|Freitas {{points out}} that probes, unlike the {{interstellar}} radio waves commonly targeted by SETI searches, could store information for long, perhaps geological, timescales, and could emit strong radio signals unambiguously recognizable as being of intelligent origin, rather than being dismissed as a UFO or a natural phenomenon. Probes could also modify any signal they send to suit the system they were in, which {{would be impossible for}} a radio transmission originating from outside the target star system. Moreover, the use of small robotic probes with widely distributed beacons in individual systems, rather than a small number of powerful, centralized beacons, would provide a security advantage to the civilization using them. Rather than revealing the location of a radio beacon powerful enough to signal the whole galaxy and risk such a powerful device being compromised, decentralized beacons installed on robotic probes need not reveal <b>any</b> <b>information</b> <b>that</b> an extraterrestrial civilization prefers others not to have.|$|E

Zhang further theorized that the allegation was caused by unfounded rumors and scientific investigations on the allegation was purposely ignored on the Chinese side for the sake of domestic and international propaganda.|$|E

On 12 May, four militants {{were killed by the}} Macedonian police, in a village close to Kosovo. The police seized four bags of explosives, anti-infantry mines and other weapons. Those killed were wearing black uniforms and UÇK insignia was found in the vehicle. In the following days, as Macedonia petitioned Kosovo for <b>any</b> <b>information</b> <b>that</b> it might have possessed, seventy ethnic-Albanian criminals, linked to the Albanian Mafia, were arrested for illegal weapons possession. Among the arrested were four men, a father and his three sons. They are believed to be linked to the men that were killed on 12 May.|$|E
25|$|In March 1941, Japan's Foreign Minister Yōsuke Matsuoka, a Germanophile, visited Berlin. On 29 March 1941, {{during a}} {{conversation}} with Matsuoka, Ribbentrop, as instructed by Hitler, told the Japanese nothing about the upcoming Operation Barbarossa, as Hitler believed that he could defeat the Soviet Union {{on his own and}} preferred that the Japanese attack Britain instead. Hitler did not wish for <b>any</b> <b>information</b> <b>that</b> might lead the Japanese into attacking the Soviet Union to reach their ears. Ribbentrop tried to convince Matsuoka to urge the government in Tokyo to attack the great British naval base at Singapore, claiming the Royal Navy was too weak to retaliate due to its involvement in the Battle of the Atlantic. Matsuoka responded that preparations to occupy Singapore were under way.|$|E

500|$|Malaysia had {{initially}} declined to release raw data from its military radar, deeming the information [...] "too sensitive", but later acceded. Defence experts suggested that giving others access to radar information could be sensitive {{on a military}} level, for example: [...] "The rate at which they can take the picture can also reveal how good the radar system is." [...] One suggested that some countries could already have had radar data on the aircraft, but were reluctant to share <b>any</b> <b>information</b> <b>that</b> could potentially reveal their defence capabilities and compromise their own security. Similarly, submarines patrolling the South China Sea might have information {{in the event of}} a water impact, and sharing such information could reveal their locations and listening capabilities.|$|E

None of these produced results; however, in May 1865 Lady Tichborne saw an advertisement placed by Arthur Cubitt of Sydney, Australia, on behalf of his [...] "Missing Friends Agency". She wrote to him, and he agreed to place a series of notices in Australian newspapers. These gave details of the Bellas last voyage and described Roger Tichborne as [...] "of a delicate constitution, rather tall, with very light brown hair and blue eyes".

The therapist will consider what massage techniques worked best for the dog and will often note any changes in gait or posture after the treatment session is complete. Finally, after the therapist has carefully considered all of the information, they will suggest a Plan to the owner to help the dog. Recommendations can include veterinary visits and owner homework, as well as follow-up massage sessions.|$|R
