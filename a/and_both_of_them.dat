5|$|Another myth current amongst Tamils {{says that}} the temple was {{renovate}}d by a legendary Chola king, Kullakotan. According to that myth, the king, who was afflicted with an incurable skin disease, was cured after taking a bath in the ruined temple’s holy pond. Following the miracle, the king went on to renovate the temple and created a community of temple caretakers to maintain the temple. The equivalent myth amongst the Sinhalese people indicates that the diseased king was Rajasinghe or Bhuvanekabahu and the king prayed to the presiding goddess who cured him of his affliction. There were at least two kings called Rajasinghe in Sri Lanka, <b>and</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> {{were involved in the}} actual renovations of the temple, and at least seven kings named Bhuvanekabahu, thereby making it difficult to identify the right king.|$|E

Governor George Clinton's faction in the New York legislature had chosen New York's other two delegates, John Lansing, Jr. and Robert Yates, <b>and</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> opposed Hamilton's goal of a strong national government. Thus, whenever the other two members of the New York delegation were present, they decided New York's vote, to ensure that there were no major alterations to the Articles of Confederation.|$|E

The temple -“Local Land God Temple”(伯公廟) established just beside the old tree is the belief center of the people there.
