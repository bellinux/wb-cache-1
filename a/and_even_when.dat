5|$|In 1639 William Keith, 7th Earl Marischal, {{came out}} {{in support of the}} Covenanters, a Presbyterian {{movement}} who opposed the established Episcopal Church and the changes which Charles I was attempting to impose. With James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose, he marched against the Catholic James Gordon, 2nd Viscount Aboyne, Earl of Huntly, and defeated an attempt by the Royalists to seize Stonehaven. However, when Montrose changed sides to the Royalists and marched north, Marischal remained in Dunnottar, even when given command of the area by Parliament, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>when</b> Montrose burned Stonehaven.|$|E
5|$|Narihira {{was not a}} {{profound}} poet. His surviving poems are mainly occasional, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>when</b> the expression suggests deeply felt emotion, its worldly manner keeps his poetry from attaining {{the grandeur of the}} best Man'yōshū poems in the same vein. He is nevertheless of historical importance as one who maintained the traditions of the waka during the long night of the dominance of poetry in Chinese.|$|E
5|$|The ban on English {{clubs in}} European {{competitions}} ultimately lasted for five years, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>when</b> the ban was lifted in 1990, Liverpool were not re-admitted; {{they had to}} serve an extra year. The ban prevented them qualifying for the European Cup in 1986 (as league champions and FA Cup winners), the UEFA Cup in 1987 (as league runners-up), the European Cup in 1988 (as league champions), the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1989 (as FA Cup winners) and the European Cup in 1990 (as league champions).|$|E

5|$|The {{chemical}} analysis that would definitively identify the dyes used in ancient textiles {{has rarely been}} conducted, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>when</b> a dye such as indigo blue is detected {{it is impossible to}} determine which of several indigo-bearing plants was used. Nevertheless, based on the colors of surviving textile fragments and the evidence of actual dyestuffs found in archaeological sites, reds, blues, and yellows from plant sources were in common use by the late Bronze Age and Iron Age.|$|E
5|$|A {{fungus gnat}} from New Zealand, Arachnocampa luminosa, {{lives in the}} predator-free {{environment}} of caves and its larvae emit bluish-green light. They dangle silken threads that glow and attract flying insects, and wind in their fishing-lines when prey becomes entangled. The bioluminescence of the larvae of another fungus gnat from North America which lives on streambanks and under overhangs has a similar function. Orfelia fultoni builds sticky little webs and emits light of a deep blue colour. It has an inbuilt biological clock <b>and,</b> <b>even</b> <b>when</b> kept in total darkness, turns its light on and off in a circadian rhythm.|$|E
5|$|Atomic nitrogen, {{also known}} as active nitrogen, is highly reactive, being a triradical with three {{unpaired}} electrons. Free nitrogen atoms easily react with most elements to form nitrides, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>when</b> two free nitrogen atoms collide to produce an excited N2 molecule, they may release so much energy on collision with even such stable molecules as carbon dioxide and water to cause homolytic fission into radicals such as CO and O or OH and H. Atomic nitrogen is prepared by passing an electric discharge through nitrogen gas at 0.1–2mmHg, which produces atomic nitrogen along with a peach-yellow emission that fades slowly as an afterglow for several minutes even after the discharge terminates.|$|E

5|$|Educational {{opportunities}} in emergency medicine {{are not available}} in many countries, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>when</b> present, they are often in their infancy. Botswana opened its first medical school in 2009, with a program in emergency medicine following in 2011. The program aims to train four to six physicians in emergency medicine each year. Limitations on in-country training mean that the program includes six months of training at an international site. The organization {{of the program is}} modeled on South Africa's program due to the similarities in resource constraints and disease burdens and the eagerness of College of Emergency Medicine of South Africa and Emergency Medicine Society of South Africa to support the expansion of emergency medicine. Two years of clinical practice are required before entering the residency program, as in the South African and Australian approaches.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, {{before a}} tour by the New Zealand rugby team, the South African {{government}} asked New Zealand to field an all-white team (thereby excluding Māori players); the New Zealand Rugby Football Union refused and cancelled the tour. As rugby was very popular among white South Africans, this caused concern in that community. The England cricket team was in New Zealand at the time, and Billy Griffith, {{by then the}} secretary of the MCC, when questioned said that the MCC would also cancel in similar circumstances. Despite these events in other world sports, South Africa continued to play international cricket. Efforts to put pressure on the International Cricket Conference (ICC) failed, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>when</b> South Africa withdrew from the Commonwealth in 1961 (theoretically forfeiting the national team's Test status), their traditional opponents continued to play official Tests against them despite opposition from India, Pakistan and the West Indies.|$|E
5|$|Vahan and his Byzantine commanders did {{not manage}} {{to deal with}} this mounted force and use the sizable {{advantage}} of their army effectively. Their own Byzantine cavalry never {{played a significant role in}} the battle and were held in static reserve for most of the six days. They never pushed their attacks <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>when</b> they obtained what could have been a decisive breakthrough on the fourth day, they were unable to exploit it. There appeared to be a decided lack of resolve among the Imperial commanders, though this may have been caused by difficulties commanding the army because of internal conflict. Moreover, many of the Arab auxiliaries were mere levies, while the Muslim Arab army consisted for a much larger part of veteran troops.|$|E

5|$|Linois's {{operations}} in the Indian Ocean have been compared to those of Captain Karl von Müller in SMS Emden 108 years later: like von Müller, Linois's raids caused significant concern among British merchant houses and the British authorities in the Indian Ocean, in Linois's case principally due to the threat he posed to the East Indiaman convoys such as that encountered off Pulo Aura. The practical effects of his raiding were however insignificant: in three years he took just five East Indiamen {{and a handful of}} country ships, briefly terrorising the Andhra coast in 1804 but otherwise failing to cause major economic disruption to British trade. The only achievement of his cruise was to force Rainier's squadron to operate in defence of British convoys and ports, preventing any offensive operations during Linois's time in the Indian Ocean. The vast distances between friendly ports, the lack of sufficient food supplies or naval stores and the strength of British naval escorts after the initial months of war all played a part in Linois's failings to fully exploit his opportunity, but the blame for his inadequate achievements has been consistently placed with Linois's own personal leadership failings, both among his contemporaries and by historians. In battle Linois refused to place his ships in danger if it could be avoided, he spent considerable periods of the cruise refitting at French harbours <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>when</b> presented with an undefended target was reluctant to press his advantage.|$|E
5|$|After his dad dies {{along with}} his wife, he nearly dies himself of {{overdose}} for guilt, since he told Cameron they're leaving, as he kills them. After he finds out who raped John Paul several months ago, {{the two of them}} have a fight and he drunkenly sleeps with Sinead. He's supportive to John Paul about his trial but he keeps taking drugs. After he discovers Tegan has a cancer, he gets high yet again in front of Amy and the kids. He then has a one-night stand with a man, he doesn't remember. By his and Lockie's fault, John Paul is sent to hospital because of the drugs. He decides to go to rehab. After that, he faces his abusive stepfather Terry and later proposes to John Paul, who accepts. They have a Christmas wedding, that is ruined when Sinead says she's expecting Ste's child. John Paul eventually forgives Ste and agrees to look after their baby with them. Ste then gets the devastating news that he's HIV positive, but John Paul sticks by his side. He is bothered with his friendship with Sinead and thinks they could be romantically involved, which Ste denies. Sinead falls in love with Ste and she wants to separate Ste and John Paul. She finds out John Paul kissed his student, Harry, Tony's son, unknowingly after one of their fights, and tries to frame him but Ste gets attacted in a hate crime. John Paul and Ste later split up and Sinead gives birth to their daughter, Hannah. Ste lives with them but is shocked when he overhears that Sinead loves him. After her heated words, he uses drugs again, but later pleads Sinead to not leave him and give them a chance as a couple, which confuses everyone. Ste than starts seeing Harry, even though he doesn't want to hurt Sinead. When she discovers, she leaves along with Hannah, which devastates Ste. He starts to date Harry behind Tony's back, but he is eventually found out. They later start dating for real but Ste breaks up with him as he thinks he's too young to be with someone like him. They later get back together but after Harry thinks he broke his promise not to take drugs and wants to end it with him, Ste accepts John Paul's offer to meet up and try again, but then when he sees Harry, John Paul understands he doesn't want him and Ste will end up with Harry. They live with Ste's sisters but Cameron, the man Leela had Peri with, doesn't want him with them and with false accusations, they both leave and become homeless. Later, when Ste is determinated to deal drugs again, Harry sleeps with another man for money. When Ste finds out the truth, they break up and Cameron gives him crystal meth. Ste becomes addicted <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>when</b> he and Harry get back together, he can't stop. When Harry finds out, he and Tony try to help him and get him into rehab.|$|E
