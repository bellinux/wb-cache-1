5|$|NGC 1664 is {{a fairly}} large open cluster, with <b>a</b> <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> 18 arcminutes, and {{moderately}} bright, with a magnitude of 7.6, comparable to several other open clusters in Auriga.

5|$|NGC 678 and NGC 680 are a pair {{of galaxies}} in Aries that are only about 200,000 light-years apart. Part of the NGC 691 group of galaxies, both are at a {{distance}} of approximately 130 million light-years. NGC 678 is an edge-on spiral galaxy that is 4.5 by 0.8 arcminutes. NGC 680, an elliptical galaxy with an asymmetrical boundary, is the brighter of the two at magnitude 12.9; NGC 678 has a magnitude of 13.35. Both galaxies have bright cores, but NGC 678 is the larger galaxy at <b>a</b> <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> 171,000 light-years; NGC 680 has <b>a</b> <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> 72,000 light-years. NGC 678 is further distinguished by its prominent dust lane. NGC 691 itself is a spiral galaxy slightly inclined to our line of sight. It has multiple spiral arms and a bright core. Because it is so diffuse, it has a low surface brightness. It has <b>a</b> <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> 126,000 light-years and is 124 million light-years away. NGC 877 is the brightest member of an 8-galaxy group that also includes NGC 870, NGC 871, and NGC 876, with a magnitude of 12.53. It is 2.4 by 1.8 arcminutes and is 178 million light-years away with <b>a</b> <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> 124,000 light-years. Its companion is NGC 876, which is about 103,000 light-years from the core of NGC 877. They are interacting gravitationally, as they are connected by a faint stream of gas and dust. Arp 276 is a different pair of interacting galaxies in Aries, consisting of NGC 935 and IC 1801.|$|E

5|$|In 1920, Albert Michelson and Francis Pease {{mounted a}} 6-meter {{interferometer}} {{on the front}} of the 2.5-meter telescope at Mount Wilson Observatory.

In spite of its relatively large size, however, lightcurve studies suggest that Hi'iaka is not a gravitationally collapsed spheroid; they further suggest that Hi'iaka is not tidally locked and has a rotation period of about 9.8 hours.|$|E
5|$|Located in {{the bottom}} of a narrow valley, the Nine Stones circle has <b>a</b> <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> 9.1 metres by 7.8 metres (29 feet 10 inches by 25 feet 11 inches).
