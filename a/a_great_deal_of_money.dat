5|$|One last Scottish attempt {{against the}} king's person {{occurred}} in August 1600, when James was apparently assaulted by Alexander Ruthven, the Earl of Gowrie's younger brother, at Gowrie House, {{the seat of}} the Ruthvens. Ruthven was run through by James's page John Ramsay and the Earl of Gowrie was killed in the ensuing fracas; there were few surviving witnesses. Given James's history with the Ruthvens {{and the fact that he}} owed them <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> <b>money,</b> his account of the circumstances was not universally believed.|$|E
5|$|Converting to evangelical Christianity in the 1880s, Sunday left {{baseball}} for the Christian ministry. He gradually developed his {{skills as a}} pulpit evangelist in the Midwest and then, during the early 20th century, he became the nation's most famous evangelist with his colloquial sermons and frenetic delivery. Sunday held widely reported campaigns in America's largest cities, and he attracted the largest crowds of any evangelist {{before the advent of}} electronic sound systems. He also made <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> and was welcomed into the homes of the wealthy and influential. Sunday was a strong supporter of Prohibition, and his preaching likely {{played a significant role in}} the adoption of the Eighteenth Amendment in 1919.|$|E

5|$|Once Nate {{emerges from}} the vessel, he and Sully are confronted by another {{treasure}} hunter named Gabriel Roman (Simon Templeman), to whom Sully owes <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> <b>money.</b> Backed by his partner, archaeologist Atoq Navarro (Robin Atkin Downes), Roman forces Nate {{to hand over the}} page and shoots Sully dead when he tries to intervene. Before he can kill Nate, a loose torpedo charge previously accidentally triggered by Nate causes the U-boat to explode, distracting the gang long enough for Drake to escape. He runs into Elena, who agrees to help him find the statue, and together they use Sully's plane to travel to the old colony.|$|E
5|$|Shelby {{was educated}} {{at the local}} schools in his native colony. He worked on his father's {{plantation}} and occasionally found work as a surveyor. At age eighteen he was appointed deputy sheriff of Frederick County. Shelby's father lost <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> when Pontiac's Rebellion disrupted his lucrative fur trade business, and two years later, the business' records were destroyed in a house fire. Consequently, in December 1770 {{the family moved to}} the area near Bristol, Tennessee, where they built a fort and a trading post. Here, Shelby and his father worked for three years herding cattle.|$|E

Tony confronts Ralph the following morning and Ralph denies setting the fire. The two engage in a violent brawl, culminating in Tony strangling Ralph to death. Tony and Christopher dispose of the body; they bury his head and hands at Mikey Palmice's father's farm and throw his body into a quarry.|$|E

5|$|Despite these successes, {{the number}} of {{innovations}} introduced {{at the same time}} made the class unreliable and difficult to maintain. <b>A</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> was wasted on resolving the problems of a class designed for duties that could have been undertaken by cheaper 2-6-2 or 4-6-0 mixed-traffic locomotives. Likewise, more Light Pacifics were built than were needed, frequently undertaking tasks that would usually befit a much smaller locomotive. A curious but common sight west of Exeter during the winter months was a Light Pacific hauling a local stopping service with a single carriage to destinations as diverse as Padstow and Wadebridge. Finally, too much money was spent on the expensive rebuilding programme when dieselisation and modernisation meant the locomotives would have very limited lives in their new guise.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} later, the shark kills {{a young boy}} named Alex Kintner and an old man {{not far from the}} shore. A local fisherman, Ben Gardner, is sent by Amity's {{authorities}} to kill the shark but disappears on the water. Brody and deputy Leonard Hendricks find Gardner's boat anchored off-shore, empty, and covered with large bite holes, one of which has a massive shark tooth stuck in it. Blaming himself for these deaths, Brody again tries to close the beaches, while Meadows investigates the Mayor's business contacts to determine why he wants to keep the beaches open. Meadows uncovers links to the Mafia, who pressure Vaughn to keep the beaches open {{in order to protect the}} value of Amity's real estate, in which the Mafia invested <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> <b>money.</b> Meadows also recruits marine biologist Matt Hooper from the Woods Hole Institute to advise them on how to deal with the shark.|$|E

Both campaigns spent <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>of</b> <b>money,</b> {{making it one of}} the most expensive statewide races in North Carolina history.|$|E
