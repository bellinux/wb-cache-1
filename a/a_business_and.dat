5000|$|An uninformed {{observation}} about incentives {{could lead}} one {{to the conclusion that}} a jurisdiction or local community with <b>a</b> weak <b>business</b> <b>and</b> employment base tends to offer more favorable incentives than one with <b>a</b> strong <b>business</b> <b>and</b> employment base. Although this correlation exists in certain instances, {{it is by no means}} an accurate reflection in each case of the approach public bodies take in allocating incentives to private enterprises. [...] For instance, a state with <b>a</b> strong <b>business</b> <b>and</b> employment base can leverage its financial position to offer incentive packages to <b>a</b> certain <b>business</b> class as <b>a</b> way to participate in <b>an</b> emerging national <b>business</b> sector. Similarly, <b>a</b> municipality with <b>a</b> weak <b>business</b> <b>and</b> employment base can be reticent to offer economic development incentives because of financial and political consequences. A municipality fitting this profile, however, could be receptive to providing incentives based on new project taxes, not otherwise available to it, generated by the recipient.|$|R
