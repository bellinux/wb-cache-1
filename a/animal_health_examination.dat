40|$|Salmonellosis is a {{frequently}} diagnosed {{infectious disease}} of passerine birds in garden habitats within Great Britain with potential implications for human and domestic <b>animal</b> <b>health.</b> Postmortem <b>examinations</b> {{were performed on}} 1, 477 garden bird carcasses of circa 50 species from England and Wales, 1999 to 2007 inclusive. Salmonellosis was confirmed in 263 adult birds of 10 passerine species in this 11 -year longitudinal study. A subset of 124 fully biotyped Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium isolates was examined using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis to investigate the hypothesis that these strains are host adapted and to determine whether this molecular technique offers greater resolution in understanding the epidemiology of Salmonella Typhimurium infection than phage typing alone. For the two most common phage types, definitive type (DT) 40 and DT 56 v, which together accounted for 97 % (120 / 124) of isolates, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis groupings closely correlated with phage type with remarkably few exceptions. A high degree of genetic similarity (> 90 %) was observed within and between the two most common pulsed-field gel electrophoresis groups. No clustering or variation {{was found in the}} pulsed-field gel electrophoresis groupings by bird species, year, or geographical region beyond that revealed by phage typing. These findings support the hypothesis that there are currently two host-adapted Salmonella phage types, S. Typhimurium DT 40 and DT 56 v, circulating widely in British garden birds and that the reservoir of infection is maintained within wild bird populations. Large-scale multilocus sequence typing studies are required to further investigate the epidemiology of this infection...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – A <b>health</b> <b>examination</b> {{is one of}} {{important}} events for freshmen when they enter a university. Consequently, the quality and time required for the examination are components in any index measuring the service performance of a university. However, performance measure for the <b>health</b> <b>examination</b> with a performance index is comparatively seldom. This paper aims to provide an index to measure <b>health</b> <b>examination</b> performance for freshmen. Design/methodology/approach – A <b>health</b> <b>examination</b> performance index (HEPI) is defined for a university’s <b>health</b> <b>examination</b> procedure. To make accurate use of the HEPI in assessing <b>health</b> <b>examination</b> performance, this paper constructs a uniformly minimum variance unbiased (UMVU) estimator of the HEPI using an exponential distribution to develop a hypothesis testing procedure. Findings – Since <b>health</b> <b>examination</b> time exhibits the smaller-the-better type quality characteristic of time orientation, the HEPI is appropriate for evaluating the hospital’s performance in providing freshmen <b>health</b> <b>examinations.</b> This study also investigates {{the relationship between the}} HEPI and the non-conformance rate of <b>health</b> <b>examination</b> performance, and tabulates the non-conformance rate under the exponential distribution. Originality/value – The proposed testing procedure is easily applied and can accurately evaluate whether the true <b>health</b> <b>examination</b> performance for a hospital meets a university’s requirement.

Outcomes of 1651 <b>health</b> <b>examinations,</b> including import, pre-export, first and routine <b>health</b> <b>examinations,</b> were recorded and analysed. At least one problem was found in 45. 7 % of <b>health</b> <b>examinations,</b> with subsequent action (such as treatment, follow-up or further diagnostics) required in just under half of those animals or 21. 1 % of <b>health</b> <b>examinations</b> overall. A problem was identified in 52. 1 % of import examinations as opposed to 32. 5 % of pre-export examinations, and in 52. 2 % of routine examinations, compared to 33. 6 % of first examinations. When analysed further by taxon, these differences were not significant for all taxa.

40|$|Abstract—In recent years, {{with the}} {{development}} of the economy and the advancement of the national income, personal healthcare has been becoming an important issue. Since the <b>health</b> <b>examination</b> can help people understand their own health conditions clearly, many people make regularly <b>health</b> <b>examinations</b> to avoid missing the best treatment time. So the <b>health</b> <b>examination</b> is an important role for people’s health statuses. However, people only get aware of the result of <b>health</b> <b>examination</b> report but they are not clear whether their health trends are high-risk or not. In this paper, we proposed a novel framework for discovering health risk patterns and the relationships between the health risk patterns and some target diseases by mining historic <b>health</b> <b>examination</b> data. Moreover, a prediction model can be constructed effectively by the analyzed information for the target disease. At last, the physicians can early provide health alerts and medical treatments for people to effectively increase the quality of disease prevention by the analyzed information...|$|R
30|$|Training in {{livestock}} health {{provision was}} reported by respondents (58.8  %) as a strategy to reduce risks associated with recurrent drought and livestock diseases. The increased number of trained, community-based <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> workers now operating in Turkana areas is an important <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> delivery channel in this marginal area (Mugunieri et al. 2004). Of the livestock keepers who had treated their animals, 85  % claimed to have gained skills, training, and knowledge from the community-based <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> workers. Traditionally the control of livestock diseases was {{through the use of}} local herbs and local techniques; these practices seem to have changed with the emergence of trained community-based <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> workers. Key informants revealed that many youth with <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> care skills are able to support their families with income earned from the sale of veterinary drugs and from attending to sick animals. But owing to the limited training and literacy of community-based <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> workers, these medical providers have been perceived by professional veterinarians and government officials {{as a threat to the}} provision of adequate <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> services (Mugunieri et al. 2004).|$|R
40|$|The {{quantity}} of research information being made {{available on the}} World Wide Web in various disciplines is increasing tremendously. This study examined the coverage of <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> information published on the web from Africa or about Africa. Challenges and opportunities of publishing and disseminating <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> information online in Africa were also examined. Websites and online databases which offer agricultural information {{were included in the}} analysis, but the main focus was on research, education and extension information in the core areas of <b>animal</b> <b>health.</b> Content analysis method was used to determine what agricultural academic indexing and abstracting databases have in terms of quality researched <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> information published from Africa or about Africa. Well-known databases, such as AGRICOLA, AGRIS, CAB Direct, PUBMED and Cochrane Library were investigated. The criteria used to determine the African <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> information included the content of research <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> information available on the website, {{how easy it is to}} locate information once the site has been located, the usefulness of the information, and how current and up-to-date the information is. It was found that the representation of African <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> information on the web is generally low. The poor coverage of <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> information on the web emanates from many factors: poor ICT (Information Communications Technology) infrastructure in many African countries, lack of ICT literacy, awareness and mindset, lack of recognition of all the values of information services, poor state of African indexing and abstracting services, inadequate funds, and perceived misconceptions of actual causes of the problem. Thus, this situation has led to the web being dominated by the <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> information from developed countries. Despite the challenges faced by African researchers in publishing their research findings on the web, most <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> scholars collaborate well with some international organizations in disseminating <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> information on the web.

40|$|Aims: <b>Health</b> Insurance <b>health</b> <b>examination</b> centres {{should help}} {{encourage}} incorporation of socially vulnerable {{people into the}} healthcare system. The aim of this enquiry was to document results obtained by administration of <b>health</b> <b>examinations</b> to such people. Methods: A sample group of socially vulnerable people was monitored {{over a period of}} {{six months to a year}} after <b>health</b> <b>examinations</b> were carried out at <b>health</b> <b>examination</b> centres. Results of examinations were documented either by the treating physician (by letter) or by the person him or herself (by letter or by telephone interview). Reasons for follow-up were suspected hypertension or diabetes, uncontrolled obesity, need of buccodental care, lack of anti-tetanus vaccination, and absence of mammographic screening. Results: In this group, 389 socially vulnerable subjects were monitored at 11 <b>health</b> <b>examination</b> centres. After six months, 81. 5 % of them had consulted a physician, 55. 6 % had updated their anti-tetanus vaccinations and 44. 6 % had sought dental treatment.

40|$|The {{way that}} an {{economist}} and an <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> professional use economics differs and creates frustrations. The economist is {{in search of}} optimizing resource allocation {{in the management of}} <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> and disease problems with metrics associated with the productivity of key societal resources of labour and capital. The <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> professional have a strong belief that productivity can be improved with the removal of pathogens. These differences restrict how well economics is used in <b>animal</b> <b>health,</b> and the question posed is whether this matters. The paper explores the question by looking at the changing role of animals in society and the associated change of the <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> professional's activities. It then questions if the current allocation of scarce resources for <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> are adequately allocated for societies and whether currently available data are sufficient for good allocation. A rapid review of the data on disease impacts - production losses and costs of human reaction - indicate that the data are sparse collected in different times and geographical regions. This limits what can be understood on the productivity of the economic resources used for <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> and this needs to be addressed with more systematic collection of data on disease losses and costs of <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> systems. Ideally such a process should learn lessons from the way that human health has made estimates of the burden of diseases and their capture of data on the costs of human health systems. Once available data on the global burden of animal diseases and the costs of <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> systems would allow assessments of individual disease management processes and the productivity of wider productivity change.

40|$|It {{is argued}} that while {{considerable}} development of <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> economics has occurred in recent decades, {{it has not yet}} achieved its potential coverage. It has been mostly applied to livestock, particularly livestock used for commerce, and its application to a range of other animals has been relatively neglected. Extending its coverage also requires widening the type of objectives taken into account in the analysis. Furthermore, the main focus of <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> economics has been on the economics of controlling and managing the occurrence of diseases. The economic role of genetics, the environment, nutrition and the comfort of <b>animals</b> in their <b>health</b> ought to be given greater attention. In the case of zoonoses, the economic analysis should be extended to take into account human <b>health.</b> Those studying <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> economics need to make decisions in their analysis about its spatial dimensions, its time dimensions, and the stakeholders to be considered. They must also take into account health chains and make allowances for risk and uncertainty. The economics of knowledge (including, for example, information economics and research and development) is worthy of more attention in <b>animal</b> <b>health</b> economics.
