40|$|We {{consider}} {{the interaction between}} human capital accumulation and inequality in South Africa. We start by discussing three alternative theoretical frameworks that relate inequality and investment decisions in post-secondary education; namely the 'perfect credit markets hypothesis', the 'imperfect credit markets hypothesis' and the 'social externalities hypothesis'. Each of these suggests different policy implications. We then consider which of these {{seems to have the}} most validity in the South African context, by presenting some original analysis as well as considering some of the related literature. Our findings suggest that South Africa is indeed in an 'inequality trap' situation and that credit markets do not work well. There is some evidence that social externalities compound the effects of the imperfect credit markets. We conclude with a discussion of possible policy directions. These include information on eligibility to tertiary institutes of education, awareness campaigns regarding public financing options, subsidization of <b>application</b> <b>and</b> <b>registration</b> fees and efforts to improve school quality at the primary and secondary levels.

40|$|Water-saving {{technologies}} such as alternate wetting and drying (AWD) provide a way to change practices to improve the livelihoods of many rice farmers and AWD is {{regarded as one of}} the more important rice cultivation methods that can dramatically save freshwater irrigation in this century. AWD not only conserves water but also mitigates greenhouse gas emissions. The global climate influence of gases, particularly methane, and resulting reduction in methane emissions by adjusted water management practice through AWD may provide the means for rice to adapt to water scarcity and at the same time mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. With these associated benefits, AWD technology could be harnessed for a Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). This paper will discuss the merits of AWD and explore the possibility of being a CDM for areas affected by water shortage in the Angat dam and reservoir. This document has three parts: - A literature review of AWD and CDM - An in-depth assessment of possible AWD dissemination in Angat reservoir - Appendices comprising documents that will be needed in the process of <b>application</b> <b>and</b> <b>registration</b> of an envis- aged CDM project in Angat reservoi...|$|E
40|$|Distance {{learning}} {{in developing countries}} {{has emerged as a}} way of widening access to education for tertiary applicants who qualify but could not otherwise gain admission due to the limited space in the existing tertiary institutions. The delivery of the program in Ghana, a developing country in Africa, is predominantly print-based and is supported with regular face-to-face tutorials. In this process students face several challenges that could be supported with information and communication technology (ICT). The study looked at the extent to which, at their personal level, students utilize the few ICT facilities that are available in their localities that could form a basis for making a case for the use of interactive electronic platforms in the distance learning programs. The results revealed that both male and female learners have some access to and utilize ICT facilities. They have moderate knowledge and usage of the Internet. Distance {{learning in}}stitutions in developing countries could, therefore, take opportunity of this and gradually introduce some basic ICT applications such as e-mails, text messages, phone contacts, a website for providing detailed information, <b>application</b> <b>and</b> <b>registration,</b> uploading and downloading supplementary readers and other services to facilitate interaction among learners and the institutions. This way not only will quality be enhanced but also those in the remotest parts of developing countries could be conveniently reached.

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the torque and detorque values of screw intermediates of external hexagon, internal hexagon, and Morse taper implants in single restorations before and after mechanical cycling. Materials and Methods: The study sample was divided into three groups (n = 10) as follows: group EH – external hexagon implant, group IH – internal hexagon implant, and group MT – Morse taper implant. Universal abutments were screwed on the implants, and metal crowns were cemented onto the abutment. The samples were submitted to a mechanical testing of 1 million cycles, with a frequency of 8 cycles per second under a 400 N load. The <b>application</b> <b>and</b> <b>registration</b> of the screw torque (T 0) and detorque (T 1) values of the intermediate were performed before and after the test. The results were statistically evaluated by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey’s test (α  =  0. 05).  Results: There was no difference between the values of T 0 and T 1 in the intra‑group samples. However, the inter‑group difference in T 0 between the EH (12. 8 N cm) and MT (18. 6 N cm) groups and in T 1 between the EH (10. 4 N cm) and IH (13. 8 N cm), EH and MT (19. 4 N cm), and MT and IH (P  =  0. 001)   groups were significant.

30|$|First, let us {{look into}} the open {{innovation}} of three firms. Samsung’s OI strategy is in total contrast to that of Apple’s. Most core components of the hardwares of the smartphone depend on self-production (i.e., processor, camera module, display, and communication module, are all produced by Samsung, with its own assembly line operation) and assembly in the cities of Suwon, Asan, Tangjeong, and Gumi in Korea. Furthermore, almost all smartphone hardware production personnel are full-time workers. By retaining {{a large number of}} smartphone hardware research personnel, Samsung gained second position after IBM for achievements in patent <b>applications</b> <b>and</b> <b>registrations</b> in the U.S. In this area, Samsung is fully focused on self-development (R&D, production, and assembly) of the four major components, based on closed innovation. This closed innovation strategy enabled very rapid development of new models of smartphone hardware. Samsung has used a strategy of diversification to various sizes and styles of hardware, and has created new markets based on five-inch smartphones and the smart pencil.|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been growing {{interest}} {{in the area of}} open source software (“OSS”) as an alternative economic model. However, the success of the OSS mindshare and collaborative online experience has wider implications to many other fields of human endeavor than the mere licensing of computer programmes. There are a growing number of institutions interested in using OSS licensing schemes to distribute creative works and scientific research, and even to publish online journals through open access (“OA”) licenses. There appears to be growing concern in the scientific community about the trend to fence and protect scientific research through intellectual property, particularly by the abuse of patent applications for biotechnology research. The OSS experience represents a successful model which demonstrates that IP licenses could eventually be used to protect against the misuse and misappropriation of basic scientific research. This would be done by translating existing OSS licenses to protect scientific research. Some efforts are already paying dividends in areas such as scientific publishing, evidenced by the growing number of OA journals. However, the process of translating software licenses to areas other than publishing has been more difficult. OSS and OA licenses work best with works subject to copyright protection because copyright subsists in an original work as soon as it is created. However, it has been more difficult to generate a license that covers patented works because patents are only awarded through a lengthy <b>application</b> <b>and</b> <b>registration</b> process. If the open science experiment is to work, it needs the intervention of the legal community to draft new licenses that may apply to scientific research. This article will look at the issue of such OA licenses, paying special care as to how the system can best be exported to scientific research based on OSS and OA ideals...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper was to {{investigate}} the nature of part-time student provision within DIT, using policy and strategy documents. The purpose was also to investigate the needs of part-time students and following these considerations provide recommendations for the future development of part-time student education at DIT as part of the Masters in Education - Education Policy Module. The first section of this paper examines the background and context of part-time and flexible learning opportunities in the literature. It makes comparisons between the numbers following part-time education programmes as opposed to full-time education programmes and highlights that only 18 % of students studying at DIT in 2010 – 2011 were studying part-time. The next section analyses the opportunities and challenges in the provision of part-time education and suggests {{that there are a number}} of avenues available in the delivery of part-time education which include; the time it takes to complete a programme of study, blocking of modules, and summer schools as opportunities. However, this paper also presents the challenges impacting on part-time education and reviews the challenges for students and the challenges facing the Dublin Institute of Technology in the provision of part-time education. The deepening recession, lack of resources and the financial constraints appear to be major challenges. Section three presents the needs of part-time and life-long learning students and highlight the profile of the typical part-time student at DIT. This was carried out from an analysis of existing literature and from a number of research studies carried out on part-time education in DIT. The reasons students partake in part-time education are documented and include the need to develop skills to enhance a career, develop skills to change career or to begin a career as driving forces for returning to part-time education. The circumstances where students’ needs are not met are highlighted in this section. An analysis of the benefits of part-time education is also highlighted. Conclusions are drawn to this research paper and some future recommendations are provided where it is suggested that an integrated <b>application</b> <b>and</b> <b>registration</b> systems platform be developed for part-time students, a dedicated registration desk be open on each campus during the first month of study for part-time programmes and that a timely implementation of the communications plan for part-time programmes be carried out...|$|E

40|$|Students {{attending}} {{community colleges}} {{are faced with a}} variety of complex procedures and decisions. They must not only navigate financial aid <b>applications</b> <b>and</b> <b>registration</b> but also choose the type of credential they will pursue, their major (often from among hundreds) and the courses they will enroll in (often from among thousands). At the same time, they must take into account how course choices serve their long-term goals as well as their immediate logistical needs; for instance, some courses may count for financial aid purposes but not for graduation, or for graduation but not transfer. For many community college students—a significant portion of whom are the first in their family to attend college—these tasks appear to be insurmountable hurdles. The sheer number of choices students face can lead them to stumble. Students may waste time and money on unnecessary courses; they may miss a financial aid deadline. These stumbles can contribute to a sense that they do not “belong” in college. Advisors help students make choices in a complex environment, often by explaining {{the costs and benefits of}} each available option, and they guide students to additional resources that will help them make good decisions...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the changes in}} the core technology fields in corporate research and development (R&D) activities, the relationships between and among the different fields of technology, and so forth, focusing primarily on exploitation of patent data, which have finally been developed as a usable research resource in Japan. Although there are certain differences depending on the technology field, significant correlations are generally seen between the composition of patent applications by type of technology and the composition of patent registration by type of technology. In other words, it has been found that "selection and concentration" of technology fields have hardly occurred in the process from patent application to patent registration. This is, we find, a phenomenon that can be observed regardless of sector and time. Moreover, when we focus on core technology areas on a corporate level, rather than on a sectoral level, composition by type of technology remains same in patent <b>applications</b> <b>and</b> <b>registrations,</b> with no notable changes observed in the core technology areas. This indicates that the relationship observed between patent <b>applications</b> <b>and</b> <b>registration</b> on a sectoral level is applicable to analysis on a corporate level. Changes in each technology area are not an independent phenomenon. Instead, {{they are part of the}} continuing process of co-evolution in various technology areas. That is, each technology area changes through interaction with other technology areas; these technologies influence one another both within and beyond organizational boundaries. We analyze the relationship among different technology areas, using several new methodologies and focusing on the long-term relationships among different technology areas within a company. Specifically, we demonstrate that the cluster analysis of technology domains within a company and the analysis of relationships among these domains can be done using the concept of IPC Co-occurrence (i. e., by examining the extent to which a single patent is assigned to more than one International Patent Classification code, indicating different technology areas). Then, focusing on a longer time span, we attempt to analyze technology trajectories within the company. With respect to Canon Inc., presented as a first case, we find that the company rapidly expanded its business, in principle, by building on existing core technologies, thereby incrementally developing new technologies in related technology areas, which leads to new business areas. We call such diversification of core technologies the "proximal diversification model. " Meanwhile, regarding Takeda Pharmaceutical Co., a second case, we analyze changes in technology trajectories and the process of fusion of these technology trajectories. We find that the company, at least for some time after a new disruptive technology called genetic engineering came into being, intentionally implemented an information shield between the team in charge of new technologies and those in charge of the existing technologies. Then, after a sufficient period of time, the company integrated the newly developed technologies into the existing core technologies. This approach is believed to be effective in overcoming technology gaps. We call this the "venture insert model. "...|$|R
