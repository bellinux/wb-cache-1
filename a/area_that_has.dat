5|$|Part IV {{of the act}} {{covers the}} {{delegation}} of powers to agents, and the trustees liability for their acts. This is an <b>area</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> long been criticised by practitioners and academics, particularly {{the provisions of the}} Trustee Act 1925. The Act allowed the trustees to appoint an agent in good faith, and gave them no liability for the agent's acts. In Re Vickery it was confirmed that a trustee may escape liability for an agent's acts if he acted in good faith, which was simply a test of honesty rather than reasonableness.|$|E

5|$|Seven {{decades after}} the initial siege, on 28 August 1521, the fort was finally {{captured}} by Ottoman Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent and his 250,000 soldiers and over 100 ships subsequently, {{most of the city}} was razed to the ground and its entire Orthodox Christian population was deported to Istanbul, to an <b>area</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> since become known as the Belgrade forest. Belgrade was made the seat of the district (Sanjak), becoming the second largest Ottoman town in Europe at over 100,000 people, surpassed only by Constantinople. Ottoman rule also introduced Ottoman architecture, including numerous mosques, increasing the city's Oriental influences. In 1594, a major Serb rebellion was crushed by the Ottomans. Later, Grand vizier Sinan Pasha ordered the relics of Saint Sava to be publicly torched on the Vračar plateau; in the 20th century, the Temple of Saint Sava was built to commemorate this event.|$|E

This hall, the , was used by the emperor and courtiers presiding over activities in the Buraku-in. However, like the Chōdō-in, the Buraku-in also fell gradually into disuse as many functions were moved to the Dairi.

The Mass Rapid Transit Corporation (MRTC), later renamed as SMRT Corporation— was established on 14 October 1983; it took over the roles and responsibilities (which was the construction and operation the MRT system) of the former provisional Mass Rapid Transit Authority. On 7 November 1987, {{the first section of}} the North South Line started operations, consisting of five stations over six kilometres. Fifteen more stations were opened later, and the MRT system was officially launched on 12 March 1988 by then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew.
