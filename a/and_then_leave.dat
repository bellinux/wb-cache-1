5|$|While killing {{raccoons}} {{is legal}} during the hunting season, typically September to February, some hunters merely tree the raccoon <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>leave</b> it unharmed. In competitive hunts, where {{the objective is}} to demonstrate the skill of the dog, killing or harming the raccoon will often result in disqualification. Hunting for the sport without killing the raccoon, which is equated to catch and release fishing, or chasing raccoons from crop fields is legal year-round.|$|E

In the Feast or Fired match, four {{briefcases}} are held above four different turnbuckles on poles, with three having future title shots for the TNA World Heavyweight, TNA X Division, and TNA World Tag Team Championships; the remaining briefcase holds a pink slip, leading to that wrestler's contract termination. A wrestler must retrieve the briefcase <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>leave</b> the ring {{in order to}} gain official possession of the case. The participants in the bout were Scott Steiner, Senshi, B.G. James, Petey Williams, Shark Boy, Lance Hoyt, Christopher Daniels, Elix Skipper, Homicide, Hernandez, Kip James, Jimmy Rave, Chris Harris, and Sonjay Dutt. The contest lasted eleven minutes and fifty-five seconds. Christy Hemme accompanied Rave and Hoyt to the ring for the contest. Williams was the first to obtain a case in the match. Kip was the second; however he threw it to his Voodoo Kin Mafia tag team partner B.G. James who was standing at ringside, thus giving B.G. James possession of the case. A short time later, Senshi retrieved the third case. The final case was collected by Steiner, after he took it from Kip, who had taken it from the retriever Daniels.|$|E

25|$|Abu Bakr's {{strategy}} was to give his generals their mission, the geographical area in which that mission would be carried out, and the resources that, could be made available for that purpose. He would then leave it to his generals to accomplish their missions in whatever manner they chose. On the other hand, Caliph Umar {{in the latter part}} of his Caliphate used to direct his generals as to where they would stay and when to move to the next target and who was to be commanding the left and right wing of the army in each particular battle. This made the phase of conquest comparatively slower but provided well-organized campaigns.

25|$|There is {{not much}} data on the {{reproduction}} of A. ocellaris. However, similar behaviors throughout all anemone fishes have been recorded. These fish have monogamous mating systems, and are territorial of their anemone. Males become more aggressive during spawning. Male behavior also changes to attract females: biting, chasing, fin extension. Before spawning, the male prepares the nest near the anemone (so that the tentacles of the anemone can protect the nest). After the male chases the female to the nest, the female begins the spawning process. She lays eggs for about one to two hours, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>leave</b> the nest for the male to fertilize the eggs. The eggs take approximately six to eight days to hatch (this time period can {{be affected by the}} temperature of water). Because of the external fertilization, males usually care for the eggs. They also have responsibilities for eating fungi-infected or infertile eggs, and fanning the eggs.|$|E

25|$|In early 1978, Medina was {{appointed}} the UFW's organizing director. In {{his first three}} months in office, the union won 13 elections and added more than 3,000 new members. He also changed the way the UFW approached strikes. In the past, the union would strike but end the walkout once the union had won the organizing election (held under the procedures of the California Agricultural Labor Relations Act). Employers would then file numerous appeals to the election, and over the many months (and sometimes years) it took for the appeals to be heard the union's support would vanish. Medina's new strategy {{was to keep the}} workers on strike even after the organizing election was won; this pressured employers to waive their legal right to appeal, recognize the union, and enter collective bargaining neogtiations immediately. If negotiations stalled, Medina's back-up strategy was ask union members to perform their jobs sloppily <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>leave</b> work. The employer would institute a lockout, a strike would begin, and the employer would return to the bargaining table to get the harvest in.|$|E
25|$|The Corrupted Blood {{incident}} {{was described as}} a fascinating yet accidental case study of modeling disease origins and control at the Games for Health conference in Baltimore, Maryland by Gamasutra. They compared it to a real-life epidemic, in that it originated in a remote, uninhabited region and was carried by travelers to larger regions; hosts were both human and animal, comparing it to the avian flu; was passed through close contact; and there were people, in this case non-playable characters, who could contract it but were asymptomatic. However, there were elements that differed from a real-world epidemic, including an indicator for carriers that they have the disease and how much risk they are at, which cannot be done in the real world. One aspect of the epidemic that was not considered by epidemiologists in their models was curiosity, describing how players would rush into infected areas to witness the infection and then rush out. This was paralleled to real-world behavior, specifically with how journalists would cover an incident, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>leave</b> the area.|$|E
