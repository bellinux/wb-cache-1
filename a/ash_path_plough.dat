50|$|Crofton has had {{a makeover}} {{in the last few}} years. Mainly the old Nostell pit and {{surrounding}} area have been transformed into a nature park with a small pond and walking areas which many locals use. The walk comprises around 3-4 miles of <b>ash</b> <b>path</b> from start to finish, with some being concreted (remnants of the old opencast mining area). The path can be followed on foot or by bike, right to the Trans-Pennine Trail and through Walton Forest. Use in some years is marred by surges in the tick population, which particularly affects dog walkers and farm cattle.|$|R
50|$|In the 2001 census Carleton St Peter {{contained}} just 15 {{households and}} {{a population of}} 29 spread across the 3.19 km2 of the parish. The church cannot be reached by road and sits in a small graveyard {{in the middle of}} a field reached by a short <b>path</b> between <b>ploughed</b> fields. The tower contains four bells but they cannot be rung.|$|R
25|$|Since Menelaus's wedding, Odysseus {{had married}} Penelope and fathered a son, Telemachus. In {{order to avoid}} the war, he feigned madness and sowed his fields with salt. Palamedes outwitted him by placing his infant son in front of the <b>plough's</b> <b>path,</b> and Odysseus turned aside, unwilling to kill his son, so {{revealing}} his sanity and forcing him to join the war.|$|R

Ploughs were {{traditionally}} taken around by Plough Monday mummers and molly dancers in parts of Eastern England and in some places were used as a threat: if householders refused to donate to the participants their front <b>path</b> would be <b>ploughed</b> up.|$|R

50|$|The Kammweg ("Ridgeway") was {{a long-distance}} path opened in 1904 along {{the crest of}} the Elster Mountains, Ore Mountains, Bohemian Switzerland, Lusatian Mountains, Ještěd Mountains, Jizera and Giant Mountains, Śnieżnik Mountains and High <b>Ash</b> Mountains. This <b>path</b> was once the longest tourist trail in the German-speaking region of Europe. Since 2011 the ridgeway {{tradition}} has been continued with the Ore Mountains-Vogtland Ridgeway (Kammweg Erzgebirge-Vogtland), which runs on the German side of the border.|$|R
50|$|After {{returning}} to Kanto {{and participating in}} the Battle Frontier challenge, Ash battles with his rival, Gary. After seeing a Pokémon {{he has never seen}} before, Ash decides to travel to the Sinnoh region. At the beginning of the next season, Ash travels with Brock, one final time, to the Sinnoh Region, with May and Max going on their own <b>paths.</b> <b>Ash</b> and Brock meet Dawn (Hikari), another Pokémon Coordinator, who travels with them as they go through Sinnoh where they must defeat Cyrus and his Team Galactic.|$|R
60|$|When mere {{space and}} the stoop of the high sky begin to overwhelm, earth {{provides}} little ponds and lakes, lying in soft-flanked hollows, where people can step {{down out of the}} floods of air, and delight themselves with small and known distances. Most of the women I saw about the houses were down in the hollows, and most of the men were on the crests and the flats. Once, while we halted a woman drove straight down at us from the sky-line, along a golden <b>path</b> between black <b>ploughed</b> lands. When the horse, who managed affairs, stopped at the cars, she nodded mysteriously, and showed us a very small baby in the hollow of her arm. Doubtless she was some exiled Queen flying North to found a dynasty and establish a country. The Prairie makes everything wonderful.|$|R
50|$|Much of {{the western}} part of Carnoustie is post-war. The main road {{in this part of the}} town is known as 'Barry Road' and towards its eastern end there are a group of weavers cottages that pre-date the {{expansion}} of the town and used to belong to the hamlet of Hunterstown. Leading south from here, is Panmure Street, which leads to the Panmure Institute and, behind it, the Panmure Works. The Panmure Institute is now known as the Panmure Centre and owned by Angus Council for their Community Learning and Development Centre. The factory building was restored in the late 1990s and now houses the building firm DJ Laing. At the end of Barry Road, the road diverts to the north slightly at the Corner Hotel, before continuing eastwards along Dundee Street. This corner, which used to be known as Hutton's corner, is where a rocky outcrop blocked the <b>path</b> of the <b>plough</b> when the road was originally marked out in the 18th century.|$|R
40|$|In any crisis, {{there is}} a great deal of uncertainty, often {{geographical}} uncertainty or, more precisely, spatiotemporal uncertainty. Examples include the spread of contamination from an industrial accident, drifting volcanic <b>ash,</b> and the <b>path</b> of a hurricane. Estimating spatiotemporal probabilities is usually a difficult task, but that is not our primary concern. Rather, we ask how analysts can communicate spatiotemporal uncertainty to those handling the crisis. We comment on the somewhat limited literature on the representation of spatial uncertainty on maps. We note that many cognitive issues arise and that the potential for confusion is high. We note that in the early stages of handling a crisis, the uncertainties involved may be deep, i. e., difficult or impossible to quantify in the time available. In such circumstance, we suggest the idea of presenting multiple scenarios...|$|R
50|$|As Professor Knowby {{attempts}} {{to escape the}} cabin, he is killed by the younger Ruby of year 1982, who then retrieves the Necronomicon. Henrietta murders Tanya, and battles Ash, but is ultimately defeated once more. Ash reunites with Ruby and Kelly to confront the younger Ruby. The present Ruby warns her younger self that following Baal {{is not the right}} path and cautions her to build a better future. The young Ruby proceeds to stab the present one with the kandarian dagger, who then uses the book to knock her younger self unconscious. As the older Ruby now lays dying, she tells Ash and Kelly to take the book and return to the present. Ruby tells Kelly to build her own life for herself and to forge her own <b>path.</b> <b>Ash</b> and Kelly leave and return to the Oldsmobile to find Pablo alive.|$|R

5000|$|Upon its release, Chelsea Light Moving {{received}} positive critical acclaim. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 77, based on 31 reviews, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews." [...] Allmusic's Fred Thomas rated the album {{three and a}} half out of five stars and praised many of its features, describing it as [...] "fun, huge, and pleasantly confused ... but ultimately just another chapter in Moore's lifelong exploration of sound, poetry, and the darkest corners of American subcultures he helped build." [...] Ryan Bray of Consequence of Sound's review speculated upon the link between the album's sense of angst and Moore's then-recent separation from wife and Sonic Youth bandmate, Kim Gordon, stating [...] "there's a volatile undercurrent to the songs ... It's easy to suspect that Moore's personal ups and downs had a hand in shaping the album's terse temperament, and the record affirms the sleeping art school brat that's always burned inside him." [...] Bray rated the album four out of five stars. [...] In his seven out of ten Drowned in Sound review, J.R. Moores commented that Chelsea Light Moving [...] "glances down at the polite, folkish <b>path</b> Moore had <b>ploughed</b> with Trees Outside the Academy and Demolished Thoughts, stamps on it with Dr. Marten boots, gobs on it, hurls a load of soil all over the place and then runs in the opposite direction back to 1995's Psychic Hearts." ...|$|R
50|$|On {{the night}} of the 10th day, he went to Mt. Zinghmuh and hid himself in a place where he {{considered}} to be the most likely places traversed by Dead Soul’s Highway. He also placed some <b>ashes</b> on the <b>path</b> so that he could see the foot print of her daughter. Some hours after nightfall, he heard the sound of khingte “”i.e. the string of tiny ornamental brass bells worn by Chin girls around their hips””, coming toward him from one direction. He quickly recognized that it was the ringing of his daughter’s khingte as he always heard them when she used to walk briskly when she was alive. The sounds came nearer and nearer to him but he couldn’t see his daughter, nor could he see anything. When the sound reached the spot on the pass where he had spread a layer of ash, he saw a footprint which he quickly recognized as the footmarks of his daughter. Just before the ringing of khingte disappeared, he sprang from his hiding place and gripped the empty air. But instead of catching his haughtier he found that he had caught a huge and fearsome caterpillar, the size of a human. Being in his arms, and the big caterpillar was struggling to free itself from his grip. But knowing that it was his daughter he refused to let go his grip, but held it still firmer. A moment later, the caterpillar turned itself into a huge serpent. Though, the serpent tried to free itself from his grip {{while at the same time}} trying to strangle him the man continued to tighten his grip. At last, realizing that there was no use in continuing the struggle, the serpent turned itself into his daughter Dar Luan.|$|R
60|$|Artemus Ward {{used to say}} that, {{while there}} were many things in the science of {{astronomy}} hard to be understood, there was one fact which entirely puzzled him. He could partly perceive how we 'weigh the sun,' and ascertain the component elements of the heavenly bodies, by the aid of spectrum analysis. 'But what beats me about the stars,' he observed plaintively, 'is how we come to know their names.' This question, or rather the somewhat similar question, 'How did the constellations come by their very peculiar names?' has puzzled Professor Pritchard and other astronomers more serious than Artemus Ward. Why {{is a group of}} stars called the Bear, or the Swan, or the Twins, or named after the Pleiades, the fair daughters of the Giant Atlas? {121} These are difficulties that meet even children when they examine a 'celestial globe.' There they find the figure of a bear, traced out with lines in the intervals between the stars of the constellations, while a very imposing giant is so drawn that Orion's belt just fits his waist. But when he comes to look at the heavens, the infant speculator sees no sort of likeness to a bear in the stars, nor anything at all resembling a giant in the neighbourhood of Orion. The most eccentric modern fancy which can detect what shapes it will in clouds, is unable to find any likeness to human or animal forms in the stars, and yet we call a great many of the stars by the names of men and beasts and gods. Some resemblance to terrestrial things, it is true, everyone can behold in the heavens. Corona, for example, is like a crown, or, as the Australian black fellows know, it is like a boomerang, and we can understand why they give it the name of that curious curved missile. The Milky Way, again, does resemble a path in the sky; our English ancestors called it Watling Street--the path of the Watlings, mythical giants--and Bushmen in Africa and Red Men in North America name it the 'ashen path,' or 'the path of souls.' The <b>ashes</b> of the <b>path,</b> of course, are supposed to be hot and glowing, not dead and black like the ash-paths of modern running-grounds. Other and more recent names for certain constellations are also intelligible. In Homer's time the Greeks had two names for the Great Bear; they called it the Bear, or the Wain: and a certain fanciful likeness to a wain may be made out, though no resemblance to a bear is manifest. In the United States the same constellation is popularly styled the Dipper, and every one may observe the likeness to a dipper or toddy-ladle.|$|R
