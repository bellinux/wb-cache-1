5|$|In hepatic {{encephalopathy}} type C, {{the identification and}} treatment of alternative or underlying causes {{is central to the}} initial management. Given the frequency of infection as the underlying cause, antibiotics are often administered empirically (without knowledge of the exact source <b>and</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> infection). Once an episode of encephalopathy has been effectively treated, a decision may need to be made on whether to prepare for a liver transplant.|$|E

The {{size and shape of}} viruses, and the number <b>and</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> functional groups on their surface, is precisely defined. As such, viruses are commonly used in materials science as scaffolds for covalently linked surface modifications. A particular quality of viruses is that they can be tailored by directed evolution. The powerful techniques developed by life sciences are becoming the basis of engineering approaches towards nanomaterials, opening a wide range of applications far beyond biology and medicine.|$|E

25|$|One {{reason for}} having a special {{constitutional}} amendment procedure is because constitutional supremacy requires the Constitution to endure {{in the long term}} with its main principles largely unchanged.
