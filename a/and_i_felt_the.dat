500|$|In {{regards to}} the outcome, Rosolie {{explained}} that the anaconda [...] " [...] my arm into a position where her force was fully on my exposed arm.

500|$|On 3December 1954, Cresswell led a {{formation}} of twelve No.2 OTU Vampires {{in the shape}} of two sevens over Sydney to greet No.77 Squadron upon its return from Korea aboard the aircraft carrier HMAS Vengeance. His successor as commanding officer of the conversion unit took over on 27March 1956. Cresswell was posted to RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, as Director of Air Staff Policy. The position put him in line for promotion to group captain but, as he admitted later, [...] "I had itchy feet <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> Service had already given me all the operational flying I was likely to get." [...] He decided to resign his commission in December 1956, and was discharged from the RAAF on 30April 1957.|$|E
500|$|The {{music was}} {{composed}} by Olivier Deriviere, who recorded the score with a 70-piece orchestra, then modified and changed it using electronic equipment. In {{an interview with}} Game Informer, Deriviere said: [...] "During my first contact , I was quite confused by so much information <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> music should reflect this confusion". Deriviere disclosed that players would not hear the main theme {{until the end of}} the game, given that it is scattered in pieces through the rest of the score to reflect the nature of the game and the story of Nilin. For his work, Deriviere was awarded the 2013 IFMCA award for Best Original Score for a Video Game or Interactive Media. Remember Me was created with Unreal Engine 3 to lessen the workload involved in making a new intellectual property with a nascent studio of just under 100 employees. To evaluate the engine, Dontnod collaborated with Epic Games' engineering team at various stages during production.|$|E
60|$|I {{knew this}} beforehand, but my salary {{had been raised}} to fifty dollars a month <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>the</b> bank {{was the only place}} for it.|$|R
60|$|On, on! I groaned {{with the}} {{violence}} of my effort. <b>I</b> staggered again <b>and</b> swore. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> concussions of great guns tear past me through the murk.|$|R

2500|$|Immediately {{after the}} {{critical}} and commercial {{success of the}} original game, publishers Interplay wanted to begin work on a sequel. They approached Bruty, but {{he was reluctant to}} go straight into another MDK game, explaining [...] "I hadn't liked rushing from Earthworm Jim to its sequel without a creative break, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> game suffered because of that."

2500|$|The {{game was}} both a {{critical}} and a commercial success, and Interplay decided to begin work on a sequel immediately. MDKs sales had reached 500,000 copies by early 2000. Interplay approached Bruty for ideas, but he didn't want to go straight into another MDK game; [...] "I hadn't liked rushing from Earthworm Jim to its sequel without a creative break, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> game suffered because of that."

2500|$|Immediately {{after the}} {{critical}} and commercial {{success of the}} original MDK, publishers Interplay wanted to begin work on a sequel.

6000|$|I {{looked at}} my torn trousers, at the blood on my skinned and burning hands, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> of <b>the</b> bruise on my head, as I said, grimly: [...] "I'll hang to him as long as I can." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> wheeled about, <b>and</b> {{there were}} {{twenty or thirty}} people, a sort of {{irregular}} investment of people, all bombarding me with dumb interrogation, with infinite doubt <b>and</b> suspicion. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> compulsion of their eyes intolerably. I groaned aloud.|$|R
6000|$|... "Quickly drawing my {{hand toward}} me it struck {{the head of}} the dog, and, moving it {{backward}} <b>and</b> forward, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> ears <b>and</b> nose of the animal, and then became conscious that its head was still resting upon my knee.|$|R
2500|$|Following {{the first}} Superman movie, Reeve found that Hollywood {{producers}} {{wanted him to}} be an action star. He later said, [...] "I found most of the scripts of that genre poorly constructed, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> starring roles could easily be played by anyone with a strong physique." [...] In addition, he did not feel that he was right for the other films he was offered and turned down the lead roles in American Gigolo, The World According to Garp, Splash, Fatal Attraction, Pretty Woman, Romancing the Stone, Lethal Weapon, and Body Heat. Katharine Hepburn recommended Reeve to David Lean for the role of Fletcher Christian in The Bounty, a film version of the mutiny on the Bounty starring Anthony Hopkins. After considering it, Reeve decided that he would be miscast, and Lean went with his second choice, Mel Gibson.|$|E
60|$|He laughed. It {{was the old}} buoyant, boyish laugh {{of sheer}} happiness, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> better for hearing it.|$|E
60|$|Comyn laughed, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> blood rise to my face, {{and kicked}} John Paul viciously. Dolly {{retained}} her self-possession.|$|E
60|$|I laughed {{to myself}} at the thought, which was one that a white man could not {{entertain}} even as a thought. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>the</b> hypothetical Hans was right, death alone could cut this knot, and the reflection made me shiver.|$|R
6000|$|Her extreme limpidity {{was almost}} provoking, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> for <b>the</b> moment {{that she would}} have been more {{satisfactory}} if she had been less ingenuous. [...] "Do you suppose it's something to which Jeffrey Aspern's letters and papers--I mean the things in her possession--have reference?" ...|$|R
60|$|She {{leaned back}} upon the couch, <b>and</b> once more <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> hidden eyes playing upon me and searching out my heart.|$|R
60|$|She laughed, {{and at the}} old painful {{memories}} she dilated in the old way, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> old tremor {{at seeing}} her soul flung quivering on my pity.|$|E
60|$|She {{brought him}} one directly. He stooped down, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> metal strike my teeth. The brandy seemed to set all my blood flowing once more warmly in my veins. The {{heat of the}} fire, too, was delicious.|$|E
60|$|About noon I sighted a {{big splash}} a mile off shoreward, and we headed that way. Soon I sighted fins. The first time round we got the bait right <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> old thrill. He went down. I waited; but in vain.|$|E
5000|$|Immediately {{after the}} election, Ramsay Macdonald wrote to Hardie, {{requesting}} {{membership of the}} ILP. In his letter, he noted that [...] "...Attercliffe came as a rude awakening, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> during <b>the</b> contest that it was quite {{impossible for me to}} maintain my position as a Liberal any longer..." ...|$|R
60|$|Then I {{knew that}} there was going to be some {{spirited}} doctoring, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> sorry for <b>the</b> Government Advocate who would conduct the prosecution.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{gripped the}} club in my right hand," [...] Mr. Weatherley explained, seizing a ruler from the table, [...] "like this, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> ran in upon him.

60|$|It {{was dark}} down {{there by the}} stables, and I was peering round for the hostler, when {{suddenly}} my two arms were seized from behind. There were hands at my wrists and at my throat, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> cold muzzle of a pistol under my ear.|$|E
60|$|A low moan went up {{from his}} audience, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> skin of Goza, who had shrunk against me, break into a profuse sweat.

6000|$|... "His arm stole round me again; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> quick beat of {{his heart}} get quicker and quicker. 'If you only knew!' he whispered back; 'if you only knew--' He could say no more. I felt his face bending toward mine, and dropped my head lower, and stopped him in {{the very act of}} kissing me.|$|E
60|$|I saw {{the mild}} {{eye of the}} good old Doctor turned upon me for a moment, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>the</b> {{confession}} of my old misgivings and remembrances was too plainly written in my face to be overlooked. It was of no use raging. I could not undo that. Say what I would, I could not unsay it.|$|R
60|$|Now <b>I</b> understood, <b>and,</b> bending down, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> {{heart of}} Umslopogaas, {{and laid the}} down of an eagle upon his lips. His heart still stirred and the down was lifted gently.|$|R
50|$|When his two-hour set ended I {{could only}} think, can anyone really be this good; can anyone say this much to me, can rock'n'roll still speak {{with this kind}} of power and glory? <b>And</b> then <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> sores on my thighs where I had been {{pounding}} my hands in time for the entire concert and knew that the answer was yes.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No,' I said; 'one sister {{could not}} {{inconvenience}} another,' <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> feeble hand stealing round my waist, {{and saw a}} sort of smile on the thin little lips, which brought back one look of my Philippe's. I threw off my own veil, and raised {{her in my arms}} so as to kiss her, and in that embrace I did indeed gain a sister.|$|E
60|$|We landed, but it warn't as {{interesting}} as I {{thought it was going}} to be, because we couldn't find the place where they went in to git the treasure. Still, it was plenty interesting enough, just to see the mere hill itself where such a wonderful thing happened. Jim said he wou'dn't 'a' missed it for three dollars, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> same way.|$|E
6000|$|How could I {{tell her}} so soon how much I {{appreciated}} {{the opportunity of}} looking into hers? I could only assent in general to the proposition that there were certainly for every one such yearnings, and even such faces; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> crisis demand all my lucidity, all my wisdom. “Oh yes, I’m a student of physiognomy. Do you mean,” I pursued, “that you’ve a passion for Mr. Paraday’s books?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "During {{the night}} {{there was a}} most dreadful storm. The thunder roared, the {{lightning}} flashed through the slit in the wall, and the wind blew with such terrific violence that the tower shook and trembled.

60|$|I walked briskly to the station. There was a glow {{of hope in}} me. There was {{a growing}} {{conviction}} {{in my mind that}} my journey this time would not be taken in vain.

60|$|At {{that moment}} {{we were in}} more danger of such of the savages than from those who were yet sound in body; but as <b>the</b> time passed <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> neither <b>the</b> sting of a bullet nor the burning cut of a knife, my courage came back again before those around me noted the fact of my having been near to cowardice.|$|R
