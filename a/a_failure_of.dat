5|$|In December 2006 and January 2007, {{during the}} off-season, both zero-G rolls {{were removed from}} the ride.

Batman's train had its shells painted red so Robin could be ready to open first before Batman. This was done because Robin was more reliable than Batman and the track replacement for Robin was completed first on March 13. It re-opened on April 7. Batman's track was replaced between April 16 and April 20, while the park was closed. However, Batman never re-opened.|$|E
5|$|In September 1940, Norbert Wiener {{approached}} Bush with {{a proposal}} to build a digital computer. Bush declined to provide NDRC funding for it {{on the grounds that}} he did not believe that it could be completed {{before the end of the}} war. The supporters of digital computers were disappointed at the decision, which they attributed to a preference for outmoded analog technology. In June 1943, the Army provided $500,000 to build the computer, which became ENIAC, the first general-purpose electronic computer. Having delayed its funding, Bush's prediction proved correct as ENIAC was not completed until December 1945, after the war had ended. His critics saw his attitude as <b>a</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> vision.|$|E

5|$|Several {{disorders}} {{affect the}} motility of food as it travels down the esophagus. This can cause difficult swallowing, called dysphagia, or painful swallowing, called odynophagia. Achalasia refers to <b>a</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> the lower esophageal sphincter to relax properly, and generally develops later in life. This leads to progressive {{enlargement of the}} esophagus, and possibly eventual megaesophagus. A nutcracker esophagus refers to swallowing that can be extremely painful. Diffuse esophageal spasm is a spasm of the esophagus that can be one cause of chest pain. Such referred pain {{to the wall of}} the upper chest is quite common in esophageal conditions. Sclerosis of the esophagus, such as with systemic sclerosis or in CREST syndrome may cause hardening of the walls of the esophagus and interfere with peristalsis.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{element of}} the STS-8 mission payload was INSAT-1B. It was the second {{in a series of}} {{multi-purpose}} weather and communications satellites to be operated by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO); the first, INSAT-1A, had been launched by a Delta rocket in April 1982, but had to be shut down shortly afterwards due to <b>a</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> the onboard reaction control system. The satellite was carried {{in the rear of the}} shuttle's payload bay, and was boosted into a geosynchronous transfer orbit by a Payload Assist Module (PAM-D), a small solid rocket upper stage, after its release from the orbiter. The satellite, with its upper stage, massed a total of , with the cradle massing another , and had cost around $50 million.|$|E
5|$|By now the pre-war {{electrification}} scheme {{had been}} revived. In 1957 electrification between Rickmansworth and Amersham and Chesham began. Chalfont& Latimer's platforms were extended {{and a second}} platform was opened at Chesham on 3 July 1960 to prevent through operations to and from Baker Street from interfering with the Chesham–Chalfont& Latimer shuttle. An electric service using London Underground T Stock began operations between Chesham and Chalfont& Latimer on 16 August 1960, with former MR electric locomotives hauling the through trains to and from London. A steam locomotive was kept on standby in the new second platform at Chesham, in case of <b>a</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> the electric trains. From June 1962 both the T Stock and the locomotive-hauled trains were replaced by the newly introduced London Underground A Stock.|$|E

40|$|At the moment, for {{determining}} {{the safety of the}} dike ring areas around the IJsselmeer <b>a</b> possible <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> the Afsluitdijk is assumed to have no influence on loads occurring on the IJsselmeer dikes. <b>As</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> the Afsluitdijk is always possible, the consequences <b>of</b> such <b>a</b> <b>failure</b> should be investigated. The objective of this thesis is to investigate these consequences <b>of</b> <b>a</b> possible <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> the Afsluitdijk. What happens with the water level of the IJsselmeer if during extreme conditions the Afsluitdijk breaches? This objective is achieved by first defining 4 different possible breach scenarios. Then, the effect of such a breach on the water level of the IJsselmeer is investigated. Subsequently, the consequences of this increase in water level on the probability <b>of</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> the dikes of the Noordoostpolder is studied by using the program PC-Ring. For both cases, failure and no <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> the Afsluitdijk, the risks and consequences are combined to see the change in the risks of flooding of the Noordoostpolder.

5|$|If an {{underlying}} muscle disease is suspected, for instance {{if there is}} no obvious explanation or there have been multiple episodes, {{it may be necessary to}} perform further investigations. During an attack, low levels of carnitine in the blood and high levels of acylcarnitine in blood and urine may indicate a lipid metabolism defect, but these abnormalities revert to normal during convalescence. Other tests may be used at that stage to demonstrate these disorders. Disorders of glycolysis can be detected by various means, including the measurement of lactate after exercise; <b>a</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> the lactate to rise may be indicative of a disorder in glycolysis, while an exaggerated response is typical of mitochondrial diseases. Electromyography (EMG) may show particular patterns in specific muscle diseases; for instance, McArdle's disease and phosphofructokinase deficiency show a phenomenon called cramp-like contracture. There are genetic tests available for many of the hereditary muscle conditions that predispose to myoglobinuria and rhabdomyolysis.|$|E
5|$|In some cases, {{travelling}} through unmapped areas, {{men took}} {{up to six}} weeks just to reach their destinations. They often had to carry all their supplies, arms and their radio, often {{with the help of}} Papuan carriers. Teams of two or three spotters typically maintained the stations, each led by an acting non-commissioned-officer (NCO), working in isolation from friendly forces in remote locations for extended periods of time. The teams survived on limited rations, usually supplemented by native food sources. Once their initial supplies were expended they usually had to fend for themselves, although stations were also sometimes re-supplied by airdrop or by sea, but usually only in the event of <b>a</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> mission essential equipment, or when petrol for the radios ran low. Spotting stations were usually only lightly armed, being usually equipped with just one Owen Gun with 600 rounds for the NCO in charge, and a rifle with only 50 rounds for each other man.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of a collision with Esteban Gutiérrez in the Australian Grand Prix, Fernando Alonso was ruled out of the event with broken ribs and a pneumothorax, and as a result was replaced with McLaren reserve driver Stoffel Vandoorne. Gutiérrez received a new chassis after his team found that his original chassis was too damaged to be repaired, mostly caused by the crane during the recovery process and not in the accident itself. Meanwhile, Ferrari were able to use the same engine in Kimi Räikkönen's car as they had done in Australia, even though it had caught fire following <b>a</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> the turbo charger. Swift reactions by the team on the scene prevented damage to the combustion engine, with only the turbo changed for Bahrain.

5|$|Investigation {{revealed}} both {{mechanical and}} organizational {{causes of the}} accident. The chain of events, as it was reconstructed in Toulon, started with <b>a</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> the hydraulic breech-locking mechanism of the left-hand gun. The turret crew then disabled the hydraulics and resorted to manual operation. The gunner responsible for closing and locking the breech {{failed to do so}} and the concussion of the right-hand gun firing unlocked it. The turret commander, ultimately responsible for checking the breech before firing, was too busy with calculating the firing solution and training the gun to be concerned with this matter. He delegated the checkup routine to an enlisted man, but this gunner had to attend his own station and was physically unable to look after the breech lock and attend to his own duties. The panel eventually dropped the charges against the captain and recommended introduction of mechanical fail-safe interlocks to prevent firing until the breech was properly locked.|$|E

During his first term Christ's College provided him with a small scholarship, but the gap remained. This was a crippling burden for Smuts, yet it was Professor Marais who was to come to his rescue. Smuts, having confided his difficulties to Marais towards the end of 1891 received by immediate return a cheque for £50. Marais urged Smuts to write to him whenever he felt himself in need, in return of which Smuts took out a life insurance policy naming Marais as beneficiary. Should Smuts have died this policy would cover the loans, but while he lived, Smuts's integrity was Marais's only cover.|$|E

In October 2006 Griffin gave the final go-ahead, and the 11-day mission by Atlantis was scheduled for October 2008.

5|$|The {{project was}} {{designed}} {{with a new}} methodology called fault tree analysis, which allowed the effects of <b>a</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> a single part to be studied to determine its impact on other systems.

Additionally, {{some of the most}} advanced high-lift devices used in the industry were included in the new design, to allow it to operate from existing airports. These included slats running almost {{the entire length of the}} wing, as well as complex three-part slotted flaps along the trailing edge of the wing. The wing's complex three-part flaps increase wing area by 21 percent and lift by 90 percent when fully deployed compared to their non-deployed configuration.|$|E
5|$|The capsule {{built for}} the mission, Mercury Spacecraft No. 16, had been {{delivered}} to Cape Canaveral on January 16, 1962. The Atlas LV-3B booster assigned to the mission, No. 113-D, was accepted by NASA at the Convair plant on July 27 and delivered on August 8. In late July, the launch date was set for September 18, but delays with the Atlas booster's delivery {{and a series of}} technical concerns with the safety of the rocket motors caused it to be pushed back several weeks. Some of this {{had to do with the}} modified propulsion system, but also concern over Atlas ICBM tests earlier in the year. There had been no Atlas failures caused by the turbopumps for almost three years, but in late 1961-early 1962, two static firing tests experienced pump failure and explosion of the engine, followed by an Atlas missile in April 1962 that exploded almost immediately at liftoff due to <b>a</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> the sustainer turbopump. Analysis of these incidents failed to locate any specific cause for the pump explosions, but all of them occurred when running untested hardware modifications and during movement of the sustainer inlet valve to the flight-ready open position. It was thus decided to give MA-8's booster a thorough checkout before it could be deemed flight-worthy. On September 6, the tests were scheduled to continue until September 24, which allowed for a probable launch on October 3. A static firing test on the pad would expose the sustainer turbopump to the failure mode in question. This was carried out on September 8 and the booster reported as ready for assembly on September 18.|$|E
