40|$|<b>Astrophysicists</b> use {{radiation}} {{to investigate}} the physics controlling a variety of celestial sources, including stellar atmospheres, black holes, and binary systems. By measuring the spectrum of the emitted radiation, <b>astrophysicists</b> can determine a source’s temperature and composition.

5|$|A key {{influence}} on the plot of The Calculus Affair was an article that Hergé had read in a February 1954 issue of the Belgian weekly La Face à Main, reporting {{that there had been}} a number of incidents along the road from Portsmouth to London in southern England in which motorists' car windscreens had spontaneously shattered; the article's author suggested that it may have been caused by experiments undertaken in a nearby secret facility. To develop this plot further, Hergé consulted Professor , an <b>astrophysicist</b> at Liège.|$|E
5|$|In Action Comics #14 (January 2013), {{which was}} {{published}} 7 November 2012, <b>astrophysicist</b> Neil deGrasse Tyson appears in the story, in which he determines that Superman's home planet, Krypton, orbited the red dwarf LHS 2520 in the constellation Corvus, 27.1 light-years from Earth. Tyson assisted DC Comics in selecting a real-life star {{that would be an}} appropriate parent star to Krypton, and picked the star in Corvus, and which is the mascot of Superman's high school, the Smallville Crows.|$|E
5|$|In an {{animated}} segment of this episode, Tyson discusses {{the life and}} vision of the 16th-century Italian philosopher Giordano Bruno (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) {{as the person who}} championed a much more expansive understanding of the Earth's place in the universe, with the Sun being just one star among all the others. Later, he presents the history of the Universe on Carl Sagan's Cosmic Calendar. The episode ends with Tyson's brief speech about Carl Sagan's life and career, and how Sagan inspired him to become an <b>astrophysicist.</b>|$|E

5|$|Several astronomers, {{including}} Alan Hale, {{claimed the}} object was simply an 8.5-magnitude star, SAO141894, which did not appear on Shramek's computer program because the user preferences were set incorrectly. Later, Art Bell even claimed to have obtained {{an image of the}} object from an anonymous <b>astrophysicist</b> who was about to confirm its discovery. However, astronomers Olivier Hainaut and David J. Tholen of the University of Hawaii stated that the alleged photo was an altered copy of one of their own comet images.|$|E
5|$|Thor {{lands in}} New Mexico, where <b>astrophysicist</b> Dr. Jane Foster, her {{assistant}} Darcy Lewis, and mentor Dr. Erik Selvig, find him. The local populace finds Mjolnir, which S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Phil Coulson soon commandeers before forcibly acquiring Jane's {{data about the}} wormhole that delivered Thor to Earth. Thor, having discovered Mjolnir's nearby location, seeks to retrieve it from the facility that S.H.I.E.L.D. quickly constructed but he finds himself unable to lift it, and is captured. With Selvig's help, he is freed and resigns himself to exile on Earth as he develops a romance with Jane.|$|E

50|$|Some <b>astrophysicists</b> were unconvinced {{that the}} cosmological redshifts {{are caused by}} {{universal}} cosmological expansion. Skepticism and alternative explanations began appearing in the scientific literature in the 1960s. In particular, Geoffrey Burbidge, William Tifft and Halton Arp were all observational <b>astrophysicists</b> who proposed that there were inconsistencies in the redshift observations of galaxies and quasars. The first two were famous for suggesting that there were periodicities in the redshift distributions of galaxies and quasars. Subsequent statistical analyses of redshift surveys, however, have not confirmed {{the existence of these}} periodicities.|$|R
5|$|Catherine Hicks plays Doctor Gillian Taylor, a {{biologist}} on 20th century Earth. During production a rumor circulated that the part {{had been created}} after Shatner demanded a love interest, a regular aspect of the television series that was absent from the first three films. Writer Nicholas Meyer denied this, saying that the inspiration for Taylor came from a woman biologist featured in a National Geographic documentary about whales. Nimoy chose Hicks after inviting her to lunch with Shatner and witnessing a chemistry between the two. The role was originally written for Eddie Murphy as an <b>astrophysicist</b> at Berkeley.|$|E
5|$|In London, <b>astrophysicist</b> Dr. Jane Foster and her intern Darcy Lewis {{travel to}} an {{abandoned}} factory where such portals have appeared, disrupting {{the laws of}} physics around them. Separating from the group, Jane is teleported to another world, where she is infected by the Aether. Heimdall alerts Thor that Jane has moved beyond his near all-seeing vision, leading Thor to Earth. When Thor finds Jane, she inadvertently releases an unearthly force, and Thor returns with her to Asgard. Odin, recognizing the Aether, warns that the Aether will not only kill Jane, but that its return heralds a catastrophic prophecy.|$|E
5|$|The award ceremony, held {{as planned}} in Oslo City Hall on the {{afternoon}} of 10 December, was attended by about 1,000 VIPs, diplomats and guests.

40|$|Perception, {{eye-tracking}}, data visualization, galactic images. This study uses eye-tracking {{to investigate}} {{the differences in the}} way professional <b>astrophysicists</b> and novices observe simulations of galactic events. The results of this study provide insight into which aspects of the data are important and allow us to tailor the visualizations for a specific group. We hypothesized that the gaze patterns of professionals and novices would vary considerably. A user study was performed on two groups: trained <b>astrophysicists</b> and novices. Each group was presented with a randomized sequence of images and a video while their gaze patterns were recorded with an eye-tracker. We discovered that although both groups observed each image for the same duration, experts limited their fixations to a smaller area. Novices, on the other hand, had fixations which were spread across the images. For the video, the <b>astrophysicists</b> were more focused on simulations in which most of the data was visible and the camera angles had minimal axis change. ...|$|R
25|$|The {{concept of}} {{infinity}} also {{extends to the}} multiverse hypothesis, which, when explained by <b>astrophysicists</b> such as Michio Kaku, posits that there are an infinite number and variety of universes.|$|R
