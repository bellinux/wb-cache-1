5|$|Ayer, who {{had written}} several police {{procedural}} films previously, wanted the film {{to focus more on}} the friendship between partners <b>and</b> <b>honest</b> police work rather than corruption. Gyllenhaal, Peña, and other cast members underwent an intensive training program to prepare for their roles as police officers. Filming took place in Los Angeles in August 2011 with a budget of $7 million.|$|E
5|$|I thus learnt {{my first}} great {{lesson in the}} inquiry into these obscure fields of knowledge, never to accept the disbelief of great men or their accusations of imposture or of imbecility, as of any weight when opposed to the {{repeated}} observation of facts by other men, admittedly sane <b>and</b> <b>honest.</b> The whole history of science shows us that whenever the educated and scientific men of any age have denied the facts of other investigators on a priori grounds of absurdity or impossibility, the deniers have always been wrong.|$|E

5|$|Nonviolent Communication (abbreviated NVC, {{also called}} Compassionate Communication or Collaborative Communication) is a {{communication}} process developed by Marshall Rosenberg {{beginning in the}} 1960s. It focuses on three aspects of communication: self-empathy (defined as a deep and compassionate awareness of one's own inner experience), empathy (defined as {{an understanding of the}} heart in which we see the beauty in the other person), <b>and</b> <b>honest</b> self-expression (defined as expressing oneself authentically {{in a way that is}} likely to inspire compassion in others).|$|E
5|$|Most {{living things}} have predators and {{therefore}} {{are in a}} constant evolutionary arms race to develop antipredator adaptations, while the predator adapts to become more efficient at defeating the prey's adaptations. Some organisms have evolved to make detection less likely, for example by nocturnality and camouflage. Others have developed chemical defences such as the deadly toxins of certain snakes and wasps, or the noxious scent of the skunk. Such prey often send clear <b>and</b> <b>honest</b> warning signals to their attackers with conspicuous aposematic (warning) patterns. The brightness of such warning signs is correlated {{with the level of}} toxicity of the organism.|$|E

His father's panel is considered the superior work and has been described as one of Dürer's most exact <b>and</b> <b>honest</b> portraits. They are among four paintings or drawings Dürer made of his parents, each of which unsentimentally examines the deteriorating effects of age. His later writings contain eulogies for both parents, from which the love and respect he felt toward them is evident.|$|E

5|$|Two {{weeks before}} the primary, Combs was {{endorsed}} by former Vice-President and native Kentuckian Alben W. Barkley, but Combs felt the endorsement came too late to be much help. Chandler defeated Combs in the primary {{by a vote of}} 259,875 to 241,754 and went on to win his second term as governor. Combs returned to Prestonsburg, set up a savings and loan company, and re-established his law practice. During the four years of Chandler's term, Combs accepted a number of speaking engagements, but otherwise remained out of the public eye. Meanwhile, the state's need for funds compelled Chandler to raise the state sales tax and other taxes, despite his campaign promises not to do so. Consequently, Chandler lost credibility and Combs gained a reputation as a courageous, forthright, <b>and</b> <b>honest</b> politician for having acknowledged the state's financial need during the campaign.|$|E
5|$|Chris becomes {{frustrated}} with Aidan {{when he does}} not confide in him about his feelings or accept help from him. When Aidan goes back on his promise to be more open <b>and</b> <b>honest,</b> Chris breaks up with him. Chris suffers a flashback to the crash and damages a Lassiter's car. Ralphie Mahone (Daniel Bowden) fixes the car and in return, he asks Chris to rework some vehicles for him. Chris comes clean to Lucas, who calls the police. Ralphie threatens Chris, but Mason Turner (Taylor Glockner) intervenes and gets rid of Ralphie. Georgia Brooks's boyfriend, Scotty, makes sexual advances towards Chris. When Georgia finds out, she starts avoiding Chris, but they later make up. Chris befriends Amber Turner (Jenna Rosenow) when he sees she is being bullied. Amber develops a crush on Chris and he is forced {{to tell her that}} nothing will ever happen between them. Chris begins dating competitive swimmer Hudson Walsh (Remy Hii). Chris breaks up with Hudson when he learns that he is taking performance-enhancing drugs. Chris and Hudson later get back together. Hudson confesses to running down Amber's ex-boyfriend Robbo Slade (Aaron Jakubenko). He apologises to Chris and then refuses to see him again.|$|E
5|$|Combs' uninspiring {{speeches and}} candidness {{about the need}} for more state revenue cost him the primary election. Chandler, who went on to reclaim the governorship, had promised that he would not need to raise taxes to meet the state's {{financial}} obligations, but ultimately he did so. This damaged Chandler's credibility and left Combs looking courageous <b>and</b> <b>honest</b> {{in the eyes of the}} electorate. Consequently, in 1959 Combs was elected governor, defeating Lieutenant Governor Harry Lee Waterfield, Chandler's choice to succeed him in office, in the primary. Early in his term, Combs secured passage of a three-percent sales tax to pay a bonus to the state's military veterans. Knowing a tax of one percent would have been sufficient, he used the excess revenue to enact a system of reforms, including expansion of the state's highway and state park systems. He also devoted much of the surplus to education.|$|E

5|$|In another story, Stowe and Calvin {{meet a man}} on a Mandarin dock who {{has been}} cheated out of much the land he was given by the government. Named Old Cudjo, he worked the small {{homestead}} on which he grew cotton for years. Where at first the neighbors surrounding the colony of former slaves from South Carolina were hesitant and suspicious, Old Cudjo and his colony were so industrious <b>and</b> <b>honest</b> that they won their white neighbors over. One who was a justice of the peace intervened on his behalf and Old Cudjo's land was returned to him. Stowe's final chapter is dedicated to defending the notion that blacks should be employed to help build the state of Florida to transform it from a wilderness into a civilization. They are better suited for work in the hot sun, more resistant to malaria, and are trustworthy and extremely eager to learn. She also dedicates a few pages to her interested observations on their culture as she details overhearing their festivities at night and sitting outside an informal church service.|$|E
5|$|Unlike its American equivalents, Dawson City was a law-abiding town. By 1897, 96 {{members of}} the NWMP {{had been sent to}} the {{district}} and by 1898 this had increased to 288, an expensive commitment by the Canadian government. By June 1898 the force was headed by Colonel Sam Steele, an officer with a reputation for firm discipline. In 1898, there were no murders and only a few major thefts; in all, only about 150 arrests were made in the Yukon for serious offenses that year. Of these arrests, over half were for prostitution and resulted from an attempt by the NWMP to regulate the sex industry in Dawson: regular monthly arrests, $50 ($1,400) fines and medical inspections were imposed, with the proceeds being used to fund the local hospitals. The so-called blue laws were strictly enforced. Saloons and other establishments closed promptly at midnight on Saturday, and anyone caught working on Sunday was liable to be fined or set to chopping firewood for the NWMP. The NWMP are generally regarded by historians to have been an efficient <b>and</b> <b>honest</b> force during the period, although their task was helped by the geography of the Klondike which made it relatively easy to bar entry to undesirables or prevent suspects from leaving the region.|$|E
5|$|Galland's time in Argentina {{was running}} out. For his services, {{he was awarded}} a pilot's wings badge and the title Honorary Argentine Military Pilot. Later that year Galland left South America. By that time, he had begun writing his autobiography, The First and the Last (Die Ersten und die Letzten), and it was {{published}} in 1954 by Franz Schneekluth. It was a best-seller in 14 languages and sold three million copies. It was very well received by the RAF and USAF as a frank <b>and</b> <b>honest</b> statement. Galland returned to Germany and was approached by a commissioner for Chancellor Konrad Adenauer for the purpose of joining the new Bundeswehr now that West Germany was to join NATO as a military power. Galland joined with Steinhoff, and went over the proposal. However, France objected to West Germany's proposal for a pan-European defence pact and chose to go its own way. That changed the organisation structure of the German armed forces. Galland got on with his life as the months rolled by. In 1956 Josef Kammhuber, the leader of the German Nachtjagdgeschwader (Night Fighter Wings) during the war, became the new commander-in-chief of the Bundesluftwaffe. Galland now accepted he had been turned down as a potential leader of, or in, the new air force. Galland suspected that it was more to do with his technically illegal departure from Germany in 1948 and his association with Argentina, a state which was on poor terms with the United States, the dominant partner of NATO.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to develop a classic {{grounded}} theory about how addicts resolve their pain during addiction and recovery. Interviews and observations were analyzed and secondary analyses were carried out. Pain emerged as the main concern with pain resolving as the emergent pattern of behavior through which they deal with this concern. Pain resolving is a two-stage basic social psychological process of becoming where their identity is formed based on how they resolve their pain. This process of becoming is progressive over time. These two stages are instantaneous pain relieving <b>and</b> <b>honesting.</b> Trapped in instantaneous pain relieving leads an addict to become a worthless person while continuous life-long implementing of honesting brings the addict towards becoming a fully functioning person. Instantaneous pain relieving <b>and</b> <b>honesting</b> account for the patterns of behavior in resolving pain when an addict is in addiction and during the recovering process respectively...|$|R
