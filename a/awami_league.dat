5|$|The Pakistani {{government}} was severely criticised for its {{handling of the}} relief operations following the storm, both by local political leaders in East Pakistan and in the international media. In the December national elections, the opposition <b>Awami</b> <b>League</b> gained a landslide victory, gaining 160 of the 162 East Pakistani seats.

5|$|Although the {{question}} of official languages was settled by 1956, the military regime of Ayub Khan promoted the interests of West Pakistan {{at the expense of}} East Pakistan. Despite forming the majority of the national population, the East Pakistani population continued to be under-represented in the civil and military services, and received a minority of state funding and other government help. This was mainly due to lack of representative government in the fledgling state. Mainly due to regional economic imbalances sectional divisions grew, and support for the Bengali ethnic nationalist <b>Awami</b> <b>League,</b> which invoked the 6-point movement for greater provincial autonomy. One demand was that East Pakistan be called Bangladesh (Land/Country of Bengal), which subsequently led to the Bangladesh Liberation War.|$|E

Though <b>Awami</b> <b>League</b> won enough seat to form a {{government}} without the need for any coalition, West Pakistani elites refused to handover power to the East Pakistani party. Efforts were made to start a constitutional dialogue. Bhutto asked for share in government saying 'Udhar tum, idhar hum' , means 'You are in east, I am in west'. The PPP's intellectuals maintained that <b>Awami</b> <b>League</b> had no mandate in Western contingent. Although President Yahya Khan invited <b>Awami</b> <b>League</b> for a National Assembly session in Islamabad, he did not hand over the powers to the <b>Awami</b> <b>League</b> form a government due to constant pressure from the PPP.

After the so-called Agartala Conspiracy Case, and subsequent end of the Ayub Khan's regime in Pakistan, the <b>Awami</b> <b>League</b> and its leader Sheikh Mujib reached the peak of their popularity among the East Pakistani Bengali population.

It also won 288 of the 300 provincial assembly seats in East Pakistan. This win gave the <b>Awami</b> <b>League</b> a healthy majority in the 313-seat National Assembly {{and placed it in}} a position to establish a national government without a coalition partner. This was not acceptable to the political leaders of West Pakistan who feared the 6 points were a step towards breaking up the country and led directly to the events of the Bangladesh Liberation War. A particular point of disagreement was transferring 6 powers to one province which was unprecedented. The <b>Awami</b> <b>League</b> leaders, taking refuge in India, successfully led the war against the Pakistani Army throughout 1971.
