40|$|Using density {{functional}} theory (DFT) calculations, {{we investigated}} the adsorption of CO 2 molecules on 3 d transition metal (TM) -benzene complexes. Our calculations {{show that the}} maximum number of CO 2 molecules adsorbable on Sc or Ti atoms is three, but the 18 -electron rule predicts it should be four. The 18 -electron rule is generally successful in predicting the maximum H 2 <b>adsorption</b> <b>number</b> for TM atoms including Sc or Ti atoms. We found that the 18 -electron rule fails to correctly predict CO 2 binding on Sc- or Ti-benzene complexes because CO 2 binding, in contrast to H 2 binding, requires additional consideration for steric hindrance due to the large bond length of CO 2. We calculated the occupation function for CO 2 using the Tolman cone angle, which shows that three CO 2 molecules fully occupy the available space around Sc- and Ti-benzene complexes. This estimation is the same maximum CO 2 <b>adsorption</b> <b>number</b> predicted by DFT calculations.

It is a fluffy powder of extreme fineness and high surface area, composed essentially of elemental carbon. Carbon black is one of thermo-stable product among the chemicals used in rubber compounding. Carbon black in general is the most widely used filler material in rubber industry. Carbon black is made from hydrocarbon fuel and therefore costly and has to be imported to Srilanka. Paddy husk is a natural source which can be converted to Carbon black and can be very cost effective. In an Agricultural country like Srilanka, paddy husk is abundantly available and also it would be uplifting to local industry as a readily available renewable raw material source. Carbon black particle size plays a major role with regard to cured rubber properties. It is directly related to strength of cured article. When a compound is used for tyre tread or plies, Carbon black particle size will be the most critical parameter. Carbon black particle size is not so critical when compounding in tyre bead, inner liner, and chafer compounds. When Carbon black is to be produced from paddy husk, first, it is under gone pyrolysis in inert atmospheric conditions and converted into carbonized paddy husks. Then, carbonized paddy husk is ground in a grinder and further fined by ball milling. Accordingly it can be made fine 200 nm level of particle size which is confirmed by Iodine <b>adsorption</b> <b>number</b> analysis.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{focuses on the}} breakup of surfactant-laden non-Newtonian laminar jets. The {{combined}} effect of polymers and soluble surfactants on the dynamics of jet breakup, and especially on satellite drop formation, was experimentally and theoretically investigated. ^ Xanthan gum, Carbopol® 934 NF, Carboxymethyl cellulose 7 MF and Carboxymethyl cellulose 7 HOF were dissolved in water with Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate or Sylgard® 309 as the surfactant. Sinusoidal controlled disturbances were imposed at the laminar jet interface using a piezoelectric vibrating nozzle with breakup dynamics recorded using a high-speed camera and drop sizes measured using fiber Phase Doppler Anemometry. Emphasis was placed on how bulk and interfacial properties of the prepared liquids influenced ligament and drop evolution. It was found experimentally that if the proper concentration of surfactant was selected (close to the critical micelle concentration), and if the surfactant adsorption/desorption was fast enough, Marangoni interfacial stresses developed and led {{to an increase in}} satellite drop size (as was observed by previous researchers for breakup simulations of shear-thinning jets covered with insoluble surfactant). ^ In addition to experiments, a one-dimensional theoretical investigation based on Taylor expansions of liquid velocity, bulk surfactant concentration and pressure in the ligament, as proposed by Eggers and Dupont (1994), was carried out at low Reynolds number. The effect on jet dynamics of a soluble surfactant combined with either a generalized Newtonian liquid (Carreau fluid) or an elastic liquid (Johnson-Segalman) was analyzed. Using the model developed, the adsorption and desorption kinetics {{in the case of a}} generalized Newtonian liquid jet were shown to rely on the initial interfacial concentration of surfactant: if the surfactant at the jet exit plane was initially at the thermodynamic equilibrium value, a slowly adsorbed/desorbed surfactant could lead to a jump in satellite drop size (Mac, the critical Marangoni number, ∼ 1), while if the thermodynamic equilibrium concentration was not originally reached a the jet exit plane a slowly adsorbed/desorbed surfactant rarely led to a jump in satellite drop size (Mac 3 ̆e 2). It was also shown that a soluble surfactant (low solubility number S) with fast <b>adsorption</b> (large <b>adsorption</b> <b>number</b> Kd) did not favor the formation of satellite drops and that the dynamics of jet breakup were not altered when changing the initial interfacial surfactant concentration (at thermodynamic equilibrium concentrations or not) for a surfactant with fast adsorption.

Fracture energy was measured using a single-edge notched bending test and the strain-softening index was estimated by dividing the fracture energy by the maximum load. Adsorption properties were estimated using adsorption isotherms. Fiber saturation points (FSPs) were estimated by extrapolating the moisture adsorption isotherm curve. Langmuir’s <b>adsorption</b> coefficient and <b>number</b> of <b>adsorption</b> sites were obtained using Langmuir’s theory and the Hailwood-Horrobin theory, respectively. The fracture energy, FSPs, and specimen weights decreased at temperatures higher than 150 °C, but the critical point for the strain-softening index and the <b>number</b> of <b>adsorption</b> sites was shown to be 180 °C. We hypothesize that the fracture energy and FSP depend on the chemical structure of the cell wall, whereas the strain-softening behavior {{may be influenced by}} the <b>number</b> of <b>adsorption</b> sites, and in turn the number of hydrogen bonds in hemicellulose...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Ultrasound {{has been}} shown to {{increase}} the efficiency of gene expression from retroviruses, adenoviruses and adeno-associated viruses. The effect of ultrasound to stimulate cell membrane permeabilization on infection with an oncolytic herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV- 1) was examined. Results Vero monkey kidney cells were infected with HSV- 1 and exposed to 1 MHz ultrasound after an <b>adsorption</b> period. The <b>number</b> of plaques was significantly greater than that of the untreated control. A combination of ultrasound and microbubbles further increased the plaque number. Similar results were obtained using a different type of HSV- 1 and oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells. The appropriate intensity, duty cycle and time of ultrasound to increase the plaque number were 0. 5 W/cm 2, 20 % duty cycle and 10 sec, respectively. Ultrasound with microbubbles at an intensity of 2. 0 W/cm 2, at 50 % duty cycle, or for 40 sec reduced cell viability. Conclusion These results indicate that ultrasound promotes the entry of oncolytic HSV- 1 into cells. It may be useful to enhance the efficiency of HSV- 1 infection in oncolytic virotherapy. </p...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSwelling clays act as ion-exchange {{membranes}} {{owing to}} the presence of extra-framework ions surrounded by water molecules. A better understanding of the motion of the ions present in the pore space is required to predict the diffusion properties in these solids. Since water molecules tend to adsorb both on ions and clay surfaces, they moderate the interactions between the ions and the framework. The hydration of ions therefore has an impact on their diffusion properties. In this paper, the MX- 80 montmorillonite considered for nuclear waste disposal applications has been selected and studied using an approach combining measurements of complex impedance spectroscopy and water <b>adsorption</b> isotherms. The <b>number</b> of charge carriers has been estimated, and the diffusion coefficient for interlayer cations at various hydration states was determined. The evolution of the diffusion coefficient is subsequently correlated with the effect of the opening of the interlayer space and its hydration state. The resulting picture sheds light on the reversible or irreversible character of ion exchange. Finally, our results obtained from the difference between the interlayer diffusion coefficients extracted from conductivity measurements and those obtained at the macroscopic scale is discussed in terms of the textural parameters...|$|R
40|$|The {{adsorption}} {{of hydrogen}} molecule {{on a novel}} structure of Ti containing organometallic complexes grafted on silsequioxanes (SQ, H 8 Si 8 O 12) was investigated by means of DFT method. The hydrogen adsorption properties of the complex structures TiRH 7 Si 8 O 12 (R = C 4 H 3, C 5 H 4, C 6 H 5) keep almost {{the same as that}} of corresponding Ti containing organometallic complexes. Moreover, these complex structures can avoid the problem of transition metal clustering which is a disadvantage for hydrogen <b>adsorption.</b> The maximum <b>number</b> of hydrogen molecules adsorbed was still determined by 18 electron rule, that is to say 5, 4, and 4 H- 2 molecules for TiRH 7 Si 8 O 12 with R = C 4 H 3, C 5 H 4, and C 6 H 5, respectively. At the same time, all the average binding energy of H- 2 is located in 0. 2 - 1. 0 eV, which is an advantage for hydrogen storage at ambient conditions. Therefore, the materials studied here may provide some enlightenment for developing new types of hydrogen storage materials...|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} of melamine (MM) and its related compounds (MARCs), i. e. Ammeline (AMN), Ammelide (AMD), Cyanuric acid (CA) with native Herring Sperm DNA (HS-DNA) {{has been investigated}} by cyclic voltammetric studies at glassy carbon electrode (GCE) in phosphate buffer (PBS at pH 7. 0). It was observed that the electrochemical processes of the 4 MARCs at a bare GCE were quasireversible. By adding HS-DNA into the MARCs solutions, a decrease in reduction peak current of MARCs with a slight negative shift in peak potential values was observed. The reduction peak current (Ipc) {{of any of the}} MARCs, either in absence or presence of HS-DNA, varied linearly with scan rate (v) rather than v 1 / 2, which indicated that the electrode process was controlled by <b>adsorption</b> step. The <b>number</b> of electrons transferred per molecule (n) of MM or the other three MARCs was calculated to be ca. 2. Electrochemical parameters (charge transfer coefficient α and the standard rate constant ks) of free MARCs and binding compounds were obtained according to Laviron theory. The interactions between MARCs and HS-DNA were presumed in groove mode with the interaction constants to b...|$|R
40|$|Mesoporous {{material}} RH-MCM- 41 was synthesized {{with rice}} husk silica by a hydrothermal method. It {{was used as}} a support for bimetallic platinum−iron catalysts Pt–Fe/RH-MCM- 41 for phenol hydroxylation. The catalysts were prepared by co-impregnation with Pt and Fe at amounts of 0. 5 and 5. 0 wt. %, respectively. The RH-MCM- 41 structure in the catalysts was studied with x-ray diffraction, and their surface areas were determined by nitrogen <b>adsorption.</b> The oxidation <b>number</b> of Fe supported on RH-MCM- 41 was + 3, as determined by x-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) analysis. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of all the catalysts displayed well-ordered structures, and metal nanoparticles were observed in some catalysts. All the catalysts were active for phenol hydroxylation using H 2 O 2 as the oxidant at phenol : H 2 O 2 mole ratios of 2 : 1, 2 : 2, 2 : 3 and 2 : 4. The first three ratios produced only catechol and hydroquinone, whereas the 2 : 4 ratio also produced benzoquinone. The 2 : 3 ratio gave the highest phenol conversion of 47 % at 70 °C. The catalyst prepared by co-impregnation with Pt and Fe was more active than that prepared using a physical mixture of Pt/RH-MCM- 41 and Fe/RH-MCM- 41...|$|R
