5|$|It is the {{combination}} of warm humid <b>air</b> <b>from</b> the Gulf and dry <b>air</b> <b>from</b> the deserts of the Southwest that produce deadly storms. These conditions create an unstable severe storm creating arena. Although tornadoes occur on every continent except Antarctica they are especially common in North America, specifically the United States.|$|E
5|$|Oklahoma is in a humid {{subtropical}} region. Oklahoma lies in {{a transition}} zone between humid continental climate to the north, semi-arid climate to the west, and humid subtropical climate in the central, south and eastern portions of the state. Most of the state {{lies in a}}n area known as Tornado Alley characterized by frequent interaction between cold, dry <b>air</b> <b>from</b> Canada, warm to hot, dry <b>air</b> <b>from</b> Mexico and the Southwestern U.S., and warm, moist <b>air</b> <b>from</b> the Gulf of Mexico. The interactions between these three contrasting air currents produces severe weather (severe thunderstorms, damaging thunderstorm winds, large hail and tornadoes) with a frequency virtually unseen anywhere else on planet Earth. An average 62 tornadoes strike the state per year—one of the highest rates in the world.|$|E

5|$|These {{can occur}} in sea breezes or in desert regions. In a sea-breeze front, cold <b>air</b> <b>from</b> the sea meets the warmer <b>air</b> <b>from</b> the land and creates a {{boundary}} between two masses of air like a shallow cold front. Glider pilots can gain altitude by flying along the intersection {{as if it were}} a ridge of land. Convergence may occur over considerable distances and so may permit virtually straight flight while climbing.|$|E
5|$|A pulmonic {{consonant}} is a consonant made by obstructing the glottis (the {{space between}} the vocal cords) or oral cavity (the mouth) and either simultaneously or subsequently letting out <b>air</b> <b>from</b> the lungs.

5|$|An active trough of low {{pressure}} exited the East Coast of the United States on May 12, {{and by the}} following day it passed near Bermuda. Initially the trough was located only near the surface, though as cold <b>air</b> <b>from</b> behind it advanced eastward, the trough extended into the mid- to upper-levels of the atmosphere. By May 14 a closed {{low pressure}} area developed in seclusion from the westerlies. Continued cold <b>air</b> <b>from</b> behind the trough, about 12°F (7°C) colder than usual for the time of year, extended across the low in conjunction with warm upper levels and warm sea surface temperatures, resulting in large amounts of instability. The polar trough gradually weakened as the low organized, and on May 15 it developed into a subtropical depression while located about 300miles (480km) south of Bermuda.|$|E

50|$|Prior to {{combining}} {{programming content}} with North Norfolk Radio and Radio Norwich 99.9, The Beach had four main programming segments. Breakfast on the Beach, <b>airing</b> <b>from</b> 6am—10am, was presented by Paul Carter. Daytime, <b>airing</b> <b>from</b> 10am—3pm, was helmed by Mikey Faulkner. Drivetime, <b>airing</b> <b>from</b> 3pm—7pm (6.30pm on Thursdays) was chaired by Tim Lindon, and Evenings, <b>airing</b> <b>from</b> 7pm—10pm, were presented by Joff Hopkins (although this programme was shared across all Anglian Radio networks, and was broadcast from Ipswich).|$|R

5|$|As the mesocyclone lowers {{below the}} cloud base, {{it begins to}} take in cool, moist <b>air</b> <b>from</b> the {{downdraft}} region of the storm. The convergence of warm air in the updraft and cool air causes a rotating wall cloud to form. The RFD also focuses the mesocyclone's base, causing it to draw <b>air</b> <b>from</b> a smaller and smaller area on the ground. As the updraft intensifies, it creates an {{area of low pressure}} at the surface. This pulls the focused mesocyclone down, {{in the form of a}} visible condensation funnel. As the funnel descends, the RFD also reaches the ground, fanning outward and creating a gust front that can cause severe damage a considerable distance from the tornado. Usually, the funnel cloud begins causing damage on the ground (becoming a tornado) within a few minutes of the RFD reaching the ground.|$|E
5|$|Brașov and its surroundings, {{including}} the city's Black Church, were severely affected. According to local chronicles, {{in the village}} of Bod, more than 50 houses and several churches were damaged or destroyed. In Feldioara, a column of water rose several meters into the <b>air</b> <b>from</b> a crack caused by the earthquake. Buildings collapsed in Sibiu, {{including the}} city's Catholic church.|$|E
5|$|Breathing {{involves}} expelling stale <b>air</b> <b>from</b> the blowhole, {{forming an}} upward, steamy spout, followed by inhaling fresh {{air into the}} lungs; a humpback whale's lungs can hold about 5,000 litres of air. Spout shapes differ among species, which facilitates identification.|$|E

5|$|Directly {{under the}} {{subtropical}} ridge are the doldrums, or horse latitudes, where winds are lighter. Many of the Earth's deserts lie near the average latitude of the subtropical ridge, where descent reduces the relative humidity {{of the air}} mass. The strongest winds are in the mid-latitudes where cold polar air meets warm <b>air</b> <b>from</b> the tropics.|$|E
5|$|In general, La Niña {{events are}} {{associated}} with lower temperatures (particularly colder winters) in the Pampas. During winter, frosts are more common during La Niña events compared to El Niño events. This {{is due to a}} stronger southerly flow during La Niña events caused by a higher concentration of high pressure systems in the South Pacific and an increase in cyclonic activity (more low pressure systems) in the South Atlantic. This creates conditions that are favourable for bringing cold <b>air</b> <b>from</b> the south, particularly when there is a formation of a high pressure system over Patagonia (associated with the passage of a front) that is responsible for bringing cold <b>air</b> <b>from</b> the south. Thus, invasions of cold <b>air</b> <b>from</b> the south are more common during La Niña events. In contrast, warm spells in the Pampas and northern parts of the country are more intense and frequent during El Niño events. This is due to stronger westerly winds south of 40oS, leading to less frequent incursions of cold <b>air</b> <b>from</b> the south while enhancing winds from the north that bring in warm air. Although La Niña events lead to colder winters with more frequent incursions of cold air in both the north and central parts of the country, it leads to more frequent and intense warm spells in the last months of the year. In other regions, El Niño events lead to more frequent and intense warm spells in Northwest Argentina (during autumn), northeast Argentina (during spring) and central Argentina (during summer). Cold air anomalies arising from El Niño events are observed during spring and are the result of an increase in rainfall that lead to reductions in insolation. For the southern parts of the country, El Niño events {{are associated with}} more intense and frequent cold spells during the coldest months. In summer, El Niño events are associated with warmer summer temperatures in the southern parts of the country.|$|E
5|$|Joyce {{dissipated}} {{in an area}} of low {{wind shear}} and warm sea surface temperatures. The National Hurricane Center attributed the weakening to dry <b>air</b> <b>from</b> the Sahara. The dry air may have been caused by a lack of southwesterlies bring moisture from equatorial areas, and continental influence from South America.|$|E

5|$|Severe storms impact {{large cities}} {{more often and}} can damage cars, houses and disrupt public {{services}} such as transportation and collection and disposal of urban solid waste. The foothills of the Andes and the Sierras de Cordoba are vulnerable to hail. This is because the Andes force humid <b>air</b> <b>from</b> the Atlantic upwards, intensifying the updrafts within thunderstorms, making hail more likely. Mendoza, a city located in the Andean foothills, experiences frequent hailstorms that can impact the agriculture of the region. Hailstorms have caused serious losses in both urban and rural areas. It is estimated that wine and fruit production experience yearly losses of US$50 million and US$30 million, respectively, due to hail. Most of these hailstorms occur in the summer although they can occur in winter, particularly in the east where warm and humid <b>air</b> <b>from</b> the north frequently collides with cold <b>air</b> <b>from</b> the south, leading to convective thunderstorms that can produce hail.|$|E

50|$|The {{premiere of}} Texas {{came at a}} time when NBC's daytime lineup (consisting of Another World, Days of Our Lives, and The Doctors) had fallen into ratings trouble, after a highly {{successful}} period in the early and mid-1970s. Given that the show <b>aired</b> <b>from</b> 3:00-4:00 PM (EST), it caused a small domino effect on the NBC daytime schedule: Another World, which had become daytime's first 90-minute drama 17 months earlier (<b>airing</b> <b>from</b> 2:30-4:00 PM), was scaled back to 60 minutes and <b>aired</b> <b>from</b> 2:00-3:00 PM; and The Doctors, which previously <b>aired</b> <b>from</b> 2:00-2:30 PM, now moved to 12:30-1:00 PM.|$|R
5|$|The {{westerlies}} {{explain why}} coastal North America {{tends to be}} wet, especially from Northern California to Alaska, during the winter. Differential heating from the sun between the land which is quite cool and the ocean which is relatively warm causes areas of low pressure to develop over land. This results in moisture rich <b>air</b> <b>from</b> the Pacific Ocean to flow from the west, resulting in frequent rainstorms and wind on the coast. This moisture continues to flow eastward until orographic lift caused by the Coast, Cascade, Columbia and Rocky Mountains cause a rain shadow effect which limits further penetration of these systems and associated rainfall eastward. This trend reverses in the summer when strong heating of the land causes high pressure and tends to block moisture-rich <b>air</b> <b>from</b> the Pacific from reaching land. This explains why most of coastal North America in the middle latitudes experiences dry summers, despite abundant rainfall in the winter.|$|E
5|$|Thunderstorms {{can form}} and develop in any {{geographic}} location but most frequently within the mid-latitude, where warm, moist <b>air</b> <b>from</b> tropical latitudes collides with cooler <b>air</b> <b>from</b> polar latitudes. Thunderstorms {{are responsible for}} the development and formation of many severe weather phenomena. Thunderstorms, and the phenomena that occur along with them, pose great hazards. Damage that results from thunderstorms is mainly inflicted by downburst winds, large hailstones, and flash flooding caused by heavy precipitation. Stronger thunderstorm cells are capable of producing tornadoes and waterspouts.|$|E
5|$|A broad area of low {{pressure}} organized into a tropical depression {{off the coast}} of Nicaragua on October 9.
