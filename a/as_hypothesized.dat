5|$|Tyche was a {{hypothetical}} gas giant proposed {{to be located}} in the Solar System's Oort cloud. It was first proposed in 1999 by astrophysicists John Matese, Patrick Whitman and Daniel Whitmire of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. They argued that evidence of Tyche's existence could be seen in a supposed bias in the points of origin for long-period comets. In 2013, Matese and Whitmire re-evaluated the comet data and noted that Tyche, if it existed, would be detectable in the archive of data that was collected by NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) telescope. In 2014, NASA announced that the WISE survey had ruled out any object with Tyche's characteristics, indicating that Tyche <b>as</b> <b>hypothesized</b> by Matese, Whitman, and Whitmire does not exist.|$|E

2500|$|<b>As</b> <b>hypothesized</b> by Rezachevici, Paisie {{was able}} to reconquer Wallachia only {{with support from the}} Eastern Hungarian Kingdom of John Zápolya, driving his loyalist troops in from Transylvania. Among the primary sources, Olahus claimed that his cousin was in Transylvania during the exile interval. Mărăcine was chased out of the land. His later life gave rise to many legends. According to Rezachievici, the most {{plausible}} one is that he was quietly murdered in Istanbul, being survived by his son, the pretender Nicolaus Bassaraba. Paisie was then able to re-consolidate his power, turning to violent repression. Victims of his revenge included Tudor of Drăgoești, the country's Logothete, and Ban Toma of Pietroșani. Boyars on the loyalist side were led by Vlaicu Piscan, who took over as Logothete, Clucer Coadă, and Vornic Staico Șintescu, as well as Radu Furcovici, who held various commissions and was Paisie's godson.|$|E
2500|$|Kacelnik et al. {{wanted to}} {{determine}} if this species does indeed optimize net energy gain per unit time <b>as</b> <b>hypothesized.</b> They designed an experiment in which the starlings were trained to collect mealworms from an artificial feeder at different distances from the nest. The researchers artificially generated a fixed curve of diminishing returns for the birds by dropping mealworms at successively longer and longer intervals. The birds continued to collect mealworms as they were presented, until they reached an [...] "optimal" [...] load and flew home. As Figure 5 shows, if the starlings were maximizing net energy gain per unit time, a short travel time would predict a small optimal load and a long travel time would predict a larger optimal load. In agreement with these predictions, Kacelnik found that the longer {{the distance between the}} nest and the artificial feeder, the larger the load size. In addition, the observed load sizes quantitatively corresponded very closely to the model's predictions. Other models based on different currencies, such as energy gained per energy spent (i.e. energy efficiency), failed to predict the observed load sizes as accurately. [...] Thus, Kacelnik concluded that starlings maximize net energy gain per unit time. This conclusion was not disproved in later experiments.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedThe ubiquity of Internet chat applications has benefited many different segments of society. It also creates opportunities for criminal enterprise, terrorism, and espionage. This thesis proposes statistical Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods for creating systems that would detect {{the topic of}} chat in support of larger NLP goals such as information retrieval, text classification and illicit activity detection. We propose a novel method for determining the topic of chat discourse. We trained Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) models on source documents and then used inferred topic distributions as feature vectors for a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification system. We constructed LDA models in three ways: We considered the collective posts of authors <b>as</b> documents, <b>hypothesizing</b> that we could detect the topic physics given only {{one side of the}} conversation. The resultant classifiers obtained F-scores of 0. 906. Next, we considered individual posts <b>as</b> documents, <b>hypothesizing</b> we could detect physics posts. The resultant classifiers obtained F-scores of 0. 481. Finally, we considered physics textbook paragraphs <b>as</b> documents, <b>hypothesizing</b> that we could determine the topic of an author or a post based on an LDA model created from a textbook and a sample of noisy chat. The resultant classifiers obtained F-scores of 0. 848 and 0. 536 respectively. US Navy (USN) author...|$|R
