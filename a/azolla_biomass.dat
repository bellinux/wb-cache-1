The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the rate of phenol adsorption by modified Azolla and Canola. Methods: This study was conducted at laboratory scale. In this study the effect of various parameters on adsorption performance was investigated and isotherms and kenitics adsorption were determined. In order to measure the specific surface area of absorbents the BET isotherm technique was carried out. The concentration of phenol in samples was measured by HPLC instrument. Results: Removal efficiency increased with increase of adsorbent dose and contact time and decrease of the initial concentration of phenol. Optimal phenol removal was obtained at pH = 3, adsorbent dose of 10 g/L and contact time of 90 and 120 min for <b>Azolla</b> and Canola <b>biomass</b> respectively. Coefficients showed that the best isotherms for Azolla and Canola adsorbents are Langmuier and Freundlich respectively. The reaction rate for both adsorbents agrees with the pseudo-second order kenitics model. Based on the Langmuier model, the maximum adsorption capacities were calculated to be 11. 2 and 9. 4 mg/g for <b>Azolla</b> and Canola <b>biomasses</b> respectively.

40|$|In {{addition}} to its high protein content, <b>Azolla</b> <b>biomass</b> contains various compounds {{that can be used}} to produce bio-fuels and specialty chemicals. Azolla has very advantageous traits for large-scale cultivation, including a fast growth rate, sustained without nitrogen fertilization due to nitrogen fixation by its symbiotic cyanobacteria. Furthermore, arable land is not required for its cultivation as it thrives on shallow fresh waters. Azolla therefore should be considered as a novel crop in the bio-based economy. This study addresses major knowledge gaps and potential bottlenecks associated with introducing Azolla as feedstock for a bio-refinery. 1) Currently, Azolla varieties cannot be preserved in a reliable way, discouraging further research and development critical for its domestication and breeding. 2) Sexual reproduction of Azolla cannot be controlled to limit dispersal outside cultivation areas and thereby ensure bio-safety. 3) Insufficient knowledge exists of the molecular composition of <b>Azolla</b> <b>biomass,</b> to assess the viability of an Azolla biorefinery.

40|$|Background: The {{quest for}} {{sustainable}} production of renewable and cheap biofuels has triggered an intensive search for domestication {{of the next}} generation of bioenergy crops. Aquatic plants which can rapidly colonize wetlands are attracting attention because of their ability to grow in wastewaters and produce large amounts of biomass. Representatives of Azolla species are some of the fastest growing plants, producing substantial biomass when growing in contaminated water and natural ecosystems. Together with their evolutional symbiont, the cyanobacterium Anabaena azollae, <b>Azolla</b> <b>biomass</b> has a unique chemical composition accumulating in each leaf including three major types of bioenergy molecules: cellulose/hemicellulose, starch and lipids, resembling combinations of terrestrial bioenergy crops and microalgae. Results: The growth of Azolla filiculoides in synthetic wastewater led up to 25, 69, 24 and 40 % reduction of NH 4 -N, NO 3 -N, PO 4 -P and selenium, respectively, after 5 days of treatment. This led to a 2. 6 -fold reduction in toxicity of the treated wastewater to shrimps, common inhabitants of wetlands. Two Azolla species, Azolla filiculoides and Azolla pinnata, were used as feedstock for the production of a range of functional hydrocarbons through hydrothermal liquefaction, bio-hydrogen and bio-ethanol. Given the high annual productivity of Azolla, hydrothermal liquefaction can lead to the theoretical production of 20. 2 t/ha-year of bio-oil and 48 t/ha-year of bio-char. The ethanol production from Azolla filiculoides, 11. 7 × 103 L/ha-year, is close to that from corn stover (13. 3 × 103 L/ha-year), but higher than from miscanthus (2. 3 × 103 L/ha-year) and woody plants, such as willow (0. 3 × 103 L/ha-year) and poplar (1. 3 × 103 L/ ha-year).

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the storage of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in the biomass, bed sediments and water column of representative reaches of a sub-tropical river, the upper Brisbane River (UBR), Queensland, Australia, and contrasted instream storage with total wet season exports. In reaches which contained accumulated fine sediments, more than 87 % of total P and between 50 % and 92 % of total N were stored in the surface sediments. The lower proportion of N in sediment at some sites was attributed to substantial differences in the N/P ratios of sediments and macrophytes. At one site, the riverbed was dominated by cobbles and boulders and total nutrient stocks were comparatively low and dominated by the biomass. In reaches with a narrow channel and intact riparian cover, biomass N and P were stored predominately in leaf litter, while in wider unshaded reaches, macrophytes dominated. Total instream storage {{in the mid to}} lower reaches of the UBR was ~ 50. 9 T for N and ~ 18. 1 T for P. This was considerably higher than total wet season N (~ 15. 6 T) and P (~ 2. 7 T) exports from the UBR. The first flow event in the river after a prolonged period of no flow resulted in the export of free-floating, emergent species <b>Azolla.</b> The estimated <b>biomass</b> of <b>Azolla</b> in the mid to lower reaches of the river was equivalent to approximately 24 % and 9 % of the total N and P flux, indicating that this may be a significant, previously unaccounted for, source at peak flow.

The effects of factors such as metal starting concentration, pH and two metals in solution on the removal of Ni and Cu from aqueous solution by dried and crushed Azalia biomass were studied in batch systems. Aqueous solutions of Ni with starting concentrations between 1000 and 2000 J. lmolll gave the most efficient Ni removal by Azalla biomass. For Cu the optimum starting concentration for adsorption was 50 J. lmol/l. The adsorption capacity of both eu and Ni increased as the starting pH of the sorption media increased. The optimum pH for Ni adsorption was found at pH 7 and for Cu, at pH 5. - Awlla biomass had a higher. maximum binding capacity (qrnax) for Cu than for Ni at pH 5. The removal of both Cu allct Ni showed little or no variation with the presence another metal in solution. Kinetic studies show that both Cu and Ni adsorbed rapidly onto the Azalia biomass. The removal of Cu and Ni from aqueous solutions using non-viable Azalia biomass was investigated in a lab scale fixed-bed column and an upscaled 4 L column system. The nonviable Azalla filiculaides biomass when dried and used in a column for adsorption of Cu and Ni showed good physical stability under many different conditions. Preparation of the biomass before it could be used in the columns was very simple and did not involve any significant pretreatment steps. Prolonged exposure to UV light decreases Azalia biomass capacity for Ni and Cu adsorption. Column adsorption of Cu and Ni from aqueous solutions was successfully upscaled approximately 100 times. Relative to the lab scale column, the 4 L column performed better for the uptake of Cu and Ni per gram of biomass. The larger column was also able to operate at relatively higher flow rates. The biomass showed good reusability with little change in the amount of Ni adsorbed in 10 consecutive cycles.

40|$|Growing {{worldwide}} {{demands for}} food, energy and chemicals threatens natural ecosystems and global climate. Plants are crucial for food production, {{but may also}} be used to produce sustainable energy and materials. Hereto novel crops are sought with high productivity per hectare, whilst requiring minimal fossil fuel or fertilizer input. The aquatic fern Azolla is a potential novel crop due to its rapid growth, symbiosis with a nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria and favorable chemical composition. The aim of this thesis is to provide the knowledge and methods necessary to turn the aquatic weed Azolla into a sustainable crop. To provide reliable starting material for cultivation we developed methods to collect, store, fertilize and germinate Azolla spores. Drying for 7 days followed by freezing in liquid nitrogen (cryopreservation) allowed to preserve Azolla spores at - 80 °C for up to 7 months, as well as the cyanobacteria symbiont residing inside the spores. To better understand the mechanism leading to the formation of spores (sporulation), a first transcriptome database of Azolla was constructed, revealing that ferns have many genes alike those regulating sexual reproduction in seed plants. Growth potentials of A. filiculoides and A. pinnata were determined at 35. 5 and 32. 8 t dry weight (dw) ha- 1 year- 1, respectively. Addition of CO 2 up to 800 ppm boosted biomass productivity to 48. 3 t dw ha- 1 year- 1. Under ambient CO 2, N 2 -fixation by the fern’s cyanobacterial symbionts completely supported Azolla’s rapid growth, fixing 1200 kg N ha- 1 annually. Nitrogen was predominantly fixed during the day by the phototropic Nostoc Azollae. Analysis of diel transcript profiles and microscopic investigations revealed several adaptations to this form of N-supply in Azolla’s metabolism, leaf architecture and transcriptional regulation of nutrient transport. Rapidly growing Azolla contained between 17. 6 - 20. 8 % protein, valuable as feed due to a high content of essential amino acids compared to soybean meal. While elevated CO 2 concentrations boosted biomass yield, protein content and amino acid composition remained similar. <b>Azolla</b> <b>biomass</b> further contained 7. 9 - 10. 0 % lipids of which 41 ± 13 % consisted of fatty acids that could be converted into biodiesel. Azolla biodiesel meets requirements set by European standards on fuel density, cetane number and iodine value. However, a fractionation step will be required to decrease the high Cold Filter Plugging Point. Azolla was shown to have a relatively high content of soluble (poly) phenols, including 4. 0 - 5. 8 % of condensed tannins, that are known to limit protein digestibility. Various polyphenol biosynthesis genes were identified in the A. filiculoides genome, including a highly expressed Leuco-Anthocyanidin Reductase (AzfiLAR-like), likely essential for the synthesis of condensed tannins. Digestibility of <b>Azolla</b> <b>biomass</b> may be enhanced by manipulating (poly) phenol biosynthesis, e. g. by knocking out the AzfiLAR-like gene, or by extracting protein separately from the (poly) phenols. Since the formation of protein-tannin complexes limited the yield of alkaline protein extraction we developed two methods to produce protein extracts with reduced (poly) phenol content: pre-extraction using aqueous acetone and competitive binding of tannins to polyethylene glycol during extraction. Both methods produced a protein precipitate containing 38 % of total biomass nitrogen, while considerably reducing (<- 67 %) (poly) phenol content...|$|E

The nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur (NPS) uptake in grain and straw increased significantly by about 40 - 84, 45. 3 - 109 and 41 - 87 %, respectively, due to incorporation of Azolla over control. The difference between two plant spacings was not significant. Interaction effect between plant spacing and Azolla -urea treatments also did not exhibit any significant variation...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} the biofiltration {{ability of the}} aquatic fern Azolla to remove polyphenols and chemical oxygen demand (COD) from olive mill wastewater (OMWw) collected from the traditional (TS) and continuous (CS) extraction systems. <b>Azolla</b> <b>biomass</b> was packed into five sequential Imhoff cones and five sequential columns. In both experiments, the filtrates collected from the 5 th biofilter showed a decrease in polyphenol contents: from 7650 mg l – 1 to 3610 mg l – 1 in TS OMWw and from 3852 mg l – 1 to 1351 mg l – 1 in CS OMWw. The COD contents decreased from 110200 mg L – 1 to 52400 mg L – 1 in TS OMWw and from 41600 mg L – 1 to 2300 mg L – 1 in CS OMWw. A 5 : 1 OMWw to Azolla -fresh-weight ratio was optimal for both polyphenol and COD removal. The biofiltration ability of alfalfa was {{compared with that of}} Azolla, but the treatment with alfalfa did not result in the reduction of COD or polyphenols. La eficacia del helecho de agua azolla para eliminar polifenoles y reducir la demanda química de oxígeno (DQO) de los alpechines obtenidos en el proceso de obtención tradicional y continuo del aceite de oliva, fue investigado mediante ensayos de filtración. Cinco conos secuenciales de Imhoff y cinco columnas secuenciales se rellenaron de biomasa de Azolla. En ambos experimentos, el filtrado procedente de la quinta extracción mostró una disminución en el contenido de polifenoles de 7650 mg L – 1 a 3610 mg L – 1 en el alpechín obtenido mediante el sistema tradicional y de 3852 mg L – 1 a 1351 mg L – 1 en el alpechín del sistema continuo. La demanda química de oxígeno del alpechín del sistema tradicional disminuyó de 110200 mg L – 1 a 52400 mg L – 1 en y de 41600 mg L – 1 a 2300 mg L – 1 en el procedente del sistema continuo. Una proporción en peso 5 : 1 de alpechín: Azolla fue la óptima tanto para la reducción de los polifenoles como para la de la DQO. La eficiencia del tratamiento biológico con alfalfa se comparó con la obtenida con Azolla.

40|$|The {{removal of}} lead from aqueous {{solution}} and lead-acid battery manufacturing waste-water by the non-viable biomass {{of the water}} fern Azolla filiculoides was investigated in both batch and column reactors. The maximum lead uptake by the <b>Azolla</b> <b>biomass</b> at a pH value of approximately 5, {{was found to be}} 100 mg lead/g biomass from aqueous solution. Lead removal varied from 30 % of the initial lead concentration at pH 1. 5 to approximately 95 % at pH values of 3. 5 and 5. 6. Lead removal from aqueous solution decreased to 30 % of the initial lead concentration if the lead concentration was initially over 400 mg/l. At initial lead concentrations of less than 400 mg/l, percentage lead removal was found to be over 90 % of the initial lead concentration. Lead removal remained at approximately 90 % between 10 °C and 50 °C. Biomass concentration (4 - 8 mg/l) had little effect on lead removal. The presence of iron (Fe) and lead, copper (Cu) and lead or all three metal ions in solution at varying ratios to each other did not appear to have any significant effect on lead removal. Percentage lead, copper and iron removal from aqueous solution was 80 - 95, 45 - 50 and 65 - 75 % respectively for the different multiple-metal solutions studied. No break-through points were observed for lead removal from aqueous solutions in column reactors, with initial lead concentrations of less than 100 mg/l at varying flow rates of 2, 5 and 10 ml/min. This suggested that flow rate, and therefore retention time, had little effect on percentage lead removal from aqueous solution, which was more that 95 %, at low initial lead concentrations (less than 100 mg/l). At initial lead concentrations of 200 mg/l or more, an increase in flow rate, which equates to a decrease in column retention time, resulted in break-through points occurring earlier in the column run. Percentage lead removal values, from lead-acid battery efiluent in column systems, of over 95 % were achieved. Desorption of approximately 30 % and 40 % of bound lead was achieved, with 0. 5 M HNO₃ in a volume of 50 ml, from two lead-acid battery. Repeated adsorption and desorption of lead by the Azalia biomass over 10 cycles did not result in any decrease in the percentage lead removal from effluent, which strongly suggested that the Azalla biomass could be re-used a number of times without deterioration in its physical integrity, or lead removal capacity. No evidence of deterioration in the Azolla biomass's physical integrity after 10 successive adsorption and desorption procedures was observed using scanning electron microscopy. The Azolla filiculoides biomass was, therefore, found to be able to effectively remove lead from aqueous solution and lead-acid battery effluent repeatedly, with no observed reduction in it's uptake capacity or physical integrity. ...|$|E
40|$|Azolla, a small {{free-floating}} fern {{associated with}} the nitrogen-fixing alga Anabaena azollae, is used by rice farmers in Asia as a natural, low-cost source of fertilizer nitrogen. However, farmers elsewhere in the tropics have not been so ready to incorporate Azolla culture into their cultivation practices. The benefits of Azolla, and the limitations in its use, should be assessed carefully by farmers in Africa, the Caribbean and Pacific. Inorganic nitrogen fertiliz ers are expensive, and supplies remain inadequate and uncertain {{for the majority of}} farmers in the tropics. Nitrogen-fixing crops and trees, composted crop wastes and livestock manures are least-cost alternative sources of nitrogen which have been adopted by farmers {{in a wide range of}} situations. Another option, specifically for those growing rice on flooded or irrigated land, is the use of Azolla. Azolla plants form dense mats on water surfaces in ponds, ditches and rice fields throughout the warm, temperate and tropical regions of the world. Each leaf lobe has a cavity containing the blue-green nitrogen-fixing alga Anabaena azollae. The two plants have a symbiotic relationship; Anabaena providing nitrogen compounds in exchange for carbon compounds from photosynthesis. Azolla has long been used as both a green manure for rice and as a fodder for poultry and livestock in China and Vietnam. Azolla can grow exponentially, doubling its biomass in 5 - 10 days. Yields of over 30 t/ha of fresh weight are possible, containing over 2. 5 t/ha dry matter. Protein content of 13 - 23 % of dry matter makes the product a useful feedstuff, although fibre and mineral contents are also high. Production potential As a source of fertilizer nitrogen, the Azolla Anabaena symbiosis can fix 100 - 170 kg N/hectare/year. Under field conditions selected species can fix about 1. 2 kg N/day and in excess of 40 kg N in 35 days. Azolla is very responsive to phosphorus and requires a continuous supply for rapid growth. Trials have shown that each kilogramme of phosphorus resulted in more than 5 kg of additional nitrogen in the <b>Azolla</b> <b>biomass</b> after 35 days' growth. Most research on Azolla in the tropics has been carried out in Asia, but trials were conducted simultaneously by the West African Rice Development Association (WARDA) at the Richard Toll Forage Station (Senegal) under semi-arid conditions and at Rokupr (Sierra Leone), which has a wet humid climate. These have indicated its potential but also its limitations in the semi-arid Sahelian zone and in the humid tropic zone of Africa. In northern Senegal, where farmers apply nitrogen at high rates (120 kg N/ha) it was demonstrated that up to 50 % of the mineral N can be supplied by Azolla. In the mangrove swamps of Sierra Leone Azolla nitrogen can completely replace mineral N at the recommended rate of 40 kg N/ha. Azolla can also control weeds in irrigated rice. Constraints Azolla growth depends on a constant and sufficient depth of water in rice fields. In Asia, where rice is transplanted into flooded paddies, inoculation with Azolla is followed by a very rapid proliferation, a suppression of weeds and a generous production of nitrogen. In sub-Saharan Africa there are few places where water is available in sufficient quantity to maintain constant flooding. As a result, farmers have to balance the cost of pumping water to maintain sufficient depth for Azolla growth against the cost of purchased mineral nitrogen. In many instances the cost of pumping plus the additional labour cost involved in producing Azolla can exceed the cost of mineral nitrogen. Where post-emergence herbicides are used Azolla can only be inoculated after reflooding the field and the beneficial effects of the Azolla are limited to weed control for the current crop and residual nitrogen for a following crop. In village irrigation systems transplanting is more common, but soils are more permeable, water is more limited and much of the land may be without standing water for several days. In such situations Azolla cannot thrive. On balance Near most rice areas there are natural depressions, which are flooded by rainwater during the short wet season or by drainage from the larger irrigated areas. These natural water bodies can be inoculated with Azolla, which can subsequently be composted for crop production or dried for animal fodder. Azolla can play an important role in intensive agriculture systems. One hectare of Azolla can produce over 500 kg assimilable protein per month and provide feed for pigs, ducks, chickens and cattle. The manure from such livestock can be returned with benefit to crop land. Azolla can also be grown as fishfood: Tilapia mossambica readily consumes Azolla as do some of the grass carps. There is no doubt that a flexible approach to Azolla production and utilization would be needed in most of Africa, the Caribbean and Pacific; the optimal growth conditions found in south-east Asia are very much the exception in these regions, but where opportunities do exist the rewards could be substantial.

40|$|The aims of {{the project}} were twofold. The initial {{objective}} of the study, based on previous results, was to develop an economically viable methodology for immobilizing yeast cells {{for the treatment of}} heavy metal-laden waste water. The non-viable yeast cross-linked by 13 % (w/v) formaldehyde/ 1 N HNO₃ exhibited satisfactory mechanical strength and rigidity in a continuous-flow column operation. No apparent disruption of the biomass after repeated use was observed. The cost of immobilizing 1 kg dry yeast pellets was estimated at less than US$I. Zn uptake capacity of FA-cross-linked pellets, on batch trials, remained similar to that of raw yeast, reflecting that the immobilizing procedure did not hinder its metal removing capacity. In column studies, cation metals were effectively removed by the yeast pellets from aqueous solution at natural pHs, and then recovered completely by washing the pellets in situ with O. 1 M HCl. The recovered metals were concentrated in such small volumes that recycling or precipitation of them was facilitated. The metal uptake capacity of the regenerated biomass remained constant in comparison with cycle 1, indicating that reuse of the yeast would be possible. In the case of Cr⁶⁺, a gradual breakthrough curve of Cr in the column profile was noted, with a simultaneous reduction of Cr⁶⁺ to Cr³⁺. However, Cr⁶⁺ in the effluent can be markedly minimised either by accumulation onto the biomass or reduction to its trivalent form. Desorption of bound Cr⁶⁺ with either alkali or salt could not accomplish the regeneration of the biomass. A combination of reduction and desorption with FA/HNO₃ appeared promising in regeneration of the saturated biomass at 4 °C. The metal sorption capacities of the yeast pellets, on a batch or a fixed-bed system are relatively lower than that of documented sorbents. Apparently more of the yeast pellets would be required for treating a certain volume of waste effluent, than with other sorbents. Therefore Azolla filiculoides was examined as a suitable sorbent for this purpose. This constitutes {{the second part of the}} project. Azolla filiculoides, a naturally-abundant water fern, was screened for its metal sorption and recovering capacities, mechanical stability, flow-permeability and reusability. The <b>azolla</b> <b>biomass</b> appeared to have fulfilled the required mechanical criteria during the repeated sorption-desorption column operations. It is water-insoluble and appears flexible under pressure when rinsed with water. These characters are of crucial importance in a continuous-flow system since a column can be operated at high flow rates without apparent compact of the biomass and pressure loss. Therefore, immobilization of the biomass can be avoided. The sorption isotherm data, obtained from batch removal of Cr⁶⁺, showed that the sorption process was effective, endothermic and highly pH dependent. Considerable amounts of Cr⁶⁺ were accumulated at the optimum pHs of 2 - 2. 5. Column sorption of Cr⁶⁺ at a low flow rate and pH of 2. 5 showed optimum performance with a total Cr uptake of 50. 4 mg/g at 60 % saturation of the biomass. Removal of Cr⁶⁺ from an electroplating effluent using an azolla column was deemed reasonably satisfactory, although the uptake declined slightly. Desorption of bound Cr⁶⁺ with various desorbents was incomplete, which resulted in a low regeneration efficiency of about 50 %. However, removal and recovery of Cr³⁺ using the azolla column was than that of Cr⁶⁺. Desorption of Cr³⁺ from the spent biomass column was accomplished with the recovery of 80 % using O. 5 N H₂SO₄, The regeneration efficiencies for Cr³⁺ removal were up to 90 % and demonstrated that the biomass is reusable. Cation metal uptake capacities of azolla, obtained either from batch or column experiments, are reasonably high in comparison with other sorbents. The uptake of Ni or Zn ions from solution is pH dependent showing the optimum pH of around 6 to 6. 5, under the current experimental conditions. The sorption kinetics for cation metals was rapid with about 80 % of the bound Ni ions being taken up in the first 10 min. The character of rapid binding is extremely important in a column sorption process, especially on a large scale since it favours an optimum uptake of metals at high flow rates. The Ni or Zn uptakes in column sorption were not markedly affected when the flow rates were increased from 80 mllh up to 800 ml/h for the 5 g biomass used. The cation heavy metals removed from waste effluents were recovered in a concentrated solution of small volume. The desorption of bound Ni and Zn ions from the saturated biomass was accomplished with either O. 2 N HCl or H₂SO₄ that resulted in recoveries of more than 95 %. The metals recovered, in the case of Ni and Zn, are identical to that of plating agents ego nickel sulphate or chloride, so that recycling of the metals is possible. An effluent-free, closed loop of Ni or Zn treatment system was proposed, whereby the Ni or Zn ions can be recycled to the plating bath whilst the purified water is fed back to the rinse tanks. Ca and Mg ions, commonly present in the electroplating effluents, appeared to affect sorption of heavy metals by azolla when metal concentrations were relatively low, presumedly through its competitive binding for the shared sites on surfaces of azolla. The data obtained from column sorption of Ni and Zn follows the BDST model well, enabling the application of the model to predicting design parameters for scale-up of the biosorption column system. It is interesting that the values of metal uptake, expressed in molar quantities, obtained on respective single-metal solutions and the multiple metal system, are similar, implying that the mechanisms involved in the sorption of all metal cations are similar and that the binding sites on surfaces of azolla are probably shared by all cation metals. The surface of the biomass provides sites for metal binding estimated in the range of 0. 45 - 0. 57 mmol/g, based on the current experiments. The biomass has a surface area of 429 m²/g and water retention of 14. 3 ml/g. The functional groups on the surface of azolla were partially identified using chemical modification and metal binding comparison. Among the functional groups examined, carboxyl groups, provided by amino acids and polysaccharides, appeared to play an important role in metal cation binding. The infrared spectra of the samples support this conclusion. ...|$|E
