5|$|Clindamycin is <b>an</b> <b>antibiotic</b> {{useful for}} the {{treatment}} of a number of bacterial infections. This includes middle ear infections, bone or joint infections, pelvic inflammatory disease, strep throat, pneumonia, and endocarditis among others. It can be useful against some cases of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). It may also be used for acne and in addition to quinine for malaria. It is available by mouth, intravenously, and as a cream to be applied to the skin or in the vagina.|$|E
5|$|Linezolid is <b>an</b> <b>antibiotic</b> {{used for}} the {{treatment}} of infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria that are resistant to other antibiotics. Linezolid is active against most Gram-positive bacteria that cause disease, including streptococci, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The main uses are infections of the skin and pneumonia although it may be used for a variety of other infections including drug resistant tuberculosis. It is used either by injection into a vein or by mouth. Linezolid {{is a member of the}} oxazolidinone class of medications.|$|E
5|$|A rapid strep test may assist a {{clinician}} {{in deciding}} whether to prescribe <b>an</b> <b>antibiotic</b> to a person with pharyngitis, a common infection of the throat. Viral infections {{are responsible for the}} majority of pharyngitis, but a significant proportion (20% to 40% in children and 5% to 15% in adults) is caused by bacterial infection. The symptoms of viral and bacterial infection may be indistinguishable, but only bacterial pharyngitis can be effectively treated by antibiotics. Since the major cause of bacterial pharyngitis is GAS, the presence of this organism in a person's throat may be seen as a necessary condition for prescribing antibiotics. GAS pharyngitis is a self-limiting infection that will usually resolve within a week without medication. However, antibiotics may reduce the length and severity of the illness and reduce the risk of certain rare but serious complications.|$|E
25|$|Tigecycline is <b>a</b> {{tetracycline}} <b>antibiotic,</b> but is {{also more}} specifically classified as <b>a</b> glycylcycline <b>antibiotic.</b>|$|R
50|$|Antibiotic {{spectrum}} of activity is <b>a</b> component of <b>antibiotic</b> classification. <b>A</b> broad-spectrum <b>antibiotic</b> is active against {{a wide range of}} bacteria, whereas <b>a</b> narrow-spectrum <b>antibiotic</b> is effective against specific families of bacteria. An example of a commonly used broad-spectrum antibiotic is ampicillin. An example of <b>a</b> narrow spectrum <b>antibiotic</b> is Dicloxacillin, which acts on beta-lactamase-producing Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus.|$|R
50|$|Paramesorhizobium deserti is <b>a</b> <b>antibiotic</b> {{resistant}} bacterium {{from the}} genus of Paramesorhizobium {{which has been}} isolated from soil from the Taklimakan Desert in China.|$|R
5|$|Combination therapy—using {{medications}} {{of different}} classes together, {{each with a}} different mechanism of action—has been demonstrated {{to be a more}} efficacious approach to acne treatment than monotherapy. The use of topical benzoyl peroxide and antibiotics together {{has been shown to be}} more effective than antibiotics alone. Similarly, using a topical retinoid with <b>an</b> <b>antibiotic</b> clears acne lesions faster than the use of antibiotics alone. Frequently used combinations include the following: antibiotic and benzoyl peroxide, antibiotic and topical retinoid, or topical retinoid and benzoyl peroxide. The pairing of benzoyl peroxide with a retinoid is preferred over the combination of a topical antibiotic with a retinoid since both regimens are effective but benzoyl peroxide does not lead to antibiotic resistance.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, an Italian {{research}} company, Farmitalia Research Laboratories, {{began an}} organized {{effort to find}} anticancer compounds from soil-based microbes. A soil sample was isolated from the area surrounding the Castel del Monte, a 13th-century castle. A new strain of Streptomyces peucetius, which produced a red pigment, was isolated, and <b>an</b> <b>antibiotic</b> from this bacterium was effective against tumors in mice. Since a group of French researchers discovered the same compound {{at about the same}} time, the two teams named the compound daunorubicin, combining the name Dauni, a pre-Roman tribe that occupied the area of Italy where the compound was isolated, with the French word for ruby, rubis, describing the color. Clinical trials began in the 1960s, and the drug was successful in treating acute leukemia and lymphoma. However, by 1967, it was recognized that daunorubicin could produce fatal cardiac toxicity.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} impact of the common cold is not well understood in much of the world. In the United States, the common cold leads to 75–100 million physician visits annually at a conservative cost estimate of $7.7 billion per year. Americans spend $2.9 billion on over-the-counter drugs and another $400 million on prescription medicines for symptom relief. More than one-third of people who saw a doctor received <b>an</b> <b>antibiotic</b> prescription, which has implications for antibiotic resistance. An estimated 22–189 million school days are missed annually due to a cold. As a result, parents missed 126 million workdays to stay home to care for their children. When added to the 150 million workdays missed by employees suffering from a cold, the total {{economic impact}} of cold-related work loss exceeds $20 billion per year. This accounts for 40% of time lost from work in the United States.|$|E
50|$|Cefadroxil (formerly trademarked as Duricef) is <b>a</b> broad-spectrum <b>antibiotic</b> of the {{cephalosporin}} type, {{effective in}} Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial infections. It is <b>a</b> bactericidal <b>antibiotic.</b>|$|R
50|$|Pristinamycin IIA is <b>a</b> {{macrolide}} <b>antibiotic.</b> It is <b>a</b> {{member of}} the streptogramin <b>A</b> group of <b>antibiotics</b> and one component of pristinamycin (the other being pristinamycin IA).|$|R

5|$|Drugs {{function}} by binding {{to specific}} locations on target molecules and causing some desired change, such as disabling a target or causing a conformational change. Ideally, a drug should act very specifically, and bind only to its target without interfering with other biological functions. However, {{it is difficult}} to precisely determine where and how tightly two molecules will bind. Due to limits in computing power, current in silico methods usually must trade speed for accuracy; e.g., use rapid protein docking methods instead of computationally costly free energy calculations. Folding@home's computing performance allows researchers to use both methods, and evaluate their efficiency and reliability. Computer-assisted drug design has the potential to expedite and lower the costs of drug discovery. In 2010, Folding@home used MSMs and free energy calculations to predict the native state of the villin protein to within 1.8 angstrom (Å) root mean square deviation (RMSD) from the crystalline structure experimentally determined through X-ray crystallography. This accuracy has implications to future protein structure prediction methods, including for intrinsically unstructured proteins. Scientists have used Folding@home to research drug resistance by studying vancomycin, <b>an</b> <b>antibiotic</b> drug of last resort, and beta-lactamase, a protein that can break down antibiotics like penicillin.|$|E
5|$|On 25 August 1943, Farquharson {{enlisted in}} the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) and was {{assigned}} to No.1 Air Command, based in Trenton, Ontario. He was posted to the United Kingdom in 1944 and briefly returned to No.1 Air Command before being released from service on 22 November 1945 with the rank of wing commander. During the war, he chaired the Penicillin Committee of Canada, which regulated the distribution of penicillin (<b>an</b> <b>antibiotic</b> that largely replaced the sulfonamide used earlier in the war) to the armed forces, and was {{a consultant to the}} RCAF's Director of Medical Services. He was also consulted on medical matters by both the other branches of the Canadian armed forces and by various Allied medical groups. He supervised medical experiments involving penicillin therapy conducted in Ontario hospitals in 194344, and was temporarily appointed Director of Medicine at Christie St. Veteran's Hospital in Toronto. After V-E Day, he travelled to Belgium to supervise the administration of penicillin therapy, and later became involved in the care and treatment of war veterans. For his service in the war, Farquharson was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire in January 1946. His brother Charles also served in both world wars.|$|E
