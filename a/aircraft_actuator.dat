After exhaustive analysis of the cause of limit cycles in the simplified systems and an investigation of possible fixes for this problem, {{it was decided that}} the oscillations were an inherent feature of the control scheme resulting from the servo and actuator lags.

However, for low and medium power applications, brushless DC motors are often the main option due to its recognized advantage such as having no commutator, more efficient, need less maintenance, smaller in size and can operate at higher speeds than conventional motors. The overall objective of this project is to produce an improved prototype BLDC motor with concentrated winding concept for an <b>aircraft</b> <b>actuator</b> application. Specifically, {{the aim is to}} extract the maximum power density and torque per kilograms by utilizing high switching frequencies, high pole numbers and minimizing magnetic material content.

Therefore, this research involved software and hardware methods which are broken down into field and circuit modeling, calculation of basic dimensions, magnetic circuit calculations, stator slot design, winding design, performance and loss calculation and lastly prototyping. Magnet software for finite- element method (FEM) analysis and analysis programs based on standard software are used to optimize the overall performances.

A definitive version was subsequently published in Control Engineering Practice Vol. 31 (2014), DOI: 10. 1016 /j. conengprac. 2013. 09. 014 This paper presents the evaluation process and results associated with two different fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) schemes applied to two different <b>aircraft</b> <b>actuator</b> fault benchmark problems. Although the schemes are different and bespoke for the problem being addressed, both are based on the concept of a second order sliding mode. Furthermore both designs are considered as ‘local’ in the sense that a localized actuator model is used together with local sensor measurements. The schemes do not involve the global aircraft equations of motion, and therefore have low order. The first FDD scheme is associated with the detection of oscillatory failure cases (OFC), while the second scheme is aimed at the detection of actuator jams/runaways. For the OFC benchmark problem, the idea is to estimate the OFC using a mathematical model of the actuator in which the rod speed is estimated using an adaptive second order exact differentiator. For the jam/runaway actuator benchmark problem, a more classical sliding mode observer based FDD scheme is considered in which the fault reconstruction is obtained from the equivalent output error injection signals associated with a second order sliding mode structure. The results presented in this paper summarize the design process from tuning, testing and finally industrial evaluation as part of the ADDSAFE project. EU (FP 7 - 233815...|$|E
40|$|A {{computer}} program calculates an optimal allocation of control effort {{in a system}} that includes redundant control actuators. The program implements an iterative (but otherwise single-stage) algorithm of the quadratic-programming type. In general, in the quadratic-programming problem, one seeks the values of a set of variables that minimize a quadratic cost function, subject to a set of linear equality and inequality constraints. In this program, the cost function combines control effort (typically quantified in terms of energy or fuel consumed) and control residuals (differences between commanded and sensed values of variables to be controlled). In comparison with prior control-allocation software, this program offers approximately equal accuracy but much greater computational efficiency. In addition, this program offers flexibility, robustness to actuation failures, and a capability for selective enforcement of control requirements.

By examining avian anatomy, it is seen that pressure-adaptive structures have been used successfully in the Natural world to hold structural positions for {{extended periods of time}} and yet allow for dynamic shape changes from one flight state to the next. More modern pneumatic actuators, including FAA certified autopilot servoactuators are frequently used by aircraft around the world. Pneumatic artificial muscles (PAM) show good promise as <b>aircraft</b> <b>actuators,</b> but follow the traditional model of load concentration and distribution commonly found in aircraft. A new system is proposed which leaves distributed loads distributed and manipulates structures through a distributed actuator. By using Pressure Adaptive Honeycomb (PAH), it is shown that large structural deformations in excess of 50 % strains can be achieved while maintaining full structural integrity and enabling secondary flight control mechanisms like flaps. The successful implementation of pressure-adaptive honeycomb in the trailing edge of a wing section sparked the motivation for subsequent research into the optimal topology of the pressure adaptive honeycomb within the trailing edge of a morphing flap. As an input for the optimization two known shapes are required: a desired shape in cruise configuration and a desired shape in landing configuration.

The seal edges are generally rounded, ref. [2]. As {{a consequence of the}} presence of filleted edges, the contact pressure exhibits Hertzian-type local bumps in its lateral zones; it remains almost flat in the central zone of the contact. The lateral bumps and the central flattish zone confer to the contact pressure distribution a camel-backed profile, see ref. [2], and ref. [3] for a similar axisymmetric problem. It is difficult to derive a rigorous, analytical expression of the contact pressure curve for the title problem. In fact, the analytical solution available for a rectangular punch with rounded edges indenting a half plane, e. g. ref. [4] and related bibliography, is exact only in the situation of a rigid punch indenting a deformable half plane, ref.
