5|$|On 21 November 1922, the LER {{announced}} <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> <b>for</b> the 1923 parliamentary session. It {{included the}} proposal to extend the line from its southern terminus to the C's station at Kennington where an interchange would be provided. The bill received royal assent as the London Electric Railway Act, 1923 on 2 August 1923.|$|E
5|$|On May 1, 1823, Morehead married Susan A. Roberts; {{the couple}} had two children. He {{was elected to the}} Kentucky House of Representatives {{representing}} Warren County from 1828 to 1831. While there, he served on the Committee on Internal Improvements, and reported <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> <b>for</b> state subscription to the Maysville-Lexington Turnpike Company in 1831.|$|E
5|$|The Fort Vancouver Centennial Corporation {{hoped to}} sell {{commemorative}} half dollars at the planned celebration, and persuaded Representative Albert Johnson of Washington state to introduce {{legislation in the}} House of Representatives. In May 1924, he and Senator Wesley Jones, also of Washington state, introduced legislation in their houses of Congress for a half dollar commemorating the centennial of Fort Vancouver. The bills were not given any hearings. Indiana Representative Albert Vestal, {{the chairman of the}} House Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures, met with Johnson and persuaded him to introduce <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> <b>for</b> a medal instead. Vestal reasoned that the Treasury Department was opposing more commemorative coin issues, as these were finding their way into circulation and confusing the public. On February 3, 1925, Jones introduced <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> <b>for</b> a medal, and on the 12th, Johnson did the same.|$|E

5|$|The {{bill was}} {{deposited}} in Parliament, but no {{progress was made}} in the 1898 session and it disappeared afterwards, although the BS presented {{a modified version of the}} Euston branch in <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> <b>for</b> the 1899 session.|$|E
5|$|A furious Holiday Inn {{management}} {{presented the}} groups with <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> <b>for</b> $24,000, which was reportedly settled by Herman's Hermits tour manager Edd McCann. Townshend {{claimed that the}} Who were banned for life {{from all of the}} hotel's properties, but Fletcher wrote that they stayed at a Holiday Inn in Rochester, New York a week later. He also disputed a widely held belief that Moon drove a Lincoln Continental into the hotel's swimming pool, as claimed by the drummer in a 1972 Rolling Stone interview.|$|E
5|$|At some {{stage in}} that summer the formal copying of the symphony began. On 4 September 1933 Paul Voigt, Sibelius's long-time copyist, sent <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> <b>for</b> making a fair {{copy of the}} first movement—23 pages of music. Sibelius {{informed}} him—the note survives—that the complete manuscript would be about eight times {{as long as this}} excerpt, indicating that the symphony might be on a larger scale than any of its seven predecessors. Aino Sibelius later recalled other visits to Voigt that autumn at which Sibelius, whose mood she described as gloomy and taciturn, delivered further piles of music manuscript to the copyist.|$|E

5|$|In 2000, the APLS website {{estimated}} $25,000 for {{the initial}} engineering study and $150,000-200,000 to complete the restoration. In 2001, Connecticut State Senator Catherine Cook introduced <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> <b>for</b> $150,000 in bonds to fund {{the restoration of the}} Avery Point Light; it was later approved. An article in the New London Day also noted an engineering study valued at $40,000 was being conducted for no cost by James Nordon's engineering firm of Gibble, Norden and Champion.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Jackson {{supported}} the Ho-Chunk tribe's {{proposal for a}} casino within his district in Lynwood, Illinois. The proposal was to build the largest casino in the state {{as part of an}} entertainment complex. In 2005, Jackson sponsored <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> <b>for</b> the creation and acquisition of a life-size statue of Rosa Parks to be placed in Statuary Hall at the United States Capitol. The bill approving the funding for the statue was signed by President Bush on December 1, 2005. Jackson was active in funding AIDS service organizations that serve blacks through Congress.|$|E
5|$|In {{the weeks}} after his death, a legal battle arose over Banks' estate and the {{disposition}} of his body. His estranged widow Elizabeth {{said that he had}} amended his will in October without her knowledge. The new will left all of Banks' assets to his longtime caregiver, Regina Rice. Banks had been diagnosed with dementia shortly before the change in his will. A Chicago funeral home sent Elizabeth <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> <b>for</b> $35,000 in funeral costs, but the bill went unpaid as Elizabeth challenged the legality of Banks' new will. In March 2015, the Chicago Cubs announced that they would pay the funeral home costs.|$|E

5|$|Labor's leader, Don Dunstan, also {{introduced}} <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> <b>for</b> {{reform of the}} Legislative Council, which sought to remove its wage and property based qualifications and instil adult suffrage. Hall himself stated he would approve the bill if it included a clause guaranteeing that the Legislative Council could only be abolished through a referendum. Dunstan agreed, but Hall's own party split on the issue. The bill passed the House of Assembly with Labor support, but failed in the Legislative Council where the LCL's rural conservatives dominated its restricted electoral base.|$|E
5|$|Other {{items of}} pocket litter placed on Martin {{included}} {{a book of}} stamps, a silver cross and a St. Christopher's medallion, cigarettes, matches, a pencil stub, keys and a receipt from Gieves for a new shirt. To provide a date that Martin had been in London, ticket stubs from a London theatre and <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> <b>for</b> four nights' lodging at the Naval and Military Club were added. Along with the other items placed on him, an itinerary of his activity in London could be constructed from 18 to 24 April.|$|E
5|$|Political parties {{gather in}} the National Assembly, which {{consists}} of 240 deputies elected to four-year terms by direct popular vote. The National Assembly {{has the power to}} enact laws, approve the budget, schedule presidential elections, select and dismiss the Prime Minister and other ministers, declare war, deploy troops abroad, and ratify international treaties and agreements. The president serves as the head of state and commander-in-chief of the armed forces, and has the authority to return <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> <b>for</b> further debate, although the parliament can override the presidential veto by a simple majority vote of all members of parliament.|$|E

5|$|Through 1935, as {{the breakup}} {{legislation}} wound through Congress, and litigation through the courts, Willkie was the industry's chief spokesman and lobbyist. When the Senate narrowly passed <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> <b>for</b> the breakup, Willkie {{made a series}} of speeches asking the public to oppose the legislation, and a storm of letters to congressmen followed. After the House of Representatives defeated the breakup clause, investigation proved that many of these communications were funded by the electric companies, signed with names taken from the telephone book, though Willkie was not implicated. Amid public anger, Roosevelt pressured Congress to pass a bill requiring the breakup to take place within three years.|$|E
5|$|Wilberforce {{had planned}} to {{introduce}} a motion giving notice that he would bring forward <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> <b>for</b> the Abolition of the Slave Trade during the 1789 parliamentary session. However, in January 1788, he was taken ill with a probable stress-related condition, now thought to be ulcerative colitis. It was several months before {{he was able to}} resume work, and he spent time convalescing at Bath and Cambridge. His regular bouts of gastrointestinal illnesses precipitated the use of moderate quantities of opium, which proved effective in alleviating his condition, and which he continued to use {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|Even {{with the}} Republican victory in November 1866, Johnson {{considered}} {{himself in a}} strong position. The Fourteenth Amendment had been ratified by none of the Southern or border states except Tennessee, and had been rejected in Kentucky, Delaware, and Maryland. As the amendment required ratification by three-quarters of the states {{to become part of}} the Constitution, he believed the deadlock would be broken in his favor, leading to his election in 1868. Once it reconvened in December 1866, an energized Congress began passing legislation, often over a presidential veto; this included the District of Columbia voting bill. Congress admitted Nebraska to the Union over a veto, and the Republicans gained two senators and a state that promptly ratified the amendment. Johnson's veto of <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> <b>for</b> statehood for Colorado Territory was sustained; enough senators agreed that a district with a population of 30,000 was not yet worthy of statehood to win the day.|$|E

5|$|In February 1974, President Nixon {{proposed}} {{more comprehensive}} health insurance reform—an employer mandate to offer {{private health insurance}} if employees volunteered to pay 25 percent of premiums, replacement of Medicaid by state-run health insurance plans available to all with income-based premiums and cost sharing, and replacement of Medicare with a new federal program that eliminated the limit on hospital days, added income-based out-of-pocket limits, and added outpatient prescription drug coverage. In April 1974, Kennedy and Mills introduced <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> <b>for</b> near-universal national health insurance with benefits identical to the expanded Nixon plan—but with mandatory participation by employers and employees through payroll taxes—both plans were criticized by labor, consumer, and senior citizen organizations because of their substantial cost sharing. In August 1974, after Nixon's resignation and President Ford's call for health insurance reform, Mills tried to advance a compromise based on Nixon's plan—but with mandatory participation by employers and employees through premiums to private health insurance companies—but gave up when unable to get more than a 13–12 majority of his committee to support his compromise plan.|$|E
5|$|In November 1899, the BS {{announced}} <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> <b>for</b> the 1900 session. Again, {{an extension}} was proposed from Marylebone to Paddington, this time terminating {{to the east}} of the mainline station at the junction of Bishop's Road (now Bishop's Bridge Road) and Gloucester Terrace. A station was planned under Bishop's Road, linked to the mainline station by a subway under Eastbourne Terrace. From Waterloo, an extension was planned to run under Westminster Bridge Road and St George's Road to terminate at Elephant and Castle. The BS would connect there with the C's station as the NC planned two years earlier. A spur was to be provided to a depot and power station that were to be constructed {{on the site of the}} School for the Indigent Blind south of St George's Circus.|$|E
5|$|In late 1902, the PC plans {{collapsed}} after {{a falling}} {{out between the}} scheme's promoters led to {{a crucial part of}} the planned route coming under the control of a rival, the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL), which withdrew it from parliamentary consideration. With the PC scheme out of the way, the CLR resubmitted its bill in 1903, although consideration was again held up by Parliament's establishment of a Royal Commission on London Traffic tasked to assess the manner in which transport in London should be developed. While the Commission deliberated, any review of bills for new lines and extensions was postponed, so the CLR withdrew the bill. The CLR briefly re-presented the bill for the 1905 parliamentary session but withdrew it again, before making an agreement with the UERL in October 1905 that neither company would submit <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> <b>for</b> an east–west route in 1906. The plan was then dropped as the new trains with driving positions at both ends made it possible for the CLR to reduce the minimum interval between trains to two minutes without building the loop.|$|E
