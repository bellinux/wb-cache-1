5|$|The novel, {{like the}} video game it is based on, begins as the Pillar of Autumn exits slipspace, {{discovering}} an unexpected massive ringworld hidden by a moon in orbit around a gas giant. In the system <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>host</b> <b>of</b> Covenant, who notice the lone ship. A Covenant leader forbids the fleet to fire on the Autumn, for fear of damaging the ring. Instead, they board and capture the ship. Meanwhile, technicians on the Autumn prepare for battle and awaken a single soldier from cryo sleep—a Spartan known as the Master Chief.|$|E
5|$|The lavish {{illumination}} programme is {{far greater}} than any other surviving Insular Gospel book. There are ten surviving full-page illuminations including two evangelist portraits, three pages with the four evangelist symbols, a carpet page, a miniature of the Virgin and Child, a miniature of Christ enthroned, and miniatures of the Arrest of Jesus and the Temptation of Christ. There are thirteen surviving full pages of decorated text including pages {{for the first few}} words of each of the Gospels. Eight of the ten pages of the canon tables have extensive decoration. It is highly probable that there were other pages of miniature and decorated text that are now lost. In addition to these major pages, there <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>host</b> <b>of</b> smaller decorations and decorated initials throughout the text; in fact only two pages have no decoration.|$|E

25|$|The {{types of}} stones, bones, and {{minerals}} {{found at the}} campsites further describe the use of animal hides as tent covering. Butchered and burned animal bones found around the fire pit show which types of animals were hunted and eaten. Stone tools such as hide scrapers and deposits of minerals employed in preparing skins show the routine use of animal hides. In addition, there <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>host</b> <b>of</b> ethnographic parallels, as indigenous cultures throughout the world relied on animal hides as a shelter covering material until {{the onset of the}} modern era.|$|E
25|$|Chronicling the Butlerian Jihad, the Legends of Dune prequel trilogy (2002–2004) by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson {{establishes}} {{that the}} thinking machines <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>host</b> <b>of</b> destructive robots led by Omnius, a sentient computer network. A thousand {{years before the}} Jihad, a group of twenty dissident humans had used thinking machines to enslave the rest of mankind, and then converted themselves into weaponized human-machine hybrids called cymeks. Essentially immortal and unstoppable, they had {{become known as the}} Titans, but after a century had been overthrown themselves by Omnius and made his servants. Mankind suffers under thinking machine oppression for another 900 years, before the murder of young Manion Butler {{at the hands of the}} independent robot Erasmus incites the Butlerian Jihad. The last remaining free humans fight for a century before finally defeating the machines in the Battle of Corrin.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{enriching}} aspects of student life in Río Piedras is the vast number of cultural and social events organized by the University. In addition to the usual academic conferences and lectures, there <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>host</b> <b>of</b> activities to choose from on any given day. Cultural Activities, run by the Dean of Students, is the central agency at Río Piedras that plans and sponsors major events on and off campus. They run a busy schedule with a cultural activity virtually {{every day of the}} week and on many weekends, too. The Serie de Cine al Aire Libre runs every month throughout the school year, presenting classic and contemporary films in the Baldorioty de Castro Plaza in front of the Tower. Admission is always free. Additionally, there are indoor concerts by musical groups such as the Orquesta Filarmónica de Puerto Rico, the Tuna of UPR-Río Piedras, and the voice emsambles of the campus, Coro de la Universidad de Puerto Rico (founded in 1936 by Augusto Rodríguez), and Coralia, the concert choir.|$|E
500|$|The {{repetitive}} visual {{design of}} Cybertron drew criticism from critics. Tom McShea of GameSpot stated that [...] "the {{majority of the}} game entails walking through similar-looking corridors." [...] Giant Bomb's Jeff Gerstmann also cited repetitive visuals, but conceded that [...] "the metallic world of Cybertron doesn't lend itself particularly well {{to a lot of}} environmental variety." [...] 1UP.com's Matt Miller also raised issue with the repetitive visuals, but provided a counterpoint in saying [...] "there <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>host</b> <b>of</b> features in place to save the game from spiraling into mediocrity." [...] John Hamblin of Eurogamer and Tom McShea of GameSpot also pointed out the game's vast lack of ammunition. [...] "Watching Lord Megatron repeatedly suffering the indignity of being shot at by drones while he desperately scours the debris looking for an elusive ammo box [...] is just sad" [...] stated Hamblin. [...] He was further critical of the game's checkpoint system, which often leaves players in difficult situations upon respawning.|$|E

60|$|There is a {{grave and}} learned air about the city, and a {{pleasant}} gloom upon it, {{that would leave}} it, a distinct and separate impression in the mind, among a crowd of cities, though it were not still further marked in the traveller's remembrance by the two brick leaning towers (sufficiently unsightly in themselves, it must be acknowledged), inclining cross-wise {{as if they were}} bowing stiffly to each other--a most extraordinary termination to the perspective of some of the narrow streets. The colleges, and churches too, and palaces: and above all the academy of Fine Arts, where there <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>host</b> <b>of</b> interesting pictures, especially by GUIDO, DOMENICHINO, and LUDOVICO CARACCI: give it a place of its own in the memory. Even though these were not, and there were nothing else to remember it by, the great Meridian on the pavement of the church of San Petronio, where the sunbeams mark the time among the kneeling people, would give it a fanciful and pleasant interest.|$|E
60|$|The {{stores in}} the commissariat-yard here {{continue}} to increase, thanks to the amount brought up by the native cattle. At present there is, I understand, about a month’s consumption for the troops here and in advance. The arrangements of the commissariat-yard are very good; as, indeed, most of the arrangements of that department have been throughout the expedition. At times this yard presents a most interesting spectacle. Here are large piles of rice- and flour-bags, and beside them the Parsees weighing out the rations to the numerous applicants. A little farther on is the butcher’s shop, where the meat-rations are cut up and distributed. Here is a large enclosure fenced round with bushes, and containing cattle purchased for the troops from the natives. Here are some hundreds of mules unloading stores which they have brought from below. Farther on are more being loaded with grass, to go down for the sustenance of the animals in the pass. Here, again, are hundreds {{of women and children}} laden with grass, which an officer of the commissariat is weighing and paying for; giving, however, the money to the men; who, the instant the women have brought in the grass, send them off, and exert themselves so far as to receive the money. Near these is the wood-yard, where a similar scene is being enacted. Back again by the store-yard <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>host</b> <b>of</b> native cattle, which are waiting to receive stores to take forward to Attegrat. The contract price for this is a dollar and a half per head; and I am glad to say that we can obtain as many cattle as we like for the purpose. Here we have men; the only employment, indeed, which the Abyssinian men will undertake is driving cattle, or rather following them, for they never attempt in any way to guide or influence their movements, but dawdle after them with their eternal spears and shields, knowing well that the sagacious little cattle will always follow the beaten track. Close by is a space marked off for a market. Here we have groups of men squatted about everywhere among their cattle, sheep, and goats: there are a good many donkeys too, and a few mules. For these latter they have raised the price very greatly during the last month: then a good mule could be bought for fifteen dollars, now they charge thirty-five and forty. They are very independent too, and refuse to abate a single dollar in the price they ask: if they do not obtain the exact sum they demand, they will, after a certain time, mount and ride off to their villages, to return again next day with the price probably enhanced two or three dollars over that demanded on the first occasion.|$|E
