5|$|Cockroaches can {{be trapped}} in a deep, smooth-walled jar baited with food inside, placed so that {{cockroaches}} can reach the opening, for example with a ramp of card or twigs on the outside. An inch or so of water or stale beer (by itself a cockroach <b>attractant)</b> in the jar {{can be used to}} drown any insects thus captured. The method works well with the American cockroach, but less so with the German cockroach.|$|E
5|$|In {{an unusual}} case, planidium larvae of some beetles {{of the genus}} Meloe form a group and produce a {{pheromone}} that mimics the sex <b>attractant</b> of its host bee species. When a male bee arrives and attempts to mate with the mass of larvae, they climb onto his abdomen. From there, they transfer to a female bee, {{and from there to}} the bee nest to parasitize the bee larvae.|$|E
5|$|Poisoned bait is {{a common}} method for {{controlling}} rats, mice, birds, slugs, snails, ants, cockroaches and other pests. The basic granules, or other formulation, contains a food <b>attractant</b> for the target species and a suitable poison. For ants, a slow-acting toxin is needed so that the workers have time to carry the substance back to the colony, and for flies, a quick-acting substance to prevent further egg-laying and nuisance. Baits for slugs and snails often contain the molluscide metaldehyde, dangerous to children and household pets.|$|E
40|$|The risk of {{introduction}} of new insect pest species is growing {{with the increase in}} passenger travel and the trade in plant products worldwide. Though effective detection methods exist in a number of cases, only some of them are applied in practice through organized networks. This paper reviews the detection tools available for insect pests, based on commonly available <b>attractants</b> and trapping systems. Chemical <b>attractants</b> are divided into powerful <b>attractants</b> (such as pheromones and para-pheromones), <b>attractants</b> of lower intensity (such as kairomones and food <b>attractants),</b> and their combinations. Physical <b>attractants</b> are also considered, such as visual cues, which are generally used in combination with olfactory <b>attractants,</b> and light traps. Finally, the diversity of trapping systems is also presented in relation to <b>attractants,</b> trap design and target species. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|During {{bacterial}} chemotaxis, <b>attractants</b> and repellents {{alter the}} methylation {{levels of the}} methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs). These methylation levels represent a balance between two enzymatic processes: methylation and demethylation. In vivo experiments previously have shown that chemoeffectors influence the demethylation process; effects on the methylation system have not been reported. Here we show that in a cell-free extract of Escherichia coli both methylation and demethylation of the MCPs are affected by <b>attractants</b> and repellents. <b>Attractants</b> enhance methylation and inhibit demethylation. Repellents inhibit methylation and stimulate demethylation. The cell-free system {{provides an opportunity for}} further study of the mechanisms by which <b>attractants</b> and repellents influence the levels of methylation of the MCPs...|$|R
40|$|The {{identification}} of sex <b>attractants</b> was undertaken for potential {{use in the}} study of two biological control agents against Rubus spp. in Hawaii. <b>Attractants</b> for Croesia zimmermani(Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) and Schreckensteinia festaliella (Lepidoptera: Heliodinidae) were developed by field screening a variety of putative lures in sticky traps, based on <b>attractants</b> for congeneric species. Croesia zimmermani was most attracted to E 11 -tetradecen- 1 -ol and E 11 -tetradecenal, while S. festaliella was attracted to (10, 12) -(E,E) -hexadecadienal alone. Development of monitoring systems based on sex <b>attractants</b> can enable better evaluation of biocontrol programmes, and provide cost-effective information on presence/absence, density, phenology, synchrony with the host, dispersal rate and other useful parameter...|$|R
5|$|Unpaired males find a {{suitable}} cavity {{and begin to}} build nests {{in order to attract}} single females, often decorating the nest with ornaments such as flowers and fresh green material, which the female later disassembles upon accepting him as a mate. The amount of green material is not important, as long as some is present, but the presence of herbs in the decorative material appears to be significant in attracting a mate. The scent of plants such as yarrow acts as an olfactory <b>attractant</b> to females.|$|E
5|$|Fireflies use {{light to}} attract mates. Two systems are {{involved}} according to species; in one, females emit light from their abdomens to attract males; in the other, flying males emit signals {{to which the}} sometimes sedentary females respond. Click beetles emit an orange light from the abdomen when flying and a green light from the thorax when they are disturbed or moving about on the ground. The former is probably a sexual <b>attractant</b> but the latter may be defensive. Larvae of the click beetle Pyrophorus nyctophanus live in the surface layers of termite mounds in Brazil. They light up the mounds by emitting a bright greenish glow which attracts the flying insects on which they feed.|$|E
5|$|Pollination is {{the process}} by which pollen is {{transferred}} in the reproduction of plants, thereby enabling fertilisation and sexual reproduction. Most flowering plants require an animal to do the transportation. While other animals are included as pollinators, the majority of pollination is done by insects. Because insects usually receive benefit for the pollination in the form of energy rich nectar it is a grand example of mutualism. The various flower traits (and combinations thereof) that differentially attract one type of pollinator or another are known as pollination syndromes. These arose through complex plant-animal adaptations. Pollinators find flowers through bright colorations, including ultraviolet, and <b>attractant</b> pheromones. The study of pollination by insects is known as anthecology.|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} {{peptides}} were evaluated as chemoattractants for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Several strains recognized tri-, tetra-, penta-, and hexapeptides in a capillary tube assay. Tripeptides altered at the carboxyl terminus were good <b>attractants,</b> whereas tripeptides altered at the amino terminus {{did not serve}} as chemoattractants. Methionine-containing peptides were relatively poor <b>attractants.</b> Arginine-containing peptides gave the best responses. Reduced responses to larger peptides suggest that porin penetration is required. No extracellular peptidase activity was detected. We conclude that oligopeptides are good <b>attractants</b> and that specificity for chemotactic recognition of oligopeptides exists...|$|R
40|$|A {{group of}} {{methylated}} proteins, the methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCP), {{has been shown}} to {{play a central role in}} bacterial chemotaxis. Both methylation and demethylation of MCP occur continuously in the absence of added stimuli; these two processes are in balance such that a basal level of methylation is maintained. <b>Attractants</b> cause the methylation level to increase to a new value, whereas repellents bring about a decrease in level. Therefore, <b>attractants</b> and repellents must somehow perturb the balance between methylation and demethylation of MCP. In this report the effect of <b>attractants</b> on demethylation of MCP was monitored in two ways: (i) by following the disappearance of [methyl- 3 H]MCP and (ii) by measuring formation of [3 H]methanol, the product of MCP demethylation. Both methods showed that addition of <b>attractants</b> causes a transient inhibition of MCP demethylation. Repellent addition has previously been shown to stimulate MCP demethylation. It is therefore concluded that control of demethylation plays a crucial role in changing the level of methylation of MCP in response to <b>attractants</b> and repellents...|$|R
5|$|Figs have {{complicated}} inflorescences called syconia. Flowers {{are entirely}} contained within an enclosed structure. Their only {{connection with the}} outside is through a small pore called ostiole. Monoecious figs like F. aurea have {{both male and female}} flowers within the syconium. Female flowers mature first. Once mature, they produce a volatile chemical <b>attractant.</b> Female wasps squeeze their way through the ostiole into the interior of the syconium. Inside the syconium, they pollinate the flowers, lay their eggs in some of them, and die. The eggs hatch and the larvae parasitise the flowers in which they were laid. After four to seven weeks (in F. aurea), adult wasps emerge. Males emerge first, mate with the females, and cut exit holes through the walls of the fig. The male flowers mature around {{the same time as the}} female wasps emerge. The newly emerged female wasps actively pack their bodies with pollen from the male flowers before leaving through the exit holes the males have cut and fly off to find a syconium in which to lay their eggs. Over the next one to five days, figs ripen. The ripe figs are eaten by various mammals and birds which disperse the seeds.|$|E

25|$|An unusual {{feature of}} {{valerian}} is that valerian root and leaves are a cat <b>attractant</b> similar to, and as safe as, catnip. Valerian contains the cat <b>attractant</b> actinidine.

Anecdotal reports claim that valerian is also attractive to rats—so much so {{that it had been}} used to bait traps. Stories describe the Pied Piper of Hamelin using both his pipes and valerian to attract rats. Research also shows that valerian root is the strongest chemoattractant of slime molds such as Physarum polycephalum.|$|E

25|$|Female calling {{syndrome}} {{occurs when}} female social insects emit a typical {{call to the}} males {{in close proximity to}} their natal nests. Males that are attracted by the callings fly extensively in pursuit of potential mates. Their gasters raise and stings start to protrude.

Upon collection of the maggot mass, only one insect, Chrysomya megacephala, was discovered. He concluded that the water barrier accounted for the scarcity of other flies.

25|$|Growth cone receptors {{detect the}} {{presence}} of axon guidance molecules such as Netrin, Slit, Ephrins, and Semaphorins. It has more recently been shown that cell fate determinants such as Wnt or Shh can also act as guidance cues. Quite interestingly, the same guidance cue can act as an <b>attractant</b> or a repellent, depending on context. A prime {{example of this is}} Netrin-1, which signals attraction through the DCC receptor and repulsion through the Unc-5 receptor. Furthermore, it has been discovered that these same molecules are involved in guiding vessel growth. Axon guidance directs the initial wiring of the nervous system and is also important in axonal regeneration following an injury.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} possibilities of simulat-ing {{behavior of the}} group of trematode larvaе (miracidiae and cercariae) by the abstract slime mould based computer that is programmed by <b>attractants</b> and repellents. For describing this simulation, we appeal to the language which is a kind of π-cal-culus called Physarum spatial logic. This language contains la-bels for <b>attractants</b> and repellents. Taking into account the fact that the behavior of miracidiae and cercariae can be pro-grammed only by <b>attractants</b> (repellents for miracidiae and cercariae are not known still), we can claim that the behavior of miracidiae and cercariae is a restricted (poorer) form of Physarum spatial logic...|$|R

25|$|Male M. flavitarsis have larger sixth, seventh, {{and eighth}} sternal glands than other wasps, {{suggesting}} {{a role in}} secretion and possible sexual <b>attractant.</b> Secretion is suggested because the wasps will often rub their abdomens along the nest, spreading a highly repellant substance to deter ants. The use of secretion is also used by males when trying to attract a female because they will rub their abdomen along the perimeter of their perching territory. Near the openings of the glands are sternal brushes, which assist in rubbing the secreted substance along the surface. Sternal brushes occur only in the M. flavitarsis of the Mischocyttarus genus.|$|E
25|$|Wetlands {{are another}} major <b>attractant</b> of {{wildlife}} {{in the airport}} environment. They are of particular concern because they attract waterfowl which have a high potential to damage aircraft (Federal Aviation Administration 2013). With large areas of impervious surfaces, airports must employ methods to collect runoff and reduce its flow velocity. These best management practices often involve temporarily ponding runoff. Short of redesigning existing runoff control systems to include non-accessible water such as subsurface flow wetlands (DeVault et al. 2013), frequent drawdowns and covering of exposed water with floating covers and wire grids should be employed (International Civil Aviation Organization 1991). The implementation of covers and wire grids must not hinder emergency services.|$|E
25|$|These can {{contribute}} to control of blowflies and tsetse-flies for example. The blowfly traps contain a liquid that smells like the rotting flesh of a carcass {{and the structure of}} the trap is designed to prevent the flies from escaping once attracted in. Horse-flies can be controlled by traps that attract the flies to a suspended black ball that mimics a potential host; flies attracted become trapped in a cone above. For area wide control of tsetse-flies targets (these do not trap the flies) that combine a rectangle of dark blue or black cloth and often an <b>attractant</b> chemical act as simple mimics of the fly's host. When the flies land on the cloth they contact the synthetic pyrethroid that is impregnated into the cloth.|$|E

25|$|Vespula squamosa, the {{southern}} yellowjacket, {{is a social}} wasp. This species can be identified by its distinctive black and yellow patterning and orange queen. These yellowjackets are typically found in the eastern United States, and its territory extends {{as far south as}} eastern Mexico and Guatemala. Within these territories, they create enormous, multiple-comb nests. The colonies may be either annual or perennial depending on the climate, and in many perennial nests, polygyny takes place. In addition, this species uses pheromones both as a sexual <b>attractant</b> and an alarm signal. This species feeds on insects and animal carcasses; it does not produce honey. V. squamosa, a social insect, has developed a parasitic relationship with the species V. vidua and V. maculifrons. Due to their painful, venomous stings, the species is considered a pest.|$|E
