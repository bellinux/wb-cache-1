5|$|Culturally {{inappropriate}} decision making: The Organisation is {{not designed}} to deal with cultural issues or complex social problems; the normal Indigenous decision-making processes and protocols such as consultation and input from family groupings are not structurally <b>accommodated.</b>|$|E

While 4 million paid {{passengers}} and 8.4 million inter-terminal passengers were originally supposed {{to ride the}} system yearly, the system <b>accommodated</b> 6.4 million paid passengers and 10 million inter-terminal passengers in 2014.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} {{the second half of}} the 18th century there was little or no new constructions taking place in Tvrđa, and even {{maintenance}} of the fort became a burden. In 1809 Osijek was granted free royal town status. Osijek's council was <b>accommodated</b> in a building at the south-eastern corner of Tvrđa's main square.|$|E

40|$|It {{is shown}} {{that for the}} Unit Price Bin Packing problem, Worst-Fit has a {{strictly}} better competitive ratio than First-Fit. With respect to this problem, First-Fit has previously been proven {{to have a better}} <b>accommodating</b> ratio than Worst-Fit. This shows that the <b>accommodating</b> ratio can give different results from the competitive ratio when trying to distinguish between two algorithms, demonstrating the usefulness of the <b>accommodating</b> ratio and <b>accommodating</b> function...|$|R
5|$|Away {{fans are}} {{normally}} <b>accommodated</b> {{in the corner}} of the ground between the Broomloan and Govan Stands. For bigger games, such as the Old Firm derbies, the whole of the Broomloan Stand can be used by the away support. Ibrox is seen as being an intimidating ground for visiting supporters. Rangers banned Celtic fans in 1994 from attending games at Ibrox, citing the damage caused to the Broomloan Stand by the visitors in previous derbies. The ban was lifted after one game, as the Scottish Football League passed a resolution preventing clubs from taking that action. Before the corners were filled in, away fans were <b>accommodated</b> in the lower tier of the Broomloan Stand. Rangers had to take action in 1996 to prevent their fans in the upper deck from throwing items at visitors.|$|E
5|$|Bradman rotated {{the three}} openers {{in the tour}} matches, but Morris and Barnes were {{preferred}} in the Tests. Bradman <b>accommodated</b> Brown in his first-choice team by playing him out of position in the middle order in the Tests. However, Brown appeared uncomfortable in the unfamiliar role, and was dropped after making 73 runs at a batting average of 24.33 {{in the first two}} Tests.|$|E
5|$|Conscientious objectors (COs) {{refuse to}} {{participate}} in military service because of belief or religious training. During wartime, this stance conflicts with conscription efforts. Those willing to accept non-combatant roles, such as medical personnel, are <b>accommodated.</b> There are few legal options for draftees who cannot cooperate with the military in any way.|$|E
50|$|The airport has {{a single}} 2,100 x 45 meter runway, which can <b>accommodate</b> four {{takeoffs}} and landings an hour.

5|$|Cornwall House, now the Franklin-Wilkins Building, {{constructed}} between 1912 and 1915 {{was originally}} the His Majesty's Stationery Office (responsible for Crown copyright and National Archives), but was requisitioned {{for use as}} a military hospital in 1915 during World War I. It became the King George Military Hospital, and <b>accommodated</b> about 1,800 patients on 63 wards.|$|E
5|$|No {{preparations}} {{had been}} made for their reception, accommodation had not been set aside and no food had been prepared. The children were placed {{in different parts of}} the camp based on their condition. The healthy and stronger children were housed in the barracks, weaker and sick children were <b>accommodated</b> in the castle, and the very weak and those suffering from typhus were lodged in the monastery. Only Serb children were kept in the camp, and they came from all over the NDH. They had previously been kept at the camps at Stara Gradiška, Jasenovac, Jablanac, Cerovljani, Mlaka, Gornja Reka and areas of Slavonia. Those <b>accommodated</b> in the barracks had no electricity or running water, and food initially consisted of little more than cornflour.|$|E
5|$|Pall Mall was the {{location}} of the War Office from 1855 to 1906, with which it became synonymous (just as Whitehall refers to the administrative centre of the UK government). The War Office was <b>accommodated</b> in a complex of buildings based on the ducal mansion, Cumberland House. The office subsequently moved to Whitehall.|$|E
50|$|Intermediate {{terminating}} {{facilities for}} trains are provided at Victoria Park (normally {{used only for}} trains being stabled there), Heidelberg (used {{by a handful of}} peak services), Macleod, and Greensborough. Stabling facilities are provided at Victoria Park (<b>accommodating</b> two six-car trains), Macleod (<b>accommodating</b> three six-car trains), Eltham (<b>accommodating</b> five six car trains), and Hurstbridge (<b>accommodating</b> five six-car trains). The stabling siding at Victoria Park is only used between peaks during the day because it does not have security lighting.|$|R

5|$|Reviewers {{recommended}} {{the book for}} public educators as {{an important contribution to}} liberal theory. Their common criticism was based around practical applications and the imposition of autonomy as a value, e.g., her contemporary examples of national civics education, how citizens who disagreed with the focus on autonomy could be <b>accommodated,</b> and how a weak perfectionist state could defend marginalized group interests in a public school setting.|$|E
5|$|The House chamber on {{the first}} floor is rather simple and {{featured}} mahogany desks and leather chairs. The room eventually <b>accommodated</b> 106 representatives from 16 states: the 13 original states as well as the representatives from the new states of Vermont in 1791, Kentucky in 1792, and Tennessee in 1796. The room has been restored to its original appearance in 1796.|$|E
5|$|The Palmyrenes were pagans and worshiped {{a number}} of Semitic gods, with Bel {{at the head of}} their pantheon. Zenobia <b>accommodated</b> Christians and Jews, and ancient sources made many claims about the queen's beliefs; Manichaeist sources alleged that Zenobia was one of their own. It is more likely, however, that Zenobia tolerated all cults in an effort to attract support from groups marginalized by Rome.|$|E

5|$|The Residential Zone {{specifically}} <b>accommodated</b> {{athletes and}} team officials, with 1,168 apartments in 34 residential towers. Each apartment had {{two to five}} bedrooms, giving 4,008 bedrooms in total; each bedroom <b>accommodated</b> two residents which differed from the traditional practice of providing athletes with a bedroom each. The entire zone itself was divided into four zones, styled after four unique folk art styles found in India as identified by a colour and an image: warli (red), gond (blue), madhubani (green) and sanjhi (purple). Nine Resident Centres, each serving hundreds of residents, were spaced across the residential towers, and they provided key services and facilities as well as entertainment. The Residential Zone also housed offices and services centres for the Commonwealth Games Associations, a polyclinic, religious services and casual dining facilities.|$|E
5|$|The artist Moses Griffiths, {{a native}} of Bryncroes in the Llŷn Peninsula, {{provided}} illustrations to most of Pennant's books. He was employed full-time by Pennant and <b>accommodated</b> at Downing. Many of these paintings {{are included in the}} Pennant Collection held by the National Museum of Wales. Another artist whom Pennant employed on an occasional basis was John Ingleby of Halkin. He mostly supplied town scenes and vignettes.|$|E
5|$|The caste {{structure}} of the majority Sinhalese has also <b>accommodated</b> Hindu immigrants from South India since the 13th century CE. This {{led to the emergence}} of three new Sinhalese caste groups: the Salagama, the Durava and the Karava. The Hindu migration and assimilation continued until the 18th century CE.|$|E
5000|$|If an ace {{is drawn}} by {{a player who}} has no cards that are very {{difficult}} to <b>accommodate,</b> it is strategic to place it under the card that is most easy to <b>accommodate</b> (such as a face card), although this may seem counter-intuitive. When an opponent draws a card that is difficult to <b>accommodate,</b> they will likely use it to replace the easiest card to <b>accommodate,</b> and having an ace under that card will make it remain a valid coop.|$|R
