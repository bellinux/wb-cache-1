25|$|Muons are {{unstable}} elementary {{particles and}} are heavier than electrons and neutrinos but lighter {{than all other}} matter particles. They decay via the weak interaction. Because leptonic family numbers are conserved {{in the absence of}} an extremely unlikely immediate neutrino oscillation, one of the product neutrinos of muon decay must be a muon-type neutrino and the other an electron-type antineutrino (<b>antimuon</b> decay produces the corresponding antiparticles, as detailed below). Because charge must be conserved, one of the products of muon decay is always an electron of the same charge as the muon (a positron if it is a positive muon). Thus all muons decay to at least an electron, and two neutrinos. Sometimes, besides these necessary products, additional other particles that have no net charge and spin of zero (e.g., a pair of photons, or an electron-positron pair), are produced.|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} a mass model {{based on a}} SO(10) GUT with a global U(1) family {{symmetry}} is discussed which leads to an asymmetric Nearest Neighbour Interaction structure for the fermionic mass matrices. As {{a result of the}} analysis one gets three solutions of the model which include several large left- and right-handed fermion mixings. Those mixings are not observable in the SM where only the CKM quark mixing matrix can be measured, but they have testable effects on the branching ratios of nucleon decays in theories beyond the SM. One finds that decay channels with positrons in the final state are suppressed while channels with <b>antimuons</b> and antineutrinos are enhanced compared to models with small mixings. The total nucleon lifetimes obtained should be observable by future experiments. The SO(10) model also predicts the masses and mixings of the light neutrinos. They are in the right range to explain the anomalies of solar and atmospheric neutrinos by means of oscillations, preferring the small angle MSW solution for the solar neutrino deficit.

50|$|Consider a toy {{model in}} which an undiscovered boson S may couple both to the {{electron}} {{as well as the}} tau via the termSince the electron and the tau have equal charges, the electric charge of S clearly must vanish to respect the conservation of electric charge. A Feynman diagram with S as the intermediate particle is able to convert a tau into an electron (plus some neutral decay products of the S). The MEG experiment at the Paul Scherrer Institute near Zurich will search for a similar process, in which an <b>antimuon</b> decays to a photon and an antielectron. In the Standard Model, such a process proceeds only by emission and re-absorption of a charged W boson, which changes the tau into a neutrino and then an electron, emitting a photon to conserve energy and momentum.|$|E

50|$|Pair {{production}} {{is the creation}} of an elementary particle and its antiparticle from a neutral boson. Examples include creating an electron and a positron, a muon and an <b>antimuon,</b> or a proton and an antiproton. Pair production often refers specifically to a photon creating an electron-positron pair near a nucleus. In order for pair production to occur, the incoming energy of the interaction must be above a threshold in order to create the pair at least the total rest mass energy of the two particles and that the situation allows both energy and momentum to be conserved. However, all other conserved quantum numbers (angular momentum, electric charge, lepton number) of the produced particles must sum to zero thus the created particles shall have opposite values of each other. For instance, if one particle has electric charge of +1 the other must have electric charge of &minus;1, or if one particle has strangeness of +1 then another one must have strangeness of &minus;1.|$|E
