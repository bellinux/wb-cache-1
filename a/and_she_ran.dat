25|$|Phoenix {{continued}} off Elba, and on 31 August {{was observed}} alone anchored off Piombino, causing French General François Watrin {{to order the}} two French frigates anchored at Leghorn the Succès and Bravoure, to put to sea to attempt to capture her. The French ships did so, but {{early in the morning}} of 2 September they came across the 38-gun HMS Minerve under Captain George Cockburn, and chased her. Cockburn fled, signalling to Phoenix, which quickly got underway, accompanied by Pomone. Realising the situation the two French frigates attempted to flee, now pursued by their former quarry, Minerve. The Succès was unable to keep up with Bravoure, and ran aground off Vada. Minerve fired a shot at her as she passed by in pursuit of Bravoure, at which Succès promptly surrendered. Pomone ranged alongside to take possession of her, while Phoenix and Minerve chased Bravoure. The changing wind prevented the French vessel from regaining the safety of Leghorn, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>ran</b> aground four miles south of the port. She was soon dismasted and wrecked. The British were able to get Succès off without much damage however. She had previously been , and had been captured on 13 February 1801 by a French squadron under Honoré Ganteaume.

500|$|As {{a result}} of her many trips to North America, Pankhurst became fond of Canada, stating in an {{interview}} that [...] "there seems to be more equality between men and women [...] than in any other country I know." [...] In 1922 she applied for Canadian [...] "permission to land" [...] (a prerequisite to status as a [...] "British Subject with Canadian Domicile") and rented a house in Toronto, where she moved with her four adopted children. She became active with the Canadian National Council for Combating Venereal Diseases (CNCCVD), which worked against the sexual double-standard which Pankhurst considered particularly harmful to women. During a tour of Bathurst, the mayor showed her a new building which would become the Home for Fallen Women. Pankhurst replied: [...] "Ah! Where is your Home for Fallen Men?" [...] Before long, however, she grew tired of long Canadian winters, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>ran</b> out of money. She returned to England in late 1925.|$|E

[...] Soap Opera Digest later confirmed the character's name to be Genevieve Atkinson. Co-head writer of The Young and the Restless, Scott Hamner, stated that the role {{was going to be a}} [...] "very, very different character than we've seen Genie Francis portray".

500|$|By midnight, the Baley {{company had}} fallen behind the Rose company {{and decided to}} stop and make a {{mountain}} camp while Rose and others continued to the Colorado River, where they planned to water their combined stock and build a raft {{in preparation for the}} impending river crossing. By noon on August 28, Rose had reached a patch of Cottonwood trees about one mile from the river, where their oxen were unhitched and allowed to join the loose stock racing towards the water. There the emigrants encountered more Mohave, but unlike the friendly ones that greeted them at Sitgreaves Pass, these were rude and hostile. After a thorough watering, the work oxen were returned to the wagons. Rose and his wife, Amanda, decided to scout the river bank for a suitable campsite, exiting their wagon to make the journey by foot. Moments later, an aggressive Mohave placed his hand on her shoulder and bosom, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>ran</b> back, terrified, to the relative safety of their wagon. Rose, not wanting to incite the Mohave, ignored the incident and continued to the river. Other Mohave harassed Alpha Brown's family, briefly threatening to take his wife's dress and abduct their son. That danger was averted, but many Mohave set about driving off and slaughtering several of the party's cattle before leaving the emigrants alone at their encampment, some two hundred yards from the river and [...] away from the Baley company's mountain camp.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, the Portland {{was set to}} {{participate}} in the first steamboat race on the Columbia River in more than half a century, recreating the 1952 race.

[...] Without power or steering, she drifted towards the Bonneville Dam until another tug secured a line and towed her to safety. A Coast Guard investigation cited a problem with an improperly repaired gear in the steering system dating back to 1997. Portland and Columbia Gorge have since raced at least three times, with the Portland winning two of the races.|$|E
2500|$|Armed with {{detailed}} knowledge of Law 5.098, which specified numerous requisites {{for the right}} to vote while remaining moot on a woman's right to do so, Lanteri persuaded the precinct chair to accept her vote in the July 16, 1911, elections for the Deliberative Council, thus becoming the first woman to vote in South America; women were not granted the right to vote in Argentina nationwide until 1947. [...] Electoral Law was amended that year to require military service (something required of all male Argentine citizens) in order to vote, again eliminating women. Lanteri instead joined her lawyer, Angelica Barreda, in forming a political party, the National Feminist Union, in 1918, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>ran</b> for a seat in the Argentine Chamber of Deputies in every election thereafter until the 1930 military coup.|$|E

2500|$|Using {{the voice}} tube {{from the bridge}} to main control, Senn ordered full power on the port engine and stopped the starboard. The crew tried to steer the ship with her engines and keep her in the channel and, when this failed, to keep {{her away from the}} edge of the channel. Their efforts were fruitless; the ship lost headway due to engine failure, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>ran</b> aground on the soft mud bottom. In its {{investigation}} of the grounding, the court of inquiry found that [...] "inaccurate and misleading navigational data" [...] had been supplied to the ship; the chart legend indicated greater channel width than actually existed, and Senn and the navigator were exonerated. After she was repaired, West Virginia became the battle-fleet flagship on 30 October 1924. The ship won the American Defense Society's American Defense Cup and the Spokane Cup, presented by the city's Chamber of Commerce in recognition of her excellence in short-range firing, in addition to Battle Efficiency Pennants in 1925, 1927, 1932 and 1935.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the second}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), in chapter [...] Jacob {{came to an}} eastern land where he saw a well with a great stone rolled upon it and three flocks of sheep lying by it.

Jacob asked if Laban was well, and they said that he was, and that his {{daughter}} Rachel was coming with his sheep. Jacob told the men to water and feed the sheep, but they replied that they could not do so until all the flocks had arrived. When Jacob saw Rachel arrive with her father's sheep, he rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered Laban's sheep. Jacob kissed Rachel, wept, and told her that he was her kinsman, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>ran</b> and told her father. When Laban heard of Jacob's arrival, he ran to meet him, embraced and kissed him, and brought him to his house. Jacob told Laban all that had happened, and Laban welcomed Jacob as family.
