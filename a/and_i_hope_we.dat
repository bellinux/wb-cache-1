A week later, Briggs was joined by his wife and baby daughter.

500|$|This episode {{received}} positive reviews. Christine Orlando from TV Fanatic {{said of the}} episode: [...] "Buried Secrets" [...] left me {{wondering if}} there was even more to Megan's father's death than a simple suicide. There must be a story there <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>we</b> get to hear more of it. [...] It {{would be nice to}} see Megan get her answers, no matter what they may be". Orlando called Joan [...] "a real piece of work" [...] saying that she could not understand why Joan would not allow Megan to exhume her father's body. She added that Joan was [...] "cold" [...] saying this adding, [...] "I suddenly understood why Megan avoids Mom like the plague". Of the conversation between Samantha and Ethan Gross (Geoffrey Arend) she said, [...] "Ethan's story about losing his guinea pig as a child was sad and sweet. In his own strange way he was trying to relate to Samantha and the death of her friend. Plus, it painted a heart-breaking picture of a sad, lonely boy". She added that the death of the episode [...] "caused a ripple effect, touching everyone who came near it", including Kate, who she said that she admired Megan for exhuming the body, as [...] "she's not allowed to flaunt [...] the rules the way Megan is prone to do.|$|E
500|$|Johnson's move to Austin Aztex was {{finalised}} in March {{and completed}} their initial starting side, which included fellow English players Alex Tapp and Gifton Noel-Williams and Welshman Gareth Evans. Upon Johnson's transfer, team manager Adrian Heath said: [...] "I think it's {{fair to say}} that Eddie has lost his way recently <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>we</b> can get him back on the right path to where he is again one of the bright young players in English football." [...] Johnson played in the club's first game, which was a 2–0 friendly defeat to Major League Soccer's New England Revolution and scored in another pre-season match. Johnson scored his first goal for Austin on 25 April against fellow expansion side the Cleveland City Stars when he scored in the 13th minute of play. Johnson scored his second goal in the final minute of the match. In the 2009 season, Johnson played 22 league matches, scoring five goals making him the Aztex leading goalscorer, but he was forced to miss part of the season because of work permit problems after he returned to England with Evans. Johnson also played in two of the Aztex's three US Open Cup matches, playing in the first round, scoring the second goal in a 2–0 win over Mississippi Brilla and in Austin's 2–0 defeat to Houston Dynamo in the third round. The Austin Chronicle named Johnson the city's best player. The newspaper's citation said: [...] "he's been out there hustling every game and providing leadership and a steadying influence on and off the field. At 24, with a background that includes Manchester United and English national youth teams, he might not be with us much longer, but it's a treat while it lasts." [...] He went on to win one of the club's player of the season awards.|$|E

2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Let It Be version of the song, Lennon can be heard jokingly saying [...] "Sweet Loretta Fart (often misheard as [...] "fat", due to Lennon's pronunciation), she thought she was a cleaner, but she was a frying pan." [...] The album version of the song also ends with him famously quipping [...] "I'd like to say thank you on behalf of the group and ourselves, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>we</b> passed the audition". (Originally he said {{that at the end of}} the rooftop concert, but Phil Spector edited it into the [...] "Get Back" [...] song on the Let It Be album.) ...|$|E
2500|$|On March 28, 1975, Goldwater {{wrote to}} Shlomo Arnon: [...] "The subject of UFOs has {{interested}} me for some long time.

It is still classified above Top Secret." [...] Goldwater further wrote that there were rumors the evidence would be released, and that he was [...] "just as anxious to see this material as you are, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>we</b> will not have to wait much longer." ...|$|E
2500|$|For {{the final}} {{portion of the}} film, the Beatles and Preston are shown giving an unannounced concert from the studio rooftop. They perform [...] "Get Back," [...] "Don't Let Me Down," [...] "I've Got a Feeling," [...] "One After 909," [...] and [...] "Dig a Pony," [...] intercut with {{reactions}} and comments from surprised Londoners gathering on the streets below. The police eventually {{make their way to}} the roof and try to bring the show to a close, as the show was disrupting businesses' lunch hour nearby. This prompts some ad-libbed lyrical asides from McCartney: during the second performance of 'Get Back,' he sings, [...] "Get back, Loretta... you've been out too long, Loretta... you've been playing on the roofs again... and your mummy doesn't like that... it makes her angry... she's gonna have you arrested! Get back, Loretta!". In response to the applause from the people on the rooftop after the final song, McCartney says, [...] "Thanks Mo!" [...] (to Ringo's wife Maureen) and Lennon quips, [...] "I'd like to say 'thank you' on behalf of the group and ourselves, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>we</b> passed the audition!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Adams {{initially}} {{may have}} met James Dean in December 1950 while jitterbugging for a soft drink commercial filmed at Griffith Park. Adams {{spent three years}} in the Coast Guard between the time this commercial was shot in late 1950 and the start of filming for Rebel Without a Cause in March 1955. Actor Jack Grinnage, who played Moose, recalled, [...] "Off the set, Nick, Dennis (Hopper), and the others would go out together--almost like the gang we portrayed--but Jimmy and Corey Allen... were not a part of that." [...] They became friends during filming. During breaks, Dean and Adams entertained cast and crew with impersonations of Marlon Brando and Elia Kazan (who had directed Dean in East of Eden). A 1955 Warner Brothers press release quoted Dean as saying, [...] "I shall be busy for the rest of 1955, and Nick will be doing film work for the next six months. Come 1956, however, I wouldn't be surprised to find myself with Adams doing a two-a-night nightclub routine--or acting in a comedy by William Shakespeare." [...] When production was wrapped, Dean said in another press release, [...] "I now regard Natalie (Wood), Nick, and Sal (Mineo) as co-workers; I regard them as friends... about the only friends I have in this town. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>we</b> all work together again soon." [...] Following Dean's 1955 death in an automobile accident, Adams overdubbed some of Dean's lines for the film Giant (these are in Jett Rink's speech at the hotel) and dated co-star Natalie Wood. Adams tried to capitalize on Dean's fame through various publicity stunts, including a claim he was being stalked by a crazed female Dean fan, allowing himself to be photographed at Dean's grave in a contemplative pose, holding flowers, and surrounded by mourning, teenaged female fans along with writing articles and doing interviews about Dean for fan magazines. He also claimed to have developed Dean's affection for fast cars, later telling a reporter, [...] "I became a highway delinquent. I was arrested nine times in one year. They put me on probation, but I kept on racing... nowhere." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Come, come, Job," [...] I said seriously, [...] "this is all nonsense, you know. You mustn't {{be silly}} {{enough to go}} getting such ideas into your head. We've lived through some queer things, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> that <b>we</b> may go on doing so." ...|$|R
