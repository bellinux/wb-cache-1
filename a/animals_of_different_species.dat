25|$|Cases of {{traumatic}} insemination between <b>animals</b> <b>of</b> <b>different</b> <b>species</b> will sometimes provoke a possibly lethal immune reaction. A female Cimex lectularius traumatically inseminated {{by a male}} C. hemipterus will swell up {{at the site of}} insemination as the immune system responds to male ejaculates. In the process, the female's lifespan is reduced. In some cases, this immune reaction can be so massive as to be almost immediately fatal. A female Hesperocimex sonorensis will swell up, blacken, and die within 24–48 hours after being traumatically inseminated by a male H. cochimiensis.|$|E

500|$|As {{the wave}} of {{mutilation}} breaks over Europe, the force animating the monsters proves fatal: any contact with their bodies or blood provokes a frenzy of organic growth, so that <b>animals</b> <b>of</b> <b>different</b> <b>species</b> grow into each other and humans are strangled by their own growing organs. The populations remaining in the cities move underground. The ruling technocrats, led by Francis Delvil, begin to devise biological weapons to combat the monsters. Using {{the energy of the}} remaining tourmaline veils, they construct massive towers—the eponymous [...] "Giants"—out of humans, animals, and plants, grotesque assemblages of organic life that, planted on mountains or in the sea, serve as defensive turrets. In a frenzied technological mania, some of the scientists turn themselves into giant monsters and wander around Europe, wreaking havoc and forgetting their original intent. A group of the original Iceland expedition led by Kylin returns to Europe, bearing the memory of the devastation they caused.|$|E
60|$|Strange friendships {{are often}} formed between the lower <b>animals</b> <b>of</b> <b>different</b> <b>species,</b> but less often {{between man and}} the savage felidae, because of the former's {{inherent}} fear of the great cats. And so after all, therefore, the friendship so suddenly developed between the savage lion and the savage man was not inexplicable.|$|E
60|$|The {{constitution}} of many wild animals is so altered by confinement {{that they will}} not breed even with their own females, so that the negative results obtained from crosses are of no value; and the antipathy of wild <b>animals</b> <b>of</b> <b>different</b> <b>species</b> for one another, or even of wild and tame members of the same species, is ordinarily so great, that it is hopeless to look for such unions in Nature. The hermaphrodism of most plants, the difficulty in the way of ensuring the absence of their own, or the proper working of other pollen, are obstacles of no less magnitude in applying the test to them. And in both, animals and plants is superadded the further difficulty, that experiments must be continued over a long time for the purpose of ascertaining the fertility of the mongrel or hybrid progeny, {{as well as of the}} first crosses from which they spring.|$|E

50|$|Hediger {{described}} {{a number of}} standard interaction distances used {{in one form or}} another between animals.

Hediger's biological social distance theories were used as a basis for Edward T. Hall's 1966 anthropological social distance theories.|$|E

5000|$|Throughout {{the long}} history of {{comparative}} psychology, repeated {{attempts have been made to}} enforce a more disciplined approach, in which similar studies are carried out on <b>animals</b> <b>of</b> <b>different</b> <b>species,</b> and the results interpreted in terms of their different phylogenetic or ecological backgrounds. Behavioral ecology in the 1970s gave a more solid base of knowledge against which a true comparative psychology could develop. However, the broader use of the term [...] "comparative psychology" [...] is enshrined in the names of learned societies and academic journals, not to mention in the minds of psychologists of other specialisms, so the label of the field is never likely to disappear completely.|$|E
