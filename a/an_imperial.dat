5|$|In {{the early}} 18th century, Rome's {{challenge}} to the Chinese Rites led to the expulsion of Catholic missionaries from China. In July 1706, the Papal Legate Charles-Thomas Maillard De Tournon angered the Kangxi Emperor, who issued an order that all missionaries, {{in order to obtain}} <b>an</b> <b>imperial</b> permit (piao) to stay in China, would have to declare that they would follow ‘the rules of Matteo Ricci’.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} year, Staurakios led <b>an</b> <b>imperial</b> {{expedition}} against the Slavic communities (Sclaviniae) of Greece. Setting out from Constantinople, the imperial army followed the Thracian coast into Macedonia, and then south into Thessaly, Central Greece and the Peloponnese.

Empress Irene rewarded her loyal minister by allowing him to celebrate a triumph in the Hippodrome of Constantinople in January 784.|$|E
5000|$|<b>As</b> the <b>Imperial</b> Roman Curia {{increased}} {{in number and}} assimilated all political power, the Roman Emperors instituted a casual practice of appointing faithful servants to offices. This had been done elsewhere, e. g. regarding the Prefect of the Praetorian Guard and the Amici Principis. <b>As</b> <b>Imperial</b> administration expanded, however, new offices became necessary and decentralization demanded modifications. The result was {{the institution of the}} rank of [...] "Comes".|$|R

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{enduring}} institutions of Augustus was {{the establishment of the}} Praetorian Guard in 27BC, originally a personal bodyguard unit on the battlefield that evolved into <b>an</b> <b>imperial</b> guard as well as an important political force in Rome.

5|$|Pownall's work {{identified}} him as supportive of American liberty. Although he feared that Britain was losing control of its colonies, he wrote that the Americans were entitled to the same rights of representative government as their fellow subjects in England, Scotland, and Wales. At the same time, he insisted that the military protection that the colonists received from Britain created equally extensive obligations {{to help pay for}} some of the cost. He was also convinced of the need for a strong, central legislature capable of making common policies that would be binding for every member of the British empire, including the fractious provinces in North America. Pownall eventually decided that the only solution lay in creating <b>an</b> <b>imperial</b> parliament with representatives from both Britain and the colonies. Although he was not the only British commentator to embrace the idea of <b>an</b> <b>imperial</b> parliament, most Americans found it anathema, so much so that John Dickinson singled out his centralized plan of legislative reform for particular criticism in his influential Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania (1768).|$|E

5|$|The Corinthian {{order of}} {{architectural}} style originating from ancient Greece was the dominant architectural {{style in the}} age of Augustus and the imperial phase of Rome.
