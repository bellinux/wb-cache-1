5|$|For {{several years}} on the series, a {{defining}} characteristic of Todd's personality was his resistance to close relationships and sexual intimacy, which were due to his mistreatment by others, especially his adoptive father, who may have raped {{him when he was}} fourteen. It was also due to his horrific past misdeeds, including his rape of Marty and dysfunctional aspects of his relationship with Blair. Surviving a near-death experience and being presumed dead in 1995 and, upon his return in 1996, finding Blair having sex with Patrick made Todd bitter; seeing Blair with another man sexually, soon after his presumed death, caused him to shut down emotionally. The writers made Todd's fear of intimacy into a prominent obstacle for his relationship with his second wife, Téa. When she at one point attempts to seduce Todd by stripping down naked {{in front of him and}} pleading with him to make love to her, he rejects her, explaining that he no longer trusts himself to be intimate in that way; he subsequently throws her out, practically naked, into the middle of <b>a</b> <b>snowstorm.</b>|$|E

Bush. The Raleigh-Durham market had the largest TV audience with more than 51%of households tuned into the day's events, a number attributed in part to <b>a</b> <b>snowstorm</b> that kept people inside and {{in part to the}} large African American population in that community.

In addition, schools and workplaces across the country allowed viewing of the inauguration because the event occurred on a weekday.|$|E
