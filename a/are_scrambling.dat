2500|$|The End of the World {{is painted}} over {{the arch of}} the {{entrance}} to the chapel. Signorelli paints frightening scenes as cities collapse in ruins and people flee under darkened skies. On the right side below he shows the Sibyl with her book of prophesies, and King David with raised hand predicting the end of the world. In the left corner below, people <b>are</b> <b>scrambling</b> and lying in diverse positions on the ground, producing an illusion [...] as if falling out of the painting. This successful attempt in foreshortening was striking in its day.|$|E

60|$|Scoutbush is {{standing}} with Trebooze beyond the bar, upon a little lawn set thick with alders. Trebooze is fussing and fidgetting about, wiping his forehead perpetually; telling everybody {{to get out}} of the way, and not to interfere; then catching hold of Scoutbush's button to chatter in his face; then, starting aside to put some part of his dress to rights. His usual lazy drawl is exchanged for foolish excitement. Two or three more gentlemen, tired of Trebooze's absurdities, <b>are</b> <b>scrambling</b> over the rocks above, in search of spraints. Old Tardrew waddles stooping along the line where grass and shingle meet, his bulldog visage bent to his very knees.|$|E

60|$|She vanishes {{into the}} void; and again there is nothing: all {{existence}} seems suspended infinitely. Then, vaguely, {{there is a}} live human voice crying somewhere. One sees, with a shock, a mountain peak showing faintly against a lighter background. The sky has returned from afar; and we suddenly remember where we were. The cry becomes distinct and urgent: it says Automobile, Automobile. The complete reality comes back with a rush: in a moment it is full morning in the Sierra; and the brigands <b>are</b> <b>scrambling</b> {{to their feet and}} making for the road as the goatherd runs down from the hill, warning them of the approach of another motor. Tanner and Mendoza rise amazedly and stare at one another with scattered wits. Straker sits up to yawn for a moment before he gets on his feet, making it a point of honor not to show any undue interest in the excitement of the bandits. Mendoza gives a quick look to see that his followers are attending to the alarm; then exchanges a private word with Tanner.|$|E
6000|$|But what would--or {{at least}} ought to--strike the newcomer's eye with most pleasurable surprise, {{and make him}} realise into what a new world he has been {{suddenly}} translated--even more than the Negroes, and the black vultures sitting on roof-ridges, or stalking about in mid-street--are the flowers which show over the walls {{on each side of}} the street. In that little garden, not thirty feet broad, what treasures there are! A tall palm--whether Palmiste or Oil-palm--has its smooth trunk hung all over with orchids, tied on with wire. [...] Close to it stands a purple Dracaena, such as are put on English dinner-tables in pots: but this one is twenty feet high; and next to it is that strange tree the Clavija, of which the Creoles are justly fond. A single straight stem, fifteen feet high, carries huge oblong-leaves atop, and beneath them, growing out of the stem itself, delicate panicles of little white flowers, fragrant exceedingly. A double blue pea {74} and a purple Bignonia <b>are</b> <b>scrambling</b> over shrubs and walls. And what is this which hangs over into the road, some fifteen feet in height--long, bare, curving sticks, carrying each at its end a flat blaze of scarlet? What but the Poinsettia, paltry scions of which, like the Dracaena, adorn our hothouses and dinner-tables. The street is on fire with it all the way up, now in mid-winter; while at the street end opens out a green park, fringed with noble trees all in full leaf; underneath them more pleasant little suburban villas; and behind all, again, a background of steep wooded mountain a thousand feet in height. That is the Savannah, the public park and race-ground; such as neither London nor Paris can boast.|$|E

50|$|Released April 2010, Ender Wiggin is not {{the only}} genius child to {{influence}} the course of Earth's history. Not even the only one in his family.

This one-shot follow-up to Ender's Game fills in new detail between the pages of the multiple Hugo Award winning Ender Wiggin series by Orson Scott Card.|$|E
50|$|The {{reconnaissance}} squadron {{is completely}} different from the armored cavalry formations {{of the cold war}} with massive armored and BFV units intended to engage massive armored threats. FM's are still being written on the doctrine. Many soldiers <b>are</b> <b>scrambling</b> to understand the new concepts of combined arms and the reconnaissance squadron. The criticisms of the IBCT RSTA include a lack of dismount capability in the mounted troops and an organizational framework that makes a poor compromise between stealth and economy of force, producing elements too heavy to conduct the traditional LRSD mission, but too weak to conduct the traditional cavalry mission.|$|E

Only a few mines have survived the previous battles, but they may be enough to supply the creation of enough Adamas to build the Mech army necessary to rule the world.

Zee radios the Truman for air support; two F/A-18A Hornets take off and head for the fire fight. The rebels kill Slo, Flea, Lake, and Silk. Waters, Red, Zee and Doc are wounded, but direct the fighter pilots on where to attack. Arthur and Dr. Kendricks <b>are</b> <b>scrambling</b> to the Cameroon border gate when they hear the fighter jets approach and bomb the entire rebel force.|$|E
50|$|Many {{institutions}} <b>are</b> <b>scrambling</b> {{to produce}} estimates of Downturn LGD, but often resort to 'mapping' since Downturn data is often lacking. Mapping {{is the process}} of guesstimating losses under a downturn by taking existing LGD and adding a supplement or buffer, which is supposed to represent a potential increase in LGD when Downturn occurs. LGD often decreases for some segments during Downturn since there is a relatively larger increase of defaults that result in higher cure-rates, often the result of temporary credit deterioration that disappears after the Downturn Period is over. Furthermore, LGD values decrease for defaulting financial institutions under economic Downturns because governments and central banks often rescue these institutions in order to maintain financial stability.|$|E
5000|$|Hoping to trap Guilala, the Japanese {{set up an}} {{earthquake}} generator near the fictional [...] "Mt. Showa" [...] to draw Guilala to a magma flow and destroy him with a super missile known as [...] "The Vulture". Guilala arrives to feed, but he swallows the missile whole when it is fired at him. Soon, other countries <b>are</b> <b>scrambling</b> with their own [...] "super" [...] weapons, but each one fails in comedic fashion. In {{the middle of all}} this the Japanese Prime Minister is waylaid by diarrhea and is replaced by Junzaburo Ohizumi, a former Prime Minister and a friend of the US President. He arrives to help in the battle, but seems shifty. Ohizumi even suggests using nuclear weapons, but is stared down by the other leaders. After the Germans' super weapon fails to put him out of action, Guilala dances with the setting sun.|$|E

It is a popular breakfast dish. Majado is also used as a base to prepare tigrillo and bolones. To prepare trigrillo, majado <b>is</b> <b>scrambled</b> with pork rind, egg, cheese, green onions, parsley, and cilantro. To prepare bolones, majado <b>is</b> <b>scrambled</b> with cheese, pork rind, or a mixture of both. The resulting mixture is then shaped into a sphere which is later deep-fried. Both tigrillo and bolones are typically served {{with a cup of}} coffee.|$|R
