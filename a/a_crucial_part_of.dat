5|$|Sakic's first {{successful}} professional tournament was the 1994 World Championships, where Canada won its first {{gold medal in}} the tournament since 1961. Sakic's seven points in eight games were <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the team's success. During the 1996 World Cup of Hockey, he played only a minor role in Canada's second-place finish as he scored one goal and two assists in six games. However, the tournament allowed him to showcase that he was indeed a dominant player who had simply been overlooked.|$|E

Still far fewer in number than most commercial breeds, Herdwicks survive largely due to farming subsidies and {{the aid of the}} British National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the limited}} {{resources}} of many developing nations, funding vitally effects how emergency medicine {{fits into the}} health system. Preventive care is <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> healthcare in developing countries, {{and it may be}} difficult to budget for emergency medicine without cutting into those resources. This is a particular problem for poorer nations such as Zambia, which had a per capita health expenditure of 23 US dollars in 2003. Regardless of the amount of preventive care available, health problems requiring immediate attention will still occur, and emergency medical programs could increase access to care. Kobusingye et al. argue that expanding emergency medicine does not need to be unreasonably expensive, particularly if developing countries focus on low-cost but effective treatments administered by first responders.|$|E

5000|$|Archaeology is a {{practice}} whose history is entrenched in colonialism, and many archaeologists and communities contend that archaeology has never escaped its colonial past. [...] A major goal of many community archaeologists and community archaeology projects is to decolonize archaeology. [...] In decolonizing archaeology, archaeologists {{are trying to}} give communities more control over every stage in the archaeological process. For example, some programs have begun attempting to bring Indigenous leaders together globally to discuss shared methods for decolonization through archaeological collaboration. [...] Community archaeology, the sharing of archaeological knowledge, and the below major issues have been viewed as <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> decolonization.|$|R

5|$|As {{a result}} of the Franco-Syrian War, Turkey annexed the southwestern Anatolian sanjaks (districts) that had been part of Aleppo Vilayet, such as Mar'ash, Gaziantep ('Ayntab), Rumkale (Qal'at Rum), Urfa (al-Ruha). These sanjaks became part of Turkey {{following}} the October 1921 treaty with France. Aleppans opposed the Turkish annexation. The Franco-Turkish treaty allowed for a resumption of commerce between Aleppo and the Alexandretta Sanjak, including Antioch, due to improved security conditions, but commerce between Aleppo and Anatolia largely ceased. Alexandretta was considered by Aleppans to be their port to the Mediterranean Sea and <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> their socio-economic region. It remained part of Syria under French control, but was administered by a semi-autonomous government that was heavily influenced by Turkey. Aleppo's merchants and nationalist politicians feared this autonomy would ultimately lead to its annexation by Turkey and consequently precipitate an economic crisis in Aleppo; Alexnadretta was separated from Syria in 1938 and became part of Turkey in the following year.|$|E
5|$|Ida {{insisted that}} McKinley {{continue}} his increasingly successful career {{in law and}} politics. He attended the state Republican convention that nominated Hayes for a third term as governor in 1875, and campaigned again for his old friend in the election that fall. The next year, McKinley undertook a high-profile case defending a group of coal miners arrested for rioting after a clash with strikebreakers. Lynch, McKinley's opponent in the 1871 election, and his partner, William R. Day, were the opposing counsel, and the mine owners included Mark Hanna, a Cleveland businessman. Taking the case pro bono, he was successful in getting {{all but one of}} the miners acquitted. The case raised McKinley's standing among laborers, <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the Stark County electorate, and also introduced him to Hanna, who would become his strongest backer in years to come.|$|E
5|$|In late 1902, the PC plans {{collapsed}} after {{a falling}} {{out between the}} scheme's promoters led to <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the planned route coming {{under the control of}} a rival, the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL), which withdrew it from parliamentary consideration. With the PC scheme out of the way, the CLR resubmitted its bill in 1903, although consideration was again held up by Parliament's establishment of a Royal Commission on London Traffic tasked to assess the manner in which transport in London should be developed. While the Commission deliberated, any review of bills for new lines and extensions was postponed, so the CLR withdrew the bill. The CLR briefly re-presented the bill for the 1905 parliamentary session but withdrew it again, before making an agreement with the UERL in October 1905 that neither company would submit a bill for an east–west route in 1906. The plan was then dropped as the new trains with driving positions at both ends made it possible for the CLR to reduce the minimum interval between trains to two minutes without building the loop.|$|E

5|$|The book is {{a fictional}} autobiography, {{describing}} the life of Maximilien Aue, a former officer in the SS who, decades later, {{tells the story of}} <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> his life when he was {{an active member of the}} security forces of the Third Reich. Aue begins his narrative as a member of an Einsatzgruppe in 1941, before being sent to the doomed German forces locked in the Battle of Stalingrad, which he survives. After a convalescence period in Berlin, and a visit to occupied France, he is designated for an advisory role for the concentration camps, and visits the extermination camps. He is ultimately present during the 1945 Battle of Berlin, the Nazi regime's last stand. By the end of the story, he flees Germany under a false French identity to start a new life in northern France. Throughout the account, Aue meets several famous Nazis, including Adolf Eichmann, Heinrich Himmler and Adolf Hitler. In the book, Aue accepts responsibility for his actions, but most of the time he feels more like an observer than a direct participant.|$|E
5|$|Soejima's {{first major}} {{work for the}} series was working on side {{characters}} for Persona 2 alongside Kaneko. Kaneko put Soejima {{in charge of the}} series' art direction after Persona 2 as Kaneko did not want to imprint his drawing style on the Persona series, and also wanted Soejima to gain experience. Soejima felt a degree of pressure when he was given his new role, as the series had accumulated a substantial following during Kaneko's tenure. In a later interview, Soejima said that although he respected and admired Kaneko, he never consciously imitated the latter's work, and eventually settled into the role of pleasing the fans of the Persona series, approaching character designs with the idea of creating something new rather than referring back to Kaneko's work. For his character designs, Soejima uses real people he has met or seen, looking at what their appearance says about their personality. If his designs come too close to the people he has seen, he does a rough sketch while keeping the personality of the person in mind. For his work on Persona Q, his first time working with a deformed Chibi style due to its links with the Etrian Odyssey series, Soejima took into account what fans felt about the characters. <b>A</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> his design technique was looking at what made a character stand out, then adjusting those features so they remained recognizable even with the redesign.|$|E
