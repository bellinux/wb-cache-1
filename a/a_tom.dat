25|$|Timbales are tuned {{much higher}} than <b>a</b> <b>tom</b> of the same diameter, and {{normally}} played with very light, thin, non-tapered sticks. They have relatively thin heads and a very different tone than <b>a</b> <b>tom,</b> but are used by some drummers/percussionists to extend the tom range upwards. Alternatively, they can be fitted with tom heads and tuned as shallow concert toms. Attack timbales and mini timbales are reduced-diameter timbales designed for drum kit usage, the smaller diameter allowing for thicker heads providing the same pitch and head tension. They are recognizable in 2010s genres and in more traditional forms of Latin, reggae & numerous world music styles. Gong drums are a rare extension to a drum kit. The single-headed mountable drum appears similar to a bass drum (sizing around 20-24 inches in diameter), but has the same purpose {{as that of a}} floor tom.|$|E
