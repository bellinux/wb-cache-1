5|$|The NCAA {{considers}} all paid fantasy games—including daily fantasy—to {{fall under}} its prohibition of sports wagering by student athletes, punishable by ineligibility {{to participate in}} NCAA-sanctioned athletics for one year. Advertising for daily fantasy services are also forbidden from being broadcast during telecasts of the NCAA's tournaments. In August 2015, the NCAA {{and a group of}} ten conferences jointly campaigned against daily fantasy games featuring college sports, asserting that DFS is inconsistent with the NCAA's policies and values. The SEC had discussions with its broadcast partners in an attempt to discourage the advertising of daily fantasy games during its telecasts, while both Big Ten Network and Pac-12 Network prohibited advertising for daily fantasy games involving college sports. On December 9, 2015, it was reported that ESPN had similarly agreed not to <b>air</b> <b>advertising</b> for daily fantasy services during telecasts of the College Football Playoff. On March 31, 2016, DraftKings and FanDuel jointly agreed to stop offering daily fantasy college sports following the conclusion of the 2016 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament.|$|E

25|$|In October 2005, Burger King {{began to}} sell Halloween masks {{resembling}} The King and Burger King's viral marketing character The Subservient Chicken. There was little promotion on these masks, as Burger King's website had no {{link to the}} bkmasks.com website and no commercials were <b>aired</b> <b>advertising</b> them. Nonetheless, the masks quickly sold out, and some masks were also sold on eBay for hundreds of dollars. In October 2006, the masks were again sold for the Halloween season. Unavailable for some time, the masks are now available again through Burger King's online shop.|$|R

5000|$|As {{part of the}} CRTC's [...] "Let's Talk TV" [...] initiative, DHX Media {{expressed}} concern that the elimination of genre protection for Category A specialty channels would put services licensed as premium services at an unfair disadvantage, especially due to their inability to <b>air</b> <b>advertising.</b> On November 2, 2016, the CRTC approved the implementation of new categories for licensed television services, replacing the separate specialty and pay television categories with a single Discretionary service category using standardized conditions of license, and ruled that current premium services may operate under these deregulated policies effective immediately. As a result, channels that were legally considered premium services, such as Family Channel, may now optionally broadcast advertising. Tedesco commended the CRTC for the decision, stating that it [...] "represents the next logical step in the implementation of the Let's Talk TV decision, when genre protection was eliminated, and it ensures that pay and specialty channels will now be on a level field." ...|$|E

50|$|On June 12, 2014, it was {{reported}} that Margaret Loesch would step down from her role as Hub Network president and CEO by the end of 2014. On September 17, 2014, The Wall Street Journal reported that Discovery Communications was preparing to acquire a controlling stake in Hub Network from Hasbro, and then re-brand it as Discovery Family. Along with Discovery's CFO Andrew Warren, Hasbro staff acknowledged that increasing competition in the children's media landscape - especially by subscription video-on-demand services such as Netflix, had an effect on the overall performance of the network and Hasbro's original content. As it was majority-owned by a competitor, other major toy companies such as Mattel refused to purchase advertising time on Hub Network, affecting its ability to <b>air</b> <b>advertising</b> that targeted its main audience; by 2014, the network had made only $9 million per year. Discovery staff was also unable to display a full commitment to Hub Network's operation, due to factors such as the troubled launch of the Oprah Winfrey Network. Believing that they had overvalued its stake in the venture, Hasbro decided to cede the operation of the network to Discovery so it could focus more on content and its core toy business.|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} an ongoing debate in Norway on how the state-owned, commercial-free broadcaster, NRK, {{influences}} commercial agents in different media markets. Up to this point, {{little research has been}} done on NRK’s impact on the radio market. This thesis examines the competitive effects of NRK’s radio services when focusing on listener welfare. Through a content analysis, a double-coverage analysis and a survey revealing diversion ratios, we establish that NRK competes hard with commercial broadcasters in the hit-radio segment, although less fierce with P 5 Hits and Kiss than what was expected from the general media coverage. We develop a theoretical model to consider the effects on advertising and diversity, and thereby listener welfare, in a market with the commercial-free broadcaster, NRK, present. We find that NRK’s presence would lower the advertising level, and that the commercial stations would differentiate to soften the competition. We further find from the empirical analyses, slight tendencies that NRK may work as a block, forcing the commercial stations to some extent to differentiate {{in order to be able}} to <b>air</b> <b>advertising.</b> The content analysis finds that there is a significantly lower level of advertising in the hit-radio market compared to the somewhat comparable market comprising P 4 and Radio Norge. We explain this by the presence of NRK in the hit-radio market and that advertising quantities are strategic complements...|$|E

5000|$|The policy {{does not}} prevent {{companies}} from owning multiple stations in a market provided that the stations broadcast in different languages. In recent years, this has been interpreted as meaning that a single company may own both an English-language station and one or more multicultural stations with some English-language content, which in itself may be considered a form of [...] "exemption". CBC/Radio-Canada owned-and-operated stations (O&Os) are also often deployed in pairs in major cities on both television and radio, separated only by language. In addition, the policy is not interpreted as preventing a single company from owning both a [...] "commercial" [...] general-interest station and an educational station in the same market, even if the latter <b>airs</b> <b>advertising,</b> as with Access in Alberta.|$|R

50|$|In 2010, the {{television}} licence fee in France (mainland and Corsica) was €121 and in the overseas departments and collectivities it was €78. The licence funds services provided by Radio France, France Télévisions and Radio France Internationale. Metropolitan France receives France 2, France 3, France 5, Arte, France 4 and Gulli, while overseas departments receive Outre-Mer 1ère also and France Ô, {{in addition to the}} metropolitan channels, now available through the expansion of the TNT service. Public broadcasters in France supplement their licence fee income with revenue from advertising, but changes in the law in 2009 designed to stop public television chasing ratings, have stopped public broadcasters from <b>airing</b> <b>advertising</b> after 8pm. Between 1998 and 2004 the proportion of France Télévision's income that came from advertising declined from around 40% to 30%. To keep the cost of collection low, the licence fee in France is collected as part of local taxes.|$|R
