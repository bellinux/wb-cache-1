Teicoplanin, at a concentration of 1 microgram ml- 1, caused rapid lysis of exponential phase cells of Streptococcus faecalis. Bacillus spp. were most sensitive to the antibiotic; effective lysis occurred at 0. 1 microgram teicoplanin ml- 1. The bacteriolytic effect depended on the antibiotic concentration, the growth phase and growth rate of the target organism. Antibiotic added to overnight cultures did not cause lysis.

However, the pores were impermeable for trypsin indicating that no solubilization of liposomes occurred. The pores were permeable for both positively charged trypsin substrate N-benzoyl-l-arginine ethyl ester and negatively charged pH-indicator pyranine. Two lines of evidence were obtained confirming the involvement of the membrane dipole potential in the insertion of polyacrylic acid into lipid bilayer. (i) Addition of phloretin, a molecule which is known to decrease dipole potential of lipid bilayer, reduced the rate of a polyacrylic acid induced leakage of pyranine from liposomes. (ii) Direct measurements of air/lipid monolayer/water interface surface potential using Kelvin probe showed that adsorption of polyacrylic acid at pH 4. 2 induced a decrease in both boundary and dipole potential by 37 and 62 mV for ester lipid dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC). Replacement of DOPC by ether lipid 1, 2 -di-O-oleyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine (DiOOPC) which is known to form monolayers and bilayers with only minor dipole component of membrane potential showed that addition of PAA produced similar response in the boundary potential (by 50 mV) but negligible response in dipole potential of monolayer.

The test organisms are: a fungus, Kutilakesopsis macalpineae and a bacterium,Pseudomonas tolaasii. The effect of pH and temperature on the mycelia growth of P. ostreatus was also investigated. There was a gradual increase in the percentage inhibition from 33. 3 % at 24 h to 75. 0 % at 168 h for K. macalpineae and 37. 5 % at 24 h to 70. 0 at 168 h for P. tolaasii.

40|$|Zinc {{is a vital}} {{micronutrient}} to all {{organisms and}} it is therefore very important to determine the mechanisms that regulate cellular zinc uptake. Previously, we reported on zinc uptake transporters from zebrafish (Danio rerio; DrZIP 1) and Fugu pufferfish (Takifugu rubripes; FrZIP 1) that facilitated cellular zinc uptake of high affinity (Km< 0. 5  μM) in both CHSE 214 [chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) embryonic 214] cells and Xenopus laevis oocytes. To investigate additional biochemical pathways of zinc uptake in fish, we molecularly cloned the second fish member (FrZIP 2) of the SLC 39 subfamily II from Fugu pufferfish gill. Functional characterization suggests that FrZIP 2 stimulated zinc uptake in a temperature-, time-, concentration- and pH-dependent manner when overexpressed in MDCK cells (Madin–Darby canine kidney cells). In comparison with FrZIP 1 and DrZIP 1 (< 0. 5  μM), FrZIP 2 appears to represent a low-affinity zinc uptake transporter (Km= 13. 6  μM) in pufferfish. FrZIP 2 protein was selective for zinc, but it might also transport Cu 2 +, since 20  times excess of Cu 2 + completely abolished its zinc uptake activity. The zinc uptake by FrZIP 2 was stimulated in a <b>slightly</b> <b>acidic</b> <b>medium</b> (pH  5. 5 – 6. 5) and was completely blocked at pH  7. 5 and above, suggesting that an inward H+ gradient might provide a driving force for zinc transport by FrZIP 2. Furthermore, FrZIP 2 -mediated zinc uptake activity was slightly inhibited by 0. 5  mM HCO 3 −, indicating that FrZIP 2 may employ a different mechanism of zinc translocation from the assumed HCO 3 −-coupled zinc transport used by human SLC 39 A 2. The FrZIP 2 gene was expressed in all the tissues studied herein, with especially high levels in the ovary and intestines.

The stoichiometry {{of the reaction}} was H 2 NCH 2 CH 2 SH + HNO 2 22 ̆ 0202 ̆ 019 H 2 NCH 2 CH 2 SNO + H 2 O. On prolonged standing, the nitrosothiol decomposed quantitatively to yield the disulfide, cystamine: 2 H 2 NCH 2 CH 2 SNO 22 ̆ 0202 ̆ 019 H 2 NCH 2 CH 2 S-SCH 2 CH 2 NH 2 + 2 NO. NO 2 and N 2 O 3 are not the primary nitrosating agents, since their precursor (NO) was not detected during the nitrosation process. The reaction is first order in nitrous acid, thus implicating it as the major nitrosating agent in mildly acidic pH conditions. Acid catalyzes nitrosation after nitrous acid has saturated, implicating the protonated nitrous acid species, the nitrosonium cation (NO(+)) as a contributing nitrosating species in highly acidic environments. The acid catalysis at constant nitrous acid concentrations suggests that the nitrosonium cation nitrosates {{at a much higher}} rate than nitrous acid. Bimolecular rate constants for the nitrosation of cysteamine by nitrous acid and by the nitrosonium cation were deduced to be 17. 9 21 1. 5 (mol/L) (- 1) s(- 1) and 6. 7 32 ̆ 014 10 (4) (mol/L) (- 1) s(- 1), respectively. Both Cu(I) and Cu(II) ions were effective catalysts for the formation and decomposition of the cysteamine nitrosothiol. Cu(II) ions could catalyze the nitrosation of cysteamine in neutral conditions, whereas Cu(I) could only catalyze in acidic conditions. Transnitrosation kinetics of CANO with glutathione showed the formation of cystamine and the mixed disulfide with no formation of oxidized glutathione (GSSG). The nitrosation reaction was satisfactorily simulated by a simple reaction scheme involving eight reactions.

The scanning electron microscopic characterization in combination with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry of the composite materials confirmed that the mediators, MnO 2 and Pt, are randomly distributed {{on the surface of}} the MWCNTs, and in both cases represent nearly 5 % (m: m) of the modifiers expressed as Pt and Mn. Cyclic voltammetric (CV) investigations were performed in acetate (pH 4. 50), phosphate (pH 7. 50) and borate (pH 9. 18) buffers to characterize the basic electrochemical behaviors and to select the working potentials suitable for hydrodynamic chronoamperometric (HA) determination of H 2 O 2 under different circumstances. The CV responses showed that in slightly alkaline media all investigated electrodes, i. e., CPEs unmodified and modified with plain MWCNTs and MWCNTs based composites are in principle applicable, but with different efficiency at different potentials, with favorable reduction and acceptable oxidation of H 2 O 2 at the Pt-MWCNT/CPE and predominately oxidation at the MnO 2 -MWCNT/CPE. The reproducibility of the responses with the MnO 2 -MWCNT/CPE is poor, but can be improved by electrochemical conditioning. The latter one performed well in alkaline supporting electrolyte (pH 9. 18), while in the case of the Pt-MWCNT/CPE the signals are much better established in <b>slightly</b> <b>acidic</b> <b>medium</b> (pH 4. 50).

40|$|Background and objective: One of {{the main}} causes of {{bacterial}} resistance to antimicrobials is multidrug resistance induced by the increased efficiency of the efflux pumps. In this study we analyzed how the conditions of assay affect the efflux of indicator substrates ethidium (Et+) and tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP+) in Salmonella enterica ser. Typhimurium cells. Impact of the outer membrane permeability barrier, composition and temperature of the medium on accumulation of the indicator compounds also was analyzed. Materials and methods: The fluorescence of Et+ and Nile Red was measured using 96 -well plates and a plate reader. In parallel to traditional studies of fluorescence we applied a constructed selective electrode to follow the accumulation of Et+ in S. enterica cells. Simultaneously with monitoring of Et+ concentration in the cell incubation medium, electrochemical measurements of TPP+ accumulation were performed. Furthermore, Et+ and TPP+ were used within the same sample as agents competing for the interaction with the efflux pumps. An inhibitor phenylalanyl-arginyl-β-naphtylamide (PAβN) was applied to evaluate the input of RND-family pumps in the total efflux of these indicator compounds. Results: S. enterica cells with the intact outer membrane (OM) bound very low amounts of Et+ or TPP+. Cells with the permeabilized OM accumulate considerably higher amounts of the indicator compounds at pH 8. 0, but only Et+ was considerably accumulated at pH 6. 5. At conditions of electrochemical monitoring accumulation of Et+ by the permeabilized cells at 37  °C was considerably faster than at 23  °C, but at the higher temperature most of the cell-accumulated Et+ was extruded back to the medium. The fluorescence of Et+ in suspension of cells incubated in 400  mmol/L Tris buffer was about twice higher compared to 100  mmol/L one. The inhibitory action of TPP+ on Et+ efflux was evident only in 400  mmol/L Tris although PAβN effectively increased Et+ fluorescence at both buffer concentrations. Conclusions: Results of our experiments indicate that ionic strength of the incubation medium influence the selectivity, the medium temperature and the assay conditions impact the kinetics of efflux. The lower accumulated amount and the weaker fluorescence of Et+ registered in <b>slightly</b> <b>acidic</b> <b>medium</b> indicate that ΔΨ {{plays a role in}} the accumulation of this indicator cation. The bound amount of Et+ to the de-energized or permeabilized cells considerably varies depending on the conditions and methods of de-energization or permeabilization of cells. Tris/EDTA permeabilization of the cells does not inhibit the efflux...|$|R
40|$|Survival of the bivalve Macoma balthica in (near) anoxic {{seawater}} was {{studied in}} a static {{system and a}} flow-through system and compared with emersed exposure to air and NZ In the static system, a decrease in pH and exponential accumulation of sulphide in the incubation medium were observed, indicating excessive growth of (sulphate-reducing) bacteria. These changes in the chemical environment were prevented {{by the use of}} a flow-through system. However, this treatment hardly affected survival time. Median mortality times were 8. 3 and 9. 0 days for the static and flow-through incubation, respectively. Addition of the antibiotic chloramphenicol strongly increased survival time in both systems with corresponding values of 17. 9 and 23. 0 days. A similar value was obtained for survival in air (LT 50 = 21. 7 days). In a second experiment (1 year later), we obtained much lower values for anoxic survival in a static system, although laboratory conditions, season and temperature were similar. The pH values were adjusted to 6. 5, 7. 2 and 8. 2 by buffering the media (25 mM Tris-HCl), and the corresponding LT 50 values were 5. 5, 5. 7 and 4. 7 days, respectively. In the presence of chloramphenicol the values were 10. 8, 10. 9 and 9. 5 days, respectively. These values show that a <b>slightly</b> <b>acidic</b> <b>medium</b> increased survival time. Exposure to an atmosphere of N- 2 resulted in a survival time close to that in anoxic seawater without chloramphenicol (LT 50 = 6. 4 days). Overall the results indicate that proliferation of anaerobic bacteria associated with the bivalves was the main cause of death. Since chloramphenicol also displayed a strong positive effect in the flow-through system, which prevented the accumulation of released waste products and a decrease of pH, bacterial damage must have been by injury of the tissues of the clams and not by the release of noxious compounds to the medium. Bacterial outbreaks are a part of every anoxic event (eutrophication), and therefore, in their habitats, direct bacterial infection may also be the cause of clam mortality. It is concluded that laboratory studies on anoxic tolerance, or impact of sulphide, may produce artefacts when no precautions are taken to suppress bacterial proliferation.

X-ray diffraction analysis established the presence of highly crystalline and thermally stable material. Unit cell dimensions increased with increasing levels of metal substitution. X-ray fluorescence (XRF) bulk analysis showed increasing levels of metals in the material and corresponding decreases in the moles of silica. The maximum levels of substitution achieved were Ni 3. 93 and Cu 4. 38 (in wt %). Analysis by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed a crystal morphology {{similar to that of}} H-ZSM- 5 but with smaller crystals having an increasing aspect ratio in the substituted materials. There was evidence of twinned crystals and the appearance of raised faces in all substituted samples. Thermogravimetric and derivative thermogravimetric analysis showed anomalous losses, which could be explained by Jahn-Teller distortions. Fourier transform infrared analysis of the materials showed an increasing level of distortion in significant regions of the spectra. Analysis of the filtrate, from EDTA-exchanged material, by atomic absorbance spectroscopy (AAS) showed that there were tetrahedrally coordinated M 2 + species in the material and relatively small amounts were removed by ion exchange...|$|R
40|$|Roundleaf {{toothcup}} - Rotala rotundifolia [(Buch-Ham. ex Roxb) Koehne] is {{an important}} aquatic, ornamental and medicinal plant of family Lythraceae. Present {{study was designed to}} propagate adventitious shoots regeneration from leaf explants cultured on MS medium supplemented with 5 levels of 0. 25 - 2. 00 mg/L BA. Maximum shoot regenration frequency (53. 33 percent) and mean number of 17. 06 shoots per explant was reocrded on MS medium supplemented with 1. 0 mg/L BA. Multiple shoots buds were also induced on all culture mediums most of which were either slow to grow or failed to convert in to shoots. Transfer of explants to 0. 20 mg/L GA 3 propmoted the shoot regeneration frequecy to 100 percent on MS medium containing 1. 00 mg/L BA and increased mean number of shoots (24. 0) on MS medium supplemented with 0. 25 mg/L BA- 0. 20 mg/L GA 3. The developing shoots rooted in the shoot elongation medium showed positive effects of BA- 0. 20 mg/L GA 3 combinations. Thereafter, the developing plantlets were acclimatised in water using pH level of 4. 0 - 10 (7 levels). All plants at pH 4. 0 developed necrosis and died; whereas, rest of the plants showed variable grpwth at other pH levels. A comparison among the pH treatments suggested <b>slightly</b> <b>acidic</b> to alkaline <b>medium</b> (pH 6 - 9) was more appropriate for the acclimatisation of in vitro regenerated plants without having negative effects on plant growth and development...|$|R
