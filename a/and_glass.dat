5|$|The Girossi newsstands project, {{which was}} never carried out, was a {{commission}} from the tradesman Enrique Girossi de Sanctis. It would have consisted of 20 newsstands, spread throughout Barcelona. Each would have included a public lavatory, a flower stand <b>and</b> <b>glass</b> panels for advertisements {{as well as}} a clock, a calendar, a barometer and a thermometer. Gaudí conceived a structure with iron pillars and marble <b>and</b> <b>glass</b> slabs, crowned by a large iron <b>and</b> <b>glass</b> roof, with a gas illumination system.|$|E

5|$|A grave found a short {{distance}} away also contained jewellery, including a gold pendant, silver brooch, <b>and</b> <b>glass</b> beads.

5|$|A {{rangefinder}} {{was installed}} on the bridge and her fore and aft holds were refitted as magazines. Half-inch (12.7mm) steel plating was added to protect her steering gear and her interior cabin bulkheads <b>and</b> <b>glass</b> ventilators were removed to reduce damage from splinters. Her furniture was removed {{to make room for}} the mess decks needed to feed large numbers of troops and sailors and an operating room and sickbay were installed amidships.|$|E

5|$|Facilities at {{the station}} are minimal – there is a metal <b>and</b> <b>glass</b> shelter {{on each of the}} two islands {{as well as on the}} bridge. The station is {{completely}} unstaffed, and there are no facilities for buying tickets. There are customer help points, giving next train information for both platforms. There is no car park or taxi rank, nor is there any cycle storage available. There are several bus stops nearby.|$|E

5|$|Manganese {{compounds}} {{have been}} used as pigments and for the coloring of ceramics <b>and</b> <b>glass.</b> The brown color of ceramic is sometimes the result of manganese compounds. In the glass industry, manganese compounds are used for two effects. Manganese(III) reacts with iron(II) to induce a strong green color in glass by forming less-colored iron(III) and slightly pink manganese(II), compensating for the residual color of the iron(III). Larger quantities of manganese are used to produce pink colored glass.|$|E

5|$|Prior Holloway {{surrendered}} Bath Priory to {{the crown}} in January 1539. It was sold to Humphry Colles of Taunton. The church was stripped of lead, iron <b>and</b> <b>glass</b> and left to decay. Colles sold it to Matthew Colthurst of Wardour Castle in 1543. His son Edmund Colthurst gave the roofless remains of the building to the corporation of Bath in 1572. The corporation had difficulty finding private funds for its restoration.|$|E
5|$|So far {{during this}} period, Leeds has seen much development, {{particularly}} in the city centre, most notably the highrise developments such as Bridgewater Place, the developments around Clarence Dock, K2 (albeit a conversion from an older building) {{as well as many}} developments incorporating student accommodation.

40|$|Na K-edge X ray {{absorption}} near-edge structure (XANES) spectra for minerals <b>and</b> <b>glasses</b> {{were collected}} using synchrotron radiation. Na-K XANES {{is a good}} structural probe to determine the coordination state of this element in important minerals <b>and</b> <b>glasses.</b> From the XANES spectra on crystalline reference phases with different chemical environment, information can be obtained and compared with {{the structure of the}} minerals <b>and</b> <b>glasses.</b> The different classes of studied minerals correspond to distinct Na K-edge spectra which have been examined. The XANES spectra for the crystalline references are used as fingerprint to interpret those obtained on silicate <b>and</b> borate <b>glasses.</b> Experimental spectra for jadeite and carnegieite crystals can be satisfactorily reproduced by theoretical calculations using the Full Multiple Scattering formalism...|$|R

5|$|The {{original}} brick-built {{station was}} built in 1879 and in February 1910 the station building was reconstructed. On 1 March 1910 the station was given its present name. In 1931 and 1932 the station was rebuilt again in preparation for transferring the Uxbridge branch service from the District line to the Piccadilly line. The new station was designed by Charles Holden in a modern European geometric style using brick, reinforced concrete <b>and</b> <b>glass.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{replacement}} of the Mk1's metal rotor blades with aluminium <b>and</b> <b>glass</b> fibre composite rotor blades saw these aircraft designated Chinook HC Mk1B.
