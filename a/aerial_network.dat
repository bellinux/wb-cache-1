40|$|Rural {{areas have}} very low revenue potential. The {{major issue in}} {{providing}} low-cost broadband to rural areas is to provide reliable backhaul connections that spread over tens or even hundreds of miles, connecting villages to the nearest service provider. Along with <b>aerial</b> <b>networks</b> of Google and Facebook, {{there has been a}} considerable amount of research toward long-distance terrestrial WiFi links. As a comparison, WiFi routers are easier to be deployed and maintained by non-technical people from the local communities, whereas the <b>aerial</b> <b>networks</b> require professional support to operate. Moreover, they are still in the experimentation phase. However, the long distance WiFi links require high-gain directional antennas and very expensive tall towers for high data rates. On the other hand, multihop paths with stronger links may provide better data rates without the need of tall towers. In this paper, we evaluated the concept of using such multihop WiFi links for long backhaul connections. Our simulation results show that these networks can possibly be a cost-effective and practical solution for rural connectivity. These initial results can serve as a first step to understand the comprehensive feasibility of using multihop WiFi networks for backhaul connections in rural area...|$|R

40|$|The Dutch city of Gorinchem {{has great}} {{economic}} growth {{opportunities for the}} future, but is limited by its transport system. It is strategically located at a crossroad of two motorways and two rivers, the Boven-Merwede and the Linge. Gorinchem {{is home to a}} number of multinationals, among others Damen Shipyards and Van Oord. This sets the right conditions for economic growth. However, the city roads are congested and the limited accessibility of the area by train and car slows this economic growth. Therefore, a solution is required to make Gorinchem more accessible. The development of an <b>aerial</b> <b>network</b> is an approach that could comply with the vision of the city as an innovative regional business centre. This project, called Heliport Gorinchem, aims to provide a final design for an aerial logistic network that can be implemented in Gorinchem in the year 2020. The project consists of three main parts: the project initiation and definition, a conceptual design part, and a detailed design part. This report contains a review of the project initiation and definition, and the conceptual design part. The main focus of this report is on the detailed design part of the project. The aim of the project initiation and definition is to structure the project, come up with a time management plan and organise the group. Also, the requirements and constraints for the project are set. The goal of the project is to design a concept for a sustainable logistic network of multi-purpose aerial vehicles in Gorinchem, competitive with the current transport market, within ten weeks. A market analysis is performed after the project initiation, to identify the traffic problem in Gorinchem on a local and regional scale. Locally, the city has three connection points to the motorways and these points form the entry and exit of the city. The capacity of the roads to these points is too low for the traffic they have to handle. It is estimated that there is an overload of 4000 travellers per hour during rush hours. On a regional level, a connection with a railway to the north and south of the country fails to appear and there is no aerodrome near Gorinchem to have any connection by air. The outcome of the conceptual design part is a concept for an operational <b>aerial</b> <b>network.</b> To come up with ideas for possible concepts for the network, multiple brainstorm sessions are held. A selection procedure is executed {{in order to reduce the}} amount of possible concepts and to come up with a final concept for the detailed design part of the project. From this, a combination of a linear local and a linear regional network is selected. The verification of the conceptual design has led to the conclusion that an <b>aerial</b> <b>network</b> alone will not solve the traffic problem entirely at this moment. However, there is a demand for a better accessibility and economic growth in of the city. Therefore the aim of the project is altered into a new vision. The goal of the <b>aerial</b> <b>network</b> is to serve economic growth of the city. An <b>aerial</b> <b>network</b> will allow Gorinchem to improve its accessibility to important locations, while becoming an important link in the aerial infrastructure of the Netherlands. The aim is therefore to implement an <b>aerial</b> <b>network</b> before 2020. In the short term, up to 2030, the goal is to realise a profitable <b>aerial</b> <b>network.</b> In the years thereafter an expansion of the <b>aerial</b> <b>network</b> will allow for an improvement of the traffic situation in Gorinchem. This is the aim of the long-term vision. The detailed design part elaborates on the design of all aspects of the <b>aerial</b> <b>network</b> in the short term, while keeping its long-term development in mind. The main customers are identified to be business travellers. Other smaller markets are determined as well, like tourism, medical assistance and governmental flights. The aerial vehicle for the short term is selected to be an Eurocopter EC 135 helicopter that makes use of a hybrid engine and noise reducing technology. The helicopter should operate under visual flight rules to limit the investment costs. The aerodrome is designed to be a self-sustaining heliport with a low investment cost of 750, 000 euro for the landing site. For the location, the industrial estate Avelingen at the edge of the suburbs is chosen. It has a direct connection with the motorway and can be linked with the future railway from Breda to Utrecht. Furthermore, it is located at the Boven-Merwede river which has an extra advantage. An approach route for helicopters will minimise the environmental impact regarding noise and safety. A business model for the <b>aerial</b> <b>network</b> has been developed and analysed. Unfortunately, the business model shows that it will not be profitable in the short term to set up a transport service for business travellers. The main reasons for this are the high maintenance costs of the vehicle, call out costs, and airport charges. From the conducted research, it can be concluded that it is possible to realise a heliport in Gorinchem and start its operations in the year 2020. Although the implementation of a profitable <b>aerial</b> <b>network</b> seems currently not feasible, it is reasonable to invest in the construction of a heliport as there is demand for a heliport in Gorinchem. It is advised to develop a heliport that allows companies like Damen Shipyards and Van Oord to use the facilities with their own helicopter. Furthermore, this will be a first and innovative step in the development of a regional <b>aerial</b> <b>network,</b> which provides fast and high quality transport. This can offer Gorinchem the opportunity to take a leading role in aerial transportation on a regional scale in the Netherlands. Furthermore, it will support the economic growth of the city. Further research should focus on the design of a new aerial vehicle. It is recommended that maintenance and fuel cost are reduced for the new aerial vehicle in order to make the <b>aerial</b> <b>network</b> profitable. Other research should focus on the expansion of the <b>aerial</b> <b>network</b> and find alternative locations with low landing charges. In this way, the high landing fees at the airports can be avoided and the possibility to make a profitable <b>aerial</b> <b>network</b> will increase. It is recommended to perform a market analysis on the willingness to pay of the future business travellers and other markets. This will have influence on the income of the business model. In the best case scenario, the design can even become profitable in the short term. Air Transport and OperationsAerospace Engineerin...|$|E

As a result of faster technological advances in electronics and communications, the development of different types of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has become possible.

Recent advances {{in the development of}} small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with built in sensors made it possible to deploy aerial sensor and actor networks. An <b>aerial</b> <b>network</b> composed of small UAVs enables high quality observation for events while reducing the number of personnel and the risk for the operators.

This was not a"greenfield concession"but is probably the only"busway"concession undertaken so far worldwide. With roughly 16, 000 buses fighting their way through heavy traffic under traffic policies geared to automobiles, bus services was slow and unreliable. Then Sao Paulo adopted certain practices aimed at improving bus operations. Between 1983 and 1987, it implemented a segregated trolleybus corridor between Sao Mateus and Jabaquara, to be opened as a private concession regulated {{by the state of}} Sao Paulo. The concession was to operate for 20 years but the winning consortium had to invest in only part of the equipment, because part of it was in place. This made things less risky for the private consortium and allowed thestate to complete an environmentally friendly project {{with the help of the}} private sector. The concession has so far been a success - an example to be followed. After an initial increase, demand for the busway began to fall in 1998 and 1999. This was part of a general decline in demand for the bus system because of: a) A drop in jobs resulting from the economic slowdown. b) A growth in the use of automobiles. c) Competition from illegal buses (vans), which offer door-to-door service. The state was late in completing the <b>aerial</b> <b>network</b> for the trolleyway and rehabilitating sections of the roadway. This delayed replacement of diesel buses by trolleybuses.

40|$|Perhaps future historians {{will only}} {{refer to this}} era as the {{information}} age, and will recognize it as a paramount milestone in mankind progress. One of the main pillars of this age {{is the ability to}} transmit and communicate information effectively and reliably, where wireless radio technology {{became one of the most}} vital enablers for such communication. A growth in radio communication demand is notably accelerating in a never-resting pace, pausing a great challenge not only on service providers but also on researches and innovators to explore out-of-the-box technologies. These challenges are mainly related to providing faster data communication over seamless, reliable and cost efficient wireless network, given the limited availability of physical radio resources, and taking into consideration the environmental impact caused by the increasing energy consumption. Traditional wireless communication is usually deployed in a cellular manner, where fixed base stations coordinate radio resources and play the role of an intermediate data handler. The concept of cellular networks and hotspots is widely adopted as the current stable scheme of wireless communication. However in many situations this fixed infrastructure could be impaired with severe damages caused by natural disasters, or could suffer congestions and traffic blockage. In addition to the fact that in the current networks any mobile-to-mobile data sessions should pass through the serving base station that might cause unnecessary energy consumption. In order to enhance the performance and reliability of future wireless networks and to reduce its environmental footprint, we explore two complementary concepts: the first is node cooperation and the second is <b>aerial</b> <b>networks.</b> With the ability of wireless nodes to cooperate lays two main possible opportunities; one is the ability of the direct delivery of information between the communicating nodes without relaying traffic through the serving base station, thus reducing energy consumption and alleviating traffic congestion. A second opportunity would be that one of the nodes helps a farther one by relaying its traffic towards the base station, thus extending network coverage and reliability. Both schemes can introduce significant energy saving and can enhance the overall availability of wireless networks in case of natural disasters. In addition to node cooperation, a complementary technology to explore is the <b>aerial</b> <b>networks</b> where base stations are airborne on aerial platforms such as airships, UAVs or blimps. <b>Aerial</b> <b>networks</b> can provide a rapidly deployable coverage for remote areas or regions afflicted by natural disasters or even to patch surge traffic demand in public events. Where node cooperation can be implemented to complement both regular terrestrial coverage and to complement <b>aerial</b> <b>networks.</b> In this research, we explore these two complementary technologies, from both an experimental approach and from an analytic approach. From the experimental perspective we shed the light on the radio channel properties that is hosting terrestrial node cooperation and air-to-ground communication, namely we utilize both simulation results and practical measurements to formulate radio propagation models for device-to-device communication and for air-to-ground links. Furthermore we investigate radio spectrum availability for node cooperation in different urban environment, by conductive extensive mobile measurement survey. Within the experimental approach, we also investigate a novel concept of temporary cognitive femtocell network as an applied solution for public safety communication networks during the aftermath of a natural disaster. While from the analytical perspective, we utilize mathematical tools from stochastic geometry to formulate novel analytical methodologies, explaining some of the most important theoretical boundaries of the achievable enhancements in network performance promised by node cooperation. We start by determining the estimated coverage and rate received by mobile users from convectional cellular <b>networks</b> and from <b>aerial</b> platforms. After that we optimize this coverage and rate ensuring that relay nodes and users can fully exploit their coverage efficiently. We continue by analytically quantifying the cellular network performance during massive infrastructure failure, where some nodes play the role of low-power relays forming multi-hop communication links to assist farther nodes outside the reach of the healthy network coverage. In addition, we lay a mathematical framework for estimating the energy saving of a mediating relay assisting a pair of wireless devices, where we derive closed-form expressions for describing the geometrical zone where relaying is energy efficient. Furthermore, we introduce a novel analytic approach in analyzing the energy consumption of aerial-backhauled wireless nodes on ground fields through the assistance of an aerial base station, the novel mathematical framework is based on Mat&# 039;ern hard-core point process. Then we shed the light on the points interacting of these point processes quantifying their main properties. Throughout this thesis we relay on verifying the analytic results and formulas against computer simulations using Monte-Carlo analysis. We also present practical numerical examples to reflect the usefulness of the presented methodologies and results in real life scenarios. Most of the work presented in this dissertation was published in-part or as a whole in highly ranked peer-reviewed journals, conference proceedings, book chapters, or otherwise currently undergoing a review process. These publications are highlighted and identified in the course of this thesis. Finally, we wish the reader to enjoy exploring the journey of this thesis, and hope it will add more understanding to the promising new technologies of <b>aerial</b> <b>networks</b> and node cooperation...|$|R

40|$|This era would {{probably}} be recognized as the information age, hence as a paramount milestone in the progress of mankind, by the future historians. One {{of the most significant}} achievements of this age is, making it possible to transmit and receive information effectively and reliably via wireless radio technology. The demand of wireless communication is increasing in a never-resting pace, imposing bigger challenge not only on service providers but also on innovators and researches to innovate out-of-the-box technologies. These challenges include faster data communication over seamless, reliable and cost effective wireless networks, utilizing the limited physical radio resources as well as considering the environmental impact caused by the increasing energy consumption. The ever-expanding wireless communication infrastructure is withdrawing higher energy than ever, raising the need for finding more efficient systems. The challenge of developing efficient wireless systems can be addressed on several levels, starting from device electronics, up to the network-level architecture and protocols. The anticipated gains of achieving such efficiency is the key feature of extending mobile devices&# 039; battery life and reducing environmental and economic impacts of wireless communication infrastructure. Therefore energy efficient designs are urgently needed from both environmental and economic aspects of wireless networks. In this research, we explore the field of energy efficiency in MAC and Physical layers of wireless networks in order to enhance the performance and reliability of future wireless networks as well as to reduce its environmental footprint. In {{the first part of this}} research, we analyse the energy efficiency of two mostly used modulation techniques, namely MQAM and MFSK, for short range wireless transmissions, up to a few 100 s of meters, and propose optimum rate adaptation to minimize the energy dissipation during transmissions. Energy consumed for transmitting the data over a distance to maintain a prescribed error probability together with the circuit energy have been considered in our work. We provide novel results for optimal rate adaptation for improved energy efficiency. Our results indicate that the energy efficiency can be significantly improved by performing optimal rate adaptation given the radio and channel parameters, and furthermore we identify the maximum distance where optimal rate adaptation can be performed beyond which the optimum rate then becomes the same as the minimum data rate. In the second part of this research, we propose energy efficient algorithm for cellular base stations. In cellular networks, the base stations are the most energy consuming parts, which consume approximately 60 - 80 % of the total energy. Hence control and optimization of energy consumption at base stations should be at the heart of any green radio engineering scheme. Sleep mode implementation in base stations has proven to be a very good approach for the energy efficiency of cellular BSs. Therefore, we have proposed a novel strategy for improving energy efficiency on ternary state transceivers for cellular BSs. We consider transceivers that are capable of switching between sleep, stand-by and active modes whenever required. We have modelled these ternary state transceivers as a three-state Markov model and have presented an algorithm based on Markov model to intelligently switch among the states of the transceivers based on the offered traffic whilst maintaining a prescribed minimum rate per user. We consider a typical macro BS with state changeable transceivers and our results show that it is possible to improve the energy efficiency of the BS by approximately 40 % using the proposed MDP based algorithm. In the third part of this research, we propose energy efficient algorithm for aerial base stations. Recently aerial base stations are investigated to provide wireless coverage to terrestrial radio terminals. The advantages of using aerial platforms in providing wireless coverage are many including larger coverage in remote areas, better line-of-sight conditions etc. Energy is a scarce resource for aerial base stations, hence the wise management of energy is quite beneficial for the <b>aerial</b> <b>network.</b> In this context, we study the means of reducing the total energy consumption by designing and implementing an energy efficient aerial base station. Sleep mode implementation in base stations (BSs) has proven to be a very good approach for improving the energy efficiency; therefore we propose a novel strategy for further improving energy efficiency by considering ternary state transceivers of aerial base stations. Using the three state model we propose a Markovian Decision process (MDP) based algorithm to switch between the states for improving the energy efficiency of the aerial base station. The MDP based approach intelligently switches between the states of the transceivers based on the offered traffic whilst maintaining a prescribed minimum channel rate per user. Our simulation results show that there is a around 40 % gain in the energy efficiency when using our proposed MDP algorithm together with the three-state transceiver model for the base station compared to the always active mode. We have also shown the energy-delay trade-off in order to design an efficient aerial base station. In the final part of our work, we propose a novel energy efficient handover algorithm, based on Markov decision process (MDP) for the two-tier LTE network, towards reducing power transmissions at the mobile terminal side. The proposed policy is LTE backward-compatible, as it can be employed by suitably adapting a prescribed SNR target and standard LTE measurements. Simulation results reveal that compared to the widely adopted policy based on strongest cell and another energy efficient policy, our proposed policy can greatly reduce the power consumption at the LTE mobile terminals. Most of our works presented in this dissertation has been published in conference proceeding and some of them are currently undergoing a review process for journals. These publications will be highlighted and identified at the end of the first chapter of this dissertation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a hierarchical control archi-tecture that enables cooperative surveillance by a heterogeneous <b>aerial</b> robot <b>network</b> comprised of mothership unmanned aircraft and daughtership micro air vehicles. Combining the endurance, range, and processing {{capabilities of the}} motherships with the stealth, flexibility, and maneuverability of swarms of daughter-ships enables robust control of <b>aerial</b> robot <b>networks</b> conducting collaborative operations. The hierarchical control structure de-composes the system into components that {{take advantage of the}} abilities of the different types of vehicles. The motherships act as distributed databases, fusion centers, negotiation agents, and task supervisors while daughtership control is achieved using cooperative vector field tracking. This paper describes the overall arcitecture and then focuses on the assignment and tracking algorithms used once sub-teams of daughtership vehicles have been deployed. A summary of the communication, command, and control structure of a heterogeneous unmanned aircraft system is also given in this paper along with hardware-in-the-loop and software simulation results verifying several components of the distributed control architecture.

40|$|The use of drone base {{stations}} to provide wireless connectivity for ground terminals {{is becoming a}} promising part of future technologies. The design of such <b>aerial</b> <b>networks</b> is however different compared to cellular 2 D networks, as antennas from the drones are looking down, and the channel model becomes height-dependent. In this paper, we study the effect of antenna patterns and height-dependent shadowing. We consider a random network topology to capture the effect of dynamic changes of the flying {{base stations}}. First we characterize the aggregate interference imposed by the co-channel neighboring drones. Then we derive the link coverage probability between a ground user and its associated drone base station. The result is used to obtain the optimum system parameters in terms of drones antenna beamwidth, density and altitude. We also derive the average LoS probability of the associated drone and show {{that it is a}} good approximation and simplification of the coverage probability in low altitudes up to 500 m according to the required signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) ...|$|R

Owing to the dynamism and autoconfiguration of this type of network, a strategy is needed to position its devices (drones) to ensure it can achieve good performance. In light of this, this paper proposes a flight path planning model, which involves a metaheuristic optimization-based approach. The proposal relied on the artificial neural networks to optimize the positioning of the relay device, so that the throughput between the other devices could be increased; the benefits of the proposal were demonstrated through simulations...|$|R
