5000|$|Unlike {{the true}} flight {{dynamics}} of space, those seen in Star Wars closely mirror the familiar dynamics of flying in Earth's atmosphere. For example, fixed-wing aircraft must make banked turns because they use <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> to <b>operate.</b> Yet, in the airless {{vacuum of space}} in Star Wars, the spaceships always (unnecessarily) bank when turning. Physicist Lawrence M. Krauss says this is for a simple reason: [...] "it looks good."By banking, {{the center of gravity}} would be maintained so up is still up but the g forces generated at such speeds would surely injure the occupants. This is handled in the films by devices known as [...] "inertial compensaters".|$|R

This paper presents a statistical performance evaluation of soft seat spring <b>operated</b> <b>pressure</b> relief <b>valves.</b> These pressure relief valves are typically smaller and of lower cost than hard seat (metal to metal) pressure relief valves and can provide substantial cost savings in fluid service applications (air, gas, liquid, and steam) providing that probability of failure on demand (the probability that the pressure relief valve fails to perform its intended safety function during a potentially dangerous over pressurization) {{is at least as}} good as that for hard seat valves. The research in this paper shows that the proportion of soft seat spring <b>operated</b> <b>pressure</b> relief <b>valves</b> failing is the same or less than that of hard seat valves, and that for failed valves, soft seat valves typically have failure ratios of proof test pressure to set pressure less than that of hard seat valves...|$|R

50|$|In I Corps (the northernmost {{military}} district in Vietnam) boats based at Da Nang, Tan My and Cửa Việt had three man crews of various rates and ranks. On U.S. Navy boats, the senior rate was usually a third class petty officer or above, {{and the two}} crewmen could be E-2, E-3 or E-4 ranks (i.e. seaman apprentice, seaman, or petty officer third class). One of the two crewmen was almost always an Engineman, and could be an ENFA, ENFN, or an EN3 in rank. The LCM-8s there all had two sets of the twin 6-71 Detroits paired up to a hydro transmission. Two air compressors, port and starboard of the engine sets, provided <b>air</b> <b>pressure</b> to <b>operate</b> the <b>air</b> cylinders that raised and lowered the bow ramp. The air cylinders were below deck in the eighth void from the bow and stretched cables attached to the ramp to raise it. Lowering the ramp was accomplished by releasing the air and allowing gravity to bring the ramp down.|$|R

The first commercial laptop used in space was a Macintosh portable in 1991 aboard Space Shuttle mission STS-43.

As of 2011, over 100 ThinkPads were aboard the ISS. Laptops used aboard the International Space Station and other spaceflights are generally the same ones that can be purchased by the general public but needed modifications are made to allow them to be used safely and effectively in a weightless environment such as updating the cooling systems to function without relying on hot air rising and accommodation for the lower cabin <b>air</b> <b>pressure.</b> Laptops <b>operating</b> in harsh usage environments and conditions, such as strong vibrations, extreme temperatures, and wet or dusty conditions differ from those used in space in that they are custom designed for the task and do not use commercial off-the-shelf hardware.|$|R

The sensitivity of the PSV pressure response with regard to the structural parameters is investigated by using Sobols method. Finally, simulations and experimental investigations are performed on the optimized prototype and the results reveal that the dynamical characteristics of the valve have been improved in comparison with the original valve...|$|R
40|$|An energy {{management}} system (EMS) {{was designed to}} minimize front and rear collision forces experienced by the occupants of automotive vehicles by at least 50 %. The EMS is a hydraulic damper consisting of a control <b>valve,</b> a <b>pressure</b> <b>operated</b> directional control <b>valve,</b> and a hydraulic cylinder. The system operates entirely upon the forces experienced in the collision and dissipates the energy through a 30 ° rotation of the occupant's seat back. The damper is designed to withstand the maximum collision forces resulting in front collisions at 30 mph and rear collision at 11 mph. The maximum chest load on an occupant in these collisions is approximately 5, 000 lbs. A resulting maximum load of up to 13, 900 lbs is exerted on the damper. The damper is designed to dissipate half of this energy and operate at an average load of 6, 642 lbs and a corresponding pressure of 4, 550 psi. The result of this damper is a 52 % reduction in the force exerted on an occupant's chest in a front collision from 5000 lbs to 2390 lbs. by Jennifer Dawn Navarro. Thesis (S. B.)

The TALIF signal is calibrated using a gas mixture containing Xe. A novel method to perform calibration in situ, at atmospheric pressure, is introduced. The branching ratios of several Xe mixtures are reported, to enable us to perform the Xe calibration without the need for a vacuum vessel. The O densities are measured spatially resolved, and as a function of admixed air to the He, and microwave power. The electron density and temperatures are measured using Thomson scattering, and the N- 2 and O- 2 densities are measured using Raman scattering. O densities are found to have a maximum of (4 - 6) x 10 (22) m(- 3), which indicate that O- 2 is close to fully dissociated in the plasma. This is confirmed by the Raman scattering measurements. O is found to recombine mainly into species other than O- 2 in the afterglow, which is suggested to consist of O- 3 and oxidized components of NO...|$|R
