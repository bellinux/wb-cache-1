50|$|The town {{is famous}} for its bangus (milkfish) <b>aqua-culture,</b> due to the {{existence}} of its numerous fishponds (pokok in the Pangasinan language). However, because of constant siltation {{over the past several years}} from mine tailings upstream from Agno River (due to mine operations in neighboring Benguet Province), and the overuse of artificial fish feeds, the bangus industry has suffered from fishkill, fewer viable fishponds and lower harvests. As a result, many formerly productive fishponds have been converted into large commercial and residential lots. This phenomenon is beginning to seriously threaten the unique Binmaley fishpond industry. Current Government action is inadequate due to strong pressures from other competing commercial interests, not to mention fishfeed producers.|$|E

Here we report {{the construction of a}} first-generation genetic linkage map for S. aurata, based on 204 microsatellite markers. Twenty-six linkage groups (LG) were found. The total map length was 1241. 9 cM. The ratio between sex-xpecific map lengths was 1 : 1 : 2 (male:female). Comparison with a preliminary radiation hybrid (RH) map reveals a good concordance, as all makers located in a single LG are located in a single RH group, except for Ad- 25 and Cld- 31. Comparison with the Tetraodon nigroviridis genome revealed a considerable number of evolutionary conserved regions (ECRs) between the two species.

40|$|Abstract – A within-family marker-assisted {{selection}} scheme {{was designed for}} typical <b>aqua-culture</b> breeding schemes, where most traits are recorded on sibs of the candidates. Here, sibs of candidates were tested for the trait and genotyped to establish genetic marker effects on the trait. BLUP breeding values were calculated, including information of the markers (MAS) or not (NONMAS). These breeding values were identical for all family members in the NONMAS schemes, but differed between family members in the MAS schemes, making within-family se-lection possible. MAS had up to twice the total genetic gain of the corresponding NONMAS scheme. MAS was somewhat less effective when heritability increased from 0. 06 to 0. 12 or when {{the frequency of the}} positive allele was < 0. 5. The relative efficiency of MAS was higher for schemes with more candidates, because of larger fullsib family sizes. MAS was also more efficient when male:female mating ratio changed from 1 : 1 to 1 : 5 or when the QTL explained more of the total genetic variation. Four instead of two markers linked to the QTL increased genetic gain somewhat. There {{was no significant difference in}} polygenic genetic gain between MAS and NONMAS for most schemes.

All families were mixed, and fish were first reared in one site (site B) until 35 g mean weight, then distributed to the four sites. A posteriori reconstruction of pedigree with microsatellites was used. Deformities were scored internally at slaughtering, and externally from photographs.

From the 1980 s to the present, several institutions in developing countries have been engaged in such R&D activity and it is recognized that the collaborative program on Genetic Improvement of Farmed Tilapias (GIFT) has spurred the development of several tilapia and carp breeding programs that now exist in numerous developing countries.

Because of the prominence of water in production (primarily for irrigation) and in domestic use (drinking, washing, cooking), con¯ict over water and the effects of gender-in¯uenced decisions about water may have far-reaching consequences on human well-being, economic growth, and social change. At the same time, social con¯icts and social change are shaped and mediated, often in unexpected ways, by the natural conditions in which water occurs. The social relations of water are poorly understood. This article introduces a framework for disaggregating condi-tions of access to water and uses it to examine three pressing questions in Bangladesh. First, extraction of groundwater for irrigation has made many drinking-water hand pumps run dry. Second, increasing use of groundwater for drinking has been associated with the poisoning of at least 20 million people through naturally occurring arsenic in groundwater. Third, the article examines some of the ways access to water has been changed by the rise of shrimp <b>aqua-culture</b> for export.

40|$|Tilapia culture {{without the}} use of {{fishmeal}} relieves pressures on natural fish stocks nichola van os 1 Tilapia hatcheries, as with most aquaculture ventures, have recently become highly productive and highly profitable. Approximately three mil-lion t of cultured product, worth near-ly US$ 4 billion, were produced in 2008 (FAO 2010). The cultivation of Tila-pia (Oreochromis niloticus and various associated species and hybrids) is be-ing promoted rapidly and adopted by farmers in over 100 countries. One of the main benefits of fish farming, es-pecially in developing countries, is to provide a cheap and abundant source of protein to local populations. In particular, tilapia are widely accepted across most cultural, traditional and religious factions. Farmed fish also provide a substitute to fish caught either by subsistence or commercial fishermen, relieving pressures on natu-ral fish stocks normally generated as a result of overharvesting and poor fish-ery practices. The concern, however, is the utilization of fishmeal (ground dried fish) as a feed source for many species being cultured. This article explores the extent to which tilapia can be farmed without the addition of protein sources to the diet and, alternatively, if plant protein and/or green-water systems can be used as complete substitutes to elimi-nate the reliance on fishmeal. This fur-ther promotes the benefits of tilapia as a more sustainable species for <b>aqua-culture,</b> as well as highlighting the fact that aquaculture has the potential to fully realize its expectations of being an ecologically sound alternative to capture fisheries...|$|E

To steer dependency away from freshwater crops and decrease environmental damage from humanity s fuel and energy demands, it is necessary {{to take advantage of the}} natural adaptive biomass resources that are already in place. Using methods of Green Planet Architecture, based on compilations of current research and procedures, could lead to new forms of energy and fueling as well as new sources for food and feed. Green Planet Architecture involves climatic adaptive biomass; geospatial intelligence; agri- and <b>aqua-culture</b> life cycles; and soil, wetland, and shoreline restoration. Plants such as Salicornia, seashore mallow, castor, mangroves, and perhaps Moringa can be modified (natural, model-assisted, or genetically modified) to thrive in salt-water and brackish water or otherwise not arable conditions, making them potentially new crops that will not displace traditional farming. These fueling sources also have potential to be used in other rapid-growth industries, such as the aviation industry, that have incentive to move towards more sustainable fuel supplies. This paper highlights an example of how synergistic development of biomass resources and geospatial intelligence high-performance computing capabilities can be focused to resolve potential drought-famine problems. These techniques, provide a basis for future e-science-based discovery (and access) through technology that can be expanded to support global societal applications...|$|E
