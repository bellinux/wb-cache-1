50|$|Asphalt BUR {{is made up}} of {{multiple}} layers of reinforcing plies and asphalt forming a redundancy of waterproofing layers. The reflectivity of built up roofs depends on the surfacing material used. Gravel is the most common and they are referred to as asphalt and gravel roofs. Asphalt degradation is a growing concern. UV-rays oxidize the surface of the asphalt and produce a chalk-like residue. As plasticizers leach out of the asphalt, asphalt built-up roofs become brittle. Cracking and <b>alligatoring</b> inevitably follows, allowing water to penetrate the system causing blisters, cracks and leaks. Compared to other systems, installation of asphalt roofs is energy-intensive (hot processes typically use LP gas as the heat source), and contributes to atmospheric air pollution (toxic, and green-house gases are lost from the asphalt during installation).|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} mineral {{stabilizers}} {{on the performance}} and durability of asphalt is a well established phenomenon. If such stabilizers are not added, asphalt exposed to solar radiation combined with other weathering factors, such as temperature and moisture, experiences photo-oxidation, hardening, and surface cracking (<b>alligatoring).</b> Until recently, mineral stabilizers were added on an empirical basis, but there is now available {{a fair amount of}} knowledge based on research carried out in laboratories in industry and government.

50|$|The main {{products}} of <b>alligator</b> hunting are <b>alligator</b> meat and skin. <b>Alligator</b> skins have been harvested since the 1800s. <b>Alligator</b> skin {{was used in}} the manufacture of boots, belts, and saddles. In the early 1900s some states began the commercial tanning of <b>alligator</b> skin. The increased popularity of <b>alligator</b> leather lead to the rise of <b>alligator</b> farming, now a $60 million industry. Following the global economic recession of 2008, demand for wild <b>alligator</b> skins declined dramatically. In the state of Louisiana the number of reported skins dropped from 35,625 to 9,139 in one year.|$|R

Unlike the other extinct <b>alligator</b> species of in the same genus, the fossil skull was {{virtually}} indistinguishable {{from that of the}} modern American <b>alligator.</b> This <b>alligator</b> and the American <b>alligator</b> are now considered to be sister taxa, meaning that the <b>Alligator</b> mississippiensis lineage has existed in North America for over 8 million years.|$|R
5000|$|A common {{symbol of}} Florida {{in popular culture}} is the American <b>alligator</b> (<b>Alligator</b> mississippiensis). <b>Alligators,</b> also known colloquially as [...] "gators,” are part of Florida’s popular culture ranging from tourist attractions and <b>alligator</b> wrestlers to postcards and team mascots {{such as that of}} the University of Florida. The St. Augustine <b>Alligator</b> Farm was one of Florida’s {{earliest}} themed tourist attractions that opened for business in 1893. At the St. Augustine <b>Alligator</b> Farm and other tourist attractions such as Gatorland and the Silver Springs Nature Park, “taming” or hypnotizing <b>alligators</b> was a popular trick, along with other performances such as <b>alligator</b> wrestling.|$|R
30|$|The {{association}} of silica minerals, pyrophyllite, and pyrite is common, occurring as opaque gray-colored or transparent grains. The original texture is completely lost {{and the original}} minerals {{have been replaced by}} silica mineral, pyrophyllite, pyrite, and minor rutile. Some grains comprise anhedral silica crystals and fine-grained matrix of pyrophyllite (Fig.  3 f). The silica mineral grains range from 1 to 100  µm in size. Some silica grains contain abundant micron-sized spherical pores. The matrix pyrophyllite occurs as an aggregate of fine flaky crystal or very fine spongy texture dotted with euhedral pyrite crystals. The very fine matrix contains <b>alligatoring</b> voids. Some pyrophyllite-bearing grains consist solely of very fine-grained pyrophyllite with such voids.|$|E
30|$|The Law Enforcement Assistance Administration (LEAA) {{documented}} many of {{the myths}} about using the visible appearance of damage to identify arson (Boudreau et al. 1977). Arson investigators were surveyed about how they investigate fires and cited interpretation of “burn indicators” as the most common method of establishing arson. Some of these indicators used were <b>alligatoring,</b> crazing of glass, depth of char, lines of demarcation, sagged furniture springs and spalled concrete. The LEAA report, after listing the indicators, identified that these indicators have received little or no scientific testing and that “there {{appears to be no}} published material in the scientific literature to substantiate their validity” (Boudreau et al. 1977). Despite the lack of validity and this caution, the training and textbooks within the profession during this time used these indicators as a means to link an observation to the speed of the fire and ultimately to the conclusion of fire cause.|$|E

40|$|The {{recovery}} of <b>alligators</b> from centuries of exploitation, {{coupled with a}} burgeoning human population in Florida has resulted in {{an increasing number of}} problem animals and <b>alligator</b> attacks. In response to this problem, the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission implemented a nuisance <b>alligator</b> control program in 1978. A mean of 2513 nuisance <b>alligators</b> per year was harvested during the period 1978 to 1988. The number of <b>alligator</b> complaints, nuisance <b>alligators</b> harvested, and <b>alligator</b> attacks increased significantly over the period (P= 0. 0003, P= 0. 0001, and P= 0. 04).

40|$|The {{population}} rebound of the American <b>alligator</b> (<b>Alligator</b> mississippiensis; hereafter, <b>alligator),</b> {{with the}} rapid growth of populations throughout its range, has caused an influx of human–alligator conflicts. We quantified 5, 838 nuisance <b>alligator</b> reports from 2000 to 2011 to develop more site-specific strategies of management and to determine where management should be focused to minimize the conflict. We also surveyed the general public’s attitude toward and knowledge of <b>alligators</b> (n = 98) as a technique to better understand human dimensions of nuisance <b>alligator</b> management in Texas. Counties that received the largest numbers of nuisance <b>alligator</b> reports were Jefferson (16 %), Fort Bend (14 %), Matagorda (11 %), Brazoria (10 %), Harris (7 %), Jackson (5 %), Orange (5 %), Chambers (5 %), Calhoun (5 %), and Liberty (3 %) counties. We found that of the nuisance <b>alligators</b> reported, 45 % were male, 18 % were female, and 38 % were reported as unknown. Most residential situations occurred in Fort Bend County, while more roadway and worksite situations occurred in Jefferson County, and more livestock depredation occurred in Matagorda County. Conflict resolution differed by <b>alligator</b> size. Most (41 %) <b>alligators</b> 1. 5 m in length were removed through lethal means. Most (93 %) survey responders would support an <b>alligator</b> removal program that conducted capture and relocation, but they were unwilling to have <b>alligators</b> relocated near their homes. Only 15 % of survey responders would support an <b>alligator</b> management program that utilized lethal removal. Visitors with more education (bachelor’s degree or higher) were more willing to support lethal control of <b>alligators.</b> We determined that survey responders had some knowledge of <b>alligators</b> and that an <b>alligator</b> educational program targeted to residents of the northern Texas Gulf Coast could help reduce the number of human–alligator conflicts...|$|R
40|$|<b>Alligator</b> mississippiensis (American <b>Alligators)</b> {{demonstrated}} low hatchrate {{success and}} increased adult mortality on Lake Griffin, FL, between 1998 and 2003.

Similar lesions were documented in salmonines that consumed clupeids with high thiaminase levels. Therefore, we investigated the diet of Lake Griffin <b>alligators</b> and compared it with <b>alligator</b> diets from two lakes that exhibited relatively low levels of unexplained <b>alligator</b> mortality to see if consumption of Dorosoma cepedianum (gizzard shad) could be correlated with patterns of mortality. Shad in both lakes Griffin and Apopka had high levels of thiaminase and Lake Apopka <b>alligators</b> were consuming greater amounts of shad relative to Lake Griffin without showing mortality rates similar to Lake Griffin <b>alligators.</b> Therefore, a relationship between shad consumption alone and <b>alligator</b> mortality is not supported. ...|$|R
