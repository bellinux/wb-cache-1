5|$|There are {{two major}} eras {{of the history of}} US41. The first dates back to the Civil War and a wagon road built by the federal government. The Military Road was built to connect the Copper Country with Wisconsin. After the {{establishment}} of the state trunkline highway system, <b>a</b> <b>segment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Military Road was used for M-15, the predecessor of US41.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{has been}} a county road since 1960, F-41 was a state highway in 1919 when the state {{trunkline}} highway system was formed. It was <b>a</b> <b>segment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original M-10 that was replaced by US23 in 1926. Later changes to US23 shifted that road closer to Lake Huron, and the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) created two different routings for M-171 out of the former US23 routings in the area. The second of these highways has been designated F-41 since 1970.|$|E
5|$|Despite heavy weathering, {{the ditch}} is still visible in short sections, {{which can be}} 45yards wide and up to 5feet deep.

5|$|In living organisms, DNA {{does not}} usually {{exist as a}} single molecule, but instead {{as a pair of}} {{molecules}} that are held tightly together. These two long strands entwine like vines, {{in the shape of a}} double helix. The nucleotide contains both <b>a</b> <b>segment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> backbone of the molecule (which holds the chain together) and a nucleobase (which interacts with the other DNA strand in the helix). A nucleobase linked to a sugar is called a nucleoside and a base linked to a sugar and one or more phosphate groups is called a nucleotide. A polymer comprising multiple linked nucleotides (as in DNA) is called a polynucleotide.|$|E

5|$|Proposed {{methods for}} {{controlling}} gopher populations in agricultural areas include poisoning dandelions, clover, carrots, {{sweet potatoes and}} parsnips. Camas pocket gophers are larger than other gophers, so conventional gopher traps may fail to capture them. Toxic baits and fumigants may also fail, since the gophers will sometimes wall off <b>a</b> <b>segment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> burrow. Gophers may also cause local flooding if their tunneling activities damage levees.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} the {{business}} loop was still under state control, it was maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) as <b>a</b> <b>segment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> State Trunkline Highway System. As a part of these maintenance responsibilities, the department tracked the volume of traffic that used Bus. US41. These volumes were expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic, which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway. In the department's last survey, conducted in 2004, there were 10,272vehicles per day using Washington Street between Lincoln Avenue and Front Street, the lowest traffic count for the trunkline. The highest volume was 19,036vehicles between McClellan and Lincoln Avenues, while the Front Street section received 16,309vehicles on an average day. The former business loop has not been listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E
5|$|I-96 is {{maintained}} by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) as <b>a</b> <b>segment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> larger State Trunkline Highway System. In 2011, the department's traffic surveys showed that on average, 201,200vehicles used the highway daily between 6 and 7Mile roads in Livonia. Near Norton Shores, 20,638vehicles did so each day between Airline and Fruitport roads. These are the highest and lowest counts along the highway, respectively. As an Interstate Highway, all of I-96 {{is included in the}} National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. In addition, the highway in Detroit has been named the Rosa Parks Memorial Highway by the Michigan Legislature to honor the civil rights pioneer Rosa Parks. The segment from Livonia west to I-275 is the Jeffries Freeway, named for a former mayor of Detroit, Edward Jeffries.|$|E
5|$|Laguna del Maule is a {{volcanic}} {{field in the}} Andes mountain range of Chile, close to, and partly overlapping, the Chile-Argentina frontier. The bulk of the volcanic field is in the Talca province of Chile's Maule Region. It is <b>a</b> <b>segment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Southern Volcanic Zone, part of the Andean Volcanic Belt. Many of the volcanic centres in the Laguna del Maule volcanic field formed during postglacial times, after glaciers had retreated from the area. This activity has generated cones, lava domes, lava coulees and lava flows which surround Laguna del Maule lake. The field gets {{its name from the}} lake which is also the source of the Maule river. Some of the volcanic centres were active during and before the last glaciation; at least three caldera formation events are associated with the system.|$|E

Parliamentary rules ban parliamentary proceedings from being broadcast in a satirical context. Stewart dedicated <b>a</b> <b>segment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> show on August 2, 2011 to lampooning the censorship of the episode in Britain. In May that year, The Daily Show mocked the ban on using footage of the Royal Wedding in a satirical context with an animated video that showed Paddington Bear, Gollum and Adolf Hitler as guests at the wedding, and depicted its attendants engaging in various forms of violent and sexual behavior. Stewart later discussed the ban with guest Keira Knightley.|$|E
5|$|The {{political}} independence and {{sovereignty of the}} Malagasy armed forces, which comprises an army, navy and air force, was restored with independence from France in 1960. Since this time the Malagasy military has never engaged in armed conflict with another state or within its own borders, but has occasionally intervened to restore order during periods of political unrest. Under the socialist Second Republic, Admiral Didier Ratsiraka instated mandatory national armed or civil service for all young citizens regardless of gender, a policy that remained in effect from 1976 to 1991. The armed forces are {{under the direction of}} the Minister of the Interior and have remained largely neutral during times of political crisis, as during the protracted standoff between incumbent Ratsiraka and challenger Marc Ravalomanana in the disputed 2001 presidential elections, when the military refused to intervene in favor of either candidate. This tradition was broken in 2009, when <b>a</b> <b>segment</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> army defected to the side of Andry Rajoelina, then-mayor of Antananarivo, in support of his attempt to force President Ravalomanana from power.|$|E

During weekends, Central Link trains arrive every 10 minutes during midday hours and every 15 minutes during mornings and evenings. Light rail service from Westlake to International District/Chinatown takes approximately seven minutes.|$|E
