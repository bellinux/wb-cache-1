5000|$|Under Downs as host, 20/20 {{changed into}} a more {{standard}} yet unique newsmagazine and received kinder reviews from critics. The program was originally launched as a summer replacement series; it was then presented on a once-a-month basis during the 1978-79 television season, before being given a regular weekly timeslot on Thursdays at 10:00 p.m. Eastern Time beginning May 31, 1979. Ratings were generally very good {{during the summer months}} during its eight years on Thursday nights despite competition from Knots Landing on CBS and Hill Street Blues on NBC. It was around this time that the program started using the Brock Brower-written signoff line [...] "We're in touch, so you be in touch" [...] to end each program, which continues to be used to now (the program also used the line [...] "Around the world <b>and</b> <b>into</b> <b>your</b> <b>home,</b> {{the stories that touch your}} life" [...] as the introduction during the show's opening titles for much of the 1990s).|$|E

The letters stand for "Separate Materials And RecycleTogether". We think it'soriginal, catchy and fun; but it meansso much more. The key word is TOGETHER [...] Public Service staff and employees working together with our customers in a kind of partnership. Oh sure, we made the initial decisions, modified the routes and schedules, purchased the equipment, trained the personnel, negotiated with the markets, and distributed the green boxes; but it's our customers who will make the difference. You will make decisions everyday as to which materials will be placed in your trash cart, and which will be placed in your S. M. A. R. T. box. These decisions will make a difference in your environment, your community, and in the volume of waste taken to the incinerator or landfill. You will also make decisions concerning the materials you purchase <b>and</b> bring <b>into</b> <b>your</b> <b>home.</b> Recycling requires a change of attitude and lifestyle [...] changes we recognize as being inconvenient at times to our customers. Our partnership requires patience. Changes in routes, schedules and methods will cause some coniusion. (Please check the box at the bottom left corner for your collection days.) We anticipate a "fine tuning " process which may last several weeks. Please be patient! A number of other change...|$|R

40|$|Ants can {{be divided}} into three groups for the purpose of pest control: indoor, outdoor, and wood destroying. INDOOR ANTS Pharaoh ants, small and reddish-brown in color, are the most common ant species to nest indoors. Conventional pesticides, in {{addition}} to their potential human health risks, have been shown to cause pharaoh ant colonies to disperse <b>and</b> split up <b>into</b> multiple colonies, making them even more difficult to control. Prevention Ants, other than Pharaoh ants, observed indoors are probably coming from outside. They usually follow distinct chemical trails that they have left to easily find their way from their point of entry to their food source. Follow the ant trail, identify the points of entry <b>into</b> <b>your</b> <b>home,</b> <b>and</b> seal them out. If you don’t have a clear ant trail, place small pieces of cardboard or wax paper with syrup or a high-protein treat (depending on your ant type) out at night.
