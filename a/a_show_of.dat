5|$|A {{detachment}} of 18 {{men of the}} 1st The Royal Dragoons, commanded by Captain Methuen, arrived in Ely from Bury on 23 May in the late afternoon. They marched through the streets as <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> force, remaining all night. The following afternoon, 24 May, the troops marched on Littleport, led by Sir Henry Bate Dudley and John Bacon, a Bow Street constable. They were followed by the Royston troop of volunteer yeomanry cavalry summoned earlier by Henry Law, and a militia of gentlemen and inhabitants of Ely.|$|E
5|$|A {{letter of}} support from 120 members of the German parliament, the Bundestag, {{was sent to the}} Russian Ambassador to Germany, Vladimir Grinin. It {{described}} proceedings against the women as disproportionate and draconian. On August 9, 2012, 200 Pussy Riot supporters in Berlin marched, wearing colored balaclavas, in <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> support for the group. Attending the trial, British MP and Shadow Foreign Office Minister for Human Rights, Kerry McCarthy, also backed the group, describing proceedings as “surreal”. Lech Wałęsa criticised the church performance as “tasteless”, but nevertheless wrote to Putin urging him to pardon the women.|$|E

5|$|A {{new problem}} confronted the Confederates. The {{dead and wounded}} of Grant's army lay {{in the heat of}} Mississippi summer, the odor of the {{deceased}} men and horses fouling the air, the wounded crying for medical help and water. Grant first refused a request of truce, thinking it <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> weakness. Finally he relented, and the Confederates held their fire while the Union recovered the wounded and dead, soldiers from both sides mingling and trading as if no hostilities existed for the moment.|$|E
5|$|At Borden's murder trial, Angier's ingénieur John Cutter testifies how Borden {{pushed the}} water tank under the trap door {{to catch and}} kill Angier during his New Transported Man trick. In prison, Borden is visited by an agent of Lord Caldlow, who offers to care for Borden's {{daughter}} Jess in exchange for all of Borden's tricks. As <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> good faith, Caldlow gives Borden a copy of Angier's diary, which Borden reads.|$|E
5|$|France, Russia and the United Kingdom {{recognised}} {{the autonomy}} of Greece, which remained a vassal state of the Ottoman Empire. The three powers agreed to a limited intervention in order to convince the Porte to accept {{the terms of the}} convention. A plan to send a naval expedition as <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> force was proposed and adopted. A joint Russian, French and British fleet was sent to exercise diplomatic pressure against Constantinople. The Battle of Navarino (October 1827), fought after a chance encounter, resulted in the destruction of the Turkish-Egyptian fleet.|$|E

5|$|Glastonbury {{fell into}} Saxon hands after the Battle of Peonnum in 658. Saxons under Cenwalh of Wessex conquered Somerset as far west as the River Parrett, perhaps with the {{intention}} of gaining control of the abbey. Cenwalh allowed the British abbot, Bregored, to remain in power, a move perhaps intended as <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> good faith to the defeated Britons. After Bregored's death in 669, he was replaced by an Anglo-Saxon, Berhtwald, but British monks remained for many years.|$|E
5|$|Hazelwood {{never had}} his masters' license revoked {{and it remains}} valid to this date, {{but he has been}} unable to find {{long-term}} work as a captain after the spill. His alma mater, SUNY Maritime College, hired him in <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> solidarity as a teacher aboard the T/S Empire State V the year after the incident with the Valdez. In 1997, he was working as a para-legal and maritime consultant with New York City's Chalos & Brown, the firm that represented him in his legal cases. He was residing in his native Long Island as of 1997.|$|E
5|$|He {{returned}} to Rome in December, and {{was present in}} March 20 when Agrippina arrived with Germanicus' ashes. He was also present for the trial of Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso, who was posthumously found guilty for the crime of maiestas (treason). On 16 December, his father gave a eulogy for Germanicus during a Senate meeting, and he gave a eulogy the next meeting. It was decided that their eulogies would both be inscribed in bronze: that of Tiberius for future generations, but the libellus (eulogy) of Drusus to demonstrate the devotion of Drusus for his adoptive brother in <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> pietas (piety).|$|E

5|$|He {{was found}} guilty and punished posthumously for the crime of treason. The Senate had his {{property}} proscribed, forbade mourning on his account, removed images of his likeness, such as statues and portraits, and his name was erased {{from the base of}} one statue in particular as part of his damnatio memoriae. Yet, in <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> clemency not unlike that of the emperor, the Senate had Piso's property returned and divided equally between his two sons, on condition that his daughter Calpurnia be given 1,000,000 sesterces as dowry and a further 4,000,000 as personal property. His wife Placina was absolved.|$|E
5|$|In 965 or 966, a Bulgarian embassy {{visited the}} Byzantine emperor Nikephoros II Phokas (r. 963–969) at Constantinople {{to receive the}} annual tribute that had been agreed by the two powers {{as the price of}} peace in 927. Phokas, flush and self-confident from a series of {{victories}} against the Arabs in the East that had led to the recovery of Crete, Cyprus and Cilicia, refused to comply, and even had the envoys beaten up. He followed this up with <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> military strength, by sending a small force to raze a number of Bulgarian border posts in Thrace.|$|E

5|$|Most Native Americans in {{the region}} decided against joining the uprising, and so the {{conflict}} ended after U.S. officials responded with <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> military force. Ho-Chunk chiefs surrendered eight men {{who had participated in}} the violence, including Red Bird, who American officials believed to be the ringleader. Red Bird died in prison in 1828 while awaiting trial; two other men convicted of murder were pardoned by President John Quincy Adams and released.|$|E
5|$|Muhammad and the Muslims {{buried the}} {{dead on the}} battlefield, {{returning}} home that evening. The Meccans retired for the evening {{at a place called}} Hamra al-Asad, a few miles away from Medina. The next morning, Muhammad sent out a small force to harass the Meccan army on their way home. According to Watt, this was because Muhammad realized that <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> force was required to speed the Meccans away from Medinan territory. The Meccans, not wanting to be perceived as being chased away, remained nearby for a few days before leaving.|$|E

The government's decision was confirmed by the Fourth Seimas with minimal discussion. On March 19, Dailidė relayed acceptance of the ultimatum to the Poles, who gave a 12-hour extension to decide on the ultimatum as <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>of</b> good faith.|$|E
