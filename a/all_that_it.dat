25|$|The self {{is found}} to be a cause of force, free in its action, on the ground that we are obliged to relate the {{volition}} of consciousness to the self as its cause, and its ultimate cause. It is not clear from the analysis whether the self is immediately observed as an acting or originating cause, or whether reflection working on the principle of causality is compelled to infer its existence and character. If self is actually so given, we do not need the principle of causality to infer it; if it is not so given, causality could never give us either the notion or the fact of self as a cause or force, far less as an ultimate one. <b>All</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> could do would be to warrant a cause of some sort, but not this or that reality as the cause. And further, the principle of causality, if fairly carried out, as universal and necessary, would not allow us to stop at personality or will as the ultimate cause of its effect—volition. Once applied to the facts at all, it would drive us beyond the first antecedent or term of antecedents of volition to a still further cause or ground—in fact, land us in an infinite regress of causes.|$|E

On [...] 939 Æthelstan, the [...] "pillar of {{the dignity of the}} western world" [...] {{in the words of the}} Annals of Ulster, died at Malmesbury. He was succeeded by his brother Edmund, then aged 18. Æthelstan's empire, {{seemingly}} made safe by the victory of Brunanburh, collapsed in little more than a year from his death when Amlaíb returned from Ireland and seized Northumbria and the Mercian Danelaw. Edmund spent the remainder of Constantín's reign rebuilding the empire.|$|E

500|$|Ian Hendry {{stars as}} Dr John Kane, British {{astrophysicist}} {{and head of}} the Phoenix project. Hendry, who had appeared in the television series The Avengers (1961–69) and, according to Anderson, [...] "was always drinking", performed the stunt sequence depicting the aftermath of the Dove crash while drunk: [...] "...he was pissed as a newt, and it was {{as much as he could}} do to stagger away. Despite <b>all</b> <b>that,</b> <b>it</b> looked exactly as it was supposed to on-screen!" [...] In the draft script, Kane's first name is Philip, and he has a wife called Susan. In scenes deleted from the completed film, a romance between Kane and Lise Hartman, a EUROSEC official portrayed by Austrian actress Loni von Friedl, is played out at Kane's villa and on a beach in Portugal.|$|E
500|$|Although Milian was a {{songwriter}} since her teenagers years, she only felt real growth during the production sessions when Dre told her, [...] "there are no rules". Previously, Milian would write songs that followed rules, {{where she would}} have a hook, a verse, and another verse with similar sound and melody. For So Amazin, she wrote with a [...] "no rules theory", which was her biggest obstacle while recording the album. She said, [...] "It was just, you know what? I can change up the melody I can do different things. Sometimes I might get stuck but wait half an hour and it'll come to you and end up being hot. So that's probably my biggest obstacle, just stepping away from doing the usual that I know and stepping into something new. Once I got past <b>all</b> <b>that,</b> <b>it</b> was just easy. With flying colors, I started writing all the records." ...|$|E
500|$|Alfred, by [...] in {{full control}} of Wessex and {{at the height of}} his power, was clearly bent on trying to settle the kingship on his son, Edward, to the {{exclusion}} of his brother Æthelred's heirs. That kingship was never in Alfred's gift, but clearly the greater amount of landed wealth he could entail on Edward, the stronger he made that son's position in any future contest for the kingship. We must, therefore, treat anything he tells us of the terms of the disputed inheritance of his rival nephews with the utmost caution, if not scepticism. The support which Alfred tells us he received from the witan counts for little. As king, Alfred controlled immense patronage in relation to his thegns, who stood to benefit from backing their lord against claims which his nephews made on his property. It is significant that the case ever came before the witan at <b>all.</b> <b>That</b> <b>it</b> did, suggests that Æthelhelm and Æthelwold were by then young men who commanded some independent support and sympathy in Wessex.|$|E

500|$|When the Second World War {{broke out}} in 1939, Southern Rhodesia had been self-governing for sixteen years, having gained {{responsible}} government from the UK in 1923. It was unique in the British Empire and Commonwealth in that it held extensive autonomous powers (including defence, but not foreign affairs) while lacking dominion status. As a British colony, Southern Rhodesia entered the conflict automatically when Britain declared war on September 3, but its government issued a symbolic declaration of war anyway. Smith, who was about halfway through his university course, later described feeling patriotically compelled to put his studies aside to [...] "fight for Britain and <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> represented". Excited {{by the idea of}} flying a Spitfire, he wanted to join the air force, but was prevented from immediately doing so by a policy adopted in Rhodesia not to recruit university students until after they graduated. Smith engineered his recruitment into the Royal Air Force (RAF) in spite of this rule during 1940, suppressing mention of his studies, and formally joined in September 1941.|$|E

[...] Although a Hobart nomination had been talked about at least since Griggs' victory the previous November, Hobart expressed reluctance {{in a letter to}} his wife from the convention: [...] "It looks to me I will be nominated for Vice-President whether I want it or not, and as I get nearer to the point where I may, I am dismayed at the thought... If I want a nomination, everything is going my way. But when I realize <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> means in work, worry, and loss of home and bliss, I am overcome, so overcome I am simply miserable." [...] Despite Hobart's expressed hesitation, he was welcomed home by a crowd of 15,000 at the Paterson Armory. [...] City officials, feeling they had insufficient fireworks to properly honor Hobart, obtained more from New York City.|$|E
500|$|Carte's first London season, at the Prince's Theatre, 1919–20, {{featured}} ten of {{the thirteen}} extant Gilbert and Sullivan operas. [...] These included Princess Ida, which had its first London performances since the original production. [...] The new productions retained the text and music of the original 1870s and 1880s productions, and director J. M. Gordon preserved much of Gilbert's original direction. [...] As his parents had done, Carte licensed the operas to the J. C. Williamson company and to amateur companies, but he required all licensees to present them in approved productions that closely followed the libretto, score and D'Oyly Carte production stagings. [...] In an interview with The Times in 1922, Carte said that the Savoy [...] "tradition" [...] was an expression that was frequently misunderstood: [...] "It did {{not by any means}} imply any hidebound stage 'business' or an attempt to standardize the performances of artists so as to check their individual method of expression. [...] <b>All</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> implied, in his view, was the highest possible standard of production – with especial attention to clear enunciation.... Many people seemed to think that Gilbert believed in absolutely set methods but this was not by any means the case. [...] He did not hesitate to alter productions when they were revived." ...|$|E

500|$|Welles said, [...] "the {{film was}} not {{intended}} as a lament for Falstaff, but {{for the death of}} Merrie England. Merrie England as a conception, a myth which has been very real to the English-speaking world, and is to some extent expressed in other countries of the Medieval epoch: the age of chivalry, of simplicity, of Maytime and <b>all</b> <b>that.</b> <b>It</b> is more than Falstaff who is dying. It's the old England dying and betrayed." [...] Many film theorists and Welles biographers have written about the recurrent theme of the [...] "Lost Eden" [...] in Welles's work and of characters who are nostalgic for an idealized past, which Welles called [...] "the central theme in Western culture." [...] Welles told Peter Bogdanovich that [...] "even if the good old days never existed, the fact that we can conceive of such a world is, in fact, an affirmation of the human spirit." [...] Film scholar Beverle Houston argued that this nostalgia made Welles's depiction of Falstaff infantile and called his performance a [...] "ower baby...an eating, sucking, foetus-like creature." [...] Welles also called Falstaff [...] "the greatest conception of a good man, the most completely good man, in all of drama", and said that [...] "the closer I thought I was getting to Falstaff the less funny he seemed to me. When I played him before in the theater, he seemed more witty than comical. And in bringing him to the screen, I found him only occasionally, and only deliberately, a clown." ...|$|E
500|$|Parasakthi {{received}} critical acclaim. P. Balasubramania Mudaliar of Sunday Observer wrote, [...] "The {{story is}} simple {{but it has}} been made powerful by Mr. Karunanidhi by his beautiful dialogues. Mr. Shivaji Ganesan, who plays the main role dominates from the beginning to the end" [...] and concluded, [...] "If an Academy award were to be given to any picture, I have little doubt that this picture would be entitled on its merits to such an award." [...] Dinamani Kadir, a Tamil weekly owned by Indian Express Limited (then known as The Indian Express Group), carried an unusually long review of Parasakthi running into three closely printed pages. The review was given a cynical title, [...] "Kandarva Mandalam" [...] ("The Abode of Kandarvas") and it began with a small box-item which read, [...] "Parasakthi: This goddess is abused in a Tamil film with her name". The reviewer opined, [...] "The main aim of the film is to attach gods. Along with that, the government and society are overtly and covertly attacked. The embittered and agitated reviewer further claimed, [...] "He , acting as a mad man, threatens and beats the people on the street and grabs whatever they have and eats it. Then he goes to give repeatedly all those economics lectures, rationalist lectures and anti-god lectures. When we see the hero doing <b>all</b> <b>that,</b> <b>it</b> seems as if he is portraying the lives of those who are trying to force such ideas in the ...film." [...] For the reviewer, thus, the DMK men were living on others' sweat and preaching unacceptable subsersive ideas. The magazine Sivaji praised the dialogues written by Karunanidhi, and the performances of Ganesan and Sahasranamam.|$|E
500|$|Elgar was knighted at Buckingham Palace on 5 July 1904. The {{following}} month, he and {{his family}} moved to Plâs Gwyn, a large house on the outskirts of Hereford, overlooking the River Wye, where they lived until 1911. Between 1902 and 1914, Elgar was, in Kennedy's words, at the zenith of popularity. He made four visits to the US, including one conducting tour, and earned considerable fees from the performance of his music. Between 1905 and 1908, he held the post of Peyton Professor of Music at the University of Birmingham. He had accepted the post reluctantly, feeling that a composer should not head a school of music. He was not at ease in the role, and his lectures caused controversy, with his attacks on the critics and on English music in general: [...] "Vulgarity in the course of time may be refined. Vulgarity often goes with inventiveness ... but the commonplace mind can never be anything but commonplace. An Englishman will take you into a large room, beautifully proportioned, and will point out to you that it is white – all over white – and somebody will say, 'What exquisite taste'. You know in your own mind, in your own soul, that it is not taste at <b>all,</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is the want of taste, that is mere evasion. English music is white, and evades everything." [...] He regretted the controversy and was glad to hand on the post to his friend Granville Bantock in 1908. His new life as a celebrity was a mixed blessing to the highly strung Elgar, as it interrupted his privacy, and he often was in ill-health. He complained to Jaeger in 1903, [...] "My life is one continual giving up of little things which I love." [...] Both W. S. Gilbert and Thomas Hardy sought to collaborate with Elgar in this decade. Elgar refused, but would have collaborated with George Bernard Shaw had Shaw been willing.|$|E
