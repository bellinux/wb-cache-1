5|$|The {{night before}} his cancer surgery, Fox {{had been given}} an article about Dick Traum, the first amputee to {{complete}} the New York City Marathon. The article inspired him; he embarked on a 14-month training program, telling his family he planned to compete in <b>a</b> <b>marathon</b> himself. In private, he devised a more extensive plan. His hospital experiences had made Fox angry at how little money was dedicated to cancer research. He intended to run the length of Canada {{in the hope of}} increasing cancer awareness, a goal he initially divulged to only his friend Douglas Alward.|$|E
5|$|Also in 2002, DiCaprio {{appeared}} in Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York, a historical film {{set in the}} mid-19th century in the Five Points district of New York City. Director Scorsese initially struggled selling his idea of realizing the film until DiCaprio became interested in playing protagonist Amsterdam Vallon, a young leader of the Irish faction, and thus, Miramax Films got involved with financing the project. Nonetheless production on the film was plagued by blown-out budgets and producer-director squabbles, resulting in <b>a</b> <b>marathon</b> eight-month shoot and, at US$103 million, the most expensive film Scorsese had ever made. Upon its release, Gangs of New York became a financial and critical success. DiCaprio's acting was well-received but was overshadowed by Daniel Day-Lewis' performance among most critics.|$|E

In 2015, Niconico's Japanese channel ran <b>a</b> <b>marathon</b> broadcast of all twelve episodes starting from June 28.

5|$|In <b>a</b> <b>marathon</b> {{meeting on}} 20/21 February 2012 the Eurogroup {{agreed with the}} IMF and the Institute of International Finance on the final {{conditions}} of the second bailout package worth €130 billion. The lenders agreed to increase the nominal haircut from 50% to 53.5%. EU Member States agreed to an additional retroactive lowering of the interest rates of the Greek Loan Facility {{to a level of}} just 150 basis points above Euribor. Furthermore, governments of Member States where central banks currently hold Greek government bonds in their investment portfolio commit to pass on to Greece an amount equal to any future income until 2020. Altogether this should bring down Greece's debt to between 117% and 120.5% of GDP by 2020.|$|E
5|$|Struggling with {{injuries}} and motivation issues after his exhaustive U.S. tour in 1925, Nurmi found his long-time rivals Ville Ritola and Edvin Wide ever more serious challengers. At the 1928 Summer Olympics, Nurmi recaptured the 10,000 m title but was beaten {{for the gold}} in the 5000 m and the 3000 m steeplechase. He then {{turned his attention to}} longer distances, breaking the world records for events such as the one hour run and the 25-mile marathon. Nurmi intended to end his career with <b>a</b> <b>marathon</b> gold medal, as his idol Kolehmainen had done. In a controversial case that strained Finland–Sweden relations and sparked an inter-IAAF battle, Nurmi was suspended before the 1932 Games by an IAAF council that questioned his amateur status. Two days before the opening ceremonies, the council rejected his entries. Although he was never declared a professional, Nurmi's suspension became definite in 1934 and he retired from running.|$|E
5|$|The {{establishment}} of the modern Olympic Games {{at the end of}} the 19th century marked a new high for track and field. The Olympic athletics programme, comprising track and field events plus <b>a</b> <b>marathon</b> race, contained many of the foremost sporting competitions of the 1896 Summer Olympics. The Olympics also consolidated the use of metric measurements in international track and field events, both for race distances and for measuring jumps and throws. The Olympic athletics programme greatly expanded over the next decades, and track and field contests remained among the Games' most prominent. The Olympics was the elite competition for track and field, and only amateur sportsmen could compete. Track and field continued to be a largely amateur sport, as this rule was strictly enforced: Jim Thorpe was stripped of his track and field medals from the 1912 Olympics after it was revealed that he had played baseball professionally.|$|E

5|$|The {{physical}} demands of running <b>a</b> <b>marathon</b> every day {{took its toll}} on Fox's body. Apart from the rest days in Montreal taken {{at the request of}} the Cancer Society, he refused to take a day off, even on his 22nd birthday. He frequently suffered shin splints and an inflamed knee. He developed cysts on his stump and experienced dizzy spells. At one point, he suffered a soreness in his ankle that would not go away. Although he feared he had developed a stress fracture, he ran for three more days before seeking medical attention, and was then relieved to learn it was tendonitis and could be treated with painkillers. Fox rejected calls for him to seek regular medical checkups, and dismissed suggestions he was risking his future health.|$|E
5|$|There {{was only}} one public {{pre-season}} friendly on 13 August, which saw the club's first team take on the reserves; it ended with a surprise 4–2 victory for the reserves, Roland Lewis scoring a hat-trick. Pre-season training consisted primarily of assistant manager Ken Fish leading <b>a</b> <b>marathon</b> running session from Burslem to Hanley and back to Burslem following a stop at a pub for a half-pint of shandy. After returning to the ground Fish would organise a practise game. The fitness work was actually crucial to the team's success, as Steele was {{ahead of his time}} in that he insisted that wide players should defend when the opposition were on the ball, in order to support the defence. Superstition was of great importance to Steele, who ensured that the team rigidly stuck their pre-match rituals such as the intricacies of kit layout and the order in which players entered the pitch.|$|E
5|$|Venezuela's then-president Ramón José Velásquez held an {{emergency}} meeting {{to respond to}} the Bret's heavy damage. The president conveyed three days of national mourning due to the storm. About 1,400workers and volunteers helped in rescue efforts after the mudslides struck Caracas and surrounding areas, assisted by Red Cross volunteers and 800firefighters. Volunteers provided water and medicine to the affected, while workers emptied residual pools of water to mitigate the spread of disease. Storm victims were temporarily housed at the Fuerte Tiuna army base. Roads were quickly cleared of debris and mud, although many were not reopened initially due to the threat for additional mudslides. Within a week of the storm's passage, telephone service was largely repaired in Caracas and airline travel was restored. After the storm, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) provided US$50,000 in emergency spending, and UNICEF sent US$15,000 to buy oral rehydration salts. A Venezuelan radio station held <b>a</b> <b>marathon</b> to collect relief items, such as food or clothing.|$|E
