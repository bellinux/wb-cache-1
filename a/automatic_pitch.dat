40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} to the <b>automatic</b> detection of <b>pitch</b> accent in spoken English. The approach that we propose {{is based on a}} time-delay recursive neural network (TDRNN), which takes into account contextual information in two ways: (1) a delayed version of prosodic and spectral features serve as inputs which represent an explicit trajectory along time; and (2) recursions from the output layer and some hidden layers provide the contextual labeling information that reflects characteristics of pitch accentuation in spoken English. We apply the TDRNN to pitch accent detection in two forms. In the normal TDRNN, all of the prosodic and spectral features are used as an entire set in a single TDRNN. In the distributed TDRNN, the network consists of several TDRNNs each treating each prosodic feature as a single input. In addition, we propose a feature called spectral balance-based cepstral coefficient (SBCC) to capture the spectral characteristic of pitch accentuation. We used the Boston Radio News Corpus (BRNC) to conduct experiments on the speakerindependent detection of pitch accent. The experimental results showed that the <b>automatic</b> labels of <b>pitch</b> accent exhibited an average of 83. 6 % agreement with the hand labels. 1...|$|R

Besides, the proposed method can be utilized to check the polarity consistence of a speech corpus, which is important for the concatenation of speech units in speech synthesis.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a system for}} the <b>automatic</b> labelling of <b>pitch</b> levels and pitch movements in speech corpora. Five pitch levels are defined: Bottom and Top of the speaker’s pitch range, as well as Low, Mid, and High, which are determined {{on the basis of}} pitch changes in the local context. Five elementary pitch movements of individual syllables are distinguished on the basis of direction (rise, fall, level) and size (large and small melodic intervals, adjusted to the speaker’s pitch range). Compound movements consist of a concatenation of simple ones. The labelling system combines several processing steps: segmentation into syllabic nuclei, pause detection, pitch stylization, pitch range estimation, pitch movement classification, and pitch level assignment. Unlike commonly used supervised learning techniques the system does not require a labelled training corpus. This approach results in an automatic, fine-grained and readable annotation, which is language-independent, speaker-independent and does not depend upon a particular phonological model of prosody. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|A new {{quantitative}} {{model of}} tonal perception for continuous speech is described. The paper illustrates its ability for <b>automatic</b> stylization of <b>pitch</b> contours, with applications to prosodic analysis and speech synthesis in mind, and evaluates it in a perception experiment. After {{a discussion of}} the psychoacoustics of tonal perception and an overview of existing tonal perception models and systems for automatic analysis of intonation, the model and its computer implementation are described in detail. It includes parameter extraction, segmentation into syllables, perceptual integration of short term pitch change, tonal segment computation, and pitch contour stylization. This is followed by a perception experiment in which subjects are asked to distinguish original signals from resynthesized signals with automatically stylized pitch contours. The aim of this experiment is to show the usefulness of the model as a basis for intonation representation, and to study the influence of the model parameters. It is shown that the stylization obtained with the model is an economic representation of intonation which can be useful for speech synthesis and prosodic analysis. 4...|$|R
