A few, however, like Nicholas Gurewitch's The Perry Bible Fellowship and Drew Weing's Pup, did make use of the format (Pup won a Web Cartoonists' Choice Award in the [...] "infinite canvas" [...] category in 2005). Boxer pointed out that most popular webcomics either fit on a webpage easily [...] such as Adrian Ramos's Count Your Sheep [...] or attempted to use various aspects of the digital medium, such as Flash animation and music. That same year, Joe Zabel also noted that the primary purpose for the infinite canvas would be to create lengthy and deep works on the Web, while comic strips like PvP and Penny Arcade showed to have much more success in this environment. Because of the time that would go into any page of an infinite canvas comic, Zabel deemed it unlikely for such webcomics to gain a large popularity. Journalist Eric Burns, meanwhile, claimed that McCloud was mainly discussing the potential of webcomics, rather than what they <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> <b>like.</b>|$|E
60|$|Again, it is gravely {{unfortunate that}} when critics do attack such cases as the Commons {{it is always}} on the points (perhaps the few points) where the Commons are right. They {{denounce}} the House as the Talking-Shop, and complain that it wastes time in wordy mazes. Now this is just one respect in which the Commons <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> <b>like</b> the Common People. If they love leisure and long debate, it is because all men love it; that they really represent England. There the Parliament does approach to the virile virtues of the pothouse.|$|E

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} {{data collection}} owner. High Emotional Intelligence (EI) {{is associated with}} prosocial behavior. This claim is based on self-reports or reports of behaviour assessed by others: there is as yet no objective study that tells us what the interactions of low EI individuals <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> <b>like.</b> The absence {{of these kinds of}} data means that intervention strategies designed to help school children develop EI skills, may not target the development of context-appropriate skills. This project aims to address this gap. Put simply, we are asking, 'What might the social interactions of children with low EI look like?' We also ask whether there are group-size effects, where children scoring low on EI may experience more problems interacting in larger groups than same-age peers who score high on EI. This project has an additional focus on lonely children. Evidence suggests that although lonely children understand the implicit rules and routines that characterise social situations (high/average EI), they say they have problems during social interactions. But do their actual interaction patterns reveal underlying social dysfunction? Given earlier findings, we predict that, because lonely children expect to be rejected, they may become more vigilant to signs of potential rejection and therefore, focus on cues consistent with this expectation...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this article}} is to conceptualize {{autonomy}} in the context of chronic physical illness. To this end, we compare and contrast a selection of contemporary philosophical theories of autonomy with social scientific perspectives on chronic illness, particularly models of disability and symbolic interactionism. The philosophical theories mainly depart from a positive conceptualization of autonomy, which involves actively shaping one's life and identifying with fundamental values. This conceptualization is preferred over a negative conceptualization, which defines autonomy as non-interference, for its compatibility with social models of disability and with the assumption that people are interdependent. Interference may disable, but also enable people with a chronic illness to shape their lives. What matters is that people can realize what they want to realize. We suggest that, in the context of chronic physical illness, autonomy might be conceptualized as correspondence between what people want their lives to be like and what their lives <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> <b>like.</b> Disturbed autonomy might be restored either by expanding opportunities to arrange life or by adjusting how one wants life to be arranged. The grounds for the latter approach might be questioned, first, if people have not adjusted what they want carefully, and second, if reorganization of the material and social environment would have made it unnecessary to adjust one's arrangement of life...|$|E
