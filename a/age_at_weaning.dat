40|$|ObjectiveTo {{test whether}} earlier <b>age</b> <b>at</b> <b>weaning</b> (age 3 - 6  months) may promote faster growth during infancy. Study designWeaning at age 3. 0 - 7. 0  months was {{reported}} by 571 mothers of term singletons in a prospective birth cohort study conducted in Cambridge, UK. Infant weight and length were measured at birth and at age 3  months and 12  months. Anthropometric values were transformed into age- and sex-adjusted z-scores. Three linear regression models were performed, including adjustment for confounders in a stepwise manner. Measurements at age 3  months, before weaning, were used to consider reverse causality. ResultsAlmost three-quarters (72. 9 %) of infants were weaned before age 6  months. <b>Age</b> <b>at</b> <b>weaning</b> of 3. 0 - 7. 0  months was inversely associated with weight and length (but not with body mass index) at 12  months (both P ≤ . 01, adjusted for maternal and demographic factors). These associations were attenuated after adjustment for type of milk feeding and weight or length at age 3  months (before weaning). Rapid weight gain between 0 and 3  months predicted subsequent earlier <b>age</b> <b>at</b> <b>weaning</b> (P = . 01). Our systematic review identified 2 trials, both reporting null effects of <b>age</b> <b>at</b> <b>weaning</b> on growth, and 15 observational studies, with 10 reporting an inverse association between <b>age</b> <b>at</b> <b>weaning</b> and infant growth and 4 reporting evidence of reverse causality.

This study examines associations between weaning and household demographic variables that test predictions derived from parental investment (PI) theory.

40|$|For 829 {{mammalian}} species, data on <b>age</b> <b>at</b> <b>weaning</b> or age {{at first}} solid food were analyzed with respect to body mass, phylogeny, habitat, diet, length of gestation, basal metabolism, and neonatal development. The primary influence on lactation length is female mass, but phylogenetic constraints are important. Thus, lactation {{can be characterized as}} short (earless seals and baleen whales), long (marsupials, bats, and primates), or average (remaining eutherians). Among average mammals, lagomorphs have short lactations. Lactation may have different functions, evolutionary constraints, and physiological control depending on whether young first eat solid food near weaning or well before it. First solid food eaten near weaning occurs in polytocous species with altricial young; in this case, lactation has a clear energetic role. In contrast, first solid food well before weaning is common for mammals with single, precocial offspring. For these species, the energetic and nutritional constraints on lactation may be less important than the benefits of maintaining contact between mother and young, such as reduced juvenile mortality and increased opportunities for learning social or foraging patterns. Thus, the {{age at first}} solid food relative to the <b>age</b> <b>at</b> <b>weaning</b> may indicate the function of lactation within the reproductive biology of a given mammal. Delayed development and implantation alter the timing of energetic investment during gestation, so too, the age at first solid food may alter or reflect the rate of energetic investment during lactation. Thus, the age at first solid food relative to the <b>age</b> <b>at</b> <b>weaning</b> may indicate the function of lactation within the reproductive biology of a given mammal. Testing these hypotheses will require data from diverse species on the nutritional and energetic value of milk before and after first solid food {{as well as on the}} mechanics and consequences of nursing or suckling during the course of lactation.

Foram utilizados 16 cordeiros machos, confinados individualmente após o desmame, até atingirem peso vivo ao abate. Os cordeiros foram abatidos, e suas carcaças foram pesadas para determinação dos rendimentos de carcaça quente e verdadeiro. Os não-componentes da carcaça foram pesados separadamente e suas porcentagens, calculadas em relação ao peso vivo ao abate. Após 24 horas de resfriamento, obtiveram-se os rendimentos de carcaça fria e as perdas de peso por resfriamento. As meias carcaças foram seccionadas em cinco cortes comerciais. Não houve diferença para peso ao nascer (3, 73 kg); peso ao desmame (14, 55 kg); ganho de peso diário (0, 283 kg/animal/dia) e conversão alimentar (3, 13). Cordeiros desmamados aos 60 dias apresentaram maior consumo de matéria seca (0, 908 kg/animal/dia), menor tempo de confinamento (56 dias) e menor idade ao abate (116 dias).

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the effect of liquid milk supplement on litter performance (weight development of the piglets, weaning weight and mortality) and on sow back-fat thickness change during the suckling period. Data were collected from 150 litters, with the weight of a total of 1709 piglets measured at birth, at 14 days of <b>age</b> and <b>at</b> <b>weaning</b> (28 days), respectively. Sow (n = 150) back-fat depth was measured the day before farrowing, 14 days after farrowing and <b>at</b> <b>weaning.</b> In the control group (n = 363), the piglets were suckled and got pre-starter feed from day 10. In the four experimental groups (MS 1; MS 2; MS 2 and MS 4; n = 1346), the piglets received additional milk replacer in various concentrations from the 10 th day of life. While there were no significant differences in birth weight between the control and experimental groups, we did find significant differences between the 14 -day weights and weaning weights. The milk supplement significantly reduced mortality compared to the control (11. 6 vs. 4. 9; 5. 9, 8. 9; 8. 3 %). However, there were no statistically significant differences between litter homogeneity data, based on the CV% of piglet weight. Three experimental groups (MS 1, MS 2 and MS 4) were more homogenous compared to the control group <b>at</b> <b>weaning</b> (25. 3 vs. 20. 9; 20. 3; 20. 3 CV%). Based on the examination of sow back-fat thickness reduction, there were significant differences between the control (C) and MS 3 groups (7. 61 vs. 5. 57 mm reduction, P < 0. 05) during the suckling period. These results demonstrate the advantage of milk replacer on weaning weight. Litter homogeneity, piglet mortality and back-fat thickness of the sows were affected by providing milk replacer to the piglets during the suckling period...|$|R

40|$|Three {{models on}} {{estimates}} of variance components and fixed effects on weaning weight of slow growing rabbits population were compared. Measures on weaning weight (W-weight) from 86 progeny of 4 bucks mated with 12 does (3 dams/buck) were collected and sex (Sex), number of progeny weaned (N-weaned), Parity and <b>age</b> <b>at</b> <b>weaning</b> (W-age) were registered. Variance components of W-weight concerned buck-, doe-, error-, phenotipic-, additive genetic-, maternal-, and environmental- variance. Buck- and doe- random components were estimated by REML (REstricted Maximum Likelihood) in a nested design. Analysis {{was carried out}} by use of three different mixed models in which (fixed) effects of Sex, number of progeny weaned (N-weaned), Parity and <b>age</b> <b>at</b> <b>weaning</b> (W-age) were considered. In model- 1 Sex and Parity were concerned as class variables and W-age as a covariate. In model- 2 Sex and N-weaned were concerned as class variables and W-age as a covariate. In model- 3 Sex was concerned as a class variable and N-weaned and W-age as covariates. In all models Sex do not showed significant differences. Parity and W-age denoted significant influences in model- 1. N-weaned was found significant as a class variable (model- 2) and as a covariate (model- 3). Heritability (h 2) estimates were: model- 1 = 0. 31, model- 2 = 0. 65 and model- 3 > 1. 00, respectively. Sex does not influence W-weight.

40|$|There {{are many}} inputs into the dairy {{replacement}} herd which impact {{not only on}} the cost of rearing heifers from birth to first calving, but also on their future longevity and production potential. This study determined the current cost of rearing dairy heifers in the UK through the calculation and analysis of individual costs on a subset of 102 UK dairy farms. Each farm was visited and an extensive heifer rearing questionnaire was completed. Current heifer rearing practices were recorded to provide insight into critical management decisions. A cost analysis workbook was developed to calculate the costs of inputs in the pre-weaning period for labour, calving, feed, housing, health treatments and vaccinations, waste storage, machinery and equipment, and utilities. The average <b>age</b> <b>at</b> <b>weaning</b> was 62 d. The mean cost of rearing from birth to weaning was £ 195. 19 per heifer with a mean daily cost of £ 3. 14 (excluding the opportunity cost of the calf). This ranged from £ 1. 68 to £ 6. 11 among farms, reflecting major differences in management strategies and efficiency. The highest contribution to total costs came from feed (colostrum, milk, starter and forage) at 48. 5 % with milk feeding making up the greatest proportion of this at 37. 3 %. The next major expenses were bedding and labour, contributing 12. 3 % and 11. 2 % respectively. Unsurprisingly, delaying <b>age</b> <b>at</b> <b>weaning</b> increased total cost by £ 3. 53 per day. Total costs were on average 45 % higher on organic farms than conventional due to higher feed costs and later weaning. Calving pattern also had a strong association with the total cost being lowest with spring calving, intermediate with autumn calving and highest in multi block and all year round calving herds. fals...|$|E
