5|$|Australia {{proceeded}} to the 1953 Ashes tour. During a stopover at Naples, Miller was locked inside after entering a private opera rehearsal without authorisation, {{but managed to}} escape and rejoin the boat as {{it was about to}} leave. During his career, several cricket books were published under Miller's name, and he was embroiled in further controversy when one ghost-written tome, which was printed as the team left for England, criticised his captain Hassett <b>as</b> <b>being</b> <b>too</b> cautious.|$|E
5|$|In the event, the {{north-western}} corner was leased to the Bank of England and Norwich Union Insurance (whose offices {{now stand}} derelict), {{and the critical}} corner site where the Dutch House had stood {{was replaced by a}} link road to a short section of dual-carriageway linking High Street with Wine Street. Plans for a civic centre were dropped <b>as</b> <b>being</b> <b>too</b> expensive.|$|E

5|$|On June 7, 1911, Madero entered Mexico City. In October 1911 he {{was elected}} president, {{under the banner of}} the Partido Constitucional Progresista, along with José María Pino Suárez, his new running mate as vice-president. Madero pushed aside Francisco Vázquez Gómez, the vice presidential {{candidate}} for the Anti-Reelectionist Party in 1910, <b>as</b> <b>being</b> <b>too</b> moderate.|$|E
5|$|The 1880s {{also saw}} the {{beginnings}} of the Asian oil trade. The idea that led to moving Russian oil to the Far East via the Suez Canal was the brainchild of two men: importer Marcus Samuel and shipowner/broker Fred Lane. Prior bids to move oil through the canal had been rejected by the Suez Canal Company <b>as</b> <b>being</b> <b>too</b> risky. Samuel approached the problem a different way: asking the company for the specifications of a tanker it would allow through the canal.|$|E
5|$|According to the Court of Inquiry, 'the prime {{cause of}} this lamentable episode' was the {{responsibility}} of Colonel Martin. Described as a ‘’loner’’ for whom officers had little respect, Martin’s primary fault {{was that he was}} too trusting, to the point of naivety. While he cared for the welfare of his men and saw that their living conditions were improved, he was described <b>as</b> <b>being</b> <b>too</b> much of a ‘’solder’s friend’’, to the point that other British officers found that this attitude and work ethic of Martin’s severely undermined their authority over the sepoys. Over time, that served to erode the respect that the British officers and even the sepoys had for him.|$|E
25|$|In 1903, several {{proposals}} {{were made to}} address the issue, but they were rejected <b>as</b> <b>being</b> impractical, <b>too</b> expensive, or both.|$|R

5|$|Aside from {{painting}} Bảo Đại as {{a sexually}} insatiable glutton, Diệm's campaign also attacked {{the head of}} state's nationalist credentials. They criticised him <b>as</b> <b>being</b> <b>too</b> soft in his dealings with French colonial authorities, and for serving {{as the head of}} state of the Empire of Vietnam, a puppet regime set up by Imperial Japan after they invaded during World War II. They also accused him of ceding half the country to the communists. The communists had already captured more than half the country on the battlefield, and Diệm claimed he had no choice, but Diệm's campaign portrayed him as incompetent and unwilling to take the blame.|$|E
5|$|Cannibal {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. However, a common complaint amongst critics was the overuse of Auto-Tune, while the album's production was generally highlighted. The album's lyrics generally polarized music critics; some praised her boldness, while others criticized them <b>as</b> <b>being</b> <b>too</b> raunchy. In the United States, the EP reached {{a peak of}} fifteen selling 74,000 copies in its first week of release. In Canada, the album achieved similar success reaching a peak of fourteen on the chart. Cannibal was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipment of 500,000 copies.|$|E
5|$|Drosera anglica {{was first}} {{described}} by William Hudson in 1778. It has frequently been {{confused with the}} other circumpolar long-leaf Drosera, D. intermedia. This confusion was fueled by the resurfacing of an older name, D. longifolia (described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753), which was regarded <b>as</b> <b>being</b> <b>too</b> ambiguous in description and had been applied to specimens of both D. anglica and D. intermedia. Herbarium specimens were also a mix of the two species. These points led Martin Cheek to propose D. longifolia for rejection as a species name in 1998. The proposal was accepted and the taxon listed as rejected in 1999.|$|E
50|$|Then in 1968, {{this was}} {{regarded}} <b>as</b> <b>being</b> much <b>too</b> plain {{and the old}} badge was re-introduced because of the tradition and meaning attached to it.|$|R
50|$|The {{judgment}} {{has been}} criticised by academics <b>as</b> potentially <b>being</b> <b>too</b> {{close to a}} medical model of disability (although {{it does not require}} medical diagnosis of a disability), rather than the social model of disability.|$|R
6000|$|... {13} Since {{this was}} written, the answer has become definitely--No; we having {{surrendered}} {{the field of}} Arctic discovery to the Continental nations, <b>as</b> <b>being</b> ourselves <b>too</b> poor to pay for ships.|$|R
5|$|In August 2011, the Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel (WGEEP) {{designated}} the entire Western Ghats as an Ecologically Sensitive Area (ESA) and assigned {{three levels of}} Ecological Sensitivity to its different regions. The Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel, headed by ecologist Madhav Gadgil, was a committee appointed by the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests to assess the biodiversity and environmental issues of the Western Ghats. Gadgil Committee and its successor Kasturirangan Committee recommended suggestions to protect the Western Ghats. Gadgil report was criticized <b>as</b> <b>being</b> <b>too</b> environment-friendly and Kasturirangan report was labelled as being anti-environmental.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these first-person accounts, she also incorporates court reports and testimony in her research. Szalavitz highlights controversial practices used by these tough love teen industry programs which the Geneva Convention banned <b>as</b> <b>being</b> <b>too</b> extreme for prisoners of war. She states {{that there is no}} evidence that any of the programs are effective. Portions of the book are addressed to parents and provide resources and advice on how to select better choices instead of programs in the tough love teen industry, and the book includes an appendix aimed at educating parents on how to find help for their teenagers.|$|E
5|$|Opening of {{the first}} Federal Parliament, 9 May – The date 9 May is also {{sometimes}} suggested, the date on which the first Federal Parliament was opened in Melbourne in 1901, {{the date of the}} opening of the Provisional Parliament House in Canberra in 1927, and the date of the opening of the New Parliament House in 1988. The date has, at various times, found support from former Queensland Premier Peter Beattie, Tony Beddison, and Geoffrey Blainey. However, the date has been seen by some <b>as</b> <b>being</b> <b>too</b> closely connected with Victoria, and its location close to the start of winter has been described as an impediment.|$|E
50|$|The fundamentalists saw the Evangelicals <b>as</b> often <b>being</b> <b>too</b> {{concerned}} about social acceptance and intellectual respectability, and <b>being</b> <b>too</b> accommodating to a perverse generation that needed correction. In addition, {{they saw the}} efforts of evangelist Billy Graham, who worked with non-Evangelical denominations, such as the Roman Catholics (which they claimed to be heretical), as a mistake.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{joined him}} at once; {{the people of}} the house, <b>as</b> before, <b>being</b> <b>too</b> much absorbed in their eating and {{drinking}} to notice anything else. 'We mustn't be seen together here,' I whispered. 'I must go on first, and you must follow me.' ...|$|R

5|$|The 75-minute film premiered at the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival {{before its}} {{television}} premiere on Animal Planet on May 25, 2008. While it was praised for its cinematography, {{for maintaining the}} depth of coverage of the television series, and for its accessibility to newcomers to the series, it was criticized for not offering anything new to fans. The Kalahari Meerkat Project noted that the film was not completely accurate but praised it overall and recommended against analyzing it. Several reviewers praised Goldberg's narration, but the script was criticized <b>as</b> <b>being</b> <b>too</b> simplistic for adult viewers.|$|E
5|$|The film, {{released}} on 8 September 2010 during the Eid ul-Fitr holiday, {{was meant to}} show different views of Islam; however, {{it has also been}} interpreted as a critique of the current Muhammadiyah leadership. It was seen in theatres by over 1 million people– the only Indonesian film of 2010 to do so. It also received favourable critical reception, winning the 2011 Bandung Film Festival after being refused a nomination at the 2010 Indonesian Film Festival. However, some Muslim critics decried it <b>as</b> <b>being</b> <b>too</b> liberal.|$|E
5|$|Through {{coordination}} with Betances and local pro-independence leaders in Puerto Rico, a Dominican military leader, Gen. José Morales, {{made plans to}} invade Puerto Rico in the late 1890s, to supply local revolutionaries with supplies and mercenaries, {{and take advantage of}} the weak Spanish military presence in Puerto Rico (there were only 4,500 Spanish soldiers in the island at the time, and 1,000 of them were later redirected to Cuba to fight the Cuban insurrection). However, the Cuban Revolutionary Party rejected the plan <b>as</b> <b>being</b> <b>too</b> expensive.|$|E
5000|$|The bill {{received}} considerable multi-partisan opposition {{within the}} Senate, {{where it was}} criticized <b>as</b> <b>being</b> drafted <b>too</b> quickly, and <b>being</b> <b>too</b> restrictive compared with the Supreme Court decision. [...] As a result, the Senate {{made a series of}} amendments to the bill. The House of Commons accepted all of the amendments made by the Senate except one, which removed the requirement that death be [...] "reasonably foreseeable." ...|$|R
50|$|Høeg resurfaced in 2006 with The Quiet Girl, {{his first}} novel in 10 years. At {{the time of its}} publication, {{reception}} in Denmark was mixed at best, and the novel was generally disregarded <b>as</b> <b>being</b> either <b>too</b> complex or too postmodern.|$|R

5|$|Prior to her infestation, Kerrigan is {{described}} as being a graceful and deadly woman, exceedingly agile and athletic, possessing jade-green eyes and brilliant red hair usually worn as a ponytail. The novel Queen of Blades describes her facial features <b>as</b> <b>being</b> <b>too</b> strong to be classified as beautiful, but instead as striking and completely fitting for her personality. Kerrigan is rarely seen out of her armor, a form-fitting hostile environment suit specifically designed for Ghost operatives and equipped with a personal cloaking device, but when off-duty, she {{is described}} as wearing a soft work shirt, worn cotton pants with a dusty leather jacket, and high leather boots. Even then, it is uncommon for Kerrigan to be unarmed: she is always equipped {{with at least a}} combat knife.|$|E
5|$|Running {{parallel}} {{development with}} Fuse, and beginning began {{soon after the}} completion of Resistance 3, Insomniac Games began development of Sunset Overdrive. The game was inspired by Hyena Men of Kenya, Tank Girl, I Am Legend, The Young One, Halloween masks from the 1960s, and Lego. Sunset Overdrive was created by Marcus Smith and Drew Murray; their first pitch to Insomniac's head was rejected <b>as</b> <b>being</b> <b>too</b> confusing. They were given one week to re-pitch the title, and they persuaded studio heads to begin the game's development. The game was later pitched to various publishers, which rejected them because Insomniac demanded to retain ownership of the IP. The project was later pitched to Microsoft Studios, which was eager to work with Insomniac. Microsoft allowed Insomniac to own the rights to the game. Sunset Overdrive was made exclusive to Microsoft's Xbox One console; it was released on the 20th anniversary of Insomniac, in 2014.|$|E
5|$|The idea of {{locating}} Project Y {{with the}} Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago, {{or at the}} Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, was considered, {{but in the end}} it was decided that a remote location would be best. A site in the vicinity of Los Angeles was rejected on security grounds, and one near Reno, Nevada <b>as</b> <b>being</b> <b>too</b> inaccessible. On Oppenheimer's recommendation, the search was narrowed to the vicinity of Albuquerque, New Mexico, where Oppenheimer owned a ranch in the Sangre de Cristo Range. The climate was mild, there were air and rail connections to Albuquerque, it was sufficiently distant from the West Coast of the United States for a Japanese attack not to be an issue, and the population density was low.|$|E
50|$|The {{concept of}} The Neighbors was devised by Fogelman, who {{previously}} wrote the films Cars, Cars 2 and Tangled. Although it is a comedy series, its script was cited <b>as</b> potentially <b>being</b> <b>too</b> complex for mainstream American television. Fogelman cenceived The Neighbors {{after a visit}} to his mother's gated community.|$|R
5000|$|There {{is such a}} thing <b>as</b> a man <b>being</b> <b>too</b> {{proud to}} fight. There {{is such a thing}} <b>as</b> a nation <b>being</b> so right that it does not need to {{convince}} others by force that it is right.|$|R
60|$|The {{manners of}} Count von Hern were universally quoted <b>as</b> <b>being</b> almost <b>too</b> perfect. It is a regrettable fact, however, {{that at that}} moment he swore--softly, perhaps, but with {{distinct}} vehemence. A moment later he was exchanging the most cordial of greetings with his old friend.|$|R
