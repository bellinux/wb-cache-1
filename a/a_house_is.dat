5|$|Number 16 is <b>a</b> <b>house</b> <b>is</b> two storey building, roughly {{square in}} plan, with painted {{limestone}} {{walls and a}} corrugated sheet metal roof behind a parapet. It accommodated first the superintendent, later on the resident magistrate, and remained in-use as housing for prison officers until the 1970s. Number 18, {{also known as the}} Surgeon's House, is a two storey structure with limestone walls. It is the southernmost house on The Terrace. Numbers 18 and 8, the northernmost of the initial buildings, both featured two sitting rooms, three bedrooms, and two dressing rooms, as well as a kitchen, water closet and shed, but with mirrored layouts. Number 18 was expanded with additions built in the 1890s. A single storey limestone structure (former stables) is located to the south of Number 18.|$|E
5|$|The eldest generational Avatar within <b>a</b> <b>House</b> <b>is</b> {{dominant}} {{and called the}} Prophet. He possesses blue blood, also called Vitae Divina. The next in line is the Ascendant Prince. Any additional Avatara within the House are Princes ranked by generation. Although Avatara form blood dynasties from father to son, House affiliations can be mixed within a dynasty. If the youngest Prince in a dynasty dies, the dynasty is ended. Most dynasties only last on average three generations, since typical Avatara can be killed by any means. When a dynasty ends, the first male child born {{elsewhere in the world}} with the most Avataric blood will be a new Prince starting a new dynasty.|$|E
5|$|The {{modern art}} {{movement}} in the country officially emerged in the 1950s, culminating {{in the establishment of}} an art society. Expressionism and surrealism, as well as calligraphic art are the popular forms of art in the country. Abstract expressionism has gained popularity in recent decades. Pottery-making and textile weaving are also popular products that were widely made in Bahraini villages. Arabic calligraphy grew in popularity as the Bahraini government was an active patron in Islamic art, culminating in the establishment of an Islamic museum, Beit Al Quran. The Bahrain national museum houses a permanent contemporary art exhibition. The architecture of Bahrain {{is similar to that of}} its neighbours in the Persian Gulf.

5|$|The {{player can}} protect their vault {{in a number}} of ways, such as {{building}} walls, keeping guard dogs, setting up traps such as electrified floors and bottomless pits, and giving guns to the player's family members so that they can defend the vault as well. The game does not punish the player for family members—by default, a wife and two children—being murdered by intruders; the player can even view footage of the incident afterwards. Rather, protecting the money is the goal the game emphasizes. The player starts off with $2,000 in cash and steals more from others' vaults; {{it can be used to}} purchase more objects to defend one's own vault. Additionally, <b>a</b> <b>house</b> <b>is</b> not accessible by thieves when its owner is retooling it for defense.|$|E

25|$|The wolf was the {{template}} of numerous Ancient Egyptian deities, including Anubis, Wepwawet and Duamutef. According to Diodorus Siculus, the Egyptian city of Lykopolis was named {{in honour of}} a pack of wolves that repelled an Ethiopian invasion. Arab Egyptian folklore holds that the wolf can cause chickens to faint from fear by simply passing underneath their roosts, and associates its body parts with various forms of folk magic: placing a wolf's tongue in <b>a</b> <b>house</b> <b>is</b> believed to cause the inhabitants to argue, and its meat {{is thought to be}} useful in treating insanity and epilepsy. Its heart is believed to protect the bearer from wild animal attacks, while its eye can protect against the evil eye.|$|E
25|$|Aristotle {{examines}} {{the concepts of}} substance and essence (ousia) in his Metaphysics (Book VII), and he concludes that a particular substance {{is a combination of}} both matter and form. In Book VIII, he distinguishes the matter of the substance as the substratum, or the stuff of which it is composed. For example, the matter of <b>a</b> <b>house</b> <b>is</b> the bricks, stones, timbers etc., or whatever constitutes the potential house, while the form of the substance is the actual house, namely 'covering for bodies and chattels' or any other differentia (see also predicables) that let us define something as a house. The formula that gives the components is the account of the matter, and the formula that gives the differentia is the account of the form.|$|E

25|$|The {{layout and}} {{function}} of the house compound of Bali Aga people is very different with the low Balinese house compound. The first differences is that each building in a house compound are not functionally differentiated. In lowland Balinese, each house (a pavilion or bale) has a specific function, e.g. bale meten is a pavilion for sleeping and paon is a pavilion for cooking. In Bali Aga house compound, each house is a self-contained entity where the sleeping area, kitchen, and all the functions of <b>a</b> <b>house</b> <b>is</b> situated. Unlike the lowland Balinese, where only certain people can use a certain pavilion (e.g. House Meten is only for {{the head of the}} household), each Bali Aga house is home to a married couple, their children, and sometimes a dependent elderly parent. A family unit in Bali Aga is known as kuren; kuren is a Bali Aga term for both a hearth and for {{a group of people who}} share the food cooked upon it.|$|E

With the exceptions of School House and Ellerslie House, the eleven houses at Malvern are named with numbers 1 to 9, a system which used to be used at Roedean School, a girls' school founded by the sisters of the Old Malvernian judge Sir Paul Ogden Lawrence.

500|$|The Court voted 8-1 {{to reverse}} the Illinois Appellate Court to hold {{the actions of the}} police {{officers}} at question constitutional. Justice Breyer wrote the majority opinion which upheld the search. Due to the specific circumstances of the case, the police needed to prevent the investigation scene from being contaminated. Breyer wrote that the Court found [...] "no case in which [...] held unlawful a temporary seizure that was supported by probable cause and was designed to prevent the loss of evidence while the police diligently obtained a warrant in a reasonable period of time." [...] Moreover, McArthur's argument that his decision to remain on his porch and not allow the police entry did not amount to [...] "a constructive eviction". Instead, Breyer noted that the Court found in a prior case that the doorway of <b>a</b> <b>house</b> <b>is</b> in a 'public place' and thus not subject to warrant rules. He noted in conclusion that the hard-to-contest fact of probable cause made it difficult to accept McArthur's claims.|$|E
