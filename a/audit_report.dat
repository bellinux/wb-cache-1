5|$|A new £15million {{leisure centre}} on the town's Esplanade {{opened its doors}} in September 2013. This has {{replaced}} the old Kirkcaldy Swimming Pool from the 1970s. The decision {{to build a new}} leisure centre on this site was controversial, as it resulted in the loss of a public car park. A petition organised by the campaign group Save The Car Park collected over 7,000 signatures in favour of keeping the car park open. The group said that the closure of the car park would discourage shoppers from coming to the High Street and raised issues over the loss of shopowners' right of access to the car park. This decision was severely criticised in an internal <b>audit</b> <b>report.</b>|$|E

40|$|<b>Audit</b> <b>reporting</b> lag is {{the single}} most {{important}} determinant influencing the timeliness of the release of financial statements. In this study, we first explore the determinants of <b>audit</b> <b>reporting</b> lags in China where the audit market for listed firms is dominated by non-Big 4 auditors. We then examine the implications of long <b>audit</b> <b>reporting</b> lags in subsequent years. We find that selected measures of audit risk and complexity, and auditor expertise are all associated with the length of <b>audit</b> <b>reporting</b> lags in China. Firms with long <b>audit</b> <b>reporting</b> lags are more likely to have the receipt of non-standard opinions in subsequent periods. There is also evidence that firms with extremely long <b>audit</b> <b>reporting</b> lags tend to have more restatements in the subsequent year. As prior research has not specifically investigated the consequences of long <b>audit</b> <b>reporting</b> lags in subsequent years, this study makes an important contribution to the literature in this area...|$|R

40|$|The {{independent}} auditors periodically publish {{reports that}} summarize the <b>audit</b> results. These <b>reports</b> reinforce the financial communication {{and reliability of}} accounting information. International Standards on Auditing (ISA) determine the content of <b>audit</b> <b>reports</b> {{and the quality of}} audit results. Theoretically, the audit standardization must model intelligible and clear reports for readers. Compliance with linguistic principles contributes to the improvement of the structure of <b>audit</b> <b>reports.</b> In practice, the effectiveness of these reports is criticized because users do not understand the audit information. In order to improve the content of <b>audit</b> <b>reports,</b> International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) had revised International Standards on Auditor’s report: ISA 700 : Forming an opinion and reporting on financial statements. Linguistically, standardized <b>audit</b> <b>reports</b> could be unreadable by many users of financial statements.

[...] The <b>audit</b> <b>report,</b> issued in March 2000 (herein, the [...] "OIG 2000 report"), concluded that HUD had been allowing the organizations to operate their programs {{in a way that}} circumvented FHA requirements. [...] The stated rationale for this conclusion was the OIG's finding that the assistance was not a [...] "true gift", because the nonprofit organization was being reimbursed by the seller. [...] The OIG also presented evidence that (i) the default rate for persons receiving the assistance was [...] "significantly higher" [...] than the average default rate for other FHA insured loans and (ii) some sellers were raising the sales price of their properties {{to cover the cost of}} the assistance, thus requiring the homebuyers to finance higher loan amounts. [...] Nehemiah had been given access to a draft version of the report, along with an opportunity to comment and respond. [...] In its response, Nehemiah noted that its program did comply with FHA requirements (as determined by HUD).
