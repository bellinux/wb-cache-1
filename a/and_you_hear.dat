No living person possesses a tithe of his information respecting the Hudson's Bay countries... Never mind his Bunyan-like face and cropped hair; {{he has a very}} powerful mind, and a singular faculty of picture-making. He can create a wilderness and people it with warring savages, or climb the Rocky Mountains with you in a snow-storm, so clearly and palpably, that only shut your eyes <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> the crack of the rifle, or feel the snow-flakes melt on your cheeks as he talks.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 2010s, Taborn {{continued}} playing and recording with others, but also had more solo concerts than {{earlier in his}} career. He had a solo tour of Europe in 2010, which {{may have led to}} an agreement with ECM to record his first solo piano album, Avenging Angel, which was released in 2011. In critic Nate Chinen's view, this album concentrated on [...] "pure sound", being [...] "full of moments where a note hangs sharply in the air, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> the gathering overtones, the vibrations of the strings". The album helped Taborn get more attention as a leader.|$|E
500|$|While {{establishing}} {{herself as}} an artist and working her way up through the New York underground club scene, Gaga released her debut studio album, The Fame. Speaking about the title and concept of the album, Gaga explained: [...] "The Fame is about how anyone can feel famous. [...] Pop culture is art. It doesn't make you cool to hate pop culture, so I embraced it <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> it all over The Fame. But, it's a sharable fame. I want to invite you all to the party. I want people to feel a part of this lifestyle." [...] Gaga stated in an interview with MTV UK that she had been working on the album {{for two and a half}} years and completed half of it during the first week of January 2008. As well as writing the lyrics, Gaga worked on the melodies and synth work of the album, with record producer RedOne. According to Gaga, the first track [...] "Just Dance" [...] is a joyous, heart-themed song, which appeals to people going through tough times in their life. [...] "LoveGame", the second track, was inspired by Gaga's sexual crush on a stranger in a night club to whom she said, [...] "I wanna ride on your disco stick". It was written in four minutes based on the disco stick hook. [...] "Paparazzi" [...] has been interpreted with different meanings. However Gaga explained in an interview with About.com, that the song was inspired by her struggles and hunger for fame and love. Essentially a love song, [...] "Paparazzi" [...] dealt with enticing the media and asked the question, whether one can have both fame and love.|$|E

500|$|The Rockstar team {{wanted to}} synergise the game world's {{depiction}} of California {{with the radio}} stations by licensing tracks that imparted an appropriate [...] "Cali feel". Pavlovich noted that Los Angeles' cultural saturation of pop music necessitated the Non-Stop-Pop FM station; he said that [...] "the first time you get off an airplane in L.A. <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> the radio and the pop just seeps out...We wanted that. It really connects you to the world". He felt that greater discernment was required for licensed music choices than in Grand Theft Auto IV because Grand Theft Auto Vs music plays {{a pivotal role in}} generating Californian atmosphere. Music [...] "reflects the environment in which the game is set", he said. Initially, the team planned to license over 900 tracks for the radio but they refined the number to 241. The tracks are shared between fifteen stations, with an additional two talk-back stations and a radio station for custom audio files on the PC version. Some tracks were written specifically for the game, such as rapper and producer Flying Lotus' original work composed for the FlyLo FM station he hosts. Pavlovich noted how the team would first develop an idea of what each station would sound like, and then select a DJ to match the station’s genre, such as Kenny Loggins who hosts the classic rock station Los Santos Rock Radio. He felt that {{to strike a balance between}} the radio and the score was a meticulous process, and cited a scenario where players would drive to a mission objective while listening to the radio, with the score taking over once players left the vehicle and proceeded to the mission's next stage.|$|E
2500|$|In 2003 {{prosecutors}} {{entered a}} motion to join the Samsoe charges {{with those of the}} four newly discovered victims. Alcala's attorneys contested it; as one of them explained, [...] "If you're a juror <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> one murder case, {{you may be able to}} have reasonable doubt. But it's very hard to say you have reasonable doubt on all five, especially when four of the five aren't alleged by eyewitnesses but are proven by DNA matches." [...] In 2006, the California Supreme Court ruled in the prosecution's favor, and in February 2010 Alcala stood trial on the five joined charges.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{introduction}} for his 1985 short story collection Eye, author Herbert discussed the film's reception and {{his participation in}} the production, complimented Lynch, and listed scenes that were shot but {{left out of the}} released version. He wrote, [...] "I enjoyed the film even as a cut and I told it as I saw it: What reached the screen is a visual feast that begins as Dune begins <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> my dialogue all through it." [...] Herbert also commented, [...] "I have my quibbles about the film, of course. Paul was a man playing god, not a god who could make it rain." ...|$|E

2500|$|Wendy Leigh, {{who wrote}} an {{unofficial}} biography on Schwarzenegger, claims he plotted his political rise {{from an early}} age using the movie business and bodybuilding as building blocks to escape a depressing home. Leigh portrays Schwarzenegger as obsessed with power and quotes him as saying, [...] "I {{wanted to be part of}} the small percentage of people who were leaders, not the large mass of followers. I think it is because I saw leaders use 100% of their potential– I was always fascinated by people in control of other people." [...] Schwarzenegger has said that it was never his intention to enter politics, but he says, [...] "I married into a political family. You get together with them <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> about policy, about reaching out to help people. I was exposed to the idea of being a public servant and Eunice and Sargent Shriver became my heroes." [...] Eunice Kennedy Shriver was sister of John F. Kennedy, and mother-in-law to Schwarzenegger; Sargent Shriver is husband to Eunice and father-in-law to Schwarzenegger.|$|E
2500|$|Later {{that same}} season, the Green Hornet and Kato {{appeared}} in the two-part second-season episodes A Piece of the Action and Batman's Satisfaction, which aired on March 1–2, 1967. In the two episodes, the Green Hornet and Kato are in Gotham City to bust a counterfeit stamp ring run by Colonel Gumm (portrayed by Roger C. Carmel). The Batman's Satisfaction episode leads to a mixed fight, with both Batman & Robin and The Green Hornet & Kato fighting Colonel Gumm and his gang. Once Gumm's crew was defeated, Batman and Robin squared off against The Green Hornet and Kato, resulting in a stand-off that was interrupted by the police. In this episode, Batman, Robin and the police consider the Green Hornet and Kato to be criminals, although Batman and Robin were cordial to the duo in the earlier window appearance. There is also a mention of The Green Hornet TV series on the Batman TV series episode The Impractical Joker (episode 55, Part 1, aired November 16, 1966): while watching TV together, Alfred, Dick Grayson and Bruce Wayne (who says, [...] "It's time to watch The Green Hornet", <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> the Hornet buzzing sound) are interrupted by the Joker; then, after the interruption, The Green Hornet TV series theme music is heard.|$|E
