5|$|Despite his {{commitment}} to discipline the army and serve the Republic which attracted the <b>admiration</b> <b>of</b> people, his temper caused some to abhor him. His efforts were not without recognition during his time, for {{he was awarded the}} Philippine Republic Medal in 1899. He was {{also a member of the}} Malolos Congress. Besides his military studies, Luna also studied pharmacy, literature and chemistry.|$|E

5|$|I believe few plays {{have ever}} adventured {{into the world}} under greater {{disadvantage}} than this. First, as it succeeded a comedy which, for the continued space of twenty-eight nights, received as great (and as just) applauses, as ever were bestowed on the English Theatre. And secondly, as it is co-temporary with an entertainment which engrosses the whole talk and <b>admiration</b> <b>of</b> the town.|$|E
5|$|Lucas is {{an admirer}} of English poet and painter William Blake; Elizabeta reveals that Lucas' <b>admiration</b> <b>of</b> Blake is based on their common {{distrust}} of systems. Lucas decorates his flat with some of Blake's paintings, and has a chest tattoo resembling The Ancient of Days, one of Blake's watercolour paintings. Though no longer married to Elizabeta, he maintains strong feelings towards her throughout {{the first half of}} series seven.|$|E
5|$|Noting Daniels' <b>admiration</b> <b>of</b> {{the work}} of John Waters and Pedro Almodóvar and the joking {{attitude}} he and the actors sometimes took towards their material while making the movie, Jim Emerson argued that Precious is best understood as a deliberately over-the-top piece of camp in the vein of Waters's Female Trouble.|$|E

5|$|The Primary Chronicle {{attributed}} to Nestor the Chronicler is another sources giving {{a detailed account}} of events, its reliability being variable, depending event-by-event on the sources from which it was compiled. Nestor's writing reflects the typical Rus' <b>admiration</b> <b>of</b> Saint Vladimir, while Bishop Thietmar's account, despite a generally positive attitude towards the Rus', paints both Bolesław and Vladimir exclusively in a negative light.|$|E
5|$|Broder Lysholm Knudtzon (5 October 178820 March 1864) was a Norwegian merchant, {{politician}} and benefactor. Born {{into one of}} Trondheim's wealthiest mercantile families, he travelled to England where he developed a great <b>admiration</b> <b>of</b> English language and literature. Despite his commercial background he was more drawn towards the fields of politics, culture and art. He nevertheless administrated his father's family firm, acting as foreign correspondent with {{little interest in the}} everyday business. In England he befriended Lord Byron and came {{under the influence of the}} English national liberal movement. Prior to his death, he bequeathed his entire library and several artworks to the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters.|$|E
5|$|In January 1950, the New York Zoological Society held {{a celebration}} {{to commemorate the}} 50th anniversary of Beebe's work for them. He was by this point the only {{remaining}} member of the zoo's original staff, and had produced more scholarly papers and publicity than any other employee. Letters and testimonials poured in from other scientists with whom Beebe had worked, attesting to their <b>admiration</b> <b>of</b> him and his influence on them. One letter from the Harvard biologist Ernst Mayr wrote that Beebe's work had been an inspiration to his own, particularly A Monograph of the Pheasants and Beebe's books about jungle wildlife.|$|E

60|$|Mr. McCall {{read this}} epic through, {{then he looked}} at his son. He first looked at him over his glasses, then through his glasses, then over his glasses again, then through his glasses once more. A curious {{expression}} was in his eyes.

5|$|Like most Austrian generals of the French Revolutionary Wars, {{he joined}} the {{military}} as a young man, and served in the War of Bavarian Succession, in which he took part in its first action by successfully repelling a Prussian border raid, which earned him the <b>admiration</b> <b>of</b> the Empress Maria Theresa's son, Joseph. His continued success in the Habsburg border wars with the Ottoman Empire added to {{his reputation as a}} commander.|$|E
5|$|Parents of {{children}} with ASD {{have higher levels of}} stress.

However, they reported lower levels of closeness and intimacy than siblings of children with Down syndrome; siblings of individuals with ASD have greater risk of negative well-being and poorer sibling relationships as adults.|$|E
5|$|Richard H. Fallon {{reviewed}} {{the book for}} Harvard Magazine, and characterized Freedom for the Thought That We Hate as a clear and captivating background education to U.S. freedom of speech legislation. Fallon praised the author's ability to weave descriptions of historical events into an entertaining account. Robyn Blumner of the St. Petersburg Times wrote that Lewis aptly summarized {{the development of the}} U.S. Constitution's protections of freedom of speech and of the press. She observed that the book forcefully presented the author's <b>admiration</b> <b>of</b> brave judges who had helped to develop interpretation of the U.S. Constitution's protections of the rights of freedom of expression as a defense against censorship.|$|E

It was one <b>of</b> those reciprocal <b>admirations</b> <b>of</b> a big man for a little man.

5|$|Suspicious, Skinner {{learns that}} Linguini is Gusteau's illegitimate {{son and the}} {{rightful}} heir to the restaurant, which jeopardizes Skinner's control of the restaurant and the lucrative packaged food enterprise he formed using the restaurant's reputation after Gusteau's death. Remy discovers the evidence of Linguini's inheritance and, after eluding Skinner, gives it to Linguini, who deposes Skinner as owner. The restaurant continues to thrive, and Linguini and Colette develop a budding romance, leaving Remy feeling left out. Remy finds that his clan has come to Paris as well, and is taken to their new lair, but despite his father Django's attempts to rid his son of his <b>admiration</b> <b>of</b> humans, Remy leaves.|$|E
5|$|Ti Noel, an {{illiterate}} slave, is a {{protagonist of}} African origin. He {{begins as a}} young slave who, during the unravelling of the novel, travels to Cuba before returning to Haiti. He is twice branded as a slave but now is a free man. Although he grows old, he remains a witness rather than actor and more often reacts to, as opposed to causes, events throughout the novel. He is in <b>admiration</b> <b>of</b> Macandal's qualities prior {{to the loss of}} Macandal's arm; he accompanies Macandal into the mountains and is saddened by his departure.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately Curtis' career stalled as {{more popular}} and {{successful}} officers secured active positions; during the Napoleonic Wars, Curtis was relegated to staff duties ashore {{and did not}} see action. He died in 1816, his baronetcy inherited by his second son Lucius who later became an Admiral of the Fleet. Modern historians have viewed Curtis as an over-cautious officer in a period when dashing, attacking tactics were admired. Contemporary opinion was more divided, with some influential officers expressing <b>admiration</b> <b>of</b> Curtis and others contempt.|$|E

5|$|After his discharge, Robinson briefly {{returned}} to his old football club, the Los Angeles Bulldogs. Robinson then accepted an offer from his old friend and pastor Rev. Karl Downs to be the athletic director at Sam Huston College in Austin, then of the Southwestern Athletic Conference. The job included coaching the school's basketball team for the 1944–45 season. As it was a fledgling program, few students tried out for the basketball team, and Robinson even resorted to inserting himself into the lineup for exhibition games. Although his teams were outmatched by opponents, Robinson was respected as a disciplinarian coach, and drew the <b>admiration</b> <b>of,</b> among others, Langston University basketball player Marques Haynes, a future member of the Harlem Globetrotters.|$|E
5|$|Inheriting an Empire on {{the verge}} of disintegration, PedroII turned Portuguese-speaking Brazil into an {{emerging}} power in the international arena. The nation grew to be distinguished from its Hispanic neighbors on account of its political stability, zealously guarded freedom of speech, respect for civil rights, vibrant economic growth and especially for its form of government: a functional, representative parliamentary monarchy. Brazil was also victorious in three international conflicts (the Platine War, the Uruguayan War and the Paraguayan War) under his rule, as well as prevailing in several other international disputes and domestic tensions. PedroII steadfastly pushed through the abolition of slavery despite opposition from powerful political and economic interests. A savant in his own right, the Emperor established a reputation as a vigorous sponsor of learning, culture and the sciences. He won the respect and <b>admiration</b> <b>of</b> scholars such as Charles Darwin, Victor Hugo and Friedrich Nietzsche, and was a friend to Richard Wagner, Louis Pasteur and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, among others.|$|E
5|$|The {{commander}} of the UNSC warship Spirit of Fire is Captain James Cutter (Gregg Berger), a strong leader who has earned the <b>admiration</b> <b>of</b> his subordinates. Cutter's lack of political ambition prevents him from climbing the ranks further. Serving under Cutter is Sergeant John Forge (Nolan North), a gruff Marine whose devotion to men has caused him to be jailed twice for disobeying orders and engaging in disorderly conduct. Joining the Spirit of Fires military expedition is Professor Ellen Anders (Kim Mai Guest), a scientist interested in ancient ruins of the mysterious Forerunners. The Spirit of Fire is operated with help from Serina (Courtenay Taylor), a super-intelligent artificial intelligence (AI) with a sardonic sense of humor; it has been noted that she demonstrates a level of contempt for the humans she assists. Leading the Covenant search for Forerunner technology is a holy warrior known as the Arbiter (David Sobolov), who the Covenant leaders, the Prophet Hierarchs, have tasked with the oversight of humanity's destruction.|$|E

50|$|An {{important}} aspect for the Carmelitas was to fulfil their vows of chastity, poverty and reflexive prayer. Due {{to the little}} contact they had with the world outside the convent, they were considered hermits. The ones living all alone in the hermitages surrounding the building were worthy <b>of</b> <b>admiration,</b> because <b>of</b> their attitude regarding the search of a greater mission. They lived for the spirit, with only their basic needs, in silence and meditation of nature and themselves.|$|R
