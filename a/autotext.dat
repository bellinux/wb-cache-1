5000|$|In the 1980s Stablein {{began to}} script her written work into {{multimedia}} performance art events. In a 1987 work, AutoText: Poems, Bullhorns, Streets she pioneered {{the use of}} a bullhorn to recite poetry with another poet from the back of a moving vehicle. <b>AutoText</b> also performed in 1987 at An Alternative To Loud Boats. Stablein performed Intrusions in Ice at the 1990 Bumbershoot Literary Arts Fair. In a 1998 work, The Gypsy Procession, Stablein collaborated with fluxus artist Dick Higgins. [...] "Dick appeared as the King of Ties. He had a wonderful crown with ties hanging from it and a coat made of ties," [...] composer Pauline Oliveros wrote about the parade. [...] Artworks from The Gypsy Procession were exhibited in a show curated by the artist Judy Chicago.|$|E

The links are to sites I regularly use in teaching, and the recommended books are available in my university library. Feel free to adapt according to your students' level, needs and available resources. There are different ways you could exploit the comments set: 1. (on paper) as a cover sheet when returning written work. 2. (in Microsoft Word) as the basis for creating <b>AutoText</b> entries, which you can quickly insert into Comments when reviewing electronic copies of your students' work. 3. (in Turnitin) as the basis for creating a QuickMark set in GradeMark. ...|$|E
40|$|Three {{computer}} {{programs have been}} developed to facilitate manure use planning. The Nebraska Manure Value Calculator was developed in Excel to ease the calculation of manure value (www. cnmp. unl. edu) for a specific field giving value to needed nutrients and other expected benefits, and with the option of giving value to manure nutrients used in the more distant future. Nebraska MMPAMUP and MMP-CNMP Document Generators are planning tools for animal feeding operations that work with the Purdue University Manure Management Planner (MMP). Microsoft Word documents are generated which contain some boilerplate text that can be edited, popup lists in Word <b>AutoText</b> to select pre-composed text, and tables created from queries of information obtained from MMP. MMP-CNMP is an adaptation of similar tools developed for Illinois and Ohio and meets Nebraska Title 130 requirements for a nutrient management plan as required in applying for approval of construction or major modification of a livestock waste control facility. MMP-CNMP also gives guidance to other components of the permit application and access to useful forms. MMP-AMUP is a tool to produce an annual manure and fertilizer use plan. It includes guidance to records that need to be maintained...|$|E

Diagnosis of bipolar {{disorder is}} often missed in primary care settings as many patients are incorrectly diagnosed with unipolar depression. The consequences associated with misdiagnosing and mistreating bipolar disorder can be severe. Studies have indicated that it often takes {{as many as three}} different physicians up to ten years from initial presentation for a correct bipolar diagnosis to be made. In 2000, a bipolar disorder screening tool called the Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ) was introduced to help more efficiently diagnosis the disorder. Over the past year we have worked to create an electronic version of the Mood Disorder Questionnaire that can be accessed through the electronic medical record. It is now possible for physicians to guide a patient through the 13 -question screening tool and integrate the results directly into a PowerNote, online electronic documentation, through the institution's new <b>AutoText</b> function. Physicians were educated about the screening tool itself and how to access the MDQ on the electronic medical record through in-person training sessions as well as instructional email and web-based video. Incidence of bipolar diagnosis in the University Health Care System was ascertained prior to and post introduction of the Mood Disorder Questionnaire...|$|E
