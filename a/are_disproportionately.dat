5|$|The {{skeleton}} of the kakapo differs from other parrots in several features associated with flightlessness. Firstly, {{it has the}} smallest relative wing size of any parrot. Its wing feathers are shorter, more rounded, less asymmetrical, and have fewer distal barbules to lock the feathers together. The sternum is small and has a low, vestigial keel and a shortened spina externa. As in other flightless birds and some flighted parrots, the furcula is not fused but consists {{of a pair of}} clavicles lying in contact with each coracoid. As in other flightless birds, the angle between the coracoid and sternum is enlarged. The kakapo has a larger pelvis than other parrots. The proximal bones of the leg and arm <b>are</b> <b>disproportionately</b> long and the distal elements <b>are</b> <b>disproportionately</b> short.|$|E
5|$|Alvin Townley {{wrote in}} Legacy of Honor about the large {{positive}} impact of Eagle Scouts in America. Townley cited such examples as how Scouts, especially Eagle Scouts, were disproportionately represented among Hurricane Katrina's volunteer relief workers; {{just as they}} <b>are</b> <b>disproportionately</b> represented {{among members of the}} United States Senate. Former Governor Rick Perry of Texas is an Eagle Scout who defended BSA policies and restrictions against ACLU criticisms in his book, On My Honor: Why the American Values of the Boy Scouts Are Worth Fighting For.|$|E
5|$|Feminist economists {{join the}} UN {{and others in}} {{acknowledging}} care work, {{as a kind of}} work which includes all tasks involving caregiving, as central to economic development and human well-being. Feminist economists study both paid and unpaid care work. They argue that traditional analysis of economics often ignores the value of household unpaid work. Feminist economists have argued that unpaid domestic work is as valuable as paid work, so measures of economic success should include unpaid work. They have shown that women <b>are</b> <b>disproportionately</b> responsible for performing such care work.|$|E

5|$|The Mikea {{struggle}} {{to ensure the}} quality of life they seek. While the forest has long provided for their basic needs, deforestation and population growth are straining resources. In addition, Mikea are increasingly seeking to obtain better quality material goods for themselves, such as clothing, which necessitates greater engagement with the external economy through trade and wage labor to earn local currency. Lack of access to social services such as education and health clinics are also taking their toll: with only one health clinic in the Mikea Forest area and low access to water for bathing, rates of diseases such as tuberculosis, leprosy and skin disease <b>are</b> <b>disproportionately</b> prevalent.|$|E
5|$|Fishers {{have five}} toes on each foot, with unsheathed, {{retractable}} claws. Their feet <b>are</b> <b>disproportionately</b> large for their legs, {{making it easier}} for them to move on top of snow packs. In addition to the toes, there are four central pads on each foot. On the hind paws there are coarse hairs that grow between the pads and the toes, giving them added traction when walking on a variety of surfaces. Fishers have highly mobile ankle joints that can rotate their hind paws almost 180 degrees, allowing them to maneuver well in trees and climb down head-first. The fisher is one of relatively few mammalian species with the ability to descend trees head-first.|$|E
5|$|Oviri {{has long}} blonde or grey hair {{reaching}} to her knees. Her head and eyes <b>are</b> <b>disproportionately</b> large, she has adolescent breasts, while the aperture {{at the back}} of her head resembles a vaginal orifice. She holds a wolf cub to her hip, a symbol of her indifference and wild power. It is not clear whether Oviri is smothering or hugging the cub, but her pose invokes ideas of sacrifice, infanticide and the archetype of the vengeful mother, influenced by Eug√®ne Delacroix's 1838 painting, Medea About to Kill Her Children. A second animal, likely another wolf, is at her feet either curling in submission or dead. Art historians including Sue Taylor suggest the second animal may represent Gauguin.|$|E

5|$|Terns {{and their}} eggs {{have long been}} eaten by humans and island colonies were raided by sailors on long voyages since the eggs or large chicks were an easily {{obtained}} source of protein. Eggs are still illegally harvested in southern Europe, and adults of wintering birds are taken as food in West Africa and South America. The roseate tern is significantly affected by this hunting, with adult survival 10% lower than would otherwise be expected. In the West Indies, the eggs of roseate and sooty terns {{are believed to be}} aphrodisiacs, and <b>are</b> <b>disproportionately</b> targeted by egg collectors. Tern skins and feathers have long been used for making items of clothing such as capes and hats, and this became a large-scale activity {{in the second half of}} the nineteenth century when it became fashionable to use feathers in hatmaking. This trend started in Europe but soon spread to the Americas and Australia. White was the preferred colour, and sometimes wings or entire birds were used.|$|E
25|$|Lower-class {{families}} <b>are</b> <b>disproportionately</b> made up {{of single}} mother households. According to Kathryn Edin, {{this is because of}} the lack of incentive to marry other lower class men among lower class women, and the desire to save marriage for more quality prospects. Unlike middle class women, lower class women do not have the same financial and marriage incentives to marry especially in the face of likely divorce. As a result, lower class mothers have less incentive to delay their childbearing to later years. Many of the problems shared by single parents <b>are</b> <b>disproportionately</b> felt by the lower class for these very reasons.|$|E

In polarized interphase cells, microtubules <b>are</b> <b>disproportionately</b> oriented from the MTOC toward {{the site of}} polarity, such as {{the leading edge of}} migrating fibroblasts. This configuration is thought to help deliver microtubule-bound vesicles from the Golgi to the site of polarity.|$|E
25|$|Within {{political}} science {{there is a}} growing body of research and analysis on warlordism that has emerged within weak states that have gained independence as a result of the collapse of empire.

25|$|Anti-gay {{groups have}} often argued that more {{homosexual}} men are sexual abusers than heterosexuals, {{on the grounds}} that a third of abusers target boys rather than girls. This is far in excess of the proportion of gay men in the population. It is thus argued that gay men <b>are</b> <b>disproportionately</b> likely to offend.|$|E

25|$|According to {{scholars}} who considered the environmental justice implications {{of climate change}}, the expected impacts of climate change on subsistence farmers in Latin America and other developing regions are unjust for two reasons.
