5|$|David Kaczynski {{had once}} admired and {{emulated}} his older brother, but had later {{decided to leave}} the survivalist lifestyle behind. He had received assurances from the FBI that he would remain anonymous and that his brother would not learn who had turned him in, but his identity was leaked to CBS News in early April 1996. CBS anchorman Dan Rather called FBI director Louis Freeh, who requested 24 hours before CBS broke the story on the evening news. The FBI scrambled to finish the search warrant and have it issued by a federal judge in Montana; afterwards, an internal leak investigation was conducted by the FBI, but the source of the leak was never identified. In 1996 the Evergreen Park Community High School was also placed on lockdown while FBI agents searched Kaczynski's school records. At the end of that school day, students were greeted by reporters asking how they felt <b>about</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> same high school the Unabomber had attended. That night the news story was released to public.|$|E

[...] She muses on leaving her dreams of love behind and joining the man she loves ("Out of My Dreams"), then falls asleep {{under the influence of}} the opiate ("Dream Sequence"). In an extended dream ballet sequence, Laurey first dreams of what marriage to Curly would be like. [...] Her dream takes a nightmarish turn when Jud appears and kills Curly. She cannot escape him, confused by her desires. [...] The dream makes her realize that Curly is the right man for her, but it is too late to change her mind <b>about</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dance with Jud; he has come for her, and they leave for the box social.|$|E

As I said last night after the game, we {{have no control over}} the BCS; {{all we can do is}} go out there and play football. Which we did a good job of 10 times. That's something that they have to deal with and they dealt with it and they did the best they can do with they system. This is just how it is. Our players are really excited about going where we're going." [...] Vice President for ASU Athletics Lisa Love said. [...] "Playing a perennial power like the University of Texas, December 27 in the Holiday Bowl, which, by the way, is wonderfully hosted by that committee. This is a great, step forward.

60|$|He {{perceived}} {{that when he}} came to tell his mother about this journey around the world there would be great difficulties. She would object very strongly, and if that did not do then she would become extremely abusive, compare him to his father, cry bitterly, and banish him suddenly and heartbrokenly from her presence for ever.

Timidity is thought rather a graceful attraction among ladies, but among poor women it is something to be laughed at. A woman with less spirit of her own than I had, and always shall have, would have considered twice in my situation before she made up her mind to encounter the jokes of plowmen and the jeers of milkmaids.
