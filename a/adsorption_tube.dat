40|$|International audienceA field {{experiment}} for {{the comparison of}} the efficiency of canisters and <b>adsorption</b> multibed <b>tubes</b> for sampling atmospheric highly volatile hydrocarbons at ppbv levels is described. The canister was passivated by the Summa process and the <b>adsorption</b> <b>tubes</b> were filled with Carbotrap C, Carbotrap B and Carbosieve S-III.

40|$|Odour {{nuisance}} {{is a major}} {{barrier to}} the further development of livestock production in Denmark and other livestock-dense areas, {{and there is an}} urgent need to develop odour abatement technologies in this field. A first and necessary step is to identify the major odour contributors from livestock production. Three techniques have been chosen for further development: (i) sampling on <b>adsorption</b> <b>tubes</b> with subsequent thermal desorption and analysis by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (TD-GC/MS), (ii) membrane inlet mass spectrometry (MIMS), and (iii) sampling on <b>adsorption</b> <b>tubes</b> with subsequent thermal desorption and separation by gas chromatography whereby the sample stream is split into a mass spectrometer and a sniffing device with two ports (TD-GC/MS/O). The latter two techniques are presented in other papers; this paper will focus on TD-GC/MS. The objective was to develop a robust and cost-effective technique whereby the sampling can be done by a technician after a very brief period of training and the tubes are sent by mail to the laboratories for further analysis.

The prototype evacuated bottles tested are unsatisfactory at their present stage of development for the measurement of both halothane and nitrous oxide concentrations.

40|$|Total organic halogen (TOX) {{is used as}} a {{parameter}} {{to screen}} groundwater samples at the Hanford Site. Trending is done for each groundwater well, and changes in TOX and other screening parameters can lead to costly changes in the monitoring protocol. The Waste Sampling and Characterization Facility (WSCF) analyzes groundwater samples for TOX using the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) SW- 846 method 9020 B (EPA 1996 a). Samples from the Soil and Groundwater Remediation Project (S&GRP) are submitted to the WSCF for analysis without information regarding the source of the sample; each sample is in essence a 'blind' sample to the laboratory. Feedback from the S&GRP indicated that some of the WSCF-generated TOX data from groundwater wells had a number of outlier values based on the historical trends (Anastos 2008 a). Additionally, analysts at WSCF observed inconsistent TOX results among field sample replicates. Therefore, the WSCF lab performed an investigation of the TOX analysis to determine the cause of the outlier data points. Two causes were found that contributed to generating out-of-trend TOX data: (1) The presence of inorganic chloride in the groundwater samples: at inorganic chloride concentrations greater than about 10 parts per million (ppm), apparent TOX values increase with increasing chloride concentration. A parallel observation is the increase in apparent breakthrough of TOX from the first to the second activated-carbon <b>adsorption</b> <b>tubes</b> with increasing inorganic chloride concentration. (2) During the sample preparation step, excessive purging of the <b>adsorption</b> <b>tubes</b> with oxygen pressurization gas after sample loading may cause channeling in the activated-carbon bed. This channeling leads to poor removal of inorganic chloride during the subsequent wash step with aqueous potassium nitrate. The presence of this residual inorganic chloride then produces erroneously high TOX values. Changes in sample preparation were studied to more effectively remove inorganic chloride from the activated carbon <b>adsorption</b> <b>tubes.</b> With the TOX sample preparation equipment and TOX analyzers at WSCF, the nitrate wash recommended by EPA SW- 846 method 9020 B was found to be inadequate to remove inorganic chloride interference. Increasing the nitrate wash concentration from 10 grams per liter (g/L) to 100 g/L potassium nitrate and increasing the nitrate wash volume from 3 milliliters (mL) to 10 mL effectively removed the inorganic chloride up to at least 100 ppm chloride in the sample matrix. Excessive purging of the <b>adsorption</b> <b>tubes</b> during sample preparation was eliminated. These changes in sample preparation have been incorporated in the analytical procedure. The results using the revised sample preparation procedure show better agreement of TOX values both for replicate analyses of single samples and for the analysis of replicate samples acquired from the same groundwater well. Furthermore, less apparent column breakthrough now occurs with the revised procedure. One additional modification made to sample preparation was to discontinue the treatment of groundwater samples with sodium bisulfite. Sodium bisulfite is used to remove inorganic chlorine from the sample; inorganic chlorine is not expected to be a constituent in these groundwater samples. Several other factors were also investigated as possible sources of anomalous TOX results: (1) Instrument instability: examination of the history of results for TOX laboratory control samples and initial calibration verification standards indicate good long-term precision for the method and instrument. Determination of a method detection limit of 2. 3 ppb in a deionized water matrix indicates the method and instrumentation have good stability and repeatability. (2) Non-linear instrument response: the instrument is shown to have good linear response from zero to 200 parts per billion (ppb) TOX. This concentration range encompasses the majority of samples received at WSCF for TOX analysis. (3) Improper sample preservation: ion-chromatographic analysis of several samples with anomalous TOX results revealed that the samples were properly preserved with sulfuric acid and not hydrochloric acid...|$|R

40|$|AbstractGas tracers {{have been}} tested for {{monitoring}} and detecting CO 2 displacement in the underground and eventually leakages to the upper layers in geological storage sites. Commonly used tracers are perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6). In Brazil, we are carrying out gas tracers studies in laboratory for further application in field test facilities. These experiments consist of injecting CO 2 with perfluorocarbon (perfluoropropane – PP and perfluormethylcyclopentane – PMCP) at low pressure (ca. 290 psi) in pressurized vessels with different types of sediments and soil samples. After flowing through the sample pores, the tracer is adsorbed into a capillary <b>adsorption</b> <b>tube</b> (CAT) with a specific fiber for perfluorcabon. Then, the tracer is extracted from the CAT through a Thermal Desorption System and subsequently analyzed in a Gas Chromatograph with an Electron Capture Detector (GC -ECD). The objective of these experiments is to evaluate the PFCs as a monitoring tool, analyzing the tracer retention times in different sediments, as well as understanding the CATs adsorption capacity and performance. After laboratory tests, field experiments will be conducted {{in the course of}} this project. Several experiments of CO 2 injection and controlled leaks will be developed in shallow vertical wells at the project site as a continuity of the experiments started at Ressacada Farm Site (Florianópolis, Brazil).

The PFT diffusion plug source, an elastomer containing a dissolved perfluorocarbon compound, was shown to emit vapors at the rate of about 0. 1 to 5 nL/min, providing steady-state concentrations in a home of about 1 to 10 pL/L, i. e., parts per trillion by volume, when one source is deployed for each 300 - 500 ft ~ (28 - 46 m s) of living space. The emission rate from the diffusion source was predictable, but its dependence on both temperature and time suggested the development of alternative approaches. One such alternative, a liquid PFT permeation source, had emission rates which could be tailored over the range 10 - 20 nL/min, were independent of age for as long as the liquid remained (- 5 yr), and had significantly lower temperature dependence.

The theoretical part of the thesis presents basic information about the organisation, duties and securing the operability of chemical and technical services material equipment. Furthermore, knowledge of possible risks of contamination of material equipment and about inspections of the chemicals in operating environment are presented. In the survey part, air contamination of 13 selected areas is assessed during everyday operations and once in an intentionally contaminated area. As the measuring procedure in all the selected areas, air sampling through <b>adsorption</b> <b>tube</b> with Tenax sorbent was used.

40|$|A perfluorocarbon tracer system (PERTRAS), {{specifically}} designed for Lagrangian aircraft experiments, has been developed by the Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt (German Aerospace Center, DLR). It consists of three main parts: a tracer release unit (RU), an <b>adsorption</b> <b>tube</b> sampler (ATS), and a tracer analytical system. The RU was designed for airborne tracer release experiments; meanwhile, {{it can be used}} on various platforms for different experimental purposes (here research vessel). PERTRAS was for the first time applied in the field campaign Stratospheric ozone: Halogen Impacts in a Varying Atmosphere (SHIVA) in November 2011. An amount of 8. 8 kg perfluoromethylcyclopentane (PMCP) was released aboard the research vessel Sonne (RV Sonne) near the operational site of this campaign, Miri, Malaysia, on 21 November. The tracer samples collected using the ATS onboard the DLR research aircraft Falcon were analyzed in the laboratory using a thermal desorber–gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (TD–GC–MS) system. Guided by forecasts calculated with the Lagrangian model Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT), 64 tracer samples were collected onboard the Falcon approximately 5 and 25 h after the release, mostly with a time resolution of 1 min. Enhanced PMCP concentrations relative to ambient PMCP background values (mean: 6. 62 fmol mol − 1) were detected during three intersects of the fresh tracer plume (age 5 h), with a maximum value of 301. 33 fmol mol − 1. This indicates that the fresh tracer plume was successfully intercepted at the forecast position. During the second flight, 25 h after the release, the center of tracer plume was not detected by the sampling system due to a faster advection of the plume than forecast. The newly developed PERTRAS system has been successfully deployed for the first time.

In case of the one day interval, the result of five to six instant blank heating cycles confirmed successful liberation of mercury following the second and third blank heating cycles. The results of 14 or 45 days generally suggest that liberation of excess mercury is affected by both the initial loading amount and the length of storage time prior to analysis. We have demonstrated a possibly effective way to reduce memory effects. Some similarities of these results with those from CVAFS experiment suggests that the blank response is caused by a combination of mercury absorbed within the bulk gold and micro- and nanoparticles liberated during heating and not from coabsorbing interfering gaseous species...|$|R

The precision of the method is great enough that even the effects of temperature and soil moisture on the soil-air partitioning of very low-volatility compounds can be quantified.

K-SA values of fenpropimorph displayed a negative relationship with temperature and soil moisture. The type of application (spraying or incorporation) and the use of formulated compounds was shown to have a major impact on the measured K-SA values.

40|$|Volatile {{anaesthetics}} and disinfection chemicals pose ubiquitous inhalation and {{dermal exposure}} risks in hospital and clinic environments. This work demonstrates specific non-invasive breath biomonitoring methodology for assessing staff exposures to sevoflurane (SEV) anaesthetic, documenting its metabolite hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) and measuring exposures to isopropanol (IPA) dermal disinfection fluid. Methods {{are based on}} breath sample collection in Nalophan bags, followed by an aliquot transfer to <b>adsorption</b> <b>tube,</b> and subsequent analysis by thermal desorption gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (TD-GC-MS). Ambient levels of IPA were also monitored. These methods could be generalized to other common volatile chemicals found in medical environments. Calibration curves were linear (r 2 = 0. 999) in the investigated ranges: 0. 01 - 1000 ppbv for SEV, 0. 02 - 1700 ppbv for IPA, and 0. 001 - 0. 1 ppbv for HFIP. The instrumental detection limit was 10 pptv for IPA and 5 pptv for SEV, both estimated by extracted ion-TIC chromatograms, whereas the HFIP minimum detectable concentration was 0. 5 pptv as estimated in SIM acquisition mode. The methods were applied to hospital staff working in operating rooms and clinics for blood draws. SEV and HFIP were present in all subjects at concentrations {{in the range of}} 0. 7 - 18, and 0. 002 - 0. 024 ppbv for SEV and HFIP respectively. Correlation between IPA ambient air and breath concentration confirmed the inhalation pathway of exposure (r= 0. 95, p< 0. 001) and breath-borne IPA was measured as high as 1500 ppbv. The methodology is easy to implement and valuable for screening exposures to common hospital chemicals. Although the overall exposures documented were generally below levels of health concern in this limited study, outliers were observed that indicate potential for acute exposures...|$|E
40|$|Rationale: Omalizumab, an anti-IgE {{monoclonal}} antibody, {{is indicated}} in adults with severe persistent allergic asthma. Exhaled molecular markers can provide phenotypic information in asthma. Objectives: Determine whether adults with severe asthma on omalizumab (anti-IgE+) {{have a different}} breathprint compared with {{those who were not}} on anti-IgE therapy (anti-IgE-) as assessed by eNoses and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) (breathomics). Methods: This was a cross-sectional analysis of the U- BIOPRED adult cohort. Severe asthma was defined by IMI-criteria [Bel, Thorax 2011]. Anti-IgE+ patients were on a regular treatment with s. c. omalizumab (150 - 375 mg) every 2 - 4 weeks. Exhaled volatile compounds trapped on <b>adsorption</b> <b>tubes</b> were analysed by a centralized eNose platform (Owlstone Lonestar, two Cyranose 320, Comon Invent, Tor Vergata TEN), including a total of 190 sensors, and GC/MS. Recursive feature elimination ([URL] was used for feature selection and random forests, more robust to overfitting, for classification. Results: 9 anti- IgE+ (females/males 2 / 7, age 52. 6 ± 16. 3 years, mean±SD, 1 / 2 / 6 current/ex/nonsmokers, pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 70. 6 ± 21. 1 % predicted value) and 30 anti-IgE- patients (18 / 12 females/males, age 53. 2 ± 14. 2 years, 0 / 16 / 14 current/ex/nonsmokers, pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 59. 6 ± 30. 7 % predicted value) were studied. Conclusions: Preliminary results suggest that breathomics can distinguish between anti-IgE+ and anti-IgE- severe asthma patients...|$|R
40|$|Ambient air {{monitoring}} {{was conducted}} at Datianshan landfill, Guangzhou, South China in 1998 to investigate the seasonal and horizontal variations of trace volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Twelve sampling points over the Datianshan landfill were selected and samples were collected simultaneously using Carbontrap™ <b>adsorption</b> <b>tubes.</b> Thirty eight VOCs were detected in the winter, whereas 60 were detected in the summer. The VOC levels measured in summer were alkanes, 0. 5 - 6. 5 μg/m 3; aromatics, 2. 3 - 1667 μg/m 3; chlorinated species, 0. 2 - 31 μg/m 3; terpines, 0. 1 - 34 μg/m 3; carbonyl species, 0. 3 - 5. 6 μg/m 3 and naphthalene and its derivatives, 0. 4 - 27 μg/m 3. Compared to the summer samples the VOC levels in winter were much lower (mostly 1 - 2 orders of magnitude lower). The aromatics are dominant VOCs in landfill air both in winter and summer. High levels of alkylbenzene and terpines such as methyl-isopropylbenzene (max 1667 μg/m 3) and limonene (max 162 μg/m 3) cause undesirable odor. The similar correlation coefficients of BTEX in summer and winter suggest VOCs emissions were from landfill site sources. The variation of BTEX ratio at landfill site {{is different from that}} in the urban area of Guangzhou. It shows that the ambient VOCs at landfill site were different from the urban areas.

In {{an effort to reduce}} the experimental bias involved in the analysis of gaseous elemental mercury (Hgo), the blank response from gold-coated <b>adsorption</b> <b>tubes</b> has been investigated using cold vapor atomic absorption spectrometry (CVAAS). Our study has been compared with our recent investigation on memory effect in a cold vapour atomic fluorescence spectrometry (CVAFS). The pattern of blank responses was quantified after loading different amounts of mercury and after different time intervals of 1, 14, and 45 days. In case of the one day interval, the result of five to six instant blank heating cycles confirmed successful liberation of mercury following the second and third blank heating cycles. The results of 14 or 45 days generally suggest that liberation of excess mercury is affected by both the initial loading amount and the length of storage time prior to analysis. We have demonstrated a possibly effective way to reduce memory effects. Some similarities of these results with those fromCVAFS experiment suggests that the blank response is caused by a combination of mercury absorbed within the bulk gold and micro- and nanoparticles liberated during heating and not from coabsorbing interfering gaseous species. 1...|$|R
40|$|During the {{measurement}} campaign performed in August/September 2005 non-methane {{volatile organic compounds}} (NMVOCs) were studied at different locations {{in the city of}} Wroclaw, Poland. The measurements covered NMVOCs in the range of C- 1 to Cu- 10. Samples were collected using Carbotrap and Carbosieve SIII solid <b>adsorption</b> <b>tubes</b> and analysed off-line by thermal desorption and GC-FID analysis. Measurements were performed on purpose to assess the contribution of different emission categories to the observed NMVOC porfile by using chemical mass balance modelling (CMB). Profiles of NMVOCs for traffic emissions were measured in a downtown intersection and during driving through the city. Solvent emission profiles for industrial sources were measured in the vicinity of different factories in Wroclaw. To obtain the ambient NMVOC concentrations sampling was performed at different points located in Wroclaw. The sampling sites represented residential, industrial, mixed settings and an area down-wind from the city centre. The results of the present work show that traffic emissions rather than other sources determine the ambient NMVOC composition in the city. Traffic exhaust contributes approximately 99 % to the NMVOC concentration in the city centre of Wroclaw and down-wind from the city. A significant influence of investigated industrial solvent emissions could only be observed in the close vicinity of the factories, where the contributions of solvent emissions were up to 90 %...|$|R
40|$|CO 2 and {{hydrocarbon}} fluxes from a {{sitka spruce}} forest were measured using a conditional sampling method, The method {{was used in}} two ways: (1) an automated system was used to monitor continuously the mixing ratio difference of total hydrocarbons and CO 2 in sampling lines for updraught and downdraught air and (2) conditionally sampled updraught and downdraught air was passed through <b>adsorption</b> <b>tubes,</b> which subsequently were analyzed in the laboratory, to determine the fluxes of nonmethane hydrocarbons (NMHCs), Aerodynamic gradient measurements of NMHC fluxes were made over the same period. Method (1) produced a high temporal resolution data set of approximately 4 days of near-continuous fluxes. Marked diurnal trends in CO 2 flux were evident. Peak daylight photosynthetic fluxes ranged from - 30 to - 90 mmol m(- 2) h(- 1). Smaller fluxes were noted during heavy rainfall and diminished photosynthetically active radiation, Nighttime respiration ranged from 0 to 10 mmol m(- 2) h(- 1). Total hydrocarbon fluxes were 3 orders of magnitude smaller. During hot, sunny conditions a total hydrocarbon flux of approximately 400 mu mol m(- 2) h(- 1) (CH 4 equivalents) was observed, Fluxes of specific NMHC compounds, from method (2), ranged between 90 and 563 mu g m(- 2) hour(- 1). The annual carbon flux to Great Britain's conifer forests {{was estimated to be}} 1. 3 Mt using a simple upscaling model based on the observations of CO 2 flux during the field experiment...|$|R
