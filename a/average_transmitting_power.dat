40|$|We {{consider}} two non-iterative algorithms {{of adaptive}} power loading for multicarrier modulation (MCM) system, The first one minimizes the average {{power of the}} system transmitter and ensures the preset average bit-error rate, while the second reduces the <b>average</b> <b>transmitting</b> <b>power</b> subject to the given values of demanded bit-error rate and of the outage probability. The algorithms {{may be used for}} power-efficient management of the up-link in cellular communication, where mobile terminals use rechargeable batteries, or of the downlink in satellite communication with solar power source of a transponder. We present performance analysis of the adaptive MCM systems supported by computer simulation for the case of the m-Nakagami fading and additive white Gaussian noise in the forward and backward channels. Evaluation of the power gain of the proposed strategies and its comparison with uniform power loading shows that the gain depends on the fading depth and average signal to noise ratio in the system sub-channels...|$|E

Based on the established delay QoS provisioning framework, we formulate the nonconvex optimization problem which aims at maximizing the average energy efficiency of the sensor node in the WAHSN while meeting PU’s statistical delay QoS requirement as well as satisfying sensor node’s average transmission rate, <b>average</b> <b>transmitting</b> <b>power,</b> and peak transmitting power constraints. By employing the theories of fractional programming, convex hull, and probabilistic transmission, we convert the original fractional-structured nonconvex problem to the additively structured parametric convex problem and obtain the optimal power allocation strategy under the given parameter via Lagrangian method. Finally, we derive the optimal average energy efficiency and corresponding optimal power allocation scheme by employing the Dinkelbach method. Simulation results show that our derived optimal power allocation strategy can be dynamically adjusted based on PU’s delay QoS requirement as well as the channel conditions. The impact of PU’s delay QoS requirement on sensor node’s energy efficiency is also illustrated...|$|E

40|$|Range {{resolution}} {{for a given}} radar can {{be significantly}} improved by using very short pulses. Unfortunately, utilizing short pulses decreases the <b>average</b> <b>transmitted</b> <b>power,</b> which can hinder the radar’s normal modes of operation, particularly for multi-function and surveillance radars. Since the <b>average</b> <b>transmitted</b> <b>power</b> is directly linked to the receiver SNR, it is often desirable to increase the pulse width while simultaneously maintaining adequate range resolution. This can be made possible by using pulse compression techniques. Pulse compression allows us to achieve the <b>average</b> <b>transmitted</b> <b>power</b> of a relatively long pulse, while obtaining the range resolution corresponding to a short pulse. In this paper, we shall implement two digital pulse compression techniques. The first technique is known as correlation processing which is predominantly used for narrow band and some medium band radar operations.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the <b>average</b> <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> under adaptive transmission for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna systems with multi-beams in fading environments when the channel-state information at both the transmitter and the receiver is available. The transmitter is supposed to be capable of spatiotemporal subchannel selection and power control as eigenvalues of channel matrix changes. Our focus is on an eigenvalue-inversion based optimization transmission scheme. With the scheme, we first introduce a concept of <b>average</b> <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> gain (ATPG) of MIMO fading channels over single-input single-output additive white Gaussian noise channels in order to analyze deeply relationship between the <b>average</b> <b>transmit</b> <b>power,</b> the number of transmit antennas, the number of receive antennas, and fading channel characterizations. Then in Rayleigh fading we derive several insightful ATPG expressions for single-beam and multi-beam transmissions, respectively. Based on these expressions, the potential amounts of <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> savings are further estimated in several cases when the underlying MIMO system is very large. Moreover, consideration of extending ATPG is also given in the presence of spatial correlation. ? 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

30|$|This {{relationship}} {{allows us}} to transform antenna powers into spatial powers which result in effective rates in each spatial subchannel. Moreover, the per-antenna power constraint prevents unbalanced power allocation among all the cooperating BSs. In {{the case of the}} total <b>average</b> <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> constraint, the majority of the power would be allocated to BSs with better channel conditions. This makes the inherent peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR) problem in the OFDM more problematic as the resulting peak <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> at the <b>transmit</b> antenna may exceed the dynamic range of high-powered amplifiers (HAP) during transmission. As a result, the transmitted signal will experience nonlinear transmission effects, which compromises signal quality and, consequently, affecting the overall system performance. With per-antenna power constraints in place, the <b>average</b> <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> of each antenna is constrained to a threshold in which the resulting high PAPR would not be problematic to cause irreversible nonlinear transmission effects.|$|R

40|$|For {{a general}} energy {{harvesting}} (EH) communication network, i. e., a network where the nodes generate their <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> through EH, we derive the asymptotically optimal online power allocation solution which optimizes a general utility function {{when the number}} of transmit time slots, N, and the battery capacities of the EH nodes, B_ max, satisfy N→∞ and B_ max→∞. The considered family of utility functions is general enough to include the most important performance measures in communication theory such as the average data rate, outage probability, average bit error probability, and average signal-to-noise ratio. The proposed power allocation solution is very simple. Namely, the asymptotically optimal power allocation for the EH network is identical to the optimal power allocation for an equivalent non-EH network whose nodes have infinite energy available but their <b>average</b> <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> is constrained to be equal to the average harvested power and/or the maximum <b>average</b> <b>transmit</b> <b>power</b> of the corresponding nodes in the EH network. Moreover, the maximum average performance of a general EH network converges to the maximum average performance of the corresponding equivalent non-EH network, when N→∞ and B_ max→∞.
