5|$|PING asks <b>a</b> <b>device</b> if it {{is ready}} to receive an OUT/DATA packet pair. PING is usually sent by a host when polling <b>a</b> <b>device</b> that most {{recently}} responded with NAK or NYET. This avoids the need to send a large data packet to <b>a</b> <b>device</b> that the host suspects to be unwilling to accept it. The device responds with ACK, NAK, or STALL, as appropriate.|$|E

50|$|The X {{refers to}} the fact that {{transmit}} wires on <b>an</b> MDI <b>device</b> must be connected to receive wires on <b>an</b> MDI-X <b>device.</b> Straight through cables connect pins 1 and 2 (transmit) on <b>an</b> MDI <b>device</b> to pins 1 and 2 (receive) on <b>an</b> MDI-X <b>device.</b> Similarly, pins 3 and 6 are receive pins on <b>an</b> MDI <b>device</b> and transmit pins on <b>an</b> MDI-X <b>device.</b> The general convention is for network hubs and switches to use the MDI-X configuration, while all other nodes such as personal computers, workstations, servers and routers use an MDI interface. Some routers and other <b>devices</b> had <b>an</b> uplink/normal switch to go back and forth between MDI and MDI-X on a specific port.|$|R
