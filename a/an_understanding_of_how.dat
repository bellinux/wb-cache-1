In addition, mirror symmetry has been related to many active areas of mathematics research, such as the McKay correspondence, topological quantum field theory, and the theory of stability conditions. At the same time, basic questions continue to vex. For example, mathematicians still lack <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> to construct examples of mirror Calabi–Yau pairs though there has been progress in understanding this issue.|$|E

25|$|<b>An</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> {{executive}} dysfunction shapes {{development has}} implications how we conceptualize executive functions {{and their role}} in shaping the individual. Disorders affecting children such as ADHD, along with oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, high functioning autism and Tourette’s syndrome have all been suggested to involve executive functioning deficits. The main focus of current research has been on working memory, planning, set shifting, inhibition, and fluency. This research suggests that differences exist between typically functioning, matched controls and clinical groups, on measures of executive functioning.|$|E

Compounds of heavy metals such as osmium, lead, uranium or gold (in immunogold labelling) may be used prior to TEM observation to selectively deposit electron dense atoms in or on the sample in desired cellular or protein region.

25|$|In {{the modern}} {{microscopic}} interpretation of entropy in statistical mechanics, entropy {{is the amount}} of additional information needed to specify the exact physical state of a system, given its thermodynamic specification. Understanding the role of thermodynamic entropy in various processes requires <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> and why that information changes as the system evolves from its initial to its final state. It is often said that entropy is an expression of the disorder, or randomness of a system, or of our lack of information about it. The second law is now often seen as an expression of the fundamental postulate of statistical mechanics through the modern definition of entropy.|$|E

25|$|Guard cells {{perceive}} {{and process}} environmental and endogenous stimuli such as light, humidity, CO2 concentration, temperature, drought, and plant hormones to trigger cellular responses resulting in stomatal opening or closure. These signal transduction pathways determine for example how quickly a plant will lose water during a drought period. Guard cells {{have become a}} model for single cell signaling. Using Arabidopsis thaliana, the investigation of signal processing in single guard cells has become open {{to the power of}} genetics. Cytosolic and nuclear proteins and chemical messengers that function in stomatal movements have been identified that mediate the transduction of environmental signals thus controlling CO2 intake into plants and plant water loss. Research on guard cell signal transduction mechanisms is producing <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> plants can improve their response to drought stress by reducing plant water loss.|$|E

Learners develop the skills of critical inquiry (for example, where to find information and how to analyse and use evidence), media literacy and <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> information is mediated and communicated.

25|$|In May 2010 and December 2010, {{soldiers}} of the 560th worked specifically with the Ugandan army {{to set up a}} military decision making process (MDMP) training event. The idea was to familiarize the Ugandans with U.S. Army Light Infantry MDMP at the tactical battalion level. Uganda’s military is highly interested in understanding how the American Army conducts the MDMP based on their operational lessons learned in both the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Somalia. The seminar assisted the process by establishing a basic understanding of roles and responsibilities of a light infantry battalion staff in the MDMP process, MDMP timelines and sequence of events, products or deliverables, and <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> this product aids the field commander. This, in turn, set the foundation for a follow-on MDMP, which will familiarize the Ugandan army with the light infantry decision making process at the brigade level. Such training events also help the U.S. by enhancing awareness in the U.S. military of Ugandan infantry battalion practices, thereby improving interoperability. They also elicit lessons learned from the audience’s peacekeeping operations.|$|E
25|$|On the one hand, a materialist view of {{landscape}} tends to stress how {{it may be}} seen in terms of a set of resources, for example for hunter-gatherers or early farming groups. This leads one to turn, for example, to optimal foraging theory and other economic models for <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> people exploited the landscape 'rationally'. Postprocessualists like to argue that landscapes are always viewed in different ways by different peoples. They reject the 'rational' view of 'landscape-as-a-set-of-resources' as that of our own society and one that is ideologically loaded in its own way, loaded towards ideas of commodity and exploitation found in our own society. They suggest that ancient peoples would have had different views of what was 'real' in that landscape. On the other hand, an exclusively idealist view {{of landscape}} does not work either. Postprocessualists like to stress that such an understanding of landscape was not formed in the abstract—that the way people moved around and used that landscape affected their understanding of it.|$|E

25|$|In 1955, the Fish and Wildlife Service {{created a}} new program, Ocean Research, and made Sette its director. Again, Sette took charge of a new {{laboratory}} and, from a headquarters {{on the campus of}} Stanford University, pioneered yet another new aspect of fisheries science, namely, an examination of all available data concerning the oceans and development of <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> they relate to the abundance and distribution of fish. He again created a team of biologists, oceanographers, and meteorologists, and they analyzed a mass of data on sea surface temperatures, weather observations, and all known data on the abundance of fish over time. By 1961, Sette had published analysis that demonstrated that abundance in a fishery depended not only fish population size itself, but also on the availability of the fish population to exploitation by fishing vessels, with oceanographic and meteorological factors playing a role in the latter as currents and weather differed from year to year. One of the team′s innovative achievements was the publication of an atlas of 168 monthly mean sea surface temperature charts for the Pacific Ocean north of latitude 20° North covering the years 1949 through 1962.|$|E

The loss of almost a quarter of Australia's overseas soldiers and the failure of the Singapore strategy that had permitted it to accept the sending of the AIF to aid Britain, stunned the country.|$|E

500|$|Wills {{struck his}} contemporaries as {{peculiar}} {{and at times}} narcissistic, with a prickly temperament, but also kind, charismatic and companionable. Often embroiled in controversy, he seemed to lack <b>an</b> <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> his words and actions could repeatedly get him into trouble. His obsession with sport was such that he showed little interest in anything else. Through his research, journalist Martin Flanagan concluded that Wills was [...] "utterly bereft of insight into himself", and football historian Gillian Hibbins described Wills as [...] "an overbearing and undisciplined young man who tended to blame others for his troubles and {{was more interested in}} winning a game than in respecting sporting rules." [...] Wills' family and peers, though angered by his misbehaviour, frequently forgave him. It is unlikely that he sought popular favour, but his strong egalitarian streak helped solidify his folk hero status.

[...] Although Jive Records initially hired Russell Simmons and Larry Smith to produce Escape, commitments in New York kept Simmons from recording sessions. Hutchins had met Smith at Disco Fever in New York City; although they were friends and often discussed music, he said that they did not originally consider working together. Jive Records could not find a producer, and Hutchins asked Smith to come to Europe and produce the album. The producer initially refused for financial reasons, but called Hutchins the following day saying that he needed money to pay a hospital bill for a friend who had his finger tips ripped off. Smith and Hutchins then quickly met to develop music to show to the label, recording the bass for [...] "Five Minutes of Funk".|$|E
