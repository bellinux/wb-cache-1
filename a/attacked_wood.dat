50|$|Gribbles bore into {{wood and}} plant {{material}} for ingestion as food. The cellulose of wood is digested, most likely {{with the aid}} of cellulases produced by the gribbles themselves. The most destructive species are Limnoria lignorum, L. tripunctata and L. quadripunctata. Due to dispersal while inhabiting wooden ships, it is uncertain where these three mentioned species originated. Limnoriidae are second only to the Teredinidae in the amount of destruction caused to marine timber structures such as jetties and piers. L. tripunctata is unusually tolerant of creosote, a preservative often used to protect timber piles, due to symbiosis with creosote-degrading bacteria. Gribbles bore the surface layers of wood, unlike the Teredinidae which attack more deeply. Their burrows are 1-2 mm diameter, may be several centimetres long, and have the burrow’s roof punctured with a series of smaller ventilation holes. <b>Attacked</b> <b>wood</b> can become spongy and friable.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{purposes}} of this study were to: evaluate de natural durability of three species of tauari (Couratari guianensis Aublet, Couratari oblongifolia Ducke & R. Knuth and Couratari stellata A. C. Smith), report the colorimetric parameters according to CIE L*a*b* 1976 system and also show the appearance of control and <b>attacked</b> <b>wood</b> blocks. Two brown-rot [Gloeophyllum trabeum (Persoon ex Fries) Murril. and Lentinus lepideus Fr. ] and two white-rot [Trametes versicolor (Linnaeus ex Fries) Pilat and Ganoderma applanatum (Pers. ex Wallr.) ] fungi were used. Tauari wood was classed as "moderately resistant" to "resistant" when exposed toGloeophyllum trabeum, Trametes versicolor andGanoderma applanatum fungi. All extractives' contents of attacked samples decreased when compared with the control (sound wood), exceptCouratari stellata exposed to Ganoderma applanatum. Conversely, all ash contents increased when compared with the control, except Couratari stellata exposed to Gloeophyllum trabeum. All <b>attacked</b> <b>wood</b> blocks and wood meal samples were darker, except wood meal from Couratari stellata exposed toTrametes versicolor, and redder than the control.

40|$|Ultrasonic {{tomography}} on standing trees. Ultrasonic tomography {{was used}} for the detection of degradation of transversal section of a beech, attacked by white decay. The image reconstruction of the transversal section of the tree in 2 D was obtained with a software, which used the values of ultrasonic velocities measured at different heights from the ground. The <b>attacked</b> <b>wood</b> is characterised by low velocities. The measurements were performed with special transducers of 1 MHz, without damaging the bark of the tree. To improve the readings of the signals, a frequency analysis was performed. The ultrasonic tomographies were compared with the corresponding photographic images and with data obtained with a "Resistograph". A good agreement between ultrasonic tomographies and photographs was observed. The image resolution is between 4 and 5 cm. Presently, this is the best resolution ever obtained with an acoustic nondestructive method on a standing tree...|$|E

40|$|Microscopic {{examinations}} of CCA-treated Pinus radiata D. Don timbers {{in an industrial}} cooling tower in New Zealand showed bacteria and soft-rot fungi to be primarily responsible for the decay of these timbers. Of these micro-organisms, erosion bacteria appeared to be most widespread, attacking wood cell walls independently {{as well as in}} combination with tunnelling bacteria and soft-rot fungi. Tunnelling bacteria <b>attacked</b> <b>wood</b> often with soft-rot fungi, and less commonly with erosion bacteria. Wood samples were taken from various locations in the cooling tower, including spray line support, panelling above the spray drift eliminators, and from spray drift elimination slats. Examination of these samples indicated that, among the micro-organisms which attacked the wood, erosion bacteria were most tolerant of oxygen-limiting conditions as bacterial erosion was the only type of decay present in wood constantly saturated with water. The evidence provided of the presence of widespread bacterial attacks in an industrial cooling tower timbers is the basis for recognising that bacteria may {{play an important role in}} the deterioration of cooling tower timbers...|$|E

40|$|White rot fungi usually {{decompose}} cell {{walls of}} <b>attacked</b> <b>wood</b> destroying tissue elements (i. e. parenchyma cells, wood fibres, tension wood, tracheas etc) in different amount, depending to wood-species {{as well as}} to its' zones. Different fungi secrete specific enzymes that are responsible for certain damages. As consequence, the wood structure use to be significantly and unfixable decomposed and changed. Microscopical analyses that have been run provided clear and indicative information relating to effects of fungal activity on wood tissue. Physiological requirements of fungi are for shore of the highest importance in understanding of mechanism of decaying process in the wood. The most important factors as like temperature and concentration of H ions, as well as main nutrients as sources of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus can affect the behaviour of wood decaying fungi. The impacts of these factors on the growth and production on mycelial mass of Stereum hirsutum (Willd. ex Fr.) S. F. Gray., have been investigated.

40|$|The {{red palm}} weevil (RPW), Rhynchophorus ferrugineus is a trunk tissue borer that has {{recently}} become the major pest of palms in the Mediterranean Basin. In Sicily the red palm weevil is {{strongly associated with}} the Canary island date palm, Phoenix canariensis Hortorum ex Chabaud, an ornamental palm with high economic value. RPW larvae consumes the trunk tender soft tissues, making galleries that present a chewed appearance with a characteristic fermented odour. Several aspects of the RPW’s biology {{still need to be}} investigated such as its gut bacterial community, and the agents of fermentation processes that occur in the galleries made by the larvae. The aim of this work was to analyse the bacterial community in the tissues of Canary island date palm attacked by RPW. Healthy and attacked palm tissue samples were aseptically ground and serially diluted for bacterial counts and isolation on Nutrient Agar and Tryptone-yeast extract agar. Bacterial counts revealed higher microbial biomass in <b>attacked</b> <b>wood.</b> Phenotypically different colonies were picked in triplicate and grouped into Operational Taxonomic Units (OTU) by analysis of the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) polymorphisms. A dramatic decline in biodiversity was observed in the bacterial community of the attacked tissues. Partial sequencing of 16 S rRNA gene of representative isolates of each OTU and BLASTn search results revealed that the majority of isolates from infested tissue are facultative anaerobes with fermentative metabolism and aerotollerant fermenting anaerobes. Interestingly, entomopathogenic bacteria of the Bacillus thuringiensis/ B. cereus group were also detected in both health and attacked tissues...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1968 A {{mooring system}} was {{designed}} and constructed to make possible the installation and the recovery of racks of sample panels {{for a study of}} deep-ocean wood-boring molluscs. Racks containing pine, fir, oak, and cedar boards were exposed to borer attack at six stations with depths of 50, 100, 150, 200, 500 and 1000 meters, all west of Depoe Bay, Oregon. Two wood-boring molluscs, a pholad, Xylophaga washingtona Bartsch, and a teredinid, Bankia setacea (Tyron), were recovered from exposed wood materials. Xylophaga washingtona was the dominant form and was found at all three deep stations. Bankia setacea was found only at the 200 -meter site and in very low numbers. This reports the deepest known teredinid actively settling and boring into a test board. Borer attack increased in intensity with time, and in general, decreased with increasing depth. Initial attack appeared to commence right above the line where sample panels were in contact with the sediment. Attack was heaviest in this zone and decreased with increasing distance upward from the sea-sediment interface, approaching zero in about 20 centimeters. In general cedar was the most heavily <b>attacked</b> <b>wood</b> type followed in turn by pine, fir, and then oak, which proved the most resistant to xylophagan borers, The degree of maximum borer penetration into any wood type correlated nicely with the density of the wood, higher density wood being correspondingly most resistant to borer attack. Degree of maximum borer penetration increased with time and decreased with increasing depth. The mooring system is fully described along with a summary of field installation and recovery methods.

40|$|The {{structure}} of wood is so compact that enzymes are {{too large to}} penetrate into the structure and thereby <b>attack</b> the <b>wood</b> components for modifications that can be valuable for various purposes. Here we present a pretreatment method based on traditional kraft pulping, which opens the wood structure, so that enzymes are able to <b>attack</b> the <b>wood</b> components. To study this kind of chemical pretreatment, spruce wood samples were treated at similar conditions used in kraft cooking at varying intensities (H-factors). To verify if the structure was “opened” for enzymes, the pretreated wood samples were incubated with a cellulolytic culture filtrate, and the released reducing sugar concentration after the enzymatic hydrolysis was measured. The results indicated that un-pretreated wood fibers could not be attacked by the enzymes, but already relatively mild pretreatment was sufficient for letting the culture filtrate <b>attack</b> <b>wood</b> polysaccharides, and more intensive treatments opened the structure further. The mildest treatments did not cause any significant yield losses of lignin (Klason lignin). Some galactogluco-mannans were however lost during the pretreatments.
