5|$|Although the Hiorns had descendants, {{the estate}} was {{managed by the}} Public Trustee, who put Linwood House up for sale <b>as</b> <b>four</b> {{sections}}, {{with one of those}} holding the house itself.

Marker paid ₤200 each for the building sections, and ₤1,250 for the section containing the house. The furniture of Linwood House was sold in a separate auction. The house was rented to lawyer Francis Ion Cowlishaw, son of prominent provincial councillor William Patten Cowlishaw (1839–1903). Cowlishaw senior had lived nearby in a house named 'Chaddesden', and Cowlishaw Street and Chaddesden Lane are named after the family.|$|E

The ever-increasing number of visitors to the Memorial has resulted in the authorities taking measures to control access by fencing off certain areas of the former battlefield.|$|E

5|$|An {{investigation}} {{under the}} PRC State Council was announced on 16 November, {{the day after}} the fire, to determine the cause of the blaze. A preliminary finding by investigators concluded that sparks from welding work being done on the building, undertaken by unlicensed welders, ignited scaffolding around the structure, which led to the apartments' destruction. The municipal government also placed the blame on illegal multi-layered subcontracting, and detained four managers from several construction companies. In all, sixteen individuals have been arrested in connection to the fire, as well <b>as</b> <b>four</b> others accused of being unlicensed welders.|$|E

5|$|Both sexes {{build the}} nest; the {{building}} periods {{can be as}} brief as three days to as long <b>as</b> <b>four</b> weeks. Egg count differs by location; the number has been as low as two and as high as five. Egg color varies; they can appear bluish green to pale yellowish blue, spotted abundantly in reddish brown. Both sexes incubate but the female is mainly responsible {{as well as being}} the sole provider of brooding. Curve-billed parents defend their nests fervently against other species; snakes are the most frequent predators of eggs and nestlings. Curved-billed Thrashers are rarely victims of nest parasitism by cowbirds. In situations where food is scarce, parents feed older fledglings first. The fledging period ranges from 11 to 18 days.|$|E

5|$|During jury {{selection}} in the United States, attorneys have two options for excluding potential jurors. The first option {{is a challenge}} for cause, in which attorneys must state the reason for a challenge (such as clear bias or a conflict of interest), the opposing party is allowed to respond, and the judge decides whether to exclude the juror. The second option is a peremptory challenge, where an attorney can exclude a juror without stating any reason. While challenges for cause are unlimited, attorneys have {{a limited number of}} peremptory challenges, sometimes as few <b>as</b> <b>four,</b> although 10 is more common in non-capital felony cases.|$|E
5|$|External staircases. Most villas and palazzi were {{designed}} for formal entrance by a carriage through an archway in the street façade, leading to a courtyard within. An intricate double staircase would lead from the courtyard to the piano nobile. This would be the palazzo's principal entrance to the first-floor reception rooms; the symmetrical flights of steps would turn inwards and outwards as many <b>as</b> <b>four</b> times. Owing to the topography of their elevated sites it was often necessary to approach churches by many steps; these steps were often transformed into long straight marble staircases, in themselves decorative architectural features (illustration 19), {{in the manner of}} the Spanish Steps in Rome.|$|E
5|$|Freedom from Want is {{the third}} {{in a series of}} four oil {{paintings}} entitled Four Freedoms by Norman Rockwell. They were inspired by , known <b>as</b> <b>Four</b> Freedoms, delivered to the 77th United States Congress on January 6, 1941. In the early 1940s, Roosevelt's Four Freedoms themes were still vague and abstract to many, but the government used them to help boost patriotism. The Four Freedoms' theme was eventually incorporated into the Atlantic Charter, and it became part of the charter of the United Nations. The series of paintings ran in The Saturday Evening Post accompanied by essays from noted writers on four consecutive weeks: Freedom of Speech (February 20), Freedom of Worship (February 27), Freedom from Want (March 6), and Freedom from Fear (March 13). Eventually, the series was widely distributed in poster form and became instrumental in the U.S. Government War Bond Drive.|$|E
