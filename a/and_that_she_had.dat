5|$|Addie Bourland was a {{dressmaker}} whose residence {{was across}} Fremont Street from Fly's Boarding House. She testified {{that she saw}} both sides facing each other, {{that none of the}} Cowboys had held their hands up, that the firing was general, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> not seen Billy Clanton fall immediately as the Cowboys had testified.|$|E
5|$|Crime author Ann Rule {{covered the}} case in her book Bitter Harvest: A Woman's Fury, a Mother's Sacrifice, which {{provided}} extensive detail on both the case's development and Green's personal biography. The book was a New York Times Bestseller, though one reviewer felt that Rule failed to address Green's motivation for her crimes <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> treated Green unsympathetically and Farrar over-sympathetically.|$|E
5|$|In response, editor Cathy Kuhlmeier {{and reporters}} Leslie Smart and Leanne Tippett {{filed suit in}} January 1984 {{with the aid of}} the American Civil Liberties Union. Kuhlmeier later said that the idea for the pieces had come from old issues of The Spectrum, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been looking to update them.|$|E

"And {{you have}} {{thoroughly}} investigated her character, <b>and</b> know <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> the well-balanced mind {{which will be}} very much wanted here, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> cut off <b>and</b> swept away all remnants of former attachments to other young men?" ...|$|R
50|$|It was {{reported}} in May 2013 that her refit was completed <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> returned to operational duties.|$|R

5|$|A {{document}} from 25 March contains her {{note that}} joining the uprising was her sole idea, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> hoped {{that such a}} moment would come her entire life. She cut her hair, prepared a uniform for herself and organized and equipped a group of volunteers, speaking passionately after a mass on 29 March. On 4 April she signed a declaratory document marking her access to the local uprising forces. Her unit was composed of roughly 280 infantry, 60 cavalry and several hundred peasants armed with war scythes.|$|E
5|$|If {{traditional}} {{practices were}} adhered to, feasting would have continued for two days, while guests {{would have given}} gifts, mainly of money, to the newlyweds. The wedding ceremony would have culminated with the guests entering the bridal chamber, where they would have made various sexual references and innuendos, led by a figure with his face painted black. In Chinese rural tradition, the bride was expected to show the bloodstains on the bed sheets from her wedding night to prove that her hymen had been broken during sexual intercourse, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> therefore been a virgin.|$|E
5|$|In August 2005, Glover {{was sentenced}} to 240 hours {{community}} service by St Helens magistrates after admitting claiming £14,831 in welfare benefits between August 2002 and November 2004 while posing for newspapers and magazines. She stated {{that she did not}} know the small and irregular earnings would make a difference to her benefits, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been sometimes too depressed to leave her flat. While performing the community service in 2006, she was assaulted twice by a group of girls, one attack leaving her with a broken nose. This cost her a month of modelling work, and contributed to her depression, but also to her taking kickboxing classes to learn to defend herself.|$|E

5|$|Inappropriate {{handling}} {{in rough}} weather {{was the most}} obvious cause for Kronans sinking. Unlike Vasa, Kronans sailing characteristics were not inherently flawed and the ship had served for several years in rough seas. During {{the work of the}} commission, artillery officer Anders Gyllenspak even made direct comparisons to Vasa. He testified that Kronans ballast had been lightened at Dalarö {{at the beginning of the}} campaign <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> not replenished her supply of drink, so that the ship had a shallower draft and would have been somewhat less stable than with full stores, though he did not blame this on Creutz.|$|E
5|$|Later, Psaltis met a {{man named}} Matthew, whom she married in June 2005 in Las Vegas. In December 2005, Psaltis {{gave birth to her}} first child, a boy named Matthew. In January 2006, she filed a {{complaint}} against WWE with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, claiming that her contract had been wrongfully terminated {{as a result of her}} pregnancy <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> suffered mental duress as a result of the release. The case was reportedly settled in late 2007. Psaltis gave birth to her second child, a girl named Katelyn Marie in May 2009.|$|E
5|$|Margot Robbie {{auditioned for}} the role of Donna in 2008. The actress {{believed}} that she had performed badly in the audition and decided to leave for a five-week snowboarding holiday in Canada. Robbie had been in Canada for two days when she received a phone call telling her that she had been successful <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> to return to Australia. Robbie began appearing on-screen in June of that year. Donna was originally supposed to have a guest character role, but Robbie was promoted to regular cast member shortly after her debut.|$|E

60|$|And strangest {{of all is}} it to hold my wife's hand again, <b>and</b> {{to think}} <b>that</b> I <b>have</b> counted her, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> counted me, among the dead.|$|R

5|$|On January 3, 2014, Kesha {{checked into}} Timberline Knolls Residential Treatment Center, a rehab {{facility}} in Lemont, Illinois, for eating disorder treatment. Kesha's mother Pebe Sebert {{confirmed that the}} eating disorder Kesha was suffering with is bulimia nervosa <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been struggling with it since she was signed. She also alleged that Dr. Luke was partly the cause of Kesha's eating disorder, saying that Luke had allegedly told her to lose weight after he signed her, comparing {{the shape of her}} body to a refrigerator. Sebert asserted that this had caused Kesha's disorder to worsen. Kesha had completed her treatment on March 6, 2014, after spending two months in rehab.|$|E
5|$|Sabrina {{asked her}} friends {{not to discuss}} her past as she {{believed}} her humble beginnings, and Day's mistreatment of her, would tarnish her reputation. Anna Seward nevertheless wrote about Sabrina's upbringing in her 1804 work Memoirs on the Life of Dr. Darwin. As Seward publicly identified Sabrina in the book, it was criticised by the press, and Sabrina's son John was very angry to learn of his mother's past. In his 1820 memoirs, Edgeworth stated his belief that Sabrina and Day made a good match and that she loved him. Sabrina disagreed with these accounts, saying that Day had made her miserable, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> effectively been a slave.|$|E
5|$|Sabrina {{was born}} in 1757 in Clerkenwell, London, and was left at the Hospital for the Maintenance and Education of Exposed and Deserted Young Children (more {{commonly}} known as the Foundling Hospital) in London on 24 May 1757 by an anonymous individual. This person left a note explaining that the baby's baptismal name was Manima Butler <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been baptised in St James's Church, Clerkenwell. Her name was likely a misspelling of Monimia but there were no baptismal records for any spelling of the name at the parish.|$|E
50|$|It was {{reported}} in 2007 on BBC Radio 4's The Music Group that Noosha Fox was recording a solo album of electropop, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> her own website.|$|R

5|$|Six months later, Simón {{is still}} missing. While searching for him, Laura spots Benigna, who is then struck {{and killed by}} a car. The police find {{evidence}} that Benigna worked at the orphanage, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> a son named Tomás, who lived there but was kept hidden. A few weeks after Laura was adopted, the orphans stole the mask that Tomás wore to conceal his deformed face. Embarrassed, Tomás refused to leave his hiding place in a nearby sea cave, and the rising tide drowned him.|$|E
5|$|Wu {{retired in}} 1981, {{and became a}} {{professor}} emerita. She died on February 16, 1997, in New York City {{at the age of}} 84 after suffering a stroke. An ambulance rushed her to St. Luke's–Roosevelt Hospital Center but she was pronounced dead on arrival. She was survived by her husband and son. In accordance with her wishes, her ashes were buried in the courtyard of the Ming De School that her father had founded, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> attended as a girl.|$|E
5|$|At {{a luncheon}} with the St. John's Board of Trade in February 2012, Dunderdale {{delivered}} a speech which {{laid out a}} more fiscally conservative course. She stated that the days of big spending were over {{and that it was}} time to rein in public spending. Dunderdale said that there would be virtually no new spending in the upcoming provincial budget, that government departments were told to find savings <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> ordered an audit of all government programs. She also said that her goal in the next decade is to radically decrease Newfoundland and Labrador's debt load and to achieve the same per capita debt as the Canadian average. Fiscal restraint was again the key message in the March 5, 2011, speech from the throne. The speech announced that all government departments and programs were under review. Dunderdale later stated that her government was looking for $100 million in savings for the upcoming fiscal year and that key services were exempt from cuts.|$|E

6000|$|... 'No;--she went alone. But {{the horror}} of it is this. They think down there that Felix has,--well, made love to her, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> been taken to London by him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not yet," [...] Francis replied. [...] "Margaret {{will be here}} in a minute. She told me to {{say that}} cocktails are here <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> ordered dinner served on the terrace." ...|$|R
5|$|Barbara Ketcham Wheaton and Stephen Mennell {{provided}} the definitive arguments against these claims. They {{point out that}} Catherine’s father-in-law, King Francis I, and the flower of the French aristocracy had dined at some of Italy’s most élite tables during the king’s Italian campaigns (and that an earlier generation had done so during King Charles VIII’s invasion of 1494); that a vast Italian entourage had visited France for the wedding of Catherine de’ Medici’s father to her French-born mother; <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> little influence at court until her husband’s death {{because he was so}} besotted by his mistress, Diane de Poitiers. In fact, a large population of Italians—bankers, silk-weavers, philosophers, musicians, and artists, including Leonardo da Vinci—had emigrated to France to promote the burgeoning Renaissance. Nevertheless, popular culture frequently attributes Italian culinary influence and forks in France to Catherine.|$|E
5|$|Despite Sheila's erratic mental state, her {{psychiatrist}} {{told the}} court {{that the kind of}} violence necessary to commit the murders was not consistent with his view of her. In particular, {{he said he did not}} believe she would have killed her father or children, because her difficult relationship was confined to her mother. Her ex-husband said the same: that, despite her tendency to throw things and sometimes hit him, she had never harmed the children. June Bamber's sister, Pamela Boutflour, testified that Sheila was not a violent person <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> never known her to use a gun; June's niece, Ann Eaton, {{told the court}} that Sheila did not know how to use one. Bamber disputed this, telling police on the night of the shooting, as they stood outside the house, that he and Sheila had gone target shooting together. He acknowledged later that he had not seen her fire a gun as an adult.|$|E
5|$|In January 1992, Mugabe's wife died. In April 1995, Horizon {{magazine}} {{revealed that}} Mugabe had secretly been {{having an affair}} with his secretary Grace Marufu since 1987 <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> borne him a son and a daughter. His secret revealed, Mugabe decided to hold a much-publicised wedding. 12,000 people were invited to the August 1996 ceremony, which took place in Kutama and was orchestrated by the head of the Roman Catholic Church in Zimbabwe, Patrick Chakaipa. The ceremony was controversial among the Catholic community because of the adulterous nature of Mugabe and Marufu's relationship. To house his family, Mugabe then built a new mansion at Borrowdale. In the 1995 parliamentary election—which saw a low turnout of 31.7%—ZANU-PF gained 147 out of 150 seats. Following the election, Mugabe expanded his cabinet from 29 to 42 ministers while the government adopted a 133% pay rise for MPs.|$|E
