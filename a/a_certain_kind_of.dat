5|$|In the AdS/CFT correspondence, one considers, in {{addition}} to a theory of quantum gravity, <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> quantum field theory called a conformal field theory. This is a particularly symmetric and mathematically well behaved type of quantum field theory. Such theories are often studied in the context of string theory, where they are associated with the surface swept out by a string propagating through spacetime, and in statistical mechanics, where they model systems at a thermodynamic critical point.|$|E

Elements that can be eliminated have been eliminated. This was pointed out to me by somebody who referred to the paintings of Rembrandt and his use of light: some elements are highlighted while others are obscured or even pushed back into the dark. And it's something that we do - we bring out elements that we want to emphasise.|$|E
50|$|David Rosenthal is a {{foremost}} {{advocate of}} this view. It claims that a mental state is conscious when it's {{the subject of}} a higher-order thought (HOT). Phenomenal consciousness in particular corresponds to <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> mental states (e.g., visual inputs) that are the subjects of HOTs. Rosenthal excludes the special case in which one learns about one's lower-order states by conscious deduction. For instance, if psychoanalysis could reveal one's unconscious motives, this would not suddenly make them conscious.|$|R

The theory of modular forms therefore belongs to complex analysis but the main importance of the theory has traditionally been in its connections with number theory. Modular forms appear in other areas, such as algebraic topology, sphere packing, and string theory.|$|E
25|$|Liszt's own {{point of}} view {{regarding}} programme music can for the time of his youth be taken from the preface of the Album d'un voyageur (1837). According to this, a landscape could evoke <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> mood. Since a piece of music could also evoke a mood, a mysterious resemblance with the landscape could be imagined. In this sense the music would not paint the landscape, but it would match the landscape in a third category, the mood.|$|E
25|$|Age of Empires Online {{includes}} five {{classes of}} military units: Infantry, archers, cavalry, siege weaponry, and naval units. All military classes are developed {{to maintain a}} balance on gameplay, and thus avoiding visible advantages between civilizations. As an example, a unit powerful against buildings can be weak against <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> cavalry. Unique units are available for the Greek, Egyptian, Celts, and Persian civilizations, either {{from the start of}} the game or through advisor cards. These civilization-specific units are generally more powerful, but can still be vulnerable to certain units.

25|$|A type system {{associates}} a type {{with each}} computed value and, {{by examining the}} flow of these values, attempts to ensure or prove that no type errors can occur. The given type system in question determines exactly what constitutes a type error, but in general {{the aim is to}} prevent operations expecting <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> value from being used with values for which that operation does not make sense (logic errors); memory errors will also be prevented. Type systems are often specified as part of programming languages, and built into the interpreters and compilers for them; although the type system of a language can be extended by optional tools that perform added kinds of checks using the language's original type syntax and grammar.|$|E
25|$|A {{seemingly}} unrelated {{construction is}} the -function of number theory. This object {{belongs to a}} special class of functions called modular functions, whose graphs form <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> repeating pattern. Although this function appears in a branch of mathematics which seems {{very different from the}} theory of finite groups, the two subjects turn out to be intimately related. In the late 1970s, mathematicians John McKay and John Thompson noticed that certain numbers arising in the analysis of the monster group (namely, the dimensions of its irreducible representations) are related to numbers that appear in a formula for the -function (namely, the coefficients of its Fourier series). This relationship was further developed by John Horton Conway and Simon Norton who called it monstrous moonshine because it seemed so far fetched.|$|E

40|$|With {{the rising}} {{importance}} of empirical data in many fields of linguistic research, {{we see an}} increase {{not only in the}} amount of electronically available corpora, but also in the number of tools used to make this data accessible, processable and searchable. Most of these tools have been developed in the course of specific linguistic projects and therefore can only handle <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> linguistic information, such as syntactic-structures (e. g. TIGERSearch, Lezius 2002), or dialogue-structures (e. g. EXMARaLDA, Schmidt 2004) etc. At the same time, each tool uses its own, proprietary format for representing the text and its annotations. Such formats are optimized for a specific <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> analysis and the performance of a specific processing tool. Consequently they cannot easily be mapped onto each other. This impedes those linguistic research questions which pre-suppose a global view on data, i. e., which require the option to correlate, query and analyze several <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> linguistic annotations at once. We present Pepper, a modularized converter framework addressing the problem that a linguistic researcher may be limited to a small set of questions due to the tool(s) he or she uses. Pepper is based on the meta-model Salt (Zipser & Romary 2010) and offers the possibility of converting data from n formats into m formats with a minimal number of necessary mappings. The pluggable architecture of Pepper allows the injection of new formats into the framework. Pepper has no restrictions on the underlying techniques used in representing these formats (e. g. XML, tabular-formats, bracketing-formats or mixtures thereof) ...|$|R
