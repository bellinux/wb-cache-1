Such information could be of value in designing and evaluating lesion and ablation experiments and may reflect spatial properties of neurons. This study mapped the distribution of major arteries and veins of the rat hippocampal formation. Arteries and veins of adult female Wistar rats anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital were injected with silicone rubber. Double injections to demonstrate both arteries and veins in the same animal were with India ink and a fluorescent material. Arterial supply to the hippocampus was via transverse hippocampal arteries that stemmed from the longitudinal hippocampal artery, {{a branch of the}} posterior cerebral artery. Internal transverse hippocampal arteries located in the hippocampal fissure supplied small, short branches to the adjacent blade of the fascia dentata, part of the area dentata, and CA 3 fields. Other branches of the longitudinal artery supplied the remaining blade of the fascia and area dentata, subicular fields, and entorhinal structures. Internal transverse hippocampal veins located in the hippocampal fissure alternated in position with the arteries and appeared to be paired with, and to drain fields supplied by, the internal transverse arteries. Deep transverse hippocampal veins, unaccompanied by arteries, received branches in the intraventricular alveus and <b>adjacent</b> <b>stratum</b> oriens of CA 3. The transverse veins drained into longitudinal vessels or the basal vein.

40|$|Spontaneous {{neurotransmitter}} {{release and}} activation of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) each {{play a role}} in the plasticity of neuronal synapses. Astrocytes may contribute to short- and long-term synaptic changes by signaling to neurons via these processes. Spontaneous whole-cell AMPA receptor (AMPAR) currents were recorded in CA 1 pyramidal cells in situ while evoking Ca 2 � increases in the <b>adjacent</b> <b>stratum</b> radiatum astrocytes by uncaging IP 3. Whole-cell patch clamp was used to deliver caged IP 3 and the Ca 2 � indicator dye Oregon green BAPTA- 1 to astrocytes. Neurons were patch-clamped and filled with Alexa 568 hydrazide dye to visualize their morphological relationship to the astrocyte. On uncaging of IP 3, astrocyte Ca 2 � responses reliably propagated as a wave into the very fine distal processes, synchronizing Ca 2 � activity within astrocyte microdomains. The intracellular astrocyte Ca 2 � wave coincided with a significant increase in the frequency of AMPA spontaneous EPSCs, but with no change in their kinetics. AMPAR current amplitudes were increased as well, but not significantly (p � 0. 06). The increased frequency of AMPAR currents was sensitive to the group I mGluR antagonists LY 367385 and 2 -methyl- 6 -(phenylethynyl) -pyridine, suggesting that (1) astrocytes released glutamate in response to IP 3 uncaging, and (2) glutamate released by astrocytes activated group I mGluRs to facilitate the release of glutamate from excitatory neuronal presynaptic boutons. These results extend previous studies, which have shown astrocyte modulation of neuronal activity in vitro and suggest that astrocyte-to-neuron signaling in intact tissue may contribute to synaptic plasticity.

A number of recent studies have combined U/Pb and/or Helium dating (U+Th/He) on single crystals to document the specific history of individual crystals. This double-dating approach is an extremely powerful provenance tool because a nearly complete crystal history can be obtained, and therefore researchers can pinpoint specific source areas with distinct geologic histories with relative certainty.

40|$|The {{microgravity}} environment encountered during space-flight {{has long}} been considered to affect plant growth and developmental processes, including cell wall biopolymer composition and content. As a prelude to studying how microgravity is perceived - and acted upon - by plants, it was first instructive to investigate what gross effects on plant growth and development occurred in microgravity. Thus, wheat seedlings were exposed to microgravity on board the space shuttle Discovery (STS- 51) for a 10 day duration, and these specimens were compared with their counterparts grown on Earth under the same conditions (e. g. controls). First, the primary roots of the wheat that developed under both microgravity and 1 g on Earth were examined to assess the role of gravity on cellulose microfibril (CMF) organization and secondary wall thickening patterns. Using a quick freeze/deep etch technique, this revealed that the cell wall CMFs of the space-grown wheat maintained the same organization as their 1 g-grown counterparts. That is, in all instances, CMFs were randomly interwoven {{with each other in}} the outermost layers (farthest removed from the plasma membrane), and parallel to each other within the individual <b>strata</b> immediately <b>adjacent</b> to the plasma membranes. The CMF angle in the innermost stratum relative to the immediately <b>adjacent</b> <b>stratum</b> was ca 80 degrees in both the space and Earth-grown plants. Second, all plants grown in microgravity had roots that grew downwards into the agar; they did not display "wandering" and upward growth as previously reported by others. Third, the space-grown wheat also developed normal protoxylem and metaxylem vessel elements with secondary thickening patterns ranging from spiral to regular pit to reticulate thickenings. Fourthly, both the space- and Earth-grown plants were essentially of the same size and height, and their lignin analyses revealed no substantial differences in their amounts and composition regardless of the gravitational field experienced, i. e. {{for the purposes of this}} study, all plants were essentially identical. These results suggest that the microgravity environment itself at best only slightly affected either cell wall biopolymer synthesis or the deposition of CMFs, in contrast to previous assertions...|$|R

At both shelf and oceanic station sites, zooplankton biomass, (excluding Euphausia superba), {{was found to}} be ca. 13 g dry mass m− 2. Copepods and small euphausiids dominated the catches. These estimates are over 4 times higher than values generally reported for the Southern Ocean and may reflect firstly, the high productivity of the study area, secondly, the time of year, summer, when biomass for many species is maximal, and thirdly, the high sampling efficiency of the LHPR.

The oils occurring in the Guelph reef reservoirs have a distinct biomarker composition (e. g. high concentrations of acyclic isoprenoids with phytane greater than pristane, abundant gammacerane, prominent C 34 and C 35 homohopanes) which not only indicates a single oil family, but also suggests a carbonate source rock deposited in a hypersaline, strongly reducing environment. Analyses of the extracts of rock samples from brown, laminated olostone lithofacies occurring in the stratigraphi-cally <b>adjacent</b> Guelph-Salina <b>strata</b> show that they have compositional similarities {{to the majority of}} the reef-hosted oils.

A broad distribution of n-paraffins, with a relatively high concentration of C 21 + members and abundant acyclic isoprenoids are typical in the organic extracts, suggesting a contribution from microbial organisms.
