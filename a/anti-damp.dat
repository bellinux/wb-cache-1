40|$|Recent {{observations}} of current-induced magnetization switching at ferromagnet/normal-conductor interfaces have important consequences for future magnetic memory technology. In one interpretation, the switching originates from carriers with spin-dependent scattering {{giving rise to}} a relativistic <b>anti-damping</b> spin-orbit torque (SOT) in structures with broken space-inversion symmetry. The alternative interpretation combines the relativistic spin Hall effect (SHE), making the normal-conductor an injector of a spin-current, with the non-relativistic spin-transfer torque (STT) in the ferromagnet. Remarkably, the SHE in these experiments originates from the Berry phase effect in the band structure of a clean crystal and the <b>anti-damping</b> STT is also based on a disorder-independent transfer of spin from carriers to magnetization. Here we report the observation of an <b>anti-damping</b> SOT stemming from an analogous Berry phase effect to the SHE. The SOT alone can therefore induce magnetization dynamics based on a scattering-independent principle. The ferromagnetic semiconductor (Ga,Mn) As we use has a broken space-inversion symmetry in the crystal. This allows us to consider a bare ferromagnetic element which eliminates by design any SHE related contribution to the spin torque. We provide an intuitive picture of the Berry phase origin of the <b>anti-damping</b> SOT and a microscopic modeling of measured data. Comment: Send to: ajf 1006 @cam. ac. u...|$|R

40|$|People’s {{forecasts}} {{from time}} series underestimate future values for upward trends and overestimate them for downward ones. This trend damping may occur because 1) people anchor {{on the last}} data point and make insufficient adjustment to take the trend into account, 2) they adjust towards {{the average of the}} trends they have encountered within the experiment, or 3) they are adapted to an environment in which natural trends tend to be damped. Two experiments eliminated the first account: for series that are negatively accelerated or have shallow slopes, people showed <b>anti-damping</b> (the opposite of damping), a phenomenon that cannot be interpreted in terms of under-adjustment. These experiments also produced results consistent with the second account: forecasts for a given function clearly depended on the other functions that were forecast within the same experiment. However, this second account was itself eliminated by a third experiment demonstrating both damping and, to a lesser degree, <b>anti-damping</b> when people forecast from a single series.

40|$|The {{equation}} of the Van der Pol oscillator, being {{characterized by a}} dissipative term, is non-Lagrangian. Appending an additional degree of freedom we bring the equation {{in the frame of}} action principle and thus introduce a one-way coupled system. As with the Van der Pol oscillator, the coupled system also involves only one parameter that controls the dynamics. The response system is described by a linear differential equation coupled nonlinearly to the drive system. In the linear approximation the equations of our coupled system coincide with those of the Bateman dual system (a pair of damped and <b>anti-damped</b> harmonic oscillators). The critical point of damped and <b>anti-damped</b> oscillators are stable and unstable for all physical values of the frictional coefficient μ.

40|$|Spin-{{transfer}}-torque, {{a transfer}} of angular momentum between the electron spin and the local magnetic moments, is a promising and key mechanism to control ferromagnetic materials in modern spintronic devices. However, much less {{attention has been paid}} to the same effect in antiferromagnets. For the sake of investigating how the spin current interacts with the magnetic moments in antiferromagnets, we perform spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance measurements on Co 20 Fe 60 B 20 4 nm/Ir 25 Mn 75 tIrMn nm/Pt 4 nm multilayers under a spin Hall effect of Pt. The effective magnetic damping in Co 20 Fe 60 B 20 is modified by the spin current injected from the Pt layer via the IrMn layer. The results indicate that the spin current interacts with IrMn magnetic moments and exerts the <b>anti-damping</b> torque on the magnetic moments of Co 20 Fe 60 B 20 through the IrMn. It is also found that the reduction of the exchange bias in the IrMn/Pt interface degrades the <b>anti-damping</b> torque exerted on the Co 20 Fe 60 B 20 layer, suggesting the transmission of the spin torque becomes less efficient as the interface exchange coupling degrades. Our work infers that the magnetic moments in IrMn can be manipulated by spin torque similarly to the one in a ferromagnetic layer...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the skyrmion {{velocity}} {{in the presence}} of spin-transfer torques, Rashba spin-orbit coupling and a constant electric field gradient is derived analytically based on a collective coordinate approach in the Thiele formalism. This analytical result is also derived {{in the presence of}} a phenomenological pinning force. The results show that the spin-orbit coupling can be effectively considered as a modification of the non-adiabatic spin-transfer torque. The electric field gradient causes a motion of the skyrmion along equipotential lines, in addition to a damped motion in the opposite direction of the gradient to a lower energy state. The analytical calculations are compared to a full numerical solution of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. We also study the effects of Rashba spin-orbit coupling on magnetic multilayer spin torque oscillators. It is discovered that the spin-orbit coupling can be compared to a modification of the Gilbert damping, to the extent that we can get an <b>anti-damping</b> term in the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski equation. This <b>anti-damping</b> term can help destabilize collinear states, and increase the size of the oscillating phase. Moreover, we find an oscillating phase in both ferromagnetically and antiferromagnetically coupled magnetic moments, where the moments are of equal magnitude, which is a new result.

Spin torques display both characteristics of magnetic damping (or <b>anti-damping)</b> and of an effective magnetic field. For a steady-state current, both M-I and M-H hysteresis loops show unique features, including multiple jumps, unusual plateaus and precessional states. These states originate from the competition between the energy dissipation due to Gilbert damping and the energy accumulation due to the spin torque supplied by the spin current.

The equivalency of optical and transport measurements is established by investigating a heavy-metal/ferromagnetic-metal device (Ta/CoFeB/MgO).
