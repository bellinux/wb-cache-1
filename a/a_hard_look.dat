However, many analysts believe that Obama's loss helped him to learn from his mistakes, which enabled him to run more successful campaigns in 2004 and 2008. [...] Obama {{was seen as a}} stiff policy wonk, and he used the experience to hone his ability to connect with voters. [...] According to Chicago City Council member Toni Preckwinkle, an early Obama supporter, Obama [...] "took <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>look</b> at himself after that campaign and became a much better campaigner, more at ease on the campaign trail." [...] He put more effort into his campaign, hiring David Axelrod as his chief political strategist. Also, Obama increased his focus on the Illinois Senate, improving his legislative accomplishments.|$|E

That compelled them to [...] "take <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>look</b> at the examinations" [...] to determine whether certifying the results would have had an impermissible disparate impact. The problem for respondents is that a prima facie case of disparate-impact liability— essentially, a threshold showing of a significant statistical disparity, and nothing more— {{is far from a}} strong basis in evidence that the City would have been liable under Title VII had it certified the results. That is because the City could be liable for disparate-impact discrimination only if the examinations were not job related and consistent with business necessity, or if there existed an equally valid, less-discriminatory alternative that served the City's needs but that the City refused to adopt. §2000e–2(k)(1)(A), (C).

His design was described as [...] "No frills, no scarfs, no messing, just 100% rebel Time Lord." [...] Capaldi said that the costume {{took a long time}} to find. The reason he settled on his final costume was because, [...] "I think it's quite <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>look.</b> I always wanted him to be in black – I always just saw the Doctor in dark colours. Not tweed," [...] in reference to his immediate predecessor's original costume. [...] "Matt's a really young cool guy – he can wear anything, but I wanted to strip it back and be very stark." [...] He also described it as [...] "back to basics." [...] Moffat described the look as [...] "A stick-insect sort of thing". He also said that Clara calls him [...] "a grey-haired stick-insect at one point". Capaldi also stated that he chose the Twelfth Doctor's costume so fans of the show who enjoy cosplay could easily emulate it without going to great expense. Writing for Radio Times, fashion columnist Anna Fielding described it as [...] "a classic early skinhead look" [...] and linked it to Capaldi's history as a punk musician.|$|E

2500|$|The revelation had {{a ripple}} effect, causing both more {{criticism}} about {{the responsibilities of}} notified bodies and the regulatory process in general and more corrective action. The Central Management Committee was created in September 2010 [...] "to develop {{the effectiveness of the}} regulatory system on medical devices in the E.U. by improving decision making among the national regulatory authorities." [...] Then in February 2012, European Health and Consumer Policy Commissioner John Dalli called upon E.U. member states to take <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>look</b> at the regulatory system, including how notified bodies play a part. His recommendations included properly verifying whether a notified body is capable of accurately assessing medical devices, improving how conformity assessments are conducted, and developing tools to enhance medical device traceability. The European Commission acted, that September revealing its proposed changes to medical device regulation, including expanded requirements on notified bodies, to be published in 2014 and go into effect in 2017. However, the Commission also opted to instate additional reforms — separate from its draft regulations — that would go into effect much sooner, asking notified bodies to perform unannounced visits to manufacturers and expand their device testing standards. At the same time the NB-MED (European Forum of Notified Bodies Medical Devices) coordination revised their Code of Conduct due to criticism.|$|E
