Kinkaid convinced the captain to allow homeless families of crew members to stay on the ship, and erected tarpaulins on the quayside to create family areas. He sent medical and relief supplies ashore from Colorado.|$|E

5|$|On 1 August 1798 a British {{fleet of}} 13 ships {{of the line}} and one fourth rate ship under Rear-Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson {{discovered}} a French fleet of 13 ships {{of the line and}} four frigates at <b>anchor</b> <b>in</b> Aboukir Bay on the Mediterranean coast of Egypt. Nelson had been in pursuit of the French for three months, crossing the Mediterranean three times in his efforts to locate the fleet and a convoy under its protection which carried the French army commanded by Napoleon Bonaparte intended for the invasion of Egypt. The convoy successfully eluded Nelson and the army landed at Alexandria on 31 June, capturing the city and advancing inland. The fleet was too large to <b>anchor</b> <b>in</b> Alexandria harbour and instead Bonaparte ordered its commander, Vice-Admiral François-Paul Brueys D'Aigalliers to take up station in Aboukir Bay.|$|E

30|$|Zhang et al. (2001) {{summarized}} {{the results of}} a comprehensive study of <b>anchors</b> <b>in</b> cracked and uncracked concrete led by Dr. Klingner at the University of Taxes, Austin in 1990 s. The tests focused on expansion anchors and undercut anchors that are of interest by nuclear industries. Groups of four anchors were subjected to cyclic moments at a rate similar to that in an earthquake. The tests indicated that the cracks up to 0.25  mm [0.01 in.] did not affect the capacity of tested undercut anchors but caused larger displacements at failure. Meanwhile, the expansion <b>anchors</b> <b>in</b> cracks developed low capacity and in some cases the failure modes changed from concrete breakout (for <b>anchors</b> <b>in</b> uncracked concrete) to pull-out (for <b>anchors</b> <b>in</b> cracked concrete).|$|R

5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the festivities in the United States, Seeadler steamed back across the Atlantic to the Azores, before proceeding into the Mediterranean Sea and then into the Red Sea. There, she met Schwalbe at Aden on 20 June. Seeadler proceeded to Bombay, India, for routine maintenance that lasted from 3 July to 21 August. The cruiser finally arrived on station on 2 September when she dropped <b>anchor</b> <b>in</b> Zanzibar and met the survey ship , the other vessel on the East Africa Station. On 9 September both ships went to Kilwa; a group of slave traders had attacked the small police force detachment stationed there. The colonial army, the Schutztruppe (protection force), was unavailable to reinforce the police troops, and so Seeadler and Möwe bombarded the slavers and neutralized the threat.|$|E
5|$|As Caroline neared Batavia, Phoenix {{entered the}} well-defended harbour, making further pursuit impossible. However, Rainier then sighted a second frigate, lying at <b>anchor</b> <b>in</b> Batavia Roads, {{accompanied}} {{only by the}} 14-gun corvette William, the elusive brig Zee-Ploeg, and the 18-gun ship Patriot {{that belonged to the}} Dutch East India Company. Prisoners from Zeerop identified this ship as the 36-gun Maria Riggersbergen under Captain Claas Jager. Although this force was significantly stronger than Caroline, and could call on the support of approximately 30 gunboats anchored closer inshore, Rainier immediately gave orders to advance on the Dutch frigate. In his preparations for battle, Rainier ordered that springs be placed on his anchor cables, giving his ship the ability to easily turn at anchor to face new threats once engaged with the Maria Riggersbergen.|$|E
5|$|Despite its {{strategic}} importance, the castle and the defences of the Thames and Medway were badly neglected during the 17th century. The Dutch Republic mounted an unexpected naval raid in June 1667, and the Dutch fleet {{was able to}} breach the defences, capturing two warships and burning others at <b>anchor</b> <b>in</b> the river at Chatham, {{in one of the}} worst defeats suffered by the Royal Navy. Upnor Castle acquitted itself better than many of the other defensive sites along the upper Medway, despite its lack of provisioning. Gun fire from the fort and from adjoining emplacements forced a Dutch retreat after a couple of days, before they were able to burn the dockyard itself.|$|E

5|$|He {{returned}} {{as one of}} World News Tonights three anchors in 1978, and was promoted {{to the role of}} sole <b>anchor</b> <b>in</b> 1983. Jennings was also known for his marathon coverage of breaking news stories, staying on the air for 15 or more hours straight to anchor the live broadcast of events such as the outbreak of the Gulf War in 1991, the Millennium celebrations in 2000, and the September 11 attacks in 2001. In addition to anchoring, he was the host of many ABC News special reports and moderated several American presidential debates. Jennings was always fascinated with the United States and became a naturalized United States citizen in 2003.|$|E
5|$|However, Glasgow was now {{exposed to}} fire from three ships, so Howe decided to break off the battle, {{in order to avoid}} being boarded, and made sail for Newport. Despite {{extensive}} damage to the sail and rigging, he pulled away from the pursuing fleet, which was fully laden with its captured goods. Hopkins called off the chase after several hours in order to avoid an encounter with the British squadron at Newport. His only prize was Glasgow tender, which the fleet brought to <b>anchor</b> <b>in</b> New London, Connecticut on April 8.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, the Norwegian Troop of No. 10 (Inter-Allied), No. 12, and No. 14 (Arctic) Commandos {{assisted}} the Royal Navy {{in carrying out}} anti–shipping raids in Norwegian coastal waters. The Commandos provided extra firepower for the navy Motor Torpedo Boats when they were at sea and acted as a guard force when they were at <b>anchor</b> <b>in</b> the Norwegian fjords. In April 1943, seven men of No. 14 (Arctic) Commando {{took part in a}} raid on German shipping near Haugesund code named Operation Checkmate. They managed to sink several ships using limpet mines, but were captured and eventually taken to Sachsenhausen and Bergen-Belsen concentration camps, where they were executed.|$|E

None of these mishaps, however, were considered serious or unusual. Freshwater ships were built to last more than half a century, and Fitzgerald should still have had a long career ahead of her when she sank.|$|E

By 1797, the mission boasted the largest native population in Alta California, with over 1,400 neophytes living in and around the mission proper. Mission San Diego was the southern <b>anchor</b> <b>in</b> California of the historic mission trail El Camino Real. Both the Presidio and the Mission are National Historic Landmarks.|$|E

A short time later, a second rocket hit nearby and more fragments pelted the ship, this time damaging the starboard {{side of the ship}} at the number one cargo hold. Although Timothy Bloodworth had a total of 68 people aboard—8 officers, 33 crewmen, 26 Armed Guard, and 1 passenger—no one was injured in either attack. Authors Benjamin King and Timothy J.
