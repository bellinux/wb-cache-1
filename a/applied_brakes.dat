50|$|In the {{earliest}} days of railways, trains were slowed or stopped by the application of manually <b>applied</b> <b>brakes</b> on the locomotive and in brake vehicles through the train, and later by steam power brakes on locomotives. This was clearly unsatisfactory, but the existing technology did not offer an improvement. A chain braking system was developed, requiring a chain to be coupled throughout the train, but it was impossible to arrange equal braking effort along the entire train.|$|E

50|$|Both {{power off}} brakes are {{considered}} to be engaged when no power is applied to them. They are typically required to hold or to stop alone {{in the event of a}} loss of power or when power is not available in a machine circuit. Permanent magnet brakes have a very high torque for their size, but also require a constant current control to offset the permanent magnetic field. Spring <b>applied</b> <b>brakes</b> do not require a constant current control, they can use a simple rectifier, but are larger in diameter or would need stacked friction disks to increase the torque.|$|E
5000|$|Power off brakes stop or hold a load when {{electrical}} power is either accidentally lost or intentionally disconnected. In the past, {{some companies have}} referred to these as [...] "fail safe" [...] brakes. These brakes are typically used on or near an electric motor. Typical applications include robotics, holding brakes for Z axis ball screws and servo motor brakes. Brakes are available in multiple voltages and can have either standard backlash or zero backlash hubs. Multiple disks {{can also be used}} to increase brake torque, without increasing brake diameter. There are 2 main types of holding brakes. The first is spring <b>applied</b> <b>brakes.</b> The second is permanent magnet brakes.|$|E
50|$|Since {{it was not}} {{possible}} to remotely control a steam locomotive, each helper had to have a full crew on board. Careful coordination was required between engine crews to assure that all locomotives were operated in a consistent manner. Standard whistle signals were employed to tell the helper crew when to apply power, drift or brake. A misunderstanding of signals by a pusher locomotive crew could result in a major wreck if the lead locomotive <b>applied</b> <b>brakes</b> while the bank engine was still applying power. The usual result was that the train would experience a violent run-in (an abrupt bunching of train slack), resulting in the derailment of part or all of the train.|$|E

5000|$|The {{automatic}} vacuum brake. This {{system was}} similar to the simple vacuum system, except that the creation of vacuum in the train pipe exhausted vacuum reservoirs on every vehicle and released the brakes. If the driver <b>applied</b> the <b>brake,</b> his driver's brake valve admitted atmospheric air to the train pipe, and this atmospheric pressure <b>applied</b> the <b>brakes</b> against the vacuum in the vacuum reservoirs. Being an automatic <b>brake,</b> this system <b>applies</b> <b>braking</b> effort if the train becomes divided or if the train pipe is ruptured. Its disadvantage is that the large vacuum reservoirs were required on every vehicle, and their bulk and the rather complex mechanisms were seen as objectionable.|$|R

50|$|Catch points {{originate}} {{from the days}} of the 'unfitted' goods train. As these trains tended to consist of either completely unbraked wagons (relying entirely on the locomotive's own brakes), or ones with unlinked, manually <b>applied</b> <b>brakes</b> (necessitating a stop at the top of steep downgrades for the guard to walk along the train and set the brakes on each wagon in turn), they also lacked any mechanism to automatically brake runaway cars. Catch points were therefore required to stop the rear portion of a poorly coupled train that might break away whilst climbing a steep grade - although they would also stop vehicles that ran away for any other reason. Now that trains are all 'fitted' (and broken couplings are far less common), catch points are mostly obsolete.|$|E

40|$|In {{co-operation}} with {{an industrial}} manufacturer of brake systems (Mayr-Antriebstechnik) DLR has investigated new designs of Ceramic Matrix Composites (CMC) {{for their use}} in high performance emergency brake systems in fields of mechanical engineering and conveying. These electromagnetic spring <b>applied</b> <b>brakes</b> for braking or holding loads, operate as important safety elements {{in case of a}} power failure or an emergency "OFF" situation. The brake system consists of a rotating and two stationary brake disks similar to the heat pack of aircraft brakes. Increasing drive and higher circumferential velocities in modern power transmission necessitate new concepts for emergency brake systems. Conventional emergency brakes with metallic disks and organic friction linings are inapplicable for extreme power input due to the insufficient thermal stability of these braking materials. The use of Carbon/Carbon composites (C/C) for high performance and extremely weight sensitive brake systems is state-of-the-art for aircraft and racing cars. However, C/C composites show high wear rates and an instability of their coefficient of friction caused by humidity and temperature. Long manufacturing times, multiple reinfiltration steps and expensive raw materials lead to very high prices for the finished C/C brake disks. These disadvantages have prevented their application in commercial brake systems like vehicles or mechanical engineering components. By using CMC brake disks, these technical disadvantages of C/C can be avoided and the efficiency and the lifetime of emergency brake systems can be increased. These so called C/C-SiC composites offer high coefficients of friction and low wear rates even at temperatures above 1000 Â°C. Due to the high friction energy and the resulting high temperatures while braking, the conventional construction of the emergency brake system was modified and adapted to the new C/C-SiC braking material. In various screening tests, different C/C-SiC qualities were tested to get the best compromise of friction and wear behaviour. Presently, emergency brake systems equipped with these new materials are being tested in field trials. In summary, the paper presents the successful development of new C/C-SiC composite materials for a commercial application by substituting conventional materials and the adaption of the brake system to the new requirements, resulting in an advanced braking system of improved tribological characteristics for high performance applications...|$|E
