5|$|On 3 September 1993, a Coroner's inquest {{was held}} at Lowestoft, and the hoard was {{declared}} <b>a</b> <b>treasure</b> <b>trove,</b> meaning that it was deemed to have been hidden {{with the intention of}} being recovered at a later date. Under English common law, anything declared as such belongs to the Crown if no one claims title to it. However, at the time, the customary practice was to reward anyone who found and reported <b>a</b> <b>treasure</b> <b>trove</b> promptly with money equivalent to the market value of the treasure, with the money being provided by the national institution that wished to acquire the treasure. In November 1993, the Treasure Trove Reviewing Committee valued the hoard at £1.75 million (today £), which was paid to Lawes, as finder of the treasure. He shared his reward with the farmer, Peter Whatling. Three years later, the 1996 Treasure Act was enacted, which allowed for the finder, tenant and landowner to share in any reward.|$|E

25|$|Forman's {{papers have}} proven to be <b>a</b> <b>treasure</b> <b>trove</b> of rare, odd, unusual data {{on one of the most}} studied periods of {{cultural}} history. They include autobiographies, guides to astrology, plague tracts, alchemical commonplace books and notes on biblical and historical subjects. They also contain his disputes with the Company of Barber-Surgeons and his largely unsuccessful magical experiments. At one time he possessed the copy of the Picatrix currently in the British Library. Forman left behind a large body of manuscripts dealing with his patients and with all the subjects that interested him, from astronomy and astrology to medicine, mathematics, and magic. His Casebook is the most famous of these resources, though he also produced diaries and a third-person autobiography. His only printed work was a pamphlet advertising a bogus method for divining the longitude while at sea.|$|E
25|$|The 'Reed' {{company name}} {{continued}} {{into the twentieth century}} long after Charles Reed's death, though under the proprietorship of Stephenson Blake & Co. who had bought Reed's business interests. At one time Reed's had been the larger of the two firms but it had difficulties in financing a modernisation programme as typography changed, and its once valuable equipment became out of date. Indeed, Stephenson Blake's acquisition was thought at the time to be very generous as it looked to be buying little other than the Reed's name and reputation. Not long after, however, thorough cataloguing of Reed's typefaces proved to be <b>a</b> <b>treasure</b> <b>trove.</b> Designs such as the Clarendon typeface, which Charles Reed had originally acquired from Robert Besley & Sons of the Fann Street foundry, became very marketable once re-cast using new technology. Several of Reed's typefaces are now available for use in font collections on our computers, such as Clarendon, which is now owned by a German company (as a trademark of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG licensed through Linotype Library GmbH, a wholly owned subsidiary of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG).|$|E

500|$|In the 1950s {{and early}} 1960s EMI {{generally}} made its British recordings with the Royal Philharmonic and Philharmonia orchestras; the LSO's recordings were chiefly for Decca, including a Sibelius symphony cycle with Anthony Collins, French music under Monteux, early recordings by Solti, {{and a series}} of Britten's major works, conducted by the composer. Of the later 1960s Jolly writes, [...] "Istvan Kertész's three-year Principal Conductorship has left <b>a</b> <b>treasure</b> <b>trove</b> of memorable and extraordinarily resilient recordings – the Dvořák symphonies are still competitive... and his classic disc of Bartók's Duke Bluebeard's Castle admirably demonstrates what a superb ensemble the LSO were under his baton." ...|$|E
500|$|The puzzles, {{according}} to Broady, were of uneven quality. He called some [...] "hopelessly difficult" [...] and others extremely derivative.

[...] Ramsey thought the puzzles were challenging but not overly difficult, arguing [...] "on almost every occasion I felt that I was making progress, and I never felt bogged down and hopelessly lost." [...] He felt the puzzles were mostly well-integrated, and found those that were not did not detract from his enjoyment. Ivey remarked, [...] "For puzzle lovers, Drowned God is <b>a</b> <b>treasure</b> <b>trove.</b> ... This collection of tricky puzzlers are challenging and frequently innovative." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Rich Girl" [...] was {{directed}} by David LaChapelle and features a pirate theme. The video, inspired by an early-1980s Vivienne Westwood advertising campaign, opens with four Japanese schoolgirls playing with a toy pirate ship and two Bratz dolls of Stefani and Eve, while the girls discuss {{what they would do}} if they were a [...] "rich girl". The video features several sequences. Stefani is first shown below the deck of a pirate ship, dancing on a table and singing to the song. She is surrounded by pirates and [...] and is soon joined by Eve, wearing an eyepatch. In the surreal style of LaChapelle, the pirate crew has distorted features, and a leaked casting call commented, [...] "I need the freaks on this one." [...] Above deck Stefani, the Harajuku Girls, Eve, and more pirates dance on the deck and rigging. Stefani is also seen dancing with the Harajuku Girls in <b>a</b> <b>treasure</b> <b>trove,</b> often carrying a sword, and swinging from an anchor. When the girls dunk the toy ship in a fish tank, the galleon engages in cannon fire, causing Stefani and the pirates to fall all over the ship, and Stefani and the Harajuku Girls are soon shipwrecked.|$|E

Glenn McCarty of Crosswalk.com said that [...] "As always, Third Day plays to its strength... to craft accessible, {{interesting}} country rock. When it clicks, the result is arm-hair-raising good. Move, unfortunately, doesn't produce that reaction often enough... Move feels a little too safe, or, said another way, a little too static". Lindsay Williams of Gospel Music Channel said that [...] "Move may not be Third Day’s best effort in their large discography, but it’s certainly <b>a</b> <b>treasure</b> <b>trove</b> of hooky rock. After more than 15 years, this band still has something to say, {{and they say it}} well". John DiBiase of Jesus Freak Hideout gave the album four-and-a-half out of five stars, opining [...] "Move showcases some of the best Third Day has to offer. Whether it's better than Revelation or some of their other previous installments (like Wire or Conspiracy No. 5) is something to leave up to the listener to decide, but it does feel safe enough to say that Third Day's Move is a dozen tracks of southern rock goodness". Brian Mansfield of USA Today gave the album two-and-a-half out of four stars, saying [...] "Whether accompanied by sharp-edged electric or slippery resonator guitars, a kids choir or the Blind Boys of Alabama, Third Day's Southern rock remains grounded in the band's faith".|$|E
