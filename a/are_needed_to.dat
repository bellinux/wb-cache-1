5|$|The {{higher the}} sugar {{content of the}} sap, the fewer the gallons of sap <b>are</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> obtain one gallon of syrup. 57 gallons of sap with 1.5% sugar content will yield 1 gallon of syrup, but only 25 gallons of sap with a 3.5% sugar content <b>are</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> obtain one gallon of syrup. The sap's sugar content is highly {{variable}} and will fluctuate even within the same tree.|$|E

5|$|A {{diagnosis}} of psoriasis is usually {{based on the}} appearance of the skin. Skin characteristics typical for psoriasis are scaly, erythematous plaques, papules, or patches of skin that may be painful and itch. No special blood tests or diagnostic procedures <b>are</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> make the diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Bronchopulmonary {{dysplasia}} is reversible in {{the early}} stages by use of break periods on lower pressures of oxygen, but it may eventually result in irreversible lung injury if allowed to progress to severe damage. One or two days of exposure without oxygen breaks <b>are</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> cause such damage.|$|E
5|$|Experimental robots {{have had}} the same inspiration, in {{particular}} when heavy loads <b>are</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> be carried in tight areas involving turns and curves. In biology, some authors have advocated millipedes as model organisms for the study of arthropod physiology and the developmental processes controlling the number and shape of body segments.|$|E
50|$|Rabbit warrens {{were almost}} entirely H0e or 00-9. Their small {{dimensions}} and tight curves required a narrow gauge.

5|$|Normally, {{an ocean}} {{temperature}} of 26.5°C (79.7°F) spanning {{through at least}} a 50-metre depth is considered the minimum to maintain a tropical cyclone. These warm waters <b>are</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> maintain the warm core that fuels tropical systems. This value is well above 16.1°C (60.9°F), the global average surface temperature of the oceans.|$|E
5|$|Some hemipterans {{are used}} to produce dyestuffs such as carmine (also called cochineal). The scale insect Dactylopius coccus {{produces}} the brilliant red-coloured carminic acid to deter predators. Up to 100,000 scale insects <b>are</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> make a kilogram (2.2lbs) of cochineal dye.|$|E

5|$|A {{declared}} vulnerable species, {{it occurs}} in two disjunct populations on granite outcrops along the south coast of Western Australia, with the main population near Albany and a smaller population near Walpole, and is threatened by dieback (Phytophthora cinnamomi) and aerial canker (Zythiostroma). B. verticillata is killed by bushfire and new plants regenerate from seed afterwards. Populations take over a decade to produce seed and fire intervals of greater than twenty years <b>are</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> allow the canopy seed bank to accumulate.|$|E
5|$|A {{similarly}} {{enormous number}} of lac bugs <b>are</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> make a kilogram of shellac, a brush-on colourant and wood finish. Additional uses of this traditional product include the waxing of citrus fruits to extend their shelf-life, and the coating of pills to moisture-proof them, provide slow-release or mask the taste of bitter ingredients.|$|E
5|$|A {{survey in}} 2005 of 88 {{paediatric}} neurologists in the US found that 36% regularly prescribed the diet after {{three or more}} drugs had failed; 24% occasionally prescribed the diet as a last resort; 24% had only prescribed the diet in a few rare cases; and 16% had never prescribed the diet. There are several possible explanations for this gap between evidence and clinical practice. One major factor may be the lack of adequately trained dietitians, who <b>are</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> administer a ketogenic diet programme.|$|E

One can switch abilities, which have multiple uses. There are also things only a certain character can do.

5|$|Aikido {{techniques}} are usually {{a defense against}} an attack, so students must learn to deliver various types of attacks {{to be able to}} practice aikido with a partner. Although attacks are not studied as thoroughly as in striking-based arts, sincere attacks (a strong strike or an immobilizing grab) <b>are</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> study correct and effective application of technique.|$|E
5|$|As 91 votes <b>are</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> elect the Governor {{from the}} 180-member body and Democrats and Progressives held 112 seats, it was {{considered}} unlikely that Milne would win. Milne argued that legislators should decide the election in line with how their individual districts voted. Neal Goswami of the Vermont Press Bureau calculated that if each legislator voted according to the results in their district, the vote {{would result in a}} 90–90 tie. Milne disagreed with this calculation and claimed voting according to district outcome would result in his winning 93–87.|$|E
5|$|Biochemistry {{laboratories}} {{often use}} {{in vitro studies}} to explore ATP-dependent molecular processes. Enzyme inhibitors of ATP-dependent enzymes such as kinases <b>are</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> examine the binding sites and transition states involved in ATP-dependent reactions. ATP analogs are also used in X-ray crystallography to determine a protein structure in complex with ATP, often together with other substrates.|$|E

5|$|Selenium {{interacts with}} other nutrients, such as iodine and vitamin E. The effect of {{selenium}} deficiency on health remains uncertain, particularly {{in relation to}} Kashin-Beck disease. Also, selenium interacts with other minerals, such as zinc and copper. High doses of Se supplements in pregnant animals might disturb the Zn:Cu ratio and lead to Zn reduction; in such treatment cases, Zn levels should be monitored. Further studies <b>are</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> conﬁrm these interactions.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the main}} reasons that girls are less likely to reach optimal levels of {{education}} include the fact that girls <b>are</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> assist their mothers at home, have been raised to believe that a life of domestic work is their destined occupation, have illiterate mothers who cannot educate their children, have an economic dependency on men, and are sometimes subject to child-marriage. Many poor families marry their daughters off early to get the dowry money so she is unable to complete her education.|$|E
5|$|Spock's father, Sarek (Mark Lenard), confronts Kirk {{about his}} son's death. The pair learn that before he died, Spock {{transferred}} his katra, or living spirit, to McCoy.
