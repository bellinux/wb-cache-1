Using her tricks from the night Neal broke into the amusement park, Emma remembers {{she knows how to}} break a lock by using two spoons, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>works.</b> Later on, Charming catches Snow in the rope trap, although the timeline of their introduction is thrown off, until Hook shows up to say that another woman (Emma) has his ring. Charming looks at Snow's fairy dust pendant while she tells him her backstory (another timeline that was thrown off), and comes {{up with a plan to}} break into Regina’s castle first, then rescue Emma and steal back the ring. Snow tells them to wait, which gives Hook and Charming time to talk about love. Moments later, Red Riding Hood shows up, revealing herself as a friend of Snow's, and who can get them into the castle. As they reach the place, Red, who transformed into a wolf, scares a guard into running away, but the escape plan goes awry when they run into Emma and her fellow inmate, prompting Hook to tell Emma that she deprived him of a dashing rescue. Seconds later, Snow and Regina prepare to face off, with Snow throwing her dark fairy dust, but Regina uses her magic to stop it in midair. Snow tries telling her that what happened to Daniel (when she told Cora) was a mistake, saying that she was only a child, but an unforgiving Regina talks about consequences and sets up a stake to burn her. Regina throws a fireball at the helpless Snow White, who appears to die. Her death causes Red to howl as a wolf and Emma to cry over her mother's death.|$|E

Wild was released in December 2014 to critical acclaim; Michael Phillips of Chicago Tribune wrote in his review, [...] "Witherspoon does the least acting of her career, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>works.</b> Calmly yet restlessly, she brings to life Strayed's longings, her states of grief and desire and her wary optimism."

500|$|According to Tony Fletcher, Marquee Moon was {{difficult}} to categorize in 1977 and was hailed as [...] "something entirely original, a new dawn in rock music". Since then, it has been cited by rock critics {{as one of the}} greatest records of the American punk rock movement, with Mark Weingarten of Entertainment Weekly calling it the masterpiece of the 1970s New York punk rock scene. According to English writer Clinton Heylin, Marquee Moon marked the end of the New York scene's peak period, while Spin said it was the CBGB era's [...] "best and most enduring record" [...] and ranked it as the sixth-greatest album of all time in its April 1989 issue.
