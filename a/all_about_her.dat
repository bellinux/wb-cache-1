500|$|Most {{critics were}} not {{impressed}} with the medley, comparing it to Aguilera's identity during the Bionic era. Tamar Anitai, also of MTV Buzzworthy summarized the performance saying it [...] "was <b>all</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> [...] "I-I'm-still-a-diva" [...] vocals, frenzied stage show, and adult-only innuendo...And then this happened." [...] She went on to comment also sarcastically, [...] "This is so just Christina Aguilera's way of saying she loves you! And that the diminutive diva still {{has a sense of}} humor....It's like a little knowing wink that assures you that when she's not changing diapers and doing mommy stuff, Mamaguilera's hanging out at dance party sex dungeons and wailing from the bottom of her light-up hoo-ha. She is DEFINITELY not the same girl who once bopped around on the Disney Channel in a Scrunchie." ...|$|E
500|$|On June 6, 2010, Aguilera {{performed}} [...] "Bionic" [...] for {{the first}} time at the 2010 MTV Movie Awards, held at Gibson Amphitheatre in Los Angeles, California. There, she sang the track as the introduction to [...] "Not Myself Tonight" [...] and [...] "Woohoo". During the performance of [...] "Bionic", she sported curly platinum hair and was dressed in a [...] "diamond-encrusted one-piece" [...] while sitting on a [...] "gilded throne". Caryn Ganz from Rolling Stone opined that the way Aguilera began the performance was similar to Madonna during the latter's Sticky & Sweet Tour (200809). Then, Aguilera walked on the stage and [...] "leather-clad" [...] back-up dancers in silver and black outfits began to perform a dance routine. The performance was met with mainly negative reviews and failed to gain impact from media outlets. Tamar Anitai for MTV Buzzworthy was not impressed toward her performance, summarizing it [...] "was <b>all</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> [...] "I-I'm-still-a-diva" [...] vocals, frenzied stage show, and adult-only innuendo... And then this happened". In a positive view, James Montgomery for MTV News praised her looking as [...] "a 23rd-century queen" [...] and the show [...] "got millions of people all hot and bothered".|$|E
500|$|Some {{suggest that}} Meyer is likely a Republican, while others feel {{she is a}} Democrat. Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times notes that Meyer's party {{affiliation}} is unknown because the show focuses on bullying and ego rather than ideology. James Poniewozik of Time explains the ambiguity as follows: Veep is [...] "almost all politics and almost no political issues". Robert Lloyd of Los Angeles Times explains the lack of need for party affiliations, or even political ideology in a similar manner, saying that Veep is [...] "less a show about politics than about politicking." [...] In an interview with The New Yorker Radio Hour, Julia Louis-Dreyfus suggested that Meyer's associated political party is intentionally left unknown to the audience. Louis-Dreyfus later elaborated: [...] " [...] politics are <b>all</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> and staying alive ... she will hold any position if it keeps her in office." [...] In the episode Election Night, CNN represents states won by Meyer as blue. In the same episode, she also comments winning the 'blue wall' states of Connecticut and Vermont with [...] "A bowl of hair could win those states".|$|E

500|$|Arnold Wayne Jones {{from the}} Dallas Voice gave the album {{four out of}} five stars, writing that the show [...] "has all of the Material Girl's majesty and fetishistic eroticism, merged with lots of disturbing, violent imagery and a huge catalog of songs". Jones {{concluded}} that Madonna was more provocative than before with the release. Chuck Campbell from The Republic gave the album three and a half stars out of five, writing that [...] "an ambitious woman like Madonna will not let herself become a nostalgia act". He added that Madonna makes that clear every time she goes on tour: [...] "she's living in the moment, and she's <b>all</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> newest material." [...] The Advocates review for the release was positive, saying that the DVD affirms the fact that Madonna's [...] "musical reign continues". Entertainment Focus Pip Ellwood felt that the highlights of the record were the live performances of [...] "Human Nature" [...] and [...] "Like a Prayer". He concluded the review by saying that [...] " [...] Making perfect use of her dancers, the video screens and the sets, the MDNA World Tour is one of [...] most spectacular to date and she still performs with the passion and the energy she always has done. If you went to the show then get your copy of this and treat it like a souvenir. If you didn't you need to check it out as it's one of the best shows she's ever done." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic awarded the release three out of five stars, saying that [...] "there are unexpected musical moments that do make MDNA World Tour worth hearing", including the performance of [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] and [...] "Like a Prayer". However, he felt that the CD release was unnecessary since the album would be a better experience with its video.|$|E

2500|$|... "Make Me" [...] {{was written}} by Janet Jackson, Rodney [...] "Darkchild" [...] Jerkins, Thomas Lumpkins, and Michaela Shiloh. Bernard Edwards and Nile Rodgers have also been {{credited}} as the song samples Fonzi Thornton's song [...] "I Work For A Livin'", written and produced by them for the 1982 Soup For One motion picture soundtrack. Darkchild, who produced music from Jackson's tenth studio album Discipline (2008), co-produced the song with her. He reported to MTV {{that he had been}} working on new material with Jackson since her departure from Island Records in September 2008. Of the new material, he commented, [...] "It's about dancing... It's <b>all</b> <b>about</b> <b>her.</b> It's about , 'Listen, {{if you really want to}} get with me, you gotta make me feel a certain way'... We're going back to basics and fundamental sounds of Janet. We're trying to target her fans [...] the records that her fans will embrace." [...] In October 2009, Universal Music Enterprises issued a press release stating [...] "Make Me" [...] would be included in Jackson's second greatest hits album, Number Ones, a compilation of her 33 global number one singles.|$|E

From the start, they [...] "click" [...] and become a devoted couple. Linda is well aware of Cole's gay identity and activities; her [...] "ex" [...] was the same but violent with her. Cole is completely different, she declares on their wedding day - he loves and adores her and shows it, so she tolerates his dalliances. Her love for and devotion to him are strong enough for her to overlook his romantic flings outside their marriage. With Linda his fun with music turns into a top international career. Their lavish lifestyle is enviable worldwide. At film's end he tells her the songs were <b>all</b> <b>about</b> <b>her</b> - [...] "not all" [...] she corrects - but enough of them. The leaders in music praise his work and his amazing shows begin. Linda begins a tradition for his show opening nights - a Cartier cigarette case custom designed and engraved to commemorate each show, but almost misses one of his openings herself due to miscarriage and they remain childless.|$|E
