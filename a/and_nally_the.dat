40|$|ABSTRACT. Modify the {{scatterer}} conguration of a planar, nite-horizon Lorentz {{process in}} a bounded domain. Sinai asked in 1981 whether for the diffusively scaled variant of the modied process convergence to Brownian motion still holds. The main re-sult of the work answers Sinai's question in the afrmative. Other types of local perturbations are also investigated: nite horizon periodic Lorentz process in the half-strip or in the half-plane (in these models the local perturbation is the boundary condition) and nally nite horizon, periodic Lorentz process with a small, compactly supported external eld in the strip. The correspond-ing limiting processes are Brownian motions with suitable bound-ary conditions <b>and</b> <b>nally</b> <b>the</b> skew Brownian motion on the line.
