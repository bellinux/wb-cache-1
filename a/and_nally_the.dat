40|$|ABSTRACT. Modify the {{scatterer}} conguration of a planar, nite-horizon Lorentz {{process in}} a bounded domain. Sinai asked in 1981 whether for the diffusively scaled variant of the modied process convergence to Brownian motion still holds. The main re-sult of the work answers Sinai's question in the afrmative. Other types of local perturbations are also investigated: nite horizon periodic Lorentz process in the half-strip or in the half-plane (in these models the local perturbation is the boundary condition) and nally nite horizon, periodic Lorentz process with a small, compactly supported external eld in the strip. The correspond-ing limiting processes are Brownian motions with suitable bound-ary conditions <b>and</b> <b>nally</b> <b>the</b> skew Brownian motion on the line.

The tradeoff between speed/throughput and exibility can be eased by programmable crypto architectures. These can be existing general purpose architectures enhanced by specialized functional units which fulll the requirements of typical cryptographic algorithms. Alternatively, a fully custom architecture can be designed. In this paper we describe the methods used to design a programmable crypto ar-chitecture from scratch.
