40|$|The {{histories}} of the two <b>swine</b> <b>fevers</b> in southern Africa differ widely. <b>Classical</b> <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> (hog cholera) has been known in the northern hemisphere since 1830 and {{it is probable that}} early cases of ‘swine fever’ in European settlers’ pigs in southern Africa were accepted to be that disease. It was only in 1921 that the first description of African <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> as an entity different from <b>classical</b> <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> was published after the disease had been studied in settlers’ pigs in Kenya. Shortly after that, reports of African <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> in settlers’ pigs emerged from South Africa and Angola. In South Africa, the report related to pigs in the north-eastern part of the country. Previously (in 1905 or earlier) a disease assumed to be <b>classical</b> <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> caused high mortality among pigs in the Western Cape and was only eradicated in 1918. African <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> was found over the following years to be endemic in most southern <b>African</b> countries. <b>Classical</b> <b>swine</b> <b>fever,</b> however, apart from an introduction with subsequent endemic establishment in Madagascar and a number of introductions into Mauritius, the last one in 2000, had apparently remained absent from the region until it was diagnosed in the Western and subsequently the Eastern Cape of South Africa in 2005. It was eradicated by 2007. The history of these diseases in the southern African region demonstrates their importance and their potential for spread over long distances, emphasising the need for improved management of both diseases wherever they occur.

40|$|Dysregulation of {{cytokine}} responses plays a {{major role}} in the pathogenesis of severe and life-threatening infectious diseases like septicemia or viral hemorrhagic fevers. In pigs, diseases like <b>African</b> and <b>classical</b> <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> are known to show exaggerated cytokine releases. To study these responses and their impact on disease severity and outcome in detail, reliable, highly specific and sensitive methods are needed. For cytokine research on the molecular level, real-time RT-PCRs have been proven to be suitable. Yet, the currently available and most commonly used SYBR Green I assays or heterogeneous gel-based RT-PCRs for swine show a significant lack of specificity and sensitivity. The latter is however absolutely essential for an accurate quantification of rare cytokine transcripts as well as for detection of small changes in gene expressions. For this reason, a harmonized TaqMan-based triplex real-time RT-PCR protocol for the quantitative detection of normalized gene expression profiles of seven porcine cytokines was designed and validated within the presented study. Cytokines were chosen to represent different immunological pathways and targets known to be involved in the pathogenesis of the above mentioned porcine diseases, namely interleukin (IL) - 1 β, IL- 2, IL- 4, IL- 6, IL- 8, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α and interferon (IFN) -α. Beta-Actin and glyceraldehyde 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) served as reference genes for normalization. For absolute quantification a synthetic standard plasmid was constructed comprising all target cytokines and reference genes within a single molecule allowing the generation of positive control RNA. The standard as well as positive RNAs from samples, and additionally more than 400 clinical samples, which were collected from animal trials, were included in the validation process to assess analytical sensitivity and applicability under routine conditions. The resulting assay allows the reliable assessment of gene expression profiles and provides a broad applicability to any kind of immunological research in swine...|$|R
40|$|Understanding the {{complexity}} of live pig trade organization is a key factor to predict and control major infectious diseases such as <b>Classical</b> or <b>African</b> <b>swine</b> <b>fever.</b> Whereas the organization of pig trade has been described in several European countries with indoor commercial production systems, little information is available on this organisation in other systems like outdoor or small-scale systems. The objective {{of this study was}} to describe and compare the spatial and functional organisation of live pig trade in different European countries and different production systems. Data on premise characteristics and pig movements between premises were collected during 2011 from Bulgaria, France, Italy and Spain, which swine industry is representative of most of the production systems in Europe (i. e. commercial vs small-scale; outdoor vs indoor). Trade communities were identified in each country using the Walktrap algorithm. Several descriptive and network metrics were generated at country and community level. Pig trade organization showed heterogeneous spatial and functional organization. Trade communities mostly composed of indoor commercial premises were identified in Western France, Northern Italy, Northern Spain and North-Western Bulgaria. They covered large distances, overlapped in space, demonstrated both scale-free and small-world properties, with a role of trade operators and multipliers as key premises. Trade communities involving outdoor commercial premises were identified in Western Spain, South-Western and Central France. They were more spatially clustered, demonstrated scale-free properties, with multipliers as key premises. Small-scale communities involved the majority of premises in Bulgaria and in central and Southern Italy. They were spatially clustered and had scale-free properties, with key premises usually being commercial production premises. These results indicate that a disease might spread very differently according to the production system and that key premises could be targeted to more cost-effectively control diseases. This study provides useful epidemiological information and parameters that could be used to design risk-based surveillance strategies or to more accurately model the risk of introduction or spread of devastating swine diseases such as <b>African</b> <b>swine</b> <b>fever,</b> <b>classical</b> <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> or foot-and-mouth disease.

40|$|In most European countries, data {{regarding}} movements of live animals are routinely collected and can greatly aid predictive epidemic modeling. However, {{the use of}} complete movements' dataset to conduct policy-relevant predictions has been so far limited by the massive amount of data {{that have to be}} processed (e. g., in intensive commercial systems) or the restricted availability of timely and updated records on animal movements (e. g., in areas where small-scale or extensive production is predominant). The aim {{of this study was to}} use exponential random graph models (ERGMs) to reproduce, understand, and predict pig trade networks in different European production systems. Three trade networks were built by aggregating movements of pig batches among premises (farms and trade operators) over 2011 in Bulgaria, Extremadura (Spain), and Côtes-d'Armor (France), where small-scale, extensive, and intensive pig production are predominant, respectively. Three ERGMs were fitted to each network with various demographic and geographic attributes of the nodes as well as six internal network configurations. Several statistical and graphical diagnostic methods were applied to assess the goodness of fit of the models. For all systems, both exogenous (attribute-based) and endogenous (network-based) processes appeared to govern the structure of pig trade network, and neither alone were capable of capturing all aspects of the network structure. Geographic mixing patterns strongly structured pig trade organization in the small-scale production system, whereas belonging to the same company or keeping pigs in the same housing system appeared to be key drivers of pig trade, in intensive and extensive production systems, respectively. Heterogeneous mixing between types of production also explained a part of network structure, whichever production system considered. Limited information is thus needed to capture most of the global structure of pig trade networks. Such findings will be useful to simplify trade networks analysis and better inform European policy makers on risk-based and more cost-effective prevention and control against swine diseases such as <b>African</b> <b>swine</b> <b>fever,</b> <b>classical</b> <b>swine</b> <b>fever,</b> or porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome.

In 2002, the Food and Health Department of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry asked the National Veterinary and Food Research Institute {{to carry out a}} risk assessment of the consequences of a possible <b>classical</b> <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> epidemic within Finnish territory. Models simulating the spread and detection of <b>classical</b> <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> were built and used to produce values with the help of which the final assessment figures were reached. According to the results it is unlikely that a <b>classical</b> <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> infection in a Finnish production pig farm would lead to an eruption of an epidemic; more than likely, the infection would remain an isolated, sporadic case. The probability of an epidemic outbreak in Finland is 0. 46 and the most likely source would be in the concentrated pig farm regions in South West Finland or South Ostrobothnia. Most probably, the epidemic would be contained to these regions leaving {{the rest of the country}} free of infection. Upon spreading, it is most likely that two to four farms would be infected.

40|$|<b>Classical</b> <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> is {{a highly}} {{contagious}} viral disease of swine and wild boar that leads to important economic losses. In Germany the abatement of the disease is regulated via a national decree, the so called "Schweinepest-Verordnung". This decree constitutes a general ban of vaccination against <b>classical</b> <b>swine</b> <b>fever.</b> In case of an outbreak of <b>classical</b> <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> emergency vaccination can be performed but only upon official approval of the authority. This control policy is at least partially {{based on the fact}} that there are currently no commercial vaccines available that combine the optimized protective qualities of an attenuated live vaccine with a functional labelling concept to differentiate infected from vaccinated animals. Therefore, the essential topic of this work was the identification and characterization of a promising <b>classical</b> <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> virus (CSFV) mutant that could possibly serve as candidate for a novel <b>classical</b> <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> virus DIVA (Differentiation between Infected and Vaccinated Animals) vaccine. As backbone for such a candidate we tested a CSFV double deletion mutant that combines two attenuating mutations: the deletion of the non-structural protein “Npro” coding region of the genome and the abrogation of the structural protein “Erns” (“envelope protein RNase secreted”) RNase acitivity. In an animal trial employing pregnant sows we were able to show that the <b>classical</b> <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> virus double deletion mutant proved completely apathogenic for adult animals, that it was able to induce significant titres of <b>classical</b> <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> virus specific neutralizing antibodies and that it was unable to establish persistent infection in the fetuses. In a next step, we established a negative labelling strategy using the highly conserved B-cell epitope TAVSPTTLRT (“TAV-epitope”) contained in the structural protein “E 2 ” (“envelope protein 2 ”) of <b>classical</b> <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> virus. We found out that the TAV-epitope mutations alone didn´t lead to an attenuated phenotype of the virus in the natural host, but remained stable and functional via animal passage. Furthermore, it proved possible to combine the TAV-epitope labelling with known attenuating mutations such as the above described double deletion. In conclusion, the TAV-epitope labelled CSFV double deletion mutant constitutes a promising candidate for a future DIVA live vaccine against <b>classical</b> <b>swine</b> <b>fever.</b> For the development of novel vaccines, knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying pathogen virulence is of great importance. In this context, structural protein “Erns” dimer formation as virulence factor of pestiviruses is a fascinating topic. In an animal experiment two different mutants in which the ability to generate “Erns” dimers was abrogated via mutation or deletion of cysteine 171 were tested. In addition, these variants were able to form “Erns” dimers via a newly introduced cystein codon at position 209. The finding of this experiment indicated that the location of “Erns” dimers is indeed linked to CSFV virulence. Since however variations were observed in this experiment for individual animals, the findings of this experiment were heterologous and have to be regarded as basis for future research in the matter of “Erns” dimerization...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background <b>Classical</b> <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> virus (CSFV) {{belongs to}} the genus Pestivirus within the family Flaviviridae. Virulent strains of <b>classical</b> <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> virus (CSFV) cause severe disease in pigs {{characterized}} by immunosuppression, thrombocytopenia and disseminated intravascular coagulation, which causes significant economic losses to the pig industry worldwide. Methods To reveal proteomic changes in swine serum during the acute stage of lethal CSFV infection, 5 of 10 pigs were inoculated with the virulent CSFV Shimen strain, the remainder serving as uninfected controls. A serum sample was taken at 3 days post-infection from each swine, at a stage {{when there were no}} clinical symptoms other than increased rectal temperatures (≥ 40 °C). The samples were treated to remove serum albumin and immunoglobulin (IgG), and then subjected to two-dimension differential gel electrophoresis. Results Quantitative intensity analysis revealed 17 protein spots showing at least 1. 5 -fold quantitative alteration in expression. Ten spots were successfully identified by MALDI-TOF MS or LTQ MS. Expression of 4 proteins was increased and 6 decreased in CSFV-infected pigs. Functions of these proteins included blood coagulation, anti-inflammatory activity and angiogenesis.

40|$|<b>Classical</b> <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> (CSF) is {{a highly}} {{contagious}} and economically significant viral disease of pigs. The severity of the illness varies with the strain of the virus, {{the age of the}} pig, and the immune status of the herd. Acute infections, which are caused by highly virulent isolates and have a high mortality rate in naive herds, are likely to be diagnosed rapidly. However, infections with less virulent isolates can be more difficult to recognize, particularly in older pigs. The range of clinical signs and similarity to other diseases can make <b>classical</b> <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> challenging to diagnose. Although <b>classical</b> <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> was once widespread, many countries have eradicated this disease from domesticated swine. Reintroduction of the virus can be devastating. In 1997 - 1998, an outbreak in the Netherlands spread to involve more than 400 herds and cost $ 2. 3 billion to eradicate. Approximately 12 million pigs were killed, some in eradication efforts but most for welfare reasons associated with the epidemic. Other European counties have also experienced outbreaks, and the ongoing presence of the virus among wild boar presents a risk of reintroduction to domesticated swine.

40|$|There are {{two types}} of <b>classical</b> <b>swine</b> <b>fever</b> {{vaccines}} available: the classical live and the recently developed E 2 subunit vaccines. The live Chinese strain vaccine is the most widely used. After a single vaccination, it confers solid immunity within a few days that appears to persist lifelong. The E 2 subunit vaccine induces immunity from approximately 10 ¿ 14 days after a single vaccination. The immunity may persist for more than a year, but is then not complete. The Chinese strain vaccine may establish a strong herd immunity 1 ¿ 2 weeks earlier than the E 2 vaccine. The ability of the Chinese vaccine strain to prevent congenital infection has not been reported, but the E 2 subunit vaccine does not induce complete protection against congenital infection. Immunological mechanisms that underlie the protective immunity are still to be elucidated. Both types of vaccine are considered to be safe. A great advantage of the E 2 subunit vaccine is that it allows differentiation of infected pigs from vaccinated pigs and is referred to as a DIVA vaccine.
