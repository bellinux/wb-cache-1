5|$|In August, Wartensleben's {{autonomous}} corps {{united with}} Charles' imperial troops <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> tide against the French. The defeat of Jourdan's army at the battles of Amberg (24 August), Würzburg (3 September) and 2nd Altenkirchen (16–19 September) allowed Charles {{to move more}} troops to the south, and effectively removed Jourdan from {{the remainder of the}} campaign.|$|E
5|$|The entire battle lasted {{approximately}} {{one to two}} hours. Maximilian took refuge in Byczyna, but the Poles took control of his artillery <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> guns on the town. Before the Polish forces began their assault, Maximilian surrendered and was taken prisoner. The battle, therefore, ended up being the decisive victory for the Polish-Swedish faction.|$|E
5|$|At Velfarre, she was {{introduced}} to her future producer, Max Matsuura, through a friend. After hearing Hamasaki sing karaoke, Matsuura offered her a recording deal, but Hamasaki suspected ulterior motives <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> offer down. He persisted and succeeded in recruiting her for the Avex label in the following year. Hamasaki started vocal training, but skipped most of her classes after finding her instructors to be too rigid and the classes dull. When she confessed this to Matsuura, he sent her to New York to train her vocals under another method. During her foreign sojourn, Hamasaki frequently corresponded with Matsuura and impressed him with her style of writing. On her return to Japan, he suggested that she try writing her own lyrics.|$|E

5|$|Continuous {{building}} and land acquisitions increased {{the size of}} the orphanage grounds to nearly 150 acres (600 dunam) by World War I. At the beginning of World War II, the British mandatory government deported the German teachers <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> compound into a closed military camp with the largest ammunition stockpile in the Middle East. On March 17, 1948, the British abandoned the camp and the Etzioni Brigade of the Haganah used it as a base of operations during the 1948 Israeli War of Independence. For the next 60 years the site served as an Israeli army base known as Camp Schneller. The army vacated the premises in 2008. As of 2011, the compound is being developed for luxury housing.|$|E
5|$|Following the punt, the {{two teams}} {{continued}} to trade possessions throughout the quarter. Defense dominated, and what few big plays occurred were either neutralized by penalties or stopped by incomplete passes or rushes for no gain. In the second quarter, Virginia Tech punted the ball twice <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> ball over on downs once. Florida State punted the ball three times and had the ball when time ran out in the quarter. Neither team managed to score, and only twice did either team manage to penetrate into the opponent's territory. At halftime, the score remained tied, 33.|$|E
5|$|Frederick William {{decided that}} he could gain little by {{continuing}} to battle the unexpectedly successful French forces, {{and that there were}} easier pickings for his army in the Kingdom of Poland. Accordingly, he stopped armed hostilities with the Republic <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> state prisoners back over to his erstwhile coalition partner, the Habsburg Austrian monarch FrancisII, Holy Roman Emperor. Lafayette and his companions were initially sent to Neisse (today Nysa, Poland) in Silesia. On 17 May 1794, they were taken across the Austrian border, where a military unit was waiting to receive them. The next day, the Austrians delivered their captives to a barracks-prison, formerly a college of the Jesuits, in the fortress-city of Olmütz, Moravia (today Olomouc in the Czech Republic).|$|E

5|$|In 1576, Stefan Batory became King of Poland {{as well as}} Grand Duke of Lithuania <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> tide of the {{war with}} his successes between 1578 and 1581, {{including}} the joint Swedish–Polish–Lithuanian offensive at the Battle of Wenden. This was followed by an extended campaign through Russia culminating in the long and difficult siege of Pskov. Under the 1582 Truce of Jam Zapolski, which ended the war between Russia and Poland–Lithuania, Russia lost all its former holdings in Livonia and Polotsk to Poland–Lithuania. The following year, Sweden and Russia signed the Truce of Plussa with Sweden gaining most of Ingria and northern Livonia while retaining the Duchy of Estonia.|$|E
5|$|In 682, Jasaw Chan K'awiil I erected {{the first}} dated {{monument}} at Tikal in 120 years and claimed {{the title of}} kaloomte, so ending the hiatus. He initiated a programme of new construction <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> tables on Calakmul when, in 695, he captured the enemy noble and threw the enemy state into a long decline from which it never fully recovered. After this, Calakmul never again erected a monument celebrating a military victory.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to connect her Cambodian-born son with his heritage, Jolie {{purchased}} a house in his country of birth in 2003. The traditional home sat on 39 hectares in the northwestern province Battambang, adjacent to Samlout national park in the Cardamom mountains, which had become infiltrated with poachers who threatened endangered species. She purchased the park's 60,000 hectares <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> area into a wildlife reserve named for her son, the Maddox Jolie Project. In recognition of her conservation efforts, King Norodom Sihamoni awarded her Cambodian citizenship on July 31, 2005.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the siege, Colonel John Carter was appointed governor of the castle and fresh repairs were carried out. In 1655 the Council of State appointed by Parliament ordered the castle to be slighted, or put beyond military use: the Bakehouse tower was probably deliberately partially pulled down at this time as part of the slighting. With the restoration of Charles II in 1660, Conway was returned to Edward Conway, the Earl of Conway, but five years later Edward decided to strip the remaining iron and lead from the castle and sell it off. The work was completed under the supervision of Edward Conway's overseer William Milward, despite opposition from the leading citizens of Conwy, <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> castle into a total ruin.|$|E
5|$|Laffoon was {{a member}} of the Democratic National Committee in 1936, but decided not to attend the {{national}} convention. He chose Urey Woodson to serve as his proxy, but Woodson declined to attend as well <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> proxy over to Fred M. Vinson. Laffoon also backed Senator M. M. Logan's re-election bid in 1936. He was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1940, and despite his differences with President Roosevelt during his gubernatorial term, he supported Roosevelt's re-election.|$|E
5|$|On special teams, the Hokies {{had several}} highs and lows. Justin Harper's 84-yard punt-return {{touchdown}} sparked a Virginia Tech rally {{that brought the}} Hokies within striking distance, but failures on special teams also ended the rally <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> momentum of the game against Virginia Tech. Kicker Jud Dunlevy had been the third-most accurate kicker in the nation heading into the Orange Bowl, having hit 21 of his 24field goal attempts during the season. He only needed two field goals to break Tech's record for most field goals in the season, set at 22 by Shayne Graham in 1998. Though Dunlevy had two chances for field goals, one fell short {{and the other was}} blocked.|$|E

Harris was never {{formally}} approached, but Keith was, <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> part down. Robert Ryan was ultimately cast in the part after Peckinpah saw him in the World War II action movie The Dirty Dozen (1967). Other actors considered for the role were Henry Fonda, Glenn Ford, Van Heflin, Ben Johnson (later cast as Tector Gorch), and Arthur Kennedy.|$|E
5|$|The Cutts-Madison House (721 Madison Place NW), {{also known}} as the Dolley Madison House, was {{constructed}} in 1822 by Richard Cutts, brother-in-law of First Lady Dolley Madison. After ex-President James Madison died in 1836, Dolley Madison took up residency in the house and lived there until her death in 1849. Rear Admiral Charles Wilkes purchased the home in 1851. Wilkes moved the entrance from Madison Place NW to H Street NW, <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> porch {{on the west side of}} the house (facing Madison Place NW) into a window. Witnesses from the mid-19th century onward have claimed to have seen the ghost of Dolley Madison rocking in a chair in the space where the porch used to be, smiling at passersby.|$|E
5|$|The Red Hot Chili Peppers had {{released}} Blood Sugar Sex Magik in 1991. The {{album was}} an instant hit, selling over seven million copies in the United States, <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> band into an international sensation. Guitarist John Frusciante was having difficulty coping with the band's newfound fame and started to dislike it. Frusciante often argued with his bandmates, and sabotaged performances. He began taking heroin and steadily increased his usage of the drug over time. Frusciante quit the band in 1992, during its Japanese leg of the tour. He returned {{to his home in}} California and became a recluse.|$|E

5|$|The first combat {{involving}} battlecruisers during World War I was the Battle of Heligoland Bight in August 1914. A {{force of}} British light cruisers and destroyers entered the Heligoland Bight (the {{part of the}} North Sea closest to Hamburg) to attack German destroyer patrols. When they met opposition from light cruisers, Vice Admiral David Beatty took his squadron of five battlecruisers into the Bight <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> tide of the battle, ultimately sinking three German light cruisers and killing their commander, Rear Admiral Leberecht Maass.|$|E
5|$|The free kick {{following}} the intentional safety {{was returned to}} near midfield, and Davis passed for a first down. Following the second down, Davis was sacked for a loss, but then scrambled for a first down to the Tech 25-yard line. From there, however, Boston College's offense began to struggle. During the four plays that followed, the Eagles were able to gain just one yard <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> ball over on downs again. The final Boston College play was a sack of Davis, and Virginia Tech proceeded to run out the clock by kneeling on the ball after taking the field on offense.|$|E
5|$|To {{strengthen}} the division's positions, the 1st Brigade was brought {{forward into the}} front lines overnight. The next day, an attack was launched by the brigade's 1st Wellington Battalion. Supported by artillery, which suppressed an attack made by the Germans minutes {{before the start of}} the battalion's advance from Flers Village, Grove Alley was captured. That evening the weather deteriorated and over the next few days rain filled trenches and shell holes, <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> ground to thick mud. The New Zealanders were continually harassed by German artillery and localised attacks from the spur overlooking Grove Alley. Despite the conditions, the 1st Brigade carried out operations to {{strengthen the}} division's exposed left flank, but it remained vulnerable to enfilade fire from the German positions.|$|E
