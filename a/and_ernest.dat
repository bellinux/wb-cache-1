5|$|In the mid-1930s, Smyth {{began to}} shift his {{interest}} to nuclear physics, inspired by James Chadwick's {{discovery of the}} neutron, John Cockcroft <b>and</b> <b>Ernest</b> Walton splitting the atom, <b>and</b> <b>Ernest</b> Lawrence's invention of the cyclotron. Three of his last research articles concerned detection of triatomic hydrogen and helium-3. His appointment as department chair forced him to {{devote more time to}} administrative work, at the expense of research. As department chair, he had two cyclotrons built at Princeton, one in 1935 and the other in 1946.|$|E

5|$|In 1828, Ernest {{was staying}} with the King at Windsor Castle when severe {{disturbances}} broke out in Ireland among Catholics. The Duke was an ardent supporter of the Protestant cause in Ireland, and returned to Berlin in August, believing that the Government, led by the Duke of Wellington, would deal firmly with the Irish. In January 1829, the Wellington Government {{announced that it would}} introduce a Catholic emancipation bill to conciliate the Irish. Disregarding a request from Wellington that he remain abroad, Ernest returned to London, {{and was one of the}} leaders against the Catholic Relief Act 1829, influencing King George against the bill. Within days of his arrival, the King instructed the officers of his Household to vote against the Bill. Hearing of this, Wellington told the King that he must resign as Prime Minister unless the King could assure him of complete support. The King initially accepted Wellington's resignation, <b>and</b> <b>Ernest</b> attempted to put together a government united against Catholic emancipation. Though such a government would have considerable support in the House of Lords, it would have little support in the Commons, <b>and</b> <b>Ernest</b> abandoned his attempt. The King recalled Wellington. The bill passed the Lords and became law.|$|E

5|$|The related {{question}} of whether the opera contains a specifically anti-Semitic message is also debated. Some of Wagner's contemporaries and commentators (e.g. Hans von Wolzogen <b>and</b> <b>Ernest</b> Newman) who analysed Parsifal at length, make no mention of any anti-Semitic interpretations. However the critics Paul Lindau and Max Nordbeck, present at Parsifal 's premiere, noted in their reviews how the work accorded with Wagner's anti-Jewish sentiments. More recent commentators continue to highlight the perceived anti-Semitic nature of the opera, and find correspondences with anti-Semitic passages found in Wagner's writings and articles of the period.|$|E

40|$|Background: Schizotypal {{personality}} disorder (SPD) is a schizophrenia-spectrum disorder characterized by odd or bizarre behavior, strange speech, magical thinking, unusual perceptual experiences, and social anhedonia. Schizophrenia proper {{has been associated}} with anomalies in dopaminergic neurotransmission and deficits in neurophysiological markers of self-monitoring, such as low amplitude in cognitive event-related brain potentials (ERPs) like the error-related negativity (<b>ERN),</b> <b>and</b> the error positivity (Pe). These components occur after performance errors, rely on adequate fronto-striatal function, and are sensitive to dopaminergic modulation. Here we postulated that analogous to observations in schizophrenia, SPD individuals would show deficits in self-monitoring, as measured by the <b>ERN</b> <b>and</b> the Pe. We also assessed the capacity of dopaminergic antagonists to reverse these postulated deficits. Methods: We recorded the electroencephalogram (EEG) from 9 SPD individuals and 12 healthy controls in two separate experimental sessions while they performed the Eriksen Flanker Task, a classical task recruiting behavioral monitoring. Participants received a placebo or 1  mg risperidone according to a double-blind randomized design. Results: After placebo, SPD individuals showed slower reaction times to hits, longer correction times following errors <b>and</b> reduced <b>ERN</b> <b>and</b> Pe amplitudes. While risperidone impaired performance <b>and</b> decreased <b>ERN</b> <b>and</b> Pe in the control group, it led to behavioral improvements <b>and</b> <b>ERN</b> amplitude increases in the SPD individuals. Conclusions: These results indicate that SPD individuals show deficits in self-monitoring analogous to those in schizophrenia. These deficits can be evidenced by neurophysiological measures, suggest a dopaminergic imbalance, and can be reverted by dopaminergic antagonists...|$|R

5|$|Throughout the {{expedition}} Nansen continued {{to experiment with}} equipment and techniques, altering the designs of skis and sledges and investigating types of clothing, tents and cooking apparatus, thereby revolutionising methods of Arctic travel.

Fermi did not believe that atomic bombs would deter nations from starting wars, nor did he think that the time was ripe for world government.
