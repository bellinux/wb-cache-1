50|$|The Prefect of the Bas-Rhin department, Monsieur Migneret, {{invented the}} VFIL concept. The first VFILs {{saw the light}} of day in Bas-Rhin in 1859, when the Act of 21 May 1836 came into force, {{defining}} the prefecture's powers over highways. This economical mode of transport piqued the interest of other departments, and became the object of an inquiry that led to a law being enacted on 12 July 1865. This act <b>authorised</b> <b>departments</b> and communes to implement VFILs, either themselves or through concessions, with the State's assistance and control. Local bodies {{had a great deal of}} autonomy over both technical and financial planning. But the system was open to abuse: the law, in providing State subsidies of start-up capital, encouraged speculation; in many cases, schemes started with this capital were later abandoned because of technical difficulties.|$|R

50|$|There {{have been}} plans to {{alleviate}} the traffic congestion on the stretch of the road between Newton Abbot and Torquay since 1951. Construction of a bypass around Kingskerswell was almost <b>authorised</b> by the <b>Department</b> for Transport, with construction to start in 2010 and completion in 2013, but in March 2009 {{it was suggested that}} with the economic recession there may not be sufficient money left for constructing a bypass, since money was awarded to other road building schemes elsewhere in the UK the previous autumn. A public enquiry was held in 2009. In October 2010 the government refused to fund the scheme, and placed it in a funding pool to compete against 33 other schemes nationwide for a £600 million development fund. However, in November 2011 the government awarded £74.6 million towards the cost of the bypass, with construction to start the following year. Construction began in October 2012 with the road completed and opened in December 2015. This new section of road is designated the South Devon Highway.|$|R
2500|$|A law on {{explosives}} (Sprengstoffgesetz) was {{the subject}} of two application ordinances (on 17 November 1970 and 24 August 1971) and a general regulatory provision (19 May 1971), which covered respectively the application of the law to nationals of EC Member States, the duty of employers to notify in time the inspection authorities of detonation plans, the interpretation of the purpose and field of application of the law, authorizations for transport of explosives, and control and recognition of training courses on work with explosives. Taking into account the enormous high peaks of air traffic noise and its concentration at a limited number of airports, the Law for Protection against Aircraft Noise of 1971 sought to balance two conflicting demands, the first being the legitimate demand by industry, business and the public for an efficient air-traffic-system, and secondly, the understandable and by no means less legitimate claims of the affected people for protection and compensation. The legislation regulated the establishment of so-called [...] "Lärmschutzzonen" [...] (protection areas against aircraft noise) for all 11 international airports and for those 34 military airports used for jet air craft, and the law also <b>authorised</b> the Federal <b>Department</b> of the Interior to decree protection areas for each of those mentioned airports with approval by the [...] "Bundesrat," [...] the representation of the German Federal States.|$|R

[...] To date several guns have been recovered, refurbished and re-established at Fort Queenscliff, including the recovery from South Channel Island of a 12½-tonne 8-inch gun a hydro-pneumatic or 'disappearing' mounting. Considerable work has also taken place on the restoration of most of the defensive positions and some of the underground magazines. A significant archival collection has also been established. In recognition of these efforts, in 1983, the Fort was awarded the 'Museum of the Year' award for Victoria. Today the Fort Queenscliff Museum receives support {{from a wide range of}} government and private organisations and many interested individuals. [...] Since 1983, approximately 35,000 people have visited the Fort annually. Many of these are school children visiting on excursions. It is expected that the ongoing restoration program will result in a substantial increase in the number of visitors and an increase in public interest. The ultimate objective of the Fort Queenscliff Museum is a fully restored Fort and the development of a museum which will allow visitors to tour the Fort and inspect a multitude of indoor and outdoor displays. [...] Today visitors are encouraged to look upon Fort Queenscliff as a part of the national heritage which belongs to all Australians. Accordingly, the Fort Queenscliff Museum has sought to create an environment that evokes public interest and reminds visitors of our early military history.|$|R
