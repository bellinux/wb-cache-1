5|$|I'm {{proud of}} Triton's around-the-world cruise, but I didn't really do that. That {{was done by}} my crew and the Navy - the ship the Navy built and put me in command of. That's not a {{personal}} achievement, <b>although</b> <b>I</b> was captain of the ship.|$|E

5|$|After {{the success}} of Final Fantasy I, Uematsu {{remained}} with the series to compose the soundtrack to Final Fantasy II (1988). <b>Although</b> <b>I</b> and II were composed separately, music from the two games have only been released on albums together. These albums include a soundtrack album and two arranged albums. Final Fantasy III (1990) was released two years later and featured a soundtrack from Uematsu that has been lauded {{as one of the}} best soundtracks of any NES game. The soundtrack spawned two soundtrack albums, as well as a disc of vocal and orchestral arrangements.|$|E

5|$|God by {{a sudden}} {{conversion}} subdued and brought my mind to a teachable frame, which was more hardened in such matters than {{might have been expected}} from one at my early period of life. Having thus received some taste and knowledge of true godliness, I was immediately inflamed with so intense a desire to make progress therein, that <b>although</b> <b>I</b> did not altogether leave off other studies, yet I pursued them with less ardour.|$|E
5|$|It {{was some}} time {{afterward}} when the thought flashed upon {{my mind that}} the disturbances I had observed {{might be due to}} an intelligent control. <b>Although</b> <b>I</b> could not decipher their meaning, it was impossible for me to think of them as having been entirely accidental. The feeling is constantly growing on me that I had been the first to hear the greeting of one planet to another.|$|E
5|$|My Lords, I apologise to noble Lords {{for this}} {{dramatic}} last-minute but not opportunistic maiden speech. <b>Although</b> <b>I</b> inherited my title 30 {{years ago and}} have attended spasmodically, particularly during the early 1970s when we rigorously debated the Industrial Relations Bill and the European Community Bill of Accession, both in Committee and on Report until extremely late at night, my heart has not entirely been in the thrust and cut of politics, unlike my more distinguished ancestors.|$|E

5|$|And {{being on}} that blessed pilgrimage {{in the sacred}} city of Rome and seeing its great and ancient monuments and reading the great deeds of the Romans as {{described}} by Virgil, Sallust, Lucan, Livy, Valerius, Orosius, and other masters of history... I took my prompting from them <b>although</b> <b>I</b> am a disciple unworthy of such an undertaking. But {{in view of the}} fact that our city of Florence, daughter and offspring of Rome, was mounting and pursuing great purposes, while Rome was in its decline, I thought it proper to trace in this chronicle the origins of the city of Florence, so far as I have been able to recover them, and to relate the city's further development at greater length, and at the same time to give a brief account of events throughout the world as long as it please God, in the hope of whose favor I undertook the said enterprise rather than in reliance on my own poor wits. And thus in the year 1300, on my return from Rome, I began to compile this book in the name of God and the blessed John the Baptist and in honor of our city of Florence.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Adams' performances, finger billiards {{had been}} {{demonstrated}} in New York by French player M. Adrien Izar, who had astonished spectators with an exhibition held on September 20, 1875, before which the game was little known in the United States. In France and England, Izar was considered the game's champion player. The night before his 1878 exhibition, Adams received a telegram in which Izar challenged him {{to play for the}} championship and named Chicago as the venue for contest. Adams replied that he was unwilling to leave New York at that time, but that he would pay Izar's expenses to travel to New York. Adams later issued the following statement to newspapers:I have never intended to play a public match in my line, having never arrogated to myself a superiority above other hand billiard players, <b>although</b> <b>I</b> have deemed myself the equal of any one living in my line, not excepting Mons. Izar, by whom continually letters are written, whose contents have for their purpose a derogation of my skill. That this may be checked, and summarily, I would state that I am willing to play Mons. Izar a match game for $500 a side, in New York City, Boston or Chicago, on a 5x10 table, full size balls and Collender cushion; the championship and gate money to be awarded the player showing the greatest variety of shots in connection with accuracy, and in all giving the most interesting exhibition of finger billiards.|$|E
5|$|That {{first night}} of my {{imprisonment}} was the longest night I have ever passed in my life; {{it seemed as though}} the dawn of day would never come. I found in my bag a small Book of Common Prayer according to the ritual of the Episcopal Church. It was a great comfort to me, and before retiring to rest Mrs. Clark and I spent a few minutes in the devotions appropriate to the evening. Here, perhaps, I may say, that <b>although</b> <b>I</b> had been a regular attendant on the Presbyterian worship since my childhood, a constant contributor to all the missionary societies, and had helped to build their churches and ornament the walls, giving my time and my musical ability freely to make their meetings attractive to my people, yet none of these pious church members or clergymen remembered me in my prison. To this (Christian ?) conduct I contrast that of the Anglican bishop, Rt. Rev. Alfred Willis, who visited me {{from time to time in}} my house, and in whose church I have since been confirmed as a communicant. But he was not allowed to see me at the palace.|$|E

25|$|I had to gain {{them some}} time, and I {{could think of}} nothing other than to attack. I had to stop them somehow. I distracted them, and I even managed to shoot one down, but then I myself was hit. My plane took 15 cannon hits, 80 by machine gun. My leg and my arm were injured, <b>although</b> <b>I</b> didn't feel a thing. I knew I {{probably}} wasn't going to make it back.|$|E

25|$|In 2006, I made {{a serious}} error in {{judgment}} and conducted {{myself in a}} way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs. I recognized my mistake and I told my wife that I had a liaison with another woman, and I asked for her forgiveness. <b>Although</b> <b>I</b> was honest in every painful detail with my family, I did not tell the public. When a supermarket tabloid told a version of the story, I used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it. But being 99 percent honest is no longer enough...|$|E
25|$|Berkeley's biographer, J. D. Davies, wrote after {{examining}} his letters that Berkeley {{appears as a}} 'lively, friendly young man, fully aware of his dependence on the patronage of others, supportive of and loving towards his family, and genuinely enthusiastic to make a success of his chosen career', quoting a letter from William to Charles Berkeley in June 1663: I must assure you I {{think there is no}} so beggarly a trade as this if people serve truly and honestly, as I am resolved I will do, <b>although</b> <b>I</b> am never worth six pence.

25|$|I confess that, as {{a student}} unaware {{of the history of}} the subject and unaware of the {{connection}} with cyclotomy, I did not find the law or its so-called elementary proofs appealing. I suppose, <b>although</b> <b>I</b> would not have (and could not have) expressed myself in this way that I saw it as little more than a mathematical curiosity, fit more for amateurs than for the attention of the serious mathematician that I then hoped to become. It was only in Hermann Weyl's book on the algebraic theory of numbers that I appreciated it as anything more.|$|E

25|$|How {{by means}} of a certain machine many people may stay some time under water.

And <b>although</b> <b>I</b> will impart others, there is no danger in them; because the mouth of the tube, by which you breathe, is above the water supported on bags of corks.|$|E
25|$|I {{have long}} been gravitating towards the Socialist {{position}} — {{of course there is}} Socialism and Socialism, and mine is of the reasonable and moderate kind.

So far as any Party can express what appears to me to be the country's needs, the ILP approximates nearer to my outlook that any other, <b>although</b> <b>I</b> still look forward to and hope for the day when all really progressive forces can unite under the title of the Democratic Party. But Liberalism as represented by both wings — the Lloyd George wing, and the Asquith wing, is right outside my outlook now.|$|E
