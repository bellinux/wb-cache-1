On August 7, Doreen's eye broke up and, as a result, Doreen quickly weakened, being {{downgraded}} into a tropical storm shortly afterward.

Doreen held on to depression strength until <b>August</b> 9, <b>when</b> it entered an area of easterlies, which did nothing to help the already-weakening Doreen, but rather dissipating it quickly.
