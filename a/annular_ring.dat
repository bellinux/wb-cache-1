25|$|The idea of {{the modern}} {{hovercraft}} is most often associated with a British mechanical engineer Sir Christopher Cockerell.

500|$|Fruitbodies have conical to {{flattened}} caps measuring [...] in diameter. They {{usually have}} a low, broad umbo. The colour of the cap depends on its age, ranging from pale blue-green to yellowish-bluish green. There is often a whitish zone around the margin, which invariably has bluish-green tints. When moist, the cap is sticky with a cuticle that may be readily peeled; dry caps are smooth and shiny. Gills are initially pale purplish-brown, becoming darker brown in age as the spores mature. They have an adnate or [...] attachment to the stipe. The stipe has a short-lived <b>annular</b> (<b>ring)</b> zone; above this zone the stipe is smooth, while below it is fibrous and scaly. The flesh is colourless, although it may have tinges of blue in the cap and stipe, and lacks any distinctive odour or flavour. Stropharia cyanea fruit bodies are not edible.|$|E
500|$|Bushings are {{the major}} expense in fiber glass production. [...] The nozzle design is also critical. [...] The number of nozzles ranges from 200 to 4000 in {{multiples}} of 200. [...] The {{important part of the}} nozzle in continuous filament manufacture is the thickness of its walls in the exit region. [...] It was found that inserting a counterbore here reduced wetting. [...] Today, the nozzles are designed to have a minimum thickness at the exit. [...] As glass flows through the nozzle, it forms a drop which is suspended from the end. [...] As it falls, it leaves a thread attached by the meniscus to the nozzle as long as the viscosity is in the correct range for fiber formation. [...] The smaller the <b>annular</b> <b>ring</b> of the nozzle and the thinner the wall at exit, the faster the drop will form and fall away, and the lower its tendency to wet the vertical part of the nozzle. [...] The surface tension of the glass is what influences the formation of the meniscus. [...] For E-glass it should be around 400mN/m.|$|E

When the two <b>annular</b> <b>rings</b> are coupled properly, a wide band from 5. 45 [*]GHz to 7. 16 [*]GHz is achieved with a monopole-like radiation pattern. Measured {{results show that}} the antenna with a low profile of 0. 027 wavelengths (at 5. 45 [*]GHz) has a bandwidth of 27. 1 % and a measured maximum gain of 6 [*]dBi. The radiation pattern is omnidirectional and remains relatively stable within the operating band...|$|R

40|$|We provide {{what is to}} our {{knowledge}} the first experimental evidence that multiple filamentation (MF) of ultrashort pulses can be induced by input beam ellipticity. Unlike noise-induced MF, which results in complete beam breakup, the MF pattern induced by small input beam ellipticity appears {{as a result of}} nucleation of <b>annular</b> <b>rings</b> surrounding the central filament. Moreover, our experiments show that input beam ellipticity can dominate the effect of noise (transverse modulational instability), giving rise to predictable and highly reproducible MF patterns...|$|R
