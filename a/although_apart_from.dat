The hills {{range in size}} from 1 to 2 km across and were estimated to have heights of 100 to 200 m by Trask and Guest, who first recognized this unit and named it hilly terrain. The main tracts of hilly material occur in a roughly concentric band outside the Caloris ejecta. It is possible that this unit is associated with Caloris, <b>although</b> <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> geographical distribution, there is no supporting evidence. In some places, contact relations suggest that the hilly plains material may be older than intermediate plains material. Also, patches of the hilly material may be associated with intercrater plains materials {{in the eastern part of}} the quadrangle, where lighting conditions do not allow its recognition.|$|E

40|$|AbstractRecently, Aichholzer {{introduced}} the remarkable {{concept of the}} so-called triangulation path (of a triangulation {{with respect to a}} segment), which has the potential of providing efficient counting of triangulations of a point set, and efficient representations of all such triangulations. Experiments support such evidence, <b>although</b> – <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> the basic uniqueness properties – little has been proved so far. In this paper we provide an algorithm which enumerates all triangulation paths (of all triangulations of a given point set with respect to a given segment) in time O(tn 3 logn) and O(n) space, where n denotes the number of points and t is the number of triangulation paths. For the algorithm we introduce the notion of flips between such paths, and define a structure on all paths such that the reverse search approach can be applied. We also refute Aichholzer's conjecture that points in convex position maximize the number of such paths. There are configurations that allow Ω(22 n−Θ(logn)) paths...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the consequences for}} monetary policy of the zero floor for nominal interest rates. The zero bound can be a significant constraint {{on the ability of}} a central bank to combat deflation. The paper shows, {{in the context of an}} intertemporal equilibrium model, that open-market operations, even of "unconventional" types, are ineffective if future policy is expected to be purely forward looking. However, a credible commitment to the right sort of history-dependent policy can largely mitigate the distortions created by the zero bound. In the model, optimal policy involves a commitment to adjust interest rates so as to achieve a time-varying price-level target, when this is consistent with the zero bound. The paper also discusses ways in which other central bank actions, <b>although</b> irrelevant <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> their effects on expectations, may help to make a central bank's commitment to its target more credible. macroeconomics, Zero Bound, Interest Rates, Optimal Monetary Policy...|$|R

40|$|Diversity is {{a policy}} {{objective}} that most systems of higher education pursue.

Individual institutions, {{for a variety of reasons}} ranging from accountability to the allocation of scarce resources, attempt to compare or “benchmark ” themselves against other institutions. Both activities involve measurement, classification, and the selection of peers. <b>Although</b> customarily addressed <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> one another, diversity and peer selection can be conceptually closely linked within single scales of similarity and dis-similarity. Existing paradigms that explain diversity might be too simple for reliable peer selection and comparison, and might fail to account for all expressions of diversity.

After examining the positions of the IBSA states on seven controversial country-specific cases (Belarus, Darfur and Sudan, Iran, Israel, North Korea, Sri Lanka, and Syria) and four controversial thematic domains (economic rights, racism, freedom of expression, and sexual orientation), I conclude that the three states {{do not have the same}} views about human rights. Furthermore, I find that the IBSA states often do not support pro-human rights initiatives in the Council, <b>although</b> Brazil stands <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> India and South Africa for its greater willingness to support stronger human rights positions...|$|R

Some additional osteological features identified on radiographs taken from the type material belonging to that species are presented. A brief discussion is furnished, indicating that the recent inclusion of the nominal Tembeassu marauna in Apteronotus La Cépède is not supported by currently available evidence. Thus, it is herein suggested that the species is kept in it own separate genus within the Apteronotidae. Finally, it is argued that T. marauna possibly represents an endangered species at the upper Paraná river region...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, an {{examination}} {{has been made}} of the indications for the prescription of psychotropic drugs in general practice. The study was prompted by the extensive consumption of these drugs that has be-come apparent within a comparatively short time after their introduction. The hypotheses were that psycho-tropic drugs are largely prescribed for somatic diseases, and for "non-medical " problems. The study is based on information obtained by questionnaire, from 47 gen-eral practitioners. The data obtained supported the first hypothesis. More than one-half of the psychotropic drugs were found to have been prescribed for somatic diseases. The data obtained did not provide direct sup-port for the second hypothesis, but this may have been attributable to the method applied. It is highly probable that a doctor, in completing a questionnaire, would give a medical diagnosis for a "non-medical " problem. This study suggests that one mechanism of the in-creased utilization of psychotropic drugs is the broad-ened field of indications. <b>Although</b> psychotropic drugs, <b>apart</b> <b>from</b> barbi-turates and some other hypnotics, have only been available for a short period, since the 1950 s, their utilization has rapidly reached remarkable propor-tions; various studies have shown that from 7 to 24 % 'of all prescriptions include such drugs (3...|$|R
