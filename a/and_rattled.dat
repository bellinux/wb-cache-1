25|$|As {{the season}} progressed, the Drillers {{experienced}} the steep learning curve, {{but managed to}} easily surpass the rather low expectations thrust on them to only win four games all season. With eight games to play the Drillers {{were still in the}} hunt for a playoff with a respectable 14–18 record, but were a long shot as seven of those games were on the road included a dreaded three games, in three nights, in three different cities stretch. Rather improbably the Drillers suddenly caught fire, <b>and</b> <b>rattled</b> off six wins in the seven road games and found themselves with one game to play against their division rival Detroit with a playoff spot going to the victor.|$|E
500|$|Several critics {{praised the}} {{development}} of Santana. Hankinson wrote, [...] "My goodness, Santana. It's {{as if all the}} writers sat around a room, identified the best lines of tonight's episode and then decided to give them all to Santana. Fantastic." [...] VanDerWerff called Santana the highlight of the episode: [...] "The best thing about this episode is Naya Rivera's work as Santana and the story the three writers have cooked up for her. Rivera's really come into her own this season, going from just a generic bitchy cheerleader to an actual character who has motivations and might be a better villain for the show than Sue." [...] He added, [...] "the storyline of Santana realizing {{she was in love with}} Brittany and, thus, is probably a lesbian has been nicely plotted and surprisingly deep. The reveal about Santana hasn't washed away her less savory qualities; indeed, it's heightened them, to a degree, as she struggles to be true to herself and still maintain her status as the hottest girl in school." [...] Jenna Mullins of E! Online wrote of Santana, [...] "This episode just cemented my love for her. The insult spew in the beginning of the episode was awesomely mean." [...] She also said that Santana's [...] "inner monologue is often more entertaining than other characters' outer monologues". CNN Lisa Respers France considered Santana the episode's highlight, and went on to write, [...] "She embraced her inner lesbian (sort of) <b>and</b> <b>rattled</b> off the best [...] like 'the only straight I am is straight-up [...]' You gotta love that." ...|$|E

40|$|Clatter <b>and</b> <b>rattle</b> {{noise is}} an {{increasing}} challenge {{for the development of}} low-noise transmissions. Efforts to reduce fuel consumption and exhaust emissions of combustion engines combined with a decrease of the idle speed cause increasing cyclic irregularities within modern drivelines which result in an increasing clatter <b>and</b> <b>rattle</b> noise <b>and</b> can even lead to serious damage of driveline components. Beside these aspects, the improvement of transmission efficiency as part of the powertrain efficiency and therefore fuel consumption of the vehicle is a major task during {{the development of a new}} transmission. In order to design future transmissions that implicate improvements on both tasks simultaneously, new grounds were broken by the Institute of Machine Components (IMA) of the University of Stuttgart, Germany in the field of clatter <b>and</b> <b>rattle</b> noise free automotive transmissions. This is achieved in principle by decoupling all gears which are not in the power flow. On the basis of a patented solution named CARF-Transmission, the Clatter <b>And</b> <b>Rattle</b> noise Free transmission is presented as well as derived developments. Both targets, i. e. reduction of the emitted clatter <b>and</b> <b>rattle</b> noise as well as the efficiency enhancement by reducing the drag torque can be achieved with this transmission...|$|R
