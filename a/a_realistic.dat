5|$|After {{the first}} two shows of season two, Jim Shelley in The Guardian, called The Wire the best show on TV, praising the second season {{for its ability to}} detach from its former {{foundations}} in the first season. Jon Garelick with the Boston Phoenix was of the opinion that the subculture of the docks (second season) was not as absorbing as that of the housing projects (first season), but he went on to praise the writers for creating <b>a</b> <b>realistic</b> world and populating it with an array of interesting characters.|$|E

5|$|Amis drew upon {{a holiday}} {{he had taken}} in the Greek islands to create <b>a</b> <b>realistic</b> Greek setting and characters. He {{emphasised}} political intrigue in the plot more than Fleming had done in the canonical Bond novels, also adding revenge to Bond's motivations by including M's kidnapping. Despite keeping a format and structure similar to Fleming's Bond novels, Colonel Sun was given mixed reviews.|$|E
5|$|Caracalla's {{official}} portrayal as sole emperor marks a {{break from}} the detached images of the philosopher-emperors who preceded him: his close-cropped haircut is that of a soldier, his pugnacious scowl <b>a</b> <b>realistic</b> and threatening presence. This rugged soldier-emperor, an iconic archetype, was adopted by most of the following emperors, such as Maximinus Thrax, who were dependent on the support of the troops to rule the empire.|$|E
5|$|DNA Films' co-founder Andrew Macdonald engaged cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle {{to manage}} the shoot; {{it was the first}} time Mantle had worked with 3D. The filmmakers wanted Dredd to have <b>a</b> <b>realistic,</b> visceral look, and drew {{inspiration}} from crime and gangster films. For scenes conveying the time and space altering effects of Slo-Mo, Mantle aimed to create images that would be beautiful but disorienting.|$|E

5|$|During the Cold War, Swiss {{authorities}} {{considered the}} construction of a Swiss nuclear bomb. Leading nuclear physicists at the Federal Institute of Technology Zürich such as Paul Scherrer made this <b>a</b> <b>realistic</b> possibility. In 1988, the Paul Scherrer Institute was founded in his name to explore the therapeutic uses of neutron scattering technologies. Financial problems with the defence budget and ethical considerations prevented the substantial funds from being allocated, and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty of 1968 was seen as a valid alternative. All remaining plans for building nuclear weapons were dropped by 1988.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{took place}} during the first months of 2006. The main hurdle came up with the location. Barjatya wanted to shoot film in an {{authentic}} way. He asked the film's art director Sanjay Dhobade to create the entire town of Madhupur that can give <b>a</b> <b>realistic</b> look, particularly portions where water leaking takes place and portions where spit marks were visible {{on the walls of the}} buildings in the film. Later, the town was created in film city, Mumbai. Outdoor session of the film was done in Delhi, Lonavla, Ranikhet, Nainital and Almora.|$|E

Alcott, considered <b>a</b> <b>realistic</b> contender for a medal, achieved the squad's best finish coming eleventh in the women's combined.|$|E

5|$|Furthermore, even single neurons {{appear to}} be complex and capable of {{performing}} computations. So, brain models that don't reflect this are too abstract to be representative of brain operation; models that do try to capture this are very computationally expensive and arguably intractable with present computational resources. However, the Human Brain Project is trying to build <b>a</b> <b>realistic,</b> detailed computational model of the entire human brain. The wisdom of this approach has been publicly contested, with high-profile scientists {{on both sides of}} the argument.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the visual}} effects on Labyrinth were {{achieved}} in-camera, with several notable exceptions. The most prominent of these post-production effects was the computer-generated owl that appears {{at the opening of}} the film. The sequence was created by animators Larry Yaeger and Bill Kroyer, and marked the first use of <b>a</b> <b>realistic</b> CGI animal in a film. The owl head maquette had to be rescued from a skip (dumpster) when Omnibus, the animation company, went bankrupt in 1987.|$|E

5|$|Sometime between 1888 and 1890, McKinley {{decided to}} run for president, but to have <b>a</b> <b>realistic</b> chance of {{attaining}} that goal, he needed to regain office.

McKinley was elected, and Sherman narrowly turned back Foraker's challenge with considerable help from Hanna.|$|E
