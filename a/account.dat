5|$|The {{balance of}} {{payments}} accounts summarize payments made to or received from foreign countries.

The {{balance of payments}} {{is a function of}} three components: transactions involving export or import of goods and services form the current <b>account,</b> transactions involving purchase or sale of financial assets form the financial <b>account,</b> and transactions involving unconventional transfers of wealth form the capital <b>account.</b> The current <b>account</b> summarizes three variables: the trade balance, net factor income from abroad, and net unilateral transfers. The financial <b>account</b> summarizes the value of exports versus imports of assets, and the capital <b>account</b> summarizes the value of asset transfers received net of transfers given.

30|$|Several studies {{focus on}} <b>accounting</b> {{identification}}, <b>accounting</b> measurement, and <b>accounting</b> policy. The basis of <b>accounting</b> identification is accrual <b>accounting,</b> butliterature raises {{the concept of}} cash flow based <b>accounting,</b> adjusted from cash based <b>accounting,</b> that could provide more useful information for decision making and solve the limitations of accrual based <b>accounting.</b> For <b>accounting</b> measurement, Lin (1997) investigates the relationship between uncertainty and <b>accounting</b> which argues that <b>accounting</b> has a time-lag and that uncertainty comes from monetary measurement. Xie (1997) presents two non-monetary asset measure models on the labor theory of value and marginal utility theory of value which {{are different from the}} capital preservation concept of <b>accounting.</b> Meanwhile, with the development of financial derivatives, Huang (1997 a) believes that historical cost <b>accounting</b> will be replaced by fair value <b>accounting</b> in the twenty-first century and briefly introduces the concept of fair value <b>accounting</b> in <b>accounting</b> standards issued by the Financial <b>Accounting</b> Standards Board (FASB). With respect to <b>accounting</b> policy, Huang and Yang (1995) explore questions such as what is <b>accounting</b> policy and why there is <b>accounting</b> policy. They regard <b>accounting</b> policy as the principle, procedure and method by which a certain <b>accounting</b> unit is used to make financial statements, including macro-level <b>accounting</b> policy such as <b>accounting</b> standards, and firm-level <b>accounting</b> policy issued by the firms themselves according to their particular situations. Consistent with Huang and Yang (1995), Li and Zhu (1996) argue that <b>accounting</b> environment and firm operation should be taken into consideration for the choice of <b>accounting</b> policy. As well, Huang and Yang (1996) investigate <b>accounting</b> policy in details, that is the separation between financial <b>accounting</b> and tax <b>accounting</b> in <b>accounting</b> policy. Financial <b>accounting</b> and tax <b>accounting</b> are separated due to different objectives, legislative authority and calculation principles. Compared with <b>accounting</b> development internationally, Tang and Lu (1997) put forward the challenge for financial <b>accounting</b> in China, including <b>accounting</b> identification, <b>accounting</b> measurement, financial reporting, <b>accounting</b> theory, the release and diffusion of <b>accounting</b> information, and the combination of financial <b>accounting</b> and managerial <b>accounting.</b>|$|R

30|$|First of all, the {{question}} of what is <b>accounting</b> is the most important issue during the early stage period. Some literature summarize the definition of <b>accounting</b> as the following four concepts: management tool, management activity, art, and information system based on definitions in both domestic and foreign materials including textbooks, encyclopedias, literature, and reports of <b>accounting</b> associations. Zhou (1988) briefly introduces the Chinese <b>accounting</b> system, relating the nature of the Chinese <b>accounting</b> system to the specific socio-economic context in China. Subsequently, Wu (1996) argues that <b>accounting</b> is used to reflect firm stewardship and defines <b>accounting</b> as an economic control system which aims at affirming and measuring accountability with monetary measurement. However, Zhao (1995 b) summarizes the objective of <b>accounting</b> as the integration of accountability and decision availability. Huang (1997 b) notes that the debate about <b>accounting</b> objectives is meaningless if the function of <b>accounting</b> is neglected. He considers recording and supervision to be the functions of <b>accounting</b> and that discussions of the objective of <b>accounting</b> should be restricted to the functions of <b>accounting.</b> Moreover, one article explores the essence and content of <b>accounting</b> culture. He defines <b>accounting</b> culture as <b>accounting</b> ideology, its corresponding system, and implementation, whereas the content of <b>accounting</b> includes <b>accounting</b> values, <b>accounting</b> ethics, and <b>accounting</b> law.|$|R
5|$|Because of the {{inconsistent}} {{nature of}} {{the record of the}} action, contemporary and historical coverage of it has been easily colored by preferences for one <b>account</b> over another. Francis Parkman, for example, accepted Washington's <b>account,</b> and was highly dismissive of the accounts by Monceau and the Indian.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the balance}} of {{payments}} sums to zero, a current <b>account</b> surplus indicates a deficit in the asset accounts and vice versa. A current <b>account</b> surplus or deficit indicates {{the extent to which}} a country is relying on foreign capital to finance its consumption and investments, and whether it is living beyond its means. For example, assuming a capital <b>account</b> balance of zero (thus no asset transfers available for financing), a current <b>account</b> deficit of £1 billion implies a financial <b>account</b> surplus (or net asset exports) of £1 billion. A net exporter of financial assets is known as a borrower, exchanging future payments for current consumption. Further, a net export of financial assets indicates growth in a country's debt. From this perspective, {{the balance of}} payments links a nation's income to its spending by indicating the degree to which current <b>account</b> imbalances are financed with domestic or foreign financial capital, which illuminates how a nation's wealth is shaped over time. A healthy balance of payments position is important for economic growth. If countries experiencing a growth in demand have trouble sustaining a healthy balance of payments, demand can slow, leading to: unused or excess supply, discouraged foreign investment, and less attractive exports which can further reinforce a negative cycle that intensifies payments imbalances.|$|E
