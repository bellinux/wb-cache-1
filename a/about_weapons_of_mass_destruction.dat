[...] After several months of refusing to confirm this statement, Tenet stated that it was taken out of context. He indicated that it was made pursuant to a discussion about how to convince the American people to support invading Iraq. The search following the 2003 invasion of Iraq by US, British and international forces yielded no significant WMDs.|$|E

5000|$|Perhaps {{the most}} famous and {{mainstream}} reference to {{these two types of}} uncertainty was made in 2002 by then U.S.A. Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, in his famous [...] "There are known knowns" [...] statement. When asked <b>about</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> <b>destruction</b> in Iraq, Rumsfeld referred to the situation as consisting of, among other things, [...] "known unknowns" [...] and [...] "unknown unknowns". In this context the known unknowns were presumably epistemic uncertainty while the unknown unknowns were aleatoric uncertainty. Filmmaker Errol Morris used a permutation of Rumsfeld's statement as the title of a documentary about Rumsfeld, The Unknown Known. The film focused heavily on Rumsfeld's statements about and understanding of uncertainty regarding the Iraq war.|$|E
5000|$|The book {{investigates the}} death of David Kelly.

He had an off-record discussion with a BBC journalist concerning a British government dossier <b>about</b> <b>Weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> <b>destruction</b> in Iraq, which was cited by the journalist. Kelly's name became subsequently known and he was aggressively questioned by a Parliamentary committee. He was found dead two days later, attributed to suicide. In the book, Baker disputes this version of events and suggests Kelly was murdered. Baker stated 'I am convinced {{beyond a reasonable doubt}} that this could not be suicide. The medical evidence does not support it and David Kelly's state of mind and personality suggests otherwise. It was not an accident so I am left with the conclusion that it is murder.' ...|$|E

I want to state that Mr. Cheney must be held accountable. He is already ginning up a cause for war against Iran. Now, we have to stand for this Constitution, we have to protect and defend this Constitution. And this vice {{president}} has violated this Constitution. So I think that while my friends on the stage may not be ready to take this stand, the American people should know that there's at least one person running for president who wants to reconnect America with its goodness, with its greatness, with its highest principles, which currently are not being reflected by those who are in the White House.

5000|$|Basson called {{only one}} witness - himself. In July 2001 Basson began {{to present his}} own evidence, {{speaking}} for 40 days. He stated that he had learned <b>about</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> <b>destruction</b> from Saddam Hussein, that he had indeed had free rein in the project {{and that he had}} exchanged information with foreign governments. Technically, all that was legal. The defence argued that Basson should have immunity for anything that had happened in Namibia. On 22 April 2002 Judge Hartzenberg dismissed all the remaining charges against Basson and granted him amnesty. In his judgement, the judge called the state's case [...] "fragmented and confusing", and that it was largely superficial, hoping to convince the court of Basson's guilt in a manner which fell far short of the standard [...] "beyond reasonable doubt". Judge Hartzenberg further added that the state seemed to have decided what the truth was and had urged the court not to believe anything that contradicted the state's version of the truth. The trial had lasted 30 months. The state tried to appeal the judgement due to legal inaccuracies, but the Supreme Court of Appeal refused to order a retrial in 2003, a step reserved for appeals that had no chance of success.|$|E

The search following the 2003 invasion of Iraq by American, British, and other international forces yielded no stockpiles of nuclear WMDs in Iraq, except {{for tens of thousands of}} chemical shells found stacked from floors to ceilings in every room of what was putatively a school building in the Anbar province. And of course the 83 flat bed trucks which sped from Iraq into Syria 3 days before the invasion of Iraq in 2003, which were later used by Syrian dictator and former passenger jet pilot Bashar al-Assad against the population whose desire for self-government and liberty were revived after Iraq and Lebanon, whose elected government had not met since shortly after the terrorist group PLO invaded in 1975 and destroyed Beirut, until then called [...] "the Paris of the Middle East", gained representative governments. Tenet and his Director of Operations resigned at about this same time, and it has been suggested these resignations were in penance over the WMD issue in Iraq.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{the recent}} U. S. -led {{invasion}} of Iraq, serious questions have arisen over truth claims made {{to justify the}} war and the reporting of these claims in the media. These include allegations <b>about</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> <b>destruction</b> (WMD) in Iraq and possible links between Saddam Hussein’s regime and terrorist groups like al Qaeda. Prior to the invasion of Iraq there was some debate over the legitimacy of these claims and subsequent information from Iraq reveals that {{there were a number of}} inadequacies. The paper examines the extent to which American newspapers and their counterparts in Canada, India and the United Kingdom accurately presented information on Iraq to their readers during the build-up to the invasion and the extent to which the selection of sources played a role in the reporting. A content analysis of the specific claims was performed on articles published during the period between 9 / 11 and the invasion of Iraq. Results were compared between American papers and their international counterparts, including a discussion of how the selection of sources influenced the discourse...|$|E
40|$|Did the US and UK governments lie <b>about</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> <b>destruction</b> {{to promote}} {{an attack on}} Iraq? Did the media hold them to account or act as cheerleaders for war? Tell me Lies reveals the {{systematic}} propaganda used by both the US and UK governments to convince us of the 'threat' from Iraq. It shows how we were deliberately misled into a war {{that has resulted in}} a humanitarian disaster in Iraq and threatens to create further instability and resentment of the US and UK throughout the Middle East. Written by some of the world's leading journalists and commentators, it's a scathing indictment {{of the role of the}} mainstream media in legitimising government actions and undermining dissent. Critics, activists and journalists from both sides of the Atlantic explore alternatives such as the internet and Al Jazeera and provide analysis and guidance on resisting the media war.

2500|$|As {{evidence}} supporting U.S. and British charges <b>about</b> Iraqi <b>Weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> destruction {{and links to}} terrorism weakened, some supporters of the invasion have increasingly shifted their justification to the human rights violations of the Saddam government. Leading human rights groups such as Human Rights Watch have argued, however, that they believe human rights concerns were never a central justification for the invasion, nor do they believe that military intervention was justifiable on humanitarian grounds, most significantly because [...] "the killing in Iraq {{at the time was}} not of the exceptional nature that would justify such intervention." ...|$|R

The inquiry was launched by Gordon Brown {{in the summer of}} 2009 shortly after operations in the war ended. In 2016, after publication of the resultant Chilcot Report, which was critical of the war but remained neutral on its legality, Prescott declared that the invasion by UK and US forces had been [...] "illegal" [...] and that members of Tony Blair's Cabinet [...] "were given too little paper documentation to make decisions".|$|R
