40|$|In pig-to-primate xenotransplantation, {{multiple}} transgenic pigs {{are required}} to overcome a series of transplant rejections. The generation of multiple transgenic pigs either by breeding or the introduction of several mono-cistronic vectors has been hampered by the differential expression patterns of the target genes. To achieve simultaneous expression of multiple genes, a poly-cistronic expression system using the 2 A peptide derived from the Thosea asigna virus (T 2 A) can be considered an alternative choice. Before applying T 2 A expression system to pig generation, the expression patterns of multiple genes in this system should be precisely evaluated. In this study, we constructed several bi-cistronic T 2 <b>A</b> <b>expression</b> <b>vectors,</b> which combine target genes that are frequently used in the xenotransplantation field, and introduced them into porcine fibroblasts.

40|$|The E 1 a gene of {{adenovirus}} encodes two proteins, 289 and 243 {{amino acids}} long, which have positive (transactivator) and negative (enhancer repressor) RNA polymerase II transcriptional regulatory properties and cell transformation activities including cooperation with an activated ras gene. The E 1 a transforming functions more closely correlate with the repressor property than with transactivation in that both E 1 a proteins express the repressor and transformation functions while only the 289 -amino-acid protein is an efficient transactivator. To understand whether the transcriptional regulatory activities of E 1 a {{are related to}} its ras cooperation activity, we generated a series of mutant E 1 <b>a</b> <b>expression</b> <b>vectors</b> by linker insertion mutagenesis of the 289 -amino-acid protein. Here we describe {{a new class of}} mutants which although defective for enhancer repression still can cooperate with the ras oncogene in cell transformation. The mutants are also defective in transcription transactivation. Our data suggest that enhancer repression and transformation via ras cooperation are separate E 1 a functions and that cooperation with ras does not rely on either of the RNA polymerase II transcription regulatory functions of E 1 a. We also show that mutations which inactivate enhancer repression are not confirmed to a single critical domain necessary for repression. We therefore propose that the integrity of the overall configuration of the E 1 a proteins is important for the repression activity...|$|E
40|$|We have {{recently}} shown that infection of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome-positive B cells by human herpesvirus 6 (HHV- 6) {{results in the}} expression of the immediate-early EBV Zebra gene, followed by virus replication (L. Flamand, I. Stefanescu, D. V. Ablashi, and J. Menezes, J. Virol. 67 : 6768 - 6777, 1993). Here we show that HHV- 6 upregulates Zebra gene transcription through a cyclic AMP-responsive element (CRE) located within the Zebra promoter (Zp). Using human B- or T-cell lines transfected with ZpCat reporter gene constructs, we demonstrate that a region designated the ZII domain of Zp is the target of HHV- 6 transactivation. Mutation of the consensus AP- 1 /CRE site within ZII abolished the inducibility of Zp by HHV- 6, whereas positioning of the ZII domain upstream of the beta-globin minimal promoter conferred responsiveness following HHV- 6 infection. Binding of these factors to ZII was prevented by oligonucleotides containing CRE but not by AP- 1 consensus sequences. Antibodies against CRE-binding (CREB) protein but not against c-Fos or c-Jun were able to supershift the DNA-protein complex, identifying the nature of the transcription factor which binds to ZII {{as a member of the}} CREB family of proteins. Finally, transfection of CREB protein and protein kinase <b>A</b> <b>expression</b> <b>vectors</b> were found to activate Zp in Jurkat cells, suggesting that phosphorylated form of CREB protein can play a determining role in the EBV reactivation process...|$|E

Methods: The tpr (PG 1055) gene from P. gingivalis W 83 was cloned into pGEX- 6 P 1 and pET 28 <b>a</b> <b>expression</b> <b>vectors,</b> to encode N-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST-Tpr) and C-terminal hexahistidine (Tpr-His 6) fusion proteins, respectively. Point mutations of conserved active site residues were created (as N-terminal GST-fusions). Proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL 21 (DE 3) and purified using affinity chromatography followed by size exclusion chromatography. The N-terminal GST-tag was removed during the purification process. Tpr proteolytic activities were determined using the EnzChek Gelatinase/Collagenase Assay kit (Life Technologies) with minor modifications. Results: The recombinant Tpr proteins were expressed from both vectors as a mixture of full-length (ca. 55 kDa) and N-terminally-truncated (ca. 45 kDa) forms. Chromatographic and SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that the full-length Tpr protein remained strongly associated with the N-terminal fragment (ca. 10 kDa) and truncated (ca. 45 kDa) Tpr form. The purified recombinant Tpr protein complex had efficient collagenase activities. Notably, the active-site mutants of Tpr, which completely lacked proteolytic activities, were expressed exclusively as full-length forms. This implied proteolytic self-processing occurred for the wild type Tpr protein. N-terminal (Edman) sequencing of the ca. 45 kDa Tpr band indicated autocatalytic processing had occurred in a highly specific manner. Conclusions: The initially-expressed Tpr protease cleaves itself in a specific manner yielding two protein fragments. The biological significance of this autocatalytic processing remains to be determined.

40|$|Aberrant {{repair of}} DNA double-strand break (DSB) {{is thought to}} be {{important}} in the generation of gross chromosomal rearrangements (GCRs); these GCRs are often associated with cellular transformation. The RAG 1 and RAG 2 proteins are known to initiate V(D) J recombination by producing a DSB between the recombination signal sequence (RSS) and the neighboring DNA. It has been suspected {{for a long time that}} inappropriate DNA recombination mediated by RAG 1 and RAG 2 may induce oncogenic chromosomal alterations in lymphoid cells. To examine if and how DSBs might lead to chromosomal rearrangements, we investigated the consequences of the repair of a single DSB in the human histiocytic lymphoma cell line U 937. An RSS recognition site was introduced into chromosome 4 of the recipient cells and the resultant cell line was named P 16. This sequence was inserted between a constitutive promoter (EF 1 α) and the Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSTK) gene which confers sensitivity to gancyclovir (GCV). Transfection of RAG 1, RAG 2 and E 2 <b>A</b> <b>expression</b> <b>vectors</b> into P 16 cells caused a single DSB at RSS site in a subset of cells. Clones that had aberrant repair and separated the EF 1 α promoter from the HSTK gene were resistant to GCV treatment. Southern blotting analysis revealed that mutated clones have various rearranged bands compared to the parental P 16 cell line. Further analysis through inverse PCR and sequencing demonstrated the genomic DNA was rearranged at the breakpoints, consistent with the features of GCRs. Analysis of the breakpoint junctions indicated that these rearrangements were due to the large interstitial deletions, ranging from 5 kb to more than 260 kb in size. This model system provides direct evidence that RAG 1 and RAG 2 can be involved in the process of generation of DNA rearrangement...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Osteosarcoma (OS) is {{the most}} {{prevalent}} primary malignant bone tumor in children and young adults, its complex etiology involving a combination of environmental and genetic factors. MicroRNA (miRNA) is a short, non-coding regulatory RNA molecule that represses gene expression by imperfectly base-pairing to the 3 ' untranslated region of target mRNAs. Evidence has shown that alterations in the expres-sion of miRNA {{are involved in the}} initiation, progression, and metastasis of human cancers. It is believed that miRNAs func-tion both as tumor suppressors and oncogenes during cancer development. In the present study, three tumor-associated miRNAs (miR- 21, miR- 34 a and miR- 146 a) coding regions were screened in Chinese-Han OS patients. A G>A variation in the pre-miR- 34 a coding region was found to be associated with higher OS morbidity. By detecting the mature miR- 34 a expression in cells transfected with pre-miR- 34 <b>a</b> <b>expression</b> <b>vectors</b> of different genotypes using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, it was demonstrated that the G>A variation reduced miR- 34 a expression in vitro. This was in accordance with the data collected from tumor tissue and patient serum samples. Subsequently, a dual-luciferase reporter assay and western blot analysis were used to detect the site variation effect on the expression of c-Met, a target gene of miR- 34 a. The G>A variation downregulated the suppression of c-Met in two OS cell lines. Furthermore, it was found that reduced miR- 34 a expression decreased the suppression of OS cell prolifera-tion in vitro. In conclusion, the present study established the association between miR- 34 a and the risk of suffering OS in a Chinese Han population by identifying one functional single nucleotide polymorphism site in pre‑miR‑ 34 a. These findings may give insight into the mechanism of OS development and create an opportunity to approach the diagnosis and treatment of OS...|$|E
