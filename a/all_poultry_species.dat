In total, 964 guinea fowl and 1, 728 pheasant eggs {{were used in the}} study. Eggshell thickness was measured directly with an ultrasound gauge. Thicknesses ranged between 0. 27 - 0. 47 mm in guinea fowl and 0. 24 - 0. 49 mm in pheasant eggs. Incubation periods were 28 days for guinea fowl and 25 days for pheasant eggs. At the end of the incubation period, unhatched eggs were broken to identify the causes of embryonic mortality. Eggs were classified as thin-, medium- and thick-shelled, and hatching rates were calculated as a function of eggshell thickness. Differences in hatching rates of guinea fowl and pheasant eggs with different shell thicknesses were not statistically significant (p> 0. 05) ...|$|E
40|$|After oral (PO) and {{intravenous}} (IV) {{administration of}} zearalenone (ZEN) to broiler chickens, laying hens, and turkey poults, the mycotoxin was rapidly absorbed (Tmax = 0. 32 − 0. 97 h) {{in all three}} species; however, the absolute oral bioavailability was low (F% = 6. 87 − 10. 28 %). Next, also a rapid elimination of the mycotoxin in <b>all</b> <b>poultry</b> <b>species</b> was observed (T 1 / 2 el = 0. 29 − 0. 46 h). Both α- and β-zearalenone (ZEL) were formed equally after IV administration in all species studied, whereas an increased biotransformation to β-ZEL was demonstrated after PO administration, indicating presystemic biotransformation mainly in broiler chickens and laying hens. In comparison to the latter, turkey poults demonstrated a more extensive biotransformation of ZEN to α-ZEL after PO administration which could, {{in combination with the}} observed higher volume of distribution of ZEN, indicate a higher sensitivity of this species to the effects of ZEN in comparison to other poultry species...|$|E
40|$|The {{additive}} AGal-Pro, {{also named}} as Biogalactosidase BL and AlphaGal BL, is a preparation of alpha-galactosidase (galactosidase) {{produced by a}} genetically modified strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and of endo- 1, 4 -beta-glucanase (glucanase) produced by a non-genetically modified strain of Aspergillus niger. This product is authorised for use in chickens for fattening as a zootechnical additive, functional group of digestibility enhancers. The applicant seeks for {{the extension of the}} use of the additive to chickens reared for laying and to minor poultry species for fattening at a dose range of 50 to 100 alpha-galactosidase units and of 285 to 570 glucanase units per kg feed (corresponding to 50 to 100 mg additive/kg feed). In a previous evaluation the additive was shown to be safe in chickens for fattening at a dose of 100 galactosidase and 570 glucanase units per kg feed. The FEEDAP Panel considers that this conclusion can be extended to chickens reared for laying. Given the margin of safety established for the major species, these conclusions can be extrapolated to minor poultry species for fattening. The potential of the product to be efficacious when used in chickens for fattening was previously established at the dose of  50 U galactosidase and 285 U glucanase per kg feed. The FEEDAP Panel considers that this conclusion applies to chickens reared for laying. Since the mode of action of the galactosidase and glucanase can be reasonably assumed to be the same in <b>all</b> <b>poultry</b> <b>species</b> the conclusion on efficacy in chickens for fattening can be extrapolated to include the minor poultry species for fattening...|$|E

40|$|Recently, deoxynivalenol- 3 -sulfate (DON- 3 -sulfate) was {{proposed}} {{as a major}} DON metabolite in poultry. In the present work, the first LC-MS/MS based method for determination of DON- 3 -sulfate, deepoxy-DON- 3 -sulfate (DOM- 3 -sulfate), DON, DOM, DON sulfonates 1, 2, 3, and DOM sulfonate 2 in excreta samples of chickens and turkeys was developed and validated. To this end, DOM- 3 -sulfate was chemically synthesized and characterized by NMR and LC-HR-MS/MS measurements. Application of the method to excreta and chyme samples of four feeding trials with turkeys, chickens, pullets, and roosters confirmed DON- 3 -sulfate as the major DON metabolite in <b>all</b> <b>poultry</b> <b>species</b> studied. Analogously to DON- 3 -sulfate, DOM- 3 -sulfate was formed after oral administration of DOM both in turkeys and in chickens. In addition, pullets and roosters metabolized DON into DOM- 3 -sulfate. In vitro transcription/translation assays revealed DOM- 3 -sulfate to be 2000 times less toxic on the ribosome than DON. Biological recoveries of DON and DOM orally administered to broiler chickens, turkeys, and pullets were 74 %– 106 % (chickens), 51 %– 72 % (roosters), and 131 %– 151 % (pullets). In pullets, DON- 3 -sulfate concentrations increased from jejunum chyme samples to excreta samples {{by a factor of}} 60. This result, put into context with earlier studies, indicates fast and efficient absorption of DON between crop and jejunum, conversion to DON- 3 -sulfate in intestinal mucosa, liver, and possibly kidney, and rapid elimination into excreta via bile and urine...|$|E

40|$|Many {{developing}} countries lack sufficient resources to conduct animal disease surveillance. In recent years, participatory epidemiology {{has been used}} to increase the cover and decrease the costs of surveillance. However, few diagnostic performance assessments have been carried out on participatory methods. The objective {{of the present study was}} to estimate the diagnostic performance of practitioners working for the Community-Based Animal Health and Outreach (CAHO) program, which is a participatory disease surveillance system for the detection of highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreaks in Egypt. CAHO practitioners' diagnostic assessment of inspected birds was compared with real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) test results at the household level. Diagnostic performance was estimated directly from two-by-two tables using RRT-PCR as a reference test in two different scenarios. In the first scenario, only results from chickens were considered. In the second scenario, results for <b>all</b> <b>poultry</b> <b>species</b> were analyzed. Poultry flocks in 916 households located in 717 villages were inspected by CAHO practitioners, who collected 3458 bird samples. In the first scenario, CAHO practitioners presented sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) estimates of 40 % (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 21 %– 59 %) and 92 % (95 % CI: 91 %– 94 %), respectively. In the second scenario, diagnostic performance estimates were Se = 47 % (95 % CI: 29 %– 65 %) and Sp = 88 % (95 % CI: 86 %– 90 %). A significant difference was observed only between Sp estimates (P < 0. 01). Practitioners' diagnostics and RRT-PCR results were in very poor agreement with kappa values of 0. 16 and 0. 14 for scenarios 1 and 2, respectively. However, the use of a broad case definition, the possible presence of immunity against the virus in replacement birds, and the low prevalence observed during the survey would negatively affect the practitioners' performance.

40|$|Introduction The {{occurrence}} of mycotoxins in foods and feeds {{is a problem}} of major concern in all over the world. Profitability of poultry production can be greatly affected due to the frequency of feed contamination and the detrimental effects of these toxins on the performance. Aflatoxins, a group of closely related and biologically active mycotoxins, are produced by strains of Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus. They commonly occur as natural contaminant of poultry feeds. Domestic animal species such as chickens, ducks, cattle and turkeys consuming sublethal doses of aflatoxins for several days developed a toxic syndrome in which liver damage was the most significant change. The biological effects of aflatoxins could be categorized into two groups, long term and short term effects. Long term effects included chronic toxicity, cancer, birth defects and genetic alterations. Aflatoxins affected <b>all</b> <b>poultry</b> <b>species,</b> although they generally take relatively high levels to cause mortality, low levels can be detrimental if continually fed. Material and Methods This study was conducted to determine the efficacy of mineral, organic toxin absorbents, humic acid and yeast cell wall on performance and internal organs weight of broilers in experimental aflatoxicosis. This study was conducted in a completely randomize design with 432 Ross- 308 broilers with 9 treatments, 4 replicates and 12 broilers in each replicate. Treatments included diet without aflatoxin, 2 : diet contaminated with aflatoxin, 3 : diet contaminated with aflatoxin and supplemented with 0. 20 Humic acid, 4 : diet contaminated with aflatoxin and supplemented with 0. 40 Humic acid, 5 : diet contaminated with aflatoxin and supplemented with 0. 60 Humic acid, 5 : diet contaminated with aflatoxin and supplemented with 0. 80 Humic acid, 6 : diet contaminated with aflatoxin and supplemented with 0. 80 Humic acid, 7 : diet contaminated with aflatoxin and supplemented with 1. 00 Humic acid, 8 : diet contaminated with aflatoxin and supplemented with 0. 50 sodium bentonite, 9 : diet with aflatoxin and supplemented with 0. 10 yeast cell wall.

40|$|First {{published}} June 11, 2014,In most Western countries, {{the consumption}} of fish is low and insufficient to provide the recommended daily intake of the n- 3 (ω- 3) long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20 : 5 n- 3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22 : 6 n- 3). Poultry {{has the potential to}} be a sustainable source of EPA and DHA if poultry species are capable of synthesizing these n- 3 PUFAs from dietary plant-derived α-linolenic acid (ALA; 18 : 3 n- 3). In most animals, the elongation of very long-chain fatty acids (ELOVL) enzyme ELOVL 2 is essential for conversion of dietary ALA to DHA because only ELOVL 2 and not ELOVL 5 can elongate docosapentaenoic acid (DPA; 22 : 5 n- 3) to 24 : 5 n- 3, the precursor of DHA. The chicken is the only poultry species in which elongase enzymes have been functionally characterized, and chicken ELOVL 5 had unique DPA-to- 24 : 5 n- 3 activity, which may enable chickens to synthesize more DHA than other animals. By using a yeast expression system, we examined the duck and turkey elongases, ELOVL 2 and ELOVL 5, to understand if <b>all</b> <b>poultry</b> <b>species</b> have similar potential to synthesize EPA and DHA. The duck and turkey ELOVL 5 enzymes were active with C 18 - 20 PUFAs only. The duck ELOVL 2 had a broad substrate specificity with C 18 - 22 PUFAs, whereas the turkey ELOVL 2 was active only with EPA and C 22 PUFAs. Both duck and turkey ELOVL 2 enzymes catalyzed 2 rounds of EPA elongation, with the products being DPA and its elongation product, 24 : 5 n- 3. With exogenous DPA, both duck and turkey ELOVL 2 synthesized 24 : 5 n- 3, with the duck ELOVL 2 being more active than the turkey ELOVL 2. The reason for the lack of DPA elongation activity by the duck and turkey ELOVL 5 enzymes compared with the chicken ELOVL 5 could not be elucidated by protein sequence comparisons. By using the elongase enzyme activities only as a predictor of DHA synthesis, ducks may have a similar ability to chickens to convert increasing dietary ALA to DHA. Melissa K. Gregory and Michael J.

40|$|Good feeding for {{guinea fowl}} Cue: Our next report comes from Blantyre in Malawi, where Patrick Mphaka {{reports on the}} growing {{popularity}} of guinea fowl among village poultry keepers. One reason for this popularity is a reported resistance of guinea fowl in Malawi to a major poultry disease, Newcastle disease, which every year has a devastating impact on unvaccinated poultry flocks. While this reported resistance may reflect a greater hardiness in guinea fowl to some common diseases, guinea fowl are, in fact vulnerable to Newcastle disease, in common with nearly <b>all</b> <b>poultry</b> <b>species,</b> and those keeping guinea fowl should follow appropriate steps to keep their birds disease free. IN:		?Traditionally, popular domestic birds? OUT:		?. Newcastle which troubles our chickens. ? DUR?N		 5 ? 00 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Village headman Magombo Ngondo ending that report on a community guinea fowl project in his village. Please note that while in his experience, guinea fowl are more resistant to Newcastle disease, veterinary advice suggests that guinea fowl are, in fact, vulnerable to the disease, in common with other poultry. Transcript Mphaka	Traditionally, popular domestic birds kept by most people here are chickens. These have their advantages, and, naturally, their disadvantages. One of the most menacing problems for the poor lot of chicken keepers is the seasonal outbreak of Newcastle disease. It is a big problem for most people because though easily preventable when appropriate vaccination is supplied to the birds, most of them can not afford it. The result is death en masse of chickens once or twice each year. 		Due to this problem, most people are turning their attention to alternative birds. To this end, the introduction of guinea fowls in some areas has become handy. To date, there are no locally known diseases which attack guinea fowls. This quality directly solves the problem most bird keepers have been having with chickens. Since the retail price of guinea fowls is higher than that of chickens, it has not been easy for most people to start rearing guinea fowls. There are some instances, however, where Non-Governmental organizations have intervened in introducing the birds to some communities. One such community is in Magombo Ngondo village in Traditional Authority Kuntaja in Blantyre district. The community here was given some twenty birds to keep on community level and that as the birds multiply, they can start sharing amongst themselves. I paid the village headman a visit {{to learn more about the}} feeding practices, among other relevant issues. Ngondo	[Vernac] As far as feeding is concerned, we provide them with food two or three times each day within the stall before we release them to fend for themselves outside. In addition, we also ensure that the water containers which you see there are cleaned and filled with clean water each day. We feed these guinea fowls with maize bran, sorghum, or sometimes we look for white ants, so that we are sure that when they are going to fend for themselves, they have already had enough food. Mphaka	You told me earlier that sometimes these birds are 100 % stall fed, and sometimes, like this period, they are on semi-free range. Would you elaborate on that? Ngondo	We stall feed them 100 % when we have just planted various crops in the fields. This is done to ensure that the planted seeds grow without being eaten away by the guinea fowls. As you know, these birds are very notorious with seed, especially maize. Once the seedlings are of good health, and can not be destroyed anymore by the guinea fowls, we then put them on semi-free range. Mphaka	These guinea fowls belong to the community. How does the community assist you in taking care of the guinea fowls in terms of feeding them and other things? Ngondo	The community assists in several ways. They take turns in making sure that the inside and outside of the guinea fowl house is clean. They are also the ones who do the actual feeding of the guinea fowls. Mphaka	Would you like to tell me the difference in terms of production of eggs between the times when you are giving them food inside their house, and when you are allowing them to go out free range? Ngondo	They lay eggs more continuously when they are on semi-free range. We think this is because they are able to supplement on the food we give them inside the stall. Again, we think that the space and fresh air which they enjoy outside, give them more freedom which make them healthier. Mphaka	What would you say is the advantage of rearing guinea fowls over chickens? Ngondo	Guinea fowls are better than chickens when it comes to diseases. Guinea fowls are resistant to Newcastle which troubles our chickens. End of track. Patrick Mphaka reports on a project that is introducing guinea fowl to farming communities in Malawi...|$|E

Furthermore, applied methods should be effective, have large capacity and animals should be unable to escape from it. In this thesis, animal welfare aspects, i. e. behavioural and physiological, and efficacy aspects of gas killing were assed for individual birds and groups of poultry. Observations during the 2003 HPAI outbreak in The Netherlands {{made it clear that}} whole house gassing with carbon dioxide is a method with high capacity and is relatively safe. Also, birds don’t have to be handled and transported to a killing device which is a major advantage for their welfare. Questions that raised about the suitability of carbon dioxide to kill ducks and turkeys were answered in experiments where ducks and turkeys were exposed to increasing carbon dioxide concentrations. In these experiments blood gas values, EEG’s and ECG’s confirmed that both species are equally sensitive to these increasing carbon dioxide concentrations. Furthermore, the results found in ducks and turkeys are comparable with results found in chickens and confirmed that <b>all</b> farmed <b>poultry</b> <b>species</b> can be killed by increasing the carbon dioxide concentration up to 40 - 45 %. However, it is unmistakaeble that killing animals always interferes with their welfare. Before loss of consciousness all animals express heavy breathing (gasping) and headshaking during a period of 2 to 3 minutes. Convulsions, if they occur, are seen after loss of consciousness. Therefore, it can be concluded that the period of compromised animal welfare is not longer than 3 minutes. This period of compromised animal welfare however, is shorter than when animals are caught and handled when using mobile gas containers or mobile electrocution lines. Large scale killing of animals for disease control purpose meets a lot of societal resistance, especially when alternatives like vaccination are available. Furthermore, the visibility of the depopulation of poultry farms makes people aware that {{large numbers of}} birds are killed in our society every year. The moral attitude of people towards killing animals is strongly coloured by the reason why we kill animals; killing for food is more accepted than for disease control. However, we should realize that animal welfare is presumably more compromised in the normal slaughter process than when killed in their housings for disease control. Also, it is not realized that the non vaccination policy is an economical policy to protect our export position, something that benefits producers and consumers. In respect of animal welfare and of the moral attitude of man the non- vaccination policy should be reconsidered. However, we must realize that there will always remain situations that farms must be depopulated and therefore we should provide maximum effort in further developing acceptable killing methods...|$|R

40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} {{determine the influence of}} varying lengths of adaptation on metabolisable energy (AME and AMEn) content of maize and barley for broilers, turkeys and laying hens using the difference method. Three hundred and twenty-four Cobb 500 male broiler chicks (Experiment 1), 162 BUT 10 male turkey poults (Experiment 2) or 162 Lohmann brown laying hens (Experiment 3) were offered a nutrient-adequate pre-experimental diet for at least 11 days. The birds were then allocated to 9 dietary treatments (a 3 × 3 factorial arrangement of treatments) with each treatment replicated 6 times. The factors were three diet types (based on wheat-soybean meal (WS), maize-wheat-soybean meal (MWS) or barley-wheat soybean meal (BWS)) and three length of adaptation to dietary treatments (10, 7 or 4 d). The WS was the references diet whereas MWS and BWS were the assay diets. The adaptation period corresponded to 10, 7 or 4 days of feeding experimental diets prior to the end of each experiment. Excreta were collected on the last two days of each experiment. The AME of maize and barley in the assay diets, in each experiment, were calculated using difference method. On all the responses considered, there was no significant diet type × adaptation length interaction in any of the <b>poultry</b> <b>species.</b> Regardless of the <b>poultry</b> <b>species,</b> AME was greater (P < 0. 05) for maize compared with barley. The AME (MJ/kg) for maize was 13. 5, 13. 5 and 13. 6 for broilers, turkeys and laying hens, respectively whereas the corresponding AME (MJ/kg) of barley was 12. 2, 11. 8 and 12. 6, respectively. The effect of adaptation length during AME assay was statistically significant in turkeys, tended to be significant in broilers but not significant for laying hens. It was concluded that irrespective of <b>poultry</b> <b>species,</b> the greater overriding factor affecting AME determined by the difference method is the particular feedstuff being assayed. However, length of adaptation to experimental diets during the assay becomes more important in birds with relatively physiologically immature digestive tract...|$|R

5000|$|In practice, an {{anesthetic}} {{is rarely}} used during dubbing {{and as a}} consequence, the RSPCA Australia is opposed to dubbing on poultry intended to be exhibited at shows, and describes the practice {{as a cause of}} pain and distress. [...] The comb and wattles function in thermoregulation; blood circulating from the comb and the wattles helps the bird lose heat during hot weather. The comb is also used in mate-assessment in some <b>poultry</b> <b>species.</b> Dubbing would interfere with both these functions of the comb and wattles.|$|R
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of gastrointestinal helminth parasites and the gross pathological lesions produced by them {{in different types}} of poultry were studied from March 2005 to March 2006, in the Department of Parasitology, Bangladesh Agricultural University, Mymensingh. In this study, 240 viscera of three types of poultry such as broiler, layer and backyard indigenous chickens were collected from local markets of Mymensingh district. During routine examination, total six species of helminth parasites were recorded, of which three species were nematodes such as Ascaridia galli, Heterakis gallinarum and Capillaria annulata; two species were cestodes such as Raillietina tetragona and Amoebotaenia sphenoides and only one species was belonged to trematode such as Catatropis verrucosa. Prevalence of different species of gastrointestinal helminths was highest in backyard poultry (100 %) followed by layer (48. 75 %) and broiler (3. 75 %) which was statistically significant (p < 0. 01). Backyard poultry was significantly (p < 0. 05) 168. 21 and 4106. 67 times more susceptible to helminth infection than layer and broiler respectively. But layer was 24. 41 times more susceptible to helminth infection than broiler. In backyard <b>poultry,</b> <b>all</b> six <b>species</b> of helminth parasites were found. A statistically significant (p < 0. 05) variation in the {{prevalence of}} the recovered parasites from backyard poultry were observed such as the prevalence of R. tetragona (100 %) was the highest followed by that of A. galli (87. 50 %) and H. gallinarum (80 %).
