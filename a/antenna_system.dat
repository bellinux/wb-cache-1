Two feeding networks, which constitute the proposed <b>antenna</b> <b>systems</b> with monopole patch antenna array, are designed to generate modes 1 and 2 of OAM waves.

25|$|Another problem {{addressed}} in the Mk. II {{was one of the}} signal being so wide that multiple aircraft would appear on the display. This was solved simply by adding a second transmission <b>antenna</b> <b>system.</b> One had a fairly narrow horizontal antenna spread, which caused the transmission to be similar to the Mk. I's 20 degrees. The other had a much wider antenna array, narrowing the pattern and making it much easier to pick out individual targets. The wide-pattern antenna would be used during initial pickup, and once a target was selected a switch was thrown to move the transmission to the narrow beam. Images exist that show both antennas combined on a single cabin.|$|E
25|$|The bearing {{measurement}} {{was received}} {{on a separate}} receiver and <b>antenna</b> <b>system.</b> In this case, two half-wave dipoles were used, located about one wavelength apart horizontally on the antenna framework. Both antennas were connected together electrically before entering the receivers, with the outputs {{of one of them}} inverted. This meant that the output signal would drop to zero when the antennas were precisely aligned with the target. Any mis-alignment changed the relative phase of the signals slightly, producing a net signal that entered the receiver and produced a display. However, {{it was not possible to}} know which of the two antennas was the one producing the net output; the system provided an indication of when the antenna was on-target, but not which side to turn to when it was off-target.|$|E

2500|$|If {{the signal}} from one {{polarization}} channel is {{received by the}} oppositely polarized antenna, it will cause crosstalk that degrades the signal-to-noise ratio. [...] The ability of an antenna to keep these orthogonal channels separate is measured by a parameter called cross polarization discrimination (XPD). [...] In a transmitting antenna, XPD is the fraction of power from an antenna of one polarization radiated in the other polarization. [...] For example, due to minor imperfections a dish with a vertically polarized feed antenna will radiate {{a small amount of}} its power in horizontal polarization; this fraction is the XPD. [...] In a receiving antenna, the XPD is the ratio of signal power received of the opposite polarization to power received in the same antenna of the correct polarization, when the antenna is illuminated by two orthogonally polarized radio waves of equal power. [...] If the <b>antenna</b> <b>system</b> has inadequate XPD, cross polarization interference cancelling [...] (XPIC) digital signal processing algorithms can often be used to decrease crosstalk.|$|E
