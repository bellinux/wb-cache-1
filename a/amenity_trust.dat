40|$|The {{importance}} of walking {{as a form}} of physical activity has been rising in prominence in recent years. This paper explores the results of a recent project looking at the walkability of Bristol and how this relates to physical activity, walking, health and well-being. Using data from the Bristol City Council annual quality of life survey, spanning a ten year period (2001 - 2011), the study examined the relationship between perceptions of the neighbourhood (e. g. neighbourhood satisfaction, access to <b>amenities,</b> safety and <b>trust)</b> and health and well-being outcomes (e. g. self-reported walking, physical activity, general health and well-being). These were supplemented with data on urban form (density, connectivity and land use mix) from Geographical Information Systems to explore the relationship between walkability and these outcomes. The relationships were explored over the ten year period to examine how changes in the perception of the neighbourhood over time are related to levels of physical activity, walking, health and well-being. The analyses demonstrate that (a) there is a relationship between residents’ perceptions of the neighbourhood and their overall health and well-being in Bristol; and (b) people report more physical activity in neighbourhoods that have a greater measured walkability and better quality walking environment...|$|R

40|$|Aim: To {{examine the}} walkability of Bristol {{and how this}} relates to {{physical}} activity, walking, health and well-being. Background: Walking is accessible {{to the majority of}} the population; it is low cost, requires no specialist equipment or training and can be relatively easily incorporated into daily routines. A recent review of the evidence base for investment in the walking environment (Sinnett et al., 2011) identified a number of gaps in the literature including the lack of evidence of the relationship between physical activity, travel choice and quality of life in the UK. Methodology: A city-wide repeat cross-sectional study in Bristol. Data from the Bristol City Council annual quality of life survey, spanning a ten year period (2001 - 2011), were used {{to examine the relationship between}} perceptions of the neighbourhood (e. g. neighbourhood satisfaction, access to <b>amenities,</b> safety and <b>trust)</b> and health and well-being outcomes (e. g. self-reported walking, physical activity, general health and well-being).

The relationships have been explored over the ten year period to examine how changes in the perception of the neighbourhood over time are related to levels of physical activity, walking, health and well-being. Results: The analyses demonstrate that (a) there is a relationship between residents’ perceptions of the neighbourhood and their overall health and well-being in Bristol; and (b) people report more physical activity in neighbourhoods that have a greater measured walkability and better quality walking environment. Conclusions: Investment in the walking environment has a positive impact on the level of physical activity of residents and their overall health and well-being...|$|R

5000|$|The Crucible of Iron Age Shetland is a {{combination}} of three sites in Shetland that have applied to be on the United Kingdom [...] "Tentative List" [...] of possible nominations for the UNESCO World Heritage Programme list of sites of outstanding cultural or natural importance to the common heritage of humankind. The application was made by the Shetland <b>Amenity</b> <b>Trust</b> in 2010, and in 2011 the site became one of 11 successful UK applications to join the Tentative List, three of them from Scotland.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} {{fell into}} disrepair but was restored with grants provided by P&O and the UK Government in 1970, {{the first phase}} being completed in 1976. It opened as a museum in 1987, was acquired by the Shetland Museums Service in 1991 and was run as a community museum by the Shetland <b>Amenity</b> <b>Trust.</b> The exhibition included period furnishings and other artefacts together with displays on fishing {{and the life of}} Anderson. In 2017 the building was a Shetland textile museum run by a board of trustees and exhibited Shetland textiles from 1800s to the present day including wool, jumpers, Fair Isle, lace, rugs and weaving.|$|E
50|$|Kintyre <b>Amenity</b> <b>Trust</b> (KAT) {{was formed}} in 1998 to lease the {{recently}} redundant Lorne Street Church from the Church of Scotland and open a Heritage Centre to compliment the existing Campbeltown Museum whose exhibits focused on archaeology and natural history. With grants and contributions from the local community the trustees established a museum that highlighted the different aspects of Campbeltown's success - it had the highest per capita income for any town in Scotland. This was based {{not only on the}} herring fishing industry but also coal, shipbuilding, whisky and agriculture. Exhibits were donated by many local people and the museum now holds a premier collection.|$|E

After completion a vast corridor of wasteland remained below the motorway. The North Kensington <b>Amenity</b> <b>Trust</b> (now Westway Development Trust), was founded in 1971 to reclaim and develop this land for local community use, and since 2000 local charity Urban Eye has initiated a programme of cleaning, painting, and lighting to brighten up and improve the safety of the areas under the flyover structure.|$|E

Researcher Euan MacKie has proposed a much smaller total for Scotland of 104.The origin of brochs is a subject of continuing research. Sixty years ago most archaeologists believed that brochs, usually regarded as the 'castles' of Iron Age chieftains, were built by immigrants who had been pushed northward after being displaced first by the intrusions of Belgic tribes into what is now southeast England {{at the end of}} the second century BC and later by the Roman invasion of southern Britain beginning in AD 43. Yet there is now little doubt that the hollow-walled broch tower was purely an invention in what is now Scotland; even the kinds of pottery found inside them that most resembled south British styles were local hybrid forms. The first of the modern review articles on the subject (MacKie 1965) did not, as is commonly believed, propose that brochs were built by immigrants, but rather that a hybrid culture formed from the blending of a small number of immigrants with the native population of the Hebrides produced them in the first century BC, basing them on earlier, simpler, promontory forts. This view contrasted, for example, with that of Sir Lindsay Scott, who argued, following Childe (1935), for a wholesale migration into Atlantic Scotland of people from southwest England.|$|E
5000|$|Palmer {{participated in}} the Notting Hill {{carnival}} festivities held annually since the mid-1960s, and had also been back to Trinidad to study the organisation and artistic forms of the carnival tradition there. He had been thinking of how the London event could be improved, by broadening it {{to make it more}} inclusive of all the Caribbean islands as well as of British-born black youth, and he was given the opportunity to begin implementing his plans after taking on the role of carnival organiser in 1973. Anthony Perry, former director of the North Kensington <b>Amenity</b> <b>Trust,</b> who provided Palmer with premises from which to operate at 3 Acklam Road, has said: [...] "I don’t think there was a Notting Hill Carnival as the world knows it until 1973 when Leslie Palmer really put some juice into it and turned it into an all-island event". In the words of Tom Vague: [...] "Under the administration of Leslie Palmer, the Notting Hill Peoples Carnival was transformed into an urban festival of black music, incorporating all aspects of Trinidad’s Carnival... getting sponsorship, recruiting more steel bands, reggae groups and sound systems, introducing generators and extending the route. The attendance went up accordingly from 3,000 {{at the beginning of the}} 70's to 30-50,000." [...] Palmer encouraged traditional masquerade, and for the first time in 1973 costume bands and steel bands from the various islands took part in the street parade, alongside the introduction of stationary sound systems, as distinct from those on moving floats, which as Alex Pascall has explained: [...] "created the bridge between the two cultures of carnival, reggae and calypso." [...] According to Claire Holder (Carnival organiser 1989-2002): [...] "Leslie Palmer brought the Caribbean community together because at the time when he became chairman of the carnival it was a purely Trinidadian thing. Leslie said, ‘there are so many aspects to Caribbean culture and it should all be represented.’ That act alone didn't just bring people into carnival; it actually impacted on our whole perception as Carnival people. His impact went beyond Carnival. It had an impact upon our existence as black people in this country." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{a number of}} surveys per-formed in a geographical area of the UK, part of which until recently was considered low radon risk. The Cumbrian re-gion was identified by the Building Research Establishment (BRE) in its 1999 guide as an area without a significant radon problem in the built environment. The geology of the region, which includes the Northern Pennine Orefield is varied, but consists of granites, andesites, tuffs, carbonates, sandstones and shales. Mineralisation has taken place (mostly lead and copper ores) primarily along fault and fracture zones, one example being Copper Valley, northwest of Coniston village. This work quantifies the risk of exposure to radon in a num-ber of abandoned mine environments. High radon levels, up to 28 589 Bq m− 3, have been measured in parts of one mine.

40|$|This memoir, and the 1 : 50 000 -scale {{geological}} {{map that}} it accompanies, are {{the products of}} a contract between the Natural Environment Research Council and the University of Liverpool to produce the map; and a subsequent contract between the British Geological Survey and Professor Derek Flinn to produce the memoir. Such contracts stem from the NERC policy of encouraging academics with substantial knowledge about specific areas in the UK to transfer their information into the public domain. This is done by funding them to extend mapping from areas {{in which they have}} worked to the boundaries of BGS map sheets. The maps, and accompanying descriptive memoirs (supported by open file reports and archives), are then published by the British Geological Survey. In the case of Unst and Fetlar the contracts have built on more than fifty years of experience of Shetland geology possessed by Professor Flinn, who resurveyed the solid and drift geology of the 1 : 50 000 -scale Unst and Fetlar sheet (Sheet 131) and is the main author of this memoir. He had also earlier surveyed the area of Central Shetland (Sheet 128), published by the Institute of Geological Sciences (now BGS) as 1 inch to 1 mile geological maps in 1981 and 1982, and more recently produced the 1 : 50 000 -scale geological map (Sheet 130) and accompanying memoir for the neighbouring island of Yell, published by the BGS in 1994. The 1 : 50 000 -scale geological map of Unst and Fetlar (Sheet 131), to which this memoir relates, was published by the BGS in 2002. Some minor changes in interpretation by the author since that date have been incorporated in this memoir, which includes information gathered and interpretations made up to and including 2007. Sadly Derek Flinn passed away in June 2012, whilst this memoir was undergoing final preparations for publication. The British Geological Survey is proud to publish it in his memory, reflecting a lifetime of dedicated geological work on Shetland in general and on Unst and Fetlar in particular. The printing of this memoir has been funded {{with the support of the}} Shetland <b>Amenity</b> <b>Trust</b> in recognition of Professor Flinn's contribution to Shetland Geology...|$|E
