40|$|Abstract – The {{present study}} {{deals with the}} {{physicochemical}} interactions between aroma compounds and various dairy media used as models of complex food matrices, {{as well as the}} consequences of the interactions on aroma partitioning between the air and matrix. Five aroma compounds were investigated: <b>amyl</b> and isoamyl <b>acetate,</b> ethyl pentanoate, hexanal and t- 2 -hexenal. Skim milk, anhydrous milk fat and full-fat cream were chosen as dairy media, while water was used as a reference medium. Apparent partition coefficients of the five aromas were determined between the air and media between 30 and 80 °C by static headspace-gas chromatography. Partition coefficients over full-fat cream were also calculated from partition coefficients over skim milk and anhydrous milk fat. Compared with water, a significant retention of t- 2 -hexenal was observed in skim milk (nearly 90 % whatever the temperature), whereas the retention of the other aromas varied from 6 % for isoamyl acetate to 40 % for hexanal in skim milk. Hydrophobic interactions were responsible for the retention of esters, whereas covalent binding of t- 2 -hexenal by dairy proteins was probably involved. The volatility of the 5 aromas was drastically reduced over anhydrous milk fat, because of their hydrophobic nature (log P> 1). There were discrepancies between calculated and measured partition coefficients over full-fat cream, which depended on aroma compounds an...|$|R
40|$|We {{asked whether}} odor {{discrimination}} abilities are sexually dimorphic in mice and, if so, whether the perinatal actions of estradiol contribute to these sex differences. The ability to discriminate {{different types of}} urinary odors was compared in male and female wild-type (WT) subjects and in mice with a hornozygous-null mutation of the estrogen synthetic enzyme, aromatase (aromatase knockout; ArKO). Olfactory discrimination was assessed in WT and ArKO male and female mice after they were gonadectomized in adulthood and subsequently treated with estradiol benzoate. A liquid olfactometer {{was used to assess}} food-motivated olfactory discrimination capacity. All animals eventually learned to distinguish between urinary odors collected from gonadally intact males and estrous females; however, WT males as well as ArKO mice of both sexes learned this discrimination significantly more rapidly than WT females. Similar group differences were obtained when mice discriminated between urinary odors collected from gonadally intact vs. castrated males or between two non-social odorants, <b>amyl</b> and butyl <b>acetate.</b> When subjects had to discriminate volatile urinary odors from ovariectomized female mice treated with estradiol sequenced with progesterone versus estradiol alone, ArKO females quickly acquired the task whereas WT males and females as well as ArKO males failed to do so. These results demonstrated a strong sex dimorphism in olfactory discrimination ability, with WT males performing better than females. Furthermore, female ArKO mice showed an enhanced ability to discriminate very similar utinary odorants, perhaps due to an increased sensitivity of the main olfactory nervous system to adult estradiol treatment as a result perinatal estrogen deprivation.

40|$|ABSTRAGT Electrical {{recording}} {{from small}} twigs of nerve in a tortoise showed that olfactory, vomeronasal, and trigeminal receptors {{in the nose}} are responsive to various odorants. No one kind of receptor was most sensitive to all odorants. For controlled stimulation, odorant was caused to appear in a stream of gas already flowing through the nose.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{neonatal}} unilateral restriction or increased olfactory stimulation upon {{the development of}} social play behavior in Wistar strain rats was investigated. Pups were unilaterally thermocauterized {{in one of the}} nares on postnatal day 3 (experiment 1), or exposed to <b>amyl</b> <b>acetate</b> from 3 to 19 days of age (experiment 2). Unilateral odor deprivation significantly increased the frequency of boxing, wrestling and pinning in rats of both sexes. However, <b>amyl</b> <b>acetate</b> exposure significantly decreased the frequency of wrestling and pinning in females with no effects in males. The alterations in the development of social play behavior are concurrent with gross physical olfactory bulb modifications that may reflect a significant interference with the integration and transmission of olfactory stimuli to central structures such as septal, entorhinal, cingulate and midline frontal cortices subserving social play behavior. Data suggest that early in life brain mechanisms underlying social play behavior are sensitive to manipulation of neonatal olfactory cues and may participate in the modulation of this behavior.

40|$|Effects of odorants on {{voltage-gated}} ionic channels {{were investigated}} in isolated newt olfactory receptor cells {{by using the}} whole cell version of the patch–clamp technique. Under voltage clamp, membrane depolarization to voltages between − 90 mV and + 40 mV from a holding potential (Vh) of − 100 mV generated time- and voltage-dependent current responses; a rapidly (< 15 ms) decaying initial inward current and a late outward current. When odorants (1 mM <b>amyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> 1 mM acetophenone, and 1 mM limonene) were applied to the recorded cell, the voltage-gated currents were significantly reduced. The dose-suppression relations of <b>amyl</b> <b>acetate</b> for individual current components (Na+ current: INa, T-type Ca 2 + current: ICa,T, L-type Ca 2 + current: ICa,L, delayed rectifier K+ current: IKv and Ca 2 +-activated K+ current: IK(Ca)) could be fitted by the Hill equation. Half-blocking concentrations for each current were 0. 11 mM (INa), 0. 15 mM (ICa,T), 0. 14 mM (ICa,L), 1. 7 mM (IKv), and 0. 17 mM (IK(Ca)), and Hill coefficient was 1. 4 (INa), 1. 0 (ICa,T), 1. 1 (ICa,L), 1. 0 (IKv), and 1. 1 (IK(Ca)), suggesting that the inward current is affected more strongly than the outward current. The activation curve of INa was not changed significantly by <b>amyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> while the inactivation curve was shifted to negative voltages; half-activation voltages were − 53 mV at control, − 66 mV at 0. 01 mM, and − 84 mV at 0. 1 mM.

The evoked potentials changed with repetitive stimulation. The N 90 component was not present initially and only appeared after several stimuli.

In this study we compared the frequency and time spent visiting the source of urine obtained from unrelated female subjects and <b>amyl</b> <b>acetate</b> odors vs water in adult perinatally underfed rats.
