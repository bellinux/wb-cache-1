500|$|McKinley {{had been}} given nutritive enemas; on September 11, he took some broth by mouth. [...] When it seemed to do him good, the {{following}} morning they allowed him toast, coffee, and chicken broth. [...] His subsequent pain was diagnosed as indigestion; he was given purgatives and most doctors left after their evening consultation. [...] In the early morning of September 13, McKinley suffered a collapse. [...] Urgent word to return to Buffalo was sent to Vice President Roosevelt, [...] from the nearest telegraph or telephone in the Adirondack wilderness; a park ranger was sent to find him. [...] Specialists were summoned; although at first some doctors hoped that McKinley might survive with a weakened heart, by afternoon they knew the case was hopeless. As yet unknown to the doctors, gangrene was growing {{on the walls of}} his stomach and toxins were passing into his blood. [...] McKinley drifted {{in and out of consciousness}} all day; when awake he was the model patient. [...] By evening, McKinley too knew he was dying, [...] "It is useless, gentlemen. I think we ought to have prayer." [...] His friends and family were admitted, and the First Lady sobbed over him, [...] "I want to go, too. [...] I want to go, too." [...] Her husband replied, [...] "We are all going, we are all going. [...] God's will be done, not ours" [...] and with final strength put <b>an</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her.</b> [...] He may also have sung part of his favorite hymn, [...] "Nearer, My God, to Thee", although other accounts have her singing it softly to him. [...] Ida McKinley was led away, her place briefly taken by Senator Hanna. [...] Morgan recounts their final encounter, [...] "Sometime that terrible evening, Mark Hanna had approached the bedside, tears standing in his eyes, his hands and head shaking in disbelief that thirty years of friendship could end thus." [...] When a tentative, formal greeting gained no coherent response, Hanna [...] "cried out over the years of friendship, 'William, William, don't you know me?'" ...|$|E
60|$|I leaped up, flung Heineccius fairly {{into the}} fire, {{ran to her}} side, and cast <b>an</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> sobbing body.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Carvel winced. He put <b>an</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her.</b> He, {{thought of}} his lonely widowerhood, of her whose place Virginia had taken.|$|E
6000|$|He {{stepped over}} to Mrs. Green, and putting <b>a</b> strong <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> raised {{her to her}} feet. [...] "And what's mine is mother's," [...] he concluded, and, helping her across the room, placed her in the best arm-chair.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wal, all right. Come over heah," [...] he replied, {{and drew}} {{her away from}} the camp fire, out in the shadow of gloom. [...] "Poor kid! I shore feel bad aboot it." [...] He put <b>a</b> long <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> waist and drew her against him. Ellen felt it, yet did not offer any resistance. All her faculties seemed absorbed in a morbid and sad anticipation.|$|R
60|$|With a woman's {{intuitive}} tact and poetry, she had, as she spoke, slowly {{shifted her}} position {{so as to}} bring the mute figure of the ruined man {{between her and her}} audience, hiding in the shadow behind it, as if she offered it as a tacit apology for her actions. Silent and expressionless, it yet spoke for her; helpless, crushed, and smitten with the Divine thunderbolt, it still stretched <b>an</b> invisible <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have been}} enchanted," [...] {{answered}} the girl, throwing <b>an</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> {{old friend and}} hugging him tight in her joy. [...] "But it's all right, now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{seems like}} our Fate," [...] said Annie, who now sat up without <b>an</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her,</b> the {{protecting}} woods having been left behind, [...] "he just takes us along without our having {{anything to do}} with it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just {{the thing}}!" [...] exclaimed Bince; [...] "just {{the thing for}} him. The long sea voyage will do him a world of good. And now," [...] he said, {{stepping}} to her side and putting <b>an</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
60|$|He placed <b>a</b> huge <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her,</b> {{and drew}} {{her to his}} lap. As she sat there, his great bulk made her seem smaller than she really was. With her hair down and her little red {{slippers}} dangling half a yard from the floor, she seemed a child. McEachern, looking at her, {{found it hard to}} realize that nineteen years had passed since the moment when the doctor's raised eyebrows had reproved him for his monosyllabic reception of the news that the baby was a girl.|$|R
6000|$|A sudden {{perception}} of delicacy, {{the thought that}} he should have spoken before her failure at the Conservatoire had made her feel her helplessness, brought a slight color to his cheek. Would it not seem to her that he was taking an unfair advantage of her misfortune? Yet it would be so easy now to slip <b>a</b> loving <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> waist, while he could work for her and protect her with the other. THE OTHER! His eye fell on his empty sleeve. Ah, he had forgotten that! He had but ONE arm! ...|$|R
60|$|I had {{the strongest}} disinclination to be {{mixed up in}} such an affair, but I could see no escape from it. There were even marks of bruises on the poor woman's face, and when, {{promising}} assistance, I went out to see to the horses and think it over, Minnie Fletcher burst into hysterical sobbing as Aline placed <b>an</b> <b>arm</b> protectingly <b>around</b> <b>her.</b> She had retired before I returned, for I fancied that Aline could dispense with my presence and I found something to detain me.|$|R
60|$|Rose {{came near}} going on. If she had, {{it would have}} lost her a good friend. She felt that and so, when the Doctor put <b>an</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> to lead {{her back to the}} desk, she yielded, but she was still palpitating with the heat of her wrath.|$|E
60|$|Then he gave {{a little}} beckoning signal and the girl turned to slip on a light coat, for the nights were chill on the mountain. Afterward she unfastened her outside door and joined the detective, who passed <b>an</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> and led her {{to one of the}} benches on the bluff.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, my {{poor little}} child, I see all my fault," [...] and he drew {{her to his}} side and put <b>an</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> {{and tried to make}} his peace with her, but her temper was up so high that she could not get it down right away, but buried her head against his breast and broke out crying and said: ...|$|E
60|$|Belding leisurely followed. She {{went into}} the corral, removed Jose's bridle, and {{led him to the}} watering-trough. Belding came up, and without saying {{anything}} began to unbuckle Jose's saddle girths. But he ventured a look at Nell. The red had gone from her face, and he was surprised to see her eyes brimming with tears. Most assuredly this was not one of Nell's tantrums. While taking off Jose's saddle and hanging it in the shed Belding pondered in his slow way. When he came back to the corral Nell had her face against the bars, and she was crying. He slipped <b>a</b> big <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> and waited. Although it was not often expressed, there was a strong attachment between them.|$|R
60|$|She had no {{consciousness}} {{of how long}} the hideous journey lasted. Her benumbed senses were suddenly awakened by a shock; the chant had ceased, the moving mass {{in which she was}} imbedded rolled forward once more as if by its own elasticity, and then receded again with a jar that almost unseated her. Then the inarticulate murmur was overborne by a voice. It was HIS! She turned blindly towards it; but before she could utter the cry that rose to her lips, she was again lifted from the saddle, carried forward, and gently placed upon {{what seemed to be a}} moss-grown bank. Opening her half swimming eyes she recognized the Indian cross. The crowd seemed to recede before her. Her eyes closed again as <b>a</b> strong <b>arm</b> passed <b>around</b> <b>her</b> waist.|$|R
5000|$|The {{music video}} {{features}} G-Dragon playing two parts: himself, and the cheating boyfriend {{of the female}} character (played by Jennie Kim from BLACKPINK).At {{the start of the}} video G-Dragon is shown looking through his blinds but before it reveals what he sees the video turns to see him singing. The video is turned back to him looking through the blinds to see the cheating boyfriend taking off his ring before turning away to leave his room. The boyfriend is then seen hugging a girl wearing flashy clothes. The scene cuts to one of Jennie Kim on the phone visibly upset. G-Dragon is shown, also upset, in his own room. Jennie is shown again on the phone but is much happier, smiling and laughing. During the bridge of the song is shows Jennie submerging underwater in a bathtub then switches to G-Dragon emerging from water, both still dressed. The video ends with G-Dragon and Jennie sitting on <b>a</b> couch, his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> shoulders. It's not clear whether it is or is not the cheating boyfriend. During the video there are scenes of G-Dragon singing in several different locations and English lyrics, that he sings, appear in different ways. [...] "I'm Sorry" [...] appears written on a piece of torn, crumpled paper for example.|$|R
6000|$|His manner {{said more}} than his words. Mary Louise grew white and pressed {{her hands to her}} heart, {{regarding}} the lawyer with eyes questioning and full of fear. Irene turned a sympathetic gaze upon her friend and Aunt Hannah came closer to the girl and slipped <b>an</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> waist, as if to help her to endure this unknown trial. And Mary Louise, feeling she could not bear the suspense, asked falteringly: ...|$|E
6000|$|Alora drew a quick {{breath and}} clasped {{her hands over}} her heart. Uncongenial as the two had been, Jason Jones was her father--her only {{remaining}} parent--and the suddenness of his death shocked and horrified the girl. Indeed, all present were horrified, yet Mary Louise seemed to bear the news more composedly than the others--as if it were a minor incident in a great drama. She slipped <b>an</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> girl friend's waist and said soothingly: ...|$|E
6000|$|Sir Robert and Lady Willoughby {{passed a}} month in the valley. Nick had been buried within the bushes; and even Maud had come to look upon this strange {{conjunction}} of graves, with the eye of a Christian, blended with the tender regrets of a woman. The day that the general and his wife left the valley for ever, they paid a final visit to the graves. Here Maud wept for an hour. Then her husband, passing <b>an</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> waist, drew her gently away; saying, as they were quitting the inclosure-- ...|$|E
60|$|Rose felt Isabel's <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> as {{she entered}} the cloakroom.|$|R
60|$|The <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> {{shoulder}} pressed encouragement, {{but he did}} not speak.|$|R
60|$|He {{passed his}} <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> {{and pulled her}} down on his knees.|$|R
60|$|Lise {{was going}} to have a child! Why hadn't she guessed it? A child! Perhaps she, Janet, would have a child! This {{enlightenment}} as to Lise's condition and the possibility it suggested in regard to herself brought with it an overwhelming sympathy which at first she fiercely resented then yielded to. The bond between them, instead of snapping, had inexplicably strengthened. And Lise, despite her degradation, was more than ever her sister! Forgetting her repugnance to the bed, Janet sat down beside Lise and put <b>an</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
60|$|They helped {{themselves}} to whisky and soda. There were still many explanations to be given. Half-concealed by the curtain, Philippa {{stood with her}} eyes turned seawards. The green light was dimmer now, and the low, black outline of the trawler crept slowly over the glittering track of moonlight. She gave a little start as it came into sight. There was a sob in her throat, tears burning in her eyes. Her fingers clutched the curtains almost passionately. She stood there watching until her eyes ached. Then she felt <b>an</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> waist and her husband's whisper in her ear.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Cassidy slipped <b>an</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> chum. [...] "You poor thing!" [...] she said. [...] "But {{everybody}} can't have {{a husband}} like Jack. Marriage wouldn't be no failure if they was all like him. These discontented wives you hear about--what they need is a man {{to come home and}} kick their slats in once a week, and then make it up in kisses, and chocolate creams. That'd give 'em some interest in life. What I want is a masterful man that slugs you when he's jagged and hugs you when he ain't jagged. Preserve me from the man that ain't got the sand to do neither!" ...|$|E
60|$|Stella passed <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> cousin's neck. Virginia {{looked up}} a little timidly.|$|R
60|$|Lucy put <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> father's {{neck and}} placed her cheek against his.|$|R
60|$|He {{held his}} thin {{trembling}} <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> and devoured {{her face with}} his eyes.|$|R
60|$|He {{scrambled}} up quickly enough and glanced over the side. Then {{he looked at}} Trot, who sat quite still, with a serious, far-away look in her sweet eyes. The boat was now speeding swiftly of its own accord, following {{the line of the}} circular basin round and round and gradually drawing nearer to the great hole in the center. Any further effort to escape the whirlpool was useless, and realizing this fact Cap'n Bill turned toward Trot and put <b>an</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her,</b> as if to shield her from the awful fate before them. He did not try to speak, because the roar of the waters would have drowned the sound of his voice.|$|E
60|$|Lenore {{had time}} for one {{look at his face}} before he enveloped her. What a relief to hide her own! It was pressed to his breast very closely. Her eyes shut, and she felt hot tears under the lids. All before her darkened sight seemed confusion, {{whirling}} chaos. It seemed that she could not breathe and, strangely, did not need to. How unutterably happy she felt! That was an age-long moment--wonderful for her own relief and gladness--full of changing emotions. Presently Kurt appeared to be coming to some semblance of rationality. He released her from that crushing embrace, but still kept <b>an</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> while he held her off and looked at her.|$|E
6000|$|Then blindly, as if {{drawn by}} a magnet, she bent to his lips. I could not turn away my head, though my {{instincts}} were delicate enough. I believe that kiss {{was the first}} kiss of love for both Diane Sampson and Vaughn Steele. It was so strange and so long, and somehow beautiful. Steele looked rapt. I could only see the side of Diane's face, and that was white, like snow. After she raised her head she seemed unable, for a moment, to take up her task {{where it had been}} broken off, and Steele lay as if he really were dead. Here I got up, and seating myself beside Sally, I put <b>an</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her.</b> [...] "Sally dear, there are others," [...] I said.|$|E
60|$|He {{passed his}} <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> tiny waist. She {{looked at him}} with frightened eyes.|$|R
60|$|CURTIS--[Puts his <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> protectingly.] Nonsense! You're not {{the sort}} that ever grows old.|$|R
60|$|He put his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> shoulders, and the {{strength}} of it seemed to calm her.|$|R
