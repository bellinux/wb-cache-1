The roller coaster was built in 1985 and had previously operated at Wiener Prater in Austria and Alton Towers in England, before opening at Idlewild in 1993. Kennywood continued the Macdonald tradition of offering large-scale entertainment, presenting circuses, lumberjack and acrobatics shows, and stage performances at the new Hillside Theater. A large picnic area with several log pavilions and game fields was added in 1999.

25|$|Degradation during service life, {{or after}} {{careless}} disposal, is a chemical change that drastically reduces the {{average molecular weight}} of the polyvinyl chloride polymer. Since the mechanical integrity of a plastic depends on its high average molecular weight, wear and tear inevitably weakens the material. Weathering degradation of plastics results in their surface embrittlement and microcracking, yielding microparticles that continue on in the environment. Also known as microplastics, these particles act like sponges <b>and</b> <b>soak</b> up Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) around them. Thus laden {{with high levels of}} POPs, the microparticles are often ingested by organisms in the biosphere.|$|E

The aims of this {{research was}} to know the protein content, fat content, water content and ash content. This research was based on Completely Randomized Design with factorial pattern (two factors) with two repetitions. The first factor was the concentration of betle leaf juice (0 %, 5 %, 10 % and 15 %) and the second factor was the soaking duration (0, 5, 15 and 15 hours). The results showed that increasing betle leaf juice <b>and</b> <b>soaking</b> duration gave very significant effect (P< 0, 01) to increase protein content, to lower fat content and water content but no significant effect on ash content.

25|$|Researchers {{have also}} been experimenting with other methods, such as fumigation, injecting the mound, mound {{drenching}}, and surface dusting. Mound drenching entails pouring large volumes of toxic liquid into the mound. While this may affect {{a large portion of}} the mound, it is possible it may not reach the queen, thus preventing the destruction of the colony. Surface dusting is similar to mound drenching, except insecticides are applied on top of the mound <b>and</b> <b>soak</b> into the soil when wet. Mound injections use pressurising and injecting insecticides into the mound, but the queen may not be affected by this. Mounds can be eliminated effectively through fumigation. Broadcast treatment is sometimes used by spraying infected areas with agricultural equipment. Finally, spot treatment with insecticides can be used by drilling and injecting the mound with residual insecticide.|$|E
25|$|The tangle net, or tooth net, {{originated}} in British Columbia, Canada, as a gear specifically developed for selective fisheries. Tangle nets have smaller mesh sizes than standard gillnets. They {{are designed to}} catch fish by their nose or jaw, enabling bycatch to be resuscitated and released unharmed. Tangle nets as adapted to the mark-selective fishery for spring Chinook salmon on the lower Columbia River have a standard mesh size of 4-1/4inches (10.8cm.). Short net lengths <b>and</b> <b>soak</b> times are used {{in an effort to}} land fish in good condition. Tangle nets are typically used in situations where the release of certain (usually wild) fish unharmed is desirable. In a typical situation calling for the use of a tangle net, for instance, all fish retaining their adipose fins (usually wild) must be returned to the water. Tangle nets are used in conjunction with a live recovery box, which acts as a resuscitation chamber for unmarked fish that appear lethargic or stressed before their release into the water.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} noncovalent bonding and {{mechanical}} interlocking of carbon nanotubes (CNT) coating on tensile and interfacial strength of glass fiber were investigated. CNT were coated over glass fiber {{by a simple}} dip coating method. Acid treated CNT were suspended in isopropanol solution containing Nafion as binding agent. To achieve uniform distribution of CNT over the glass fiber, an optimized dispersion process was developed by two parameters: CNT concentration <b>and</b> <b>soaking</b> time. CNT concentration was varied from 0. 4 to 2 [*]mg/mL <b>and</b> <b>soaking</b> time was varied from 1 to 180 [*]min. The provided micrographs demonstrated appropriate coating of CNT on glass fiber by use of CNT-Nafion mixture. The effects of CNT concentration <b>and</b> <b>soaking</b> time on coating layer were studied by performing single fiber tensile test and pull-out test. The obtained {{results showed that the}} optimum CNT concentration <b>and</b> <b>soaking</b> time were 1 [*]mg/mL and 60 [*]min, respectively, which led to significant improvement of tensile strength and interfacial shear stress. It was found that, at other concentrations <b>and</b> <b>soaking</b> times, CNT agglomeration or acutely curly tubes appeared over the fiber surface which caused a reduction of nanotubes interaction on the glass fiber...|$|R

A Central Composite Design of Response Surface methodology (RSM) was employed to optimize the SC-CO 2 extraction parameters.

The oil yield varied with the linear, quadratic and interaction of pressure, temperature, flow rate <b>and</b> <b>soaking</b> time. Optimum points were observed within the variables of temperature from 35 °C to 80 °C, pressure from 10 MPa to 40 MPa, flow rate from 1 mL/min to 3 mL/min <b>and</b> <b>soaking</b> time from 1 h to 4 h.

Soaking times were measured within interval 10 hours up to 40 hours. Boiling times were measured within interval 10 minutes to 60 minutes. The latter stage was used to compose fuzzy inference system. Using 24 fuzzy rules implemented in the system, the result was used to find the optimum boiling <b>and</b> <b>soaking</b> process timeduring tempeh production. Comparison with actual data was made by means of quadratic regression analysis (SEE= 14) and found that fuzzy logic (SEE= 2) was more accurate resulting in a lower error prediction value in finding the most optimum solution of the processes time...|$|R
