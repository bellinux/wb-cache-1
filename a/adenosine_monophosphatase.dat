40|$|Cytochemkal {{study was}} {{performed}} in rat adrenal medulla on thiamine pyropbos-phatase (TPPase), add phosphatase (ACPase), nucleoside mono-, di- and tripbos-phatases. Enzyme localizations were TPPase, inosine dipbosphatase (IDP-ase) and ACPase in Golgl apparatuses and ACPase in lysosomes. TPPase, IDPase and adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activities were present at axon-Schwann interspace {{as well as at}} the space between Schwann cells and medul-lary cells, while they were absent at the portion where the medullary cells were facing each other. <b>Adenosine</b> <b>monophosphatase</b> activities were negative in the medullary cells, although positive result has been reported. No correlation was found between phosphatase localizations and two types of medullary cells by aldehyde-osmium fixation. Cytochemkal localization of Ca ++ activated ATPase at pH 6. 5 has been reported in Golgi apparatuses and catecbolamine granules by Benedeczky el at. The tissues similarly processed showed weak reaction in Golgi apparatuses an...|$|E
40|$|A light {{microscopy}} {{study on the}} localization of enzyme activity within atherosclerotic human intracranial arteries was performed on autopsy material obtained within 4 hours of death. The data suggests that the atherosclerotic process first goes through a proliferative phase and then a degenerative phase culminating {{in the formation of}} a plaque. In the proliferative phase, smooth muscle cell proliferation has formed a thickened intima. Tetrazolium reductase, adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) and <b>adenosine</b> <b>monophosphatase</b> (AMPase) activities are present in these cells, while all dehydrogenases and acid phosphatase activities were weak or not present. As the degenerative phase commences, an area of necrosis, lipid and macrophage accumulation is formed on the lumen side of the elastica. This area increases in size until a plaque is formed. Unsaturated polar and nonpolar lipid, cholesterol, α-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, acid phosphatase, and AMPase activities are associated with these areas and in foam cells, which are often found in the thickened intima of the proliferative phase. Tetrazolium reductase and ATPase activities decrease in the thickened intima as the area of necrosis increases in size, while dehydrogenase activity, except that for α-glycerophosphate, remains low or not present. Patterns of enzyme alterations for various stages of the disease process in intracranial arteries, the aorta and coronary arteries suggest a similar, if not identical, progression of the atherosclerotic process, irrespective of known differences in the prevalence of atherosclerosis...|$|E
