40|$|Recent {{experimental}} {{measurements of}} induction time made by direct observation with the 'Milli-Timer' indicated that <b>angular</b> <b>particles</b> {{were able to}} attach much more rapidly than spherical particles. There was around a tenfold difference in the respective induction periods for particle-bubble attachment. For industrial application, a more holistic comparison is needed, with the induction period for attachment being just one input. Over the years, CSIRO has developed a CFD-flotation model that incorporates both rigorous hydrodynamics, to simulate real industrial cell geometries, and a detailed model of the embedded flotation process, in which the induction period is an important parameter. We conducted transient modelling of batch flotation. First, spherical particles were modelled, as a 'baseline', for different particle sizes and levels of hydrophobicity. In {{the second set of}} results, the induction period was decreased by a factor of up to ten, simulating flotation of <b>angular</b> <b>particles.</b> Flotation recovery was found to depend upon induction period in a complex manner. For highly hydrophobic or fine particles, the induction period for spheres was already so low that recovery was limited by other factors (e. g. bubble-particle collision frequency). Further decreases in induction period, as for <b>angular</b> <b>particles,</b> did not {{have a significant effect on}} recovery in these cases. By contrast, when weakly hydrophobic or coarse particles were modelled, the recovery was predicted to be greatly enhanced for <b>angular</b> <b>particles,</b> in comparison to spheres. For these particles the induction period was limiting recovery, so that the flotation rate constant could be improved directly by reducing the induction period. This is consistent with batch flotation experiments using Ballotini reported earlier. Therefore, when dealing with weakly hydrophobic particles or relatively large particles that are to be floated, an enhancement can be expected for more angular particle shapes. In such cases, judicious specification of the grinding circuit may improve the overall efficiency. 11 page(s...|$|E

It {{deals with the}} creation of Mach cones which are supposed to exhibit a characteristic structure in the measured <b>angular</b> <b>particle</b> distributions allowing for direct conclusions about the Equation of State and in particular about the speed of sound of the medium. Several different scenarios of jet energy loss are examined and different mechanisms of energy and momentum loss are analyzed, ranging from weak interactions (based on calculations from perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics, pQCD) to strong interactions (formulated using the Anti-de-Sitter/Conformal Field Theory Correspondence, AdS/CFT). Though they result in different <b>angular</b> <b>particle</b> correlations which could in principle allow to distinguish the underlying processes, it is shown that the characteristic structure observed in experimental data can be obtained due to the different contributions of several possible jet trajectories through an expanding medium. Such a structure cannot directly be connected to the Equation of State. In this context, the impact of a strong flow created behind the jet (the diffusion wake) is examined which is common to almost all jet deposition scenarios. Besides that, the transport equations for dissipative hydrodynamics are discussed which are fundamental for any numerical computation of viscous effects in a Quark-Gluon Plasma. Comment: Ph. D.

40|$|Porous asphalt is a {{flexible}} pavement layer with highly interconnected air voids constructed using an opengraded type of aggregate. The aggregate shape and surface texture serve a vital function {{in determining the}} engineering properties and performance of porous asphalt. The angular aggregates with clearly defined fracture faces and sharp edges encourage better interlocking between the aggregates' skeleton structures, which makes them preferable to use in asphalt mixtures. This study evaluates the effect of aggregate angularity on the engineering properties and performance of porous asphalt using both conventional and empirical particle index test methods. The term “engineering properties” refers to the experimental works determining resilient modulus and stability, whereas “performance” deals with the porosity and durability characteristics of porous asphalt caused by variations in the particle index number (Ia). A laboratory data analysis shows that <b>angular</b> <b>particles</b> provide a larger Ia number than non-angular particles. Furthermore, resilient modulus and stability properties significantly improve when angular aggregates are applied.

Microstructural complexities such as the inhomogeneous spatial distribution of particles, irregular morphology of the particles, and anisotropy in particle orientation after secondary processing, such as extrusion, significantly affect deformation behavior. We have studied the effect of particle/matrix interface debonding in SiC particle reinforced Al alloy matrix composites with (a) actual microstructure consisting of angular SiC particles and (b) idealized ellipsoidal SiC particles. Tensile deformation in SiC particle reinforced Al matrix composites was modeled using actual microstructures reconstructed from serial sectioning approach. Interfacial debonding was modeled using user-defined cohesive zone elements. Modeling with the actual microstructure (versus idealized ellipsoids) has a significant influence on: (a) localized stresses and strains in particle and matrix, and (b) far-field strain at which localized debonding takes place. The <b>angular</b> <b>particles</b> exhibited higher degree of load transfer and are more sensitive to interfacial debonding. Larger decreases in stress are observed in the <b>angular</b> <b>particles,</b> because of the flat surfaces, normal to the loading axis, which bear load.

40|$|Naturally-occurring {{granular}} materials often {{consist of}} <b>angular</b> <b>particles</b> whose shape and frictional characteristics may {{have important implications}} on macroscopic flow rheology. In this paper, we provide a theoretical account for the peculiar phenomenon of auto-acoustic compaction [...] non-monotonic variation of shear band volume with shear rate in <b>angular</b> <b>particles</b> [...] recently observed in experiments. Our approach {{is based on the}} notion that the volume of a granular material is determined by an effective-disorder temperature known as the compactivity. Noise sources in a driven granular material couple its various degrees of freedom and the environment, causing the flow of entropy between them. The grain-scale dynamics is described by the shear-transformation-zone (STZ) theory of granular flow, which accounts for irreversible plastic deformation in terms of localized flow defects whose density is governed by the state of configurational disorder. To model the effects of grain shape and frictional characteristics, we propose an Ising-like internal variable to account for nearest-neighbor grain interlocking and geometric frustration, and interpret the effect of friction as an acoustic noise strength. We show quantitative agreement between experimental measurements and theoretical predictions, and propose additional experiments that provide stringent tests on the new theoretical elements.

However, the effect of particle shape on rockfill creep still remains poorly understood, which deserves a careful investigation. Particle-based discrete element method (DEM) was used to simulate the creep behavior of rockfills under different boundary conditions. Both angular and rounded particles were considered in this numerical study, in order to investigate the influence of particle shape. The preliminary results showed that <b>angular</b> <b>particles</b> experience more breakages and larger creep strains under one-dimensional compression than rounded particles.
