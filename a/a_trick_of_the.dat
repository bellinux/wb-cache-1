5|$|<b>A</b> <b>Trick</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tail had a {{positive}} reception from music critics, who were impressed that the group could not only survive the loss of Gabriel but still deliver a good album. The sound quality had improved from previous albums {{as a result of}} Hentschel's production skills. The album reached No. 3 in the UK, remaining on the charts for 39 weeks, and No. 31 in the U.S. It was certified Gold in the UK by the British Phonographic Industry in June and in the US by the RIAA in March 1990. The album remained in the UK charts for 39 weeks and recouped a significant amount of $400,000 worth of debt they had accumulated by the time Gabriel left.|$|E

He finds the Green Knight {{sharpening}} an axe and, as promised, Gawain bends his bared neck to receive his blow. At the first swing Gawain flinches slightly and the Green Knight belittles him for it. Ashamed of himself, Gawain doesn’t flinch {{with the second}} swing; but again the Green Knight withholds {{the full force of}} his blow. The knight explains he was testing Gawain's nerve. Angrily Gawain tells him to deliver his blow and so the knight does, causing only a slight wound on Gawain's neck. The game is over. Gawain seizes his sword, helmet and shield, but the Green Knight, laughing, reveals himself to be the lord of the castle, Bertilak de Hautdesert, transformed by magic. He explains that the entire adventure was <b>a</b> <b>trick</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 'elderly lady' Gawain saw at the castle, who is actually the sorceress Morgan le Fay, Arthur's sister, who intended to test Arthur's knights and frighten Guinevere to death. Gawain is ashamed to have behaved deceitfully but the Green Knight laughs and professes him the most blameless knight in all the land. The two part on cordial terms. Gawain returns to Camelot wearing the girdle as a token of his failure to keep his promise. The Knights of the Round Table absolve him of blame and decide that henceforth that they will wear a green sash in recognition of Gawain's adventure and as a reminder to be always honest.|$|E

500|$|<b>A</b> <b>Trick</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tail was {{released}} in February 1976 and was a commercial and critical success for the band. The album reached No. 3 in the UK and No. 31 in the US. The title track {{was released}} as a single, though it did not chart. In June, the album was certified Gold by the British Phonographic Institute for selling over 100,000 copies which helped the band clear the £400,000 of debt (equivalent to £ in [...] ). they owed when Gabriel left. For {{the first time in}} their career Genesis filmed promotional videos for their songs, including [...] "A Trick of the Tail" [...] and [...] "Robbery, Assault and Battery". Before the upcoming tour, Collins sought a drummer he felt comfortable about playing drums while he sang; he chose Bill Bruford who offered to do the job. From March to July 1976, Genesis performed across North America and Europe with the <b>A</b> <b>Trick</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tail tour, to enthusiastic crowds. Collins adopted a more humorous rapport with the audience, unlike Gabriel's theatrical approach, which was successful. The shows in Glasgow and Stafford were filmed for their concert film , released in cinemas in February 1977 as a double bill with White Rock.|$|E
500|$|Members of the {{original}} line-up were exposed to classical and church music as well as rock artists of the 1960s, particularly the Beatles. Gabriel's vocal style was influenced by Otis Redding and other Stax artists. In their early years, Genesis' music combined elements of the pop, folk, and psychedelic genres. Several songs developed during Phillips' time in the band originated on 12-string guitars, often with unconventional tunings. By the 1970s, the group began to include fantasy and surreal elements in their lyrics, such as [...] "The Musical Box". Nursery Cryme {{marks the first time}} electric instruments were used more extensively. <b>A</b> <b>Trick</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tail marked a return to the band's roots with acoustic passages and songs inspired by fantasy.|$|E
500|$|In May 1977 Genesis {{released}} Spot the Pigeon, {{an extended}} play of three tracks left off Wind & Wuthering. It peaked at No. 14 on the UK singles chart. It {{was the final}} Genesis release before Hackett left the group. He had been writing more material {{on his own and}} found it increasingly difficult to contribute more of his ideas within a group context. He wished to embark on a solo career and [...] "take the risk in order to find out just how good I was on my own". News of Hackett's departure coincided with the band's double live album Seconds Out, recorded in Paris on the <b>A</b> <b>Trick</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tail and Wind & Wuthering tours and released in October 1977. It reached No. 4 in the UK and No. 47 in the US.|$|E

50|$|B-M-X - Basically {{the same}} as the game mode 'H-O-R-S-E' in the Tony Hawk series. One player does <b>a</b> {{combination}} <b>of</b> <b>tricks,</b> and <b>the</b> other player has to gain more score than them. Whenever one player fails, they are assigned each successive letter of B-M-X, until one player has all the letters and the game finishes.|$|R
25|$|Alternative proofs exist – for example, Fermat {{computed}} {{the area}} via <b>an</b> algebraic <b>trick</b> <b>of</b> dividing <b>the</b> domain into certain intervals of unequal length; alternatively, one can prove this by recognizing a symmetry <b>of</b> <b>the</b> graph y=x'n under inhomogeneous dilation (by d in the x direction and d'n in the y direction, algebraicizing <b>the</b> n dimensions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> y direction), or deriving {{the formula for}} all integer values by expanding the result for n=1 and comparing coefficients.|$|R
500|$|Ward {{does not}} believe this <b>a</b> <b>trick</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eye {{resulting}} from loss of perspective towards the high reaches of the panel. Instead he {{sees it as a}} subtle reference to the iconography and mythology of the Book of Genesis' Tree of life, which he describes here as [...] "reborn in Christ's death". He does acknowledge the subtlety of the illusion, and the fact that neither of the two well known near copies include the motif. The idea of flowers shown as if sprouting {{from the top of the}} cross may have been borrowed from Masaccio's c.1426 Crucifixion, where flowers are placed on the upper portion of the vertical beam of the cross. Ward concludes than van Eyck took the idea even further by showing the flowers emanating from another source, and sought to depict the actual moment where the tree of life is reborn and [...] "the cross comes to life and sprouts flowers as one watches".|$|E
500|$|After an {{unsuccessful}} {{search for a}} replacement, Collins took over as lead singer, while the group gained popularity in the UK and the US. Following <b>A</b> <b>Trick</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tail and Wind & Wuthering (both 1976), Hackett left the band, reducing it to a core of Banks, Rutherford, and Collins. Genesis had their first UK top ten and US top 30 single in 1978 with [...] "Follow You Follow Me" [...] and the group continued to gain commercial success with Duke (1980), Abacab (1981), and Genesis (1983), reaching a peak with Invisible Touch (1986), which featured five US top five singles. Its title track reached No. 1 in the US. After the follow up, We Can't Dance (1991) and related tour, Collins left Genesis in 1996 to focus on his solo career. Banks and Rutherford recruited Ray Wilson for Calling All Stations (1997), but a lack of success in the US led to a group hiatus. Banks, Rutherford and Collins reunited for the [...] in 2007, and together with Gabriel and Hackett were interviewed for the BBC documentary [...] in 2014.|$|E
500|$|Following the Lamb tour, Hackett {{recorded}} his first solo album Voyage of the Acolyte {{as he felt}} unsure that Genesis would survive following Gabriel's departure. He reconvened with the remaining group members in London in July 1975. Collins' idea of continuing as an instrumental group was quickly rejected by the group as {{they thought it would}} become boring. Rehearsals for <b>A</b> <b>Trick</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tail took place in Acton where material was quickly written and with little effort; most of [...] "Dance on a Volcano" [...] and [...] "Squonk" [...] was put together in the first three days. Recording began in October 1975 at Trident Studios with Hentschel as producer. As a replacement singer had not been found, the band decided to record the album without vocals and audition singers as they went. They placed an anonymous advertisement in Melody Maker for [...] "a singer for a Genesis-type group" [...] which received around 400 replies. Collins proceeded to teach selected applicants the songs; Mick Strickland was invited into the studio to sing, but the backing tracks were in a key outside of his natural range and the band decided not to work with him. Having failed to find a suitable vocalist, Collins went in the studio and attempted to sing [...] "Squonk". His performance was well received by the band, and they decided that he should be their new lead vocalist. Collins then sang on the remaining tracks.|$|E

25|$|It is <b>an</b> old <b>trick</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Indian Office to blacken <b>the</b> {{character}} <b>of</b> any Indian that happens, {{notwithstanding the}} retardation {{caused by the}} Indian Bureau, to rise a little above the ranks. So as soon as an educated Indian begins to deplore <b>the</b> conditions <b>of</b> his brother Indians, the Indian Office dubs such a one a disturber, an agitator, and lately he {{is placed in the}} Bolshevik class. The whole Indian Bureau system of managing Indian business to <b>the</b> detriment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Indian but for <b>the</b> benefit <b>of</b> a few greedy and voracious whites, is the most dramatic autocracy in existence the world over.

500|$|In September 1976, Genesis {{relocated}} to Relight Studios in Hilvarenbeek, The Netherlands with Hentschel to record Wind & Wuthering. It {{was put together}} in {{a short amount of}} time and a considerable amount of material was written beforehand, of which the most suitable songs were picked for development. Rutherford spoke of the band's conscious effort to distance themselves from songs inspired by fantasy, something that their past albums [...] "were full of". The band spent roughly six weeks writing the album with a basic form of each track put down in twelve days. Additional recording and production work was done at Trident Studios that October. Hackett, having already released a solo album, enjoyed the greater amount of control over the recording process that working within a group could not provide. He felt his songs, including [...] "Please Don't Touch" [...] which he later released on his second album Please Don't Touch!, were rejected from the final track order in favour of material that Banks, in particular, had put forward. Collins spoke of the situation, [...] "We just wanted to use what we agreed was the strongest material, irrespective of who wrote it". Wind & Wuthering was released in December 1976 and reached No. 6 the UK and No. 26 in the US. Rutherford's track, [...] "Your Own Special Way", became its sole single and went to No. 43 in the UK. Its B-side is [...] "It's Yourself", originally intended for <b>A</b> <b>Trick</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tail.|$|E
2500|$|Hackett reconvened with Genesis in mid-1975 {{to write}} and rehearse for <b>A</b> <b>Trick</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tail (1976), their first with Collins on lead vocals after no other singer could be found. Hackett joined the writing {{sessions}} for the album late due to working on Voyage of the Acolyte, and was low on musical ideas but is credited on [...] "Dance on a Volcano", [...] "Entangled", and [...] "Los Endos". He began to feel frustrated over the group's more democratic approach to songwriting and selecting material for their albums.|$|E
2500|$|Elbow {{have cited}} {{a number of}} {{influences}} on their music, including Genesis (in particular the progressive rock years featuring Peter Gabriel and Steve Hackett), Talk Talk and Radiohead. Guy Garvey has said: [...] "I {{grew up listening to}} every Genesis record. I learned to write harmonies by listening to Peter Gabriel." [...] The song [...] "Newborn" [...] from Elbow's debut album was directly influenced by [...] "Entangled" [...] from the Genesis album <b>A</b> <b>Trick</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tail. Garvey has also said [...] "there'd be no Elbow without Radiohead". He credits the band's sense of dynamics to the influence of Talk Talk and has said: [...] "Volume dynamics are an essential part of classical music, but a lost art with guitar music. I think it's incredibly boring and shortsighted if a band sticks with just one sound song for song. An album should take people on a journey." ...|$|E
40|$|Let fA 1; A 2; : : :; Amg be {{a set of}} on-line {{algorithms}} for {{a problem}} P with input set I. We assume that P can be represented as a metrical task system. Each A i has a competitive ratio a i {{with respect to the}} optimum offline algorithm, but only for a subset <b>of</b> <b>the</b> possible inputs such that <b>the</b> union <b>of</b> these subsets covers I.

In this paper, we describe one simple but frequently occurring example of nonsymmetric Toeplitz matrices, where {{we are able to}} guarantee rapid convergence of an appropriate iterative method. The method employs <b>a</b> simple <b>trick</b> <b>of</b> reordering <b>the</b> variables to rewrite the system as a symmetric one. A symmetric positive definite absolute value preconditioner is also proposed which is used within a standard symmetric solver such as minres. We also show how this can be applied to time-dependent linear ODEs which are inherently nonsymmetric...|$|R
2500|$|Pleased {{with the}} {{feedback}} Burton received for {{his performance in}} <b>The</b> Last Days <b>of</b> Dolwyn, <b>the</b> film's co-producer Alexander Korda offered him a contract at a stipend of £100 a week, which he signed. The contract enabled Korda to lend Burton to films produced by other companies. Throughout the late 40s and early 50s, Burton acted in small parts in various British films such as Now Barabbas (1949) with Richard Greene and Kathleen Harrison, The Woman with No Name (1950) opposite Phyllis Calvert, Waterfront (1950) with Harrison; he had a bigger part as Robert Hammond, a spy for a newspaper editor in Green Grow the Rushes (1951) alongside Honor Blackman. His performance in Now Barabbas received positive feedback from critics. C. A. Lejeune <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Observer believed Burton had [...] "all <b>the</b> qualities <b>of</b> a leading man that the British film industry badly needs at this juncture: youth, good looks, a photogenic face, obviously alert intelligence and <b>a</b> <b>trick</b> <b>of</b> getting <b>the</b> maximum effort with <b>the</b> minimum <b>of</b> fuss". For <b>The</b> Woman With No Name, a critic from The New York Times thought Burton [...] "merely adequate" [...] in his role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Norwegian aviator, Nick Chamerd. Biographer Bragg states the reviews for Burton's performance in Waterfront were [...] "not bad", and that Green Grow the Rushes was a box office bomb.|$|R

50|$|A Fingerflip can be {{considered}} an umbrella term for <b>a</b> series <b>of</b> <b>tricks</b> involving <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>a</b> flick <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fingers to flip the skateboard. The rider rolls forward, grabs <b>the</b> nose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> board with the front hand and flips the board while simultaneously jumping up in the air. The rider will {{come down on the}} board or catch the board in mid-air. Many variations have been done including the Double Fingerflip, Varial Fingerflip, Backhand Fingerflips, and 360 Fingerflips. There are fakie versions <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> Fingerflips. Ollie Fingerflip variations are typically considered to be harder than regular fingerflip variations because the rider must Ollie first before initiating the Fingerflip.

40|$|We {{investigate}} <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> alternative divergences to Kullback-Leibler (KL) in variational inference(VI), {{based on}} the Variational Dropout kingma 2015. Stochastic gradient variational Bayes (SGVB) aevb is a general framework for estimating the evidence lower bound (ELBO) in Variational Bayes. In this work, we extend the SGVB estimator with using Alpha-Divergences, which are alternative to divergences to VI' KL objective. The Gaussian dropout {{can be seen as}} <b>a</b> local reparametrization <b>trick</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SGVB objective.

40|$|Direct {{sampling}} of multi-dimensional systems with quantum Monte Carlo methods allows exact account of many-body effects or particle correlations. The most straightforward approach {{to solve the}} Schrödinger equation, Diffusion Monte Carlo, {{has been used in}} several benchmark cases for other methods to pursue. Its robustness is based on direct {{sampling of}} a positive probability density for diffusion in imaginary time. It has been argued that the corresponding real time diffusion can not be realised, because the corresponding oscillating complex valued distribution {{can not be used to}} drive diffusion. Here, we demonstrate that this can be done with <b>a</b> couple <b>of</b> <b>tricks</b> turning <b>the</b> distribution piecewise positive and normalisable.
