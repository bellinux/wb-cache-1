60|$|Then {{he looked}} up <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>again,</b> and swore one of his great oaths.|$|E
60|$|Ariel looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>again,</b> in {{the double}} {{intoxication}} of the wine and the triumph.|$|E
60|$|She half {{closed her}} eyes for a moment. When she looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>again</b> she was laughing.|$|E
60|$|She looked <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> smiling <b>again</b> {{through her}} tears, {{and shook her}} head a little.|$|R
6000|$|The {{man looked}} <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> looked <b>again,</b> then, startled {{out of his}} Dutch stolidity, cried to his wife, who was seated on the box of the waggon-- ...|$|R
60|$|It {{seemed that}} we had {{suddenly}} reassumed our natural dimensions, for at that he looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> tinily <b>again,</b> and with the suggestion, to which I was long accustomed, that he would rather not be observed while so looking.|$|R
60|$|Joe {{looked at}} her in a {{helpless}} way, then took a helpless bite, and looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
60|$|He {{gripped his}} knees {{and turned to look}} <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>again.</b> For half a minute, perhaps, he stared silently.|$|E
6000|$|... "Compeyson laughed, looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>again</b> very noticing, giv me five shillings, and {{appointed}} me for next night. Same place.|$|E
60|$|Beatrice Haldane looked <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> and <b>again</b> I {{felt that}} she could still draw my soul to the surface for {{inspection}} if she desired to. I also fancied she knew her power, and wished to exercise it, but not from pride in its possession.|$|R
60|$|There was a pause. I drew {{myself up}} to my full height; then, seeing that he wasn't looking <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> lowered myself <b>again.</b>|$|R
60|$|I am {{sure that}} my voice was not very steady, for I cannot help liking him And then his face lighted up {{and he gave me}} his hand. And he smiled <b>at</b> <b>me</b> and <b>again</b> <b>at</b> the General, as much as {{to say that it was}} all over. He has a {{wonderful}} smile.|$|R
60|$|She looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>again</b> {{and this}} time a new light shone in her eyes which I could not misinterpret.|$|E
6000|$|The {{landlord}} looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>again,</b> and then, {{with his}} former appearance of desperation, called down his stable-yard for [...] "Ikey!" ...|$|E
60|$|As I led {{him along}} the {{passage to the}} library Josephine passed us. Mr. Dark winked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>again,</b> and made her a low bow.|$|E
6000|$|He changed color--looked up <b>at</b> <b>me</b> quickly--looked down <b>again</b> <b>at</b> his book--struggled {{hard with}} some secret fear or secret {{reluctance}} {{that was in}} him--and suddenly burst out with this extraordinary question: [...] "I suppose you were in earnest when you preached that sermon in London?" ...|$|R
60|$|She fanned {{herself a}} moment, and then {{repeated}} the lines correctly, in a soft, flat, and yet agreeable voice. By {{the time she}} had finished she was blushing. I complimented her and told her she was perfectly equipped for visiting Switzerland and Italy. She looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> askance <b>again,</b> to see whether I was serious, and I added, that if she wished to recognize Byron's descriptions she must go abroad speedily; Europe was getting sadly dis-Byronized.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Bundercombe smiled. It was {{a curious}} smile, which seemed somehow to lose itself in his face. Then the dinner gong sounded and he winked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> slowly. <b>Again</b> I was {{conscious}} of some slight uneasiness. It began to dawn upon {{me that there was}} a scheme somewhere hatching; that Mr. Bundercombe's activity in the camp of the enemy might perhaps have an unsuspected significance. I talked to Eve about this after dinner; but she reassured me.|$|R
6000|$|... "And are {{you really}} going?" [...] said {{the man with the}} shade, looking <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>again</b> for the third time, with that queer, unnatural tilting of the face.|$|E
60|$|He let fly at them a {{volley of}} blood-curdling oaths, then, without {{waiting to see}} if they obeyed him, he came <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>again,</b> and our swords met.|$|E
60|$|She gave {{a slight}} start and without looking <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>again</b> glided {{out of the}} room, the many folds of her brown skirt {{remaining}} undisturbed as she moved.|$|E
60|$|On the {{outskirts}} of the crowd I met Susan, who was almost overpowered with joy <b>at</b> seeing <b>me</b> safe <b>again.</b> I shook her by the hand, but, without replying to her warm-hearted protestations of thankfulness and delight, I asked her if she had seen Miss Havelot.|$|R
60|$|He {{was lying}} almost at full length in the chair, {{his eyes fixed}} in dreamy {{abstraction}} upon the ceiling. As I came towards him, he drew at the cigarette between his fingers, glanced <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> looked away <b>again,</b> and expelled another mouthful of smoke. He {{was not interested in}} me.|$|R
6000|$|She looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> a while <b>again,</b> {{and then}} she said, in a little {{reasoning}} voice {{that reminded me of}} her mother's, only that it was conscious and studied, [...] "I was not aware that I am under any particular obligation to please you!" [...] And then she gave a clear laugh, quite at variance with her voice.|$|R
60|$|He said no more, {{and walked}} up and down the room with an air of annoyance. The bell of the street-door rang. He stopped and looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
60|$|She knit her brows, {{her eyes}} upon the ground; then slowly she raised them, and looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>again,</b> the same unusual {{seriousness}} and alertness in every line of her face.|$|E
6000|$|... "No more of Me!" [...] she said, {{suddenly}} recovering her composure, {{and suddenly}} forcing herself to look <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>again.</b> [...] "Tell me what happy chance {{brought you here}} last night?" ...|$|E
60|$|She looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> a while <b>again,</b> {{and then}} she said in a little {{reasoning}} tone that reminded me of her mother’s, only that it was conscious and studied, “I wasn’t aware that I’m under any particular obligation to please you!” But she also gave a clear laugh, quite at variance with this stiffness. Suddenly I thought her adorable.|$|R
6000|$|... "`Was it, though?' {{he inquired}} earnestly, with an upward glance, that gave to his countenance in that {{position}} a hideous aspect. `Sure it had need be, for the worst baits all that iver I drained of. Go <b>at</b> it <b>again,</b> <b>me</b> boy.' ...|$|R
60|$|I let {{him take}} me to a {{restaurant}} of his choice, but on the way I bought a paper. When we had ordered our dinner, I propped it against a bottle of St. Galmier and began to read. We ate in silence. I felt him looking <b>at</b> <b>me</b> now and <b>again,</b> but I took no notice. I meant {{to force him to}} conversation.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah! {{you laugh}} <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>again!</b> Now tell me, Mr. Coningsby, {{what do you}} think we shall do to-night? I look upon you, you know, as the real arbiter of our destinies.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Jacko {{looked again}} at the pear and put one finger towards it with great caution, but drew back and looked up <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>again,</b> as if to say, [...] "Won't you help me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, bless you!' said Peggotty, looking <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>again</b> at last. 'Don't you know? She's {{going to}} stay for a {{fortnight}} with Mrs. Grayper. Mrs. Grayper's {{going to have a lot}} of company.' ...|$|E
60|$|We reached Satanstoe {{a little}} late, in {{consequence}} of the delay at Lilacsbush, and were welcomed with affection and warmth. My excellent mother was delighted to see <b>me</b> <b>at</b> home <b>again,</b> after so long an absence, and one which {{she did not think}} altogether without peril, when it was remembered that I had passed a whole fortnight amid the temptations and fascinations of the capital. I saw the tears in her eyes as she kissed <b>me,</b> <b>again</b> and again, and felt the gentle, warm embrace, as she pressed me to her bosom, in maternal thanksgiving.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thunder and fury," [...] {{cried the}} General, [...] "a man might {{think you were}} a weak-kneed Federalist." [...] He stared <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> and stared <b>again,</b> and rose and recoiled a step. [...] "My God," [...] he said, [...] "you cannot be a Federalist, you can't have marched to Kaskaskia and Vincennes, you can't have been {{a friend of mine}} and have seen how the {{government}} of the United States has treated me, and be a Federalist!" ...|$|R
60|$|Then I fell back, {{the holy}} {{image of the}} goddess passed and the {{procession}} vanished through the pylon gate. I, Shabaka the Egyptian, stood by my horse and watched it depart. I was happy because the lady Amada was alive, well, and more beautiful than ever; also because she had shown signs of joy and confusion <b>at</b> seeing <b>me</b> <b>again.</b> Yet I was unhappy because I met her still filling a holy office which built a wall between us, also because {{it seemed to me}} an evil omen that I should have been repelled from her by a priest of Isis who talked of the curse of the goddess. Moreover the sacred statue, I suppose by accident, turned towards me as it passed and perhaps by the chance of light, seemed to frown upon me.|$|R
