40|$|For {{persistent}} infections of the mammalian host, African trypanosomes {{limit their}} population size by quorum sensing of the parasite-excreted stumpy induction factor (SIF), which induces development to the tsetse-infective stumpy stage.

The expression of a second variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) leads to transcriptional attenuation of the VSG expression site (ES) and immediate development to tsetse fly infective stumpy parasites. This path is independent of SIF and solely controlled by the transcriptional status of the ES. In pleomorphic trypanosomes varying degrees of ES-attenuation result in phenotypic plasticity.

Enteric neurons would then lose the catecholamine phenotype during further development, as the two lineages diverge. We have further investigated this possibility using the SA 1 monoclonal antibody that binds selectively to SA progenitor cells in the embryonic rat. We find that SA 1 binds to the tyrosine hydroxylase^+, neurofilament^+, and SCG 10 ^+ cells of the Embryonic Day 14. 5 (E 14. 5) rat foregut.

Studies of different pathogens have suggested that switching between variant genes is non-random and that genes have intrinsic probabilities of being activated or silenced. These factors could create a hierarchy of gene expression with important implications for both infection dynamics and the acquisition of protective immunity. Inferring complete switching networks from gene transcription data is problematic, however, because of the high dimensionality of the system and uncertainty in the data.

Here we mathematically test hypotheses concerning the blood-based parasitemia. In our model the <b>antigenic</b> <b>switches</b> occur at random at the DNA level. A variable proportion of the switches has a short intermediate phase in which two different VSGs simultaneously occur on the cell surface.

Rather, a realistic parasitemia can be obtained if the majority of switches has a double expressor switch-intermediate phase and if the double expressors have a differential susceptibility to the immune control. This study is significant in providing a theoretical basis for the ordered appearance of variants and in explaining previously unresolved discrepancies between the rate of appearance of new variants in culture and in vivo.

Likewise, the analysis of culture medium indicates exclusive in vivo release of surface antigens by two phospholipase C isoforms (PLC 2 and PLC 6). This suggests that phospholipase C shows affinity for select groups of GPI-anchored proteins. Our data also reveal an up-regulation of PLC isoforms in GPI-anchored protein cleavage during <b>antigenic</b> <b>switching.</b> As a consequence, silencing of these PLCs leads to a drastic decrease of antigen concentration in the medium.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the genes coding for the variant-specific surface antigen (VSA) {{in a series of}} seven {{trypanosome}} clones derived from AnTat 1. 1 : 1. 1 leads to 1. 3 leads to 1. 6 leads to 1. 16 leads to 1. 1 C leads to 1. 3 B leads to 1. 18 These genes are all telomeric (1 - 5), and their surrounding, although sometimes similar, differs in each case. The length between these antigen genes and the corresponding DNA end appears to increase at each <b>antigenic</b> <b>switch,</b> with however occasional sharp size reductions, often linked to the involvement of the telomere in gene expression. This increase is due to a constant "growth" of the telomeres, {{at a rate of about}} 28 bp per day in at least four cases and probably linked to chromosome duplication. The telomere harbouring the transcribed VSA gene is growing slightly faster (about 36 bp per day), and it is the only one whose size reduction is progressive, leading to a terminal length heterogeneity within a clone. As a result, the active VSA gene is found in a population of telomeres which, as the trypanosomes divide, becomes increasingly heterogeneous, with however a preferred discrete size class about 1. 4 kb smaller. The fact that the "active" telomere is the only one in a chromatin conformation highly sensitive to DNAaseI (1 - 4, 6), suggests that chromatin structure influences the rate and extent of both size increase and shortening of telomeres.

40|$|Contagious bovine {{pleuropneumonia}} is {{a severe}} respiratory disease of cattle that {{is caused by}} a bacterium of the Mycoplasma genus, namely Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides (Mmm). In the absence of classical virulence determinants, the pathogenicity of Mmm is thought to rely on intrinsic metabolic functions and specific components of the outer cell surface. One of these latter, the capsular polysaccharide galactan has been notably demonstrated {{to play a role in}} Mmm persistence and dissemination. The free exopolysaccharides (EPS), also produced by Mmm and shown to circulate in the blood stream of infected cattle, have received little attention so far. Indeed, their characterization has been hindered by the presence of polysaccharide contaminants in the complex mycoplasma culture medium. In this study, we developed a method to produce large quantities of EPS by transfer of mycoplasma cells from their complex broth to a chemically defined medium and subsequent purification. NMR analyses revealed that the purified, free EPS had an identical b(12. 6) - galactofuranosyl structure to that of capsular galactan. We then analyzed intraclonal Mmm variants that produce opaque/ translucent colonies on agar. First, we demonstrated that colony opacity was related to the production of a capsule, as observed by electron microscopy. We then compared the EPS extracts and showed that the non-capsulated, translucent colony variants produced higher amounts of free EPS than the capsulated, opaque colony variants. This phenotypic variation was associated with an antigenic variation of a specific glucose phosphotransferase permease. Finally, we conducted in silico analyses of candidate polysaccharide biosynthetic pathways in order to decipher the potential link between glucose phosphotransferase permease activity and attachment/release of galactan. The co-existence of variants producing alternative forms of galactan (capsular versus free extracellular galactan) and associated with an <b>antigenic</b> <b>switch</b> constitutes a finely tuned mechanism that may be involved in virulence.

40|$|A {{variety of}} parasites persist in their host through {{sequential}} expression of variant surface antigens. Intriguingly, the genes encoding these antigens are frequently found {{adjacent to the}} telomeres. Telomeres are nucleoprotein complexes consisting of tandem DNA repeats and proteins that bind to them. Their function is to protect chromosome ends from the DNA repair machinery that would otherwise recognize them as double-stranded breaks. With {{the help of the}} ribonucleoprotein telomerase they compensate for the gradual sequence loss that would otherwise arise from the inability of conventional DNA polymerases to replicate chromosome ends. In Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of African trypanosomiasis, the surface coat consists of a dense layer of Variant Surface Glycoproteins (VSG). The actively transcribed VSG is found in one of ~ 20 telomeric Expression Sites (ES). Antigenic variation can occur by transcriptional switching, reciprocal translocations, or duplicative gene conversion events between ES. In recent African isolates, duplicative gene conversion occurs at a high frequency and predominates, but the switching frequency decreases dramatically upon laboratory-adaptation. Very {{little is known about the}} regulation of antigenic variation. To address whether telomeres are involved in <b>antigenic</b> <b>switching</b> we created telomerasedeficient T. brucei. Telomerase-deficient parasites exhibited progressive telomere shortening at a rate of 3 â€“ 6 bp/PD, which correlates with the end replication problem and G-overhang length. Upon reaching a critical length, short silent ES telomeres stabilized. Telomere decline was accompanied by loss of minichromosomes and rearrangements at intermediate chromosomes. Essential megabase chromosomes remained stable. After extensive telomere attrition, the active ES telomere stabilized, but the transcribed VSG was gradually lost from the population and replaced by a new VSG through duplicative gene conversion. We present a model in which subtelomeric break-induced replication-mediated repair at a short ES telomere leads to duplicative gene conversion and expression of a new VSG. By restoring telomerase, we studied telomere elongation dynamics. At the active ES, the rate of telomere elongation is inversely proportional to the initial telomere length. At silent ES, the rate of elongation remains constant. We propose a model where transcription-dependent chromatin remodeling permits telomere elongation by telomerase. We show that telomere growth at a rate of 6 â€“ 8 bp/PD appears to be a unique feature of T. brucei. Lastly we demonstrate that fast-switching African T. brucei isolates have dramatically shorter telomeres than laboratory strains. We present a speculative model in which telomere growth and breakage affect the rate of <b>antigenic</b> <b>switching...</b>|$|E

Analysis of the complete nucleotide sequences of 23 EtSAG genes separated them into two multi-gene families. All the predicted EtSAG proteins (which vary in length from 228 to 271 residues) have an N-terminal hydrophobic signal peptide, a C-terminal hydrophobic GPI signal-anchor peptide and an extracellular domain organised around six cysteine residues, the positions of which are conserved within each family.

40|$|Antigenic {{variation}} is an immune evasion strategy used by African trypanosomes, {{in which the}} parasites periodically switch the expression of VSG genes that encode their protective variant surface glycoprotein coat.

40|$|At any time, {{each cell}} of the {{protozoan}} parasite Trypanosoma brucei expresses {{a single species}} of its major antigenic protein, the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG), from a repertoire of > 2, 000 VSG genes and pseudogenes. The potential to express different VSGs by transcription and recombination allows the parasite to escape the antibody-mediated host immune response, a mechanism known as antigenic variation. The active VSG is transcribed from a sub-telomeric polycistronic unit called the expression site (ES), whose promoter is 40 - 60 kb upstream of the VSG. While the mechanisms that initiate recombination remain unclear, the resolution phase of these reactions results in the recombinational replacement of the expressed VSG with a donor from one of three distinct chromosomal locations; sub-telomeric loci on the 11 essential chromosomes, on minichromosomes, or at telomere-distal loci. Depending {{on the type of}} recombinational replacement (single or double crossover, duplicative gene conversion, etc), several DNA-repair pathways have been thought to play a role. Here we show that VSG recombination relies on at least two distinct DNA-repair pathways, one of which requires RMI 1 -TOPO 3 α to suppress recombination and one that is dependent on RAD 51 and RMI 1.

40|$|Homologous {{recombination}} (HR) mediates one of {{the major}} mechanisms of trypanosome antigenic variation by placing a different variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) gene {{under the control of the}} active expression site (ES). It is believed that the majority of VSG switching events occur by duplicative gene conversion, but only a few DNA repair genes that are central to HR have been assigned a role in this process. Gene conversion events that are associated with crossover are rarely seen in VSG switching, similar to mitotic HR. In other organisms, TOPO 3 a (Top 3 in yeasts), a type IA topoisomerase, is part of a complex that is involved in the suppression of crossovers. We therefore asked whether a related mechanism might suppress VSG recombination. Using a set of reliable recombination and switching assays that could score individual switching mechanisms, we discovered that TOPO 3 a function is conserved in Trypanosoma brucei and that TOPO 3 a plays a critical role in <b>antigenic</b> <b>switching.</b> Switching frequency increased 10 – 40 -fold in the absence of TOPO 3 a and this hyper-switching phenotype required RAD 51.

However, {{little is known about}} the subtelomeric DSBs that naturally trigger antigenic {{variation in}} Trypanosoma brucei, the subsequent DNA damage responses, or how these responses determine the mechanism of VSG switching. We found that DSBs naturally accumulate close to both transcribed and non-transcribed telomeres. We then induced high-efficiency meganuclease-mediated DSBs and monitored DSB-responses and DSB-survivors. By inducing breaks at distinct sites within both transcribed and silent VSG transcription units and assessing local DNA resection, histone modification, G 2 /M-checkpoint activation, and both RAD 51 -dependent and independent repair, we reveal how breaks at different sites trigger distinct responses and, in 'active-site' survivors, different switching mechanisms. At the active site, we find that promoter-adjacent breaks typically failed to trigger switching, 70 bp-repeat-adjacent breaks almost always triggered switching through 70 bp-repeat recombination (∼ 60 % RAD 51 -dependent), and telomere-repeat-adjacent breaks triggered switching through loss of the VSG expression site (25 % of survivors). Expression site loss was associated with G 2 /M-checkpoint bypass, while 70 bp-repeat-recombination was associated with DNA-resection, γH 2 A-focus assembly and a G 2 /M-checkpoint. Thus, the probability and mechanism of <b>antigenic</b> <b>switching</b> are highly dependent upon the location of the break. We conclude that 70 bp-repeat-adjacent and telomere-repeat-adjacent breaks trigger distinct checkpoint responses and VSG switching pathways. Our results show how subtelomere fragility can generate the triggers for the major antigenic variation mechanisms in the African trypanosome...|$|E
40|$|Survival of Trypanosoma brucei {{depends upon}} {{switches}} in its protective Variant Surface Glycoprotein (VSG) coat by <b>antigenic</b> variation. VSG <b>switching</b> occurs by frequent homologous recombination, which {{is thought to}} require locus-specific initiation. Here, we show that a RecQ helicase, RECQ 2, acts to repair DNA breaks, including in the telomeric site of VSG expression. Despite this, RECQ 2 loss does not impair antigenic variation, but causes increased VSG switching by recombination, arguing against models for VSG switch initiation through direct generation of a DNA double strand break (DSB). Indeed, we show DSBs inefficiently direct recombination in the VSG expression site. By mapping genome replication dynamics, we reveal that the transcribed VSG expression site is the only telomeric site that is early replicating – a differential timing only seen in mammal-infective parasites. Specific association between VSG transcription and replication timing reveals a model for antigenic variation based on replication-derived DNA fragility...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of the micrococcal vaccine on the proliferation of normal immunocompetent and neoplastic plasma (MOPC 173) and of carcinoma (Ehrlich ascites) cells is studied. BALB c mice and CDF 1 mice, hypervaccinated with Micrococcus Lysodeikticus, developed significantly (0. 001 < P < 0. 005) lower primary immune responses against sheep erythrocytes and also displayed impaired secondary immune responses. Administration of Bacillus Calmette-Guérin could partially restore the immunologic potential of vaccinated mice {{as measured by the}} capability of mice to answer with primary or secondary immune responses to sheep erythrocytes but did not increase immunoresponsiveness of normal mice sensitized at nearly optimal <b>antigenic</b> dose. <b>Switching</b> on a secondary antimicrococcus immune response after grafting 200, 000 Ehrlich carcinoma cells in the peritoneum of BALB c mice resulted in a 30 % increase in mean life span over control mice. However, mice hyperimmunized for months with Micrococcus lysodeikticus were offered the strongest immunoprotection and we found 67 % of mice surviving to day 90 whereas the other vaccinated but tumour bearing animals showed a 29 % increase in life span over control mice. Similarly, we demonstrated that 44 % of BALB c mice, hyperimmunized for months, were able to reject a tumour challenge of 200, 000 grafted MOPC 173 plasmacytoma cells, whereas the other micrococcus vaccinated but tumour bearing animals died with a 26 % increase in mean survival time over control mice. © 1978.

Here we use sequential cloning of P. falciparum by micromanipulation to investigate the ability of a parasite to <b>switch</b> <b>antigenic</b> and cytoadherence phenotypes. Our data show that antigens at the parasitized cell surface undergo clonal variation in vitro in the absence of immune pressure at the rate of 2 % per generation with concomitant modulations of the adhesive phenotype. A clone has the potential to switch at high frequency to a variety of antigenic and adhesive phenotypes, including a new type of cytoadherence behaviour, 'auto-agglutination' of infected erythrocytes.

40|$|Transmission of the {{protozoan}} parasite Giardia lamblia {{from one}} to another host individuum occurs through peroral ingestion of cysts which, following excystation in the small intestine, release two trophozoites each. Many studies have focused on the major surface antigen, VSP (for variant surface protein), which is responsible for the antigenic variability of the parasite. By using trophozoites of G. lamblia clone GS/M- 83 -H 7 (expressing VSP H 7) and the neonatal mouse model for experimental infections, we quantitatively assessed the process of antigenic variation of the parasite on the transcriptional level. In the present study, variant-specific regions identified on different GS/M- 83 -H 7 vsp sequences served as targets for quantitative reverse transcription-PCR to monitor alterations in vsp mRNA levels during infection. Respective results demonstrated that <b>antigenic</b> <b>switching</b> of both the duodenal trophozoite and the cecal cyst populations was associated with a massive reduction in vsp H 7 mRNA levels but not with a simultaneous increase in transcripts of any of the subvariant vsp genes analyzed. Most importantly, we also explored giardial variant-type formation and vsp mRNA levels after infection of mice with cysts. This infection mode led to an antigenic reset of the parasite in that a VSP H 7 -negative inoculum "converted" into a population of intestinal trophozoites that essentially consisted of the original VSP H 7 type. This antigenic reset appears to be associated with excystation rather than with a selective process which favors expansion of a residual population of VSP H 7 types within the antigenically diversified cyst inoculum. Based on these findings, the VSP H 7 type has to be regarded as a predominant variant of G. lamblia clone GS/M- 83 -H 7 which (re-) emerges during early-stage infection and may contribute to an optimal establishment of the parasite within the intestine of the experimental murine host...|$|E
40|$|Giardia lamblia, a {{protozoan}} parasite of {{the small}} intestine of humans and other animals, undergoes surface antigenic variation. The antigens involved belong to a family of variant-specific surface proteins (VSPs), which are unique, cysteine-rich zinc finger proteins. The patterns of infection in humans and animals fail to show the expected cyclical waves of increasing and decreasing numbers of parasites expressing unique VSPs. Nevertheless, changes in VSP expression occur within the population in vivo owing to selection of VSPs by both immune and non-immune mechanisms. After inoculation of a single G. lamblia clone (able to persist {{in the absence of}} immune pressure) expressing one VSP (> or = 90 %) into mice or humans, the original VSP continues to be expressed until 2 weeks post inoculation (p. i.), when many other VSPs gradually replace it. Selection by immune-mediated processes is suggested because switching occurs {{at the same time that}} humoral responses are first detected. In most mouse strains, switching also occurs at about two weeks. Almost all trophozoites are eliminated at three weeks (p. i.), but a barely detectable infection persists over months. In neonatal mice, apparent self-cure is delayed until the sixth or seventh week. <b>Antigenic</b> <b>switching</b> does not occur in adult or neonatal severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID) mice, but does occur in neonatal nude mice, thus implicating B-cell-mediated mechanisms in immune switching. Not all VSPs are expressed to the same degree in vivo. Some VSPs appear to be preferentially selected whereas others are eliminated on a non-immune basis. In infections in which immunity does not play a role, such as in SCID mice, and during the first week of infection in immunocompetent mice or gerbils, persisting VSPs are preferentially expressed and maintained whereas non-persisting VSPs are replaced within the first week of infection. The purpose of antigenic variation may be presentation of a wide assortment of VSPs to hosts, increasing the chance of a successful initial infection or reinfection. Immune selection of variants comes into play following biological selection...|$|E
40|$|Kinetoplastid protozoans have unusual cell cycles. Three unitary organelles {{need to be}} {{replicated}} and segregated to the daughter cells at each cell division; the nucleus, kinetoplast and basal body, associated with the flagellum The replication and segregation of these organelles requires to be co-ordinated. Inthis study the timing of nuclear and kinetoplast cell cycle events was examined in two species of kinetoplastids, Trypanosoma brucei and Leishmania mexicana, which are major pathogens of humans, to ascertain the degree of co-ordination between the two organelles in the cell cycle. Particular {{attention was paid to}} three main features; the duration of S-phase for each organelle, the relative timing of mitosis and kinetoplast division and the lengths of the post-mitotic/division cytokinesis periods. Two life cycle stages were examined for each species i. e. procyclic and bloodstream forms of T. brucei and promastigote and amastigote forms of L. mexicana. The objectives of this study were to establish firstly whether a similar pattern of events occurs for both stages within each species examined and secondly, whether or not T. brucei and L. mexicana share common features to their cell cycles. Studies of cell cycle events were conducted using immunofluorescent labelling to detect S-phase in both organelles, enabled by use of an anti-bromo-deoxyuridine (BrdU) antibody as an S-phase marker. Division of organelles was identified by staining the cells with DAPI, a DNA intercalating dye. Initial studies confirmed that the cell cycles of both species were consistent with the general pattern of events of the eukaryotic nuclear cycle. Also, as has been described previously in kinetoplastids, the kinetoplast DNA (containing mitochondrial DNA) has a pattern of discretely separated phases of replication and division analagous to the nuclear cycle. Analysis was made of the relative timing of S-phase, mitosis/division and cytokinesis for each life cycle stage, producing data which were statistically testable. For both life cycle stages of T. brucei a similar pattern of events was observed. Three populations of BrdU labelled cells were identified; cells which were BrdU labelled in the nucleus only, labelled in the kinetoplast only and labelled for both organelles. These observations indicate that there was a non-co-ordinate start and finish to S-phase, with an overlap in the timing of the S-phase periods. Kinetoplast division was initiated and completed before the start of mitosis in the nucleus and an extended cytokinesis period for each organelle was identified, although of longer duration in the kinetoplast. For both life cycle stages of L. mexicana, three populations of cells labelled with BrdU were observed as in T. brucei, again indicating that there was a non-co-ordinate start and finish to S-phase, with an overlap in the timing of both periods. The sequence of division for the organelles for both life cycle stages differed to that observed in T brucei. The nucleus divided before the kinetoplast and there was a much shorter cytokinesis period for both organelles in comparison to T brucei. These differences in the pattern of events may reflect either a difference in the control of cell cycle timing in each species or in the morphology of each cell type. Trypanosomes have to re-arrange their organelles, such that they occupy sites {{on either side of the}} division furrow, hence the extended cytokinesis phase. In L. mexicana, however, this requirement for organelle re-positioning is reduced or absent and therefore the cytokinesis periods are much shorter. Antigenic variation is the key strategy which allows African trypanosomes to evade the effects of the host's immune response. The switching from expression of one variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) to that of another has been indirectly linked to the cell cycle, as bloodstream slender forms divide and undergo <b>antigenic</b> <b>switching,</b> whereas bloodstream stumpy forms are non-dividing and do not appear to switch. An attempt to examine directly the proposed link between <b>antigenic</b> <b>switching</b> and the cell cycle was made using cell cycle markers (anti-BrdU antibody as an S-phase marker and DAPI staining to determine the configurations of the organelles), as well as VAT specific antibodies against VSGs expressed in the cloned lines studied. Unfortunately, trypanosomes expressing two VSG coats simultaneously and therefore undergoing antigenic switch, could not be detected in any of the cloned lines examined. This unresolved difficulty was attributed to a deficiency in the detection system employed. Differentiation in kinetoplastids is thought to be linked to the cell cycle, as progression through the life cycle involves transitions from proliferative to nonproliferative forms. The differentiation of Leishmania major promastigote forms, from dividing non-infective stages to non-dividing infective meta cyclic forms, involves major molecular and morphological changes. Using three metacyclic-specific markers (non-agglutination by peanut agglutinin, a monoclonal antibody (3 F 12) against metacyclic-specific epitopes of the major surface molecule lipophosphoglycan (LPG) and a rabbit anti-serum (ab 336) against a metacyclic-specific surface protein, the Gene B protein) metacyclic production in in vitro culture was examined. Observation of population growth CUIVes suggests that differentiation is in part intrinsically programmed within the parasite but may also be inducible by environmental changes. Comparison of these data with mathematical models indicated that the promastigote population was likely to be heterogeneous, containing sub-populations that replicate and differentiate at different rates. Two major assumptions of the heterogeneous model are that meta cyclic forms are both non-dividing and incapable of dedifferentiation. These two possibilities were tested experimentally and indicated that meta cyclic forms are indeed non-dividing, but are also capable of de-differentiation, albeit at a very low rate. Examination of meta cyclic production at the cellular level also indicated that the event which causes commitment to differentiation occurs at least one cell division before symmetrical production of two daughter meta cyclic forms. It has been found that in the presence of a chronic infection the growth of a secondary infection is significantly inhibited (Turner et al., 1996). The available data suggests that there appears to be an overall down-regulation in the growth of the entire mixed population. The aim of this component of the project was to select for 'growth' mutant trypanosomes i. e. mutants which overcome growth inhibition. Bloodstream trypanosomes which had been mutagenised in vitro with ethyl methane sulphonate (EMS) were inoculated into mice in the presence of a pre-existing chronic infection. Populations of mutagenised trypanosomes which grew significantly in comparison to controls where only low rates of growth occurred, were selected by optical cloning. This rationale led to the generation of growth mutant clones which stably expressed the altered growth phenotype. These studies may permit the development of methods for the investigation of the regulation of growth and virulence in these parasites. In conclusion, the analysis of the relative timing of cell cycle events in T. brucei and L. mexicana has highlighted both common and novel features to the cell cycles of these kinetoplastids. The study of meta cyclic production in L. major has also revealed the intrinsic and extrinsic nature of regulation of differentiation in these parasites, as well as the commitment to differentiate at the cellular level. Furthermore, the generation of 'growth' mutant trypanosomes provides an additional tool for the future study of growth regulation in trypanosome infections...|$|E
5|$|Isotype {{or class}} {{switching}} is a biological process occurring after {{activation of the}} B cell, which allows the cell to produce different classes of antibody (IgA, IgE, or IgG). The different classes of antibody, and thus effector functions, are defined by the constant (C) regions of the immunoglobulin heavy chain.

Each isotype is adapted for a distinct function; therefore, after activation, an antibody with an IgG, IgA, or IgE effector function might be required to effectively eliminate an antigen. Class switching allows different daughter cells from the same activated B cell to produce antibodies of different isotypes.

40|$|Mycoplasma agalactiae, an {{important}} pathogen of small ruminants, exhibits <b>antigenic</b> diversity by <b>switching</b> {{the expression of}} multiple surface lipoproteins called Vpmas (Variable proteins of M. agalactiae). Although phase variation {{has been shown to}} play important roles in many host–pathogen interactions, the biological significance and the mechanism of Vpma oscillations remain largely unclear. Here, we demonstrate that all six Vpma proteins are expressed in the type strain PG 2 and all undergo phase variation at an unusually high frequency. Furthermore, targeted gene disruption of the xer 1 gene encoding a putative site-specific recombinase adjacent to the vpma locus was accomplished via homologous recombination using a replicon-based vector. Inactivation of xer 1 abolished further Vpma switching and the ‘phase-locked’ mutants (PLMs) continued to steadily express only a single Vpma product. Complementation of the wild-type xer 1 gene in PLMs restored Vpma phase variation thereby proving that Xer 1 is essential for vpma inversions. The study is not only instrumental in enhancing our ability to understand the role of Vpmas in M. agalactiae infections but also provides useful molecular approaches to study potential disease factors in other ‘difficult-to-manipulate’ mycoplasmas...|$|R
