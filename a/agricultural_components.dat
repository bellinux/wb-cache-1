The presence of these services makes the agricultural workers the highest in number. The agricultural productivity of Roxas is high, reaching as much as 95 percent cultivation rates in rice and corn. Surplus production of rice and corn are being exported to other places. Other crops are vegetables, tobacco and root crops in which production is just sufficient for local consumption. Likewise, the production of meat including pork and poultry is just sufficient but the supply of fish of other kinds aside from the harvest of inland fishpond owners within the locality {{is dependent on the}} arrival of supply coming from other places.In the area, rice is the predominant crop, planted twice a year. The livelihood opportunity is very limited thus,a year-round planting of vegetables is practiced to sustain additional income for the settlers. Farm labor is highly utilized and low productivity was experienced because of manual farming. As such, during peak of drying, farmers are compelled to sell their produce freshly threshed which commands lower price. In 2009, the government provided P3 million financial assistance for the Mestizo 1 hybrid seeds planting and for the establishment of needed <b>agricultural</b> <b>components</b> for Farming improvements. With the Local Government Unit’s strong support, cooperative members embarked on hybrid rice production starting as early as 2007-2008 wet season cropping and followed through the next dry season using 40-percent organic fertilizer.|$|E

40|$|Agroforestry {{is a term}} which {{describes}} systems in which trees, animals and/or crops are grown together in intimate mixtures. The term does not include farm woodlands which do not involve significant biological or environmental interactions between the woodland and <b>agricultural</b> <b>components.</b> A number of papers in this volume have discussed the possibility of increasing timber production in Cumbria, in response to Britain's present high rate of timber imports and excess agricultural production. Agroforestry could contribute to this increased timber production in a manner which would be attractive to the farming community because land would sustain a significant agricultural income whilst the trees were maturing. There are several types of agroforestry. Silvoarable systems are mixtures of trees and crops, while silvopastoralism describes intimate mixtures of trees and animals. Agrenforestry is a term used here to emphasize the co-production of bioenergy crops with agricultural and timber crops. Agrenforestry, described later in more detail, could involve strips of energy coppice amongst agricultural crops, {{or the use of}} coppice beneath wide-spaced standard trees.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the poverty impacts of global merchandise trade reform {{by looking at}} {{a wide range of}} developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Overall, we find that trade reform tends to reduce poverty primarily through the inclusion of <b>agricultural</b> <b>components.</b> The majority of our developing country sample experiences small poverty increases from non-agricultural reforms. We explore the relative poverty-friendliness of agricultural trade reforms in detail, examining the differential impacts on real after-tax factor returns of agricultural versus non-agricultural reforms. This analysis is extended to the distribution of households by looking at stratum-specific poverty changes. Our findings indicate that the more favorable impacts of agricultural reforms are driven by increased returns to peasant farm households’ labor as well as higher returns for unskilled wage labor. Finally, we examine the commodity-specific poverty impacts of trade reform for this sample of countries. We find that liberalization of food grains and other processed foods represent the largest contributions to poverty reduction. More specifically, it is tariff reform in these commodity markets that dominates the poverty increasing impacts of wealthy country subsidy removal.

40|$|ABSTRACT Simulations for root growth, crop growth, and N uptake in agro-hydrological {{models are}} of {{significant}} concern to researchers. SWMS_ 2 D {{is one of}} the most widely used physical hydrologically related models. This model solves equations that govern soil-water movement by the finite element method, and has a public access source code. Incorporating key <b>agricultural</b> <b>components</b> into the SWMS_ 2 D model is of practical importance, especially for modeling some critical cereal crops such as winter wheat. We added root growth, crop growth, and N uptake modules into SWMS_ 2 D. The root growth model had two sub-models, one for root penetration and the other for root length distribution. The crop growth model used was adapted from EU-ROTATE_N, linked to the N uptake model. Soil-water limitation, nitrogen limitation, and temperature effects were all considered in dry-weight modeling. Field experiments for winter wheat in Bouwing, the Netherlands, in 1983 - 1984 were selected for validation. Good agreements were achieved between simulations and measurements, including soil water content at different depths, normalized root length distribution, dry weight and nitrogen uptake. This indicated that the proposed new modules used in the SWMS_ 2 D model are robust and reliable. In the future, more rigorous validation should be carried out, ideally under 2 D situations, and attention should be paid to improve some modules, including the module simulating soil N mineralization...|$|E

The biofilm population was affected by the contact angle and relative hydrophobicity of the supports (r = 0. 79 to 0. 82). Lactic acid was produced by the suspended cells (r = 0. 96) and the biofilm on the plastic composite support discs (r = 0. 85). Incorporation of yeast extract into plastic composite supports enhanced growth of free and attached cells in minimal medium (P < 0. 0001).

This study aims at developing a model-based method for optimization of sugarcane straw recovery costs and {{internal rate of return}} (IRR), as a function of sugarcane productivity, straw recovery fractions and transport distances considering two recovery systems: integral harvesting (IS) and baling system (BS). A simulation procedure using the Virtual Sugarcane Biorefinery (VSB), according to a Central Composite Design (CCD) is used in this study. The scenarios were based on an autonomous ethanol plant, with milling capacity of four million tons per year. The influence of these agricultural parameters on the sugarcane straw recovery costs and internal rate of return was evaluated through this approach, where the CCD was used for the development of an empirical model for optimization as well as a statistical evaluation of results. An optimized IRR (26. 3 %) was obtained for integral system, with low transport distance (20 km), maximum sugarcane stalk productivity (100 t ha(- 1)) and maximum recovery fraction (70 %). The same conditions lead to higher IRR (26. 2 %) for baling system. Results showed that the IS promotes the highest reduction of the <b>agricultural</b> <b>components</b> of straw recovery cost and the optimum IRR considering the vertical integration of sugarcane biorefineries was observed by adopting this system.

40|$|The {{regions in}} Chile where quinoa is grown share certain features, namely the marginality of farmers, {{cultural}} and geographic isolation, and long distances to markets. Yet {{there is an}} increasing global awareness of quinoa's high nutritional value and the heritage value of its biodiversity. This research aimed to develop a sustainable alternative to traditional agriculture through rural tourism that highlights the value of local landrace diversity and associated farming practices. The FAO recognizes the important contribution of generations of farmers in shaping agricultural landscapes whose cultural and <b>agricultural</b> <b>components</b> jointly reflect the evolution of local farming systems. The world heritage value of this agricultural diversity renders agrotourism a relevant approach to its conservation. We studied three regions in Chile where attempts to associate tourism and quinoa are underway: Aymaras communities on the northern Highlands, farming communities of Spanish descent in the centre, and Mapuche farmers in the south. The agrotourism form mobilized in each region is analyzed strategically by combining the study of tourism supply and demand. The three approaches to preserving the heritage of the quinoa crop in Chile are adapted to specific local contexts and territories. Whether it is to define a hiking trail in the North, entice tourists off established tourist circuits in the centre, or {{to develop a new}} endogenous tourism economy among the Mapuche, agrotourism takes different forms where the maintenance of quinoa's agricultural heritage allows relations between farming and tourism activities, market and non-market goods, and cultural and natural goods to be explored.

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} interest for sustainable forms of livestock production systems, which will provide a balanced relationship between environmental, socio-cultural and economic factors. The small ruminant sector is examined with particular focus on the possibilities of improving the sustainability of small ruminant systems and on the possible role of organic production {{to meet the demand}} of sustainability. Current regulations highlighting different approaches and interpretation of organic farming among countries are reviewed. Regulations concerning organic livestock production between the US and the EU are compared. For the future development of organic farming, a strong harmonisation of rules and legislation at international and national level is needed. The process of conversion from conventional to organic poses several problems mainly due to inadequate technical knowledge and value-added activities at farm or regional level with poorly organized marketing. Breeding strategies, feed management and disease control for small ruminant in organic farming are discussed. Animal selection should be designed to reinforce, in a sustainable manner, the relationships between animals and the environment. Feed management will require a better integration between agriculture and livestock, and a transition from monoculture to mosaic, with spatial and temporal integration of <b>agricultural</b> <b>components.</b> Possible alternatives to chemoprophylaxis are available to control helminth diseases, {{such as the use of}} homeopathic treatment, and the improvement of genetic resistance to parasite infections.
