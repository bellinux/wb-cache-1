5|$|At {{the time}} of its bombing, Hiroshima was a city of both {{industrial}} and military significance. A number of military units were located nearby, the most important of which was the headquarters of Field Marshal Shunroku Hata's Second General Army, which commanded the defense of all of southern Japan, and was located in Hiroshima Castle. Hata's command consisted of some 400,000 men, most of whom were on Kyushu where an Allied invasion was correctly anticipated. Also present in Hiroshima were the headquarters of the 59th Army, the 5th Division and the 224th Division, a recently formed mobile unit. The city was defended by five batteries of 7-cm and 8-cm (2.8 and 3.1 inch) <b>anti-aircraft</b> guns of the 3rd <b>Anti-Aircraft</b> Division, including units from the 121st and 122nd <b>Anti-Aircraft</b> Regiments and the 22nd and 45th Separate <b>Anti-Aircraft</b> Battalions. In total, an estimated 40,000 Japanese military personnel were stationed in the city.|$|E
5|$|Bénouville was the {{farthest}} forward {{point of the}} British advance on 6 June 1944. On 9 June, the German Air Force attacked the bridges with 13 aircraft. The British had positioned light and medium-sized <b>anti-aircraft</b> guns around the bridges and {{in the face of}} intense <b>anti-aircraft</b> fire the attack failed, although they did claim one of the bridges was destroyed by a direct hit.|$|E
5|$|Dubrovnik was {{completed}} at the Yarrow shipyards in Glasgow in 1932, {{by which time}} her main guns and light <b>anti-aircraft</b> guns had been installed. After sailing to the Bay of Kotor in the southern Adriatic, she was fitted with her heavy <b>anti-aircraft</b> guns. She was commissioned with the Royal Yugoslav Navy in May 1932. Her captain was Armin Pavić.|$|E
5|$|General Headquarters of the VKJ {{maintained}} direct {{command of}} five infantry divisions, four independent infantry regiments, two motorised engineer regiments and one tank battalion. A further tank battalion was being formed {{at the time}} of the invasion. It also had at its disposal two motorised heavy artillery regiments, fifteen artillery battalions, two <b>anti-aircraft</b> battalions and five independent <b>anti-aircraft</b> companies.|$|E
5|$|Its support units {{included}} the 56th Army Artillery Regiment, the 1st <b>Anti-Aircraft</b> Battalion, and the 1st Army <b>Anti-Aircraft</b> Company. The 1st Air Reconnaissance Group comprising fifteen Breguet 19s was attached from the Royal Yugoslav Air Force and was based at Ruma {{just south of}} Novi Sad.|$|E
5|$|Its support units {{included}} the 76th Artillery Regiment, the 2nd <b>Anti-Aircraft</b> Battalion, the 2nd Army <b>Anti-Aircraft</b> Company, and a border guard battalion at Subotica. The 3rd Air Reconnaissance Group comprising sixteen Breguet 19s was attached from the Royal Yugoslav Air Force and was based at Staro Topolje {{just east of}} Brod.|$|E
5|$|North Vietnam {{continued}} {{to build up}} its combat units in South Vietnam. With the threat of U.S. airpower removed, the North Vietnamese military moved <b>anti-aircraft</b> units into South Vietnam, and deployed a sophisticated air-defence network that included the long-range SA-2 surface-to-air missile system, radar-guided <b>anti-aircraft</b> guns and the SA-7 Grail shoulder-launched missile The strong presence of North Vietnamese <b>anti-aircraft</b> units, which covered much of the northern provinces of South Vietnam, forced Republic of Vietnam Air Force reconnaissance and fighter aircraft to fly at higher altitudes to avoid being hit by surface-to-air missiles. Consequently, when North Vietnam went on the offensive again in 1975, the Republic of Vietnam Air Force was severely handicapped.|$|E
5|$|On November 24, 1985 18 Hawk <b>anti-aircraft</b> {{missiles}} were delivered.|$|E
5|$|Overall, Japanese fighters {{shot down}} 74 B-29s, <b>anti-aircraft</b> guns {{accounted}} for a further 54, and 19 were downed {{by a combination of}} <b>anti-aircraft</b> guns and fighters. IJAAF and IJN losses during the defense of Japan were 1,450 aircraft in combat and another 2,750 to other causes.|$|E
5|$|The 1st Army was {{supported}} by one artillery regiment, one <b>anti-aircraft</b> battalion, and the 1st Air Reconnaissance Group consisting of fifteen Breguet 19s based at Ruma, just west of Sremska Mitrovica. 2nd Army support units comprised one artillery regiment, one <b>anti-aircraft</b> battalion, one border guard battalion, and the 3rd Air Reconnaissance Group consisting of sixteen Breguet 19s based at Staro Topolje just east of Brod.|$|E
5|$|The Army {{also raised}} many <b>anti-aircraft</b> and coastal defence units during the war. The pre-war coastal defences were greatly {{expanded}} from 1939, and many new batteries were built near major ports in Australia and New Guinea {{in response to}} the threat of Japanese attack. Australia had a limited capacity to produce <b>anti-aircraft</b> guns, and the bulk of equipment had to come from Britain. As such the development of such defences was initially hampered by a lack of available equipment. The coastal defence system reached its peak size during 1944. The Army had few <b>anti-aircraft</b> guns at the outbreak of war, and a high priority was given to expanding the air defences around major cities and important industrial and military facilities. By 1942 <b>anti-aircraft</b> batteries were in place around all the major cities as well as the key towns in northern Australia. The expansion of the artillery in general, and coastal defence and <b>anti-aircraft</b> units in particular, meant that by June 1942 some 80,000 of the 406,000 members of the Army were artillerymen. VDC units gradually took over responsibility for manning the fixed coastal and <b>anti-aircraft</b> defences as the threat of attack against the Australian mainland receded.|$|E
5|$|The Oerlikon 20 mm <b>anti-aircraft</b> gun {{was one of}} {{the most}} heavily {{produced}} <b>anti-aircraft</b> guns of the Second World War; the US alone manufactured a total of 124,735 of these guns. When activated in 1941 these guns replaced the 0.50"/90 (12.7mm) M2 Browning MG on a one-for-one basis. The Oerlikon 20mm AA gun remained the primary <b>anti-aircraft</b> weapon of the United States Navy until the introduction of the 40mm Bofors AA gun in 1943.|$|E
5|$|The Oerlikon 20 mm <b>anti-aircraft</b> gun, one of {{the most}} heavily {{produced}} <b>anti-aircraft</b> guns of the Second World War, entered service in 1941, and replaced the /90 M2 Browning MG on a one-for-one basis. Between December 1941 and September 1944, 32% of all Japanese aircraft downed were credited to this weapon, with the high point being 48.3% for the second half of 1942; however, the 20mm guns were found to be ineffective against the Japanese Kamikaze attacks used during the latter half of World War II and were subsequently phased out in favor of the heavier Bofors 40 mm <b>anti-aircraft</b> gun.|$|E
5|$|The attacks at Maldegem and Ursel {{began at}} 08:30. Both I and II./JG 1 became {{involved}} in intense dogfights. III./JG 1 had lost only one aircraft over the target (and not to enemy fire). I./JG lost a further Fw 190 to friendly <b>anti-aircraft</b> fire as it {{made its way to}} Ursel. III./JG 1 lost at least two further Fw 190s to friendly <b>anti-aircraft</b> fire. Casualties could have been heavier, had the British <b>anti-aircraft</b> defences of Maldegem airfield not been removed in December.|$|E
5|$|The brigade was {{equipped}} with 43 <b>anti-aircraft</b> guns ranging in calibre from 20 to 40mm. These guns had a dual role as both <b>anti-aircraft</b> and coastal defence weapons. Many were in concrete emplacements {{on top of the}} submarine pens and other dockside installations of the St Nazaire submarine base.|$|E
5|$|The first {{unit of the}} Second Australian Imperial Force (AIF) to arrive, the 2/3rd Light <b>Anti-Aircraft</b> Battery, disembarked on 11 April, having {{returned}} to Australia from the Middle East just four weeks before. The US 101st Coast Artillery (<b>Anti-Aircraft)</b> Battalion followed on 5 May, and its commander, Lieutenant Colonel Joseph B. Fraser, took charge of Port Moresby's <b>anti-aircraft</b> defences. Morris's command became New Guinea Force on 15 April. By the end of June the ground forces in New Guinea consisted of 1,098 AIF, 12,273 Militia and 2,208 American troops.|$|E
5|$|The forces {{allocated}} to the defence of Singapore were not strong. In early 1945, Japanese air defences for the island included only two Army companies equipped with automatic cannon, some IJN <b>anti-aircraft</b> units, and {{a small number of}} fighter aircraft. Some of the <b>anti-aircraft</b> guns were crewed by Malay auxiliaries. The effectiveness of what was already an inadequate air defence force was hindered by a lack of coordination between the Army and Navy, shortages of fire control equipment for the guns, and no fire-control radar or barrage balloons being available. Defence against night raids was particularly weak as no night fighters were stationed near Singapore and coordination between the <b>anti-aircraft</b> guns and searchlight units was poor.|$|E
5|$|The main {{guns were}} {{controlled}} by an Admiralty Fire Control Clock Mk I that used data {{derived from the}} director and the rangefinder. They had no capability for <b>anti-aircraft</b> fire and the <b>anti-aircraft</b> guns were aimed solely by eye.|$|E
5|$|Tirpitz {{anchorage}} at Kaafjord {{was protected}} by <b>anti-aircraft</b> batteries and fighter aircraft. At the time of Operation Tungsten, four batteries of heavy <b>anti-aircraft</b> guns and seven batteries of light guns were located on the shore near the battleship. Several <b>anti-aircraft</b> vessels and destroyers were also usually moored near Tirpitz. The battleship herself was fitted with 68 <b>anti-aircraft</b> guns. Equipment capable of generating an artificial smokescreen to hide Tirpitz from aircraft had also been installed around Kaafjord. The German Air Force (Luftwaffe) had {{only a small number}} of fighters stationed at bases near Kaafjord, and their operations were constrained by a lack of fuel. British intelligence believed that the German fighter force in the area could be rapidly expanded in the event of an emergency. The Luftwaffe typically conducted three reconnaissance flights into the Arctic Sea each day.|$|E
5|$|Allen's {{regiment}} {{was part}} of the Royal Artillery; he quickly became involved with <b>Anti-Aircraft</b> Command and began to associate with Royal Air Force (RAF) officers. In 1940, he was appointed as an <b>Anti-Aircraft</b> (AA) liaison officer to RAF Hawkinge, part of an initiative to share intelligence on German AA operations with bomber groups; these posts were controlled by a branch of Military Intelligence, MI14E. Later that year, Allen's brother Geoffrey was killed fighting in France.|$|E
5|$|At 16:29, the Japanese dive bombers {{began their}} attacks. Although several {{attempted}} {{to set up}} to attack the Saratoga, they quickly shifted back to the nearer carrier, Enterprise. Thus, Enterprise {{was the target of}} almost the entire Japanese air attack. Several Wildcats followed the Vals into their attack dives, despite the intense <b>anti-aircraft</b> artillery fire from Enterprise and her screening warships, {{in a desperate attempt to}} disrupt their attacks. As many as four Wildcats were shot down by U.S. <b>anti-aircraft</b> fire, as well as several Vals.|$|E
5|$|Autocannons {{are often}} found in aircraft, where they {{replaced}} machine guns and as shipboard <b>anti-aircraft</b> weapons, as they provide greater destructive power than machine guns.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the year}} the Americans felt that they were better {{prepared}} to deliver destruction to the trail system. During Commando Hunt III (1 November 1969 to 30 April 1970), the Air Force claimed that 6,428 enemy trucks destroyed and another 3,604 damaged. 60 aircraft were shot down during this phase of the campaign by an estimated 743 <b>anti-aircraft</b> weapons. This increased number of aircraft losses forced the Air Force to decree that flak suppression missions would accompany the bombers on missions over the trail. Armed with cluster bomb units (CBUs), the fighter bombers were poised to pounce upon any enemy <b>anti-aircraft</b> positions identified by other aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Coastal Defence Command was {{supported}} by a heavy artillery regiment and an <b>anti-aircraft</b> battalion, and a coastal reconnaissance squadron of four aircraft based near Mostar.|$|E
5|$|Defences were {{in place}} at both bridges. On {{the west bank of}} the Caen Canal bridge there were three machine-gun emplacements and on the east bank a machine-gun and an {{anti-tank}} gun. To their north were another three machine-guns and a concrete pillbox. An <b>anti-aircraft</b> tower equipped with machine-guns stood to the south. At the River Orne bridge, the eastern bank south of the bridge had a pillbox with anti-tank and <b>anti-aircraft</b> guns. To the north of the bridge were two machine-guns. Both bridges had sandbagged trench systems along the banks.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, 97 F {{was used}} for convoy, patrol, escort and {{minesweeping}} tasks, and anti-submarine operations. In 1917, one of her 66mm guns was placed on an <b>anti-aircraft</b> mount.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, several 14-pounder and 9-pounder <b>anti-aircraft</b> {{guns were}} added, {{with the older}} 9-pounder guns being removed to keep {{displacement}} down. In 1930, she was modified to carry a reconnaissance seaplane.|$|E
5|$|For air defense, Hezbollah has <b>anti-aircraft</b> {{weapons that}} include the ZU-23 {{artillery}} and the man-portable, shoulder-fired SA-7 and SA-18 surface-to-air missile (SAM). One {{of the most effective}} weapons deployed by Hezbollah has been the C-802 anti-ship missile.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} time since the {{construction}} of the Iowa class, the US Navy was not building a fast battleship class solely for the purpose of escorting Pacific-based aircraft carriers, and thus the Montana class would not be designed principally for escorting the fast carrier task forces; nonetheless they would have been equipped with a wide array of <b>anti-aircraft</b> guns to protect themselves and other ships (principally the US aircraft carriers) from Japanese fighters and dive bombers. If commissioned, the ships were expected to mount a considerable array of Oerlikon 20 mm and Bofors 40 mm <b>anti-aircraft</b> weapons.|$|E
5|$|In the event, {{the biggest}} threat Gibraltar faced in the 20th century came from the air. The only action seen by Gibraltar's coastal defences during the First World War {{occurred}} in August 1917 when the 6-inch gun at Devil's Gap Battery engaged and sank a German U-boat travelling on the surface. The Second World War presented a much greater challenge to Gibraltar's defences {{as a result of}} the development of long-range bomber aircraft. Numerous <b>anti-aircraft</b> positions were established across Gibraltar, many of them built on top of existing fortifications and equipped with 40mm and 3.7-inch <b>anti-aircraft</b> guns. By March 1941 there were twenty-eight 3.7-inch guns and twenty-two (and eventually forty-eight) Bofors guns, plus two pom-pom guns. Numerous searchlights were installed – by 1942 there were twenty-four located around Gibraltar – and rocket projectors, an early though rather ineffectual form of <b>anti-aircraft</b> missiles, were also brought in. Bunkers and pillboxes were built to guard against amphibious landings, especially on the eastern side of the Rock, and anti-tank guns, ditches and obstacles were installed facing the isthmus to guard against a land attack.|$|E
5|$|Leipzig had her <b>anti-aircraft</b> {{armament}} modernized {{to bring}} her closer to the standard of weaponry fitted to her sister. After 1934, two additional 8.8cm guns were added, with another pair later. Starting in 1941, eight 3.7cm guns were installed, along with fourteen 2cm guns. After 1944, she only carried eight of the 2cm guns. Nürnbergs <b>anti-aircraft</b> battery was improved {{over the course of}} World War II. In late 1942, a pair of Army-variant 2cm Flakvierling quadruple mounts were installed, one on the navigating bridge and the other on top of the aft superfiring turret. In May 1944, the navy proposed installing several Bofors 40 mm guns, but most of these weapons were diverted to other uses, and only two guns were installed. One was mounted on the bridge and the other where the catapult had been located. Two Navy-pattern Flakvierlings were added; one replaced the Army model atop the aft superfiring turret, and the other was placed in front of the <b>anti-aircraft</b> fire director. The Army-pattern Flakvierlings were moved to the main deck. In December 1944, another revised <b>anti-aircraft</b> plan was proposed, this time incorporating the new 3.7 cm FlaK 43 gun, of which there were to be eight, along with two Flakvierlings and ten 2cm twin mounts. Germany's wartime situation by the end of 1944 prevented these changes from being made, however.|$|E
5|$|North Vietnam's {{deployment}} of SAMs forced American pilots to make hard choices: either approach targets at higher altitudes (to avoid <b>anti-aircraft</b> fire) and become prey to SAMs, or fly lower {{to avoid the}} missiles and become the target of <b>anti-aircraft</b> batteries. Due to altered tactics and {{the increased use of}} electronic radar jamming, the record of SAM kills decreased over time. The already dismal missile success rate fell from one kill in 30 launches to less than one kill in 50.|$|E
5|$|On 28 October New Jersey steamed {{south to}} engage Communist targets. During the {{shelling}} aircraft spotting for the battleship reported taking heavy <b>anti-aircraft</b> {{fire to the}} extreme north of the target zone; subsequently, New Jersey altered her fire to silence the site with her big guns. The next day New Jersey leveled 30structures, destroyed three underground bunkers, and shelled a Viet Cong trench line. That afternoon an aerial observer located an enemy artillery position on a hilltop southwest of Cap Lay. New Jersey responded by firing six 16inch rounds at the site, destroying it. Follow up assaults on 30 October destroyed a Communist resupply area and an <b>anti-aircraft</b> site.|$|E
5|$|Seven minutes later, {{two other}} high-calibre shells struck the Bretagne {{at the same}} time. The first detonated {{at the base of}} the tripod mast, igniting some {{ready-to-use}} <b>anti-aircraft</b> projectiles which were stored in lockers next to the <b>anti-aircraft</b> mounts. The second went through the central 138 mm casement, exploding deep inside the ship. A fire started, with leaking oil burning next to the ship. In about thirty seconds, the ship rolled and exploded.|$|E
5|$|Since gaining {{air superiority}} over U.S. forces {{was out of}} the question, the {{northern}} leadership decided to implement a policy of air deniability. At the beginning of the campaign, North Vietnam possessed approximately 1,500 <b>anti-aircraft</b> weapons, most of which were of the light 37 and 57mm variety. Within one year, however, the U.S. estimated that the number had grown to over 5,000 guns, including 85 and 100mm radar-directed weapons. That estimate was later revised downward from a high of 7,000 in early 1967 to less than a thousand by 1972. Regardless, during Rolling Thunder, 80 percent of U.S. aircraft losses were attributed to <b>anti-aircraft</b> fire.|$|E
5|$|Since it {{soon became}} obvious that the Japanese force had no air cover, the U.S. {{aircraft}} were able to set up for their attacks without fear of opposition from Japanese aircraft. U.S. bomber and torpedo aircraft arriving over the Yamato group—after their two-hour flight from Okinawa—were thus able to circle the Japanese ship formation just out of <b>anti-aircraft</b> range in order to methodically set up their attacks on the warships below. The first wave of U.S. carrier planes were spotted by a Japanese lookout on the bridge at 12:32. Two minutes later, Yamato opened fire with her 460mm main batteries. The Japanese ships stopped zigzagging and increased speed to , beginning evasive maneuvers, and opened fire with their <b>anti-aircraft</b> guns. Yamato carried almost 150 <b>anti-aircraft</b> guns, including her massive 460mm guns.|$|E
