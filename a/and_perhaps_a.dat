5|$|Cynesige (died 22 December 1060) was {{a medieval}} English Archbishop of York between 1051 and 1060. Prior to his {{appointment}} to York, {{he was a}} royal clerk <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>a</b> monk at Peterborough. As archbishop, he built and adorned his cathedral {{as well as other}} churches, and was active in consecrating bishops. After his death in 1060, the bequests he had made to a monastery were confiscated by the queen.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{widespread}} {{standards for}} pressure measurement of diving gas. In the USA <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>a</b> few other places {{the pressure is}} measured in {{pounds per square inch}} (psi), {{and the rest of the}} world uses bar. Sometimes gauges may be calibrated in other metric units, such as kilopascal (kPa) or megapascal (MPa), or in atmospheres (atm, or ATA), particularly gauges not actually used underwater.|$|E
5|$|Later in the year, in April, {{he was one}} of four Scottish envoys sent to Canterbury for {{abortive}} {{talks with}} the English and French. In the next few years, Nicholas' activities are difficult to trace, but he was probably involved in much diplomatic activity, including perhaps having a hand in drawing up the brief which Baldred Bisset would later deliver to the pope in the interests of Scottish independence. It was probably in this time too that Nicholas became a clerk at Arbroath Abbey <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>a</b> canon of Dunblane Cathedral.|$|E

60|$|Martin {{looked at}} him, {{and made no}} answer; but a curious {{observer}} might have detected an ominous twitching at his mouth, <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>an</b> involuntary attraction {{of his right hand}} in the direction of Mr Pecksniff's cravat.|$|R
5|$|The broad-billed parrot's {{head was}} large in {{proportion}} to its body, {{and there was a}} distinct crest of feathers {{on the front of the}} head. The bird had a very large beak, comparable in size to that of the hyacinth macaw, which would have enabled it to crack hard seeds. Subfossil bones indicate that the species exhibited greater sexual dimorphism in overall size and head size than any living parrot. The exact colouration is unknown, but a contemporary description indicates that it had multiple colours, including a blue head, <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>a</b> red body and beak. It is believed to have been a weak flier, but not flightless.|$|E
5|$|A typical early 19th-century casual ward was {{a single}} large room {{furnished}} {{with some kind of}} bedding <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>a</b> bucket {{in the middle of the}} floor for sanitation. The bedding on offer could be very basic: the Poor Law authorities in Richmond in the mid-1840s provided only straw and rags, although beds were available for the sick. In return for their night's accommodation vagrants might be expected to undertake a certain amount of work before leaving the next day, such as at Guisborough, where men were required to break stones for three hours and women to pick oakum, two hours before breakfast and one after. Until the passage of the Casual Poor Act 1882 vagrants could discharge themselves before 11 am on the day following their admission, but from 1883 onwards they were required to be detained until 9 am on the second day. Those who were admitted to the workhouse again within one month were required to be detained until the fourth day after their admission.|$|E
5|$|When the Persians {{arrived at}} Thermopylae in mid-August, they {{initially}} waited {{for three days}} for the Allies to disperse. When Xerxes was eventually persuaded that the Allies intended to contest the pass, he sent his troops to attack. However, the Greek position was ideally suited to hoplite warfare, the Persian contingents being forced to attack the phalanx head on. The Allies thus withstood two full days of battle and everything Xerxes could throw at them. However, {{at the end of}} the second day, they were betrayed by a local resident named Ephialtes who revealed to Xerxes a mountain path that led behind the Allied lines. Xerxes then sent his elite guards, the Immortals on a night march to outflank the Allied. When he was made aware of this maneuver (while the Immortals were still en route), Leonidas dismissed the bulk of the Allied army, remaining to guard the rear with 300 Spartans, 700 Thespians, 400 Thebians <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>a</b> few hundred others. On the third day of the battle, the remaining Allies sallied forth from the wall to meet the Persians and slaughter as many as they could. Ultimately, however, the Allied rearguard was annihilated, and the pass of Thermopylae opened to the Persians.|$|E

5000|$|Racial {{and sexual}} {{differences}} are compared and contrasted, both represented as areas for conflict {{that must be}} addressed en route to mature love. According to some readings, this complete unity represents another 'another country' <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>an</b> impossible utopia. Stefanie Dunning writes: ...|$|R

25|$|The {{fortification}} had two monumental gates, {{one to the}} west, {{giving access}} to the outer settlements, and another to the east, probably to a steep road leading directly to the Danube (<b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>a</b> harbour).|$|E

25|$|There {{may be an}} echo of strife with Lydia <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>a</b> veiled {{reference}} to royal hostages, in {{the legend of the}} twice-unlucky Phrygian prince Adrastus, who accidentally killed his brother and exiled himself to Lydia, where King Croesus welcomed him. Once again, Adrastus accidentally killed Croesus' son and then committed suicide.|$|E
25|$|Plates tend to {{bear the}} State or Territory name <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>a</b> state motto or slogan {{at the top and}} / or bottom of the plate. Recent issues of plates (since the 1990s) also often use the state's colours and may include some imagery related to the state (such thing as the state's logo as the dot {{separating}} the groups of numbers).|$|E
25|$|Ultimately, {{however, the}} {{publisher}} was battered by market forces, {{a few bad}} decisions, <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>a</b> lack of focus. The game system more or less disappeared from the market {{by the end of}} 1996 when ADB was unable to design new games without being paid for the previous ones. Two years of tedious negotiations were completed in January 1999 and Amarillo Design Bureau, Inc. was born.|$|E
50|$|William B. Gould {{was born}} to <b>a</b> slave woman <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>an</b> Englishman. He learned {{to read and write}} and is known for his {{detailed}} entries in a diary about his work as a plasterer. He was owned by the Nixon family and worked on the Bellamy House.|$|R

25|$|When {{framed in}} wood for snug fitting of a door, the doorway {{consists}} of two vertical jambs on either side, a lintel or head jamb at the top, <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>a</b> threshold at the bottom. When a door {{has more than one}} movable section, one of the sections may be called a leaf. See door furniture for a discussion of attachments to doors such as door handles, doorknobs, and door knockers.|$|E
25|$|The first explorers {{had been}} welcomed by the Indians with dancing, feasting, and tobacco ceremonies. Despite the {{hospitality}} of Wahunsenacawh, {{the presence of}} the English settlers <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>a</b> further expedition up the James River by Captain Christopher Newport provoked the Paspahegh, Weyanock, and other groups to mount a series of attacks on the fort during period of violence lasting from May 27 to July 14, 1607.|$|E
25|$|Perborough Castle is {{the site}} of an Iron Age univallate hillfort located at Compton in Berkshire. The site covers {{approximately}} , and lies on the chalky downs of West Berkshire. Archaeological evidence, from excavations in 1838, suggest that it was a lightly defended <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>a</b> seasonally occupied site, containing {{no more than a few}} grain storage pits and slag pits, the extent of these being the obvious sign of continued occupation.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} Exile games used a top-down perspective tile-based graphical system, effectively displayed as an X-Y axis wherein each tile in {{the grid}} was filled by <b>a</b> base graphic <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>an</b> item or character icon. Avernum features a 45-degree axonometric display that appears three-dimensional. The game also adds varying terrain height, allowing for more interesting map layouts.|$|R

For most purposes, you’ll actually want a single estimate of the likely methylation state at that position, <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>an</b> estimate of how confident you can be that this is actually the correct value.|$|R
25|$|By three o'clock, {{however, they}} had both returned, and I would take the opportunity, five minutes later, of again sending Miss Botterill to the Aerated Bread Company for my mid-afternoon cup of tea. This I would drink, unthickened by food, but at half-past four I would send her out for another cup, and with this I would eat a roll and butter, a small dish of honey, <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>a</b> single doughnut.|$|E
25|$|In {{large scale}} river {{navigation}} improvements, weirs and locks are used together. A weir {{will increase the}} depth of a shallow stretch, and the required lock will either be built in {{a gap in the}} weir, or at the downstream end of an artificial cut which bypasses the weir <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>a</b> shallow stretch of river below it. A river improved by these means is often called a Waterway or River Navigation (see example Calder and Hebble Navigation).|$|E
25|$|A trigger pad could contain {{up to four}} {{independent}} sensors, each of them {{capable of}} sending information describing the timing and dynamic intensity of a stroke to the drum module/brain. A circular drum pad may have only one sensor for triggering, but a 2016-era cymbal-shaped rubber pad/cymbal will often contain two; one for the body {{and one for the}} bell at the centre of the cymbal, <b>and</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>a</b> cymbal choke trigger, to allow drummers to produce this effect.|$|E
