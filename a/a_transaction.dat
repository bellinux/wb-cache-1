5|$|In 2009, Raycom Media (owner of Honolulu-based NBC and MyNetworkTV affiliates, KHNL and KFVE) {{announced}} it would take over the operations of local CBS affiliate KGMB (then owned by MCG Capital Corporation), giving it control {{of three of the}} television stations in Hawaii. The deal was a complex arrangement which involved trading the non-license assets of KFVE (such as its call sign, programming, and network affiliation) for those of KGMB (effectively placing the station under Raycom ownership, but using KFVE's license, signal, and virtual channel 5), and taking over KFVE (which moved to the channel 9 license owned by MCG Capital) under a shared services agreement. Due to its nature, the swap was not <b>a</b> <b>transaction</b> that would require the intervention of the FCC, aside from the changing of call signs. The three stations were then folded into a shared news operation branded as Hawaii News Now. An estimated 68 positions from a total of 198 from the three stations would be eliminated as part of the agreement. On November 20, 2013, MCG Capital filed to sell KFVE to the aforementioned American Spirit Media.|$|E
5|$|Suffering from {{recurrent}} fever and a tremor (possibly malaria) since his voyage, Cabral withdrew to Santarém in 1509. He spent his remaining years there.

According to a royal letter dated 17 December 1509, Cabral was {{party to a dispute}} over <b>a</b> <b>transaction</b> involving property which belonged to him. Another letter of that same year reported that he was to receive certain privileges for an undisclosed military service. In 1518, or perhaps previously, he was raised from fidalgo to knight in the King's Council and was entitled to a monthly allowance of 2,437 reais. This was in addition to the annual allowance granted to him in 1497, and still being paid. Cabral died of unspecified causes, most probably in 1520. He was buried in the São João Evangelista chapel of the Convento da Graça in Santarém.|$|E

It {{has been argued that}} the alleged crime was committed by British citizens living in the UK against a British company based in London and therefore, any resulting criminal case falls {{under the jurisdiction of the}} English courts. However, the Serious Fraud Office decided not to prosecute due to lack of evidence. There has been criticism that the Americans do not have to produce a prima facie case, or even a reasonable one, to extradite British citizens, whereas no such facility exists to extradite US citizens to the UK. On 28 November 2007 the three admitted one charge of wire fraud after a plea bargain. On 22 February 2008 they were each sentenced to 37 months in prison.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} elastic <b>transactions,</b> <b>a</b> {{variant of}} the transactional model. Upon conflict detection, <b>an</b> elastic <b>transaction</b> might drop what it did so far within <b>a</b> separate <b>transaction</b> that immediately commits, and initiate <b>a</b> new <b>transaction</b> which might itself be elastic. Elastic <b>transactions</b> are <b>a</b> complementary alternative to traditional transactions, particularly appealing when implementing search structures. Elastic transactions can be safely composed with normal ones, but significantly improve performance if used instead. ...|$|R

25|$|The Subversion {{filesystem}} uses transactions to keep changes atomic. <b>A</b> <b>transaction</b> {{operates on}} a specified {{revision of the}} filesystem, not necessarily the latest. The transaction has its own root, on which changes are made. It is then either committed and becomes the latest revision, or is aborted. The transaction is actually a long-lived filesystem object; a client {{does not need to}} commit or abort <b>a</b> <b>transaction</b> itself, rather it can also begin <b>a</b> <b>transaction,</b> exit, and then can re-open the transaction and continue using it. Potentially, multiple clients can access the same transaction and work together on an atomic change, though no existing clients expose this capability.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} aims {{to elucidate}} Saudi Arabia’s {{mergers and acquisitions}} (M 2 ̆ 6 A) laws. The dissertation studies and analyzes current Saudi M 2 ̆ 6 A laws with reference to comparative models from different countries and provides recommendations to improve the transparency and efficiency of Saudi Arabia’s M 2 ̆ 6 A laws. Such improvements may help companies attempting to conduct M 2 ̆ 6 A activity in Saudi Arabia address certain barriers and difficulties, which may in turn help to stimulate the Saudi Arabian economy. Saudi Arabia {{is considered one of}} the world’s foremost emerging markets. Since Saudi Arabia joined the World Trade Organization, its stock market has been growing quickly, including rapid growth in M 2 ̆ 6 <b>A</b> <b>transactions.</b> The author of this paper argues that Saudi has a significant need for M 2 ̆ 6 A activity and notes that despite the sharp growth in M 2 ̆ 6 A activity in Saudi in recent years, most of Saudi’s M 2 ̆ 6 A laws are not modern or sophisticated enough to handle the large, complex M 2 ̆ 6 <b>A</b> <b>transactions</b> that are beginning to occur in the Kingdom. Certain M 2 ̆ 6 <b>A</b> <b>transactions</b> attempted in Saudi, such as the Sahara-Sipchem deal, have been unsuccessful due to the absence of a legal framework capable of reinforcing and protecting M 2 ̆ 6 <b>A</b> <b>transactions</b> and boosting M 2 ̆ 6 A activities. This paper offers a critique and analysis of Saudi Arabia’s M 2 ̆ 6 A laws. The author argues that most of Saudi’s current M 2 ̆ 6 A laws discourage corporations from engaging in M 2 ̆ 6 A activity and/or cause M 2 ̆ 6 <b>A</b> <b>transactions</b> to fail due to their (the laws’) deficits. This dissertation identifies loopholes in the Saudi legislation that governs M 2 ̆ 6 <b>A</b> <b>transactions.</b> It covers antitrust law, corporate law, securities law and tax law and provides recommendations supported by models from different jurisdictions as to how M 2 ̆ 6 A laws in Saudi can be made more efficient and brought in line with modern economic principles...|$|R

Using correlators, {{it is possible to}} split <b>a</b> complex <b>transaction</b> into several nested child transactions, where each child transaction can have child transactions of its own.

Distributed transactions, as any other transactions, must have all four ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) properties, where atomicity guarantees all-or-nothing outcomes for the unit of work (operations bundle).|$|R
