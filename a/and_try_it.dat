500|$|The {{film was}} shot in bright, primary colors rather than the {{black-and-white}} of the director's previous features, but it retained his usual languid pacing. Jarmusch characterized the color choice as [...] "intuitive". He deliberately chose a cool color palette, eschewing yellows and oranges and using only sporadic dashes of red (as in the Japanese couple's ubiquitous suitcase). This motif of flashes of red was later described by Suzanne Scott of Reverse Shot as [...] "giving {{the impression of a}} failed attempt to grab a bit of Elvis’s glamor <b>and</b> <b>try</b> <b>it</b> on for size, only to inevitably discover that it looks cartoonish out of context". Stills from the film as well as on-location shots of the actors and the film crew by photographer Masayoshi Sukita were published to accompany the film as the photo collection Mystery Train: A Film by Jim Jarmusch.|$|E
500|$|In the single-player mode, the game's main [...] {{sees the}} player {{take on the}} part of a Terran pilot, in which they engage in a series of {{missions}} that become increasingly challenging and sophisticated overtime the more the progress into the campaign; the difficulty level of the campaign can be changed at any time, in between missions. To ease players into the various controls of the game, training missions are included in the campaign, mixed in between regular missions, that gradually introduce the player to advanced commands and techniques. Completing a mission and subsequently unlocking the next one, requires meeting a number of objective defined for it, although not all need to be completed to end the mission successfully; some are scripted to be failed as part of the campaign's story. If a player dies on a mission, or fail to complete vital objectives (i.e. protecting an important ship), players can restart a mission <b>and</b> <b>try</b> <b>it</b> again. In missions, players receive directives tied to their missions, such as destroying a target, protecting an asset, or another task (i.e. inspecting something), which turn blue for completion, red for being failed; multiple targets of a directive (such as destroying an enemy wing) include a number in brackets that decreases as targets are destroyed or depart.|$|E
500|$|In October 1967, {{recording}} {{sessions for}} the second Jimi Hendrix Experience album [...] began at Olympic Studios in London. [...] On October 25, after recording the strongly R [...] "Wait Until Tomorrow", the Experience recorded an instrumental version of [...] "Little Wing". [...] It followed the same chord progression as the later master recording, but had a more forceful rock feel. After another take in the same vein, Chandler called for a different approach. [...] Recording engineer Eddie Kramer explained, [...] "Chas knew right away what was needed. [...] He had Jimi slow the tempo down <b>and</b> <b>try</b> <b>it</b> again". [...] After the basic track was completed, Hendrix and Kramer recorded overdubs on October 28, 1967. [...] For his recordings, Hendrix expended considerable effort to achieve the optimal tone for his guitar tracks. [...] For his rhythm guitar, he had set his pickup selector to a nonstandard position between the neck and middle settings to achieve a [...] "hollow" [...] tone, sometimes mistakenly referred to as [...] "out-of-phase". [...] However, for the lead, Kramer later fed the guitar signal through a makeshift Leslie speaker, which was normally used for electric organs. By rotating the sound, Leslie speakers produce vibrato- and tremolo-like effects, i.e., a pulsing or quivering addition to the sound (Hendrix later popularized {{the use of the}} Univibe phase shifter effects pedal, which can be set to get a roughly similar effect). [...] Next, Hendrix added a straight ("dry, without any effects") glockenspiel to underscore his vocal and guitar. [...] According to Kramer, [...] "Jimi always kept an eye out for odd instruments that would be lying about the studio" [...] and found the glockenspiel in Studio A. [...] Last to be recorded was his vocal, which was treated with sound processing techniques to give it an airy sound. [...] These have been variously described as artificial double tracking (ADT), phasing, Pultec filter equalization, and processing with a Leslie speaker.|$|E

2500|$|In November 2010, Sharp sent {{a camera}} crew to film some of Brown's exploits. After seeing the footage, a {{producer}} from Animal Planet visited Brown and challenged him to [...] "entertain [...] for 12 hours". Brown told the Herald-Leader {{that he took}} the producer on an outing in which he caught 11 turtles and a catfish. Following the producer's visit, Animal Planet decided to air a series of 12 half-hour episodes featuring Brown. Originally given the working title The Turtleman of Wild Kentucky, the name was changed to Call of the Wildman [...] a reference to Brown's signature yell. Brown describes the yell as [...] "an Indian yell" [...] and explains, [...] "I got a quarter Shawnee and a quarter Cherokee. The other quarter is white man – that's a Yankee, Union – and another quarter is Confederate". In addition, Brown frequently uses the catchphrase [...] "Live action!" [...] during the series. He explains that [...] "'Live action' means there's no faking. People have been calling me fake, and there ain't no fake. Go ahead <b>and</b> <b>try</b> <b>it!</b> We're doing it live action." ...|$|E
