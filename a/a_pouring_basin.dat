The <b>pouring</b> <b>basin,</b> sprue, runner and {{the gate of the}} bolster casting were designed according to the principle of the new filling system. The filling and solidification process of the bolster casting were also simulated. It was found that the filling process was smooth, and air entrapment and shrinkage were avoided. Finally, a further validation of the new filling system of bolster casting was carried out in a foundry...|$|R

25|$|First, {{a pattern}} {{is made from}} {{polystyrene}} foam, which {{can be done by}} many different ways. For small volume runs the pattern can be hand cut or machined from a solid block of foam; if the geometry is simple enough it can even be cut using a hot-wire foam cutter. If the volume is large, then the pattern can be mass-produced by a process similar to injection molding. Pre-expanded beads of polystyrene are injected into a preheated aluminum mold at low pressure. Steam is then applied to the polystyrene which causes it to expand more to fill the die. The final pattern is approximately 97.5% air and 2.5% polystyrene. Pre-made <b>pouring</b> <b>basins,</b> runners, and risers can be hot glued to the pattern to finish it.|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} {{investigations}} on knocking out temperature of CuSn 10, CuSn 5 Zn 5 Pb 5 and AlSi 11 castings vacuum prepared in gypsum moulds. The experimental castings were prepared {{in form of}} rings of diameters ø 30, 20 and 10 mm, width 10 mm and wall thickness g= 0, 6; 0, 8; 1, 0 and 2, 0 mm respectively. Casting temperatures were 1120 and 1200 for bronzes and 700 and 800 oC for silumin. The crack sensitivity of the rings was evaluated. It can be stated, {{on the base of}} the tests, that casting should be knocked out as soon as possible after <b>pouring</b> <b>basin</b> crystallizes. In case of tested castings the limiting dimensions of the rings are diameter ø 30 mm and and thickness g= 0, 8 for CuSn 10.

40|$|Abstract. We report {{preliminary}} {{results of an}} ongoing study in which a virtual environment (VE) system is used to facilitate motor relearning of <b>a</b> <b>pouring</b> task in patients with Acquired Brain Injury (ABI). Four subjects were evaluated pre-and post-VE training using virtual-world and real-world tests in which subjects performed <b>a</b> <b>pouring</b> motion while holding a cup. Standard clinical tests of motor and functional ability were also used. Three of four subjects demonstrated improvement in end-point trajectories (cup path) performed during the virtual and real world tests. Clinical test scores also improved. Results indicate that subjects with ABI were able to learn a movement in VE, and generalize this ability to real-world performance of similar and unrelated tasks. VE training {{appears to be a}} feasible and promising approach to the rehabilitation of subjects with ABI...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} measured mechanical properties of thixoformed aluminium 7075 feedstock produced by the direct thermal method (DTM). The DTM feedstock billets were processed with <b>a</b> <b>pouring</b> temperature of 685 °C and holding periods of 20 s, 40 s and 60 s before being quenched and subsequently thixoformed. A conventionally cast feedstock billet was produced with <b>a</b> <b>pouring</b> temperature of 685 °C and was allowed to solidify without quenching. The feedstock billets were later formed by an injection test unit in the semi-solid state. Tensile testing was then conducted on the thixoformed feedstock billets. Tensile properties for 7075 DTM thixoformed feedstock billets were found significantly influenced by the thixoformed component density. Samples with longer holding times {{were found to have}} higher density and higher tensile strength...|$|R
