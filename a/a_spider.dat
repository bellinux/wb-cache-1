5|$|The 10th Century Saint Conrad of Constance is {{sometimes}} {{represented as a}} bishop holding a chalice with <b>a</b> <b>spider.</b> According to this story, while he was celebrating Easter Mass, <b>a</b> <b>spider</b> fell into the chalice.

5|$|Children and infants may {{be unable}} to report being bitten, making it {{difficult}} to associate their symptoms with <b>a</b> <b>spider</b> bite. Symptoms seen in infants include inconsolable crying, refusing to feed and a general erythematous rash. Muscle aches and pains, and neck spasm are often seen in children over four years of age.|$|E
5|$|Many other {{biological}} structures exhibit liquid-crystal behavior. For instance, the concentrated {{protein solution}} that is extruded by <b>a</b> <b>spider</b> to generate silk is, in fact, a liquid crystal phase.

40|$|We {{show that}} the fast {{escaping}} set $A(f) $ of a transcendental entire function $f$ has a structure known as <b>a</b> <b>spider's</b> web whenever the maximum modulus of $f$ grows below a certain rate.

5|$|Spiders {{have been}} the focus of stories and mythologies of various {{cultures}} for centuries.

5|$|The prey {{does not}} have to be {{attracted}} towards the predator for the predator to benefit: it is sufficient for the predator simply not to be identified as a threat.

For example, the spider Arachnocoris berytoides resembles Faiditus caudatus, <b>a</b> <b>spider</b> commensal of ants.|$|E

5|$|If <b>a</b> <b>spider</b> walks under a P. schultzi female's capture web and the {{vertical}} distance {{is less than}} 8centimetres, the P. schultzi often drops onto the prey too fast for a human eye to follow. If the P. schultzi misses, it quickly returns up its safety line to its vantage point and looks for another chance - and seldom misses the second time. Most drops cover two to four centimetres, as longer drops are often obstructed by the web.|$|E

5|$|In {{his second}} {{meeting of the}} day with Scully and Doggett, Wells {{explains}} that he cannot remember the last few days. Scully suggests that maybe he did do it. Wells begins having flashes of the murder but they are unclear. Waiting in his cell, he kills <b>a</b> <b>spider.</b> Later, a nanny cam from his house reveals that {{the only person to}} arrive between the police’s arrival and the last time his wife is on camera is Martin Wells. Eventually, Wells meets his lawyers and tells them about the nanny cam. However, it turns out that it is Wednesday: Wells is somehow “living the week backwards”.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many species}} of spider, a P. schultzi lays a {{continuous}} dragline of silk as it moves, {{and from time to}} time anchors the dragline to a surface with a spot of sticky silk. This allows the spider to return to the surface if the animal is dislodged. <b>A</b> <b>spider</b> about to jump first lays a sticky silk anchor, and then lays out a dragline as it flies. Unlike those of most jumping spiders, P. schultzi′s draglines stick to each other and, when a P. schultzi has laid a few lines across a gap, it uses these as walkways and reinforces them with additional silk as it moves.|$|E
5|$|Phaeacius is <b>a</b> <b>spider</b> genus of the Salticidae family (jumping spiders). Phaeacius {{is in the}} {{subfamily}} Spartaeinae, {{which is}} thought to be primitive.

5|$|While {{going to}} meet Doggett and Scully, Wells gets shoved into a dominos game and while picking them up gets slashed on his right cheek from a man with the spider web tattoo on his hand. Wells tells Doggett and Scully that he is moving {{backwards}} in time and cannot recall the past few days. Doggett is skeptical, but Scully hears him out. Wells says {{there must be a}} reason for it and Scully suggests that the answer may already be within him. Studying the evidence of the case, Wells has a flash of the murder that reveals the knife in a hand with <b>a</b> <b>spider</b> web tattoo.|$|E
5|$|All Regulus {{species are}} almost {{exclusively}} insectivorous, preying on small arthropods with soft cuticles, such as springtails, aphids and spiders. They also {{feed on the}} cocoons and eggs of spiders and insects, and occasionally take pollen. All species will catch flying insects while hovering. Although the similarly sized goldcrest and firecrest are often found together, {{there are a number}} of factors that minimise direct competition for food. Goldcrests prefer smaller prey than common firecrests. Although both will take trapped insects from spider webs on autumn migration, firecrests will also eat the large orb-web spiders (on rare occasions kinglets have been found stuck in <b>a</b> <b>spider</b> web, either unable to move or dead).|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the eight}} legs of <b>a</b> <b>spider</b> {{consists}} of seven distinct parts. The part closest to and attaching the leg to the cephalothorax is the coxa; the next segment is the short trochanter that works as a hinge for the following long segment, the femur; next is the spider's knee, the patella, which acts as the hinge for the tibia; the metatarsus is next, and it connects the tibia to the tarsus (which may {{be thought of as}} a foot of sorts); the tarsus ends in a claw made up of either two or three points, depending on the family to which the spider belongs. Although all arthropods use muscles attached to the inside of the exoskeleton to flex their limbs, spiders and a few other groups still use hydraulic pressure to extend them, a system inherited from their pre-arthropod ancestors. The only extensor muscles in spider legs are located in the three hip joints (bordering the coxa and the trochanter). As a result, <b>a</b> <b>spider</b> with a punctured cephalothorax cannot extend its legs, and the legs of dead spiders curl up. Spiders can generate pressures up to eight times their resting level to extend their legs, and jumping spiders can jump up to 50 times their own length by suddenly increasing the blood pressure in the third or fourth pair of legs. Although larger spiders use hydraulics to straighten their legs, unlike smaller jumping spiders they depend on their flexor muscles to generate the propulsive force for their jumps.|$|E
