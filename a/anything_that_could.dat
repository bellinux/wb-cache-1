5|$|Feynman tried LSD {{during his}} {{professorship}} at Caltech. He also tried marijuana and ketamine experiences at John Lilly's famed sensory deprivation tanks, {{as a way}} of studying consciousness. He gave up alcohol when he began to show vague, early signs of alcoholism, as {{he did not want to}} do <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> damage his brain.|$|E
5|$|In April 2015, metal {{detectors}} were installed {{as a permanent}} fixture to the entrance. The attraction officially had {{metal detectors}}, security with metal detecting wands, and a zero tolerance policy for cell phones, wallets, coins, watches, cameras, <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> be placed in one's pockets; all pockets were to be absolutely empty prior to boarding. Persons in violation {{would be sent to}} the lockers or possibly ejected from the park without a refund.|$|E
5|$|Goya {{worked on}} The Disasters of War {{during a period}} when he was {{producing}} images more for his own satisfaction than for any contemporary audience. His work came to rely less on historical incidents than his own imagination. Many of the later plates contain fantastical motifs which {{can be seen as}} a return to the imagery of the Caprichos. In this, he is relying on visual clues derived from his inner life, rather than <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> be recognised from real events or settings.|$|E

5|$|Motohiro {{wanted to}} return to making anime after a long hiatus but he needed a charismatic script writer. Motohiro and his staff were {{surprised}} with Gen Urobuchi's contribution to the highly acclaimed anime series, Puella Magi Madoka Magica. Motohiro was fascinated by Madoka Magica; he read other works from Urobuchi, which persuaded him to talk to Urobuchi. In early 2011, Motohiro proposed to Urobuchi that the pair should work together. Early {{in the making of}} the series, Motohiro told Naoyoshi Shiotani not to make <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> not be adapted into a live-action film.|$|E
5|$|The city faced {{attacks from}} Arab nomads from the Banu Hilal tribe. In 1057 the Zirids {{abandoned}} it for el-Mahdia, {{and it was}} never occupied again. Its building materials were later used by the inhabitants of Kairouan. As of 2009 {{the site of the}} city was a wasteland, crossed by many ditches, surrounded by the homes of poor people. <b>Anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> be reused for construction or other purposes has been scavenged during the centuries since it was abandoned. Stones, bricks, glass and metal were all removed. Little survived except fragments of unusable stucco.|$|E
5|$|If the German {{air force}} had prevailed and {{attempted}} a landing, a much-reduced Royal Air Force {{would have been}} obliged to operate from airfields {{well away from the}} southeast of England. Any airfield that was in danger of being captured would have been made inoperable and there were plans to remove all portable equipment from vulnerable radar bases and completely destroy <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> not be moved. Whatever was left of the RAF would have been committed to intercepting the invasion fleet in concert with the Royal Navy—to fly in the presence of an enemy that enjoys air superiority is very dangerous. However, the RAF would have kept several advantages, such as being able to operate largely over friendly territory, as well as having the ability to fly for longer as, until the Germans were able to operate from airfields in England, Luftwaffe pilots would still have to fly significant distances to reach their operational area.|$|E

5|$|Upon investigation, {{the crew}} find that Worf's RNA has an unusual quantum {{signature}} and confirm {{that he is}} from a different universe. The crew theorizes that Worf, on his original return from the bat'leth tournament, passed through a time-space fissure, with the shuttlecraft's engines causing Worf to quantum flux between several parallel universes. Data determines that Worf's proximity to La Forge's VISOR caused Worf to shift between universes, and that each universe covers a different possibility. In effect, <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> possibly happen has done so in a parallel universe, hence the believable changes in the reality that Worf is experiencing. The Enterprise returns {{to the location of}} the fissure, attempting to return Worf to his original universe. The Enterprise is then attacked by a Bajoran ship, which causes the fissure to destabilize and the various realities to merge, resulting in over 285,000 versions of the Enterprise appearing in the same area of space.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Władysław still {{tried to}} take {{a leading role in}} European politics, and {{negotiate}} a peaceful settlement to the Thirty Years' War, a settlement which he hoped would ease his way into regaining the Swedish crown. Following the armistice of Stuhmsdorf, Władysław came to increasingly realize that his prospects for regaining the Swedish throne were dim. In the years 1636–1638 he proposed several reforms to strengthen his and his dynasty's power in the Commonwealth. His first plan was an attempt to secure a hereditary province within the country, which would not be threatened by the possible power shift following a future royal election; this, however, did not gain sufficient support in the Sejm. Next, Władysław attempted to create an order of chivalry, similar to the Order of the Golden Fleece, but this plan was scuttled down as well, with the szlachta and the magnates seeing this as an attempt to create a royal, loyalist elite, and traditionally opposing <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> lead to the reduction of their extensive power. Popular vote and opposition also resulted in the failure of the plan to raise taxes from trade tariffs; here it was not only the nobility but even the merchants and burghers from towns, like Gdańsk (Danzig) who were able to muster enough support (including from foreign powers) to stop the king's reforms. In fact, the defeat of his plans was so total, that he was forced to make certain conciliatory gestures to the nobility, as the Sejm passed several laws constraining his authority (such as to hire foreign troops), further indicating the limits of royal power in the Commonwealth.|$|E
25|$|Vietnamese pilots now began flying {{themselves}} and their families out of the country in <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> get off the ground. Some headed for the American rescue fleet just off the coast, while others flew to Thailand.|$|E

25|$|Cook's general {{approach}} was essentially empirical, encouraging as broad a diet as circumstances permitted, and collecting such greens {{as could be}} had when making landfall. All onboard ate the same food, with Cook specifically dividing equally <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> be divided (and indeed recommending that practice to any commander – journal 4 August 1770).|$|E
25|$|A {{probe into}} the {{encounter}} was ordered after Ishrat Jahan's family {{insisted that she}} was innocent, and the Mumbai police said she had no criminal background, and their investigation did not find <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> implicate her. A number of politicians and the Maharashtra State Minorities Commission demanded an inquiry. Ishrat's funeral procession was attended by over 10,000 people in Mumbra and the Samajwadi Party state president Abu Azmi {{said that he would}} demand a CBI probe into the killings.|$|E
25|$|Police {{took the}} only {{survivor}} at the address, the property's caretaker William Garretson, in for questioning. Garretson {{lived in the}} guest house that was located on the property, but {{a short distance from}} the house, and not immediately visible. As the first suspect, Garretson was questioned and submitted to a polygraph test. Garretson stated that Parent had visited him at approximately 11:30p.m. and left shortly thereafter. Garretson informed police that he had no involvement in the murders and did not know <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> help the investigation. Police accepted his explanation and he was released.|$|E
60|$|He, too, had {{realized}} that his opponent's force was above <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> he <b>could</b> have expected, fencing-master though he might be, and on that account he had put forth his utmost energy to make an end at once.|$|R
60|$|I was too paralysed by the unexpectedness of {{the attack}} to form any plan; and, indeed, I do not think <b>that</b> there was <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> I <b>could</b> have done. I was unarmed and helpless. I stood there, waiting for the inevitable.|$|R
60|$|Following this {{there was}} some talk which neither of those outside the door could catch. Then came a rather loud exclamation from Ward Porton which startled our friends more than <b>anything</b> else <b>that</b> <b>could</b> have been said.|$|R
25|$|Proponents of this {{position}} {{argue that the}} devastation from firebombing was greater than <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> be justified by military necessity alone, and this establishes a prima facie case. The Allies {{were aware of the}} effects of firebombing, as British cities had been subject to them during the Blitz. Proponents disagree that Dresden had a military garrison and claim that most of the industry was in the outskirts and not in the targeted city centre, and that the cultural significance of the city should have precluded the Allies from bombing it.|$|E
25|$|Operation Banquet was a British plan to {{use every}} {{available}} aircraft to repel a threatened German invasion in 1940 or 1941. During the Second World War, in May 1940, the Air Ministry realised that beyond the normal reserves of the Royal Air Force (RAF), {{it may be necessary}} to throw everything into a last-ditch battle for British liberty. To this end, the Air Ministry planned to use just about <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> fly. On 17 May 1940, an Air Ministry meeting outlined a series of ambitious plans to make use of various aircraft in the event of an invasion.|$|E
25|$|President Bush {{wrote in}} his memoirs that Olmert had first asked him to bomb the facility, but ordered the attack after Bush refused {{and told him that}} he would prefer {{diplomatic}} action and sanctions. Following the strike, Bush claimed to have suggested to Olmert to hide the strike {{for a while and then}} make it public as a way to isolate the Syrian government, but Olmert asked for total secrecy, wanting to avoid <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> force Syria to retaliate. However, Israeli columnist Caroline Glick wrote that Israel had bowed to US demands in concealing the airstrike.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} the war, Soviet Red Army forces {{launched}} Operation August Storm, which captured Manchuria {{from the}} Japanese. The Soviets looted the ruins of Shōwa Steel Works for <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> be taken back to the Soviet Union. With the defeat of Japan in 1945, Anshan was returned to China {{along with the rest of}} Chinese Manchuria. However, peace had not yet arrived. Civil war continued between the Chinese Nationalist Government and the Communist People's Liberation Army (PLA). The city of Anshan was the scene of one of the battles of this war. The city was taken by the PLA on February 19, 1948. A monument in Lieshishan park commemorates the battle.|$|E
25|$|In 1947, Dayan was {{appointed}} to the Haganah General Staff working on Arab affairs, in particular recruiting agents to gain information about irregular Arab forces in Palestine. On 14 April 1948, his brother, Zorik, was killed in fighting. On 22 April, Dayan was put in charge of abandoned Arab property in newly conquered Haifa. To put a stop to the out-of-control looting, he ordered that <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> be used by the army be stored in Haganah warehouses and the rest be distributed amongst Jewish agricultural settlements. On 18 May, Dayan was given command of the Jordan Valley sector. In a nine-hour battle, his troops stopped the Syrian advance south of the Sea of Galilee.|$|E
25|$|In {{the third}} season the Dr. Weird {{openings}} were replaced with segments {{from the pilot}} episode of Spacecataz, an unaired spin-off created by Willis and Maiellaro. Six episodes were planned for production, but Adult Swim {{felt that there was}} little, if <b>anything,</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> be made into five more episodes, since all of the characters were destroyed {{at the end of the}} pilot, despite the parent series being predominantly non-canon. These segments featured the Mooninites and Plutonians trading insults, gestures, and practical jokes. The full Spacecataz pilot is available as a special feature on the Volume Four DVD box-set. The Mooninites appear to outsmart the Plutonians for much of the series including tagging the Plutonians' ship and reversing a prank that involved 50 million large pizzas.|$|E
30|$|The {{participants}} were asked non-personally identifiable information including age; their gender; whether they live alone and if they live alone.
