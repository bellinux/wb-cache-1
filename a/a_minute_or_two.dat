Claiborne said Clanton was supported by a window initially after he was shot, and fired some shots after sitting, with the pistol supported on his leg. After he ran out of ammunition, he called for more cartridges, but C. S. Fly took his pistol at about the time the general shooting ended.|$|E
5|$|When {{ready to}} emerge, several {{different}} strategies are used. In some species, {{the transformation of}} the nymph occurs underwater and the subimago swims to the surface and launches itself into the air. In other species, the nymph rises to the surface, bursts out of its skin, remains quiescent for <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> resting on the exuviae (cast skin) and then flies upwards, and in some, the nymph climbs out of the water before transforming.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} {{narcosis}} {{is related to}} the increased solubility of gases in body tissues, {{as a result of the}} elevated pressures at depth (Henry's law). Modern theories have suggested that inert gases dissolving in the lipid bilayer of cell membranes cause narcosis. More recently, researchers have been looking at neurotransmitter receptor protein mechanisms as a possible cause of narcosis. The breathing gas mix entering the diver's lungs will have the same pressure as the surrounding water, known as the ambient pressure. After any change of depth, the pressure of gases in the blood passing through the brain catches up with ambient pressure within <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> <b>two,</b> which results in a delayed narcotic effect after descending to a new depth. Rapid compression potentiates narcosis owing to carbon dioxide retention.|$|E

5|$|As {{in falls}} one and two, Guerrero and Hijo del Santo started out against each other. At one point, Guerrero applied Hijo del Santo's own {{submission}} hold, La de a Caballo (camel clutch), {{on him to}} mock his opponent, but {{was not able to}} make Hijo del Santo submit before Octagón saved his partner. Later in the fall, with the referee distracted, Barr was able to surprise Octagón and execute a kneeling reverse piledriver, a move that would have been an automatic disqualification in Lucha Libre. Moments later, Barr was able to pin Octagón to eliminate him from the match. In Lucha Libre, the piledriver is treated as a very dangerous move, something that was sold during this match by Octagón being taken from the arena on a stretcher during the closing moments of the third fall. Minutes later, Hijo del Santo was actually able to kick out of the Superplex/Frog Splash combo by La Pareja del Terror. At one point, both Hijo del Santo and Guerrero were on the floor, which distracted the referee long enough for Blue Panther to enter the ring and perform a piledriver of his own on Barr in retaliation for what was done to Octagón. The move was not seen by the referee but allowed Hijo del Santo to pin Barr, leaving just Hijo del Santo and Guerrero still in the match. <b>A</b> <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> later, Hijo del Santo was able to roll up Guerrero for the final pinfall and the victory for his team. Following their loss, both Guerrero and Barr visibly cried in the ring, selling the severeness of the loss as they cut off each other's hair with a pair of scissors. This was followed by an AAA official shaving off the rest of their hair with electric clippers backstage.|$|E

Then he roused the crew, and in less than two hours afterwards they rowed alongside the Serpent. The captain was greatly pleased with Mr. Ferguson's report.|$|R
60|$|Then, from housetop and loophole, {{and from}} the walls on either side, a {{concentrated}} fire of musketry was poured upon them, while twelve guns, four on each barricade, swept them with grape.

25|$|Immediately after birth, a newborn's skin {{is often}} grayish to dusky blue in color. As {{soon as the}} newborn begins to breathe, usually within <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> <b>two,</b> the skin's color reaches its normal tone. Newborns are wet, covered in streaks of blood, and coated with a white {{substance}} known as vernix caseosa, which is hypothesised {{to act as an}} antibacterial barrier. The newborn may also have Mongolian spots, various other birthmarks, or peeling skin, particularly on the wrists, hands, ankles, and feet.|$|E
25|$|They feed in {{the mornings}} and evenings. They use their semi-prehensile lips to grasp grass stems, bend the stem down, bite off the top, and then eat the grass. They tackle very tall grasses or saplings by walking over the plant, with legs {{on both sides and}} using the weight of their bodies to push the end of the plant down {{to the level of the}} mouth. Mothers also use this {{technique}} to make food edible for their calves. They drink for <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> at a time, often imbibing water filled with rhinoceros urine.|$|E
25|$|The {{police and}} the gang fired {{at each other for}} about a quarter of an hour. Then there was a lull but nothing could be seen for <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> because of the smoke. Superintendent Hare {{returned}} to the railway-station with a shattered left wrist from one of the first shots fired. He bled profusely, but Tom Carrington, artist for the Australasian Sketcher, stopped the haemorrhage with his handkerchief. Hare then ordered O'Connor to surround the hotel, and later attempted to return to the battle but gradually lost so much blood that he had to be conveyed to Benalla by a special railway engine.|$|E

[...] He was to live within <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> <b>two's</b> walk of this all his life, and to be buried in the Ognissanti ("All Saints") parish church. [...] His father was Mariano di Vanni d'Amedeo Filipepi, and Sandro was the {{youngest}} of his four children to survive into adulthood, all boys. [...] The date of his birth is not known, but his father's tax returns in following years give his age as two in 1447 and thirteen in 1458 so, allowing for arguments as to what these statements really meant, dates between 1444 and 1446 are given.|$|R

25|$|An {{indirect}} {{public health}} problem posed by cigarettes is that of accidental fires, usually linked with consumption of alcohol. Enhanced combustion using nitrates was traditionally used but cigarette manufacturers have been silent on this subject claiming at first that a safe cigarette was technically impossible, then that {{it could only be}} achieved by modifying the paper. Roll your own cigarettes contain no additives and are fire safe. Numerous fire safe cigarette designs have been proposed, some by tobacco companies themselves, which would extinguish a cigarette left unattended for more than <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> <b>two,</b> thereby reducing the risk of fire. Among American tobacco companies, some have resisted this idea, while others have embraced it. RJ Reynolds was a leader in making prototypes of these cigarettes in 1983 and will make all of their U.S. market cigarettes to be fire-safe by 2010. Phillip Morris is not in active support of it. Lorillard (purchased by RJ Reynolds), the US' 3rd-largest tobacco company, seems to be ambivalent.|$|E
25|$|As gas {{leaves the}} {{cylinder}} it decreases in {{pressure in the}} first stage, becoming very cold due to adiabatic expansion. Where the ambient water temperature is less than 5°C any water {{in contact with the}} regulator may freeze. If this ice jams the diaphragm or piston spring, preventing the valve closing, a free-flow may ensue that can empty a full cylinder within <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> <b>two,</b> and the free-flow causes further cooling in a positive feedback loop. Generally the water that freezes is in the ambient pressure chamber around a spring that keeps the valve open and not moisture in the breathing gas from the cylinder, but that is also possible if the air is not adequately filtered. The modern trend of using plastics to replace metal components in regulators encourages freezing because it insulates the inside of a cold regulator from the warmer surrounding water. Some regulators are provided with heat exchange fins in areas where cooling due to air expansion is a problem, such as around the second stage valve seat on some regulators.|$|E
500|$|Once a pair-bond {{has been}} formed, the male will make short flights at dusk around the nesting and {{roosting}} sites and then longer circuits {{to establish a}} home range. When he is later joined by the female, there is much chasing, turning and twisting in flight, and frequent screeches, the male's being high-pitched and tremulous and the female's lower and harsher. At later stages of courtship, the male emerges at dusk, climbs high into the sky and then swoops back to {{the vicinity of the}} female at speed. He then sets off to forage. The female meanwhile sits in an eminent position and preens, returning to the nest <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> before the male arrives with food for her. [...] Such feeding behaviour of the female by the male is common, helps build the pair-bond and increases the female's fitness before egg-laying commences.|$|E

Then there was <b>an</b> awkward <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> between Nora and Colonel Osborne, and he took his leave.|$|R
60|$|Then I {{continued}} my march, placing myself {{against a}} stump that {{stood at the}} other end of my walk, remaining leaning there for <b>an</b> entire <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> <b>two,</b> when I returned, passing the young men as before. This I did three several times, stopping at each turn, as if to rest or to reflect; and making each succeeding halt longer than the one that had preceded it. At length I took my stand against the very stump that concealed the Indian.|$|R
500|$|Stereogum {{journalist}} Tom Breihan described [...] "Rocket" [...] as [...] "a squelchy, Prince-ly old-school sex-ballad" [...] {{in which}} the singer seemingly [...] "melt into the track". He stated that despite [...] "nothing remotely innovative about it... I can't {{remember the last time}} I heard a ballad of this type so completely fleshed-out and fully realized". Ryan B. Patrick of Exclaim! noted that songs on the album, such as Rocket", effectively display genre diversity, Beyoncé's vocal range and [...] "a penchant of musical experimentation". Although describing it as a [...] "pitch-perfect rehash" [...] of [...] "Untitled" [...] and noting that it succeeded in turning Beyoncé's [...] "sex life into topography", Fact Chris Kelly felt [...] "Rocket" [...] was unnecessary on the album. Philip Cosores of Paste stated that the song was [...] "dragging on <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> too long". Janice Llamoca from the website HipHopDX called it suitable for a bonus track on Timberlake's The 20/20 Experience (2013). Neil McCormick, writing for The Daily Telegraph criticized the song as a [...] cut meant for The 20/20 Experience. In the annual Pazz and Jop mass critics poll of the year's best in music in 2013, [...] "Rocket" [...] was ranked at number 424.|$|E
500|$|Hardy came belowdecks to see Nelson {{just after}} half-past two, and {{informed}} him {{that a number of}} enemy ships had surrendered. Nelson told him that he was sure to die, and begged him to pass his possessions to Emma. With Nelson at this point were the chaplain Alexander Scott, the purser Walter Burke, Nelson's steward, Chevalier, and Beatty. Nelson, fearing that a gale was blowing up, instructed Hardy to be sure to anchor. After reminding him to [...] "take care of poor Lady Hamilton", Nelson said [...] "Kiss me, Hardy". Beatty recorded that Hardy knelt and kissed Nelson on the cheek. He then stood for <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> before kissing him on the forehead. Nelson asked, [...] "Who is that?", and on hearing that it was Hardy, he replied [...] "God bless you, Hardy." [...] By now very weak, Nelson continued to murmur instructions to Burke and Scott, [...] "fan, fan... rub, rub... drink, drink." [...] Beatty heard Nelson murmur, [...] "Thank God I have done my duty", and when he returned, Nelson's voice had faded and his pulse was very weak. He looked up as Beatty took his pulse, then closed his eyes. Scott, who remained by Nelson as he died, recorded his last words as [...] "God and my country". Nelson died at half-past four, three hours after he had been shot.|$|E
500|$|Eastwood {{is known}} for his {{economical}} film shoots; his regular camera operator, Steve Campanelli, indicated the rapid pace at which Eastwood films—and his intimate, near-wordless direction—also featured during Changelings shoot. Eastwood limited rehearsals and takes to garner more authentic performances. Jolie said, [...] "You've got to get your stuff together and get ready because he doesn't linger... He expects people to come prepared and get on with their work." [...] Campanelli sometimes had to tell Jolie what Eastwood wanted from a scene, as Eastwood talked too softly. To provide verisimilitude to certain scenes, Eastwood sometimes asked Jolie to play them quietly, as if just for him. At the same time he would ask his camera operator to start filming discreetly, without Jolie's seeing it. Malkovich noted Eastwood's direction as [...] "redefining economical", saying Eastwood was quiet and did not use the phrases [...] "action" [...] and [...] "cut". He said, [...] "Some —like Clint Eastwood or Woody Allen—don't really like to be tortured by a million questions. They hire you, and they figure you know what to do, and you should do it... And that's fine by me." [...] Ryan also noted the calmness of the set, observing that her experiences working with director Sidney Lumet on 100Centre Street and Before the Devil Knows You're Dead were useful due to his sharing Eastwood's preference for filming a small number of takes. Donovan said Eastwood seldom gave him direction other than to [...] "go ahead", and that Eastwood did not even comment on his decision to play Jones with a slight Irish accent: [...] "Actors are insecure and they want praise, but he's not there to praise you or make you feel better... All he's there to do is tell the story, and he hired actors to tell their story." [...] Gaffer Ross Dunkerley said he often had to work on a scene without having seen a rehearsal: [...] "Chances are we'll talk about it for <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> <b>two,</b> and then we're executing it." ...|$|E
6000|$|At Saulsby Phineas did not {{see much}} of his hostess. When they were making their plans for the one entire day of this visit, she said a soft word of apology to him.

50|$|In the United Kingdom, {{the main}} {{observance}} {{is on the}} Sunday nearest to 11 November, Remembrance Sunday with two minutes of silence observed on 11 November itself, a custom which had lapsed before a campaign for its revival began in the 1990s. Ceremonies are held at local war memorials, usually organised by local branches of the Royal British Legion, an association for ex-servicemen. Typically, poppy wreaths are laid by representatives of the Crown, the armed forces, and local civic leaders, {{as well as by}} local organisations including ex-servicemen organisations, cadet forces, the Scouts, Guides, Boys' Brigade, St John Ambulance and the Salvation Army. The start and end of the silence is often also marked by the firing of an artillery piece. <b>A</b> <b>minute's</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> minutes' silence is also frequently incorporated into church services. Further wreath-laying ceremonies are observed at most war memorials across the UK at 11 am on 11 November, led by the Royal British Legion.The beginning and end of the two minutes' silence is often marked in large towns and cities by the firing of ceremonial cannonand many employers and businesses invite their staff and customers to observe the two minutes' silence at 11:00 am.|$|R
5000|$|As he slept, Napoleon {{is said to}} {{have had}} a bad dream reliving his defeat at the Tagliamento River by the Austrians three years earlier. While he had been dreaming, Napoleon’s carriage, driven by a drunken man named César, passed the rue Saint-Nicaise and entered the rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré.
