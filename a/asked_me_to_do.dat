500|$|The revived Doctor Who {{series was}} to feature a script by Stephen Fry, {{set in the}} 1920s. Rumours {{appeared}} on the BBC's websites shortly after the airing of the new Series 1 and the story was pencilled in as the eleventh episode of Series 2. According to a video diary entry by David Tennant, Fry attended the very first cast read-through for Series 2, indicating that his script was still under consideration at that point. Due to budgetary constraints, the episode was moved to Series 3 and replaced by Fear Her. The story was subsequently abandoned, as Fry did not have spare time for the rewriting necessary to replace Rose with Martha. Fry said, [...] "They <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a series and I tried, but I just ran out of time, and so I wrote a pathetic letter of [...] "I'm sorry I can't do this" [...] to Davies." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2008, Morse portrayed George Washington in the HBO miniseries John Adams, {{for which}} {{his nose was}} made bigger. Morse commented: [...] "The first {{thing that comes to}} mind is my nose; it was my big idea to do that nose. We didn't have a lot of time, because they <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this about three weeks before they started shooting, and I just kept looking at these portraits and {{thinking}} 'this man's face is so commanding'. And I did not feel that my face was very commanding in the way his was. So I convinced them that we should try the nose, and we tried it on, and everybody went 'wow, that's Washington'." [...] Morse's portrayal earned him his second Emmy Award nomination. He is currently reprising the role of Washington in voice form as part of The Hall of Presidents show in Walt Disney World Resort's Magic Kingdom.|$|E
500|$|The {{story of}} a [...] "ménage à trois" [...] between Mrs Arbuthnot, her husband Charles, and Wellington, widely speculated upon, has been {{rejected}} by some biographers. However, {{it has been said}} that the unhappily married Duke enjoyed his relationship with Mrs Arbuthnot because he found in her company [...] "the comfort and happiness his wife could not give him." [...] Arbuthnot was certainly the Duke's confidante in all matters, especially that of his marriage. He confided to her that he only married his wife because [...] "they <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it" [...] and that he was [...] "not the least in love with her." [...] In fact, Wellington had not seen his wife for ten years before their wedding day. Following the marriage, the bride and groom found they had little if anything in common. Despite producing two sons, they led mostly separate lives until the death of the Duchess of Wellington in 1831. Harriet had a rather poor opinion of the Duchess ("she is such a fool"), although she disagreed with Wellington when he said that his wife cared nothing for his comfort: in Harriet's view the Duchess longed to make her husband happy, but had no idea how to go about the task.|$|E

60|$|Oh, my dear, don't <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that. You {{know how}} I hate refusing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{anything}} you wish.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do," [...] {{said the}} girl, looking up anxiously, a slight blush suffusing her face; the truth-telling sign of ingenuous feelings, and the gage of virtue; [...] "do, for I'm dying to hear it; as I know {{beforehand}} I shall do {{just what you}} <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> I don't know how it is, but when father or mother <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a thing, I sometimes feel as if I couldn't; but I don't feel so now, at all." ...|$|R
2500|$|Smith also {{painted a}} {{portrait}} of {{each member of the}} band. [...] "Our Lady Peace <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> paintings of each band member. I wanted them to be inward, reflective, powerful and multilayered.|$|E
2500|$|... "When they <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it {{a second}} time, I said, 'Certainly,' and {{everybody}} thought I {{was out of my}} mind," [...] Burr told Tom Shales of The Washington Post. [...] "But it wasn't the large sum of money. It was the fact that, first of all, I kind of liked 'Godzilla,' and where do you get the opportunity to play yourself 30 years later? So I said yes to both of them." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Dark Horizons, Yates said that [...] "I was still working on Order of the Phoenix when they <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> Half-Blood Prince. So they were really delighted with the material that they were seeing {{while we were in}} post-production, and the conversations happened before the movie was released, because I had to start pre-production on it while Order of the Phoenix was being promoted. It was just something they see in the work that they really liked, and responded to." [...] Yates described Half-Blood Prince as being [...] "a cross between the chills of Prisoner of Azkaban and the fantastical adventure of Goblet of Fire." ...|$|E

6000|$|Jolyon started. 'I?' he thought. 'Oh! Ah! Now she's going <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something. We take it out, we Forsytes, each in our {{different}} ways.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know it is}} better, uncle, ever so much better--but it {{is horrible}} all the same. Anyhow, don't <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it, for I could not." ...|$|R
2500|$|One day he <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> his portrait. I {{agreed with}} joy, {{all the more}} so because his head and his whole {{personality}} [...] {{seemed to me to be}} perfect models for emphasising the plastic elements I was trying to develop. His face with clearly demarcated surfaces that made up a passionate interplay of facets, his hair in dark masses projecting lightly in waves over his temples, his solidly constructed body - straightaway suggested to me equivalences, echoes , interpenetrations, rhythmic correspondences with the surrounding elements, fields, trees, houses. So I suggested painting him in my garden, where I found easily to hand an environment that was highly suitable for my model.|$|E
2500|$|Gooch's {{commitment}} to England cricket and {{passion for the}} game remains. When commenting on the new England coaching role he said: [...] "It {{came out of the}} blue. I met Andy at Trent Bridge when I was working for radio and I was a bit surprised when he <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it. But you spend your career trying to do your bit for England and when you're asked to help again the call of your country is special.". He has since remained as England's batting coach on a permanent basis, continuing this role for the 2010 series against Bangladesh and Pakistan, and the winter Ashes series against Australia in Australia. Double-centurion Alastair Cook (at the first test at the Gabba in Brisbane) hailed Gooch's influence on England's and his own batting prowess. Gooch subsequently has supervised England's batting (or 'run-scoring', as Ian Bell has noted Gooch refers to it) throughout their rise to number 1 in the Test cricket ICC Rankings. Prior to Gooch taking over, English batsmen had scored 6 test double-centuries in 15 years. 15 months after he became the batting coach, England had already beaten that total.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2013, CBS News {{broadcast}} a 60 Minutes {{critique of the}} doctrinal assessment, and interview of Farrell and Sartain. Sartain described his role as follows: [...] "In {{the context of the}} Church, we're always going to have the concern about being faithful to Christ. And all I can say to you [...] is I don't have any doubt about the reason why the Holy Father has <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this, which is his genuine love and concern for religious women." [...] On the other hand, Farrell noted that there is disagreement over the meaning of vows of obedience for nuns: [...] "Well I think there is one of the areas of misunderstanding and difference. Our first obedience is to God. What we obey is God and God's call to us as expressed in so many different sources, it's not just the teaching authority of the Church, although that is certainly a legitimate part of it." [...] "We have never wanted the men to tell us what to do." [...] She added that the motivation of the inquisition by men in the Vatican appeared to be motivated by their fears rather than the love and concern Sartain cited. Farrell commented: [...] "I don't know, but it feels to me like fear. What would happen if women really were given a place of equality in the Church?" [...] The Holy See says [...] "good works aren't the issue, its annual meetings" [...] are the issue. [...] "It doesn't make sense," [...] Sartain reasoned about the speakers selected by the LCWR, [...] "that a conference of Women Religious would want to give a platform to somebody who would espouse ideas antithetical to what the Church teaches." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I didn't know," [...] said Mary, {{with some}} slight offence in her tone. [...] "Why didn't you <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> them downright if you wanted?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will not}} touch your key or your money, sir. Pray don't <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it again. If you do, I must go and call your brother." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I shall keep my word to your sister," [...] he announced, [...] "in {{the spirit}} {{as well as}} the letter. It is quite useless <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> otherwise." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just consider, Alick, our {{own house}} is uninhabitable, {{and this one}} on our hands--my aunt coming <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in a month's time. You don't <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> what is reasonable." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You are not {{far from}} the bell. Ring it. Do what you <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Call in the whole household, and ask them which of us is mad--you or I." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{told you}} what I did with them. I wouldn't have touched the letters, only Filbury <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the favor. If they {{are not on the}} table maybe the wind swept them to the floor. Did you look?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I take it kind on {{your part}} that you <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> anythink, after your up and telling Mr. Wickens that I am the last person in Lyvern you would trust with a job." ...|$|R
