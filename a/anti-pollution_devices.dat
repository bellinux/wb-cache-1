But because Ameren was in financial difficulty, it sought and received a waiver {{from the state of}} Illinois granting it a five-year delay. Ameren sought to transfer this delay to Dynegy, so that Dynegy would not have to immediately install the devices until 2020, either. But the Illinois Pollution Control Board denied Ameren's request. Dynegy filed its own request for a five-year waiver in July, and warned that the Ameren deal would fall apart if it did not receive the waiver. But the Sierra Club, the Environmental Law and Policy Center, and other environmental groups said Dynegy had the resources to install the equipment, and opposed a waiver. ACM Partners, a financial firm hired by the Sierra Club, also argued that Dynegy purposefully left IPH significantly underfunded and unable to tap into the parent company's resources. Dynegy disagreed, but the firm warned that if IPH went bankrupt, workers would lose pensions and local communities would have to pay for any environmental remediation. The Illinois AFL-CIO, however, supported Dynegy's request on September 16, saying that local jobs depended on the waiver. The pollution board said it would make a decision by November 2013. Foresight Energy, a major Illinois coal mining company, said it would install the $500 million <b>anti-pollution</b> <b>devices</b> for free if Dynegy agreed to sign a long-term contract to accept coal only from Foresight Energy. Dynegy declined the offer (in part because it already has long-term coal contracts), and environmental groups opposed it.|$|E

5000|$|As a {{subsidiary}} of a corporation headquartered in the USA, Opel had more reason than most European automakers to access and understand the increasingly stringent anti-pollution regulations which had effectively enforced the fitting of catalytic converters to cars sold in the USA, and now the trend was spreading across the Atlantic. By the time the Rekord E2 appeared in 1982 West Germany had already passed the law that would effectively enforce the use of catalytic converters for cars sold there, though at this stage the industry was still being given time, in West Germany, {{to prepare for the}} new laws to come into force: Switzerland and Sweden had already introduced much more stringent standards than other European nations, and catalytic converters began making inroads in the mid-80s. It was still believed that carbureter fed engines were liable to pass unburnt fuel into the exhaust chamber, with potentially damaging results for the converter, so the manufacturer chose to combine the new <b>anti-pollution</b> <b>device</b> with a potentially more precise fuel injection system. At the start of 1985 the Rekord became available in its West German home market with a third version of the 1796 cc engine, designated the [...] "1.8 i Kat". As the designation indicated, this engine came with fuel injection and a catalytic converter. A maximum 74 kW (100 PS) of power was claimed, and the performance was accordingly enhanced, but the Opel Rekord 1.8 with this engine required [...] "super" [...] grade fuel which it consumed with indelicate relish. Nevertheless, {{it was one of the}} first cars to be offered in West Germany with this level of pollution control.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to shed light on the way the legal systems of {{different}} countries can explain the discrepancies in their pollution levels. In particular, we underline the factors of capital accumulation and the financial market development, that are driven, among other things, by the various levels of protection accorded by the legal system to both shareholders and creditors. The research develops in two directions. Firstly, we supply a theoretical analysis to explain how constraints on the process of capital accruement affect the pollution level. In the model, a crucial role is assigned to the rate of interest, and its relationship with discount rates, which constitutes an important variable in decisions to implement <b>anti-pollution</b> <b>devices.</b> Secondly, we perform an econometric analysis using the data of eighty-five countries belonging to the legal family of civil law, for the period from 1992 to 2003, adopting four pollution indicators as dependent variables. Our main findings are that legal families and financial market development can help to explain the differences in environmental indicators observed among nations.
