25|$|Rickman {{used this}} {{knowledge}} of Snape's ultimate loyalties throughout the films {{to decide how}} to play certain scenes, deliver specific lines, or use body language to convey specific emotions. When the directors of the films would <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>why</b> he was doing a scene a certain way or delivering a line in a specific manner, Rickman would simply reply that he knew something they didn't.|$|E
500|$|In a {{scene in}} the episode, Comic Book Guy announces that Springfield is in 299th place {{on a list of}} the United States' 300 most livable cities, with East St. Louis being in last place. A {{journalist}} for a [...] "local East St. Louis paper" [...] noticed this, and called Selman to <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>why</b> they were [...] "taking a shot at East St. Louis". Selman jokingly replied: [...] "because it's a crack-ridden slum". After the interview, he went on vacation in Greece for two weeks. While Selman was on vacation, executive producer and the episode's showrunner Mike Scully {{received a phone call from}} The Simpsons publicist Antonia Coffman, who reported that Selman's comment on East St. Louis had been taken [...] "very seriously" [...] by the newspaper. The Simpsons staff received several angry letters from East St. Louis' residents, demanding an apology. Because Selman was out of reach, the other staff members had to take care of the controversy.|$|E
2500|$|Liz is {{generally}} portrayed {{as something of}} a [...] "geek". So, while she is an apparently skilled writer, she seems to have very few social skills (in [...] "Rosemary's Baby", Jack describes her as [...] "socially retarded"). For example, while she was trying to pick up men at a karaoke bar, a man asked her if the seat next to her was taken, leading her to <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>why</b> she should have to move her coat just so he could sit there. Liz is often shown to be generally insecure and holds a strong concern for how she is perceived by others. Liz is sometimes dismissive of others, a personality flaw that can be connected to her lack of social skills. Assessing Liz's personality up to near the end of season 3, Jonah Weinerslav described her as [...] "an eternal 13-year-old tomboy—scared of sex, obsessed with Star Wars and meatball subs" [...] and as [...] "cling to a fantasy of presexual, junk-food-munching adolescence".|$|E
6000|$|We <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>why,</b> {{but he said}} it was no matter. We <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>why,</b> once or twice, as {{we walked}} back to the camp but he still said it was no matter. But late at night, when he was sitting in a {{thoughtful}} mood on the bed, we <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> again and he said: ...|$|R

60|$|The reins were tightened. The pace lessened {{and at last}} fell to a walk. Conscious of her {{telltale}} {{eyes and}} troubled face, she dared not turn to her companion to <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>why,</b> but glanced across the fields.|$|E
6000|$|... "Untrustworthy in one thing, untrustworthy in all," [...] said Aunty Rosa, and Harry {{felt that}} Black Sheep was {{delivered}} into his hands. He would {{wake him up}} in the night to <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>why</b> he was such a liar.|$|E
5000|$|I <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>why</b> he wouldn't play my records. He said, [...] "Because {{some of our}} {{listeners}} are offended." ...|$|R

50|$|During the trial, {{prosecutors}} presented key evidence: a 2005 police-sting {{telephone call}} {{recorded by the}} Leesburg police without Bevel's knowledge. During that 90-minute call, Bevel's daughter <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>why</b> {{he had sex with}} her the one time in 1993, and she <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>why</b> he wanted her to use a vaginal douche afterward. Bevel said that he had no interest in getting her pregnant. At trial, Bevel denied committing the sexual act and his recorded statement was used against him.|$|R
6000|$|The rabbit {{would have}} liked to <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>why</b> he ate food that he knew would burn him, only he was afraid, and just nodded in reply; but when they had gone on a little further, he said to Gudu: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Shall we {{ask your}} cousin the reason of this?" [...] said Elizabeth, still {{addressing}} Colonel Fitzwilliam. [...] "Shall we <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>why</b> {{a man of}} sense and education, and {{who has lived in}} the world, is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers?" ...|$|E
6000|$|My face {{must have}} shown him I {{believed}} him utterly; yet my hands--but {{it was for}} pure tenderness--shook him as if to <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>why,</b> if it was all for nothing, he had condemned me to months of torment. [...] "What then did you do?" ...|$|E
60|$|An Undertaker Who Was a Member of a Trust saw a Man Leaning on a Spade, and <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>why</b> {{he was not}} at work.|$|R
50|$|A {{few months}} later, Tom's {{football}} coach <b>asks</b> <b>him</b> <b>why</b> {{he changed his}} last name to Monaghan. It {{turns out that the}} coach is Tom's long-lost father.|$|R
60|$|Little Pax {{said this}} with such genuine feeling, and looked round him with such obvious interest, that Aspel, with some surprise, <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>why</b> he liked it.|$|R
60|$|Of {{course she}} did not <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>why.</b> Their talk was like the {{starting}} of a heavy train--a series of jerks; and yet both were aware of an irresistible forward traction. She had not recovered from her surprise in finding herself already so far in his confidence.|$|E
6000|$|... "Whatever {{it means}} I don't {{in the least}} mind BEING mixed. Therefore if you don't and I don't," [...] Maisie concluded, [...] "don't you think that when I see him this evening I had better just tell him we don't and <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>why</b> in the world HE should?" ...|$|E
60|$|His two adherents {{looked at}} each other, and at him, {{as if they were}} at a loss how to pursue the subject. At length Hugh, after some elbowing and winking between himself and Mr Dennis, ventured to stay his hand, and to <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>why</b> he meddled with that riband in his hat.|$|E
6000|$|Hayraddin, never {{a welcome}} sight, was odious from his late treachery, and Quentin sternly <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>why</b> he dared take {{the freedom to}} touch a Christian and a gentleman? ...|$|R

60|$|Some time passed, and {{he noticed}} how the king always went about sorrowing and grieving, {{and was never}} glad or happy. One day the king came into the stable, {{where there was no}} one present except the youth, who said {{straight}} out to him that, with his majesty's permission, he wished to <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>why</b> he was so sorrowful.|$|E
6000|$|At this {{unexpected}} conclusion a smile crossed Mr. McLean's face, but was gone in an instant. [...] "I {{wish you had}} laughed," [...] said Tommy, on the watch; [...] "once a body laughs he canna be angry no more," [...] which was pretty good even for Tommy. It made Mr. McLean <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>why</b> he was so fond of Miss Ailie.|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't understand," [...] cried Peter hurriedly. [...] "What I {{want to know}} is, {{why should}} Cresty the Flycatcher ask me to please let him know if I found any cast-off suits of the Snake family? He flew away before I could <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>why</b> he wants them, and so I came to you, because I know you know everything, {{especially}} everything concerning your neighbors." ...|$|E
50|$|Berner, in his youth, {{studied the}} piano. At a party, {{somebody}} <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>why</b> {{he did not}} play the accordion. As a result, he began learning {{how to play the}} accordion.|$|R
60|$|I <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>why</b> he {{had taken}} the human form as a model. There seemed to me then, and there still seems to me now, a strange wickedness for that choice.|$|R

60|$|Suddenly, {{he started}} from his seat, and {{thrusting}} it all crumpled into his pocket, turned furiously to Newman Noggs, {{as though to}} <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>why</b> he lingered. But Newman stood unmoved, with his back towards him, following up, with the worn and blackened stump of an old pen, some figures in an Interest-table which was pasted against the wall, and apparently quite abstracted from every other object.|$|E
60|$|Marian Lesley {{waited in}} vain for her lover that afternoon. When he came at last in the odorous dusk of the June night she met him on the acacia-shadowed {{verandah}} with cold sweetness. Perhaps some subtle woman-instinct whispered to her where and how {{he had spent the}} afternoon, for she offered him no kiss, nor did she <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>why</b> he had failed to come sooner.|$|E
6000|$|Peter Rabbit {{suddenly}} brightened up. [...] "I {{do believe}} you are right, Johnny Chuck, and if you are, {{there must be a}} story about it, {{and if there is a}} story, Grandfather Frog will be sure to know it. There he is, over on his big green lily-pad, and he looks as if he might be feeling very good-natured this morning. Let's go <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>why</b> Jerry Muskrat builds his house in the water." ...|$|E
60|$|Rollo {{himself did}} not {{understand}} it very well. Nathan <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> <b>why</b> it would not split the other way, {{and he said that}} that was across the grain. But when Nathan <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> what he meant by grain, he could not tell.|$|R
