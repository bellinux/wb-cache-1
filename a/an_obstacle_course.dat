5|$|Interested in {{the ability}} of the human body to {{withstand}} and survive pain, No forces Bond to navigate his way through <b>an</b> <b>obstacle</b> <b>course</b> constructed in the facility's ventilation system. Bond is kept under observation as he suffers electric shocks, burns and an encounter with large poisonous spiders. Bond's ordeal ends in a fight with a captive giant squid, which he defeats by using improvised weapons. After his escape he encounters Rider, who has been pegged out to be eaten by crabs; they had ignored her and she managed to escape.|$|E
5|$|Overton's first {{assignment}} {{was with the}} 31st Fighter Group at Turner Air Force Base in Albany, Georgia, commanded by David C. Schilling, and flying the F-84 Thunderjet, a fighter-bomber. Shortly after {{the beginning of this}} assignment, Overton nearly died in a training incident. On his third flight in the F-84, as he tried to set a record for completing <b>an</b> <b>obstacle</b> <b>course</b> in the shortest time, he was involved in a major crash. The crash threatened to end his career, but Schilling, determined to prevent Overton from being discharged, gave him extra assignments to keep him in the military.|$|E

5|$|On January 11, 2008, vignettes {{promoting}} Eve's debut began airing on SmackDown. She {{made her}} debut on the February 1, 2008 episode of SmackDown, interviewing former World Heavyweight Champion Batista. In early 2008, Eve {{participated in a}} contest to determine the top Diva on SmackDown, participating in a bikini contest, <b>an</b> <b>obstacle</b> <b>course,</b> and an arm wrestling competition before being eliminated. At WrestleMania XXIV, she appeared as a Lumberjill in the BunnyMania match between Maria and Ashley against Beth Phoenix and Melina. On October 26, she participated in the Halloween Costume Contest at the Cyber Sunday pay-per-view, where she was dressed as Raphael from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. On the November 3 episode of Raw, Eve made her televised in-ring debut in a 16-Diva tag team match, which her team lost.|$|E
5|$|In April 2012, it was {{announced}} that the Nickelodeon Suites Resort in Orlando would be reviving Double Dare as a nightly live stage presentation, Double Dare Live. As part of the Studio Nick feature of the hotel, shows were performed each night exclusively for the resort's guests. The show featured elements and updates from the various versions of Double Dare, including remixed music, physical challenges and <b>an</b> <b>obstacle</b> <b>course</b> similar to the TV show. Like the most recent formats of the program, eight contestants were selected to participate for the game-playing teams, while additional audience members played other physical challenges throughout the program. Previews of Double Dare Live began on May 21, 2012, with an official launch date of May 25. The production continued until Nickelodeon Suites Resort Orlando rebranded as a Holiday Inn Resort on June 1, 2016. A scaled-down version of Double Dare Live, called Double Dare Challenge, was presented at Nickelodeon Universe in Mall of America from June 13 to September 24, 2016, and ran again from June 16 to September 30, 2017.|$|E
5|$|NanaOn-Sha, {{the creators}} of PaRappa the Rapper, {{released}} Vib-Ribbon in 1999. It eschews instrument-shaped controllers; instead, players maneuver the protagonist through <b>an</b> <b>obstacle</b> <b>course</b> by pressing buttons at correct times. The game's levels are generated by the background music, which players may change by inserting audio CDs. While it was praised for its unique style and artistry, Vib-Ribbons simple vector graphics proved difficult to market, and the game was never released in North America. Sega's Samba de Amigo, released in arcades in 1999 and on the Dreamcast in 2000, features maraca-shaped, motion sensitive controllers. The game allows for two-player gameplay, provides a spectacle for onlookers and allows players to socialise while gaming. In 2000, Taiko no Tatsujin combined traditional Japanese drums with contemporary pop music, and became highly successful in Japanese arcades. The game was later released on consoles in the West as Taiko Drum Master, and the franchise continues to receive new installments in Japan. Gitaroo Man featured a guitar-playing protagonist four years before the release of Guitar Hero, though the game employed a conventional rather than guitar-shaped controller. Gitaroo Mans creator, Keiichi Yano, later created Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan, a rhythm game for the Nintendo DS that utilizes the handheld's touchscreen features. It became a highly demanded import title, {{which led to the}} release of an altered version of the game in the West—Elite Beat Agents—and a sequel in Japan.|$|E

25|$|In one {{experimental}} study, adults {{accustomed to}} wearing helmets cycled more slowly without a helmet, but {{no difference in}} helmeted and unhelmeted cycling speed was found for cyclists who do not usually wear helmets. An experimental study found that children negotiating <b>an</b> <b>obstacle</b> <b>course</b> on foot went faster and took more risks when wearing safety gear (including helmets). A telephone interview study found that in hypothetical scenarios of their children wearing protective equipment or not, parents' ratings of permissible risk for their children was higher if protective gear was hypothetically worn.|$|E
25|$|Difficulties with standing, walking, turning corners, {{climbing}} stairs, and a slowing of gait {{are experienced}} as astronauts re-adapt to Earth's gravity, until terrestrial motor strategies are fully re-acquired. Adaptation to spaceflight also induces {{a significant increase}} in the time required to traverse <b>an</b> <b>obstacle</b> <b>course</b> on landing day, and recovery of functional mobility takes an average of two weeks. These difficulties can have adverse consequences for an astronauts’ ability to stand up or escape from the vehicle during emergencies and to function effectively immediately after leaving the spacecraft after flight. Thus it is important to understand the cause of these profound impairments of posture and locomotion stability, and develop countermeasures.|$|E

500|$|Early {{into the}} game, the player learns a new ability {{known as the}} [...] "Spin" [...] technique, which has had {{appearances}} in varying forms throughout the Super Mario franchise. In Super Mario Galaxy, the [...] "spin" [...] is primarily used for melee attacks, as it can stun enemies and shatter objects, and is used to trigger special propellers called [...] "Sling Stars" [...] or [...] "Launch Stars" [...] that launch Mario across large distances through space. The [...] "spin" [...] utility is also used for climbing vines, ice skating, unscrewing bolts, and for activating several power-ups. Other Wii Remote functions are available for smaller quests, such as surfing aboard a manta ray or balancing atop a large ball and rolling it through <b>an</b> <b>obstacle</b> <b>course.</b>|$|E
500|$|Side-scrolling stages are {{generally}} presented {{as having an}} isometric perspective, while platforming stages that feature vertical progression are presented isometrically, which allows the player characters to crouch.

Other types of level include two [...] "tower climb" [...] levels, a descent to a chasm while hanging from a rope, a level with underwater sections, a maze chase riding a unicycle-style vehicle, a platforming [...] "snake maze", and a race level in which the players has to fall as quickly as possible through countless platforms to reach the bottom of a tower before an enemy does. Hidden in four of the levels are [...] "mega warp" [...] points, which, when reached, allow the players to automatically advance by two levels.|$|E
500|$|Double Dare {{has also}} been subject to parodies and spoofs in various forms. The October 1988 issue of Mad [...] has a spoof of Double Dare called [...] "Double Damp". Marc Summers and Harvey are lampooned as [...] "Muck Slummers" [...] and [...] "Hardly". The piece mocked the program's use of food products, the {{dangerous}} nature of some stunts, and the similarity to game show Beat the Clock. Both Summers and Harvey consider being parodied in Mad a high point in their careers. A 2015 episode of the truTV sketch comedy series Friends of the People titled [...] "Double Dare" [...] guest stars Marc Summers as himself, hosting [...] "banned" [...] moments from Double Dare. Sketches include a contestant exploding, and another being stuck permanently [...] inside an obstacle. [...] "March Dadness," [...] a 2012 episode of The Cleveland Show, features a flashback to a Family Double Dare-like program called Dare Squared. A young Cleveland Brown (voiced by Mike Henry) has difficulty finding an orange flag in an oversized stack of pancakes {{at the end of}} the program's obstacle course. Marc Summers voices the frustrated host. Also, in a 2017 episode of Billy on the Street, host Billy Eichner led guest Keegan-Michael Key through <b>an</b> <b>obstacle</b> <b>course</b> with gun law themes titled Super Sloppy Semi-Automatic Double Dare. Eichner has cited Double Dare as a favorite show of his.|$|E
