He was known for writing <b>about</b> <b>crime</b> and local politics, and would also take pictures to illustrate his articles. Aside from his reporting, Udin and his wife Marsiyem owned a small store which developed pictures and sold stationary; Marsiyem would usually manage the store.|$|E
5|$|Creative {{differences}} {{arising from}} his work with Douglas and the film studios, a dislike of Hollywood, and a growing concern <b>about</b> <b>crime</b> in America prompted Kubrick {{to move to the}} United Kingdom in 1961, where he spent most of the remainder of his life and career. His home at Childwickbury Manor in Hertfordshire, which he shared with his wife Christiane, became his workplace, where he did his writing, research, editing, and management of production details. This allowed him to have almost complete artistic control over his films, but with the rare advantage of having financial support from major Hollywood studios. His first British productions were two films with Peter Sellers, Lolita (1962) and Dr. Strangelove (1964).|$|E
5|$|Since the 1980s, Southeast D.C. {{has been}} synonymous with crime and violence, and {{has one of}} the highest crime rates in the District of Columbia (albeit not the highest rates in all {{categories}} of crimes). Concern <b>about</b> <b>crime</b> at the Anacostia, Congress Heights, and Southern Avenue stations has existed for many years, although statistics only partially support these concerns. Fear of crime was one of the reasons why, in 1991, Prince George's County residents fought bus route changes that would have forced riders to disembark at Anacostia Station.|$|E

5|$|Aged 76, {{he faced}} various ailments, and {{although}} exhibiting continued energy, he felt isolated and lonely. He often entertained celebrities, such as Michael Jackson, Whoopi Goldberg, and the Spice Girls, and befriended ultra-rich businessmen, like Harry Oppenheimer of Anglo-American {{as well as}} Queen Elizabeth II on her March 1995 state visit to South Africa, resulting in strong criticism from ANC anti-capitalists. Despite his opulent surroundings, Mandela lived simply, donating {{a third of his}} R 552,000 annual income to the Nelson Mandela Children's Fund, which he had founded in 1995. Although dismantling press censorship, speaking out in favour of freedom of the press, and befriending many journalists, Mandela was critical of much of the country's media, noting that it was overwhelmingly owned and run by middle-class whites and believing that it focused too heavily on scaremongering <b>about</b> <b>crime.</b>|$|E

25|$|The first {{reported}} incident of crime at the Anacostia station {{occurred during the}} station's construction. Three teenagers broke into the construction site on July 7, 1989; stole tools; and broke the glass on the cab of a crane before being arrested. Concern <b>about</b> <b>crime</b> at the station led Metro to station additional transit police officers at Anacostia station {{in the weeks after}} the station's opening, and D.C. police patrolled the station's parking garage. Fear of crime {{was one of the reasons}} why Prince George's County residents fought bus route changes in 1991 which would have forced riders to disembark at Anacostia station.|$|E
25|$|Veronica Guerin (5 July 1958 – 26 June 1996) was an Irish crime {{reporter}} who {{was murdered by}} drug lords. Born in Dublin, she was an athlete in school, and later played on the Irish national teams for both football and basketball. After studying accountancy she ran a public-relations firm for seven years, before working for Fianna Fáil and as an election agent for Seán Haughey. She became a reporter in 1990, writing for the Sunday Business Post and Sunday Tribune. In 1994 she began writing <b>about</b> <b>crime</b> for the Sunday Independent. In 1996 she was fatally shot while stopped at a traffic light. The shooting caused national outrage in Ireland. Investigation into her death led {{to a number of}} arrests and convictions.|$|E
25|$|Concerns <b>about</b> <b>crime</b> at {{the station}} {{initially}} appeared justified. The first reported crime at Anacostia station occurred on February 5, 1992, just six weeks after the station opened. A man was accosted by three teenagers at about 9:25 P.M. {{at the station}}, kidnapped at gunpoint, and forced to strip naked. The youths took clothing, a watch, and $7 from him, and were caught by police while trying to flee {{the scene of the}} crime. In its first year of operation, Anacostia tied with the Capitol Heights station for the most auto thefts (17), and accounted for 11.3 percent of all auto thefts at Metrorail stations. By 2005, large crowds of {{middle and high school students}} began congregating at the station, brawling and robbing Metro riders and creating a public safety issue. In November 2005, Metro and the District of Columbia Public Schools entered into an agreement to bus students from Anacostia High School directly to the station rather than have them walk or take Metrobus to the station. Metro Transit Police officers, some accompanied by dogs, began patrolling Anacostia station along with six other Metro stations, to increase awareness of police presences in the stations and deter crime. The police presence did not appear to help: Between 2002 and 2006, arrests of juveniles on Metro increased to 295 from 156, and warnings increased 40 percent. Nearly half the arrests occurred at just five stations: Anacostia, Fort Totten, Gallery Place-Chinatown, L'Enfant Plaza, and Minnesota Avenue. Metro even created a special unit to focus on juvenile crime on Metro, and established liaisons at all D.C. public schools to feed intelligence and information about pending problems to Metro's police division.|$|E

500|$|Concerns <b>about</b> <b>crime</b> and {{security}} was also linked to immigration, {{as the party}} particularly blamed Turks and Moroccans for various criminal activity, and sought a zero tolerance approach regarding law and order.

[...] The party was anti-Muslim and portrayed Muslims as fifth column of a cruel and expansionist religion, and after the 1990 Gulf War called on the government to introduce measures to keep Belgium from being Islamised.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to the regular 22 pages of story, each issue included extra material. Because the opening credit page was a two-page splash across the inside front cover and page one, an additional page needed to be inserted to make the story start on the recto side of the page.

500|$|The Notorious B.I.G.'s lyrics on {{the album}} were {{generally}} praised by critics. Many critics applauded his story-telling ability such as AllMusic writer Steve Huey, who stated [...] "His raps are easy to understand, but his skills are hardly lacking — he has a loose, easy flow and a talent for piling multiple rhymes {{on top of one}} another in quick succession". He also went on to mention that his lyrics are [...] "firmly rooted in reality, but play like [...] scene from a movie". Touré, writing for The New York Times, referred to The Notorious B.I.G., proclaiming that he stood out from other rappers because [...] "his lyrics mix autobiographical details <b>about</b> <b>crime</b> and violence with emotional honesty, telling how he felt while making a living as a drug dealer". The album is also noted for its dark tone and sinister sense of depression. In the original Rolling Stone review, Cheo H Coker declared that he [...] "maintains a consistent level of tension by juxtaposing emotional highs and lows".
