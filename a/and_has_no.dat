5|$|A {{neutron star}} {{is a highly}} dense remnant of a star that is {{primarily}} composed of neutrons—a particle that is found in most atomic nuclei <b>and</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> net electrical charge. The mass of a neutron star is {{in the range of}} 1.2 to 2.1 times the mass of the Sun. As a result of the collapse, a newly formed neutron star can have a very rapid rate of rotation; on the order of a hundred rotations per second.|$|E

5|$|However, not all inhibitors {{are based}} on the {{structures}} of substrates. For example, the structure of another HIV protease inhibitor tipranavir is shown on the left. This molecule is not based on a peptide <b>and</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> obvious structural similarity to a protein substrate. These non-peptide inhibitors can be more stable than inhibitors containing peptide bonds, because they will not be substrates for peptidases and {{are less likely to be}} degraded.|$|E

5|$|All {{but four}} of the streams lie within the large basin of the Columbia River, {{although}} the river itself does not flow through Idaho. Consequently, the predominant direction of the state's streamflow is northwest towards the Columbia River and its mouth at the Pacific Ocean. The only other major drainage basin in Idaho is the Great Salt Lake watershed in the state's southeastern corner, {{which is part of}} the Great Basin <b>and</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> outlet to the ocean.

5|$|Amanita ocreata {{resemble}} several edible species commonly {{consumed by}} humans, increasing {{the risk of}} accidental poisoning. Mature fruiting bodies can {{be confused with the}} edible A. velosa, A. lanei or Volvopluteus gloiocephalus, while immature specimens may be difficult to distinguish from edible Agaricus mushrooms or puffballs. Similar in toxicity to the death cap (A. phalloides) and destroying angels of Europe (A. virosa) and eastern North America (A. bisporigera), it is a potentially deadly fungus responsible for several poisonings in California. Its principal toxic constituent, α-amanitin, damages the liver and kidneys, often fatally, <b>and</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> known antidote, though silybin and N-acetylcysteine show promise. The initial symptoms are gastrointestinal and include abdominal pain, diarrhea and vomiting. These subside temporarily after 2–3days, though ongoing damage to internal organs during this time is common; symptoms of jaundice, diarrhea, delirium, seizures, and coma may follow with death from liver failure 6–16days post ingestion.|$|E
5|$|Bahá'í teachings {{state that}} God {{is too great}} for humans to fully comprehend, or to create a {{complete}} and accurate image of, by themselves. Therefore, human understanding of God is achieved through his revelations via his Manifestations. In the Bahá'í religion, God {{is often referred to}} by titles and attributes (for example, the All-Powerful, or the All-Loving), and there is a substantial emphasis on monotheism; such doctrines as the Trinity are seen as compromising, if not contradicting, the Bahá'í view that God is single <b>and</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> equal. The Bahá'í teachings state that the attributes which are applied to God are used to translate Godliness into human terms and also to help individuals concentrate on their own attributes in worshipping God to develop their potentialities on their spiritual path. According to the Bahá'í teachings the human purpose is to learn to know and love God through such methods as prayer, reflection, and being of service to others.|$|E

5|$|Harmless and docile, the thornback {{guitarfish}} can {{be readily}} approached underwater, and fares well in public aquariums. Off the United States, this ray is common and faces no substantial threats: it is only occasionally caught incidentally by commercial and recreational fishers, <b>and</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> economic value. As most of its range lies within US waters, the species has been assessed as Least Concern overall by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). However, in Mexican waters the thornback guitarfish population is small and fragmented, {{and the degree to}} which it is affected by fishing is uncertain. There, the IUCN has listed it locally under Data Deficient while noting its susceptibility to inshore lagoon fisheries and shrimp trawlers, and the urgent need for additional information to ensure its long-term regional survival.|$|E

5|$|In 2013, the {{movement}} {{began with the}} use of the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter on social media after the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of African-American teen Trayvon Martin. Black Lives Matter became nationally recognized for its street demonstrations following the 2014 deaths of two African Americans: Michael Brown, resulting in protests and unrest in Ferguson, and Eric Garner in New York City. Since the Ferguson protests, participants in {{the movement}} have demonstrated against the deaths of numerous other African Americans by police actions or while in police custody. In the summer of 2015, Black Lives Matter activists became involved in the 2016 United States presidential election. The originators of the hashtag and call to action, Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors, and Opal Tometi, expanded their project into a national network of over 30 local chapters between 2014 and 2016. The overall Black Lives Matter movement, however, is a decentralized network <b>and</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> formal hierarchy.|$|E

5|$|In February 2016, the {{conservative}} {{majority in the}} Regional Council of Réunion with president Didier Robert announced plans to transform the national park into a regional nature park. Too restrictive rules, which hindered tourism development, was cited as a motive. A regional nature park, unlike a national park, functions {{on the basis of}} mutual agreements <b>and</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> power to establish its own regulations. Park officials and opposition politicians rejected the plan, saying it would threaten the island's biodiversity, the World Heritage listing, and critical access to state funding. It would be the first case of a national park in France being downgraded. In September 2016, the national park's director, Marylène Hoarau, announced her withdrawal upon pressure from Ségolène Royal, head of the Ministry of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy. This led the park's president, Daniel Gonthier, to suspect political interference; Hoarau had criticised Robert for launching a call for proposals {{on the future of the}} park. In an interview,Robert denied involvement in Hoarau's departure and criticised the minister for her decision.|$|E
