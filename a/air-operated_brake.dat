50|$|The sets each {{consist of}} two semi-permanently {{connected}} cars mounted on three bogies. The outermost bogies are powered, with the centre bogie being articulated between both cars. The trains {{make use of}} resistive <b>braking,</b> with <b>air-operated</b> disc <b>brakes</b> for use during {{the final stages of}} deceleration. All bogies are equipped with a pair of magnetic track-brakes, which can be used to bring a train to a complete stand in as little as 150m from the maximum service speed.|$|R
5000|$|... 313s have {{rheostatic braking}} (which was {{disabled}} on London Overground) {{in addition to}} conventional three-step <b>air-operated</b> disc <b>braking.</b> During braking if wheelslide is detected by the Wheel slide protection (WSP), rheostatic braking is disabled and disc-braking only is used. Great Northern units have sanding equipment. Unlike some other DMU/EMU classes, additional brake force is not available when the emergency brake application is initiated and is the equivalent force of a step 3/full service application. WSP is still active when making an emergency application.|$|R
50|$|TMK 101 {{is a type}} of two-axle tramcar {{which was}} used in Zagreb, Croatia, from 1951 until December 2008 (last regular service). The vehicle type has now been {{withdrawn}} from regular service. Its continuous output power was 2Ã—60 kW, passenger capacity was 95 and its maximum speed was 60 km/h. The tram 101 was the first modern type of tram produced in Croatia with automatic door openers, driver's and conductor's seats, electrical, <b>air-operated</b> and mechanical <b>brakes,</b> and with a protective shield in front of the tram.|$|R
5000|$|A car {{should be}} allowed to come to a {{complete}} stop before setting the transmission into park to prevent damage. Usually, Park (P) is one of only two selections in which the car's engine can be started, the other being Neutral (N). This is typically achieved via a normally open inhibitor switch (sometimes called a [...] "neutral safety switch") wired in series with the starter motor engagement circuit, which is closed when P or N is selected, completing the circuit (when the key is turned to the start position). In many modern cars and trucks, the driver must have the foot brake applied before the transmission can be taken out of park. The Park position is omitted on buses/coaches (and some road tractors) with automatic transmission (on which a parking pawl is not practical), which must instead be placed in neutral with the <b>air-operated</b> parking <b>brakes</b> set.|$|R
5000|$|By {{the late}} 1960s, the Swindon-built Inter City DMUs {{operating}} the [...] - [...] express service were becoming unreliable. In 1970 {{the decision was}} made to replace them with locomotive-hauled carriages. So between 1971 and 1973, twenty-four Class 27s were fitted-up with dual (vacuum and air) brakes and reclassified Class 27/1, while 36 Mark 2 carriages (7 brake second opens, 22 open seconds, and 7 corridor firsts) swapped their vacuum-operated shoe <b>brakes</b> for <b>air-operated</b> disc <b>brakes</b> and were though-wired with [...] "Blue Star" [...] control cables to enable [...] "top and tail" [...] push-pull working. It was later decided that as the Mark 2 stock was dual (steam or electric) heated, to convert half the 27/1 fleet to electric train heat, by replacing the train heating boiler with a Deutz 8-cylinder, air-cooled diesel engine and alternator. The conversions were then classified as Class 27/2, and were used on one end of the train, with a 27/1 on the other.|$|R
5000|$|While {{the earlier}} Class 6E1, Series 2 to 7 {{locomotives}} {{had been built}} with a brake system which consisted of various valves connected to each other with pipes, {{commonly referred to as}} a [...] "bicycle frame" [...] brake system, the Class 6E1, Series 8 to 11 locomotives were built with an <b>air-operated</b> equipment frame <b>brake</b> system, commonly referred to as a brake rack. Since the design of the rebuilt Class 18E locomotives included the same brake rack, the rebuilding project was begun with the newer series 8 to 11 locomotives to reduce the overall cost of rebuilding.|$|R
