5|$|Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) {{interviews}} {{for a job}} in Philadelphia, where she finds her potential manager, Mark (Bob Odenkirk), is remarkably like her former Dunder Mifflin regional manager Michael Scott. While this initially amuses her, Pam gradually realizes that the prospect of working under another Michael Scott is abhorrent, and her horror increases when Mark reveals that she is interviewing for <b>a</b> <b>glorified</b> receptionist's job. During a romantic dinner, Pam finally admits to Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) that even had the prospective job and boss been perfect she would not have wanted to take it, since she does not really want to move to Philadelphia, despite Jim having started his own business there.|$|E
25|$|Spartan {{received}} a mixed reception. Although some reviewers found {{the game to}} be <b>a</b> <b>glorified</b> button-masher, and criticized the combat as repetitive, others praised the game engine and {{the scope of the}} battles.|$|E
25|$|Frederick in German memory {{became a}} great {{national}} {{hero in the}} 19th century. Many Germans {{said he was the}} greatest monarch in modern history. German historians often made him the romantic model of <b>a</b> <b>glorified</b> warrior, praising his leadership, administrative efficiency, devotion to duty and success in building up Prussia to a leading role in Europe.|$|E
50|$|We Can Report Them is Michael Brodsky's sixth novel. The novel intertwines {{death and}} creation, {{centering}} on {{the making of}} <b>a</b> commercial <b>glorifying</b> <b>a</b> serial killer's last days. Bert, the commercial's director, must also deal with two terminally ill patients, first his stepfather Albert, then his mother-in-law Joyce.|$|R

50|$|His {{works of}} the 1930s are typical for that time. The verses contain <b>a</b> <b>glorifying</b> of working enthusiasm, work slogans. In the late period Pavel was worried about moving of society to the new stages. Thinking of life tied with singing of his native land and {{thinking}} of its past took a prominent place in his literary heritage. He {{was one of the}} first to write about the beauty of the Braslaw region.|$|R
25|$|Historians {{generally}} consider Manchukuo {{a puppet}} state of Imperial Japan {{because of the}} Japanese military's strong presence and strict {{control of the government}} administration. Chinese historians generally refer to the state as 'Wei Manzhouguo' ('false state of Manchuria'). Some historians see Manchukuo as an effort at building <b>a</b> <b>glorified</b> Japanese state in mainland Asia that deteriorated due to the pressures of war.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, A Comparative History of Greece and China from Antiquity to the Present was published. The book {{is notable}} {{in that it}} homes in on the {{relationship}} between the two civilisations throughout their entire history spanning three millennia. The study raises two concepts: 1) the Greek-Chinese civilisation in a global context and 2) its political expression during the last 2500 years, that is, ecumenical empire as <b>a</b> <b>glorified</b> organisational model.|$|E
25|$|In {{his later}} years Smith also {{differed}} from traditional Protestantism in his views {{on the nature of}} God and humanity. Eventually Smith reduced the difference between God and man to one of degree. Both God and man are coeternal and uncreated. He taught that humans could progress to an exalted state in which they became coequal with a God who was material, plural, and himself <b>a</b> <b>glorified</b> man existing within time.|$|E
5000|$|Simon was {{subsequently}} tried {{three times in}} the Federal courts for the killings in Brettheim and other crimes, but, [...] "to the horror of the West German public," [...] was found not guilty. Simon died in 1961. Even in death, Simon caused some controversy, as HIAG, an organization of former Waffen-SS members, attempted to place <b>a</b> <b>glorifying</b> obituary for him in the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine. To HIAG's indignation, the newspaper refused to run the obituary.|$|R
5000|$|Bare feet {{have come}} to symbolize innocence or {{childhood}} in <b>a</b> <b>glorifying</b> perception of freedom from real-life requirements. The connection to childhood and innocence, {{as well as the}} simple joys of country life, are embodied in the poem [...] "The Barefoot Boy" [...] by John Greenleaf Whittier, published in 1855. Additionally, the book Dancing Barefoot by Star Trek: The Next Generation actor Wil Wheaton features five short stories that chronicle his journey from childhood and youth through to maturity and self-acceptance.|$|R

25|$|Tomkinson dispatches {{a common}} atheist objection. He agrees {{it is common}} sense that {{everything}} which has a beginning {{is likely to have}} an end, too. But it does not follow from this that humans are merely transient beings. Adam was formed from earth and water, 'elements' which the Muggletonians say have existed for all eternity. Thus, humans will be capable of being resurrected as bodies in <b>a</b> <b>glorified</b> condition at world's end. Then, each will have a full understanding of paradise which can only be partially glimpsed now as inner peace and bliss.|$|E
25|$|Catholic Christians {{teach that}} there is a supernatural realm called Purgatory where souls who have died in a state of grace but have yet to expiate venial sins or {{temporal}} punishments due to past sins are cleansed before they are admitted into Heaven. The Catholic Church also professes a belief in the resurrection of the body. It is believed that, before the Final Judgement, the souls of all who have ever lived will be reunited with their resurrected body. In the case of the righteous, this will result in <b>a</b> <b>glorified</b> body which can reside in Heaven. The damned, too, shall reunite body and soul, but shall remain eternally in Hell.|$|E
25|$|Afrocentrism {{can be seen}} as an African-American-inspired {{ideology}} that manifests an affirmation of themselves in a Eurocentric-dominated society, commonly by conceptualizing <b>a</b> <b>glorified</b> heritage in terms of distinctly African, foreign origins (where foreign is anything not indigenous to the African continent). It often denies or minimizes European, Near Eastern and Asian cultural influences while accenting historical African civilizations that independently accomplished a significant level of cultural and technological development. In general, Afrocentrism is usually manifested in a focus on African-American culture and the history of Africa. It involves an African diaspora version of an African-centered view of history and culture to portray the achievements and development of Africans who have been marginalized.|$|E
50|$|It {{is unclear}} whether the Column was meant to serve a {{commemorative}} function or as a propaganda piece. Traditional scholarship held that the Column was <b>a</b> <b>glorifying</b> monument, upholding Trajan as Rome's great emperor. However, recent reconstructions of Trajan's Forum have determined that any wide view of the Column would have been mostly obstructed by two libraries in the Forum which tightly bookended it. Also, {{because it would have}} been difficult to follow the spiral frieze from end to end (walking in circles with head inclined), the Column's narrative power would have been fairly limited.|$|R

500|$|Douglas {{arrived in}} South Florida when fewer than 5,000people were {{recorded}} on the census in Miami {{and it was}} [...] "no more than <b>a</b> <b>glorified</b> railroad terminal". Her father, Frank Stoneman, was the first publisher of the paper that later became The Miami Herald. Stoneman passionately opposed the governor of Florida, Napoleon Bonaparte Broward, and his attempts to drain the Everglades. He infuriated Broward so much that when Stoneman won an election for circuit judge, Governor Broward refused to validate the election, so Stoneman {{was referred to as}} [...] "Judge" [...] {{for the rest of his}} life without performing the duties of one.|$|E
500|$|... "Forgive Me" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. The BBC {{review of the}} single called [...] "Forgive Me" [...] a [...] "danceable funky pop song". Gavin Martin of The Mirror said, [...] " [...] showcases her voice of fire and honey. No apologies necessary". Nick Levine, Digital Spy music critic, gave the song three out of five stars, comparing it with Whitney Houston's song [...] "I'm Your Baby Tonight" [...] saying that after her previous three ballad singles, [...] "it's a nice change". However, he also said, [...] "the adultery-themed lyrics are a poor match for the sweet, unassuming Hackney girl". Chad Grischow noted that with the song Lewis [...] "will not go down as <b>a</b> <b>glorified</b> one-hit wonder". Stephen Thomas Erlewine described [...] "Forgive Me", and another song ("Misses Glass") from the album as [...] "just slightly glitzier {{than the rest of}} Spirit." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called the single 'bouncy and youthful'. The New York Times criticised Lewis for being [...] "a second-tier Mariah" [...] on the song.|$|E
500|$|In 1961, HIAG {{attempted}} to place <b>a</b> <b>glorifying</b> obituary of Max Simon, a former Gruppenführer in the SS, in the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine. Simon {{had been convicted}} as a war criminal and sentenced to life imprisonment by the Allied courts {{for his role in}} the Marzabotto massacre, but was pardoned in 1954. He was subsequently tried twice in the Federal courts for the killings in Brettheim and other crimes, but, [...] "to the horror of the West German public", as Frankfurter Allgemeine wrote in 2010, was found not guilty.

40|$|Like Palestinian martyrdom videos, gonzo “shorts” {{are in a}} sense celebratory, but {{the object}} of celebration isn’t a human life and its passage into paradise; it is a human death or several human deaths. There is an overtly sadistic element to these videos, <b>a</b> <b>glorifying</b> of {{destruction}} for its own sake. In some, {{you can hear the}} enraptured voice of the faceless cameraman, much like in point-of-view gonzo porn movies before and after the finale. These videos are designed to inspire both jihadist foot-soldiers and potential recruits. Much like porn, they also appear tailored to a mass audience with a limited attention span...|$|R

500|$|... 1602 {{received}} mixed praised {{upon its}} release with Comics Bulletin stating [...] "Is 1602 good? Yes, it's damn good. Is it revolutionary or even ground breaking? No. Sorry, but I can't {{go so far}} as to call <b>a</b> <b>glorified</b> What If? series anything more than what it is; a well done re-imagination of the Marvel Universe." [...] Entertainment Weekly declared that the combination of writing and moody artwork meant [...] "the Marvel Universe hasn't been this engrossing in ages." [...] ShakingThrough.net noted that fans looking for elements of Gaiman's The Sandman would be disappointed; [...] "It's not a senses-shattering Marvel epic, but then it's not meant to be. It's nothing more or less than a chance to enjoy reinterpretations of some familiar characters." [...] UGO Networks concurred, stating [...] "there doesn't need to be a 'point' in re-imagining familiar icons — it's simply meant to be fun. [...] The result of 1602 is agreeable entertainment." [...] The series won several awards, including the Quill Book Award for Graphic Novels. The first issue was also awarded the 2003 Diamond Distributors Gem Award as [...] "Comic of the Year".|$|E
500|$|The Great Gatsby {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from literary {{critics of the}} day. Generally the most effusive of the positive reviews was Edwin Clark of The New York Times, who felt the novel was [...] "A curious book, a mystical, glamourous [...] story of today." [...] Similarly, Lillian C. Ford of the Los Angeles Times wrote, [...] " [...] leaves the reader in a mood of chastened wonder," [...] calling the book [...] "a revelation of life" [...] and [...] "a work of art." [...] The New York Post called the book [...] "fascinating... His style fairly scintillates, and with a genuine brilliance; he writes surely and soundly." [...] The New York Herald Tribune was unimpressed, but referred to The Great Gatsby as [...] "purely ephemeral phenomenon, but it contains some of the nicest little touches of contemporary observation you could imagine-so light, so delicate, so sharp.... a literary lemon meringue." [...] In The Chicago Daily Tribune, H.L. Mencken called the book [...] "in form no more than <b>a</b> <b>glorified</b> anecdote, and not too probable at that," [...] while praising the book's [...] "careful and brilliant finish." ...|$|E
500|$|The game {{combines}} several Aztec {{beliefs of}} the afterlife and underworld with 1930s Art Deco design motifs and a dark plot reminiscent of the film noir genre. The Aztec motifs of the game were influenced by Schafer's decade-long fascination with folklore, stemming from an anthropology class he took at University of California Berkeley, and talks with folklorist Alan Dundes, with Schafer recognizing that the four-year journey of the soul in the afterlife would {{set the stage for}} an adventure game. Schafer stated that once he had set on the Afterlife setting: [...] "Then I thought, what role would a person want to play in a Day of the Dead scenario? You'd want to be the grim reaper himself. That's how Manny got his job. Then I imagined him picking up people {{in the land of the}} living and bringing them to the land of the dead, like he's really just <b>a</b> <b>glorified</b> limo or taxi driver. So the idea came of Manny having this really mundane job that looks glamorous because he has the robe and the scythe, but really, he's just punching the clock." [...] Schafer recounted a Mexican folklore about how the dead were buried with two bags of gold to be used in the afterlife, one on their chest and one hidden in their coffin, such that if the spirits in the afterlife stole the one on the chest, they would still have the hidden bag of gold; this idea of a criminal element in the afterlife led to the idea of a crime-ridden, film noir style to the world, triggered too many ideas that they had to then trim down. The division of the game into four years was a way of breaking the game's overall puzzle into four discrete sections. Each year was divided into several non-linear branches of puzzles that all had to be solved before the player could progress to the next year.|$|E

50|$|Subtitled Musical {{setting for}} a civic social war drama, it was {{conceived}} as a homage to the Republican effort in the Spanish Civil War {{after the war ended}} with the victory of the National faction and the establishment of a repressive dictatorship, and marked the composer's creative retirement for four decades. It was written in Viascón, a hamlet in Pontevedra where Fernández Blanco, a Republican cultural officer during the war, hid from reprisals. The work consists of three episodes titled Desolation, Action and Hommage to the heroes, respectively a gloomy introduction, a frantic ostinato march and <b>a</b> <b>glorifying</b> hymn including quotations from The Internationale and Whirlwinds of Danger.|$|R
