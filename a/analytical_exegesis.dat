The most important Northern Song scholars were the Xú brothers, Xú Xuàn (徐鉉, 916–991) and Xú Kǎi (徐鍇, 920–974). In 986, Emperor Taizong of Song ordered Xú Xuàn and other editors to publish an authoritative {{edition of the}} dictionary. Xu Xuan's textual criticism has been especially vital for all subsequent scholarship, since his restoration of {{the damage done by}} Lǐ Yángbīng resulted in the closest version we have to the original, and the basis for all later editions. Xu Kai, in turn, focused on exegetical study, analyzing the meaning of Xu Shen's text, appending supplemental characters, and adding fǎnqiè pronunciation glosses for each entry. Among Qing Shuowen scholars, some like Zhū Jùnshēng (朱駿聲, 1788–1858), followed the textual criticism model of Xu Xuan, while others like Guì Fù (桂馥, 1736–1805) and Wáng Yún (王筠, 1784–1834) followed the <b>analytical</b> <b>exegesis</b> model of Xu Kai. One Qing scholar, Duan Yucai, stands above all the others due to the quality of his research in both areas. His annotated Shuowen edition is the one most commonly used by students today.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{motivated}} by the empowering experience {{of one of the}} authors in a madrasah (private Islamic secondary school) setting where translanguaging was applied as a teaching and learning tool during <b>analytical</b> <b>exegesis</b> of historical sources. This positive experience subsequently provided the stimuli for the authors to explore the wider mainstream potential of translanguaging as a strategy to engage and extend bilingual and multilingual learners. This case study aims to investigate how multilingual competencies in a madrasah in Tower Hamlets, an east London borough, are utilised through translanguaging to teach the core content of the curriculum. Research has demonstrated the positive impacts of bi/multilingual learning in England (Kenner et al. 2008) and America (Thomas & Collier 2002); this case study will aim to expand on previous research by demonstrating how a variety of languages can be and are being employed effectively within classroom environments in the supplementary sector by observing how teachers and students combine and alternate between Arabic, Urdu, Sylheti and English to engage with the curriculum content...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{takes the}} form of a written <b>analytical</b> <b>exegesis</b> (30 %) {{followed}} by a novel (70 %), entitled Frank Davies ’ Amazing Frog Catapult, to satisfy the requirements of this degree. The contention of the exegesis is that the meat of writing lies in the creative nature of how a text comes to be constructed, the journeys that ideas may take and the maturation and realisation of characters along the way. In doing so, this exegesis highlights how classroom English teachers, as a profession, could benefit from adopting the methods that writers use as they develop their art. In an era in which the My School website publishes school achievement in terms of quantified, NAPLAN style data, educators need to ensure that creativity is being nurtured, rather than discouraged. Following the exegesis is the novel itself: Frank Davies ’ Amazing Frog Catapult. It is aimed at the younger end of an adolescent audience, probably from Grade 5 through to Year 9. Frank Davies ’ Amazing Frog Catapult is set in a fictiona...|$|E

Improvisation and composition share a range of intertwining processes, rather than representing either end of a clear dichotomy. This becomes especially apparent through the exploration of the experiences, composition and improvisation processes in the realisation of the creative practice of this thesis, which consists of a double concerto for guitar/piano/chamber orchestra, and pieces for jazz quartet. This study explores improvisation within the framework of composition through creative practice and <b>analytical</b> <b>exegesis,</b> and addresses 1) A paradigm that accentuates differences between performance and composition based on spatiotemporal perspectives, and 2) Challenges in extending the potential and possibilities of improvisation/composition through an intercultural approach. The theoretical framework consists of analysis and discussion of the creative practice, investigation of temporal theory, perceptions of spontaneity/premeditation, and intercultural elements in improvisation/composition. The central argument of the exegesis claims that improvisation, beyond performance, is not only engaged in composition through multiple levels of improvisation activity, but its process closely resembles that of performance. I add a view to the dialogue arguing that distinctions such as real-time/non-real time improvisation, and rapid/slow composition are unstable in the improvisation/composition paradigm. I argue this is because although muchresearch has been invested in improvisation in performance and allied cultural and political concerns there are two main reasons improvisation in composition remains an obscure topic. First, is the general absence of improvisation consciousness in the last century and a half of Western art music. Second, is the lack of historical record by past renowned composers that were known for their remarkable improvisation ability, but left virtually no reflections on the creative mechanisms of their compositions. The findings in this study illuminate the dialogue with a view that apparent differences in the improvisation/composition paradigm are not only reconcilable, but also negligible.
