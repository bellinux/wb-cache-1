40|$|The problem tackled in {{this study}} is one of MIMO {{transceiver}} implementation in which we consider how to design and test compact antenna arrays that have the ability to preserve the native information bearing capacity of a MIMO channel. Mutual coupling in antenna arrays is known to degrade the performance of a MIMO system. However, no tests involving compact arrays have been performed using a MIMO transceiver architecture that is capable of measuring the effect of mutual coupling on system performance. In this study, two novel compact MIMO antenna arrays were designed and integrated into a wideband MIMO radio testbed. These arrays are extremely compact yet have acceptable mutual coupling and radiation efficiency and resonate in three wide frequency bands. A measurement campaign was executed in which MIMO channel sounding measurements were taken using the compact <b>arrays</b> and <b>dipole</b> <b>arrays</b> in a variety of indoor environments. The MIMO transceiver used for channel sounding is able to measure the effect of mutual coupling on system performance. A comparison of the relative performance between the compact <b>antenna</b> <b>arrays,</b> <b>dipole</b> <b>arrays</b> and the i. i. d. Gaussian channel is presented.

40|$|CubeSats are {{attracting}} {{interest from}} both the industry and academia because of their affordability. Specifically, they are made from commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) electronic circuit chips, and are thus seen as a cost effective replacement for traditional, expensive satellites.

40|$|Abstract—It is {{very common}} that when a {{broadcaster}} needs to install an FM transmitting antenna within a large metropolitan area he places it on the tallest structure or building available. When the rooftop is already occupied by {{a large number of}} other types of transmitting and receiving <b>antennas,</b> the panel <b>dipole</b> an-tenna should be chosen. This antenna is secured to the side walls of the upper floors with the panel oriented to obtain full coverage of the most desirable areas of the city. For the Buenos Aires area this orientation avoids radiating to-ward Uruguay and specifically toward Montevideo, some 140 miles away. A wide band antenna operation permits placing the station on the air {{and at the same time}} allows future stations to share it without the installation of new antennas. Details of model and full model impedance and radiation pattern measurements during the antenna development are presented in order to show its technical characteristics. The radiation patterns were measured on a scale model in an anechoic chamber. The full scaled model was measured in an out-door antenna range. Both E and H plane radiation patterns were measured along the FM band in order to observe pattern varia-tions on both planes. Practically no difference in a panel radiation beamwidth from 88 to 108 MHz was observed and at the same time good input impedance was maintained. A really wide band antenna in pattern and VSWR is obtained. Power division for the antenna system is obtained designing an eight port power divider using the microstrip line technique. In this case, however due to high power operation the ground plane and strip are contained in a sealed metallic box and are separated by high pressure dry air like into the 3 ″ feeding coaxial line.
