25|$|The {{urban sprawl}} of Mexico City reached the borough of Tlalpan in the mid-20th century, {{but only the}} far north of the borough is urbanized. This area {{accounts}} for over 80% of the borough population, {{who live in a}} mix of middle class residential areas and large apartment complexes for the lower classes. This northern area is crossed by a number of major road arteries such as the <b>Anillo</b> Periférico, Calzada de Tlalpan, Viaducto-Tlalpan, Acoxpa, Division del Norte/Miramontes, which experience extremely heavy traffic during rush hour. The highway connecting Mexico City with Cuernavaca also passes through the borough. Intersections of these major roads have large commercial and retail complexes such as that of Avenida Insurgentes and <b>Anillo</b> Periferico, which has several of these complexes, as this is a major highway connection for the south of the city.|$|E
25|$|Transportation for {{the borough}} connects {{the area with}} {{neighboring}} boroughs and the State of Mexico. The Most important road is Avenida Tláhuac, which crosses almost the entire territory, followed by <b>Anillo</b> Periférico and the Mexico City-Tulyehualco road. Road traffic is heavy and congested during many hours of the day, including weekends. Some of the worst traffic in the borough is in Santiago Tulyehualco, where various major roads such as Aquiles Serdan, Francisco Presa, the Tlahuac-Tulyehualco road and Isidro Tapia all converge.|$|E

It is the main moneymaking operation of the ecological park, renting out 1,700 stalls to sellers of live plants and related items, {{much the same way}} as Mexican traditional markets.

This archaeological site is located where Avenida Insurgentes Sur crosses the <b>Anillo</b> Periférico in the Tlalpan borough of the city. The old settlement once extended far {{beyond the boundaries of}} the current site, but it is buried under lava from one of the volcanic eruptions that led to its demise, and much of the modern city is built over this lava. The settlement was located where an old river delta used to form in the valley with waters from Mount Zacatépetl located in what is now the Tlalpan Forest. Cuicuilco was believed to have reached city status by 1200BCE and began to decline around 100 BC–150CE. However, even though the ceremonial pyramid was abandoned, the site remained a location to leave offerings up to 400CE, although lava from the nearby Xitle volcano completely covered it.|$|E

We present a theoretical model of bribery and investment, in which three measures of corruption typically found in the literature are defined and compared. We then study the changes that arise when key parameters of the model change and show that, under identical circumstances, the behavior of any particular corruption measure can differ completely from the behavior of the other measures. Furthermore, we show that the behavior of all three measures can vary substantially when the equilibrium conditions that characterize the economy change. ...|$|R

The forests {{are important to the}} Valley of Mexico/Mexico City as they not only release oxygen into the air, they are an important area for the recharge of the valley’s aquifers. Wells from this borough provide 70% of Mexico City’s potable water. The borough has 120 wells for potable water (out of a total of 450 in the District), which extract about 60 liters each second from each well. However, water shortages are relatively common in the borough proper. Most of {{this is due to the}} lack of wells, drilling equipment and pipelines to serve local residents, with the city authorities only reserving less than a fifth of its infrastructure budget for works in Tlalpan. One serious outage of water occurred in 2001 when thirty nine of the borough’s colonias were without dependable water for two weeks because of the lack of water reserves. Deforestation and other ecological damage make a number of areas susceptible to flooding during the rainy season from June to October. These include <b>Anillo</b> Periférico, Renato Leduc, Boulevard de la Luz and the Picacho Highway.

The interior measures 274.03 hectares (677.1 acres), with 182 hectares (450 acres) of this being undeveloped green space. It contains most of the best known of the park's attractions, such as the Lago Menor (Small Lake), the Nezahuacoyotl Fountain, the Fuente de las Ranas, the Quixote Fountain, the Templanza Fountain, the Altar a la Patria, the Niños Héroes Obelisk, the Monumento a las Águilas Caídas (Monument to Fallen Eagles), The Ahuehuete, and the Baths of Moctezuma.

It also contains the Chapultepec Zoo, the Jardín de la Tercera Edad, and the Audiorama.

2500|$|The main {{problems}} {{confronting the}} borough, like {{others in the}} south of the Federal District, are urban sprawl and environmental concerns. The area is under transition from rural to urban as it borders the urbanized Iztapalapa and the rural Milpa Alta. Its population is growing as people move away from the more crowded city center. [...] 33.5% of the territory is urbanized and 66.5% is classified as environmentally protected. Most of the latter land (4,030 hectares out of 5,674) is farmed. Most {{of the rest of the}} land corresponds to surface water such as the Ciénega de Tláhuac and the foothills of the Teuhtli mountains west of San Juan Ixtayopan. Just under 75% of the urbanized space is residential, with 12.1% as mixed use, 5.8% is parks and green spaces, 5.5% is occupied by irregular settlements and 1.7% is dedicated to urban infrastructure. The areas undergoing the most urbanization are La Nopalera. Agrícola Metropolitana, Villa Centroamericana, Santiago Norte and La Asunción, mostly due to the construction of apartment buildings. Sprawl comes into the borough mostly from Iztapalapa, through Avenida Tláhuac and the San Rafael Atlixco rail line. It also comes in from Coyoacan and Xochimilco through the Canal de Chalco and <b>Anillo</b> Periférico, as well as from Valle de Solidaridad Chalco in the State of Mexico. The best preserved areas are those that border rural Milpa Alta. The main urban corridors are along Avenida Tláhuac which is also where most of the commercial activity takes place. Other corridors include Avenida Estanislao Ramírez, Avenida La Turba and Avenida Jiménez. Most of the mixed use space is in the northwest of the borough and along Avenida Tláhuac. Urbanization is most prominent in the northwest of the borough, which has most of the area’s apartment complexes. The rest of the borough has single family homes and duplexes. Other areas with significant residential growth are Zapotitlán and San Francisco Tlaltenco which has led to a deterioration of their traditional rural appearance. This is especially true in locations closest to Avenida Tlahuac. Areas which have maintained more of their rural character are Santa Catarina Yechuizotl (sheltered by Sierra de Santa Catarina), as well as SanJuan Ixtayopan, San Nicolas Tetelco and San Andrés Mixquic, which are mostly surrounded by chinampas and other farmland that is under protection.|$|E

In the present work has been analysed, for the first time, the entire production line process in the spinning of carded wool. This production was optimised through the introduction of major innovations in the Ring spinning machine and OE-rotor. A complete new system of card spinning was designed and built, based on redesign of the pre-existing group of cards so as to achieve a new compact card (without web divisor) leading to the spinning machines. Although the overall design included modernisation of the OE-rotor as well as the ring spinning machine, the present paper only describes the work done on the ring spinning machine. Research on the OE-ROTOR was carried out at the Technical Textile Institute ITA of RWTH Aachen (Germany) and will be described in further publications. An effort was made throughout to assess the spinning alternatives examined {{from the point of view}} of the quality of the yarn produced. The specific structure of the yarn was also studies, as were the properties of the fabrics woven from these yarns. The intention throughout was to preserve the characteristic properties of the traditional product, made by the conventional carded wool process based on the traditional card assortment. The prototype fabrics were finished under industrial conditions, through the cooperation of participating companies.
