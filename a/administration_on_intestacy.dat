50|$|The above laws conferred a {{right of}} {{succession}} <b>on</b> <b>intestacy</b> <b>on</b> the deceased’s blood relations, but none on a surviving spouse or an adopted child, and furthermore restricted the intestate succession rights of the extra-marital child. Because marriage in community of property was the norm, such a spouse ipso facto took half of the joint estate.|$|R

In the Roman Law it discusses descent <b>on</b> <b>intestacy,</b> testaments, status of heritors, their protection {{and other kinds of}} last wills. In the Czech heirship it handles about indivisible system, testaments and descent <b>on</b> <b>intestacy.</b> Further it deals with the development of the Civil Code from 1627 to 1964. The last chapter compares the present Civil Code with the project of new Civil Code and there are formuled positives and negatives of these legal forms...|$|R
50|$|Collation is an {{obligation}} imposed by law on all descendants {{who wish to}} share as heirs in the estate of their ancestor, either by will or <b>on</b> <b>intestacy.</b> The obligation is to account to the estate for any gifts or advances received by them from their ancestor, or debts incurred to him, during his lifetime.|$|R
50|$|When a donor {{makes an}} {{imperfect}} gift during his lifetime, and the donee is subsequently appointed as the donor's executor or becomes the donor's administrator <b>on</b> <b>intestacy,</b> the gift is perfected because the donee obtains legal {{title to the}} donor's property, including {{the subject matter of}} the intended gift, in the donee's capacity as executor or administrator.|$|R
50|$|The {{general rule}} is that all persons, born or unborn, natural or juristic, and {{regardless}} of their general legal capacity—minor children, too, therefore—may take validly any benefit conferred on them by will or <b>on</b> <b>intestacy.</b> There are, however, various factors that may influence a beneficiary’s capacity to inherit. Persons who have limited legal capacity are still capable of inheriting. However, their ability to enjoy their inheritance {{as they see fit}} is affected.|$|R
50|$|The only persons {{liable to}} collate are {{descendants}} who are heirs <b>on</b> <b>intestacy,</b> {{or who are}} heirs under a will of an ancestor (provided {{that they would have}} been his heirs had there been no will); a hence a grandchild, whose father is alive, and who is an appointed heir under his grandfather’s will, need not collate. If his father is dead, however, he must collate not only what he has received from his grandfather, but also amounts his father received.|$|R
50|$|Parajāta yogas (Sanskrit: परजात - meaning {{stranger}} or servant or born of another) {{are special}} planetary combinations or yogas that indicate birth {{of children who}} are not genetically related to their father or non-marital children or born out of illicit connections of their married mothers. Illegitimate children are stigmatized for no fault of theirs; some, like T.E.Lawrence, are made to seek redemption of their mother’s status but most accept their fate like Satyakama Jabala did. In India, illegitimate children of a Hindu father do not inherit from him <b>on</b> <b>intestacy</b> but they do inherit from their mother at par with her legitimate children.|$|R
50|$|The law <b>on</b> <b>intestacy</b> in Scotland broadly {{follows that}} of England and Wales with some variations. A notable {{difference}} is that all possible (blood) relatives can qualify for benefit (i.e. they {{are not limited to}} grandparents or their descendants). Once a class is 'exhausted', succession continues to the next line of ascendants, followed by siblings, and so on. In a complete absence of relatives of the whole or half-blood, the estate passes to the Crown (as ultimus haeres). The Crown has a discretion to benefit people unrelated to the intestate, e.g. those with moral claims on the estate.|$|R
50|$|Post-hoc legitimisation was {{introduced}} under the Legitimacy Act 1926 (16 & 17 Geo. 5 c. 60) and the Family Law Reform Act 1969 (c. 46) allowed a bastard to inherit <b>on</b> the <b>intestacy</b> of his parents.|$|R
50|$|Under Roman-Dutch law, {{an illegitimate}} or extra-marital child {{inherited}} upon the intestacy of its mother, {{but not of}} its father. This limitation on {{the capacity of the}} extra-marital child to inherit <b>on</b> <b>intestacy</b> has been swept away by the Intestate Succession Act, which provides that, in general, illegitimacy shall not affect the capacity of one blood relation to inherit the intestate estate of another blood relation. Illegitimacy arising from incest, too, no longer presents a problem. Furthermore, as noted earlier, the tenuous position of extra-marital children under African customary law of succession, too, has been removed by making the Intestate Succession Act applicable to all children.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{findings}} from a large-scale study of public attitudes to inheritance law, particularly the rules <b>on</b> <b>intestacy.</b> It argues {{that far from}} {{the assumption that the}} 'family' is in terminal decline, people in England and Wales still view their most important relationships, at least for the purposes of inheritance law, as centred on a nuclear family model. However, there is also widespread acceptance of re-partnering and cohabitation, producing generally high levels of support for including cohabitants in the intestacy rules and for ensuring that children from former relationships are protected. We argue that these views are underpinned by a continuing sense of responsibility to the members of one's nuclear family, arising from notions of sharing and commitment, dependency and support, and a sense of lineage...|$|R
5000|$|In Ireland, {{the term}} [...] "next of kin" [...] {{does have a}} meaning with regard to {{inheritance}} law. If a person dies intestate, that is without leaving a will, then {{the rules of the}} Succession Act 1965 apply. Part VI of the Act — Distribution <b>on</b> <b>Intestacy</b> (sections 66-75) — explains the rules of intestacy; this was amended by Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010. With regard to medical law, [...] "next of kin" [...] is a very vague concept which has no legally defined meaning. If a patient is incapable of making a decision (for instance due to unconsciousness), the present medical ethics in Ireland is to consult with the next of kin (in order: spouse, children, parents, siblings). However, the next of kin have no general right to make decisions on behalf of adult patients.|$|R
40|$|Ontario’s current {{method for}} trying to ensure the fair {{distribution}} of an intestate’s estate, or the estate of an individual without a valid Last Will and Testament, is outlined in the Succession Law Reform Act. Specifically, section 45 (1) outlines the foundational concept of a “preferential share,” which entitles the surviving spouse to a prescribed financial interest in the estate which is prioritized above all other heirs. The concept of a preferential share stands in sharp contrast with historical English common law methods of devolving intestate estates in which legal entitlements were heavily influenced by an individual’s gender and marital status. In light of the historical influence of gender and marital status <b>on</b> <b>intestacy</b> legislation, this paper investigates the origins {{and development of the}} preferential share provision. This paper uses an analytical framework emphasizing the historically gendered experiences of widows and widowers, and how their gender informed the nature of their legal interests under intestacy. In addition, this essay frames its analysis within historical commentary that demonstrates a sharp conceptual dichotomy between the “good wife and deserving widow” or the “bad wife and undeserving widow,” and how such categorization impacted perceptions of what a fair and reasonable devolution entailed...|$|R

50|$|Before {{the mid-19th}} century, the {{principles}} governing {{the transfer of}} real property and personal property <b>on</b> an <b>intestacy</b> were quite different. Though this dichotomy {{does not have the}} same significance anymore, the distinction is still fundamental because of the essential differences between the two categories. An obvious example is the fact that land is immovable, and thus the rules that govern its use must differ. A further reason for the distinction is that legislation is often drafted employing the traditional terminology.|$|R
40|$|The Succession Act 1965 brought, it was said, {{a revolutionary}} {{change in the}} law of {{succession}} to Ireland (Re Urquhart [1974] IR 197 at 208). However, despite the enormous impact it has had on citizens, in the fifty years since its enactment, the Act has never been subject to a comprehensive review or reform. This lack of legislative engagement in Ireland stands in marked contrast to a number of other common law jurisdictions. In the past decade alone, the Law Commission for England and Wales (2011), the Scottish Law Commission (2009), the New South Wales Law Reform Commission (2007) and the British Columbia Law Institute (2006) have each placed their respective succession law regimes under the microscope. Responding to this gap in the literature, this article considers the extent to which surviving spouses or civil partners are adequately protected <b>on</b> <b>intestacy,</b> specifically, in Ireland. Highlighting the potentially serious shortcomings of the Irish fractional share approach, and drawing on the experience of a number of common law jurisdictions, the article presents a proposal for reform. In this regard, it places a particular focus on the need to strike an appropriate balance between the competing interests of spouses/civil partners and children in the distribution of an intestate estate.
