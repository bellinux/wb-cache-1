5|$|As {{with many}} English gardens, {{this one is}} at its best in May and June, when the magnolias are in bloom and luxurious plants, such as peonies and alliums, are flowering. An ongoing {{initiative}} is being made to put in plants which provide interest throughout the season or are at their best in the late summer. There are now many species and colours of lavender and plenty of <b>agapanthus,</b> crinum, nerines and day lilies, together with such rarities as a Heptacodium and an Arbutus menziesii.|$|E
25|$|The homologs GLOBOSA and DEFICIENS {{have also}} been {{isolated}} and characterized in <b>Agapanthus</b> praecox ssp. orientalis (Agapanthaceae), which is phylogenetically distant from the model organisms. In this study the genes were called ApGLO and ApDEF, respectively. Both contain open reading frames that code for proteins with 210 to 214 amino acids. Phylogenetic analysis of these sequences indicated that they belong to B gene family of the monocotyledons. In situ hybridization studies revealed that both sequences are expressed in verticil 1 {{as well as in}} 2 and 3. When taken together, these observations show that the floral development mechanism of <b>Agapanthus</b> also follows the modified ABC model.|$|E
25|$|From an {{economic}} point of view, the order Asparagales {{is second in}} importance within the monocots to the order Poales (which includes grasses and cereals). Species are used as food and flavourings (e.g. onion, garlic, leek, asparagus, vanilla), as cut flowers (e.g. freesia, gladiolus, iris, orchids), and as garden ornamentals (e.g. day lilies, lily of the valley, <b>Agapanthus).</b>|$|E

60|$|The day {{had been}} very hot even for the Transvaal, where the days still {{know how to be}} hot in the autumn, {{although}} the neck of the summer is broken--especially when the thunderstorms hold off for a week or two, as they do occasionally. Even the succulent blue lilies--a variety of the <b>agapanthus</b> which is so familiar to us in English greenhouses--hung their long trumpet-shaped flowers and looked oppressed and miserable, beneath the burning breath of the hot wind which had been blowing for hours like the draught from a volcano. The grass, too, near the wide roadway that stretched in a feeble and indeterminate fashion across the veldt, forking, branching, and reuniting like the veins on a lady's arm, was completely coated over with a thick layer of red dust. But the hot wind was going down now, as it always does towards sunset. Indeed, all that remained of it were a few strictly local and miniature whirlwinds, which would suddenly spring up on the road itself, and twist and twirl fiercely round, raising a mighty column of dust fifty feet or more into the air, where it hung long after the wind had passed, and then slowly dissolved as its particles floated to the earth.|$|E

50|$|In 1996, {{following}} a phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences {{of the gene}} rbcL, Themidaceae was resurrected and <b>Agapanthus</b> was removed from Alliaceae. The authors found <b>Agapanthus</b> to be sister to Amaryllidaceae and transferred it to that family. This was not accepted by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group when they published the original APG system in 1998, because the clade consisting of <b>Agapanthus</b> and Amaryllidaceae had only 63% bootstrap support. The APG system recognized three separate families, Agapanthaceae, Alliaceae sensu stricto, and Amaryllidaceae sensu stricto. Agapanthaceae consisted of <b>Agapanthus</b> only, and Dahlgren's idea that it is close to Tulbaghia was rejected.|$|E

50|$|<b>Agapanthus</b> africanus (African lily) is a {{flowering}} plant from the genus <b>Agapanthus</b> {{native to the}} area of Cape of Good Hope in South Africa. A. africanus is more difficult to grow in gardens than A. praecox, and almost all plants sold as A. africanus are actually A. praecox.|$|E
50|$|<b>Agapanthus</b> africanus can {{be grown}} within USDA plant {{hardiness}} zones 9 to 11. In lower-numbered zones, the bulbs should be placed deeper in the soil and mulched well in the fall. <b>Agapanthus</b> can be propagated by dividing the bulbs or by seeds.

5000|$|<b>Agapanthus</b> praecox (common <b>agapanthus,</b> blue lily, African lily, [...] or lily of the Nile) is {{a popular}} garden plant around the world, {{especially}} in Mediterranean climates. It is native of Natal and Cape of Good Hope in South Africa, local names include agapant, bloulelie, isicakathi and ubani. Most of the cultivated plants of the genus <b>Agapanthus</b> are hybrids or cultivars of this species. The plant is reportedly naturalized in Great Britain, Madeira, the Canary Islands, Eritrea, Ethiopia, St. Helena, Victoria, Norfolk Island, New Zealand, Mexico, Honduras, Costa Rica and Tristan da Cunha.|$|E

50|$|As a rule <b>Agapanthus</b> {{species are}} pest-hardy, neither being much {{attacked}} nor drastically affected by common garden pests. However, {{since the early}} 21st century <b>Agapanthus</b> in the far south of South Africa have fallen victim to a species of Noctuid moth, the <b>Agapanthus</b> Borer, Neuranethes spodopterodes. The larvae of the moth bore into the budding inflorescence and as they mature they tunnel down towards the roots, or emerge from the stem and drop down to feed on the leaves or rhizomes. A severe attack promotes rot and may stunt or even kill the plant; even plants that survive commonly lose most of their inflorescences and fail to produce the desired show of flowers.|$|E
50|$|The current phylogenetic era of {{understanding}} the taxonomic relationships of Amaryllidaceae began {{with the work of}} Fay and Chase (1996) who used the plastid gene rubisco rbcL to identify the close relationship between <b>Agapanthus,</b> Alliaceae, and Amaryllidaceae. <b>Agapanthus</b> had variously been included in Alliaceae or was placed in a separate family, Agapanthaceae. They relocated <b>Agapanthus</b> within Amaryllidaceae which they considered a sister group to Amaryllidaceae. Nevertheless, the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG) classification (1998) still considered these three separate families within Asparagales. The close relationship was confirmed in a more detailed study by Meerow (1999) who confirmed the monophyly of Amaryllidaceae, with Agapanthaceae as its sister family and Alliaceae in turn as sister to the Amaryllidaceae/Agapanthaceae clade.|$|E
