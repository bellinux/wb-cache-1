In 1947 he was appointed as the sports supervisor for the Australian Broadcasting Commission in Perth.

5|$|The Globular Amphora {{culture was}} the next major Neolithic culture. It {{originated}} in the Polish lowlands {{during the first half}} of 4th millennium BC, lasted to about 2400 BCE in parallel with the Funnelbeaker culture, and is named after the bulging shape of its representative pottery. They specialized in breeding domestic animals and lived in a semi-settled state, seeking optimal pastures and moving as needed. This semi-nomadic lifestyle was probably necessitated by the poor condition of the soils, by that time depleted and rendered infertile because of the preceding centuries of forest burning and extensive exploitation. Globular Amphora were the first culture in Poland known for utilizing the domesticated horse, and swine became important as the source of food. Ritual animal, especially cattle burial sites, often with two or more individuals buried together and supplied with objects <b>as</b> <b>strange</b> as drums have been discovered, but their role is not well understood. Globular Amphora people were involved in the north-south amber trade. Their megalithic burials included ceramics, stone tools and ornamental gifts.|$|E

25|$|By 1994 Gr√ºnbaum was {{considering}} polytopes abstractly as combinatorial sets of points or vertices, and was unconcerned whether faces were planar. As {{he and others}} refined these ideas, such sets {{came to be called}} abstract polytopes. An abstract polytope is defined as a partially ordered set (poset), whose elements are the polytope's faces (vertices, edges, faces etc.) ordered by containment. Certain restrictions are imposed on the set that are similar to properties satisfied by the classical regular polytopes (including the Platonic solids). The restrictions, however, are loose enough that regular tessellations, hemicubes, and even objects <b>as</b> <b>strange</b> as the 11-cell or stranger, are all examples of regular polytopes.|$|E

He is best friends with Rich Hardbeck (Alex Arnold), a boy from a very middle-class home who immerses himself in heavy metal subculture. He uses musical elitism as a means to cover up his own shyness when, among other things, interacting with girls.|$|E

Baldini informs Grenouille of another method that can be learned in Grasse and agrees to help him by providing the journeyman papers he requires in exchange for 100 new perfume formulas.

500|$|After the {{two novels}} were published, Disraeli {{declared}} that he would [...] "write no more about myself".

The choice of a Tory publication was regarded <b>as</b> <b>strange</b> by Disraeli's friends and relatives, who thought him more of a Radical. Indeed, he had objected to Murray about Croker's inserting [...] "high Tory" [...] sentiment: Disraeli remarked, [...] "it is quite impossible that anything adverse to the general measure of Reform can issue from my pen." [...] Moreover, at the time Gallomania was published, Disraeli was electioneering in High Wycombe in the Radical interest.|$|E
