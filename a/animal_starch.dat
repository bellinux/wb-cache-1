40|$|Living organisms utilize {{carbohydrates}} {{as essential}} energy storage molecules. Starch is the predominant carbohydrate storage molecule in plants while glycogen is utilized in <b>animals.</b> <b>Starch</b> is a water-insoluble polymer {{that requires the}} concerted activity of kinases and phosphatases to solubilize the outer surface of the glucan and mediate starch catabolism. All known plant genomes encode the glucan phosphatase Starch Excess 4 (SEX 4). SEX 4 can dephosphorylate both the starch granule surface and soluble phosphoglucans and is necessary for processive starch metabolism. The physical basis for the function of SEX 4 as a glucan phosphatase is currently unclear. Herein, we report the crystal structure of SEX 4, containing phosphatase, carbohydrate-binding, and C-terminal domains. The three domains of SEX 4 fold into a compact structure with extensive interdomain interactions. The C-terminal domain of SEX 4 integrally folds into {{the core of the}} phosphatase domain and is essential for its stability. The phosphatase and carbohydrate-binding domains directly interact and position the phosphatase active site toward the carbohydrate-binding site in a single continuous pocket. Mutagenesis of the phosphatase domain residue F 167, which forms the base of this pocket and bridges the two domains, selectively affects the ability of SEX 4 to function as a glucan phosphatase.

Methods:We examined this association in a hospital-based case-control study carried out in Italy between 1992 and 2008, including 198 incident NPC cases and 594 controls. A posteriori dietary patterns were identified through principal component factor analysis performed on 28 nutrients and minerals derived from a 78 -item food-frequency questionnaire. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using unconditional multiple logistic regression models on tertiles of factor scores. Results:We identified five dietary patterns named Animal products, Starch-rich, Vitamins and fibre, Animal unsaturated fatty acids (AUFAs), and Vegetable unsaturated fatty acids (VUFAs). The Animal product (OR= 2. 62, 95 % CI= 1. 67 - 4. 13, for the highest vs lowest score tertile), Starch-rich (OR= 2. 05, 95 % CI= 1. 27 - 3. 33), and VUFA (OR= 1. 90, 95 % CI= 1. 22 - 2. 96) patterns were positively associated with NPC. The AUFA pattern showed a positive association of borderline significance, whereas the Vitamins and fibre pattern was nonsignificantly but inversely associated with NPC.

The present review examines the influence of dietary fibre on the digestive processes and the consequences on pig protein and energy nutrition, health concerns and environmental issues. Dietary fibre is defined as the plant polysaccharides that are resistant to digestive secretions and are potentially available for bacterial fermentation in the intestines of single-stomached <b>animals.</b> Resistant <b>starch</b> is also considered as a dietary fibre. The short-chain fatty acids released by bacteria contribute to the host energy supply and both regulate the composition of the flora and the growth of epithelial cells, {{especially in the case of}} butyrate. The bacterial growth supported by the fermentation induces a shift of N excretion from urine to faeces. Beside the fermentability, the physical properties of dietary fibre such as the water-holding capacity, the viscosity and the solubility influence the digestion, the satiety and the transit time. In relationship with the mechanisms of dietary fibre interaction with the digestive processes exposed in this review, the opportunities and treats of dietary fibre inclusion in swine rations for intensified and for more extensive tropical production systems are discussed. Dietary fibre is indeed a possible means to reduce nitrogen losses of production units and to improve pig intestinal health and animal welfare.

50|$|In {{the first}} phase of {{papermaking}} the characteristics such as its composition, color and weight is determined. Paper has as its chief component, a mat of cellulose fibers. Cellulose is the skeleton structure of plant cells and can be separated from the plant for use in paper. Cellulose has several characteristics that make it desirable for paper, the foremost being its strength when formed into a mat or web. When cellulose fibers come in contact with each other in water, a bond is formed. When water is removed from the adjoining fibers, the bond between the fibers strengthens. Pulp, the collection of individual fibers, may be bleached, especially if the paper is to be dyed a different color or the paper is expected to be white. Since most paper is either printed or written upon, fillers are added to the pulp to fill the pores of the paper and sizing is added to make the fibers water resistant, yet both act as fillers. Unsized paper is blotting paper, making it unsuitable for printing. Fillers and sizing are added to the pulp to absorb the ink quickly, unlike pure cellulose. Fillers can be glues made from <b>animal</b> products, <b>starches</b> from rice or wheat, resins or gums, or minerals such as calcium carbonate, titanium dioxide or kaolin. Mineral fillers are the most common as they are very effective as a filler.

Objective: This health policy study’s aim was to analyze past and current food production and nutritional trends in Russia and their policy implications for Russia’s NCD burden. Design: We examined food security and nutrition in Russia using an analytical framework of food availability, access to food, and consumption. Results: Agricultural production declined {{during the period of}} economic transition, and nutritional habits changed from high-fat <b>animal</b> products to <b>starches.</b> However, per-capita energy consumption remained stable due to increased private expenditures on food and use of private land.

Analytical thermal-fragmentation techniques such as Curie-point pyrolysis Mass Spectrometry and Direct Temperature-resolved Mass Spectrometry gave information about a wide range of compound classes as diverse as lipids, waxes, polynuclear aromatic compounds, oligosaccharides, small peptides and protein fragments, and a variety of thermally stable (more or less condensed) polymeric char structures. Multivariate analysis identified different chemotypes: groups of residues with comparable chemical characteristics. The biomolecular origin of these chemotypes was identified by comparison with experimentally charred reference materials and the application of complementary analytical techniques such as FTIR and 13 C CP/MAS NMR.

The percentage changes of IRS- 1 level in fructose-fed rats before and after treatment with CE were 38. 51 for liver and 31. 92 % for cardiac muscle. This increase in IRS- 1 level after treatment is still lowered than control level with the percentage change - 11. 82 and - 9. 93 % for liver and cardiac muscle respectively. There was a significant positive correlation between IRS- 1 and TAC level whereas there was negative correlation between IRS- 1 and MDA, sialic acid and sFas. Conclusion: This study reports interest findings that cinnamon extract enhances glucose uptake by activating insulin receptor kinase activity in rats fed high fructose diet and it has additional roles as antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agents. Thus, clinical application of cinnamon could be considered as a potential therapeutic option in humans in the treatment of insulin resistance states. So inclusion of cinnamon in the daily diet could be recommended...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a {{biorefinery}} classification approach developed within International Energy Agency (IEA) Bioenergy Task 42. Since production of transportation biofuels {{is seen as the}} driving force for future biorefinery developments, a selection of the most interesting transportation biofuels until 2020 is based on their characteristics to be mixed with gasoline, diesel and natural gas, reflecting the main advantage of using the already-existing infrastructure for easier market introduction. This classification approach relies on four main features: (1) platforms; (2) products; (3) feedstock; and (4) processes. The platforms are the most important feature in this classification approach: they are key intermediates between raw materials and final products, and can be used to link different biorefinery concepts. The adequate combination of these four features represents each individual biorefinery system. The combination of individual biorefinery systems, linked through their platforms, products or feedstocks, provides an overview of the most promising biorefinery systems in a classification network. According to the proposed approach, a biorefinery is described by a standard format as platform(s) - products - and feedstock(s). Processes can be added to the description, if further specification is required. Selected examples of biorefinery classification are provided; for example, (1) one platform (C 6 sugars) biorefinery for bioethanol and <b>animal</b> feed from <b>starch</b> crops (corn); and (2) four platforms (lignin/syngas, C 5 /C 6 sugars) biorefinery for synthetic liquid biofuels (Fischer-Tropsch diesel), bioethanol and animal feed from lignocellulosic crops (switchgrass). This classification approach is flexible as new subgroups can be added according to future developments in the biorefinery are...|$|R
40|$|Carbohydrates {{have long}} {{been a part of}} animal feeding rations. Grains are {{included}} in all animal feeding formulas. The by-products of sugar beets have been used for many years in livestock feeding (Kutish 1950 b). The use of molasses in commercial feed mixed in 1899 made possible its extended use in animal feeding practices (Hall 1950). Protein feeds for cattle are relatively high in price and not available in adequate supply. With these fats in mind Culbertson of Iowa State College set up experiments in 1950 to find out whether part or all of the protein supplement could be replaced with non-protein nitrogen feed in a good steer fattening ratio. The sugar in cane molasses is utilized more readily by <b>animals</b> than <b>starch</b> in corn grain, so molasses was fed to steers in the non-protein nitrogen feed. The growth made by the steers fed on these rations was {{on a par with the}} control group and use of these non-protein feeds in rations is likely to be of economical and practical importance. These findings have been verified by feeding large numbers of cattle (Bode 1951). Direct molasses usage on farms may be divided into two types: direct use as feed; and use as a preservative in making grass silage. At present the first type is more important, the second being used throughout the dairy belt (Kutsh 1950 a; Aries and Copulsky 1949). Regarding amounts of molasses which may be fed, the Bureau of Animal Industry of the United States Department of Agriculture (Kutish 1950 a) reports: At various times and under different circumstances, molasses products are fed to nearly all classes of animals. Larger proportionate amounts are generally fed to beef cattle than to poultry and swine. Generous amounts can be fed to horses, mules, sheep and goats. We have ordinarily advised use of 5 per cent of this feed. In the case of swine, 10 per cent can be used although we have fed 20 per cent in test rations. For cattle, a third or more of the corn or other grain can be replaced with molasses. Occasionally much larger amounts are used. Feeding carbohydrates in the form of sucrose for short periods before slaughtering improved the keeping quality, flavor and texture of pork as noted by Gibbons and Rose (1950) and Madsen (1950). These investigators indicated a need for further studies on swine and detailed studies on beef. The purpose of this investigation was to study the effect of feeding sucrose to beef and swine prior to slaughter, on the percentage of carbohydrate, pH, color, texture, and flavor of muscle and liver...|$|R
40|$|Cassava was {{introduced}} into Africa from South America {{in the latter}} half of the 16 th century. Since then it has become one of the most important food crops in Africa. Its starchy, tuberous roots are a valuable source of calories and in many parts of Africa, the leaves and tender shoots of cassava are also consumed as vegetables. Over two-thirds of the total production of cassava is consumed in various forms by humans. Its usage as a source of ethanol for fuel, energy in <b>animal</b> feed, and <b>starch</b> for industry is increasing. The crop is amenable to agronomic as well as genetic improvement, has a high yield potential under good conditions and performs better than other crops under sub-optimal conditions. Because of the agronomic and economic importance of cassava this book has been produced for those involved in the production and post-harvest technology of the crop. Designed both as a teaching aid for training sessions and as a convenient reference book, the manual is divided into four parts, and together these parts contain 12 units. Part I deals with production constraints. Part 11, which explains means of overcoming these constraints, consists of 6 units: morphology and physiology; breeding; rapid multiplication, tissue culture agronomy and crop protection. Part 111 deals with post-harvest technology and Part IV covers aspects of data collection and on-farm research. Although only a relatively small book, the informative text is well presented and is supplemented by diagrams, charts, tables and photographs.
