The large {{contracts}} signed by Williams and Martin were extreme exceptions. In October after the cancellation of regular season games, it was not anticipated that many additional NBA players would be signed overseas; leagues had started playing, their rosters were full, and new players could disrupt the teams.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from this}} active communication, a good bughouse player tries to {{coordinate}} silently by {{keeping an eye}} on the other board and adapting moves accordingly. This can mean <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>as</b> glancing at the other board before trading queens, or as much as playing an opening adapted to the other board.|$|E
5|$|As late as December 31, neither {{team had}} sold its entire {{allotment}} of 17,500 tickets. Cincinnati fans had bought 13,000 tickets, while Virginia Tech fans bought fewer than 5,000 tickets from the school's allotment. Countering Virginia Tech's low direct ticket sales were {{large numbers of}} fans who avoided paying face value for tickets—US$125—by buying them on the secondary market, often for <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>as</b> 99 cents.|$|E

5|$|Chemical {{changes in}} the liquid in the cnida make it a much more {{concentrated}} solution, so that osmotic pressure forces water in very rapidly to dilute it. This mechanism has been observed in nematocysts of the class Hydrozoa, sometimes producing pressures as high as 140 atmospheres, {{similar to that of}} scuba air tanks, and fully extending the thread in <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>as</b> 2milliseconds (0.002second).|$|E

5|$|Even before Adolf Hitler {{seized control}} of Germany in 1933, the {{problems}} with the Minority Treaties were evident. Various European governments continued to abuse minorities, the latter loudly protested, their complaints were exploited by interested parties with ulterior motives, and the League interfered <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>as</b> possible.

Recurrent CSF leak at an alternate site after recent repair is common.|$|E

5|$|The Fat Man {{plutonium}} bombs used explosive {{compression of}} plutonium to obtain significantly higher densities than normal, {{combined with a}} central neutron source to begin the reaction and increase efficiency. Thus only 6.2kg of plutonium was needed for an explosive yield equivalent to 20 kilotons of TNT.

5|$|Uranium is more {{plentiful}} than antimony, tin, cadmium, mercury, or silver, and it {{is about}} as abundant as arsenic or molybdenum. Uranium is found in hundreds of minerals, including uraninite (the most common uranium ore), carnotite, autunite, uranophane, torbernite, and coffinite. Significant concentrations of uranium occur in some substances such as phosphate rock deposits, and minerals such as lignite, and monazite sands in uranium-rich ores (it is recovered commercially from sources with <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>as</b> 0.1% uranium).|$|E
