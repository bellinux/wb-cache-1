Should there be no Heir to the Throne under articles 51 and 52, the King shall select his successor from among the male members of his family, but the King's selection shall be {{with the consent of}} Parliament. Should the King not use his prerogative, and the succession remain vacant, Parliament shall then select a male member of the King's family as successor to the Throne. In case no heirs exist in the King's family, or such as may exist are held incapable by a special parliamentary decision taken by a two-thirds majority {{of the members of the}} House, Parliament shall select a successor from the line of the King's daughters or sisters, but such successor must be of Albanian origin. When there are no males in the families above mentioned, Parliament shall select a successor of Albanian origin. Should the Throne remain vacant, the Council of Ministers shall exercise the Royal powers until the question of the successor is settled. Art. 54. The King comes of age at 18 years. Art. 55. The King shall exercise the Royal powers only after having taken, in the presence of Parliament, the oath set forth in article 56. Art. 56. The King, in the. presence of Parliament, shall take the following oath : [...] "I, - , King of the Albanians, on ascending the Throne of the Albanian Kingdom and assuming the Royal powers, swear in the presence of God Almighty that I will maintain national unity, the independence of the State, and its territorial integrity, and I will maintain and conform to the statute and laws in force, having the good of the, people always in mind.

The speech from the Throne or the message must be signed by the Cabinet. Art. 92. The King may order the opening of the ordinary parliamentary session even before the time prescribed in the present statute, but not more than 1 month before the date the session should open. The King may also convoke extraordinary sessions, but they must be brought to a close before the date of the opening of the ordinary session. Art. 93. The King closes the sessions by decree, which is signed by the Cabinet and read to Parliament by the Government. Art. 94. The King has the right to adjourn the opening of a session, to suspend a sitting during a session, and to prolong a session.

Other than the above, no titles of nobility may be conferred on or held by Albanians in Albania.|$|E
40|$|Rana margaritifera was {{described}} by Laurenti in 1768 and currently is associated to the genus Rhinella, under the combination Rhinella margaritifera. Currently, the R. margaritifera species group consists of 16 recognized species. Furthermore, many additional species have been suggested to exist in this group which highlights the ambiguity surrounding the identity of Rhinella margaritifera and impend further description of the species in this group. After an exhaustive bibliographic review, we concluded that the recent designation of a lectotype for R. margaritifera is invalid according with <b>Art.</b> <b>73,</b> ICZN, 1999.

40|$|On the 23 June 2006 the {{operative}} {{provisions of the}} Fisheries Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fishing Offences) Act 2006 (Cth) (the amending Act) came into force. The main purpose of the amending Act is to introduce custodial penalties for foreign fishing offences which are committed in Australia’s territorial sea. In so doing, the legislative drafters have acknowledged the legal distinction between the regimes of the territorial sea and the exclusive economic zone (EEZ). That is, the fact that under international law a coastal State may impose {{the full force of}} its criminal laws within the territorial sea whilst within the EEZ the coastal State’s rights in relation to the enforcement of its fisheries laws are limited by <b>Art</b> <b>73</b> of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (LOSC). In terms of the fight against the persistent and increasing numbers of illegal foreign fishers visiting Australia’s waters, the distinction is long overdue. Whether the risk of incurring a custodial sentence will actually deter foreign fishers remains to be seen. In the interim, {{there are a number of}} observations to be made in relation to the amending Act. These observations are best appreciated when considered in the context of the legal framework under which Australian fisheries are managed, together with a brief account of the significant increase in the numbers of illegal fishers being sighted in the northern waters of the Australian Fishing Zone (AFZ) ...|$|E
40|$|Background: Effective {{contraceptive}} practices amongst HIV-positive {{women of}} reproductive age {{have been shown}} to reduce mother-to-child transmission of HIV by preventing unplanned pregnancies. However, most antiretroviral therapy (ART) programmes focus on treatment,neglecting comprehensive contraceptive services. This results in a high frequency of pregnancies amongst HIV-positive women attending the ART clinic of a regional hospital north of Durban. Objectives: This research aimed to explore contraceptive use amongst HIV-positive women attending an ART clinic by determining, (1) prevalence of contraceptive use, (2) pregnancy rate, (3) contraceptive preferences and (4) factors associated with contraceptive use. Methods: In this observational, analytical, cross-sectional study of 420 women, aged 15 to 49 years, participants were selected by systematic random sampling. They completed standardised questionnaires. Results: Of all participants, 95 % of the participants used contraception. Factors associated with contraceptive practice were knowledge of HIV status 292 (72. 8 %), health worker advice 84 (20. 9 %), and spousal insistence 33 (8. 2 %). Of the 130 women (31 %) who had fallen pregnant whilst on <b>ART,</b> <b>73</b> (56. 2 %) said that the pregnancy had been unplanned, whilst 57 (43. 8 %) had wanted to fall pregnant because of: partner’s insistence (45. 6 %), desire for a child (36. 8 %), desire to conceal HIV status (15. 8 %), not wanting to die childless (5. 3 %), and death of a previous child (1. 8 %). Conclusion: Contraceptive use amongst these women was high but the number of pregnancies is a cause for concern. Information regarding contraceptive use should therefore be provided at all ART clinics...|$|E
40|$|Background and Methods: Little {{is known}} about {{antiretroviral}} therapy (ART) outcomes in prisoners in Africa. We conducted a retrospective review of outcomes of a large cohort of prisoners referred to a public sector, urban HIV clinic. The review included baseline characteristics, sequential CD 4 cell counts and viral load results, complications and co-morbidities, mortality and loss to follow-up up to 96 weeks on ART. Findings: 148 inmates (133 male) initiated on ART {{were included in the}} study. By week 96 on <b>ART,</b> <b>73</b> % of all inmates enrolled in the study and 92 % of those still accessing care had an undetectable viral load (, 400 copies/ml). The median CD 4 cell count increased from 122 cells/mm 3 at baseline to 356 cells/mm 3 by 96 weeks. By study end, 96 (65 %) inmates had ever received tuberculosis (TB) therapy with 63 (43 %) receiving therapy during the study: 28 % had a history of TB prior to ART initiation, 33 % were on TB therapy at ART initiation and 22 % developed TB whilst on ART. Nine (6 %) inmates died, 7 in the second year on ART. Loss to follow-up (LTF) was common: 14 (9 %) patients were LTF whilst still incarcerated, 11 (7 %) were LTF post-release and 9 (6 %) whose movements could not be traced. 16 (11 %) inmates had inter-correctional facility transfers and 34 (23 %) were released of whom only 23 (68 %) returned to the ART clinic for ongoing follow-up. Conclusions: Inmates responded well to ART, despite a high frequency of TB/HIV co-infection. Attention should be directed towards ensuring eligible prisoners access ART programs promptly and that inter-facility transfers and release procedure...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The aims of {{this study}} were to compare 2 -year {{cumulative}} survival rates of amalgam and atraumatic restorative treatment (ART) restorations in primary molars and to investigate the determinants of the survival rate of restorations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A controlled clinical trial using a parallel group design was carried out on 258 children aged 6 - 7 years old, allocated to two treatment groups: conventional restorative treatment using amalgam and ART using high-viscosity glass ionomer. A total of 364 amalgam restorations and 386 ART restorations were placed by three pedodontists in 126 and 158 children, respectively, and were evaluated after 0. 5, 1, and 2 years. Restorations were placed in vital primary molars with neither pain nor signs of pulp involvement. The survival analysis was conducted using the proportional hazard rate regression model with frailty correction. RESULTS: The 2 -year cumulative survival rates for all amalgam (77. 3 %) and <b>ART</b> (<b>73.</b> 5 %) restorations were not statistically significantly different, but there was an effect of "type of surface" (single/multiple) and "cavity filling time" on the survival rates. Both amalgam and ART single-surface restorations had higher survival rates than multiple-surface restorations of the same material. Secondary caries was responsible for 36 and 38 % of failures in amalgam and ART restorations, respectively. Mean time for restoring all type of cavities with amalgam and ART restorations was 13. 6 and 13. 7 min, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Amalgam and ART restorations presented similar survival rates over a 2 -year period for all, single-surface, and multiple-surface restorations. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In the cause of finding alternatives to amalgam, ART restorations using high-viscosity glass ionomer might be a suitable option for managing cavitated dentine carious lesions in vital primary molars...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) acquired immunodeficiency syndrome disease has evolved to become a social and economic catastrophe, with far-reaching implications affecting every phase of life of the diseased individual. Data on adults and children diagnosed with HIV infection are useful for determining populations needing prevention and treatment services. Oral lesions may be the presenting symptoms of HIV infection and may differ entirely from those manifested in the adult population. Aim and Objective: We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of HIV related oral lesions among pediatric HIV patients and to assess the oral health status of HIV infected children residing in a selected childcare facility in Puducherry. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted during September 2015 in child care facility for HIV infected children located in Puducherry U. T, India. All children < 18 years, who are diagnosed with HIV infection and are put on anti-retroviral therapy (ART) or pre-ART care, {{were included in the}} study. After obtaining informed consent from the care-givers and assent of the children, they were interviewed and examined by a team comprising a qualified dental surgeon and a trained physician. Results: Majority of the children were under first-line <b>ART</b> (<b>73</b> %) and were on ART for more than 4 years. The CD 4 count of 23 (52. 3) was between 500 – 1000 cells/μL. The recent viral load assay in 32 (72. 7) patients was < 150 /not detected. Tooth decay was the most common oral manifestation with 28 (63. 6) being affected. Nonspecific lymphadenopathy 26 (59. 1) was the most common coexisting systemic illness. Conclusion: This study proves that constant surveillance by monitoring the general health status, CD 4 counts, viral load coupled with stringent ART care has improved the overall quality of life of these children and consequently resulted in lesser oral manifestations...|$|E

40|$|The present article {{attempts}} at settling a question concerning sources {{of a legal}} status of attorney (agent) in the enterprise, character of a legal relation linking the enterprise with its employee in the situation when the latter performs external acts, forms of appointing an attorney and admissibility of appointing fully empowered attorneys in the enterprise. The sole sources of power of attorney in the enterprise are: declaration of will of a director and the statute (art. 97, 464 and 734 par. 2 of the Civil Code). Interpretation of art. 45 sec. 1 of The State Enterprise Act brings {{to the conclusion that}} the director is vested not only with a competence of granting power of attorney but also of selecting the attorney's person. The enterprise's employee is not authorised to perform external acts on a base of the director's mandate addressed to him within the scope of defined "internal" relation. The said employee can act only on a base of civil law power of attorney. Granting a power of attorney requires only an ordinary written form for its validity. Art. 45 sec. 2 of The State Enterprise Act is the special provision in relation to the Civil Code provisions which are voicing the principle of freedom of form (<b>art.</b> <b>73</b> et seq.) and to art. 99 par. 1 and 2 c. c. On the grounds of art. 45 sec. 3 of The State Enterprise Act I assume the admissibility of granteeng all the three types of power of attorney by the state enterprise. In particular it is permissible for the director to grant a general power of attorney.

40|$|Two {{methods of}} {{performing}} serological screening tests for syphilis are compared. One {{consisted of the}} Venereal Diseases Reference Laboratory (VDRL) slide test, the cardiolipin Wassermann reaction (CWR), and the Reiter protein complement fixation test (RPCFT) performed manually; {{the other was a}} fully automated system using two Technicon AutoAnalyzers (AAII), one for the automated reagin test (ART) and the other for automated complement fixation tests. The absorbed fluorescent treponemal antibody test (FTA-ABS) was used as a final arbiter in all cases found to be seropositive by either method. A pooled antigen consisting of a mixture of cardiolipin and Reiter protein was used for the automated complement fixation test, thus increasing the scope and capacity of the system. The AutoAnalyzer was shown to be capable of performing 400 cardiolipin and Reiter complement fixation tests and 700 automated reagin tests in an 8 -hour day. Modification of the complement fixation test method {{to take advantage of the}} highly sensitive colorimeter resulted in a significant increase in sensitivity and a corresponding saving in reagents. Of the 7843 sera tested, 258 gave a positive result in one or more of the screening tests. The automated test detected many more Reiter positive sera (127) than the manual test (83). Conversely, fewer CWR positive sera were detected by the automated test (60) than by the manual test (82). There was little difference between the number of positive sera detected by the <b>ART</b> (<b>73)</b> and the VDRL slide test (71). In 19 instances the automated tests detected positive sera which registered as completely negative in the manual tests, and four seropositive cases which the automated tests had failed to detect were detected by the manual tests, and four seropositive cases which the automated tests had failed to detect were detected by the manual tests. It was concluded that a combination of the ART and automated Reiter protein complement fixation test (ARPCFT) would be ideal for use in a large-scale screening programme for the detection of syphilis...|$|E

MEWPs are often preferred over traditional tech-niques due to their impressive features of mobility, flexibility, cost and time reduction. But the number of accidents occurred during the use of MEWPs should not be underestimated: ac-cording to international databases, approximately 200 fatal accidents / year occur due to machines overturn, electrocution, fall from height, stability problems and overrun of the performance limits. Specialized operators are required for MEWPs (Italian law D.

In spite of that, both in routine operations and in emergency conditions, a not negligible num-ber of Hazard Factors can be identified such as over-confidence, unconsidered modus operandi due to haste, lack of preliminary inspections and function checks, poor maintenance and sometimes incom-pleteness of instruction handbooks. Moreover, the widespread practice of rent without operator of the MEWPs for temporary operations appears to lay at very the base of many accidents. The Authors analysed, within Prosecutor investi-gations, a number of fatal accidents involving MEWPs, and in the present paper the case histories are discussed with reference to: the criteria of selection among different ty-pologies of MEWPs, taken into account the most suitable operating characteristics and parameters for both common and special working conditions (sup-porting structures, working heights, rated capacities, outreaches,…); the Hazard Identification techniques suitable {{to point out the}} main possible operating deviations, to implement preventive measures for an effective MEWP Risk Assessment and Management; the basics of operators Information, For-mation and Training, to grant them appropriate knowledge of the various categories of MEWPs and the machines correct use, typical misuses and criti-calities in different yard situations; the paramount importance of maintenance in accordance with the provisions of the Italian trans-position of European Directives and the C-type standards, and the involved responsibilities in case of rented machines,; the familiarization of trained workers, essen-tial to a user-friendly utilization of the particular MEWPs model both in ordinary work and emergen-cy situations; the essential need of completeness and intel-ligibility of the machine accompanying documents, with special reference to the instruction handbook, for a correct and clear informatio...|$|E

Background: Fab antibody fragments in E. coli are usually {{directed to the}} oxidizing periplasmic space for correct folding. From periplasm Fab fragments may further leak into extracellular medium. Information on the cultivation parameters affecting this leakage is scarce, and the unpredictable nature of Fab leakage is problematic regarding consistent product recovery. To elucidate the effects of cultivation conditions, we investigated Fab expression and accumulation into either periplasm or medium in E. coli K- 12 and E. coli BL 21 when grown in different types of media and under different aeration conditions. Results: Small-scale Fab expression demonstrated significant differences in yield and ratio of periplasmic to extracellular Fab between different culture media and host strains. Expression in a medium with fed-batch-like glucose feeding provided highest total and extracellular yields in both strains. Unexpectedly, cultivation in baffled shake flasks at 150 rpm shaking speed resulted in higher yield and accumulation of Fabs into culture medium as compared to cultivation at 250 rpm. In the fed-batch medium, extracellular fraction in E. coli K- 12 increased from 2 - 17 % of total Fab at 250 rpm up to 75 % at 150 rpm. This was partly due to increased lysis, but also leakage from intact cells increased at the lower shaking speed. Total Fab yield in E. coli BL 21 in glycerol-based autoinduction medium was 5 to 9 -fold higher at the lower shaking speed, and the extracellular fraction increased from ≤[*] 10 % to 20 - 90 %. The effect of aeration on Fab localization was reproduced in multiwell plate by variation of culture volume. Conclusions: Yield and leakage of Fab fragments are dependent on expression strain, culture medium, aeration rate, and {{the combination of these}} parameters. Maximum productivity in fed-batch-like conditions and in autoinduction medium is achieved under sufficiently oxygen-limited conditions, and lower aeration also promotes increased Fab accumulation into extracellular medium. These findings have practical implications for screening applications and small-scale Fab production, and highlight the importance of maintaining consistent aeration conditions during scale-up to avoid changes in product yield and localization. On the other hand, the dependency of Fab leakage on cultivation conditions provides a practical way to manipulate Fab localization...|$|E
40|$|The {{dominant}} {{position of the}} parties with regard to a civil litigation constitutes a major principle of the Greek Code of Civil Procedure (principle of free disposition). Furthermore, The orientation of the Greek Code of Civil Procedure towards the contemporary model of a more active judge, apart from the more or less passive role of the latter, mainly to examine lack of the procedural prerequisites (<b>Art.</b> <b>73</b> CCP) and the legal foundation of the action on his own motion, is only sporadically provided for in certain regulations. The right of defence before the courts is explicitly guaranteed by Art. 20 I b of the Greek Constitution explicitly guarantees: “Every person … may plead before them his views concerning his rights or interests as specified by law”. Moreover, the Code of Civil Procedure provides for {{the principle of the}} need for the summoning of the parties in all hearings of the case (Art. 110 II CCP), notwithstanding the application of special provisions oriented towards the specification of the right of defence. The taking of evidence is in principle administered before the whole panel of the court (= principle of directness). Moreover, witnesses testify before one member of the court’s panel, who is appointed as the reporter judge Art. 270 V CCP). In particular, expert reports and viewing of the premises may be orally ordered by the court. The publicity of the courts’ sittings (Art. 93 II) and publicity of the pronouncement of the courts’ judgments (Art. 93 III) are explicitly guaranteed by the Greek Constitution (Art. 93 II, III). The credibility of the means of proof is in principle freely evaluated by the court, unless otherwise explicitly provided, thus the judge decides in accordance with his inner conviction as regards the truth of the factual allegations. The judgement must include the reasons, which led the judge to the formation of his conviction (Art. 340 CCP). The Greek Code of Civil Procedure requires in principle the full conviction of the court as regards the standard of proof. Eight means of proof are exclusively listed in Art. 339 CCP: confession, direct proof, especially viewing the premises, expert reports, documentary evidence, examination of parties, testimony, presumptions and sworn attestations. The Greek Code of Civil Procedure, {{under the influence of the}} German-origin “Norms’ Theory” (“Normentheorie”), introduces the rule that “Each party is obliged to prove the facts which are required to support his self-contained claim or counter-claim” (Art. 338 I CCP). Art. 19 III of the Greek Constitution provides for the inadmissibility of the means of evidence obtained in violation of Art. 19, 9 and 9 A of the Greek Constitution, as regards the protection of the secrecy of letters and other forms of communication, the protection of every person’s home (“asylum”), the inviolability of private and family life and the inviolability of personal data respectively...|$|E

40|$|The main aim of {{this paper}} is focused on {{vibration}} attenuation of the electromechanical system flexibly coupled with a baseplate and damped by an impact element. The model is constructed with three degrees of freedom in the mechanical oscillating part, two translational and one rotational. The system movement is described by three mutually coupled second-order ordinary differential equations, derived by the force balance method. Here, the most important nonlinearities are: stiffness of the support spring elements and internal impacts. The main results show the impact damping device attenuates vibrations of the rotor frame {{in a wide range of}} the excitation frequencies, that is wider then in the case when the impact element works only as an inertia damper without occurrence of any impacts.
