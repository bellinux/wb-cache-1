5|$|Nickel {{is used as}} <b>a</b> <b>binder</b> in the {{cemented}} {{tungsten carbide}} or hardmetal industry and used in proportions of 6% to 12% by weight. Nickel makes the tungsten carbide magnetic and adds corrosion-resistance to the cemented parts, although the hardness is less than those with a cobalt binder.|$|E

5|$|Painting {{on linen}} cloth using glue size as <b>a</b> <b>binder</b> {{was at the}} time a {{relatively}} inexpensive alternative to oil, and a large number of works were produced in the 15th century. Glue size does not saturate the pigments as much as oil, allowing them to show as matt and opaque, giving – especially with reds and blues – an intense appearance when applied to cloth. Cloth is fragile and perishes easily, and this work {{is one of the best}} preserved of the few surviving examples of the technique from the period; the majority extant today were executed on wood using oil or egg tempera. Curtains or glass were often used to protect glue-sized works.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>binder</b> {{with the}} film's storyboards {{served as a}} {{reference}} for live-action filming, shots that would be filmed {{in front of a}} chroma key blue screen, and shots that would be composed using CGI. The sets were often built with the parts that would be required on screen; often they were built only up to the heights of the actors. Chroma key was extensively used for digital set extensions, backgrounds or scenes that required cinematographer David Tattersall to seek powerful lamps to light the sets and visual effects supervisor John Knoll to develop software that would remove the blue reflection from shiny floors. Knoll, who remained on set through most of the production, worked closely with Tatterstall to ensure that the shots were suitable to add effects later. The cameras were fitted with data capture models to provide technical data for the CGI artists.|$|E

The pattern then starts over with the first 25 pair group as white/blue, and continues indefinitely, in multiples of 600 pairs or parts thereof. For example, a 900-pair cable will have the first 600 pairs in 24 groups of 25 pairs in <b>a</b> white <b>binder,</b> and the remaining 300 pairs in 12 groups of 25 pairs wrapped in <b>a</b> red <b>binder.</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractA {{processing}} {{technique was}} recently developed to realize plastic deformation in wood impregnated with <b>a</b> thermoset <b>binder.</b> This paper proposes a new flow forming technique where <b>a</b> thermoplastic <b>binder</b> {{is used instead}} of <b>a</b> thermoset <b>binder</b> {{with the expectation that}} the formability and recyclability of the products will be improved. To clarify the effect of the thermoplastic binder on the flow deformation behavior of wood, capillary fluidity tests were performed using impregnated wood with various contents of thermoplastic binder (polymer). The extrusion load of the impregnated wood through the capillary decreased with an increase of the polymer content in the wood. Results of the second fluidity test using the first extruded material reveals that the recycled impregnated wood can flow again. The extrusion load of the second extrusion was equal to or lower than the first. These results indicate that the recyclability of the wood impregnated with <b>a</b> thermoplastic <b>binder</b> is highly promising. The internal configuration of the impregnated wood during extrusion was also dependent on the polymer content...|$|R

40|$|Coal mining is a {{thriving}} industry and 53 % {{of the coal}} mined in South Africa is used for electricity generation. Mechanization has made coal mining more efficient, but fines generation has subsequently increased. Up to 6 % of the run of mine material can report to the - 200 μm fraction. Common problems associated with fines handling include dust formation, storage problems, and high moisture levels. A method to turn this material into a saleable product instead of stockpiling it can add value to a company. Briquetting is a pressure agglomeration method where loose material is compacted into a dense mass (FEECO International, 2014). The briquettes {{must be able to}} withstand rigorous handling and transport operations without disintegrating. This study aims to investigate the optimum binder and moisture conditions required to produce a mechanically strong briquette using two different <b>binders</b> – <b>a</b> PVA powder (<b>binder</b> <b>A)</b> and <b>a</b> starch powder (<b>binder</b> B). It was found that for <b>binder</b> <b>A</b> the optimum moisture level was 12 % to 14 %. At this moisture level the greatest compression strength gains were observed, and low amounts of fines produced in impact and abrasion tests. The minimum amount of binder added while still obtaining a strong briquette was 0. 5 % <b>binder</b> <b>A.</b> For <b>binder</b> B the optimum moisture level was also 12 % and the minimum amount of Binder B to be added was found to be 1 %. Briquettes that were dried outside reached their peak strength after about four days, whereas the briquettes that dried inside took about 20 days to reach their strength plateau. Hardly any degradation took place {{on the surface of the}} <b>binder</b> <b>A</b> film after exposure of 300 hours of artificial weathering. Thermogravimetric analysis confirmed that neither <b>binder</b> <b>A</b> nor <b>binder</b> B will add to the ash content of the coal fines, as both binders totally decompose above 530 °C. Binder B yielded stronger briquettes after 15 days and also generated less fines. It is therefore superior to <b>binder</b> <b>A</b> and would be recommended for further use.
