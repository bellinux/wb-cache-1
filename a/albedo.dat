5|$|The {{sizes of}} both moons are {{calculated}} {{with the assumption}} that they have the same infrared <b>albedo</b> as Haumea, which is reasonable as their spectra show them to have the same surface composition. Haumea's <b>albedo</b> has been measured by the Spitzer Space Telescope: from ground-based telescopes, the moons are too small and close to Haumea to be seen independently. Based on this common <b>albedo,</b> the inner moon, Namaka, which is a tenth the mass of Hiʻiaka, would be about 170km in diameter.|$|E
5|$|While on Second Miltia, MOMO, Ziggy, {{chaos and}} Jr. are {{attacked}} by U-TIC agents in powerful mechs, only being saved by Canaan's intervention. Shion meanwhile has an uncomfortable reunion with Jin, as she blames his absence {{for the deaths}} of their parents during the Miltian Conflict. In the hours leading up to MOMO's scan, both Jr. and his brother Gaignun are telepathically tormented by <b>Albedo,</b> who still cannot decode the data he stole from MOMO. During the procedure, a virus implanted in MOMO by <b>Albedo</b> activates, and MOMO fragments her own personality to keep Mizrahi's data secure. Shion, Jr. {{and the rest of the}} group enter MOMO's subconscious to save her. During this period, Jr. reveals himself to have been part of an experiment by Dmitri Yuriev: Yuriev's wish was to create an existence which would neutralize U-DO. The three were close, but <b>Albedo</b> became disturbed when he discovered his ability to survive any injury was unique to him, meaning he could outlive his brothers. During an experiment, Jr. broke the circuit containing a portion of U-DO, resulting in everyone except himself, <b>Albedo</b> and Gaignun being killed. <b>Albedo</b> was touched by U-DO and went insane, while Gaignun remained unaffected. As they save MOMO, <b>Albedo</b> hacks in and tricks MOMO into releasing the decoded data to him. Using the data, <b>Albedo</b> opens the way to Miltia.|$|E
5|$|Ariel is {{the most}} {{reflective}} of Uranus's moons. Its surface shows an opposition surge: the reflectivity decreases from 53% at a phase angle of 0° (geometrical <b>albedo)</b> to 35% at an angle of about 1°. The Bond <b>albedo</b> of Ariel is about 23%—the highest among Uranian satellites. The surface of Ariel is generally neutral in color. There may be an asymmetry between the leading and trailing hemispheres; the latter appears to be redder than the former by 2%. Ariel's surface generally does not demonstrate any correlation between <b>albedo</b> and geology {{on the one hand}} and color on the other hand. For instance, canyons have the same color as the cratered terrain. However, bright impact deposits around some fresh craters are slightly bluer in color. There are also some slightly blue spots, which do not correspond to any known surface features.|$|E
30|$|One should {{consider}} bolometric Bond <b>albedos</b> rather than geometric <b>albedos</b> in global energy-budget calculations. This is because Bond <b>albedos</b> are spherical, while geometric <b>albedos</b> are directional. Studies oftentimes only report geometric <b>albedos</b> of celestial objects, since these are directly measurable, while Bond <b>albedos</b> must be calculated and require {{knowledge of the}} hemispheric phase integral. Airless bodies usually have Bond <b>albedos</b> that are lower than their geometric <b>albedos.</b>|$|R

5|$|In 1997, {{observations}} from Earth {{were made of}} Triton's limb as it passed in front of stars. These observations indicated {{the presence of a}} denser atmosphere than was deduced from Voyager 2 data. Other observations have shown an increase in temperature by 5% from 1989 to 1998. These observations indicate Triton is approaching an unusually warm summer season that happens only once every few hundred years. Theories for this warming include a change of frost patterns on Triton's surface and a change in ice <b>albedo,</b> which would allow more heat to be absorbed. Another theory argues the changes in temperature are a result of deposition of dark, red material from geological processes. Because Triton's Bond <b>albedo</b> is among the highest within the Solar System, it is sensitive to small variations in spectral <b>albedo.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lunar swirls are enigmatic {{features}} found {{across the}} Moon's surface, which {{are characterized by}} a high <b>albedo,</b> appearing optically immature (i.e. the optical characteristics of a relatively young regolith), and often displaying a sinuous shape.

40|$|Part of {{the urban}} heat island effect can be {{attributed}} to dark pavements that are commonly used on streets and parking lots. In this paper we consider two light colored, hence cooler, alternative paving materials that are in actual use in cities today. These are Portland cement concrete (PCC) pavements and chip seals. We report measurements of the <b>albedos</b> of some PCC and chip sealed pavements in the San Francisco Bay Area. The <b>albedos</b> of the PCC pavements ranged from about 0. 18 to 0. 35. The temperatures of some PCC pavements are also measured and calculated. We then consider how the <b>albedos</b> of the constituent materials of the PCC (stone, sand and cement) contribute to the <b>albedos</b> of the resulting finished concrete. The <b>albedos</b> of a set of chip sealed pavements in San Jose, CA, were measured and correlated with the times of their placement. It is found that the <b>albedos</b> decrease with age (and use) but remain higher than that of standard asphalt concrete (AC) for about five years. After t hat, the <b>albedos</b> of the chip seals are about 0. 12, similar to aged AC. The fact that many PCC pavements have <b>albedos</b> at least twice as high as aged AC suggests {{that it is possible to}} have pavement <b>albedos</b> that remain high for many years...|$|R

We present diameters and <b>albedos</b> calculated from observations {{taken during the}} second year since the spacecraft was reactivated in late 2013. These include 207 near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) and 8885 other asteroids. Of the NEAs, 84 % NEAs did not have previously measured diameters and <b>albedos</b> by the NEOWISE mission. Comparison of sizes and <b>albedos</b> calculated from NEOWISE measurements with those measured by occultations, spacecraft, and radar-derived shapes shows accuracy consistent with previous NEOWISE publications. Diameters and <b>albedos</b> fall within ±~ 20 % and ±~ 40 %, 1 -sigma, respectively, of those measured by these alternate techniques.

40|$|Diameters and {{geometric}} <b>albedos</b> {{are derived}} from 10 - and 20 -micron infrared photometry for 84 asteroids, 68 of them not previously observed in this program of asteroid radiometry.

5|$|The Federation fleet try {{to destroy}} the Kukai base as {{it appears to be}} the source of the Song, but Wilhelm—who has been {{secretly}} observing events—arrives with a private fleet that destroys the Gnosis and protects the base. KOS-MOS then uses an advanced weapon to detect the Song's source in a cloaked spaceship. Boarding the spaceship, the group rescue MOMO and fight <b>Albedo,</b> but are stopped by a blue-cloaked man who allows <b>Albedo</b> to escape with a piece of data extracted from MOMO that could grant access to Miltia. <b>Albedo</b> then summons Proto Merkebah, a research ship created by Mizrahi to summon U-DO, and destroys the Federation fleet before aiming Proto Merkebah's weapons at Second Miltia's capital. The blue-cloaked man—revealed to be a resurrected Virgil—observes events before being summoned away. Shion's group infiltrates Proto Markebah and destroys its core while <b>Albedo</b> flees. Escaping Proto Merkebah as it self-destructs, KOS-MOS shields the damaged Elsa as it enters Second Miltia's atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|The {{rings are}} made of an {{extremely}} dark material. The geometric <b>albedo</b> of the ring particles does not exceed 5–6%, while the Bond <b>albedo</b> is even lower—about 2%. The rings particles demonstrate a steep opposition surge—an increase of the <b>albedo</b> when the phase angle is close to zero. This means that their <b>albedo</b> is much lower when they are observed slightly off the opposition. The rings are slightly red in the ultraviolet and visible parts of the spectrum and grey in near-infrared. They exhibit no identifiable spectral features. The chemical composition of the ring particles is not known. However, they cannot be made of pure water ice like the rings of Saturn because they are too dark, darker than the inner moons of Uranus. This indicates that they are probably composed of a mixture of the ice and a dark material. The nature of this material is not clear, {{but it may be}} organic compounds considerably darkened by the charged particle irradiation from the Uranian magnetosphere. The rings' particles may consist of a heavily processed material which was initially {{similar to that of the}} inner moons.|$|E
5|$|The {{size of a}} Solar System object can be deduced {{from its}} optical magnitude, its distance, and its <b>albedo.</b> Objects appear bright to Earth {{observers}} either because they are large or because they are highly reflective. If their reflectivity (<b>albedo)</b> can be ascertained, then a rough estimate can be made of their size. For most distant objects, the <b>albedo</b> is unknown, but Haumea is large and bright enough for its thermal emission to be measured, which has given an approximate value for its <b>albedo</b> and thus its size. However, the calculation of its dimensions is complicated by its rapid rotation. The rotational physics of deformable bodies predicts that over {{as little as a}} hundred days, a body rotating as rapidly as Haumea will have been distorted into the equilibrium form of a triaxial ellipsoid. It is thought that most of the fluctuation in Haumea's brightness is caused not by local differences in <b>albedo</b> but by the alternation of the side view and end view as seen from Earth.|$|E

Using stereoscopic pairs of the 70 mm photographs, the vegetation was classified into sub-formations. Marked differences in the 'sub-formation' <b>albedos</b> were observed. A two-way table using stand height and crown cover of the sub-formations clearly showed a very distinctive trend of <b>albedos.</b> This finding may be important in other vegetal studies...|$|R
5|$|Although to date most KBOs still appear spectrally featureless due {{to their}} faintness, {{there have been a}} number of successes in {{determining}} their composition. In 1996, Robert H. Brown et al. acquired spectroscopic data on the KBO 1993 SC, which revealed that its surface composition is markedly similar to that of Pluto, as well as Neptune's moon Triton, with large amounts of methane ice. For the smaller objects, only colors and in some cases the <b>albedos</b> have been determined. These objects largely fall into two classes: gray with low <b>albedos,</b> or very red with higher <b>albedos.</b> The difference in colors and <b>albedos</b> is hypothesized to be due to the retention or the loss of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) on the surface of these objects, with the surfaces of those that formed far enough from the Sun to retain H2S being reddened due to irradiation.|$|R
40|$|The ERBE {{algorithm}} {{is applied to}} the Nimbus- 7 earth radiation budget (ERB) scanner data for June 1979 to analyze the performance of an inversion method in deriving top-of-atmosphere <b>albedos</b> and longwave radiative fluxes. The performance is assessed by comparing ERBE algorithm results with appropriate results derived using the sorting-by-angular-bins (SAB) method, the ERB MATRIX algorithm, and the 'new-cloud ERB' (NCLE) algorithm. Comparisons are made for top-of-atmosphere <b>albedos,</b> longwave fluxes, viewing zenith-angle dependence of derived <b>albedos</b> and longwave fluxes, and cloud fractional coverage. Using the SAB method as a reference, the rms accuracy of monthly average ERBE-derived results are estimated to be 0. 0165 (5. 6 W/sq m) for <b>albedos</b> (shortwave fluxes) and 3. 0 W/sq m for longwave fluxes. The ERBE-derived results were found to depend systematically on the viewing zenith angle, varying from near nadir to near the limb by about 10 percent for <b>albedos</b> and by 6 - 7 percent for longwave fluxes. Analyses indicated that the ERBE angular models are the most likely source of the systematic angular dependences. Comparison of the ERBE-derived cloud fractions, based on a maximum-likelihood estimation method, with results from the NCLE showed agreement within about 10 percent...|$|R
5|$|Unlike the {{somewhat}} reddish Pluto and Triton, Eris appears almost white. Pluto's reddish color {{is thought to}} be due to deposits of tholins on its surface, and where these deposits darken the surface, the lower <b>albedo</b> leads to higher temperatures and the evaporation of methane deposits. In contrast, Eris is far enough from the Sun that methane can condense onto its surface even where the <b>albedo</b> is low. The condensation of methane uniformly over the surface reduces any <b>albedo</b> contrasts and would cover up any deposits of red tholins.|$|E
5|$|White roofs: Painting rooftops {{white has}} become a common {{strategy}} to reduce the heat island effect.

5|$|Irregular moons {{are small}} {{satellites}} with large-radii, inclined, and frequently retrograde orbits, {{believed to have}} been acquired by the parent planet through a capture process. They often occur as collisional families or groups. The precise size as well as <b>albedo</b> of the irregular moons are not known for sure because the moons are very small to be resolved by a telescope, although the latter is usually assumed to be quite low—around 6% (<b>albedo</b> of Phoebe) or less. The irregulars generally have featureless visible and near infrared spectra dominated by water absorption bands. They are neutral or moderately red in color—similar to C-type, P-type, or D-type asteroids, though they are much less red than Kuiper belt objects.|$|E
5|$|Mars is a {{terrestrial}} planet {{that consists of}} minerals containing silicon and oxygen, metals, and other elements that typically make up rock.

Geometric <b>albedos</b> and radii for the six objects are derived from the corrected monochromatic fluxes and visual magnitudes.

40|$|Exoplanet {{research}} {{focusing on}} the characterization of super-Earths is currently limited to those handful targets orbiting bright stars that are amenable to detailed study. This Letter proposes to look at alternative avenues to probe the surface and atmospheric properties of this category of planets, known to be ubiquitous in our galaxy. I conduct Markov Chain Monte Carlo lightcurve analyses for 97 Kepler close-in R_P ≲ 2. 0 R_⊕ super-Earth candidates with the aim to detect their occultations at visible wavelengths. Brightness temperatures and geometric <b>albedos</b> in the Kepler bandpass are constrained for 27 super-Earth candidates. A hierarchical Bayesian modeling approach is then employed to characterize the population-level reflective properties of these close-in super-Earths. I find median geometric <b>albedos</b> A_g in the Kepler bandpass ranging between 0. 16 and 0. 30, once decontaminated from thermal emission. These super-Earths geometric <b>albedos</b> are statistically larger than for hot Jupiters, which have medians A_g ranging between 0. 06 and 0. 11. A subset of objects, including Kepler- 10 b, exhibit significantly larger <b>albedos</b> (A_g≳ 0. 4).

5|$|Umbriel's {{surface is}} the darkest of the Uranian moons, and {{reflects}} {{less than half}} as much light as Ariel, a sister satellite of similar size. Umbriel has a very low Bond <b>albedo</b> of only about 10% as compared to 23% for Ariel. The reflectivity of the moon's surface decreases from 26% at a phase angle of 0° (geometric <b>albedo)</b> to 19% at an angle of about 1°. This phenomenon is called opposition surge. The surface of Umbriel is slightly blue in color, while fresh bright impact deposits (in Wunda crater, for instance) are even bluer. There may be an asymmetry between the leading and trailing hemispheres; the former appears to be redder than the latter. The reddening of the surfaces probably results from space weathering from bombardment by charged particles and micrometeorites {{over the age of}} the Solar System. However, the color asymmetry of Umbriel is likely caused by accretion of a reddish material coming from outer parts of the Uranian system, possibly, from irregular satellites, which would occur predominately on the leading hemisphere. The surface of Umbriel is relatively homogeneous—it does not demonstrate strong variation in either <b>albedo</b> or color.|$|E
