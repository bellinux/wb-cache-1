One of the main study groups is represented by the ISBD/XML Study Group, formed in 2008. The paper describes the activities developing a representation of International Standard Bibliographic Description (ISBD) in Resource Description Framework (RDF) : the research, technical, and administrative activities undertaken to make bibliographic metadata authorized by the IFLA standard available to the Semantic Web as trustworthy information. The paper discusses the ongoing representation of elements in RDF in the ISBD namespace, the treatment of <b>aggregated</b> <b>statements</b> composed of multiple elements, {{and the development of a}} Dublin Core Application Profile for ISBD. An introduction to recent initiatives within IFLA to develop representation of its models and standards in RDF, as well as an administrative and technical infrastructure to support such initiatives will be given as a background to the work on ISBD.

40|$|Ranking {{methods are}} {{fundamental}} tools in many areas. Popular methods <b>aggregate</b> the <b>statements</b> of `experts' in different ways. As such, {{there are various}} reasonable ranking methods, {{each one of them}} more or less adapted to the environment under consideration. This paper introduces a new method, called the handicap-based method, and characterizes it through appealing properties. This method assigns not only scores to the items but also weights to the experts. Scores and weights form an equilibrium for a relationship based on the notion of handicaps. The method is, in a sense made precise in the paper, the counterpart to the counting method in environments that require intensity-invariance. Intensity-invariance is a desirable property when the intensity of the experts' statements has to be controlled. Otherwise, both the counting and handicap-based methods satisfy a property called homogeneity, which is a desirable property when cardinal statements matter, {{as is the case in}} many applications...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: A {{systematic}} {{review of the}} literature was conducted. The review was conducted using a search of the literature for all years up to October 2016.

By improving training programs that address the attitudes and beliefs which facilitate or block delivery of smoking cessation and by implementing systemic changes within cancer centres, delivery of smoking cessation should be enable...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Semantic Web {{technologies}} facilitate {{data integration}} {{over a large}} number of sources with decentralised and loose coordination, ideally leading to interlinked datasets which describe objects, their attributes and links to other objects. Such information spaces are amenable to queries that go beyond traditional keyword search over documents. To this end, we present a formal query model comprising six atomic operations over object-structured datasets: keyword search, object navigation, facet selection, path traversal, projection, and sorting. Using these atomic operations, users can incrementally assemble complex queries that yield a set of objects or trees of objects as result. Results can then be either directly displayed or exported to application programs or online services. We report on user experiments carried out during the design phase of the system, and present performance results for a range of queries over 18. 5 m <b>statements</b> <b>aggregated</b> from 70 k sources. ...|$|R

40|$|Air quality {{planning}} in Central California is complicated and controversial despite {{millions of dollars}} invested to improve scientific understanding. This research describes and critiques the use of photochemical air quality simulation modeling studies in planning to attain standards for ground-level ozone in the San Francisco Bay Area and the San Joaquin Valley during the 1990 's. Data are gathered through documents and interviews with planners, modelers, and policy-makers at public agencies and with representatives from the regulated and environmental communities. Interactions amongst organizations are diagramed to identify significant nodes of interaction. Dominant policy coalitions are described through narratives distinguished by their uses of and responses to uncertainty, their exposures to risks, and their responses {{to the principles of}} conservatism, civil duty, and caution. Policy narratives are delineated using <b>aggregated</b> respondent <b>statements</b> to describe and understand advocacy coalitions. I found that models impacted the planning process significantly, but were used not purely for their scientific capabilities. Modeling results provided justification for decisions based on other constraints and political considerations. Uncertainties were utilized opportunistically by stakeholders instead of managed explicitly. Ultimately, the process supported the partisan views of those in control of the modeling. Based on these findings, as well as a review of model uncertainty analysis capabilities, I recommend modifying the planning process to allow for the development and incorporation of uncertainty information, while addressing the need for inclusive and meaningful public participation. By documenting an actual air {{quality planning}} process these findings provide insights about the potential for using new scientific information and understanding to achieve environmental goals, most notably the analysis of uncertainties in modeling applications. Concurrently, needed uncertainty information is identified and capabilities to produce it are assessed. Practices to facilitate incorporation of uncertainty information are suggested based on research findings, as well as theory from the literatures of the policy sciences, decision sciences, science and technology studies, consensus-based and communicative planning, and modeling...|$|R

40|$|The IASB Discussion Paper (2008), Preliminary Views on Financial Statement Presentation {{promises}} {{to extend the}} 'fair value' measurement concept into an <b>aggregated</b> comprehensive income <b>statement.</b> This article extends prior Anglo-Saxon based research by using 56, 700 European firm years from sixteen countries and by examining valuation, prediction and conservatism issues. Findings show net income dominates aggregated comprehensive income as a shareholder valuation metric and in predicting cash flows. Results are robust to pooled and country specific regressions, controls for non-linearities, the impact of reporting incentives, and the underlying accounting framework (local GAAP, US GAAP, IFRS). Aggregated comprehensive income also switches the conservative attributes of income towards a more timely recognition of good news over bad news, thus reducing the agency contracting role for debt. Disaggregated components of comprehensive income, however, do provide incremental situation specific information; the available-for-sale securities component for the general investor and revaluation reserves and exchange rate translations for financial analysts for their price revisions. Our research offers several contributions to the policy debate. The functional aggregation of income that mixes operating capital increments with unrealised gains and with realised historic net income introduces considerable noise and reduces {{the utility of the}} contracting role. The agenda item for the IASB should consider how to disaggregate and report income by event nature with a clear delineation on capital increments, permanence of income, and unrealised financial gains. These issues are especially important in Continental Europe reliant to a greater extent on debt capital and with an under-developed corpus of financial analysts...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to develop the first multidimensional measure of {{financial}} statement comparability. This measure is based on the disaggregated financial accounting components of earnings, and is constructed by applying a finer-earnings component approach (per Lipe 1986) to a popular financial statement comparability framework (De Franco et al. 2011; Barth et al. 2012). This study solves a previous limitation of the academic literature, while simultaneously recognizing information disaggregation theory and practical application. The multidimensional financial statement comparability measure in this paper is contrasted with the one-dimensional (i. e., based solely on <b>aggregate</b> earnings) financial <b>statement</b> comparability measure used in prior studies. The multidimensional approach allows for the measurement of comparability between two firms across several dimensions and allows for contrast-based analyses across companies. This framework not only more-informatively captures economic effects as they affect one company, but also enhances the ability to contrast that company’s accounting system to that of other companies impacted by similar economic effects. Further, using a finer, multidimensional measure of financial statement comparability results in the ability to identify the underlying financial statement line items influencing the comparability of cross-company financial statements. This comparability measure is robust to a rigorous set of analyses, including tests of incremental informativeness, alternative specifications of comparability, and considerations regarding information environment. Overall, relationships among firms’ financial statements appear more complex than aggregate-earnings based measures of comparability may suggest. The metric developed in this study will be useful in future research based on its ability to capture and accommodate financial reporting within the comparability framework. ...|$|R

40|$|Recently {{there have}} been a growing number of studies of the “money announcement” phenomenon. Towards the end of the week, the U. S. Federal Reserve Board announces its {{estimates}} of the narrowly defined monetary <b>aggregate</b> for the <b>statement</b> week ending some eight to ten days previously. The tendency for interest rates and other financial prices to respond to these “money announcements” has been well established. The importance of this phenomenon rests on the test it provides for the effect of monetary policy on real variables. However, existing tests incorporate at least two key assumptions. Firstly, that the Money Market Services, Inc. survey of market participants expectations is the best predictor (i. e., the rational expectation) of the weekly money announcement. Secondly, that the money announcement itself is the best predictor (i. e., the rational expectation) of the “true” change in the money supply (in practice, the true money supply is taken to be the final estimate after several data revisions). The analysis in this paper shows that both of these assumptions are rejected by the data. Readily available information can be used to improve upon both the Money Market Services forecast of the announcement and the Fed’s own preliminary estimate of the “true” money supply change. This information is used to estimate rational expectations of the change in the money stock, both with respect to information available just before the announcement and that available just after the announcement. Appropriate econometric techniques are used with these “generated regressors” to obtain consistent and efficient estimates of the announcement effect on short-term interest rates. This enables tests to be calculated to determine whether this effect, and/or the structure of the forecasts, change in response to changes in Fed policy or in its measurement of the announced monetary data. ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{the present}} paper we carry out a revision, on a {{theoretical}} level, of the principal aspects that have a major influence in the international accounting harmonization process and which are the principal differences in the income statement in the different Spanish general accounting plans and {{the differences between the}} income statement in the International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) for Small and Medium-sized Entities (SMEs) and in the General Spanish Accounting Plan 2007 for SMEs. During of the development of the paper we have analyzed the international accounting regulation and the pgc in relation to the SMEs that we think that they are fundamental in all the countries. We consider a first stage in which the directives were issued and the national regulations adapted to them. In Order to analyzing the different changes that have taken place the income statement along the history from the General Accounting Plan (GAP) from 1973 to 2007 in Spain. With the approval of the GAP Spain embarked upon the modern-day trend of accounting standardization. Summarizing in relation to the income statement we could have observed that there exist significant differences between both regulations being the most important is that in the IFRS for SMEs an entity either a single statement of comprehensive income for the reporting period displaying all items of income and expense recognized during the period including those items recognized in determining profit or loss (which is a subtotal in the statement of comprehensive income) and items of other comprehensive income, or a separate income statement and a separate statement of comprehensive income. If an entity chooses to present both an income statement and a statement of comprehensive income, the statement of comprehensive income begins with profit or loss and then displays the items of other comprehensive income and in the General Spanish Accounting Plan 2007 for SMEs in a single income statement where the expenses are <b>aggregated</b> in the <b>statement</b> of comprehensive income according to their nature. By the IFRS for SMEs an entity shall present an analysis of expenses using classification based on either the nature of expenses or the function of expenses within the entity, whichever provides information that is reliable and more relevant.

40|$|The paper {{represents}} {{an overview of}} masonry mortars designated for walls made of small-size masonry units. The authors argue that regular mortars cannot demonstrate uniform heat transfer performance. Regular mortar walling has cold bridges. Cement-sand mortars have high cement and water consumption rates that boost mortar shrinkage and creep. The paper also demonstrates that no surface effects or contact interaction between the cement grout and {{the surface of the}} sand and other aggregates are taken into consideration in connection with the above <b>statement.</b> <b>Aggregates</b> added to the mortar have a highly developed surface; they also feature a substantial supply of free energy. The authors believe that the extrusion method can make it possible to employ the free energy to improve the strength and other properties of the material in the course of formation of its structure. This process may also improve the moistening and the adhesive strength of particles; it draws the cement particles as close to one another as it may be possible, it cleans their surface and extracts any excessive water out of the mix. The paper also presents the results of the research of the microstructure of spilt Portland cement and hollow glass spheres, their mineral and chemical analyses, as well as the properties of masonry mortars. The paper presents a conclusion that their high process-dependent parameters and superior operating performance are attainable through the introduction of effective hollow glass spheres into masonry mortars and the application of the extrusion method. The aforementioned novelties may reduce the water consumption rate, improve the strength, freeze resistance and durability of cement mortars. The preparation of this paper involved the study of nine reference books. This paper is the first {{one of a series of}} papers covering the method of extrusion of lightweight cement mortars.
