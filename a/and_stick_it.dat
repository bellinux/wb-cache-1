500|$|The episode also {{featured}} {{the deaths of}} several recurring characters in the series. Faye Marsay, who portrayed the Waif, spoke about her participation in the episode, and leaving Game of Thrones after several seasons, saying [...] "As much as I'm sad that I'm now off of the show, I think that storyline needed to be concluded that way. I'm rooting for Arya and Maisie as well. Even though I won't be able {{to hang out with}} everyone again, I think it was done right and done properly. I think Arya deserved to rip off her face <b>and</b> <b>stick</b> <b>it</b> on a wall." [...] Recurring guest actors Clive Russell as Blackfish, and Essie Davis as Lady Crane portrayed their characters for the last time in the series, as they were killed off on screen.|$|E
500|$|Although {{he was a}} striker, Dickov {{was better}} known for his {{tenacity}} than his goal-scoring exploits. In a 2003 interview with the Independent on Sunday he provided a summary of his playing style: [...] "The ability to battle {{is one of the}} main parts of my game. I know my limits. I am not the sort who gets the ball and is then going to beat five or six players <b>and</b> <b>stick</b> <b>it</b> in the top corner from God knows where. But, whether I'm playing well or not, the one thing you will get from me is 110 per cent, upsetting defenders and basically giving them pain." [...] Rio Ferdinand was mentioning his name as the biggest headache to deal with on the pitch. His combative approach resulted in Manchester City manager Joe Royle naming him [...] "The Wasp", and during his time at Leicester he was known as [...] "The Pest".|$|E
500|$|Both my divisional {{generals and}} brigadiers have {{represented}} {{to me that}} they fear their men are thoroughly demoralised by shrapnel fire to which they have been subjected all day after exhaustion and gallant work in morning. Numbers have dribbled back from the firing line and cannot be collected in this difficult country. Even New Zealand Brigade which has only recently been engaged lost heavily and is to some extent demoralised. If troops are subjected to shellfire again tomorrow morning there {{is likely to be a}} fiasco, as I have no fresh troops with which to replace those in firing line. I know my representation is most serious, but if we are to re-embark it must be at once. Hamilton conferred with his naval commanders, who convinced him an evacuation would be almost impossible, and responded; [...] "dig yourselves right in <b>and</b> <b>stick</b> <b>it</b> out... dig, dig, dig until you are safe". The survivors had to fight on alone until 28 April when four battalions of the Royal Naval Division were attached to the corps.|$|E

[...] "Rex" [...] Lewis / The Doctor / Cobra Commander [...] The Baroness's brother, {{a former}} soldier who {{was thought to}} have been killed during a mission led by Duke [...] instead, he became the {{disfigured}} head scientist of Military Armament Research Syndicate (MARS). USA Today reported that Gordon-Levitt would play multiple roles. He wore prosthetic makeup under a mask that was redesigned from the comics because the crew found it too reminiscent of the Ku Klux Klan. Upon seeing concept art of the character, Gordon-Levitt signed on because; [...] "I was like, 'I get to be that? You're going to make that [...] in real life <b>and</b> <b>stick</b> <b>it</b> on me? Cool. Let me do it.' That's a once-in-lifetime opportunity." [...] Gordon-Levitt is a friend of Tatum and they co-starred in Stop-Loss and Havoc. His casting provided extra incentive for Tatum to join the film. Gordon-Levitt described his vocal performance as being [...] "half reminiscent" [...] of Chris Latta's voice for the , but also half his own ideas, because he felt rendering it fully would sound ridiculous.|$|E
500|$|At about dawn on October 26, {{the card}} game broke up and Behan and Virgil Earp {{went home to}} bed.

Not having rented a room, Tom McLaury and Ike Clanton {{had no place to}} go. Shortly after 8:00 am barkeeper E. F. Boyle spoke to Ike Clanton in front of the {{telegraph}} office. Clanton had been drinking all night and Boyle encouraged him to get some sleep, but Ike insisted he would not go to bed. Boyle later testified he noticed Ike was armed and covered his gun for him. Boyle later said that Ike told him, [...] "'As soon as the Earps and Doc Holliday showed themselves on the street, the ball would open—that they would have to fight'...I went down to Wyatt Earp's house and told him that Ike Clanton had threatened that when him and his brothers and Doc Holliday showed themselves on the street that the ball would open." [...] Ike said in his testimony afterward that he remembered neither meeting Boyle nor making any such statements that day.|$|E
500|$|Jiangshi, {{sometimes}} called [...] "Chinese vampires" [...] by Westerners, are corpses {{that are usually}} reanimated due to magical reasons. In ancient China, people always had the preference of being buried in their hometowns, and when a person dies in a land that is not their hometown, their family members hire a sorcerer to bring back their deceased family member. The family commissions the sorcerer in their village {{to travel to the}} place of the person's death, locate the corpse, and to write a spell <b>and</b> <b>stick</b> <b>it</b> upon the corpses's face, in which the spell-paper contains their name, birthdate, and some other words to reanimate the corpse. Once the paper is stuck upon the corpses's face, the newly created jiangshi would follow the sorcerer by hopping around, in which the sorcerer would lead it back to its hometown for burial (this was often a last-resort choice used by families with not enough money to hire a cart to carry the corpse back). Usually, the sorcerer would travel by night, and would at least have around three jiangshi traveling with it. But when the written spell-paper falls or is pulled off of the jiangshi (in the case the sorcerer is not paid the agreed amount for his doings, he might rip off the jiangshi's spell-paper), it gains its own consciousness, and all the power that the sorcerer formerly had over it would be lost. Instead of being an obedient corpse that followed the sorcerer, the jiangshi would be rampant and dangerous. The freed jiangshi would begin killing living creatures to absorb life essence (qì) from their victims. They are said to be created when a person's soul (魄 pò) fails to leave the deceased's body.|$|E

A vast deal of coolness, and a peculiar degree of judgment, are requisite in catching a hat. A man must not be precipitate, or he runs over it; he must not rush into the opposite extreme, or he loses it altogether. The best way is to keep gently up with the object of pursuit, to be wary and cautious, to watch your opportunity well, get gradually before it, then make a rapid dive, seize it by the crown, <b>and</b> <b>stick</b> <b>it</b> firmly on your head; smiling pleasantly all the time, as if you thought it as good a joke as anybody else.|$|E

And there he had hung up his pea-jacket on a nail, in a little room next to the kitchen, and there his mother had found it, and sewed on two buttons, and sewed up the rips in the bottoms of two pockets. Shortly after this, the sailor, happening to pass a post-office box, remembered the letter he had brought to England. He went to his pea-jacket and searched it, but could find no letter.
