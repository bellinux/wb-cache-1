25|$|Pizzelle - {{traditional}} Italian waffle cookies {{made from}} flour, eggs, sugar, butter or oil, and flavoring (usually anise or <b>anisette,</b> less commonly vanilla or lemon zest). Originally from Abruzzo, brought {{over to the}} United States by Abruzzese immigrants. Popular during Christmas in the Northeastern United States among Italian-Americans and especially in Philadelphia and other cities where large numbers of Abruzzese immigrants settled.|$|E
25|$|While his {{painting}} career continued successfully through this period, as {{part owner of}} a bar Casas engaged heavily in graphic design, adopting the art nouveau style that would come to define modernisme. He designed posters for the café, many of which depicted Romeu's gaunt visage. He also executed a series of advertisements for Codorniu, a brand of cava (or, as its ads of the time claimed, champagne) and <b>anisette.</b> Over the next decade, he would design poster ads for everything from cigarette papers to the Enciclopèdia Espasa.|$|E
25|$|Reality in this Albee play is {{something}} that most of its characters try to escape. The most obvious escape route is through alcohol. Its presence is so entwined in the dialogue that it becomes almost a character itself. Every scene revolves around the bar and decanters of brandy, cognac, <b>anisette,</b> and gin. Claire is alcohol’s most wounded victim, but she is also the one who, although she has the most trouble dealing with reality, sees reality the clearest. Tobias is not as ruled by alcohol but uses it to calm himself enough to maintain his patience and usual silence.|$|E
60|$|Once {{he drank}} of it, and again, {{and then again}} until he felt a strange, exalted sense of non-participation in worldly affairs pervade him. Tansey was no drinker; his {{consumption}} of three absinthe <b>anisettes</b> within almost as few minutes proclaimed his unproficiency in the art; Tansey was merely flooding with unproven liquor his sorrows; which record and tradition alleged to be drownable.|$|R
50|$|The {{defining}} {{feature of}} the Sazerac is its method of preparation, which commonly involves two chilled old-fashioned glasses. The first glass is swirled with a wash of absinthe for its flavor and strong scent. The second glass is used to combine the remaining ingredients, which are stirred with ice, then strained into the first glass. Various <b>anisettes</b> such as pastis, Pernod, or Herbsaint are common substitutes when absinthe is unavailable. In New Orleans, Herbsaint is most commonly used due {{to the absence of}} absinthe in the U.S. market from 1912 until 2007.|$|R

500|$|The {{hotel has}} several bars, namely the Ritz Bar, Bar Vendôme, Bar Hemingway and the Pool Bar. The Ritz Bar, {{just inside the}} Rue Cambon {{entrance}} on the left, gained a reputation over the years for its glamorous cocktail parties and the unique bartending skills of Frank Meier, head barman from 1921 {{until his death in}} 1947. One of his best-known cocktails was the potent [...] "Rainbow", consisting of <b>anisette,</b> mint, yellow chartreuse, cherry brandy, kümmel, green chartreuse and cognac. The Ritz Bar is designed in the Victorian style with red-velvet armchairs and bar furnishings, a marble fireplace and historic portraits. The Ritz Bar may have been the world's first hotel bar.|$|E

"Dry curaçao, for instance, {{was like}} the {{clarinet}} with its shrill, velvety note: kümmel like the oboe, whose timbre is sonorous and nasal; crème de menthe and <b>anisette</b> like the flute, at {{one and the same}} time sweet and poignant, whining and soft. Then to complete the orchestra, comes kirsch, blowing a wild trumpet blast; gin and whisky, deafening the palate with their harsh outbursts of cornets and trombones:liqueur brandy, blaring with the overwhelming crash of the tubas." ...|$|E

60|$|This is a {{very old}} scandal, yet I think there was an habitué of the caffè in Bassano who could have given some of its {{particulars}} from personal recollection. He was an old and smoothly shaven gentleman, in a scrupulously white waistcoat, whom we saw every evening {{in a corner of}} the caffè playing solitaire. He talked with no one, saluted no one. He drank his glasses of water with <b>anisette,</b> and silently played solitaire. There is no good reason to doubt that he had been doing the same thing every evening for six hundred years.|$|E
6000|$|The French milliner, who {{occupies}} {{one of the}} corners, {{begins to}} remove the greasy pieces of paper which have enveloped her locks during the journey. She withdraws the [...] "Madras" [...] of dubious hue which has bound her head for the last five-and-twenty hours, and replaces it by the black velvet bonnet, which, bobbing against your nose, has hung from the Diligence roof since your departure from Boulogne. The old lady in the opposite corner, who has been sucking bonbons, and smells dreadfully of <b>anisette,</b> arranges her little parcels in that immense basket of abominations which all old women carry in their laps. She rubs her mouth and eyes with her dusty cambric handkerchief, she ties up her nightcap into a little bundle, and replaces it by a more becoming head-piece, covered with withered artificial flowers, and crumpled tags of ribbon; she looks wistfully at the company for an instant, and then places her handkerchief before her mouth:--her eyes roll strangely about for an instant, and you hear a faint clattering noise: the old lady has been getting ready her teeth, which had lain in her basket among the bonbons, pins, oranges, pomatum, bits of cake, lozenges, prayer-books, peppermint-water, copper money, and false hair--stowed away there during the voyage. The Jewish gentleman, who has been so attentive to the milliner during the journey, and is a traveller and bagman by profession, gathers together his various goods. The sallow-faced English lad, who has been drunk ever since we left Boulogne yesterday, and is coming to Paris to pursue the study of medicine, swears that he rejoices to leave the cursed Diligence, is sick of the infernal journey, and d--d glad that the d--d voyage is so nearly over. [...] "Enfin!" [...] says your neighbor, yawning, and inserting an elbow {{into the mouth of}} his right and left hand companion, [...] "nous voilà." ...|$|E
6000|$|The lasagnone is a loafer, as an Italian {{can be a}} loafer, {{without the}} {{admixture}} of ruffianism, which blemishes most loafers of northern race. He may be quite worthless, and even impertinent, but he cannot be a rowdy,-- that pleasing blossom on the nose of our fast, high-fed, thick-blooded civilization. In Venice he must not be confounded with other loiterers at the caffè; not with the natty people who talk politics interminably over little cups of black coffee; not with those old habitués, who sit forever under the Procuratie, their hands folded upon the tops of their sticks, and staring at the ladies who pass with a curious steadfastness and knowing skepticism of gaze, not pleasing in the dim eyes of age; certainly, the last persons who bear any likeness to the lasagnone are the Germans, with their honest, heavy faces comically anglicized by leg-of- mutton whiskers. The truth is, the lasagnone does not flourish in the best caffè; he comes to perfection in cheaper resorts, for he is commonly not rich. It often happens that a glass of water, flavored with a little <b>anisette,</b> is the order over which he sits a whole evening. He knows the waiter intimately, and does not call him [...] "Shop!" [...] (Bottega,) as less familiar people do, but Gigi, or Beppi, as the waiter is pretty sure to be named. [...] "Behold!" [...] he says, when the servant places his modest drink before him, [...] "who is that loveliest blonde there?" [...] Or to his fellow-lasagnone: [...] "She regards me! I have broken her the heart!" [...] This is his sole business and mission, the cruel lasagnone--to break ladies the heart. He spares no condition,--neither rank nor wealth is any defense against him. I often wonder what is in that note he continually shows to his friend. The confession of some broken heart, I think. When he has folded it, and put it away, he chuckles [...] "Ah, cara!" [...] and sucks at his long, slender Virginia cigar. It is unlighted, for fire consumes cigars. I never see him read the papers,--neither the Italian papers nor the Parisian journals, though {{if he can get}} [...] "Galignani" [...] he is glad, and he likes to pretend to a knowledge of English, uttering upon occasion, with great relish, such distinctively English words as [...] "Yes" [...] and [...] "Not," [...] and to the waiter, [...] "A- little-fire-if-you-please." [...] He sits very late in the caffè, and he touches his hat--his curly French hat--to the company as he goes out with a mild swagger, his cane held lightly in his left hand, his coat cut snugly to show his hips, and genteelly swaying with the motion of his body. He is a dandy, of course,--all Italians are dandies,--but his vanity is perfectly harmless, and his heart is not bad. He would go half an hour {{out of his way to}} put you in the direction of the Piazza. A little thing can make him happy,--to stand in the pit at the opera, and gaze at the ladies in the lower boxes--to attend the Marionette, or the Malibran Theatre, and imperil the peace of pretty seamstresses and contadinas--to stand at the church doors and ogle the fair saints as they pass out. Go, harmless lasagnone, to thy lodging in some mysterious height, and break hearts if thou wilt. They are quickly mended.|$|E
50|$|<b>Anisette,</b> or Anis, is an anise-flavored liqueur that is {{consumed}} in most Mediterranean countries, mainly in Spain, Italy, Portugal, Turkey, Greece, Lebanon, Cyprus, Israel, and France. It is colorless, {{and because it}} contains sugar, is sweeter than dry anise flavoured spirits (e.g. absinthe). The most traditional style of <b>anisette</b> is that produced by means of distilling aniseed, and is differentiated from those produced by simple maceration by {{the inclusion of the}} word distilled on the label. And while Pastis is a similar-tasting liqueur that is prepared in similar fashion and sometimes confused with <b>anisette,</b> it employs a combination of both aniseed and licorice root extracts. Sambuca is essentially an <b>anisette</b> of Italian origin that requires a high minimum (350g/l) sugar content.|$|E

5000|$|The liqueur is not {{commonly}} taken {{straight on}} account of its strong flavour. When included in mixed drinks however, it produces a sweet agreeable flavour.
