40|$|Mesoscale {{convective}} {{processes and}} how they affect and interact with mid-latitude cyclones were studied. The ageostrophic and associated vertical motion field was calculated using a highly accurate iterative method of solving the semigeostrophic omega equation. The tendencies for convective destabilization in the 850 - 750 mb layer due to differential geostrophic and <b>ageostrophic</b> <b>advection</b> and differential moist adiabatic ascent, were found. The spectral models of the index oscillation, one barotropic and the other baroclinic, were developed. Theoretical and observational studies of cloud streets were conducted...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the combined isentropic and spherical geostrophic coordinate version of semigeostrophic theory. This {{is accomplished by}} first proposing a spherical coordinate generalization of the geostrophic momentum approximation and discussing its associated conservation principles for absolute angular momentum, total energy, potential vorticity and potential pseudodensity. We then show how {{the use of the}} spherical geostrophic coordinates allows the equations of the geostrophic momentum approximation to be written in a canonical form that makes <b>ageostrophic</b> <b>advection</b> implicit. This leads to a simple equation for the prediction of the potential pseudodensity. The potential pseudodensity can then be inverted to obtain the associated wind and mass fields. In this way the more general semigeostrophic theory retains the same simple mathematical structure as quasi-geostrophic theory—a single predictive equation which does not explicitly contain <b>ageostrophic</b> <b>advection</b> and an invertibility principle. The combined use of isentropic and spherical geostrophic coordinates is crucial to retaining this simplicity. In order to demonstrate how the theory applies to problems of barotropic–baroclinic instability and Rossby–Haurwitz wave dispersion, we derive the semigeostrophic generalization of the Charney–Stern theorem and compare the semigeostrophic Rossby–Haurwitz wave frequencies with those of Laplace's tidal equations. The agreement between these frequencies is generally better than 0. 5 %. Thus, the theory appears to encompass a wide range of meteorological phenomena including both planetary-scale and synoptic-scale waves, along with their finer scale aspects such as fronts and jets...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigate}} the interactions between two co-rotating vortices. These vortices are subject to rapid rotation and stable stratication such as are found in planetary atmospheres and oceans. By conducting {{a large number of}} simulations of vortex interactions, we intend to provide an overview of the interactions that could occur in geophysical turbulence. We consider a wide parameter space covering the vortices height-to-width aspect-ratios, their volume ratios and the vertical oset between them. The vor-tices are initially separated in the horizontal so that they reside at an estimated margin of stability. The vortices are then allowed to evolve for a period of ap-proximately 20 vortex revolutions. We nd that the most commonly observed interaction under the quasi-geostrophic (QG) regime is partial-merger, where only part of the smaller vortex is incorpor-ated into the larger, stronger vortex. On the other hand, a large number of la-mentary and small scale structures are generated during the interaction. We nd that, despite the proliferation of small-scale structures, the self-induced vortex en-ergy exhibits a mean `inverse-cascade ' to larger scale structures. Interestingly we observe a range of intermediate-scale structures that are preferentially sheared out during the interactions, leaving two vortex populations, one of large-scale vortices and one of small-scale vortices. We take a subset of the parameter space used for the QG study and perform i simulations using a non-hydrostatic model. This system, free of the layer-wise two-dimensional constraints and geostrophic balance of the QG model, allows for the generation of inertia-gravity waves and <b>ageostrophic</b> <b>advection.</b> The study of the interactions between two co-rotating, non-hydrostatic vortices is performed over four dierent Rossby numbers, two positive and two negative, allowing for the comparison of cyclonic and anti-cyclonic interactions. It is found that a greater amount of wave-like activity is generated during the interactions in anti-cyclonic situations. We also see distinct qualitative dierences between the in-teractions for cyclonic and anti-cyclonic regimes. i...|$|E
40|$|Abstract approved: Using rotated {{principal}} component analysis, 200 mb wind {{data from the}} First GARP Global Experiment are analyzed in the East Asia winter monsoon region. It is found that there exist slowly eastward-moving disturbances with a wind-speed maximum embedded in the jet stream jet streak). The implied vertical circulation that is transverse to the jet streak is thermally direct in the entrance region of jet streak and thermally indirect in the exit region. The Lagrangian momentum equation for transient part of the flow indicates that the magnitude of westerly acceleration of an air parcel moving through the jet streak {{is related to the}} Coriolis acceleration of the transient <b>ageostrophic</b> flow, the <b>advection</b> of mean momentum by transient flow and momentum conversion between mean and transient flow due to transient eddies. Estimates of terms in this equation In the entrance region of jet streak suggest that the increase of westerly momentum due to the Coriolis acceleration of the Redacted for Privacy ageostrophic flow is mostly balanced by the decrease due to the mean easterly momentum advection by the transient jet-streak flow. Thus, the confluence theory of Namias and Clapp (1949) appears to be valid for the slowly moving jet streaks in the East Asia jet stream...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} how coastal banks influence wind-driven circulation along stratified continental shelves. Numerical experiments are conducted for idealized symmetric banks; the standard bank (200 km long and 50 km wide) has dimensions {{similar to the}} Heceta Bank complex along the Oregon shelf. Model runs are forced with 10 days of steady winds (0. 1 Pa); upwelling and downwelling cases are compared. The bank introduces significant alongshelf variability in the currents and density fields. Upwelling-favorable winds create an upwelling front and a baroclinic jet (flowing opposite coastal-trapped wave propagation) that bend around the standard bank, approximately centered on the 90 -m isobath. The upwelling jet is strongest over the upstream bank half, where it advects a tongue of dense water over the bank. There is a current reversal shoreward of the main jet at the bank center. Upwelling is most intense over the upstream part of the bank, while there is reduced upwelling and even downwelling over other bank sections. Downwelling-favorable winds create a near-bottom density front and a baroclinic jet (flowing {{in the direction of}} coastal-trapped wave propagation) that bend around the standard bank; the jet core moves from the 150 -m isobath to the 100 -m isobath and back over the bank. The downwelling jet is slowest and widest over the bank; there are no current reversals. Results over the bank are more similar to 2 D results (that preclude alongshelf variability) than in the upwelling case. Downwelling is weakened over the bank. The density field evolution over the bank is fundamentally different from the upwelling case. Most model results for banks with different dimensions are qualitatively similar to the standard run. The exceptions are banks having a radius of curvature smaller than the inertial radius; the main jet remains detached from the coast far downstream from these banks. The lowest-order across-stream momentum balance indicates that the depth-averaged flow is geostrophic. <b>Advection,</b> <b>ageostrophic</b> pressure gradients, wind stress, and bottom stress are all important in the depth-averaged alongstream momentum balance over the bank. There is considerable variability in alongstream momentum balances over different bank sections. Across-shelf and alongshelf advection both change the density field over the bank. Barotropic potential vorticity is not conserved, but the tendency for relative vorticity changes and depth changes to partially counter each other results in differences between the upwelling and downwelling jet paths over the bank. Only certain areas of the bank have significant vertical velocities. In these areas of active upwelling and downwelling, vertical velocities {{at the top of the}} bottom boundary layer are due to either the jet crossing isobaths or bottom Ekman pumpin...|$|R
40|$|This study investigates wind-driven {{circulation}} {{in the vicinity}} of the Heceta Bank complex along the Oregon shelf. Numerical experiments forced with steady winds (0. 1 Pa) are conducted; upwelling and downwelling cases are compared. The asymmetric bank bathymetry is the only configurational difference from the symmetric bank runs analyzed in Part I (Whitney and Allen). Upwelling-favorable winds generate an upwelling front and southward baroclinic jet. Model results indicate the upwelling jet is centered on the 100 -m isobath along the straight shelf. The jet follows this isobath offshore around the northern part of the bank but separates from sharply turning isobaths in the southern half and flows over deeper waters. The jet turns back toward the coast farther downstream. Inshore of the main jet, currents reverse and flow back onto the bank. These reversed currents turn southward again (at the bank center) and join a secondary southward coastal upwelling jet. This secondary coastal jet converges with the stronger main jet farther downstream. Upwelling is intense at the northern bank edge near the coast, where a dense water tongue is advected over the bank. Upwelling also is strong on the southern bank half where the flow turns and reverses. Other areas of the bank have reduced upwelling or even downwelling during upwelling-favorable winds. Downwelling-favorable winds drive a near-bottom density front and a northward jet. The slower downwelling jet flows along the 130 -m isobath over the straight shelf. The jet departs from isobaths over the southern bank half and follows a straighter path over shallower waters. There are no reversed currents over the bank. The bank is an area of reduced downwelling. Some of the differences in the evolution of the current and density fields are linked to fundamental differences between the upwelling and downwelling regimes; these are anticipated by the symmetric bank results of Part I. Other differences arise because of the bank asymmetry and opposite flow directions over the bank. The lowest-order depth-averaged across-stream momentum balance remains geostrophic over the bank. <b>Advection,</b> <b>ageostrophic</b> pressure gradients, wind stress, and bottom stress all are important in the depth-averaged alongstream momentum balance over the Heceta Bank complex. Both across-shelf and alongshelf density advection are important. Barotropic potential vorticity is not conserved over the bank, but the tendency for relative vorticity changes and depth changes to partially counter each other influences the different paths of the upwelling and downwelling jets. There are several regions of active upwelling and downwelling over the bank. In these areas, vertical velocities at the top of the bottom boundary layer are linked to topographic upwelling and downwelling and Ekman pumping. There is considerable spatial variability in the currents, densities, and dynamics over the Heceta Bank complex...|$|R
40|$|There {{exists a}} {{well-developed}} body of theory based on quasi-geostrophic (QG) dynamics that {{is central to}} our present understanding of large-scale atmospheric and oceanic dynamics. An important question {{is the extent to}} which this body of theory may generalize to more accurate dynamical models. As a first step in this process, we here generalize a set of theoretical results, concerning the evolution of disturbances to prescribed basic states, to semi-geostrophic (SG) dynamics. SG dynamics, like QG dynamics, is a Hamiltonian balanced model whose evolution is described by the material conservation of potential vorticity, together with an invertibility principle relating the potential vorticity to the advecting fields. SG dynamics has features that make it a good prototype for balanced models that are more accurate than QG dynamics. In the first part of this two-part study, we derive a pseudomomentum invariant for the SG equations, and use it to obtain: (i) linear and nonlinear generalized Charney–Stern theorems for disturbances to parallel flows; (ii) a finite-amplitude local conservation law for the invariant, obeying the group-velocity property in the WKB limit; and (iii) a wave-mean-flow interaction theorem consisting of generalized Eliassen–Palm flux diagnostics, an elliptic equation for the stream-function tendency, and a non-acceleration theorem. All these results are analogous to their QG forms. The pseudomomentum invariant – a conserved second-order disturbance quantity that is associated with zonal symmetry – is constructed using a variational principle in a similar manner to the QG calculations. Such an approach is possible when the equations of motion under the geostrophic momentum approximation are transformed to isentropic and geostrophic coordinates, in which the <b>ageostrophic</b> <b>advection</b> terms are no longer explicit. Symmetry-related wave-activity invariants such as the pseudomomentum then arise naturally from the Hamiltonian structure of the SG equations. We avoid use of the so-called ‘massless layer’ approach to the modelling of isentropic gradients at the lower boundary, preferring instead to incorporate explicitly those boundary contributions into the wave-activity and stability results. This makes the analogy with QG dynamics most transparent. This paper treats the f-plane Boussinesq form of SG dynamics, and its recent extension to β-plane, compressible flow by Magnusdottir & Schubert. In the limit of small Rossby number, the results reduce to their respective QG forms. Novel features particular to SG dynamics include apparently unnoticed lateral boundary stability criteria in (i), and the necessity of including additional zonal-mean eddy correlation terms besides the zonal-mean potential vorticity fluxes in the wave-mean-flow balance in (iii). In the companion paper, wave-activity conservation laws and stability theorems based on the SG form of the pseudoenergy are presented...|$|E
