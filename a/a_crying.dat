25|$|Several Hindu stories present {{alternate}} {{aspects of}} Parvati, {{such as the}} ferocious, violent aspect as Shakti and related forms. Shakti is pure energy, untamed, unchecked and chaotic. Her wrath crystallizes into a dark, blood-thirsty, tangled-hair Goddess with an open mouth and a drooping tongue. This goddess is usually identified as the terrible Mahakali or Kali (time). In Linga Purana, Parvati metamorphoses into Kali, on the request of Shiva, to destroy a female asura (demoness) Daruka. Even after destroying the demoness, Kali's wrath could not be controlled. To lower Kali's rage, Shiva appeared as <b>a</b> <b>crying</b> baby. The cries of the baby raised the maternal instinct of Kali who resorts back to her benign form as Parvati.|$|E

25|$|Tove Jansson {{worked as}} an {{illustrator}} and cartoonist for the Swedish-language satirical magazine Garm from the 1930s to 1953. One of her political cartoons achieved a brief international fame: she drew Adolf Hitler as <b>a</b> <b>crying</b> baby in diapers, surrounded by Neville Chamberlain and other great European leaders, who tried to calm the baby down by giving it slices of cake â€“ Austria, Poland, Czechoslovakia, etc. Jansson also produced illustrations during this period for the Christmas magazines Julen and Lucifer (just as her mother had earlier) {{as well as several}} smaller productions. Her earliest comic strips were produced for productions including Lunkentus (Prickinas och Fabians Ã¤ventyr, 1929), VÃ¥rbrodd (Fotbollen som FlÃ¶g till Himlen, 1930), and Allas KrÃ¶nika (Palle och GÃ¶ran gÃ¥ till sjÃ¶ss, 1933).|$|E
25|$|A {{series of}} five monologues collectively titled Tutta casa, letto e chiesa (All House, Bed and Church) also first {{appeared}} in 1977, and were performed by Rame. The first, Il risveglio (Waking Up), featured a working-class mother talking to her baby (a doll).

La mamma fricchettona (Freak Mother) featured a mother taking shelter in a church confessional after leaving her family to pursue drugs and free love. The Same Old Story features a little girl with a doll who swears. The final monologue, Medea, based on an Italian version rather than the more famous Euripides version, had been performed in 35 countries by 1990.|$|E

25|$|Similarly to the {{previous}} Souls games, slaying enemies grants the player Blood Echoes, which doubles as the player's experience points and the game's currency. Should the player die, their Blood Echoes will be lost {{at the location of}} their death. If they are able to reach that point again, they can regain them. However, should the player die before they can retrieve their lost Blood Echoes, they will be lost forever. Sometimes, the player's Blood Echoes may be captured by an enemy, typically identified by glowing blue eyes; defeating this enemy will return the lost Blood Echoes. If an enemy does not hold the Blood Echoes, they will be on the ground near the location of the player's death. Insight is a secondary form of currency; they can be spent to purchase items and depending on the players Insight level, the world will change in many different ways. When the player reaches a specific Insight level, some NPCs or enemies might no longer be present, the sky and moon may change colour, the player may start hearing different sounds (such as <b>a</b> <b>crying</b> baby and mysterious whispering), or enemies' attack patterns may change. The world also changes as the player progresses through the main story. Insight can be gained by finding and defeating bosses or using items that grant Insight.|$|E

Finishing moves cannot be performed neither by nor against the boss or secret characters.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers have {{identified}} several themes in P.T. According to Eurogamers Jeffrey Matulef, the game's main theme is [...] "cyclical mental anguish", {{supported by the}} obscure and confusing nature of the puzzles. Danielle Riendeau of Polygon wrote that P.T. uses two primary themes from the Silent Hill series, [...] "a sense of family trauma and domestic violence and the duality of the 'real world' and the nightmare world." [...] She suggested that P.T. and Eraserhead shared thematic content, writing that both included <b>a</b> <b>crying,</b> deformed infant and that the film's protagonist journeyed from reality into a terrifying world.|$|E
