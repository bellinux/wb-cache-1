From the earliest days of playing open mic nights at coffee houses, it was apparent to me that this music was as important to me as any music I've ever been involved in. It really encapsulates everything I want to do as an artist." [...] He repeated this point {{in an interview with the}} Los Angeles Times.|$|E
500|$|Lie {{is widely}} {{considered}} – along with Einar Gerhardsen – to be {{the architect of the}} post-war success of the Labour Party, and of the Norwegian welfare state. At the same time, he has also been the subject of criticism for organising surveillance of Norwegian opposition figures, in particular communists. Lie remained active in Norwegian public life, even after his 100th birthday, and in 2008 he celebrated his 103rd birthday with the release of a new biography, [...] "Slik jeg ser det nå" [...] (<b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> now).|$|E
500|$|Nielsen studied Renaissance {{polyphony}} closely, {{which accounts}} {{for some of the}} melodic and harmonic content of his music. This interest is exemplified in his Tre Motetter (Three Motets, Op. 55). To non-Danish critics, Nielsen's music initially had a neo-classical sound but became increasingly modern as he developed his own approach to what the writer and composer Robert Simpson called progressive tonality, moving from one key to another. Typically, Nielsen's music might end in a different key from that of its commencement, sometimes as the outcome of a struggle as in his symphonies. There is debate as to how much such elements owe to his folk music activities. Some critics have referred to his rhythms, his use of acciacaturas or appoggiaturas, or his frequent use of a flattened seventh and minor third in his works, as being typically Danish. The composer himself wrote [...] "The intervals, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>it,</b> are the elements which first arouse a deeper interest in music... t is intervals which surprise and delight us anew every time we hear the cuckoo in spring. Its appeal would be less if its call were all on one note." ...|$|E

500|$|Malone {{stated that}} Todd {{believes}} {{that he does not}} deserve forgiveness, which contributes to him embracing his worst qualities, something Malone felt worked better due to Howarth's acting choices, which prevented Todd from acquiring redemption easily. Malone felt {{the most important part of}} Todd's redemption was to have him re-confront Marty in order to better deal with the fact he initiated her rape. As well as having Todd risk his freedom from prison and save Marty from a car crash, Todd donates his own blood to Marty to ensure she survives. A year later, he risks his life to save Patrick, Marty's lover, from death; this act leads to Todd's presumed death. Despite having the character yearn to be thought of as a decent human being, the writers felt his good deeds should never make him feel any less horrible for having raped Marty. [...] Initially, Howarth disagreed, and did not consider the storylines to be redemptive. [...] " [...] not being redeemed at all," [...] he said. [...] "Todd, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>it,</b> is looking for a way to overcome this rage so he can live in society again. From now on, his menace will be on the surface, not exploding. It's more interesting if his violence is on the surface and that he play against it. That's where the subtlety is." ...|$|E

2500|$|Fyodor Dostoyevsky (in a May 30, 1871 {{letter to}} Strakhov) {{described}} War and Peace as [...] "the last {{word of the}} landlord's literature and the brilliant one at that". In a draft version of The Raw Youth he described Tolstoy as [...] "a historiograph of the , or rather, its cultural elite". [...] "The objectivity and realism impart wonderful charm to all scenes, and alongside people of talent, honour and duty he exposes numerous scoundrels, worthless goons and fools", he added. In 1876 Dostoyevsky wrote: [...] "My strong conviction is that a writer of fiction has to have most profound knowledge—not only of the poetic side of his art, but also the reality he deals with, in its historical as well as contemporary context. Here , as far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>it,</b> only one writer excels in this, Count Lev Tolstoy." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Segerdal {{ruling was}} heavily relied upon in 1980 {{to put forward}} a {{definition}} {{of religion in the}} case Re South Place Ethical Society. The Society, which proclaimed itself to be concerned with [...] "the study and dissemination of ethical principles and the cultivation of a rational religious sentiment", had applied for charitable status for the purpose of advancement of religion. Justice Dillon drew on the Segerdal case's comments on what constituted a religion and observed: [...] "Religion, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>it,</b> is concerned with man's relations with God, and ethics are concerned with man's relations with man. The two are not the same, and are not made the same by sincere inquiry into the question: what is God?" [...] Dillon defined religion as requiring [...] "faith in a god and worship of that god", which remains the practical definition in English common law.|$|E

2500|$|R. G. Frey, {{professor}} of philosophy at Bowling Green State University, is a preference utilitarian, as is Singer, but reaches a very different conclusion, arguing in Interests and Rights (1980) that animals have no interests for the utilitarian to take into account. Frey argues that interests are dependent on desire, and that no desire can exist without a corresponding belief. Animals have no beliefs, because a belief state requires the ability to hold a second-order belief—a belief about the belief—which he argues requires language: [...] "If someone were to say, e.g. 'The cat believes that the door is locked,' then that person is holding, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>it,</b> that the cat holds the declarative sentence 'The door is locked' to be true; and I can see no reason whatever for crediting the cat or any other creature which lacks language, including human infants, with entertaining declarative sentences." ...|$|E
