5|$|Cabbages are {{prepared}} {{in many different}} ways for eating. They can be pickled, fermented for dishes such as sauerkraut, steamed, stewed, sautéed, braised, or eaten raw. Cabbage is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>source</b> of vitamin K, vitamin C and dietary fiber.|$|E
5|$|Depending on the variety, lettuce is an {{excellent}} source (20% of the Daily Value, DV, or higher) of vitamin K (97% DV) and vitamin A (21% DV) (table), with higher concentrations of the provitamin A compound, beta-carotene, found in darker green lettuces, such as Romaine. With {{the exception of the}} iceberg variety, lettuce is also <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>source</b> (10-19% DV) of folate and iron (table).|$|E
40|$|Confectionery {{products}} (biscuit) (B) represent <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>sources</b> {{of carbohydrates}} (sugars and starch) and fat for breeding animals.

5|$|The {{assemblage}} {{is easily}} dated {{because it contains}} many fine ash-beds, which are <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>source</b> of zircons used in the uranium-lead method of radiometric dating. These fine-grained ash beds also preserve exquisite detail. Constituents of this biota appear to survive through until the extinction of all Ediacarans {{at the base of}} the Cambrian.|$|E
5|$|The carrot {{gets its}} characteristic, bright orange colour from β-carotene, and lesser amounts of α-carotene, γ-carotene, lutein and zeaxanthin. α- and β-carotenes are partly metabolized into vitamin A, {{providing}} more than 100% of the Daily Value (DV) per 100 g serving of carrots (right table). Carrots are also <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>source</b> of vitamin K (13% DV) and vitamin B6 (11% DV), but otherwise have modest content of other essential nutrients (right table).|$|E
5|$|The {{chemical}} composition of fruit bodies collected from Turkey has been analyzed, and the dried fruit bodies determined {{to contain the}} following nutritional components: protein, 19.46%; fat, 3.65%; ash, 32.51%; carbohydrates, 44.38% (including 6.71% as non-digestible cellulose). Fresh fruit bodies have a moisture content of 84.4%. The mushrooms are <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>source</b> of the element vanadium, shown in a 2007 study to be present at a concentration of 0.142mg/kg (dry weight).|$|E
25|$|It is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> pollen <b>source</b> for {{honey bees}} and a {{honeydew}} source for aphids.|$|R
5000|$|Songbirds eat the fruits, and quail {{and small}} mammals use the plant for cover. It is {{considered}} <b>a</b> <b>good</b> honey <b>source.</b>|$|R
25|$|This {{sediment}} then {{enters the}} coastal system and is transported by longshore drift. <b>A</b> <b>good</b> {{example of the}} sediment budget and longshore drift working together in the coastal system is inlet ebb-tidal shoals, which store sand that has been transported by long shore transport. As well as storing sand these systems may also transfer or by pass sand into other beach systems, therefore inlet ebb-tidal shoal systems provide <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>sources</b> and sinks for the sediment budget.|$|R
5|$|The {{content of}} MFGM in dairy {{products}} {{varies depending on}} the processing involved. During dairy processing such as churning or decreaming, the MFGM is disrupted and preferentially distributed into aqueous phases such as buttermilk, butter serum, or certain type of whey. Thus they can be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>source</b> of MFGM for addition into food products.|$|E
5|$|Reviews {{of fiction}} and popular science books were published, {{and there was}} a science column which {{endeavored}} to answer readers' questions. These features were at first of good quality, but deteriorated after Lasser's departure, although it is not certain that Lasser wrote the content of either one. An influential non-fiction initiative was the creation of the Science Fiction League, an organization that brought together local science fiction fan clubs across the country. Gernsback took the opportunity to sell items such as buttons and insignia, and it was undoubtedly a profitable enterprise for him as well as <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>source</b> of publicity. It was ultimately more important in becoming one of the foundations of science fiction fandom.|$|E
5|$|Roberto Guerro is {{the main}} {{antagonist}} of Uncharted: Golden Abyss voiced and motion-captured by actor JB Blanc. A decade before Golden Abyss, Roberto Guerro was the military dictator of Panama before being overthrown by a coup d'état. He escaped execution by the new regime and, accompanied by loyalists, formed a revolutionary army to hound government forces and eventually regain power. However, Guerro quickly realised that without <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>source</b> of funds he {{would be unable to}} compete with the military strength of a new government, so he indulged in abductions and drug running to build up the cash.|$|E

5000|$|CGM {{is used as}} an {{inexpensive}} protein source for pet foods. CGM is <b>an</b> especially <b>good</b> <b>source</b> of the amino acid cysteine, but must be balanced with other proteins for lysine.|$|R
5|$|The carrot is a {{biennial}} {{plant in}} the umbellifer family Apiaceae. At first, it grows a rosette of leaves while building up the enlarged taproot. Fast-growing cultivars mature within three months (90 days) of sowing the seed, while slower-maturing cultivars are harvested four months later (120 days). The roots contain high quantities of alpha- and beta-carotene, and are <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>source</b> of vitamin K and vitamin B6, but the belief that eating carrots improves night vision is a myth put forward by the British in World War II to mislead the enemy about their military capabilities.|$|E
5|$|Seaborg's {{theoretical}} {{development of}} the actinide concept resulted in a redrawing of the Periodic Table of the Elements into its current configuration with the actinide series appearing below the lanthanide series. Seaborg developed the chemical elements americium and curium while in Chicago. He managed to secure patents for both elements. His patent on curium never proved commercially viable because of the element's short half-life, but americium is commonly used in household smoke detectors and thus provided <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>source</b> of royalty income to Seaborg in later years. Prior to the test of the first nuclear weapon, Seaborg joined with several other leading scientists {{in a written statement}} known as the Franck Report (secret at the time but since published) unsuccessfully calling on President Truman to conduct a public demonstration of the atomic bomb witnessed by the Japanese.|$|E

30|$|The {{results of}} TOC {{analysis}} of the outcrop samples (Table  1) and subsurface samples from the Sann # 1 well (Table  2) are presented. Based on the highest value of 2.08 TOC (%) from the outcrop samples and 5.43 TOC (%) at depth of 3680  m the Chiltan Formation is considered as <b>a</b> very <b>good</b> <b>source</b> rock. Similarly the outcrop samples of the Sembar Formation having the highest value of 1.54 TOC (%) and 9.48 TOC (%) {{at a depth of}} 3520  m suggest it to be <b>a</b> very <b>good</b> <b>source</b> rock (Bacon et al. 2000). The variations in TOC content in the samples from the Chiltan and Sembar Formation with the depths in the Sann # 1 well also confirms <b>an</b> overall good–very <b>good</b> <b>source</b> rock potential for both formations as shown in the TOC vs Depth cross plot (Fig.  2) (Maky and Ramadan 2008).|$|R

50|$|Sorghum {{is about}} 70% starch, so is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> energy <b>source.</b> Its starch {{consists}} of 70 to 80% amylopectin, a branched-chain polymer of glucose, and 20 to 30% amylose, a straight-chain polymer.|$|R

25|$|While {{plants are}} {{generally}} <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>source</b> of vitamin C, {{the amount in}} foods of plant origin depends on the precise variety of the plant, soil condition, climate where it grew, length of time since it was picked, storage conditions, and method of preparation.|$|E
50|$|This tree {{helps to}} control erosion and is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> natural <b>source</b> of mulch. However, deforestation, higher demand for {{cultivated}} agricultural {{areas and the}} increasing population reduce numbers of this important forest tree in the African tropics.|$|R
