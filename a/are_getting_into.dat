5|$|Doctor Leonard McCoy (DeForest Kelley) is {{concerned}} that the increasing numbers of tribbles threaten to consume all the food aboard the Enterprise. It is discovered that they are entering ship systems, interfering with their functions, and consuming any edible contents present. Kirk realizes that if the tribbles <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> <b>into</b> the ship's stores, they are {{a threat to the}} grain aboard the station. He examines the holds but learns that it is already too late: The tribbles have indeed eaten the quadrotriticale, and Kirk is literally buried in grain-gorged tribbles when he opens a grain hold with an overhead hatch. Spock (Leonard Nimoy) and McCoy discover that about half the tribbles in the hold are dead and many of the rest are dying, alerting them that the grain has been poisoned.|$|E
500|$|In Florida, peak gusts were {{recorded}} at [...] near Pensacola Beach. The winds, combined with associated thunderstorms, caused minor damage, and brought down small trees and power lines. Throughout Walton County, Hanna left approximately 15,000 customers without power, forming a statewide total of 20,000 power outages. Due to high winds, bridges to offshore islands were closed. Minor beach erosion was reported {{along the coast}} of Walton, Bay and Gulf counties. Three people drowned in high surf; one near Pensacola Beach, one at Seagrove Beach and another at Panama City Beach. The fatalities prompted a local Police Major to comment, [...] "People <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> <b>into</b> the water and not paying attention to the warning flags." [...] Heavy rain fell throughout the central and western Panhandle; the highest reported total was , at Chipley. As a result, rivers topped their banks, while county roads and homes in Perry, as well as streets in the Tallahassee region, were flooded. The total damage in Florida is estimated at $400,000 (2002USD).|$|E
2500|$|In September 2012 the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) accused Walgreens of {{endangering}} {{public safety}} and barred the company from shipping oxycodone and other controlled drugs from its Jupiter, Florida, distribution center. The DEA said that Walgreens failed to maintain proper controls to ensure it didn't dispense drugs to addicts and drug dealers. [...] The DEA also said that six of Walgreens' Florida pharmacies ordered in excess of a million oxycodone pills a year. [...] In contrast, in 2011, the average pharmacy in the U.S. ordered 73,000 oxycodone tablets a year according to the DEA. [...] One Walgreens pharmacy located in Fort Myers, Florida, ordered 95,800 pills in 2009, but by 2011 this number had jumped to 2.2 million pills in one year. [...] Another example was a Walgreens pharmacy located in Hudson, Fla., a town of 34,000 people near Clearwater, that purchased 2.2 million pills in 2011, the DEA said. [...] Immediate suspension orders are an action taken when the DEA believes a registrant, such as a pharmacy or a doctor, is [...] "an imminent danger to the public safety." [...] All DEA licensees [...] "have an obligation to ensure that medications <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> <b>into</b> the hands of legitimate patients," [...] said Mark Trouville, former DEA {{special agent in charge}} of the Miami Field Division. [...] "When they choose to look the other way, patients suffer and drug dealers prosper." ...|$|E

60|$|March 20.--Thomson breakfasted. I {{left him}} soon, being desirous {{to finish my}} labours.

This evening went on with work as usual; there was not above four pages finished, but my conscience is quiet on my exertions.|$|E

"They complain, your Excellency," [...] {{continued}} Sancho, [...] "of the smoothness of the water; {{and they}} say that when the winds blow at all, in these seas, they come only from the eastward, having no power to blow from any other quarter.
