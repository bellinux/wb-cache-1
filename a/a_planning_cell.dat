In addition, this process makes use of powerful EA(evolutionary algorithms) algorithms, which can provide a near optimum solution...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The phylum Verrucomicrobia is a {{divergent}} phylum within domain Bacteria including {{members of}} the microbial communities of soil and fresh and marine waters; recently extremely acidophilic members from hot springs {{have been found to}} oxidize methane. At least one genus, Prosthecobacter, includes species with genes homologous to those encoding eukaryotic tubulins. A significant superphylum relationship of Verrucomicrobia with members of phylum Planctomycetes possessing <b>a</b> unique compartmentalized <b>cell</b> <b>plan,</b> and members of the phylum Chlamydiae including human pathogens with a complex intracellular life cycle, has been proposed. Based on the postulated superphylum relationship, we hypothesized that members of the two separate phyla Planctomycetes and Verrucomicrobia might share <b>a</b> similar ultrastructure <b>plan</b> differing from classical prokaryote organization. Results The ultrastructure of cells of four members of phylum Verrucomicrobia â€“ Verrucomicrobium spinosum, Prosthecobacter dejongeii, Chthoniobacter flavus, and strain Ellin 514 â€“ was examined using electron microscopy incorporating high-pressure freezing and cryosubstitution. These four members of phylum Verrucomicrobia, representing 3 class-level subdivisions within the phylum, were found to possess <b>a</b> compartmentalized <b>cell</b> <b>plan</b> analogous to that found in phylum Planctomycetes. Like all planctomycetes investigated, they possess a major pirellulosome compartment containing a condensed nucleoid and ribosomes surrounded by an intracytoplasmic membrane (ICM), as well as a ribosome-free paryphoplasm compartment between the ICM and cytoplasmic membrane. Conclusion <b>A</b> unique compartmentalized <b>cell</b> <b>plan</b> so far found among Domain Bacteria only within phylum Planctomycetes, and challenging our concept of prokaryote <b>cell</b> <b>plans,</b> has now been found in a second phylum of the Domain Bacteria, in members of phylum Verrucomicrobia. The planctomycete <b>cell</b> <b>plan</b> thus occurs in at least two distinct phyla of the Bacteria, phyla which have been suggested from other evidence to be related phylogenetically in the proposed PVC (Planctomycetes-Verrucomicrobia-Chlamydiae) superphylum. This planctomycete <b>cell</b> <b>plan</b> is present in at least 3 of 6 subdivisions of Verrucomicrobia, suggesting that the common ancestor of the verrucomicrobial phylum was also compartmentalized and possessed such <b>a</b> <b>plan.</b> The presence of this compartmentalized <b>cell</b> <b>plan</b> in both phylum Planctomycetes and phylum Verrucomicrobia suggest that the last common ancestor of these phyla was also compartmentalized. </p...|$|R
40|$|High-dose {{cytarabine}} {{is currently}} used {{in combination with}} anthracycline {{in the treatment of}} acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML). Moreover, high-dose cytarabine has been reported to produce long-term disease-free survival in a proportion of patients, especially in certain subtypes of AML. However, it remains unknown whether the outcome of patients undergoing allogeneic or autologous stern cell transplantation is influenced by previous treatment with high-dose cytarabine. To this end, 1672 patients with AML in first remission who were reported to the Acute Leukaemia Working Party registry of the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) and who were transplanted between 1980 and 1995 were analysed according to the dose intensity of cytarabine given at induction and/or consolidation. Autologous stem cell transplantation (ABMT) was performed in 846 patients and allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in 826 patients. This study shows that the dose of cytarabine (Ara-C) given at induction and/or consolidation did not influence the relapse incidence in patients subsequently allografted or autografted. Tn addition, it did not give any advantage in terms of overall outcome. Therefore, high-dose (HD) Ara-C may not be needed for patients who have <b>a</b> <b>planned</b> stem <b>cell</b> transplantation (SCT) as post-remission therapy. Nevertheless, HD Ara-C may be utilized in certain subtypes of AML that are believed to be curable by chemotherapy alone...|$|R

Planctomyces and several Verrucomicrobiae exhibit <b>a</b> complex <b>cell</b> <b>plan,</b> with <b>an</b> intracytoplasmic membrane inducing the compartmentalization of the cytoplasm into two regions (pirellulosome and paryphoplasm). The evolution {{and function of}} this <b>cell</b> <b>plan</b> is still subject to debate. In this work, we hypothesized that it could {{play a role in}} protection of the bacterial DNA, especially against Horizontal Genes Transfers (HGT). Therefore, 64 bacterial genomes belonging to seven different phyla (whose four PVC phyla) were studied. We reconstructed the evolution of the <b>cell</b> <b>plan</b> as precisely as possible, thanks to information obtained by bibliographic study and electronic microscopy. We used a strategy based on comparative phylogenomic {{in order to determine the}} part occupied by the horizontal transfers for each studied genomes. Results: Our results show that the bacteria Simkania negevensis (Chlamydiae) and Coraliomargarita akajimensis (Verrucomicrobiae), whose <b>cell</b> <b>plan</b> were unknown before, are compartmentalized, as we can see on the micrographies. This is one of the first indication of the presence of an intracytoplasmic membrane in a Chlamydiae. The proportion of HGT does not seems to be related to the <b>cell</b> <b>plan</b> of bacteria, suggesting that compartmentalization does not induce a protection of bacterial DNA against HGT. Conversely, lifestyle of bacteria seems to impact the ability of bacteria to exchange genes. Conclusions: Our study allows a best reconstruction of the evolution of intracytoplasmic membrane, but this structure seems to have no impact on HGT occurrences...|$|R

Inclusion of soft handover in optimization models for UMTS and CDMA cell site selection and configuration has previously been very limited but it is important for coverage because it can provide gain to the user.

Introduction: The parts {{of the human body}} that chiefly {{interests}} the student of mental science are the nerves and nerve centers, principally collected in the brain, the organs of sense, and the muscular system. The brain is the principal organ of the mind. We know that the brain is the principal organ of the mind from the local feelings that we experience during mental excitement. In most cases of bodily irritation, we can assign the place or seat of the disturbance. In ordinary circumstances we have no local consciousness of mental action, but in time of great mental agitation, or after some usual exertion of thought, the aching or oppression in the head tells where the seat of action is, precisely as aching limbs prove what muscles have been exercised during a long day's march. If the brain is diseased or injured it impairs in some way or another the power of the mind. For example, if a person receives a blow on the head it will destroy consciousness for a time. The nervous system may be divided into two parts. First, the central nervous system, consisting of the brain and the spinal cord. Second, the peripheral nervous system. We may include under the peripheral nervous system the nerve fibers running from the central system to the various parts of the body, and all collections of nerve cells outside of the great central nervous organs. In the part last mentioned are included the nervous mechanisms of the ear, eye, tongue, nose, skin, viscera and the nerves connecting them with the brain or spinal cord. The units of the nervous system are the nerve fibers, and nerve cells. We find that the entire nervous system is formed on <b>a</b> uniform <b>plan.</b> <b>Cells</b> or aggregations of cells, are joined to each other by nerve fibers; and all are connected directly with the brain...|$|R
