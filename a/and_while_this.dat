5|$|Four {{different}} long-term expansion {{proposals were}} put forward between 1964 and 1991 which all proposed adding numerous {{lines to the}} network as well as extending the existing ones. Given the political instability characteristic of Argentina during this time, none of these proposals came to fruition, though aspects {{of them have been}} incorporated into contemporary expansion plans. One additional proposal put forward in 1973 saw the unification of the city's commuter rail lines through underground tunnels and incorporated into the Buenos Aires Underground, <b>and</b> <b>while</b> <b>this</b> was also shelved, it has been adapted into the current Red de Expresos Regionales proposal.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, Berkeley {{scientists}} {{claimed the}} discovery of element 103 in the reaction of californium with boron and carbon ions. They claimed {{the production of the}} isotope 257103, and also claimed to have synthesized an alpha decaying isotope of element 102 that had a half-life of 15s and alpha decay energy 8.2MeV. They assigned this to 255102 without giving a reason for the assignment. The values do not agree with those now known for 255No, although they do agree with those now known for 257No, <b>and</b> <b>while</b> <b>this</b> isotope probably played a part in this experiment its discovery was inconclusive.|$|E

5|$|The naturalism {{of natural}} {{selection}} conflicted with presumptions of purpose in nature <b>and</b> <b>while</b> <b>this</b> could be reconciled by theistic evolution, other mechanisms implying more progress or purpose were more acceptable. Herbert Spencer had already incorporated Lamarckism into his popular philosophy of progressive free market human society. He popularised the terms evolution and survival of the fittest, and many thought Spencer was central to evolutionary thinking.|$|E
5|$|The sheriff {{finds the}} wolf in the woods, {{and when he}} whistles, the wolf goes to him. As he pets the wolf's head, he sees himself holding a knife, about to hurt the woman he only knows as Mary Margaret. Graham pays a visit to her classroom, telling her that he {{believes}} they know each other from another life, before Storybrooke. Mary Margaret assumes that the sheriff has been talking to Henry, <b>and</b> <b>while</b> <b>this</b> is not the case, this gives Graham the idea to consult Henry about his book.

5|$|Prior to Confederation in 1867, the Royal Arms of the United Kingdom {{served in}} Canada as {{the symbol of}} royal authority. Arms had not been granted {{to any of the}} colonies in British North America, apart from 17th-century grants to Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. The year after Confederation, arms were granted by Royal Warrant on May 26, 1868 to Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia (that Nova Scotia had been granted arms was forgotten, and it took until 1929 for the {{historic}} arms granted in the 17th century to be reinstated) and New Brunswick. In the Royal Warrant of 1868, Queen Victoria authorized the four arms of the first provinces to be quartered for use on the Great Seal of Canada <b>and</b> <b>while</b> <b>this</b> was not done for the first Great Seal, it is through this reference it became the de facto arms for Canada until 1921.

5|$|The planned {{extensions}} and realignment of the Canarsie Line were cancelled in 1973, due {{to community}} opposition against the proposed expressways {{that the line}} would have been built along with. Later that year, the LIE line was canceled because New York state voters had declined a $3.5 billion bond measure that would have paid for five subway extensions, including the LIE line. This {{was the second time}} that voters declined a bond issue to finance this extension, with the first being on November 2, 1971 for $2.5 billion. The defeat set back the construction of subway construction projects, including the Lower East Side Loop, the Utica Avenue Line, the Nostrand Avenue extension, the Jamaica Avenue Line, and the Northeast Queens Line. The 1973 bond issue, in addition to financing the LIE line would have also paid for an extension of the IRT Dyre Avenue Line to Co-op City, an extension of the IND Queens Boulevard Line to Hillside Avenue and Springfield Boulevard, a joint LIRR/subway extension from the Atlantic Avenue LIRR terminal to Lower Manhattan, and a branch of the Queens Boulevard Line at 63rd Drive to the Rockaways via the abandoned Rockaway Beach Branch. The double fare to the Rockaways would have been removed, <b>and</b> <b>while</b> <b>this</b> was not done as part of the bond issue, it was removed on September 1, 1975. However, the MTA believed that many other projects would still be built. By November 1974, the MTA projected a 1981 opening date for the Archer Avenue Line to Springfield Boulevard, as well as a 1982 opening date for the 63rd Street Line and for the SAS from 34th Street to 125th Street. In 1983, the Queens Super Express Bypass was to open, and in the same year, the Bronx extension of the SAS and the BMT Jamaica Line reroute to Archer Avenue would open. The MTA thought that the SAS's southern extension to Whitehall Street would open by 1988, and that by 1993, the Utica Avenue, Nostrand Avenue, and LIE subway lines and the LIRR East Side Access would all open.|$|E
25|$|The Hindu scriptures {{acknowledge}} {{numerous occasions}} of polygyny; {{it was the}} norm among kings, the nobility and the extremely wealthy. Pandu, {{the father of the}} Pandavas in Mahabharata, had two wives Kunti and Madri. Krishna, considered one of the incarnations of Vishnu, had eight chief wives and sixteen thousand junior wives. Many other personalities including Rama had only one wife, <b>and</b> <b>while</b> <b>this</b> was regarded as morally exemplary, polygyny remained customary and acceptable among Hindus. It was legally abolished for Hindus in India by the Hindu Marriage Act of 1956.|$|E
25|$|While the {{conservative}} {{wing of the}} German political spectrum, primarily formed of the CDU and CSU, enjoys considerable support, this support tends to be less extended to Stoiber. He enjoys considerably more support {{in his home state}} of Bavaria than in the rest of Germany, where CDU chairwoman Angela Merkel is more popular. This has its reasons: Merkel supports a kind of fiscal conservatism, but a more liberal social policy. Stoiber, on the other hand, favors a more conservative approach to both fiscal and social matters, <b>and</b> <b>while</b> <b>this</b> ensures him the religious vote, strongest in Bavaria, it has weakened his support at the national level.|$|E

25|$|The monuments {{themselves}} were listed and {{purchased by the}} State {{at the start of}} the 20th century to protect them against quarrymen, <b>and</b> <b>while</b> <b>this</b> was successful at the time, in the mid century redevelopment, changes to agricultural practices and increasing tourism bringing visitors to the stones led to rapid deterioration. The Ministère de la Culture et de la Communication (Heritage Ministry) re-examined the issue from 1984, and subsequently set up the ‘Mission Carnac’ 1991 with the aim of rehabilitating and developing the alignments. This involved restricting public access, launching a series of scientific and technical studies, and producing a plan for conservation and development in the area.|$|E
25|$|Stereoscopic {{displays}} {{were developed}} based on liquid crystal polarized spectacles, <b>and</b> <b>while</b> <b>this</b> {{had been very}} expensive on the PS2, it now became a commodity item. A common alternative was to add a polarizable screen {{to the front of}} the display and to provide viewers with extremely cheap spectacles with orthogonal polarization for separate eyes. With projectors such as Barco, it was possible to project stereoscopic display onto special silvered screens and supply an audience of hundreds with spectacles. In this way molecular graphics became universally known within large sectors of chemical and biochemical science, especially in the pharmaceutical industry. Because the backgrounds of many displays were black by default, it was common for modelling sessions and lectures to be held with almost all lighting turned off.|$|E
25|$|The {{wealth of}} the monasteries {{and the success of}} Anglo-Saxon society {{attracted}} the attention of people from continental Europe, mostly Danes and Norwegians. Due to the plundering raids that followed, the raiders attracted the name Viking – from the Old Norse víkingr meaning an expedition – which soon became used for the raiding activity or piracy reported in western Europe. In 793, Lindisfarne was raided <b>and</b> <b>while</b> <b>this</b> was not the first raid of its type it was the most prominent. A year later Jarrow, the monastery where Bede wrote, was attacked; in 795 Iona; and in 804 the nunnery at Lyminge Kent was granted refuge inside the walls of Canterbury. Sometime around 800, a Reeve from Portland in Wessex was killed when he mistook some raiders for ordinary traders.|$|E

25|$|In 1934, Millikan {{referred}} I. H. Lyons {{from the}} National Postal Meter Company to Arnold Beckman. Lyons wanted a non-clogging ink so that postage could be printed by machines, {{instead of having}} clerks lick stamps. Beckman's solution was to make ink with butyric acid, a malodorous substance. Because of this ingredient, no manufacturer wanted to manufacture it. Beckman decided to make it himself. He started the National Inking Appliance Company, obtaining space in a garage owned by instrument maker Fred Henson and hiring two Caltech students, Robert Barton and Henry Fracker. Beckman developed {{and took out a}} couple of patents for re-inking typewriter ribbons, but marketing them was not successful. This was Beckman's first experience at running a company and marketing a product, <b>and</b> <b>while</b> <b>this</b> first product failed, Beckman repurposed the company for another product.|$|E
25|$|In {{the time}} of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, the Poles were a force to be {{reckoned}} with, especially their elite, heavy cavalry, most notably the Winged Hussars. While the Russians were fighting among themselves in a civil war, King Sigismund saw an opportunity to invade and take power, as did Sweden though they were never firmly on one side or the other. At one point the boyars invited the son of King Sigismund, Prince Władysław, to become their new Tsar, but Sigismund disallowed it. Initially Sigismund wished to gain the throne for himself and become the master of Russia, <b>and</b> <b>while</b> <b>this</b> did not happen, the Commonwealth army was victorious in many battles and gained more territory. At one point Polish troops, under the command of the famous Hetman Stanisław Żółkiewski, captured Moscow and the Kremlin. On the downside the whole conflict meant that any lasting union between the Commonwealth and Russia was impossible and any plans concerning the final destruction of the Russian state were unsuccessful.|$|E

500|$|Additional {{controversy}} developed {{after the}} battle about Pickett's personal location during the charge.
