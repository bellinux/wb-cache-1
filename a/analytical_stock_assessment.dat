The development of an <b>analytical</b> <b>stock</b> <b>assessment,</b> necessary to give more accurate advice, is hampered by a number of limitations on the input data, among which the most important are the poor quality of catch-at-age data and the absence of a targeted survey for North Sea {{horse mackerel}}.

40|$|The eastern Baltic (EB) cod (Gadus morhua) {{stock was}} {{depleted}} and overexploited for decades until the mid- 2000 s, when fishing mortality rapidly declined and biomass started to increase, {{as shown by}} stock assessments. These positive developments were partly assigned to effective management measures, and the EB cod {{was considered one of}} the most successful stock recoveries in recent times. In contrast to this optimistic view, the <b>analytical</b> <b>stock</b> <b>assessment</b> failed in 2014, leaving the present stock status unclear. Deteriorated quality of some basic input data for stock assessment in combination with changes in environmental and ecological conditions has led to an unusual situation for cod in the Baltic Sea, which poses new challenges for stock assessment and management advice. A number of adverse developments such as low nutritional condition and disappearance of larger individuals indicate that the stock is in distress. In this study, we (i) summarize the knowledge of recent changes in cod biology and ecosystem conditions, (ii) describe the subsequent challenges for stock assessment, and (iii) highlight the key questions where answers are urgently needed to understand the present stock status and provide scientifically solid support for cod management in the Baltic Sea...|$|E
40|$|<b>Analytical</b> <b>stock</b> <b>assessment</b> of sardine (Sardina pilchardus, Walb.) in the Adriatic Sea from 1975 to 1999 was {{performed}} {{taking into account}} the occurrence of discarding at sea of sardine caught by the Italian fleet. We have attempted to model the fishermen’s behaviour using data collected by an observer on board fishing vessels. This enabled us to estimate the amounts of discards, which were added to the catches landed, collected by ISMAR-CNR Ancona. Discards were calculated for the period 1987 - 1999, as their values were negligible before 1987. Stock assessment on the entire data series from 1975 - 1999 was carried out by means of Virtual Population Analysis (VPA). Discarding behaviour differs among ports due to different local customs and market conditions. The quantity added to the annual total catch ranged from 900 tonnes to 4000 tonnes, corresponding to between 2 % and 15 % of the total corrected catch. VPAs indicated that mid-year sardine stock biomass rose steadily from 400, 000 tonnes in 1975 to a peak of 950, 000 tonnes in 1984. Subsequently, biomass declined steadily to the more recent values, around 300, 000 tonnes. Although discarded quantities were relatively high, their influence on stock assessment was not strong because of the high level of both catch and, in particular, estimated biomass at sea...|$|E

40|$|Elements of the precautionary {{approach}} to fishery management are commonly {{implemented in the}} form of harvest control rules, with limit, threshold and target reference points for stock size and fishing mortality. However, a review of two large advisory and management systems indicates that many <b>stock</b> <b>assessments</b> are not sufficiently informative to support such control rules. After a nearly a decade of applying such control rules, a large portion of management units in the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) convention and marine fisheries under United States jurisdiction still have uncertain status, because many management units lack a complete suite of fishing mortality and biomass estimates and associated reference points. For those fishery resources with <b>analytical</b> <b>stock</b> <b>assessments</b> and reference point estimates, fishing mortality has generally been reduced to within prescribed limits. The number of stocks in the ICES area with excessive fishing mortality (i. e., greater than the limit reference point) decreased since 1997, but the number of stocks in need of rebuilding increased as a result of excessive fishing or revised reference points. The number of U. S. stocks with excessive fishing decreased and the number of stocks needing rebuilding decreased as a result of stock recovery, revised reference points, or redefined management units. The number of U. S. stocks with uncertain or undefined status substantially decreased. The large portion of stocks with uncertain status in both systems illustrates that such precautionary control rules are applied only to data-rich <b>stock</b> <b>assessments,</b> and are not being applied to management of fishery resources with the most uncertain <b>stock</b> <b>assessments...</b>|$|R
40|$|The Eastern Baltic cod {{abundance}} started {{rapidly to}} increase in the mid- 2000 s as evidenced by analytical stock assessments, due to increased recruitment and declining fishing mortality. Since 2014, the <b>analytical</b> <b>stock</b> <b>assessment</b> is not available, leaving the present stock status unclear and casting doubts about {{the magnitude of the}} recent increase in recruitment. Earlier studies identified main factors impacting on cod reproductive success {{to be related to the}} loss of two out of three spawning areas in the 1980 s caused by lack of major Baltic inflows with a concurrent reduction in salinity and oxygen. Other important factors include prey availability for first-feeding larvae, egg predation by sprat and herring and cannibalism on juveniles, all in one way or the other related to the prevailing hydrographic conditions. These factors cannot explain increased reproductive success in the last decade, as the period was characterized by an absence of large-scale Baltic inflows since 2003 and persistent anoxic conditions in the bottom water of the deep Baltic basins. This questions the perception of the increased recruitment in later years and challenges our present understanding of cod recruitment dynamics in the Baltic Sea. In this contribution, we review evidence from the recent literature supplemented by information from latest research cruises to elucidate whether cod reproductive success indeed has increased during the last decade, and we suggest the key processes responsible for the recent dynamics in cod recruitment and outline directions for future research...|$|E
40|$|Sustainability {{within the}} {{fisheries}} of the commercially important European whelk Buccinum undatum {{has become a}} major concern because of over-exploitation and increased landings in many European coastal shelf seas due to the expansion of export markets to East Asian countries. Current management of B. undatum populations is difficult to achieve as several life history traits are problematic to accurately monitor. The current method of age determination for <b>stock</b> <b>assessment</b> has a low success rate and focuses on the use of putative annual rings {{on the surface of the}} organic operculum. Here, we validate an annual periodicity of growth ring formation in B. undatum statoliths that provides an alternative, reliable and accurate method for determining a whelk’s age. Laboratory-reared juvenile B. undatum of known provenance and age deposited a hatching ring at the time of emergence from their egg capsule and a clearly defined growth ring during February of their first and second years. Stable oxygen isotope profiles from the shells of 2 adult whelks confirmed annual growth ring deposition by demonstrating seasonal cycles of δ 18 O in the shell that matched the relative position and number of visible growth rings in the statolith. Validation of annually resolved statolith growth rings will, for the first time, provide fisheries scientists with a tool to determine the age structure of B. undatum populations and allow <b>analytical</b> <b>stock</b> <b>assessments</b> that will enable informed decisions for future management practices of whelk fisheries...|$|R

Often though, the quality of the catch data is compromised when dealing with a complex population structure where fish of different population units mix in a fishery.

We show that failure to account for mixing is one of the major drivers of biased estimates of population abundance, affecting biomass reference points and MSY targets. When mixing of population units occurs, the role a survey can play to provide unbiased assessment results is limited. Either different assessment models should be employed or stock status should be considered from the survey data alone. In addition, correctly classifying the origin of fish is especially important for those population units that are markedly smaller in size than other units in the population complex. Without high classification success rates, smaller population units are extremely vulnerable to overexploitation. Peer-reviewed.

40|$|Several commercially {{important}} {{demersal fish}} stocks for the North Sea fisheries {{are classified as}} “category 11 ” {{in the light of}} the EU policy paper on fisheries management (17 May 2010, COM(2010) 241). For stocks in this category, there is no STECF (Scientific, technical and economic committee for fisheries) management advice, due to the unknown status of the stocks. The reason for this is that the data and information available to perform <b>analytical</b> <b>stock</b> <b>assessments</b> are highly uncertain or lacking. This document describes existing data and options for collecting new data for the evaluation of the state of category 11 stocks. We focus on turbot and brill in the North Sea. Existing data from logbooks and the market sampling program can be used to estimate LPUE series used in age-based <b>stock</b> <b>assessment</b> methods, similar to other commercially important flatfish species such as plaice and sole. Landings Per Unit of Effort (LPUE) data of the Dutch beam trawl fleet > 221 kW were standardised for engine power and corrected for targeting behaviour as described below and graphically shown in Figure 3. 2. 1. The methods are similar to those used to analyse commercial LPUE data for North Sea plaice, described in Quirijns and Poos (2010). Landing rates (LPUE) by market category were calculated for the period 2002 - 2010. The corrected LPUE series indicate an increase in commercial LPUE for both species during the period 2002 - 2006. For turbot, the LPUE stays stable in the first five years, increases between 2006 and 2008, and decreases afterwards. The increase in brill LPUE is larger, and occurs throughout the study period. Compared to other commercially important flatfish species relatively few brill and turbot market samples are taken. This reduces the ability to track the cohorts in the LPUE series of the older ages which is a prerequisite for reliable <b>stock</b> <b>assessment</b> estimates. Also, the time series currently spans only 9 years. Collection of additional data may therefore be desirable. Expanding the BTS survey will provide industry independent data and would therefore give easily interpretable results. The option of an industry survey is also a good option if the survey is already being executed for sole and plaice. However, both options are costly. Therefore, the option of increasing the samples of turbot and brill at the auction is relatively easy and relatively inexpensive and therefore at present the most promising. The methods used for this document will not per definition be applicable for all category 11 species. For dab, flounder, lemon sole and tub gurnard, samples at the auctions are taken to collect biological data. For these species it may be possible to raise the data in a similar way as was done in this report to estimate the age composition of the stock. For other species (witch flounder, horse mackerel, silver smelt, red mullet and squid) there is no market sampling. For these species, other methods will have to be developed...|$|R

These data will be used to evaluate the progress of each fishery towards achieving the MMPA’s goal of zero fishery-related mortality and serious injury of marine mammals. The <b>Stock</b> <b>Assessment</b> Reports should be considered working documents, as they are updated as new information becomes available. The <b>Stock</b> <b>Assessment</b> Reports were originally developed in 1995 (Small and DeMaster 1995). Revisions have been published for the following years: 1996 (Hill et al. 1997), 1998 (Hill and DeMaster 1998), 1999 (Hill and DeMaster 1999), 2000 (Ferrero et al. 2000), 2001 (Angliss et al. 2001), 2002 (Angliss and Lodge 2002), 2003 (Angliss and Lodge 2004), 2005 (Angliss and Outlaw 2005), 2006 (Angliss and Outlaw 2006), and 2007 (Angliss and Outlaw 2008). Each <b>stock</b> <b>assessment</b> report is designed to stand alone and is updated as new information becomes available. The MMPA requires <b>stock</b> <b>assessment</b> reports to be reviewed annually for stocks designated as strategic, annually for stocks where there are significant new information available, and at least once every 3 years for all other stocks. New information for all strategic stocks (Steller sea lions, northern fur seals, Cook Inlet beluga whales, AT 1 transient killer whales, harbor porpoises, sperm whales, humpback whales, fin whales, North Pacific right whales, and bowhead whales), were reviewed in 2007 - 2008. This review, and a review of other stocks, led to the revision of the following <b>stock</b> <b>assessments</b> for the 2008 document: Steller sea lion (western and eastern U. S. stocks), northern fur seal, beluga whale (Beaufort Sea, Eastern Chukchi Sea, Eastern Bering Sea, Bristol Bay, and Cook Inlet stocks), killer whale (AT 1 transient), harbor porpoise (southeast Alaska, Gulf of Alaska, and Bering Sea stocks), sperm whale, gray whale, central and western stocks of humpback whales, fin whale, North Pacific right whale, and bowhead whale. The <b>stock</b> <b>assessment</b> reports for all stocks, however, are included in this document to provide a complete reference. Those sections of each <b>stock</b> <b>assessment</b> report containing significant changes are listed in Appendix Table 1. The authors solicit any new information or comments which would improve future <b>stock</b> <b>assessment</b> reports. The U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) has management authority for polar bears, sea otters and walrus. Copies of the <b>stock</b> <b>assessments</b> for these species are included in this NMFS <b>Stock</b> <b>Assessment</b> Report for your convenience...|$|R
40|$|Very {{different}} {{predictions about}} the consequences of alternative management actions often result from applying different assumptions or hypotheses in a <b>stock</b> <b>assessment.</b> Managers are then presented with a variety of results in which the best action depends upon which state of nature is assumed to be true. This paper presents Bayesian decision analysis as an approach to provide empirically based weightings for conflicting <b>stock</b> <b>assessment</b> results and provide scientific guidance to decision makers when they are faced with such conflicting results. A statistically rigorous, non-ad-hoc methodology is proposed to compute such probabilities: application of the sampling importance resampling algorithm to the available <b>stock</b> <b>assessment</b> data. This approach is amenable to be used in conjunction with existing ICCAT <b>stock</b> <b>assessment</b> methods because it can be used in concert with ADAPT VPA methods, catch-age methods, and age-structured and non-age-structured surplus production modeling. Some examples on how to compute probabilities for alternative <b>stock</b> <b>assessment</b> hypotheses are included for situations in which there are alternative hypotheses on (a) regime shifts affecting future recruitment, (b) the mathematical form of the stock-recruit function, and (c) the functional form of a surplus production model. A set of guidelines for choosing th...|$|R

The SSC recognizes that 2005 {{will be an}} exceptional year due to {{the large number of}} stocks being assessed in support of the new, multi-year <b>stock</b> <b>assessment</b> and management process. Modifications to the Council’s long-standing STAR TOR were discussed in light of these changes. The SSC recommends that: 1. The principal process and document content recommendations from the Recreational Catch Per Unit Effort (CPUE) Workshop (June 2004) and <b>Stock</b> <b>Assessment</b> Modeling Workshop (October 2004) be incorporated into the TOR. 2. A minimum of four reviewers should serve on each STAR panel. For panels that review more than three <b>stock</b> <b>assessments,</b> the number of reviewers assigned to a STAR panel should, if at all possible, follow an “n+ 1 ” rule of thumb, where n is the number of <b>stock</b> <b>assessments</b> under review by the panel. 3. For reasons of continuity and efficiency, the SSC representatives on STAR panels should also typically serve as STAR panel chairs. SSC representatives on STAR panels shoul...|$|R
40|$|Some {{challenges}} of using <b>stock</b> <b>assessments</b> in management decisions are data availability and {{the allocation of}} resources to conduct <b>stock</b> <b>assessments</b> in a frequent and timely manner. We conducted a simulation evaluation that included the population dynamics, <b>stock</b> <b>assessment,</b> and management. Our objectives were to 1) determine effects of assessment interval and data-management lag and 2) test methods to reduce data lag by using partial data {{in the last year}} of the assessment. We found that increasing assessment interval and data-management lag caused a decrease in average catch and biomass across scenarios, with data-management lag having a larger effect compared to assessment interval. To reduce the effects of data-management lag, lag reduction methods that included some information about the age-composition of the catch and survey performed about as well as not having lag. <b>Stock</b> <b>assessment</b> interval, data-management lag and lag reduction methods should be considered when designing fishery management plans...|$|R
