5|$|In 1943, due to fear of Allied bombing, {{the prime}} {{minister}} of the Independent State of Croatia (NDH), Nikola Mandić, ordered the creation of a public bomb shelter under the hill of Gornji Grad. The said shelter was to be connected to an east-west corridor spanning the entirety of the hill. A sum of 141.2million NDH kuna was allocated for planning and construction of the tunnel. The project was assigned to engineers Abramović, Senjaković and Vajda. The plan was to construct the tunnel in 90 working days, but the cost rose to 490 million kuna (partly due to high wartime inflation) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>date</b> of opening was delayed into 1944.|$|E
5|$|May25 was {{designated}} as a patriotic date in 1813, but the Argentine Declaration of Independence suggests July9 as an alternative national day. At first this added to the conflicts between Buenos Aires and the provinces during the Argentine Civil War, because the date in May related to Buenos Aires <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>date</b> of July9 related to the whole country. Thus the unitarian Bernardino Rivadavia canceled the celebration of July9, and the federalist Juan Manuel de Rosas allowed it again, but maintained the May celebrations. By 1880, the federalization of Buenos Aires removed the local connotations and the May Revolution was considered {{the birth of the}} nation.|$|E

5|$|The Xukpi Stone is a dedicatory {{monument}} {{from one}} of the earlier phases of the 10L-16 temple constructed to honor K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo'. It bears the date of AD437 and the names both K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' and K'inich Popol Hol, together with a possible mention of the Teotihuacan general Siyaj K'ak'. The monument has not been completely deciphered and its style and phrasing are unusual. Originally it was used as a sculpted bench or step <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>date</b> on the monument is associated with the dedication of a funerary temple or a tomb, probably the tomb of K'inich' Yax K'uk' Mo', which was discovered underneath the same structure.|$|E
