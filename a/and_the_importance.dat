5|$|Although Sadler was a {{committed}} Adventist {{for much of}} his early life, he stayed less involved after John Kellogg was excommunicated in 1907 {{in the wake of a}} conflict with Ellen G.

5|$|During Watts's lifetime, European culture {{had begun}} to {{question}} the concept of hope. A new school of philosophy at the time, based on the thinking of Friedrich Nietzsche, saw hope as a negative attribute that encouraged humanity to expend their energies on futile efforts. The Long Depression of the 1870s wrecked both the economy and confidence of Britain, and Watts felt that the encroaching mechanisation of daily life, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> of material prosperity to Britain's increasingly dominant middle class, were making modern life increasingly soulless.|$|E

5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{important}} shift was a religious one: Thebes effectively became the religious {{as well as the}} political center of the country, its local god Amun credited with inspiring Ahmose in his victories over the Hyksos.

5|$|A typical Robinsonade– a {{genre of}} fiction {{inspired}} by Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe– {{and one of}} the most popular of its type, the book first went on sale in late 1857 and has never been out of print. Among the novel's major themes are the civilising effect of Christianity, 19th-century British imperialism in the South Pacific, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> of hierarchy and leadership. It was the inspiration for William Golding's dystopian novel Lord of the Flies (1954), which inverted the morality of The Coral Island; in Ballantyne's story the children encounter evil, but in Lord of the Flies evil is within them.|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{demonstrates}} how biases produced by verbal comparisons (Choplin & Hummel, 2002) might produce {{a variety of}} phenomena in the psychology of judgment <b>and</b> decision making. <b>The</b> biases produced by verbal comparisons cause people to overestimate <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> of small differences <b>and</b> underestimate <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> of large differences. Simulations will demonstrate that overestimating <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> of small differences <b>and</b> underestimating <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> of large differences from a reference point (default value, status quo, etc.) would produce s-shaped evaluation functions. Simulations will also demonstrate that overestimating <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> of small differences <b>and</b> underestimating <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> of large differences from other contextual stimuli would produce distribution-density effects (often called frequency effects). Because large differences are underestimated, when the variance in people’s unbiased estimates is large as in anchoring effects, these biases will often look like assimilation effects. Biases produced by verbalized social comparisons would also overestimate <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> of small differences <b>and</b> underestimate <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> of large differences so that moderate downward comparisons will produce higher evaluations of the self than will extreme downward comparisons and moderate upward comparisons will produce lower evaluations of the self than will extreme upward comparisons. Comparison strategies might also help explain decoy effects such as asymmetric dominance effects and phantom decoy effects. Testable and falsifiable assumptions of this model are described thereby laying a foundation for future empirical research...|$|R
