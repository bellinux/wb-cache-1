No official project has been announced.|$|E
5|$|Orwell wrote six novels: Burmese Days, A Clergyman's Daughter, Keep the Aspidistra Flying, Coming Up for Air, <b>Animal</b> <b>Farm</b> and Nineteen Eighty-Four. Most {{of these}} were semi-autobiographical. Burmese Days was {{inspired}} by his period working as an imperial policeman and is fictionalized; A Clergyman's Daughter follows {{a young woman who}} passes out from overwork and wakes up an amnesiac, forced to wander the countryside as she finds herself, eventually losing her belief in God, despite being the daughter of a clergyman. Keep the Aspidistra Flying and Coming Up for Air are examinations of the British class system. <b>Animal</b> <b>Farm</b> and Nineteen Eighty-Four are his most famous novels: both are anti-totalitarian books which criticize the Soviet Union in particular.|$|E
40|$|International audienceAnimal urban {{agriculture}} has a {{vital role}} to feed the ever-growing population of African cities. However, {{there is a lack}} of knowledge on <b>animal</b> <b>farming,</b> <b>animal</b> feed and manure recycling in cities. Here, we mapped <b>animal</b> <b>farms</b> in Kampala City. We determined the number and type of animals kept. We identified animal feeds and the manure management practices. The results show that <b>animal</b> <b>farms</b> are predominantly located on the periphery of the city. Poultry are the dominant animal species in the city, followed by pigs, cattle, goats and sheep. The most common feedstuffs are fruit and vegetable peel and pasture. Sixty percent of the animal manure is discarded, whereas 32  % is recycled as fertiliser. Therefore, the fertiliser potential of manure is underutilised...|$|R

It focuses on one particular chicken, Jake Gallo, who is part of the second generation of intelligent chickens. When his father dies, Jake inherits a diary chronicling a struggle for equal rights that spans twenty years. It was favorably compared to George Orwell's <b>Animal</b> <b>Farm</b> and received critical acclaim for its art and seriousness. It won two awards in France and was nominated for one in North America.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, Pink Floyd {{bought a}} three-storey group of church halls at 35 Britannia Row in Islington and began {{converting}} the building into {{a recording studio}} and storage space. In 1976, they recorded their tenth album, Animals, in their newly finished 24-track studio. The concept of Animals originated with Waters, loosely based on George Orwell's political fable, <b>Animal</b> <b>Farm.</b> The album's lyrics described different classes of society as dogs, pigs, and sheep. Hipgnosis received credit for the packaging of Animals; however, Waters designed the final concept, choosing {{an image of the}} ageing Battersea Power Station, over which they superimposed an image of a pig.|$|E

40|$|Current debates {{regarding}} {{animal rights}} and ethics tend to remain {{separated from the}} relevant science and scientific evidence. The aim of this thesis is to therefore help fill this gap by bringing together moral philosophy and {{the scientific study of}} animal welfare in the context of industrial <b>animal</b> <b>farming.</b> Although the facts and research exist, they have so far mostly remained independent of the ethical questions industrial <b>animal</b> <b>farming</b> raises. Discussion will draw upon empirical studies and scientific theory to debate the three main areas of evolutionary closeness, pain and physical discomfort, and psychological suffering to demonstrate how the conditions and practises in industrial <b>farming</b> affect <b>animal</b> welfare. The evidence presented regarding whether animals suffer in industrial conditions is used to conclude that it is not morally acceptable to continue to industrially <b>farm</b> <b>animals.</b> The impacts of industrial <b>animal</b> <b>farming</b> upon the environment, human health, violence and animal welfare additionally demonstrate that this system is of significant relevance to the field of peace studies...|$|R

25|$|Modern {{readers are}} more often {{introduced}} to Orwell as a novelist, particularly through his enormously successful titles <b>Animal</b> <b>Farm</b> and Nineteen Eighty-Four. The former is often thought to reflect degeneration in the Soviet Union after the Russian Revolution {{and the rise of}} Stalinism; the latter, life under totalitarian rule. Nineteen Eighty-Four is often compared to Brave New World by Aldous Huxley; both are powerful dystopian novels warning of a future world where the state machine exerts complete control over social life. In 1984, Nineteen Eighty-Four and Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 were honoured with the Prometheus Award for their contributions to dystopian literature. In 2011 he received it again for <b>Animal</b> <b>Farm.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The {{beginning}} of intensive <b>animal</b> <b>farming</b> is traceable to 1923 in the Delmarva Peninsula, where Celia Steele raised her first flock of chickens for meat. Starting in the 1940s, intensive confinement and genetic selection of chickens for characteristics like growth rate, weight, and {{feed conversion efficiency}} allowed farmers to obtain chicken meat much more efficiently, while leading to many welfare concerns including painful skeletal problems. [...] Pigs and cows were raised in industrial farming operations starting in the 1960s. [...] Largely due to the efficiencies brought by industrial <b>animal</b> <b>farming,</b> American meat consumption (and therefore the number of <b>animals</b> in industrial <b>farming</b> facilities) rose dramatically beginning in the 1940s.|$|R
