40|$|We {{develop a}} duopoly model with {{advertising}} supported platforms and analyze incentives of a superior firm to license its advanced technologies to an inferior rival. We highlight {{the role of}} two technologies characteristic for media platforms: the technology to produce content and to place advertisements. Licensing incentives are driven solely by indirect network effects arising from the aversion of users to advertising. We establish a relationship between licensing incentives {{and the nature of}} technology, the decision variable on the advertiser side, and the structure of platforms’ revenues. Only the technology to place advertisements is licensed. If users are charged for access, licensing incentives vanish. Licensing increases the advertising intensity, benefits advertisers and harms users.

As we can easy check up Romanian borrows more words from English especially in domains like informatics, business, management, marketing, but also in fashion, music, showbiz and even in Romanian argotic language.
