The South Atlantic catch limit was later increased in October 2012 as <b>a</b> <b>response</b> to the increased population. The 2013 limits in the southern U.S. Atlantic waters for the species, measured in gutted weight, is currently 405,971 pounds for longline and 135,324 pounds for hook-and-line fishing.|$|E
