The different transmitters can cooperate by donating energy to each other. The tradeoff among the weighted sum throughput, the use of grid energy, {{and the amount of}} energy cooperation is studied through an optimization objective which is a linear combination of these quantities. This leads to an optimization problem with O($N^ 2 K$) constraints, where $N$ is the total number of transmitter-receiver pairs, and the optimization is over seven sets of variables that denote energy and bandwidth allocation, grid energy utilization, and energy cooperation. To solve the problem efficiently, an iterative algorithm is proposed using the Proximal Jacobian ADMM. The optimization sub-problems corresponding to Proximal Jacobian ADMM steps are solved in closed form. We show that this algorithm converges to the optimal solution with an overall complexity of O($N^ 2 K^ 2 $).

For the orthogonal broadcast channel, we further formulate a proportionally-fair (PF) throughput maximization problem and derive the equivalence conditions such that the optimal solution can be obtained by solving a weighted throughput maximization problem. Further, the algorithm to obtain the proper weights is proposed.

We investigate the problem of designing a secondary spectrum trading market when there are multiple sellers and multiple buyers and propose a general framework for the trading market based on an auction mechanism. To this end, we first introduce a new optimal auction mechanism, called the generalized Branco’s mechanism (GBM). The GBM, which is both incentive compatible and individually rational, is {{used to determine the}} <b>assigned</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>bands</b> and prices for them. Second, we assume that buyers of the spectrum are selfish and model their interaction as a noncooperative game. Using this model, we prove that when the sellers employ the GBM to vend their <b>frequency</b> <b>bands,</b> they can guarantee themselves the largest expected profits by selling their <b>frequency</b> <b>bands</b> jointly. Third, based on the previous finding, we model the interaction among the sellers as a cooperative game and demonstrate that, for any fixed strategies of the buyers, the core of the cooperative game is nonempty.

3000|$|A {{conventional}} {{wireless transmission}} system is usually allocated a specific <b>frequency</b> <b>band</b> for data communications. These wireless transmissions are usually licensed, {{which means they}} possess exclusive rights to the <b>assigned</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>bands.</b> Although much of the wireless spectrum up to 3 GHz has been assigned to licensed wireless applications, several measurements campaigns have shown that {{a substantial portion of}} the licensed <b>frequency</b> <b>bands</b> are underutilized across the temporal, spectral, and spatial domains [5]. To continue providing sufficient spectral bandwidth for satisfying both current and future wireless access needs, both spectrum policy makers and communication technologists have proposed an innovative approach with respect to the wireless spectrum usage via opportunistic spectrum access (OSA). Relative to traditional approaches for accessing spectrum, OSA allows for unlicensed wireless users to temporarily [...] "borrow" [...] unoccupied licensed <b>frequency</b> <b>bands</b> [6]. However, these unlicensed (i.e., secondary) devices must still guarantee interference-free wireless access to incumbent licensed (i.e., primary) signals. In particular, it is essential that the OOB radiation generated by the SU wireless device is mitigated in order to prevent interference with PU wireless signals located in the frequency vicinity. Consequently, given this constraint on SU wireless transceivers, communication systems performing OSA require a level of spectral agility in order to operate in the presence of PU signals, especially when it comes to mitigating interference resulting from OOB radiation, as well as simultaneously transmitting across several unoccupied <b>frequency</b> <b>bands</b> that are fragmented across the wireless spectrum whose aggregate bandwidth satisfies the secondary transmission requirements.|$|R

In cognitive radios, the sparse <b>assigned</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>bands</b> are opened to secondary users, provided that interference induced on the primary licensees is negligible. Cognitive radios are established in two steps: the radios firstly sense the available <b>frequency</b> <b>bands</b> by detecting the presence of primary users and secondly communicate using the bands that {{have been identified as}} not in use by the primary users. In this thesis we investigate how to improve the efficiency of cognitive radio networks when multiple cognitive radios cooperate to sense the spectrum or control their interferences. A major challenge in the design of cooperating devices lays in the need for exchange of information between these devices. Therefore, in this thesis we identify three specific types of control information exchange whose efficiency can be improved. Specifically, we first study how cognitive radios can efficiently exchange sensing information with a coordinator node when the reporting channels are noisy. Then, we propose distributed learning algorithms allowing to allocate the primary network sensing times and the secondary transmission powers within the secondary network. Both distributed allocation algorithms minimize the need for information exchange compared to centralized allocation algorithms.

Femtocells were proposed for Long Term Evolution (LTE) for indoor coverage. It is achieved using access points by home users. However, co-channel interference is a serious issue with femtocells that may dramatically reduce the performance of femto and macrocells. The system capacity and throughput decreases. As femtocells use the same spectrum as the macrocells, and the femtocells are deployed without proper planning, interference from femtocells to macrocells becomes a major issue. In this thesis, the interference from femtocells to macrocells is studied and a solution for the mitigation {{of this kind of}} interference is suggested using FFR mechanism. In our proposed scheme for interference avoidance, femtocells use those <b>frequency</b> sub <b>bands</b> which are currently not being used within the macrocell, the process of <b>assigning</b> the <b>frequency</b> <b>bands</b> is based on FFR. The simulation results suggest that the suggested technique enhances total/edge throughputs, and optimizes the SINR and CDF of femtocells users (FUEs) and reduces the outage probability of the network...|$|R
40|$|The channel {{assignment}} problem in radio or cellular phone networks is the following: {{we need to}} <b>assign</b> radio <b>frequency</b> <b>bands</b> to transmitters (each station gets one channel which corresponds to an integer). In order to avoid interference, if two stations are very close, then {{the separation of the}} channels assigned to them has to be large enough. Moreover, if two stations are close (but not very close), then they must also receive channels that are sufficiently apart. Such problem may be modelled by L(p, q) -labellings of a graph G. The vertices of this graph correspond to the transmitters and two vertices are linked by an edge if they are very close. Two vertices are then considered close if they are at distance 2 in the graph. Let dist(u, v) denote the distance between the two vertices u and v. An L(p, q) -labelling of G is an integer assignment f to the vertex set V (G) such that: • |f(u) − f(v) | ≥ p, if dist(u, v) = 1, and • |f(u) − f(v) | ≥ q, if dist(u, v) = 2. As the separation between channels assigned to vertices at distance 2 cannot be smaller than the separation between channels assigned to vertices at distance 1, it is often assumed that p ≥ q. The span of f is the difference between the largest and the smallest labels of f plus one. The λp,qnumbe...|$|R
40|$|Thin {{films of}} Pr 1 -xCaxMnO 3 (x= 0. 5, 0. 6) {{deposited}} on LaAlO 3 and SrTiO 3 substrates {{have been studied}} by Raman spectroscopy at low temperatures in order to investigate the effect of strains from the Ca doping or the substrate. A detailed assignment of the observed bands is suggested based on the present observations and published results on manganites. We <b>assign</b> the low <b>frequency</b> <b>bands</b> to modes involving only displacements of the A-site ions from their mass dependence by the Ca substitution for Pr (Pr/Ca-O modes). The A(g) (2) mode, which {{is related to the}} tilting angle of the MnO 6 octahedra, appears strongly coupled with the carriers and is very sensitive to the strain effects. Based on the Raman data obtained from the film cross sectional area, we extract the strain distribution across the film. Besides, we calculate in the pseudocubic approximation the phonon deformation potentials, the Gruneisen parameter, and the bulk modulus of the film, which are in. good agreement with the ultrasonic measurements.
