50|$|In 2000 Koen Brams was {{appointed}} {{director of the}} Jan van Eyck Academy. The institute's program, as indicated in the policy plan, was described as {{the sum of all}} research and production undertaken. A new artistic <b>advisory</b> <b>structure</b> was introduced: advising researchers of the three departments (fine art, design and art theory) carry out departmental tasks together. In every department a core team of advising researchers is active. They initiate and supervise research projects, but their tasks also include programming, selection, studio visits, lectures, seminars, presentations and institutional and policy matters. Since 2001 the academy's weekly program is accessible to the public; opening up the institute has invited more critical response.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Basic {{human needs}} {{combined}} with political processes and societal requirements periodically make visionary political leadership (VPL) unavoidable and functionally necessary. But VPL is highly risky, often leading to catastrophes. Foreseeable situations sharpen the dilemma, making VPL more likely and more necessary while also increasing its dangers, thanks to modern technologies. Therefore {{it is essential}} to improve VPL. Eight proposals for improvement are presented in this article: selection and election of VPL; training, education, and insight upgrading of VPL; <b>advisory</b> <b>structures</b> for VPL; practical vision developing organiza-tions; procedures for democratic choice among practical visions; special implementation instruments; procedures for removal of dangerous VPL; and international control and containment of fanatical VPL. The neoplatonic nature of such proposals is recognized. But without far-reaching innovations, there is no hope of improving VPL, its needed functions will not be properly satisfied, and, instead, serious consequences, because of its pathologies, will be unavoidable. A short {{look at the history of}} human governance demonstrates the importance of periodic visionary political leadership (VPL) of various types, as illustrated b...|$|R
40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{to look at}} middle school teacher-based advisory programs in sixteen states across the nation. Over 200 schools were surveyed with analyses from administrator, teacher, and student responses. Regression analyses were conducted on a hierarchical basis with respect to school location, <b>advisory</b> <b>structure</b> (length and duration of advisory programs), advisory practices (academic and career issues, parental contact, individual meetings with students, study hall projects, linkages to guidance and health, leadership, and adjustment and health issues), teacher attitudes (job role strain, job satisfaction, parental contact, burnout total, and school climate), and student experiences (anxiety, depression, recognition, school transition, teacher expectations, self esteem, self expectations, school environment scale, school safety, and advisory assistance) and their effects on student grades and classroom behaviors. Although few middle schools nationwide have fully implemented advisory programs, lessons {{can be learned from}} the ones that do. The findings indicated that frequency and duration of advisory meetings do matter and what practices teachers employ during these meetings may {{have a significant impact on}} teacher job satisfaction, student adjustment, and ultimately, student achievement. If teacher-based advisory programming was analyzed over a longer period of time with higher levels of implementation in a larger percentage of schools, more conclusive results might be found...|$|E
40|$|Master of EducationThis {{study was}} {{commissioned}} as a formative {{evaluation of the}} Austin Hospital's Community Advisory Committee (CAC) and its working parties. The CAC was the Hospital's attempt to establish and develop dialogue with its community. Also the structure provided {{a model for other}} Victorian hospitals attempting to establish interaction with their communities. The aim of the study was twofold: to investigate the successes and identify areas for improvement in the operation of the CAC; and to develop a provisional normative theory for the development and operation of a hospital and community <b>advisory</b> <b>structure</b> of this kind. Questionnaires and interviews of key informants were used to gather information. Content analysis was used to organise the data into meaningful categories. Findings from the questionnaire related to four areas: membership and structure of the CAC and its working parties; the terms of reference of the CAC; the mode of operation of the CAC and its working parties; and future directions of the CAC and its working parties. Members found that the CAC provided a unique opportunity to discuss, debate and share information with a diverse range of health advisers, planners and providers. But a strong need was expressed for further consumer and community representation on the Committee. Perceptions differed about the success of the Committee and its working parties in meeting the terms of reference. Underlying these differences may be the need for stronger communication between the Hospital Board of Management, the Committee and its working parties to ensure members are equally informed. Members strongly valued the opportunity to act on issues rather than just discuss areas of concern. The working parties were perceived to be the main strength of the Committee structure due to their action orientation. Suggestions for future directions of the. Committee and its working parties ranged from improving service provision to issues such as consumer rights and resource allocation. The interviews gathered important additional information in three main areas: communication; commitment; and the direction of the working parties. Analysis of this data flagged the following issues: i) the need for stronger communication between the CAC and the working parties, including the vital role of the Chairs of the working parties in providing leadership and communication; ii) concern about the apparently centralised role of the Chair of the CAC; iii) the need for selection criteria for the Chairs and members of the CAC structure; and, iv) the importance of orientation, training and continuing education of members. Significantly, some of the most successful projects of the CAC were linked to the notion of the Hospital responding {{to the needs of the}} community. Following discussion of the findings, several conclusions were drawn. These include the need to: i) adequately resource the CAC and its working parties; ii) strengthen the role of the community in the areas of policy and planning, funding and service provision; iii) improve the consumer and broad community representation on the CAC and working parties; iv) strengthen linkages to the Hospital's Board of Management; v) address the issues of the balance of power on the CAC together with empowering CAC and working party members; vi) undertake annual planning and evaluation sessions, with the emphasis on actionorientation and responding to the needs of the community; vii) ensure the Chairs of the CAC and its working parties have adequate leadership skills; and, viii) develop orientation, training and continuing education programs for members. The evaluation provided the opportunity to propose a normative program theory for the development and operation of a successful hospital community <b>advisory</b> <b>structure.</b> The model was based on a concept map using the four levels of principles, structures, mechanisms and outcomes. This map is an overall conceptual framework for the development and operation of a hospital community advisory committee. Further it may be used to improve the function of a community <b>advisory</b> <b>structure</b> that is already operating. It was theorised that the successful development and operation of such a structure is based on the following principles: participation; accountability; equity; and access. The structure consists of a main committee, chaired by a committed, skilled senior hospital person, and relevant standing and ad hoc working parties, chaired by skilled and committed community leaders. Members of the committee and its working parties can include: members of the hospital board of management; consumer representatives; hospital and community managers; hospital and community service providers; and local government councillors and health care workers. Members of the committee and its working parties can take a range of actions to contribute to the desired outcomes for the hospital and the community. These include: assessing the needs and problems of the community; developing goals and objectives; planning and implementing policies, programs or services; evaluating projects; and participating in orientation, training and continuing education of members. These activities can be undertaken in the key areas of: policy making and planning; funding; and service provision. The activities in the aforementioned areas may be implemented in the fields of: health education and health promotion; patient care; rehabilitation, domiciliary and palliative care; and health care of disadvantaged groups. The desired outcomes can include: less inappropriate hospital admissions; improved discharge planning; enhanced continuity of care; and diminished duplication in service provision. Overall the result can be a more responsive, effective, efficient and higher quality health care for the consumers of health care services. Many of the aspects of this framework remain problematic. For example, the role of the hospital in health education and health promotion and member's level of participation in policy making and planning. Further, issues such as adequate resourcing of the committee structure, the skills and commitment of the key players and issues related to the balance of power on the committee and working parties require discussion and debate. Addressing such issues remains crucial to the successful development and operation of a hospital community <b>advisory</b> <b>structure</b> and ultimately the outcomes for consumers of health care services.

40|$|A {{thorough}} {{evaluation and}} prioritisation of the ESO science programme into the 2020 + timeframe took {{place under the}} auspices of a working group, comprising astronomers drawn from ESO’s <b>advisory</b> <b>structure</b> and from within ESO. This group reported to ESO’s Scientific Technical Committee, and to ESO Council, concluding the exercise with the publication of a report, “Science Priorities at ESO”. A community poll and a dedicated workshop, held in January 2015, formed part of the information gathering process. The community poll was designed to probe the demographics of the user community, its scientific interests, use of observing facilities and plans for use of future telescopes and instruments, its views on types of observing programmes and on the provision of data processing and archiving. A total of 1775 full responses to the poll were received and an analysis of the results is presented here. Foremost is the importance of regular observing programmes on all ESO observing facilities, in addition to Large Programmes and Public Surveys. There was also a strong community requirement for ESO to process and archive data obtained at ESO facilities. Other aspects, especially those related to future facilities, are more challenging to interpret because of biases related to the distribution of science expertise and favoured wavelength regime amongst the targeted audience. The results of the poll formed a fundamental component of the report and pro-vide useful data to guide the evolution of ESO’s science programme...|$|E

It is a result of having lasting positive relationships with teachers leading to a feeling of connectedness to their school. Research supports the role of personalization and school belongingness through their correlation with a number of positive educational and behavioral outcomes. High sense of school belonging is associated with an increase in educational variables such as high grades and academic motivation, and a decrease in school drop out and behavior problems. This study examined the relationship between an advisory program and students 2 ̆ 7 sense of school belonging in one high school with a sample of 1144 students and 112 teachers. School belonging was measured using the Psychological Sense of School Membership Scale (Goodenow, 1993) and the School Connection Scale (Brown, Leigh, 2 ̆ 6 Barton, 2000). A single school quasi-experimental design with multiple regression methods was employed, which examined the relationship between the <b>advisory</b> <b>structure,</b> student perceptions of their advisory experience, and sense of school belonging.
