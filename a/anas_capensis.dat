50|$|The Cape teal (<b>Anas</b> <b>capensis)</b> is a 44-46 cm long dabbling duck of open {{wetlands}} in sub-Saharan Africa.|$|E
50|$|The bird {{sanctuary}} has about 165 species of birds; the lesser and greater flamingos, great white pelican (Pelecanus onocrotalus) and pink-backed pelican (Pelecanus rufescens) {{are the most}} dominant species, they arrive annually in large numbers {{as part of their}} migration during the winter season. Some of the other notable bird species recorded are: avocet, blackwinged stilt (Himantopus himantopus), blacksmith lapwing (Vanellus armatus), black-necked grebe (Podiceps nigricollis), bustards, carmine, darters, African fish eagle (Haliaeetus vocifer), geese, korhaans, pied kingfisher (Ceryle rudis), black-chested snake-eagle (Circaetus pectoralis), blue-cheeked bee-eater (Merops persicus), Cape teal (<b>Anas</b> <b>capensis),</b> kori bustard (Ardeotis kori), Hottentot teal (Anas hottentota), martial eagle (Polemaetus bellicosus), red-knobbed coot, (Fulica cristata), secretarybird (Sagittarius serpentarius), spoonbills, and white-faced whistling duck (Dendrocygna viduata).|$|E
40|$|Thirty-four {{species of}} {{gastrointestinal}} helminths {{were found in}} 25 Anas undulata, 21 Anas erythrorhyncha, ten <b>Anas</b> <b>capensis</b> and seven Anas smithii collected at Barberspan, South Africa. Excluding four new taxa, 11 new African records, and 14, 11, 12 and nine new host records were established for Anas undulata, Anas erythrorhyncha, <b>Anas</b> <b>capensis</b> and Anas smithii, respectively. The helminth community included 13 cosmopolitan species, seven species known only from the holarctic, one species known only from the south Pacific and 13 new or unidentified species {{that appear to be}} restricted to Africa. The infection levels of the common helminth species in the mainly carnivorous <b>Anas</b> <b>capensis</b> and Anas smithii, were generally much higher than those of species infecting Anas undulata or Anas erythrorhyncha.

40|$|Echinocotyle capensis n. sp. is {{described}} from Cape shovelers (Anas smithii (Hartert)) and Cape teal (<b>Anas</b> <b>capensis</b> Gmelin) collected at Barberspan, Transvaal Province, Republic of South Africa. Echinocotyle capensis {{is a small}} cestode up to 1. 62 mm long with 10 rostellar hooks 50 – 55 μm long. It most closely resembles Echinocotyle singhi Srivastava and Pandey, 1980 but has slightly longer rostellar hooks and a shorter cirrus sac, and lacks the vaginal sphincter present in E. singhi...|$|E
40|$|Monogamy {{is thought}} to be the usual mating system in dabbling ducks and docum ented cases of bigamy are very rare for any Anas species (Lebret 1961). The {{following}} observations on wild-caught Cape Teal <b>Anas</b> <b>capensis,</b> breeding in flight pens, show th a t bigamy is pos sible in this species and suggest th a t it may be expected to occur in wild birds. On 3 May 1976, 11 full-winged Cape Teal (5 males, 6 females) were released in a flight pen measuring 27. 5 m x 27. 5 m x 3. 6 m (described in McKinney 1967). These birds had been captured as adults at S trandfontein, Cape Province, South Africa in 1974. They were in dividually m arked with coloured plastic nasal discs (females) or nasal saddles (males). Observations were made for 3 hours, starting at first light, on 2 of every 3 mornings from 4 May to 24 August (to ta l 228 hours). O ther watches at various tim es of day totalled 36 hours. One pair-bond existed before the birds were released (pair A) bu t after a period of intense social courtship 2 more pairs had form ed by 13 May. During these courtship bouts, females directed the pointing (= th rea t) com ponent o f inciting tow ard other females as well as tow ard males, an unusual pattern in dabbling ducks where typically inciting is used to indicate rejection o f a courting male (Lorenz 1951 - 53; Weidmann 1956...|$|E
40|$|Examination of the {{helminth}} {{communities in}} 25 yellow-billed ducks (Anas undulata), 21 red-billed ducks (Anas erythrorhyncha), ten Cape teal (<b>Anas</b> <b>capensis)</b> and seven Cape shovellers (Anas smithii) that had overwintered at Barberspan, revealed differences in community structure. Infracommunities in yellow-billed and red-billed ducks {{were characterized by}} low diversity and high eveness, and generally consisted of less than 100 helminths per duck. Similarity values (mean percent similarity and mean Jaccard's coefficients) were low. In contrast, infracommunities in Cape teal and Cape shovellers were more diverse, displayed low eveness values and consisted of far greater numbers of helminths. Mean similarity values for the infracommunities in Cape teal and Cape shovellers were much higher than those in yellow-billed or red-billed ducks. The component communities in all four duck hosts were species rich. Those in yellow-billed and red-billed ducks, however, consisted predominantly of satellite species and no core species were present, whereas those in Cape teal and Cape shoveller included several core species. Cape teal and Cape shovellers each had a group of recurrent species but {{there was not much}} of a tendency for species to co-occur in yellow-billed and red-billed ducks. Multivariate analysis revealed a greater similarity between the communities in Cape teal and Cape shovellers than between the latter and the communities in yellow- billed or red-billed ducks. Communities in Cape teal and Cape shovellers could be distinguished from each other by {{the presence or absence of}} particular cestode species. The communities in these two species could be distinguished from those in yellow-billed or red-billed ducks by a suite of cestode species that was absent in the latter two. Two recurrent groups, consisting of eight and two species, were identified in the compound community. Each group consisted of species found predominantly in Cape teal and Cape shovellers. Patterns seen in the helminth communities of the various hosts reflected differences in diet, but other factors, including feeding behaviour, spatial segregation and host specificity, may also have had an effect.

This portfolio {{was published}} by the Field Museum of Natural History in 1930 in an edition consisting of a slipcased set of 32 separate 10 ” × 12 ” lithographed plates on 10 -point (approximately) natural-white stock. Each image was backed with a brief description. The images were presented within warm gray borders of approximately 1 ”. Some plates were vertical, others horizontal, depending on the image; the descriptions on the back reflected {{the orientation of the}} front image. The portfolio also included a 4 -page folio leaflet containing a 3 -page essay by Wilfred Osgood and a “List of Subjects. ” The electronic edition presented here was prepared from a copy of the original published portfolio held by the Special Collections Department of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Libraries. This copy was received as a gift from Mrs. C. Harold Claytor. Scanning was done by the Center for Digital Research in the Humanities. Images were scanned at 300 dpi and saved as RGB files in JPEG format. Color corrections were made using Adobe Photoshop and the layouts were done in Adobe InDesign by Paul Royster of the Office of Scholarly Communication. The electronic edition is presented as 12 ” × 12 ” pages to allow for both vertical and horizontal images. The reverse-side descriptions, originally printed in medium gray, are shown here in black. All images are shown at their original size. Some slight damage to edges of the borders of a few plates have been electronically restored. The portfolio was published without copyright notice, making it public domain according to the law in force at that time...|$|E
