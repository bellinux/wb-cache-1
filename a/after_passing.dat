40|$|The {{microstructure}} {{evolution and}} properties {{variation of the}} surface layer of rail steel <b>after</b> <b>passed</b> 500 and 1000 million tons of gross weight (MTGW) have been investigated. The wear rate increases to 3 and 3. 4 times <b>after</b> <b>passed</b> 500 and 1000 MTGW, respectively. The corresponding friction coefficient decreases by 1. 4 and 1. 1 times. The cementite plates were destroyed and formed the cementite particles of around 10 - 50 nm in size <b>after</b> <b>passed</b> 500 MTGW. The early stage dynamical recrystallization was observed <b>after</b> <b>passed</b> 1000 MTGW. The mechanisms for these have been suggested. The large number of bend extinction contours is revealed in the surface layer. The internal stress field is evaluated...|$|R

5|$|A {{light ray}} {{emanating from the}} source S is {{reflected}} by a beam splitter G and is collimated into a parallel beam by lens L. <b>After</b> <b>passing</b> the slits O1 and O2, two rays of light travel through the tubes A1 and A2, through which water is streaming {{back and forth as}} shown by the arrows. The rays reflect off a mirror m at the focus of lens L, so that one ray always propagates {{in the same direction as}} the water stream, and the other ray opposite to the direction of the water stream. <b>After</b> <b>passing</b> back and forth through the tubes, both rays unite at S, where they produce interference fringes that can be visualized through the illustrated eyepiece. The interference pattern can be analyzed to determine the speed of light traveling along each leg of the tube.|$|E

40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to evaluate the microstructural evolution occurring in pure aluminium and a spray-cast Al- 7034 alloy after processing through equal-channel angular pressing (ECAP). Electron back-scatter diffraction (EBSD) {{was used to determine}} the grain boundary misorientations and the texture after ECAP and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was employed to evaluate the nature of thermal effects taking place during heating. The results demonstrate there is an increase in the fraction of boundaries having high angles of misorientation with increasing strain. For pure aluminium, there is an S texture { 122 } <b>after</b> 4 <b>passes</b> and a brass texture { 011 } <b>after</b> 8 <b>passes.</b> For the Al- 7034 alloy, the textures changes from a fibre x texture in the as-received condition to a y <b>after</b> 1 <b>pass,</b> y <b>after</b> 4 <b>passes</b> and z <b>after</b> 8 <b>passes.</b> For the Al- 7034 alloy, the DSC analysis identifies the occurrence of several thermal effects during heating involving the formation, coarsening, dissolution and melting of the ?-phase...|$|R
