40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Before approving a drug, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) assesses a drug's effectiveness. This assessment may be <b>based</b> <b>on</b> evidence showing that a drug has {{a positive impact on}} a surrogate endpoint [...] a laboratory measure, such as blood pressure [...] instead of more direct clinical evidence, like preventing strokes. After approval, FDA often requires or requests a drug sponsor to further study the drug. Concerns have been raised about FDA's reliance on surrogate endpoints and its oversight of postmarketing studies. This report provides information on (1) all drug applications <b>approved</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> surrogate endpoints in FDA's accelerated approval process, (2) a subset of applications for potentially innovative drugs <b>approved</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> surrogate endpoints under FDA's traditional process, and (3) FDA's oversight of postmarketing studies. GAO identified drugs <b>approved</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> surrogate endpoints, obtained the status of related postmarketing studies, and reviewed FDA's oversight of a sample of 35 studies it required under its accelerated approval process, selected to include studies which were at varying levels of completion. ...|$|R

40|$|Ideally clinicians should {{base their}} {{treatment}} decision on results from randomised controlled trials which include patient-important outcomes, such as quality of life, prevented disease events or death. Conducting such trials often involves large samples sizes and extended follow-up periods. Therefore, researchers {{have aimed to}} conduct trials with surrogate endpoints by substituting patient-important outcomes {{in order to reduce}} sample size and observation time. Surrogate endpoints are outcomes that substitute for direct measures of how a patient feels, functions, or survives. In many countries drugs are <b>approved</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> data from surrogate endpoint trials. Recently, a controversy has evolved on the reliability of results generated from surrogate endpoint trials driven by unanticipated side effects or severe toxicity leading to the withdrawal of drugs that were solely <b>approved</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> evidence from surrogate endpoint trials. We present some recent examples and criteria how clinicians can critically evaluate the validity of claims by experts or the pharmaceutical industry in regard to the expected patients' benefit from drugs approved by results from surrogate endpoint trials...|$|R
