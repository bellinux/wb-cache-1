Based on these studies, it has been seen that when the sugar substrate binds to the enzyme there is a rotation in the C-terminal domain of the protein. This changes the active site from an open cleft in the <b>apo-enzyme</b> into a nearly solvent inaccessible pocket. This theme of conformational flexibility, {{particularly with regard to}} the C-terminal domain of these enzymes, has been observed in multiple proteins in the superfamily.|$|E

These genes, termed InvA1,2,3,4,5 and 6, were overexpressed in E. coli and the genes were characterized by co-incubating the <b>apo-enzyme</b> with 4-HPP to determine the formation of atromentin as noted by its characteristic UV-Vis spectrum and monoisotopic mass.

ITP3K is highly specific for the 1,4,5-isomer of IP3, and it exclusively phosphorylates the 3-OH position.

40|$|The {{ability of}} rat liver zinc-thionein to donate its metal to the <b>apo-enzymes</b> of the zinc enzymes horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase, yeast aldolase, thermolysin, Escherichia coli {{alkaline}} phosphatase and bovine erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase was investigated. Zinc-thionein {{was as good}} as, or better than, ZnSO 4, Zn(CH 3 CO 2) 2 or Zn(NO 3) 2 in donating its zinc to these <b>apo-enzymes.</b> Apo-(alcohol dehydrogenase) could not be reactivated by zinc salts or by zinc-thionein. Incubation of the other <b>apo-enzymes</b> with near-saturating amounts of zinc as ZnSO 4, Zn(CH 3 CO 2) 2, Zn(NO 3) 2, or zinc-thionein resulted in reactivation of the <b>apo-enzymes.</b> With apo-aldolase zinc-thionein gave 100 % reactivation within 30 min. Reactivation by ZnSO 4 and Zn(CH 3 CO 2) 2 was complete and instantaneous. Zinc-thionein was somewhat better than Zn(NO 3) 2 in completely reactivating apo-thermolysin. With apo-(alkaline phosphatase) 43 % reactivation was obtained with Zn(CH 3 CO 2) 2 and 18 % with zinc-thionein. With apo-(carbonic anhydrase) zinc-thionein was better than ZnSO 4, Zn(CH 3 CO 2) 2 or Zn(NO 3) 2, with a maximal reactivation of 54 %. That zinc was really being transferred from zinc-thionein to apo-(carbonic anhydrase) was shown {{by the fact that}} 2, 6 -pyridine dicarboxylic acid and 1, 10 -phenanthroline had minimal effects on the reactivation of apo-(carbonic anhydrase) when added after the incubation {[apo-(carbonic anhydrase) +zinc thionein]+chelator}, but inhibited reactivation when added before the incubation {apo-(carbonic anhydrase) +[zinc-thionein+chelator]}. These observations support the idea that zinc-thionein can function in zinc homeostasis as a reservoir of zinc, releasing the metal to zinc-requiring metalloenzymes according to need...|$|R
40|$|The {{reaction}} of iodine with glyceraldehyde 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase from Bacillus stearothermophilus was investigated. The active-site thiol {{group of the}} cysteine residue homologous with cysteine- 149 in the pig muscle enzyme was protected by reaction with tetrathionate. The apoenzyme was readily inhibited by KI 3 solution at pH 8, but the coenzyme, NAD+, protected the enzyme against inhibition and decreased the extent of iodination. At pH 9. 5, ready inhibition of both apo- and holo-enzyme was observed. Tryptic peptides containing residues iodinated at pH 8 were isolated and characterized. One of the most reactive residues in both holo- and <b>apo-enzymes</b> was a tyrosine homologous with tyrosine- 46 in the pig muscle enzyme, and this residue was iodinated without loss of enzymic activity. Other reactive tyrosine residues in the apoenzyme were in positions homologous with residues 178, 273, 283 and 311 in the pig muscle enzyme, {{but they were not}} readily iodinated in the holoenzyme. Histidine residues in both holo- and <b>apo-enzymes</b> were iodinated at pH 8 in sequence positions homologous with residues 50, 162 and 190 in the pig muscle enzyme. The inhibition of the enzyme was not correlated with the iodination of a particular residue. The results are discussed in relation to a three-dimensional model based on the structure of the lobster muscle enzyme and demonstrate that conformational changes affecting the reactivity of several tyrosine residues most probably occur on binding of the coenzyme...|$|R
40|$|To {{clarify the}} {{functions}} of the renal metallothioneins (MTs) in rats following ischemic acute renal failure, the expression of MT mRNA and the localization of MT in rats undergoing 60 min of bilateral renal artery clamp ischemia followed by reperfusion was examined by Northern blot analysis, in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analysis. Induction of maximum at 1 to 3 days followed by a gradual decrease. Histlogically, both MT mRNA and MT were detected in renal tubular cells intensely and specifically in the outer medulla at 1 day after release of the clamp. These findings suggest that MTs protect the tubular cells by scavenging the free radicals, which probably cause renal tubular cell damage by ischemia-reperfusion, and that MTs provide the zinc ions to zinc-requiring <b>apo-enzymes</b> necessary for healing and regenerating renal tubular cells...|$|R
50|$|The {{aromatic}} {{amino acid}} L-tyrosin is the precusor to 4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid, and 2 units of 4-HPP are condensed to form atromentin. The initial step is deamination via an aminotransferase. The second step is catalzyed by a nonribosomal peptide synthetase-like enzyme (NRPS-like, {{because it does}} not have a canonical condensation domain, called the atromentin/quinone synthetase). The adenylation domain of this NRPS-like enzyme accepts 4-HPP as determined by the ATP-PPi-exchange assay. The enzyme, when produced in E. coli, needs to be primed to its holo form via a phosphopantetheinyl transferase (Ppant), although E. coli can in vivo prime the <b>apo-enzyme</b> (e.g. via EntD). Ppants have been successfully used from cDNA derived from A. nidulans (e.g. NpgA), Streptomyces verticillus (Svp), and Paxillus involutus. A few studies, notably from the bacterium Burkholderia thailandensis by Biggins et al., have shown that the aminotransferase gene may be absent, and this activity can be supplied via its primary metabolism.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe binding of {{vanadate}} to {{the novel}} vanadium chloroperoxidase from C. inaequalis was investigated. Reconstitution experiments of apochloroperoxidase by vanadate at different pH values showed that in the pH 6 – 7 range an acid/base group is present which affects the binding of the vanadate. It is proposed that this group is a histidine. This hypothesis was tested by specifically modifying this residue using diethylpyrocarbonate. In the <b>apo-enzyme</b> 9 histidines were modified, whereas in the holo-enzyme 6 histidines were modified. Modification with diethylpyrocarbonate {{had no effect on}} the chlorinating activity of the holo-enzyme, but when the <b>apo-enzyme</b> was modified the reactivation by vanadate was strongly inhibited. We conclude that histidine in the active site of chloroperoxidase is involved in the binding of vanadate...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Comparison of the crystallographic and NMR {{structures}} of 6 -hydroxymethyl- 7, 8 -dihydropterin pyrophosphokinase (HPPK) {{suggests that the}} enzyme may undergo significant conformational change upon binding to its first substrate, ATP. Two of the three surface loops (loop 2 and loop 3) accounting {{for most of the}} conformational differences appear to be confined by crystal contacts, raising questions about the putative large-scale induced-fit conformational change of HPPK and the functional roles of the conserved side-chain residues on the loops. To investigate the loop dynamics in crystal-free environment, we carried out molecular dynamics and locally enhanced sampling simulations of the <b>apo-enzyme</b> and the HPPK MgATP complex. Our simulations showed that the crystallographic B-factors underestimated the loop dynamics considerably. We found that the open-conformation of loop 3 in the binary complex is accessible to the <b>apo-enzyme</b> and is the favored conformation in solution phase. These results revise our previous view of HPPK-substrate interactions and the associated functional mechanism of conformational change. The lessons learned here offer valuable structural insights into the workings of HPPK and should be useful for structure-based drug design...|$|E
40|$|The {{structure}} of the unique metal-binding protein, metallothionein (MT), consists of two metal-thiolate-clustered binding domains; the β-domain binds up to three divalent metals and the α-domain binds four. The mechanisms through which the metals are bound and arranged into domains, {{as well as the}} function of MT in metal ion homeostasis, remains largely unknown. By utilizing electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI MS) to identify each species, and by comparing the data with simulations, MT 1 a was found to bind Zn 2 + non-cooperatively. Through a competition experiment between MT and its individual domain peptides, MT was proposed to bind Zn 2 + using terminal cysteines initially (into five strong binding sites) before formation of the clusters with binding of the sixth and seventh Zn 2 + (into two weaker binding sites). The terminally bound Zn 5 -MT intermediate is thought to be key to metal acquisition (from zinc-chaperones) and donation (to zinc-dependent <b>apo-enzymes)</b> in maintaining intracellular zinc homeostasis...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{evidence for}} the extremely high resistance of a complex of crayfish trypsin (CFT) and bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) against heating and chemical denaturing agents such as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and urea. To dissociate this complex 15 minute boiling in SDS was necessary as compared to a complex of bovine trypsin and BPTI that dissociates in SDS without boiling. The CFT-BPTI complex remained stable even in 9 M urea, while the bovine trypsin-BPTI complex started to dissociate at about 4 M urea. The melting temperature of the bovine trypsin-BPTI and CFT-BPTI complexes, as determined by differential scanning calorimetry, {{were found to be}} 79. 6 and 100. 1 oC, respectively. The behaviour of the <b>apo-enzymes</b> did not provide a definite clue to the differential effects of BPTI on their stabilities, although CFT was found to have a less stable structure as compared to that of bovine trypsin and in the X-ray structure of the CFT-BPTI complex we identified a few extra binding sites for BPTI.

40|$|The binding of the Escherichia coli biotin {{holoenzyme}} synthetase {{to the two}} ligands, biotin and bio- 5 `-AMP, is {{coupled to}} disorder-to-order transitions in the protein. In {{the structure of the}} biotin complex, a "glycine-rich" loop that is disordered in the <b>apo-enzyme</b> is folded over the ligand. Mutations in three residues in this loop result in significant changes in the affinity of the enzyme for both biotin and bio- 5 `-AMP. The kinetic basis of these losses in the affinity resides primarily in changes in the unimolecular rates of dissociation of the complexes. In this work, isothermal titration calorimetry has been employed to examine the detailed thermodynamics of binding of three loop mutants to biotin and bio- 5 `-AMP. The energetic features of dissociation of the protein•ligand complexes also have been probed by measuring the temperature dependencies of the unimolecular dissociation rates. Analysis of the data using the Eyring formalism yielded entropic and enthalpic contributions to the energetic barrier to dissociation. The thermodynamic results coupled with the known structures of the <b>apo-enzyme</b> and biotin complex have been used to formulate a model for progression from the ground-state complex to the transition state in biotin dissociation.

A major {{question is whether the}} flexibility observed in enzymes is simply an inherent property of proteins that must always be borne in mind or is essential for catalysis or substrate binding. The temperature factors or B-values, as determined crystallographically, are linearly related to the mean square displacement of an atom and give an indication of atomic flexibility in the crystalline state. In this paper, we describe the frequency distributions of the normalized B-factor (B 2 ̆ 7 -factor) for the active site and non-active site residues in the selected 69 <b>apo-enzymes.</b> This analysis was performed over the entire sequences and for different structural subsets defined by the three-dimensional structure of proteins, as alpha-helices, beta-structures and coil conformation and buried and non-buried residues. The results show that in all cases, the active site residues predominantly occur in region of low B 2 ̆ 7 -factor and the non-active site residues have a tendency to exist in the high B 2 ̆ 7 -factor region. This observation suggests that the active site residues, in general, are less flexible than the non-active site residues and therefore the vibrational and the fast collective motions of the C-alpha atoms of proteins appear not to have clear biological significance...|$|R

The present study describes biotransformation of RDX via route 3 by a diaphorase (EC 1. 8. 1. 4) from Clostridium kluyveri using NADH as electron donor. The removal of RDX was accompanied by the formation and accumulation of nitrite ion (NO(2) (-)), formaldehyde (HCHO), ammonium (NH(4) (+)), and nitrous oxide (N(2) O). None of the RDX-nitroso products were detected. The ring cleavage product methylenedinitramine was detected as the transient intermediate. Product stoichiometry showed that each reacted RDX molecule produced one nitrite ion and the product distribution gave a carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) mass balance of 91 and 92 %, respectively, supporting the occurrence of a mono-denitration step prior to the ring cleavage and decomposition. Severe oxygen mediated inhibition (92 % inhibition) of RDX biotransformation and superoxide dismutase-sensitive cytochrome c reduction indicated the potential involvement of an anion radical RDX(. -) prior to denitration. A comparative study between native- and <b>apo-enzymes</b> showed the possible involvement of flavin mononucleotide (FMN) in catalyzing the transfer of a redox equivalent (e/H(+)) from NADH to RDX to produce RDX(. -) responsible for secondary decomposition.

To verify {{the consequences of this}} heterology on their specific activities, we compared the activity and structure recoveries of the metal-free forms (apo) of EAP and of BIAP. In the present study, we found that although the sensitivities of EAP and BIAP to ions remained similar, significant differences in dimeric structure stability of <b>apo-enzymes</b> were observed between EAP and BIAP, {{as well as in the}} kinetics of their activity and secondary structure recoveries. After mild chelation inactive apo-EAP was monomeric under mild denaturing conditions, whereas inactive apo-BIAP remained dimeric, indicating that the monomer–monomer contact was stronger in the mammalian enzyme. Dimeric apo-EAP (0. 45  μM, corresponding to 4  units/ml) recovered approx.   80 % of its initial activity after 3  min incubation in an optimal recovery medium containing 5  μM Zn 2 + and 5  mM Mg 2 +, whereas dimeric apo-BIAP (0. 016  μM, corresponding to 4  units/ml) recovered 80 % of its native activity after 6  h incubation in an optimal recovery medium containing 0. 5  μM Zn 2 + and 5  mM Mg 2 +.

The inhibitors, xylobiosyl-deoxynojirimycin, xylobiosyl-isofagomine lactam, and xylobiosyl-isofagomine consist of a common distal xylose linked to different proximal aza-sugars. The three mutant forms of the enzyme contain the substitutions Asn 44 Ala, Gln 87 Met, and Gln 87 Tyr that alter the binding interactions between Cex and the distal sugar of each inhibitor. An electrospray ionization (ESI) triple quadrupole MS/MS system is used to measure the internal energies, ΔEint, that must be added to gas-phase ions to cause dissociation of the noncovalent enzyme-inhibitor complexes. Collision cross sections of ions of the <b>apo-enzyme</b> and enzyme-inhibitor complexes, which are required for the calculations of ΔEint, have also been measured. The results show that, in the gas phase, enzyme-inhibitor complexes have more compact, folded conformations than the corresponding <b>apo-enzyme</b> ions. With the mutant enzymes, the effects of substituting a single residue can be detected. The energies required to dissociate the gas-phase complexes follow the same trend as the values of ΔG 0 for dissociation of the complexes in solution. This trend is observed both with different inhibitors, which probe binding to the proximal sugar, and with mutants of Cex, which probe binding to the distal sugar.

Several bacteria toxins, including colicin E 7 (ColE 7), also contain the 30 amino acid HNH motif in their nuclease domains. In this work, we found that the nuclease domain of ColE 7 (nuclease-ColE 7) purified from Escherichia coli contains a one-to-one stoichiometry of zinc ion and that this zinc-containing enzyme hydrolyzes DNA without externally added divalent metal ions. The <b>apo-enzyme,</b> in which the indigenous zinc ion was removed from nuclease-ColE 7, had no DNase activity. Several divalent metal ions, including Ni 2 +, Mg 2 +, Co 2 +, Mn 2 +, Ca 2 +, Sr 2 +, Cu 2 + and Zn 2 +, re-activated the DNase activity of the <b>apo-enzyme</b> to various degrees, however higher concentrations of zinc ion inhibited this DNase activity. Two charged residues located at positions close to the zinc-binding site were mutated to alanine. The single-site mutants, R 538 A and E 542 A, showed reduced DNase activity, whereas the double-point mutant, R 538 A + E 542 A, had no observable DNase activity. A gel retardation assay further demonstrated that the nuclease-ColE 7 hydrolyzed DNA in the presence of zinc ions, but only bound to DNA in the absence of zinc ions. These results demonstrate that the zinc ion in the HNH motif of nuclease-ColE 7 is not required for DNA binding, but is essential for DNA hydrolysis, suggesting that the zinc ion not only stabilizes the folding of the enzyme, but is also likely to be involved in DNA hydrolysis...|$|E

Our {{results indicate that the}} apo-forms of these colicins are at room temperature and neutral pH in a dynamic conformational equilibrium between at least two quite distinct conformers. We show that the thermal stabilities of the apo-proteins differ by up to 20 °C. The observed differences correlate with the observed conformational behavior, that is, the tendency of the protein to form either an open, less stable or closed, more stable conformation in solution, as deduced by both tryptophan accessibility studies and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Given these surprising structural differences, we next probed the catalytic activity of the four DNases and also observed a significant variation in relative activities. However, no unequivocal link between the activity of the protein and its thermal and structural stability could easily be made. The observed differences in conformational and functional properties of the four colicin DNases are surprising given that they are a closely related (≥ 65 % identity) family of enzymes containing a highly conserved (ββα-Me) active site motif.

Which species is formed is controlled by the pH because some of the protein ligands used for metal-ion binding must lose a proton to form the metallo-enzyme from the <b>apo-enzyme.</b> The protonation states of the ligands that are used to bind various metal-ions in BcII have been determined using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) at different pH's maintained by different buffers. If a single equilibrium is established, by positive cooperative binding, between two metal-ions and the enzyme to form the bi-nuclear enzyme it requires the solution of a cubic equation to model the ITC data. At pH 5. 2 and 5. 6 the dominant species for all three metals is the mono-nuclear MBL, but only with the native mono-nuclear ZnBcII is the metal-bound water ionised. Compared with ZnBcII, fewer protons are released upon formation of mono-nuclear CoBcII and CdBcII which probably involves metal ion binding to the DCH site. For all three metal-ions, the number of metal-ions binding per molecule of enzyme increases from one to two as the pH is increased from pH 5. 20 to 7. 20. Only cadmium shows distinct sequential binding in the ITC outputs and the two cadmium ions bind independently and non-cooperatively, showing very distinct and different binding parameters. The apparent single ITC titration curves when two zinc- or cobalt-ions are bound to the β-lactamase are, in fact, not indicative of strong cooperative binding, but are best modelled by two sequential binding steps. The binuclear Cd 2 BcII is formed with the release of only two protons from the <b>apo-enzyme</b> and, at pH 7. 2, probably has an unionised water bridging the two metal-ions, whereas in Zn 2 BcII and Co 2 BcII it is a bridged hydroxide-ion, giving rise to the release of three protons on formation of the binuclear enzyme...|$|E
40|$|Proteins {{utilizing}} pyridoxal 5 ′-phosphate as a coenzyme {{constitute a}} large superfamily and are currently classified into three functional groups and five structural fold types. Despite {{the variability of}} sequences and catalyzed reactions, they share relevant structural, dynamic and functional properties. Therefore, they constitute an optimal system to investigate the relative influence of primary sequence and coenzyme interactions on folding pathways, structural stability and enzymatic function. O-Acetylserine sulfhydrylase is a dimeric pyridoxal 5 ′-phosphate dependent enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of L-cysteine from O-acetylserine and sulfide. The time-resolved fluorescence study of O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase unfolding, here reported, indicates that the coenzyme stabilizes the protein structure. The dependence on denaturant concentration of tryptophan lifetimes in the holo- and <b>apo-enzyme</b> demonstrates that the interactions with the coenzyme stabilize the C-terminal domain to a higher extent {{with respect to the}} N-terminal domain. This result is discussed in terms of a linkage between the differential stabilization brought about by the coenzyme and the different degrees of conformational flexibility required by the specialized functional role of distinct protein regions. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|International audiencePrevious {{studies suggest}} that the {{addition}} of pyridoxal 5 '-phosphate to apo-serine hydroxymethyltransferase from Escherichia coli is the last event in the enzyme‘s folding process. We propose a mechanism for this reaction based on quenched-flow, stopped-flow and rapid scanning stopped-flow experiments. All experiments were performed with an excess of <b>apo-enzyme</b> over cofactor, since excess pyridoxal phosphate results in a second molecule of cofactor binding to Lys 346, {{which is part of the}} tetrahydropteroylglutamate binding site. The equilibrium between the aldehyde and hydrate forms of the cofactor affects the kinetics of addition to the active site. Direct evidence of the formation of an intermediate aldimine between the cofactor and the active site lysine was obtained. The results have been interpreted according to a three-step mechanism in which: 1) both aldehyde and hydrate forms of the cofactor bind rapidly and non-covalently to the apo-enzyme; 2) only the aldehyde form reacts with the active site lysine to give an intermediate internal aldimine with unusual spectral properties; 3) a final conformational change gives the native holo-enzyme...|$|E

Catalysis involves {{the formation of}} a Schiff's base intermediate formed at the epsilon-amino group of Lys 229. The existing <b>apo-enzyme</b> structure was refined using the crystallographic free-R-factor and maximum likelihood methods that have been shown to give improved structural results that are less subject to model bias. Crystals were also soaked with the natural substrate (fructose 1, 6 -bisphosphate), and the crystal structure of this complex has been determined to 2. 8 A. The apo structure differs from the previous Brookhaven-deposited structure (1 ald) in the flexible C-terminal region. This is also the region where the native and complex structures exhibit differences. The conformational changes between native and complex structure are not large, but the observed complex does not involve the full formation of the Schiff's base intermediate, and suggests a preliminary hydrogen-bonded Michaelis complex before the formation of the covalent complex...|$|E
30|$|Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) {{measurements}} {{were carried out}} on a MicroCal OMEGA ultrasensitive titration calorimeter at 25 ± 0.2 °C. The divalent metal ion titrants and <b>apo-enzyme</b> solutions were prepared in 25 mM Chelex- 100 treated HEPES buffer at pH 7.5. Stock buffer solutions were thoroughly degassed before each titration. The enzyme solution (70 μM) {{was placed in the}} calorimeter cell and stirred at 200 rpm to ensure rapid mixing. Typically, 4 – 6 μL of titrant was delivered over 7.6 s with 6 min. intervals between injections to allow for complete equilibration. Each titration was continued until 4.5 - 6 equiv. of M(II) had been added to ensure that no additional complexes were formed in excess titrant. A background titration, consisting of the identical titrant solution but only the buffer solution in the sample cell, was subtracted from each experimental titration to account for heat of dilution. Individual AAP solutions were prepared by diluting stock enzyme solutions with 50 mM Chelexed HEPES buffer (pH 7. 5), and ArgE solutions were prepared by diluting stock enzyme solutions with 25 mM Chelexed HEPES buffer (pH 7.6) containing 150 mM KCl.|$|E
40|$|An inactive, Ni-deficient form {{of carbon}} {{monoxide}} (CO) dehydrogenase [carbon-monoxide:(acceptor) oxidoreductase; EC 1. 2. 99. 2], designated apo-CO dehydrogenase, accumulated in Rhodospirillum rubrum when cells were grown {{in the absence of}} Ni and treated with CO. In vivo, both CO dehydrogenase activity and hydrogenase activity increased several hundred fold upon addition of 2 microM NiCl 2. Apo-CO dehydrogenase was purified to homogeneity and differed from holo-CO dehydrogenase only in its activity and Ni content, containing less than 0. 2 mol of Ni per mol of protein, and a specific activity of 35 mumol of CO per min per mg. Optimal in vitro activation of purified apo-CO dehydrogenase resulted in an enzyme with a specific activity of 2640 mumol of CO per min per mg. No additional enzymes or low molecular weight cofactors were required for activation. Apo-CO dehydrogenase was not activated by MgCl 2, MnCl 2, CuCl 2, ZnCl 2, CoCl 2, or Na 2 MoO 4. 63 Ni was incorporated into apo-CO dehydrogenase during activation. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of dithionite-reduced apo- and holo-enzyme were identical, indicating that, in the reduced state, the Fe-S centers observed by EPR are unchanged in the <b>apo-enzyme...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{protozoan}} parasite Cryptosporidium parvum causes {{waterborne diseases}} worldwide. There is no effective therapy for C. parvum infection. The parasite depends mainly on glycolysis for energy production. Lactate dehydrogenase {{is a major}} regulator of glycolysis. This paper describes the biochemical characterization of C. parvum lactate dehydrogenase and high resolution crystal structures of the <b>apo-enzyme</b> and four ternary complexes. The ternary complexes capture the enzyme bound to NAD/NADH or its 3 -acetylpyridine analog in the cofactor binding pocket, while the substrate binding site is occupied {{by one of the}} following ligands: lactate, pyruvate or oxamate. The results reveal distinctive features of the parasitic enzyme. For example, C. parvum lactate dehydrogenase prefers the acetylpyridine analog of NADH as a cofactor. Moreover, it is slightly less sensitive to gossypol inhibition compared with mammalian lactate dehydrogenases and not inhibited by excess pyruvate. The active site loop and the antigenic loop in C. parvum lactate dehydrogenase are considerably different from those in the human counterpart. Structural features and enzymatic properties of C. parvum lactate dehydrogenase are similar to enzymes from related parasites. Structural comparison with malate dehydrogenase supports a common ancestry for the two genes. 1...|$|E
40|$|The crystal {{structure}} of aspartyl-tRNA synthetase (AspRS) from Pyrococcus kodakaraensis was solved at 1. 9 A resolution. The sequence and three-dimensional {{structure of the}} catalytic domain are highly homologous to those of eukaryotic AspRSs. In contrast, the N-terminal domain, whose function is to bind the tRNA anticodon, is more {{similar to that of}} eubacterial enzymes. Its structure explains the unique property of archaeal AspRSs of accommodating both tRNAAsp and tRNAAsn. Soaking the <b>apo-enzyme</b> crystals with ATP and aspartic acid both separately and together allows the adenylate formation to be followed. Due to the asymmetry of the dimeric enzyme in the crystalline state, different steps of the reaction could be visualized within the same crystal. Four different states of the aspartic acid activation reaction could thus be characterized, revealing the functional correlation of the observed conformational changes. The binding of the amino acid substrate induces movement of two invariant loops which secure the position of the peptidyl moiety for adenylate formation. An unambiguous spatial and functional assignment of three magnesium ion cofactors can be made. This study shows the important role of residues present in both archaeal and eukaryotic AspRSs, but absent from the eubacterial enzymes...|$|E
