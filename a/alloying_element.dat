5|$|Titanium is used {{in steel}} as an <b>alloying</b> <b>element</b> (ferro-titanium) to reduce grain size and as a deoxidizer, and in {{stainless}} steel to reduce carbon content. Titanium is often alloyed with aluminium (to refine grain size), vanadium, copper (to harden), iron, manganese, molybdenum, and other metals. Titanium mill products (sheet, plate, bar, wire, forgings, castings) find application in industrial, aerospace, recreational, and emerging markets.

30|$|In 2005, 636, 635, 250 and 29  kt of manganese, chromium, nickel, and {{molybdenum}} were imported, respectively, in {{the form}} of virgin sources. These were mainly consumed in steelmaking to produce steel mill products from crude steel by employing <b>alloying</b> <b>elements.</b> Accompanying steel mill products, <b>alloying</b> <b>elements</b> are widely distributed through the international supply chain. Indeed, in addition to the imported <b>alloying</b> <b>elements,</b> <b>alloying</b> <b>elements</b> contained in domestically generated steel scrap are utilized in steelmaking. Consequently, the actual flow of <b>alloying</b> <b>elements</b> is greater than that in the imported masses. Given the above, this study discusses the balance of <b>alloying</b> <b>elements</b> in the flow based on the imported masses. The masses of <b>alloying</b> <b>elements</b> remaining in Japan were calculated by subtracting the total exported masses of <b>alloying</b> <b>elements</b> in Japan from the imported masses instead of subtracting the total exported masses from the total consumed masses.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{effects of}} <b>alloying</b> <b>elements</b> and {{impurities}} on the microstructure and properties of {{metals and alloys}} are important. Understanding of these effects may help to control and produce products with desired properties at lower cost. In the present work the effects of Al, Si and Mn on the recrystallization behavior, hardness and microstructural changes of an Fe- containing brass during annealing were studied. The results show that <b>alloying</b> <b>elements</b> strongly affect recrystallization kinetics and resulted finer microstructures. Hardness variations during annealing are consistent with microstructural observations {{and the presence of}} <b>alloying</b> <b>elements.</b> All elements slow down recrystallization progress and increase resulted hardness values. The resulted microstructures in the presence of <b>alloying</b> <b>elements</b> are much finer than that of plain 70 B brass. It was concluded that the present <b>alloying</b> <b>elements</b> affect the recrystallization behavior of 70 B brass in a similar manner. Their mechanism of interactions is solute drag effect and their effects sum up when they present together. ...|$|R
5|$|To {{identify}} different electrodes, the American Welding Society {{established a}} system that assigns electrodes with a four- or five-digit number. Covered electrodes made of mild or low alloy steel carry the prefix E, followed by their number. The first two or three digits of the number specify the tensile strength of the weld metal, in thousand {{pounds per square inch}} (ksi). The penultimate digit generally identifies the welding positions permissible with the electrode, typically using the values 1 (normally fast-freeze electrodes, implying all position welding) and 2 (normally fast-fill electrodes, implying horizontal welding only). The welding current and type of electrode covering are specified by the last two digits together. When applicable, a suffix is used to denote the <b>alloying</b> <b>element</b> being contributed by the electrode.|$|E
5|$|Beryllium {{improves}} many {{physical properties}} when added as an <b>alloying</b> <b>element</b> to aluminium, copper (notably the alloy beryllium copper), iron and nickel. Beryllium does not form oxides {{until it reaches}} very high temperatures. Tools made of beryllium copper alloys are strong and hard and do not create sparks when they strike a steel surface. In structural applications, the combination of high flexural rigidity, thermal stability, thermal conductivity and low density (1.85 times that of water) make beryllium metal a desirable aerospace material for aircraft components, missiles, spacecraft, and satellites. Because of its low density and atomic mass, beryllium is relatively transparent to X-rays {{and other forms of}} ionizing radiation; therefore, it is the most common window material for X-ray equipment and components of particle detectors. The high thermal conductivities of beryllium and beryllium oxide have led to their use in thermal management applications.|$|E
5|$|Copper {{is used in}} roofing, currency, and for {{photographic}} technology {{known as}} the daguerreotype. Copper was used in Renaissance sculpture, and was used to construct the Statue of Liberty; copper continues {{to be used in}} construction of various types. Copper plating and copper sheathing were widely used to protect the under-water hulls of ships, a technique pioneered by the British Admiralty in the 18th century. The Norddeutsche Affinerie in Hamburg was the first modern electroplating plant, starting its production in 1876. The German scientist Gottfried Osann invented powder metallurgy in 1830 while determining the metal's atomic mass; around then it was discovered that the amount and type of <b>alloying</b> <b>element</b> (e.g., tin) to copper would affect bell tones. Flash smelting was developed by Outokumpu in Finland and first applied at Harjavalta in 1949; the energy-efficient process accounts for 50% of the world's primary copper production.|$|E

Design/methodology/approach: Multi-layer feedforward neural networks with learning rule based on the error backpropagation algorithm were employed for modelling the steels properties. Then the neural networks worked out were employed for the computer simulation {{of the effect of}} particular <b>alloying</b> <b>elements</b> on the steels’ properties. Findings: Obtained results show that neural network are useful in evaluation of synergic effect of <b>alloying</b> <b>elements</b> on selected materials properties when classical investigations’ results do not provide evaluation of the effect of two or more <b>alloying</b> <b>elements.</b> Practical implications: Numerical simulation presented in the work, based on using the adequate material models may feature an alternative for classical investigations on effect of <b>alloying</b> <b>elements</b> on steels’ properties.

25|$|Ferrouranium {{is used as}} {{a deoxidizer}} (more {{powerful}} than ferrovanadium), for denitrogenizing steel, for forming carbides, and as an <b>alloying</b> <b>element.</b> In ferrous alloys, uranium increases the elastic limit and the tensile strength. In high speed steels, it has been used to increase toughness and strength in amounts between 0.05–5%. Uranium-alloyed steels can be used at very low temperatures; nickel-uranium alloys are resistant to even very aggressive chemicals, including aqua regia.|$|E
25|$|Hydrogen {{and other}} {{elements}} within iron act as softening agents that promote the movement of dislocations that naturally exist in the iron atom crystal lattices. Varying the amount of alloying elements—their formation in the iron hydride either as solute elements, or as precipitated phases—enables the movement of those dislocations that make iron so ductile and weak, and thus controls qualities such as the hardness, ductility, and tensile strength of the resulting iron hydride. Iron hydride's ductility compared to pure iron is only possible {{at the expense of}} strength, of which elemental iron has a relative deficiency. However, iron hydride is metastable and subject to the rapid formation of a precipitated phase of gaseous dihydrogen, a process known as hydrogen embrittlement. Thus, the material properties of iron hydride are time-sensitive. One <b>alloying</b> <b>element</b> intentionally added to modify the characteristics of iron hydride is titanium.|$|E
30|$|In this study, the {{flows of}} steel <b>alloying</b> <b>elements</b> in Japan and exports of Japanese {{products}} {{were obtained by}} means of the WIO-MFA model and by taking data from the trade statistics. Although the content of tiny metals such as <b>alloying</b> <b>elements</b> in highly fabricated products tends to be aggregated and/or ignored, this study covers the detailed content and flow of four <b>alloying</b> <b>elements</b> in order to consider the environmental impacts of the use of each metal separately and thus provide more precise implications. Based on the flow, the responsibility for GHG emissions during metal mining and production was estimated and its distribution among countries and regions in the supply chain calculated. Focusing on four <b>alloying</b> <b>elements</b> in the Japan-oriented supply chain allowed us to describe the role the country plays in the supply chain.|$|R
40|$|A multi-dimensional {{random number}} {{generation}} algorithm {{was used to}} distribute chemical concentrations {{of each of the}} <b>alloying</b> <b>elements</b> in the candidate alloys as uniformly as possible while maintaining the prescribed bounds on the minimum and maximum allowable values for the concentration of each of the <b>alloying</b> <b>elements.</b> The generated candidate alloy compositions were then examined for phase equilibria and associated magnetic properties using a thermodynamic database in the desired temperature range. These initial candidate alloys were manufactured, synthesized and tested for desired properties. Then, the experimentally obtained values of the properties were fitted with a multi-dimensional response surface. The desired properties were treated as objectives and were extremized simultaneously by utilizing a multi-objective optimization algorithm that optimized the concentrations of each of the <b>alloying</b> <b>elements.</b> This task was also performed by another conceptually different response surface and optimization algorithm for double-checking the results. A few of the best predicted Pareto optimal alloy compositions were then manufactured, synthesized and tested to evaluate their macroscopic properties. Several of these Pareto optimized alloys outperformed most of the candidate alloys on most of the objectives. This proves the efficacy of the combined meta-modeling and experimental approach in design optimization of the alloys. A sensitivity analysis of each of the <b>alloying</b> <b>elements</b> was also performed to determine which of the <b>alloying</b> <b>elements</b> contributes the least to the desired macroscopic properties of the <b>alloy.</b> These <b>elements</b> can then be replaced with other candidate <b>alloying</b> <b>elements</b> such as not-so-rare earth elements...|$|R
30|$|In total, 98  kt (manganese), 25  kt (chromium), 150  kt (nickel), and 4  kt (molybdenum) were {{exported}} as products excluding {{raw materials}} and steel mill products.

This fact suggests that <b>alloying</b> <b>elements</b> are spread globally {{in the form of the}} products made in Japan. At the country level, the USA occupied the largest proportion of accompanying exports, approximately twice as large as those of other countries for all <b>alloying</b> <b>elements.</b> Panama followed the USA for accompanying exports of manganese with products just because of its trade in steel ships.

2500|$|The liquid outer core {{also appears}} to have density 5–10% lower than iron. Shibazaki and others {{estimate}} {{that it should have}} a somewhat higher proportion of hydrogen than the inner core, but there is not enough data about molten FeHx for accurate estimates. [...] Narygina and others estimate 0.5–1.0% (weight) of hydrogen in the melt. Similar, but without extrapolations in pressure, theoretical estimates give a narrower range of concentrations 0.4-0.5% (weight), however, this results to too low mean atomic mass of the inner core (43.8-46.5) and hydrogen seems to be less likely than other elements (S, Si, C, O) to be the main light <b>alloying</b> <b>element</b> in the core.|$|E
2500|$|This term {{is often}} used {{in the field of}} {{metallurgy}} to refer to the extent that an <b>alloying</b> <b>element</b> will dissolve into the base metal without forming a separate phase. The solvus or solubility line (or curve) is the line (or lines) on a phase diagram that give the limits of solute addition. That is, the lines show the maximum amount of a component that can be added to another component and still be in solid solution. [...] In the solid's crystalline structure, the 'solute' element can either take the place of the matrix within the lattice (a substitutional position; for example, chromium in iron) or take a place in a space between the lattice points (an interstitial position; for example, carbon in iron).|$|E
5000|$|In solid {{solution}} strengthening, a soluble <b>alloying</b> <b>element</b> {{is added to}} the material desired to be strengthened, and together they form a “{{solid solution}}”. A solid solution can be thought of just as a [...] "normal" [...] liquid solution, e.g. salt in water, except it is solid. Depending {{on the size of the}} dissolved alloying element's ion compared to that of the matrix-metal, it is dissolved either substitutionally (large <b>alloying</b> <b>element</b> substituting for an atom in the crystal) or interstitially (small <b>alloying</b> <b>element</b> taking a place between atoms in the crystal lattice). In both cases, the size difference of the foreign elements make them act as sand grains in sandpaper, resisting dislocations that try to slip by, resulting in higher material strength. In solution hardening, the <b>alloying</b> <b>element</b> does not precipitate from solution.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the aspects}} of modern {{material}} systems for high strength sintered steel parts {{is the presence of}} <b>alloy</b> <b>elements</b> with widely different oxygen affinity. Compared to the base iron, the “new” <b>alloy</b> <b>elements</b> Cr, Mn and Si form oxides with much higher stability. It is shown here that in case of powder mixes this leads to oxygen transfer from the base iron particles to the <b>alloy</b> <b>elements</b> during heating up to sintering temperature, i. e. metallothermic reduction of the iron surfaces. With prealloyed powders, the surface oxides, which are originally mostly iron oxide, are transformed into <b>alloy</b> <b>element</b> oxides during heating unless the iron oxides can be reduced at low temperature with H 2. In any case, the heterogeneity of the oxygen affinity is a parameter that has to be considered when defining alloy systems for sintered steels...|$|R

50|$|Solid {{solution}} strengthening {{is a type}} of alloying {{that can}} be used to improve the strength of a pure metal. The technique works by adding atoms of one element (the <b>alloying</b> <b>element)</b> to the crystalline lattice of another element (the base metal), forming a solid solution. The local nonuniformity in the lattice due to the <b>alloying</b> <b>element</b> makes plastic deformation more difficult by impeding dislocation motion. In contrast, alloying beyond the solubility limit can form a second phase, leading to strengthening via other mechanisms (e.g. the precipitation of intermetallic compounds).|$|E

The partitioning of Mo, V and Al are strongly affected by their diffusivities and their mutual interaction.
