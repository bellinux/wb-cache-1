40|$|This {{third and}} final article in the series {{discusses}} in more detail BEPS Actions 7 and 15, which have particular relevance to the digital economy. It examines the steps that New Zealand and other OECD jurisdictions are taking to implement these particular recommendations dealing, respectively, with artificial avoidance of permanent establishment (PE) status {{and the development of}} a multilateral instrument to modify bilateral tax treaties. The article also tries to place Actions 7 and 15 within the context of a recent and intensifying global discussion on the ability of taxing jurisdictions to address perceived revenue leakage from large corporations that have benefited from, or are leading players in, the rise of the Internet. The simplified issue of the amount of tax that some corporations actually pay has obscured to some extent the specific work being undertaken by the OECD and its member jurisdictions to implement, individually and collectively, BEPS measures addressing the tax challenges of the digital economy. The most recent and significant example of this action—in relation to large players in the digital world—occurred in August 2016 when the European Commission (EC) announced its finding that Ireland had granted illegal (under EU rules) tax benefits of up to [euro] 13 billion to Apple, such that Apple paid an effective corporate tax rate of between 0. 005 percent and 1. 0 percent on its European profits between 2003 and 2014.

40|$|The 'right' {{choice of}} {{instruments}} and modalities {{to provide aid}} to developing countries in support of poverty reduction and economic development {{is arguably the most}} contested issue in the current international debate on aid effectiveness. A particular controversy exists around the provision of aid in the form of budget support to avoid high transaction costs and other shortcomings of traditional project-based aid. Critics argue that this kind of 'programme aid' involves unacceptably high fiduciary risks due to the fungibility of budgetary funds. A more recently proposed form of aid {{is in the form of}} results-based aid or aid on delivery. Proponents argue that this provides donors with better control over the use of aid resources. This paper demonstrates in a simple principal-agent framework with asymmetric information that in the absence of transaction costs, for a wide range of combinations of aid dependency and recipient government commitment to reduce poverty, all three forms of <b>aid</b> are <b>equivalent</b> with regard to fungibility and fiduciary risks. The paper proceeds to demonstrate that as long as donors can rely on the recipient government to be at least minimally committed to poverty reduction, a well co-ordinated modality mix of general budget support and aid on delivery does not bear higher fiduciary risks than project aid. It concludes that if project aid does indeed involve higher transaction costs than budget support, donors should provide aid in the form of such a modality mix, albeit only if they are able (and willing) to closely co-ordinate their support...|$|R

The simulation experiments have shown that food aid has unambiguous disincentive effects on domestic food production. The removal of food aid caused a modest increase in food prices but this stimulated food production. Employment and income generation effects of the latter outweighed the adverse effect of the former. Consequently, the removal of food aid led to improvements in aggregate household welfare. Contrary to some concerns in the food aid literature that any reduction in food aid would hurt the poor, the simulation experiments suggested that actually poor rural household and urban wage earners {{are the ones who}} benefit most in absence of food aid but entrepreneurs are more likely to encounter a marginal welfare decline.

The numerical solution following an explicit time integration scheme is used to yield an excellent reproduction of the mechanical behavior of the specimen thereby confirming the accuracy of the numerical approach.

With the <b>aid</b> of the <b>equivalent</b> circuit corre-sponding to a conventional parallel-coupled filter, the relative insertion phase from source or load to each open end of resonators can be easily obtained by observing the two-port admittance ma-trix. Applying the cross coupling from source or load to a proper nonadjacent resonator, a trisection or a quadruplet coupling scheme can be realized with prescribed transmission zeros. More importantly, the proposed trisection can be designed to have a transmission zero on the lower or upper stopband by just ad-justing {{the length of the}} cross-coupling strip. Using the proposed structure, the conventional time-consuming adjusting procedure to obtain initial physical dimensions of filters is no longer required.

40|$|In {{electrochemistry}} the {{alternating current}} (AC) methods enlarge {{the possibilities of}} electrochemical analysis {{especially in the case}} of barrier layers such as coatings on metal surfaces. However, the frequency dependent resistance (impedance) expressed by amplitude and phase angle (Phi) is a very complex parameter referring to a combination of different resistance elements. Therefore the interpretation of EIS-spectra must be <b>aided</b> by using <b>equivalent</b> circuit models fitting the experimental results. At ILV, an equivalent circuit model has been developed, which enables excellent phase sensitive simulation (PSS) of impedance spectra to obtain full information about the coating properties. The model is consistent throughout time-dependent degradationsof coatings and is used preferrentially to assess protective properties by short time testing. Due to the high sensitivity of impedance measurements the individual sample performance, depending on coating porosity or failures, renders more di fficult the evaluation of general coating characteristics. Short time testing of a sufficient number of parallel samples will give more valid results. A rapid test procedure including intermediate cathodic treatment by direct current (DC) has been introduced.

However, it has not been clear how best to put incentives into practice, and how the implementation of shared decision making and the use of patient decision aids would be measured. Our goal was to review developments and proposals put forward. METHODS: We performed a qualitative document analysis following a pragmatic search of Medline, Google, Google Scholar, Business Source Complete (Ebscohost), and LexisNexis from 2009 - 2013 using the following key words: "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act", "Decision Making", "Affordable Care Act", "Shared Decision Making", "measurement", "incentives", and "payment.

Many documents clearly imply that providing and disseminating patient decision <b>aids</b> might be <b>equivalent</b> to shared decision making.
