Many of the most prominent figures in Yiddish theater, including Sigmund Mogulesko, David Kessler, Abba and Clara Shoengold, and Sara Heine (the future Sara Adler), gave guest performances when they passed through London.|$|E

Ford later told confidantes that his father had first hit his mother on their honeymoon for smiling at another man.|$|E

5|$|Harris {{was born}} into a middle-class African-American family on January 17, 1899, in Richmond, Virginia. His father was <b>a</b> <b>butcher</b> at a German American owned meat shop, and his mother was a schoolteacher. As a result of his {{frequent}} contact with the meat shop's owner, Harris learned German and became a fluent speaker of the language. Harris' mastery of the language would help him later in life, when he examined the writings of German economists and social reformers like Karl Marx.|$|E
5|$|Løvold started wrestling {{during his}} {{journeyman}} years {{while living in}} Oslo. He joined IF Ørnulf and became Norwegian Champion in Greco-Roman wrestling in 1912. This qualified him to the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm, but Løvold lost both his matches in the light heavyweight event. He moved back to Kristiansund in 1913, where he founded a wrestling club and started as an instructor. He also founded wrestling clubs in Molde and Trondheim. As <b>a</b> <b>butcher,</b> he ran several butcher shops in town. From 1951, Løvold dedicated his time to working towards a fixed link for Kristiansund.|$|E

5|$|The farm {{utilized}} {{the concept of}} a European country seat, through tenant farming, established blacksmith, wheelwright, and harness shops on-site, in addition to <b>a</b> <b>butcher</b> shop and smokehouse. Buildings were centrally located around Walter Law's manor house, many of which were constructed in the Tudor Revival style. The farm's office building, Dysart House, the Briarcliff Lodge, and the railroad station shared that architectural style.|$|E

Schooled in Wandsworth, Charles worked in Battersea Town Council {{from the age of}} fourteen, before joining the London Regiment upon the {{outbreak}} of World WarI in August 1914. Attached to a bicycle company in the 24th Battalion of the 47th Division, he arrived at the Western Front in March 1915.

5|$|Henry's {{succession}} {{plans were}} thrown into chaos by {{the sinking of}} the White Ship on 25 November 1120. Henry had left the port of Barfleur for England in the early evening, leaving William Adelin and many of the younger members of the court to follow on that night in a separate vessel, the White Ship. Both the crew and passengers were drunk and, just outside the harbour, the ship hit a submerged rock. The ship sank, killing as many as 300 people, with only one survivor, <b>a</b> <b>butcher</b> from Rouen. Henry's court was initially too scared to report William's death to the King. When he was finally told, he collapsed with grief.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to officials, teachers, merchants, farmers, artisans, and retainers, {{there were many}} other occupations. The pig-breeder was not seen as a lowly profession if it was merely utilized by a poor scholar {{to pay for a}} formal education. For example, the first chancellor in Han to lack either a military background or a title as marquess was the pig-breeder Gongsun Hong (公孫弘) of Emperor Wu's reign. Physicians who practiced medicine and studied medical classics could not only make a decent income, but were also able to gain an education and become officials. The physician Hua Tuo (d. 208 CE) was nominated for office while another became Prefect of the Gentlemen of the Palace (郎中令). Those who practiced occult arts of Chinese alchemy and mediumship were often employed by the government to conduct religious sacrifices, while on rare occasions—such as with Luan Da (d. 112 BCE)—an occultist might marry a princesses or be enfeoffed as a marquess. While it was socially acceptable for gentry scholars to engage in the occult arts of divination and Chinese astrology, career diviners were of a lower status and earned only a modest income. Other humble occultist professions included sorcery and physiognomy; like merchants, those who practiced sorcery were banned from holding public office. Being <b>a</b> <b>butcher</b> was another lowly occupation, yet there is one case where <b>a</b> <b>butcher</b> became an official during Emperor Gaozu's reign, while Empress He (d. 189 CE) and her brother, the regent He Jin (d. 189 CE), came from a family of butchers. Runners and messengers who worked for the government were also considered to have a lowly status, yet some later became government officials.|$|E

He was {{recommended}} to Wright by John Vogelsong, Jr., the caterer for the Midway Gardens project. Carlton and his wife Gertrude had previously served in the house of Vogelsong's parents in Chicago. Originally a genial presence on the estate, Carlton grew increasingly paranoid. He stayed up late at night with <b>a</b> <b>butcher</b> knife, looking out the window. This behavior had been noticed by Wright and Borthwick, who issued an ad in a local paper for a replacement cook. Carlton was given notice that August 15, 1914 would be his last day in their employ.|$|E

He then established Ansgar Kjøtt og Pølseforretning, which at first was located at Nordmør Landbruksforretning butafter two years moved to Massestretet.

After growing restless in Winnipeg in 1879, McCauley sold his business and traveled west, this time to Edmonton. McCauley arrived in Edmonton in the fall of 1879 after 21 days of travelling by ox cart. He purchased a farm in Fort Saskatchewan the following spring, and farmed for two years before moving to Edmonton in 1882. In Edmonton, he opened the town's first livery and cartage business, the Edmonton Cartage Company, and <b>a</b> <b>butcher</b> shop in 1883.|$|E

Specific development opportunities within {{the vicinity of the}} High Street have been identified, with particular focus on land on Silver Street, adjacent to the canal.|$|E
