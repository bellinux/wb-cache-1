40|$|This paper {{provides}} an empirical investigation of monetary policy in Japan in the zero interest rate environment that has held sway since 1999. In particular, {{we focus on}} the effects of the zero interest rate commitment and of quantitative monetary easing on mediumto long-term interest rates in Japan. In the study we apply a version of the macro-finance approach, involving a combination of estimation of a structural macro-model and calibration of time-variant parameters to the yield curve observed in the market. This enables us to decompose interest rates into expectations and risk premium components and simultaneously to extract the market's perception of the Bank of Japan's (BOJ's) willingness to carry on its zero interest rate policy. In the analysis we make clear the counterfactual policy that would have been practiced {{in the absence of the}} actual policies followed by the BOJ since 1999. From this analysis, we tentatively conclude that the BOJ's monetary policy since 1999 has functioned mainly through the zero interest rate commitment, which has led to declines in medium- to long-term interest rates. We also find some evidence that, up until the end of 2003, raising the reserve target may have been perceived as a signal indicating the BOJ's <b>accommodative</b> policy <b>stance</b> although the size of the effect is not large.

Employing a dynamic structural multi-country model with a financial accelerator, this paper studies the roles of two important policy actions in economic recovery: fiscal stimulus and financial sector rehabilitation. The main finding is that while both factors contribute to economic recovery, the former {{is likely to be}} less effective from a medium-term perspective and may generate some negative side effects. This suggests that policy priority should be on continued financial sector rehabilitation, particularly in advanced economies. Moreover, international policy co-ordination is beneficial as it can generate spill-over effects to regional economies. We also study a potential risk to economic recovery down the road: an over-estimation of the post-crisis potential output by the monetary authorities in advanced economies.

Infrastructure spending takes ages to be implemented and is thus useless for cyclical purposes. Coupled with an already <b>accommodative</b> <b>stance</b> of the ECB's monetary policy and further calls to amend the Stability and Growth Pact, can these initiatives achieve an appropriate policy mix with a view to contributing to economic growth and full employment?

40|$|Following the {{emergence}} of the financial crisis in August 2007, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision established in 2010 a new global regulatory framework. In addition to raising capital requirements, it introduced three ratios, two of which set out minimum standards for liquidity and funding risk, i. e. the liquidity coverage ratio and the net stable funding ratio, and one which aims to limit leverage in the banking system, i. e. the leverage ratio. All three ratios can have a number of implications for monetary policy implementation, in particular the liquidity coverage ratio and the net stable funding ratio owing to the special role of central banks in providing liquidity. This paper investigates {{the extent to which the}} regulatory initiatives might have already had an impact on banks 2 ̆ 019 behaviour in Eurosystem monetary policy operations.

40|$|The subpar {{performance}} of the U. S. economy extended into {{the first half of}} 2003. Although accommodative macroeconomic policies and continued robust productivity growth helped to sustain aggregate demand, businesses remained cautious about spending and hiring. All told, real gross domestic product continued to rise {{in the first half of}} the year but less quickly than the economy's productive capacity was increasing, and margins of slack in labor and product markets thereby widened further. As a result, underlying inflation remained low [...] and, indeed, seems to have moved down another notch. In financial markets, longer-term interest rates fell, on net, over the first half of the year as the decline in inflation and the subdued {{performance of}} the economy led market participants to conclude that short-term interest rates would be lower than previously anticipated. These lower interest rates helped to sustain a rally in equity prices that had begun in mid-March. The Federal Reserve expects economic activity to strengthen later this year and in 2004, in part because of the <b>accommodative</b> <b>stance</b> of monetary policy and the broad-based improvement in financial conditions. In addition, fiscal policy is likely to be stimulative as the provisions of the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 go into effect and as defense spending continues to ramp up. Severe budgetary pressures are causing state and local governments to cut spending and to increase taxes and fees, but these actions should offset only a portion of the impetus from the federal sector. Moreover, the continued favorable performance of productivity growth should lift household and business incomes and thereby encourage capital spending.

5000|$|Most importantly, in October 2008 the Congress {{gave the}} Federal Reserve {{statutory}} {{authority to pay}} interest on balances that banks hold at the Federal Reserve Banks. By increasing the interest rate on banks' reserves, the Federal Reserve {{will be able to}} put significant upward pressure on all short-term interest rates, as banks will not supply short-term funds to the money markets at rates significantly below what they can earn by holding reserves at the Federal Reserve Banks. Actual and prospective increases in short-term interest rates will be reflected in turn in higher longer-term interest rates and in tighter financial conditions more generally....As an additional means of draining reserves, the Federal Reserve is also developing plans to offer to depository institutions term deposits, which are roughly analogous to certificates of deposit that the institutions offer to their customers. A proposal describing a term deposit facility was recently published in the Federal Register, and the Federal Reserve is finalizing a revised proposal in light of the public comments that have been received. After a revised proposal is reviewed by the Board, we expect to be able to conduct test transactions this spring and to have the facility available if necessary thereafter. The use of reverse repos and the deposit facility would together allow the Federal Reserve to drain {{hundreds of billions of dollars}} of reserves from the banking system quite quickly, should it choose to do so.When these tools are used to drain reserves from the banking system, they do so by replacing bank reserves with other liabilities; the asset side and the overall size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet remain unchanged. If necessary, as a means of applying monetary restraint, the Federal Reserve also has the option of redeeming or selling securities. The redemption or sale of securities would have the effect of reducing the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet as well as further reducing the quantity of reserves in the banking system. Restoring the size and composition of the balance sheet to a more normal configuration is a longer-term objective of our policies. In any case, the sequencing of steps and the combination of tools that the Federal Reserve uses as it exits from its currently very <b>accommodative</b> policy <b>stance</b> will depend on economic and financial developments and on our best judgments about how to meet the Federal Reserve's dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability.In sum, in response to severe threats to our economy, the Federal Reserve created a series of special lending facilities to stabilize the financial system and encourage the resumption of private credit flows to American families and businesses. As market conditions and the economic outlook have improved, these programs have been terminated or are being phased out. The Federal Reserve also promoted economic recovery through sharp reductions in its target for the federal funds rate and through large-scale purchases of securities. The economy continues to require the support of accommodative monetary policies. However, we have been working to ensure that we have the tools to reverse, at the appropriate time, the currently very high degree of monetary stimulus. We have full confidence that, when the time comes, we will be ready to do so.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} oil prices on {{inflation}} has varied considerably {{over the last}} 50 years. In the 1970 s and early 1980 s, oil price increases were associated with high and rising inflation. In the late 1980 s and 1990 s, however, the effect of oil prices on inflation appeared to moderate. While {{the experience of the}} earlier period is unlikely to be repeated today because of a better anchoring of long-term inflation expectations, recent evidence suggests oil prices again may be playing a more significant role in the inflation process. This article argues that the pass through of oil price changes to inflation—though still low when compared with the 1970 s and 1980 s— has increased in the last five years. In particular, the average effect of oil prices on inflation today is about double what it was in the early 2000 s. One explanation is that consumer spending on petroleum and petroleum products as a share of total spending, which fell in the 1990 s, has increased to levels last observed in the 1970 s.

I provide an empirical and a theoretical analysis on the link between the markup, as a proxy for the market structure, and the equilibrium interest rate. I uncover some evidence that higher markups are associated with lower real rates and that more market friendly economies display higher interest rates. I propose an OLG model with monopolistic competition to interpret these findings. I focus on the effects on the equilibrium of a change in market structure, both in an exogenous and endogenous markup framework.

40|$|Through the {{analysis}} of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) in Turkey with Islamist roots, this dissertation examines the relationship between “moderation” of religious political parties, i. e. moving towards programmatic positions compatible with liberal democracy and their ongoing mobilization practices. Based on data collected through fieldwork conducted in Turkey over 22 months, from September 2006 through June 2008, this study argues that the transformation of the Islamist party into a mass based center-right party in Turkey was possible {{to the extent that the}} AKP pursued “moderation” not only at the external level by moving towards a more <b>accommodative</b> <b>stance</b> vis-à-vis the other political actors and the regime, but also at the intra-party and grassroots levels. This transformation entailed re-drawing the boundaries between religion and politics through efforts to forge a “conservative democratic” party identity within the mass organizational network it has inherited from its predecessors and to develop multiple modes of linkages between the party and mass base moving away from religious mobilization, reconciling the principles of secularism, nationalism and liberal economic policies with its constituents religious sensibilities. AKP’s effort in developing a more inclusive and representative party involved structural transformation through new recruitment patterns, constructing a new party genealogy and diffusing a new symbolic and discursive structure through training and other intra-party activities as well as through the everyday practices of the local party units and municipalities. By continuing to rely on the diffuse Islamic networks for filling the important party positions, the AKP sought to retain its Islamic credentials while shedding Islamic insignia (except for the women’s headscarves), ending gender segregation, incorporating more women into the party’s administrative cadres. At the local level, through its grassroots organizing structure, the AKP has been able to continue to carry on its strong social embeddedness. The AKP’s base units working with the local municipality run by the party communicated the AKP government’s policy positions that dramatically differed from its predecessors without Islamic justification, but instead worked as a liaison between the state and the local constituency, delivering constituency-service effectively through its social service provision and cultural activities. ...|$|E
40|$|Companies' {{access to}} finance has a {{significant}} impact on their profitability and growth prospects. Without external financing, most firms are not able to invest, which is a prerequisite for economic growth. In contrast to the US, which has a capital market-based financial system, banks are the dominant lenders for firms in the euro area. Banking crises endanger {{access to finance}}. In the wake of the banking and sovereign debt crisis in the euro area, risk premiums for sovereign debt went up and spilled over to banking markets. Besides sovereigns, firms too faced credit constraints, especially in countries with presumably less sustainable public debt. After the European Central Bank (ECB) accelerated its <b>accommodative</b> monetary policy <b>stance</b> even further, interest rates for sovereigns and firms fell considerably, enabling firms to lend money at historically low rates. With the strengthened recovery of the euro area, the end of this ultra-low interest rate environment seems to be near, posing new challenges for firms in the euro area. The aim {{of this study is to}} analyse how firms have dealt with this changing financing environment in recent years and to what extent companies are ready for a change towards higher interest rates. To answer this research question, we have used data from the survey on the access to finance of enterprises (SAFE) provided by the ECB. We identify companies that are vulnerable to rising interest rates, as they will presumably encounter economic problems when financing costs rise. The percentage of vulnerable companies is extremely high in Greece (9. 4 percent), Italy (8. 5 percent) and France (5. 7 percent). The lowest rate is in Germany (0. 7 percent). In relation to the size of the national business sectors, 39 percent of all vulnerable firms are located in Italy, 23 percent in France and 15 percent in Spain. When the ECB starts to normalize monetary policy, these countries could be hit hard through their business sectors' vulnerability. As a comparatively many large companies are prone to the risk of rising interest rates in Portugal (4. 0 percent of big Portuguese companies) and Greece (10. 0 percent of big Greek companies), the labour markets in those countries could be disproportionally affected when interest rates rise too quickly or become too high...|$|R
40|$|U. S. Treasury {{securities}} are nominal {{assets that}} {{are subject to}} two sources of risk: inflation risk, and bond-supply risk. Inflation risk is well-known, but supply risk has received little attention. For reasons we shall discuss {{in the body of}} the paper, the amount of securities offered to the public or withdrawn from circulation is not fully predictable. Because participation in these markets requires some liquidity, when the supply of T-bills fluctuates, participants in the market must either accept the changes in the rates of interest, or else end up with lower rate of return assets as substitutes. Our study begins with a look at monthly data over the past eighty years of Fed history. We find that supply risk has added about a 13 basis-point risk to the real rate of return on three-month T-bills over the postwar period, which is down from an average of about 36 basis-points over the 1920 - 46 period. The effect of inflation risk on the T-bill rate, on the other hand, has declined from nearly five and a half percentage points before the war to only one percent over the past 20 years as Fed policy has rendered the price level more and more predictable. Next, we study how the stock market responds to shocks in the supply of Treasury securities. An increase in the supply of T-bills should lower their price and raise their rate of return. One may conjecture, then, that an increase in the supply of T-bills should also lower the price of stocks (a substitute asset) and raise their rate of return. In one dimension, this conjecture turns out to be correct: Over the 1920 - 99 period, stock returns and T-bill rates are both positively related to surprises in the growth of T-bills, although the correlation with stock returns is very small. The conjecture is not entirely correct, though, because stock returns are negatively correlated with the T-bill rate. This suggests that the bond market and the stock market are segmented. Finally, we briefly examine the long-term trends in U. S. Treasury financing. The share of bonds in the aggregate security portfolio rises sharply until about the end of the Second World War, and then it declines fairly steadily. These trends do not seem to be related to the overall levels of interest rates and asset yields in the various periods. At monthly frequencies, however, supply risk in the bond market continues to matter in spite of these shifts in the relative importance of bonds. To sum up: We find that liquidity effects of bond injections are substantial, and that they have been with us for as long as we have the data to measure them. When measured in this way, the liquidity effect seems larger than what one can infer when one measures liquidity by the supply of money [...] whether money defined as nonborrowed reserves or more broadly. The Fed seems to be trying to keep the risk associated with these injections to a minimum, but is not able to push it to zero because the gradual paydown of the Federal debt has necessitated a less <b>accommodative</b> <b>stance</b> with regard to unexpectedly large rollover demands for Treasury securities among foreign financial institutions and international monetary authorities. Further, so long as the Fed uses the secondary market for Treasury securities as its primary means of conducting open market operations, shocks to the supply of these securities that are available to the public will persist. This suggests that as the supply of outstanding Treasury securities falls, a policy that seeks to minimize surprises to this supply by increasing the use of other debt instruments for open market operations will help Treasury securities to maintain their desirable feature of true "risklessness.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the communication between {{people living with}} schizophrenia (PwS) and their family and professional carers, {{with the aim of}} identifying behaviours and strategies that are associated with desirable outcomes. Disordered communication is a key symptom in the diagnosis of schizophrenia, and carers identify problems in everyday communication as contributing to their burden of care. Many laboratory-based and clinical studies have investigated formal thought disorder (and other clinical factors) that may cause trouble in conversations with PwS. Few have taken a communication approach, however, and focused on the everyday interactions between carers and PwS. This thesis uses Communication Accommodation Theory (CAT) to identify patterns of behaviour and sociolinguistic strategies that work well in a natural setting. It uses a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, and has a secondary aim of testing the applicability of text analytics software programs (in particular, Leximancer and NVivo) in the health domain. The first study explored the inter-group dynamics in 17 natural conversations between carers and PwS. Different patterns of behaviour were observed within the sample of PwS: some PwS were highly talkative (introducing and changing topics, and contributing much of the content), and others were reticent (responding minimally and behaving in a reactive manner). Different dynamics were also observed in the conversations between PwS and family versus professional carers, perhaps reflecting the different relationships between the participants. While the carers used a variety of strategies to manage different styles of communication among the PwS, across the board they adopted an <b>accommodative</b> <b>stance</b> in the face of under-accommodation by the PwS. In the second study, 15 carers were interviewed about their daily communication experiences, and the content was coded for emergent themes. Comparisons were made between the concepts identified by hand using NVivo, and those that emerged automatically via the Leximancer software. The carers were asked to describe communication problems, and to explain what strategies they used to overcome these. Most carers were able to describe useful strategies for achieving everyday goals, even if they had no formal training in communication skills. A small set of key strategies was reported to work well across a variety of contexts. The final, questionnaire-based, study explored the experiences of a wider sample of 45 carers. A mixed quantitative/qualitative measure was developed, based on the findings of the interview study. The results revealed some common strategies that worked well across the board. For example, most carers described it as useful to adopt a positive approach in managing conversations with their relative. Most carers also recommended exercising self-restraint, but this strategy was used particularly where the PwS’s conversational tendencies were extreme (whether highly reticent or highly talkative). Such nuances in carers’ usage of strategies suggested that they adjusted their accommodative moves to suit their relative’s individual conversational needs. For example, carers made more effort to improve mutual understanding when interacting with highly reticent PwS. On the other hand, they emphasised reducing the pressure placed upon very talkative PwS. A short list of practical suggestions were devised that may assist new carers to communicate better with their relatives with schizophrenia. Future research could test the success of a training intervention based on these guidelines. This thesis highlights the need for additional informational and training support for family carers of people living with schizophrenia. It demonstrates some opportunities for innovation in clinical assessment by applying new text analytics technologies. It also shows the utility of taking a communication approach, and of Communication Accommodation Theory, in this context. The research is unusual in taking this approach to studying communication in a clinical population, and the results indicate the benefits of doing so...|$|E
40|$|U. S. {{economic}} {{growth has been}} gaining momentum, with the annualized growth rate of real GDP reaching 3. 1 % {{in the fourth quarter}} of 2010. Factoring in this good performance, the IMF has revised upward its economic outlook for 2011 by 0. 7 percentage points to 3. 0 %. At the same time, the labor market has been slow to improve, and housing markets are still adjusting; hence the contribution of labor and housing to {{economic growth}} has been rather moderate. Furthermore, the devastating earthquake in Japan hit the economy at a time when the recovery of economic activity was still fragile. Judging from previous experience with earthquakes, international organizations expect the setback in Japanese growth to be temporary, however. The growth effect might swing back into positive territory as reconstruction efforts accelerate in the second half of 2011. Given the limited openness of the Japanese economy, the repercussions on the world economy are likely to remain subdued. The Bank of Japan (BoJ) moved to support the economy by providing ample liquidity and expanding its purchases of securities from the private sector. The G- 7 economies joined forces to intervene against the strong appreciation of the Japanese yen in the days following the earthquake. The year 2010 saw China emerge as the second-largest economy worldwide behind the United States, measured at current GDP prices. The IMF expects the Chinese economy to grow by 9. 6 % in 2011. The Chinese central bank responded by raising minimum reserve requirements a few times and by increasing its key monetary policy rates three times to keep the economy from overshooting. The renminbi has appreciated by close to 4 % since China returned to a more flexible exchange rate arrangement in 2010. Euro area real GDP grew by just 0. 3 % quarterly {{in the fourth quarter of}} 2010. Euro areawide unemployment reached 9. 9 % in January 2011, just 0. 2 percentage points short of the 12 -year peak recorded in October 2010. ECB staff projections for GDP growth in 2011 are within a range of 1. 3 % and 2. 1 %. Reflecting commodity price increases, the annual growth rate of HICP inflation has been trending upward since mid- 2010, standing at 2. 4 % in February 2011. While the economic recovery implied a reversal of public debt dynamics in most euro area countries, the high debt levels of some euro area countries continued to cause turbulence. Exacerbated by the downgrading of ratings for Greece Portugal and Spain, the spreads payable on sovereign bonds issued by peripheral European countries remained elevated. In the spirit of European solidarity, a permanent crisis mechanism – the European Stability Mechanism – has been established in the euro area, which will become operational in mid- 2013. The gradual economic recovery in Central, Eastern and Southeastern European (CESEE) EU Member States continued in the second half of 2010. The business cycles of the countries in the area reconverged somewhat, and domestic demand gained momentum as a driver of growth. These developments were underpinned by a stabilization of current account balances, following a significant recovery of those positions during the recent years of subdued economic growth. Rising food prices and tax increases in a number of countries stoked inflation in recent months, prompting a number of central banks to raise their key monetary policy rates, thereby initiating a reversal from the broadly <b>accommodative</b> <b>stance</b> adopted in the period of crisis. The Austrian economy, finally, is in very good shape notwithstanding a number of risk factors. The key engine of growth has been the manufacturing industry, which has begun to invest again given strong export growth, whereas the construction sector continues to contract. The OeNB’s short-term economic indicator results point to above-average growth in the first half of 2011. These developments will, in turn, continue to improve labor market conditions, which are already favorable. The surge in energy and commodity prices has caused inflation to rise strongly lately; the rate hit 3. 1 % in February 2011. global outlook, euro area, central, eastern and southeastern Europe, Austria...|$|E
