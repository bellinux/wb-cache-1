25|$|The {{number of}} points awarded on each hole is {{determined}} based on comparison {{of the number of}} strokes taken to a fixed score, usually par. This fixed score is then adjusted in relation to the player's handicap. Once players have taken two strokes more than the adjusted fixed score, they may abandon the hole and move on to the next, as it is then not possible to score any points on that hole. Because of this, it is still possible to be competitive even allowing for a few bad holes. At the end of the round, the {{number of points}} scored on each hole is totaled to give a final score. The winner of a Stableford competition is the player with the highest point total. Final scores may be modified for all players using the Competition Stableford <b>Adjustment</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

For a period of time PC-based mainframe-compatible systems had a lower price and did not require as much electricity or floor space. However, they sacrificed performance and were not as dependable as mainframe-class hardware. These products have been popular with mainframe developers, in education and training settings, for very small companies with non-critical processing, and in certain disaster relief roles (such as field insurance <b>adjustment</b> <b>systems</b> for hurricane relief).|$|R

Relative to full capitation, âmixedâ payment systems and soft capitation reduce the ability of carve-outs to earn disproportionate profits by enrolling healthy patients and avoiding sick ones, yet also diminish incentives for cost containment.
