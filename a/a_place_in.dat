5|$|He {{picked up}} a {{hamstring}} injury during a match against Newcastle United in January 2004, which ruled him out of action for three weeks. In 2003–04, Heskey faced increasing competition from Milan Baroš for <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> the Liverpool starting line-up. Nevertheless, he scored 12goals and secured <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> the England squad for UEFA Euro 2004.|$|E
5|$|Although Luton won the League Cup, {{they did}} not earn <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> the UEFA Cup, as UEFA chose not to relax its ban on English teams from playing in European club {{competitions}} during the late 1980s. David Evans, the Luton chairman was against his club participating in European football, though he never publicised his reasoning.|$|E
5|$|As title holders, Manchester City were {{entitled}} to defend the Cup Winners' Cup in the 1970–71 season. Had they not won the trophy, they would still have been qualified for European competition, as City's victory in the 1970 League Cup granted <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> the Fairs Cup. As a UEFA-organised competition, the Cup Winners' Cup took precedence over the Fairs Cup, and so the club took <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> the former. In the first round Manchester City almost suffered an upset {{at the hands of}} Linfield, from Belfast. City held a one-goal lead after the first leg, but Linfield twice took the lead in the second leg. The match finished 2–1 to Linfield, and Manchester City progressed on the away goals rule. Honvéd were the opposition in the second round. Manchester City won both legs, the score 3–0 on aggregate.|$|E

He also won the fifth and deciding match against Igor Andreev in straight sets, booking Argentina <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> the final.|$|E
5|$|His form linked {{him to a}} £4million {{transfer}} to Leeds United. However Humphreys remained at Sheffield Wednesday and played 34 matches {{for them in the}} 1996–97 season. His performances earned him <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> the England team for the 1997 FIFA U-20 World Cup in Malaysia. Humphreys wore the much coveted number 9 shirt for that tournament.|$|E
50|$|Kerr {{made his}} World Cup debut in January 2008 with <b>a</b> twelfth <b>place</b> <b>in</b> Les Contamines, and {{followed}} up with <b>an</b> eighth <b>place</b> <b>in</b> Meiringen-Hasliberg in March.

50|$|The {{first season}} with the new name was a great one for FC Argeș, which {{finished}} 2nd, with {{the same number of}} points as Steaua București, the champions of that season. The best ranking in club's history until then was followed only by <b>a</b> 12th <b>place</b> <b>in</b> 1969, <b>a</b> 10th <b>place</b> <b>in</b> 1970 and <b>a</b> 9th <b>place</b> <b>in</b> 1971.|$|R
5|$|In the 2001–02 season, Cissé {{was the top}} scorer in Ligue 1 with 22 goals from 29 matches as Auxerre {{finished}} in third place and qualified for the 2002–03 UEFA Champions League. Cissé's form saw him make his debut for the French national team and earn <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> the team's squad for the 2002 FIFA World Cup.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} {{knockout}} round, United were drawn against Lyon, against whom they drew the away leg 1–1, {{thanks to a}} late equaliser from Carlos Tevez. The Red Devils then won the second leg 1–0 – Ronaldo scoring the only goal – to ensure a 2–1 aggregate win and <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> the quarter-finals, where they were again drawn against Roma.|$|E
5|$|Injury again hit Rhodes' 2005–06 season, {{during which}} he scored just one goal in a 2–1 victory over Yeovil Town. He started just five league games during the season, as Brentford reached the League One {{play-off}}s. Rhodes started the second leg of the play-off semi-finals but a 2–0 defeat to Swansea City denied them <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> the final.|$|E

He is the first-ever Israeli male taekwondo athlete to compete in the Olympics.|$|E
5|$|José Antonio Camacho led Benfica {{to another}} second-place finish and broke an eight-year title drought; he {{attracted}} interest from Real Madrid, who signed him in late May. As a replacement, Benfica unsuccessfully inquired after Luiz Felipe Scolari for the position. After much speculation, Benfica announced they had recruited Giovanni Trapattoni, the Italian national team's former manager. Benfica signed more players than the year before, but only Quim, Manuel dos Santos and Azar Karadas became regular first-team fixtures. The most significant departure {{was that of}} Tiago, {{who had been a}} regular for the past two seasons. Because their second-place finish only granted <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> the third qualifying round of the UEFA Champions League, Benfica had to play Anderlecht for <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> the group stage. A 3–1 loss on aggregate led to relegation to the 2004–05 UEFA Cup. Between both legs, Benfica contested and lost the 2004 Supercup with Porto.|$|E
5|$|L. The League Cup {{started in}} 1960–61. Most First Division clubs {{took part in}} it from the first season, but Albion did not enter until 1965–66, when the FA offered the winners <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup.|$|E

5|$|Nash {{continued}} to play district cricket and was considered a strong possibility for the 1934 tour of England. He was chosen {{to play in the}} Bert Ironmonger/Don Blackie benefit match, which was also a Test trial, but was forced to withdraw after contracting rheumatism in his shoulder. Nash's replacement, Hans Ebeling, bowled well enough to secure <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> the tour squad instead.|$|E
5|$|O: This {{is not an}} {{official}} nomination. After nominations were announced, information came to light that showed that <b>A</b> <b>Place</b> <b>in</b> the World (1992) was wholly produced in Argentina, and had insufficient Uruguayan artistic control.

5|$|Other composers {{who have}} used the organ {{prominently}} in orchestral music include Gustav Holst, Richard Strauss, Ottorino Respighi, Gustav Mahler, Anton Bruckner, and Ralph Vaughan Williams.
