25|$|Porter {{wrote in}} 1980 that {{companies}} have to make choices about their scope {{and the type of}} competitive advantage they seek to achieve, whether lower cost or differentiation. The idea of strategy targeting particular industries and customers (i.e., competitive positions) with a differentiated offering was a departure from the experience-curve influenced strategy paradigm, which was focused on larger scale and lower cost. Porter revised the strategy paradigm again in 1985, writing that superior performance of the processes and <b>activities</b> <b>performed</b> by organizations as part of their value chain is the foundation of competitive advantage, thereby outlining a process view of strategy.|$|E
25|$|There {{is clear}} polyethism among A. pallipes where the young workers {{care for the}} larvae and older workers forage and defend the nest.

Other <b>activities</b> <b>performed</b> by the older workers include removing larvae from the nest, rubbing gaster on the nest and destroying cells. Intra-cell activities like checking cells, moving gaster and self-grooming were all-indicative of younger workers. Therefore, there is a clear relation between age and function thus implying that A. pallipes displays temporal polyethism behavior.|$|E

These two projects had overlaps in research objectives though run in a completely different manner: The RFP tackled questions related to fault and fracture zones in different tectonic regimes but mainly in clastic sedimentary rocks, and was sponsored by a considerable amount of Oil Companies, whereas the GFN was sponsored by only a few companies and focussed on specific genetic relationships in different selected sites. Furthermore, between the three projects there was an overlap in industrial sponsors and stake holders (though Eni was in the privileged position of being the only company involved in all three of them). In this way, the Projects could mutually benefit from the results obtained, and provide suggestions for steering of their relative research activities.|$|E

2500|$|Article 200 was {{purposeful}} to CeauÈescu {{regime in}} that, since 1970, it offered a pry to strengthen social control. These restrictions under the Penal Code were strictly unique to Romania {{and no other}} European country. The restrictions only included relationships and those who considered themselves homosexual were not punished but were instead considered as mentally ill. In the early 1990s, when gay rights activists, international human rights organizations, and the European Council started to press the Romanian government to decriminalize homosexuality and ensure equal rights for all citizens, the conservative political elites and the Orthodox Church claimed that sexual minorities {{did not exist in}} Romania prior to 1989 and that homosexuality was only an undesirable product of capitalism, a life style induced by the Western democracies, and {{not a part of the}} heteronormative Romanian culture. In 1995, Romania applied for EU membership. As of 1995, it was one of only three countries in Europe that still criminalized homosexuality. Due mainly to strong [...] international pressure, in 1996, the first paragraph of Article 200 was amended and only same-sex sexual <b>activities</b> <b>performed</b> in public or considered a source of public scandal were punished by the law. In 2000, Romania began EU accession negotiations and the country had to demonstrate progress in harmonizing its laws with the EU legislation. In particular, Romania had to prove that sexual minority human rights were not violated by the country's policies and legislation. And the possibility of eventual entry into the European Union had a powerful effect on legal change. In January 2001, Adrian NÄstase government adopted the Emergency Ordinance no. 89/2001, which eliminated Art. 200 of the Penal Code and adjusted other articles referring to sex offenses to avoid discriminatory treatment of offenders. This ordinance came into force in January 2002, after President Ion Iliescu signed the new law.|$|E
