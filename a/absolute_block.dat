Although the companies wished to amalgamate {{they could not}} obtain government agreement until 1862, when the Great Eastern Railway (GER) was formed. In common with most railways, signalling was fairly basic and trains were separated by time interval. As traffic levels increased {{there was a need}} to improve signalling and in 1869 the GER introduced <b>absolute</b> <b>block</b> working between Fenchurch Street, Gasworks Junction and Bow Junction, opening signal boxes at all locations.|$|E

30|$|The {{algorithm}} {{cannot be}} analyzed straightforwardly due to absolute {{value of the}} term that includes noise. Simulations are also used instead of analysis in reference state-of-the art algorithm developments due to mathematical intractability [14, 15, 19 – 21]. Based on the simulations, the MFxLMS algorithm behaves and converges almost identically with the algorithm without <b>absolute</b> <b>blocks</b> in a fading channel when the transmitted SNR is high enough. Actually, the MFxLMS algorithm is more robust since fast phase changes do not affect its performance.

2500|$|In the U.S., {{interurban}} (German Überland(straßen)bahn) {{refers to}} a higher-speed streetcar (tram) line – i.e. electrical railcars or trains which run both between the cities or towns (often in rural environments) on their own right-of-way, and through the city streets as trams. In the U.S., some interurban railcars constructed in the period 1900–1930 ran at extremely high speed for its time. Essentially, the classic interurbans were the light-rail lines of the day. Several advanced innovations – like streamlining, wind tunnel research and lightweight constructions – have their origin on the interurban scene, or were early adopted by companies like J. G. Brill Company, Cincinnati Car Company, and St. Louis Car Company. The fastest interurbans had a maximum service speed at 145–150km/h, and an average speed including stops at above 80km/h. The Cincinnati–Toledo route of Cincinnati and Lake Erie Railroad was [...] A few interurbans like Philadelphia and Western Railroad adapted to high speeds with double-track, <b>absolute</b> <b>block</b> signalling and without grade crossings. Others ran at (too) high speed on single-track right-of-way without block signalling – and experienced disastrous wrecks.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the days}} of the first British railways, [...] "policemen" [...] were {{employed}} by every railway company. Their jobs were many and varied, but one of their key roles was the giving of hand signals to inform engine drivers as to the state of the line ahead. They had no means of communication with their colleagues along the line, and trains were only protected by a time interval; after a train had passed him, a policeman would stop any following train if it arrived within (say) 5 minutes; for any between 5 and 10 minutes after, he would show a caution signal, and after 10 minutes, the line was assumed to be clear. Therefore, if a train failed midsection (as was very common in the early days), the policeman controlling entry to the section would not know, and could easily give a 'clear' signal to a following train when the section was not in fact clear. The number of collisions which resulted from this led to the gradual introduction of the <b>absolute</b> <b>block</b> principle; all systems of working other than this (including time-interval and permissive block) were outlawed on passenger lines in 1889, and all passenger lines were suitably equipped by 1895.|$|E
2500|$|The Upper Tribunal's {{decision}} was subsequently vetoed in October 2012 by the Attorney General for England and Wales, Dominic Grieve, who {{was supported in}} his decision by the Cabinet of the United Kingdom. The attorney general's veto placed an <b>absolute</b> <b>block</b> on {{the publication of the}} letters, which Grieve described as containing the [...] "particularly frank" [...] and [...] "most deeply held personal views and beliefs" [...] of the Prince of Wales. Grieve detailed the letters as containing [...] "...remarks about public affairs which would in my view, if revealed, have had a material effect upon the willingness of the government to engage in correspondence with the Prince of Wales, and would potentially have undermined his position of political neutrality....my decision is based on my view that the correspondence was undertaken as part of the Prince of Wales's preparation for becoming king. The Prince of Wales engaged in this correspondence with ministers with the expectation that it would be confidential. Disclosure of the correspondence could damage the Prince of Wales's ability to perform his duties when he becomes king." [...] Grieve concluded his justification of his veto by stating that [...] "It is a matter of the highest importance within our constitutional framework that the monarch is a politically neutral figure able to engage in confidence with the government of the day, whatever its political colour." [...] Grieve also said that any perception that Charles had disagreed with Blair's government [...] "would be seriously damaging to his role as future monarch because, if he forfeits his position of political neutrality as heir to the throne, he cannot easily recover it when he is king". The Guardian announced their intention to challenge the attorney general's veto in the High Court of Justice.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — {{the present}} work investigates image compression. Two {{algorithms}} were selected namely; block truncation coding (BTC) and <b>Absolute</b> Moment <b>block</b> truncation coding (AMBTC) and a comparative study was performed. The Block Truncation Coding (BTC), <b>Absolute</b> Moment <b>block</b> truncation coding (AMBTC) are the lossy image compression algorithms. These are simple {{and easy to}} implement image compression algorithms. The basic BTC and AMBTC algorithm is a lossy fixed length compression method that uses a Q level quantizer to quantize a given region of the image. Both of two techniques rely on applying divided image into non overlapping blocks. They differ {{in the way of}} selecting the quantization level in order to remove redundancy...|$|R
30|$|We have {{modified}} the conventional FxLMS structure {{by adding the}} <b>absolute</b> value <b>blocks</b> to the algorithm and having a wireless channel as a system to be controlled and inverted. In addition, a large difference in our system to conventional control systems comes with a separate receiver and transmitter. The main reason for the addition of <b>absolute</b> value <b>blocks</b> {{is that we are}} adjusting power levels and thus interested only in amplitude values, similar to AGC circuits [3]. Phases are not important from the power control point of view, and in this way, we can reduce control information to be carried. This also makes the system more robust since phases can change fast during deep fades and thus cause problems to the adaptive algorithm [39, 40].|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} UV-irradiation on the {{conversion}} of the single-stranded DNA of the parvovirus Minute-Virus-of-Mice (MVM) to duplex Replicative Forms (RF) was studied after infection of mouse A 9 fibroblasts. UV-irradiation of the virus prior to infection of unirradiated cells resulted in a dose-dependent, single-hit, inhibition of RF formation. Restriction fragment analysis indicated that this inhibition could be ascribed to the introduction of <b>absolute</b> <b>blocks</b> which prevent elongation of the newly synthesized complementary strand. Cell exposure to UV-light prior to infection with UV-irradiated MVM enhanced the fraction of input viral DNA which was converted to RF. This enhancement required de novo protein synthesis during the interval between cell irradiation and virus infection. These results suggest that DNA replication constitutes a target in the viral life cycle that leads to the UV-enhanced Reactivation of virus survival, however they do not permit us to identify the step of RF formation which is enhanced in UV-pretreated cells. © 1982 IRL Press Limited.

60|$|Lady Frances {{had never}} been {{specially}} in her way, but to Lady Frances the stepmother had been perhaps harder than to the stepson, of whose presence as an <b>absolute</b> <b>block</b> to her ambition she was well aware. Lady Frances had no claim to a respect higher than that which was due to her own children. Primogeniture had done nothing for her. She was a Marquis's daughter, but {{her mother had been}} only the offspring of a commoner. There was perhaps something of conscience in her feelings towards the two. As Lord Hampstead was undoubtedly in her way, it occurred to her to think that she should not on that account be inimical to him. Lady Frances was not in her way,--and therefore was open to depreciation and dislike without wounds to her conscience; and then, though Hampstead was abominable because of his Republicanism, his implied treason, and blasphemy, yet he was entitled to some excuse as being a man. These things were abominable no doubt in him, but more pardonably abominable than they would be in a woman. Lady Frances had never declared herself to be a Republican or a disbeliever, much less a rebel,--as, indeed, had neither Lord Hampstead. In the presence of her stepmother she was generally silent on matters of political or religious interest. But she was supposed to sympathise with her brother, and was known to be far from properly alive to aristocratic interests. There was never quarrelling between the two, but {{there was a lack of}} that friendship which may subsist between a stepmother of thirty-eight and a stepdaughter of twenty-one. Lady Frances was tall and slender, with quiet speaking features, dark in colour, with blue eyes, and hair nearly black. In appearance she was the very opposite of her stepmother, moving quickly and achieving grace as she did so, without a thought, by the natural beauty of her motions. The dignity was there, but without a thought given to it. Not even did the little lords, her brothers, chuck their books and toys about with less idea of demeanour. But the Marchioness never arranged a scarf or buttoned a glove without feeling that it was her duty to button her glove and arrange her scarf as became the Marchioness of Kingsbury.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>absolute</b> <b>block</b> system {{enables the}} safe working of trains between manual signal boxes. As power {{signalling}} installations are implemented covering a wide area of control, manual signal boxes are gradually being supplanted, and the <b>absolute</b> <b>block</b> system is now mostly confined to limited {{areas of the}} network that carry lighter and slower traffic (there are exceptions, such as the Great Western main line through much of Cornwall). As noted above all Network Rail RUSs point to lines where <b>absolute</b> <b>block</b> signalling is a bar to increased services (both passenger and freight trains). The problem is made worse by rationalisation in the 1960s which closed signal boxes and made some <b>absolute</b> <b>block</b> sections of considerable length.|$|E
