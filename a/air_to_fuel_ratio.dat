This incinerator is internally divided into primary, secondary, intermediate and heat exchanger chambers. In the primary chamber, the infectious meat is burned using 95 – 200 kW burner, the combustion products are then passed through the intermediate chamber, the secondary chamber, and eventually through the heat exchanger chamber. A 50 kW burner is installed in the secondary chamber to complete the combustion of CO and to destruct the dioxin. Fresh air is then introduced to the flue gases to dilute the emission concentrations and to reduce the flue gas temperature. The flue gas is finally cleaned using an activated coke filter which is installed before the incinerator stack.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the proposed project was to confirm the feasibility of using blends of hydrogen and natural gas to improve the performance, efficiency, controllability and emissions of a homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engine. The project team utilized both engine simulation and laboratory testing to evaluate and optimize how blends of hydrogen and natural gas fuel might improve control of HCCI combustion. GTI utilized a state-of-the art single-cylinder engine test platform for the experimental work in the project. The testing was designed to evaluate the feasibility of extending the limits of HCCI engine performance (i. e., stable combustion, high efficiency and low emissions) on natural gas by using blends of natural gas and hydrogen. Early in the project Ricardo provided technical support to GTI as we applied their engine performance simulation program, WAVE, to our HCCI research engine. Modeling support was later provided by Digital Engines, LLC to use their proprietary model to predict peak pressures and temperatures for varying operating parameters included in the Design of Experiments test plan. Digital Engines also provided testing support for the hydrogen and natural gas blends. Prof. David Foster of University of Wisconsin-Madison participated early in the project by providing technical guidance on HCCI engine test plans and modeling requirements. The main purpose of the testing was to quantify the effects of hydrogen addition to natural gas HCCI. Directly comparing straight natural gas with the hydrogen enhanced test points is difficult due {{to the complexity of}} HCCI combustion. With the same air flow rate and lambda, the hydrogen enriched fuel mass flow rate is lower than the straight natural gas mass flow rate. However, the energy flow rate is higher for the hydrogen enriched <b>fuel</b> due <b>to</b> hydrogen's significantly greater lower heating value, 120 mJ/kg for hydrogen compared to 45 mJ/kg for natural gas. With these caveats in mind, an analysis of test results indicates that hydrogen enhanced natural gas HCCI (versus neat natural gas HCCI at comparable stoichiometry) had the following characteristics: (1) Substantially lower intake temperature needed for stable HCCI combustion; (2) Inconclusive impact on engine BMEP and power produced; (3) Small reduction in the thermal efficiency of the engine; (4) Moderate reduction in the unburned hydrocarbons in the exhaust; (5) Slight increase in NOx emissions in the exhaust; (6) Slight reduction in CO 2 in the exhaust; and (7) Increased knocking at rich stoichiometry. The major accomplishments and findings from the project can be summarized as follows: (1) A model was calibrated for accurately predicting heat release rate and peak pressures for HCCI combustion when operating on hydrogen and natural gas blends. (2) A single cylinder research engine was thoroughly mapped to compare performance and emissions for micro-pilot natural gas compression ignition, and HCCI combustion for neat natural gas versus blends of natural gas and hydrogen.

It covers the topic of MILD {{combustion}} of liquid propane gas, G 25 natural gas, synthesis gas and landfill gas, of which the latter two represents low calorific gaseous fuels. The investigated engine was a C 9 G Stirling engine from Cleanergy. The primary incentive to {{this study was to}} determine if steady and reliable operation of the C 9 G Stirling engine could be maintained while using low calorific gaseous fuels. Another incentive to this project was to achieve further understanding of the combustion device, which purpose is to supply the Stirling engine with heat. Thus, an understanding of the changed characteristics caused by varying the <b>air</b> <b>to</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>ratio</b> was targeted. Engine operation by use of landfill gas, made up by 20 percent methane in carbon dioxide and nitrogen, was successful at the lowest load setting allowed by the C 9 G engine, generating 1 : 5 kW of shaft power. For liquid propane gas and G 25 natural gas, up to 10 : 9 kW of shaft power was generated. Combustion of synthesis gas was not attempted due to the hazard of carbon monoxide poisoning, caused by insufficient ventilation in the test cell. Apparent changes in energy ows and temperatures within the combustion device at varied air to fuel ratios suggest that incomplete combustion prior to the heat sink of the Stirling engine was an issue, especially at low to moderate air to fuel ratios. Further, a reversed ow direction through the ue gas recirculation cavities was observed when high ow rates of fuel, which primarily occurs for high load settings and low air to fuel ratios, was supplied to the engine. Consequently, a higher <b>air</b> <b>to</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>ratio</b> resulted in a higher system efficiency for all tested fuels and load settings.

With DI technology, the fuel may be introduced within the cylinder after completion of the valve events. DI of fuel reduces the embedded air displacement effects of gaseous fuels and lowers the charge temperature. DI also allows lean stratified bulk combustion with enhanced rate of combustion and reduced heat transfer to the cylinder walls creating a bulk lean stratified mixture.

A double flame structure could be observed composed of a lower fuel entrainment region and an upper mixing and intense combustion region. The entrainment region was enveloped by an early OH layer, and then merged through a very thin OH neck to an annular OH layer located at the shear layer of the air jet. The two branches of this annular OH layer broaden as they moved downstream and eventfully merged together. Three types of events were observed common to all flames: breaks, closures and growing kernels. In upstream regions of the flames, the breaks were counterbalanced by flame closures. These breaks in OH signal were found to occur at locations where locally high velocity flows were impinging on the flame. As the Vr increased to 37. 4, the OH layers became discontinuous over the downstream region of the flame, and these regions of low or no OH moved upstream. With further increases in Vr, these OH pockets act as flame kernels, growing as they moved downstream, and became the main mechanism for flame re-ignition. Along the flame length, the direction of the two dimensional principle compressive strain rate axis exhibited a preferred orientation of approximately 45 ° with respect to the flow direction.

A single cylinder research engine was used to investigate the effects of misfire, ignition timing, <b>air</b> <b>to</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>ratio,</b> compression ratio, speed and load on the ion- current signal. The ion-current signal was obtained via one, or both, of two additional, remote in-cylinder ion sensors (rather than by via the firing spark plug, as is usually the case).

Ion-current signal interpretation was then conducted using an artificial neural network strategy (using adaptive linear networks) to interpret the measured signals, and also to predict the associated cylinder pressures. The combination of remote sensors with a linear neural network gives a more accurate and ‘noise’ free signal that can be processed at greater speed through computationally inexpensive methods. The computed results agree well with measured cylinder pressures under all analyzed conditions.

A number of water and gas heaters are also added to pre-heat the water and gas before entering the reformer. Measurement and data acquisition equipment are specified as well as an algorithm for the controllers. The limited budget available for the project means that some engine operating parameters, such as the <b>air</b> <b>to</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>ratio</b> and engine speed are not electronically actuated and therefore have to be controlled manually. Even though the system will operate mostly in steady state conditions, especially the <b>air</b> <b>to</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>ratio</b> control might prove to be difficult as a result of the changes in the fuel composition during start-up. The goal of this project however is to get some first practical experience with the proposed system and for this the proposed set-up will suffice...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Liquid phase {{injection}} {{technology is}} the key point in overcoming most of the traditional problems of LPG engines, related both to their low capability in <b>air</b> <b>to</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>ratio</b> control, and to the sensible power decrease with respect to analogous gasoline inducted IC engines. Anyway, the introduction of this technology in OEM equipments is still limited, being subjected to the overcoming of some relevant problems about liquid phase maintenance inside the fuel system, and to the so called "hot start delay " phenomenon. This work, through a comprehensive analysis of the dynamical behaviour of the injection system, individuates a solution able to enhance liquid phase control, while reducing hot start delay. 1...|$|E
40|$|Using of bio-ethanol as a {{fuel for}} fuel cells is {{especially}} attractive {{since it is}} a renewable energy source which can be produced domestically. Bio-ethanol powered fuel cell systems {{can be used for}} portable applications as well as for stationary systems, such as cogeneration plants. The main components of the fuel cell-reformer system for hydrogen production from bio-ethanol are reformer and CO-removal reactors, which require particular attention since these are complex parts of the system. The autothermal reforming (ATR) process of bio-ethanol is investigated in order to find the optimum operating conditions of the reformer and CO-removal reactors. The experimental tests were made on a fully automated ATR fuel cell system at the “Fraunhofer ISE”, using bio-ethanol as a fuel. The system consists of ATR, two-stage water-gas-shift reactors and CO-removal step - methanation. It is assumed that the reformate gas is fed into proton exchange membrane fuel cell and therefore after all cleaning steps the CO concentration should not exceed 20 ppm. The influence of steam to carbon ratio and other important parameters on the amount of hydrogen produced, possibilities to minimise carbon formation and the optimal operational conditions were investigated. All parts of the system were tested in various operational conditions by varying steam to carbon ratio from 1 <b>to</b> 3, <b>air</b> <b>to</b> <b>fuel</b> combustion <b>ratio,</b> ATR inlet temperature, temperatures of water-gas-shift reactors etc. The measured data are in good agreement with the simulations made with “ChemCAD” simulation program. The main goal of the work was to achieve the maximum hydrogen content and the minimum CO content in reformate gas, which is fed in the fuel cell by supplying minimum amount of energy to the system. The main parameter, which helps to compare similar systems, is the total system thermal efficiency, which was also estimated in the work...|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} 10 -kHz images of OH-PLIF simultaneously with 2 -D PIV measurements in an inverse methane diffusion flame. Under a constant fuel flow rate, the central air jet Re was varied, leading <b>to</b> <b>air</b> <b>to</b> <b>fuel</b> velocity <b>ratio,</b> Vr, <b>to</b> vary from 8. 3 to 66. 5. Starting from Vr = 20. 7, the flame is commonly characterized by three distinct zones. The {{length of the}} lower fuel entrainment region is inversely proportional to Vr. The flames investigated resemble a string shear layer confining this zone, and converging into the second distinct region, the flame neck zone. The third region {{is the rest of}} the flame, which spreads in a jet-like manner. The inverse diffusion flames exhibit varying degrees of partial premixing, depending upon on the velocity ratio Vr, and this region of partial premixing evolves into a well-mixed reaction zone along the flame centerline. The OH distribution correlated with the changes in the mean characteristics of the flow through reduction in the local Reynolds number due to heat release. The existence of a flame suppresses or laminarizes the turbulence at early axial locations and promotes fluctuations at the flame tip for flames with Vr < 49. 8. In addition, the flame jet width can be correlated to the OH distribution. In upstream regions of the flames, the breaks in OH are counterbalanced by flame closures and are governed by edge flame propagation. These local extinctions were found to occur at locations where large flow structures were impinging on the flame and are associated with a locally higher strain rate or correlated to the local high strain rates at the flame hole edges without this flow impinging. Another contributor to re-ignition was found to be growing flame kernels. As the flames approach global blow-off, these kernels become the main mechanism for re-ignition further downstream of the flames. At low Vr, laminarization within the early regions of the flame provides an effective shield, preventing the jet flow from penetrating through the flame. © Copyright © 2014 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC...|$|R
40|$|A {{model for}} a plasma fuel {{reformer}} or plasmatron has been developed. The model was based {{in a series of}} experiments realized at the Plasma Science and Fusion Center with such a plasmatron. The device is set up to produce syngas (hydrogen and carbon monoxide gas mixture) from partial oxidation of any hydrocarbon. We studied the behavior of methane as fuel and used the GRI methane combustion mechanism in our simulations. The goal was to characterize the reactor to be able to understand and predict its performance {{for a wide range of}} operating conditions, such as different flow rates, <b>air</b> <b>to</b> <b>fuel</b> flow <b>ratio</b> or power supply. The simulation tool used for this purpose was CHEMKIN 3. 7. The fuel reformer was designed as a reactor where combustion is initiated by an electric discharge due to ohmic heating of the arc region. Two different types of reactors were used to model the plasmatron. The Plug Flow Reactor (PLUG) assumed a homogenous zero-dimensional closed system. The Partially Stirred Reactor (PASR) considered random mixing determined by a frequency mixing parameter, which is directly dependant of the system fluid dynamic properties. Experimental results with methane generated 6 %- 7 % molar of hydrogen and 5 % of carbon monoxide. Hydrogen and oxygen balance evidenced that water and carbon dioxide are important co-products, obtaining respectively 10 % and 3 % at the exhaust. Also 15 %- 20 % of methane and 3 %- 5 % of oxygen remained unreacted. From discharge observations, energy estimations and model simulations, it was found that the electric arc initiates combustion by locally rising the temperature and then propagating the reaction by heat and mass transfer/mixing to the surroundings. (cont.) Simulation results demonstrated that there is an optimum characteristic mixing time for each residence time, depending on the initial temperature reached at the arc. It was also found that the more spread the energy is, or the more mass is heated to a moderate temperature, the better the performance results. by Nuria Margarit Bel. Thesis (S. M.)
