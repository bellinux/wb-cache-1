50|$|Farthings Wood is {{an ancient}} replanted {{woodland}} near Little Missenden in the English county of Buckinghamshire.

50|$|Distortion {{of scale}} {{increases}} in each UTM zone as {{the boundaries between}} the UTM zones are approached. However, it is often convenient or necessary to measure a series of locations on a single grid when some are located in two adjacent zones. <b>Around</b> <b>the</b> <b>boundaries</b> of large scale maps (1:100,000 or larger) coordinates for both adjoining UTM zones are usually printed within a minimum distance of 40 km {{on either side of}} a zone boundary. Ideally, the coordinates of each position should be measured on the grid for the zone in which they are located, but because the scale factor is still relatively small near zone boundaries, it is possible to overlap measurements into an adjoining zone for some distance when necessary.|$|E

The purpose of the fort was to watch over the activities of Chief Spotted Tail's band of about 4,000 Upper Brulé Lakota who were at the Rosebud Agency. [...] The Fort was located off the reservation to avoid friction with the Sioux, and to provide protection and security for the apprehensive settlers in the north central portion of Nebraska, which was immediately adjacent to the southern boundary of the Sioux Reservation.|$|E

50|$|Upon {{receiving}} {{news of the}} damage, several {{community groups}} across Australia began fundraising and relief efforts to assist the survivors. Major reception centres were set up {{in cities such as}} Katherine, Tennant Creek and Alice Springs. Several of the small towns along the Stuart Highway made efforts to assist people who were fleeing by road, supplying them with food, fuel, rest and mechanical aid. At Adelaide River, the small local population provided hot meals to the refugees who stopped there. Approximately twenty-four hours after the storm hit Darwin, the population of Alice Springs had raised over $105,000 to assist the victims of Tracy. In Melbourne at the Boxing Day Test cricket match between Australia and England, members of both teams moved <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>boundaries</b> carrying buckets which the crowd threw cash into for the relief funds. Darwin families were also given priority on public housing waiting lists. On 31 December 1974, Stretton recommended that full civilian control should resume in Darwin, and handed over control of the city to its elected officials.|$|E
