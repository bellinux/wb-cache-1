25|$|On October 21, 2010, Hines-Archstone said {{it would}} break ground on April 4, 2011. Instead of {{constructing}} buildings one at a time, the Hines-led group said that the <b>apartment,</b> <b>condominium,</b> and office buildings would be built at the same time. The northern parcel (containing the large-format retailer and 400-room hotel) would be built later. Clark Construction Group and the Sherman R. Smoot Co., large construction companies located in D.C., formed a joint venture named Clark/Smoot to provide construction services to the development. Clark/Smoot began soliciting bids for subcontractors on October 10, 2010, and said they would close this process by February or March 2011. Financing and development needs were drawing new participants in the project as well. The Washington Business Journal said that Triden Development Group and The Mayhood Co. had both become partners in the development. The cost {{of the project was}} now pegged at $950 million.|$|E
2500|$|On December 17, 2007, D.C. Mayor Adrian Fenty (who {{was elected}} in November 2006 and took office in January 2007), and the Hines-led {{development}} group signed a final $850 million agreement giving Hines-Archstone final control over the old convention center site. Hines-Archstone leased the land beneath the office and apartment buildings for $500,000 a year for 99 years, but purchased the land beneath the condominiums. Retail space in the final agreement was set at [...] and office space at [...] (both unchanged from April 2007), although now housing units numbered 760 (up from 665 in April). The lease agreement required that 30 percent of the retail space be set aside for businesses with fewer than six locations nationwide. The developers committed to spending about $55 million to make 134 (17.6 percent) of the housing units affordable to people with low incomes, $48 million to make improvements to infrastructure (water, sewer, electricity, streets), $14 million to provide entertainment in the development's public spaces, and $55 million for miscellaneous improvements. The city would receive about $28.5 million annually in rent, as well as 25 percent of all profits above certain specified levels. The city remained undecided {{about what to do}} with its [...] parcel, while Hines-Archstone said they would build a big-box store on the parcel if it became available. City officials said they hoped to solicit proposals for their parcel in spring 2008. Hines-Archstone said construction would begin on the <b>apartment,</b> <b>condominium,</b> and office buildings in January 2009, with the first buildings ready for occupany in 2011. The project still had no official name, but both Fenty and Hines-Archstone officials used the term [...] "city center".|$|E

50|$|In a townhouse complex, {{multiple}} physical {{houses are}} combined into a single architectural building. Each unit owner owns an identified plot of land and the building affixed to it, but that building is physically {{part of a larger}} building that spans lots. There is a continuous roof and foundation and a single wall divides adjacent townhouses. If there is an apartment below not owned by owner of townhouse it is not a townhouse just a bi-level <b>apartment,</b> <b>condominium.</b> Legally, this is very similar to detached houses, but because of the intertwining of interests in the single architectural building, a homeowner's association is required. It would be impractical, for example to replace the roof of just one townhouse. But unlike the condominium, the townhouse complex's HOA owns none of the building or the land under it. It is essentially under contract to the townhouse owners to maintain the parts of the building that are hard to divide. Even the walls between townhouses are usually outside the purview of the HOA, being jointly owned and maintained by the owners of the townhouses on either side. Like the condominium, the townhouse complex often has common areas for roads, parking, clubhouses, and such.|$|E
