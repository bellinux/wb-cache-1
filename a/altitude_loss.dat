2500|$|The {{cause was}} {{determined}} to be vortex ring state (VRS), a fundamental limitation on vertical descent which is common to helicopters. At the time of the mishap, the V-22's flight operations rules restricted the Osprey to a descent rate of [...] at airspeeds below [...] (restrictions typical of helicopters); the crew of the V-22 in question exceeded this operating restriction with a rate more than 100% greater. [...] Another factor that may have triggered VRS was their operating in close proximity, which is believed to be a risk factor for VRS in helicopters. [...] Subsequent testing has shown that the V-22, and the tiltrotor in general, is less susceptible to VRS, the conditions are easily recognized by the pilots; recovery from VRS requires a more natural action by the pilot than recovery in helicopters, the <b>altitude</b> <b>loss</b> is significantly less than for helicopters, and, with sufficient altitude ( [...] or more), VRS recovery is relatively easy.|$|E

40|$|Several {{methods of}} {{predicting}} the compressible-flow pressure loss across a baffled aircraft-engine cylinder were analytically related and were experimentally investigated {{on a typical}} air-cooled aircraft-engine cylinder.

Both the analysis and the test results showed that the method "based on tho density determined by the static pressure and the stag-nation temperature at the baffle uxit gave results comparable with those obtained from methods derived by one-dimensional flow theory. The method based on a characteristic Mach number, although related analytically to one-dimensional flow theory, was found impractical In the present tests because of the difficulty encountered in defining tho proper characteristic state of the cooling air.

40|$|Mars {{has lost}} a {{significant}} fraction of its initial water inventory to space over its history. This loss proceeds via a chemical chain initiated in the lower and middle atmosphere below 100 km altitude, which results in H escape to space in the collisionless corona above about 200 km <b>altitude.</b> Hydrogen <b>loss</b> from Mars is tracked via brigtness measurements of this corona in Lyman alpha light at 121. 6 nm, which is scattered by neutral H orbiting and escaping the planet. Here we present observations of H escape variability made by the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) mission's Imaging Ultraviolet Spectrograph (IUVS) that demonstrate the seasonal dependence of H escape, adding to evidence initially gathered by Mars Express and the Hubble Space Telescope. We show that for two Mars years the atmosphere has exhibited enhanced H escape in Southern Summer near perihelion. We also present the result of photochemical model calculations which demonstrate that this variation can be explained {{as a result of}} high concentrations of water vapor in the upper atmosphere, consistent with Mars Express solar occultation measurements and several general circulation models. Our results demonstrate that the large variations in H escape at high altitudes can be driven by lower atmospheric dynamics, suggesting that Mars hydrogen escape may depend on climate, in addition to the long-term evolution of Martian climate depending on atmospheric escape...|$|R
5000|$|Investigators also {{scrutinized}} the Practical Test Standards (PTS) for ATP certification, {{which allowed}} for an <b>altitude</b> <b>loss</b> {{of no more}} than 100 feet (30 m) in a simulated stall. The NTSB theorized that due to this low tolerance in a tested simulation environment, pilots may have come to fear loss of altitude in a stall and thus focused primarily on preventing such a loss, even to the detriment of recovering from the stall itself. New standards subsequently issued by the FAA eliminate any specific <b>altitude</b> <b>loss</b> stipulation, calling instead for [...] "minimal loss of elevation" [...] in a stall. One examiner has told an aviation magazine that he is not allowed to fail any applicant for losing altitude in a simulated stall, so long as the pilot is able to regain the original altitude.|$|E

50|$|Chambers {{pulls back}} on the yoke in a banking left turn, but an engine clips the derrick and catches fire.

As the engine reignites, Chambers is forced to use another fire suppression bottle. But by this time, the aircraft stall alarm is activated and the aircraft's tail hits the water. All the passengers wake up, and realizing what is happening, most panic. Chambers is able to pull up, but the plane's right wing hits the water again. The plane lifts into the air for a moment, then hits the water. Because of the hard impact, the plane becomes grounded in the ocean and begins to sink.|$|R
30|$|A hybrid {{particle}} code {{has been}} used to examine how Titan’s interaction with Saturn’s magnetosphere is effected by the orientation of the dayside ionosphere with respect to the incident magnetospheric flow.

Emphasis is placed on what effects the orientation angle has on the ion loss rates, ion densities, and the electric and magnetic fields. The results are analyzed and regardless of the orientation angle the ionosphere is found to be within photochemical equilibrium below 1200 km <b>altitude.</b> The ion <b>loss</b> rates and field structures also show little dependence on the orientation of the dayside ionosphere.

40|$|The diurnal {{variations}} of electron content and shape factor observed at an equatorial station during sunspot minimum are {{shown to be}} consistent with the electron density profiles observed at Jicamarca during sunspot minimum. The rapid increase in electron content and the shape factor at sunrise results from the EUV production of ionization in the E and F regions. Day-to-day variations in daytime electron content are observed to be quite small at the equator. The evening decrease in the shape factor results from an upward drift of the F region at sunset and the evening decay of the E and bottomside F regions. The nighttime peak or plateau in the shape factor is produced by the slow downward drift of the electron density profile. The deep predawn dip in the shape factor is caused by the main peak of the F layer reaching low <b>altitudes</b> where high <b>loss</b> rates cause a large reduction in ionization below 300 km and very flat electron density profile...|$|R
30|$|There {{are several}} caveats and {{assumptions}} {{to keep in}} mind when considering these results. The electron transport model used in these calculations does not include gradients in the magnetic field. Magnetic field lines are assumed to be straight with a constant dip angle and magnitude. At Mars, where the scale length of changes in the magnetic field can be relatively small, this is a poor assumption. We try to minimize the impact of this assumption by choosing a dip angle of the magnetic field that matches the dip angle given by the crustal magnetic field model of Cain et al. (2003) near 150 km, the altitude of greatest ionization. As recently shown by Lillis et al. (2009), strong magnetic gradients can reflect {{a significant portion of the}} downward-travelling electrons and can greatly affect the ionization profile. However, if the down-going spectrum is isotropic, the electron flux remains approximately constant with <b>altitude</b> because <b>loss</b> of electrons by magnetic reflection is balanced by the decrease in area of the flux tube through which the electrons travel; only the area upon which the electrons precipitate will decrease. (However, Lillis et al. (2009) showed that, by including altitude dependent scattering effect of the atmosphere, magnetic gradients can also impact the ionization profile due to isotropic distrubutions changing the peak ionization rate by ~ 20 % between the zero crustal field case and the strongest crustal field gradient they considered.) Brain et al. (2006) showed that throughout most of the interval shown in the top panel of Fig. 1 electron pitch angles observed by MGS were approximately isotropic, so the effects of neglecting magnetic gradients should be minimal.|$|R

50|$|Starting from level flight, {{the pilot}} pitches the {{aircraft}} up about 10 to 30 degrees above the horizon, into a brief climb. The purpose of pitch-up is twofold. This causes {{an increase in}} altitude which minimizes <b>altitude</b> <b>loss</b> and airspeed gain. As the aircraft begins to roll, it starts to lose lift. When the wings are vertical, the only lift generated is a small amount from the fuselage, and the aircraft will begin to lose altitude. The brief climb compensates for the loss, allowing the aircraft to complete the roll at the same altitude the maneuver began. When the aircraft is completely inverted, the increased pitch results in greater angle of attack, enabling the inverted wing to generate lift.|$|E

Transpulmonary plasma ET- 1 and nitrite {{differences}} in high altitude pulmonary hypertension. High Alt. Med. Biol. 10 : 17 - 24, 2009. - Thirty-four mountaineers were studied at low (110 m) and high altitude (4559 m) to evaluate if increased pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) at high altitude {{is associated with}} increased pulmonary endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) availability and alterations in nitrite metabolism across the lung. Blood samples were obtained using central venous and radial artery catheters for plasma ET- 1 and nitrite. Pulmonary blood flow was measured by inert gas rebreathing to calculate transpulmonary exchange of plasma ET- 1 and nitrite, and PASP was assessed by transthoracic Doppler echocardiography. After ascent to high altitude, PASP increased from 23 +/- 4 to 39 +/- 10 mmHg. Arterial and central venous plasma ET- 1 increased, while plasma nitrite did not change significantly. At low altitude there was a transpulmonary loss of plasma ET- 1, but a transpulmonary gain at high altitude. In contrast was a transpulmonary gain of plasma nitrite at low altitude and a transpulmonary <b>loss</b> at high <b>altitude.</b> PASP positively correlated with a transpulmonary gain of plasma ET- 1 and negatively correlated with a transpulmonary loss of plasma nitrite.
