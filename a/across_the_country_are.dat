2500|$|Russell Barkley {{believes}} labeling is {{a double-edged}} sword; {{there are many}} pitfalls to labeling but by using a precise label, services can be accessed.

Furthermore studies also show that the education of the siblings and parents has at least a short-term impact on the outcome of treatment. Barkley states this about ADHD rights: [...] "... because of various legislation that has been passed to protect them. There are special education laws with the Americans with Disabilities Act, for example, mentioning ADHD as an eligible condition. If you change the label, and again refer to it as just some variation in normal temperament, these people will lose access to these services, and will lose these hard-won protections that keep them from being discriminated against. ..." [...] Psychiatrist Harvey Parker, who founded CHADD, states, [...] "we should be celebrating the fact that school districts <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>are</b> beginning to understand and recognize kids with ADHD, and are finding ways of treating them. We should celebrate the fact that the general public doesn't look at ADHD kids as [...] "bad" [...] kids, as brats, but as kids who have a problem that they can overcome".
