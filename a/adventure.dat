5|$|A {{sequel to}} <b>Adventure</b> was first {{announced}} in early 1982. The planned sequel eventually {{evolved into the}} Swordquest series of games. In 2005, a sequel written by Curt Vendel was released by Atari on the Atari Flashback 2 system. In 2007, AtariAge released a self-published sequel called <b>Adventure</b> II for the Atari 5200, which is heavily inspired by the original; its name is used with permission from Atari Interactive. Robinett himself took {{the idea of using}} items from <b>Adventure</b> into his next game, Rocky's Boots, but added the ability to combine them to form new items.|$|E
5|$|<b>Adventure</b> was {{conceived}} as a graphical version of the 1977 text <b>adventure</b> Colossal Cave <b>Adventure.</b> It took developer Warren Robinett approximately one year to design and code the game, during which time he had to overcome a variety of technical limitations in the Atari 2600 console hardware, as well as difficulties with management within Atari. In this game, he introduced the first widely known video game Easter egg, a secret room containing text crediting himself for the game's creation. Robinett's Easter egg became a tradition for future Atari 2600 titles.|$|E

5|$|Initially, Gilbert and Winnick {{struggled}} {{to choose a}} gameplay genre for Maniac Mansion. While visiting relatives over Christmas, Gilbert saw his cousin play , an <b>adventure</b> game by Sierra On-Line. Although he was a fan of text adventures, this was Gilbert's first experience with a graphic <b>adventure,</b> and he used the holiday {{to play the game}} and familiarize himself with the format. As a result, he decided to develop his and Winnick's ideas into a graphic <b>adventure</b> game.|$|E

5|$|Labyrinth was {{the first}} <b>adventure</b> game created by Lucasfilm. The project was led by {{designer}} David Fox, who invented its word wheels to avoid the text parsers and syntax guessing typical of text-based <b>adventure</b> games. Early in development, the team collaborated with author Douglas Adams in a week-long series of brainstorming sessions, which inspired much of the final product. Labyrinth received positive reviews and, in the United States, was a bigger commercial success than the film upon which it was based. Its design influenced Lucasfilm's subsequent <b>adventure</b> title, the critically acclaimed Maniac Mansion.|$|E

5|$|Released nearly 8 {{months after}} the first two Zelda CD-i games, Zelda's <b>Adventure</b> was created by a {{different}} third-party developer, Viridis. The game again follows a nontraditional Zelda-saves-Link plotline, but it uses a different game engine than Faces of Evil and Wand of Gamelon. Whereas the first two CD-i games were patterned on the side-scrolling Zelda II: The <b>Adventure</b> of Link, Zelda's <b>Adventure</b> took the top-down The Legend of Zelda as its model. Zelda's <b>Adventure</b> featured FMV cutscenes, but rather than using drawn animation, the game used live-action scenes. Reception for the game was poor, and whereas some modern critics have given more nuanced reviews {{of the first two}} games, modern criticism for Zelda's <b>Adventure</b> is unanimously negative.|$|E
