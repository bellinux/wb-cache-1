5|$|The castle's {{original}} appearance {{differed significantly}} {{from that of}} today. The arrow-shaped Water Bastion facing into the Medway and the main block behind it {{were part of the}} original design. There were also towers {{at either end of the}} water frontage, though these were subsequently replaced by towers of a different design. The gatehouse and moat were later additions. A number of derelict buildings in Rochester Castle, Aylesford, and Bopley were pulled down to provide stone for the castle. The main structure had been completed by 1564, but it took another three years and <b>an</b> <b>infusion</b> <b>of</b> extra funds to finish the project. The total cost came to £4,349.|$|E
5|$|The Māori used {{various parts}} of Cordyline australis to treat {{injuries}} and illnesses, either boiled up into a drink or pounded into a paste. The kōata, the growing tip of the plant, was eaten raw as a blood tonic or cleanser. Juice from the leaves was used for cuts, cracks and sores. <b>An</b> <b>infusion</b> <b>of</b> the leaves was taken internally for diarrhoea and used externally for bathing cuts. The leaves were rubbed until soft and applied either directly or as an ointment to cuts, skin cracks and cracked or sore hands. The young shoot was eaten by nursing mothers and given to children for colic. The liquid from boiled shoots was taken for other stomach pains. The seeds of Cordyline australis are high in linoleic acid, one of the essential fatty acids.|$|E

5|$|By {{the spring}} of 1794, the French Republic, {{under the rule of}} the National Convention, was at war with all its neighbours. With famine imminent, the French Committee of Public Safety looked to France's colonies and the United States to provide <b>an</b> <b>infusion</b> <b>of</b> grain; this was to be convoyed across the Atlantic during April, May and June, {{accompanied}} by a small escort squadron and supported by a second, larger squadron in the Bay of Biscay. However, political upheaval had severely reduced the French Navy's ability to fight coherently and supply shortages had devastated its morale, significantly weakening the fleet. Britain, by contrast, was at a high state of readiness with a well-organised command structure, but was suffering from a severe shortage of trained seamen with which to man its large navy. The French Atlantic Fleet, under Admiral Villaret de Joyeuse, was tasked with keeping the British Channel Fleet occupied long enough for the convoy to reach France safely. The Channel Fleet, commanded by Lord Howe, knew of the convoy's passage, and dispatched squadrons to protect British commerce while pursuing Villaret himself with {{the main body of the}} Royal Navy's Channel Fleet. For over a week the two battlefleets manoeuvred around one another, Villaret drawing Howe deeper westwards into the Atlantic and away from the convoy. Two partial but inconclusive fleet actions on 28 and 29 May followed, during which Howe seized the weather gage from Villaret, granting him freedom to choose the time and place of his next attack.|$|E

Anesthesia {{throughout the}} surgical procedure was maintained with sevoflurane and fentanyl after <b>a</b> bolus <b>infusion</b> <b>of</b> propofol and rocuronium.

Anesthesia was titrated subsequently to a bispectral index of ≈ 50. Continuous intravenous <b>infusion</b> <b>of</b> Ringer’s acetate solution was started in the operating room. <b>A</b> maintenance <b>infusion</b> was administered with 8  mL/kg/h Ringer’s acetate solution {{from the start of}} anesthesia until blood samples had been obtained. In addition, infusion for blood loss was administered with one to two volumes of 6 % hydroxyethyl starch (70 / 0.5). Pharmacokinetic simulations were not used to guide anesthesia: they were carried out after the cases had been completed.|$|R

40|$|Progressive muscular {{dystrophy}} may produce abnormal reactions to several drugs. There {{is no consensus}} of opinion regarding the continuous <b>infusion</b> <b>of</b> propofol in patients with progressive {{muscular dystrophy}}. We successfully treated 2 patients with progressive muscular dystrophy who were anesthetized with <b>a</b> continuous <b>infusion</b> <b>of</b> propofol. In case 1, a 19 -year-old, 59 -kg man with Becker muscular dystrophy and mental retardation was scheduled for dental treatment under general anesthesia. General anesthesia was maintained by <b>a</b> continuous <b>infusion</b> <b>of</b> 6 – 10 mg/kg propofol per hour and an inhalational mixture of 67 % nitrous oxide and 33 % oxygen. No complications were observed during or after the operation. In case 2, a 5 -year-old, 11 -kg boy with Fukuyama type congenital muscular dystrophy and slight mental retardation was scheduled for dental treatment under general anesthesia. General anesthesia was maintained with <b>a</b> continuous <b>infusion</b> <b>of</b> 6 – 12 mg/kg propofol per hour and an inhalational mixture of 0. 5 – 1. 5 % sevoflurane in 67 % nitrous oxide and 33 % oxygen. No complications were observed during or after the operation. It is speculated that <b>a</b> continuous <b>infusion</b> <b>of</b> propofol in progressive muscular dystrophy does not cause malignant hyperthermia because serum levels of creatine phosphokinase and myoglobin decreased after our anesthetic management. Furthermore, our observations suggest that sevoflurane may have some advantages in patients with progressive type muscular dystrophies other than Duchenne muscular dystrophy and Becker muscular dystrophy. In conclusion, our cases suggest that <b>a</b> continuous <b>infusion</b> <b>of</b> propofol for the patients with progressive muscular dystrophy is a safe component of our anesthetic strategy...|$|R
