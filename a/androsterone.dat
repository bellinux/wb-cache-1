5|$|Sterol lipids, such as {{cholesterol}} and its derivatives, {{are an important}} component of membrane lipids, along with the glycerophospholipids and sphingomyelins. The steroids, all derived from the same fused four-ring core structure, have different biological roles as hormones and signaling molecules. The eighteen-carbon (C18) steroids include the estrogen family whereas the C19 steroids comprise the androgens such as testosterone and <b>androsterone.</b> The C21 subclass includes the progestogens as well as the glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids. The secosteroids, comprising various forms of vitamin D, are characterized by cleavage of the B ring of the core structure. Other examples of sterols are the bile acids and their conjugates, which in mammals are oxidized derivatives of {{cholesterol and}} are synthesized in the liver. The plant equivalents are the phytosterols, such as β-sitosterol, stigmasterol, and brassicasterol; the latter compound is also used as a biomarker for algal growth. The predominant sterol in fungal cell membranes is ergosterol.|$|E
25|$|Both {{testosterone}} and 5α-DHT are metabolized {{mainly in}} the liver. Approximately 50% of testosterone is metabolized via conjugation into testosterone glucuronide {{and to a lesser}} extent testosterone sulfate by glucuronosyltransferases and sulfotransferases, respectively. An additional 40% of testosterone is metabolized in equal proportions into the 17-ketosteroids <b>androsterone</b> and etiocholanolone via the combined actions of 5α- and 5β-reductases, 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, and 17β-HSD, in that order. <b>Androsterone</b> and etiocholanolone are then glucuronidated {{and to a lesser extent}} sulfated similarly to testosterone. The conjugates of testosterone and its hepatic metabolites are released from the liver into circulation and excreted in the urine and bile. Only a small fraction (2%) of testosterone is excreted unchanged in the urine.|$|E
25|$|DHT is inactivated in {{the liver}} and extrahepatic tissues like the skin into 3α-androstanediol and 3β-androstanediol by the enzymes 3α-hydroxysteroid {{dehydrogenase}} and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, respectively. These metabolites are in turn converted, respectively, into <b>androsterone</b> and epiandrosterone, then conjugated (via glucuronidation and/or sulfation), released into circulation, and excreted in urine.|$|E
25|$|In the hepatic 17-ketosteroid pathway of {{testosterone}} metabolism, testosterone is converted {{in the liver}} by 5α-reductase and 5β-reductase into 5α-DHT and the inactive 5β-DHT, respectively. Then, 5α-DHT and 5β-DHT are converted by 3α-HSD into 3α,5α-androstanediol and 3α,5β-androstanediol, respectively. Subsequently, 3α,5α-androstanediol and 3α,5β-androstanediol are converted by 17β-HSD into <b>androsterone</b> and etiocholanolone, which is followed by their conjugation and excretion. 3β,5α-Androstanediol and 3β,5β-androstanediol can also be formed in this pathway when 5α-DHT and 5β-DHT are acted upon by 3β-HSD instead of 3α-HSD, respectively, and they can then be transformed into epiandrosterone and epietiocholanolone, respectively. A small portion of approximately 3% {{of testosterone}} is reversibly converted in the liver into androstenedione by 17β-HSD.|$|E
25|$|The {{event was}} seen as a key step towards {{preparing}} China's athletes for the 2008 Summer Olympics. Xing Huina completed a double in the women's 5000 metres and 10,000 metres and would have had a third in the 1500 metres but she was disqualified for elbowing Liu Qing (who herself completed a double having won the 800 metres). The top two from the women's marathon – Sun Yingjie and Zhou Chunxiu – flew in from Beijing the day before the 10,000m but still managed second and third place, respectively. The result did not stand, however, as Sun failed a drugs test for <b>androsterone.</b> Her test at the Beijing Marathon the previous day was negative but, in spite of a civil court ruling a rival athlete had spiked her drink, she was disqualified and banned for two years.|$|E

2500|$|On July 24, 2014, it was {{announced}} that Diaz had signed a three-fight contract to return to the UFC. Diaz faced Anderson Silva on January 31, 2015 at UFC 183. He lost the fight by unanimous decision (46–49, 45–50, and 45–50). [...] A few days after the fight, the UFC revealed that Diaz had once again failed his post-fight drug test for marijuana metabolites, and Silva tested positive on January 9 for drostanolone, androstane, oxazepem, and temazepem in pre-fight drug screening. On August 13, after several reschedules, Silva's disciplinary hearing was held to decide on the subject. Silva's defense argued that a tainted sexual enhancement supplement was the root of the two failed tests for drostanolone and also appealed to mistakes in the NSAC testing procedures, pointing to a pair of drug tests, one on Jan 19 and one after the fight, which Silva passed. He admitted to using both temazepem and oxazepem, benzodiazepines, the night prior to the fight as therapy to control stress and help him sleep. Silva's team was unable to explain the presence of <b>androsterone</b> in the Jan 9 test. The commission rejected the defense and suspended him for one year retroactive to the date of the fight, as the current guidelines were not in effect {{at the time of the}} failed tests. Silva was also fined his full win bonus, as well as 30% of his show money, totaling $380,000. The result was overturned to a no contest.|$|E
