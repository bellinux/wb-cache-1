Although the first images appeared to be sharper than those of ground-based telescopes, Hubble failed to achieve a final sharp focus and the best image quality obtained was drastically lower than expected. Images of point sources spread out over a radius of more than one <b>arcsecond,</b> instead of having a point spread function (PSF) concentrated within a circle 0.1arcsec in diameter as had been specified in the design criteria.|$|E
5|$|The Milky Way has a {{relatively}} low surface brightness. Its visibility can be greatly reduced by background light such as light pollution or stray light from the Moon. The sky needs to be darker than about 20.2 magnitude per square <b>arcsecond</b> {{in order for the}} Milky Way to be seen. It should be visible when the limiting magnitude is approximately +5.1 or better and shows a great deal of detail at +6.1. This makes the Milky Way difficult to see from any brightly lit urban or suburban location, but very prominent when viewed from a rural area when the Moon is below the horizon. The new world atlas of artificial night sky brightness shows that more than one-third of Earth's population cannot see the Milky Way from their homes due to light pollution.|$|E
5|$|Beta, Delta and Kappa are {{multiple}} star systems containing six, two and four stars respectively. Located near {{the tail of}} the toucan, Beta Tucanae's two brightest components, Beta1 and Beta2 are separated by an angle of 27 arcseconds and have apparent magnitudes of 4.4 and 4.5 respectively. They can be separated in small telescopes. A third star, Beta3 Tucanae, is separated by 10 arcminutes from the two, and able {{to be seen as a}} separate star with the unaided eye. Each star is itself a binary star, making six in total. Lying in the southwestern corner of the constellation around 251 light-years away from Earth, Delta Tucanae consists of a blue-white primary contrasting with a yellowish companion. Delta Tucanae A is a main sequence star of spectral type B9.5V and an apparent magnitude of 4.49. The companion has an apparent magnitude of 9.3. The Kappa Tucanae system shines with a combined apparent magnitude of 4.25, and is located around 68 light-years from the Solar System. The brighter component is a yellowish star, known as Kappa Tucanae A with an apparent magnitude of 5.33 and spectral type F6V, while the fainter lies 5 arcseconds to the northwest. Known as Kappa Tucanae B, it has an apparent magnitude of 7.58 and spectral type K1V. Five arcminutes to the northwest is a fainter star of apparent magnitude 7.24 —actually a pair of orange main sequence stars of spectral types K2V and K3V, which can be seen individually as stars one <b>arcsecond</b> apart with a telescope such as a Dobsonian with high power.|$|E

25|$|The {{amount of}} airglow and zodiacal light is quite {{variable}} (depending, amongst {{other things on}} sunspot activity and the Solar cycle) but given optimal conditions the darkest possible sky has a brightness of about 22 magnitude/square <b>arcsecond.</b> If a full moon is present, the sky brightness increases to about 18 magnitude/sq. <b>arcsecond</b> depending on local atmospheric transparency, 40 times brighter than the darkest sky. In densely populated areas a sky brightness of 17 magnitude/sq. <b>arcsecond</b> is not uncommon, or as much as 100 times brighter than is natural.|$|E
25|$|The first {{demonstration}} that R136a {{was a star}} cluster was provided by Weigelt and Beier in 1985. Using the speckle interferometry technique, R136a was shown to {{be made up of}} 8 stars within 1 <b>arcsecond</b> at the centre of the cluster, with R136a1 being the brightest.|$|E

25|$|Newton's Theory {{does not}} fully explain the {{precession}} of the perihelion of the orbits of the planets, especially of planet Mercury, which was detected long after the life of Newton.

25|$|The International Celestial Reference System (ICRS) {{is based}} on {{hundreds}} of extra-galactic radio sources, mostly quasars, distributed around the entire sky. Because they are so distant, they are apparently stationary to our current technology, yet their positions can be measured with the utmost accuracy by Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI). The positions of most are known to 0.001 <b>arcsecond</b> or better, which is orders of magnitude more precise than the best optical measurements.|$|E
25|$|The parsec {{is defined}} as being equal {{to the length of}} the longer leg of an {{extremely}} elongated imaginary right triangle in space. The two dimensions on which this triangle is based are its shorter leg, of length one astronomical unit (the average Earth-Sun distance), and the subtended angle of the vertex opposite that leg, measuring one <b>arcsecond.</b> Applying the rules of trigonometry to these two values, the unit length of the other leg of the triangle (the parsec) can be derived.|$|E
50|$|The {{perihelion}} precession of Mercury is 5,600 <b>arcseconds</b> (1.5556°) per century {{relative to}} Earth, or 574.10±0.65 <b>arcseconds</b> per century {{relative to the}} inertial ICRF. Newtonian mechanics, taking into account all the effects from the other planets, predicts a precession of 5,557 <b>arcseconds</b> (1.5436°) per century. In the early 20th century, Albert Einstein's {{general theory of relativity}} provided the explanation for the observed precession. The effect is small: just 42.98 <b>arcseconds</b> per century for Mercury; it therefore requires a little over twelve million orbits for a full excess turn. Similar, but much smaller, effects exist for other Solar System bodies: 8.62 <b>arcseconds</b> per century for Venus, 3.84 for Earth, 1.35 for Mars, and 10.05 for 1566 Icarus.|$|R
50|$|There are two visual companions, Iota Serpentis C, a 13th {{magnitude}} star 143 <b>arcseconds</b> {{away and}} Iota Serpentis D, a 12th magnitude star 151 <b>arcseconds</b> distant.|$|R

25|$|The {{use of the}} parsec as a unit of {{distance}} follows naturally from Bessel's method, because the distance in parsecs can be computed simply as the reciprocal of the parallax angle in arcseconds (i.e. if the parallax angle is 1 <b>arcsecond,</b> the object is 1pc from the Sun; if the parallax angle is 0.5 arcseconds, the object is 2pc away; etc.). No trigonometric functions are required in this relationship because the very small angles involved mean that the approximate solution of the skinny triangle can be applied.|$|E
25|$|The parsec {{unit was}} likely first {{suggested}} in 1913 by the British astronomer Herbert Hall Turner. Named as a portmanteau of the parallax of one <b>arcsecond,</b> it was defined {{so as to}} make calculations of astronomical distances quick and easy for astronomers from only their raw observational data. Partly for this reason, it is still the unit preferred in astronomy and astrophysics, though the light-year remains prominent in popular science texts and common usage. Although parsecs are used for the shorter distances within the Milky Way, multiples of parsecs are required for the larger scales in the universe, including kiloparsecs (kpc) for the more distant objects within and around the Milky Way, megaparsecs (Mpc) for all but the closest galaxies, and gigaparsecs (Gpc) for many quasars and the most distant galaxies.|$|E
25|$|The {{parallax}} {{of a star}} {{is defined}} as half of the angular distance that a star appears to move relative to the celestial sphere as Earth orbits the Sun. Equivalently, it is the subtended angle, from that star's perspective, of the semimajor axis of the Earth's orbit. The star, the Sun and the Earth form the corners of an imaginary right triangle in space: the right angle is the corner at the Sun, and the corner at the star is the parallax angle. The length of the opposite side to the parallax angle is {{the distance from the}} Earth to the Sun (defined as one astronomical unit (au), and the length of the adjacent side gives the distance from the sun to the star. Therefore, given a measurement of the parallax angle, along with the rules of trigonometry, the distance from the Sun to the star can be found. A parsec is defined as the length of the side adjacent to the vertex occupied by a star whose parallax angle is one <b>arcsecond.</b>|$|E

500|$|Lowell's first search {{focused on}} the ecliptic, the plane {{encompassed}} by the zodiac where the other planets in the Solar System lie. Using a 5-inch photographic camera, he manually examined over 200 three-hour exposures with a magnifying glass, and found no planets. At that time Pluto was too far above the ecliptic to be imaged by the survey. [...] After revising his predicted possible locations, Lowell conducted a second search from 1914 to 1916. In 1915, he published his Memoir of a Trans-Neptunian Planet, in which he concluded that PlanetX had a mass roughly seven times that of Earth—about half that of Neptune—and a mean distance from the Sun of 43AU. He assumed PlanetX would be a large, low-density object with a high albedo, like the giant planets.
