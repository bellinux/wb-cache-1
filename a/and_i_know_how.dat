500|$|In {{the early}} months of 1950 Chance of a Lifetime was {{released}} into British cinemas; it was a film in which Jacques [...] "really made her mark", according to her biographer, Andy Merriman. Chance of a Lifetime is a social and industrial relations drama based in a plough factory whose manager cedes control to the workforce. Jacques played Alice, a welder: when she was offered her fee for 17 days filming, she replied [...] "I've done this job welding Bailey and Pontoon Bridges <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> hard it is. That's not enough money!" [...] and the offer was raised accordingly. The film critic Geoff Mayer considered that Jacques had [...] "the best scene in the film with her mock seductive dance in front of an angry [...] MacGinnis".|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of March 29, 1825, a firing squad was {{assembled}} {{to carry out the}} sentence handed down to the pirates. The public execution, which had a large number of spectators, was supervised by the Regimiento de Infantería de Granada between eight and nine a.m. Catholic priests were present to hear confessions and offer comfort. As the pirates prayed, they were shot before the silent crowd. Although San Felipe del Morro is the accepted execution site, Alejandro Tapia y Rivera (whose father {{was a member of the}} Regimiento de Granada) places their execution near Convento Dominico in the Baluarte de Santo Domingo (part of present-day Old San Juan). According to historian Enrique Ramírez Brau, in a final act of defiance Cofresí refused to have his eyes covered after he was tied to a chair and he was blindfolded by soldiers. Richard Wheeler said that the pirate said that after killing three or four hundred people, it would be strange if he was not accustomed to death. Cofresí's last words were reportedly, [...] "I have killed hundreds with my own hands, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> to die. Fire!" ...|$|E
500|$|Before any {{director}} {{was attached to}} Hard Target, Universal Pictures saw the film as a potential vehicle for actor Jean-Claude Van Damme. Van Damme had already been {{a huge fan of}} Woo's films and arranged to meet with him in Hong Kong where the two got along despite both Woo and Van Damme's difficulty with their English. Woo originally wanted actor Kurt Russell for the lead role, but found Russell to be booked for two years with other film projects. On working with Van Damme, Woo stated that he was [...] "sure of [...] abilities <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> to make an actor look good on screen, make him look like a hero. I thought I could do the same for Van Damme". Despite early misgivings of working with Van Damme, Woo changed many action scenes in the film to make them more spectacular on finding that Van Damme was up for it. While working with Van Damme, Woo stated that Van Damme had [...] "a pretty big ego, but he's still professional and always tries to do a good job." [...] Woo had some control over the film's casting including casting minor characters and finding a cinematographer. Actress Yancy Butler was cast as Natasha Binder in her feature film debut. The role led Butler to other starring roles in action films such as Drop Zone [...] and Fast Money. Actor Lance Henriksen accepted the role of Emil Fouchon stating he was a great fan of Woo, noting that his earlier films [...] "were so creative, so balletic, and had this incredible philosophy in them. The violence was only a container for the philosophy".|$|E

[...] The actor also opined that Silas's family would be [...] "ripped asunder" [...] after finding out that he is a killer. Marquess first mentioned the storyline's climax in January 2011. He told Digital Spy [...] "I know what the ending of the serial killer story will be, when it is, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> brilliant it is. I'm hoping that story will have the audience jumping up and down and shouting at the telly, because it's got a really big 'look behind you' element to it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 1990, in {{the midst}} of the presidential election, FitzGerald was to be a guest, {{alongside}} Lenihan, on RTÉ One's Questions and Answers political debate programme. He has previously issued a press release about the phone calls issue, but it had received no publicity. He decided to raise the issue of the calls again on the programme, given that in the preceding week Lenihan changed his story of eight years and had now denied twice, first in a student debate, then in an Irish Press interview with Emily O'Reilly, making any calls. When challenged on the programme Lenihan maintained that his October 1990 version was correct, denying that he had played [...] "any hand, act of part" [...] in attempts to pressurise President Hillery. FitzGerald had been in Áras an Uachtaráin on the night of the calls and had been told by the President's staff that Lenihan had persistently been making calls. FitzGerald aggressively challenged Lenihan, saying [...] "I was in the Áras, Brian, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> many calls there were." ...|$|E
