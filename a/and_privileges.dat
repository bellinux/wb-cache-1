5|$|Henry le Despenser {{continued}} to be controversial after his fighting career was over, {{mainly because of the}} vigorous methods he used to maintain control over the laity in his diocese and his own cathedral church. He defended the orthodoxy of the church against Lollardy as passionately as he defended his episcopal rights <b>and</b> <b>privileges.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Peasants' Revolt was a {{rebellion}} against Egyptian conscription and taxation policies in Palestine. It was a collective {{reaction to the}} gradual elimination of the unofficial rights <b>and</b> <b>privileges</b> previously enjoyed by the various societal groups in the region under Ottoman rule. While the local peasantry constituted {{the bulk of the}} rebel forces, urban notables and Bedouin tribes also formed {{an integral part of the}} revolt.|$|E

5|$|Artists and {{craftsman}} operated as corporations (guilds) {{rather than}} as individual business. Inscriptions mention guilds of weavers, oilmen, artisans, basket and mat makers and fruit sellers. A Saundatti inscription refers to an assemblage {{of all the people}} of a district headed by the guilds of the region. Some guilds were considered superior to others, just as some corporations were, and received royal charters determining their powers <b>and</b> <b>privileges.</b> Inscriptions suggest these guilds had their own militia to protect goods in transit and, like village assemblies, they operated banks that lent money to traders and businesses.|$|E
5|$|Immediately after Casimir's {{death in}} 1370, the heirless king's nephew Louis of Hungary of the Capetian House of Anjou assumed the Polish throne. As Casimir's actual {{commitment}} to the Anjou succession seemed problematic from the beginning (in 1368 the Polish king adopted his grandson, Casimir of Słupsk), Louis engaged in succession negotiations with Polish knights and nobility starting in 1351. They supported him, exacting in return further guarantees <b>and</b> <b>privileges</b> for themselves; the formal act was negotiated in Buda in 1355. After his coronation, Louis returned to Hungary; he left his mother and Casimir's sister Elizabeth in Poland as regents.|$|E
5|$|In 1568 he {{departed}} for Rome, arriving in 1569 and joining the Society of Jesus. In 1571 {{he returned to}} Poland, and preached successively at Pułtusk, Lwów, Jarosław, Warsaw (where he delivered a sermon before the Sejm) and Płock, where he visited the court of Queen Anna Jagiellon, who {{would become one of}} his patrons. A leading proponent of counter-reformation, Skarga commonly preached against non-Catholic denominations and helped secure funds <b>and</b> <b>privileges</b> for the Society of Jesus.|$|E

As a teacher, she advocated for equal educational and recreational opportunities for girls.|$|E
5|$|The NMP {{scheme was}} {{introduced}} in 1990 and serves to introduce into Parliament alternative, independent and non-partisan views from minorities and experts. This is said to effectively raises the level of political discourse. Women, for example, who are usually under-represented in parliament, may be appointed as an NMP to provide alternate views. A special select committee of Parliament nominates candidates to be appointed as NMPs by the President {{on the advice of}} the Cabinet. In 2010, the number of NMPs was increased from six to nine. NMPs share the same powers <b>and</b> <b>privileges</b> as NCMPs.|$|E

5|$|A Bencher, Benchsitter or (formally) Master of the Bench, is {{a member}} of Pension, the {{governing}} body of the Honourable Society of Gray's Inn. The term originally referred to one who sat on the benches in the main hall of the Inn which were used for dining and during moots, and the term originally had no significance. The position of Bencher developed during the 16th century when the Readers, for unknown reasons, decided that some barristers who were not Readers should be afforded the same rights <b>and</b> <b>privileges</b> as those who were, although without a voice in Pension. This was a rare practice and occurred a total of seven times within the 16th century, the first being Robert Flynt in 1549. The next was Nicholas Bacon in 1550, then Edward Stanhope in 1580, who was afforded the privilege because, although a skilled attorney, an illness meant he could never fulfil the duties of a Reader.|$|E
5|$|Barley's {{relationship}} with Morley was short-lived. By 1600, Morley {{had turned to}} East as his assignee, authorising him to print under his name for three years. Two years later, Morley died, and his music patent fell into abeyance. Unable {{to rely on the}} protections <b>and</b> <b>privileges</b> of Morley's monopoly, Barley most likely came under increasing pressure from the Stationers' Company. His financial circumstances also deteriorated after he was the target of a successful lawsuit by a cook named George Goodale, who was seeking payment of a debt of 80 pounds. As a result of the suit, many of Barley's goods were seized, including various books and reams of paper. Barley greatly reduced his output from 1601 to 1605, publishing only six works.|$|E
5|$|Edward I's {{frequent}} military campaigns put a great financial {{strain on}} the nation. There were several ways through which the king could raise money for war, including customs duties, money lending and lay subsidies. In 1275, EdwardI negotiated {{an agreement with the}} domestic merchant community that secured a permanent duty on wool. In 1303, a similar agreement was reached with foreign merchants, in return for certain rights <b>and</b> <b>privileges.</b> The revenues from the customs duty were handled by the Riccardi, a group of bankers from Lucca in Italy. This was in return for their service as money lenders to the crown, which helped finance the Welsh Wars. When the war with France broke out, the French king confiscated the Riccardi's assets, and the bank went bankrupt. After this, the Frescobaldi of Florence took over the role as money lenders to the English crown.|$|E

5|$|Hugh {{ordered an}} inquest into the {{revenues}} and resources of his bishopric, {{along with the}} customs of the see. This took place in 1183, {{and when it was}} finished, the results were entered into a register that became known as the Boldon Book. Hugh also fought a long-running disagreement with his own cathedral chapter over the right to oversee the monks, a conflict that lasted about 40 years. This led to the monks forging many documents purporting to show that earlier bishops had granted the monks rights <b>and</b> <b>privileges</b> exempting them from episcopal oversight. He also fought with Archbishop Roger of York over lands they both held in each other's see.|$|E
5|$|In the 17th century, oaths {{were taken}} very seriously. As King, James was Head of the Church of Scotland or Kirk, sworn by his Coronation Oath to {{preserve}} its position <b>and</b> <b>privileges.</b> The Test Act required government officials and MPs to swear an Oath of Allegiance to the Protestant religion and the monarch, regardless of personal religion. James thus received their support despite his own Catholicism but promised not to diminish {{the primacy of the}} Church of Scotland. Removing these restrictions was seen as contrary to that commitment. Many MPs were also members of the Episcopalian minority imposed on the Kirk in 1661; Argyll's defeat showed the weakening of Presbyterian influence but voting for these measures would undo that. James' credibility was seriously damaged, since he appeared willing to ignore his previous commitments, his Coronation Oath and his most loyal supporters.|$|E
5|$|John went to France {{to recruit}} warriors to {{accompany}} him to Constantinople. Pope Gregory did not proclaim John's expedition to the Latin Empire a crusade, but promised papal privileges granted to crusaders to those who joined him. During his stay in France, John was again an intermediary between local potentates and signed a peace treaty between Louis IX of France and Hugh X of Lusignan. He returned to Italy in late 1230. John's envoys signed a treaty with Jacopo Tiepolo, Doge of Venice, who agreed to transport him and his retinue of 500 knights and 5,000 commoners to Constantinople in return for John's confirmation of Venetian possessions <b>and</b> <b>privileges</b> in the Latin Empire. Shortly after John left for Constantinople in August, Pope Gregory acknowledged Frederick II's claim to the Kingdom of Jerusalem.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, news of Henry's {{death had}} reached Stephen of Blois, {{conveniently}} placed in Boulogne, {{and he left}} for England, accompanied by his military household. Robert of Gloucester had garrisoned the ports of Dover and Canterbury and some accounts suggest that they refused Stephen access when he first arrived. Nonetheless Stephen reached the edge of London by 8 December {{and over the next}} week he began to seize power in England. The crowds in London proclaimed Stephen the new monarch, believing that he would grant the city new rights <b>and</b> <b>privileges</b> in return, and his brother, Henry of Blois, the Bishop of Winchester, delivered the support of the Church to Stephen. Stephen had sworn to support Matilda in 1127, but Henry convincingly argued that the late King had been wrong to insist that his court take the oath, and suggested that the King had changed his mind on his deathbed. Stephen's coronation was held a week later at Westminster Abbey on 26 December.|$|E
5|$|Saavedra {{thought that}} the victory {{at the battle of}} Suipacha {{strengthened}} his perspective, as the Junta would have defeated its enemies. He considered that Moreno's animosity was rooted in the aforementioned mutiny of Álzaga, as Moreno took part in it. The victory was celebrated at the barracks of the Patricians, where the officer Anastasio Duarte, who was drunk, made a toast to Saavedra, as if he was the king of the Americas. Moreno drafted the Honours Suppression decree when he knew about it, which suppressed the ceremonies <b>and</b> <b>privileges</b> {{of the president of the}} Junta inherited from the former office of viceroy. However, Saavedra signed it without complaint. The Regiment of Patricians resented Moreno because of this, but Saavedra considered that it was a disproportionated response to a trivial issue.|$|E
5|$|Shortly thereafter, {{conservative}} Polish nobility {{formed the}} Targowica Confederation {{to overthrow the}} Constitution, which they saw {{as a threat to}} the traditional freedoms <b>and</b> <b>privileges</b> they enjoyed. The confederates aligned themselves with Russia's Catherine the Great, and the Russian army entered Poland, marking the start of the Polish–Russian War of 1792, also known as the War in Defense of the Constitution. The Sejm voted to increase the Polish Army to 100,000 men, but due to insufficient time and funds this number was never achieved. Poniatowski and the reformers could field only a 37,000-man army, many of them untested recruits. This army, under the command of the King's nephew Józef Poniatowski and Tadeusz Kościuszko, managed to defeat the Russians or fight them to a draw on several occasions. Following the victorious Battle of Zieleńce, in which Polish forces were commanded by his nephew, the king founded a new order, the Order of Virtuti Militari, to reward Poles for exceptional military leadership and courage in combat.|$|E
