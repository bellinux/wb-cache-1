5|$|Remains of Megalomys audreyae {{were found}} by John Walter Gregory among cave breccia on Barbuda around 1900. The exact {{locality}} is unknown. In his 1901 description of Oryzomys luciae, Charles Immanuel Forsyth Major mentioned the Barbuda animal as <b>another</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> the Megalomys group, {{but he never}} published {{a description of the}} latter. Édouard Louis Trouessart gave the name Oryzomys (Megalomys) majori to it in his Catalogus Mammalium, but he did not describe it and therefore the name is a nomen nudum. In 1926, Arthur Hopwood finally described it and named it Megalomys audreyae after Gregory's wife Audrey, following Major's intention.|$|E

5|$|Alexander's death raised {{questions}} about the succession to the throne as well as the nature of the Greek regime.

The Hellenic Parliament demanded that Constantine I and Crown Prince George be excluded from the succession but sought to preserve the monarchy by selecting <b>another</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> the royal house as the new sovereign. On 29 October 1920, the Greek minister in Berne, acting {{under the direction of the}} Greek authorities, offered the throne to Alexander's younger brother, Prince Paul. Paul, however, refused to become king while his father and elder brother were alive, insisting that neither of them had renounced their rights to the throne and that he therefore could never legitimately wear the crown.|$|E
