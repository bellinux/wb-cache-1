25|$|The Blob is {{vulnerable}} to attacks directed at his face, <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> nose, mouth, and ears {{do not have the}} same protection as the rest of his body. Dukes is also susceptible to psionic attacks and psychic manipulation, and he can be incapacitated by sensory assaults; for example, Banshee was able to render Blob unconscious solely through the use of his sonic scream. On another occasion, Sleepwalker defeated the Blob by using warp beams to wrap a steel girder around the villain, crushing his blubber and causing him great physical pain. The Hulk once took the opposite approach, harming the Blob by grabbing and stretching his flab. While he is all but invulnerable to direct kinetic attacks, such as punches, kicks or gunshots, he is susceptible to concussions and other harm resulting from sufficiently powerful impacts, as Daredevil knocked him out by luring him underneath a massive bell and then having it dropped on him with the aid of a young female mutant.|$|E
500|$|Mel Blanc as Speed Buggy, {{an orange}} dune buggy nicknamed [...] "Speedy" [...] {{who has the}} ability to talk and solve mysteries. His {{headlights}} and front grille serve <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> and mouth, respectively. He served as the [...] "wacky hero" [...] of the series with St. Bernard-like qualities. Blanc's frequent work as a voice actor with Hanna-Barbera landed him the position. His voice was similar to the Maxwell automobile he portrayed on the radio series The Jack Benny Program.|$|E
500|$|Because the American {{title was}} different, all scenes that mention the philosopher's stone by name {{had to be}} re-shot, once with the actors saying [...] "philosopher's" [...] and once with [...] "sorcerer's". The {{children}} filmed for four hours and then did three hours of schoolwork. They developed a liking for fake facial injuries from the makeup staff. Radcliffe was initially meant to wear green contact lenses <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> are blue, and not green like Harry's, but the lenses gave Radcliffe extreme irritation. Upon consultation with Rowling, {{it was agreed that}} Harry could have blue eyes.|$|E
60|$|And <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> fell on Fergus's cards, he {{felt there}} was reason in what she said.|$|R
60|$|Uncle John had {{the paper}} at breakfast on Monday, {{and he gave}} an amused laugh <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> caught {{the report of the}} Sizer party.|$|R
6000|$|... "Where are the Allat? Where is my wife?" [...] {{he exclaimed}} vehemently, <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> {{fell on the}} {{prostrate}} form of his still insensible grandfather.|$|R
2500|$|The {{second of}} the miracles {{attributed}} to her involves Phil McCord of Terre Haute, Indiana, and occurred in January 2001. McCord, who had worked in facilities management for the Sisters of Providence, stopped by the Church of the Immaculate Conception on the grounds and was drawn in by music from the pipe organ there. [...] While in the church he felt compelled to pray to Guérin, asking for strength to undergo a medical operation for his failing eyesight, <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> had deteriorated to legally blind status: 20-800 in one eye and 20-1000 in the other. After praying, he went home. When he awoke the next morning, his vision had returned to 20-20, and his eye now needed only laser treatment to remove old tissue.|$|E
2500|$|The idea to use Superman’s cape, {{which came}} from Miles Millar, to {{represent}} Clark’s [...] "cosmic lifespan" [...] came after much discussion on what to actually use. Ideas were thrown around, including a shot of Lex dumping kryptonite on Clark, as he is lying down, killing him. Ultimately they went with Millar’s idea, which they saw as this [...] "great iconic moment", because the audience finally sees their first glimpse of Superman’s costume. Superman’s cape {{was not the only}} iconic imagery used during the third season. The episode [...] "Whisper" [...] not only introduced a new superpower for Clark, his super hearing, but allowed the writing staff the opportunity to provide a sort of [...] "in-joke" [...] to the audience. The team wrote in a gag where Clark wears a pair of eyeglasses, a staple of his disguise later in life while working at the Daily Planet. In the episode, an accident with Clark’s heat vision causes him to go blind; <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> heal, he is forced to wear a pair of prescription eyeglasses until he fully regains his sight. [...] "Perry" [...] would introduce Clark’s future boss, and editor of the Daily Planet, Perry White. This episode would also serve as the point where Clark finally learns that his powers are caused by the radiation from Earth’s yellow Sun.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wonder where}} that blew in from," [...] remarked Grayson, <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> {{discovered}} Bridge astride the tired pony, {{looking at him}} through the window. A polite smile touched the stranger's lips <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> met Grayson's, and then wandered past him to the imposing figure of the Easterner.|$|E
6000|$|... 'To say!' he cried. 'Not I. I'm ready.--Yes,' he added, <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> {{fell upon}} Barnaby, 'I {{have a word}} to say, too. Come hither, lad.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tiens, {{this little}} Dodd!" [...] cried the master; and then, <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> fell on my {{dilapidated}} clothing, I thought I could perceive his countenance to darken.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very true!--what is very true?--how came you here?" [...] vociferated the metaphysician, <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> {{fell upon}} {{something}} which lay stretched at full length upon the bed.|$|R
60|$|Saton smiled <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> met his host's. He hesitated perceptibly.|$|E
60|$|The {{minister}} {{pushed forward}} the letter, and Louis started <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> fell upon it.|$|E
60|$|<b>As</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> {{fell on the}} quiet, stern, spectacled figure, {{he leaped}} from the bed.|$|E
6000|$|... "What, you here, Mr. West?" [...] he said, <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> {{fell upon}} me. [...] "What {{is it you}} want, and why have you brought this fellow with you?" ...|$|R
60|$|She led the {{way into}} the room, her husband {{following}} her. The count gave a cry <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> fell upon Jack, and every vestige of color left his face.|$|R
6000|$|... "But where, oh! {{where is}} my sister?" [...] again demanded Eustace, <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> met that of Father Cyril, who, summoned by the screams of the servants, had just entered the hall.|$|R
60|$|The king, {{white and}} trembling, gasped <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> fell upon {{the face of}} the American.|$|E
60|$|Hodder recalled, <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> {{rested on}} her compassionately, {{the sufferings of}} that other woman in Dalton Street.|$|E
60|$|<b>As</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> {{rested on}} the first line the noise in the passage--intermitted for a moment only--disturbed him again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{you think}} it's pretty nice here?" [...] asked Bab, <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> {{came back to}} them after a long look, which seemed to take in every thing, {{brightening}} as it roved.|$|R
60|$|She {{lifted the}} white veil to its usual place round her hat; {{as she did}} so, Chris uttered a sharp exclamation <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> fell on a bluish-red mark across her face.|$|R
6000|$|The {{question}} was put {{before he had}} quite recovered consciousness; the terminal [...] "oh!" [...] was something like a groan of despair, <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> fell on the forbidding countenance of the captain.|$|R
60|$|It {{was late}} in the {{afternoon}} before John woke. He started up, <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> fell upon Captain Davenant.|$|E
60|$|Mechanically he drew it out; and, <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> {{fell on the}} handwriting, {{something}} {{seemed to}} snap inside him.|$|E
60|$|At {{first he}} seemed bewildered, but <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> fell on Wulf {{a look of}} {{pleasure}} came into them, and he smiled faintly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear me!" [...] he exclaimed, with an {{expression}} of annoyance, <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> fell on the first lines, [...] "I find that Emma and her good-for-nothing husband will, in all likelihood, be here to-night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What a farm {{one could}} have here," [...] {{declared}} Dave, <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> roved over the stretch of prairie. [...] "Not a single tree to cut down or stump to burn or drag out." ...|$|R
60|$|As soon <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> {{fell on the}} telegraph-board he {{saw with}} a start that things had been moving rapidly in his brief absence. The numbers of the batsmen on the board were three and five.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wonder who}} he is?" [...] mused Patsy, {{watching}} the weary, haggard features <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> slowly followed {{the lines of}} his magazine.|$|E
6000|$|... "Take another pledge, old man," [...] {{said the}} Parsee, <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> lighted up like fire-flies in the gloom--"Hemp only can kill thee." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Believe me, {{there will}} be some celebration to-night!" [...] vouchsafed Songbird, <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> lit up in expectation. [...] "Bonfires, speeches, parades, and all that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ha! a young Crusader, I perceive," [...] was the {{greeting}} {{of the old}} knight, <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> fell on the white cross on Richard's mantle. [...] "Welcome, brother! Dost thou need counsel on thy goodly Eastern way?" ...|$|R
60|$|Above {{the driving}} snow, from the summits of the wind-wheels, {{appeared}} vast masts carrying globes of livid light. They receded in illimitable vistas in every direction. As far <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> could penetrate the snowfall they glared.|$|R
60|$|Gradually, <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> dwelt on the words, 'Amelia, {{the beloved}} wife,' {{the waves of}} feeling swelled within his soul, and he threw himself on the grave, {{clasping}} it with his arms, and kissing the cold turf.|$|R
