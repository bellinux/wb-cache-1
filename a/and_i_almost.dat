25|$|However, {{some critics}} did not review the film so positively. In his review for the Los Angeles Times, Kenneth Turan criticized Max’s overtly “snooty” {{personality}} as “too off-putting to tolerate” which could potentially discourage audiences when identifying with the film. Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film two-and-a-half stars {{out of four}} citing an issue with the film’s shift in tone in the final act, stating “the air goes out of the movie” in regards to “stage-setting and character development”. He further wrote, “Anderson and Wilson are good offbeat filmmakers … But their film seems torn between conflicting possibilities: it’s structured like a comedy, but there are undertones of darker themes, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>almost</b> wish they’d allowed the plot to lead them into those shadows”.|$|E
25|$|Outside the {{breeding}} season, and when food is locally abundant, the ducks may congregate in small flocks, sometimes {{of up to}} about a hundred. Murphy noted:On December 20th, 1912, I photographed a pair of teals feeding in a trickle of water which ran through tall tussock grass from the melting edge of a glacier. The birds were well hidden by the screen of grass, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>almost</b> stumbled over them before seeing them. They appeared quite unconcerned, however, and continued prodding about in the mud. When I had come within two steps of them, they raised their heads and waddled farther off among the hummocks, from where they peered out through drooping grass. All but the bright eyes and yellow bills blended completely with the surroundings. Matthews has well said that their pattern fits in so thoroughly with the environment that it is sometimes only {{the movement of the}} conspicuous yellow bill that calls one’s attention to their presence. Many observers have noted the birds’ preference to lose themselves in the grass when they are approached, rather than to seek safety in the air, and it is likely that before the arrival of men and guns at South Georgia they used their wings only for relatively short and infrequent flights.|$|E

500|$|Verdi and Strepponi now {{decided on}} marriage; they {{travelled}} to Collonges-sous-Salève, a village then part of Piedmont. On 29 August 1859 {{the couple were}} married there, with only the coachman who had driven them there and the church bell-ringer as witnesses. At the end of 1859, Verdi wrote to his friend Cesare De Sanctis [...] " [...] I have not made any more music, I have not seen any more music, I have not thought anymore about music. I don't even know what colour my last opera is, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>almost</b> don't remember it."

For the latter role she was nominated for the Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie Scream Scene and the MTV Movie Award for Best Frightened Performance. She later revealed that she almost did not audition for the film due to her fear of dogs. [...] " [...] Michael Bay has these gigantic [...] [...] And, when I went to audition for The Amityville Horror, I went into his offices and literally these three huge dogs were there, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>almost</b> turned around. I was like, 'No, I'm not going to read for this film.' I actually used the dogs in my audition {{to think of what}} would scare me the most." [...] The Amityville Horror received generally negative reception from critics, but was a commercial success.|$|E
500|$|In the interim, Hoppus and Barker {{continued}} {{playing music}} together in +44. The group {{first began to}} lay down electronic demos in Barker's basement and Hoppus' dining room shortly after the breakup. +44's debut, When Your Heart Stops Beating, was released the following year but stalled commercially and received mixed reviews. Barker starred in the MTV reality series Meet the Barkers with his then-wife, former Miss USA Shanna Moakler. The couple's later split, reconciliation and subsequent breakup made them tabloid favorites. Meanwhile, DeLonge disappeared from public eye, making no appearances, granting no interviews and remaining silent until September 2005, when he announced his new project, Angels & Airwaves, promising [...] "the greatest rock and roll revolution for this generation." [...] He later revealed he was addicted to painkillers at the time, recalling [...] "I was losing my mind, I was on thousands of painkillers, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>almost</b> killed myself," [...] and {{did not realize that}} his promise of revolution sounded highly ambitious. The group released two albums in 2006 and 2007: We Don't Need to Whisper and I-Empire. During the hiatus, Hoppus shifted his attention to producing albums (most notably Commit This to Memory by former tour-mate Motion City Soundtrack) and hosting his podcast, HiMyNameisMark, while Barker launched a shoe line and worked on three other musical projects—the Transplants, +44, and TRV$DJAM, a collaboration with friend Adam Goldstein (DJ AM).|$|E
