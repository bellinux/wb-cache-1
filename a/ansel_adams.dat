5|$|Photographer <b>Ansel</b> <b>Adams</b> {{made his}} first trip to Yosemite in 1916; his {{photographs}} of the valley made him famous in the 1920s and 1930s. Adams willed the originals of his Yosemite photos to the Yosemite Park Association, and visitors can still buy direct prints from his original negatives. The studio in which the prints are sold was established in 1902 by artist Harry Cassie Best.|$|E
5|$|Congress {{set aside}} about 89 {{percent of the}} park in a highly {{protected}} wilderness area through passage of the Wilderness Act of 1964. No roads, motorized vehicles (except rescue helicopters and other emergency vehicles), or any development beyond trail maintenance are allowed in this area. The adjacent <b>Ansel</b> <b>Adams</b> Wilderness and John Muir Wilderness were also protected under the act and include regions removed from the park immediately before it was unified with the state grant in 1906.|$|E
5|$|In {{the visual}} arts, the Hudson River School was a mid-19th-century {{movement}} {{in the tradition of}} European naturalism. The realist paintings of Thomas Eakins are now widely celebrated. The 1913 Armory Show in New York City, an exhibition of European modernist art, shocked the public and transformed the U.S. art scene. Georgia O'Keeffe, Marsden Hartley, and others experimented with new, individualistic styles. Major artistic movements such as the abstract expressionism of Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning and the pop art of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein developed largely in the United States. The tide of modernism and then postmodernism has brought fame to American architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright, Philip Johnson, and Frank Gehry. Americans have long been important in the modern artistic medium of photography, with major photographers including Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Steichen, and <b>Ansel</b> <b>Adams.</b>|$|E

5|$|During Prohibition, Pflueger {{designed}} {{bars for}} private clubs {{such as the}} Stock Exchange Luncheon Club where members kept their personal bottles in small lockers behind the bar, and two bars for The Family, one at the Family Farm in Woodside and one at the clubhouse in San Francisco. Pflueger created a cocktail bar and nightclub for Frank Martinelli and Tom Gerun in 1931, the Bal Tabarin, featuring a stage for live music and colorful indirect lighting from above metal fins in the ceiling and behind curved metal strips upstage. When Prohibition ended in December 1933, Bal Tabarin received an immediate renovation by Pflueger along with a liquor license from the state. Pflueger was then asked to design cocktail lounges for several hotels, completing the Cirque for the Fairmont Hotel in 1935, adorned with finely painted murals by Esther Bruton, and in 1939, both the Patent Leather Bar for the St. Francis Hotel and the Top of the Mark for the Mark Hopkins Hotel. The Patent Leather Bar used a metal-finned ceiling much like that which Pflueger had installed above the audience at the Paramount Theatre in Oakland. A padded, serpentine bar snaked through the room's mirror, chrome and black leather decor. <b>Ansel</b> <b>Adams</b> was retained by C. Templeton Crocker {{to show off the}} new cocktail lounge in photographs.|$|E

25|$|<b>Ansel</b> <b>Adams</b> {{elevated}} dodging {{and burning}} {{to an art}} form. Many of his famous prints were manipulated in the darkroom with these two methods.

25|$|At first, {{fine art}} photographers tried to imitate {{painting}} styles. This movement is called Pictorialism, often using soft focus for a dreamy, 'romantic' look. In reaction to that, Weston, <b>Ansel</b> <b>Adams,</b> and others formed the Group f/64 to advocate 'straight photography', the photograph as a (sharply focused) thing in itself {{and not an}} imitation of something else.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} {{her junior}} year, in June 1930, Stuart married Blair Gordon Newell, a young {{sculptor}} who apprenticed with Ralph Stackpole on the facade of the San Francisco Stock Exchange building.

25|$|The ACMAA’s {{collection}} of nineteenth-century landscape photographs includes images by John K. Hillers (1843–1925), William Henry Jackson (1843–1942), Timothy H. O'Sullivan (1840–1882), Andrew J. Russell (1830–1902), and Carleton E. Watkins (1829–1916). Twentieth-century master images by <b>Ansel</b> <b>Adams</b> (1902–1984) are complimented by later twentieth-century landscapes {{from the studios}} of William Clift (b. 1944), Frank Gohlke (b. 1942), and Mark Klett (b. 1952).|$|E
25|$|He was {{instrumental}} in establishing the Kings Canyon National Park, commissioning <b>Ansel</b> <b>Adams</b> as a 'photographic muralist' in a visionary public relations project that Ickes had himself conceived to document and communicate, on a visceral level, the outstanding beauty of the parks for the capitol public to see, and indirectly but effectively persuading the Congress to support the bill to President Roosevelt in 1940.|$|E
25|$|For decades, he contributed {{photographs}} {{of his home}} state to Arizona Highways and was {{best known for his}} Western landscapes and pictures of native Americans in the United States. Three books with his photographs are People and Places, from 1967; Barry Goldwater and the Southwest, from 1976; and Delightful Journey, first published in 1940 and reprinted in 1970. <b>Ansel</b> <b>Adams</b> wrote a foreword to the 1976 book.|$|E
25|$|During {{the same}} time a small group of like-minded photographers in the San Francisco area, led by Van Dyke and <b>Ansel</b> <b>Adams,</b> began informally meeting to discuss their common {{interest}} and aesthetics. Inspired by Weston's show at the De Young Museum the previous year, they approached the museum with the idea of mounting a group exhibition of their work. They named themselves Group f/64, and in November, 1932, an exhibition of 80 of their prints opened at the museum. The show was a critical success.|$|E
25|$|Forms of {{tone mapping}} long precede digital photography. The {{manipulation}} {{of film and}} development process to render high contrast scenes, especially those shot in bright sunlight, on printing paper with a relatively low dynamic range, is effectively a form of tone mapping, {{although it is not}} usually called that. Local adjustment of tonality in film processing is primarily done via dodging and burning, and is particularly advocated by and associated with <b>Ansel</b> <b>Adams,</b> as described in his book The Print; see also his Zone System.|$|E
