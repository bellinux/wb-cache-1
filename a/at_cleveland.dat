5|$|Cleveland {{held its}} {{training}} camp at Bowling Green University, {{as it did}} the year before. The Browns played one preseason game in late August against the Baltimore Colts, a new AAFC team formed to replace the Miami Seahawks after the Seahawks folded. The Browns scored their first points on a drive in the second period. A 14-yard run by fullback Marion Motley set up a 25-yard touchdown throw by quarterback Otto Graham to end Mac Speedie. Cleveland scored three more touchdowns in the game, all of them following Colts passes the Browns intercepted. One {{of them was a}} pass by Graham to end Dante Lavelli in the third quarter, and another was a rush by halfback Edgar Jones. Paul Brown pulled most of the Browns' starters from the game as the team built up a three-touchdown lead. Backup end Bob Cowan scored a fourth Cleveland touchdown in the final quarter on a pass from backup quarterback Ermal Allen, and the Browns won 28–0. Following the victory, the Browns faced the Buffalo Bills in the regular-season opener <b>at</b> <b>Cleveland</b> Stadium to begin their defense of the AAFC championship.|$|E

After beating the Brooklyn Dodgers in an exhibition game, Cleveland opened the regular season against the Miami Seahawks <b>at</b> <b>Cleveland</b> Stadium on September 6, winning 44–0. The Browns proceeded to win six more games before losing {{for the first time in}} October against the San Francisco 49ers at home by a score of 34–20.

5|$|The Los Angeles Rams, a {{professional}} American football team based in Los Angeles, joined the National Football League (NFL) as Cleveland Rams in 1937.

In 1946, Rams' owner Dan Reeves, fed up with poor attendance <b>at</b> <b>Cleveland</b> Stadium, moved the Rams to Los Angeles, and the team played there from 1946 to 1979. Before his death in 1979, later Rams owner Carroll Rosenbloom planned a move within the Los Angeles metropolitan area to Anaheim, using the venue now known as Angel Stadium, and his widow and successor Georgia Frontiere went through with the move in 1980, with the team still officially representing Los Angeles. The Rams moved to St. Louis in 1995 and renamed the team St. Louis Rams. In January 2016, the Rams and the NFL announced that the team would return to Los Angeles.
