40|$|This paper investigates {{depository}} institutions' decisions {{whether or}} not to impose surcharges (direct usage fees) on nondepositors who use their ATMs. In addition to documenting patterns of surcharging, we examine motives for surcharging, including both direct generation of fee revenue and the potential to <b>attract</b> <b>deposit</b> customers who wish to avoid incurring surcharges at an institution's ATMs. Consistent with expectations, we find that the probability of surcharging increases with both the institution's share of market ATMs and the time since surcharging was first allowed in the state, and decreases with increasing local ATM density. Further, we find evidence consistent with the use of surcharges to <b>attract</b> <b>deposit</b> customers who are new to the local banking market, but we find no evidence that larger banks use surcharges as a means to attract existing customers away from smaller local competitors. © 2003 President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ...|$|R

30|$|Consequently, {{considering}} the complete banking system, mixed results were found. It seems that Mexican banks face market discipline, and depositors do not particularly consider managerial skills as relevant proxies of bank risk to exert market discipline. In addition, {{the findings suggest}} that banks can counterattack market discipline with combinations of price, quantity, and maturity of deposits. For example, if a bank confronts market discipline by paying higher interest rates on deposits due to its low capital ratios, this bank can lessen this discipline <b>attracting</b> more long-term <b>deposits</b> anyway. Similarly, if a bank pays higher interest rates on deposits due to a high risk of insolvency, this risk does not influence the quantity of <b>attracted</b> <b>deposits</b> and their maturity.|$|R
