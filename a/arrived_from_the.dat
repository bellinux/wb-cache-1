5|$|Lancaster {{negotiated}} a truce with Harclay, and withdrew to the town. During the night {{a great number}} of the rebels deserted, and the next day the sheriff of York <b>arrived</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> south with additional forces.

5|$|A {{second group}} of 770 {{children}} from Stara Gradiška followed on 13–14July, while a third, consisting of another 850 children were transported from the Adriatic coastal village of Jablanac {{at the end of}} the month. On 5August, 800 more children <b>arrived</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> concentration camp at Mlaka. The last group <b>arrived</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> nearby village of Gornja Reka on 14August with 150 children, all boys. In total, 3,136 children arrived at the camp up to 14August. According to the historian Dragoje Lukić, a total of 3,336 children passed through the camp during its existence, aged between one and fourteen years old. One survivor, Dušanka Šmitran, who had previously been held at one of the sub-camps of the Jasenovac concentration camp complex, stated that she was dragged away from her mother at the sub-camp and they were packed tightly into railway wagons for the journey. On arrival in Zagreb, she said they were taken to the Croatian Red Cross building where they were washed, had their hair cut, and were allowed to eat as much as they could. She remarked that this was the only time such things occurred during her time in the Ustaše camps.|$|E
5|$|After the 52nd (Lowland), the 74th (Yeomanry) Divisions {{and nine}} British {{infantry}} battalions {{from each of}} the 10th, 53rd, 60th and 75th Divisions were sent to France between May and August 1918, the remaining British infantry battalions were reinforced by British Indian Army battalions. Infantry brigades were now reorganised with one British battalion and three British Indian Army battalions, {{with the exception of one}} brigade in the 53rd Division which had one South African and three Indian battalions. The British Indian Army's 7th (Meerut) Division <b>arrived</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> campaign in Mesopotamia in January 1918, followed by the 3rd (Lahore) Division in April 1918. Only the 54th (East Anglian) Division remained, as previously, an all British division.|$|E

5|$|Andrew II {{decided to}} return home, leaving the crusaders' camp with Hugh I and Bohemond IV in early 1218. Although {{military}} action was suspended after their departure, the crusaders restored fortifications at Caesarea and Atlit. After new troops <b>arrived</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Holy Roman Empire in April, they decided to invade Egypt. They elected John supreme commander, giving him the right to rule the land they would conquer. His leadership was primarily nominal, since he could rarely impose his authority on an army of troops from many countries.|$|E
5|$|Between January and March 1916, Townshend {{launched}} several {{attacks in}} an attempt to lift the siege. In sequence, the attacks took place at the Battle of Sheikh Sa'ad, the Battle of the Wadi, the Battle of Hanna, and the Battle of Dujaila Redoubt. These attempts to break through the encirclement did not succeed and the cost was heavy with both sides suffering high casualties. In February food, and hopes were running out for Townshend in Kut-al-Amara. Disease spread rapidly and could not be contained or cured and Townshend surrendered in April 1916. In December 1916, the 3rd and 7th Divisions <b>arrived</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Western Front.|$|E
5|$|By {{the medieval}} period, {{the region was}} {{consolidated}} under the Garhwal Kingdom {{in the west and}} the Kumaon Kingdom in the east. During this period, learning and new forms of painting (the Pahari school of art) developed. Modern-day Garhwal was likewise unified under the rule of Parmars who, along with many Brahmins and Rajputs, also <b>arrived</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> plains., the seat of the Kumaon Kingdom. The Garhwal Kingdom was re-established from a smaller region in Tehri. It was annexed to Kingdom of Nepal by Amar Singh Thapa. After Anglo-Nepalese War, it was ceded to the British as part of the Treaty of Sugauli.|$|E

5|$|During {{this time}} the {{battalion}} received a number of reinforcements from its associated Militia unit, the 3rd Battalion (The Werriwa Regiment). This unit had been fighting in New Guinea {{as part of the}} 30th Brigade, with whom it had served on the Kokoda Track alongside the 2/3rd as well as the 39th and 49th Battalions, before being returned to Australia, where it had been disbanded. Other reinforcements also <b>arrived</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 16th Battalion, and a new commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Ian Hutchison took over in April 1943, having temporarily commanded the battalion during the fighting around Eora Creek in the previous campaign.|$|E
5|$|Eleven Ottoman {{infantry}} divisions {{had been}} forced to retire, suffering 28,443 casualties; some 12,000 prisoners were captured, 100 guns, and scores of machine guns were also captured. Now the Ottoman Army needed to deploy troops from other theatres to make up for these significant losses. On 15 December the Ottoman 2nd Caucasian Cavalry Division arrived in Palestine and became the reserve of the XXII Corps before taking part in the counterattacks of 27 December. The 1st Infantry Division <b>arrived</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Caucasus and moved to Nablus in reserve. A significant consequence of the Ottoman Empire's firm focus on the Levant was that the British recapture of Baghdad and the British offensive in Mesopotamia became more viable and secure.|$|E

Whitaker became the inaugural director of the Clinton Laboratories, as the semiworks became officially known in April 1943. The first permanent operating staff <b>arrived</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago in April 1943, by which time DuPont began transferring its technicians to the site. They were augmented by one hundred technicians in uniform from the Army's Special Engineer Detachment. By March 1944, there were some 1,500 people working at X-10.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to their Flying Dutchman recordings and subsequent Arista recordings, Winter in America utilized a sparse production quality and {{small number of}} sessions musicians. A small supporting line-up, featuring drummer Bob Adams and bassist Danny Bowens, contributed on a few cuts. Adams and Bowens, who studied with Scott-Heron at Lincoln University, <b>arrived</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Pennsylvania-based college {{on the last day}} of recording on October 15, 1973. Scott-Heron and Jackson handled most of the vocals, songwriting, and instrumentation, and they were assisted by Williams with the production.|$|E
5|$|Major General Auguste Gilliaert <b>arrived</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Congo {{before the}} end of the month. On 27 June General William Platt, {{advancing}} with British forces from Sudan, ordered the Belgians to attack the Italian positions if an opportunity presented itself and Gilliaert immediately undertook preparations for an offensive. The plans for taking Mogi were to be abandoned and the Belgians were to concentrate their efforts against Saïo and all but 50 of the soldiers besieging it were redeployed.|$|E
5|$|Musically, {{the album}} is {{structured}} like a DJ's set. The songs are sequenced and blended together {{so that they are}} played continuously without any gaps. The title <b>arrived</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> fact that the album track listing consists of light-hearted and happy songs in the beginning, and progresses to much darker melodies and lyrics describing personal feelings and commitments. Songs on the album sample and reference the music of other dance-oriented artists like ABBA, Donna Summer, Pet Shop Boys, the Bee Gees and Depeche Mode, as well as Madonna's 1980s output.|$|E

5|$|Rather than {{turn left}} towards Concord, Marine Lieutenant Jesse Adair, {{at the head}} of the advance guard, decided on his own to protect the flank of the British column by first turning right and then leading the {{companies}} onto the Common itself, in a confused effort to surround and disarm the militia. Major Pitcairn <b>arrived</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> rear of the advance force and led his three companies to the left and halted them. The remaining companies under Colonel Smith lay further down the road toward Boston.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} third repulse of the Confederates on the western wing, the 2nd Kentucky and 9th Tennessee regiments <b>arrived</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Mauckport Road and joined the battle, giving the attackers a {{numerical}} superiority. At about 12:40p.m., Capt. Byrnes arrived with the Confederate artillery and used his two ten-pound Parrott rifle cannons to pin down the defenders in the works. In the meantime, Morgan was leading his main body of troops far around {{the eastern edge of}} the defenses and up the Plank Road, threatening the town directly and bypassing the defenses entirely. As they moved onto the Corydon Pike, they shot and robbed a toll gate keeper who refused to throw down his gun.|$|E
5|$|Signed on June 15, 1846, the Oregon Treaty {{ended the}} {{dispute between the}} United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and the United States, by {{dividing}} the Oregon Country at the 49th parallel. This extended U.S. sovereignty over the region, but effective control would not occur until government officials <b>arrived</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> United States. Two years later, on August 14, 1848, the United States Congress created the Oregon Territory; this territory included today's states of Oregon, Washington, and Idaho, and parts of Montana and Wyoming. Appointed Governor of the Oregon Territory by President Polk, Joseph Lane arrived at Oregon City on 2 March 1849.|$|E

5|$|The American {{airborne}} landings {{began with}} the arrival of pathfinders at 00:15. Navigation was difficult because of a bank of thick cloud, and as a result only one of the five paratrooper drop zones was accurately marked with radar signals and Aldis lamps. Paratroopers of the US 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions, numbering over 13,000 men, were delivered by Douglas C-47 Skytrains of the IX Troop Carrier Command. To avoid flying over the invasion fleet, the planes <b>arrived</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> west over the Cotentin Peninsula and exited over Utah Beach.|$|E
5|$|The French Resistance in Paris rose {{against the}} Germans on 19 August. Eisenhower {{initially}} wanted {{to bypass the}} city to pursue other targets, but amid reports that the citizens were going hungry and Hitler's stated intention to destroy it, de Gaulle insisted {{that it should be}} taken immediately. French forces of the 2nd Armoured Division under General Philippe Leclerc <b>arrived</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> west on 24 August, while the U.S. 4th Infantry Division pressed up from the south. Scattered fighting continued throughout the night, and by the morning of 25 August Paris was liberated.|$|E
5|$|The Slavs <b>arrived</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> East {{between the}} 5th and 6th centuries during the Migration Period. As a {{response}} to onslaughts by Avars, the local Slavic tribes rebelled and established Samo's Empire (623–658), the first known Slavic political entity. In the 9th century, the castles at Bratislava (Brezalauspurc) and Devín (Dowina) were important centres of the Slavic states: the Principality of Nitra and Great Moravia. Scholars have debated the identification as fortresses of the two castles built in Great Moravia, based on linguistic arguments {{and because of the}} absence of convincing archaeological evidence.|$|E
