Deguang enjoyed not only {{the support of his}} mother, but also of the Khitan nobility. Realizing that he could not <b>assume</b> <b>the</b> throne, {{and that it would be}} dangerous to try, Bei campaigned in favor of allowing his younger brother to <b>assume</b> <b>the</b> throne, and by the end of 927, formally stated to his mother that Deguang's qualifications were superior to his own, functionally ending his ability to challenge Deguang's ascension to the throne.|$|E
