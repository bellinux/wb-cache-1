5|$|A {{fiberglass}} Space Race cabinet {{was designed}} for the game by Atari's product designer, George Faraco. The tall, angular cabinet, reminiscent of the fiberglass cabinet for Computer Space, {{was the first to}} display the Atari logo. The cabinet design was distinctive enough that Bushnell considered using it for Pong as well, but the production costs proved too high and only 50 units were made before the design was dropped and Space Race switched to a more traditional rectangular cabinet. The final cabinet stands nearly 5 feet tall and weighs over 200 pounds. Bushnell later stated that the molds to make the fiberglass cabinets cost US$2000 and could only make one per day due to the complicated shape, and Atari felt the cost did not justify buying enough molds to make a full production run in <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>amount</b> of time. The final Space Race cabinet was reused later that same year for Pong Doubles, a four-player version of Pong.|$|E
5|$|Skilful use of {{headwind}} {{and thermal}} updrafts along various {{sections of the}} hill is used to generate additional lift, creating pressure under the oversized skis and enabling athletes to effectively ride on a 'cushion of air'. <b>A</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>amount</b> of headwind is favourable to a long jump as it {{has the effect of}} keeping the athlete aloft and delaying their descent back onto the hill, whereas a tailwind or no wind at all is highly unfavourable and tends to shorten a jump by pushing the athlete downwards towards the hill too early. In particular, the presence of a tailwind forms one of the most challenging aspects of clearing the knoll and achieving a competitive distance. A crosswind is just as challenging, as it can create dangerous instability in the air. Conversely, in ideal headwind conditions, an athlete can 'catch' an updraft along various points of the hill – which always involves some degree of luck – and use it to glide even further, making for an impressive visual effect for audiences.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Heuristic {{algorithms}} (or simply heuristics) are {{methods that}} seek for high quality solutions within <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> (limited) <b>amount</b> of time {{without being able}} to guarantee optimality. They often come out as a result of imitation of the real world (physics, nature, biology, etc.). In this paper, we give an overview of some heuristic algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems. At the beginning, some definitions related to combinatorial optimization, as well as the principle (framework) and basic features of the heuristics for combinatorial problems are concerned. Then, several popular heuristic algorithms are discussed, namely: descent local search, simulated annealing, tabu search, genetic algorithms, ant algorithms, and iterated local search. The unified paradigms of these heuristics are given. Finally, we present some results of comparisons of these algorithms for the well-known combinatorial problem, the quadratic assignment problem...|$|R

Other food sources that contain copper include cereals, potatoes, peas, red meat, mushrooms, some dark green leafy vegetables (such as kale), and fruits (coconuts, papaya and apples).

25|$|Until {{the late}} 19th century, timpani were hand-tuned; that is, {{there was a}} {{sequence}} of screws with T-shaped handles, called taps, which altered {{the tension in the}} head when turned by players. Thus, tuning was a relatively slow operation, and composers had to allow <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>amount</b> of time for players to change notes if they were called to tune {{in the middle of a}} work. The first 'machine' timpani, with a single tuning handle, was developed in 1812. The first pedal timpani originated in Dresden in the 1870s and are called Dresden timpani for this reason. However, since vellum was used for the heads of the drums, automated solutions were difficult to implement since the tension would vary unpredictably across the drum. This could be compensated for by hand-tuning, but not easily by a pedal drum. Mechanisms continued to improve in the early 20th century.|$|E

In addition to the class having had several successful receivers, none of the five wide receivers drafted in the first round have been busts, as all of them spent at least <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>amount</b> of time as starters in the NFL. Combined, 1996 wide receivers (through the end of the 2006 season) have totalled 7,646 receptions for 105,866 yards, eclipsing any other class by more than 1,000 receptions and 10,000 yards.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} bilevel multiobjective {{optimization}} model with fuzzy coefficients to tackle a stone resource assignment {{problem with the}} aim of decreasing dust and waste water emissions.

On the lower level, stone plants must reasonably assign stone resources to produce different stone products under the exploitation constraint. To deal with inherent uncertainties, the object functions and constraints are defuzzified using a possibility measure. A fuzzy simulation-based improved simulated annealing algorithm (FS-ISA) is designed to search for the Pareto optimal solutions. Finally, a case study is presented to demonstrate the practicality and efficiency of the model. Results and a comparison analysis are presented to highlight the performance of the optimization method, which proves to be very efficient compared with other algorithms...|$|R
40|$|For <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> {{financial}} <b>amount,</b> today no CCD-arrays {{are available}} with an information content close to traditional photogrammetric aerial cameras.

As CCD-arrays cannot be fitted together without gaps, the 4 individual optics of a DMC camera are combined in a convergent arrangement. For easy handling, the images of the individual optics have to be arranged together to a single virtual image, corresponding to the geometry of one single perspective camera. In spite of a very stable mounting, small movements of one optic against the other cannot be avoided. By this reason, the sub-images are transformed together based on tie points in the overlapping areas by bundle adjustment solution. This is resulting in a sub-pixel accuracy of the virtual image based on the availability of a precise determination of the interior orientation of the single camera heads. 1...|$|R
