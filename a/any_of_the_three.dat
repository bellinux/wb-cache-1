5|$|Donayre's {{tenure as}} Commanding General {{of the army}} was {{controversial}} from the start due to corruption allegations and an international incident with Chile. Opposition leader Ollanta Humala criticized Donayre's designation as irregular because at that time he was not serving as general of <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> major army divisions as stipulated by Peruvian law. As commander of the Army, Donayre was also accused of acquiring 50,000 American-made MREs— military rations— to supply troops deployed against Shining Path guerrillas in the Apurímac and Ene river valleys, instead of acquiring cheaper, locally-made alternatives. An attempt to buy 50,000 more rations led to an inquiry by the Ministry of Defense.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Cain {{was named}} an All-Star {{for the first}} time in his career; he won 14 games and had a winning record {{for the first time}} since 2006.

He compared the site's aggregate scores, based on critical and audience consensus, for films released in January, February, and March from 2000 to 2009. January averaged the fewest releases of the three, and the lowest average scores. Of the 88 films released {{in the first month}} of the year during that decade, only six earned above a 61 average on the site's scale of 0 to 100, the lowest of <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> winter months, even accounting for the increase in releases as the spring becomes closer.|$|E
5|$|In the 16th century, Adriaan van Roomen {{solved the}} problem using {{intersecting}} hyperbolas, but this solution does not use only straightedge and compass constructions. François Viète found such a solution by exploiting limiting cases: <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> given circles can be shrunk to zero radius (a point) or expanded to infinite radius (a line). Viète's approach, which uses simpler limiting cases to solve more complicated ones, is considered a plausible reconstruction of Apollonius' method. The method of van Roomen was simplified by Isaac Newton, who showed that Apollonius' problem is equivalent to finding a position from the differences of its distances to three known points. This has applications in navigation and positioning systems such as LORAN.|$|E
5|$|Local {{units are}} called {{squadron}}s. A squadron is broken into flights. Squadrons {{are the main}} functioning body of Civil Air Patrol. Civil Air Patrol squadrons are designated as either cadet, senior, or composite squadrons. A CAP composite squadron consists of both cadets and senior members, who {{may be involved in}} <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> missions of Civil Air Patrol. Composite squadrons have two deputy commanders to assist the squadron commander: a Deputy Commander for Seniors and a Deputy Commander for Cadets. A senior squadron includes only senior members, who participate in the emergency services or aerospace education missions of Civil Air Patrol. A cadet squadron is largely made up of cadets, with a small number of senior members as necessary for supervision of cadets and the proper execution of the cadet program. Overseas squadrons operate independently of this structure, reporting directly to the National Headquarters.|$|E

5|$|The Canadian monarch, {{seen as the}} fount of honour, is at {{the apex}} of the Order of Canada as its Sovereign, {{followed}} by the governor general, who serves as the fellowship's Chancellor. Thereafter follow three grades, which are, in order of precedence: Companion, Officer, and Member, each having accordant post-nominal letters that members are entitled to use. Each incumbent governor general is also installed as the Principal Companion for the duration of his or her time in the viceregal post and continues as an extraordinary Companion thereafter. Additionally, any governor general, viceregal consort, former governor general, former viceregal consort, or member of the Canadian Royal Family may be appointed as an extraordinary Companion, Officer, or Member. Promotions in grade are possible, though this is ordinarily not done within five years of the initial appointment, and a maximum of five honorary appointments into <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> grades may be made by the governor general each year. , there have been 21 honorary appointments.|$|E
5|$|The {{agreements}} with Spanish authorities allowed only airlines {{from the country}} of origin or from Spain to fly charter flights. But because of the SAS-cooperation, an agreement was made where any Scandinavian airline could fly to Spain from <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> Scandinavian countries. Domestically, Braathens SAFE received strong competition from Sterling Airways, {{but on the other}} hand this allowed Braathens SAFE to fly charter flights from Sweden. In 1968, the large Swedish–Danish charter airline Internord went bankrupt, giving Braathens SAFE increased charter traffic. The company also started purchasing a larger share of Altas Resor, until it took over all the whole company in 1978. In Sweden, Braathens SAFE used its partners to sell charter flights to Norway, and then continue their flights using scheduled flights. Braathens SAFE was hindered by the charter regulations from making intercontinental flights, as well as flights between the Scandinavian capitals. The rules also forced business travelers to use scheduled flights.|$|E

5|$|The games {{interacted with}} each other: players could begin with <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> titles {{and have the}} actions of the first game affect the story of the other two, a concept {{conceived}} by Okamoto. More than ten of Flagship's scenarists, among them Resident Evil writer Junichi Miyashita, worked simultaneously on the three stories. The developers considered using a cell phone adapter to transfer data, but later decided on a password system. The limitations of this system and the difficulty of coordinating three games proved too complicated, so the team scaled back to two titles at Miyamoto's suggestion. Condensing the games into a single cartridge was never considered, as the prospect of multiple endings and the added replay value afforded by the ability to play the titles in either order was very attractive. Oracle of Seasons was adapted from Mystical Seed of Power, Oracle of Ages was adapted from Mystical Seed of Wisdom, and Mystical Seed of Courage was canceled.|$|E
5|$|The journey's beginning, on 9 July 1763, was inauspicious; on {{the first}} day a {{carriage}} wheel broke, requiring a 24-hour pause while repairs were carried out. Leopold turned this delay to advantage by taking Wolfgang to the nearby church at Wasserburg, where according to Leopold the boy played on the organ pedalboard {{as if he had been}} studying it for months. In Munich, on successive evenings, the children played before Elector Maximilian III, earning from these engagements the equivalent of half of Leopold's annual salary of 354 gulden or florins. The next stop was Augsburg, where Leopold's estranged mother refused to attend <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> concerts given there. The family then moved on to Schwetzingen and the Mannheim court, where the children's performance apparently amazed Elector Palatine Karl Theodor and his Electress.|$|E

5|$|In {{the months}} leading up to the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup, McLeod joined the Canadian {{national}} team as they took part in an extended residency in order to prepare and train. McLeod and the Canadian national team started off the year at the Four Nations Tournament. While McLeod was on the roster for the tournament, she did not play in <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> games, allowing fellow Canadian Stephanie Labbé to gain experience. McLeod made her first appearance of the year at the Cyprus Cup in March, where she appeared in three of the four matches that Canada played, recording three shutouts. She also appeared in two other friendlies against France and England in April and May. In April 2015, McLeod was named to the 23-player Canadian roster for the FIFA Women's World Cup hosted by Canada. As Canada's veteran goalkeeper, she started in net for all five of the team's matches, recording three shutouts, and helping Canada earn a sixth-place finish. The team's one loss came in the quarter-finals against England, which halted their advancement in the tournament. Although McLeod had an impressive tournament, she was left off both the Golden Glove shortlist and the FIFA Technical Study Group All-Star Squad.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{this left}} open the {{question}} of where to locate the capital. Initially the Bombala district in the far south of NSW was proposed, to which southern Monaro, (which incorporated Bombala), Orange and Yass were soon added. The NSW Premier, John See, offered to provide <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> recommended sites as a future capital territory. Edmund Barton, the first Prime Minister of the new Federal Government, added another four sites to this list: Albury, Tamworth, Armidale and Tumut, and members of the new government toured the various sites in 1902. The tour proved inconclusive, and upon their return the members decided to refer the problem to a Royal Commission, with the Minister for Home Affairs, William Lyne, pushing for Tumut or Albury as he preferred a site in his electorate. Subsequently, the Commission presented its report to Parliament in 1903, recommending the sites of Albury, Tumut and Orange, in that order. However, there continued to be problems, as the House of Representatives backed the Tumut option, while the Senate preferred the town of Bombala. As a result of this disagreement the bill lapsed, and it was left to the second Parliament to choose a location for the capital.|$|E
5|$|On February 18, WWE {{announced}} via {{its website}} that the fourth annual Money in the Bank ladder match {{would take place}} at WrestleMania XXIV, a match where {{the objective is to}} retrieve a briefcase suspended in the air using a ladder.

The winner would earn a contract to challenge for <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> WWE World Championships (the WWE Championship of Raw, the World Heavyweight Championship of SmackDown, or the ECW Championship of ECW) at any time and any place over a one-year period. Qualifying matches occurred to determine the participants in the match at WrestleMania, starting on that night's Raw with Jeff Hardy and Mr. Kennedy defeating Snitsky and Val Venis respectively to qualify. Shelton Benjamin became the third participant when he defeated Jimmy Wang Yang on the following episode of SmackDown. During the next two weeks on Raw, Chris Jericho defeated Jeff Hardy, and Carlito defeated Cody Rhodes to qualify. At a non-televised SmackDown/ECW house show held on March 8, Montel Vontavious Porter qualified when he defeated Jamie Noble. On the March 11 episode of ECW, CM Punk became the seventh entrant when he defeated Big Daddy V. John Morrison was the final person to qualify when he beat The Miz on the March 14 episode of SmackDown. Jeff Hardy was later removed from the match after a legitimate suspension by WWE for a drug violation of the company's Wellness Policy. WWE decided not to add another superstar in his place, making that year's Money in the Bank ladder match the first year to have seven participants.|$|E
