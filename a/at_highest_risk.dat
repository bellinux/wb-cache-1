5|$|Argentina's geomorphic {{characteristics}} {{make the}} country highly vulnerable to floods. These floods can damage infrastructure, cause loss of life, {{increase the risk of}} diseases, and negatively impact agricultural productivity, {{which is one of the}} main economic activities of the country. Many of the large Argentinean cities and agriculturally productive areas lie near rivers. The plains are <b>at</b> <b>highest</b> <b>risk</b> for flooding, particularly in the northeastern and central parts of the country, including Greater Buenos Aires. This is because these plains, which cover 35% of the land area in the country (including the Chaco and Pampean areas), are characterized by a flat landscape, which can impede proper water drainage. Both the Parana and Paraguay basins have a flat landscape and are thus highly susceptible to flooding due to river overflows following high rainfall. These floods can last for months, particularly in the Parana River, owing to its large basin. In the most extreme case, during the year 1982–1983, the floods in the Parana River persisted for more than a year, negatively impacting the area both socially and economically. Major flooding events in the Parana River include those of 1992 and 1997 and have been more frequent since the 1980s due to higher precipitation trends. Similarly, in Buenos Aires Province, flooding occurs due to river overflows and poor water drainage; major flooding events in the province occurred in 1987, 2002/2003, 2012 and in 2014, causing damage to agriculture production. Most of the flooding events occur in El Niño years owing to higher rainfall. Flooding can also affect Patagonia and urban centers in the northwest, but the number of people affected and economic losses are lower than those in the Pampas owing to lower population densities. Flooding can jeopardize access to safe water. A leptospirosis outbreak occurred following a flood in 1998.|$|E
25|$|Infectious {{diseases}} {{are likely to}} continue to account for more military hospital admissions than battlefield injuries. U.S. military personnel deployed at NATO and U.S. bases overseas, will be at low-to-moderate risk. <b>At</b> <b>highest</b> <b>risk</b> will be U.S. military forces deployed in support of humanitarian and peacekeeping operations in developing countries.|$|E
25|$|Among those <b>at</b> <b>highest</b> <b>risk</b> for B12 {{deficiency}} are {{the elderly}} population, as 10-15% of people aged 60+ may present with {{some form of}} hypocobalaminemia. High rates of deficiency in the elderly commonly results from the decrease of functional absorption of B12, as production of intrinsic factor declines with age. However, pernicious anemia {{is the most common}} cause of B12 deficiency in North American and European populations.|$|E

40|$|We {{estimated}} cost-effectiveness of annually vaccinating {{children not}} <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> with inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) {{to range from}} US $ 12, 000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) saved for children ages 6 - 23 months to $ 119, 000 per QALY saved for children ages 12 - 17 years. For children <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> (preexisting medical conditions) ages 6 - 35 months, vaccination with IIV was cost saving. For children <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> ages 3 - 17 years, vaccination cost $ 1, 000 -$ 10, 000 per QALY. Among children not <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> ages 5 - 17 years, live, attenuated influenza vaccine had a similar cost-effectiveness as IIV. Risk status {{was more important than}} age in determining the economic effects of annual vaccination, and vaccination was less cost-effective as the child's age increased. Thus, routine vaccination of all children is likely less cost-effective than vaccination of all children ages 6 - 23 months plus all other children <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk.</b> Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
25|$|Idiopathic {{scoliosis}} {{can appear}} at different ages. Infantile idiopathic scoliosis that appear from the birth to 3 years old, account for 0.5% of idiopathic scoliosis. Juvenile idiopathic scoliosis that appear from the 4 to 10 years old, account for 10.5% of idiopathic scoliosis. Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis that appear {{after the age}} of 10 years, account for 89% of idiopathic scoliosis. From these statistics, it seems that individuals are <b>at</b> <b>highest</b> <b>risk</b> of developing idiopathic scoliosis during adolescence.|$|E
25|$|Chickenpox {{is rarely}} fatal, {{although}} it is generally more severe in adult men than in women or children. Non-immune pregnant women and those with a suppressed immune system are <b>at</b> <b>highest</b> <b>risk</b> of serious complications. Arterial ischemic stroke (AIS) associated with chickenpox {{in the previous year}} accounts for nearly one third of childhood AIS. The most common late complication of chickenpox is shingles (herpes zoster), caused by reactivation of the varicella zoster virus decades after the initial, often childhood, chickenpox infection.|$|E
25|$|The {{research}} {{that led to}} golden rice was conducted {{with the goal of}} helping children who suffer from vitamin A deficiency (VAD). In 2005, 190 million children and 19 million pregnant women, in 122 countries, were estimated to be affected by VAD. VAD is responsible for 1–2 million deaths, 500,000 cases of irreversible blindness and millions of cases of xerophthalmia annually. Children and pregnant women are <b>at</b> <b>highest</b> <b>risk.</b> Vitamin A is supplemented orally and by injection in areas where the diet is deficient in vitamin A.|$|E

25|$|While most infants born {{to mothers}} who have SLE are healthy, {{pregnant}} mothers with SLE should remain under medical care until delivery. Neonatal lupus is rare, but identification of mothers <b>at</b> <b>highest</b> <b>risk</b> for complications allows for prompt treatment {{before or after}} birth. In addition, SLE can flare up during pregnancy, and proper treatment can maintain {{the health of the}} mother longer. Women pregnant and known to have anti-Ro (SSA) or anti-La antibodies (SSB) often have echocardiograms during the 16th and 30th weeks of pregnancy to monitor the health of the heart and surrounding vasculature.|$|E
25|$|The adoptee {{population}} does, however, {{seem to be}} more at {{risk for}} certain behavioral issues. Researchers from the University of Minnesota studied adolescents who had been adopted and found that adoptees were twice as likely as non-adopted people to suffer from oppositional defiant disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (with an 8% rate in the general population). Suicide risks were also significantly greater than the general population. Swedish researchers found both international and domestic adoptees undertook suicide at much higher rates than non-adopted peers; with international adoptees and female international adoptees, in particular, <b>at</b> <b>highest</b> <b>risk.</b>|$|E
25|$|Political officials, policymakers, administrators, {{and service}} {{providers}} were increasingly willing {{to recognize the}} relevance of a substantial body of scientific research that suggested effective intervention strategies that could {{change the course of}} the epidemic. Also, major policy recommendations with regard to behavioral interventions were preceded by small pilot projects that showed feasibility or efficacy in those populations <b>at</b> <b>highest</b> <b>risk.</b> Once the evidence base was documented, both the policymakers and politicians publicly showed their support for HIV prevention and care, as well as passing legislation to enforce and broadly disseminate health practices (e.g., routine HIV testing and access to care).|$|E

In 2010, the highest number of confirmed Lyme disease cases were reported from New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Minnesota, Maryland, Virginia, New Hampshire, Delaware, and Maine. U.S. workers in the northeastern and north-central States are <b>at</b> <b>highest</b> <b>risk</b> of exposure to infected ticks. Ticks may also transmit other tick-borne diseases to workers in these and other regions of the country. Worksites with woods, bushes, high grass, or leaf litter are likely to have more ticks. Outdoor workers should be extra careful to protect themselves in the late spring and summer when young ticks are most active.|$|E
25|$|According to Cloninger’s model, {{the early}} life onset of neuropsychiatric {{disorders}} lead to personality disorders, with individuals having low RD scores. Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD) is characterized in behavioral terms by childhood or adolescent onset of recurrent antisocial behavior. Cloninger had predicted from his biosocial theory that individuals {{most at risk}} of aggressive, antisocial behavior, will be those with lower RD scores and these individuals are equated with the primary psychopaths who show aloofness and social detachment. Particular research conducted on childhood behavior has tested this theory and researchers have shown that children with lower RD scores have more of an anti-social profile as defined in the DSM, and are <b>at</b> <b>highest</b> <b>risk</b> for early onset of frequent delinquent behavior.|$|E
25|$|However {{oral hygiene}} is {{probably}} more effective at preventing gum disease (periodontal disease) than tooth decay. Food is forced inside pits and fissures under chewing pressure, leading to carbohydrate-fueled acid demineralisation where the brush, fluoride toothpaste, and saliva {{have no access to}} remove trapped food, neutralise acid, or remineralise demineralised tooth like on other more accessible tooth surfaces. (Occlusal caries accounts for between 80 and 90% of caries in children (Weintraub, 2001).) Chewing fibre like celery after eating forces saliva inside trapped food to dilute any carbohydrate like sugar, neutralise acid and remineralise demineralised tooth. The teeth <b>at</b> <b>highest</b> <b>risk</b> for carious lesions are the permanent first and second molars due to length of time in oral cavity and presence of complex surface anatomy.|$|E
40|$|Objective: Stroke is {{the leading}} cause of death and disability, and is closely related to a lack of {{exercise}}. Currently, most Chinese medical staff members lack exercise and may be at risk for stroke. We sought to determine the risk factors for stroke and study the significance of health-related physical fitness testing in stroke prevention among Chinese medical staff members. Methods: A total of 627 subjects from Urumqi, Xinjiang, China, were included in the study and a survey was conducted from 1 st January 2016 to 1 st February 2016. Stroke screening and health-related physical fitness testing were completed according to the standard protocol, and the related data were analyzed. Results: Based on the screening, 27. 6 % (n =  173) of the subjects were <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> for stroke. The top risk factors for stroke in these subjects were dyslipidemia, lack of exercise or mild physical activity, being overweight or obese, and high blood pressure. Body weight, body mass index, body fat, visceral fat area, body fat percentage, and basal metabolic rate were significantly higher (P <  0. 01) in subjects <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> for stroke than in subjects who were not <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk.</b> Lung capacity, step index, grip test, vertical jump, and sit-up/push-up index were significantly lower (P <  0. 01) in subjects <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> for stroke than in subjects who were not <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk.</b> Conclusions: A large proportion of China's on-the-job medical personnel is <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> for stroke. This may be related to the nature of the profession and warrants more attention from the society. The health-related physical fitness measurement parameters in subjects <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> for stroke were significantly different from those in subjects who were not <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk.</b> Screening and health-related physical fitness testing in medical staff members may contribute to stroke prevention. More rigorous controlled clinical trials will be needed in the future. Keywords: Stroke, <b>High</b> <b>risk</b> population, Health-related physical fitness, Preventio...|$|R

In general, {{children and the}} elderly are <b>at</b> <b>highest</b> <b>risk</b> for gastrointestinal disease. In a study investigating the association between drinking water quality and gastrointestinal illness in the elderly of Philadelphia, scientists found water quality 9 to 11 days before the visit was negatively associated with hospital admissions for gastrointestinal illness, with an interquartile range increase in turbidity being associated with a 9% increase). The association was stronger in those over 75 than in the population aged 65–74. This example is a small reflection of residents of the United States remain at risk of waterborne gastrointestinal illness under current water treatment practices.|$|E
25|$|By {{the spring}} of 1944 Rommel had turned the mostly nonexistent 'Wall' into a {{formidable}} defensive line, but since he believed the invasion would come somewhere between Dunkirk and {{the mouth of the}} Somme, much of his work was directed at strengthening the wrong area, although in late 1943 he had focused on Normandy. As fears of an imminent invasion mounted, conflict broke out among the commanders. Rommel wanted the armoured divisions positioned close to the coast, mostly in the area he considered <b>at</b> <b>highest</b> <b>risk.</b> The commander of armoured forces in France, General Leo Freiherr Geyr von Schweppenburg, backed by Rundstedt, strongly disagreed, wanting his forces to be positioned inland to preserve their manoeuvrability. Eventually Hitler intervened, imposing a compromise: half the armour would be allocated to the Army Groups defending the beaches, and half would be kept in reserve under Geyr von Schweppenburg; the latter, however, were not to be deployed without Hitler's direct order. Hitler made matters worse by appointing Rommel commander of Army Group B, covering all of northern France. This unworkable command structure was to have dire consequences when the invasion came.|$|E

2500|$|As many as 50–70% {{of people}} who survive traffic {{accidents}} have facial trauma. In most developed countries, violence from other people has replaced vehicle collisions as {{the main cause of}} maxillofacial trauma; however in many developing countries traffic accidents remain the major cause. [...] Increased use of seat belts and airbags has been credited with a reduction in the incidence of maxillofacial trauma, but fractures of the mandible (the jawbone) are not decreased by these protective measures. The risk of maxillofacial trauma is decreased by a factor of two with use of motorcycle helmets. A decline in facial bone fractures due to vehicle accidents is thought to be due to seat belt and drunk driving laws, strictly enforced speed limits and use of airbags.
