5|$|About a {{thousand}} pilot whales are killed this way {{each year on}} the Faroe Islands together with usually <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>dozen</b> up to a few hundred animals belonging to other small cetaceans species, but numbers vary greatly per year. The amount of Pilot Whales killed each year is not {{believed to be a}} threat to the sustainability of the population, but the brutal appearance of the hunt has resulted in international criticism especially from animal welfare organisations.|$|E

5|$|Expansion of the {{original}} parking facilities is also necessary to meet demand at many stations, since many started with small lots suitable for just <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>dozen</b> cars. The rebuilt stations at Branford, Guilford, Madison, Clinton, and Westbrook have larger lots than the 1990 stations, and a second lot with 272 spaces opened at Branford in June 2011. A 585-space, three-level parking garage is eventually planned for Madison station.|$|E

5|$|The Catlins {{area has}} very few inhabitants; {{the region as}} a whole has a {{population}} of only some 1200 people. Almost all of the Catlins' population lies either close to the route of the former state highway running from Balclutha to Invercargill (which now forms part of the Southern Scenic Route), or in numerous tiny coastal settlements, most of which have only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>dozen</b> inhabitants.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} day {{was spent in}} launching airstrikes and a heavy artillery bombardment against the hilltop, totally denuding it of cover. On 23 November, 2-503 and 4-503 were ordered to renew their assault while the 1st Battalion, 12th Infantry assaulted 875 from the south. This time the Americans gained the crest, but the North Vietnamese had already abandoned their positions, leaving only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>dozen</b> charred bodies and weapons.|$|E
5|$|Ferugliotheriids {{are known}} from <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>dozen</b> {{isolated}} teeth and a questionably allocated jaw fragment. Most fossils {{are referred to}} Ferugliotherium; Trapalcotherium and Argentodites were each described {{on the basis of}} a single tooth. Their precise dental formula is unknown, but incisors, premolars, and molariform teeth have been identified. Gurovich suggested that Ferugliotherium had one incisor (possibly two in the upper jaw), no canines, one or two premolars, and two molars on each side of the lower and upper jaws.|$|E

Ten crew members are known to have survived, all of whom returned to Japan. The total number of casualties is estimated at 1,620 sailors. Fusō was removed from the navy list on 31 August 1945.|$|E

5|$|In general, seabirds live longer, breed {{later and}} have fewer young than other birds do, but they invest {{a great deal}} of time in their young. Most species nest in colonies, which can vary in size from <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>dozen</b> birds to millions. Many species are famous for {{undertaking}} long annual migrations, crossing the equator or circumnavigating the Earth in some cases. They feed both at the ocean's surface and below it, and even feed on each other. Seabirds can be highly pelagic, coastal, or in some cases spend a part of the year away from the sea entirely.|$|E
5|$|L. ahuacaense {{is known}} only from Cerro El Ahuaca, a steep granite inselberg near Cariamanga in Loja Province, {{southern}} Ecuador, where it occurs {{at an altitude}} of , but only near rocky surfaces. The vegetation is dominated by the molasses grass (Melinis minutiflora). They eat plants, and traces of their feeding are visible on the mountain. Their habitat on Cerro El Ahuaca covers an area around , and the total population there may not contain more than <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>dozen</b> individuals. Except for some small outcrops close to the Cerro, no nearby habitat is suitable, but more populations may exist elsewhere in southern Ecuador or nearby northern Peru.|$|E

5|$|Piłsudski's PPS, {{while not}} {{planning}} for a major uprising then and there, had a policy of supporting the protest and harassing Russian forces. The PPS, {{as well as other}} socialist organizations, such as Jewish Bund and SDKPiL, were as surprised by the scale of the spontaneous revolt as the Russian authorities; PPS forces in Łódź consisted of 10 regular and armed PPS members and <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>dozen</b> semi-enlisted workers. A larger group sent from Warsaw under Walery Sławek never made it in time to take control or affect the uprising; it was, in the end, an anarchic and unorganized violent protest against the Russian government.|$|E
5|$|Svalbard was {{undoubtedly}} spotted by Willem Barentsz of the Netherlands in 1596, {{although it may}} have previously have been discovered by Norsemen or Pomors.

The following year the Muscovy Company sent a new expedition, but was met by both Dutch and Spanish whalers. The company claimed exclusive rights to the area and sent away the contenders. In 1613, seven armed English ships were sent on an expedition that expelled <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>dozen</b> Dutch, Spanish and French vessels.|$|E

50|$|A group {{contribution}} method {{is used to}} predict properties of pure components and mixtures by using group or atom properties. This reduces the number of needed data dramatically.
