5000|$|The station buildings, {{which are}} grade II listed, were {{acquired}} by the Landmark Trust and the stationmaster's house converted into holiday <b>accommodation,</b> <b>opening</b> in 1972. In 2008 the Landmark Trust converted the waiting-room to provide additional accommodation space. The buildings are occasionally {{open to the public}} as part of an [...] "Open Day" [...] scheme run by the Trust.|$|E
5000|$|The {{site has}} now been redeveloped into student <b>accommodation,</b> <b>opening</b> in 2016. The site's {{heritage}} can still be seen in various areas, not least of all {{the name of the}} building - [...] "Gatecrasher Apartments" [...] - with its logo representing a vinyl record. Elsewhere the theme continues with a garden feature in the courtyard {{in the shape of a}} record turntable and the four wings of the building named after musical terms - Opus, Mezzo, Vivo and Accent.|$|E
40|$|The {{accommodations}} (3) hold releasable fixing components (4) each {{of which}} is provided with fixture devices for the small part. The <b>accommodations</b> are <b>openings,</b> in which the fixing components are inserted. In each accommodation, several fixing components or a group of them are inserted. The <b>accommodation</b> <b>openings</b> fully penetrate the magazine round carrier (1). The accommodations are arranged on the round carrier in a regular manner and especially in a form which allows a simple programming of a control unit for the input, handling and/or removal of the stored small parts. ADVANTAGE - Each small part has a defined location in the magazine so that apart from a manual input and removal an automatic input and removal in arbitrary sequence is possible...|$|R
50|$|In 1970 the Scottish Marine Biological Station {{moved to}} Dunstaffnage Bay (Oban), and MMBS {{was taken over}} by the University of London in {{partnership}} with Glasgow University, becoming the University Marine Biological Station Millport (UMBSM). It continued to expand, with a hostel <b>accommodation</b> block <b>opening</b> in 1975.|$|R
50|$|At 9:30 am, {{four men}} entered {{classrooms}} and <b>accommodation</b> blocks, <b>opening</b> fire on teachers and students; {{they were also}} armed with suicide vests. The attack happened as the students and faculty members gathered at the school for a poetry recital to commemorate the death anniversary of Gandhian Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan. The university was reportedly not adequately secured, especially at the backside of the building, which had low boundary walls. Witnesses reported that an assistant professor, armed with a pistol, fired at the assailants.|$|R
50|$|The {{campus in}} Coventry is {{currently}} undergoing a £430 million investment programme {{for the period}} up to 2022, with a new £37 million science and health building and £73 million student <b>accommodation</b> complex - <b>opening</b> in 2017 and 2018 respectively - central to the development scheme.|$|R
5000|$|Cobb's {{exterior}} {{design for}} the Hotel Kimball included a rusticated stone base; arched window openings with stone voussoirs; vertical stone banding; and a detailed cornice profile. The interior featured grand function rooms, including an elegant ballroom and world-class lounge, as well as ample guest <b>accommodations.</b> On its <b>opening</b> in 1911, it was reviewed by the New York Times as [...] "ranking with the finest hotels in the country. A magnificent hotel, modern and metropolitan in every appointment." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1940, a new {{maternity}} wing {{designed by}} Donoghue and Fulton was erected {{on the eastern}} side of Kenmore. After the opening in 1959 of a new convent and chapel, the upper rooms of Kenmore were converted into wards and nursing <b>accommodation.</b> After the <b>opening</b> of a new building in 1985, Kenmore became the administrative core of the hospital and a radiography and outpatients unit was established there. The upper floor houses a number of retired nuns and the Sisters' heritage centre.|$|R
50|$|The {{suppliers}} of materials - the pipe shop, the locksmith shop, and the workshops for production of manuals and action parts - {{are located on}} the same premises as the builders, to allow for complete control over the quality of every part of their organs. Rieger has a long-standing interest in social justice, having {{been one of the}} first employers to give their employees health insurance and electric lighting in their <b>accommodation</b> in the <b>opening</b> years of the twentieth century. Manufacture of action parts for their organs is now undertaken mainly by handicapped people.|$|R
5000|$|The Hotel Sterling {{opened with}} {{approximately}} 175 rooms and 125 bathrooms. This suggests {{a large number}} of suites with adjoining parlor rooms. Thus each suite would equal two or more rooms along with one bathroom. It is possible that some hotel rooms had to share a bathroom, but also possible that all accommodations had a private bathroom. While still not common, it was becoming fashionable {{at the turn of the}} century that the best hotels would have a bathroom for each form of <b>accommodation.</b> Prior to <b>opening,</b> the hotel was leased for 10 years to W. A. Reist, of York, Pa., and Sylvanus Stokes, of Baltimore. These gentlemen would run the hotel, and oversaw the final fitting out of the structure as to furnishings, etc. The elegant hotel opened to great fanfare, and was instantly the largest and best hotel in the area, and among the best in the northeast United States.|$|R
40|$|In {{the modern}} {{building}} construction, different size of openings {{are provided in}} the web of reinforced concrete (RC) deep beams to accommodate utility pipes and ducts of essential services such as electricity cable, telephone network and air-conditioning network. However, <b>accommodation</b> of such <b>openings</b> caused reduction in beam strength, stiffness and caused excessive cracking and deflection. Many investigations were conducted to study the behaviour of openings in beams and relevant strengthening options to reinstate the lost capacity. One of the strengthening options considered lamination of fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) sheets due to its superior properties such as high tensile strength and stiffness, high resistance to corrosion, excellent fatigue performance and good resistance to chemical attack. FRP lamination has been widely accepted by the research community and practicing engineers {{in the construction industry}} as the material for strengthening and rehabilitation of common problems. However, quite limited literatures contained the use of FRP to strengthen RC deep beams with openings. This paper discussed the review of eleven different articles contained study of RC deep beams with openings together with effects of strengthening using FRP sheets. The outcome of this review paper outlined the way forward and future research focus in this area...|$|R
40|$|The {{breakdown}} of the Hall-Petch relation in the grain-size strength dependence of nanocrystalline metals has been rationalized by the activation of deformation mechanisms taking place at the grain boundary which compete with crystal plasticity and become dominant when grain sizes are sufficiently small. In this work, we develop a continuum description of the effective response of nanocrystalline metals. The model {{is based on a}} finite element formulation of the continuum three-dimensional problem describing the deformation of polycrystal grains explicitly and on the consideration of grain boundaries as surfaces of discontinuity with finite thickness embedded in the continuum. A phenomenological model formulated within the framework of variational constitutive updates is proposed to describe the operative grain-boundary deformation mechanisms of sliding and <b>opening</b> <b>accommodation.</b> The model parameters are fitted to atomistic results for copper at very high loading rate. Tensile test simulations using this model reproduce the inverse grain-size dependency of the macroscopic yield stress predicted by atomistic simulations. In particular, the model predicts that the grain-size dependency of the yield stress shows a linear relation to the inverse square root of the grain size, as in the traditional Hall-Petch law, but with a negative coefficient. The results are in good agreement with the atomistic simulations and also with quasi-static experimental tests. The ability to model the effective response of nanocrystals without the need of explicitly accounting for each individual atom opens the way for the analysis of nanocrystalline materials in sample sizes and under strain rates of technological significance...|$|R
