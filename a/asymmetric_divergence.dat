40|$|Much like humans, gene duplicates may {{be created}} equal, {{but they do}} not stay that way for long. For four {{completely}} sequenced genomes we show that 20 %– 30 % of duplicate gene pairs show asymmetric evolution in the amino acid sequence of their protein products. That is, one of the duplicates evolves much faster than the other. The greater this asymmetry, the greater the ratio Ka/Ks of amino acid substitutions (Ka) to silent substitutions (Ks) in a gene pair. This indicates that most <b>asymmetric</b> <b>divergence</b> may be caused by relaxed selective constraints on one of the duplicates. However, we also find some candidate duplicates where positive (directional) selection of beneficial mutations (Ka/Ks > 1) {{may play a role in}} <b>asymmetric</b> <b>divergence.</b> Our analysis rests on a codon-based model of molecular evolution that allows a test for <b>asymmetric</b> <b>divergence</b> in Ka. The method is also more sensitive in detecting positive selection (Ka/Ks > 1) than models relying only on pairwise gene comparisons...|$|E
40|$|Successive whole genome duplications have {{recently}} been firmly established in all major eukaryote kingdoms. It is not clear, however, how such dramatic evolutionary process has contributed to shape the large scale topology of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. We propose and analytically solve a generic model of PPI network evolution under successive whole genome duplications. This demonstrates that the observed scale-free degree distributions and conserved multi-protein complexes may have concomitantly arised from i) intrinsic exponential dynamics of PPI network evolution and ii) <b>asymmetric</b> <b>divergence</b> of gene duplicates. This requirement of <b>asymmetric</b> <b>divergence</b> is in fact "spontaneously" fulfilled {{at the level of}} protein-binding domains. In addition, domain shuffling of multi-domain proteins is shown to provide a powerful combinatorial source of PPI network innovation, while preserving essential structures of the underlying single-domain interaction network. Finally, large scale features of PPI networks reflecting the "combinatorial logic" behind direct and indirect protein interactions are well reproduced numerically with only two adjusted parameters of clear biological significance.

Two duplicates are presumed to have diverged from an outgroup gene. Each of the three branches of this tree is allowed to have its own Ks and Ka values. RESULTS Figure 2 shows a simple measure of asymmetric divergence: the absolute difference |K a 1 -K a 2 | of the number of amino acid replacement substitutions per site for each gene pair analyzed, plotted against that pair’s statistical significance P (as �log 10 P). As described in the Methods, we tested the hypothesis that the number of pairs with asymmetric K a values could be explained by the 5 % error rate of our individual hypothesis tests. For all four genomes, we must reject this null hypothesis (baker’s yeast: P = 7 � 10 � 5, fission yeast: P = 0. 0042, fruit fly: P = 2 � 10 � 8, worm: P = 6 � 10 � 15).

In distribution learning, choosing appropriate probability distributions based on observed data is critical for approximating the true distribution. To improve the performance of machine learning models, there has recently been interest in designing objective functions based on Lp-Wasserstein distance rather than the classical Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. In this paper, we derive concentration and asymptotic results using Bregman divergence.

In addition, we show that such features as fat-tail degree distribution, various rates of average degree growth and non-averaging, revealed recently for only the particular case of a completely <b>asymmetric</b> <b>divergence,</b> are present in a general case of arbitrary divergence.

40|$|Abstract Background Successive whole genome duplications have {{recently}} been firmly established in all major eukaryote kingdoms. Such exponential evolutionary processes must have largely contributed to shape the topology of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks by outweighing, in particular, all time-linear network growths modeled so far. Results We propose and solve a mathematical model of PPI network evolution under successive genome duplications. This demonstrates, from first principles, that evolutionary conservation and scale-free topology are intrinsically linked properties of PPI networks and emerge from i) prevailing exponential network dynamics under duplication and ii) <b>asymmetric</b> <b>divergence</b> of gene duplicates. While required, we argue that this <b>asymmetric</b> <b>divergence</b> arises, in fact, spontaneously {{at the level of}} protein-binding sites. This supports a refined model of PPI network evolution in terms of protein domains under exponential and asymmetric duplication/divergence dynamics, with multidomain proteins underlying the combinatorial formation of protein complexes. Genome duplication then provides a powerful source of PPI network innovation by promoting local rearrangements of multidomain proteins on a genome wide scale. Yet, we show that the overall conservation and topology of PPI networks are robust to extensive domain shuffling of multidomain proteins as well as to finer details of protein interaction and evolution. Finally, large scale features of direct and indirect PPI networks of S. cerevisiae are well reproduced numerically with only two adjusted parameters of clear biological significance (i. e. network effective growth rate and average number of protein-binding domains per protein). Conclusion This study demonstrates the statistical consequences of genome duplication and domain shuffling on the conservation and topology of PPI networks over a broad evolutionary scale across eukaryote kingdoms. In particular, scale-free topologies of PPI networks, which are found to be robust to extensive shuffling of protein domains, appear to be a simple consequence of the conservation of protein-binding domains under asymmetric duplication/divergence dynamics in the course of evolution. </p...|$|E
40|$|Gene duplications {{and gene}} losses have been {{frequent}} {{events in the}} evolution of animal genomes, with the balance between these two dynamic processes contributing to major differences in gene number between species. After gene duplication, it is common for both daughter genes to accumulate sequence change at approximately equal rates. In some cases,however, the accumulation of sequence change is highly uneven with one copy radically diverging from its paralogue. Such ‘asymmetric evolution’ seems commoner after tandem gene duplication than after whole genome duplication, and can generate substantially novel genes. We describe examples of asymmetric evolution in duplicated homeobox genes of moths, molluscs and mammals, in each case generating new homeobox genes that were recruited to novel developmental roles. The prevalence of <b>asymmetric</b> <b>divergence</b> of gene duplicates has been underappreciated, in part because the origin of highly divergent genes can be difficult to resolve using standard phylogenetic methods...|$|E

40|$|The {{validity}} of the traditional balance approximation for the asymmetric flow above the boundary layer generally in hurricanes is examined here. Scaling considerations of the divergence equation show that the {{validity of}} the balance approximation hinges on the smallness of the nondimensional product /) 3 (ny /hr). The first(d 9 z 9 n n term represents the ratio of <b>asymmetric</b> horizontal <b>divergence</b> to <b>asymmetric</b> vertical vorticity for azimuthal wavenumber n, while the second term represents a Rossby number based upon the azimuthal mean tangential wind and absolute vertical vorticity of the hurricane vortex. Wind observations of Hurricane Gloria (1985) indicate that this product is not at all small in the near-vortex region (several hundred kilometers beyond the radius of maximum tangential winds) where asymmetric convergence forced by surface friction and cumulus convection is typically large. Although the Gloria observations represent only a single case, there are dynamical reasons to expect this product to be O(1) just above the hurricane boundary layer in steadily translating hurricanes. The meteorological relevance of these results to the problem of balance dynamics in hurricanes is briefly discussed. 1...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityHow {{cellular}} elements {{coordinate their}} function {{is a fundamental}} question in biology. A crucial step towards understanding cellular systems is the mapping of physical interactions between protein, DNA, RNA and other macromolecules or metabolites. Genome-scale technologies have yielded protein-protein interaction networks for several eukaryotic species and have provided insight into biological processes and evolution, {{but many of the}} currently available networks are biased. Towards a true human protein-protein interaction network, we examined literature-based aggregations of lowthroughput experiments, high-throughput experimental networks validated using different strategies, and predicted interaction networks to infer how the underlying interactome may differ from current maps. Using systematically mapped interactome networks, which appear to be the least biased, we explored the functional organization of Arabidopsis thaliana and characterize the <b>asymmetric</b> <b>divergence</b> of duplicated paralogous proteins through their interaction profiles. To further dissect the relationship between interactions and function enforced by evolution, we investigated a first-of-its-kind systematic crossspecies human-yeast hybrid interactome network. Although the cross-species network is topologically similar to conventional intra-species networks, we found signatures of dynamic changes in interaction propensities due to countervailing evolutionary forces. Collectively, these analyses of human, plant and yeast interactome networks bridge separate experiments to characterize bias, function and evolution across eukaryotic kingdoms...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Duplicated genes {{frequently}} experience asymmetric {{rates of}} sequence evolution. Relaxed selective constraints and positive selection {{have both been}} invoked to explain the observation that one paralog within a gene-duplicate pair exhibits an accelerated rate of sequence evolution. In the majority of studies where <b>asymmetric</b> <b>divergence</b> has been established, {{there is no indication}} as to which gene copy, ancestral or derived, is evolving more rapidly. In this study we investigated the effect of local synteny (gene-neighborhood conservation) and codon usage on the sequence evolution of gene duplicates in the S. cerevisiae genome. We further distinguish the gene duplicates into those that originated from a whole-genome duplication (WGD) event (ohnologs) versus small-scale duplications (SSD) to determine if there exist any differences in their patterns of sequence evolution. Results For SSD pairs, the derived copy evolves faster than the ancestral copy. However, there is no relationship between rate asymmetry and synteny conservation (ancestral-like versus derived-like) in ohnologs. mRNA abundance and optimal codon usage as measured by the CAI is lower in the derived SSD copies relative to ancestral paralogs. Moreover, in the case of ohnologs, the faster-evolving copy has lower CAI and lowered expression. Conclusions Together, these results suggest that relaxation of selection for codon usage and gene expression contribute to rate asymmetry in the evolution of duplicated genes and that in SSD pairs, the relaxation of selection stems from the loss of ancestral regulatory information in the derived copy. </p...|$|E
40|$|Bregman divergences are {{important}} distance measures {{that are used}} extensively in data-driven appli-cations such as computer vision, text mining, and speech processing, and are a key focus of interest in machine learning. Answering nearest neighbor (NN) queries under these measures {{is very important in}} these applications and {{has been the subject of}} extensive study, but is problematic because these distance measures lack metric properties like symmetry and the triangle inequality. In this paper, we present the first provably approximate nearest-neighbor (ANN) algorithms. These process queries in O(logn) time for Bregman divergences in fixed dimensional spaces. We also obtain poly logn bounds for a more abstract class of distance measures (containing Bregman divergences) which satisfy certain structural properties. Both of these bounds apply to both the regular <b>asymmetric</b> Bregman <b>divergences</b> as well as their symmetrized versions. To do so, we develop two geometric properties vital to our analysis: a reverse triangle inequality (RTI) and a relaxed triangle inequality called µ-defectiveness where µ is a domain-dependent parameter. Bregman divergences satisfy the RTI but not µ-defectiveness. However, we show that the square root of a Bregman divergence does satisfy µ-defectiveness. This allows us to then utilize both properties in an efficient search data structure that follows the general two-stage paradigm of a ring-tree decomposition followed by a quad tree search used in previous near-neighbor algorithms for Euclidean space and spaces of bounded doubling dimension. Our first algorithm resolves a query for a d-dimensional (1 + ε) -ANN in O (lognε...|$|R
40|$|In {{spite of}} {{increasing}} globalization around the world, {{the effects of}} international trade on economic growth are not very clear.

The model shows how trade between similar countries leads to convergence in economic growth when knowledge spillovers are present, while trade between very <b>asymmetric</b> countries produces <b>divergence</b> and may become trade in a poverty or growth trap.

40|$|We use genetic {{divergence}} at 16 microsatellite loci {{to investigate}} how geographical {{features of the}} Galápagos landscape structure island populations of Darwin’s finches. We compare the three most genetically divergent groups of Darwin’s finches comprising morphologically and ecologically similar allopatric populations: the cactus finches (Geospiza scandens and Geospiza conirostris), the sharp-beaked ground finches (Geospiza difficilis) and the warbler finches (Certhidea olivacea and Certhidea fusca). Evidence of reduced genetic diversity due to drift was limited to warbler finches on small, peripheral islands. Evidence of low levels of recent interisland migration was widespread throughout all three groups. The hypothesis of distance-limited dispersal received the strongest support in cactus and sharp-beaked ground finches as evidenced by patterns of isolation by distance, while warbler finches showed a weaker relationship. Support for the hypothesis that gene flow constrains morphological divergence was only found in one of eight comparisons within these groups. Among warbler finches, genetic divergence was relatively high while phenotypic divergence was low, implicating stabilizing selection rather than constraint due to gene flow. We conclude that the adaptive radiation of Darwin’s finches {{has occurred in the}} presence of ongoing but low levels of gene flow caused by distance-dependent interisland dispersal. Gene flow does not constrain phenotypic divergence, but may augment genetic variation and facilitate evolution due to natural selection. Both microsatellites and mtDNA agree in that subsets of peripheral populations of two older groups are genetically more similar to other species that underwent dramatic morphological change. The apparent decoupling of morphological and molecular evolution may be accounted for by a modification of Lack’s two-stage model of speciation: relative ecological stasis in allopatry followed by secondary contact, ecological interactions and <b>asymmetric</b> phenotypic <b>divergence...</b>|$|R
40|$|Polyploidy {{has played}} a {{spectacular}} role in plant evolution. Through allopolyploidization, two or more divergent genomes are combined into a common nucleus, which is often followed by rapid as well as longer-term genomic and epigenetic responses. However, since mRNA abundance and protein amounts are poorly related, still little is known how the genomic changes associate with or affect the actual plant function and adaption. Within this context, this dissertation specifically explores the evolutionary history of cotton species on the proteomic level, involving natural polyploidization and human-mediated cotton fiber selection. In the work presented here, cotton proteomes of mature seeds and developing fibers were examined to understand the genome-wide proteomic changes accompanying allopolyploidization. Interspecific comparisons of protein composition and expression level among diploid and polyploid cotton species revealed that the allopolyploid cotton display <b>asymmetric</b> proteomic <b>divergence</b> {{with respect to the}} diploid progenitors, which is detailed by describing important phenomena of non-additive expression, expression level dominance and homoeolog expression bias. To understand the genome-wide expression changes associated with domestication, the fiber proteomes represented by four representative developmental stages were studied for two important crop species - G. hirsutum and G. barbadense, using paired wild and domesticated accessions. By contrasting the fiber proteomes and developmental dynamics between wild and domesticated accessions for each species, we were able to characterize the key features of global protein pattern change corresponding to the domestication processes. Furthermore, we identified a number of proteins differentially expressed during fiber development and altered by domestication, as candidate proteins and metabolic processes for functional analyses that may yield insight into domestication and future cotton improvement...|$|R
40|$|As one of {{the most}} conserved genes in vertebrates, FoxP 2 is widely {{involved}} in a number of important physiological and developmental processes. We systematically studied the evolutionary history and functional adaptations of FoxP 2 in teleosts. The duplicated FoxP 2 genes (FoxP 2 a and FoxP 2 b), which were identified in teleosts using synteny and paralogon analysis on genome databases of eight organisms, were probably generated in the teleost-specific whole genome duplication event. A credible classification with FoxP 2, FoxP 2 a and FoxP 2 b in phylogenetic reconstructions confirmed the teleost-specific FoxP 2 duplication. The unavailability of FoxP 2 b in Danio rerio suggests that the gene was deleted through nonfunctionalization of the redundant copy after the Otocephala-Euteleostei split. Heterogeneity in evolutionary rates among clusters consisting of FoxP 2 in Sarcopterygii (Cluster 1), FoxP 2 a in Teleostei (Cluster 2) and FoxP 2 b in Teleostei (Cluster 3), particularly between Clusters 2 and 3, reveals <b>asymmetric</b> functional <b>divergence</b> after the gene duplication. Hierarchical cluster analyses of hydrophobicity profiles demonstrated significant structural divergence among the three clusters with verification of subsequent stepwise discriminant analysis, in which FoxP 2 of Leucoraja erinacea and Lepisosteus oculatus were classified into Cluster 1, whereas FoxP 2 b of Salmo salar was grouped into Cluster 2 rather than Cluster 3. The simulated thermodynamic stability variations of the forkhead box domain (monomer and homodimer) showed remarkable divergence in FoxP 2, FoxP 2 a and FoxP 2 b clusters. Relaxed purifying selection and positive Darwinian selection probably were complementary driving forces for the accelerated evolution of FoxP 2 in ray-finned fishes, especially for the adaptive evolution of FoxP 2 a and FoxP 2 b in teleosts subsequent to the teleost-specific gene duplication...|$|R

The deposited {{article is a}} post-print version. Some supplementary materials are not present in the uploaded version of the article. Gene families often consist of members with diverse expression domains reflecting their functions {{in a wide variety}} of tissues. However, how the expression of individual members, and thus their tissue-specific functions, diversified during the course of gene family expansion is not well understood. In this study, we approached this question through the analysis of the duplication history and transcriptional evolution of a rapidly expanding subfamily of insect Ly 6 genes. We analyzed different insect genomes and identified seven Ly 6 genes that have originated from a single ancestor through sequential duplication within the higher Diptera. We then determined how the original embryonic expression pattern of the founding gene diversified by characterizing its tissue-specific expression in the beetle Tribolium castaneum, the butterfly Bicyclus anynana, and the mosquito Anopheles stephensi and those of its duplicates in three higher dipteran species, representing various stages of the duplication history (Megaselia abdita, Ceratitis capitata, and Drosophila melanogaster). Our results revealed that frequent neofunctionalization episodes contributed to the increased expression breadth of this subfamily and that these events occurred after duplication and speciation events at comparable frequencies. In addition, at each duplication node, we consistently found <b>asymmetric</b> expression <b>divergence.</b> One paralog inherited most of the tissue-specificities of the founder gene, whereas the other paralog evolved drastically reduced expression domains. Our approach attests to the power of combining a well-established duplication history with a comprehensive coverage of representative species in acquiring unequivocal information about the dynamics of gene expression evolution in gene families.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the symmetric and asymmetric {{structure of a}} monsoon depression which formed in the large-scale monsoon trough over northwestern Australia in February 1994 and seeks to isolate the factors contributing to its motion. A day or two after formation, the depression moved in a generally southwestward direction, similar to the motion of an idealised barotropic vortex on a southern hemisphere beta-plane with no environmental flow. The {{extent to which the}} motion of the depression can be interpreted in terms of this simple paradigm is investigated. We identify three phases of quasi-steady motion, first towards the southwest and later towards the west. These are separated by periods when the centre remains almost stationary. We have investigated the deep-layer mean <b>asymmetric</b> vorticity and <b>divergence</b> structures of the depression and its environment {{to determine the extent to}} which the associated flow across the vortex centre can account for the depression’s motion. In Phase 1 the cross-vortex flow is influenced approximately equally by azimuthal wavenumber-one streamfunction asymmetries representing the flow of larger and equal or smaller horizontal scales compared with the scale of the monsoon depression. Furthermore, wavenumber-one velocity potential asymmetries of equal or smaller horizontal scales make a nonnegligible contribution to this flow. In Phase 2 the cross-vortex flow is dominated by streamfunction asymmetries of equal or smaller horizontal scales and in Phase 3 the large-scale streamfunction asymmetry dominates. In Phase 2, the streamfunction asymmetry closely resembles the beta-gyres in a barotropic model calculation. However, examination of the deep-layer mean vorticity analyses shows that there is at no time a clear-scale separation between the depression and its environment as is normally assumed in idealised model calculations...|$|R
40|$|The {{waves of}} the worst global {{financial}} and economic crisis since World War II have seriously affected {{the economy of the}} Euro Area. The first wave of the global crisis determined the worst recession in decades for the member states of the region. At present, the Monetary Union is confronted with the second wave of the crisis â€“ the public debt problem. Despite the efforts adopted and implemented by the European policymakers over the past quarters, the sovereign debt crisis is far from over. Spain has recently become the â€œfavourite targetâ€ of the financial markets. Among the consequences of the {{waves of the}} crisis for the Euro Area one can mention the potential output decline and the economic <b>divergence</b> (<b>asymmetric</b> evolution of member countries). In this context, the potential output recovery and the relaunch of the real economic convergence process represent the main challenges for the policymakers in the medium run. This paper analyses the evolution of potential GDP of the member countries of European Monetary Union (12). I employ the Hodrick-Prescott methodology on data from the World Bank Database. According to the results, the economic potential of the member states of the Euro Area (12) decreased to the lowest level of the past decades. At the same time, the analysis presents the differences exiting across the member states in terms of potential output. Some countries suffered an important potential output loss over the past quarters (it seems that Greece and Portugal have become asymmetric shocks in the Monetary Union). For these countries, the first wave of the global crisis transformed in a permanent shock. The decline of investments and the depreciation of human capital over the past quarters express a huge probability that potential output is going to maintain at a low level in the Euro Area over the following years. The recovery of potential GDP towards the pre-crisis levels is dependent on a higher participation rate of active population, strong reforms of labour markets and, importantly, the return of investment flows. Other measures in order to attain the objectives of Europe 2020 (smart, sustainable and inclusive growth) would also help the process of potential GDP recovery in Europe...|$|R
