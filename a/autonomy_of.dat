5|$|Academics have {{expressed}} scepticism {{as to whether}} the doctrine of legitimate expectation should apply to substantive rights. Thio Li-ann argues that legitimate expectations should relate only to procedural rather than substantive rights. Procedural protection only has a minimal impact on the administrative <b>autonomy</b> <b>of</b> the relevant public authority, since the court is only concerned with {{the manner in which the}} decision was made and not whether the decision was fair. Thus, the ultimate <b>autonomy</b> <b>of</b> public authorities is never placed in jeopardy. Conversely, as Mark Elliot posits, giving effect to a substantive legitimate expectation impinges on the separation of powers. The authority has been entrusted by Parliament to make decisions about the allocation of resources in public interest. Applying legitimate expectation substantively allows the courts to inquire into the merits of the decision. Such interference with the public authority's discretion would be overstepping their role and exceeding their proper constitutional function.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} the authors {{consider}} forms <b>of</b> <b>autonomy,</b> forms <b>of</b> semiotic systems, and any necessary relations among them.

Forms <b>of</b> <b>autonomy</b> or closure in systems are also recognized, including physical, dynamical, functional, and semiotic. Models and controls are canonical linear and circular (closed) semiotic relations respectively.

In particular, all control systems display at least a minimal degree of semiotic autonomy; and all systems with sufficiently interesting functional autonomy are semiotically related to their environments...|$|R

In January 1990, the Communist Party fragmented along national lines, with the Croatian faction demanding a looser federation. In the same year, the first multi-party elections were held in Croatia, with Franjo Tuđman's win raising nationalist tensions further. Some of Serbs in Croatia left Sabor and declared the <b>autonomy</b> <b>of</b> areas that would soon become the unrecognised Republic of Serbian Krajina, intent on achieving independence from Croatia.|$|E

5|$|Habermas {{argues that}} his ethical theory is an {{improvement}} on Kant's ethics. He rejects the dualistic framework of Kant's ethics. Kant distinguished between the phenomena world, {{which can be}} sensed and experienced by humans, and the noumena, or spiritual world, which is inaccessible to humans. This dichotomy was necessary for Kant because it could explain the <b>autonomy</b> <b>of</b> a human agent: although a human is bound in the phenomenal world, their actions are free in the intelligible world. For Habermas, morality arises from discourse, which is made necessary by their rationality and needs, rather than their freedom.|$|E

40|$|We {{argue that}} {{contemporary}} {{research on the}} influence <b>of</b> organisational <b>autonomy</b> on performance in public organisations uses a diverse and a too restrictive conceptualisation <b>of</b> <b>autonomy.</b> After discussing that research, the article develops six dimensions of the concept <b>of</b> <b>autonomy</b> in public organisations.

Third, data from a survey of Flemish public organisations illuminate the need to acknowledge the six different dimensions <b>of</b> <b>autonomy</b> when studying the effect <b>of</b> <b>autonomy</b> on performance. The empirical material points at the dangers of using formal-legal status of a public organisation as an indicator <b>of</b> its <b>autonomy,</b> given substantial heterogeneity of organisations with the same formal-legal status on each dimension <b>of</b> <b>autonomy.</b> Moreover, tensions between different levels <b>of</b> <b>autonomy</b> appear in practice, indicating {{the need for a}} combined and integrated study {{of the effects of the}} different dimensions <b>of</b> <b>autonomy</b> on performance...|$|R

5|$|The {{politically}} unstable {{situation that}} followed in Greece {{during the next}} months, with the National Schism between royalists and Venizelos’ supporters, divided Greece into two states.

An exception was Korçë which was retaken by French forces from Bulgarian occupation, and turned into the Autonomous Albanian Republic of Korçë under the military protection of the French army.

5|$|Among the bishops, {{only two}} stood out as {{significant}} political figures, the more prominent {{of whom was}} Robert Winchelsey, Archbishop of Canterbury. Long a formidable presence in English public life, Winchelsey had led the struggle against Edward I to uphold the <b>autonomy</b> <b>of</b> the church, and for this he had paid with suspension and exile. One of Edward II’s first acts as king had been to reinstate Winchelsey, but rather than responding with grateful loyalty, the archbishop soon reassumed {{a leadership role in}} the fight against the king. Although he was trying to appease Winchelsey, the king carried an old grudge against another prelate, Walter Langton, Bishop of Lichfield. Edward had Langton dismissed from his position as treasurer of the Exchequer and had his temporal possessions confiscated. Langton had been an opponent of Winchelsey during the previous reign, but Edward II’s move against Langton drew the two Ordainers together.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{determine}} the association of college student smokers' perceptions of nicotine dependence and measurements <b>of</b> loss <b>of</b> <b>autonomy.</b> The participants <b>of</b> the study were students enrolled in 7 randomly selected large (N > 170) core curriculum classes at Ball State University, during spring semester 2003. Using a cross-sectional data collection process, participants completed a 33 item survey consisting of questions from the Hooked on Nicotine Checklist and National College Health Risk Behavior Survey. The design of this study was to determine whether student smokers' perceive themselves as dependent on nicotine and how this was associated with a measurement on a loss <b>of</b> <b>autonomy</b> scale. Descriptive statistics, chi square, and univariate analyses were used to analyze the data. The majority, 64 %, of participants had smoked sometime in their life, with 30 % being classified as current smokers. Significant associations were found between the following variables: loss <b>of</b> <b>autonomy</b> and participants' perceptions of nicotine dependence, loss <b>of</b> <b>autonomy</b> and amount <b>of</b> cigarettes smoked, loss <b>of</b> <b>autonomy</b> and the number of years smoked, and perceptions of addiction and the number of years smoked.

5|$|At {{about the}} same time that Villa and Orozco were marching on Ciudad Juárez, the Zapatista revolt {{gathered}} strength and spread to the states of Puebla, Tlaxcala, Mexico, Michoacán and Guerrero. On April 14, Madero had Emiliano Zapata officially designated as his representative in the region. However, Zapata was worried that if he did not fully control all the major towns in Morelos by the time that Madero concluded negotiations with Díaz, the demands of his agrarian movement and the issue of the <b>autonomy</b> <b>of</b> Morelos would be ignored or sidelined. Zapata's first military action was to take the town of Chinameca where he obtained essential supplies. Subsequently, Zapata, for political and strategic reasons, decided to attack the city of Cuautla. In order to mislead his opponents however, he initially attacked and captured the towns of Izúcar de Matamoros (which was subsequently retaken by federal forces) and Chietla. From there he made a wide circle around Cuautla and captured Yautepec and Jonacatepec where he gathered more supplies, munitions and soldiers. By May, out of all the major urban centers in the region, only Cuautla and the capital of Morelos, Cuernavaca, remained outside of his control.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of Justinian I's reign he had {{inherited}} a surplus 28,800,000 solidi (400,000 pounds of gold) in the imperial treasury from Anastasius I and Justin I. Under Justinian's rule, measures were taken to counter corruption in the provinces and to make tax collection more efficient. Greater administrative power was given to both {{the leaders of the}} prefectures and of the provinces, while power was taken away from the vicariates of the dioceses, of which a number were abolished. The overall trend was towards a simplification of administrative infrastructure. According to Brown (1971), the increased professionalization of tax collection did much to destroy the traditional structures of provincial life, as it weakened the <b>autonomy</b> <b>of</b> the town councils in the Greek towns. It has been estimated that before Justinian I's reconquests the state had an annual revenue of 5,000,000 solidi in AD 530, but after his reconquests, the annual revenue was increased to 6,000,000 solidi in AD 550.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, Bosch's work enjoyed a popular resurrection.

Miró's The Tilled Field contains several parallels to Bosch's Garden: similar flocks of birds; pools from which living creatures emerge; and oversize disembodied ears all echo the Dutch master's work.

40|$|ABSTRACT The term {{autonomy}} literally {{refers to}} regulation by the self. Its opposite, heteronomy, refers to controlled regulation, or regulation that occurs without self-endorsement. At {{a time when}} philosophers and economists are increasingly detailing the nature <b>of</b> <b>autonomy</b> and recognizing its social and practical significance, many psychologists are questioning the reality and import <b>of</b> <b>autonomy</b> and closely related phenomena such as will, choice, and freedom. Using the framework of selfdetermination theory (Ryan & Deci, 2000), we review research concerning the benefits of autonomous versus controlled regulation for goal performance, persistence, affective experience, quality of relationships, and well-being across domains and cultures. We also {{address some of the}} controversies and terminological issues surrounding the construct <b>of</b> <b>autonomy,</b> including critiques <b>of</b> <b>autonomy</b> by biological reductionists, cultural relativists, and behaviorists. We conclude that there is a universal and cross-developmental value to autonomous regulation when the construct is understood in an exacting way. The concept <b>of</b> <b>autonomy</b> has become increasingly accepted, refined, and applied within the discipline of philosophy (Friedman, 2003). Indeed, Taylor (2005) argued that the nature and value <b>of</b> <b>autonomy</b> are now common topics within philosophy and that these discussions <b>of</b> <b>autonomy</b> are ‘‘underpinned by an increasingly flourishing an...|$|R
