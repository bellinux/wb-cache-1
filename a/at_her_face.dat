25|$|Piper {{received}} numerous {{phone calls}} and apologies from Lynch. On 31 March 2008, {{two days after the}} initial attack, Lynch persuaded Piper to go to an internet cafe to read an email he had sent to her Facebook account. Lynch gave her details to Stefan Sylvestre, who identified her on Golders Green Road. Wearing a hoodie to obscure his identity, Sylvestre approached Piper, who {{thought he was going to}} ask for money, and then threw sulphuric acid <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b>|$|E

2500|$|On July 31, 2007, Donaire met Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. Donaire {{said the}} {{experience}} was, [...] "an overwhelming feeling. It was indescribable. The moment I {{walked up the}} stairs and she was up there and when I looked it was a moment when I couldn't even look <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> It was a great honor." [...] Then, on December 1, 2007, Donaire made the first defense of his IBF title against Luis Maldonado of Mexico by a technical knockout in the eighth round. Donaire said, [...] "I guess my validation was today but I didn't feel my best; I felt sluggish. I didn't have my legs. I don't know what the problem was. I couldn't move well so I tried to rely on my upper body movement." ...|$|E
60|$|The Prince {{looked hard}} <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> <b>Her</b> <b>face</b> {{was white and}} set. He sighed.|$|R
60|$|Ozma made {{no reply}} <b>at</b> once. <b>Her</b> <b>face</b> was grave and thoughtful.|$|R
60|$|She {{turned and}} looked <b>at</b> him. <b>Her</b> <b>face</b> {{scarcely}} reflected his enthusiasm.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked down}} <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> luminous, quivering with excitement--and understood.|$|E
60|$|Rand {{would have}} hesitated, but, with another look <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> complied.|$|E
60|$|I {{was staring}} <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> It seemed white {{and set in}} the dimness.|$|E
60|$|She shivered all over. She looked <b>at</b> him, <b>her</b> <b>face</b> was {{suddenly}} strained.|$|R
60|$|The old {{cattleman}} stood mute before <b>her,</b> staring <b>at</b> <b>her</b> white <b>face,</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> eyes of flame.|$|R
60|$|Something in {{her voice}} {{compelled}} the man's attention. He looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> white <b>face.</b>|$|R
60|$|His {{tone was}} playful, but his eyes, {{directed}} <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> were serious. She protested.|$|E
60|$|He was {{speechless}} and abashed, and could only stare <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> which was white with anger.|$|E
60|$|He obeyed, and glancing <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> {{saw that}} it was very calm and cold as winter ice.|$|E
60|$|She laughed <b>at</b> him. <b>Her</b> <b>face</b> was {{a little}} drawn with pain {{but her eyes were}} very soft.|$|R
60|$|For {{some moments}} {{he did not}} move. Then he rose slowly and went across the hearth. It {{required}} an almost deathly effort of volition, or of acquiescence. He stood before her and looked down <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> <b>Her</b> <b>face</b> was shining again, her eyes were shining again like terrible laughter. It was to him terrible, how she could be transfigured. He could not look <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> it burnt his heart.|$|R
60|$|Bob {{looked and}} looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> side <b>face</b> till he was bewitched into putting down his brush.|$|R
60|$|One look <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> {{told me that}} I {{could trust}} her. I {{addressed}} myself again to Mr. Bruff.|$|E
60|$|The man was {{not only}} {{surprised}} but agitated. He loosened the child's hold {{so as to be}} able to look <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b>|$|E
60|$|He stopped, breathless. He {{could say}} no more because of the beating of his heart. And he dared not look <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>face....</b>|$|E
60|$|Ethel {{appeared}} in the half doorway and her, expression was unfamiliar. He stared <b>at</b> <b>her</b> white <b>face.</b>|$|R
60|$|When {{she came}} in <b>at</b> last, <b>her</b> <b>face</b> stung to radiant beauty by the {{northwest}} wind, she {{found it hard to}} tell them after all. She looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> mother appealingly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mrs. Vandemeyer came {{round the}} screen <b>at</b> once. <b>Her</b> <b>face</b> was so wicked I nearly died, but I smiled up <b>at</b> <b>her</b> doubtfully, {{and asked her}} in French where I was.|$|R
60|$|Nutty looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> {{and decided}} not to make it worse. But his anguish demanded some outlet. He found it in soliloquy.|$|E
60|$|Mary Louise {{laughed so}} heartily {{that the boy}} cast an upward, half- {{approving}} glance <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> Even Mr. Conant's stern visage relaxed.|$|E
6000|$|... "It wasn't labored; I {{believe it}} was a flash of insight," [...] Andrew declared. He glanced <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> and laughed, looking baffled.|$|E
6000|$|Shelton shot {{another look}} <b>at</b> Antonia; <b>her</b> <b>face</b> was frigid. [...] "I hate your d---d superiority!" [...] he thought, {{staring at the}} Connoisseur.|$|R
60|$|Sir Patrick looked round <b>at</b> Blanche. <b>Her</b> <b>face</b> {{was hidden}} in her hands. Her step-mother was vainly {{appealing}} {{to her to}} compose herself.|$|R
6000|$|He looked <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> <b>Her</b> <b>face</b> {{was pale}} {{for want of}} sleep, and drawn and haggard. He came to a sudden resolution. [...] "We must go back," [...] he said.|$|R
60|$|A covert glance <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> as {{he walked}} beside her, showed him {{that she had not}} {{expected}} his ready assent to that proposition.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Morton doesn't flatter," [...] said Mrs. Bowen thoughtfully, {{turning the}} feather screen she held <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> now edgewise, now flatwise, toward Colville.|$|E
60|$|He spak {{a word in}} jest; Her {{answer was}} na good; He threw a plate <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> Made it a' gush out o' blood.|$|E
6000|$|... "When {{you give}} me proof of that, I shall believe it," [...] the girl replied. The Marquise looked <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> manifesting no offence at the almost {{insulting}} words.|$|R
60|$|As I looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> {{beautiful}} <b>face,</b> observant of <b>her</b> work, {{she raised}} her mild clear eyes, and saw that I was looking <b>at</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|Fort {{struggled}} up, {{and stared}} <b>at</b> <b>her.</b> His <b>face</b> was comic from bewilderment, and she {{broke into a}} little nervous laugh.|$|R
