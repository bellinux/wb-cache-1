5|$|Compton {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} X-rays on the sodium and chlorine nuclei in salt. He used X-rays to investigate ferromagnetism, concluding {{that it was a}} result of the alignment of electron spins. In 1926, he became a consultant for the Lamp Department at General Electric. In 1934, he returned to England as Eastman visiting professor at Oxford University. While there General Electric asked him to report on activities at General Electric Company plc's research laboratory at Wembley. Compton was intrigued by the possibilities of the research there into fluorescent lamps. His report prompted a research program in <b>America</b> <b>that</b> developed it.|$|E

5|$|In the 17th {{century the}} town was at the centre of Puritan {{emigration}} to America, and the local rector, John White, organised the settlement of Dorchester, Massachusetts. The first colonisation attempted was at Cape Ann, where fishermen who would rejoin the fishing fleet when the vessels returned the next year, tried to be self-sufficient. However, the land was unsuitable, the colony failed and was moved {{to what is now}} Salem. In 1628 the enterprise received a Royal Charter and the Massachusetts Bay Company was formed with three hundred colonists arriving in <b>America</b> <b>that</b> year and more the following year.|$|E

5|$|The Spanish {{established}} Comayagua, originally called Nueva Valladolid de Comayagua ("New Valladolid of Comayagua") and Valle de Santa María de Comayagua ("Valley of Saint Mary of Comayagua"), {{as one of}} four top-tier gobiernos in Central <b>America</b> <b>that</b> {{served as}} administrative centres for commerce and industry. They established less important centres, such as Tegucigalpa, as alcaldías mayores, and more sparsely colonised areas as corregimientos. A number of indigenous settlements, referred to as pueblos de indios ("Indian villages"), comprised a corregimiento. The colonial corregidor governed the corregimiento, but the Spanish also appointed native officials, including the alcalde (or mayor) and his regidores, or councillors. All levels of colonial government were concerned with the collection of tribute and the organisation of native labour.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} {{conceived}} in 1985 by Ron Gilbert and Gary Winnick, {{who sought to}} tell a comedic story based on horror film and B-movie clichés. They mapped out the project as a paper-and-pencil game before coding commenced. While earlier adventure titles had relied on command lines, Gilbert disliked such systems, and he developed Maniac Mansions simpler point-and-click interface as a replacement. To speed up production, he created a game engine called SCUMM, which was used in many later LucasArts titles. After its release, Maniac Mansion was ported to several platforms. A port for the Nintendo Entertainment System had to be reworked heavily, in response to complaints by Nintendo of <b>America</b> <b>that</b> the game was inappropriate for children.|$|E

On the whole, the establishment of weather ships proved to be so useful during World War II for Europe and North <b>America</b> <b>that</b> the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) established a global network of weather ships in 1948, with 13 to be supplied by Canada, the United States, and Europe.
