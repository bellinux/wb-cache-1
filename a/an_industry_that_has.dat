2500|$|In 2016, Berkshire {{surprised}} investors {{by making}} large equity {{investments in the}} major US airlines. Buffett had previously described airlines as a [...] "deathtrap for investors". Buffett had made an investment in US Airways in 1989 which, although he sold for a profit, almost lost Berkshire a substantial sum of money. As of 2017, Berkshire is currently the largest shareholder in United Airlines and Delta Air Lines and a top 3 shareholder in Southwest Airlines and American Airlines. Buffett himself has described this as a [...] "call on the industry" [...] rather than a choice in an individual company. American Airline's CEO Doug Parker {{is said to have}} won over Ted Weschler in arguing that the airline industry had consolidated sufficiently and rationalised supply such that longer term profitability could be achieved in <b>an</b> <b>industry</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> historically been loss making in aggregate.|$|E

Until the 1960s, the raising of sheep and the commercialization of wool was also important on the island. This was until a change in forestry policy forced many farmers to vacate uncultivated lands, lands that were routinely used to graze sheep. It was quickly the end of the wool industry on the island, <b>an</b> <b>industry</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> been integral to the island's small export industry.|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{empirical}} analysis of {{two types of}} <b>industry</b> clusters: clusters <b>that</b> arise exogenously due to natural advantages, and endogenously formed clusters.

The Bio-Medical industry was chosen as <b>an</b> <b>industry</b> <b>that</b> would <b>have</b> clusters <b>that</b> formed endogenously. The evidence suggests <b>that</b> these two <b>industries</b> <b>have</b> clusters <b>that</b> experience very different firm performance gains and losses in comparison to other non-clustered firms in their industries. The Oil and Gas industry has positive performance and growth associated with firms inside clusters. The Bio-Medical industry has negative performance and growth associated with firms inside clusters...|$|R
