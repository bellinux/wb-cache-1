5|$|Biogas, or {{landfill}} gas, is a biofuel produced {{through the}} intermediary stage of <b>anaerobic</b> <b>digestion</b> consisting mainly of 45–90% biologically produced methane and carbon dioxide. In early 2007 a thermophilic <b>anaerobic</b> <b>digestion</b> facility was commissioned in Stornoway in the Western Isles. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) and the Renewable Energy Association are also {{leading the way}} towards {{the establishment of a}} digestate standard to facilitate the use of solid outputs from digesters on land. <b>Anaerobic</b> <b>digestion</b> and mechanical biological treatment facilities have been planned at a number of other locations in Scotland, such as Westray.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, a {{contract}} {{for the construction of}} a mesophilic <b>anaerobic</b> <b>digestion</b> facility was awarded, including the construction of buildings and various other pieces of equipment required for the treatment of sludge. Mesophilic <b>anaerobic</b> <b>digestion</b> enables the breaking down of biodegradable materials using micro-organisms under moderate temperatures. The new sludge treatment facility enables the recycled sludge to be used on neighbouring farmlands as manure, and also enables Yorkshire Water to generate 1.9MW of renewable energy using combined heat and power units.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{recognised}} that biogas (mainly methane) – produced from the <b>anaerobic</b> <b>digestion</b> {{of organic matter}} – is potentially a valuable and prolific feedstock. It is estimated that 0.4 GW of generating capacity might be available from agricultural waste in Scotland. The Scottish Executive and SEPA has funded seven small scale farm trial plants with the British <b>anaerobic</b> <b>digestion</b> company Greenfinch in Southwest Scotland. Landfill sites {{have the potential for}} a further 0.07 GW with sites such as the Avondale Landfill in Falkirk already utilising their potential.|$|E
40|$|Batch <b>anaerobic</b> <b>digestions</b> were {{performed}} in 160 ml serum vials, cellulose (1 % wt) {{was the sole}} added carbon source. All reactors were inoculated with a 10 % (v/v) leachate inoculum. The concentration of micro-organisms in the leachate inoculums was increased using centrifugation to investigate the effect of initial biomass on hydrolysis performance. The hydrolysis rate constant for digestions with the highest initial biomass was 0. 14 day− 1 compared to 0. 06 day− 1 in digestions with the lowest initial biomass. The {{results of this study}} indicate that hydrolysis performance is related to initial biomass concentrations. This is an ongoing project...|$|R

40|$|Using a {{previously}} developed filter adsorption technique, the inactivation {{of a human}} rotavirus, a coxsackievirus B 5, and a bovine parvovirus was monitored during sludge treatment processes. During conventional <b>anaerobic</b> mesophilic <b>digestion</b> at 35 to 36 degrees C, only minor inactivation of all three viruses occurred. The k' values measured were 0. 314 log 10 unit/day for rotavirus, 0. 475 log 10 unit/day for coxsackievirus B 5, and 0. 944 log 10 unit/day for parvovirus. However, <b>anaerobic</b> thermophilic <b>digestion</b> at 54 to 56 degrees C led to rapid inactivation of rotavirus (k' greater than 8. 5 log 10 units/h) and of coxsackievirus B 5 (k' greater than 0. 93 log 10 unit/min). Similarly, aerobic thermophilic fermentation at 60 to 61 degrees C rapidly inactivated rotavirus (k' = 0. 75 log 10 unit/min) and coxsackievirus B 5 (k' greater than 1. 67 log 10 units/min). Infectivity of parvovirus, however, was only reduced by 0. 213 log 10 unit/h during <b>anaerobic</b> thermophilic <b>digestion</b> and by 0. 353 log 10 unit/h during aerobic thermophilic fermentation. Furthermore, pasteurization at 70 degrees C for 30 min inactivated the parvovirus by 0. 72 log 10 unit/ 30 min. In all experiments the contribution of temperature to the total inactivation was determined separately and {{was found to be}} predominant at process temperatures above 54 degrees C. In conclusion, the most favorable treatment to render sludge hygienically safe from the virological point of view would be a thermal treatment (60 degrees C) to inactivate thermolabile viruses, followed by an <b>anaerobic</b> mesophilic <b>digestion</b> to eliminate thermostable viruses that are more sensitive to chemical and microbial inactivations...|$|R
5|$|Sewage {{treatment}} works depend {{for their}} ability to clean up water contaminated with organic material on microorganisms that can respire dissolved substances. Respiration may be aerobic, with a well-oxygenated filter bed such as a slow sand filter. <b>Anaerobic</b> <b>digestion</b> by methanogens generate useful methane gas as a by-product.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the range of applications of archaean enzymes, {{the use of the}} organisms themselves in biotechnology is less developed. Methanogenic archaea are a vital part of sewage treatment, since {{they are part of the}} community of microorganisms that carry out <b>anaerobic</b> <b>digestion</b> and produce biogas. In mineral processing, acidophilic archaea display promise for the extraction of metals from ores, including gold, cobalt and copper.|$|E
25|$|Some systems {{incorporate}} both <b>anaerobic</b> <b>digestion</b> and composting. This {{may either}} {{take the form}} of a full <b>anaerobic</b> <b>digestion</b> phase, followed by the maturation (composting) of the digestate. Alternatively a partial <b>anaerobic</b> <b>digestion</b> phase can be induced on water that is percolated through the raw waste, dissolving the readily available sugars, with the remaining material being sent to a windrow composting facility.|$|E
40|$|Appropriate {{sewage sludge}} {{rheological}} models {{are essential for}} computational fluid dynamic simulation of wastewater treatment processes, in particular aerobic and <b>anaerobic</b> <b>digestions.</b> The liquid-like behaviour of sludge is well documented but the solid-like behaviour remains poorly described despite its importance for dead-zone formation. In this study, classical Kelvin-Voigt model, commonly used for sludge in literature, were compared with fractional derivative Kelvin-Voigt model regarding their predictive ability for describing the solid-like behaviour. Results showed that the fractional Kelvin-Voigt model best fitted the experimental data obtained from creep and frequency sweep tests. Whereas, classical Kelvin-Voigt could not fit the frequency sweep data as this model is not a function of angular velocity. Also, the Kelvin-Voigt model was unable to predict the creep data at low stresses...|$|R

40|$|The {{process of}} high solid <b>anaerobic</b> <b>digestions</b> (HSAD) was {{developed}} to reduce water usage, increase organic loading rate (OLR), reduce nutrient loss in digestate and avoid or decrease the dewatering of digestate. However, the operation of HSAD is currently constrained by low rates and extents of methane production high operational costs. Several published investigations have been conducted to {{study the effects of}} inhibition, temperature, moisture, and reactor design on the efficiency of HSAD. However, low moisture and poor mixing, which are required for the dilution and diffusion of metabolites, have been reported to be the major causes of low methane yield in HSAD. In order to optimize the operation of HSAD, technological integration has to be considered, especially thermo–mesophilic digestion, co-digestion, mixing and integration of two or more reactors. This paper provides a critical review of recent research on HSAD while focusing on how these studies can be integrated to improve HSAD...|$|R
40|$|Municipal {{wastewater}} treatment {{has long been}} known as a high-cost and energy-intensive process that destroys most of the energy-containing molecules by spending energy and that leaves little energy and few nutrients available for reuse. Over the past few years, some {{wastewater treatment}} plants have tried to revamp themselves as “resource factories,” enabled by new technologies and the upgrading of old technologies. In particular, there is an renewed interest in anaerobic biotechnologies, which can convert organic matter into usable energy and preserve nutrients for potential reuse. However, considerable technological and economic limitations still exist. Here, we provide an overview of recent advances in several cutting-edge anaerobic biotechnologies for wastewater treatment, including enhanced side-stream <b>anaerobic</b> sludge <b>digestion,</b> <b>anaerobic</b> membrane bioreactors, and microbial electrochemical systems, and discuss future challenges and opportunities for their applications.

40|$|A thermo-alkaline {{treatment}} with air stripping was applied before <b>anaerobic</b> sludge <b>digestion</b> for both siloxane removal and sludge disintegration. The treatment {{was expected to}} increase the amount of biogas produced and to reduce the amount of siloxane in the gas. Adding sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to the sludge improved the removal of siloxane from the sludge, with approximately 90 % of the siloxane removed to the gas phase using a thermo-alkaline treatment. Over 80 % of decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (D 5) could be removed under the following conditions: 55 °C treatment temperature, 135 g-NaOH kg 1 volatile total solids (VTS), and 0. 5 L min 1 air-stripping rate. The disintegration ratio of volatile suspended solids (VSS) in the sludge was correlated with the D 5 removal ratio. Because most of the siloxane was adsorbed to, or was contained in the VSS, the siloxane removal ratio increased with VSS disintegration. Finally, the energy consumption and operational costs of this system were evaluated for several scenar- ios. Thermo-alkaline treatment at the indicated operational conditions had the lowest operating costs for a 400 m 3 day 1 <b>anaerobic</b> sludge <b>digestion</b> system. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBiogas {{originates}} from {{bacteria in}} the process of biological breakdown of organic material under anaerobic conditions. A research work was conducted to investigate the production ability of biogas from mesophilic <b>anaerobic</b> <b>digestions</b> of cow dung (CD) using silica gel as catalyst. Two laboratory scale digesters were constructed to digest cow dung, where one set-up was used for digestion of cow dung without catalyst and the other set-up was used for digestion with catalyst. The digesters were made of glass conical flask of 1 -liter capacity each. Cow dung was used 390 gm and water was used 310 gm in each experiment. In the slurry, total solid content was maintained 8 % (wt.) for all the observations. The digesters were fed on batch basis. The digesters were operated at ambient temperatures of 27 – 31 °C. The total gas yield was obtained about 27. 3 L/kg CD for digestion without catalyst and about 30. 5 L/kg of CD for digestion with catalyst. The retention time was about 76 days for both the digestions. The gas yields were compared with the previous work of mesophilic digestions of cow dung without catalyst of operating temperatures 18 – 28 °C...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the effect of feedstock ratios in biogas production, anaerobic co-digestions of rice straw with kitchen waste and pig manure were carried out. A series of single-stage batch mesophilic (37 +/- 1 degrees C) <b>anaerobic</b> <b>digestions</b> were performed at a substrate concentration of 54 g/L based on volatile solids (VS). The {{results showed that the}} optimal ratio of kitchen waste, pig manure, and rice straw was 0. 4 : 1. 6 : 1, for which the C/N ratio was 21. 7. The methane content was 45. 9 - 70. 0 % and rate of VS reduction was 55. 8 %. The biogas yield of 674. 4 L/kg VS was higher than that of the digestion of rice straw or pig manure alone by 71. 67 % and 10. 41 %, respectively. Inhibition of biogas production by volatile fatty acids (VFA) occurred when the addition of kitchen waste was greater than 26 %. The VFA analysis showed that, in the reactors that successfully produced biogas, the dominant intermediate metabolites were propionate and acetate, while they were lactic acid, acetate, and propionate in the others.

40|$|Partial {{nitritation}} and Anammox {{processes are}} increasingly used for nitrogen removal from <b>anaerobic</b> sludge <b>digestion</b> liquor. However, their nitrogen removal efficiency is often limited {{due to the}} production of nitrate by the Anammox reaction and the sensitivity to the nitrite to ammonium ratio. This work develops and demonstrates an innovative process that achieves complete nitrogen removal from partially nitrified <b>anaerobic</b> sludge <b>digestion</b> liquor {{through the use of a}} membrane biofilm reactor (MBfR), with methane supplied through hollow fiber membranes. When steady state with a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 1 day was reached, the process achieved complete nitrite and ammonium removal at rates of 560 mg N/L/d and 470 mg N/L/d, respectively, without any nitrate accumulation. The process is relatively insensitive to the nitrite to ammonium ratio, achieving complete nitrogen removal when their ratio in influent varied in the range of 1. 125 - 1. 32. Pyrosequencing and fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis revealed that denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidation (DAMO) archaea, Anammox bacteria and DAMO bacteria jointly dominated the microbial community. Mass balance analysis showed that nitrate produced by Anammox (122. 2 mg N/L/d) was entirely converted to nitrite by DAMO archaea, while nitrite in the feed and produced by DAMO archaea was jointly removed by Anammox (90 %) and DAMO bacteria (10 %). The nitrogen removal rate of over 1 kg N/m/d is comparable to the practical rates reported for side-stream nitrogen removal processes...|$|R

40|$|Nitrous oxide (N 2 O) {{emissions}} from nitritation reactors receiving real <b>anaerobic</b> sludge <b>digestion</b> liquor {{have been reported}} to be substantially higher than those from reactors receiving synthetic digestion liquor. This study aims to identify the causes for the difference, and to develop strategies to reduce N 2 O {{emissions from}} reactors treating real digestion liquor. Two sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) performing nitritation, fed with real (SBR-R) and synthetic (SBR-S) digestion liquors, respectively, were employed. The N 2 O emission factors for SBR-R and SBR-S were determined to be 3. 12 % and 0. 80 % of the View the MathML source-N oxidized, respectively. Heterotrophic denitrification supported by the organic carbon present in the real digestion liquor was found to be the key contributor to the higher N 2 O emission from SBR-R. Heterotrophic nitrite reduction likely stopped at N 2 O (rather than N 2), with a hypothesised cause being free nitrous acid inhibition. This implies that all nitrite reduced by heterotrophic bacteria was converted to and emitted as N 2 O. Increasing dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration from 0. 5 to 1. 0 mg/L, or above, decreased aerobic N 2 O production from 2. 0 % to 0. 5 % in SBR-R, whereas aerobic N 2 O production in SBR-S remained almost unchanged (at approximately 0. 5 %). We hypothesised that DO at 1 mg/L or above suppressed heterotrophic nitrite reduction thus reduced aerobic heterotrophic N 2 O production. We recommend that DO in a nitritation system receiving <b>anaerobic</b> sludge <b>digestion</b> liquor should be maintained at approximately 1 mg/L to minimise N 2 O emission. No Full Tex...|$|R
