In {{order to gain}} patients' acceptance the system has to be miniaturized to a magnitude that image acquisition, image processing, and power supply can be integrated into a portable unit. A CMOS camera whose dynamic range covers more than 100 dB takes pictures of the scenery. Its image sensor has a resolution of 380 x 300 pixel. In order to reduce fixed pattern noise correlated double sampling is implemented on-chip.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} a compact Radar for real-time detection of targets in smart mobility applications. The Radar integrates Fabry–Perot resonating antennas, X-band and configurable continuous wave transceiver, high-speed <b>analog-digital-converter</b> and low-power/low-cost FPGA for the baseband signal processing. The latter includes region-of-interest selection, 2 D Fast Fourier Transform for range-Doppler map extraction, peak detection and alarm decision logic. The transmitted power can be configured from few mW to 1. 8 W. This allows for a trade-off between the maximum detection range, from few hundreds of meters up to 1. 54 km, and the Radar power consumption, from 2. 56 W to 11. 66 W. The measured speed is up to 40 m/s. The speed and distance resolutions are 0. 3 m/s and 37. 5 cm, respectively. The configurable Radar features increased robustness vs. laser-scanners, video cameras, or induction loops detection techniques, and stands for its better trade-off in terms of covered range, size, and low-power consumption vs. state-of-the-art surveillance Radars...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project {{was to create a}} network of sensors and {{software}} that would let the consumer monitor the product that was purchased from Parker Hannifin. This information was to be wirelessly transmitted to a computer that a technician would carry around and download to view the performance of the system that the network of sensors was built for. The telemetry module would be sufficiently flexible to handle the expansion of various types of telemetry inputs without large additional investment in telemetry collection hardware. The module controller would store, process and transmit the data to a remote station wirelessly over a certain distance. The wireless telemetry system is composed of the following components: pressure sensors, thermistor, thermocouples, motor speed sensor, data acquisition system, microprocessor, internal flash memory, wireless transmitter, wireless receiver, computer and a custom program that will decipher the information downloaded from the remote station. These components were researched, analyzed, modeled and selected to achieve specific performance criteria that will be covered in more detail later in this report. Each sensor was wired to the microprocessor board. The sensors provide analog information. The data would go through an <b>analog-digital-converter</b> in ordered to be stored in the memory on the board. A wireless system has been developed that is based on the industry standard IEEE 802. 15. 4, which is the leading technology for short-range wireless connectivity. The use of an industry standard ensures modularity and interoperability. The custom software can take the digital values from all the sensors and display the information in a graph.

Also, the computer would also point out if any of the sensors fell out of the desired range...|$|E
40|$|Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are {{introduced}} {{in a variety}} of new applications. While commercial receivers where expected to operate in a low-interference environment in the past, this has changed significantly due to the emergence of positioning applications in mobile phones, where very strong blocking signals cannot be circumvented. This poses many challenges to GNSS receivers. This work focuses on the analog-digital-conversion in the GNSS-signal-path. First the different quantization effects are presented and their impact on GNSS signals is estimated based on simulations.

40|$|Based on the CubeSat {{framework}} of California Polytechnic State University {{this work is}} dedicated to data transmission from pico satellites towards a ground station. It is designed especially {{to be applied to}} COMPASS- 2, the second CubeSat of Aachen University of Applied Sciences (FH Aachen). First the existing ground stations of RWTH Aachen University and FH Aachen are analyzed. Calculating a link budget for the up- and downlink channel evaluates the chance of successful data communication. The transfer function of the commuication channel changes during a flyover. To take advantage of this fact, a multi-valued modulation scheme designed for ham radio equipment is developted from theoretical basics. The ground station will measure constantly the raw bit error rate during a flyover and send commands towards the satellite, which adapt the parameters of the modulations scheme in a optimal way to the actual SNR. Using a pseude-noise preamble the ground station can synchronize itself onto the clock of the satellite. The modulations schemes and the synchronization algorithm are verified by simulations. Possible channel codings like Turbo Codes are presentated. Their parameters are kept felxible. After the theoretical investigation a modular prototype is developted, built, mesasured and documentated. The design is based on the concept of software defined radios (SDR). This means that baseband is built up digitally by the means of a microcontroller. An <b>analog-digital-converter</b> followed by an anti-aliasing- filter in switched-capacitor technology generates the analog baseband signal. A programmable voltage-controlled crystal oscilator is set up to the desired transmit frequency in the 437 MHz band by the microcontroller. By modulating the frequency a FM signal is generated. The oscillator is followed by a preamplifier and a bandpass filter, lifting up the power level to fit the requirements of the final power amplifier. The maximum output power of 30 dBm can be reduced via an analog input by the microcontroller. As this is an open-loop controlling a directional coupler with small dimensions is developted. It measures the forward and reverse power on the antenna feeding line giving information about the actual output power and additionally benchmarking the antenna deploying mechanism. Finally the antennas used on COMPASS- 2 are presentated. Their characteristics are simulated taking into consideration the material parameters of the satellite’s structure...|$|E
40|$|We {{know that}} the {{universe}} consists of 22 % dark matter. The dark matter particle has to be stable, non-relativistic and only weakly interacting. But we don't know what the dark matter is made of {{and how it is}} distributed within our Galaxy. Supersymmetric models predict the existence of the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP), which is stable if R-parity is conserved. In supersymmetric models inspired by supergravity, the commonly accepted LSP candidate is the lightest neutralino which is a neutral and weakly interacting massive particle. It is a viable candidate for dark matter since the derived relic abundance is naturally within the observed range. In general, the cosmic antiparticles are expected as secondary products of interactions of the primary cosmic-rays (CRs) with the interstellar medium during propagation. While the measurements of cosmic positrons, antiprotons and diffuse gamma rays have become more precise, the results still do not match with the pure secondary origins. The comparison of the expected background of positron, antiproton and gamma-ray fluxes with experimental data have been performed using CR propagation models. A phenomenological study based on the mSUGRA frameworks was carried out and showed a better interpretation of CR fluxes including neutralino annihilations in the galactic halo or center. The combined data of positrons, antiprotons and gamma rays give a strong constraint on the mSUGRA parameter space. The light neutralino has a mass between 80 and 120 GeV annihilating dominantly to W+W-. The most preferred mSUGRA parameter space belongs to the focus point region. This region also produced the correct dark matter abundance consistent with the WMAP 3 and the 2 dFGRS data. This result might be considered as first evidence of a neutralino dark matter scenario. However, future experiments have to provide measurements of CRs with higher precision. AMS- 02 will be the major particle physics experiment on the ISS and will make a profound impact on our knowledge of high energy CRs with unprecedented accuracy. It will extend our knowledge on CR origins, acceleration and propagation mechanisms. Especially, the measurement of the positron flux may be the most promising for the detection of the neutralino dark matter, since the predicted positron flux is less sensitive to the astrophysical parameters responsible for the propagation and the dark matter halo profile. The AMS- 02 Transition Radiation Detector (TRD) is designed to provide a positron separation from the proton background with high efficiency in the momentum range of 1 GeV/c upto leq 300 GeV/c. It consists of 20 layers of straw module, proportional counters using Xe/CO 2 gas mixtures, interleaved with fleece radiators supported in a conical octagon structure. Major design constraints arise from operating it in a space environment with limited power resources. The TRD readout system is divided into 82 front-end electronic circuits and two pairs of crate electronics and power distribution boxes. A front-end board employs a 64 channel charge sensitive amplifier, shaper and multiplexer based on low noise and low power with a high dynamic range. In addition, it contains an <b>analog-digital-converter,</b> calibration, hybrid control and logic circuits. The front-end electronics has been developed and constructed to meet the requirements of space qualification issued by NASA. Results of functional tests during a series of space qualification tests have been presented and the TRD performance has been investigated using a testbeam at CERN. All of the flight frond-end boards are produced and passed the EMI, vibration and thermal vacuum tests without any failure. Each AMS sub-detector will be delivered to CERN in 2007 for the detector integration. The fully assembled AMS- 02 detector will be tested with high energy beams at CERN. Afterwards a space qualification test will be performed using a large space simulator at ESA-ESTEC. Then it will be delivered to NASA-KSC to prepare for the launch with a space shuttle. The launch and installation of the AMS- 02 detector on ISS is scheduled for 2009. Now, we are on the threshold of a new and exciting era of unexpected discoveries at the frontiers of astroparticle physics...|$|E

The solution of this difference equation provides an explicit description of the relation between the analog input and the digital output signal.

But it is not efficient to combat intersymbol interference (ISI). Decision feedback equalization (DFE) is an effect way dealing with ISI. In this paper, we proposed a algorithm that combines Viterbi decoding and DFE together for monobit receivers. In this way, we suppress the impact of ISI effectively, thus improving the bit error rate (BER) performance. By state expansion, we achieve better performance. The simulation {{results show that the}} algorithm has about 1 dB SNR gain compared to separate demodulation and decoding method and 1 dB loss compared to the BER performance in the channel without ISI.
