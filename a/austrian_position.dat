5|$|In 1821, while Metternich {{was still}} at Laibach with Tsar Alexander, the revolt of Alexander Ypsilantis {{threatened}} to bring the Ottoman Empire {{to the brink of}} collapse. Wanting a strong Ottoman Empire to counterbalance Russia, Metternich opposed all forms of Greek nationalism. Before Alexander returned to Russia, Metternich secured his agreement not to act unilaterally and would write to the Tsar again and again asking him not to intervene. For extra support he met with Viscount Castlereagh (now also Marquis of Londonderry) and King George IV of the United Kingdom in Hanover in October. The warmness of Metternich's welcome was sweetened by his promise to settle in part Austria's financial debts to Britain. The earlier Anglo-Austrian entente was thus restored, and the pair agreed that they would support the <b>Austrian</b> <b>position</b> concerning the Balkans. Metternich went away happy, not least because he had met Dorothea Lieven once more.|$|E
5|$|Joseph {{understood}} {{the problems facing}} his multi-ethnic patrimony and the ambivalent position the Austrians held in the Holy Roman Empire. Although the Habsburgs and their successor house of Habsburg-Lorraine had, with two exceptions, held the position of Emperor since the early 15th century, the basis of 18th-century Habsburg power lay not in the Holy Roman Empire itself, but in Habsburg territories in Eastern Europe (where the family had vast domains), the Italian peninsula, and the Lowlands. For Joseph or his successors to wield influence in the German-speaking states, they needed to acquire additional German-speaking territories. Acquisition of Central European territories with German-speaking subjects would strengthen the <b>Austrian</b> <b>position</b> in the Holy Roman Empire. As far as Joseph was concerned, only this could shift {{the center of the}} Habsburg empire into German-speaking Central Europe. This agenda made dispensable both the Austrian Netherlands—Habsburg territories which lay furthest west—and Galicia, furthest east. It also made the recovery of German-speaking Silesia and acquisition of new territories in Bavaria essential.|$|E
5|$|Prussia {{tried to}} take {{opportunity}} of the Russian Empire's wars with the Ottoman Empire and Sweden and move the weak Commonwealth into its sphere of influence. Some factions in the Commonwealth deemed {{this as an opportunity}} to shake free from decades of Russian control. That said, Prussia did not expect much from the alliance, not even that it would pass. When the treaty was first proposed to the Great Sejm by Prussian ambassador Ludwig Heinrich Buchholtz on 13 October 1788, Prussians expected that it would cause long and fruitless debate which only outcome would be to ensure the weakening of Russian (and to a lesser degree, <b>Austrian)</b> <b>position</b> in Poland. Overall, for Prussia, the alliance with Poland was only one of several potential options; but for some Polish politicians it became a new, and increasingly, only available strategy. The reception of Prussian proposal by the Sejm exceeded their expectations, and it has significantly strengthened the Patriotic Party. For the next year or so, Prussians decided to delay taking any clear action, keeping their options open. Buchholtz was also reprimanded for allowing things to go too far, and another Prussian diplomat, Girolamo Lucchesini, was sent to Warsaw to aid him.|$|E

5|$|Two {{days after}} the marriage, Bonaparte left Paris to take command of the Army of Italy. He {{immediately}} went on the offensive, hoping to defeat the forces of Piedmont before their Austrian allies could intervene. In a series of rapid victories during the Montenotte Campaign, he knocked Piedmont {{out of the war}} in two weeks. The French then focused on the Austrians {{for the remainder of the}} war, the highlight of which became the protracted struggle for Mantua. The Austrians launched a series of offensives against the French to break the siege, but Napoleon defeated every relief effort, scoring victories at the battles of Castiglione, Bassano, Arcole, and Rivoli. The decisive French triumph at Rivoli in January 1797 led to the collapse of the <b>Austrian</b> <b>position</b> in Italy. At Rivoli, the Austrians lost up to 14,000 men while the French lost about 5,000.|$|E
5|$|For 6 July, Charles {{planned a}} double-envelopment {{that would require}} a quick march from the forces of his brother John, then a few {{kilometres}} {{to the east of}} the battlefield. Napoleon's plan envisaged an envelopment of the Austrian left with Davout's III Corps {{while the rest of the}} army pinned the Austrian forces. Klenau's VI Corps, supported by Kollowrat's III, opened the fighting in the second day at 4am with a crushing assault against the French left, forcing the latter to abandon both Aspern and Essling. Meanwhile, a shocking development had occurred overnight. Bernadotte had unilaterally ordered his troops out of the key and central village of Aderklaa, citing heavy artillery shelling, an act that seriously compromised the entire French position. Napoleon was livid and sent two divisions of Massena's corps supported by some cavalry to regain the critical village. After difficult fighting in the first phase, Massena sent in Molitor's reserve division, which slowly but surely grabbed all of Aderklaa back for the French, only to lose it again following fierce Austrian bombardments and counterattacks. To buy time for Davout's materialising assault, Napoleon sent 4,000 cuirassiers under Nansouty against the Austrian lines, but their efforts led to nothing. To secure his center and his left, Napoleon formed a massive artillery battery of 112 guns that began pounding at the Austrians and tearing gaping holes through their lines. As Davout's men were progressing against the Austrian left, Napoleon formed the three small divisions of MacDonald into a hollow, oblong shape that marched against the Austrian center. The lumbering phalanx was devastated by Austrian artillery but managed to break through the center, although the victory could not be exploited because there was no cavalry in the immediate area. Nevertheless, when Charles sized up the situation, he realised it was only a matter of time before the <b>Austrian</b> <b>position</b> broke completely and ordered a retreat toward Bohemia a few hours after noon. His brother John arrived on the battlefield at 4pm, too late to have any impact, and accordingly ordered a retreat to Bohemia as well.|$|E
25|$|On 3 September, Masséna {{attacked}} 1,500 of Vukassovich's troops near Ala {{and drove}} {{them back to}} Marco on the east bank of the Adige. Vukassovich tried to warn Davidovich, but his superior was away at a conference with Würmser in Trento. Vaubois brushed aside some elements of Reuss's brigade at Nago-Torbole and stood poised to attack an <b>Austrian</b> <b>position</b> at Mori on the west bank. Meanwhile, Würmser {{became aware of the}} French threat to Trento, but he nevertheless pursued his strategy of moving via the Brenta valley.|$|E

25|$|Davidovich {{scored a}} victory against Claude-Henri Belgrand de Vaubois at Calliano and {{threatened}} Verona from the north. Meanwhile, Alvinczi repulsed one attack by Bonaparte at Bassano and advanced {{almost to the}} gates of Verona where he defeated a second French attack at Caldiero. Leaving Vaubois' battered division to contain Davidovich, Bonaparte massed every available man and tried to turn Alvinczi's left flank by crossing the Adige. For two days the French assaulted the stoutly defended <b>Austrian</b> <b>position</b> at Arcole without success. Their persistent attacks finally forced Alvinczi to withdraw on the third day.|$|E
25|$|Upon reconnoitering the <b>Austrian</b> <b>position,</b> Masséna drew up his plan. General Gardanne was to {{form the}} apex of the army, {{deploying}} his forces {{on both sides of the}} Verona road, supported by Partouneaux's reserve, Jean Louis Brigitte Espagne's cavalry and a part of Julien Augustin Joseph Mermet's dragoons. To the left Molitor's division would deploy close to Ca dell'Ara and would set out to take the heights of Colognola. To the right, Duhesme would march on Gombione in order to fall upon Caldiero, but he was ordered to make his move towards midday. Finally Jean-Antoine Verdier would cross the Adige at Perzacco and turn the enemy left, with the support of Charles Joseph de Pully's cavalry while the rest of Mermet's cavalry would ensure contact with Verdier.|$|E
25|$|Villatte's brigade {{assaulted}} {{the main}} <b>Austrian</b> <b>position,</b> supported by Colbert's cavalry and ten cannons. Led personally by Ney, the 6th Light rapidly captured the Elchingen Abbey {{and all of}} Ober-Elchingen except a brickworks. The 39th Line was driven back by Austrian cavalry, but Loison brought up Roguet's brigade to help. The 69th Line helped roll Riesch's men back into the Grosser Forest. Threatened by Malher from the east and Dupont from the northeast, Riesch began pulling back. Colonel Charles, comte Lefebvre-Desnouettes's 18th Dragoons broke an Austrian square after it was softened up by musketry from the 76th Line. Colonel Auguste-Jean-Gabriel de Caulaincourt's 19th Dragoons also joined the pursuit. A final cavalry charge by the Austrians was checked by Roguet's brigade, then counter-charged by Colbert's horsemen.|$|E

25|$|Thwarted at Villach, Hiller {{sought to}} create a {{bridgehead}} farther east on the Drava. He found a crossing point south of Klagenfurt and pushed troops across the river at Feistritz im Rosental {{around the end of}} August. Eugène felt that the <b>Austrian</b> <b>position</b> menaced the communications between his right and his left wings. He ordered one of his corps commanders, General of Division Paul Grenier to take two divisions and eliminate the Austrian bridgehead. Grenier marched with Generals of Division François Jean Baptiste Quesnel and Marie François Rouyer, leaving Gratien to hold Tarvisio. The Italian Guard moved from Tarvisio to Jesenice (Assling) while the 4th Division under General of Division Pierre-Louis Binet de Marcognet held a position at Bistrica (Neumarkt).|$|E
25|$|On {{the second}} day of battle, Alvinczi ordered six battalions under Giovanni Marchese di Provera to advance from Belfiore while Anton Ferdinand Mittrowsky's 14 battalions {{attacked}} south from Arcole. At 5:00 AM, Provera's attack was underway, but it was quickly blunted by Masséna. The French skirmishers riddled the Austrian infantry formations and soon only the Habsburg cannoneers were holding back the enemy almost singlehandedly. Then Brabeck was killed and the entire force fled back to Belfiore, which the French captured again, along with five guns. Mittrowsky's attack also miscarried, but he managed to hang onto Arcole until nightfall after savage fighting. On the third day, Provera's attack on Masséna failed again and this time the <b>Austrian</b> <b>position</b> unraveled. The French general diverted the bulk of his division to help Augereau and the two finally seized Arcole about 5:00 PM on 17 November, thereby winning the battle.|$|E
25|$|At the Battle of Eckmühl on the {{afternoon}} of 22 April 1809, the key to the <b>Austrian</b> <b>position</b> was the Bettelberg, a hill topped by a 16-gun battery of artillery and defended by the Austrian IV Corps under Franz Seraph of Orsini-Rosenberg. Some Bavarian cavalry tried to overrun the hill but were driven off. Next, Saint-Sulpice's four cuirassier regiments, two Württemberg cavalry regiments and the rallied Bavarians charged the Bettelberg again. Despite counterattacks by Austrian horsemen and blasts of canister shot from the guns, the Allies seized the hill, capturing most of the cannons. Rosenberg immediately ordered his beaten corps to retreat. At 7:00 pm that evening there was a cavalry melee that involved perhaps 15,000 horsemen. On the Allied side were Nansouty's 24 squadrons of cuirassiers and six squadrons of Württemberg cavalry in the first line. In the second line were Saint-Sulpice's 16 squadrons and in reserve there were 10 to 14 Bavarian squadrons. They were opposed by 32 squadrons of Austrian cavalry. The more numerous Allied cavalry routed the Austrians. As Saint-Sulpice's division led the pursuit, it encountered two battalions of Austrian grenadiers formed in squares and completely smashed them. At 9:00 pm the pursuit ended due to the exhaustion of the Allied cavalry.|$|E

500|$|Aware of Frederick's approach, Charles and {{his second}} in command, Count Leopold Joseph von Daun, {{positioned}} the army facing west on a [...] front in country of undulating plains. The Prince deployed his troops in two lines, the right wing at his northernmost point, anchored at Nippern. Leuthen served as the Austrian center. Charles established his command post there, using a church tower as his observation post, and stationing seven battalions in the village itself. The majority of Charles' forces stood on his right wing. A small advanced post stood at Borna, but with Frederick's arrival in force, they withdrew immediately to the east. [...] The <b>Austrian</b> <b>position</b> intersected {{at right angles with}} the principal road between Borna and Breslau, passing through Frobelwitz and Lissa. He secured Nippern with eight grenadier companies and placed his cavalry at Guckerwitz (present-day [...] ). The Austrian line extended as far south as Sagschütz (present-day Zakrzyce). There, his cavalry stood at right angles to the infantry, creating a line between Sagschütz and Gahla. The positions were secured with additional grenadiers and pickets. Troops filled villages and woods, and hastily made abatis and redoubts. Pickets guarded all communication points as well as road and path crossings. The left wing was his shortest, with cavalry placed at the far end, near a stream by the village of Gahla. Charles had an amalgamated force of Habsburg troops, including several contingents from the military frontier, and imperial troops from the duchies Württemberg and Bavaria.|$|E
500|$|In 1800, Gazan {{accompanied}} the Masséna's Army of Italy, {{as a general}} of division in the Corps of Jean-de-Dieu Soult. The 1st Division included the Grenadiers Piedmontais, the 30th Legne (light infantry), and portions of the 2nd, 3rd, and 78th Regiments Ligne (line infantry), totaling approximately 4,500 men. While Soult's Corps campaigned in central northern Italy, Masséna was besieged in Genoa by an Austrian army of 24,000 and a British naval squadron. Soult moved his Corps to the east to relieve Genoa. As part of Soult's Corps, Gazan participated in the battle at Bocchetta (9 April [...] ), where he commanded the right wing, and again {{at the battle of}} Sassello (10 April). In both clashes, his division was outnumbered nearly three to one took heavy casualties French had heavy casualties. Later in the month, he participated in the clash at Voltri (18 April 1800). To relieve Masséna at Genoa, Soult organized several assaults on strong Austrian positions around the city. [...] At Monte Creto (13 May 1800), Gazan's division and the first column of Soult's main force (approximately 5,000 men), attacked [...] a stronger <b>Austrian</b> <b>position</b> of 7,000, under command of Prince Hohenzollern. Soult was taken prisoner, General of Brigade Joseph Perrin was killed, and the cavalry commander, Jean-Joseph Gauthier, was badly wounded. The defeat could be seen from the ramparts at Genoa and caused the French garrison's morale to plummet; many units were already near mutiny and food was scarce. [...] Gazan, who had been wounded, took his troops to Lozano and joined Louis Gabriel Suchet. There he commanded a division of the Army of Italy and fought in a French victory at the battle in Pozzolo (25 December) against the Austrians. He was appointed commander of the First Subdivision of the 27th Military Division in Piedmont. After the peace in 1801, Gazan returned home, but shortly after his return, received a new assignment as commander of a brigade in northern Italy, where he stayed until the declaration of the First French Empire in 1804.|$|E

2500|$|On 7 September, Augereau's {{division}} {{appeared and}} began attacking the Austrian defenses. After clambering over the ridges and wading the river, the French skirmishers soon put the <b>Austrian</b> <b>position</b> in peril. The 5th Light and the 4th Line Infantry Demi-Brigades soon forced Gavasini {{to pull back}} to the Covelo fort, which perched atop an outcrop [...] high. The 5th Light circled the Austrian left flank, while a strong party of the 4th Line climbed to a site on the Austrian right rear where it poured fire into the fort. After holding out for an hour, the wounded Gavasini led his men out of the trap only to fall captive to Édouard Jean Baptiste Milhaud's 5th Dragoon Regiment.|$|E
2500|$|Lestwitz {{began his}} {{military}} career in 1734 as a Fahnenjunker in the infantry regiment of Kurt Christoph von Schwerin in Frankfurt on the Oder. In the First and Second Silesian Wars, his talents and leadership became apparent in battles at Mollwitz, Chotusitz, Hohenfriedberg, and Soor. After the Battle of Lobositz (1 October 1756), {{he received the}} order Pour le mérite; in 1760 he became a major in the infantry regiment [...] "Alt-Braunschweig". In the exhausting battle at Torgau on 3 November 1760, he contributed to the Prussian victory by collecting scattered troops and leading them into a new attack. The king, Frederick had left the battlefield after a failed attack on the <b>Austrian</b> <b>position,</b> injured by grapeshot, and given the command to Lieutenant General Johann Dietrich von Hülsen. Frederick saw Lestwitz reorganize the fleeing troops, collecting three battalions and leading them into the battle, thus giving decisive support to the attack of the Hussar Regiment of Hans Joachim von Zieten.|$|E
2500|$|While the French were {{preparing}} their attack, artillery {{on both sides}} opened up, with Rosenberg's batteries placed on high ground and at times behind earthworks. Despite the superior Austrian tactical position, after about two hours of bombardment, the French managed to put out of action most of the Austrian pieces and cause fast-spreading fires {{in the village of}} Markgrafneusiedl. The fact that the French artillery managed to win its duel with the Austrian artillery was {{due in part to the}} larger number of French high-calibre pieces, but most of all to their superior concentration of fire, with the artillery of French III Corps and II Corps cooperating and creating a deadly crossfire. By 09:30, Davout's troops were in position and ready to commence their attack. Initial orders provided that Davout should send his four infantry divisions in a frontal assault northwards, but early that morning Napoleon changed his mind, after reconnoitering the position in person and noticing that he could take advantage from the weakness on the left of the <b>Austrian</b> <b>position.</b> The new orders stated that two of Davout's divisions, those of Gudin and Puthod, were to advance from Grosshofen towards Markgrafneusiedl, forcing Rosenberg to commit a part of his forces in order to meet them, while the remaining infantry divisions, Friant's and Morand's, supported by Grouchy's and Montbruns cavalry divisions, would storm the plateau from the east. This order caused a significant delay, as the troops had to move to their assigned positions eastwards and artillery bridges had to be built, in order for the divisional artillery to be able to cross the Russbach stream. Commanding the Austrian forces in this sector, Rosenberg could rely on reinforcements from Nordmann's Advance Guard, and a numerous cavalry under Nostitz, all of which were placed under his direct command. He was also counting on support from the east, with Archduke John's [...] "Army of Inner Austria" [...] set to arrive on the battlefield, but so far these badly needed reinforcements had failed to materialise.|$|E
