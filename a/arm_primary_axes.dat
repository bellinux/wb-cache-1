40|$|In a {{previous}} paper dealing with duration, rate, {{and magnitude of}} elongation of primary, secondary, and tertiary axes in two trees of P. resinosa and one of P. strobus, it was found that: (1) Elongation began at approximately the same time on all branches over the entire contour of the tree. (2) <b>Primary</b> <b>axes</b> showed greater total and higher daily rate of elongation than was shown {{in any of the}} secondary or tertiary axes in each of the 3 trees studied. (3) Secondary axes exhibited successively shorter total elongation, shorter duration of growth and slower daily growth rate from the topmost whorl downward. (4) Duration of elongation in the primary axis was greater than in secondaries in P. strobus, but in P. resinosa, duration of elongation in the upper 2 - 4 secondaries equalled that of the <b>primary</b> <b>axes.</b> All of these data covered the elongation exhibited during the 1942 season only.

40|$|Abstract Background Cichlid fishes {{from the}} Rift Lakes of East Africa have {{undergone}} {{the most spectacular}} adaptive radiations in vertebrate history. Eco-morphological adaptations in lakes Victoria, Malawi and Tanganyika {{have resulted in a}} vast array of skull shapes and sizes, yet <b>primary</b> <b>axes</b> of morphological variation are conserved in all three radiations, prominently including the size of the preorbital region of the skull. This conserved pattern suggests that development may constrain the trajectories of cichlid head morphological evolution. Results Here, we (1) present a comparative analysis of adult head morphology in two sand-dweller cichlids from Lake Malawi with preorbital size differences representative of the main axis of variation among the three lakes and (2) analyze the ontogeny of shape and size differences by focusing on known developmental modules throughout the head. We find that (1) developmental differences between the two species correlate with known developmental modules; (2) differences in embryonic cartilage development result in phenotypically integrated changes among all bones derived from a single cartilage, while differences in dermal bone development tend to influence isolated regions within a bone; and lastly (3) species-specific morphologies appear in the embryo as subtle differences, which become progressively amplified throughout ontogeny. We propose that this amplification takes place at skeletal growth zones, the locations and shapes of which are patterned during embryogenesis. Conclusions This study is the most anatomically comprehensive analysis of the developmental differences underlying cichlid skull evolution in the Rift Lakes of East Africa. The scale of our analysis reveals previously unnoticed correlations between developmental modules and patterns of phenotypic integration. We propose that the <b>primary</b> <b>axes</b> of morphological variation among East African cichlid adaptive radiations are constrained by the hierarchical modularity of the teleost head skeleton...|$|R

40|$|SummaryStudies of resting-state {{activity}} in the brain have provoked critical questions about the brain’s functional organization, but the biological basis of this activity is not clear. Specifically, the relationships between interregional correlations in resting-state measures of activity, neuronal functional connectivity and anatomical connectivity are much debated. To investigate these relationships, we have examined both anatomical and steady-state functional connectivity within the hand representation of primary somatosensory cortex (areas 3 b and 1) in anesthetized squirrel monkeys. The comparison of three data sets (fMRI, electrophysiological, and anatomical) indicate two <b>primary</b> <b>axes</b> of information flow within the SI: prominent interdigit interactions within area 3 b and predominantly homotopic interactions between area 3 b and area 1. These data support a strikingly close relationship between baseline functional connectivity and anatomical connections.

All three of these are perpendicular {{to each other and}} cross at the center point of the ellipsoid. We call the axes in this setting eigenvectors and the measures of their lengths eigenvalues. The lengths are symbolized by the Greek letter λ. The long one pointing along the axon direction will be λ1 and the two small axes will have lengths λ2 [...] and λ3. In the setting of the DTI tensor ellipsoid, we can consider each of these as a measure of the diffusivity along each of the three <b>primary</b> <b>axes</b> of the ellipsoid. This is a little different from the ADC since that was a projection on the axis, while λ is an actual measurement of the ellipsoid we have calculated.|$|R
