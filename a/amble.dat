25|$|A {{horse that}} paces {{and is not}} used in harness is often taught to perform some form of <b>amble,</b> {{obtained}} by lightly unbalancing the horse so the footfalls of the pace break up into a four beat lateral gait that is smoother to ride. A rider cannot properly post to a pacing horse {{because there is no}} diagonal gait pattern to follow, though some riders attempt to avoid jostling by rhythmically rising and sitting.|$|E

50|$|The smooth <b>ambling</b> gaits {{today have}} many names, {{including}} the single-foot, the stepping pace, the tolt, the rack, the paso corto, and the fox trot (see <b>ambling).</b> There {{are still many}} <b>ambling</b> breeds, particularly in North America where today they {{are referred to as}} gaited horses. Some of these breeds include the Missouri Fox Trotter, Tennessee Walking Horse, Icelandic horse and a sub-group within the American Saddlebred. The Paso Fino and the Peruvian Paso, breeds developed in Latin America, perform two or three different <b>ambling</b> gaits of varying speed, and are probably the closest modern descendants of the medieval palfrey.|$|R

In most [...] "gaited" [...] breeds, an <b>ambling</b> gait is a {{hereditary}} trait. A 2012 DNA study of movement in Icelandic horses and mice have determined that a mutation on the gene DMRT3, which is related to limb movement and motion, causes a [...] "premature 'stop codon'" [...] in horses with lateral <b>ambling</b> gaits.|$|R

25|$|As roads {{improved}} and carriage travel became more common, followed later by railroads, riding horses that trotted became more popular in Europe; the dominant uses of riding horses came to include light cavalry, fox hunting {{and other types}} of rapid travel across country, but of more limited duration, where the gallop could be used. The <b>amble</b> was still prized in the Americas, particularly in the southern United States and in Latin America where plantation agriculture required riders to cover long distances every day to view fields and crops. Today, ambling or gaited horses are popular amongst casual riders who seek soft-gaited, comfortable horses for pleasure riding.|$|E
500|$|The Narragansett Pacer was not {{exclusively}} a pacing horse, as strong evidence indicates it exhibited an ambling gait, {{which is a}} four-beat, intermediate-speed gait, while the pace is a two-beat, intermediate-speed gait. The <b>amble</b> is more comfortable to ride than the pace, and Narragansett Pacers were known for their qualities as both riding and driving horses. They averaged around [...] tall, and were generally chestnut in color. James Fenimore Cooper described them as: [...] "They have handsome foreheads, the head clean, the neck long, the arms and legs thin and tapered."; however, another source stated, [...] "The hindquarters are narrow and the hocks a little crooked...", but also said, [...] "They are very spirited and carry both the head and tail high. But what is more remarkable is that they <b>amble</b> with more speed than most horses trot, {{so that it is}} difficult to put some of them upon a gallop." [...] Other viewers of the breed rarely called them stylish or good-looking, although they considered them dependable, easy to work with and sure-footed.|$|E
500|$|During {{much of the}} Middle Ages, {{there was}} no system of {{interconnected}} roads and bridges. Though parts of Europe still had remnants of Roman roads built before {{the collapse of the}} Roman Empire, most had long fallen into disrepair. [...] Because of the necessity to ride long distances over uncertain roads, smooth-gaited horses were preferred, and most ordinary riding horses were of greater value if they could do one of the smooth but ground-covering four-beat gaits collectively known as an <b>amble</b> rather than the more jarring trot.|$|E
2500|$|The only {{diagonal}} <b>ambling</b> gait {{is called}} the fox trot in English, though it is given other names in other countries. The diagonal footfalls are usually slightly uneven, occurring in [...] "couplets" [...] of a 1-2, 3-4 rhythm that gives the rider a slight forward and back sensation when riding. [...] They are considered physically easier on the horse than the lateral gaits as less hollowing of the back occurs when the horse is in the gait. [...] Diagonal four beat gaits are classified as an alternative <b>ambling</b> gait, even though derived from the trot rather than the pace. The genetic mechanism that allows diagonal <b>ambling</b> gaits {{appears to be the}} same gene responsible for lateral <b>ambling</b> gaits.|$|R

2500|$|As {{a general}} rule, while <b>ambling</b> horses {{are able to}} canter, they usually are not known for speed, nor is it {{particularly}} {{easy for them to}} transition from an <b>ambling</b> gait into the canter or gallop. [...] Thus, in history, where comfort for long hours in the saddle was important, <b>ambling</b> horses were preferred for smoothness, sure-footedness and quiet disposition. [...] However, when speed and quick action was of greater importance, horses that trotted were more suitable due to their speed and agility. [...] When horses were used in warfare, particularly during the Middle Ages, it was not uncommon for a knight to ride an <b>ambling</b> horse to a battle site, then switch to a war horse for galloping into the actual battle.|$|R

One reviewer described the way [...] "keyboards buzz from out of nowhere, guitars hit bum notes intentionally, basslines <b>amble</b> {{up and down the}} scale, sometimes two at a time." [...] Another commentator described the progression of [...] "Put on a Side" [...] as follows: [...] "At 1.28 there is a distorted chug. At 2.29 a drum-roll. Neither of these introduces anything, continues or reappears. They just pop up and then evaporate like accidental fireworks." [...] Title TK has been noted on one hand for big contrasts in speed and levity from song to song, and on the other, for the unified feel of the entire album.|$|E

500|$|Armstrong was tireless as a leg break bowler and {{was known}} for his ability to land the ball on any point of the pitch he liked. [...] His action {{imparted}} as much topspin as leg spin, making it difficult for batsman to detect his [...] "straight-breaks". [...] Early in his career, he bowled negative leg theory but later used his accuracy to great effect, bowling an over or two of leg breaks and then the straight one in the hope of bowling the batsman or receiving a leg before wicket dismissal. [...] His action consisted of an easy <b>amble</b> and a gentle arc and was described in the Sporting Life as [...] "rather like a fat uncle, not altogether unlike a fat aunt."

2500|$|A {{number of}} horse breeds have {{observed}} natural gaited tendencies, including the American Saddlebred, Boerperd, Icelandic horse, Missouri Fox Trotter, Paso Fino, Peruvian Paso, Racking horse, Rocky Mountain Horse, Spotted Saddle horse, and Tennessee Walking Horse. The two-beat lateral pace is also sometimes classified with the <b>ambling</b> gaits as an [...] "alternate" [...] gait, {{and may be}} linked to the same genetic mechanism as the lateral <b>ambling</b> gaits. [...] The pacing horses studied were all homozygous for the DMTR3 mutation. [...] But not all horses with the homozygous mutation could pace, suggesting other factors had to come into play for that gait to occur. Although <b>ambling</b> gaits are seen in some Mustangs, and other Colonial Spanish Horses, [...] DMRT3 mutations are rarely seen in feral or wild horses. Researchers theorize that {{this is due to the}} difficultly that horses with this mutation have in moving from an <b>ambling</b> gait to a gallop, leading them to be easy prey for predators. Humans, however, have selectively bred for <b>ambling</b> horses, leading to a much more frequent occurrence of DMRT3 mutations among the human-bred horse population.|$|R

500|$|In America, the {{political}} atmosphere {{began to change}} and attention was once again directed to Chaplin's films instead of his views. In July 1962, The New York Times published an editorial stating that [...] "we {{do not believe the}} Republic would be in danger if yesterday's unforgotten little tramp were allowed to <b>amble</b> down the gangplank of a steamer or plane in an American port". The same month, Chaplin was invested with the honorary degree of Doctor of Letters by the universities of Oxford and Durham. In November 1963, the Plaza Theater in New York started a year-long series of Chaplin's films, including Monsieur Verdoux and Limelight, which gained excellent reviews from American critics. September 1964 saw the release of Chaplin's memoirs, My Autobiography, which he had been working on since 1957. The 500-page book, which focused on his early years and personal life, became a worldwide best-seller, despite criticism over the lack of information on his film career.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{ancestors of}} the Breton were a population of horses that lived in the Breton mountains, possibly descended from steppe horses ridden by Celts. During the Crusades, these mountain horses were crossed with oriental horses to create a type known as the Bidet Breton. In the Middle Ages, the ancestral Breton horse was sought by military leaders, partly because of its comfortable gait, which {{was said to be}} partway between a brisk trot and an <b>amble.</b> [...] Due to its gaits {{and the fact that it}} only stood about [...] high, it was nicknamed the Bidet d'Allure or Bidet Breton. [...] Horses of other bloodlines brought back to Europe during the Crusades had a strong influence on the Breton, and two types subsequently developed. [...] The Sommier was the common, heavier type, used mainly as a pack horse and for farm and draft work. From the Sommier, the Roussin was developed, was used mainly in wars and on long journeys. The Roussins natural ambling gait made it popular as a lighter riding horse.|$|E
500|$|The first {{additional}} gait is a four-beat lateral ambling gait {{known as}} the tölt. This {{is known for its}} explosive acceleration and speed; it is also comfortable and ground-covering. There is considerable variation in style within the gait, and thus the tölt is variously compared to similar lateral gaits such as the rack of the Saddlebred, the largo of the Paso Fino, or the running walk of the Tennessee Walking Horse. Like all lateral ambling gaits, the footfall pattern {{is the same as the}} walk (left hind, left front, right hind, right front), but differs from the walk in that it can be performed at a range of speeds, from the speed of a typical fast walk up to the speed of a normal canter. Some Icelandic horses prefer to tölt, while others prefer to trot; correct training can improve weak gaits, but the tölt is a natural gait present from birth. There are two varieties of the tölt that are considered incorrect by breeders. The first is an uneven gait called a [...] "Pig's Pace" [...] or [...] "Piggy-pace" [...] that is closer to a two-beat pace than a four-beat <b>amble.</b> The second is called a Valhopp and is a tölt and canter combination most often seen in untrained young horses or horses that mix their gaits. Both varieties are normally uncomfortable to ride.|$|E
50|$|The {{ability to}} perform an <b>ambling</b> gait or to pace appears {{to be due to}} a {{specific}} genetic mutation. Some horses are able to both trot and perform an <b>ambling</b> gait, but many can only do one or the other, thus five-gaited ability is not particularly common in the horse world.|$|R

The modern breed retains the size of its Spanish ancestors, {{standing}} [...] high and weighing [...] They are found mainly in bay, black and gray, although grullo, dun and chestnut are also seen. Roan and pinto colors are occasionally found. They have straight or slightly concave profiles, strong backs and sloping croups. They are known for their speed and agility and excel at trail and endurance riding, and are also used extensively as stock horses. They are sometimes seen in Western riding sports such as working cow horse, team roping and team penning. The Florida Cracker is a gaited horse, with the breed association recognizing two gaits, the running walk and <b>amble,</b> in addition to the regular walk, trot, canter and gallop. The single-footed ambling gait is known as the [...] "coon rack" [...] by some breed enthusiasts. The foundation genetics of the breed are the same as many others developed from Spanish stock in North and South America, including the Paso Fino, Peruvian Paso and Criollo. The Cracker horse is very similar in type and genetics to the Carolina Marsh Tacky and the Banker horse, both Spanish-style breeds from the eastern United States, but DNA testing has proven that these are separate breeds.|$|E
500|$|M-46 was {{designated}} by July 1, 1919 on a discontinuous route that ran between Howard City and Saginaw and between rural Tuscola County and Port Sanilac. The highway followed a different routing in place {{than it does}} today. The western terminus was in downtown Howard City, rather than north of town. The road ran farther south in Gratiot [...] County so that it went into downtown Alma. By the end of 1927, the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) filled in the gap between Saginaw and Tuscola County, and the department extended the western end to Muskegon. M-46 followed the contemporary US131 between Cedar Springs and Howard City and the modern routing west to Muskegon ending at US31 downtown. In {{the middle of the}} 1930s, the section north of Howard City was straightened, removing the angled route between <b>Amble</b> and Howard City in favor of a more direct connection to US 131. The US131 and M-37 concurrencies were removed, however, when the section between Kent City and Cedar Springs was removed from the highway system. That gap was eliminated in late 1936 when M-46 was routed down US131 to Howard City and along M-82 to Newaygo. From there, it followed M-37 south to Casnovia. A new road was opened in early 1937 between Vestaburg and Alma, which {{was designated}} as part of M-46 {{by the end of the}} year. The western terminus was extended farther west through Muskegon to the outlet of Muskegon Lake on Lake Michigan as well. The M-82 concurrency was removed in 1938, and a more direct routing between Six Lakes and Edmore opened at the same time.|$|E

2500|$|All <b>ambling</b> gaits {{have four}} beats. [...] Some <b>ambling</b> gaits are lateral gaits, {{meaning that the}} feet {{on the same side}} of the horse move forward, but one after the other, usually in a {{footfall}} pattern of right rear, right front, left rear, left front. Others are diagonal, meaning that the feet on opposite sides of the horse move forward in sequence, usually right rear, left front, left rear, right front. [...] A common trait of the <b>ambling</b> gaits is that usually only one foot is completely off the ground at any one time. <b>Ambling</b> gaits are further distinguished by the timing and cadence of the footfall pattern. One distinction is whether the footfall rhythm is , four equal beats in a 1-2-3-4 rhythm; or a non-isochronous 1-2, 3-4 rhythm created by a slight pause between the groundstrike of the forefoot of one side to the rear of the other.|$|R
