40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{behavioral changes}} and {{brain-derived neurotrophic factor}} (BDNF) levels in rats subjected to ketamine administration (25 mg/kg) for 7 days. Method: Behavioral evaluation was undertaken at 1 and 6 hours <b>after</b> the <b>last</b> injection. Results: We observed hyperlocomotion 1 hour <b>after</b> the <b>last</b> injection {{and a decrease in}} locomotion after 6 hours. Immobility time was decreased and climbing time was increased 6 hours <b>after</b> the <b>last</b> injection. BDNF levels were decreased in the prefrontal cortex and amygdala when rats were killed 6 hours <b>after</b> the <b>last</b> injection, compared to the saline group and to rats killed 1 hour <b>after</b> the <b>last</b> injection. BDNF levels in the striatum were decreased in rats killed 6 hours <b>after</b> the <b>last</b> ketamine injection, and BDNF levels in the hippocampus were decreased in the groups that were killed 1 and 6 hours <b>after</b> the <b>last</b> injection. Conclusion: These results suggest that the effects of ketamine on behavior and BDNF levels are related to the time at which they were evaluated after administration of the drug...|$|R

5|$|In Europe, {{pyrethroids}} and neonicotinoids {{have been}} used against B. rufimanus. Because of the faba bean crop biology and its attraction to pollinators at flowering stage, restrictions on pesticides uses have been introduced in Europe. It is particularly advised to spray in absence of pollinators {{in the early morning}} and evening. In addition, due to B. rufimanus biology, a temperature threshold combined with crop development stage can be used to increase the success of chemical treatments. Adult B. rufimanus activity increases with temperature, so that treatment efficiency might increase when maximum day temperatures are over 20°C during four consecutive days after treatment (Arvalis, 2016). Adult B. rufimanus activity increases with temperature, so that treatment efficiency might increase when maximum day temperatures are over 20°C during four consecutive days after treatment. The end of blooming indicates the end of adult activity in the field. This stage is therefore a threshold marking the end of insecticide application and occurs no later than five days <b>after</b> <b>last</b> blooming. Forecasting systems (Bruchi-LIS, Arvalis, France and BruchidCast, Syngenta, UK) have been developed to optimize insecticide applications based on temperature and crop stage.|$|E
5|$|Within 12 {{hours of}} the attack the UVF's Brigade Staff (Belfast leadership) issued a statement. It was {{released}} under the heading Ulster Central Intelligence Agency – Miami Showband Incident Report:A UVF patrol led by Major Boyle was suspicious of two vehicles, a minibus and a car parked near the border. Major Boyle ordered his patrol to apprehend the occupants for questioning. As they were being questioned, Major Boyle and Lieutenant Somerville began to search the minibus. As they began to enter the vehicle, a bomb was detonated and both men were killed outright. At the precise moment of the explosion, the patrol came under intense automatic fire from the occupants of the other vehicle. The patrol sergeant immediately ordered fire to be returned. Using self-loading rifles and sub-machine guns, the patrol returned fire, killing three of their attackers and wounding another. The patrol later recovered two Armalite rifles and a pistol. The UVF maintains regular border patrols due to the continued activity of the Provisional IRA. The Mid-Ulster Battalion has been assisting the South Down-South Armagh units since the IRA Forkhill boobytrap which killed four British soldiers. Three UVF members are being treated for gunshot wounds <b>after</b> <b>last</b> night but not in hospital.It {{would appear that the}} UVF patrol surprised members of a terrorist organisation transferring weapons to the Miami Showband minibus and that an explosive device of some description was being carried by the Showband for an unlawful purpose. It is obvious, therefore, that the UVF patrol was justified in taking the action it did and that the killing of the three Showband members should be regarded as justifiable homicide. The Officers and Agents of the Ulster Central Intelligence Agency commend the UVF on their actions and tender their deepest sympathy to the relatives of the two Officers who died while attempting to remove the bomb from the minibus.|$|E
