25|$|The self {{is found}} to be a cause of force, free in its action, on the ground that we are obliged to relate the {{volition}} of consciousness to the self as its cause, and its ultimate cause. It is not clear from the analysis whether the self is immediately observed as an acting or originating cause, or whether reflection working on the principle of causality is compelled to infer its existence and character. If self is actually so given, we do not need the principle of causality to infer it; if it is not so given, causality could never give us either the notion or the fact of self as a cause or force, far less as an ultimate one. All that it could do would be to warrant a cause of some sort, but not this or that reality as the cause. And further, the principle of causality, if fairly carried out, as universal and necessary, would not allow us to stop at personality or will as the ultimate cause of its effect—volition. Once applied to the facts at <b>all,</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> drive us beyond the first antecedent or term of antecedents of volition to a still further cause or ground—in fact, land us in an infinite regress of causes.|$|E
500|$|Bush {{was fond}} of saying that [...] "if he made any {{important}} contribution {{to the war effort}} at <b>all,</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be to get the Army and Navy to tell each other what they were doing." [...] He established a cordial relationship with Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, and Stimson's assistant, Harvey H. Bundy, who found Bush [...] "impatient" [...] and [...] "vain", but said he was [...] "one of the most important, able men I ever knew". Bush's relationship with the navy was more turbulent. Bowen, the director of the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), saw the NDRC as a bureaucratic rival, and recommended abolishing it. A series of bureaucratic battles ended with the NRL placed under the Bureau of Ships, and Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox placing an unsatisfactory fitness report in Bowen's personnel file. After the war, Bowen would again try to create a rival to the NDRC inside the navy.|$|E
500|$|As The Five's {{campaign}} against Rubinstein {{continued in the}} press, Tchaikovsky found himself almost as much a target as his former teacher. Cui reviewed the performance of Tchaikovsky's graduation cantata and lambasted the composer as [...] "utterly feeble.... If he had any talent at <b>all</b> ... <b>it</b> <b>would</b> surely {{at some point in}} the piece have broken free of the chains imposed by the Conservatory." [...] The review's effect on the sensitive composer was devastating. Eventually, an uneasy truce developed as Tchaikovsky became friendly with Balakirev and eventually with the other four composers of the group. A working relationship between Balakirev and Tchaikovsky resulted in Romeo and Juliet. The Five's approval of this work was further was followed by their enthusiasm for Tchaikovsky's Second Symphony. Subtitled the Little Russian (Little Russia was the term at that time for what is now called the Ukraine) for its use of Ukrainian folk songs, the symphony in its initial version also used several compositional devices similar to those used by the Five in their work. Stasov suggested the subject of Shakespeare's The Tempest to Tchaikovsky, who wrote a tone poem based on this subject. After a lapse of several years, Balakirev reentered Tchaikovsky's creative life; the result was Tchaikovsky's Manfred Symphony, composed to a program after Lord Byron originally written by Stasov and supplied by Balakirev. Overall, however, Tchaikovsky continued down an independent creative path, traveling a middle course between those of his nationalistic peers and the traditionalists.|$|E

2500|$|It {{may seem}} {{counterintuitive}} that the Equal Protection Clause should provide for equal voting rights; after <b>all,</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> {{seem to make}} the Fifteenth Amendment and the Nineteenth Amendment redundant. Indeed, it was on this argument, {{as well as on}} the legislative history of the Fourteenth Amendment, that Justice John M. Harlan (the grandson of the earlier Justice Harlan) relied in his dissent from Reynolds. Harlan quoted the congressional debates of 1866 to show that the framers did not intend for the Equal Protection Clause to extend to voting rights, and in reference to the Fifteenth and Nineteenth Amendments, he said: ...|$|E

2500|$|With no {{attractive}} alternatives, Galileo {{accepted the}} orders delivered, even sterner than those {{recommended by the}} Pope. Galileo met again with Bellarmine, apparently on friendly terms; and on March 11 {{he met with the}} Pope, who assured him that he was safe from persecution so long as he, the Pope, should live. Nonetheless, Galileo's friends Sagredo and Castelli reported that there were rumors that Galileo had been forced to recant and do penance. To protect his good name, Galileo requested a letter from Bellarmine stating the truth of the matter. This letter assumed great importance in 1633, as did the question whether Galileo had been ordered not to [...] "hold or defend" [...] Copernican ideas (which would have allowed their hypothetical treatment) or not to teach them in any way. If the Inquisition had issued the order not to teach heliocentrism at <b>all,</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have been ignoring Bellarmine's position.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2015, Lucas {{recorded}} {{an hour-long}} interview with CBS News reporter Charlie Rose {{in which he}} said Disney had not been [...] "keen" [...] to involve him and conceded: [...] "If I get in there, I'm just going to cause trouble because they're not going to do what I want them to do, and I don't have the control to do that any more, and <b>all</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> do is just muck everything up." [...] He also stated: [...] "They wanted to do a retro movie. I don't like that. Every movie, I worked very hard to make them different… I made them completely different—different planets, different spaceships to make it new." [...] In early December 2015, Kathleen Kennedy told The Hollywood Reporter that Lucas had seen the movie and [...] "liked it". In the same month, at the Kennedy Center Honors, Lucas said: “I think the fans are going to love it, It’s very much the kind of movie they’ve been looking for." [...] Abrams felt that, as the first in a new trilogy, the film had [...] "needed to take a couple of steps backwards into very familiar terrain" [...] and use plot elements from previous Star Wars films.|$|E
2500|$|The Guideline invoked by the University to deny {{third-party}} contractor {{payments on}} behalf of Wide Awake effects a sweeping restriction on student thought and student inquiry {{in the context of}} University sponsored publications. [...] The prohibition on funding {{on behalf of}} publications that [...] "primarily promote or manifest a particular belief in or about a deity or an ultimate reality", in its ordinary and commonplace meaning, has a vast potential reach. [...] The term [...] "promotes" [...] as used here would comprehend any writing advocating a philosophic position that rests upon a belief in a deity or ultimate reality. [...] And the term [...] "manifests" [...] would bring within the scope of the prohibition any writing that is explicable as resting upon a premise that presupposes the extistence of a deity or ultimate reality. [...] Were the prohibition applied with much vigor at <b>all,</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> bar funding of essays by hypothetical students such as Plato, Spinoza, and Descartes. [...] And if the regulation covers, as the University says it does, those student journalistic efforts that primarily manifest or promote a belief that there is no deity and no ultimate reality, then undergraduates named Karl Marx, Bertrand Russell, and Jean-Paul Sartre would likewise have some of their major essays excluded from student publications. [...] If any manifestation of beliefs in first principles disqualifies the writing, as seems to be the case, it is indeed difficult to name renowned thinkers whose writings would be accepted, save perhaps for articles disclaiming all connection to their ultimate philosophy. [...] Plato could contrive perhaps to submit an acceptable essay on making pasta or peanut butter cookies, provided he did not point out their (necessary) imperfections.|$|E
