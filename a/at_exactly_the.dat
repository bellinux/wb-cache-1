5|$|The British rock {{movement}} {{known as}} {{the new wave of}} British heavy metal (frequently abbreviated in NWOBHM), which started in the late 1970s and broke in the mainstream in the early 1980s, was just exploding in the United Kingdom and the band gained the support of a strong label <b>at</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> right time to exploit the moment and form a solid fan base.|$|E
5|$|The Beatles {{completed}} a final {{mix of the}} song on 21 April 1967. Due to the difficulty in getting the two 4-track machines to play <b>at</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> same time, only a mono mix was attempted. In October 1968, while preparing the Yellow Submarine soundtrack album for release, EMI's engineers created a mock-stereo (duophonic) mix from this mono mix, instead of returning to the master tapes. For the monaural version of the album, originally available only in the UK, the engineers combined the two channels from the duophonic mix, rather than using the April 1967 mono mix.|$|E
5|$|Another {{innovation}} {{was the use}} of a dummy head to {{find the}} location of an enemy sniper. The tempting target of a realistic papier-mâché head was raised above the parapet on a stick running in a groove on a fixed board. To increase the realism, a lit cigarette could be inserted into the dummy's mouth and be smoked by a soldier via a rubber tube. If the head was shot, it was dropped rapidly, simulating a casualty. The sniper's bullet would have made a hole in the front and back of the dummy's head. The head was then raised in the groove again, but lower than before by the vertical distance between the glasses of a trench periscope. If the lower glass of a periscope was placed before the front bullet hole, its upper glass would be <b>at</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> same height as the bullet had been. By looking through the rear hole in the head, through the front hole and up through the periscope, the soldier would be looking exactly along the line the bullet had taken, and so would be looking directly at the sniper, revealing his position.|$|E

5|$|For {{the three}} {{sections}} of the ride where wrap-around projection is used, each robotic arm continues its steady movement on the track but is met by its own individual parabolic projection screen and projector traveling <b>at</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> same pace. Each projection section uses a huge turntable with six of these enormous screens mounted facing outwards - one for each robotic arm as they pass by - and each screen is large enough that when {{in front of each}} ride bench its edges cannot be seen. The screens appear and disappear behind the edges of the physical sets. The robotic arms can then freely dive, turn and pivot each ride bench within the curved area, giving the illusion of extreme movement when synchronized with the projection, whilst the base of the arm on the track simply follows the slow circular path that each screen takes as it revolves. This is why each projection section of the ride is approximately the same length, as each ride arm must follow each identically-sized projection screen turntable for a set period of time.|$|E
5|$|In 1875, {{the same}} year in which her husband's body was reburied, the {{cemetery}} in which she lay was destroyed and her remains were almost forgotten. An early Poe biographer, William Gill, gathered the bones and stored them in a box he hid under his bed. Gill's story {{was reported in the}} Boston Herald twenty-seven years after the event: he says that he had visited the Fordham cemetery in 1883 <b>at</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> moment that the sexton Dennis Valentine held Virginia's bones in his shovel, ready to throw them away as unclaimed. Poe himself had died in 1849, and so Gill took Virginia's remains and, after corresponding with Neilson Poe and John Prentiss Poe in Baltimore, arranged to bring the box down to be laid on Poe's left side in a small bronze casket. Virginia's remains were finally buried with her husband's on January 19, 1885the seventy-sixth anniversary of her husband's birth and nearly ten years after his current monument was erected. The same man who served as sexton during Poe's original burial and his exhumations and reburials was also present at the rites which brought his body to rest with Virginia and Virginia's mother Maria Clemm.|$|E
5|$|The Beatles' last {{concert was}} at Candlestick Park, San Francisco, on 29 August 1966, but Evans {{continued}} {{to work for them}} in the studio, and to run errands. After recording Revolver in 1966, McCartney went by himself on holiday to France, but asked to meet Evans in Bordeaux, at the Grosse Horloge church (on the corner of cours Victor Hugo and rue St. James). <b>At</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> pre-arranged time of one o'clock, Evans was standing under the church clock when McCartney arrived. They then drove to Madrid together, but after feeling bored, McCartney phoned Epstein's office in London and asked to be booked on a safari holiday in Kenya. When they arrived they visited the Amboseli Reserve at the foot of Mount Kilimanjaro, and also stayed at the exclusive Treetops Hotel, where the rooms are built on the branches of trees.|$|E

25|$|The speed {{regulator}} was furnished with an indicator {{that showed the}} speed when the machine was running so that the records, on reproduction, could be revolved <b>at</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> same speed...The literature does not disclose why 78rpm was chosen for the phonograph industry, apparently this {{just happened to be}} the speed created by one of the early machines and, for no other reason continued to be used.|$|E
25|$|An exception-handling {{language}} {{without this}} unwinding is Common Lisp with its Condition System. Common Lisp calls the exception handler {{and does not}} unwind the stack. This allows the program to continue the computation <b>at</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> same place where the error occurred (for example when a previously missing file has become available). The stackless implementation of the Mythryl programming language supports constant-time exception handling without stack unwinding.|$|E

25|$|On tandem {{bicycles}} the pedalling {{contribution of}} both riders is often combined and coordinated by the crank arms. There {{may be a}} second set of chainrings, often on the opposite side from the regular drive train, one on each crank set and connected by a separate chain. The most common implementation has both cyclists pedaling <b>at</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> same pace and usually in phase, although it is possible to configure the system for out-of-phase pedaling.|$|E
25|$|Spark {{ignition}} {{engines are}} designed to burn gasoline in a controlled process called deflagration. However, the unburned mixture may autoignite by detonating from pressure and heat alone, rather than ignite from the spark plug <b>at</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> right time. This causes a rapid pressure rise which can damage the engine. This {{is often referred to}} as engine knocking or end-gas knock. Knocking can be reduced by increasing the gasoline's resistance to autoignition, which is expressed by its octane rating.|$|E
25|$|The rubrics of the Roman Missal now {{prescribe}} {{that the}} priest should face {{the people at}} six points of the Mass. The priest celebrating the Tridentine Mass was required to face the people, turning if necessary {{his back to the}} altar, eight times. The priest is still expressly directed to face the altar <b>at</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> same points as in the Tridentine Mass. His position in relation to the altar determines, as before, whether facing the altar means also facing the people.|$|E

As a result, when the New England Planters arrived, many houses and barns still stood there.|$|E
25|$|Resonant {{vibrational}} modes due to {{vertical loads}} (such as trains, traffic, pedestrians) and wind loads are well understood in bridge design. In {{the case of}} the Millennium Bridge, because the lateral motion caused the pedestrians loading the bridge to directly participate with the bridge, the vibrational modes had not been anticipated by the designers. The crucial point is that when the bridge lurches to one side, the pedestrians must adjust to keep from falling over, and they all do this <b>at</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> same time.|$|E
25|$|The West Indies played 19 Tests in the 1930s in four {{series against}} England and one against Australia.

However, as Harold Gilligan was leading another English team to New Zealand <b>at</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> same time, {{this was not a}} full-strength England side. The series ended one-all, with the West Indies first ever Test victory being {{recorded}} on 26 February 1930. West Indians George Headley scored the most runs (703) in the rubber and Learie Constantine took the most wickets (18).|$|E
