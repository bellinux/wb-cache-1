40|$|AbstractUnderwater torpedo has control {{fin with}} very low aspect ratio due to {{launching}} from limited size of cylindrical torpedo tube. If the aspect ratio of control fin of underwater vehicle {{is very low}} three-dimensional flow around control fin largely reduces control forces. In this study, the end plate was applied to reduce the three-dimensional flow effects of partially movable control fin of underwater vehicle. Through numerical simulations the flow field around control fin was examined with and without end plate for different flap angles. The pressure, vorticity, lift and torque on the control fin were analyzed and compared to experiments. The comparison have shown a reasonable agreement between numerical and experimental results {{and the effect of}} end plate on a low aspect ratio control fin. When the end plate was attached to the movable control fin, the lift increased and the <b>actuator</b> <b>shaft</b> torque did not significantly change. As this means less consumption of the <b>actuator</b> <b>shaft</b> torque compared to the control fin that has the same control force, the inner actuator capacity can be reduced and energy consumption can be saved.

40|$|A {{robot system}} {{for use in}} an {{enclosed}} environment was designed and tested. The conceptual design {{will be used to}} assist in research performed by the Controlled Ecological Life Support System (CELSS) project. Design specifications include maximum load capacity, operation at specified environmental conditions, low maintenance, and safety. The robot system must not be hazardous to the sealed environment, and be capable of stowing and deploying within a minimum area of the CELSS chamber facility. This design consists of a telescoping robot arm that slides vertically on a shaft positioned {{in the center of the}} CELSS chamber. The telescoping robot arm consists of a series of links which can be fully extended to a length equal to the radius of the working envelope of the CELSS chamber. The vertical motion of the robot arm is achieved through the use of a combination ball screw/ball spline actuator system. The robot arm rotates cylindrically about the vertical axis through use of a turntable bearing attached to a central mounting structure fitted to the <b>actuator</b> <b>shaft.</b> The shaft is installed in an overhead rail system allowing the entire structure to be stowed and deployed within the CELSS chamber. The overhead rail system is located above the chamber's upper lamps and extends to the center of the CELSS chamber. The mounting interface of the <b>actuator</b> <b>shaft</b> and rail system allows the entire <b>actuator</b> <b>shaft</b> to be detached and removed from the CELSS chamber. When the <b>actuator</b> <b>shaft</b> is deployed, it is held fixed at the bottom of the chamber by placing a square knob on the bottom of the shaft into a recessed square fitting in the bottom of the chamber floor. A support boot ensures the rigidity of the shaft. Three student teams combined into one group designed a model of the CELSS chamber robot that they could build. They investigated materials, availability, and strength in their design. After the model arm and stand were built, the class performed pre-tests on the entire system. A stability pre-test was used to determine whether the model robot arm would tip over on the stand when it was fully extended. Results showed the stand tipped when 50 Newtons were applied horizontally to the top of the vertical shaft while the arm was fully extended. This proved that it was stable. Another pre-test was the actuator slip test used to determine if there is an adequate coefficient of friction between the actuator drive wheels and drive cable to enable the actuator to fully extend and retract the arm. This pre-test revealed that the coefficient of friction was not large enough to prevent slippage. Sandpaper was glued to the drive wheel and this eliminated the slippage problem. The class preformed a fit test in the CELSS chamber to ensure that the completed robot arm is capable of reaching the entire working envelope. The robot was centered in the chamber and the arm was fully extended to the sides of the chamber. The arm was also able to retract to clear the drain pipes separating the upper and lower plant trays...|$|E

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to improve the power efficiency of robotic locomotion through the use of series elastic actuation, with a focus on swimming motion. To achieve high efficiency, electromechanical drives need to be actuated at high speed and low torque. However, in many robots, the drives are actuated in a low speed and high torque mode, resulting in lower efficiency. Implementing gear trains is one option to rise the input speed and lower the input torque. However gear trains have their own loss which are particularly severe at high gear ratios, and are not back drivable in some cases. In this thesis, we envision and design a new pulse drive type of series elastic electromechanical actuators that seeks to break such tradeoffs and improve overall robotic propulsion drive efficiency. An energy storage element, such as a spring, is installed between the EM actuator and the load. In the fast actuation phase, a pulse displacement/ torque trajectory is applied to the <b>actuator</b> <b>shaft</b> so that the spring is rapidly charged with potential energy. In the slow driving phase, the <b>actuator</b> <b>shaft</b> is locked by a low power mechanical latch and the spring slowly transfers energy into the load. We analytically determine that the most efficient pulse condition is reached when the frequency of the pulse trajectory is close to the natural frequency of the actuator inertia-spring system. Our first low power hardware demonstration without the gearbox transmission shows that the pulse drive achieves an energy efficiency of 80 % compared to an efficiency of 50 % achieved in the conventional direct drive where an electromechanical actuator is driving a viscous load equal to its own motor constant. Another low power hardware demonstration using gear motors at two loads, whose impedances are 10 times and 20 times as high as the driver motor constant, shows that the pulse drive using a motor with a one-stage gearbox transmission achieves an efficiency of 50 %, which are approximately 20 % higher than the conventional drive with either a one-stage or a two-stage gearbox transmission. An analytical study on the influence of motor size shows that the efficiency gain of the pulse drive becomes larger at smaller motors and that the best option for the pulse drive is to use a motor with a one-stage gearbox. In a third hardware demonstration, we scale up the power level to match that of a small robotic fish, and use a real viscous load. By using the same brushless motor with a one-stage gearbox, we achieve a pulse drive efficiency of 70 % compared to 15 % in the conventional gear drive. Some potential targets are robots with cyclical propulsions and high impedance load, e. g., tail actuation in fish-like swimming robots, wing actuation in flying robots and crawling and other motions in snake-like robots. by Zhen Sun.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{vibration}} control of flexible shafts {{by means of}} rotorfixed piezoelectric materials. The target is to realize compact solutions for the suppression of problematic resonant vibration at so-called flexural critical speeds. For analysis, parametric finite element models of flexible rotors with piezoceramic sheets and strain or displacement sensors are developed, where the number of degrees of freedom is kept low. Several mechanisms which can destabilize flexible rotors are quantisized, such as rotor material damping, dissipation of currents induced in rotor-fixed piezoceramics and active feedback control proportional to rotor strain rates. The effectiveness of low frequency feedback and feedforward control for {{the suppression of the}} unbalance response is demonstrated using analytic and experimental results. Emphasis is on the interaction between the dynamics of the rotor and that of the connected electronic circuits.
