40|$|River Mondego {{represents}} a stronghold for anadromous fish species highly interesting from conservation and socioeconomic views, like sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus L.), allis shad (Alosa alosa L.) and twaite shad (Alosa fallax Lacépède, 1800). A vertical slot fishway {{was built in}} 2011 at the Açude-Ponte Dam in Coimbra, the first unsurmountable obstacle for migratory fish in River Mondego since 1981. The fishway monitoring program included: i) the fishway effectiveness for anadromous species; ii) the main environmental factors related with fish passage success; and iii) the impact of professional fishing activities in these populations. A video recording system was used to monitor fishway effectiveness. Simultaneously, eight abiotic parameters were continuously recorded. Boosted Regression Trees (BRTs) were applied to relate fishway’s use by sea lamprey and Alosa spp. with abiotic predictors. A passive integrated transponder (PIT) antenna system was also used to quantify passage efficiency for sea lampreys. A sample of the professional fisherman population was surveyed, and respective daily catches registered. Data counts, fishway efficiency and professional fishermen surveys allowed the estimation {{of the number of}} sea lampreys entering River Mondego to spawn. Video counts revealed that 8333 and 21979 sea lampreys, in 2013 and 2014, respectively, used the fishway, and 7503 and 3404 Alosa spp. passed during the same periods. BRTs identified flow as the most important variable explaining fishway use, suggesting that anadromous species prefer to use the fishway at relatively low flow conditions. About 30 % of PIT-tagged lampreys transposed the fishway in the migratory season of 2014. Data surveys indicate a total catch of 11114 and 31746 sea lampreys, during 2013 and 2014, respectively, and 3053 and 6637 <b>allis</b> <b>shads</b> in the same seasons. Hence, we estimated that 38891 and 105006 sea lampreys entered River Mondego to reproduce in 2013 and 2014, respectively...|$|E
40|$|The Severn Estuary is {{the second}} largest estuary in the UK and has been {{designated}} a cSAC because it contains habitat types and species that are rare or threatened in Europe, including the anadromous river and sea lampreys and the twaite and <b>allis</b> <b>shads.</b> Extensive intertidal mud and sandflats support vast numbers of benthic invertebrates, fish and internationally important populations of wading birds. More than a hundred species of fish have been identified from the Severn Estuary and its seaward extension, the Bristol Channel. Most of {{our knowledge of the}} estuary’s fish community comes from individuals entrained on the cooling water-intake screens used at power stations sited along the English and Welsh shores. Fish abundance at Hinkley Point power station situated at the seaward margin of the estuary in Bridgewater Bay, has been monitored for more than 25 years and similar records are available from Oldbury power station from the 1970 s and 1990 s. These data have been used to describe the biology and ecology of the more abundant species of fish and crustaceans in the estuary. Power station samples have enabled factors that affect seasonal and annual variations in the abundance of individual species to be elucidated. The pattern of fish abundance that emerges is one in which sequential waves of different species enter the estuary at specific times of year. These seasonal changes in the fish assemblage are remarkably consistent, but the abundance of individual species can fluctuate markedly from year to year depending on breeding success, juvenile recruitment, changing temperatures, salinity and freshwater discharge. The most abundant species of fish consist primarily of the juveniles of marine species that utilise the estuary as a nursery that are termed marine estuarine-opportunists. Other life-cycle categories include marine stragglers and freshwater species that occasionally stray into estuarine waters, and anadromous and catadromous species that use the estuary as a migratory corridor. The report reviews the biology and ecology of 27 species that are dependant on the estuary for at least some part of their life-cycle and considers factors affecting their seasonal abundance, growth, behaviour and conservation status. Possible reasons for the marked increase in fish abundance that has occurred gradually since the 1970 s and more rapidly since 2002 are discussed. The fact that sediment and water quality in the estuary has improved, particularly with regard to heavy metal contamination, may partly explain the increase in fish numbers, but increases in water temperature linked to climate change are likely to be very significant. Other factors that may adversely affect the fish community and threaten its stability include the proposal to construct a barrage across the estuary that will affect the distribution of sediment and interfere with the migratory activity of protected species. Of particular concern is the potential for turbine-induced mortality that is likely to be very significant for some migratory species and also for those marine estuarine-opportunists that show seasonal movements {{in and out of the}} estuary. The report concludes by summarising the health of the estuarine fish assemblage and makes recommendations for its future management and conservation...|$|E
