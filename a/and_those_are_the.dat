500|$|News of Barrymore's {{success in}} Hamlet piqued the {{interest}} of Warner Bros., which signed him as {{the lead in the}} 1924 film Beau Brummel. Unhappy in his marriage, Barrymore– aged 40 at the time– sought solace elsewhere and had an affair with his 17-year-old co-star Mary Astor during filming. Although the film was not an unqualified success, the cast, including Barrymore, was generally praised. Around this time, Barrymore acquired the nickname [...] "the Great Profile", as posters and photographs of him tended to favor the left-hand side. He later said: [...] "The right side of my face looks like a fried egg. The left side has features that {{are to be found in}} almost any normal anthropological specimen, <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> apples I try to keep on top of the barrel." ...|$|E
500|$|Before {{production}} began, {{the production}} team sought out Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, or Korean vocal talents. Tia Carrere {{was an early}} candidate to voice the title character, and Lea Salonga, {{who had been the}} singing voice of Princess Jasmine in Aladdin, was also cast as Mulan's speaking voice, but the directors did not find her attempt at a deeper speaking voice when Mulan impersonated Ping convincing, so Ming-Na Wen was brought in to speak the role. Salonga returned to provide the singing voice. Wen herself landed the role after the filmmakers listened to her narration at the beginning of The Joy Luck Club. Coats reflected on her decision, stating [...] "When we heard Ming-Na doing that voice-over, we knew we had our Mulan. She has a very likable and lovely voice, <b>and</b> <b>those</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> qualities we were looking for." [...] For the role of Mushu, Disney was aiming for top Hollywood talent in the vein of Robin Williams's performance as the Genie, and approached Eddie Murphy, who at first balked during recording in the Disney studios, and asked to record the voice in his basement at his Bubble Hill mansion in Englewood, New Jersey. For the speaking voice of Captain Li Shang, B. D. Wong was hired, although his singing voice, for the song [...] "I'll Make a Man Out of You", was performed by Donny Osmond, who had originally auditioned as the speaking voice of the title character in Hercules. Osmond's casting originated from a suggestion from the casting director, and throughout recording, Osmond studied Wong's dialogue tapes, and aimed to match his inflections and personality. Osmond commented that his sons decided that he had finally [...] "made it" [...] in show business when he was in a Disney film. Likewise for the role of Grandmother Fa, June Foray provided for the speaking voice, and Marni Nixon supplied the singing voice.|$|E
