50|$|An {{employee}} of Scrimgeour, Mr Roberts, fraudulently told Smith New Court {{that there were}} close rival bids for buying shares in Ferranti IS Inc. Smith bought £23.1m worth of shares. Ferranti then revealed it {{was a victim of}} a massive fraud (the ‘Guerin’ fraud, an American businessman had sold them a worthless company) and the share price fell considerably. Smith sold the shares for £11,788,204, a loss of £11,353,220. Smith then brought an <b>action</b> <b>for</b> <b>deceit.</b>|$|E
50|$|The broad {{distinction}} between this offence and larceny {{is that in}} the former the owner intends to part with his property, in the latter he does not. This offence dates as a statutory crime practically from 1756. At common law the only remedy originally available for an owner who had been deprived of his goods by fraud was an indictment for the crime of cheating, or a civil <b>action</b> <b>for</b> <b>deceit.</b> These remedies were insufficient to cover all cases where money or other properties had been obtained by false pretences, and the offence was first partially created by a statute of Henry VIII (1541), which enacted that if any person should falsely and deceitfully obtain any money, goods, &c., by means of any false token or counterfeit letter made in any other man's name, the offender should suffer any punishment other than death, at the discretion of the judge. The scope of the offence was enlarged to include practically all false pretences by the Act of 1756, the provisions of which were embodied in the Larceny Act 1861.|$|E

25|$|Further {{illustrations}} are plentiful. In East v Maurer where Maurer lied that {{he would}} not set up a barber competing with the one he was selling to East, Maurer was liable for East's normal market lost profits, costs of improvements and the price paid minus the business' selling price. In Smith New Court Ltd v Scrimgeour Vickers (Asset Management) Ltd Smith New Court Ltd was deceitfully told there were close rival bids for shares in a company called Ferranti IS Inc. Smith New Court Ltd bought, but then it transpired that massive fraud had occurred. The Court of Appeal held that only £1.2m was recoverable, the difference between the market price at the time of purchase and the real price, but the House of Lords held that the full losses of £11.8m were recoverable (even though the fraud was unconnected to the misrepresentation) because that loss was one which Smith New Court Ltd had due to entering the transaction after being deceived. In practice, because an <b>action</b> <b>for</b> negligent misrepresentation has now been developed through Hedley Byrne and the Misrepresentation Act 1967 s 2(1), it is often not beneficial to sue <b>for</b> <b>deceit.</b> The only certain difference is that the defence of contributory negligence is unavailable in a deceit action. But deceit is harder to prove, since evidence of a person's state of mind is needed. Because the charge can sink people's reputations, alleging deceit is also contrary to professional conduct rules at the bar, unless a good case exists. A large difference which is subject to debate, is that the causation and remoteness rules are more generous <b>for</b> <b>deceit.</b> Certainly this is true when comparing negligence and deceit. However, the Misrepresentation Act 1967 s 2(1), which was modelled on the law as it stood when the Act was passed, has the same causation rules as <b>for</b> <b>deceit</b> (see below).|$|R

40|$|Being {{the most}} broadly used tool <b>for</b> <b>deceit</b> measurement, the {{polygraph}} {{is a limited}} method as it suffers from human operator subjectivity {{and the fact that}} target subjects are aware of the measurement, which invites the opportunity to alter their behavior or plan counter-measures in advance. The approach presented in this paper attempts to circumvent these problems by unobtrusively and automatically measuring several prior identified Deceit Indicators (DIs) based upon involuntary, so-called reliable facial expressions through computer vision analysis of image sequences in real time. Reliable expressions are expressions said by the psychology community to be impossible for a significant percentage of the population to convincingly simulate, without feeling a true inner felt emotion. The strategy is to detect the difference between those expressions which arise from internal emotion, implying verity, and those expressions which are simulated, implying deceit. First, a group of Facial Action Units (AUs) related to the reliable expressions are detected based on distance and texture based features. The DIs then can be measured and finally a decision of deceit or verity will be made accordingly. The performance of this proposed approach is evaluated by its real time implementation <b>for</b> <b>deceit</b> detection. 1...|$|R
