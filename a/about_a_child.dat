25|$|Her novel, Spring Riot, was {{published}} in 1948 and got mixed reviews. Her next effort was a play, which she sent to producer Bob Whitehead. Because he had produced Member of the Wedding, she thought he would like it since her play was also <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> but the play came back from Whitehead's office rejected. Allen waited {{for a couple of}} months and sent it back, rightly figuring that some reader had rejected it instead of Whitehead himself. This time Whitehead read the play and instantly optioned it, but due to casting problems her play was never produced on stage. The reader who had initially rejected her play was Lewis M. Allen, whom she would later marry.|$|E

In order to save the tree and the camp, someone must recover the Golden Fleece, which is somewhere in the Sea of Monsters. At the same time, Percy finds out that Grover, who has left on a quest to find the missing god Pan, has been captured by the cyclops Polyphemus and that the Fleece is on Polyphemus' island. Together with Annabeth and his half-brother Tyson, a cyclops, Percy sets out to rescue Grover. Meanwhile, Clarisse La Rue, daughter of Ares, is sent on an official quest by Camp Half-Blood to retrieve the Fleece. The trip to the Sea of Monsters is long and hazardous and along the way the heroes encounter several dangers including Scylla and Charybdis, the sorceress Circe, the Sirens and their former friend Luke Castellan. Percy also learns about a prophecy from the Oracle <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> of one of the three most important gods (Zeus, Poseidon and Hades), playing a vital part in {{the success or failure of}} the resurrection of Kronos the Titan-King. The heroes eventually retrieve the Fleece and restore Thalia's tree but also unknowingly revive Thalia herself, daughter of Zeus, who had been turned into the tree by her father when she died.|$|E

[...] The four guards saw the charges against them dropped and were reinstated to their positions; they declined to talk to The Fifth Estate. The Corrections Service of Canada viewed the case as closed, and while the current minister did talk to Hana Gartner, CSC refused any interviews with the reporter, while a lawsuit was pending.|$|E

500|$|Series creator Rob Thomas was {{initially}} worried about including the reunion between Apollo and Kizza {{because he thought}} that such scenes did not play to his strengths as a storyteller. However, he {{was pleased with the}} result because of the two actors' performances. The two performers had never met each other prior to this scene, and they were filming within four minutes of setup time. One quip by Vinnie (Ken Marino) about the office's secretaries was a callback to a similar joke in [...] "Of Vice and Men". Thomas was inspired to focus an episode on a former Ugandan child soldier by two incidents. The first was when he {{was initially}} informed about the situation by a former student of his mother's, while at Christmas the previous year, Hansen had given books about Ugandan child soldiers to all the writers. In the episode, Apollo is scheduled to appear on The Oprah Winfrey Show; Oprah's Book Club was discussing a book <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> soldier at the time, but this was a coincidence. In the episode, Piz states that he has been given an internship with Pitchfork Media at their headquarters in New York City; however, the location is incorrect.|$|E
500|$|As the {{principal}} designer, Hall's personal experiences and philosophies strongly impacted the game: Keen's red shoes and Green Bay Packers football helmet were items Hall wore as a child, dead enemies left behind corpses {{due to his}} belief that child players should be taught that death had permanent consequences, and enemies were based loosely on his reading of Sigmund Freud's psychological theories, {{such as that of}} the id. Other influences on Hall for the game were Duck Dodgers in the 24½th Century (1953) and other Chuck Jones cartoons, and [...] "The Available Data on the Worp Reaction", a 1953 short story by Lion Miller <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> constructing a spaceship. Keen's [...] "Bean-with-Bacon" [...] spaceship was taken from a George Carlin skit about using bay leaves as deodorant so as to smell like soup. Keen was intended to be a reflection of Hall as he had wanted to be as a child. The team separated the game from its Super Mario Bros. roots by adding non-linear exploration and additional mechanics like the pogo stick. A suggestion from Miller that part of the popularity of Super Mario Bros was the presence of secrets and hidden areas in the game led Hall to add several secrets, such as an entire hidden level in the first episode, and a [...] "Galactic Alphabet" [...] in which signs in the game were written, which if deciphered by the players revealed hidden messages, jokes, and instructions.|$|E

500|$|The game's {{design was}} largely driven by Tom Hall: Romero and {{especially}} John Carmack were focused {{almost exclusively on}} the programming; Wilbur {{was not involved in}} the game's design; and Adrian Carmack joined late in development and found the project's [...] "cute" [...] art style, till then mostly created by Hall, far-removed from his preferred, darker, style.

500|$|The album's {{title track}} was said by band members {{to be the}} {{continuation}} of [...] "Final Six", which was an outtake from their previous album.

The track was explained by guitarist Jeff Hanneman to initially be about the human race dying off by a mutative disease.

[...] "Playing With Dolls" [...] is <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> witnessing a serial killer. [...] "Beauty Through Order" [...] is about Elizabeth Báthory, the most prolific female serial killer. Jeff Hanneman explained: [...] "I've been meaning to write a song about that for a long time. I couldn't figure out the angle, I was thinking, 'How does a woman write? I can't write like a woman I'm a guy!' Then I just figured, 'Well, she's evil; she has lots of power and killed people.'

Bailey discusses psychologist and sexologist Kenneth Zucker's work with children whose parents have noticed significant gender-atypical behaviors. [...] Bailey uses the anecdote about Danny to describe gender identity disorder, a label applied to males with significant feminine behaviors and females with significant masculine behaviors, such as cross-dressing. For example, this class includes boys that prefer to play with dolls and regularly identify with female characters in stories or movies, and girls that prefer to play with toy cars and identify with male characters. This section of the book also discusses some case studies of men who were, for varying reasons, reassigned to the female sex shortly after their birth, and emphasizes the fact that, despite this, they tended to exhibit typically male characteristics and often identified as men.|$|E
