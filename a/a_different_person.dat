5|$|As Ziva and Tony {{drive home}} from the airport, she divulges the reason for her resentment of the new director: Orli Elbaz {{was the reason for}} her parents' divorce. She {{discloses}} that she had always believed that it was a political strategy on Elbaz's part in attempt to advance her rank in Mossad, though she now thinks that it is possible that Elbaz had loved Eli.

5|$|Cordova-Buckley, {{who began}} {{appearing}} on the show during the third season, {{was surprised to find}} the writers' characterization of Rodriguez in the episode to closely mirror her own life. Cordova-Buckley stated that, like how Rodriguez is seen in the episode, she dislikes nightclubs, and has found herself changing over time to be <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>person</b> from who her old friends remember; for Cordova-Buckley, this was seen in returning to Mexico after becoming an actor in the United States, which is reflected with Rodriguez's friends from Colombia from before she worked with S.H.I.E.L.D. as an Inhuman asset.|$|E

5|$|The Aniplex {{producer}} of Angel Beats!, Hironori Toba, was interviewed in the November 2009 issue of Dengeki G's Magazine, where he commented that a 13-episode anime with about 21 minutes per episode {{was not enough}} to tell the whole story of Angel Beats! Maeda had envisioned. Therefore, the various additional media, such as the illustrated short stories and manga, contain some of the story that was unable to make it into the anime because of time constraints. Toba wanted fans of the series to be able to enjoy it to the fullest by exploring all of the media types. Maeda found it tiring to go back and forth between Osaka and Tokyo for business meetings {{when he was in the}} process of writing the script, and found it difficult to write an entire script by himself, since he had never done that before with any of the games he produced as a member of Key. It was only after the script was done that Maeda was able to work on the music, which he greatly enjoyed and never tired of it. Maeda composed about 15 songs for Girls Dead Monster and spent about two days each composing each song. He made sure to create songs for Girls Dead Monster that high school girls would compose, including the lyrics. Due to this, Maeda pointed out that the opening and ending theme songs for Angel Beats!, which Maeda also composed, sound like they were composed by <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>person</b> compared to the Girls Dead Monster songs.|$|E

500|$|Petersen had {{difficulty}} ridding {{himself of the}} Will Graham character after principal photography wrapped. While rehearsing for a play in Chicago, he felt the old character [...] "always coming out" [...] instead of his new role. To try and rid himself of the character, Petersen went to a barbershop where he had them shave his beard, cut his hair and dye it blond {{so that he could}} look into the mirror and see <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>person.</b> At first he felt it was due to the rigorous shooting schedule for Manhunter, but later realized that the character [...] "had creeped in".|$|E

Well, just because you are young doesn't mean that you haven't had a hard life. It's been difficult for me, moving around so much, having to grow up by myself, basically on my own, my parents divorced. And I always felt kind of different from everyone else in my neighborhoods. I was <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>person</b> – ethnically. And sometimes {{that can be a}} problem.

[...] From these, Marquis gives specific credits to Limpy, Pine, Bobtail Horse, Sun Bear, Black Horse, Two Feathers, Wolf Chief, Little Sun, Blackbird, Big Beaver, White Moon, White Wolf, Big Crow, Medicine Bull, and the younger Little Wolf.

500|$|Ray Davies' marital {{problems}} {{during this period}} began to affect the band adversely, particularly after his wife, Rasa, took their children and left him in June 1973. Davies became depressed; during a July gig at White City Stadium he told the audience he was [...] "fucking sick of the whole thing", and was retiring. He subsequently collapsed after a drug overdose and was taken to hospital. With Ray Davies in a seemingly critical condition, plans were discussed for Dave to continue as frontman in a worst-case scenario. Ray recovered from his illness {{as well as his}} depression, but throughout the remainder of the Kinks' theatrical incarnation the band's output remained uneven, and their already fading popularity declined even more. John Dalton later commented that when Davies [...] "decided to work again ... I don't think he was totally better, and he's been <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>person</b> ever since." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics lauded Hathaway and McAvoy for the {{chemistry}} between their characters, finding that it lent authenticity to the love story between Austen and Lefroy. While Hathaway was admired for her performance by some critics, some reviews negatively {{focused on her}} nationality {{as well as the}} inauthenticity of her accent. James McAvoy defended the decision of casting Hathaway by stating that a director should, [...] "find the right actor…and [...] is undoubtedly brilliant." [...] Hathaway herself admitted the persistent tendency to [...] "sound too much like myself and not at all like Jane", blaming cold weather in Ireland, which meant she had to do voice retakes for several scenes. Nonetheless, Jarrold praised Hathaway for her performance. In a wrap up party after the filming, the director confessed that the actress had been <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>person,</b> [...] "not just her accent but also the whole character, the way of holding yourself and speaking was so completely different".|$|E
