40|$|AbstractThe {{pathogenicity}} of feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) {{is known}} to depend on macrophage tropism, and this macrophage infection is enhanced by mediation via <b>anti-S</b> <b>antibody</b> (antibody-dependent enhancement, ADE). In this study, we found that TNF-alpha production was increased with viral replication in macrophages inoculated {{with a mixture of}} FIPV and <b>anti-S</b> <b>antibody,</b> and demonstrated that this culture supernatant had feline PBMC apoptosis-inducing activity. We also demonstrated that the expression level of the FIPV virus receptor, feline aminopeptidase N (fAPN), was increased in macrophages of FIP cats. For upregulation of TNF-alpha and fAPN in macrophages, viral replication in macrophages is necessary, and their expressions were increased by ADE of FIPV infection. It was demonstrated that a heat-resistant fAPN-inducing factor was present in the culture supernatant of FIPV-infected macrophages, and this factor was TNF-alpha: fAPN expression was upregulated in recombinant feline TNF-alpha-treated macrophages, and FIPV infectivity was increased in these macrophages. These findings suggested that FIPV replication in macrophages increases TNF-alpha production in macrophages, and the produced TNF-alpha acts and upregulates fAPN expression, increasing FIPV sensitivity...|$|E

F-DHPE is easily labeled to the outer surface of chromatophores. In the range of pH 7. 0 to 9. 0, Xuorescence intensity is {{sensitive to}} pH changes. The sensitivity is especially great in the range of pH 8. 2 to 9. 0, so pH 8. 6 was chosen as the appropriate experimental condition. It is shown that added ATP not only acts as a Xuorescence quencher but also can be hydro-lyzed by F 0 F 1 -ATPase to pump protons into chromatophores, resulting in Xuorescence restoration. A stimulator (NaSO 3) and various types of inhibitors (NaN 3, 5 -adenylyl imidodiphosphate [AMP–PNP], and N,N-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide [DCCD]) of F 0 F 1 con-Wrmed that Xuorescence restoration is caused by ATP-driven proton Xux. When loaded with one <b>antibody</b> (<b>anti-</b> <b>antibody)</b> or two <b>antibodies</b> (<b>anti-</b> <b>antibody</b> and sheep to rabbit second antibody), F 0 F 1 -ATPase exhibits lower proton pumping activities, as indicated by Xuorescence restoration.

40|$|International audienceWe {{investigated}} {{the influence of}} assay choice on the results in a two-tier testing algorithm {{for the detection of}} <b>anti-</b> <b>antibodies.</b> Eighty-nine serum samples from clinically well-defined patients were tested in eight different enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) systems based on whole-cell antigens, whole-cell antigens supplemented with VlsE and assays using exclusively recombinant proteins. A subset of samples was tested in five immunoblots: one whole-cell blot, one whole-cell blot supplemented with VlsE and three recombinant blots. The number of IgM- and/or IgG-positive ELISA results in the group of patients suspected of infection ranged from 34 to 59 %. The percentage of positives in cross-reactivity controls ranged from 0 to 38 %. Comparison of immunoblots yielded large differences in inter-test agreement and showed, at best, a moderate agreement between tests. Remarkably, some immunoblots gave positive results in samples that had been tested negative by all eight ELISAs. The percentage of positive blots following a positive ELISA result depended heavily on the choice of ELISA-immunoblot combination. We conclude that the assays used to detect <b>anti-</b> <b>antibodies</b> have widely divergent sensitivity and specificity. The choice of ELISA-immunoblot combination severely influences the number of positive results, making the exchange of test results between laboratories with different methodologies hazardous...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{therapeutic}} vaccine for chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection that enhances virus-specific cellular immune responses is urgently needed. The "prime-boost" regimen {{is a widely}} used vaccine strategy against many persistence infections. However, few reports have addressed this strategy applying for HBV {{therapeutic vaccine}} development. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To develop an effective HBV therapeutic vaccine, we constructed a recombinant vaccinia virus (Tiantan) containing the S+PreS 1 fusion antigen (RVJSS 1) combined with the HBV particle-like subunit vaccine HBVSS 1 to explore the most effective prime-boost regimen against HBV. The immune responses to different prime-boost regimens were assessed in C 57 BL/C mice by ELISA, ELISpot assay and Intracellular cytokine staining analysis. Among the combinations tested, an HBV protein particle vaccine priming and recombinant vaccinia virus boosting strategy accelerated specific seroconversion and produced high antibody (anti-PreS 1, <b>anti-S</b> <b>antibody)</b> titres {{as well as the}} strongest multi-antigen (PreS 1, and S) -specific cellular immune response. HBSS 1 protein prime/RVJSS 1 boost immunization was also generated more significant level of both CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cell responses for Th 1 cytokines (TNF-α and IFN-γ). CONCLUSIONS: The HBSS 1 protein-vaccine prime plus RVJSS 1 vector boost elicits specific antibody as well as CD 4 and CD 8 cells secreting Th 1 -like cytokines, and these immune responses may be important parameters for the future HBV therapeutic vaccines...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Virus-specific {{cellular}} immune responses play {{a critical}} role in virus clearance during acute or chronic HBV infection. Currently, the commercially available HBV vaccine is combined with alum adjuvant, which stimulates mainly Th 2 immune responses. Therefore, development of new therapeutic HBV vaccine adjuvants and immune strategies that also promote Th 1 and CTL responses is urgently needed. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To improve the immunity induced by the novel HBSS 1 HBV vaccine, we evaluated the ability of adjuvants, including alum, CpG and polyriboinosinic polyribocytidylic acid [poly(I:C) ], to enhance the response when boosted with the recombinant adenoviral vector vaccine rAdSS 1. The immune responses to different adjuvant combinations were assessed in C 57 BL/ 6 mice by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), ELISpot and cytokine release assays. Among the combinations tested, a HBV protein particle vaccine with CpG/alum and poly(I:C) /alum priming combinations accelerated specific seroconversion and produced high antibody (anti-PreS 1, <b>anti-S</b> <b>antibody)</b> titres with a Th 1 bias. After boosting with recombinant adenoviral vector vaccine rAdSS 1, both groups produced a strong multi-antigen (S and PreS 1) -specific cellular immune response. HBSS 1 immunisation with poly(I:C) /alum priming also generated high-level CD 4 (+) and CD 8 (+) T cell responses in terms of Th 1 cytokines (IFN-γ and IL- 2). CONCLUSIONS: The protein-vaccine HBSS 1 with mixed poly(I:C) /alum adjuvant priming, followed by a rAdSS 1 vaccine boost, maximises specific antibody and Th 1 -biased cellular immune responses. This regime might prove useful in the development of HBV therapeutic vaccines. Furthermore, this promising strategy might be applied to vaccines against other persistent infections, such as human immunodeficiency virus and tuberculosis...|$|E

Using immunofluorescence microscopy we found discrete fluorescent spots on plasma membranes in cross sections of liver tissues after incubation with <b>anti-</b> 26 K <b>antibodies.</b> This {{is consistent with the}} notion of specific binding to gap junction plaques. Quantitative binding of <b>anti-</b> 26 K <b>antibodies</b> was indirectly measured by the protein A-gold technique. We found that urea/detergent-treated, purified gap junction plaques bind 30 -fold more <b>anti-</b> 26 K <b>antibodies</b> than preimmune serum. <b>Anti-</b> 26 K <b>antibodies</b> also bind specifically to native gap junction plaques within hepatic plasma membranes although only about one fifth as efficiently as to purified plaques. Possibly the <b>anti-</b> 26 K <b>antibodies</b> raised after injection of SDS-denatured 26 K protein into rabbits recognize the cytoplasmic face of urea/detergent-treated plaques better than that of native plaques. Some, if not most, of the vesicular structures in preparations of purified plaques appear to be derived from split gap junction plaques and are probably sheets of gap junction hemichannels. In some vesicles the former cytoplasmic face of the hemichannels is turned outside, other vesicles have the former cell surface turned outside. The <b>anti-</b> 26 K <b>antibodies</b> do not recognize any 26 K protein on the sheets of partially split gap junction plaques, on the heterogeneous vesicular structures, or on non-junctional areas of hepatic plasma membranes. These results suggest that the conformation of the 26 K protein in plaques must be {{different from that of the}} 26 K protein in earlier biosynthetic steps of plaque assembly...|$|R

40|$|The {{hepatitis}} B {{virus genome}} carries the surface antigen (SAg) gene {{and an open}} reading frame that encodes two SAg-related polypeptides: SAg with a 55 -amino-acid N-terminal extension polypeptide and SAg with a 174 -amino-acid N-terminal extension polypeptide. These are termed middle S and large S, respectively. These polypeptides or their glycosylated derivatives have been detected in Dane particles, but their chemical and biological properties have remained largely unknown because of their limited availability. We attempted to produce these proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by placing the coding regions {{under the control of}} the promoter of the yeast glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene. Yeast cells carrying middle S and large S coding sequences produced 33, 000 - and 42, 000 -dalton products, respectively, each of which reacted with <b>anti-S</b> <b>antibody</b> and bound to polymerized human serum albumin, in accordance with the known properties of pre-S proteins from particles in human sera (K.

The middle S polypeptide is glycosylated and can be assembled into particles whose size and density are similar to those of SAg. However, this polypeptide was highly susceptible to proteolytic degradation into 29, 000 - and 26, 000 -dalton polypeptides, of which only the former retained the binding activity to polymerized albumin. The large S polypeptides are nonglycosylated, relatively stable, and do not seem to assemble into particles by themselves...|$|E

The aim {{of the study was}} to present some clinical and immunologic features of retinal vasculitis in systemic diseases: systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, sarcoidosis, Behcet's diseases, and others. Methods. A total of 1 254 patients with uveitis were included in the study. The immunochemical diagnostic methods were used to determine the pathogenesis of ocular manifestations. Ocular manifestations were examined using biomicroscope, direct or indirect ophtalmoscopy. Results. Primary retinal vasculitis was diagnosed in 85 / 1254 (6. 8 %) of total uveitis. In more than half of the cases of vasculitis (58. 8 %), both arteries and veins were involved in inflammatory process. Periphlebitis was diagnosed far more commonly (36. 5 %) than periarteritis (4. 7 %). Retinal vasculitis associated with systemic lupus erythematosus was characterized by microinfarctions and the consequent foci of inflammatory cells or diseases of large arteries manifesting in vasospasm and occlusions. Cotton wool spots occurred in 38. 3 % and retinal hemorrhages in 34 % of the cases. In this study periphlebitis of the retina was one of the less frequent ocular manifestations of multiple sclerosis. Comparing with the other changes of the retinal blood vessels, venous sheating occurred in 25. 1 % and occlusion and vein trombosis in 43. 75 % of the cases. Retinal vasculitis associated with chronic sarcoidosis occured in 37. 5 % of patients with sarcoidosis. The most frequent manifestation of ocular sarcoidosis was intermediary uveitis (43. 75 %). Anterior granulomatous uveitis occured in 37. 5 % of patients with sarcoidoses. Immune complexes occurred in 13 / 20 (65 %) of the patients. Antiretinal <b>anti-S</b> <b>antibody</b> in the serum occurred in 73 % of the patients with retinal detachment as a complication of primary disease and in 25 % those with vasculitis. Conclusion. Systemic diseases such as Behcet's syndrome, collagen vascular diseases, systemic granulomatous diseases (sarcoidosis and tuberculosis) were the main causes of retinal vasculitis. Knowledge of the symptomatology and pathogenesis of retinal vasculitis is of the major significance for the diagnosis and therapy of the disease...|$|E

In vitro studies indicate that the 460 -Id-bearing component of the anti-TNP response to the TI antigen, TNP-Nocardia water-soluble mitogen (NWSM), is regulated by a 460 -Id-specific suppressor T cell found in the spleen of normal BALB/c mice (1). In this communication, we report the results of experiments in which we studied the effect of <b>anti-</b> 460 -Id <b>antibodies</b> and ofanti-[anti- 460 -Id] antibodies on the response to two TI TNP antigens. Mice actively immunized with MOPC- 460 or acutely pretreated with <b>anti-</b> 460 -Id <b>antibodies</b> made an anti-TNP response to TNP-NWSM and to TNP-levan which lacked a 460 -Id + component.

Here, we gather novel insights in the immunogenicity of PLY, PsaA, PspA, PspC, NanA, Hyl, PpmA, SlrA, Eno, IgA 1 -protease, PdBD, BVH- 3, SP 1003, SP 1633, SP 1651, SP 0189 and SP 0376. We developed a multiplex bead-based immunoassay (xMAP Technology, Luminex Corporation) to simultaneously quantify antibodies against these 17 pneumococcal proteins in serum. The median fluorescence intensity (MFI) values obtained for human pooled serum with the multiplex assay were between 82 % and 111 % (median 94 %) of those obtained with the singleplex assays. For IgG, {{the coefficient of}} variation (CV) in serum ranged from 2 % to 9 %, for IgA, the CV ranged from 3 % to 14 % and for IgM, the CV ranged from 11 % to 15 %. Using this immunoassay, we showed that anti-pneumococcal antibody levels exhibited extensive inter-individual variability in young children suffering from invasive pneumococcal disease. All proteins, including the proteins with, as yet, unknown function, were immunogenic. In conclusion, the multiplex immunoassay based on proteins is reproducible. This assay {{can be used to}} monitor <b>anti-</b> <b>antibody</b> responses in a material- and time-saving manner...|$|R
40|$|Recent devastating {{outbreaks}} of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in Europe have reopened {{the discussion about}} {{the adequacy of the}} non-vaccination strategy implemented by the EU in 1991. Here we describe the evaluation of a new commercially available test kit for the discrimination between vaccination and infection. The test is based on the detection of antibodies against the recombinant non-structural (NS) protein 3 ABC. In contrast to immunization with vaccines free of 3 ABC, these antibodies are elicited as a consequence of infection. Testing more than 3600 negative sera from several countries revealed a specificity of > 99 % for bovine, ovine, and porcine samples. Antibodies specific for 3 ABC can be detected as soon as 10 days post-infection. As compared with the occurrence of antibodies against structural proteins of FMDV, <b>anti-</b> 3 ABC <b>antibodies</b> can be detected 5 ¿ 10 days later, depending on the species. No <b>anti-</b> 3 ABC <b>antibodies</b> were detected in sera from vaccination experiments or in field sera from vaccinated animals. However, <b>anti-</b> 3 ABC <b>antibodies</b> can be detected in vaccinated animals upon challenge. These results provide evidence that this test can facilitate the use of vaccines in new strategies against FMD...|$|R
40|$|The ribosomal P {{proteins}} {{are necessary}} for GTPase activity during protein synthesis. In addition to antibodies to the P proteins, sera from lupus patients contain anti-rRNA activity. To determine whether lupus antiribosomal sera recognize the region of 28 S rRNA recently proposed to form part of the ribosomal GTPase center, an rRNA fragment corresponding to nucleotides (nt) 1922 - 2020 was transcribed in vitro and tested for antigenicity. 18 of 24 (75 %) lupus sera containing <b>anti-</b> P <b>antibodies,</b> but only 2 of 24 (8 %) lupus sera without anti-P, immunoprecipitated this rRNA fragment (p less than 0. 001). The binding was specific, since {{no significant differences were}} observed between anti-P positive and negative lupus sera in binding to the RNA fragment transcribed in the antisense orientation or to a control region of rRNA. The majority of sera tested protected a rRNA fragment of approximately 68 nucleotides. To evaluate the fine specificity of the <b>anti-</b> 28 S <b>antibodies,</b> deletions and site-directed mutations were made in the RNA fragment. The anti- 28 S antisera required nt 1944 - 1955 for recognition and were remarkably sensitive to destabilizing as well as nondestabilizing mutations in the stems of the RNA fragments. Detection of antiprotein and anti-RNA antibodies directed against a functionally related domain in the ribosome, together with the remarkable specificity of <b>anti-</b> 28 S <b>antibodies,</b> strongly suggests a direct role for this region of the ribosome in initiating and/or maintaining antiribosomal autoantibody production...|$|R
40|$|Human protectin (CD 59) is an 18 - 20 -kD {{membrane}} glycoprotein that restricts lysis {{of human}} erythrocytes and leukocytes by homologous complement. By directly incorporating protectin into membranes of heterologous cells we observed that protectin {{did not prevent}} perforin- mediated killing, whereas complement killing was effectively restricted. Further, no significant enhancement of cell-mediated killing or target killing by purified perforin was observed with <b>anti-</b> protectin <b>antibodies.</b> Thus, in contrast with complement lysis, restriction of lysis by protectin {{does not apply to}} cell-mediated killing...|$|R
