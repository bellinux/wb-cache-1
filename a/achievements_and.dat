E-V beliefs were assessed in seventh grade along with <b>achievement,</b> <b>and</b> enrollment was measured in eighth grade. Differential associations of motivation, <b>achievement,</b> <b>and</b> enrollment were examined across Hispanic and non-Hispanic populations. Expectancy for success and task value uniquely predicted seventh-grade <b>achievement</b> <b>and</b> eighth-grade algebra enrollment after controlling for prior <b>achievement</b> <b>and</b> {{a full set of}} demographic controls, including low socioeconomic status and English fluency. The association of interest value <b>and</b> <b>achievement</b> differentiated across Hispanic and non-Hispanic youth, suggesting that the effect of interest value on mathematics achievement was weaker for Hispanic youth than for non-Hispanics after accounting for success expectations <b>and</b> prior <b>achievement...</b>|$|R

40|$|The California {{and federal}} governments have enacted {{legislation}} to improve student academic achievement {{with a focus on}} allocating resources to the classroom and teacher. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine whether a relationship exists between student academic <b>achievement</b> <b>and</b> the responsibilities of school boards and superintendents. Each responsibility contains a subset of district and school-level practices implemented by the board or superintendent. This author (see Appendix E) designed the District Index of Similar Schools Rankings (DISSR) to measure student achievement in an attempt to limit the impact of school and student characteristics on scores of state-mandated assessments. This study also determined whether a relationship exists between student academic <b>achievement</b> <b>and</b> the tenure of superintendents in their current district. This study took a quantitative approach to measure relationships between student academic <b>achievement</b> <b>and</b> superintendents' perceptions of district effectiveness regarding the school board and superintendent responsibilities. A relationship between student academic <b>achievement</b> <b>and</b> the tenure of superintendents in their current district did not exist. However, a relationship was found between student academic <b>achievement</b> <b>and</b> length of time a superintendent had been a school administrator.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the relationship between the academic <b>achievement</b> <b>and</b> the need for <b>achievement</b> <b>and</b> the need for affiliation for high school students of Oman. Further investigation was carried out if there was a significant difference in the needs for <b>achievement</b> <b>and</b> affiliation between high G. P. A. students and low G. P. A. students as well as between males and females. A self-rating form of 75 items derived from the Edwards Personal Preference Schedule was used to measure the fifteen needs listed by Duncan Osborne (1963). However, the scores on ten items pertaining to need for <b>achievement</b> <b>and</b> need for affiliation were used in this study. Academic achievement was measured by the scores on school tests from the Interior Province of Oman. The results indicated no significant correlation between the academic <b>achievement</b> <b>and</b> the need for <b>achievement</b> <b>and</b> the need for affiliation. The results also showed no significant difference between high G. P. A. students and low G. P. A. students as well as between males and females on either the need for achievement or affiliation.

40|$|This {{research}} aims to: (1) {{describe the}} effectiveness of the use of multimedia in terms of the mathematics learning <b>achievement</b> <b>and</b> interest and (2) investigate the difference of {{the effectiveness of}} mathematics learning <b>achievement</b> <b>and</b> interest on the teaching using multimedia and that not using multimedia. The research population was six classes of the tenth grade students of Senior High School 1 Aimas. Classes XA and XF were established as the research sample randomly. Class A received the lesson with multimedia and class XF received lesson without multimedia. The research instruments were a mathematics <b>achievement</b> test <b>and</b> a questionnaire for the students‟ interest in learning mathematics. The result of research shows that: 1) teaching mathematics using multimedia is effective in terms of mathematics learning <b>achievement</b> <b>and</b> interest; 2) there is a difference in mathematics learning <b>achievement</b> <b>and</b> interest in learning mathematics of the students taught using multimedia and those taught without using multimedia; 3) teaching with multimedia is more effective than that without multimedia in terms of students‟ mathematics learning <b>achievement</b> <b>and</b> interest.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has found a relation between substance use <b>and</b> academic <b>achievement</b> <b>and</b> motivation, although {{the direction of the}} causal relation is unclear. Whereas numerous researchers have found that substance use is predictive of graduation from high 3 chool, others have found that poor academic <b>achievement</b> <b>and</b> low academic aspirations have a significant influence on substance use onset. In this study data from a 3 -year longitudinal study of adolescent substance use were used to clarify the direction of influence between the adolescent's academic <b>achievement</b> <b>and</b> motivation and substance use. Adolescents (N= 464), ages 12 - 16, from grades 6 through 11, and their parent(s) completed parallel questionnaires measuring marijuana, cigarette, <b>and</b> alcohol use; <b>achievement</b> motivation; <b>and</b> academic <b>achievement.</b> The results suggest that the relation between substance use <b>and</b> <b>achievement</b> <b>and</b> motivation is bidirectional. Adolescents with lower motivation tended to initiate the use of marijuana and initiation of cigarette use tended to decrease tha adolescent's <b>achievement</b> <b>and</b> motivation. For 12 -year-olds, only the path between substance use <b>and</b> academic <b>achievement</b> was significant.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to know the effect of the learning models on the learning <b>achievement</b> <b>and</b> mathematics communication ability viewed from the spatial quotient. The learning models compared were Inquiry learning, Discovery learning and Classical model. The type of this study was a quasi-experimental study with a 3 x 3 factorial design. The study population was all grade VIII students of Junior High School in Solo city. Sample was collected by stratified cluster random sampling and consisted of 260 students which where divided into three groups, 86 students in Experimental Group 1, 86 students in Experimental Group 2, and 88 students in Control Group. The instruments of the research include mathematics achievement test, mathematics communication ability test and spatial intelligence test. The technique of analyzing data used the two-way multivariate analysis of variance with unbalanced cell. The results of this research could be concluded as follows, (1) Inquiry Learning and Discovery Learning have better learning <b>achievement</b> <b>and</b> mathematics communication ability aspects than the Classical learning, Besides that, Inquiry Learning and Discovery Learning have the same learning <b>achievement</b> <b>and</b> mathematics communication ability; (2) The students with high spatial intelligence have the same learning <b>achievement</b> <b>and</b> mathematics communication ability as middle spatial intelligence. In addition, students who have high and middle spatial intelligence have better learning <b>achievement</b> <b>and</b> mathematics communication ability than students who have low spatial intelligence.; (3) In each learning model, the students with high and middle spatial intelligence have better learning <b>achievement</b> <b>and</b> mathematics communication ability than students who have low spatial intelligence, and the students with high and middle spatial intelligence have the same learning <b>achievement</b> <b>and</b> mathematics communication ability; (4) In each of the spatial intelligence, the cooperative learning model of Inquiry Learning and Discovery Learning give a better learning <b>achievement</b> <b>and</b> mathematics communication ability than the Classical model, and the cooperative learning model of Inquiry Learning and Discovery Learning give the same learning <b>achievement</b> <b>and</b> mathematics communication ability...|$|R
