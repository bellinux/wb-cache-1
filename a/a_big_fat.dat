500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive {{reviews and}} {{has been described as}} one of the classic South Park episodes. It was viewed in about 4.5 million households during its original broadcast, the highest Nielsen rating to that date for South Park and the fourth-highest overall for a basic cable entertainment program of 1997. In addition to Mr. Hankey himself, the episode introduced the popular South Park songs [...] "A Lonely Jew on Christmas" [...] and [...] "Kyle's Mom is <b>a</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Fat</b> Bitch". John Kricfalusi, the creator of The Ren & Stimpy Show, accused Parker and Stone of stealing the idea for Mr. Hankey from him, which the duo vehemently denied.|$|E
500|$|Outside the house, the {{president}} introduces Stan to his followers, {{to whom he}} will read parts of his new doctrine. However, instead of presenting it to them, Stan states {{that he is not}} the reincarnation of L. Ron Hubbard, and that [...] "Scientology is just <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>fat</b> global scam". The Scientologists grow angry and threaten to sue him. The celebrities in the closet appear, threatening to sue Stan as well. The last shot is Stan daring them to do so. However, that shot is followed immediately by the closing credits naming only [...] "John Smith" [...] and [...] "Jane Smith", a reference to Tom Cruise and the Church of Scientology's reputation for litigiousness.|$|E

500|$|The {{music in}} [...] "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo" [...] was also praised. [...] "A Lonely Jew on Christmas" [...] has been {{described}} as a [...] "classic song", and [...] "Kyle's Mom is <b>a</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Fat</b> Bitch", which reviewers described as one of Cartman's trademarks, was included in the 1999 South Park film, [...] Not all reviews of [...] "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo" [...] were positive. Rick Marin of Newsweek described the episode as [...] "simply one long potty joke". Virginia Rohan of The Record said he liked Kyle's song and some of Kenny's antics, but said the episode was not as funny as The Spirit of Christmas shorts. Rohan said South Park [...] "can be brilliantly over the edge, but often tonight, it sorely needs a comic bungee cord".|$|E
500|$|After much anticipation, Brian {{receives}} {{an invitation to}} an award ceremony celebrating his novel, Faster Than the Speed of Love, [...] by the Rhode Island Society for Special Literary Excellence. Convinced {{he is a great}} writer, Brian attempts to gain the family's interest but fails to do so. Once he arrives at the [...] "award ceremony" [...] however, he discovers that he has misunderstood {{the meaning of the word}} [...] "special", [...] prompting him to drown his sorrows at the local bar and realize that he's not a writer at all, but <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>fat</b> joke. He drives home drunk that night and accidentally runs over and kills a dog. He secretly buries the dead dog's body outside the Griffins' home and tries to keep quiet about it. Stewie, having witnessed his deed, begins to toy with Brian's guilt, eventually driving him to a state where he decides to confess to [...] "murder". However, when he confesses to Joe and the Griffin family, they all laugh, saying that no one cares if a dog or any other animal is killed, especially by another animal.|$|E
500|$|Jon Pareles of Rolling Stone said, [...] " [...] {{voice is}} so processed, its physicality almost disappears. [...] In the Zone offers strip-club, 1-900 sex, {{accommodating}} and hollow. Beyond the glittering beats, Spears sounds about as intimate as a blowup doll." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine stated, [...] "Britney's fourth album, In The Zone, finds the pop tart {{coming of age}} with a bold mix of hip-hop and dance music, wiping clean the last traces of her bubblegum-pop past. [...] For the most part, In The Zone is <b>a</b> <b>big,</b> <b>fat,</b> thumping love letter to the dancefloor, which makes Madonna's involvement [...] even more appropriate." [...] Dorian Lynskey of The Guardian commented, [...] "Unlike previous Britney albums, In the Zone has no filler and no shoddy cover versions, just 57 varieties of blue-chip hit-factory pop. There is southern hip-hop, deep house, Neptunes-style R, the ubiquitous Diwali beat and, most importantly, oodles of Madonna." [...] Jason King of Vibe deemed it as [...] "A supremely confident dance record that also illustrates Spears's development as a songwriter." [...] "Toxic" [...] won Spears her first and so far only Grammy Award, for Best Dance Recording at the 47th Annual Grammy Awards (2005).|$|E

500|$|Secretariat raced in Meadow Stables' blue-and-white-checkered colors. He never raced {{in track}} bandages, but {{typically}} wore a blinker hood, mostly {{to help him}} focus, but also {{because he had a}} tendency to run in towards the rail during races. In January 1972, he joined trainer Lucien Laurin's winter stable at Hialeah. Secretariat gained a reputation as a kind horse, likeable and unruffled in crowds or by the bumping that occurs between young horses. He had the physique of a runner, but at first was awkward and clumsy. He was frequently outpaced by more precocious stable mates, running a quarter-mile in 26 seconds compared to 23 seconds by his peers. His regular exercise riders were Jim Gaffney and Charlie Davis. Davis was not initially impressed. [...] "He was <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>fat</b> sucker", Davis said. [...] "I mean, he was big. He wasn't in a hurry to do nothin'. He took his time. The quality was there, but he didn't show it until he wanted to." [...] Gaffney though recalled his first ride on Secretariat in early 1972 as [...] "having this big red machine under me, and from that very first day I knew he had a power of strength that I have never felt before..." ...|$|E
500|$|Andrea Magrath of Daily Mail {{compared}} Beyoncé with Maria von Trapp in the video. Erika Ramirez of Billboard magazine {{praised the}} video, [...] "What {{better way to}} show your ex they're {{the best thing you}} never had than with saying 'I Do' to someone bigger and better in a Baracci Beverly Hills wedding gown." [...] Jason Lipshutz of the same publication described it as a [...] "smile-inducing clip with a dream wedding". A writer of Rap-Up praised the video's [...] "fairytale" [...] ending. Gordon Smart of The Sun described the white corset that Beyoncé wore in the video as sexy and wrote that [...] "her ex will be feeling a bit of a mug watching it when he remembers what he's missing out on." [...] Ashleigh Rainbird of the Daily Mirror found Beyoncé, [...] "looking sexy in white lacy undies and garter – and later in <b>a</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Fat</b> Gypsy Wedding-style frock". Amos Barshad of New York magazine commented, [...] "To just full-on hammer down the whole 'mature and settled down and happy' thing, Mrs. Hova saunters around with the most irrepressible smile you've ever seen, shimmying amazingly (note the moves at 3:30) as home footage of that jerk she threw away like a parking ticket cuts in and out." [...] The music video peaked at number one on the UK TV Airplay Chart, logging 634 plays on July 24, 2011.|$|E
500|$|Mayor McDaniels {{decides that}} {{anything}} offensive to anyone {{will be removed}} from the Christmas celebrations, including Santa Claus, Christmas trees, wreaths, fairy lights, candy canes, mistletoe and the Star of Bethlehem. Kyle once again tries to suggest that they use Mr. Hankey as a non-religious Christmas icon since he does not discriminate against anyone. At home, Kyle is scolded by his parents for believing in Mr. Hankey. While Kyle is brushing his teeth, Mr. Hankey comes out of the toilet, spreading feces stains everywhere he goes, prompting Kyle's parents to blame Kyle for the mess. Kyle decides he will bring Mr. Hankey to school to prove he is real, but this only causes more problems as Mr. Hankey disguises himself as an unadorned, dried-out piece of feces when he is around people who do not believe in him, leading Cartman to ask if carrying around boxes with feces in them is some kind of Jewish tradition. Mr. Hankey leaps at Cartman's face as he sings [...] "Kyle's Mom is <b>a</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Fat</b> Bitch" [...] in D Minor, and Kyle is blamed. He is sent to talk to guidance counselor, Mr. Mackey, but Kyle only gets into further trouble when Mr. Hankey takes a bath in Mr. Mackey's coffee. Cartman, Stan and Kenny believe Kyle is insane and check him into a mental institution.|$|E

500|$|Of {{the seven}} major New York {{newspaper}} drama reviewers, five gave the show very positive reviews. [...] For example, New York Journal American critic John McClain stated, [...] "Flower Drum Song is <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>fat</b> Rodgers and Hammerstein hit, and nothing written here {{will have the}} slightest effect on the proceeds." [...] The New York Daily Mirror termed it, [...] "Another notable work by the outstanding craftsmen of our musical theatre... a lovely show, an outstanding one in theme and treatment." [...] Less enthusiastic, however, was the longtime New York Times critic, Brooks Atkinson, who repeatedly described it as merely [...] "pleasant". [...] UPI's drama critic, Jack Gaver, scored it as [...] "well north of Me and Juliet and Pipe Dream" [...] but [...] "well south" [...] of Oklahoma!, Carousel, South Pacific and even the team's first flop, Allegro. [...] Ward Morehouse applauded Suzuki for having [...] "a brassy voice and the assurance of a younger Ethel Merman" [...] and termed the production [...] "an excellent Broadway show" [...] though [...] "erhaps it doesn't belong in the same world... as The King and I and Carousel." [...] Critic Kenneth Tynan, in The New Yorker magazine, alluded to the show The World of Suzie Wong in dismissing Flower Drum Song with the spoonerism, [...] "a world of woozy song".|$|E
500|$|... "Existence" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "B". While offering a positive opinion {{in regards to}} the finale as a whole, he felt that [...] "Existence" [...] dragged more so than [...] "Essence", resulting in a less interesting episode. He also felt that the overarching mythology of the series had long ago become too convoluted to make sense, but that the [...] "human pieces of the show still work, and that includes Doggett." [...] Contra Costa Times columnists George Avalos and Michael Liedtke were pleased with the episode noting that the last scene was [...] "beautifully written". Avalos and Liedtke also reacted positively to the death of Alex Krycek at the hands of Skinner, saying it was the best scene in the episode. Despite their praise, however, they stressed that [...] "Existence" [...] was not as exciting as the previous episode, [...] "Essence," [...] or the 1998 The X-Files feature film. Jessica Morgan of Television Without Pity gave the episode an A- rating, noting that [...] "season eight's finale goes out with <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>fat</b> juicy kiss between Mulder and Scully, at long last". Gareth Wigmore of TV Zone was positive toward both [...] "Essence" [...] and [...] "Existence". Wigmore gave the episodes a 9 out of 10 rating and wrote [...] "the reason that this two-parter works is that its plot is simple enough for the audience to still have a handle on".|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{considered}} the first South Park musical episode, and included such songs as [...] "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo", [...] "A Lonely Jew on Christmas" [...] and [...] "Kyle's Mom is <b>a</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Fat</b> Bitch". Parker and Stone were initially concerned about making a musical because, Parker said, [...] "The general rule was people hated musicals". For the Mr. Hankey character, Parker and Stone adapted most of the elements from the Mr. Hankey short film they planned in college, except that Mr. Hankey {{would prove to be}} real, not a figment of Kyle's imagination. Parker said this was decided because of his frustration with the character Mr. Snuffleupagus in the children's show Sesame Street; for his first 14 years on the show, Mr. Snuffleupagus was an imaginary character seen only by Big Bird, which Parker said [...] "really bummed me out". Parker and Stone felt Mr. Hankey should embody the wholesomeness and morals of cartoons from the 1930s, so they designed him to resemble the version of Mickey Mouse in the 1928 cartoon Steamboat Willie, particularly in his eyes. For the scenes in which Mr. Hankey smears feces wherever he walks, the animators scanned images of spread out chocolate and fudge and inserted those images into the episode. Parker and Stone had trouble deciding on a voice for Mr. Hankey, but Stone said it came to him while eating a Sausage McMuffin at a McDonald's in New York City, while taking a break from promoting South Park to the press.|$|E

2500|$|Hunters & Collectors {{supported}} Midnight Oil's North American tour of 1990 and, {{although the}} band {{struggled to find}} further chart success in the US, they maintained their status in Australia and New Zealand as local favourites. During that year Rolling Stone (Australia) named them Australian Band of the Year. Contemporary singer-songwriter, Paul Kelly, recalled that by the late 1980s the band [...] "were peaking in the pubs, gathering an army ... had <b>a</b> <b>big,</b> <b>fat</b> industrial bass sound, an anthemic horn section, and their singlet-clad singer , as fit as a trout, held nothing back".|$|E
2500|$|Given the Democratic {{resistance}} {{coupled with}} Holsinger's lack {{of response to}} the committee's questions after more than ten months, in June 2008, thirteen months after his nomination, Kentucky Senator Jim Bunning, a Holsinger supporter, suggested the nomination was dead which the White House and fellow Kentucky Senator and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell denied. The political scientist Norman Ornstein said, [...] "It's extremely unusual for somebody not to answer questions. It's <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>fat</b> 'dis' of the committee and of the Senate. Even if you know or believe you {{are not likely to}} be confirmed, the idea that you wouldn't sort of do what the committee has asked is still kind of mind-boggling." [...] The committee's Republican ranking member said Holsinger's lack of response was [...] "not helpful" [...] while the editorial board of Kentucky's Courier-Journal characterized it as [...] "disrespectful" [...] and [...] "baffling".|$|E
2500|$|Six days later, Big Show {{returned}} on at Over the Limit, seemingly to help John Cena in his {{match against}} John Laurinaitis; instead, he knocked Cena {{out with a}} WMD and allowed Laurinaitis to win the match by pinfall, and turning heel in the process {{for the first time}} since April 2010. The following night on Raw, Big Show explained that his actions were of necessity to keep his job in the WWE, therefore resulting in Laurinaitis re-signing him to an [...] "ironclad contract with <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>fat</b> bonus", also stating that nobody showed him any sympathy when he got fired. Over the next few weeks, he attacked Cena, Brodus Clay, Alex Riley, R-Truth, Santino Marella, Zack Ryder, and Kofi Kingston because of the terms of his contract. On the June 11 episode of Raw, he accidentally knocked out Vince McMahon after McMahon decided that Laurinatis would be fired if Show lost to Cena at No Way Out in a steel cage. Show went on to lose that match and as per stipulation, Laurinaitis was fired. At Money in the Bank, Show faced Cena, Kane, Chris Jericho, and The Miz in the WWE Championship Money in the Bank ladder match, but was unsuccessful as the match was won by Cena. On July 23 at Raw 1000, Big Show attacked Cena during his WWE Championship match against CM Punk causing a disqualification. He continued the attack on Cena until The Rock made the save. The following week on Raw, a WWE Championship number one contenders match between Show and Cena ended in a no contest due to interference from Punk. Following this, both Show and Cena were entered in the championship match at SummerSlam by Raw General Manager AJ Lee At the event, however, Show was unsuccessful as Punk retained the title.|$|E

I'd back Robinson against any of the pitchers today, big ball and all." ...|$|R
5000|$|The band {{started work}} on a new album in early 2012. According to Benzie, the album may take a more {{electronic}} approach than This Is the Warning;, stating [...] "I think we're kind of in a cyborg half-human, half-robot stage at the moment. Yeah, I definitely think we could (be going in an electronic direction). We're leaning toward <b>a</b> <b>bigger,</b> <b>fatter</b> sound, rather than just the guitars." [...] Benzie also stated that thematically, the album would explore {{the issues of the}} first album, but build on those {{as if it were a}} second chapter in a first person narrative; [...] "Most of the next one’s going to be a bit of the after-effect: how can you combat things like that (not feeling in control of your own life)? How can small people deceive world bankers? The answer will actually be everyone — what everyone does within their individual bubble, how we choose to act, and if that will butterfly effect out." [...] Benzie also said the band aims to have a worldwide release by the end of 2012.|$|R
2500|$|Jaci Stephen {{from the}} Daily Mail praised the casting of Essex in the role, saying, [...] "There {{is always a}} frisson of {{excitement}} when a big star joins a soap. [...] None, however, has excited {{me as much as}} the arrival of David Essex in EastEnders. It is inspired casting, not only because the part of Eddie Moon fits Essex like a glove, but because he brings a gravitas to the show. And those eyes. Goodness, those beautiful eyes." [...] Stephen went on to positively review Eddie's arrival, saying, [...] "It made for a great start to the week, with David Essex's exquisite comic timing bringing some light-hearted relief to the rather heavy Moon/Mitchell stuff of late." [...] Tony Stewart from the Daily Mirror also positively reviewed Eddie's arrival in Albert Square, saying, [...] "Dressed in a smart, black three-piece whistle and flute [...] and a white button-down collar shirt, the dapper grey-haired man looks like he could have been a guest at <b>a</b> <b>Big,</b> <b>Fat</b> Gypsy Wedding. But within four minutes of arriving in Albert Square on Monday, he's been knocked over by Carol's car as he snatches Roxy's toddler Amy from its path. Although there have been reports that this newcomer has been banned from singing in the Vic, within 15 minutes he's croaking out a line from the Leyton Orient supporters' song. This is the grand entrance of former 70s teen idol David Essex" [...] Conversely, Jim Shelley, also from the Daily Mirror, criticised Eddie's arrival, saying, [...] "on Monday they blessed us with the arrival of Whispering David Essex as Eddie Moon, the latest example of the Long-Lost Relative Who Has Never Been Mentioned Before that is routine in soaps nowadays. [...] Eddie had been in EastEnders three whole minutes before the writers unleashed the bi-annual cliche of The Mean & Moody New Guy Saving A Child Running Out In Front Of A Car. [...] Eddie spent the week ticking off the components of that great EastEnders cliche, the 'rough diamond'/silver-tongued 'ladies' man.' (See also Dennis Watts, Michael Moon, Johnny Allen, Max & Jack Branning, Steve Owen et al.)" [...] A reporter from the Metro called the character [...] "mischievous", and another from the Evening Chronicle called him [...] "a pleasant, charming character", adding [...] "It seems as if a little bit of Essex will brighten up the East End for a while. [...] s far as I can tell, [...] will be {{a breath of fresh air}} in a soap that sometimes forgets to have a laugh." ...|$|E

Since Wilson is a Greek-American and her husband, Tom Hanks, is not (he is of English, German, and Portuguese ancestry), Wilson was convinced that she could relate to the situation in which the film's main character, Toula, found herself.
