5|$|There is also {{a fallen}} {{standing}} stone known as the Broad Stone which measures 2 metres (6.6 feet) in length and which lies beside the road about 1.5kilometres (0.9 miles) {{to the west of}} the Nine Stones. As it was recorded in the 19th century it measured 3 metres (10 feet) in length, 2 metres (6 <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>feet)</b> in breadth, and 0.6 metres (2 feet) in thickness. The monument was protected from passing cars by several bollards which were later removed by the highways authority, prompting statements of concern that the stone was unprotected in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Built to Brigham Young's design, the handcarts {{resembled a}} large wheelbarrow, with two wheels five feet (1.5m) in {{diameter}} and a single axle four <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>feet</b> (1.4m) wide, and weighing 60 pounds (27kg). Running along {{each side of the}} bed were seven-foot (2.1 m) pull shafts ending with a three-foot (0.9m) crossbar at the front. The crossbar allowed the carts to be pushed or pulled. Cargo was carried in a box about three feet by four feet (0.9m by 1.2m), with 8inch (0.2m) walls. The handcarts generally carried up to 250 pounds (110kg) of supplies and luggage, though they were capable of handling loads as heavy as 500 pounds (230kg). Carts used in the first year's migration were made entirely of wood ("Iowa hickory or oak"); in later years a stronger design was substituted, which included metal elements.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the {{embankment}} began on September 16, 1968 using the hydraulic fill method. The dam's massive concrete emergency spillway was completed on January 19, 1969. However, severe flooding on January 26 destroyed the cofferdam {{and all of}} the construction site's bridges, putting work a month behind schedule. Cleanup proceeded at a rapid pace and placing of impervious material for the dam's core commenced on February 27. For the next fifteen months, a fleet of massive 125-ton (113 t) dump trucks delivered an almost constant stream of dirt and rock to the site, and the dam wall rose at an average rate of one <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>feet</b> (0.5 m) per day. The workforce peaked at 500 men in mid-1969 and on December 10, the service spillway was completed. On May 28, 1970, {{the embankment}} was finally topped out with the last of over 250,000 truckloads of material.|$|E

25|$|Designer Alfred Shaw {{integrated}} {{art deco}} stylings with influences from three building types—the warehouse, {{the department store}} and the skyscraper. A warehouse block stands as the 18-story bulk of the building. Ribbon piers define the windows, and the building's chamfered corners, minimal setbacks, and corner pavilions disguise {{the edges of the}} mass and visually reduce bulk. The south corner pavilions are of greater height than the north corner pavilions. The building is open at the pedestrian level with bronzed framed display windows, typical of a department store, on the south, west and east boundaries. The 25-story central tower ascends with a peak {{in the form of a}} skyscraper, and rests in the southern half of the building. Deeply recessed portals occur between raised panels, and are adorned with medallions featuring the interlocked initials of the Merchandise Mart. The same logo occurs throughout the building. Fifty six American Indian chiefs circled the tower's crown, a reference to the site's history and Chicago's early trade activities. Three <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>feet</b> wide by seven feet tall, the terra cotta figures were barely visible from the street, meant to be viewed from the upper floors of the skyscrapers planned to rise along the riverbank.|$|E
25|$|The keels were wooden boats with {{a pointed}} stern, {{so that the}} bow and stern looked almost the same. They were of shallow draught so that when fully loaded they drew only four <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>feet.</b> The keels were forty feet long and at least 19 feet wide amidships: a very broad configuration. In 1266 the {{standard}} load of a keel was set at 20 chaldrons (wagonloads) or approximately 17 tons. After 1497 the keel load was frequently increased, until in 1635 it was set at 21.1 tons. A chaldron was a horse-drawn wagon containing 17 cwt of coal. Keels {{were supposed to be}} measured by the Kings Commissioners and given a load mark to show when they were full. The keels had a single mast with a square sail attached to a yardarm and two large oars. They had no rudder and so a large sweep was used for steering when the keel was under sail. The oars were used to row when the wind was not favourable. There were also two iron-shod poles for polling the keel through any shallows. The floor of the hold was only two feet below the gunwale to allow for easy loading. The coal was piled high above the top of the hold with wooden boards used to prevent the cargo from sliding. Each keel was manned by a skipper, two crewmen and a boy, known as a ‘pee dee’. The meaning of this title is unknown.|$|E

500|$|The bishop {{tried to}} persuade him to become a monk, but Dunstan was {{doubtful}} whether he had a vocation to a celibate life. The answer {{came in the form of}} an attack of swelling tumours all over Dunstan's body. This ailment was so severe that it was thought to be leprosy. It was more probably some form of blood poisoning caused by being beaten and thrown in the cesspool. Whatever the cause, it changed Dunstan's mind. He took Holy Orders in 943, in the presence of Ælfheah, and returned to live the life of a hermit at Glastonbury. Against the old church of St Mary he built a small cell five feet long and two <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>feet</b> deep. [...] It was there that Dunstan studied, worked at his handicrafts, and played on his harp.

500|$|Cibber replied {{mostly with}} good humour to Pope's aspersions ("some {{of which are}} in conspicuously bad taste", as Lowe points out), until 1742 when he responded in kind in [...] "A Letter from Mr. Cibber, to Mr. Pope, inquiring into the motives that might induce him in his Satyrical Works, to be so {{frequently}} fond of Mr. Cibber's name". In this pamphlet, Cibber's most effective ammunition came from a reference in Pope's Epistle to Arbuthnot (1735) to Cibber's [...] "whore", which gave Cibber a pretext for retorting in kind with a scandalous anecdote about Pope in a brothel. [...] "I must own", wrote Cibber, [...] "that I believe I know more of your whoring than you do of mine; because I don't recollect that ever I made you the least Confidence of my Amours, though I have been very near an Eye-Witness of Yours." [...] Since Pope was around four <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>feet</b> tall and hunchbacked due to a tubercular infection of the spine he contracted when young, Cibber regarded the prospect of Pope with a woman as something humorous, and he speaks mockingly of the [...] "little-tiny manhood" [...] of Pope. For once the laughers were on Cibber's side, and the story [...] "raised a universal shout of merriment at Pope's expense". Pope made no direct reply, but took {{one of the most famous}} revenges in literary history. In the revised Dunciad that appeared in 1743, he changed his hero, the King of Dunces, from Lewis Theobald to Colley Cibber.|$|E

Petropavlovsk had ordinary nickel steel, while Sevastopol used Harvey armor and Poltava used the latest Krupp armor.
