5|$|Feminist {{campaigns are}} {{generally}} considered to be a main force behind major historical societal changes for women's rights, particularly in the West, where they are near-universally credited with achieving women's suffrage, gender neutrality in English, reproductive rights for women (including access to contraceptives and abortion), and the right to enter into contracts and own property. Although feminist advocacy is, and has been, mainly focused on women's rights, some feminists, including bell hooks, <b>argue</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> inclusion of men's liberation within its aims because men are also harmed by traditional gender roles.|$|E
5|$|Heavy cavalry was {{believed}} to have been developed by the Ancient Persians, although others <b>argue</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Sarmatians. By the time of Darius (558486 BC), Persian military tactics required horses and riders that were completely armoured, and selectively bred a heavier, more muscled horse to carry the additional weight. The cataphract was a type of heavily armoured cavalry with distinct tactics, armour, and weaponry used {{from the time of the}} Persians up until the Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|The International Size Acceptance Association (ISAA) is a {{non-governmental}} organization (NGO) {{which was founded}} in 1997. It has more of a global orientation and describes its mission as promoting size acceptance and helping to end weight-based discrimination. These groups often <b>argue</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> recognition of obesity as a disability under the US Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA). The American legal system, however, has decided that the potential public health costs exceed the benefits of extending this anti-discrimination law to cover obesity.|$|E

5|$|But {{apart from}} the {{clerical}} business, Las Casas had also traveled to Spain for his own purpose: to continue the struggle against the colonists' mistreatment of the Indians. The encomienda had, in fact, legally been abolished in 1523, {{but it had been}} reinstituted in 1526, and in 1530 a general ordinance against slavery was reversed by the Crown. For this reason it was a pressing matter for Bartolom√© de las Casas to plead once again for the Indians with Charles V who was by now Holy Roman Emperor and no longer a boy. He wrote a letter asking for permission to stay in Spain a little longer in order to <b>argue</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Emperor that conversion and colonization were best achieved by peaceful means.|$|E
5|$|Public {{dissatisfaction with}} the newly-issued Morgan dollar led the Mint's {{engravers}} to submit designs for the smaller silver coins in 1879. Among those who called for new coinage was editor Richard Watson Gilder of The Century Illustrated Monthly Magazine. Sometime in the early 1880s, he, along {{with one of his}} reporters and sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens visited Mint Director Burchard to <b>argue</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> creation of new designs. They brought along classic Greek and Roman coins in an attempt to persuade Burchard that the coinage could easily be made more beautiful. The visitors left disappointed, after learning that Burchard considered the much-criticized Morgan dollar as beautiful as any of them.|$|E
5|$|There is some dispute as to if this pyramid was Ahmose's burial place, {{or if it}} was a cenotaph. Although earlier explorers Mace and Currelly {{were unable}} to locate any {{internal}} chambers, it is unlikely that a burial chamber would have been located {{in the midst of the}} pyramid's rubble core. In the absence of any mention of a tomb of King Ahmose in the tomb robbery accounts of the Abbott Papyrus, and in the absence of any likely candidate for the king's tomb at Thebes, it is possible that the king was interred at Abydos, as suggested by Harvey. Certainly the great number of cult structures located at the base of the pyramid located in recent years, as well as the presence at the base of the pyramid of a cemetery used by priests of Ahmose's cult, <b>argue</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> importance of the king's Abydos cult. However, other Egyptologists believe that the pyramid was constructed (like Tetisheri's pyramid at Abydos) as a cenotaph and that Ahmose may have originally been buried in the southern part of Dra' Abu el-Naga' with the rest of the late 17th and early 18th Dynasties.|$|E

25|$|Some studies <b>argue</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{importance}} of mentoring {{in the process}} of learning (Archee and Duin 1995; Brown et al. 1989).

25|$|The early feminist {{movement}} began to <b>argue</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> improvement of women's {{education in the}} 1860s: Emily Davies and Barbara Bodichon met through their activism at the Society for the Employment of Women and the Englishwoman's Review. They shared the aim of securing women's admission to university.|$|E

25|$|Dreyfus's seminal {{critique}} of cognitivism (or the computational {{account of the}} mind), What Computers Can't Do, consciously replays Merleau-Ponty's {{critique of}} intellectualist psychology to <b>argue</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> irreducibility of corporeal know-how to discrete, syntactic processes. Through the influence of Dreyfus's critique and neurophysiological alternative, Merleau-Ponty became associated with neurophysiological, connectionist accounts of cognition.|$|E
