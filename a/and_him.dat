Encouraged by his wife and Zimmermann, Cagney accepted an offer from the director Miloš Forman to star in a small but pivotal role in the film Ragtime (1981).|$|E
5|$|As Saeed was {{the vice}} {{president}} of the Iraq Football Association, which was headed by Uday Hussein, in the 1990s, there were many controversies about him being a Ba'athist and a Saddamist. He was also accused of being of a Palestinian descent, torturing players, giving positions to Tikritis. Accusations also went to say that Saeed was Uday's representative in robbing Kuwaitis in the 1991 Gulf War. Documents were put on the internet by some news agencies that suggest that Saeed, Najeh Humoud and Moayad Al-Badri worked for the Iraqi Intelligence Service in 2002 by gathering information on their targets. The documents included Saeed gathering information about Al-Badri when he was staying in Saudi Arabia before joining them himself. They also show the approval of the Personal Secretary of Former President Saddam Hussein, Abid Hamid Mahmud, of paying Saeed $50,000 after completing his mission <b>and</b> <b>him</b> signing on receiving $25,000. One of the documents showed him and Al-Badri executing a mission to monitor an alleged Israeli spy in Syria and showed him arresting Yahya Alwan before travelling to Saudi Arabia.|$|E

They then find that Helen's friend, Jason's girlfriend, Rena Talbot (Wrenn Schmidt) looked after Noah whilst Helen was on taking care of her boyfriend Oscar Mendez who had been injured badly in a fight. They find Rena, and result in finding Noah, who is sick but alive, and is reunited with his parents.

5|$|During his tenure, Ferguson was {{credited}} with the distinction of making {{some of the most}} shrewd purchases in the club's history, including the signings of Peter Schmeichel and Eric Cantona, each for less than £1.5million. With these signings, combined with the club's many experienced players, Ferguson brought the league title back to Old Trafford {{for the first time in}} 26 years. In the following decade, he won the Premier League title another six times, including a hat-trick of titles from 1999 to 2001, a feat that no other manager has yet achieved with the same club. In 1999, he also led the club to an unprecedented Treble of Premier League, FA Cup and UEFA Champions League. Subsequently, he added another three league titles to his trophy haul, despite a number of promises of retirement. Ferguson won his 10th Premier League title in the 2007–08 season, and followed this up with his second Champions League title 10 days later. In 2008–09, Ferguson guided United to another Premier League title, making Manchester United the only club <b>and</b> <b>him</b> the only manager to have won the English league title three times in a row twice. His 12th title, in the 2010–11 season, was United's 19th overall, overtaking Liverpool's record of 18. Ferguson won his 13th and final league title in the 2012–13 season, making 20 titles overall for United. At the end of the season, Ferguson announced his retirement, and he was replaced by Everton manager David Moyes.|$|E

5|$|On 9 September 1933 Cochet turned professional, {{signing a}} {{contract}} with the Tilden Tennis Tour for a guaranteed annual payment of £25.000 and joined the team of Bill Tilden and Martin Plaa. Although he was still featured on the amateur world rankings published on the 20th of the month, where he was listed one spot behind Ellsworth Vines at number six, Cochet was also on Pierre Gillou's list in fourth place, also right after Vines. Cochet made his professional debut in a Franco-American match on 22 September and defeated Bruce Barnes. Three days later he lost to Tilden in straight sets. He also made appearances at the French Riviera with Plaa with back and forth matches across France. On 10 October Tilden signed Vines to the pro tour and from then Cochet's archrival <b>and</b> <b>him</b> competed within the same league again.|$|E
5|$|On {{arriving}} in Oxford, Vermigli began lecturing on 1 Corinthians, denouncing Catholic doctrines of purgatory, clerical celibacy, and lenten fasting. He then spoke against the Catholic {{doctrine of the}} Eucharist, the most sensitive area of disagreement between Protestants and Catholics in England at the time. Conservative faculty, led by Smyth, challenged Vermigli to defend his views in a formal disputation. Smyth fled to St Andrews and finally to Leuven before the disputation could be held, so three Catholic divines, William Tresham, William Chedsey and Morgan Phillips, stepped forward to take his place. The disputation was held in 1549 before Richard Cox, the University Chancellor and a firm Protestant. It focused on the doctrine of transubstantiation, with Vermigli's opponents arguing for it <b>and</b> <b>him</b> against. Chancellor Cox made it obvious that he considered Vermigli to have the better argument, but did not formally declare a winner. The disputation put Vermigli {{at the forefront of}} debates over the nature of the Eucharist.|$|E

5|$|Rolle {{played well}} in the 2010 Orlando Summer League, garnering averages of 28 minutes, 13.4 points, seven rebounds, and two blocked shots per game.

In the second game, an 80–69 loss to the New Jersey Nets, Rolle scored nine points, brought down three rebounds, and {{rejected}} three shots. Against the Utah Jazz, Rolle's 10 points, eight rebounds, and four blocks facilitated an 83–74 Pacers win. The fourth game, which The Bahamas Tribune said was the most thrilling of the summer league, featured a 27-point deficit erased by Indiana for a comeback win over the Boston Celtics. Rolle had a double-double, with 19 points and 11 boards. The Pacers <b>and</b> <b>him</b> wrapped up the Orlando Summer League with a 77–73 defeat by the Oklahoma City Thunder, in which Rolle posted 16 points, eight rebounds and two blocks.|$|E
5|$|Three years later, Jordan Chandler's alleged {{account of}} the {{relationship}} was detailed in a book by journalist Victor M. Gutierrez. The book {{was said to be}} based on a diary the boy had kept at the time and included details of alleged sexual encounters between Jackson <b>and</b> <b>him.</b> In 1995, Jackson filed a civil suit against Gutierrez for slander; the jury found in Jackson's favor, awarding him $2.7 million in damages. However, that suit was unrelated to the book and the judgement does not serve to refute the allegations contained within. In 1996, Evan Chandler sued Jackson for around $60 million, claiming Jackson had breached an agreement never to discuss the case. In 1999, a court ruled in Jackson's favor and threw out the lawsuit.|$|E
5|$|When {{drawing the}} manga, Tsukudani aimed to write scenes that {{were easy to}} read, {{something}} {{she felt she was}} unable to do well when the manga's serialization began. What she felt was most important was depicting the characters as cute as possible. When developing the characters, she based the female members of the student council and Tadokoro on friends she had in the drama club when she was a student. However, Hime was created from scratch using Tsukudani's ideals for a cross-dressing boy as a basis for the character including his pink hair, side pigtails, <b>and</b> <b>him</b> being forced to cross-dress. When developing the members of the public morals committee, Tsukudani had already decided on having a pair of cross-dressing brothers, which led to Kaguya's development. Tsukudani's editor suggested making Kaguya the protagonist of the spin-off manga Himegoto+, and she wanted to give Kaguya a partner, so she created No. 1 and thought she might as well make her into a cross-dressing girl. For Mitsunaga and Hiro, she wanted them to cross-dress due to some preconceived issue. Tsukudani was careful to design the characters to maintain a balance between them, including what hair color they would have.|$|E
