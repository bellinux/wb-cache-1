5000|$|Defense {{is often}} viewed as an archetypical public goodi.e., a product {{that can only be}} {{provided}} by government because of its non-excludability and non-rivalrous consumption. Specifically, the free rider problem, in which people refuse to pay for defense but instead rely on their neighbors to pay for defending the community, is said to make it inevitable that it be financed by taxes if an equitable <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>costs</b> is to be achieved. According to anarcho-capitalist theorists, there are many ways by which this problem can be overcome or rendered irrelevant. Rothbard's solution was to simply say [...] "Who cares?" [...] {{when it comes to the}} issue of free riders. He points out that free riders are commonplace in other aspects of our economy, asking hypothetically, [...] "Are we to be critical because more than one person benefits from someone's actions?...In short, am I to be taxed for enjoying the view of my neighbor's well-kept garden?" [...] He notes that we are all free riders on the past, as we would be living in a primitive society if it were not for the efforts of our ancestors; and we are free riders on the present, because we benefit from the continuing investment of our fellow men and from their specialized skills on the market. Joseph R. Stromberg notes that the American Revolution occurred despite the fact that some individuals might have been free riders who benefited from it without funding it; he opines that successful defense of freedom often relies not on precise allocations of cost, but on [...] "nationalism, religion, the desire for freedom, hatred of the enemy, social pressure to do the right thing, and so on," [...] some of which might represent [...] "enlightened self interest." ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} method for {{three-phase}} state estimation (SE) in power distribution network including on-load tap changers (OLTC) for voltage control. The OLTC tap positions are essentially discrete variables from the SE point of view. Estimation of these variables in SE presents a formidable challenge. The proposed methodology combines discrete and continuous state variables (voltage magnitudes, angles, and tap positions). A hybrid particle swarm optimization (HPSO) is applied to obtain the solution. The method is tested on standard IEEE 13 - and 123 -bus unbalanced test system models. The proposed algorithm accurately estimates the network bus voltage magnitudes and angles, and discrete tap values.

40|$|Purpose – The {{literature}} on activity-based costing (ABC) {{that deals with}} the allocation of indirect purchasing costs primarily draws on a transactional approach to purchasing. This presents a problem, since {{a large share of}} purchasing takes place within relationships. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to point out complexities in applying ABC to indirect purchasing costs, when purchasing takes place within long-term relationships. The interaction model is used as a framework. Design/methodology/approach – A case study is conducted on a first-tier supplier in the Swedish automotive industry to illustrate real-life purchasing practices and to point out subsequent difficulties in applying ABC principles. This firm is selected because efforts have simultaneously been undertaken to employ supplier relationship management (SRM) and to implement costing techniques. About 23 interviews were conducted and approximately 31 hours of interview data were collected. Findings – The case shows that many functions tend to be involved in exchange within long-term relationships. This generates additional purchasing-related costs not previously recognized in the costing literature. It also leads to difficulties in allocating these costs. Originality/value – Complexities when implementing ABC are presented, concerning: <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>costs</b> relating to SRM; <b>allocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>costs</b> pertaining both to transactions and to relationships; less apparent cost drivers due to involvement of many functions in exchanges; and cost allocation over time.
