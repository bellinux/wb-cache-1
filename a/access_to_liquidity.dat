40|$|The {{financial}} crisis has heightened {{the awareness of}} the risk of a sudden shortage of foreign currencies. Governments and central banks {{are looking for ways to}} obtain "liquidity assurance", ie the assurance of having <b>access</b> <b>to</b> international <b>liquidity</b> if they need it. This article discusses how such assurance might be provided, whether by multilateral means, such as reserve pooling or structures such as the IMF; by bilateral means, such as swap arrangements; or unilaterally, by building up foreign exchange reserves. All of the possible solutions have advantages and disadvantages, and a diversity of approaches therefore seems likely.

40|$|Payment systems play a {{key role}} in the {{financial}} infrastructure of all modern economies. Participants of payment systems need <b>access</b> <b>to</b> intraday <b>liquidity</b> <b>to</b> fulfill their payment obligations.

In Mexico, this is among the first studies that analyze from this perspective the intraday liquidity management of the Real Time Settlement Payment System, SPEI. We examine a data set of transactions from April 7 to May 7, 2010 in order to get insights of the participants' behavior regarding the delay of sending payment orders...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the persistence and overlap {{of relationships between}} banks in a multiplex decomposition of the exposures network. Our analysis may be useful for researchers designing stress tests or models in which the behavior of banks is modeled explicitly. This has not been looked at previously, considering the time period involved and {{the different types of}} exposures and interactions used. We show that trading relationships overlap for some pairs of banks, and link persistence is higher in the secured than the unsecured market. Moreover, link persistence in the securities cross-holding network is much higher than in other funding networks, and overlap with the other segments of activity is low, despite being persistent over time. Additionally, unsecured loans received by large banks have the shortest waiting times (that is, for a given borrower and a given lender, the number of days elapsed before a new loan is observed) regardless of counterparty size, which suggests quicker <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>liquidity.</b> Large banks lend (unsecured) with shorter waiting times to medium-sized banks than to small banks; {{this is not the case}} when they lend in the secured layer of the network. Small banks have quicker <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>liquidity</b> in the secured lending layer when borrowing from medium-sized banks...|$|E

The Office of Finance (OF) serves as the fiscal agent for the FHLBanks, with responsibility for offering, issuing and servicing COs, as well as preparing the combined financial reports.

40|$|A retail {{franchisor}} needs growth capital so {{that the}} brand continues to grow and franchisor–franchisee relations remain strong. However, <b>access</b> <b>to</b> corporate <b>liquidity</b> <b>to</b> fund such franchise growth options is not unlimited. A method of raising finance particularly suited to retail franchisors is intellectual property (IP) securitization that allows companies to account for intangible assets such as intellectual property, royalty and brands and realize their full value. In recent years, a number of large restaurant franchisors have securitized their brands to raise funds, including Dunkin Brands and Domino's Pizza (Domino's). We use property rights approach to show that IP securitization provides mechanisms that explicitly define ownership of intangible assets within the securitization structure and thus enables a company to raise funds against these assets. Using a case study example of a retail franchise IP securitization transaction, we also provide evidence that these mechanisms are not overly restrictive {{and can be used}} more widely to help fund retail franchise growth and expansion. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A trade {{receivables}} securitization is {{away for a}} seller to raise capital by selling certain trade receivable assets into a special purpose vehicle (SPV), on a revolving basis. This permits the SPV to raise capital by issuing notes or taking out a loan, using the trade receivable assets as collateral. The proceeds from the loan or note then flow back to the seller as purchase proceeds for the trade receivable assets. Such a transaction can typically garner a rating higher than seller’s own corporate credit, thereby giving the seller <b>access</b> <b>to</b> greater <b>liquidity</b> {{at a lower cost}} of funds. Other advantages may include trade credit insurance and off-balance treatment. Structures, operations, and overhead can vary considerably, and there is room for optimization, customization, and fine-tuning; so, it is important for a seller to choose its securitization partners and arrangements carefully...|$|R

Liquidity outflows cause damage to financial structure by breaking up relationships, and damage persists due to frictions {{in the formation of}} new relationships. Feedbacks between aggregate investment and the structure of intermediation greatly magnify the effects of shocks. For large shocks, financial collapse may become inescapable in the absence of external intervention. ...|$|E

These results {{support the hypothesis that}} smaller firms tend to be disadvantaged relative to their larger counterparts in terms of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> finance.

40|$|Liquidity {{backstops}} {{have important}} implications for financial stability. In this paper, we provide a microfoundation for the important role of liquidity backstops in mitigating runs (or, conversely, the role of the lack of liquidity backstops in exacerbating runs) based on a dynamic model of debt runs. We focus on the municipal bond markets for variable rate demand obligations (VRDOs) and auction rate securities (ARS). The different experiences in these markets during the recent financial crisis of 2007 - 09 provide a natural experiment to identify the value of a liquidity backstop in mitigating runs. Through structural estimation of the model, we show that the value of a liquidity backstop is about 14. 5 basis points per annum.

Both measures effectively lubricate the financial system, in two key ways. First, they help provide <b>access</b> <b>to</b> funds for those entities with illiquid mortgage-backed securities. This helps these entities avoid selling the MBS at a steep loss. Second, the available funds stimulate the commercial paper market and general economic activity.
