He praised her for spreading {{the message of}} Raëlism internationally while publicizing the cloning. In the Raëlian hierarchy, she is one level below Raël {{and serves as a}} spokesperson for the movement. As a leader, she has attempted to rehabilitate the swastika, one of the group's symbols. She maintains that it is valuable as an ancient symbol of peace, and that it has been unfairly associated with Nazi Germany.|$|E
5|$|In the Cup Series, {{which was}} {{sponsored}} by Winston, Nextel, and Sprint during Gordon's career, Gordon, the 1993 Rookie of the Year and four-time series champion, won 93 races. Throughout his career, he won at 24 of the 25 tracks <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> competed, leaving Kentucky Speedway the only track where he failed to win. As {{of the end of}} the 2016 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series season, Gordon's 93 wins rank third all-time behind Richard Petty (200) and David Pearson (105).|$|E

5|$|Reconstruction of the {{historical}} development of Vithoba worship has been much debated. In particular, several alternative theories have been proposed regarding the earliest stages, as well as the point <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> came to be recognised as a distinct deity. The Pandurangashtakam stotra, a hymn attributed to Adi Shankaracharya of the 8th century, indicates that Vithoba worship might have already existed at an early date.|$|E

5|$|After {{the inaugural}} 1933 Philadelphia Eagles season, Bell married Upton at St. Madeleine Sophie Roman Catholic Church in Philadelphia. Days later, his {{suggestion}} to bestow {{the winner of}} the NFL championship game with the Ed Thorp Memorial Trophy was affirmed. In 1934, the Eagles finished with a 4–7 record, The Eagles' inability to seriously challenge other teams made it difficult to sell tickets, and his failure to sign a talented college prospect led him to adduce {{that the only way to}} bring stability to the league was to institute a draft to ensure the weakest teams had an advantage in signing the preeminent players. In 1935, his proposal for a draft was accepted, and in February 1936, the first draft kicked off, <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> acted as Master of Ceremonies. Later that month, his first child, Bert Jr., was born.|$|E

5|$|After three days, {{unable to}} persuade {{his men to}} back down, Alexander gave Persians command posts {{in the army and}} conferred Macedonian {{military}} titles upon Persian units. The Macedonians quickly begged forgiveness, which Alexander accepted, and held a great banquet for several thousand of his men <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> and they ate together. In an attempt to craft a lasting harmony between his Macedonian and Persian subjects, Alexander held a mass marriage of his senior officers to Persian and other noblewomen at Susa, but few of those marriages seem to have lasted much beyond a year. Meanwhile, upon his return to Persia, Alexander learned that guards of the tomb of Cyrus the Great in Pasargadae had desecrated it, and swiftly executed them. Alexander admired Cyrus the Great, from an early age reading Xenophon's Cyropaedia, which described Cyrus's heroism in battle and governance as a king and legislator. During his visit to Pasargadae Alexander ordered his architect Aristobulus to decorate the interior of the sepulchral chamber of Cyrus' tomb.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Szabó {{wanted to}} be a doctor like his father. By the age of 16, however, he had been {{inspired}} by a book by Hungarian film theorist Béla Balázs to become a film director. Upon graduation from high school, he became one of 11 applicants out of 800 who were admitted to the Academy of Theatrical and Cinematic Arts. At the Academy, he studied with the famous director Félix Máriássy, who became something of a father figure to Szabó. Among his classmates were Judit Elek, Zsolt Kézdi-Kovács, Janos Rozsa, Pál Gábor, Imre Gyöngyössy, Ferenc Kardos, and Zoltán Huszárik. While at the Academy, Szabó directed several short films, culminating in his thesis film, Koncert (1963), which won a prize at the International Short Film Festival Oberhausen. Thanks to János Herskó, head of the Hunnia Film Studio <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> apprenticed, Szabó was given his first opportunity to direct a feature film at the age of 25, rather than being required to spend ten years working as an assistant director.|$|E
5|$|As a lawyer, Sawyer {{focused on}} civil {{litigation}} in corporate law, <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> excelled. He also {{spent much of}} his time in the field of civil liberties, for which he became more well-known but less well-compensated. In 1953, he was one of several defense attorneys in the case of United States v. Kuzma, a prosecution of Communist sympathizers under the Smith Act, which barred anyone from advocating for the overthrow of the American government. The defendants were found guilty, but their convictions were reversed in 1957 after the United States Supreme Court overturned the Smith Act in Yates v. United States.|$|E

5|$|As a player, Adams {{created the}} concept of the shortstop position, {{according}} to Thorn and Baseball Hall of Fame researcher Freddy Berowski. In the first five years the Knickerbockers played, the team fielded anywhere from eight to eleven players. The only infielders were the players covering each of the bases; if there were more than eight players, extra outfielders were sometimes used. The outfielders had difficulty throwing baseballs into the infield, because of the balls' light weight. Adams' shortstop position, <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> started playing in about 1849 or 1850, was used to field throws from the outfielders and throw to the three infielders. With the advent of higher-quality baseballs, Adams moved toward the infield, since the distance the balls could travel increased. Prior to the invention of the shortstop, large gaps existed in the defensive positioning of infields; defensive players tended to stand by bases, leaving empty space in between them for batters. The shortstop filled one of the two gaps.|$|E
5|$|Chambers {{was born}} in Islington and raised in Finsbury Park, London. Running {{was a part of}} his family life: his older sister Christine won the senior 100metres Finals at the English Schools Championships in 1986 and 1987 and competed in the European Athletics Junior Championships. As a schoolboy he was coached by Selwyn Philbert who devoted himself to the young sprinter. Chambers first {{athletic}} success came at the 1994 English Schools' Athletic Association Championships, where he won the boys' intermediate 100m race with a time of 10.64seconds. International medals followed at the 1995 European Junior Championships, <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> won the 100m and the 4×100 metres relay. He defended these titles at the 1997 European Junior Championships and set a then world junior record in the 100m with a time of 10.06s.|$|E
5|$|Cognizant of his {{increasing}} {{age and the}} wear catching places on one's body, the Phillies reduced Ruiz's workload during spring training, hoping to keep him fresh throughout the regular season. Regardless, he insisted upon catching pitchers' bullpen sessions so he could develop a feel and rapport with each pitcher. On July 25, Ruiz became the first catcher in the National League, and the second catcher in Major League Baseball history, to catch four no-hitters when teammate Cole Hamels no-hit the Chicago Cubs. Overall, Ruiz lost his starting job to Cameron Rupp, and had significant declines in many aspects of his game, particularly those <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> previously excelled, including framing pitches – in 2015, Baseball Prospectus ranked him worst in the league at doing so – and the mental aspect of the game, as he made several uncharacteristic errors.|$|E

5|$|Dannatt and {{his sister}} were sent to {{separate}} boarding schools. He attended Felsted Junior School, where he gained an ambition to become a professional cricketer. For his secondary education, {{he was sent to}} St. Lawrence College in Ramsgate, Kent, where he joined the Combined Cadet Force (CCF) and eventually rose to senior under-officer. While at school, he developed a dislike of his first name, Francis, after it was mistaken for a girl's and he was invited to a birthday party <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> was the only boy. He eventually switched to his middle name, Richard, when he was fifteen. By then aspiring to become a barrister, Dannatt applied to study law at Emmanuel College, Cambridge but was turned down after an interview, at which point his ambition switched towards a military career.|$|E
5|$|Despite his socialist and pro-Soviet beliefs, Crawford {{believed}} in collaborating with all foreign archaeologists, regardless of political or ideological differences. In early 1938, he lectured on aerial archaeology at the German Air Ministry; the Ministry published his lecture as Luftbild und Vorgeschichte, and Crawford was frustrated that the British {{government did not}} publish his work with the same enthusiasm. From there, he visited Vienna to meet with his friend, the archaeologist Oswald Menghin; Menghin took Crawford to an event celebrating the Anschluss, <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> met the prominent Nazi Josef Bürckel. Shortly after, he holidayed in Schleswig-Holstein, where German archaeologists took {{him to see the}} Danevirke.|$|E
5|$|Dugan {{made his}} first sound effects {{recordings}} to augment his theatrical sound designs. As he grew more interested in field recording, he was attracted to the sounds found in pristine natural settings—environments without human noise. A board member and webmaster of Nature Sounds Society, Dugan has conducted equipment training sessions since 1994, and has given talks about his experiences in nature recording. He has traveled to New Zealand in pursuit of recordings, but mainly devotes himself to U.S. National Parks and Monuments such as Yosemite and Muir Woods. Other national parks and monuments <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> has recorded sound include Joshua Tree, Pinnacles, Lassen Volcanic, Yellowstone, Haleakala, Olympic, Zion, Bryce Canyon, Kings Canyon, Sequoia and Lava Beds.|$|E

5|$|During the {{two years}} {{following}} the battle, Curtis had brief periods in command of HMS Canada, HMS Powerful, HMS Invincible and HMS Formidable. In 1796, {{he was promoted to}} rear-admiral and raised his flag on HMS Prince. In Prince, Curtis led the blockade of Brest when most of the fleet was paralysed by the Spithead Mutiny. He was also in overall command of the naval operations which succeeded in destroying or driving off much of the French force sent to support the Irish Rebellion of 1798 culminating in the Battle of Tory Island, <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> was not present. Later in the year he joined Lord St Vincent off Cadiz with a squadron of eight ships of the line, and was soon afterwards made a vice-admiral. In 1799, he retired ashore.|$|E
5|$|Eager {{to augment}} {{his power and}} angered by Roosevelt's and Barkley's refusal to accept his {{suggestion}} of appointing Logan to the Supreme Court, Chandler did not attend a long-planned dinner in Barkley's honor on January 22, 1938; instead, he held an event of his own at Louisville's exclusive Pendennis Club <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> alluded to his intentions of challenging Barkley during the upcoming Democratic senatorial primary. Barkley officially announced his re-election bid the following day. The death of another federal judge on January 26 provided a second opportunity for Roosevelt to appoint Senator Logan to a judgeship and appease Chandler, but Logan refused to consider the appointment. Following a January 31 meeting in Washington, D.C. between Roosevelt and Chandler, during which Roosevelt urged Chandler to put his senatorial ambitions on hold, Chandler was encouraged by his political mentor, Virginia's Harry F. Byrd to challenge Barkley. Chandler heeded Byrd's advice, making an official announcement of his candidacy on February 23, 1938, in Newport, Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|Immersed in the university's violent gang culture, in 1947 he {{took part}} in a quashed attempt to {{overthrow}} the military junta of Rafael Trujillo in the Dominican Republic. Returning to student politics, Castro was involved with violent demonstrations in which protesters clashed with riot police, <b>at</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> became increasingly left-wing in his views. Traveling to Bogotá, Colombia, he fought for the Liberals in the Bogotazo before returning to Havana, where he embraced Marxism. In 1948 he married the wealthy Mirta Díaz Balart, and in September 1949 their son Fidelito was born. Obtaining his Doctorate of Law in September 1950, he co-opened an unsuccessful law firm before entering parliamentary politics as a Partido Ortodoxo candidate. When General Fulgencio Batista launched a coup and overthrew the elected presidency, Castro brought legal challenges against him, but as this proved ineffective, he began to think of other ways to oust Batista.|$|E
