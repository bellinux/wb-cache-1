5|$|The {{number of}} ready-use rounds is {{insufficient}} and the hoists <b>are</b> <b>desperately</b> slow. The 47mm guns, {{much more so}} than the large and medium-calibre guns, will have to fight at night; yet these are the only guns without a fire-control system designed for night operations. This is a deficiency which needs to be corrected as soon as possible.|$|E
5|$|After {{the events}} of the season six finale, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) and Michael Kritschgau (John Finn) <b>are</b> <b>desperately</b> {{attempting}} to find the truth behind the so-called alien object. Meanwhile, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) is still imprisoned by his own frenetic brain activity. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and Skinner are unaware of FBI Special Agent Diana Fowley's (Mimi Rogers) duplicity—she is working for Cigarette Smoking Man (William B. Davis). Scully then travels to Africa to unravel the secrets of the alien artifacts, finding something that looks like a spaceship buried under the shoreline off the Côte d'Ivoire coast. The object may prove that life originated elsewhere, and all religion is based on the Navajo contact with alien life. Unsuccessful, Scully returns from Africa to revisit Mulder in Washington, D.C., but instead she finds out that he has disappeared. She contacts Kritschgau and Skinner to find her partner. Cigarette Smoking Man has taken Mulder to a place where all his problems seem to have disappeared. Fowley helps Scully locate Mulder, which leads to her death at the hands of Cigarette Smoking Man.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile in the Capital, the {{situation}} is close to panic. Everyone knows by now that Gorbovsky's Tariel II cannot take them all to space and that the nearest to Rainbow spaceship that can won't make it in time. Plans like burrowing a huge underground cave under the Capital {{to hide from the}} Wave, or jumping over it, or diving under it (in the southern ocean) <b>are</b> <b>desperately</b> developed. At this time, Gorbovsky announces that only the children will be transported onto the orbit on Tariel II, but everyone agrees that this is the best choice. Afterwards a crowd of scientists approaches him and asks to take some of their documentation on board, since they consider it too valuable to be sent directly into space with mini-rockets.|$|E

Only the best horses and the best jockeys are allowed to enter and all horses are inspected by the vet when they arrive at Aintree to ensure that they are fit to race. This year we had 20 horse-catchers, at least two attendants at each of the 16 fences, four stewards to inspect the course, two BHA course inspectors, ten vets, 50 ground staff and 35 ground repair staff... We work closely with animal welfare organisations, such as the RSPCA and World Horse Welfare, to make sure we are up to date with the latest thinking and research... {{and to make sure that}} the horses are looked after properly and that the race is run as safely as possible." ...|$|E
500|$|David Fricke of Rolling Stone {{felt the}} album's lyrics have an [...] "emotional and {{pictorial}} directness, rare for Yorke". The lines [...] "No more {{going to the}} dark side with your flying saucer eyes / No more falling down a wormhole that I have to pull you out", from the track [...] "Atoms for Peace", were inspired by an [...] "admonition" [...] from Yorke's partner Rachel Owen. According to the Globe and Mail, [...] "The Clock", influenced by Arabic music, is a [...] "gliding, droning song about losing control while pretending 'that you are still in charge'." [...] "Analyse" [...] was inspired by a blackout Yorke experienced in his hometown Oxford: [...] "The houses were all dark, with candlelight in the windows, which is obviously how it would have been when they were built. It was beautiful." [...] The song [...] "Atoms for Peace" [...] references a 1953 speech by American President Dwight D. Eisenhower. The album title was inspired by [...] "these huge elephants {{that we have in the}} room at the moment, in the west, and people <b>are</b> <b>desperately</b> trying to erase them from public consciousness." ...|$|E
500|$|When Will {{is named}} to a {{national}} blue-ribbon panel on the arts in Washington, DC, {{early in the fourth}} season, he expects Emma to come with him, but Emma is very reluctant to do so: she doesn't want to leave her job for several months while he's away. They ultimately agree that Emma will stay behind and the two will reunite on weekends. They also agree to get married when Will returns, but the stress of planning a big wedding proves too much for Emma, and she leaves the church before the ceremony begins. She and Will eventually reconcile, and the two finally get married in the choir room with the glee club as witnesses in [...] "All or Nothing", after New Directions win Regionals. Following their marriage, the couple decide to have children, but are unable to conceive for several months. They <b>are</b> <b>desperately</b> trying {{to do so in the}} fifth season's tenth episode [...] "Trio", and are caught having sex in the school by Becky Jackson (Lauren Potter). At the end of the episode, Emma reveals to Will that she is pregnant. In [...] "Opening Night" [...] Emma gives birth to a boy, Daniel Finn Schuester. During the final season, in the episode Transitioning, she convinces a torn Will to choose what's best for him, to stay at Vocal Adrenaline with a promising salary and facility but unhappy or to stop. In a parallel episode to the Pilot, 2009, she is aware and concerned with Kurt's depression and consults with his father about it and also convince Will to stay with the Glee Club as the kids still needs him and that it what makes him happy. In the series finale, [...] "Dreams Come True", she is now living happily with the newly promoted Will as the principal and in the future they have more kids together. She appears at the McKinley's auditorium rededication to Finn Hudson and enjoys the final performance of the New Directions. She is visibly shocked when Will and Terri hug and together with all of the Glee Cast take a final bow.|$|E

2500|$|Anticipating a {{damaging}} ice storm, approximately 4,500linemen {{were placed}} on standby to repair downed power lines in North Carolina; 1,000state transportation workers also prepared for heavy snowfall, with crews placed on 12-hour shifts to be deployed as needed. Crews {{from across the country}} arrived to assist North Carolina power companies. Two million gallons of brine were used to pre-treat roads statewide. Across Tennessee, state offices closed for January22, warming centers opened, and the Red Cross placed shelters on standby.

2500|$|On July 6, 2016, former Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson filed {{a sexual}} {{harassment}} lawsuit against Ailes. Carlson alleged {{that she had been}} fired for rebuffing Ailes' advances. Ailes, through his attorney, Susan Estrich, denied the charges. Three days later, Gabriel Sherman reported accounts from six women (two publicly and four anonymously) who alleged sexual harassment by Ailes. In response, Ailes' counsel released a statement: [...] "It has become obvious that Ms. Carlson and her lawyer <b>are</b> <b>desperately</b> attempting to litigate this in the press because they have no legal case to argue.

2500|$|Janusz Zajdel. He {{became the}} second most popular Polish science fiction writer (after Stanisław Lem) until his sudden death in 1985. Zajdel's novels created the core of Polish social fiction and dystopian fiction. In his works, he envisions totalitarian states and {{collapsed}} societies. [...] His heroes <b>are</b> <b>desperately</b> trying to find sense in world around them; sometimes, as in Cylinder van Troffa, they are outsiders from a different time or place, trying {{to adapt to a}} new environment. [...] The main recurring theme in his works is a comparison of the readers' gloomy, hopeless situations to what may happen in a space environment if we carry totalitarian ideas and habits into space worlds: Red Space Republics or Space Labour Camps, or both. The Janusz A. Zajdel Award of Polish fandom is named after him.|$|E

2500|$|The {{community}} is eminently Portuguese — {{that is to}} say, it is slow, poor, shiftless, sleepy, and lazy. There is a civil governor, appointed by the King of Portugal; and also a military governor, who can assume supreme control and suspend the civil government at his pleasure. [...] there is one assistant superintendent to feed the mill and a general superintendent to stand by and keep him from going to sleep...There is not a wheelbarrow in the land [...] There is not a modern plow in the islands, or a threshing-machine. All attempts to introduce them have failed. The good Catholic Portuguese crossed himself and prayed God to shield him from all blasphemous desire to know more than his father did before him. [...] The people lie, and cheat the stranger, and <b>are</b> <b>desperately</b> ignorant, and have hardly any reverence for their dead.

The letter concluded: [...] "The events in Gaza have shocked us to the core. Relief and reconstruction <b>are</b> <b>desperately</b> needed but, for the real wounds to heal, we must also establish the truth about crimes perpetuated against civilians on both sides." [...] The chief rabbi of South Africa Warren Goldstein and Melanie Phillips asserted that this statement, made before the work of the mission has begun, violated provisions for impartiality of the fact-finding missions. Mary Robinson called Goldstone [...] "a dedicated and unimpeachable human rights lawyer and advocate" [...] who [...] "was able to work with the [...] Council's president to secure an agreement that he felt confident would permit the mandate to be interpreted {{in such a way as}} to allow his team to address the actions taken by both parties to the conflict".|$|E
