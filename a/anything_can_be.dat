25|$|Millions of collectibles, decor, appliances, computers, furnishings, equipment, domain names, vehicles, {{and other}} {{miscellaneous}} items are listed, bought, or sold daily on eBay. In 2006, eBay launched its Business & Industrial category, {{breaking into the}} industrial surplus business. Generally, <b>anything</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> auctioned on the site {{as long as it}} is not illegal and does not violate the eBay Prohibited and Restricted Items policy. Services and intangibles can be sold, too. Large international companies, such as IBM, sell their newest products and offer services on eBay using competitive auctions and fixed-priced storefronts. Separate eBay sites such as eBay US and eBay UK allow the users to trade using the local currency. Software developers can create applications that integrate with eBay through the eBay API by joining the eBay Developers Program. In June 2005, there were more than 15,000 members in the eBay Developers Program, comprising a broad range of companies creating software applications to support eBay buyers and sellers as well as eBay Affiliates.|$|E

500|$|The {{idea for}} [...] "No Russian" [...] was {{conceived}} {{during the initial}} brainstorming sessions for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 plot. The developers at Infinity Ward wanted to discuss how terrorists operate in the modern era, and sought to create an unimaginable, albeit plausible scenario that the player would feel uncomfortable in. Lead writer Jesse Stern noted that despite the grim subject matter, people instinctively {{want to know what}} it is like to experience these attacks, and cited documentaries about the 2008 Mumbai attacks and the Columbine High School massacre as evidence. According to Stern: [...] "These are human beings who perpetrate these acts, so you don't really want to turn a blind eye to it. You want to take it apart and figure out how that happened and what, if <b>anything,</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> done to prevent it. Ultimately, our intention was to put you as close as possible to atrocity." ...|$|E
500|$|In a less {{enthusiastic}} {{review for}} Entertainment Weekly, David Browne found Pearl Jam to be derivative of [...] "fellow Northwestern rockers like Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, and the defunct Mother Love Bone", {{and felt that}} it [...] "goes to show that just about <b>anything</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> harnessed and packaged." [...] NME accused Pearl Jam of [...] "trying to steal money from young alternative kids' pockets." [...] Nirvana's Kurt Cobain angrily attacked Pearl Jam, claiming the band were commercial sellouts, and argued Ten was not a true alternative album because it had so many prominent guitar leads. Robert Christgau, writing in The Village Voice, gave the album a [...] "B-" [...] and viewed it as another in a [...] "slew of Seattle albums" [...] that [...] "modulate the same misguided ethos", which he said was [...] "hippie" [...] rather than [...] "punk". Christgau described it as [...] "San Francisco ballroom music" [...] whose [...] "distinguishing characteristics" [...] could only be discerned by listeners if they [...] "take the right drugs". He later gave Ten a two-star honorable mention, citing [...] "Once" [...] and [...] "Even Flow" [...] as highlights, and quipped, [...] "in life, abuse justifies melodrama; in music, riffs work better". Charles R. Cross wrote in The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004) that Ten sounded less original and more self-important than Nirvana's Nevermind, but it also showcases the band's intricate guitar style and Vedder's distinctive singing.|$|E

2500|$|Critics {{have argued}} that Hume's {{position}} assumes the character of miracles and natural laws prior to any specific examination of miracle claims, thus it amounts to a subtle form of begging the question. To assume that testimony is a homogeneous reference group seems unwise- to compare private miracles with public miracles, unintellectual observers with intellectual observers {{and those who have}} little to gain and much to lose with those with much to gain and little to lose is not convincing to many. Indeed, many {{have argued that}} miracles not only do not contradict the laws of nature, but require the laws of nature to be intelligible as miraculous, and thus subverting the law of nature. For example, William Adams remarks that [...] "there must be an ordinary course of nature before <b>anything</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> extraordinary. There must be a stream before <b>anything</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> interrupted". They have also noted that it requires an appeal to inductive inference, as none have observed every part of nature nor examined every possible miracle claim, for instance those in the future. This, in Hume's philosophy, was especially problematic.|$|E

2500|$|As {{a result}} of ethical consideration, most {{research}} into diseases and conditions affecting fetal development has been restricted {{to the use of}} other animals aside from human beings. [...] Most accounts on the implications caused by diseases or conditions like rubella, hypothyroidism and intrauterine hypoxia involving humans have come from studies done on patients later in life, or more appropriately, after birth. [...] Although there is much evidence that points towards these prenatal diseases or conditions being precursors for improper brain development, and thus potential consequences for memory, it is hard to assume that these alone are the only cause. [...] If one could test for, and track the onset of the disease during gestation while screening potential extraneous variables, one may be able to better understand this topic. [...] It {{is important to remember that}} this is a newer, less explored, aspect of memory research. [...] If <b>anything</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> taken from this, it should be that most of these diseases or conditions resulting in poor fetal brain development can be prevented or mitigated if one exercises healthy living behaviour. [...] A large part of this involves proper nutrition and dieting.|$|E
2500|$|Baum's {{fairy tale}} {{contains}} many other allusions to American {{life in the}} late 19th and early 20th centuries. For instance, Dorothy's loyal companion, Toto, could be a play on [...] "teetotalers" [...] which {{is a person who}} never drinks alcohol. The prohibitionists deemed alcohol consumption should be unlawful and they were longtime political allies of Populists during the late 19th century. Toto trots [...] "soberly" [...] behind Dorothy on their adventure. The Winged Monkeys have been thought to resemble the Plains Indians who were [...] "once free people" [...] but were now enslaved by the Wicked Witch of the West. Their actions can be good or bad depending on how they are controlled; however, they [...] "belong to this country alone" [...] and therefore cannot leave, as can be said for American Indians. The Yellow Winkies that inhabit the Land of the West could represent Asian workers in California during the gold rush; their harsh work environment can be seen as enslavement. The lenses that the groups must wear before entering the City of Oz to dim the emeralds' shine turn out to be fake, like the Wizard. The Emerald City is not a city made of emeralds but a plain, white city where the emerald color lenses cast a green hue on everything and everyone. This shows that <b>anything</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> made to look spectacular if you allow yourself to be tricked. Baum traveled all over the United States and would have been introduced to all these events in the 19th century, making it very likely that he drew inspiration from the land around him.|$|E

2500|$|In {{a rather}} {{different}} notice written in 1350, Ludolph of Sudheim, a parish priest from Westphalia, correctly {{refers to the}} Pyramids as sepulchers, and says [...] "these tombs are called by the natives Pharaoh's granaries." [...] Some twenty years earlier the German Dominican William of Boldensele had traveled about Egypt and left (1336) a very critical account of the notion: [...] "the simple people of the country say that these were Pharaoh's barns and granaries in which Joseph had the wheat kept {{in the time of}} the great famine mentioned in the Bible ... But this cannot be true at all, for no place for putting in the wheat can be found there, and there is in inside these columns no empty space where <b>anything</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> placed. [...] For from top to bottom they are closed and made entirely of huge stones well joined to one another—except that there is a very small door quite high above the ground and a very narrow and very dark little passage through which one descends there for a certain distance, but it is not all wide enough to put grain in, as those of the country say and believe." [...] The German knight's memoir would provide the framework, and many of the details, {{for one of the most}} popular books of the late Middle Ages, the Travels of John Mandeville (1356). [...] The supposed author most likely did not visit the locales in his narrative, and in the case of his account of the Pyramids, he actually reverses the conclusions and reasoning of William: [...] "these are Joseph’s Granaries, which he had made to store the wheat for hard times ... Some say that they are tombs of the great lords of antiquity, but that is not true, for the common word through the whole country near and far is that they are Joseph's Granaries, and they have it written thus in their chronicles. [...] On the other hand, if they were tombs, they would not be empty inside, nor would they have entrances for going inside, nor are tombs ever made of such a large size and such a height—which is why it is not to be believed that they are tombs." ...|$|E
