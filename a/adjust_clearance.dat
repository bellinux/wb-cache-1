50|$|One of the {{features}} which distinguishes this axle from other high-performance or heavy-duty domestic solid axles is that unlike other axle designs, access to the differential gears is not through the rear center cover; rather, in the Ford 9 inch, the rear cover is welded to the axle housing, and access to internals is obtained by removing the center cover on the pinion (front) side of the axle through which the driveshaft yoke connects, with the differential assembly {{coming out of the}} axle as a unit attached to the cover.,, Although this requires disconnecting the driveshaft to access the internal gearset, it offers the advantage of being able to disassemble and reassemble the differential gears and <b>adjust</b> <b>clearances</b> conveniently on the benchtop, rather than with the restricted access of working within the axle housing under the car.|$|R
40|$|Carboplatin {{clearance}} {{depends on}} the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and Calvert's formula is frequently used to achieve a target area under the time vs concentration curve (mg ml(- 1) min). Creatinine clearance is a substitute for GFR when creatinine values {{are determined by the}} JaffÃ© method, which is being replaced by the enzymatic method. When the enzymatic method is used, the corresponding creatinine clearance theoretically exceeds GFR, and the use of creatinine clearance as GFR in Calvert's formula results, accordingly, in overdosing of carboplatin. In this study, we have established a model for <b>adjusting</b> the creatinine <b>clearance</b> to offset this bias based on a relationship between creatinine values measured by the JaffÃ© method and by the enzymatic method: <b>adjusted</b> creatinine <b>clearance</b> (ml min(- 1)) = creatinine clearance (ml min(- 1)) x [serum creatinine (mg dl(- 1)) ]/[serum creatinine (mg dl(- 1)) + 0. 2]. Subsequently, we validated this model using the data from 35 lung cancer patients. Estimated clearances of carboplatin with the original equation [creatinine clearance + 25] were systematically higher than observed clearances [mean prediction error (MPE) +/- standard error (s. e.) = 26 +/- 5 %].

The influence of the loads applied to tools, the clearance between tools, the shape of the tool profile and the position of tools have been investigated, based on the axisymmetric model to save computational time. The design optimization method based on the numerical simulations have been applied to search the optimum design points, in order to reduce the thinning subjected to the constraints of the geometric shape of the shell and the suppression of wrinkles.

40|$|Abstract Background While infections {{with human}} {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) are highly prevalent among sexually active {{young women in}} Uganda, information on incidence, clearance and their associated risk factors is sparse. To estimate the incidence, prevalence and determinants of HPV infections, we conducted a prospective follow-up study among 1, 275 women aged 12 - 24 years {{at the time of}} recruitment. Women answered a questionnaire and underwent a pelvic examination at each visit to collect exfoliated cervical cells. The presence of 42 HPV types was evaluated in exfoliated cervical cells by a polymerase chain based (PCR) assay (SPF 10 -DEIA LiPA). Results Three hundred and eighty (380) of 1, 275 (29. 8 %) women were followed up for a median time of 18. 5 months (inter-quartile range 9. 7 - 26. 6). Sixty-nine (69) women had incident HPV infections during 226 person-years of follow-up reflecting an incidence rate of 30. 5 per 100 person-years. Incident HPV infections were marginally associated with HIV positivity (RR = 2. 8, 95 % CI: 0. 9 - 8. 3). Clearance for HPV type-specific infections was frequent ranging between 42. 3 % and 100. 0 % for high- and 50 % and 100 % for low-risk types. Only 31. 2 % of women cleared all their infections. Clearance was associated with HIV negativity (<b>Adjusted</b> <b>clearance</b> = 0. 2, 95 % CI: 0. 1 - 0. 7) but not with age at study entry, lifetime number of sexual partners and multiplicity of infections. The prevalence of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSILs) was 53 / 365 (14. 5 %). None of the women had a high-grade cervical lesion (HSIL) or cancer. Twenty-two (22) of 150 (14. 7 %) HPV negative women at baseline developed incident LSIL during follow-up. The risk for LSIL appeared to be elevated among women with HPV 18 -related types compared to women not infected with those types (RR = 3. 5, 95 % CI: 1. 0 - 11. 8). Conclusions Incident HPV infections and type-specific HPV clearance were frequent among our study population of young women. These results underscore the need to vaccinate pre-adolescent girls before initiation of sexual activity. </p...|$|R

5000|$|Designed by Aurelio Lampredi, the Fiat Twin Cam (also {{known as}} the Lampredi Twin Cam) was an {{advanced}} inline-four automobile engine produced from 1966 through 2000 as a Fiat/Lancia engine until it {{was replaced by the}} [...] "family B" [...] series of engines. The engine uses the block of the OHV engine found in the Fiat 124 with some modifications to accept the belt drive for the camshafts. The head itself is made in three pieces, one carrying the combustion chamber and valves and one separate casting for each camshaft in tunnel type bearings. The valves had an included angle of 65 degrees. The engine featured a revolutionary new method for <b>adjusting</b> the valve <b>clearance.</b> Usually at that time in DOHC engines like from Alfa Romeo or Jaguar, small shims were placed on the valve stem inside the bucket tappets, thereby necessitating the removal of the camshafts to get access to these shims to <b>adjust</b> the valve <b>clearance,</b> making for time consuming and very expensive maintenance work. Lampredi’s design placed the shims on top of the tappets where they could be removed with the camshaft in situ after the tappets were pressed down with a special tool. This design was patented for Fiat and was used in the engines of the 128 and 130, and even the (Ferrari/Fiat) Dino V6 engine was converted to this system.The engine was produced in a large number of displacements, ranging from 1,297 cc to 1,995 cc and was used in Fiat, Lancia, Alfa Romeo, SEAT and Morgan cars.|$|R
40|$|Wear {{and failure}} of {{mechanical}} seals may be critical in certain application {{and should be}} avoided. Large relative misalignment between the seal faces {{is the most likely}} cause for intermittent contact and the increased friction that eventually brings failure. Adjustment of seal clearance is probably the most readily implemented method of reducing the relative misalignment and the elimination of seal face contact during its operation. This method is demonstrated {{with the aid of a}} noncontacting flexibly mounted rotor (FMR) mechanical face seal test rig employing a cascade control scheme. Eddy current proximity probes measure the seal clearance directly. The inner loop controls the clearance, maintaining a desired gap through adjusting the air pressure in the rotor chamber of the seal. When contact is detected the outer loop <b>adjusts</b> the <b>clearance</b> set point according to variance differences in the probes signals. These differences in variance have been found to be a reliable quantitative indication for such contacts. They are complimentary to other more qualitative phenomenological indications, and provide the controlled variable data for the outer loop. Experiments are conducted to test and verify this active control scheme and strategy. Analysis and results both show that contrary to intuition for the seal under investigation reducing seal clearance can eliminate contact and the outer cascade loop indeed drives the control toward this solution. 1...|$|R

The Australian Trial in Acute Hepatitis C (ATAHC) was {{a study of the}} natural history and treatment of recent HCV, as defined by positive anti-HCV antibody, preceded by either acute clinical HCV infection within the prior 12 months or seroconversion within the prior 24 months. Factors associated with spontaneous and treatment-induced HCV clearance, including variations in IL 28 B, were assessed. Among 163 participants, 132 were untreated (n 5 52) or had persistent infection (infection duration 26 weeks) at treatment initiation (n 5 80). Spontaneous clearance was observed in 23 % (30 of 132 participants).

Materials and Methods: Prospective, randomized controlled trial at nine {{centers in the}} North America from 2009 to 2016. Patients were randomized {{to one of three}} lithotripter devices: the Cyberwand, a dual probe ultrasonic device; the Swiss Lithoclast Select, a combination pneumatic and ultrasonic device; and the StoneBreaker, a portable pneumatic device powered by CO 2 cartridges. Since the StoneBreaker lacks an ultrasonic component, it was used with the LUS‐II ultrasonic lithotripter to allow fair comparison with combination devices. Results: 270 patients were enrolled, 69 were excluded after randomization. 201 patients completed the study: 71 in the Cyberwand group, 66 in the Lithoclast Select, and 64 in the StoneBreaker group. The baseline patient characteristics of the three groups were similar. Mean stone surface area was smaller in the StoneBreaker group at 407. 8 mm 2 vs 577. 5 mm 2 (Lithoclast Select) and 627. 9 mm 2 (Cyberwand). The stone clearance rate was slowest in the StoneBreaker group at 24. 0 mm 2 /min vs 28. 9 mm 2 /min and 32. 3 mm 2 /min in the Lithoclast Select and Cyberwand groups respectively.

In {{view of the fact}} that the nonload area is ubiquitous in cylindrical roller bearings, there is a method for prolonging the fatigue life design by <b>adjusting</b> the working <b>clearance</b> of cylindrical roller bearings. In this article, optimization model of fatigue life of cylindrical roller bearings is developed with a quasi-dynamic method and calculated method of bearing life based on micro-area contact, considering the effect of assembly interference, temperature rise, and high-speed centrifugation. Aiming to the different geometry parameters and operating parameters of bearings, the effects of assembly interference on bearing fatigue life are discussed. The results show that the optimum fatigue life of roller bearings is achieved at negative working clearance with the loads distributed evenly within half ring. The optimum working clearance of roller bearings is not influenced by radial load. But with the increase in pitch diameter or decrease in rolling elements, the optimum assembly interference increases, and accelerating revolution of roller bearings will increase the optimum assembly interference as well...|$|R
