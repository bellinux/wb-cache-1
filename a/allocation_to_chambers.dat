40|$|Coral reefs {{around the}} world are rapidly {{degrading}} due to a range of environmental stress ors. Habitat degradation modifies the sensory landscape within which predator-prey interactions occur, with implications for olfactory-mediated behaviours. Predator na ve settlement stage damselfish rely on conspecific damage-released odours (i. e., alarm odours) to inform risk assessments. Yet, species such as the Ambon damselfish, Pomacentrus amboinensis, become unable to respond appropriately to these cues when living in dead-degraded coral habitats, leading to increased mortality through loss of vigilance. Reef fish predators also rely on odours from damaged prey to locate, assess prey quality and engage in prey-stealing, but it is unknown whether their responses are also modified by the change to dead degraded coral habitats. Implications for prey clearly depend on how their predatory counterparts are affected, therefore the present study tested whether olfactory-mediated foraging responses in the dusky dottyback, Pseudochromis fuscus, a common predator of P. amboinensis, were similarly affected by coral degradation. A y-maze was used to measure the ability of Ps. fuscus to detect and move towards odours, against different background water sources. Ps. fuscus were exposed to damage-released odours from juvenile P. amboinensis, or a control cue of seawater, against a background of seawater treated with either healthy or dead-degraded hard coral. Predators exhibited an increased time <b>allocation</b> <b>to</b> the <b>chambers</b> of y-mazes injected with damage-released odours, with comparable levels of response in both healthy and dead-degraded coral treated waters. In control treatments, where damage-released odours were replaced with a control seawater cue, fish showed no increased preference for either chamber of the y-maze. Our results suggest that olfactory-mediated foraging behaviours may persist in Ps. fuscus within dead-degraded coral habitats. Ps. fuscus may consequently gain a sensory advantage over P. amboinensis, potentially altering the outcome of predator-prey interactions...|$|R

40|$|In resource-poor environments, {{adjustment}} in plant biomass allocation implies a complex interplay between environmental signals and plant development {{rather than a}} delay in plant development alone. To understand how environmental factors influence biomass allocation or the developing phenotype, {{it is necessary to}} distinguish the biomass allocations resulting from environmental gradients or ontogenetic drift. Here, we compared the development trajectories of cotton plants (Gossypium herbaceum L.), which were grown in two contrasting soil textures during a 60 -d period. Those results distinguished the biomass allocation pattern resulting from ontogenetic drift and the response to soil texture. The soil texture significantly changed the biomass <b>allocation</b> <b>to</b> leaves and roots, but not to stems. Soil texture also significantly changed the development trajectories of leaf and root traits, but did not change the scaling relationship between basal stem diameter and plant height. Results of nested ANOVAs of consecutive plant-size categories in both soil textures showed that soil gradients explained an average of 63. 64 - 70. 49 % of the variation of biomass <b>allocation</b> <b>to</b> leaves and roots. Ontogenetic drift explained 77. 47 % of the variation in biomass <b>allocation</b> <b>to</b> stems. The results suggested that the environmental factors governed the biomass <b>allocation</b> <b>to</b> roots and leaves, and ontogenetic drift governed the biomass <b>allocation</b> <b>to</b> stems. The results demonstrated that biomass <b>allocation</b> <b>to</b> metabolically active organs (e. g., roots and leaves) was mainly governed by environmental factors, and that biomass <b>allocation</b> <b>to</b> metabolically non-active organs (e. g., stems) was mainly governed by ontogenetic drift. We concluded that differentiating the causes of development trajectories of plant traits was important to the understanding of plant response to environmental gradients...|$|R
40|$|The Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ) {{has been}} {{suspected}} {{of carrying out}} a harmonising agenda over and beyond the conventional law-interpreting function of the judiciary. This study aims to investigate empirically two theories {{in relation to the}} development of EU copyright law: (i) that the Court has failed to develop a coherent copyright jurisprudence (lacking domain expertise, copyright specific reasoning, and predictability); (ii) that the Court has pursued an activist, harmonising agenda (resorting to teleological interpretation of European law rather than – less discretionary – semantic and systematic legal approaches). We have collected two data sets relating to all ECJ copyright and database cases up to Svensson (February 2014) : (1) Statistics about the <b>allocation</b> of cases <b>to</b> <b>chambers,</b> the composition of chambers, the Judge Rapporteur, and Advocate General (including coding of the professional background of the personnel); (2) Content analysis of argumentative patterns in the decisions themselves, using a qualitative coding technique. Studying the relationship between (1) and (2) allows us to identify links between certain Chambers/ Court members and legal approaches, over time, and by subject. These shed light on the internal workings of the court, and also enable us to explore theories about the nature of ECJ jurisprudence. The analysis shows that private law and in particular intellectual property law expertise is almost entirely missing from the Court. However, we find that the Court has developed a mechanism for enabling judicial learning through the systematic assignment of cases to certain Judges and AGs. We also find that the Court has developed a “fair balance” topos linked to Judge Malenovský (rapporteur on 24 out of 40 copyright cases) that does not predict an agenda of upward harmonisation, with about half of judgments narrowing rather than widening the scope of copyright protection...|$|R

40|$|We {{examined}} interspecific and intraspecific {{variation in}} tree seedling survival {{as a function}} of <b>allocation</b> <b>to</b> carbohydrate reserves and structural root biomass. We predicted that <b>allocation</b> <b>to</b> carbohydrate reserves would vary {{as a function of}} the phenology of shoot growth, because of a hypothesized tradeoff between aboveground growth and carbohydrate storage. Intraspecific variation in levels of carbohydrate reserves was induced through experimental defoliation of naturally occurring, 2 -year-old seedlings of four northeastern tree species - Acer rubrum, A. saccharum, Quercus rubra, and Prunus serotina - with shoot growth strategies that ranged from highly determinate <b>to</b> indeterminate. <b>Allocation</b> <b>to</b> root structural biomass varied among species and as a function of light, but did not respond to the defoliation treatments. <b>Allocation</b> <b>to</b> carbohydrate reserves varied among species, and the two species with the most determinate shoot growth patterns had the highest total mass of carbohydrate reserves, but not the highest concentrations. Both the total mass and concentrations of carbohydrate reserves were significantly reduced by defoliation. Seedling survival during the year following the defoliation treatments did not vary among species, but did vary dramatically in response to defoliation. In general, there was an approximately linear relationship between carbohydrate reserves and subsequent survival, but no clear relationship between <b>allocation</b> <b>to</b> root structural biomass and subsequent survival. Because of the disproportionate amounts of reserves stored in roots, we would have erroneously concluded that <b>allocation</b> <b>to</b> roots was significantly and positively related to seedling survival if we had failed to distinguish between reserves and structural biomass in roots...|$|R
