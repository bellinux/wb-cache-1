50|$|The Becolsub {{technology}} {{consists of}} pulping without water, mechanical demucilaging and mixing the by-products (fruit outer-skin and mucilage) in a screw conveyor. The technology {{also includes a}} hydromechanical device to remove floating fruits and light impurities, as well as heavy and hard objects, and a cylindrical screen to remove the fruits whose skin was not separated in the pulping machine. Scientists at Cenicafé discovered that a coffee fruit with mucilage (immature and dry fruits have no mucilage) has enough water inside for the skin and seeds to be separated in conventional pulping machines without water, that the liquid was only required as <b>a</b> <b>conveying</b> <b>means</b> and that pulping without water avoids 72% of the potential contamination.|$|E
40|$|The {{using of}} dot matrix display as <b>an</b> {{information}} <b>conveying</b> <b>means</b> {{has been widely}} spread in many fields. Its interesting display can attract others' attentions to see the information that it conveys. Dot matrix display standard design {{does not make the}} operator possible to change the data easily, especially when the display is put in the position which is difficult to reach. The tools consist of transmitter and receiver. In the transmitter part, the result of the data which comes from the keypad {{can be seen in the}} display, so that the content can be read, changed, and corrected before being transmitted serially. The data transmition can be done through power line by using the help of the modulator-demodulator to the receiver to be displayed in the receiver's display. The control of the tool uses microcontroller 8031, and it is supported by 8279 interface which handles the control from the keypad matrix series. IC LM 1893 is used to modulation-demodulation of the serial data transmition from microcontroller 8031. The result of the testing shows that serial data transmition between transmitter system minimum and receiver system minimum can directly work well. However, the obstacle in the tuning of the modulator-demodulator series causes serial data transmition through power line cannot be done...|$|R

[...] Rockezines Frank M assessed it at 3/10 and noticed [...] "this is easily {{one of the most}} dreadful albums of the year. It all hinges towards death metal this time around. Of course the compulsory Swedish bits here and there are in place and furthermore they tend to really stink up the disc with some dire cliché metalcore bits." ...|$|R
