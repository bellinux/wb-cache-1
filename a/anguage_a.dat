40|$|Inspired by {{the success}} of the {{distributed}} computing community in applying logics of knowledge and time to reasoning ahout distributed protocols, we aim for a similarly powerful and high-level abstraction when reasoning about control problems involving uncertainty. Here we concentrate on robot motion planning, with uncertainty in both control and sensing. This problem has already been well studied within the robotics community. Our contributions include the following: • We define, a new, naturM problem in this domain: obtaining a sound and complete termination condition, given initial and goal locations. • We define a high-level <b>anguage,</b> <b>a</b> logic of time and knowledge, to reason about motion plans in the presence of uncertainty, and use it to provide general conditions for the existence of sound and complete termination conditions for a broad class of motion plans. ® We characterize the optimal sound termination conditions for the general problem, relate them to a class of fundamental knowledge based protocols and provide a natural example of knowledge based protocols lacking a canonical implementation. ...|$|E

This is important because “principles learned through research are understood more deeply and are likely to be applied with greater responsibility and commitment” (Rost, 2002, p. 202). With this in mind, the purpose of the current paper is to present the findings of an interview conducted with a Japanese university student following his experience studying English at a university in Canada...|$|R

We {{investigate}} an enrichment of the propositional modal <b>anguage</b> with <b>a</b> "universal " modality n having semantics x ~ iq ~ iff Vy(y ~ ~ 0), and a countable set of "names "- {{a special}} kind of propositional variables ranging over singleton sets of worlds. The obtained language ~cq proves to have a great expressive power. It is equivalent with respect to modal definability to another nrichment s 176 of L * ~ where [] is an additional modality with the semantics x ~ [] o iff Vy(y r x ~ y ~ q~). Model-theoretic haracterizations f modal definability in these languages are obtained. Further we consider deductive systems in ~c. Strong completeness of the normal s logics is proved with respect tomodels in which all worlds are named. Every ~~ axiomatized by formulae containing only names (but not propositional variables) is proved to be strongly frame-complete. Problems concerning transfer of properties ([in]completeness, filtration, finite mod l property etc.) from ~ to ~ are discussed. Finally, further perspectives for names in multimodal environment are briefly sketched. 1...|$|R

40|$|Subjects {{listened to}} a story {{containing}} sentences with five different quantifiers (all, many, some, a few, and none). They were then given a recognition test in which for each sentence {{they were asked to}} rate all the quantifiers as to how certain they were that each had appeared in the sentence. The degree of confusion between any two quantifiers (measured by both mean certainty ratings and first choice frequencies) declined monotonically with the separation of the two terms in a linear order. The confusion pattern was identical regardless of whether subjects were given intentional or incidental learning instructions. Successive interval scaling and the Luce biased choice model were both used to derive unidimensional scales of quantifier values that accurately described the obtained confusion matrix. A semantic feature model was also able to provide a fairly good overall account of the data, except hat it had difficulty explaining the high frequency of confusions between all and many. The results raise the possibility that a major component of the memory trace for quantifiers is an essentially analog representation f magnitude. English and other natural <b>anguages</b> contain <b>a</b> number of words that express degrees of quantity (e. g., all, some, several, often).

40|$|Objectives : Microindentation has the {{potential}} to measure the elasticity (stiffness) of individual patients’ bone. Bone elasticity plays {{a crucial role in the}} press - fit st ability of orthopaedic implants. Arming surgeons with accu rate bone elasticity information ma y reduce surgical compli cations including peri - prosthetic fractures. Th e question we address with this systematic review is whether microindentation can accurately measure cortical bone stiffness. Methods: A systematic review of all English l <b>anguage</b> articles using <b>a</b> keyword searc h was undertaken in Medline, Embase, PubMed, Scopus and Cochrane databases. Studies that only used nanoindentation, cancellous bone or animal tissue were excluded. Results: 10 94 abstracts were retrieved and 3 2 papers were include d in the analysis, 20 of which used reference point indentation and 1 2 of which used traditional depth sensing indentation. There are a number of factors that must be taken into account when using microindentation such as tip size, depth and method of anal ysis. O nly two studies validated microindentatio n against traditional mechanical testing techniques. Both studies used reference point indentatio n (RPI) with one showing that RPI parameters correlate well with mechanical testing, but another suggest ed that they do not. Conclusion: Microindentation has been used in various studies to assess bone elasticity but only two studies with conflicting results compared microindentation to traditional mechanical testing techniques. Further research, including more st udies compar ing microindentation to other mechanical testing methods are needed, before microindentation can be reliably used to calculate cortical bone stiffness...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 83 - 93) Because of the ???age {{of modern}} communications systems???, Deaf {{adults in the}} late part of the 20 th century face rising unemployment, underemployment, low wages, and little advancement opportunities. Their poor economic condition is largely attributed to poor English language competence, which is required for upward mobility in today???s job market. There are many obstacles to teaching English to deaf children. The first obstacle is the limited short-term memory capacity of children in general, coupled {{with the need to}} acquire language before the age of eight to ten. English was manually coded to aid in its acquisition. In doing so, however, an overwhelming load was placed on short-term memory. The second obstacle is confronted after examining the requirements of "appropriate input" for language acquisition. Manually Coded English does not meet two out of three of these requirements, since its focus is not on the input, but its form, and it cannot be sufficiently syntactically simplified. American Sign Language/English bilingualism is offered as a viable alternative. The best time to introduce English as a Second Language (ESL) is shown to be after children are ten to twelve years of age. This, however, brings on the third and fourth obstacles: how are deaf children to acquire American Sign Language as a first language, and how are they to acquire English as <b>a</b> second 1 <b>anguage.</b> Deaf adults within the deaf community are seen as the best alternative to teaching American Sign Language to deaf children as a first language. It is suggested this be undertaken as soon as the hearing loss is identified in an otherwise "normal" preschool setting. Pidgin Sign English is examined seen to be appropriate ESL input for the acquisition of English 1 <b>anguage</b> skills by <b>a</b> competent American Sign Language/English bilingual. The inordinate time delays seen between when hearing losses are identified and when deaf children enter school is observed to be the sixth and last obstacle. Parents' emotions and conflicting advice by the "experts" are examined as contributing factors. Teacher-organized parent groups are offered as one solution...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the nature of ignorance as it was {{interpreted}} in the Upani~adic tradition, specifically in Advaita Vedanta, and in early and Mahayana Buddhism, e specially in the Madhyamika school of Buddhism. The approach i s a historical and comparative one. It examines the early thoughts of both the upanis. a ds and Buddhism abou t avidya (ignorance), shows how the notion was treated by the more speculative and philosphically oriented schools which base d themselves on the e arly works, and sees how their views differ. The thesis will show that the Vedinta tended to treat avidya as a topic for metaphysical s peculation as t he s chool developed, drifting from its initial e xistential concerns, while the Madhyamika remained in contact with the e xistential concerns evident in the first discourses of the Buddha. The word "notion" has been chosen for use in referring t o avidya, even though it may have non-intellectual and emotional connotations, to avoid more popular a lternatives such as "concept" or "idea". In neither the Upani,ads, Advaita Vedanta, or Buddhism is ignorance merely a concept or an idea. Only in a secondary sense, in texts and speech, does it become one. Avidya {{has more to do with}} the lived situation in which man finds himself, with the subjectobject separation in which he f eels he exists, than with i i i intel lect ual constr ucts. Western thought has begun to r ealize the same with concerns such as being in modern ontology, and has chosen to speak about i t i n terms of the question of being. Avidya, however, i s not a 'question'. If q ue stions we r e to be put regarding the nature of a vidya, they would be more of t he sort "What is not avidya?", though e ven here l <b>anguage</b> bestows <b>a</b> status t o i t which avidya does not have. In considering a work of the Eastern tradition, we f ace t he danger of imposing Western concepts on it. Granted t hat avidya is customari ly r endered i n English as ignorance, the ways i n which the East and West view i gno rance di f f er. Pedagogically, the European cultures, grounded in the ancient Greek culture, view ignorance as a l ack or an emptiness. A child is i gnorant o f certain t hings and the purpose o f f ormal education, in f act if not in theory, is to fill him with enough knowledge so that he can cope wit h t he complexities and the e xpectations of s ociety. On another level, we feel t hat study and research will l ead t o the discovery o f solutions, which we now lack, for problems now defying solut i on. The East, on the o t her hand, sees avidya in a d i fferent light. Ignorance isn't a lack, but a presence. Religious and philosophical l iterature directs its efforts not towards acquiring something new, but at removing t. he ideas and opinions that individuals have formed about themselves and the world. When that is fully accomplished, say the sages, t hen Wisdom, which has been obscured by those opinions, will present itself. Nothing new has to be learned, t hough we do have t o 'learn' that much. The growing interest in t he West with Eastern religions and philosophies may, in time, influence our theoretical and practical approaches to education and learning, not only in the established educati onal institutions, but in religious, p sychological, and spiritual activities as well. However, the requirements o f this thesis do no t permit a formulation of revolutionary method or a call to action. It focuses instead on the textual arguments which attempt to convince readers that t he world in which they take themselves to exist is not, in essence, real, on the ways i n which the l imitations of language are disclosed, and on the provisional and limited schemes that are built up to help students see through their ignorance. The metaphysic s are provisional because they act only as spurs and guides. Both the Upanisadic and Buddhist traditions that will be dealt with here stress that language constantly fails to encompass the Real. So even terms s uch as 'the Real', 'Absolute', etc., serve only to lead to a transcendent experience. The sections dealing with the Upanisads and Advaita Vedanta show some of the historical evolution of the notion of avidya, how it was dealt with as maya, and the q uestions that arose as t o its locus. With Gau?apada we see the beginnings of a more abstract treatment of the topic, and, the influence of Buddhism. Though Sankhara' S interest was primarily directed towards constructing a philosophy to help others attain mok~a (l iberation), he too introduced t echnica l t e rminology not found in the works of his predecessors. His work is impressive, but areas of it are incomplete. Numbers of his followers tried to complete the systematic presentation of his insi ghts. Their work focuses on expl anat i ons of adhyasa (superimposition), t he locus and object of ignorance, and the means by which Brahman takes itself to be the jiva and the world. The section on early Buddhism examines avidya in the context o f the four truths, together with dubkha (suffering), the r ole it p l ays in t he chain of dependent c ausation, a nd t he p r oblems that arise with t he doctrine of anatman. With t he doct rines of e arly Buddhism as a base, the Madhyamika elaborated questions that the Buddha had said t e nded not t o edi f ication. One of these had to do with own - being or svabhava. Thi s serves a s a centr e around which a discussion o f i gnorance unfolds, both i ndividual and coll ective ignorance. There follows a treatment of the cessation of ignorance as it is discussed within this school. The final secti on tries to present t he similarities and differences i n the natures o f ignorance i n t he two traditions and discusses the factors responsible for t hem. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I would like to thank Dr. Sinha for the time spent II and suggestions made on the section dealing with Sankara and the Advait. a Vedanta oommentators, and Dr. Sprung, who supervised, direoted, corrected and encouraged the thesis as a whole, but especially the section on Madhyamika, and the final comparison...|$|R
