5|$|Under the Constitution, the Cabinet is collectively {{responsible}} to Parliament. In theory, Parliament acts as <b>a</b> <b>check</b> <b>on</b> {{the power of}} the Cabinet as Ministers are required to justify their actions and policies upon being questioned by MPs. However, in Singapore this is a weak check because the ruling People's Action Party holds a large Parliamentary majority, and party members who are MPs are required by party discipline to vote according to the party Whip's instructions.|$|E
5|$|In New York, {{the city}} asked commuters to avoid driving unless necessary, and {{apartment}} buildings to stop incinerating their residents' garbage and turn heating down to 60°F (15°C). New Jersey and Connecticut asked their residents not to travel, {{and to use}} less power and heat. Although it was a workday, traffic was light in New York City. <b>A</b> <b>check</b> <b>on</b> 303 buildings of the New York City Housing Authority later found near-total cooperation with the city's requests. Private residences were believed {{to have a high}} rate of voluntary cooperation with the city's plea to cut energy consumption.|$|E
5|$|Singapore's Elected Presidency {{scheme was}} {{created as a}} {{constitutional}} safeguard for the nation's future to prevent irresponsible governance. Being directly elected by the people gives the President legitimacy and moral authority to serve as <b>a</b> <b>check</b> <b>on</b> the executive's powers. The President's two main responsibilities are the protection of Singapore's past reserves and {{the preservation of the}} integrity of the public service. However, the President's role is custodial and ceremonial – he does not exercise executive powers. In fact, the President is generally required to act in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet, or of a Minister acting under the general authority of the Cabinet, in the exercise of his functions under the Constitution or any other written law, unless the contrary is expressly provided for.|$|E

5|$|The Constitution further {{provides}} for the composition of a parliament which encompasses members of parliament (MPs) elected through Single Member Constituencies and Group Representation Constituencies, Non-constituency Members of Parliament (NCMPs) and Nominated Members of Parliament (NMPs). MPs are representatives of the electorate and have the role of raising concerns that the people may have. The Government's view is that representative democracy is better understood as regarding political parties rather than individual MPs as the fundamental element in the political system. While the judiciary is not a direct manifestation {{of the concept of}} representative democracy, it serves as <b>a</b> <b>check</b> <b>on</b> the Government and the legislature by ensuring that their powers are exercised within the limits established by the Constitution, such as the fundamental liberties in Part IV.|$|E
5|$|The Government of Singapore {{is defined}} by the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore to mean the Executive branch of government, which is made up of the President and the Cabinet of Singapore. Although the President acts in her {{personal}} discretion in the exercise of certain functions as <b>a</b> <b>check</b> <b>on</b> the Cabinet and Parliament of Singapore, her role is largely ceremonial. It is the Cabinet, composed of the Prime Minister and other Ministers appointed on his advice by the President, that generally directs and controls the Government. The Cabinet is formed by the political party that gains a simple majority in each general election.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{leadership}} of Emir Assaf, they were confirmed as the rulers of Keserwan by Sultan Selim I following the Ottoman conquest in 1516. Emir Assaf died two years later and was succeeded by his son Hasan, who was in turn killed by his brother Qa'itbay. The latter ruled Keserwan until his death without children in 1523, after which he was succeeded by Hasan's son Mansur. Mansur had a long reign and was accorded by the Ottomans numerous districts in Mount Lebanon and its environs as tax farms. He eliminated many of his Sunni rivals, and his local power relied on a Maronite support base and his Maronite agents, namely members of the Hubaysh clan, who served as <b>a</b> <b>check</b> <b>on</b> the Shia Muslim sheikhs of Keserwan. At {{the peak of his}} power, Mansur's realm stretched from Beirut to Homs.|$|E

5|$|Originally, under , Clauses 1 and 2 of the Constitution, {{each state}} {{legislature}} elected its state's senators for a six-year term. Each state, regardless of size, {{is entitled to}} two senators {{as part of the}} Connecticut Compromise between the small and large states. This contrasted with the House of Representatives, a body elected by popular vote, and was described as an uncontroversial decision; at the time, James Wilson was the sole advocate of popularly electing the Senate and his proposal was defeated 10–1. There were many advantages to the original method of electing senators. Prior to the Constitution, a federal body was one where states effectively formed nothing more than permanent treaties, with citizens retaining their loyalty to their original state. However, under the new Constitution, the central government was granted substantially more power than before; the election of senators by the states reassured Anti-federalists that there would be some protection against the swallowing up of states and their powers by the federal government, providing <b>a</b> <b>check</b> <b>on</b> the power of the federal government.|$|E
5|$|The Constitution {{defines the}} Government of Singapore as the President and the Cabinet of Singapore. The {{executive}} authority of Singapore is vested in the President and is exercisable by him {{or by the}} Cabinet of Singapore or any Minister authorized by the Cabinet. However, the President normally plays a nominal and largely ceremonial role {{in the executive branch}} of government. Although the President acts in his personal discretion in the exercise of certain functions as <b>a</b> <b>check</b> <b>on</b> the Cabinet and Parliament of Singapore, he is otherwise required to act in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet or of a Minister acting under the general authority of the Cabinet. It is the Cabinet that has the general direction and control of the Government. As Singapore follows the Westminster system of government, the legislative agenda of Parliament is determined by the Cabinet. At the start of each new Parliamentary session, the President gives an address prepared by the Cabinet that outlines what the Cabinet intends to achieve in the session.|$|E
