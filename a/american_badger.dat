25|$|The ranch {{supports}} {{a wide variety}} of wildlife including mule deer, pronghorn antelope, coyote, <b>American</b> <b>badger,</b> jackrabbits, squirrels, and chipmunks. Bird species native to the area include sage grouse, mountain quail, mountain chickadees, pygmy nuthatch, great horned owls, hawks, and golden eagles.|$|E
25|$|Predator species include coyote (Canis latrans), bobcat (Lynx rufus), <b>American</b> <b>badger</b> (Taxidea taxus), falcons (Falconidae), and hawks and eagles (Accipitridae) prey {{on adult}} and {{juvenile}}s. Crows and ravens (Corvus spp.) and magpies (Pica spp.) consume juvenile birds. Coyotes, ground squirrels (Sciuridae spp.), and badgers {{are the most}} important mammalian nest predators. Among bird species, magpies and ravens commonly prey on Greater Sage-Grouse nests.|$|E
25|$|Ecologists {{consider}} this rodent to be a keystone species. They {{are an important}} prey species, being the primary diet in prairie species such as the black-footed ferret, swift fox, golden eagle, <b>American</b> <b>badger,</b> and ferruginous hawk. Other species, such as the mountain plover and the burrowing owl, also rely on prairie dog burrows for nesting areas. Even grazing species, such as plains bison, pronghorn, and mule deer have shown a proclivity for grazing on the same land used by prairie dogs.|$|E

50|$|<b>American</b> <b>badgers</b> {{are most}} {{commonly}} found in treeless areas, including tallgrass and shortgrass prairies, grass-dominated meadows and fields within forested habitats, and shrub-steppe communities. In the Southwest, plant indicators of the Sonoran and Transition life zones (relatively low, dry elevations) commonly associated with <b>American</b> <b>badgers</b> include creosotebush(Larrea tridentata), junipers (Juniperus spp.), gambel oak (Quercus gambelii), willows (Salix spp.), cottonwoods (Populus spp.), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), grasses, and sagebrushes (Artemisia spp.).|$|R
25|$|Predators of black-footed ferrets include golden eagles, great horned owls, coyotes, <b>American</b> <b>badgers,</b> bobcats, prairie falcons, {{ferruginous}} hawks, and prairie rattlesnakes.|$|R
25|$|There {{are many}} {{carnivorous}} and omnivorous mammals {{native to the}} area, although several are extirpated or are part of threatened populations. The Mexican wolf's range in the mountains {{is limited to the}} foothills of Durango or may have been extirpated the black bear population is small, and the Mexican grizzly bear that once resided here is confirmed extinct. Jaguar and ocelot are also now rare. On the other hand, mountain lion and bobcat are more common. On the eastern slopes there are <b>American</b> <b>badger,</b> coyote and gray fox that live across the mountains. Native ungulates include the white tailed deer, mule deer, and collared peccary. Rodents and lagomorphs include the eastern cottontail, which lives in the forests of the western slopes, cliff chipmunk, rock squirrel, Mexican fox squirrel, and various species of Cricetidae. Raccoons, hog-nosed skunk, and hooded skunk live in the mountains. The white-nosed coati lives on the western slopes, and the ring-tailed cat lives throughout. Many species of bats live in the mountains also.|$|E
25|$|The Aspen Parkland is {{agricultural}} land. The {{most prominent}} wildlife species {{which may be}} found are coyote (Canis latrans), hare, striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), North American porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum), Richardson's ground squirrel (Spermophilus richardsonii), snowshoe hare, cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus), northern pocket gopher (Thomomys talpoides), Franklin's ground squirrel (Spermophilus franklinii) and red fox. The Aspen Parkland is the environment of choice for the white-tailed deer. The Moist Mixed Grassland ecoregion is characterized by white-tailed deer, pronghorn (Antilocapra americana), coyote, rabbit, <b>American</b> <b>badger</b> (Taxidea taxus), red bat (Lasiurus borealis) and ground squirrel such as black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus).

Moose, pronghorn, mule and white-tailed deer, elk, rabbit, and ground squirrel coyote are common in this ecoregion.|$|E
