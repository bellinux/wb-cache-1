5|$|A bowl {{of living}} larvae is {{served at the}} meal, to Picard's disgust. He {{attempts}} to leave, only to find Riker blocking his way. The commander appears {{to be controlled by}} the parasite Quinn brought to the Enterprise. When the others see a prosthetic protrusion on the back of Riker's neck, he is accepted as one of them and allowed to dine. They reveal that the parasites are seeking to take over Starfleet, using humanoids as hosts. When he is <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> a handful of the larvae in his mouth, Riker suddenly produces a phaser and fires on one of the Admirals. Picard picks up a fallen weapon and the two Enterprise officers subdue the infected, causing parasites to leave the hosts and flee. One of the parasites scurries under a closed door and Picard and Riker follow it. They find Remmick ingesting the parasite to join several others inside him. Picard and Riker fire upon Remmick, destroying his body but freeing a giant parasite; the two continue to fire until it is destroyed.|$|E

25|$|In November 1869 the stele {{was broken}} by the local Bedouin tribe (the Bani Hamida) after the Ottoman {{government}} {{became involved in the}} ownership dispute. The previous year the Bani Hamida had been defeated by an expedition to Balqa led by Reşid Pasha, the Wali of Damascus. Knowing that a demand to give up the stone to the German Consulate had been ordered by the Ottomans, and finding that the ruler of Salt was <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> pressure upon them, they heated the stele in a bonfire, threw cold water upon it and broke it to pieces with boulders.|$|E

25|$|Just as the Later Liang {{army was}} <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> the four-prong plan into effect, the Later Tang emperor arrived at Yun Prefecture and {{advanced}} toward Daliang, with Li Siyuan as his forward commander. They encountered and surprised Wang, {{who was forced}} to retreat to the poorly-fortified city of Zhongdu (中都, in modern Jining, Shandong). The Later Tang forces quickly breached its defenses, and Wang tried to flee, but as he did, the Later Tang general Xia Luqi (夏魯奇), who {{had served in the}} Later Liang army before with Wang, recognized him and speared him. Wang was seriously injured and captured, along with Zhang and most of his army.|$|E
25|$|During a {{generally}} disappointing 1996 season, the Cavaliers upset the top ten–ranked Tar Heels at Scott Stadium. In the fourth quarter, North Carolina led Virginia 17–3 and, having advanced within the Cavaliers' five-yard line, were <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> the game away. However, Virginia cornerback Antwan Harris intercepted a Tar Heel {{pass in the}} end zone and returned it 100 yards for a touchdown. Quarterback Tim Sherman then led the Cavaliers to another ten points, capped by Rafael Garcia's late game field goal, and the defense shut down the demoralized Tar Heels for a stunning 20–17 comeback victory. The defeat cost North Carolina a bid to the Bowl Alliance; coach Mack Brown left UNC for Texas after another highly ranked Tar Heel team in 1997 also failed to receive a Bowl Alliance bid.|$|E
500|$|In {{the same}} week, Jackson and Presley had another argument. Newspaper reports had been {{suggesting}} that if Elvis were alive, {{he would not}} approve of his daughter's marriage. Annoyed, Jackson reportedly suggested that the couple could find out by holding a séance to contact the deceased [...] "King of Rock 'n' Roll". During the session they would ask his opinion of the union. Presley felt the idea was tasteless and, upon Jackson's continuing to push the idea, warned, [...] "If you stay on this particular road, they're gonna need a medium to contact you in the Great Beyond, because I'm <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> you there, right now."

500|$|After {{writing his}} 2010 album Airtight's Revenge with themes {{intended}} for male listeners, Bilal wrote A Love Surreal for female listeners with lyrics about love. He described writing the album as a surrealistic exploration of love. He {{was inspired by}} the surrealism of Spanish painter Salvador Dalí, after viewing a 2005 Salvador Dalí exhibit at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. He also drew on the shelving of his unreleased album Love for Sale, which inspired A Love Surreals title. [...] "For the longest I was supposed to sign with [...] and actually put Love for Sale out, but you know, things happen", Bilal told Okayplayer. [...] "It's surreal that I'm right back at the same spot <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> out a record with them. Also, surreal – the word surrealism – my inspiration for this record, I got a lot of concepts from Salvador Dali and the way he made his art pieces, it almost looks three-dimensional, and I wanted to do that with the sound of this album. So this record is almost like a sonic art piece." [...] Bilal had wanted to sign with eOne because of the artistic freedom the label had given fellow recording artist Dwele. The album's title was also inspired by John Coltrane's 1965 album A Love Supreme.|$|E
500|$|While these {{preparations}} {{were under}} way, the Allies continued to monitor Tirpitz. In late February the escort carrier [...] transported photo analysts {{and the ground}} crews for a Royal Air Force photo reconnaissance detachment to Vaenga airfield in northern Russia. These personnel were joined by three Supermarine Spitfires fitted for photo reconnaissance work and a single Consolidated PBY Catalina in March. The Spitfires flew regular sorties over Kaafjord and took very detailed photographs of Tirpitz and the nearby anti-aircraft batteries on 12 and 13 March; after being developed the Catalina flew these images to the UK. Although the German forces in northern Norway detected the Spitfire flights, the Kaafjord area's defences were not increased or placed on alert. On 16 March eight British, Dutch and Norwegian submarines were directed to take up positions off the Norwegian coast after decrypted German radio messages indicated that Tirpitz may have been preparing to depart Kaafjord for Germany to complete her repairs. A further eight British and Dutch submarines were dispatched on 18 March, but two days later {{it was concluded that}} Tirpitz was not <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> to sea and the submarines were diverted to other tasks or ordered back to port. On 21 March British intelligence warned the Admiralty that due to recent Soviet advances on the Eastern Front, the Germans were placing a strong emphasis on disrupting the flow of supplies to the Soviet Union and could dispatch Tirpitz to attack any convoys not escorted by capital ships. In response, Fraser was directed to provide battleship protection for the next Arctic Convoy.|$|E
500|$|Dr. Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) is {{scheduled}} for an interleukin 2 (IL-2) treatment but is absent from the hospital. Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) calls her, {{but she does not}} answer or come, so Karev cries to fellow resident Dr. Reed Adamson (Nora Zehetner). Shepherd spends ten hours in the operating room contemplating {{what to do about the}} tumor, with the motivational support of fellow surgeons Dr. Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson), and Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez). Webber orders Shepherd to end the surgery because he is wasting hospital resources. Shortly thereafter, Isaac awakens to Shepherd explaining that the surgery would not have been possible without paralyzing him. Isaac convinces Shepherd to operate again in secret the next day, and the latter maps out a diagram of the surgery on his bedroom wall while discussing it with his wife Dr. Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), who is home on bed rest after donating part of her liver to her father in the episode [...] "Tainted Obligation". Backed by his fellow attendings, Shepherd obtains Webber's permission to cut the chord but tells Avery and Lexie that they were not cutting the chord and playing by ear instead. He removes all but a tiny section of the tumor. Webber discovers that Shepherd is operating and is <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> an end to it, but Dr. Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw) tells him to go away. Shepherd has to cut a nerve to remove the rest of the tumor, but does not know which will result in paralysis. He decides with a game of [...] "Eeny, meeny, miny, moe", ultimately cutting the correct nerve and eliminating the entirety of the tumor. Despite the successful surgery, Webber is enraged and verbally fires Shepherd. Shepherd dismisses this in a light tone and goes home to drink champagne with his wife.|$|E

2500|$|Said {{argued in}} Culture and Imperalism {{that there were}} {{widespread}} ideas about Britain {{and the rest of}} the world in the 19th century that tended to glorify [...] "our world" [...] by devaluing the world of others. Said maintained that the contradiction between the warm, humanist world of Britain that was best exampled by Austen's idealised, bucolic English countryside vs. the brutal and rapacious exploitation of other people's countries in the British Empire depended upon a certain geographical understanding of morality with one what would be impermissible at home being all too permissible in the colonies of the British Empire. Said stated that this spatial way of understanding the world turns up with [...] "inert regularity" [...] in British literature from the 16th century onward, and formed a [...] "vital part" [...] of British national identity. Said argued that Austen embraced and promoted this spatial understanding of the world in Mansfield Park. Said argued that the play that is <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> on, which Price disapproves of, reflected the opposition between the [...] "indecent" [...] culture of France as represented by the lewd play vs. the [...] "decent" [...] culture of English domesticity as represented by Price. Likewise, Said argued that without the paterfamilias of Sir Thomas to provide the order necessary to underpin English domesticity, his family falls apart with the young people engaging in flirtatious behavior and the indecent play Lover's Vows <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> on. Said maintained that when Sir Thomas returned from his plantation in Antigua, which he tended to as a good master, he likewise restores order to Mansfield Park. Said argued that the reader is left with no doubt that Sir Thomas was also able to restore order at his slave plantation in Antigua just as he did upon his return to Mansfield Park, and that Austen created the character of Sir Thomas as the archetypal good master just as competent at running his estate in the English countryside as was in exploiting his slaves in the West Indies. Said admitted Austen does not talk much in the book about the slave plantation owed by Sir Thomas, but he contended that Austen wrote in such a manner she expected the reader to [...] "assume" [...] that the Bertram family's wealth was due to profits produced by the sugar worked by their African slaves, which he argued reflected Austen's assumption that this was just the natural order of the world. Said wrote that Austen was [...] "not a neutral" [...] writer, but instead a [...] "politically charged" [...] writer who depicted the [...] "world out there" [...] as a both a place of no great significance and a place that provided the wealth that supported the Bertram family, which he argued reflected a thoroughly imperialistic understanding of the world. Said stated that because the Bertrams owned their wealth to a slave plantation in Antigua, that Austen wrote the novel to glorify those families who become so rich in the 18th and early 19th centuries thanks to their investments in the sugar plantations of the West Indies.|$|E
