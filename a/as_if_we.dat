25|$|We {{classify}} {{other animals}} and living beings as nature, acting <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> ourselves {{are not part}} of it. Then we pose the question ‘How should we deal with Nature?’ We should deal with nature the way we should deal with ourselves! We should not harm ourselves; we should not harm nature...Human beings and nature are inseparable.|$|E
25|$|To {{visualize}} the first De Morgan's law, (¬x)∧(¬y) = ¬(x∨y), {{start with the}} middle diagram for x∨y and complement its shading so that only the region outside both circles is shaded, {{which is what the}} right hand side of the law describes. The result is the same <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> shaded that region which is both outside the x circle and outside the y circle, i.e. the conjunction of their exteriors, which is what the left hand side of the law describes.|$|E
25|$|Ursula Voss of the Universität Bonn {{believes}} that the theory of protoconsciousness may serve as adequate explanation for self-recognition found in birds, as they would develop secondary consciousness during REM sleep. She added that many types of birds have very sophisticated language systems. Don Kuiken of the University of Alberta finds such research interesting as well <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> continue to study consciousness with animal models (with differing types of consciousness), {{we would be able}} to separate the different forms of reflectiveness found in today's world.|$|E

25|$|The dialogue, {{somewhat}} unusually, {{does not}} set {{itself as a}} re-telling of the day's events. The dialogue is given unmediated, in the direct words of Socrates and Phaedrus, without other interlocutors to introduce the story or give it to us; it comes first hand, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> are witnessing the events themselves. This {{is in contrast to}} such dialogues as the Symposium, in which Plato sets up multiple layers between the day's events and our hearing of it, explicitly giving us an incomplete, fifth-hand account.|$|E
25|$|The Rev. Thomas Binney, to whom I brought {{letters from}} Rev. Mr. Roaf, my pastor, {{received}} me most kindly. Mrs. Binney acted <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> had been acquainted for the preceding six-and-twenty years; and, {{being the first}} London lady with whom I {{had the pleasure of}} acquaintance, I saw in her what I have since seen in English people of all ranks, who are really genteel - a most skilful and yet an indescribably easy way of making one feel perfectly at case with them. I cannot tell how it is done.|$|E
25|$|The {{implications}} of people's preference for novelty for human relationships are not straightforward and obvious. Evidence that people desire novelty comes primarily {{from studies of}} people's reactions to art objects and the like. This is different when it concerns human beings and social relationships because people can shift attention away from already familiar novel objects, while doing so in human relationships is difficult or not possible. But novel art objects {{are very different from}} people. If a piece of art becomes overly stimulating, we can simply shift our attention elsewhere. This is not a viable option should our spouse suddenly begin treating us <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> were someone else, for such treatment would pose serious questions about the integrity of people's belief systems. Consequently, people probably balance competing desires for predictability and novelty by indulging the desire for novelty within contexts in which surprises are not threatening (e.g., leisure activities), while seeking coherence and predictability in contexts in which surprises could be costly—such as in the context of enduring relationships.|$|E

500|$|He also, as in {{his essay}} on Hamlet, notes the {{realistic}} effect of Macbeth: [...] "His plays have the force of things upon the mind. What he represents is brought home to the bosom {{as a part of}} our experience, implanted in the memory <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> had known the places, persons, and things of which he treats." ...|$|E
500|$|Nobody {{was entirely}} {{sure that the}} work {{was going to be}} the group's last, though Harrison said [...] "it felt <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> were {{reaching}} the end of the line". After the album was released, the Get Back/Let It Be project was re-examined, and work on it continued into 1970. Therefore, Let It Be became the last album to be finished by the Beatles, even though its recording had begun before Abbey Road.|$|E

500|$|However, not all reviews were favorable. Brian Lowry from Variety {{gave the}} series a mixed review, stating that {{he enjoyed the}} action {{sequences}} but that [...] "the soapier elements mostly fall flat", and called the series [...] "painfully old-fashioned". Mike Hale, from The New York Times, called the series [...] "average" [...] and [...] "good on the action, a little muddled on the ideas". He added that [...] "the tone is placid and slightly monotonous, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> were watching the Walton family {{at the end of}} the world".|$|E
500|$|Born Robert Bard Kurrle in Port Hueneme, California on February 2, 1890, Kurrle had {{at least}} one sibling, Ernest W. Kurrle. [...] Prior to his entry into the film industry, Kurrle was already an {{innovative}} filmmaker. [...] In 1909, flying in a Curtiss open cockpit bi-plane, he photographed the Panama Canal from the air. In 1913, Kurrle would become the first photographer to take an aerial photograph of the city of Oakland, California. Describing the experience, Kurrle said [...] "... we went along just as smoothly <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> were riding on velvet".|$|E
500|$|Yasmin Alibhai-Brown and Kelvin MacKenzie {{expressed}} similar sentiments. MacKenzie criticised newspapers {{including his}} own employer, The Sun. He stated, [...] "if you believe you're a victim of an ethnic minority and you're white there is nowhere to go. Editors are so liberal that they are scared to be seen that they're moving {{to the right of}} their paper". Parker's mother, Davinia, expressed similar concerns that white victims of race crime are ignored. She said [...] "because we are white, English, we didn't get the coverage", adding [...] ""it's <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> don't count".|$|E

500|$|According to actress Marley Shelton, [...] "Rodriguez and Tarantino really co-directed, {{at least}} Planet Terror. Quentin was on set a lot. He had notes and {{adjustments}} to our performances and he changed lines {{every once in}} a while. Of course, he always deferred to Robert on Planet Terror and vice versa for Death Proof. So it's really both of their brainchild." [...] Tarantino has stated, [...] "I can't imagine doing Grindhouse with any other director in the way me and Robert did it because I just had complete faith and trust in him. So much so that we didn't actually see each other's movie completed until three weeks before the film opened. It was <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> worked in little vacuums and cut our movies down, and then put them together and watched it all play, and then made a couple of little changes after that, and pretty much that was it." ...|$|E
500|$|Not all reviews were positive. David Hinkley of The New York Daily News {{rated the}} pilot {{three out of}} five stars, stating [...] "The story and the {{chemistry}} work, but periodically the action feels rushed, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> all know the drill and {{we might as well}} get it over with. Future episodes may correct that, because they'll need less setup work." [...] Brian Lowry of Variety stated [...] "On paper, [...] "Hawaii Five-0" [...] appears destined for can't-miss success, offering a pre-sold name, an attractive cast and a stunning location," [...] but felt the millions spent on the pilot [...] "doesn't necessarily indicate smooth sailing, relying as it does on playful banter (more like frat-boy hazing) between the leads that grows tiresome even before the hour's over." [...] Ellen Gray of the Philadelphia Daily News felt it was [...] "a huge let down," [...] and was critical of the cast's performance, in particular O'Loughlin and Caan.|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert added Ugetsu to his Great Movies list in 2004, {{calling it}} [...] "one of the {{greatest}} of all films", and said that [...] "At the end of Ugetsu, aware we have seen a fable, we also feel curiously <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> have witnessed true lives and fates". Director Martin Scorsese has also listed it as one of his favourite films of all time. In 5001 Nights at the Movies, film critic Pauline Kael found it to be [...] "subtle, violent yet magical", and termed Ugetsu as [...] "one of the most amazing of the Japanese movies that played American art houses". [...] In 2000, The Village Voice newspaper ranked Ugetsu 29th on their list of the 100 best films of the 20th century. Ugetsu has a 100% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with the site's critical consensus stating, [...] "With its thought-provoking themes, rich atmosphere, and brilliant direction, Kenji Mizoguchi's [...] is a towering classic of world cinema".|$|E

500|$|We {{as readers}} or {{audience}} appreciate the characters {{by the force}} of our imagination's seeming to participate in the scene, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> were present during such an event in real life. Commenting on the scene in Julius Caesar where Caesar confides to Marc Antony his apprehensions about Cassius, Hazlitt writes: [...] "We know hardly any passage more expressive of the genius of Shakespeare than this. It is {{as if he had been}} actually present, had known the different characters and what they thought of one another, and had taken down what he heard and saw, their looks, words, and gestures, just as they happened." [...] In [...] "Hamlet", he observes that [...] "the characters think and speak and act just as they might do, if left entirely to themselves. [...] The whole play is an exact transcript of what might be supposed to have taken place at the court of Denmark [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|A {{paramedic}} {{also said}} police allowed the first ambulances that reached Pearl Roundabout to pass safely, while some security personnel captured videos, {{but when the}} ambulances moved out carrying casualties security forces had targeted the vehicles. He said: [...] "Later Bahrain T.V. showed only the scenes where they allowed us to pass in order to mislead the public opinion. I personally heard orders given to security forces via their communication devices to target, threat and delay paramedics {{as long as they}} can. Security forces dealt with us <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> were defendants and partners to protesters who wanted to hide them, whereas what we were doing was a professional and humane duty {{that has nothing to do}} with our political position." [...] When the block was lifted in the late morning till noon, paramedics did not find any casualties to take back to the SMC at Pearl Roundabout, despite seeing handcuffed protesters being stomped on by police when they arrived.|$|E
500|$|For {{the final}} scene, several {{producers}} hired horse riders {{in order to}} lead a herd of horses to run through the corn field. After this scene was complete, Utada wore the same outfit designed by Kozue Hibino, which is a large coated–dress with a trail of puffy inserts, and sung {{it in the same}} location. The ending scene was co-directed by Emmanuel Previnarie, Sze Kwan Chong and Marc Asmode, where they used a flying camera on a small helicopter to accomplish an aerial shot of Utada on the corn field. Regarding the female animation at the start, Utada believed it was a representation of her and further exclaimed their inspiration of the video was from the 1997 film Princess Mononoke; [...] "The people who were doing the on-the-spot filming seemed to have my sort of make. Like, not very adult-like and not very feminine... much like <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> were all Princess Mononoke. Uggh, it looks like I'll be getting more female fans now!" [...] Furthermore, the singer said: ...|$|E

You {{know their}} uncle is {{suspicious}} of me, and consequently jealous {{of all my}} servants; but <b>if</b> <b>we</b> employ yours, who is not suspected, {{because you are a}} stranger, I doubt not to get an assignation with the younger sister.|$|R
