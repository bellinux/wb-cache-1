50|$|The Athena rocket uses an Orbit Adjust Module (OAM) {{developed}} by Primex Technologies. Primex {{was acquired by}} General Dynamics in 2001. For the September 28th, 2001 Athena launch, the OAM was built by General Dynamics Space Propulsion Systems of Redmond, WA. The OAM houses the attitude control system and <b>avionics</b> <b>subsystem</b> (guidance and navigation, batteries, telemetry transmitters, command and destruct receivers and antennas). This 1 m long module is fueled with monopropellant hydrazine. After payload separation, the OAM performs a contamination and collision avoidance maneuver, distancing itself from the payload and burning any remaining fuel to depletion. Athena solid rocket motor provider ATK produces integrated upper stages using spin-stabilized or 3-axis stabilized Star solid motors that can provide higher velocities for GEO and escape (e.g. lunar and planetary) missions. Such an integrated upper stage based on a 2531 lb Star 37FM was employed for the launch of Lunar Prospector, the first lunar probe launched by a commercially developed launch vehicle.|$|E

40|$|The {{complexity}} of avionics communication architecture is increasing inherently {{due to the}} growing number of intercon-nected subsystems and the expansion of exchanged data quan-tity. To follow this trend, the current architecture of new gener-ation aircraft like the A 380, A 400 M or A 350 consists of a high data rate backbone network based on AFDX (Avionics Full Duplex Switched Ethernet) [1] to interconnect the essential subsystems. Then, each specific <b>avionics</b> <b>subsystem</b> might be directly connected to its associated sensors/actuators network based on low rate data bus like ARINC 429 or CAN. Although this architecture fulfills the main avionics requirements, it leads in the same time to inherent weight and integration costs due to the significant quantity of wires and connectors.

40|$|The Orion Crew Module (CM) is NASA's next {{generation}} manned space vehicle, scheduled to return humans to lunar orbit {{in the coming}} decade. The Orion avionics and GN&C architectures have progressed {{through a number of}} project phases and are nearing completion of a major milestone. The first unmanned test mission, dubbed "Exploration Flight Test One" (EFT- 1) is scheduled to launch from NASA Kennedy Space Center late next year and provides the first integrated test of all the vehicle systems, avionics and software. The EFT- 1 mission will be an unmanned test flight that includes a high speed re-entry from an elliptical orbit, which will be launched on an expendable launch vehicle (ELV). The ELV will place CM and the ELV upper stage into a low Earth orbit (LEO) for one revolution. After the first LEO, the ELV upper stage will re-ignite and place the combined upper stage/CM into an elliptical orbit whose perigee results in a high energy entry to test CM response in a relatively high velocity, high heating environment. While not producing entry velocities as high as those experienced in returning from a lunar orbit, the trajectory was chosen to provide higher stresses on the thermal protection and guided entry systems, as compared against a lower energy LEO entry. However the required entry geometry with constraints on inclination and landing site result in a trajectory that lingers for many hours in the Van Allen radiation belts. This exposes the vehicle and avionics to much higher levels of high energy proton radiation than a typical LEO or lunar trajectory would encounter. As a result, Van Allen radiation poses a significant risk to the Orion avionics system, and particularly the Flight Control Module (FCM) computers that house the GN&C flight software. The measures taken by the Orion GN&C, Flight Software and Avionics teams to mitigate the risks associated with the Van Allen radiation on EFT- 1 are covered in the paper. Background on the Orion <b>avionics</b> <b>subsystem</b> is provided, as well as an overview of the GN&C software architecture.

GN&C sensors include two Orion Inertial Measurement Units (OIMU's), a Vision Processing Unit (VPU) to process camera images, three barometric altimeters and a single GPS receiver. All of the sensors communicate to one of two Power and Data Units (PDU's). The PDU's multiplex analog and serial data from the sensors and write the data to the Orion Data Network (ODN).
