The article studies optimal property insurance in the presence of two sources of variation: equity risk and conversion risk. Equity risk is randomness of the value of a property. It tends to raise demand for conventional insurance. In contrast, conversion risk is randomness in the value the property would have if, after severe damage, it were converted to the highest-valued use. It is distinct from equity risk because the highest-valued use is typically not the current one. Under independent conversion risk, the optimum upper limit is a compromise among underlying conversion thresholds. Absent independence, the optimum can be quite different. Conversion risk can raise or lower the demand for property insurance.

40|$|A {{variety of}} historically-proven {{computer}} languages {{have recently been}} extended to support parallel computation in a data-parallel framework. The performance capabilities of modern microprocessors have made the "cluster-of-workstations" model of parallel computing more attractive, by permitting organizations to network together workstations to solve problems in concert, without the need to buy specialized and expensive supercomputers or mainframes. For the most part, research on these extended languages has focused on compile-time analyses which detect data dependencies and use user-provided hints to distribute data and encode the necessary communication operations between nodes in a multiprocessor system. These analyses have shown their value when the necessary hints are provided, but require more information at compile-time than may be available in large-scale real-world programs. This dissertation focuses on elements important to an efficient and portable implementation of runtime support for data-parallel languages, to the near absence of any reliance on compile-time information. We consider issues ranging from data distribution and global/local <b>address</b> <b>conversion,</b> through a communication framework intended to support modern networked computers, and optimizations {{for a variety of}} communications patterns common to data-parallel programs. The discussion is grounded in a complete implementation of a data-parallel language, C*, on stock workstations connected with standard network hardware. The performance of the resulting system is evaluated on a set of eight benchmark programs by comparing it to optimized sequential solutions to the same problems, and to the reference implementation of C* on the Connection Machine CM 5 supercomputer. Our implementation, denoted pC* for "portable C*", generally performs within a factor of four of the optimized sequential algorithms. In addition, the optimizations developed in this dissertation permit a cluster of twelve workstations connected with Ethernet to outperform a sixty-four node CM 5 in absolute performance on three of the eight benchmarks.

In rural areas, successful geocoding to a street address is limited by rural route boxes. Communities have assigned physical street addresses to rural route boxes as part of E 911 readdressing projects for improved emergency response. Our study compared automated and E 911 methods for recovering and geocoding valid street addresses and assessed the impact of positional errors on exposure classification. Methods The current study is a secondary analysis of existing data that included 135 addresses self-reported by participants of a rural community study who were exposed via public drinking water to perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) released from a DuPont facility in Parkersburg, West Virginia. We converted pre-E 911 to post-E 911 addresses using two methods: automated ZP 4 address-correction software with the U. S. Postal Service LACS database and E 911 data provided by Wood County, West Virginia. Addresses were geocoded using TeleAtlas, an online commercial service, and ArcView with StreetMap Premium North America NAVTEQ 2008 enhanced street dataset. We calculated positional errors using GPS measurements collected at each address and assessed exposure based on geocoded location in relation to public water pipes. Results The county E 911 data converted 89 % of the eligible addresses compared to 35 % by ZP 4 LACS. ArcView/NAVTEQ geocoded more addresses (n = 130) and with smaller median distance between geocodes and GPS coordinates (39 meters) than TeleAtlas (n = 85, 188 meters).

40|$|Nowadays, the television, {{movie and}} {{computer}} industry pose more strict requirements {{to what is}} a good quality movie. If years ago, a black & white movie with a modest 25 frames per second was considered very interesting and challenging, today things have changed. The real-time requirements for progressive video is above 30 frames per second and for interlaced the double of that. The frame quality itself grew to full-HD movies that have image resolutions of 1920 1080 pixels for one frame. On top of that, for special types of transmissions, like sport events, where action happens with incredible speed, the real-time requirement is fulfilled when a framerate of 60 fps is reached in progressive mode, and for computer screens even 80 fps are required. The need for better and stronger compression methods became soon obvious. The “earlier” compression standards were soon inefficient at the possible compression rates and a new and powerful compression standards appeared: H. 264. This was long expected and appreciated for it’s capabilities, it offers quarter-pixel luma inter prediction capabilities and eight-pixel for chroma. H. 264 is a very capable standard that can reach a high compression rate that can save up to 45 % of a stream’s bit-rate compared with the previous standards. However, the better performance comes with a price: the decoder’s performance and complexity which increase with more advanced profiles and settings. In pure software, H. 264 /MPEG- 4 Part 10 or AVC (Advanced Video Coding) video compression standard (H. 264) can require from 2 x to 4 x the Million Instructions per Second (MIPS) /pixel when compared to simpler codecs. The H. 264 decoder is about four times {{more complex than the}} Moving Picture Experts Group 2 (MPEG- 2) decoder and about two times more complex than the Moving Picture Experts Group 4 (MPEG- 4) Visual Simple Profile decoder. Even so, the advantages convinced most players on the research and industrial sites to implement H. 264 whenever a good performance was expected. At this point, this is the codec that is mostly used on different platforms. In IPTV, the trend is to move most of the complexity of a set top box from the user side towards the network infrastructure, what is now called “in thecloud”, in order to leave the client with an easy, cheap and stable “thin” set top box. Moving some complex processing steps from the client allows for a more scalable solution: a complex platform shared by multiple users can treat tens or hundreds of HD requests simultaneously. This requires a specific implementation of the H. 264 codec when adding real-time to the requirements list. This thesis describes the outcome of the IWT Vampire project that aimed on improving the H. 264 encoding/decoding steps towards “flexible-TV”, a “thin” IPTV client. The approach taken was to identify the critical blocks in the processing pipeline and hardware accelerate them towards several HD streams processing in real-time. This study was performed under heavy conditions, aiming for improving the smallest block partition, the 4 4 pixel block. It is known that this yields the highest detail accuracy, but also imposes the heaviest load on the encoder and decoder, when used for full frames. This block partition is both memory and processing intensive, and it was used for proving the performance of both the memory filter (MF) and the hardwired block (HWB). After carefully analyzing the challenges posed by the H. 264 standard, an algorithm specific solution was found for accelerating the motion compensation hardware by exploiting temporal redundancy that exists between different frames. This is also called the inter prediction process, and is executed with q-pel resolution. The pixels in such a frame are highly correlated {{and are more likely to}} be used/requested together. Thus, a special data arrangement in the memory was found that permits a high retrieval speed and provides the necessary pixels in a more compact way. The corresponding <b>address</b> <b>conversion</b> blocks and specific filtering steps were also designed and implemented within the MF block. The search for spatial redundancy, also called intra prediction, is treated together with other processing steps like: DCT transform, quantization, inverse transform, de-quantization and reordering step. These blocks form a hardware block called the Hardwired Block (HWB), that was specifically designed for improving the performance for several HD streams in parallel. This thesis describes in detail the standard requirements and chosen implementation details (being that the standard does not impose a certain implementation, it states the format that the stream should have and some guidance lines along the processing way). Then, the challenges imposed by each block are analyzed. The proposed implementation is further described, from a top level perspective down to the implementation details. The obtained results are presented together with a thorough comparisonwith similar existing designs. The MF block achieves 229 : 9 fps for 720 p frames and up to 95 : 9 fps for 1080 p HD frames for one stand alone implementation. Several instances of the MF may be used in parallel if the design requires it. The HWB showed that up to 32 HD frames may be processed in parallel with realtime (30 fps) performance by only one instance of the HWB. The conclusions point out the main achievements and future improvements or research topics...|$|E

Stability analysis of all but the simplest of these systems is often based on model linearization (interpreted either in state-space or frequency domain) and time domain simulation. The information obtained with these tools is limited to small-signal behavior or to specific trajectories. The following research extends present theories and analysis tools enabling large-signal stability analysis of power-electronics-based systems. ^ As an alternative to linear system analysis, nonlinear analysis may be conducted using Lyapunov techniques. The difficulty in such an approach is in calculating a suitable Lyapunov function candidate.
