40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the {{following}} considerations is the model-based control design of mechatronic systems. The focus of our work is the utilization of these techniques by developers, which are normally afraid of doing the model-based approach because of increased time consumption in early development stages, unsatisfying or missing hardware support within design tools, or the assumption of inefficient code from automated code builds. This paper will therefore show the usage of model-based design techniques, including automatic code generation, for applications using small 8 -bit microcontrollers with limited computing power and memory. Initially, the used concept for the code generation is discussed in detail, which is the key issue for model-based design methods. To show the efficiency of this approach, an industrial application [1] is designed by using this model-based method. This application will realize a breathing <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>device,</b> which will be used for medical and training purposes to simulate high altitude air conditions. It will use a fuel cell to adjust the percentage of oxygen for special conditions. To achieve this goal, the application will require special control algorithms which are different from those control algorithms usually used for fuel cells. One of the key aspects is the required reduction of hydrogen consumption. The heat and electrical power generated by the fuel cell are used to heat the breathing air and to supply the electronic circuits with electrical power. Especially the control algorithms have to be designed for robustness and safety due to the used hydrogen. Usage of a model-based approach for this purpose will allow early testing of the designed control algorithms including boundary tests which are not possible or dangerous with the real system...|$|E

40|$|The global air {{conditioning}} (AC) market {{is still a}} rapidly growing one. People in countries like India and China also want the luxury of {{living and working in}} air conditioned rooms, which will create a huge energy demand. With the limited resources of fossil energy left, {{there is a need for}} a different approach for cooling. Due to the limited time and resources it is not possible to focus on the project in a general way; thus it is approached in a practical fashion, exploring the possibility of cooling a building of the Technical University of Lodz by only using green energy taken from the sun to power an AC device. In detail, the task was to first compute the actual cooling needs of the building. After that, a proper technique that could provide these amounts of cooling needs was found, as well as the appropriate device that could be implemented in the building. Finally, a business part of the project was done and the project was evaluated on a financial basis. For the calculation of the cooling needs, some research was done to all the data and formulas that contribute to a building heat gains and losses. After acquiring the ones the team had access to, MATLAB was used to program a thermal model of the building, in reverse engineering was applied to estimate missing values and finally calculate the actual cooling needs of the building. This was then used to choose a suitable <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>device</b> based on research and inquiries with the manufacturers. The final part, the business plan, consists of Microsoft Excel calculations based on Polish energy costs, prices of acquiring and installing solar panels and the solar irradiation in the area. It was possible to show that the project, even when calculated with the worst case scenario, will turn a profit within 20 years after installation of the solar panels, most likely even earlier. Considering the longevity of modern panels, which exceeds 25 years, and a number of additional benefits coming from a self-energy generating building, the realisation of this project is strongly recommended. Furthermore, it is meant to encourage anyone to think about whether private solar panels would make sense in their situation and provide a small tool for that purpose on the team’s website as wel...|$|E
40|$|During last years, air {{conditioning}} demand has spread, {{both in the}} commercial and the residential sector. This caused a sensible increase in primary energy consumption. The innovative desiccant-based air handling units are a very interesting solution for {{air conditioning}} of buildings as they operate with low temperature thermal energy, such as waste heat recovered from a microcogenerator or especially solar energy. Solar radiation is widely available in summer and simultaneously there are the greatest demands for cooling, but solar energy can be used advantageously also to balance the winter thermal load. In the most common configuration, desiccant cooling system are equipped with a desiccant wheel, in which moist air is dehumidified by the adsorbent material and then cooled down by the evaporation of water and/or through an electric chiller (hybrid plants). A hybrid <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>device</b> with silica-gel desiccant wheel is installed in the laboratories of the Università degli Studi del Sannio (Benevento, Italy), and currently operate coupled with a microcogenerator and a natural gas boiler. The system in its actual configuration can operate only in cooling mode. In this thesis {{the operation of the}} experimental air handling unit, considering the coupling of the innovative air handling unit with different solar collectors types (flat plate, evacuated tube, concentrated photovoltaic and thermal collectors), is analyzed through dynamic simulations performed with the commercial software TRNSYS 17. In order to allow the system operation even in winter mode, suitable modifications have been identified and implemented in the model. Furthermore the influence of climatic conditions on the performance of the system is assessed, and also modifications to the air handling unit layout are considered. Finally, for completeness, the system constituted by the desiccant-based air handling unit and the microcogenerator is studied. The innovative air conditioning systems were used to balance the sensible and latent load of a 63. 5 m 2 university classroom. Moreover, during the intermediate period, in the weekends and whenever there is a surplus of thermal energy the possibility of exploiting this energy in excess for further heating purpose is considered. TRNSYS models were used to simulate the operation of the innovative system and that of a conventional system in order to evaluate operational data and performance parameters. Primary energy saving, equivalent CO 2 avoided emission and simple pay back period were evaluated. The performed analyzes showed that the desiccant-based air handling unit fed with a renewable energy source such as solar energy can advantageously replace a conventional air conditioning systems equipped with electrically-driven vapor compression cooling units if only energy and environmental performance are taken into account. However economic feasibility is still hard to obtain. For the considered application economic benefits do not occur together with the advantages mentioned above, although one considers incentives for the production of thermal energy from a renewable source. Only if the use of solar thermal is maximized considering other low temperature heating purposes (for example domestic hot water or swimming pools heating) in addition to the air conditioning economic advantages can take place...|$|E

Significant part of energy consumption belongs to buildings such as residential, commercial, and office buildings. Many buildings are equipping with components {{that can be used for}} the participation in demand response programs.

This paper presents a real implementation of an optimization based SCADA system, which employs several controlling and monitoring methods in order to manage the consumption and generation of the building for decision support and participating in demand response events. Since the <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>devices</b> are suitable controllable appliances for direct load control demand response, and lighting system as flexible loads for reduction and curtailment, they can play a key role in the scope of demand response programs.

30|$|Variability {{and change}} of CDD, HDD and S from the {{beginning}} of the 19 th century to present can be used, alongside with the model proposed by Scapin et al. (Scapin et al. 2015), to get a rough estimation of how the present-time electricity demand would be if the climate were still in the situation prior to global warming. To this purpose, we apply this model keeping, on the one hand, the time-dependent term and the term accounting for the differences among the different days of the week as they are at present-time and considering, on the other hand, the secular CDD, HDD and S records we get from the corresponding high-resolution Tn, Tm, and Tx fields over the 1801 – 2013 period. In other words, we investigate what would happen in present-time conditions if the meteorological variables changed as they did in the past. The shortcoming of this approach is that present-time meteorology-electricity demand relationships are not completely independent from past climate variability and change as global warming may, e.g., have caused a wider diffusion of <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>devices.</b> We assume, however, that this dependence is weak and that meteorology-demand relationships are mainly influenced by socio-economic factors such as the time evolution of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The CDD, HDD and S secular records and the virtual electricity demand record we get using them in the model proposed by Scapin et al.

40|$|AbstractIn extreme climates {{like the}} desert climate of Northwest Mexico, indoor thermal {{conditions}} in buildings, {{and particularly in}} low-cost housing developments, are very uncomfortable. In buildings where the use of <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>devices</b> can be afford, excessive energy is spent, leading to high acclimatization costs. In many cases, construction materials for low-cost houses are selected according to the lowest price, and not {{taking into account the}} best thermal behavior according to the local climate. Different types of blocks are widely used as a construction material for walls, such us earth blocks, adobe, concrete hollow blocks, cellular blocks, bricks, because of their low price and easy installation. Designstrategies must be very carefully selected according to the local climate, because they have a great impact on energy consumptions and in {{the quality of life of}} the occupants. The selection of the appropriate materials for the envelope is part of these design strategies, and is the main subject of this paper. In this work we analyze the thermal behavior of a wall compound of two different materials: cellular concrete blocks and stabilized earth blocks. The monitored wall is part of a low-cost house constructed for demonstrative and experimental purposes. External and internal superficial temperatures have been measured and infrared images of the same areas have been analyzed. Infrared thermography is particularly useful to evaluate non-homogeneous materials or non-traditional materials, from which not all thermal properties are known.

40|$|Introduction Natural and {{artificial}} radionuclides {{are the main}} sources of human radiation exposure. These radionuclides, which {{are present in the}} environment, can be dissolved into water. Evidence suggests that radionuclides being entered the human body through drinking or hot spring water can be harmful for human health. Materials and Methods In this study, 10 samples were collected from ground water resources of Arak, one sample from the surface water of Kamal-Saleh Dam, and four samples from the hot springs of Mahallat region. The specific activities of 226 Ra, 232 Th, 40 K, and 137 Cs were determined in the samples, using gamma ray spectrometry and a high-purity germanium (HPGe) detector. Results Specific activities of 226 Ra, 232 Th, 40 K, and 137 Cs were determined in the water samples. The mean 226 Ra activity concentrations in drinking water samples from Aman Abad, Mobarak Abad, and Taramazd wells were 7. 65 ± 1. 64, 1. 56 ± 1. 04, and 1. 45 ± 1. 39 Bq/l, while the corresponding values for 232 Th were 2. 70 ± 0. 18, 0. 41 ± 0. 16, and 1. 27 ± 0. 44 Bq/l, respectively. The annual effective dose due to drinking water varied from 0. 01 to 0. 78 mSv/y. Moreover, the specific activity of 226 Ra in the water samples from the orifice of Donbe, Shafa, Soleymani, and Souda hot springs varied from 0. 47 ± 0. 16 to 1. 90 ± 0. 21. Conclusion The calculated annual effective dose due to water consumption by Iranians was within the average annual global range.

40|$|The {{exposure}} of workers to hot environments {{is expected to}} increase as a result of climate change. In order to prevent heat-related illness, it is recommended that workers take breaks during working hours. However, this would lead to reductions in worktime and labor productivity. In this study, we estimate the economic cost of heat-related illness prevention through worker breaks associated with climate change under a wide range of climatic and socioeconomic conditions. We calculate the worktime reduction based on the recommendation of work/rest ratio and the estimated future wet bulb glove temperature, which is an index of heat stresses. Corresponding GDP losses (cost of heat-related illness prevention through worker breaks) are estimated using a computable general equilibrium model throughout this century. Under the highest emission scenario, GDP losses in 2100 will range from 2. 6 to 4. 0 % compared to the current climate conditions. On the other hand, GDP losses will be less than 0. 5 % if the 2. 0 °C goal is achieved. The benefit of climate-change mitigation for avoiding worktime loss is comparable to the cost of mitigation (cost of the greenhouse gas emission reduction) under the 2. 0 °C goal. The relationship between the cost of heat-related illness prevention through worker breaks and global average temperature rise is approximately linear, and the difference in economic loss between the 1. 5 °C goal and the 2. 0 °C goal is expected to be approximately 0. 3 % of global GDP in 2100. Although climate mitigation and socioeconomic development can limit the vulnerable regions and sectors, particularly in developing countries, outdoor work is still expected to be affected. The effectiveness of some adaptation measures such as additional installation of <b>air</b> <b>conditioning</b> <b>devices</b> or shifting the time of day for working are also suggested.

For this reason the interest in technologies that can reduce the consumption of energy for heating or cooling houses is growing. In particular, the glazing of houses could offer great potential for energy saving as these elements of the building envelopment still have a margin for improvement. Currently, the research is focusing on stopping the heat exchange through radiative transfer. The problems of the current technologies {{are associated with the}} high costs and the colour they give to windows. Technologies using nanoparticles have started to emerge and have shown promise as methods for absorbing the radiation which passes through the glazing. Thanks to the unique control over their size and shape dependent properties, their absorbance can be moved to lower energy and this can satisfy both the requirements of stopping the heat carrying radiation and still providing a good illumination. Through the wide range of nanoparticle materials, sizes and shapes, silver triangular nanoprisms are a promising candidate for further research due to their strong absorption in the near infrared region. As their synthesis and the control over their geometrical properties are challenging using conventional batch-based macro reactor systems, a novel microreactor system was developed in this study in order to continuously produce silver triangular nanoprisms and monitoring their optical properties by mean of integrated spectroscopy techniques. By using sol-gel chemistry, the particles were coated with a shell of SiO 2 which can further be functionalised with various chemical functional groups such as thiol and allyl. Coated particles were then embedded in polymeric matrix (i. e. poly(methylmethacrylate), or PMMA) with covalent interactions between the polymer and the functional groups attached to the silica shell surface. Finally, the composite solutions were casted onto a glass-slide and the optical performance was evaluated using spectroscopic methodologies. Compared to similar composite materials, the systems herein reported offers several advantages, such as the low coloration in the visible spectrum and no risk of aggregation of the metal nuclei once they are dispersed in the polymer matrix.

The experimental results show that the temperature is not uniform along the radiator height because of the air flow non-uniformity. The internal flow field was numerically investigated and a variable fin pitch optimization method was {{presented to}} reduce the flow non-uniformity. The porous medium model was used to predict the radiator pressure drop. The simulation accuracy was verified by the experimental data. The numerical results show that the flow non-uniformity is greatly influenced by the fan diameter and height ratio and can be reduced by the variable fin pitch method. cf 201...|$|R

This family includes LMS,NLMS,LPB, [...] member out algorithms and many more some of these non-linear algorithms which provides better solution for non-linear noisy environment. The component of the(EANC) systems like Microphone and loud speaker Exhibit non linear ties themselves. The non-linear transfer function create worst situation. For example, Fxslms algorithms behaves well than the second order VfxLms algorithm is conditions of non-minimum phase and {{more important in the}} mean square error. If by any means it can be decided that, which particular algorithm will suit more to the problem, application, and give wonderful solution to solve the problem efficiently. This is a task which is some sort of prediction of suitable solution to the problems. The Redial Basis Function of Natural Networks (RBFNN) has been known to be suitable for non-linear function approximation. The classical approach RBF implementation is to be fix the number of hidden neurons based on some property of th...|$|R
