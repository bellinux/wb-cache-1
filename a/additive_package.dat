40|$|HCCI {{combustion}} {{is highly}} dependent on in-cylinder thermal conditions and the chemical kinetics of the fuel. In addition to the impact on auto-ignition, the fuel properties will also affect the accumulation of deposits on the combustion chamber walls, and this in turn alters the in-cylinder thermal environment. Because the fuels available at the pump differ considerably in composition, strategies intended to bring the HCCI to market must account for the interplay between the fuel chemical components, the HCCI combustion event, and the deposit accumulation in the engine. 	In an effort to quantify the impacts of fuel composition on HCCI combustion, a large test matrix of fuel blends was investigated in a single-cylinder HCCI engine with re-induction of residual. These fuels were blended from pure refinery streams {{in an effort to}} reproduce expected variations of pump gasoline, and were oxygenated with 10 % ethanol. The matrix has three dimensions, i. e. the fraction of Olefins (O), the fraction of Aromatics (A), and the Sensitivity (S), defined as the difference between the RON and MON (RON-MON). The impact of fuel composition on performance and thermal efficiency was investigated in a systematic way, such that the obvious impact of the lower heating value is compensated for. The effect of fuel composition and <b>additive</b> <b>packages</b> on HCCI combustion chamber deposit formation was investigated with a second set of refinery stream fuels. The equilibrium CCD thickness was shown to be on the order of 250 micrometers for a highly Aromatic fuel, which is three to five times more than {{in the case of a}} low-Aromatic fuel. The subsequent part of the deposit formation study considered two <b>additive</b> <b>packages,</b> namely polybutene amine (PBA) and polyether amine (PEA).

5000|$|The UV {{life of a}} part is {{dependent}} upon UV additive level and type as well as part thickness and design, pigment type, level and effectiveness of dispersion, processing conditions and the geographic location where the molded part is used (see Figure 3). It is important when comparing resin UV performanceto ensure that the testing {{has been done on}} a consistent basis. In Figure 1, accelerated weathering data is presented. Generally, 2,000 hours corresponds to 1 year in Florida and 1,400 hours to 1 year in Southern Canada. Often terms like “UV-8” are used. UV-8 means the material can withstand 8,000 hours in a Xenon Ci-65 weatherometer. UV-2 or UV-4 would mean 2,000 or 4,000 hours respectively. Hence, UV-8 corresponds to approximately 4 years of continuous outdoor exposure in Florida. It is important to understand which weatherometer, i.e. Carbon Arc or Xenon, was used, as well as the details of how the weatherometer was run. ASTM D-2565 is the recognized standard. Testing can be performed using actual outdoor weathering exposure, such as Florida and Arizona, to confirm this data. Note Figure 1 uses the industry standard criteria of when the sample has reached less than 50% of its original break elongation to determine the end of the test. In most cases useful life of the part extends beyond this point. All samples in Figure 1 are nonpigmented as supplied by Exxon Chemical. The UV performance test data can be found on our data sheets for each specific grade.Light Stability CharacteristicsUltraviolet (UV) Stabilization Plastics are attacked and deteriorate when exposed to direct sunlight. When plastic tanks absorb the sun’s ultraviolet light, the UV energy excites the polymers’chains, causing them to break. The effects are discoloration, embrittlement and eventual cracking. Elevated temperatures and oxygen tend to accelerate the deterioration. Tanks listed as suitable for outdoor service are protected from UV attack by: coloring or pigmenting and/or adding internal stabilizers which preferentially absorb or dissipate the UV energy. Shading tanks from the sun will also prevent deterioration. Tanks must be free to expand or contract, avoid excessive tension on the tank. For assistance in selecting the appropriate tank for a specific application, see the Tank Resin Selector Guides with reputable resin manufacturers.Resources being published by [...] siting additional references to AVENGENERAL ISOLINES OF GLOBAL RADIATION AND THERE EFFECTS ON POLYMERSYears = 70 x UV Rating (Your Location’s Isoline) (from Figure 3)Example: Natural Part, Molded Properly, Using UV-8 <b>Additive</b> <b>Package</b> For Use in Floridai.e.Florida= 140 Kcal/cm@2/yr.

Irrespective of the difference in oil type, failure on the surface was found to be entirely spalling attributable to cracks generated in the subsurface. The depth at which spalling cracks had taken place was found nearly coincident with the depth at which a ratio of reversing orthogonal shear stress to hardness had amplitude A(Tyz/Hv) maximized. These depths were larger as Hertz stress became more prominent. Nevertheless, they were found hardly affected by the type of oil.

The model is validated by model experiments and the results are in very good agreement, suggesting that the model is able to simulate wear having a predictive nature rather than on empirical-based relationships as Archard’s linear wear model.

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Compact light weight and dry sump (significantly reduced volume of lubricant) are the desired {{attributes}} for high performance racing transmissions, whilst improving upon efficiency and reliability remain paramount objectives. The complex multi-objective {{nature of this}} task points to an integrated approach to lubricant-mechanical system optimisation. The extreme operating conditions in racing transmissions, such as contact kinematics and thermal loading present significant tribological challenges. Thin lubricant films in non-Newtonian shear are subjected to mixed thermo-elastohydrodynamic regime of lubrication. Under these conditions boundary active lubricant species often determine the contact tribological performance rather than the bulk rheological properties of the lubricant itself. Therefore, the interaction of lubricant <b>additive</b> <b>package</b> with the contacting solid surfaces {{is the key to}} an optimised solution. The paper investigates the lubricant-surface interfacial effect upon frictional characteristics in contact conditions which are representative of gear teeth meshing conditions in high performance transmissions. The study uses pin-on-disc tribometry. As the contact conditions are mainly governed by the formation of surface-adhered tribo-films, their effect upon frictional characteristics is further investigated through use of atomic force microscopy (AFM) in lateral force mode (LFM).
