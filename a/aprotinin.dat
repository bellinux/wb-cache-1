25|$|There {{have been}} {{concerns}} {{about the safety of}} <b>aprotinin.</b> Anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction) occurs at a rate of 1:200 in first-time use, but serology (measuring antibodies against <b>aprotinin</b> in the blood) is not carried out in practice to predict anaphylaxis risk because the correct interpretation of these tests is difficult.|$|E
25|$|One {{scientific}} study in rats reported that treatment with <b>aprotinin</b> prevents {{disruption of the}} blood–brain barrier during the C. neoformans infection.|$|E
25|$|In {{cell biology}} <b>aprotinin</b> {{is used as}} an enzyme {{inhibitor}} to prevent protein degradation during lysis or homogenization of cells and tissues.|$|E
25|$|Small {{amounts of}} <b>aprotinin</b> {{can be added}} to tubes of drawn blood to enable {{laboratory}} measurement of certain rapidly degraded proteins such as glucagon.|$|E
25|$|No {{cases of}} bovine spongiform {{encephalopathy}} transmission by <b>aprotinin</b> have been reported, although the drug was withdrawn in Italy due to fears of this.|$|E
25|$|Two studies {{published}} in early 2008, both comparing <b>aprotinin</b> with aminocaproic acid, found that mortality was increased by 32 and 64%, respectively. One study found {{an increased risk}} in need for dialysis and revascularisation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Aprotinin</b> can be {{labelled}} with fluorescein isothiocyanate. The conjugate {{retains its}} antiproteolytic and carbohydrate-binding properties {{and has been}} used as a fluorescent histochemical reagent for staining glycoconjugates (mucosubstances) that are rich in uronic or sialic acids.|$|E
25|$|Tranexamic {{acid and}} aminocaproic acid inhibit fibrinolysis, {{and lead to}} a de facto reduced {{bleeding}} rate. Before its withdrawal, <b>aprotinin</b> was used in some forms of major surgery to decrease bleeding risk and need for blood products.|$|E
25|$|In {{cardiac surgery}} {{with a high}} risk of {{significant}} blood loss, <b>aprotinin</b> significantly reduced bleeding, mortality and hospital stay. Beneficial effects were also reported in high-risk orthopedic surgery. In liver transplantation, initial reports of benefit were overshadowed by concerns about toxicity.|$|E
25|$|<b>Aprotinin</b> is a {{competitive}} inhibitor of several serine proteases, specifically trypsin, chymotrypsin and plasmin at {{a concentration of}} about 125,000 IU/ml, and kallikrein at 300,000 IU/ml. Its action on kallikrein leads to the inhibition {{of the formation of}} factor XIIa. As a result, both the intrinsic pathway of coagulation and fibrinolysis are inhibited. Its action on plasmin independently slows fibrinolysis.|$|E
2500|$|The drug <b>aprotinin</b> (Trasylol, {{previously}} Bayer and now Nordic Group pharmaceuticals), is {{the small}} protein bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI), [...] or basic trypsin inhibitor of bovine pancreas an antifibrinolytic molecule that inhibits trypsin and related proteolytic enzymes. Under the trade name Trasylol, <b>aprotinin</b> {{was used as a}} medication administered by injection to reduce bleeding during complex surgery, such as heart and liver surgery. Its main effect is the slowing down of fibrinolysis, the process that leads to the breakdown of blood clots. The aim in its use was to decrease the need for blood transfusions during surgery, as well as end-organ damage due to hypotension (low blood pressure) as a result of marked blood loss. The drug was temporarily withdrawn worldwide in 2007 after studies suggested that its use increased the risk of complications or death; this was confirmed by follow-up studies. Trasylol sales were suspended in May 2008, except for very restricted research use. In February 2012 the European Medicines Agency (EMA) scientific committee reverted its previous standpoint regarding <b>aprotinin,</b> and has recommended that the suspension be lifted. Nordic became distributor of <b>aprotinin</b> in 2012.|$|E
2500|$|On October 25, 2007, the FDA {{issued a}} {{statement}} regarding the [...] "Blood conservation using antifibrinolytics" [...] (BART) randomized trial in a cardiac surgery population. The preliminary findings suggest that, compared to other antifibrinolytic drugs (epsilon-aminocaproic acid and tranexamic acid) <b>aprotinin</b> may {{increase the risk of}} death. [...] On October 29, 2006 the Food and Drug Administration issued a warning that <b>aprotinin</b> may have serious kidney and cardiovascular toxicity. The producer, Bayer, reported to the FDA that additional observation studies showed that it may increase the chance for death, serious kidney damage, congestive heart failure and strokes. FDA warned clinicians to consider limiting use to those situations where the clinical benefit of reduced blood loss is essential to medical management and outweighs the potential risks. On November 5, 2007, Bayer announced that it was withdrawing [...] <b>Aprotinin</b> because of a Canadian study that showed it increased the risk of death when used to prevent bleeding during heart surgery.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2006, Bayer A.G. was faulted by the FDA for not {{revealing}} during testimony {{the existence}} of a commissioned retrospective study of 67,000 patients, 30,000 of whom received <b>aprotinin</b> and the rest other anti-fibrinolytics. The study concluded <b>aprotinin</b> carried greater risks. The FDA was alerted to the study by one of the researchers involved. Although the FDA issued a statement of concern they did not change their recommendation that the drug may benefit certain subpopulations of patients. In a Public Health Advisory Update dated October 3, 2006, the FDA recommended that [...] "physicians consider limiting Trasylol use to those situations in which the clinical benefit of reduced blood loss is necessary to medical management and outweighs the potential risks" [...] and carefully monitor patients.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Aprotinin</b> is a monomeric (single-chain) {{globular}} polypeptide {{derived from}} bovine lung tissue. [...] It has a molecular weight of 6512 {{and consists of}} 16 different amino acid types arranged in a chain 58 residues long that folds into a stable, compact tertiary structure of the 'small SS-rich" [...] type, containing 3 disulfides, a twisted β-hairpin and a C-terminal α-helix.|$|E
2500|$|... test is an EXTEM based assay {{in which}} {{fibrinolysis}} is inhibited by <b>aprotinin</b> in the reagent. A significant {{improvement of the}} clot in APTEM compared to EXTEM allows to detect fulminant hyperfibrinolysis. Therefore, the test helps in identifying the necessity of administrating antifibrinolytic drugs. Furthermore, APTEM enables the estimation if an antifibrinolytic therapy alone normalizes coagulation or if additional measures {{have to be taken}} (e.g. administration of fibrinogen or platelets).|$|E
2500|$|Initially named [...] "kallikrein inactivator", <b>aprotinin</b> {{was first}} {{isolated}} from cow parotid glands in 1930. and independently as a trypsin inhibitor from bovine pancreas in 1936. It was purified from bovine lung in 1964. As it inhibits pancreatic enzymes, it was initially {{used in the}} treatment for acute pancreatitis, in which destruction of the gland by its own enzymes {{is thought to be}} part of the pathogenesis. Its use in major surgery commenced in the 1960s.|$|E
50|$|CU-2010 and CU-2020 are {{synthetic}} {{compounds that}} act as serine protease inhibitors. These were developed in 2010 to replace the use of <b>aprotinin</b> during and after cardiac surgery, including surgeries with cardiopulmonary bypass which cause blood loss and hemorrhagic complications. CU-2010 and CU-2020 were developed to avoid many issues {{associated with the use}} of <b>aprotinin,</b> including the risk of an allergic reaction and infection. Since the isolation of <b>aprotinin</b> is expensive, a drug with a simpler synthesis was desired.|$|E

50|$|Several {{proteins}} {{were brought}} to market as research and bioproduction reagents, mostly by Sigma-Aldrich.
