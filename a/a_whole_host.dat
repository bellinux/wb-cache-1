5000|$|Species whose broods are {{parasitised}} by {{the common}} cuckoo {{have evolved to}} discriminate against cuckoo eggs but not chicks. Experiments have shown that common cuckoo chicks persuade their host parents to feed them by making a rapid begging call that sounds [...] "remarkably like <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> brood of <b>host</b> chicks."

40|$|International audienceThis chapter {{deals with}} zero or {{implicit}} internal arguments of predicates which may take {{one or two}} internal arguments, realizable syntactically. It begins by distinguishing implicit (internal) arguments {{in terms of a}} predicate's semantic valency in relation to the syntactic valency of the verb or adjective corresponding to that predicate (§ 2), and continues with an attempt to distinguish three semantic or discourse-referential values assumable by null complements (§ 3). Section 4 then examines one of the three sub-types of null complement isolated in § 3 (the contextually-definite anaphoric subtype), in an attempt to make precise its anaphoric potential, as compared with that of unaccented 3 rd person personal pronouns. It is shown that this is a function of an interaction amongst the event-type designated by the clause as <b>a</b> <b>whole,</b> the <b>host</b> predicate's selection restrictions, the choice of zero vs. overt pronoun as complement, and wider contextual factors. Finally, section 5 examines the role of the <b>host</b> predication as <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> in the functioning of non-referential and anaphoric null complements, and attempts to arrive at certain generalisations licensing the possible occurrence of null complements bearing the three types of values isolated...|$|R

Among the diverse kinds of protein post translational modifications, phosphorylation plays essential roles in protein folding, protein:protein interactions, signal transduction, intracellular localization, transcription regulation, cell cycle progression, survival and apoptosis. Protein phosphorylation is also essential for many intracellular pathogens to establish a productive infection cycle. Preservation of protein phosphorylation moieties in pathogens {{in a manner that}} mirrors the host components underscores the co-evolutionary trajectory of pathogens and hosts, and sheds light on how successful pathogens have usurped, either in part or as <b>a</b> <b>whole,</b> the <b>host</b> enzymatic machinery.

40|$|Nitric oxide (NO) as an immunoregulatory molecule, {{predominantly}} {{depending on}} S-nitrosylation, {{acts as a}} versatile player that executes its regulation and signal transduction for exerting its multi-functions and pleiotropy. Apoptosis of immune cells is an intricate process coupled with positive/negative selection depending on integrated diverse endogenous and exogenous signals and functions to sustain homeostasis in the immune system. Here, the dual roles of NO depending on its concentration in apoptosis are reviewed, breeding up a switch mode in the apoptotic process. Following comments of different switches from apoptosis-death, a new finding of checkpoint (early fluorescence point) of GSNO-initiated thymocyte apoptosis and NOS-GSNOR double control are highlighted. Moreover, S-nitrosylation/denitrosylation, being as a redox switch, logically approaches to networks of metabolism itself and further accesses the neuroendicrine-immune-free radical network as <b>a</b> <b>whole.</b> Moreover, the <b>host</b> defense mediated by NO on pathogens, via protein S-nitrosylation are also discussed.

40|$|We present optical {{spectroscopy}} and optical/near-IR photometry of 31 host galaxies of hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe), including 15 {{events from}} the Pan-STARRS 1 Medium Deep Survey. Our sample spans the redshift range 0. 1 < z < 1. 6 {{and is the}} first comprehensive host galaxy study of this specific subclass of cosmic explosions. Combining the multi-band photometry and emission-line measurements, we determine the luminosities, stellar masses, star formation rates and metallicities. We find that as <b>a</b> <b>whole,</b> the <b>hosts</b> of SLSNe are a low-luminosity (~ - 17. 3 mag), low stellar mass (~ 2 x 10 ^ 8 M_sun) population, with a high median specific star formation rate (~ 2 Gyr^- 1). The median metallicity of our spectroscopic sample is low, 12 + log(O/H}) ~ 8. 35 ~ 0. 45 Z_sun, although at least one host galaxy has solar metallicity. The host galaxies of H-poor SLSNe are statistically distinct from the hosts of GOODS core-collapse SNe (which cover a similar redshift range), but resemble the host galaxies of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) in terms of stellar mass, SFR, sSFR and metallicity. This result indicates that the environmental causes leading to massive stars forming either SLSNe or LGRBs are similar, and in particular that SLSNe are more effectively formed in low metallicity environments. We speculate that the key ingredient is large core angular momentum, leading to a rapidly-spinning magnetar in SLSNe and an accreting black hole in LGRBs.
