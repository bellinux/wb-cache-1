25|$|In 1945, the {{specific}} heating {{effect of a}} high-power microwave beam was accidentally discovered by Percy Spencer, an American self-taught engineer from Howland, Maine. Employed by Raytheon at the time, he noticed that microwaves from an active radar set {{he was working on}} started to melt <b>a</b> <b>candy</b> <b>bar</b> he had in his pocket. The first food deliberately cooked with Spencer's microwave was popcorn, and the second was an egg, which exploded in the face of one of the experimenters. To verify his finding, Spencer created a high density electromagnetic field by feeding microwave power from a magnetron into a metal box from which it had no way to escape. When food was placed in the box with the microwave energy, the temperature of the food rose rapidly. On 8 October 1945, Raytheon filed a United States patent application for Spencer's microwave cooking process, and an oven that heated food using microwave energy from a magnetron was soon placed in a Boston restaurant for testing.|$|E

500|$|The Seven Up Bar was <b>a</b> <b>candy</b> <b>bar</b> {{comprising}} {{seven different}} chocolate [...] "pillows", each {{filled with a}} different flavor. [...] Flavors changed with the availability and popularity of ingredients, which included, among others, brazil nut, buttercream, butterscotch, caramel, cherry, coconut, fudge, mint, nougat and orange.

500|$|The {{original}} {{concept was}} <b>a</b> <b>candy</b> <b>bar</b> {{that would have}} three main components, a heavy texture, rich flavor, and a reasonable price; {{the combination of these}} qualities would ensure that it would be an easily marketable product. [...] It was later decided it should be appealing to as many demographic groups as possible, including children. [...] <b>A</b> <b>candy</b> <b>bar</b> was developed with a dark cocoa-flavored cookie pieces mixed with Japanese-style crisped rice, and finally coated with dark milk chocolate. [...] The cookie bar is pressed relatively flat on five sides; however, the top of the bar presents an uneven surface, even with the chocolate coating. [...] When it came to a name for the product, it was decided that the keyword should be the color [...] "black", which would allude to the dark chocolate flavor. [...] This is in keeping with other marketing trends in Japan, where the color [...] "black" [...] is associated with dark or bittersweet chocolate, such as the popular Meiji Black chocolate bar. [...] To give the product some [...] "impact" [...] with consumers, it was decided to name it after the Japanese god of thunder, Raijin. [...] Although the name of the product uses the English words [...] "Black Thunder" [...] (pronounced or transliterated as Burakku Sandah), the outer package also carries the Japanese kanji term for the product in a smaller font (...) , so that the meaning would not be lost on consumers. [...] An advertising slogan recorded from the development period translates to, [...] "Delicious taste like a flash of lightning!"

2500|$|Operant {{behavior}} {{is the so-called}} [...] "voluntary" [...] behavior that is sensitive to, or controlled by its consequences.
