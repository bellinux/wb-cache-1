40|$|Abstract: Cytokine {{behavior}} of T-lymphocytes {{is not very}} clear when a patient is co-infected with Leishmania donovani and HIV. To achieve this we studied groups of patients comprising of VL infected, HIV infected and HIV-VL co-infected cases. As compared to lone infections by either of the infecting agent, the co-infection cases showed greatly diminished CD 4 T-cell counts and slightly enhanced values of cytokines (IFN and IL 4). The effect of 63 KDa <b>antigenic</b> <b>fraction</b> of L. donovani, previously reported by our group as having potential immunoprophylaxis effects, was also studied for its effect on T-cell cytokine pattern in the co-infection cases. It was interesting to find that this <b>antigenic</b> <b>fraction</b> showed {{an increase in the}} proportion of CD 4 T-cells secreting IFN in both VL (alone) and HIV-VL co-infection groups...|$|E

40|$|<b>Antigenic</b> <b>fractions</b> of Coxiella burnetii phase {{variants}} {{were identified}} with an {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA). Immune sera from guinea pigs immunized with Formalin-inactivated phase I or phase II whole cells were {{used to measure the}} antigenic activity of whole cells and various soluble and particulate preparations. Phase-specific antigens of C. burnetii whole cells and fractions were compared by dose-response curves at different (antigen and antibody) dilutions. Water-soluble extracts prepared by meta-periodate, ether, and phenol extraction of phase I whole cells yielded <b>antigenic</b> <b>fractions</b> which reacted with anti-phase I antibodies. The extraction of phase I whole cells with dimethyl sulfoxide, trichloracetic acid, and Formalin yielded <b>antigenic</b> <b>fractions</b> which detected antibodies in both anti-phase I and -phase II sera. Interestingly, the trichloracetic acid extract of phase I whole cells also contained a component which bound nonimmune immunoglobulin. The sera of animals immunized with whole cells of the phase II Australian QD strain reacted with lipopolysaccharides of the phase I and phase II Nine Mile strains. Therefore, variations in lipopolysaccharide structure among phase variants of C. burnetii were detected as cross-reactions with immune sera from an interspecific strain. Comparisons of immunofluorescence, microagglutination, and the complement fixation assays with the ELISA indicated greater sensitivity and specificity of the ELISA for the measurement of phase-specific antigens and antibodies...|$|R
40|$|Introduction & Objective: Fusariosis {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} systemic mycosis, often caused by Fusarium Solani and resist to antifungal drugs. The appropriate F. Solani antigen preparation could be useful in serodiagnosis of fusariosis. Materials & Methods : The extraction procedure was preformed using F. Solani strain 7419 UAMH. The antigenic extract was obtained through grinding of fungal mass yielding from broth culture medium. Results : Following fractionation of somatic antigen, two different component, that is, crude antigen as well as <b>antigenic</b> <b>fractions</b> (12, 28) were collected. The <b>antigenic</b> <b>fractions</b> in comparison with the crude antigen, demonstrated more effective antibody responses using ELISA method.

40|$|A complex {{antigenic}} preparation {{obtained from}} Listeria monocytogenes serovariant 4 b by freeze-pressing, centrifugation, and gel filtration treatment was studied by crossed immunoelectrophoresis, {{with the aim}} of preparing an <b>antigenic</b> <b>fraction</b> {{that could be used to}} investigate the serological response to listeric infection. Of 17 immunoprecipitates revealed in the soluble extract, one of three major antigens (designated antigen 2) was shown to be a strong antigen in humans or rabbits infected with L. monocytogenes serovariant 4 b. A monospecific antiantigen 2 serum was obtained and used to prepare a serologically homogeneous antigen by immunoadsorption. Antigen 2, most probably located on the bacterial surface, is common to all serovariants of L. monocytogenes and to Listeria grayi and is not shared by the main bacterial species known to have common antigens with L. monocytogenes.

40|$|A biochemically and immunologically {{homogeneous}} <b>antigenic</b> <b>fraction</b> {{having the}} properties of a lipopolysaccharide has been isolated from the culture supernatant of an El Tor vibrio (Ogawa subtype). This antigen was very specifically protective for mice challenged with Ogawa strains of either El Tor vibrios or Vibrio cholerae. Rabbit antisera prepared against the antigen were passively protective for mice and highly vibriocidal but had little agglutinating activity. However, the antigen was able specifically to absorb agglutinins, as well as mouse-protective and vibriocidal antibody from serum prepared against whole bacterial cells. The specific protective activity of this lipopolysaccharide was much {{greater than that of}} vaccines made from whole bacterial cells, and its toxicity in animals was about equivalent to that of whole cells.

40|$|The {{existence}} of an anaphylactic mechanism favouring the deposition of circulating immune complexes in Heymann's nephritis and its possible inhibition by disodium cromoglycate (DSCG) and antihistamines was studied. No animal produced anti-renal tubular anaphylactic antibodies (IgE and IgGa classes) and no histamine and PAF (platelet-activating factor) release were obtained when buffy coat cells (BCC) were challenged with the soluble Fx 1 A <b>antigenic</b> <b>fraction.</b> However, PAF was obtained from phagocytozing leucocytes. Total histamine after boiling 10 (7) BCC was less than 20 ng. The frequency of nephritis and quantity of immune deposits in {{the glomerular basement membrane}} were similar in treated and control groups. Our results show that, contrary to the data obtained in acute serum sickness of rabbits, an anaphylactic mechanism in Heymann's nephritis does not seem to exist. Accordingly the treatment with antihistamines and/or disodium cromoglycate did not produce any beneficial effect upon the course of the disease...|$|E
40|$|Melioidosis {{is caused}} by the Gram-negative {{bacterium}} Burkholderia pseudomallei. The gold standard for diagnosis is culture, which requires at least 3 – 4 days to obtain a result, hindering successful treatment of acute disease. An indirect haemagglutination assay (IHA) is often used but lacks sensitivity. Approximately half of patients later confirmed culture positive are not detected by IHA at presentation and a subset of patients persistently continue to be IHA negative. More rapid and reliable serologic testing for melioidosis is essential and will improve diagnosis and patient outcome. We have developed an ELISA and a quantitative immuno-polymerase chain reaction assay capable of detecting melioidosis-specific antibodies and demonstrate their validity with IHA-negative sera from patients with melioidosis. These new sensitive assays are based upon a secreted <b>antigenic</b> <b>fraction</b> from B. pseudomallei and will be ideal for the diagnosis of melioidosis in patients in nonendemic regions returning from endemic tropical areas and for seroepidemiologic surveys...|$|E
40|$|Our {{prior studies}} {{demonstrated}} that cellular response of T helper 1 (Th 1) type was {{generated by a}} soluble <b>antigenic</b> <b>fraction</b> (ranging from 89. 9 – 97. 1 kDa) of Leishmania donovani promastigote, in treated Leishmania patients as well as hamsters and showed significant prophylactic potential against experimental visceral leishmaniasis (VL). Eighteen Th 1 stimulatory proteins were identified through proteomic analysis of this subfraction, out of which fifteen were developed as recombinant proteins. In the present work, we have evaluated these fifteen recombinant proteins simultaneously for their comparative cellular responses in treated Leishmania patients and hamsters. Six proteins viz. elongation factor- 2, enolase, aldolase, triose phosphate isomerase, protein disulfide isomerase and p 45 emerged as most immunogenic as they produced a significant lymphoproliferative response, nitric oxide generation and Th 1 cytokine response in PBMCs of treated patients and lymphocytes of treated hamsters.

All appeared to be lipopolysaccharides. The CWT antigens, as compared with purified protein derivatives (human), were relatively species (group) -specific in both double immunodiffusion and guinea pig skin tests; in the latter, the reactions resembled those of delayed hypersensitivity. The C antigens reacted heterologously in double immunodiffusion and skin tests; the latter were the “immediate” type of reaction...|$|R

There are {{numerous}} reports and hospital-based studies from Kashmir, North India, yet {{there has been no}} epidemiological study conducted in Kashmir, the apparently endemic area for human hydatidosis. This study was designed to determine the seroprevalence of hydatid infection in Kashmir Valley and to find out association of risk factors for acquisition of this infection. Fourteen hundred and twenty-nine samples were collected from different districts in the Kashmir region (North India) using systematic random sampling. The 130 control samples included were from apparently healthy blood donors (100), patients with other parasitic infections (20), surgically confirmed hydatidosis patients (5), and apparently healthy subjects excluded for hydatidosis and intestinal parasitic infections (5). Hydatid-specific IgG antibody was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and seropositive samples were analysed further by Western blotting. Out of 1, 429 samples, 72 (5. 03 %) were IgG positive by ELISA. The percentage occurrence of the highly immunoreactive <b>antigenic</b> <b>fractions</b> in IgG ELISA positive samples was 57 kDa (72. 2 %) followed by 70 kDa (66. 7 %) and 39 kDa (58. 3 %) by immunoblotting.

These results suggest that T. spiralis was not part of helminthological fauna in these rodents...|$|R
40|$|The fine {{specificity}} of the {{cellular immune response}} to Candida albicans (i. e., recognition of different antigenic components) between normal controls and human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients {{in various stages of}} disease was compared. C. albicans-specific T cells, enriched by antigen stimulation and interleukin- 2 expansion, were challenged with <b>antigenic</b> <b>fractions</b> of different molecular weight obtained by SDS-gel fractionation of C. albicans extracts in the presence of autologous mononuclear cells as antigen-presenting cells. Proliferative responses showed similar patterns of reactivity between controls and category A and B seropositive subjects. Category C patients with concurrent C. albicans infections did not give rise to C. albicans-specific T cell lines, confirming the T cell defect. Patients without clinically evident C. albicans infection had a low but broad reactivity pattern of C. albicans-specific T cells. These results suggest that depletion of C. albicans-specific T cells, independent of their fine specificity, occurs along with disease progression...|$|R
