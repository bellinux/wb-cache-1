500|$|When Blacker {{became aware}} of the {{existence}} of hollow-charge ammunition, he realized that it was exactly the kind of ammunition he was looking for to develop a hand-held anti-tank weapon, as it depended upon the energy contained within itself, and not the sheer velocity at which it was fired. Blacker then developed a hollow-charge bomb with a propellant charge in its tail, which fitted into a shoulder-fired launcher that consisted of <b>a</b> <b>metal</b> <b>casing</b> containing a large spring and a spigot; the bomb was placed into a trough {{at the front of the}} casing, and when the trigger was pulled the spigot rammed into the tail of the bomb and fired it out of the casing and up to approximately [...] away. Blacker called the weapon the 'Baby Bombard', and presented it to the War Office in 1941. However, when the weapon was tested it proved to have a host of problems; a War Office report of June 1941 stated that the casing was flimsy and the spigot itself did not always fire when the trigger was pulled, and none of the bombs provided exploded upon contact with the target.|$|E
50|$|In 1920, Clarke at twenty-three {{obtained}} a patent for <b>a</b> <b>metal</b> <b>casing</b> {{used in the}} oil industry.|$|E
5000|$|The device {{consists}} of <b>a</b> <b>metal</b> <b>casing</b> {{and at least}} two radiocontrolled clocks. It can stamp time cards in various formats.|$|E
50|$|A paila criolla is a Cuban membranophone. It {{consists}} of <b>a</b> shallow <b>metal</b> <b>casing</b> or paila (cookware of Catalan origin; in Catalan language {{it is called}} paella), with a single-headed drum.|$|R
5000|$|The LG-GD910 is {{constructed}} using <b>a</b> waterproof, <b>metal</b> <b>casing</b> and has <b>a</b> curved, tempered glass face. It is 13.9 mm thick. The touchscreen is 1.43-inches (3.63 cm) across, 352 x 288 pixels, and uses LG’s Flash interface.|$|R
50|$|The adaptor {{took the}} form of a {{reducing}} bore that was screwed on {{to the end of the}} gun. This was coupled with a round formed from a hard core (tungsten) inside <b>a</b> softer <b>metal</b> <b>casing</b> - the armour-piercing, composite non-rigid (APCNR) design.|$|R
50|$|Because the TM-46 has <b>a</b> <b>metal</b> <b>casing,</b> it is {{very easy}} to detect with a mine-detector. However, mine-fields {{containing}} TM-46s may have also been sown with minimum metal mines, e.g. the PMA-2.|$|E
50|$|All the models, {{from this}} one on, have <b>a</b> <b>metal</b> <b>casing,</b> but the model A has a {{polished}} glass panel for the output display in the front. This model is produced from 1904 to 1906.|$|E
50|$|When a {{verified}} YouTuber {{reaches a}} specific milestone, they are awarded a relatively flat trophy in <b>a</b> <b>metal</b> <b>casing</b> with a YouTube play button symbol. The trophies are of different sizes: each button and plaque get progressively bigger the more subscribers the channel gets.|$|E
5000|$|Prior to 1910, a shell, made of {{dynamite}} and <b>a</b> sheet <b>metal</b> <b>casing</b> were lowered into a well and detonated by a blasting cap with a fuse. [...] By 1918, the practice had evolved to use blasting gelatin, {{a mixture of}} nitroglycerin, guncotton and wood pulp.|$|R
5000|$|The {{insulator}} had <b>a</b> thick <b>metal</b> <b>casing</b> around blown glass; {{the assembly}} was {{held together with}} molten sulfur. Out of the tube extends a [...] "ramshorn" [...] rod that held the telegraph wires. It was mounted into holes drilled {{into the bottom of}} wooden crossarms attached to poles.|$|R
5000|$|The Teller {{mine was}} a German-made antitank mine common in World War II. With {{explosives}} sealed inside <b>a</b> sheet <b>metal</b> <b>casing</b> and {{fitted with a}} pressure-actuated fuze, Teller mines had a built-in carrying handle on the side. As the name suggests (Teller is the German word for dish or plate) the mines were plate-shaped.|$|R
5000|$|Raising {{the plume}} - placing <b>a</b> <b>metal</b> <b>casing</b> 30 to 40 feet {{high over the}} well head (thus raising the flame above the ground). Liquid {{nitrogen}} or water is then forced in at the bottom to reduce the oxygen supply and put out the fire.|$|E
50|$|The mousehole is {{the storage}} area on a {{drilling}} rig {{where the next}} joint of drilling pipe is held until needed. This hole is in {{the floor of the}} rig, bored into the earth for a short way, and usually lined with <b>a</b> <b>metal</b> <b>casing</b> known as a scabbard.|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} of the construction contains a London Underground electrical substation for the Northern line and Bakerloo line (somewhat appropriate for a memorial {{to one of the}} great pioneers of electricity). Rodney Gordon originally designed the box clad in glass, intending the workings of the transformer to be seen. The possibility of vandalism prevented this, so the design was changed to <b>a</b> <b>metal</b> <b>casing.</b>|$|E
50|$|The basic {{requirement}} {{is that no}} single failure can result in dangerous voltage becoming exposed so that it might cause an electric shock {{and that this is}} achieved without relying on <b>an</b> earthed <b>metal</b> <b>casing.</b> This is usually achieved at least in part by having at least two layers of insulating material between live parts and the user, or by using reinforced insulation.|$|R
50|$|The PocketZip {{media is}} a small, {{flexible}} disk inside of <b>a</b> thin <b>metal</b> <b>casing,</b> {{similar to that}} found on the shutter of a standard floppy disk. The disks usually came in small format-specific plastic cases, and the drive was also shipped for a while with <b>a</b> small hard <b>metal</b> case which could house the drive and two disks. The disks could be bent easily if too much force was applied, thereby completely damaging them.|$|R
5000|$|General-purpose (GP) bombs use <b>a</b> {{thick-walled}} <b>metal</b> <b>casing</b> with explosive filler (typically TNT, Composition B, or Tritonal in NATO or United States service) composing about 30% to 40% of the bomb's total weight. The British {{term for}} a bomb of this type is [...] "medium case" [...] or [...] "medium capacity" [...] (MC). The GP bomb is a common weapon of fighter bomber and attack aircraft because it is useful {{for a variety of}} tactical applications and relatively cheap.|$|R
50|$|There are no {{surviving}} J70 trams; a replica, {{based at}} the East Anglian Railway Museum, is a diesel-hydraulic 0-4-0 shunter with <b>a</b> <b>metal</b> <b>casing</b> over it. When this diesel was converted a replica Henrietta was built from scratch. The underframe was taken from an old box van, but the body was a complete new build. Toby and Henrietta can be seen running on the Museum's Day out with Thomas events.|$|E
50|$|The bomb {{consists}} of <b>a</b> <b>metal</b> <b>casing</b> {{with a wooden}} throwing handle. On {{the upper part of}} the casing there is a tab for removing the safety pin, and a small metal strip protruding from the base of the handle. The strip is a second safety precaution.The metal strip is held in position by the wire on the side of the handle. This wire is held in position by a piece of wired tape secured by a pin.|$|E
50|$|Some Typex rotors came in two parts—a slug {{containing}} the wiring was inserted into <b>a</b> <b>metal</b> <b>casing.</b> Different casings contained different numbers of notches around the rim, such as 5, 7 or 9 notches. Each slug could be inserted into a casing {{in two different}} ways by turning it over. In use, all the rotors of the machine would use casings with {{the same number of}} notches. Normally five slugs were chosen from a set of ten. On a Typex rotor, each electrical contact was doubled to improve reliability.|$|E
50|$|When the Soviets left Naissaar {{in early}} 1993, they burned the {{explosives}} in the naval mines, leaving <b>a</b> multitude of <b>metal</b> <b>casings</b> {{scattered throughout the}} island. Many of these were scavenged as scrap iron, but a field of mines is still visible near the wharf at Mädasadam. Another legacy of the arms industry is that the soil of the island remains contaminated by oil and heavy metals.|$|R
50|$|The {{starting}} handle {{passes through a}} water tank {{at the front of}} the car. The radiator is fixed immediately above this tank. Its sides are of ribbed aluminium castings connected by finned tubes run horizontally across the front of the car. The ribbed aluminium castings inspired Daimler's flutes. The water circulating centrifugal pump is driven by a friction wheel pressing against the flywheel. Two pressure lubricators feed the pump's bearings. The design ensures natural circulation would continue if the pump were out of order. There is <b>a</b> sheet <b>metal</b> <b>casing</b> beneath the engine as a dust-shield.|$|R
500|$|At about 10:30pm, just as Fielden was {{finishing}} his speech, police arrived en masse, marching in formation towards the speakers' wagon, {{and ordered the}} rally to disperse. Fielden insisted that the meeting was peaceful. Police Inspector John Bonfield proclaimed:I command you [...] {{in the name of}} the law to desist and you [...] to disperse. A home-made bomb with <b>a</b> brittle <b>metal</b> <b>casing</b> filled with dynamite and ignited by a fuse was thrown into the path of the advancing police. Its fuse briefly sputtered, and then the bomb exploded, killing policeman Mathias J. Degan with flying metal fragments and mortally wounding six other officers.|$|R
50|$|Sting grenades, {{also known}} as stingball or sting ball grenades, are stun grenades based {{on the design of}} the {{fragmentation}} grenade. Instead of using <b>a</b> <b>metal</b> <b>casing</b> to produce shrapnel, they are made from hard rubber and are filled with around 100 rubber balls. On detonation, the rubber balls, and shrapnel from the rubber casing, explode outward in all directions as a form of less-lethal shrapnel. These projectiles may ricochet. It is intended that people struck by the projectiles will receive a series of fast, painful stings, without serious injury. Some types have an additional payload of CS gas.|$|E
5000|$|Korg {{unveiled}} the Kaossilator Pro at NAMM on 14 January 2010. [...] The device has <b>a</b> <b>metal</b> <b>casing</b> {{similar to the}} Kaoss Pad 3 (KP3), but its touchpad (divided into an 8x8 grid of rectangles) is back-lit with green lights instead of the KP3's red lights. [...] The larger pad {{makes it easier to}} hit specific notes compared to the original Kaossilator. It offers 200 sounds, vocoder patches, four channels of looping, MIDI, a gate arpeggiator, 31 scales, editor software, and other features. Unlike the original Kaossilator, it allows music-loops and settings to be saved on an SD memory card.|$|E
5000|$|TS5: The plastic TS5 [...] "Soundtank" [...] {{followed}} the TS10 and was available until 1999. The TS5 circuit {{is very similar}} to the TS9; however, it was made for Ibanez in Taiwan by Daphon. The first year of production had <b>a</b> <b>metal</b> <b>casing,</b> afterwards the casing was made out of plastic (which resulted in more noise than a typical TS808/TS9 box made out of metal). However, these plastic versions still have a shielded and grounded metal bottom plate for a slight interference reduction plus the needed weight to keep the pedal from sliding because of its light weight.|$|E
25|$|In 1997 the lithium polymer battery was {{released}} by Sony and Asahi Kasei. These batteries hold their electrolyte in a solid polymer composite instead of in a liquid solvent, and the electrodes and separators are laminated to each other. The latter difference allows the battery to be encased in a flexible wrapping instead of in <b>a</b> rigid <b>metal</b> <b>casing,</b> which means such batteries can be specifically shaped to fit a particular device. This advantage has favored lithium polymer batteries {{in the design of}} portable electronic devices such as mobile phones and personal digital assistants, and of radio-controlled aircraft, as such batteries allow for more flexible and compact design. They generally have a lower energy density than normal lithium-ion batteries.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of Photograph of {{male and}} female workers {{handling}} cases of electronic equipment and wiring, ca. 1960. At center, a long table can be seen extending from the foreground into the background. Six individuals can be seen sitting along this table on small raised stools with backing. In front of each individual <b>a</b> rectangular <b>metal</b> <b>casing</b> can be seen. Several wires and electronic components are visible within the casings. Several of the workers can be seen using tools to alter the wires and equipment. Along the table between the workers, metallic containers holding wiring can be seen. In the background on the right, several of these containers can been arranged into a free-standing shelf along the table. Behind the <b>metal</b> <b>casings</b> in the next row, several rectangular devices with small ports on one side can be seen. Further in the background, numerous long desks seating several employees can be seen. In the extreme background, long wires are visible hanging from the ceiling down to the workstations near many of the desks...|$|R
2500|$|Every shell {{used by the}} K 39 weighed [...] The {{original}} Czech 21cm Gr 39 (t) high-explosive shell {{had both}} nose and base fuzes and a filling of [...] of TNT. The German equivalent, the 21cm Gr 40 lacked the base fuze, had a copper driving band well forward on the shell and was fitted with <b>a</b> thin <b>metal</b> <b>casing</b> behind the driving band filled with a graphite mixture intended as a bore lubricant and to reduce wear. The 21cm Gr 39 Be was a Czech-designed anti-concrete shell fitted with a base fuze, a ballistic cap and the additive sleeve. It was filled with [...] of TNT. There was also an armor-piercing, base-fuzed shell, the 21cm Pzgr 39 of which little is known other than it had a filling of [...] of a PETN/wax mixture.|$|R
5000|$|Crates {{marked with}} a [...] "C" [...] are checkpoints that Crash will return to if he is killed during play. Locked Crates are {{protected}} by <b>a</b> <b>metal</b> <b>casing</b> {{that can only be}} destroyed with Crash's body slam move, while Spring Crates allow him to reach high up areas by bouncing on them. Slot Boxes rapidly switch between multiple types of crates, and if they are not broken in time, will become metallic and indestructible. Time Boxes are a special crate found exclusively in Time Trial mode. They will freeze the clock for the number of seconds displayed on the box, increasing the player's chance of beating the time trial.|$|E

50|$|Every shell {{used by the}} K 39 weighed 135 kg. The {{original}} Czech 21 cm Gr 39 (t) high-explosive shell {{had both}} nose and base fuzes and a filling of 18.8 kg of TNT. The German equivalent, the 21 cm Gr 40 lacked the base fuze, had a copper driving band well forward on the shell and was fitted with <b>a</b> thin <b>metal</b> <b>casing</b> behind the driving band filled with a graphite mixture intended as a bore lubricant and to reduce wear. The 21 cm Gr 39 Be was a Czech-designed anti-concrete shell fitted with a base fuze, a ballistic cap and the additive sleeve. It was filled with 8.1 kg of TNT. There was also an armor-piercing, base-fuzed shell, the 21 cm Pzgr 39 of which little is known other than it had a filling of 2.8 kg of a PETN/wax mixture.|$|R
50|$|Upon {{detonation}} of the explosive, {{the casing}} disintegrates into extremely small particles, {{as opposed to}} larger pieces of shrapnel which results from the fragmentation of <b>a</b> <b>metal</b> shell <b>casing.</b> The HMTA powder acts like micro-shrapnel which is very lethal at close range (about 4 meters or 13 feet), but loses momentum very quickly due to air resistance, coming to a halt within approximately 40 times {{the diameter of the}} charge. This increases the probability of killing people within a few meters of the explosion while reducing the probability of causing death and injuries or damage farther away. Survivors close to the lethal zone may still have their limbs amputated by the HMTA microshrapnel, which can slice through soft tissue and bone.|$|R
50|$|A napkin holder is {{a device}} {{used to hold}} napkins. A napkin holder {{can be made from}} {{virtually}} any solid material and is built so that the napkins do not slip from its hold, either by way of sandwiching them between two surfaces, or simply enclosing them on their sides in a horizontal design. Napkin holders range in price and styles from wooden designs to wrought iron or ceramic styles and many others. One iteration of the napkin holder, better known as a napkin dispenser, offers additional functionality with its design: folded napkins are enclosed in <b>a</b> snug <b>metal</b> <b>casing,</b> allowing users to retrieve a single napkin each time they reach into the container; this particular device is usually found in restaurants, diners, and other public eateries, while its simpler - often more aesthetically pleasing - counterpart, the holder, is common to households and classrooms.|$|R
