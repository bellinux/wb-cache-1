25|$|In {{the last}} entry {{of the journal}} from 26–27 October 1744, Swedenborg appears to be clear as to which path to follow. He felt that he should drop his current project and write <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>book</b> <b>about</b> the worship of God. He soon began working on De cultu et amore Dei, or The Worship and Love of God. It was never fully completed, but Swedenborg still had it {{published}} in London in June 1745.|$|E

500|$|In June 1929 Marquis {{was putting}} {{together}} <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>book</b> <b>about</b> William H. White, Custer, Cavalry & Crows, which involved more interviews. He found a publisher in April 1930, the Midwest Company of Minneapolis, but the publication date {{was not until}} spring, 1931, and Marquis would not receive royalties until a year after publication, so money continued to be tight. [...] Upset, Marquis retired to a cabin in Laurel. Better news came in August 1930. The Midwest Company accepted A Warrior Who Fought Custer for publication. They wished to publish it in the spring instead of Custer, Cavalry & Crows, whose publication would be delayed until a later date. Although the latter was now delayed for a second time, both books were certain to be published. In the meantime, Marquis, perpetually short of funds, moved to a small cabin on the property of his brother, Addie Marquis, in Bozeman. Here he spent some of his time setting type at a printing shop that employed his cousin, Nige Garrison, to whom he owed money.|$|E
2500|$|Appreciation of {{fattened goose}} liver spread to gastronomes outside the Jewish community, who could buy {{in the local}} Jewish ghetto of their cities. In 1570, Bartolomeo Scappi, chef de cuisine to Pope Pius V, {{published}} his cookbook Opera, wherein he describes that [...] "the liver of [...] domestic goose raised by the Jews is of extreme size and weighs [...] two and three pounds." [...] In 1581, Marx Rumpolt of Mainz, chef to several German nobles, published the massive cookbook Ein Neu Kochbuch, describing that the Jews of Bohemia produced livers weighing more than three pounds; he lists recipes for it—including one for goose liver mousse. János Keszei, chef {{to the court of}} Michael Apafi, the prince of Transylvania, included foie gras recipes in his 1680 cookbook <b>A</b> <b>New</b> <b>Book</b> <b>About</b> Cooking, instructing cooks to [...] "envelop the goose liver in a calf's thin skin, bake it and prepare [...] green or [...] brown sauce to accompany it. I used goose liver fattened by Bohemian Jews, its weight was more than three pounds. You may also prepare a mush of it." ...|$|E

50|$|After {{his death}} in 1959, Budde’s poems were {{published}} under the title; ‘ne gapse vol’ (a handful). They were republished at {{the celebration of the}} 110th anniversary of his birth in August 1999. His poems are still recited at the various tourist and local activities in Ootmarsum, and there is seldom <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>book</b> published <b>about</b> this historic town without a mention of his name, a line or the full text of one of his poems. Together with like-minded people in town he formed a core group that kept alive important traditions such as vloggelen at Easter (a procession of people holding hands and singing two religious traditional Eastern songs while walking through town through farm house and certain buildings) during, for example, the difficult times of war.|$|R

The cabaret-style tour throughout North America, Europe and Australia, known as The Short Attention Span Theatre, featured an unpredictable opening act—three Djs (Kid Koala, P-Love, and DJ Jester the Filipino Fist) on eight turntables set up like a band, and a bingo game at intermission among other quirky surprises. Following this tour Kid Koala has performed DJ sets in Asia, as well as in Iceland, Eastern Europe, Russia, and South America whilst working on <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>book</b> (apparently <b>about</b> <b>a</b> mosquito trying to play a clarinet) and a puppet show set to take place in 2008.|$|R
2500|$|At 17:30 of {{the same}} day, Grandi went to Palazzo Venezia; the {{official}} reason was the presentation to Mussolini of <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>book</b> <b>about</b> the Italian participation in the non-intervention committee in Spain. The meeting was scheduled to last 15 minutes, {{but at the end}} it was prolonged until 18:45. Waiting to be received by the Duce were the Chief of Police and the German Feldmarschall Kesselring. In his memoirs written one year later, Mussolini denied that he spoke with Grandi about the OdG, but this is not credible. It is apparent that Grandi, who loved the Duce, explained to him the consequences of his OdG, giving him a last chance to save face and resign before the vote. In that case, the Grand Council’s meeting would have been superfluous. Mussolini listened while Grandi was explaining the necessity to resign to avoid a catastrophe, but at the end rebuked him saying that his conclusions were wrong, since Germany was about to produce a decisive secret weapon. After that, Mussolini met Kesselring and the Chief of Police, Chierici: to the latter he confided {{that it would have been}} easy to bring Grandi, Bottai and Ciano back to the fold, as they were eager to be persuaded by him. On the morning of 23 July Mussolini accepted the resignation of Cini: this was supposed to be a signal to his opponents. At the same time, at Federzoni's home, Grandi, Federzoni, de Marsico (one of the best jurists in Italy), Bottai and Ciano modified the OdG, removing the interpretative introduction which explained the functions of the Grand Council. Here they demonstrated that the assembly had the constitutional power to remove Mussolini. In fact, according to the constitutionalists, the [...] "Leggi Fascistissime" [...] of December 1925 bent the Constitution, but did not break it. Because of these laws, the Duce ruled the country on behalf of the King, who remained always the source of the executive power. Because of that, if the Grand Council, which was the trait d'union between Fascism and the state, passed a vote of no confidence on the dictator, the King would have been entitled to remove him and nominate his successor. In that occasion Ciano was acquainted with the OdG by Bottai: Grandi was reluctant to accept him, since he was the son-in-law of Mussolini and was known for his superficial and inconstant character, but Ciano insisted, unaware that this decision would have provoked his death six months later in Verona. After that, Grandi had as a guest at his office in the parliament Farinacci, showing him his OdG. Farinacci told Grandi that he accepted the first part of the document, but that he did not agree at all on the rest: the military powers had to be given to the Germans, and Italy should start to fight the war seriously, getting rid of Mussolini and the generals. At the end he, like Scorza, asked him for a copy of his OdG, and like Scorza he used it to produce another OdG of his own. In the time left before the meeting, Grandi contacted other participants asking them to join his action.|$|E

40|$|Ms. Adana ends music {{time with}} the last verse of “Oh, Johnny ” with her group of preschool-age {{children}} and says, “Today we have some special choices in the interest areas.

Ms. Adana bends down to him and says, “We need to figure out what you would like to do today. Would you like to listen to the tape or play in the house corner?” As she speaks, she turns him toward each choice. She takes his hand and he begins to walk to the house corner. She goes with him to the area and reminds him to tell the other children he would like to join in. He points to a doll and says, “Baby. ” Jessica, another child in the group, says “You can be the daddy and I’ll be the mommy,” and the play begins. LaTayna walks to the collage table, but all four chairs are filled. She announces, “I want to make one too! ” Her classmate, Don, says “There’s no room.

5000|$|While García {{spent over}} 30 years wrestling as [...] "Huracán Ramírez" [...] {{and had become}} synonymous with the {{character}} he did not actually hold {{the rights to the}} name, thus was not able to personally pass the character on to a second generation [...] "Huracán Ramírez" [...] in the way Santo had passed his legacy on to his son El Hijo del Santo and Blue Demon passed his name on to adopted son Blue Demon, Jr. The rights to the name was at the time owned by Jose Rodriguez Mas, son of the producer of the original Huracán Ramírez movie. At the time García and Mas were close friends, so close that García initially offered his services for <b>a</b> <b>new</b> photo-montage-style comic <b>book</b> <b>about</b> Huracán Ramírez for free in exchange for an eventual share of the profits. When the comic book became a big success, García approached Rodriguez Mas for a share of the profits, but his request was denied. After a heated argument Rodriguez Mas threatened to take the Huracán Ramírez character away from García. Unhappy with the situation and the threat García actually unmasked during a couple of local shows, something that was virtually unheard of in Lucha Libre, an active competitor unmasking voluntarily. The move did not convince Rodriguez Mas to share the profits with García, in fact he stated that he wanted a younger wrestler to take over the [...] "Huracán Ramírez" [...] character. The threat prompted García to take action the very next night. During a show García walked to the ring, removed the mask and showed the fans in the audience and the photographers at ringside his face and revealing his name. The move ensured that the name [...] "Huracán Ramírez" [...] would be forever linked to Daniel García and {{was a big part of}} the reason why subsequent efforts to give someone else the name failed to catch the favor of the fans.|$|R
