Here we demonstrate a new class of organic-inorganic hybrid material based on polypyrrole and zinc oxide (PPy/ZnO) nanofibers for use as a low-cost large-area cathode material. Solution chemistry based surfactant chemical oxidation polymerisation is used to synthesise the nanofibers and the macroscopic turn-on electric field for emission has been measured to be as low as 1. 8 V/μm, with an emission current density of 1 mA/cm 2 possible for an applied electric field of less than 4 V/μm.

40|$|For {{corrosion}} resistant materials exposed to low-temperature atmospheric environments, the corrosion mode of highest risk {{is expected to}} be localized corrosion (pitting, crevice, stress-corrosion cracking) due to accumulation of aggressive species within thin solution layers and/or formation of occluded local geometries. The stability of such a localized corrosion site requires that the corroding site (anode) must dissolve at a sufficient high rate to maintain the critical chemistry, and a robust cathodic <b>area</b> (<b>cathode)</b> must exist that can provide sufficient cathodic current. The characteristics of both the anode and the cathode depend on a large number of physiochemical variables (e. g., temperature, ionic concentration, water layer thickness, etc) and electrochemical parameters (i. e., cathodic and anodic polarization behavior). The effects of all these parameters add significantly to the dimensionality of the problem and a systematic study of these parameters is thus more tractable computationally than experimentally.

The objectives {{of this study were}} to computationally characterize the stability of such a local corrosion system and to explore the effects of physiochemical and electrochemical parameters. The overall goal of the work is to contribute to the establishment of a scientific basis for the prediction of the stabilization of localized attack. An analytical method is presented for evaluating the stability of localized corrosion of corrosion-resistant alloys under thin-layer (or atmospheric) conditions. The method requires input data that are either thermodynamic in nature or easily obtained experimentally. The maximum cathode current available depends on the cathode geometry, temperature, relative humidity, deposition density of salt (i. e., mass of salt per unit area of cathode), and interfacial electrochemical kinetics. The anode demand depends on the crevice geometry, the position of attack within the crevice, and the localized corrosion stability product. The localized corrosion stability product, i*x, is the product of the current density at the localized corrosion site and the depth of that localized corrosion site. By coupling these two approaches for analysis of the current capacity of the cathode and the current demand of the anode, the stability of a crevice can be determined for a given environmental scenario.

40|$|Today, proton {{electrolyte}} membrane {{fuel cell}} (PEMFC) and direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) are attractive power conversion devices that generate fairly low or even no pollution, and {{considered to be}} potential to replace conventional fossil fuel based power sources on automobiles. The operation and performance of PEMFC and DMFC depend largely on electro-catalysts positioned between the electrode and the membranes. The most commonly used electro-catalysts for PEMFC and DMFC are Pt-based noble metal nanoparticles, so catalysts share close to 50 % of {{the total cost of}} the fuel cell. The synthesis of such nanoscale electro-catalysts are commonly limited to harsh conditions (high temperature, high pressure), organic solvent, high amount of stabilizing agent, to achieve the size and morphological control. There is no rational guideline for the selection of stabilizing agent for specific materials, leading to the current "trial and error" approach in selecting stabilizing agent. This dissertation initially explores a new way to select material-specific stabilizing agents for the synthesis of the noble metal nanoparticles. With the help of phage display (PD) technique, a rational biomimetic approach can be used to select biomolecule (peptide) that specifically recognizes the surface of targeted material (use Pt as a case-study for this dissertation), and the selected peptides can be used as stabilizing agent to synthesize monodispersed Pt nanoparticles with tunable morphologies under mild synthetic conditions (atmospheric room temperature, aqueous solution). With fairly easy processing, the nanoparticles can be used as high surface <b>area</b> <b>cathode</b> electro-catalyst in fuel cells. With the as-synthesized Pt nanoparticles, bimetallic nanoparticles containing Pt can be prepared for more electro-catalytic applications, such as the oxygen reduction reaction at the cathode of fuel cells, and the oxidation of methanol at the anode in DMFC. The materials synthesized include heterogeneously structured Pt-Pd core-shell nanoparticles, and homogenerously alloyed PtRu nanoparticles. The Pt-Pd core-shell nanoparticles, with Pd shell thickness controlled with atomic-layer precision, show almost 3 -fold enhancement in catalytic activity for the ORR as well as better catalytic performance in oxidation of methanol, compared with commercially available catalysts.

40|$|Polymer {{electrolyte}} membrane {{fuel cells}} are a promising alternative energy source, {{capable of being}} deployed as successful replacements in many stationary and mobile applications. These devices, however, lack durability, and this {{has become one of}} the limiting factors for commercialization. Many projects have focused on finding ways to improve their lifetimes, but few have tried to examine the underlying causes behind their corrosion. The goal of this project was to identify which parameters have a significant impact, both positive and negative, on PEMFC durability. To do this, three series of samples were analyzed using microscopic, spectroscopic, and electrochemical methods. Electron microscope images provided information on the sample morphology and structural composition. Scanning electron microscopy provided information on the samples surface morphology, including roughness and porosity; transmission electron microscopy was used to determine the thickness and continuity of graphite sheet in the samples, and scanning transmission electron microscopy provided information on particle size distribution. Spectroscopic techniques interrogated the surface and bulk of the samples to provide information on their chemical composition. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was used to analyze the surface chemistry of the samples, while electron energy loss spectroscopy was used to quantify the relative graphite content in the bulk. The electrochemical methods used determined how the samples reacted to differing operating conditions, and were used to accelerate the aging process. Rotating disk electrodes were employed to study the catalytic performance of the samples in an ideal setting, while membrane electrode assemblies gauged how well the samples performed in a more realistic application. By comparing the structural and chemical composition throughout a sample’s lifetime, correlations relating performance changes to changes in its physical structure were identified. Multivariate analysis provided a means of comparing highly different data sets, and identifying similar patterns between them. Based on the data, we have found that higher surface <b>area</b> <b>cathode</b> catalysts suffer greater performance losses over their lifetime due in large part to changes in their porosity. Higher surface area carbons are also characterized by discontinuous graphite structures, making them more susceptible to oxidation than lower surface area carbon supports. It was also found that samples with higher microporosity (nanometers) were more stable than samples with high mesoporosity (5 - 20 µm), but that porosity increases due to the aging process. The total graphite content was also found to be less important that the surface graphite content. It was determined that the speciation of platinum in the samples had an effect on the durability, and samples with high PtO and Pt-C content at the beginning of life were more stable than those with mostly Pt metal. Furthermore, it was found that samples that experienced the largest losses in performance were associated with the largest increase in Pt metal speciation, and PtO and Pt-C content was reduced overall. Finally, it was determined that it is difficult to directly compare results for durability testing performed using a rotating disk electrode to those obtained using a membrane electrode assembly. In order to increase the predictive capability of RDE experiments, future work will need to investigate altering many of the experimental conditions, such as the electrolyte and ionomer content.

Two-dimensional aximetric model includes the arc discharge <b>area</b> between the <b>cathode</b> and the outlet nozzle of the water plasma torch. The aim of numerical simulation is to demonstrate arc performance for two radiation models involved and to estimate validity of local thermodynamic equlibrium (LTE) conditions within the arc column...|$|R
40|$|Four {{types of}} newly {{developed}} high speed photomultipliers are discussed: all electrostatic; static crossed field; dynamic crossed field; and hybrid (EBS). Design, construction, and performance parameters of each class are presented along with limitations of each class of device and prognosis for its future in high speed light detection. The particular {{advantage of these}} devices lies in high speed applications using low photon flux, large <b>cathode</b> <b>areas,</b> and broadband optical detection...|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of the}} NASA/OAST {{sponsored}} program {{on the development of}} ambient-temperature secondary lithium cells for future space applications is to develop cells with a 100 W h/kg specific energy and capable of 1000 cycles at 50 -percent depth of discharge. This paper examines the performance potentials of Li-TiS 2, Li-MoS 3, Li-V 6 O 13, and Li-NbSe 3 electrochemical systems at ambient temperature, together with cycle life and safety characteristics. Of these four, the Li-TiS 2 system was found to be the most promising in terms of achievable specific energy and cycle life. Major advances made on the development of secondary lithium cells, which are in the <b>areas</b> of <b>cathode</b> processing technology, mixed solvent electrolytes, and cell assembly, are summarized...|$|R
