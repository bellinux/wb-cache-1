5|$|Dietrich v The Queen, is an {{important}} legal case, stemming from an incident that took place on 17 December 1986, that was decided in the High Court of Australia on 13 November 1992. It concerned {{the nature of the}} right to a fair trial, <b>and</b> <b>under</b> <b>what</b> <b>circumstances</b> indigent defendants (defendants who cannot afford legal representation) should be provided with legal aid by the state. The case determined that although there is no absolute right to have publicly funded counsel, in most circumstances a judge should grant any request for an adjournment or stay when an accused is unrepresented. It is {{an important}} case in Australian criminal law, and also in Australian constitutional law, since it is one of many cases in which some members of the High Court have found implied human rights in the Australian Constitution.|$|E

The Assemblies also controlled the creation and abolishment of, and salaries for, positions within provincial and municipal civil services. The nomination, suspension and dismissal of civil servants was reserved for the president (governor) of the province, but how <b>and</b> <b>under</b> <b>what</b> <b>circumstances</b> he could exercise these prerogatives was delineated by the Assembly. The expropriation of private property (with due monetary compensation) for provincial or municipal interests was also a right of the Assembly. In effect, the Provincial Assembly could enact any kind of law—with no ratification by Parliament—so long as such local laws did not violate or encroach upon the Constitution. However, provinces were not permitted to legislate in the areas of criminal law, criminal procedure laws, civil rights and obligations, the armed forces, the national budget or matters concerning national interests, such as foreign relations.|$|E

25|$|The {{origin of}} soy bean {{cultivation}} remains scientifically debated. Early Chinese records mention that soybeans were {{a gift from}} the region of Manchuria and the Korean peninsula. Recent research, however, indicates that seeding of wild forms started early (before 5000 BCE) in multiple locations throughout East Asia The Great Soviet Encyclopedia claims soybean cultivation originated in China about 5000 years ago. Some scholars suggest that soybean originated in China and was domesticated about 3500 BCE. However, the oldest preserved soybeans resembling modern varieties in size and shape were found in archaeological sites in Korea dated about 1000 BCE Radiocarbon dating of soybean samples recovered through flotation during excavations at the Early Mumun period Okbang site in Korea indicated soybean was cultivated as a food crop in around 1000–900 BCE. Soybeans from the Jomon period in Japan from 3000 BCE are also significantly larger than wild varieties. The cultivation of soybeans began in the eastern half of northern China by 2000 BCE, but is almost certainly much older. Soybeans became an important crop by the Zhou Dynasty (c. 1046 BCE–256 BCE) in China. However, the details of where, when, <b>and</b> <b>under</b> <b>what</b> <b>circumstances</b> soybean developed a close relationship with people are poorly understood. Soy bean was unknown in South China before the Han period From about the first century CE to the Age of Discovery (15–16th century), soybeans were introduced into across South and Southeast Asia. This spread was due to the establishment of sea and land trade routes. The earliest Japanese textual reference to the soybean is in the classic Kojiki (Records of Ancient Matters), which was completed in 712 CE.|$|E

Unlike neural and "neo-connectionist" models, ours' allow a comparative and incremental evaluation of their validity and relevance to the observed phenomena. The possibility of their application to the modeling and study of stock market phenomena is demonstrated on a simple example of a central agency that regulates the behavior of the investors : we show how a "blind" or myopic behavioral model reproduces results found in the literature and how the mutation of the model according to the parameters' values or the adaptation structures gives rise to a series of complex phenomena comparable to those observed in reality. 1 Introduction Why do prices fluctuate <b>and</b> <b>under</b> <b>what</b> <b>circumstance</b> [...] ...|$|R

2500|$|As Finkielsztejn writes – on 6 July 1941 the Jews {{who escaped}} from Wąsosz {{arrived in the}} {{neighboring}} town of Radziłów, {{but the next day}} pogrom broke out there as well. According to his deposition 1,500 local and refugee Jews were burned there in a barn. However, there's also an early Polish monument on the outskirts of Radziłów which reads, [...] "In August 1941 fascists murdered 800 persons of Jewish descent , 500 of them were burned alive in a barn." [...] The date on the monument is incorrect but historical research confirms that Jews were killed in Radziłów on 7 July how many, <b>and</b> <b>under</b> <b>what</b> <b>circumstances,</b> remains unknown. The pages from Finkielsztejn's paper describing the actual pogrom vanished from the Jewish Historical Institute of Warsaw in the following years. According to the remaining page, the Germans found later, that allegedly only fifteen Jews were left alive in Wąsosz. The Jews stayed in the town until June 1942 under the supervision of German gendarmerie who [...] "behaved properly" [...] (whatever it means); and were used by the Nazis for forced labor purposes. Finkielsztejn insisted that all criminals were Polish, even those who had Russian names, or were driving German tanks, while armed to their teeth by the Gestapo. His paper ends there. In November 1942 the survivors were moved to the Bogusze transit camp and in January 1943 sent to Majdanek or Treblinka extermination camps.|$|E

2500|$|Since the Memorandum's {{signing the}} U.S. has {{transferred}} 3,082 detainees to Afghan control according to Afghan Army General Ghulam Farouk. He said on September 10, 2012 that the U.S. {{was in the}} process of transferring the remaining 30 inmates picked up before the memorandum was signed plus another 600 captured after the signing. But a few weeks ago, the U.S. stopped all transfers. A coalition official told CNN the United States is holding on to several Afghan detainees because of concerns about whether Afghan authorities will properly handle their cases <b>and</b> <b>under</b> <b>what</b> <b>circumstances</b> they might be released. The U.S. also is keeping several prisoners of other nationalities who were not part of the agreement the source said. [...] "Some 99 percent of the detainees captured before 9 March have already been transferred to Afghan authority, but we have paused the transfer of the remaining detainees until our concerns are met," [...] said Jamie Graybeal, a spokesman for the U.S.-led military coalition. Graybeal would not describe the concerns, but a report released in early September 2012 by the New York-based Open Society Foundations said the rift was over whether the Afghans will have a so-called [...] "internment" [...] system that allows some detainees to be held without charge or trial. The U.S. has been holding detainees in internment at Bagram for years. Although the Afghan government agreed to embrace an internment system by signing the accord in March, some top Afghan officials and legal experts contend it violates the Afghan constitution, the report said. Moreover, Karzai himself is opposed to administrative detention (Detaines are held without access to lawyers, public trials or other legal rights), according to the report. The U.S. is now worried that the Afghan government will discontinue internment and either release dangerous detainees or forward their cases to the loosely run Afghan judicial system, which is tainted by corruption and secrecy, the group said. [...] "There are concerns on the U.S. side about division in the Afghan government over internment and that it is not constitutional," [...] said Rachel Reid, a senior policy adviser on Afghanistan for the Open Society Foundations. [...] "The basic concern is that if they don't have internment, they will be released." [...] On the flip side of the legal issue, some Afghan legal experts are worried about Afghan officials abusing any authority to hold detainees without trial.
