40|$|In {{atmospheric}} sciences, {{sizes of}} data sets grow continuously due to increasing resolutions. A central task is {{the comparison of}} spatiotemporal fields, to assess different simulations and to compare simulations with observations. A significant information reduction is possible by focusing on geometric-topological features of the fields or on derived meteorological objects. Due to the huge size of the data sets, spatial features have to be extracted in time slices and traced over time. Fields with chaotic component, i. e. without 1 : 1 spatiotemporal correspondences, can be compared by looking upon statistics of feature properties. Feature extraction, however, requires a clear mathematical definition of the features - which many meteorological objects still lack. Traditionally, object extractions are often heuristic, defined only by implemented algorithms, and thus are not comparable. This work surveys our framework designed for efficient development of feature tracking methods and for testing new feature definitions. The framework supports well-established visualization practices and is being used by <b>atmospheric</b> <b>researchers</b> to diagnose and compare data...|$|R
40|$|A {{meteoroid}} {{penetrating the}} Earth's atmosphere leaves behind {{a trail of}} dense plasma in the E-region ionosphere, a region where electrons are strongly magnetized while ions are demagnetized due to their frequent collisions with neutrals.

This paper describes a theory and simulations of trail plasma physics which applies {{to the majority of}} small meteors. Unlike earlier papers, our theory assumes a significant angle between the geomagnetic field and the plasma trail and includes the important interaction between the trail and the background ionospheric plasma.

40|$|Recently some <b>atmospheric</b> <b>researchers</b> {{have turned}} to {{thermodynamics}} to avoid the complexity of conventional atmospheric models.

Stephens and O’Brien have calculated the entropy production rate of Earth based on satellite energy measurements and have concluded that its value supports the maximum dissipation conjecture. In this paper, we present evidence that Prigogine’s minimum entropy production principle is not applicable to atmospheric circulation. The calculation of the extremum simply shows that the entropy production rate is minimum with respect to any force when the corresponding flux has ceased. The force-flux equations completely govern the response of the system, under certain constraints, to applied external forces or radiative sources and sinks.

40|$|The ash {{plume of}} the Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallajökull {{covering}} Europe in April and May 2010 has notably attracted {{the interest of}} <b>atmospheric</b> <b>researchers.</b> Emission, transport, and deposition of the volcanic ash are simulated with the regional chemistry-transport model COSMOeMUSCAT. Key input parameters for transport models are the ash injection height, which controls the ash layer height during long-range transport, and the initial particle size distribution, which influences the sedimentation velocity. For each model layer, relative release rates are parameterised using stereo-derived plume heights from NASA’s space-borne Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) observations near the source. With this model setup the ash is emitted at several levels beneath the maximum plume heights reported by the Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre (VAAC) London. The initial particle size distribution used in COSMOeMUSCAT is derived from airborne in-situ measurements. In addition, the impact of different injection heights on the vertical distribution of the volcanic ash plume over Europe is shown. Ash emissions at specific control levels allow to assess the relative contribution of each layer to the spatial distribution after transport. The model results are compared to aerosol optical depths from European Sun photometer sites, lidar profiles measured over Leipzig/Germany, and ground-based microphysical measurements from several German air quality stations. In particular the good agreement between modelled vertical profiles of volcanic ash and lidar observations indicates that using the MISR stereoheight retrievals to characterize atmospheric ash input provide an alternative to injection height models in case of lacking information on eruption dynamics...|$|R
40|$|International {{terrorism}} {{has reached a}} level where adequate countermeasures to protect the population have to be provided by the authorities. Similarly, the improved surveillance and protection of sensitive infrastructures, like for instance nuclear power plants or hazardous materials industries, attracts increased attention. The efficient inspection of people with respect to weapons and explosives is of increasing interest particularly for transportation services or public events. Hence, research on these new challenges had been animated through various organizations. In addition, the requirements for considerably extended and improved security on the civilian sector have blurred the former frontiers between exclusively military and civilian use and development of high-tech systems. Driven by this evolution the so-called THz range {{of the electromagnetic spectrum}} came into the focus of recent research activities. In the past mainly the radio astronomy community and some <b>atmospheric</b> <b>researchers</b> were using these wavelengths already for many years. Nowadays the upper microwave range, i. e. the millimetre-waves, is often assigned to the lower THz range, since frequencies above 100 GHz are not widely used. Microwaves in the range of 1 - 100 GHz are already used in many respects for remote sensing applications. Besides radar sensors particularly passive measurement methods are used for two-dimensional imaging. Microwaves can penetrate clothing and a multitude of other materials and allow the detection of hidden objects by monitoring dielectric anomalies. Passive microwave remote sensing allows a daytime independent non-destructive observation and examination of the objects of interest under nearly all weather conditions without artificial exposure of persons or areas. In this paper the application of some “lower THz” imaging radiometer systems for security, military, and defence applications is illustrated. ...|$|R

However, vertically and horizontally, co-registering and regridding datasets from independently developed missions, Aqua, Calipso, Cloudsat, Parasol, and Aura, {{so that they can}} be inter-compared can be daunting to some, and may be repeated by many. Scientists will individually spend much of their time and resources acquiring A-Train datasets of interest residing at various locations, developing algorithms to match up and graph datasets along the A-Train track, and search through large amounts of data for areas and/or phenomena of interest. The aggregate amount of effort that can be expended on repeating pre-science tasks could climb into the tens of millions of dollars. The goal of the A-Train Data Depot (ATDD) is to enable free movement of remotely located A-Train data so that they are combined to create a consolidated vertical view of the Earth's Atmosphere along the A-Train tracks. The innovative approach of analyzing and visualizing atmospheric profiles along the platforms track (i. e., time) is accomplished by through the ATDDs Giovanni data analysis and visualization tool. Giovanni brings together data from Aqua (MODIS, AIRS, AMSR-E), Cloudsat (cloud profiling radar) and Calipso (CALIOP, IIR), as well as the Aura (OMI, MLS, HIRDLS, TES) to create a consolidated vertical view of the Earth's Atmosphere along the A-Train tracks. This easy to learn and use exploration tool will allow users to create vertical profiles of any desired A-Train dataset, for any given time of choice. This presentation shows the power of Giovanni by describing and illustrating how this tool facilitates and aids A-Train science and research. A web based display system Giovanni provides users with the capability of creating co-located profile images of temperature and humidity data from the MODIS, MLS and AIRS instruments for a user specified time and spatial area.

40|$|One of {{the more}} {{difficult}} tasks confronting <b>atmospheric</b> <b>researchers</b> today is the acquisition of long-term radiometric measurements that encapsulate variability in the sky hemisphere as well as time. High quality spatial measurements would allow for {{a greater understanding of}} atmospheric processes, both specific to the site and between locations. This information would lead to further development of better spatial models for predicting future trends. This study develops a timer-controlled variable sky-view platform (or VSP), designed to encapsulate both the spatial and temporal variation of radiation in the sky hemisphere for Hobart (42. 90 S; 147. 33 E). The VSP essentially allows for a sensor to move up and down inside a fixed cylinder, therefore causing the sky view factor to vary. It is currently in use with the erythemal ultraviolet (UV) biometer 501 -A manufactured by Solar Light Company Inc. (SLC). As such, the VSP provides an additional source of UV sky distribution data to the Hobart UV-climatology database. Before VSP deployment of the SLC instrument, it was first necessary to fully characterise its cosine response in an accurate calibration scheme. Here, calibration of the detector is dependent upon wavelength as well as solar zenith angle, due to the discrepancy between the actual instrument relative spectral response and the erythemal response curve. In this study, measurements were compared for the purpose of characterising a new cosine response function (CRF) for the broadband detector. Concurrent measurements of spectral and broadband erythemal UV data have been undertaken at the University of Tasmania in Hobart, Australia. Measurements spanned solar zenith angles (SZA) of 21 °- 74 °, total ozone values of 220 to 320 -DU and relatively small aerosol optical depths. The CRF is both wavelength and SZA dependent and applicable to all broadband UV-B instruments based on the original Robertson-Berger design. A methodology is presented for incorporation of the CRF into the calibration scheme. The concept of spectral multipliers is introduced, which are unique to each broadband instrument and correct for the wavelength dependence of the CRF. A method is then described for ongoing calibration of the detector based on model data alone. The scheme is then tested with real data to validate its reliability. Overall, by nature of the simultaneous characterisation of both spectral and cosine response, the CRF allowed for a more robust calibration for the VSP deployed sensor. A full description of the VSP design, electronics and construction is then given. Emphasis is on high precision long-term operation under all weather conditions. A modelling scheme and output results illustrate the advantages of the VSP over current sky observing instruments. It can accurately parameterise the direct and diffuse erythemal irradiance as well as the azimuthally-integrated erythemal sky radiance distribution for every two minutes duration (at the current setting). In addition, all data can be obtained for clear-sky and cloudy conditions. Analysis of the clear-sky VSP sky distribution, in conjunction with spectroradiometer radiance measurements, allows for derivation of the azimuthally-integrated circumsolar component for each zenith angle. The thesis concludes with an application of the VSP for the all-sky calibration of other radiometric instruments. Occulting disk or shadowband arrangements are often applied to both spectral and broadband sensors in order to retrieve the total diffuse irradiance. Here, extraction of the diffuse component is simply calculated as a difference between the measured global and direct components. However, difficulty lies in the application of a suitable diffuse calibration due to the instrument cosine response. Generally, the sky distribution is assumed isotropic during the correction, whereas it has been shown in most studies to be nearly always anisotropic. Hence, without in situ sky distribution measurements it is difficult to obtain the correct total diffuse measurement. This study utilises VSP-extracted erythemal sky distribution data. Results are used to correct for the cosine error of instruments that measure diffuse erythemal radiation data, for both clear-sky and cloudy conditions. A comparison was then made between corrected diffuse values resulting from application of an isotropic versus the real sky distribution. Results showed that an isotropic diffuse correction overestimated the real diffuse signal by a maximum of 4 to 6...|$|R

Fuels derived from renewable biological resources used in diesel engines {{are known as}} biodiesel. Biodiesel is environmental friendly liquid fuel similar to petrol and diesel in combustion properties. Increasing environmental concern, diminishing petroleum reserves and agriculture based economy of our country are the driving forces to promote biodiesel as an alternate fuel. Hydrogen seems to be viable fuel to meet sustainable energy demand with minimum environmental impact. Hydrogen has high calorific value and clean burning characteristics which makes it effective fuel for future. It was found that hydrogen usage reduce emissions such as CO 2 and HC. India {{is one of the}} largest producers of neem oil and its seed contains 30 % oil content. It is an untapped source in India, so the neem oil usage will be a best option. The investigation made on pure neem oil and neem oil with hydrogen addition at different flow rate (2 lpm & 4 lpm) in CI engines. The result shows that, brake thermal efficiency of neem oil with 4 lpm hydrogen was increased to 7. 98 % compare to pure neem oil at 4 Nm torque and fuel consumption of neem oil with 4 lpm hydrogen was decreased to 13. 49 % compared to pure neem oil at 4 Nm torque...|$|R
