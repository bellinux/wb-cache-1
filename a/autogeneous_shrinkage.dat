40|$|At early-age, {{hydration}} {{of cement}} {{leads to a}} reduction of volume (caused by the Le Chatelier contraction) which induces <b>autogeneous</b> <b>shrinkage.</b> Besides, hydration is an exothermic reaction and an increase of temperature occurs (followed by a decrease). As <b>autogeneous</b> <b>shrinkage</b> arises only in cement paste and as {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} may be different between cement paste and aggregates, strains incompatibilities lead to an internal self-equilibrated state of stress. Depending especially on the concrete mix, initial cracking may occur at the cement paste scale leading to a modification of the global concrete behavior. In this contribution, finite element simulations using a mesoscopic mesh are performed to access to the internal stresses and damage state due to the hydration process. Calculations take into account the autogenous shrinkage of the cement paste and the differential thermal behavior between cement paste and aggregates. Influence of basic creep strains, thermal boundary conditions and concrete mix (by a simplified approach) are studied showing that, for an ordinary concrete, hydration lead to a slight reduction of 'elastic' stiffness and tensile strength when creep is taken into account. On contrary on a high performance concrete, a significant reduction of the 'elastic' stiffness and tensile strength is expected (with respect to the potential tensile strength) even if the creep is taken into account...|$|E

In this context, this study intends to evaluate measures to mitigate concrete shrinkage through the incorporation of different percentages of fly ash (FA), shrinkage reducing admixtures (SRA) or superabsorbent polymers (SAP). For this, one has developed an experimental campaign on mortar specimens that consisted in the manufacture and subsequent shrinkage measurement of free specimens and sealed ones made with the different selected mix-designs. Shrinkage was recorded along time up to 304 days of age and not only the total shrinkage was evaluated so as the autogeneous and drying shrinkage also. For the case of FA addition, one has studied different percentages of cement replacement by weight: 20, 40 and 60 %. The SRA type and content was selected based on previous study which permits to obtain the best shrinkage performance. As for the mortar containing SAP one has adopted a dosage currently used. As a complement to the shrinkage measurements, one has evaluated also the mass loss of the samples and the compressive strength of the compositions over time. All specimens were placed in a controlled environment with an average temperature of 23. 5 ºC and 89. 0 % of moisture content. Based on the obtained results one can conclude that: the inclusion of FA considerably decreased the total shrinkage and also reduced, in an even more significantly way, the <b>autogeneous</b> <b>shrinkage.</b> These effects were more pronounced as the FA dosage had increased. However, it hasn’t had a great effect reducing drying shrinkage; the addition of SRA was responsible for an important reduction of all the types of shrinkage measured, being more efficient on the drying shrinkage; the inclusion of SAP was beneficial in the mitigation {{of all types of}} shrinkage, being more effective in <b>autogeneous</b> <b>shrinkage.</b> The composition with 60 % of FA was the most efficient in the decreasing of <b>autogeneous</b> <b>shrinkage</b> and the one with SRA was the most effective in the reduction of drying shrinkage...|$|E
30|$|Generally speaking, {{shrinkage}} will be stimulated {{at higher}} cement contents (De Schutter et al. 2008). This {{may lead to}} crack formation along the aggregate-paste interface and, as a consequence, to a lower tensile splitting strength (Nguyen et al. 2011). As discussed previously, RHA particles absorb {{a certain amount of}} mixing water into their pores. It has been proposed that at later age, the absorbed water released from inside of the pores to the surrounding cement matrix will cause the relative humidity in the interior not to drop, resulting in significantly less <b>autogeneous</b> <b>shrinkage</b> due to self-desiccation (Nguyen 2011).|$|E
40|$|Cellulose based materials, such {{as natural}} fibres, when added into a cement based matrix, can greatly affect the {{properties}} of the composite in its fresh state, early age and hardened state, including self healing capacity. This is due to their porous structure, hydrophilic character and water retention capability, which are likely to create additional moisture paths inside cement matrices. This paper focuses on the effect of nanoscale addition on the <b>autogeneous</b> and drying <b>shrinkage</b> of ce-ment mortars formulated from HPFRCC mixes. Two other different kinds of cel-lulose based additions were also studied for comparison, respectively eucalyptus micro fibers and natural sisal fibers, together with “conventional” steel fibres. This study is a part of a larger investigation undertaken by the authors in the frame-work of the EU-FP 7 research project EnCoRe (www. encore-fp 7. unisa. it) aimed at assessing the possibility of using cellulose based materials and natural fibers as promoters of self healing processes in advanced cementitious composites...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} limit the release of CO 2 {{produced}} in cement manufacturing, clinker (the major cement component) is often partially replaced by mineral admixtures like blastfurnace slag. The use of mineral admixtures presents different advantages such as the recycling of industrial waste and the improvement of different material properties (workability, sulfate resistance, compressive strength at long term 8 ̆ 5). Nevertheless, several civil engineering constructions made with blast-furnace slag cement presented cracking at early age due to restrained <b>shrinkage</b> (<b>autogeneous,</b> thermal and drying shrinkage) that affects significantly the material transfer properties and their durability in aggressive environments (chloride, CO 2). Under certain conditions however, {{it is known that}} cementitious materials present a self-healing capacity. The purpose of this research work is to study the beneficial influence of the natural selfhealing capacity of mortars with blast-furnace slag cement on the lifetime of civil engineering constructions. A new experimental device has been designed {{in order to understand the}} selfhealing capacity of mortars at early age. The novel apparatus allows developing micro-cracks in a mortar ring specimen by restrained shrinkage and monitoring the evolution of self-healing by gas permeability and effective diffusivity measurements. The effects of different slag contents (0...|$|R
40|$|A Predicting delayed strains (creep and shrinkage) in {{concrete}} {{proves to be}} critical to {{a large number of}} pre-stressed concrete structures, such as containment vessels of nuclear power plants, post-tensioned bridge girders, etc. These delayed strains include two components of shrinkage, namely, <b>Autogeneous</b> <b>shrinkage</b> and Drying shrinkage and two components of creep strains, namely, Basic creep and Drying creep. The present study focuses to predict the creep and shrinkage of Self Compacted Concrete (SCC) and High volume fly ash normal concrete experimentally. And a Hygro thermo chemo mechanical model (D. Gawin et al, 2006) is implemented to estimate gaseous pressure, capillary pressure and temperature and displacements which in turn varies with the hydration process.

It studies the impact of the water/cement ratio and the fines/cement ratio on the behaviour of hardened SCC. Several tests were carried out, such as surface settlement, L box, sieving, bleeding, mechanical strengths, free shrinkage (drying shrinkage and <b>autogeneous</b> <b>shrinkage)</b> and a microstructure study (mineralogical characterization, pore space distribution), to better understand the roles of the various possible SCC components made with local materials and to identify the mechanisms governing shrinkage. We highlighted the role of the pore network and the microstructure of the hydrates. Results show good SCC optimization potential in Algeria.

40|$|In some {{applications}} of high strength fiber reinforced cementitious composites (HSFRCC), shrinkage {{is an important}} concern. From the literature, shrinkage can be reduced {{by the addition of}} shrinkage reducing admixture (SRA) or replacing Portland cement with sulfoaluminate cement (SAC). This investigation studies the effectiveness of SAC and SRA in reducing the shrinkage of HSFRCC. HSFRCC of water-to-binder ratios 0. 19, 0. 3 and 0. 4 when Portland cement is employed, as well as 0. 21, 0. 3 and 0. 4 with SAC, are tested under both sealed condition (to study <b>autogeneous</b> <b>shrinkage)</b> and drying condition. According to the test results, SAC is more effective in reducing shrinkage of HSFRCC with higher water-to-binder ratio whereas SRA is more effective for HSFRCC with lower water-to-binder ratio. Combined use of SAC and SRA can lead to very significant shrinkage reduction. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
30|$|RHA is {{classified}} as a highly reactive pozzolan. It possesses a very high silica content {{similar to that of}} SF (Mehta 1994). Using less-expensive and locally available RHA as a mineral admixture in concrete brings benefits to the economy, the technical properties of concrete and the environment as well. RHA is a porous material. Pore structure is the most important characteristic of this material. The change of this characteristic results in a different specific surface area (SSA) and therefore a different pozzolanic reactivity and different water absorption of RHA (Bui 2001; Nguyen 2011; Le et al. 2012; Van et al. 2013). RHA has been studied to replace SF as a partial Portland cement replacement, and the results show that RHA can fully substitute SF in terms of calcium hydroxide consumption, <b>autogeneous</b> <b>shrinkage,</b> compressive strength and durability of high performance concrete (Bui 2001; Van et al. 2013; Feng et al. 2004; Le et al. 2012; Salas et al. 2009) and ultra high performance concrete (Nguyen 2011; Nguyen et al. 2011). However, the effect of RHA on properties of HPFGC needs additional research.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the factors influencing {{the durability of}} glued assemblies of wood and cementitious material under variable hygrometric conditions. The composite specimens are composed of cement paste connected to plywood using epoxy glue. The cement paste is subjected to <b>autogeneous</b> <b>shrinkage</b> and the wood is subjected to imbibition test. Plywood is used so that the swelling deformations due to the imbibition process are parallel to the connection plane. Swelling strains in wood {{are related to the}} water content measured by gammadensimetry technique. Global strains above and below the glue interface have been measured and have been compared to the free strains. We showed that there are restrained deformations at the glue interface and that the cement paste is damaged. Local strains have been characterized by means of the digital image correlation technique. We showed in particular that the deformations in wood are related to the microstructure of the layers of plywood and that the restrained deformations at the glue interface lead to a bending of the cement paste. In the case of strong adhesion properties, this bending induces cracking in cement paste...|$|E
40|$|Synchrotron {{radiation}} {{is used for}} X-ray computed tomography to characterise the hydration process of Portland cement. Quantitative determination of the three-dimensional absorption coefficient distribution due {{to the use of}} monochromatic radiation and the achieved high spatial resolution allows the study of the spatial microstructure of cement volume during hydration. The present study has demonstrated the potential of the method for real-time imaging of the evolution of cement structure after solidification. The method yields three-dimensional (3 -D) images of the sample volume in a non-destructive manner. Thus, by reiterated imaging of the same sample region at different times, processes in the sample volume can be tracked. During cement hydration, effects such as the formation and further evolution of microcracks and pores - mainly related to <b>autogeneous</b> <b>shrinkage</b> - could be observed {{for the first time in}} the cement volume with up to 1 mu m resolution. Image analysis of the acquired 3 -D data sets allows the determination of the temporal evolution of microporosity and of the fraction of contiguous pore volume for different water: cement ratios of the initial cement paste...|$|E
40|$|Tensile cracks {{significantly}} affect {{the durability of}} concrete pavements, leading {{to an increase in}} the costs of maintenance and rehabilitation. A model is developed that relates thermal, chemical, and hygral evolutions at small scales due to different distress mechanisms to the risk of fracture at the structural scale. The method is based on application of linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) to eigenstresses that develop in infinite- and finite-length beams on an elastic foundation that represents the subgrade. Axial and bending contributions to the energy release rate are determined for a worst-case scenario of an entirely cracked pavement section in functions of material properties, structural dimensions, and eigenstress forces and moments. By way of example, the model is used to study the risk of fracture of concrete pavements due to two different mechanisms: (1) <b>autogeneous</b> <b>shrinkage</b> at early ages of placing the concrete and (2) thermal cycles at the short term and long term after a temperature change. In addition, scaling relationships are developed that provide insight into the improvement of different structural and material properties for minimizing the risk of fracture.

40|$|The main aim of {{this thesis}} is to refine models for {{strength}} and heat development of the young concrete, and evaluate if developed models at Luleå University of Technology (LTU) for creep, autogenous shrinkage and thermal dilation needs refinement. These are of importance in hardening control and in crack control of a concrete structure. Strength development {{is one of the}} most important properties in concrete to consider when analysing concrete structures. The need of actions on site is different at various stages of hardening, from the fresh concrete to the hardened concrete. This thesis defines a model analysing maturity and associated strength growth within three important time periods. The model can be applied separately within each of these periods depending on test data available. Known is that the temperature plays an important role on the strength development of concrete structures. Not so well known is that, if the concrete temperature remains high, strength reduction at later ages often occurs compared to hardening at lower temperature. Both these phenomena have been implemented in the model for strength growth and the functionality of the model is demonstrated by evaluation of laboratory tests for five concrete mixes and two types of cement. As heat of hydration affects the temperature levels and several other properties of concrete structures it is important to document the parameters accurately. In the traditional semi-adiabat (TSA) the measured heat energy originates from the reaction between cement and water. This energy warms up the concrete sample and all the ambient materials of the equipment. In order to model these energies, the TSA setup is transformed into an associated sphere. A refined model using a correction factor is introduced, which accounts for energies lost to the TSA setup materials. Results show that the effect of this factor cannot be disregarded. An increased insulation amount gives a decreased cooling factor but an increased need for correction. Creep at constant temperature, both for moist sealed specimens and drying out conditions, are evaluated. The Linear Logarithmic creep Model (LLM) is shown to work well for basic creep, i. e. creep at moist sealed conditions. But, for creep during simultaneous moist drying, there is a need to adjust the current model or develop a new model to account for the increase of creep due to ongoing drying. Autogenous shrinkage and thermal dilation (free deformation) are evaluated from tests. For the free deformation of young concrete at variable temperature the existing models are satisfactory in modelling the thermal dilation, but in some cases the autogenous shrinkage cannot be adequately described. A new or refined model is needed that works for <b>autogeneous</b> <b>shrinkage</b> even at more complex temperature variations.
