5|$|On 4 February 2004, I Corps forward {{headquarters}} {{deployed to}} Iraq. The element, called Task Force Olympia, deployed to Mosul, Iraq in January 2004, where it assumed its mission from the 101st Airborne Division {{to form a}} headquarters to exercise command and control of all coalition <b>and</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>forces</b> in northern Iraq. It coordinated the efforts of both of the active Stryker Brigade Combat Teams, attached engineers, civil affairs, signal, and other supporting units as well as Iraqi security forces, eventually numbering more than 12,000. The Iraqi security forces included four Civil Defense Corps battalions, three Border Police battalions, several thousand members of the Iraq Facility Protection Security Forces and an Armed Forces battalion. After {{more than a year}} in Iraq, the corps forward headquarters handed over responsibility for northern Iraq to the soldiers of Task Force Freedom and 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment in February 2005.|$|E
5|$|Yet {{some members}} of the SASR {{continued}} to operate in Iraq {{over the next few years}} in a number of roles. In 2004 claims appeared in the media that Australian special forces were involved in counter-insurgency operations inside Iraq, although this was denied by the government. An SASR team was deployed to Iraq in May and June 2005 as part the effort to free Douglas Wood, an Australian engineer kidnapped in Baghdad; however, he was later recovered alive by US <b>and</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>forces.</b> In 2007, British media reports suggested that SASR elements were still operating in Iraq, along the southern border with Iran, targeting arms smugglers. Later, a small number of SASR personnel were deployed to Iraq in June 2014 to protect the Australian embassy when the security of Baghdad was threatened by the 2014 Northern Iraq offensive, while others were reported to have been tasked with providing security to Royal Australian Air Force aircrew aboard transport aircraft delivering arms and munitions to forces in Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq during September 2014.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in February 2008, US forces began {{returning}} {{political and}} military control of Anbar Province to Iraqis. On 14 February, 1st Battalion 7th Marines withdrew from Hīt. Two days later, American <b>and</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>forces</b> conducted a joint heliborne operation meant {{to show off the}} Iraqi security forces. More significantly, in late March, both Iraqi Army divisions in Anbar Province, the 1st and 7th Divisions, were sent south to participate in the Battle of Basra. Their participation helped win the battle for the government forces and showcased the major improvements to the Iraqi Army. On 26 March 2008, B Squadron of the British SAS as part of Task Force Knight were called upon to hit a terrorist bomb makers house in the early hours, after trying to call him out and receiving no response they stormed the house, they received a hail of fire and four men were wounded and a terrorist from another building joined in the firefight. With Helicopter support, they pressed on and the SAS chased their targets into another house who used civilians as hostages who were then accidentally killed beside the terrorists, One SAS operator was killed.|$|E

25|$|On April 15, the 769th Engineer Battalion, {{protected}} by 1-68 Armor Battalion C company M1 Abrams tanks, Stryker APCs and Apache helicopters, began {{construction of a}} massive concrete barrier along Al Quds Street, a major road separating the southern districts of Thawra and Jamilla from the northern districts which make up the heart of Sadr City. The barrier is designed to turn the southern districts of Sadr city into a protected zone in which US <b>and</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>forces</b> can begin reconstruction.|$|E
25|$|On 8 September, the Iraqi Army, {{with close}} air support from the U.S., retook the key Haditha Dam, and recaptured the town of Barwana, killing 15 ISIL fighters. ISIL responded with the public {{execution}} of David Haines. By the end of September 2014, the United States had conducted 240 airstrikes in Iraq and Syria, as well as 1,300 tanker refueling missions, totaling 3,800 sorties by all types of aircraft. A tactical arrangement with Kurdish <b>and</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>forces,</b> and drone videos {{are being used to}} coordinate {{close air support}} without needing U.S. troops in ground combat.|$|E
25|$|During {{the month}} of September, {{negotiations}} with local commanders produced a city council which was to govern the city. However, insurgents soon seized control and the agreement fell apart. The city government was infiltrated by insurgents and the city came {{under the control of}} the Iraqi insurgency. Fighters loyal to the insurgents, including but not particularly Abu Musab Zarqawi, roamed the streets, confiscating music cassette tapes, which were condemned as haram. Attacks on American <b>and</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>forces</b> in the vicinity of the city greatly increased. American commanders decided to re-take the city as a precursor to the upcoming battle to retake Fallujah.|$|E
50|$|As of November 18, 2004, the U.S. {{military}} reported 1200 insurgents {{killed and}} 1000 captured. U.S. casualties were 51 killed and 425 wounded, <b>and</b> the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>forces</b> were 8 killed and 43 wounded.|$|R
5000|$|On day 19, <b>Iraqi</b> Security <b>Forces,</b> {{advised by}} US Special Forces, {{detained}} an extremist leader and a terrorist financier in separate operations in Safwan, Iraq. <b>Iraqi</b> <b>and</b> US <b>forces</b> also detained {{the leader of}} an extremist group believed {{to be responsible for}} mortar and explosive projectile attacks against <b>Iraqi</b> <b>and</b> Coalition <b>Forces.</b>|$|R
50|$|Even {{though most}} insurgent {{attacks in the}} Triangle of Death are against <b>Iraqi</b> {{civilian}} <b>and</b> <b>Iraqi</b> government <b>forces,</b> U.S. forces have also {{been the target of}} a variety of attacks.|$|R
25|$|Unmanned Predator {{aircraft}} fired Hellfire missiles into Sadr City {{every day}} targeting the mortar and rocket teams. The fighting mostly stopped early on April 11, as U.S. <b>and</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>forces</b> managed to advance {{down the main}} road through Sadr City {{and set up a}} forward defence line inside the district. However, that night fighting continued when U.S. and Iraqi units were attacked with small-arms, machine guns and RPGs from high-rise buildings in Sadr City. Snipers and roadside bombs were also used against a Coalition convoy transporting concrete barriers for use in constructing an Iraqi Army checkpoint. The U.S. military claimed it killed at least 13 Madhi Army militiamen in three separate engagements following the attacks on its forces.|$|E
25|$|In early August, 2004, Sistani {{experienced}} {{serious health}} complications {{related to a}} previously diagnosed heart condition. He traveled to London to receive medical treatment. It was, reportedly, {{the first time that}} Sistani had left Iraq in decades, and may have been due, in part, to growing concerns for his safety from sectarian violence. Though still recovering, Sistani returned later in the month to broker a military truce at the Imam Ali Mosque in Najaf where Muqtada al-Sadr and the Mahdi Army had been cornered by American <b>and</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>forces.</b> Sadr, who rose rapidly to prominence through a series of independent military actions beginning in 2004, has since actively challenged Sistani's more progressive influence over Shia in the region.|$|E
25|$|The Kirkuk field still {{forms the}} basis for {{northern}} Iraqi oil production. Kirkuk has over 10 billion barrels (1.6km³) of remaining proven oil reserves. The Jambur, Bai Hassan, and Khabbaz fields are the only other currently producing oil fields in northern Iraq. While Iraq's northern oil industry remained relatively unscathed during the Iran-Iraq War, an estimated 60% of the facilities in southern and central Iraq were damaged in the Gulf War. Post-1991 fighting between Kurdish <b>and</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>forces</b> in northern Iraq resulted in temporary sabotage of the Kirkuk field's facilities. In 1996, production capacity in northern and central Iraq was estimated at between 0.7 and 1 million barrels (110,000 to 160,000 m³) per day, down from around 1.2 million barrels (190,000 m³) per day before the Gulf War.|$|E

25|$|Beginning 8 November, American <b>and</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>forces</b> {{invaded the}} militant stronghold of Fallujah in Operation Phantom Fury, killing and {{capturing}} many insurgents. Many rebels {{were thought to}} have fled the city before the invasion. U.S.-backed figures put insurgency losses at over 2,000. It was the bloodiest single battle for the U.S. in the war, with 92 Americans dead and several hundred wounded. A video showing the killing {{of at least one}} unarmed and wounded man by an American serviceman surfaced, throwing renewed doubt and outrage at the efficiency of the U.S. occupation. The Marine was later cleared of any wrongdoing because the Marines had been warned that the enemy would sometimes feign death and booby-trap bodies as a tactic to lure Marines to their deaths. November was the deadliest month of the occupation for coalition troops, surpassing April.|$|E
25|$|The initial Arab plans {{called for}} Syrian and Lebanese forces to invade from north while Jordanian <b>and</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>forces</b> were to invade from east {{in order to}} meet at Nazareth and then to push forward {{together}} to Haifa. In the south, the Egyptians were to advance and take Tel Aviv. At the Arab League meeting in Damascus on 11–13 May, Abdullah rejected the plan, which served Syrian interests, using the fact his allies were afraid to go to war without his army. He proposed that the Iraqis attack the Jezreel valley and the Arab Legion enter Ramallah and Nablus and link with the Egyptian army at Hebron, which was more in compliance with his political objective to occupy the territory allocated to the Arab State by the partition plan and promises not to invade the territory allocated to the Jewish State by the partition plan. In addition, Lebanon decided not {{to take part in the}} war at the last minute due to the still influential Christians' opposition and to Jewish bribes.|$|E
25|$|Al-Douri is {{the most}} {{high-profile}} Ba'athist official to successfully evade capture after the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and was the king of clubs in the infamous most-wanted Iraqi playing cards. Al-Douri continued to lead elements of the Iraqi insurgency such as the Naqshbandi Army against the then-occupation forces and waged an insurgency against the current regime in Baghdad. Following the execution of Saddam Hussein on 30 December 2006, al-Douri was confirmed as the new leader of the banned Iraqi Ba'ath Party on 3 January 2007. Al-Douri was reportedly killed in action—along with his nine bodyguards—on 17 April 2015 in a large-scale military operation by Shiite militias <b>and</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>forces</b> near the Al-Alaas oil fields in Hemreen east of Tikrit. The Shiite militant organization Asa'ib Ahl al-Haq has alleged to have killed him and transported his apparent body to Baghdad to confirm its identity. According to the BBC, Shiite militias claimed to have killed him, but the Iraqi Baath party denies his death, and his death has not been confirmed. A Kurdish news source also reported that Iraq did not have al-Douri's DNA to confirm his death.|$|E
50|$|On 27 April, ISIL militants {{launched}} {{an attack on}} the Baiji Oil Refinery, destroying three depots <b>and</b> several <b>Iraqi</b> <b>forces.</b> On 28 April, ISIL forces claimed to be in middle of the Baiji Oil Refenery.|$|R
