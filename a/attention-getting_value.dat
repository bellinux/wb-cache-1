40|$|This paper {{concerns}} a study aimed at selection of alarm sounds with improved audible performance characteristics for older listeners over current conventional residential smoke detectors. Many current residential smoke detectors possess alarms that have their primary frequency {{peak in the}} 4 OOO Hz region of the audible spectrum. Additionally, many of these alarms are constant instead of providing temporal modulation of the signal. This study analyzed a variety of alternative sounds for selection as a better choice for an "age sensitive " smoke alarm signal. The study presented a battery of candidate sounds to pairs of subjects aged 65 and older with varying levels of hearing impairment (0 to 45 dB) {{in their own homes}} to see which sounds performed best in terms of detection, localization, and perceived <b>attention-getting</b> <b>value.</b> Subjects were placed in various location- and masking-based conditions within their homes during listening periods and subjected to sounds played at a constant level. A computerized system collected response data as the battery of stimuli was presented. The data showed a fairly predictable positive trend in detection and localization performance level as the frequency of the stimuli decreased from 4000 Hz to 500 Hz. The data also showed that pulsed signals were more detectable than steady alarms...|$|E
