We picked out spammers from legitimate users by manually checking every captured user's microblogs content. We built a spammer dataset for each social network community using these spammer accounts and a legitimate user dataset as well. We analyzed several features of the two user classes and made a comparison on these features, which were found to be useful to distinguish spammers from legitimate users. The followings are several initial observations from our analysis on the features of spammers captured on Weibo. <b>com</b> and <b>QQ.</b> <b>com.</b> ¦The following/follower ratio of spammers is usually higher than legitimate users. They tend to follow a large amount of users in order to gain popularity but always have relatively few followers. ¦There exists a big gap between the average numbers of microblogs posted per day from these two classes. On Weibo. com, spammers post quite a lot microblogs every day, which is much more than legitimate users do; while on <b>QQ.</b> <b>com</b> spammers post far less microblogs than legitimate users. This is mainly due to the different strategies taken by spammers on these two platforms. ¦More spammers choose a cautious spam posting pattern. They mix spam microblogs with ordinary ones so that they can avoid the anti-spam mechanisms taken by the service providers. ¦Aggressive spammers {{are more likely to be}} detected so they tend to have a shorter life while cautious spammers can live much longer and have a deeper influence on the network.

We consider three interactions: a delta interaction that conserves seniority, <b>a</b> quadrupole-quadrupole (<b>QQ)</b> interaction that does not, and a third one consisting of two-body matrix elements taken from experiment (98 Cd) that also leads to some seniority mixing. We deal with proton holes relative to a Z= 50,N= 50 core. One surprising result is that, for a four-particle system with total angular momentum I= 4, there is one state with seniority v= 4 that is an eigenstate of any two-body interaction [...] seniority conserving or not. The other two states are mixtures of v= 2 and v= 4 for the seniority-mixing interactions. The same thing holds true for I= 6.

40|$|The {{highlights}} {{of studies of}} mixing among scalar mesons below and above 1 GeV within a nonlinear chiral Lagrangian framework is briefly presented. Two scalar meson nonets are introduced to explore the mass spectrum and decay properties of the I= 1 / 2 and I= 1 scalar states. For the I= 0 states, {{in addition to these}} two nonets a scalar glueball component is also taken into account, and together with the constraints from the I= 1 / 2 and I= 1 sectors, their mass spectrum is studied. The fact that <b>an</b> ideally mixed <b>qq</b> scalar nonet has a mass ordering which is opposite to that of an ideally mixed four-quark scalar nonet is exploited to gain some insight into the quark substructure of the I= 1 / 2, I= 1 and I= 0 states below and above 1 GeV. Consequently, numerical estimates of various components of these states (two quark and four quark components of I= 1 / 2 and I= 1 states, and two quark, four quark and glue component of I= 0 states) are determined. Scalar states below and above 1 GeV are shown in Fig. 1, and are all listed/discussed in PDG [1]. Not all of these states are well-established: Among these the f 0 (600) [or σ] and the f 0 (1370) have large uncertainties on their mass and decay widths, as well as the K ∗ 0 (800) [or κ] which has been particularly under a special scrutiny and debate. It is now generally believed that the states below 1 GeV are something other than pure qq states, as opposed to those above 1 GeV which have been the favored candidates for <b>a</b> <b>qq</b> nonet, even though some of their properties do not quite follow <b>a</b> <b>qq</b> assignment. Possible solutions for the status of the lowest-lying scalar states include the MIT bag model, KK molecule and unitarized quark model, as well as many recent investigations (see [2] for a selection of refs.).

Lattice QCD {{predictions}} have motivated {{several recent}} studies of the mixing between the pre-dicted JPC = 0 ++ glueball and <b>a</b> <b>qq</b> ̄ nonet in the 1. 3 → 1. 7 GeV region. We show that results from apparently different approaches have some common features, explain {{why this is so}} and abstract general conclusions. We place particular emphasis on the flavour dependent constraints imposed by decays of the f 0 (1370), f 0 (1500) and f 0 (1700) to all pairs of pseudoscalar mesons. From these results we identify a systematic correlation between glueball mass, mixing, and flavour symmetry breaking and conclude that the glueball may be rather lighter than some quenched lattice QCD computations have suggested. We identify experimental tests that can determine the dynamics of a glueball in this mass region and discuss quantitatively the feasibility of decoding glueball-qq ̄ mixing. ...|$|R
