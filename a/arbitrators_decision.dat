40|$|This paper surveys cases under California law {{in which}} {{commercial}} arbitration awards have been reviewed for errors {{of law and}} proposes a coherent approach to judicial review of alleged errors of law in commercial arbitration awards. Both of the following issues will be addressed: 1. When and how courts should decide whether parties to an arbitration agreement have reserved <b>arbitrator</b> <b>decisions</b> on points of law for judicial review. 2. Whether and, if so, when and by what standard courts should review <b>arbitrator</b> <b>decisions</b> on points of law when the parties have not agreed to reserve such issues for review...|$|R

5000|$|In the United States, {{the federal}} {{government}} has expressed a policy of support of arbitration clauses, because they reduce the burden on court systems to resolve disputes. This support is found in the Federal Arbitration Act, which permits compulsory and binding arbitration, under which parties give up the right to appeal an <b>arbitrator's</b> <b>decision</b> to a court. In Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood & Conklin Mfg. Co., the U.S. Supreme Court established the [...] "separability principle", under which enforceability of a contract must be challenged in arbitration before any court action, unless the arbitration clause itself has been challenged.|$|R

30|$|To {{illustrate}} this {{role of the}} arbitrator this section employs a model of collaborative production with imperfect contracting. For a meta-organization, {{a joint venture between}} two parties is assumed and the effort levels are represented by the investments in the joint venture. In a first step the joint venture with a unanimous sharing rule is illustrated. Then an arbitrator is introduced who is able to observe the investment levels and who allocates the shares of the surplus by the means of a contest. Since this allocation is enforceable in court, the <b>arbitrator’s</b> <b>decision</b> marks the parties’ outside option and hence their bargaining power over the surplus.|$|R

30|$|Because of its private nature, {{the results}} of arbitrated {{disputes}} in meta-organizations are usually not published. This makes it nearly impossible to provide a comprehensive empirical overview of those disputes.

They fall into two broad categories: On the one hand conflicts about the distribution of the surplus (profit or other benefits) that the joint venture had produced {{and on the other hand}} disagreement about the contributions a party made to the joint venture. Each example concludes with the <b>arbitrator’s</b> <b>decision</b> and his characteristics as third party decision maker. These characteristics will then serve in a stylized manner as a basis for the formal analysis.|$|R

5000|$|Toy {{manufacturer}} Mattel was sued by its landlord Hall Street Associates in {{a dispute}} over a property lease, the property being a former View-Master factory in Beaverton, Oregon. After the litigation went to federal court both parties agreed to resolve the case by arbitration according to the procedures outlined in the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). Atypically, the parties' arbitration agreement stipulated that the District Court could override the <b>arbitrator's</b> <b>decision</b> if [...] "the arbitrator's conclusions of law are erroneous." [...] This provision of the agreement granted the federal courts a much broader role in supervising the arbitration than is specifically granted in the FAA. The Act explicitly mentions only a narrow set of circumstances under which courts can override an arbitration award, such as corruption, partiality, or misbehavior {{on the part of the}} arbitrator.|$|R
6000|$|All this {{is perhaps}} a trifle abstruse; let us, then, look at {{arbitration}} more nearly; in our time it is, in form at least something new. It began as [...] "international arbitration," [...] which already, in settling a few disputes of no great importance, has shown itself a dangerous remedy. In the necessary negotiation to determine exactly what points to submit to whom, and how, and where, and when to submit them, and how {{to carry out the}} <b>arbitrator's</b> <b>decision,</b> scores of questions are raised, upon each of which it is as easy to disagree and fight as upon the original issue. International arbitration may be defined as the substitution of many burning questions for a smouldering one; for disputes that have reached a really acute stage are not submitted. The animosities that it has kindled have been hotter than those it has quenched.|$|R
30|$|If m is {{very small}} (e.g. 0.1), then the third party’s {{decision}} is very inelastic. This means, that the arbitrator departs only marginally from a 50 : 50 sharing of the surplus even if the investment levels differ dramatically and hence the contest sets only limited additional incentives to invest. 11 On the contrary, if m is very large, then the elasticity of the <b>arbitrator’s</b> <b>decision</b> is very high. High decision elasticity indicates that the third party significantly alters {{the division of the}} surplus even if there are only minimal differences in the investment levels. Thus, high decision elasticity implies that the contest provides strong additional investment incentives. Because of this relation between the mass effect parameter and the decision elasticity, it determines the intensity of the investment incentives that the contest creates. Therefore, the mass effect is an important parameter for the decision maker to set in order to balance the investment incentives of the joint venture.|$|R
50|$|If the {{contract}} contains a valid arbitration clause, the aggrieved party must submit an arbitration claim {{in accordance with}} the procedures set forth in the clause. Many contracts provide that all disputes arising thereunder will be resolved by arbitration, rather than litigated in courts, partly because arbitration awards are recognized and enforceable internationally under the New York Convention, which has 156 parties. Arbitration judgments may generally be enforced {{in the same manner as}} ordinary court judgments. However, in New York Convention states, arbitral decisions are generally immune unless there is a showing that the <b>arbitrator's</b> <b>decision</b> was irrational or tainted by fraud. Not all disputes regarding contract claims can be resolved in arbitration however, especially regarding validity of registered IP rights, or if they implicate a public interest that goes beyond the narrow interests of the parties to the agreement like claims that a party violated a contract by engaging in illegal anti-competitive conduct or civil rights violations.|$|R

50|$|Jack R. Lorraine and Beverly Mack had a yacht {{that was}} damaged by lightning. While Markel American Insurance Company already awarded costs for repair, more damage {{was found at}} a later stage when the yacht {{was removed from the}} water. In order to assess the {{additional}} damages, both parties entered into an arbitration agreement to assess if these damages were also due to the lightning strike. While both parties seek to confirm and enforce the <b>arbitrator’s</b> <b>decision,</b> this case comes forth from the ambiguous language used in the arbitration agreement regarding the authority of the arbitrator. Where Lorraine (plaintiff) argues that he is entitled to the sum of $36,000 as {{it was found that the}} damages came indeed from the lightning strike, Markel (defendant) argues that they acknowledge the damages to be reimbursed, but only to a limit of $14,000 as recommended by the arbitrator. Both parties moved for summary judgment, providing documentary evidence in the form of the arbitration agreement, award, and copies of e-mail correspondence between counsel.|$|R
5000|$|Pendulum arbitration, {{otherwise}} known as final offer arbitration (or [...] "FOA"), {{is a type of}} interest arbitration in which the arbitrator chooses one of the parties' proposals on each (or perhaps all) disputed issues. For example, in the case of labor collective bargaining, a trade union may demand a wage increase of 7% and the management may offer 3%. The <b>arbitrator's</b> <b>decision</b> has to choose between awarding a 3% or a 7% increase. This procedure is opposed to conventional interest arbitration, in which the parties present evidence and the arbitrator acts as fact-finder and crafts an award. In disputes over labor contracts, this dispute resolution procedure is known to be a common type of contract arbitration. Perhaps the most well-known instance is salary arbitration in Major League Baseball, where a certain class of players may elect to arbitrate their salary instead of accepting their team's salary offer. Final-offer arbitration is widely used to determine public union contracts in the United States, either as a substitute for collective bargaining or as a mechanism to determine the contract when bargaining has failed.|$|R
40|$|Grievance {{arbitration}} {{is one of}} {{the fundamental}} cornerstones of the North American industrial relations system. Through a hearing process less formal than a court proceeding, an arbitrator interprets an existing collective agreement and applies its provisions to a particular set of facts to resolve differences between the union and the employer. Enshrined in Canadian labour law as a requirement in all collective agreements (and included almost universally by practice in the United States), a grievance arbitration decision is intended to be final and binding, providing the parties with a timely interpretation of their contract. The same labour relations statutes that establish arbitration as “final and binding”, may expressly permit either the union or the employer to challenge the arbitration outcome by applying for court review. The court may uphold the arbitration decision, amend or overturn it, or refer it back to the arbitrator. Clearly, therefore, grievance arbitration is not final and binding if the <b>arbitrator’s</b> <b>decision</b> is subject to another level of review. Judicial review can add months and significant costs to the entire grievance resolution process. Court decisions can also have a significant impac...|$|R

A central tenet of conflict resolution theory and practice in employment relations, the legal arena, and elsewhere has been that a voluntary settlement among disputants with a continuing relationship is better than an imposed one.

The day after the hearing, on August 2, it was announced that Subban and the Habs had agreed to terms on an eight-year, $72 million contract, running through the 2021-22 season.
