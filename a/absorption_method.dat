25|$|Rice {{is cooked}} by boiling or steaming, and absorbs water during cooking. With the <b>absorption</b> <b>method,</b> rice may be cooked in {{a volume of}} water similar to the volume of rice. With the rapid-boil method, rice may be cooked in a large {{quantity}} of water which is drained before serving. Rapid-boil preparation is not desirable with enriched rice, {{as much of the}} enrichment additives are lost when the water is discarded. Electric rice cookers, popular in Asia and Latin America, simplify the process of cooking rice. Rice (or any other grain) is sometimes quickly fried in oil or fat before boiling (for example saffron rice or risotto); this makes the cooked rice less sticky, and is a cooking style commonly called pilaf in Iran and Afghanistan or biryani (Dam-pukhtak) in India and Pakistan.|$|E

40|$|Spectroscopy, {{kinetics}} {{and dynamics}} of jet cooled hydrocarbon transients {{relevant to the}} DOE combustion mission have been explored, exploiting i) high resolution IR lasers, ii) slit discharge sources for formation of jet cooled radicals, and iii) high sensitivity detection with direct laser <b>absorption</b> <b>methods</b> and near the quantum shot noise limit. What makes this combination powerful is that such transients can be made under high concentrations and pressures characteristic of actual combustion conditions, and yet with the resulting species rapidly cooled (T ≈ 10 - 15 K) in the slit supersonic expansion. Combined {{with the power of}} IR laser <b>absorption</b> <b>methods,</b> this provides novel access to spectral detection and study of many critical combustion species...|$|R

40|$|Monte Carlo {{simulation}} {{is often}} used to solve radiative transfer problems where complex physical phenomena and geometries must be handled. Slow convergence is a well known disadvantage of such methods. In this paper we demonstrate that a significant improvement in computation time can be achieved by using Quasi-Monte Carlo methods to simulate Rapid Thermal Processing, which is an important technique for the production of semiconductor wafers, as well as many other industrial processes. Several factors are considered including surface absorptivity, position of wafer surface to heat source, and choice of quasi-random sequence. A comparison of the fractional and discrete <b>absorption</b> <b>methods</b> is also made. Results show accelerated convergence and improved accuracy of QMC over the standard Monte Carlo approach, and indicate when the fractional and discrete <b>absorption</b> <b>methods</b> should be used to obtain optimal results.

50|$|The second uniwave {{method is}} the <b>absorption</b> <b>method,</b> and it {{involves}} two tuned circuits and a single-pole, double-throw, make-before-break key. When {{the key is}} down, the arc {{is connected to the}} tuned antenna coil and antenna. When the key is up, the arc is connected to a tuned dummy antenna called the back shunt. The back shunt was a second tuned circuit consisting of an inductor, a capacitor, and load resistor in series. This second circuit is tuned to roughly the same frequency as the transmitted frequency; it keeps the arc running, and it absorbs the transmitter power. The <b>absorption</b> <b>method</b> is apparently due to W. A. Eaton.|$|E
50|$|In 1954, Techtron {{moved to}} small cottages in Market St. South Melbourne, and in 1957, won a tender to build {{electronics}} modules for Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometers (AAS) to CSIRO specifications.

50|$|The {{design of}} {{switching}} circuit for the <b>absorption</b> <b>method</b> is significant. It is switching a high voltage arc, so the switch's contacts {{must have some}} form of arc suppression. Eaton had the telegraph key drive electromagnets that operated a relay. That relay used four sets of switch contacts in series for each of the two paths (one to the antenna and one to the back shunt). Each relay contact was bridged by a resistor. Consequently, the switch was never completely open, but {{there was a lot of}} attenuation.|$|E

50|$|Plain steamed white rice, to {{be served}} with side dishes of meat or vegetables, is {{typically}} prepared with an electric rice cooker at home. Some households and food establishments prefer to cook rice on a stove top with the <b>absorption</b> <b>method</b> or the rapid-boil method. Compressed rice, called nasi himpit, is another method of preparing and cooking rice: the rice is wrapped with fronds or leaves and compressed into {{the form of a}} cylinder, which is then cooked by boiling. The rice would compress and merge during the cooking process. Compressed rice is usually eaten cold with some sort of gravy, although it may be served warm in a broth or soup. A notable variant of compressed rice prepared by the Bugis community is burasak: rice is precooked with coconut milk before it is wrapped in banana leaves and steamed until fully cooked.|$|E
50|$|Microwave rice cookers {{can also}} be used for cooking Japanese rice, or medium- or short grain rice, but the <b>{{absorption}}</b> <b>method</b> should be used. The rice is washed well to remove starch and allowed to stand to absorb water for at least 15 min before cooking. The water absorption step is essential, otherwise the cooking may result in cooked rice which is still too hard. The regular amount of water as the conventional cooking method can be used. The container is placed in the microwave and it is brought up to the boil at high power. Then, it can be cooked at low or low-medium power until all the water is evaporated (about 20 min - 30 min, depending on the rice type) and not much steam is coming out. The container is then left to stand for 5 min before the rice is stirred for serving.|$|E

50|$|The rice is {{measured}} {{and added to}} the inner bowl or washed {{in a separate bowl}} in order to remove loosened starch and residual bran. It is not recommended to wash rice in the inner bowl itself so as to preserve the non-stick surface. Strainers are often used in the washing and draining process. For better texture and taste, some types of rice, e.g., Japanese rice or Calrose rice which is suited for <b>absorption</b> <b>method,</b> require pre-cooking water absorption. The water absorption step typically involves letting the rice stand for at least 5 min after draining water from the washing step and soaking the rice in the measured water for at least 15 min (or some claim it to be 1 hour) before cooking. The water draining step is colloquially believed to make the water measurement more accurate, if the water {{is measured}} and added after the initial water absorption that takes place in the washing step. Some people prefer to achieve the water absorption by simply leaving the rice soaking in the rice cooker overnight before starting cooking in the morning. Some other types of rice, e.g., long-grain rice or scented rice such as jasmine rice, do not require washing or the water absorption step. The water for cooking is added to the inner bowl by using measuring cups or simply filling up to the appropriate graduated mark in the inner bowl. Although cold water is normally added, boiling water is used for cooking sushi rice.|$|E

The soaking methods, respectively, showed approximately 2. 4 x and 21. 7 x higher encapsulation and loading efficiencies than the conventional method.
