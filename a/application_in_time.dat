40|$|International audienceThe {{application}} of wall acoustic lining {{is a major}} factor in the reduction of aircraft engine noise.

Its <b>application</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> domain CAA methods by means of z-transform has been the subject of several papers. In contrast to standard liner modeling in time domain CAA, which consists in imposing a boundary condition modeling both the cavities and the perforated sheet of the liner, an alternative approach involves adding the cavities to the computational domain and imposing a condition between these cavities and the duct domain to model the resistive sheet. However, the original method may not be used for broadband acoustics since it implements an impedance condition with frequency independent resistance.

In semiparametric mixture models, however, the algorithm fails to account for any uncertainty in the additional unknown structural parameter.

We call this the predictive recursion marginal likelihood. Convergence properties of predictive recursion under model mis-specification also lead to an attractive construction of this new procedure. We show pointwise convergence of a normalized version of this marginal likelihood function. Simulations compare the performance of this new marginal likelihood approach that of existing profile likelihood methods as well as Dirichlet process mixtures in density estimation.
