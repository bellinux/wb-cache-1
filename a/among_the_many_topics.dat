He made numerous contributions to geometry, calculus and algebra. For example, he was a pioneer of the calculus of aberrancy. Transon's parabola is named for him. Transon's theorem states that the effect of any analytjc transformation upon an infinitesimal region is the same as that of a projective transformation. <b>Among</b> <b>the</b> <b>many</b> <b>topics</b> he worked on was Fermat's last theorem. He complained: [...] "I am tormented by two maladies, my rheumatism and my Fermatism." [...] In 1845, he married Félicie Desnoyers. In 1849 Transon had the first serious bout of rheumatism, an ailment that plagued him the rest of his life. He also developed a heart condition as well as arteriosclerosis, according to the physician Pellarin. Charles Pellarin, in his Notice sur Jules Lechevalier et Abel Transon (1877), contrasts Transon's nervous, artistic temperament and sincere piety with Lechevalier's expansive love of the finer things, and attributes a certain lack of psychological freedom on Transon's part to his 'religious distraction.' Pellarin draws an affectionate portrait of Transon and his wife as very charitable. In the late 1860s, Transon was informed that the aged and ailing socialist Pierre Leroux was in financial distress. Transon arranged to purchase all of Leroux' publications. When Leroux found out who the buyer was, he visited Transon and said: [...] "My dear Transon, I know you have neither need of, nor interest in, my books, but I divine the intention, thank you." [...] Transon protested that, even though their ideas were very different, the works of a man of such value as Leroux were always interesting, and that he was curious about his book on Job.|$|E

One of the unique features of the PHENIX detector is the muon tracking and identification system. No other RHIC experiment has a muon detection capability. <b>Among</b> <b>the</b> <b>many</b> physics <b>topics</b> explored by the observation of muons in Au-Au collisions are the effects of Debye screening on vector meson production, and the search for an enhancement in strangeness and heavy flavor production. In the collisions of polarized protons, the muon arms can explore the polarization of quarks and gluons in the proton through W boson production, the Drell-Yan process, and open heavy flavor production. The muon detector system covers the rapidity range − 2. 2 < y < − 1. 2 for the south arm and 1. 2 < y < 2. 4 for the north arm, with full azimuthal coverage. The detector provides muon tracking and identification in the momentum range 2 < p < 50 GeV, and π/μ rejection of 10 − 4. The south muon arm was completed in 2001 for the second RHIC running period. The performance of the muon spectrometer during its first data taking period will be discussed. The production cross section for J /ψ in proton-proton collisions at s = 200 GeV is measured. The measured value is in good agreement with the color evaporation model and QCD predictions.

40|$|<b>Among</b> <b>the</b> <b>many</b> {{interesting}} <b>topics</b> in <b>the</b> {{field of}} Wood Science and Technology {{is a fascinating}} story about research and development on drying wood products with high-frequency electric current. Historically, it {{can be traced back}} over decades. Heat transfer to and evaporation of moisture from wood may be accomplished with high frequency current depending on its dielectric properties. Because wood is generally heterogeneous, these properties vary not only with the frequency of the current and the field orientation, but also with the moisture content, temperature, and density of wood. Considering these parameters and the specific heat of the material, estimates of power absorption can be made. In an attempt to develop this technology, research covered many products from paper and veneer to lumber and heavy timbers. Much emphasis, however, has been placed on wood species and/or products with larger dimensions that are difficult or impossible to dry when using conventional drying methods. The advantages of employing dielectric heating were found to be rapid and fairly uniform heat transfer often to solidly stacked timbers, very high drying rates, and avoidance of various drying defects including any significant case-hardening and oxidative discoloration of the wood. During the last two decades, the development focused mainly on drying lumber in vacuum kilns using dielectric heating, often termed high-frequency/vacuum drying. It has been justified economically on the basis of increased throughput and higher quality. Existing industrial installations provide a positive picture for higher value products. The economics should improve with advances in available equipment, better basic understanding and more practical experience with industrial units now operating. Also, the combination of high-frequency/vacuum drying with other systems, such as moisture leveling after primary drying or pre-heating prior to the high-frequency/vacuum step, hold promise for further technical improvemen...|$|R

This study was aimed at resolving identified Nigerian students’ learning difficulties in NC using simulated computer animation teaching strategies. A sample of 63 SSIII (grade 12) students who have been identified as indicating widespread learning difficulties in NC were exposed to 4 weeks of instruction on NC concepts using computer simulation animation strategies. The sample (35 females and 28 males) were in 4 intact classes in 4 public secondary schools in Calabar Municipal Area Council, South - South zone of Nigeria. The instrument for data collection was a 30 -item short-answer essay test called Nuclear Chemistry Learning Difficulties Diagnostic Test (NCLDDT). Data was analysed using frequency and percentage.

40|$|The {{study of}} multiferroics and in {{particular}} the magnetoelectric couplin g is nowadays a new focus <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>many</b> hot <b>topics</b> in physics. The prom ising future of multiferroic materials lies in the coexistence of tradit ionally uncorrelated properties and the existence of a sizable coupling between them. Multiferroics provide a possibility to control one primary order by means of another primary order and create devices that are sui table for special conditions or can create multifunctionality. However, it is difficult to find multiferroicity due to the incompatiblity of fer romagnetism and ferroelectricity. The mechanism to establish magnetoelec tric coupling is always exotic and varying. Although there have been imp ortant research findings in multiferroics, such as lone-pair based multi ferroics, spin-driven ferroelectricity and multiferroic composites, etc, the field is far from mature yet, and the limitations lie both in the f abrication process as well as the complex measurement methods for charac terizing the magnetoelectrical properties. In this thesis, we achieved a structure consisting of Co atoms and Co na noparticles embedded in a crystalline ZnO thin film, aiming at finding m ultiferroicity and novel magnetotransport in such a nanocomposite system. We fabricated the system by pulsed laser deposition of ZnO followed by high-fluence Co ion implantation. The structural properties were charac terized by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and X-ray absorption fine structure measurements. The majority of Co exists in th e matrix in an oxidized state (i. e. can be treated as a so-called (Zn,Co) O matrix). On the other hand, crystallized nanosize Co particles were f ound to be embedded in the (Zn,Co) O thin films, in which the thin film s till keeps good crystallinity. In such a complex nanocomposite system, t he electrical properties were studied by means of a helium- 4 flow cryost at with a superconducting magnet down to 2. 5 K. The low-temperature resi stance of the films followed the Efros-Shklovskii type variable-range-ho pping. Magnetoresistance revealed a spin-dependent signature that surviv es up to 250 K. Negative magnetoresistance exceeding 10 % was observed at a magnetic field of 1 T. The magnetic properties were characterized by superconducting quantum interference device magnetometry. The composite reveals a characteristic superparamagnetic behavior, which is consistent with the presence of metallic Co nanoparticles. In addition, in some ca ses we observed exchange bias in the ZnO-Co system. This exchange bias e ffect constitutes, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, the first time observat ion of this effect in the ZnO-Co system. Temperature dependent dielectric constant measurements revealed relaxor ferroelectricity, which was further confirmed by polarization measuremen ts. The combination of the polarization measurement with a cryomagnetic system allowed us to determine the magnetoelectric coupling properties. A remarkable magnetoelectric coupling showed up when measuring the polar ization curve under an applied magnetic field. The unexpected relaxor fe rroelectricty is believed to be the result of the local lattice distorti on induced by the incorporation of the Co nanoparticles. status: publishe...|$|R
