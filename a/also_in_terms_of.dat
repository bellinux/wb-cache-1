5|$|How the Scots Invented the Modern World: The True Story of How Western Europe's Poorest Nation Created Our World & Everything in It (or The Scottish Enlightenment: The Scots {{invention}} of the Modern World) is a non-fiction book written by American historian Arthur Herman. The book examines {{the origins of the}} Scottish Enlightenment and what impact it had on the modern world. Following the Great Man approach, Herman focuses on individuals and presents their biographies {{in the context of their}} individual fields and <b>also</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> the theme of Scottish contributions to the world.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The {{combination}} of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) signal processing with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) using Cyclic Prefix (CP) {{is regarded as}} a highly promising solution to achieving the data rates of next-generation wireless communication systems operating in frequency selective fading environments. In this paper, we propose a novel detection scheme for MIMO based transmission that combines the adaptive MMSE [1] detection scheme with a priori information and parallel interference cancellation (PIC) in the spatial domain. Simulation results show interesting gain <b>in</b> <b>term</b> <b>of</b> BER performance and <b>also</b> <b>in</b> <b>term</b> <b>of</b> complexity because the BER performance can be adapted in function of the number of iteration that we set-up for the adaptive MMSE detection.

25|$|Yokneam {{is a very}} green city. Not just {{in terms}} of {{ecological}} activism, but <b>also</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> its physical surroundings. Roughly two-thirds of the land within Yokneam's city limits are green space (parks, archeological digs, gardens, playgrounds). It has five major public parks, and outdoor amphitheater and over 80 playgrounds distributed throughout the city. Tel Yokneam, which includes the ruins of a crusader church and its intricate water system, is used as an educational site where Yokneam's school children perform restoration work {{under the direction of the}} Antiquities Authority and the National Parks Authority.|$|E
25|$|Thermoeconomics {{is based}} on the {{proposition}} that the role of energy in biological evolution should be defined and understood through the second law of thermodynamics, but <b>also</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> such economic criteria as productivity, efficiency, and especially the costs and benefits (or profitability) of the various mechanisms for capturing and utilizing available energy to build biomass and do work. As a result, thermoeconomics is often discussed in the field of ecological economics, which itself is related to the fields of sustainability and sustainable development.|$|E
25|$|<b>Also,</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> {{population}} clusters, the County {{is divided}} by a {{vast expanse of}} federal land in the midsection of the county, much of which is densely wooded park land, and military training areas. The southern portion of the County is dense with suburban developments and contains {{the majority of the}} county's population. There is little room for additional growth in the southern portion of York County because it is a relatively small area, and was essentially fully developed by the early 2000s. A small industrial area along the York River just East of Yorktown contains a power plant owned by Dominion Virginia Power, and a petroleum terminal on the former site of an oil refinery that ceased operation in 2010.|$|E

The choice Q^C=S^A is extremely strong because we can expect S^A {{to be a good}} approximation of S^F, not only <b>in</b> <b>term</b> <b>of</b> stiffness (a^A vs a^F) but <b>also</b> <b>in</b> <b>term</b> <b>of</b> load (l^A vs l^F) which corresponds to providing a good initialization to the algorithm.|$|R
25|$|The {{result of}} the battle was an {{overwhelming}} Spanish victory, {{not only in terms}} of casualties in favour to the Spaniards, <b>also</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> immediate strategic consequences. The position of Francis, Duke of Anjou, became impossible to hold with the States-General of the Netherlands, and he eventually left the Low Countries in late June. The defeat and the end of the Treaty of Plessis-les-Tours was a severe blow to the Dutch Protestants and discredited William of Orange, his main supporter. Moreover, the Spanish progress was unstoppable, and the Prince of Parma moved to Dunkirk, city blocked by the forces of the Spanish commander Don Cristóbal de Mondragón. On July 16, the bombardment began, and a few days later, the city surrendered to the Spaniards, along with Nieuwpoort on July 23.|$|E
25|$|Another major {{component}} of central government expenditure in Scotland is on healthcare and healthcare related services. The National Health Service (NHS) is the publicly controlled provider {{of the majority of}} healthcare in Scotland, with the NHS being a major employer not only in terms of; doctors, nurses, and other key healthcare workers, but <b>also</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> administration. The service is administered differently {{from the rest of the}} United Kingdom and is largely free at the point of use to residents in Scotland, except for dental and optical services where those over 18 must pay. In the short term spending on healthcare in Scotland remains high in response to the population's poor diet and high instance of heart disease. In the medium to long term, the challenges of an ageing population are likely to increase demand for health services and put increasing pressure on the health service in Scotland.|$|E
25|$|Public {{intervention}} in collective health problems {{has always been}} of interest to governments and societies, especially in the control of epidemics through the establishment of naval quarantines, the closing of city walls and prohibitions on travel in times of plague, but <b>also</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> hygienic and palliative measures. Al-Andalus—Muslim-ruled medieval Spain—was distinguished by its level of medical knowledge relative {{to the rest of}} Europe, particularly among the physicians of the Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain. In the years after the Reconquista, the Real Tribunal del Protomedicato regulated the practice of medicine in Spain and in its colonies. However, the system of medical faculties at the various universities was very decentralized. Surgery and pharmacy were quite separate from medicine and were considerably less prestigious; the systems of Galen and Hippocrates dominated medical practice during most of the era of the Antiguo Régimen.|$|E

25|$|For a time, McManaman {{held the}} record for most {{consecutive}} Premier League appearances as an ever-present at Liverpool for four seasons including a club record for most appearances, {{and at the time}} of leaving the Premiership had the second highest ratio of Premier League assists per game, with 112 assists in 272 appearances, with a total of 142 assists for the club; an average of one assist per two-and-a-half games. As of 2011–12, McManaman holds the 14th position on the Premiership's All Time Assists charts. Until 2011, McManaman held {{the record for}} greatest number of assists in Liverpool history, ahead of Steven Gerrard, who has since overtaken him. McManaman is also ranked fifth on the Premier League all-time assists charts for number of games it took to hit 100 assists, and <b>also</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> being the fifth youngest player to hit 100 assists in Premier League history, with only Thierry Henry, Cesc Fàbregas, Ryan Giggs and David Beckham above him on the list.|$|E
25|$|So {{rather than}} treat {{the issue as}} a rich text problem of glyph alternates, Unicode added the concept of {{variation}} selectors, first introduced in version 3.2 and supplemented in version 4.0. While variation selectors are treated as combining characters, they have no associated diacritic or mark. Instead, by combining with a base character, they signal the two character sequence selects a variation (typically in terms of grapheme, but <b>also</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> underlying meaning {{as in the case}} of a location name or other proper noun) of the base character. This then is not a selection of an alternate glyph, but the selection of a grapheme variation or a variation of the base abstract character. Such a two-character sequence however can be easily mapped to a separate single glyph in modern fonts. Since Unicode has assigned 256 separate variation selectors, it is capable of assigning 256 variations for any Han ideograph. Such variations can be specific to one language or another and enable the encoding of plain text that includes such grapheme variations.|$|E
25|$|Minimum wage rates {{vary greatly}} across many {{different}} jurisdictions, {{not only in}} setting a particular amount of money—for example $7.25 per hour ($14,500 per year) under certain US state laws (or $2.13 for employees who receive tips, which {{is known as the}} tipped minimum wage), $9.47 in the US state of Washington, or £7.50 (for those aged 25+) in the United Kingdom—but <b>also</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> which pay period (for example Russia and China set monthly minimum wages) or the scope of coverage. Currently the American federal minimum wage rests at seven dollars, twenty-five cents ($7.25) per hour. However, some states do not recognize the minimum wage law such as Louisiana and Tennessee. Other states operate below the federal minimum wage such as Georgia and Wyoming. Some jurisdictions even allow employers to count tips given to their workers as credit towards the minimum wage levels. India {{was one of the first}} developing countries to introduce minimum wage policy. It also has one of the most complicated systems with more than 1,200 minimum wage rates.|$|E
