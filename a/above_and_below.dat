5|$|Although {{the closest}} scattered-disc objects {{approach}} the Sun at about 30–35AU, their orbits can extend well beyond 100AU. This makes scattered objects {{among the most}} distant and coldest objects in the Solar System. The innermost portion of the scattered disc overlaps with a torus-shaped region of orbiting objects traditionally called the Kuiper belt, but its outer limits reach much further away from the Sun and further <b>above</b> <b>and</b> <b>below</b> the ecliptic than the Kuiper belt proper.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage for {{equipment}} and positions was extensively developed for military {{use by the}} French in 1915, soon followed by other World War I armies. In both world wars, artists were recruited as camouflage officers. Ship camouflage developed via conspicuous dazzle camouflage schemes during WWI, but since the development of radar, ship camouflage has received less attention. Aircraft, especially in World War II, were often painted with different schemes <b>above</b> <b>and</b> <b>below,</b> to camouflage them against the ground and sky respectively.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s, Walter Alvarez {{was doing}} {{geologic}} research in central Italy. There he had located an outcrop {{on the walls}} of a gorge whose limestone layers included strata both <b>above</b> <b>and</b> <b>below</b> the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary. Exactly at the boundary is a thin layer of clay. Walter told his father that the layer marked where the dinosaurs and much else became extinct and that nobody knew why, or what the clay was about — it was a big mystery and he intended to solve it.|$|E

5|$|Instead, {{a system}} of {{multiple}} receiver antennas was adopted, each one located so that only a certain section of the sky was visible. Two horizontal receivers were mounted {{on either side of}} the fuselage and only saw reflections from the left or right, slightly overlapping in the middle. Two vertical receivers were mounted <b>above</b> <b>and</b> <b>below</b> the wing, seeing reflections above or below the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Like other theridiid spiders, the web is a disorganised, {{irregular}} {{tangle of}} fine textured silk. It is hammock-shaped and {{is made up}} of opaque yellowish-white silk. The web consists of a broad base with many supporting threads <b>above</b> <b>and</b> <b>below,</b> including a number of sticky guy lines anchored to debris in the sand. A cone-shaped retreat is built in {{the lower part of the}} web, although the katipo can normally be found near the main body of the web. The plants it builds its web in provide support and shelter for the nest.|$|E
5|$|Long, highly {{sensitive}} whiskers and front paws help the sea otter find prey by touch when waters are dark or murky. Researchers have noted when they approach in plain view, sea otters react more rapidly {{when the wind}} is blowing towards the animals, indicating the sense of smell is more important than sight as a warning sense. Other observations indicate the sea otter's sense of sight is useful <b>above</b> <b>and</b> <b>below</b> the water, although not as good as that of seals. Its hearing is neither particularly acute nor poor.|$|E

5|$|Some plants, {{notably the}} grasses, use indigestible silica (and many plants use other {{relatively}} indigestible {{materials such as}} lignin) to defend themselves against vertebrate and invertebrate herbivores. Plants take up silicon from the soil and deposit it in their tissues {{in the form of}} solid silica phytoliths. These mechanically reduce the digestibility of plant tissue, causing rapid wear to vertebrate teeth and insect mandibles, and are effective against herbivores <b>above</b> <b>and</b> <b>below</b> ground. The mechanism may offer future sustainable pest control strategies.|$|E

5000|$|Words {{and the end}} of {{the first}} part of a {{compound}} are separated by a dot (point). Beyond that, punctuation is weak or non-existent in the manuscripts, and in the 1880s Karl Friedrich Geldner had to devise one for standardized transcription. In his system, which he developed based on what he could find, a triangle of three dots serves as a colon, a semicolon, an end of sentence or end of section; which is determined by the size of the dots and whether there is one dot <b>above</b> <b>and</b> two <b>below,</b> or two <b>above</b> <b>and</b> one <b>below.</b> Two <b>above</b> <b>and</b> one <b>below</b> signify — in ascending order of [...] "dot" [...] size — colon, semicolon, end of sentence or end of section. One <b>above</b> <b>and</b> two <b>below</b> signify [...] "turned end of sentence" [...] and [...] "turned end of section" [...]|$|R
5|$|The {{small size}} and {{independence}} of the laser modules allowed the huge NIF building to be dispensed with. Instead, the modules were arranged in groups surrounding the target chamber in a compact arrangement. In baseline designs, the modules were stacked in 2-wide by 8-high groups in two rings <b>above</b> <b>and</b> <b>below</b> the target chamber, shining their light through small holes drilled into the chamber {{to protect them from}} the neutron flux coming back out.|$|E
5|$|The tail appears {{naked and}} is shorter than or {{about as long}} as the head and body; it is longer in T.talamancae. Its {{coloration}} is variable; it is dark brown above and at the sides and light brown and often white to a greater or smaller extent below, and in some specimens the tail has the same color <b>above</b> <b>and</b> <b>below.</b> The scales on the tail are smaller than in T.talamancae.|$|E
5|$|H. altispinus {{shared the}} Horseshoe Canyon Formation with fellow hadrosaurids Edmontosaurus and Saurolophus, hypsilophodont Parksosaurus, ankylosaurid Anodontosaurus, nodosaurid Edmontonia, horned dinosaurs Montanoceratops, Anchiceratops, Arrhinoceratops, and Pachyrhinosaurus, pachycephalosaurid Stegoceras, ostrich-mimics Ornithomimus and Struthiomimus, {{a variety of}} poorly known small theropods {{including}} troodontids and dromaeosaurids, and the tyrannosaurs Albertosaurus and Daspletosaurus. The dinosaurs from this formation are sometimes known as Edmontonian, after a land mammal age, and are distinct {{from those in the}} formations <b>above</b> <b>and</b> <b>below.</b> The Horseshoe Canyon Formation is interpreted as having a significant marine influence, due to an encroaching Western Interior Seaway, the shallow sea that covered the midsection of North America through much of the Cretaceous. H. altispinus may have preferred to stay more landward.|$|E
