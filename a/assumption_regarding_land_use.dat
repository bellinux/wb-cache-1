40|$|Combining {{co-firing}} biomass {{and carbon}} capture and storage (CCS) in power plants offers attractive potential for net removal {{of carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) from the atmosphere. In this study, the impact of co-firing biomass (wood pellets and straw pellets) on the emission profile of power plants with {{carbon capture and storage}} has been assessed for two types of coal-fired power plants: a supercritical pulverised coal power plant (SCPC) and an integrated gasification combined cycle plant (IGCC). Besides, comparative life cycle assessments have been performed to examine the environmental impacts of the combination of co-firing biomass and CCS. Detailed calculations on mass balances of the inputs and outputs of the power plants illustrate the effect of the different content of pollutants in biomass on the capture unit. Life cycle assessment results reveal that 30 % co-firing biomass and applying CCS net negative CO 2 emissions in the order of 67 - 85 g/kWh are obtained. The impact in all other environmental categories is increased by 20 - 200 %. However, aggregation into endpoint levels shows that the decrease in CO 2 emissions more than offsets the increase in the other categories. Sensitivity analyses illustrate that results are most sensitive to parameters that affect the amount of fuel required, such as the efficiency of the power plant and <b>assumptions</b> <b>regarding</b> the supply chains of coal and biomass. Especially, <b>assumptions</b> <b>regarding</b> <b>land</b> <b>use</b> allocation and carbon debt of biomass significantly influence the environmental performance of BioCCS. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, <b>assumptions</b> <b>regarding</b> future <b>land</b> <b>use</b> {{as a key}} {{uncertainty}} is considered {{and its impact on}} risk analysis for contaminated sites is assessed. Risks are assessed for two <b>land</b> <b>use</b> scenarios (current-use industrial and future -use residential) using probabilistic models that incorporate uncertainty and variability in the exposure parameters. Residual risks are calculated for both industrial and residential cleanup standards. A Superfund site in northern California is considered. In general, for the unremediated case, the future-use residential scenarios produce larger risks (1 to 3 orders of magnitude) than current- (continued) use industrial scenarios. For the Superfund site studied, the residual risks calculated for the remedy selected was not sufficiently protective of future-use residents in that it did not meet U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) risk goals, but was protective of current-use workers, even though the cleanup criteria were based on residential use [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Computational {{models are}} {{essential}} tools for prediction and planning in water resources systems to ensure human water security and environmental health. Water systems models merely approximate the {{processes by which}} water moves through natural and built environments; their value depends on <b>assumptions</b> <b>regarding</b> climate, demand, <b>land</b> <b>use,</b> and other uncertain factors that may influence decision making. Numerical techniques to explore the role of these uncertain factors, known as diagnostic methods, can highlight opportunities to improve the accuracy of prediction as well as identify influential uncertainties to inform additional research and policy. This dissertation advances diagnostic methods for water resources models to identify (1) time-varying dominant processes driving modeled hydrologic predictions in flood forecasting, and (2) tradeoffs and vulnerabilities to changing climate and demands in regional urban water supply systems planning for drought. This work proposes diagnostic methods as {{a key element of}} a posteriori decision support, in which decision alternatives and vulnerable scenarios are identified following computational modeling and data analysis. Consistent with this theme, this work follows a multi-objective approach in which stakeholders can analyze tradeoffs between conflicting objectives as part of an iterative constructive learning process. For a spatially distributed flood forecasting model, results show that dominant uncertainties vary in space and time, and can inform model-based scientific inference as well as decision making. Similarly, the results of the urban water supply study indicate that sensitivity analysis can suggest costeffective paths to mitigate vulnerability to deeply uncertain future scenarios, for which likelihoods remain unknown or disputed. The multi-objective approach allows stakeholders to explore tradeoffs in their modeled robustness to inform intra-regional policies such as transfer contracts and shared infrastructure investments. Bridging the areas of hydrology and water systems planning is increasingly valuable, as hydrologic modelers begin to incorporate anthropogenic influences on the water cycle, and water systems planners begin to explore uncertainty in hydrologic process representation. In summary, this work develops diagnostic methods to identify time-varying dominant processes in distributed flood forecasting as well as tradeoffs and vulnerabilities under change in regional urban water supply, ultimately seeking to improve model-based planning for extreme floods and droughts in water resources systems...|$|R
