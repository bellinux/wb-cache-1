5|$|<b>A</b> <b>gene</b> is a {{sequence}} of DNA that contains genetic information and can influence the phenotype of an organism. Within <b>a</b> <b>gene,</b> the sequence of bases along a DNA strand defines a messenger RNA sequence, which then defines one or more protein sequences. The relationship between the nucleotide sequences of genes and the amino-acid sequences of proteins {{is determined by the}} rules of translation, known collectively as the genetic code. The genetic code consists of three-letter 'words' called codons formed from {{a sequence}} of three nucleotides (e.g. ACT, CAG, TTT).|$|E
5|$|Defining {{exactly what}} {{section of a}} DNA {{sequence}} comprises <b>a</b> <b>gene</b> is difficult. Regulatory regions of <b>a</b> <b>gene</b> such as enhancers do not necessarily have {{to be close to}} the coding sequence on the linear molecule because the intervening DNA can be looped out to bring the gene and its regulatory region into proximity. Similarly, a gene's introns can be much larger than its exons. Regulatory regions can even be on entirely different chromosomes and operate in trans to allow regulatory regions on one chromosome to come in contact with target genes on another chromosome.|$|E
5|$|Mutations are {{changes in}} the DNA {{sequence}} of a cell's genome. When mutations occur, they may alter the product of <b>a</b> <b>gene,</b> or prevent the gene from functioning, or have no effect. Based on studies in the fly Drosophila melanogaster, {{it has been suggested}} that if a mutation changes a protein produced by <b>a</b> <b>gene,</b> this will probably be harmful, with about 70% of these mutations having damaging effects, and the remainder being either neutral or weakly beneficial.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background At least 18 replication-dependent histone H 2 <b>a</b> <b>genes</b> are {{distributed}} in 3 Hist gene clusters on different chromosomes {{of the mouse}} genome. In this analysis we designed specific PCR primers for each histone H 2 a transcript and studied the expression levels and patterns using quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). In addition, we compared histone H 3 K 9 acetylation levels in the promoter regions of H 2 <b>a</b> <b>genes</b> by ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation) – quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis. Results RT-PCR analysis indicated that all 20 histone H 2 <b>a</b> <b>genes</b> assessed {{in this study are}} expressed. The replication-dependent histone H 2 <b>a</b> <b>genes</b> have different expression levels but similar expression patterns. Among the 20 histone H 2 <b>a</b> <b>genes,</b> the expression-level of H 2 afz, <b>a</b> replication-independent <b>gene,</b> was highest, and that of Hist 1 h 2 aa, <b>a</b> replication-dependent <b>gene,</b> was lowest. Among 18 replication-dependent H 2 <b>a</b> <b>genes,</b> the expression level of Hist 3 h 2 a was highest. The ChIP-qPCR analysis showed that histone H 3 K 9 acetylation levels in promoter regions of both H 2 afz and Hist 3 h 2 a are clearly higher than that in the promoter region of Hist 1 h 2 aa. The H 3 K 9 acetylation level in the promoter of Hist 1 h 2 aa is similar to that in the γ-satellite region. Conclusion These results strongly suggest that histone H 3 K 9 acetylation plays a role in the expression of histone genes. </p...|$|R
40|$|We propose <b>a</b> {{representation}} for <b>gene</b> expression data called conserved {{gene expression}} motifs or xmotifs. <b>A</b> <b>gene's</b> expression level is conserved across {{a set of}} samples if the gene is expressed with the same abundance in all the samples. <b>A</b> conserved <b>gene</b> expression motif is <b>a</b> subset of <b>genes</b> that is simultaneously conserved across a subset of samples...|$|R
3000|$|For {{any given}} pair, <b>gene</b> <b>A</b> and <b>gene</b> B, the MR is {{calculated}} as {{an average of}} the rank of gene B in the coexpressed <b>genes</b> to <b>gene</b> <b>A</b> and {{the average of the}} rank of <b>gene</b> <b>A</b> to <b>gene</b> B. We selected the coexpressed gene in each experiment by MR[*]<[*] 10 ([...] Additional file 1, Table 3).|$|R
5|$|The {{concept of}} <b>a</b> <b>gene</b> {{continues}} to be refined as new phenomena are discovered. For example, regulatory regions of <b>a</b> <b>gene</b> can be far removed from its coding regions, and coding regions can be split into several exons. Some viruses store their genome in RNA instead of DNA and some gene products are functional non-coding RNAs. Therefore, a broad, modern working definition of <b>a</b> <b>gene</b> is any discrete locus of heritable, genomic sequence which affect an organism's traits by being expressed as a functional product or by regulation of gene expression.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} source of new genes in {{eukaryotic}} lineages is gene duplication, which creates copy number variation {{of an existing}} gene in the genome. The resulting genes (paralogs) may then diverge in sequence and in function. Sets of genes formed in this way comprise <b>a</b> <b>gene</b> family. Gene duplications and losses within a family are common and represent {{a major source of}} evolutionary biodiversity. Sometimes, gene duplication may result in a nonfunctional copy of <b>a</b> <b>gene,</b> or a functional copy may be subject to mutations that result in loss of function; such nonfunctional genes are called pseudogenes.|$|E
5|$|The {{structure}} of <b>a</b> <b>gene</b> consists of many elements {{of which the}} actual protein coding sequence is often only a small part. These include DNA regions that are not transcribed as well as untranslated regions of the RNA.|$|E
25|$|Genes are {{connected}} to enzyme-catalyzed reactions by Boolean expressions known as Gene-Protein-Reaction expressions (GPR). Typically a GPR takes the form (<b>Gene</b> <b>A</b> AND <b>Gene</b> B) {{to indicate that the}} products of <b>genes</b> <b>A</b> and B are protein sub-units that assemble to form the complete protein and therefore the absence of either would result in deletion of the reaction. On the other hand, if the GPR is (<b>Gene</b> <b>A</b> OR <b>Gene</b> B) it implies that the products of <b>genes</b> <b>A</b> and B are isozymes.|$|R
40|$|H 2 A. F/Z histones are conserved {{variants}} that diverged {{from major}} H 2 A proteins early in evolution, suggesting they perform an important function distinct from major H 2 A proteins. Antisera specific for hv 1, the H 2 A. F/Z {{variant of the}} ciliated protozoan Tetrahymena thermophila, cross-react with proteins from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, no H 2 A. F/Z variant {{has been reported in}} this budding yeast species. We sought to distinguish among three explanations for these observations: (i) that S. cerevisiae has an undiscovered H 2 A. F/Z variant, (ii) that the major S. cerevisiae H 2 A proteins are functionally equivalent to H 2 A. F/Z variants, or (iii) that the conserved epitope is found on a non-H 2 A molecule. Repeated attempts to clone an S. cerevisiae hv 1 homolog only resulted in the cloning of the known H 2 <b>A</b> <b>genes</b> yHTA 1 and yHTA 2. To test for functional relatedness, we attempted to rescue strains lacking the yeast H 2 <b>A</b> <b>genes</b> with either the Tetrahymena major H 2 <b>A</b> <b>genes</b> (tHTA 1 or tHTA 2) or the gene (tHTA 3) encoding hv 1. Although they differ considerably in sequence from the yeast H 2 <b>A</b> <b>genes,</b> the major Tetrahymena H 2 <b>A</b> <b>genes</b> can provide the essential functions of H 2 A in yeast cells, the first such case of trans-species complementation of histone function. The Tetrahymena H 2 <b>A</b> <b>genes</b> confer <b>a</b> cold-sensitive phenotype. Although expressed at high levels and transported to the nucleus, hv 1 cannot replace yeast H 2 A proteins. Proteins from S. cerevisiae strains lacking yeast H 2 <b>A</b> <b>genes</b> fail to cross-react with anti-hv 1 antibodies. These studies make it likely that S. cerevisiae differs from most other eukaryotes in that it does not have an H 2 A. F/Z homolog. A hypothesis is presented relating the absence of H 2 A. F/Z in S. cerevisiae to its function in other organisms...|$|R
40|$|In humanized UDP glucuronosyltransferase- 1 (hUGT 1) mice that {{express the}} entire UGT 1 locus, the {{maternal}} hepaticUGT 1 <b>A</b> <b>genes</b> are dramatically induced 12 - 14 days after concep-tion. Steroid induction of the UGT 1 <b>A</b> 1 <b>gene</b> indicates that xenobiotic sensors, {{such as the}} pregnane X receptor (PXR) and constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), may underlie the induction process. In contrast, neonatal hUGT 1 mice display severe hyperbilirubinemia, with limited expression of the UGT 1 <b>A</b> <b>genes.</b> This study identifies PXR as both a positive and negative regulator of the UGT 1 <b>A</b> 1 <b>gene.</b> Pregnancy hormones, in particular the gluco-corticoids, target PXR as a positive regulator of human glucuronidation. Employing reverse genetics, where PXR has been genetically deleted, hUGT 1 /Pxr 2 / 2 mice show limited induc-tion of the liver UGT 1 <b>A</b> <b>genes</b> during pregnancy, whereas the exact opposite occurs in new-born mice. Neonatal hUGT 1 mice show delayed expression of hepatic UGT 1 A 1 and are severely hyperbilirubinemic. However, in hUGT 1 /Pxr 2 / 2 mice, hyperbilirubinemia is greatly reduced due to induction of hepatic UGT 1 A 1. Thus, PXR serves to repressUGT 1 <b>A</b> 1 <b>gene</b> expression during development. Transcriptional silencing of the UGT 1 <b>A</b> 1 <b>gene</b> was relieved in neonatal hUGT 1 hepatocytes through interruption of PXR by small interferin...|$|R
5|$|A broad {{operational}} definition is sometimes used {{to encompass the}} complexity of these diverse phenomena, where <b>a</b> <b>gene</b> {{is defined as a}} union of genomic sequences encoding a coherent set of potentially overlapping functional products. This definition categorizes genes by their functional products (proteins or RNA) rather than their specific DNA loci, with regulatory elements classified as gene-associated regions.|$|E
5|$|According to Mendelian inheritance, {{variations}} in an organism's phenotype (observable physical and behavioral characteristics) are {{due in part}} to {{variations in}} its genotype (particular set of genes). Each gene specifies a particular trait with different sequence of <b>a</b> <b>gene</b> (alleles) giving rise to different phenotypes. Most eukaryotic organisms (such as the pea plants Mendel worked on) have two alleles for each trait, one inherited from each parent.|$|E
5|$|Another {{possibility}} is that <b>a</b> <b>gene</b> for aposematism might be recessive and located on the X chromosome. If so, predators would learn to associate the colour with unpalatability from males with the trait, while heterozygous females carry the trait until it becomes common and predators understand the signal. Well-fed predators might also ignore aposematic morphs, preferring other prey species.|$|E

40|$|Penicillin-resistant {{strains of}} Streptococcus pneumoniae have been common in South Africa and Spain for several years. Multilocus enzyme {{electrophoresis}} identified one clone of capsular type 6 B which was prevalent in Spain and another clone of type 23 F that {{was present in}} both countries. Genes for penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) in penicillin-resistant strains are often mosaics where parts of the pneumococcal genes are replaced by homologous genes from other species. We have compared the mosaic structures of the PBP 1 <b>a</b> <b>genes</b> from the two clones {{as well as from}} genetically distinct South African isolates. Four classes of mosaic PBP 1 <b>a</b> <b>genes</b> were found that contained blocks of sequences divergent by 6 - 22 % from those of sensitive genes; two classes contained sequences coming from more than one external source. Data are presented showing that the PBP 1 <b>a</b> <b>genes</b> from the 23 F and the 6 B clone are related, and that the two PBP 1 <b>a</b> <b>genes</b> from the South African isolates are also related.

5|$|Circular {{permutation}} {{can occur}} {{as the result}} of evolutionary events, posttranslational modifications, or artificially engineered mutations. The two main models proposed to explain the evolution of circularly permuted proteins are permutation by duplication and fission and fusion. Permutation by duplication occurs when <b>a</b> <b>gene</b> undergoes duplication to form a tandem repeat, before redundant sections of the protein are removed; this relationship is found between saposin and swaposin. Fission and fusion occurs when partial proteins fuse to form a single polypeptide, such as in nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenases.|$|E

5|$|Genetic {{engineering}} is the modification of an organism's genome through biotechnology.

5|$|In all organisms, {{two steps}} are {{required}} to read the information encoded in a gene's DNA and produce the protein it specifies. First, the gene's DNA is transcribed to messenger RNA (mRNA). Second, that mRNA is translated to protein. RNA-coding genes must still go through the first step, but are not translated into protein. The process of producing a biologically functional molecule of either RNA or protein is called gene expression, and the resulting molecule is called <b>a</b> <b>gene</b> product.|$|E

From a mathematical standpoint, an unused gene (selectively neutral) has a steadily decreasing probability of retaining potential functionality over time.
