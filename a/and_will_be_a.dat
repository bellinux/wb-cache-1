September, however, disrupted events by attempting to observe the point where Peter's cure was discovered, and his disruption has since caused several unintended changes within the timeline, including the war between the two universes.

[...] Atlanta magazine said, [...] "The guitar, when used properly, {{can be one of the}} most haunting and beautiful instruments to create sound... when he brushes his fingers across the strings, [...] can create some of the most incredible music. It's almost like a lullaby." [...] José Luis Acosta, president of the Spanish Artists and Editors Society stated that [...] "Paco was <b>and</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> universal artist, who took the guitar and flamenco sentiment to the heart of the whole world."
