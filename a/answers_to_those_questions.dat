Whatever can be an object of belief, or even of disbelief, must, when put into words, assume the form of a proposition. All truth and all error lie in propositions. What, by a convenient misapplication of an abstract term, we call a Truth, means simply a True Proposition; and errors are false propositions. To know the import of all possible propositions would be to know all questions which can be raised, all matters which are susceptible of being either believed or disbelieved. How many kinds of inquiries can be propounded; how many kinds of judgments can be made; and how many kinds of propositions {{it is possible to}} frame with a meaning, are but different forms of one and the same question. Since, then, the objects of all Belief and of all Inquiry express themselves in propositions, a sufficient scrutiny of Propositions and of their varieties will apprise us what questions mankind have actually asked of themselves, and what, in the nature of <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>questions,</b> they have actually thought they had grounds to believe.|$|E

5000|$|Difficulties arose {{regarding}} how to prove someone was in care or {{control of a}} motor vehicle, and what the test should be. In 1947, Parliament amended the Criminal Code again, adding a presumption of care or control when a person was found sitting in the driver's seat of a motor vehicle. [...] This did not answer {{all of the problems}} regarding the test (i.e. when a person is not found in the driver's seat of a motor vehicle).

50|$|In Canada, {{the process}} is nearly {{identical}} but is called an examination for discovery.

Oral examination is typically completed after pleadings and requests for particulars by exchange of affidavits of documents and sometimes written questions and answers (interrogatories). Often affidavits are exchanged before trial, but the first opportunity to orally question the opposing party's evidence is usually at trial.|$|E

30|$|Yet, this {{solution}} will raise several issues to consider. For example, should the storage {{be located in}} separate sites of origin or would it be better to have a large central back-up storage facility at one site only? How long will or should data be kept in other sites than the owners’ site? And again only data within the affinity domain can be seen, where data outside that domain still will rely on portable media of any kind. The <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>questions</b> will determine what the best implementation is and later {{what will be the}} costs of the system itself.|$|R

He announces his intention to find Earth, since without knowing the <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>questions</b> he cannot be certain his choice was the right one. Trevize also mentions that he chose Gaia because that was the only choice of the three that was reversible in case his choice should prove to be wrong, due to the large length of time required for the formation of Galaxia.|$|E
5000|$|Batson's {{most famous}} {{contribution}} to the psychology of religion has been his argument that the traditional distinction, made by Gordon Allport (Allport & Ross, 1967) [...] between intrinsic and extrinsic religious orientations , does not exhaust all possible orientations to being religious; rather, he believes {{it is important to}} refer to what he calls Quest, a form of religiosity that views questions and the <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>questions</b> as being of equal importance (Batson & Schoenrade, 1991a; 1991b). This view has been controversial, and critics have questioned whether this Quest really does correlate with any other variable germane to religiosity. He has also written about religious experiences, defending a four-stage model of religious experiences, based upon Graham Wallas' four-stage model of problem-solving in the psychology of creativity (Batson, Schoenrade & Ventis, 1993).|$|E

5000|$|It {{is often}} complained that {{philosophy}} has developed {{more slowly than}} the special sciences, and has not enjoyed {{the same sort of}} remarkable and definitive progress seen in chemistry or physics. It is nearly universally agreed (a remarkable feat, amongst philosophers) that this {{has something to do with}} the peculiar methods of philosophical inquiry. In particular, philosophy seems to lack the sort of developments that Thomas Kuhn called paradigms—achievements which, by their success, clearly determine which sort of questions are to be asked and what sort of considerations count as evidence for or against <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>questions.</b> In effect, philosophy can be compared to alchemy: a pre-scientific method to study the reality, which achieved some limited success in the past but which nowadays is superseded by science, except in some subfields (eg.: art) where science (neuroscience, in this case) is not yet sufficiently advanced to be able to give the answers which philosophy has been trying in vain to get until now.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{practice}} the historical-grammatical method using the inductive method, a general three-fold {{approach to the}} text: 1) observation, 2) interpretation, and 3) application. Each step builds upon the other, and so they follow in order. The first step of observation involves an examination of words, structure, structural relationships and literary forms. After observations are formed, then the second step of interpretation involves asking interpretative questions, formulating <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>questions,</b> integration and summarization of the passage. After the meaning is derived through interpretation, then the third step of application involves determining both the theoretical and practical significance of the text, and appropriately applying this significance to today's modern context. There is also a heavy emphasis on personal application that extends into {{all aspects of the}} practitioner's life. Theologian Robert Traina, in his 1952 Methodical Bible Study, wrote that [...] "the applicatory step is that for which all else exists. It represents the final purpose of Bible study." ...|$|E
50|$|All {{libraries}} have {{a mission}} statement, and spoken or unspoken, libraries {{are here to}} improve the condition of mankind. An institution can no longer, in good faith aim to improve the human condition while contributing {{to the destruction of}} the future: Buildings produce about 40% of the dangerous greenhouse gasses emitted into the atmosphere (Anisko & Willoughby, 2006). The environmental debate has evolved. The fact that humans are having a negative impact on the environment is no longer seriously questioned. Now, two questions shape the debate: What is our responsibility to fix it, and {{what can we do to}} fix it? Individuals and private organizations have a right to find their personal <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>questions,</b> but libraries are an investment in the future of our society. Libraries have a responsibility to not contribute to the destruction of the environment, to educate the people regarding our current situation, and empower them to make a difference. Libraries are discovering that their green building gives them a great opportunity to educate the citizenry (Tseng, 2007). As libraries continue to take a more progressive stance on improving the human condition, sustainability will have to be a central theme.|$|E

40|$|Critical Theory {{offers a}} new way to {{understand}} not only the society, but also the individual. In particular, I will focus on the thought of Adorno and his conception of society. First, I want to investigate the Adornian description of society in its totalitarian face and in its paradoxical relationship with the individual. The individual, first element of society, without which any society cannot be imaged, paradoxically finds – in the society – its liquidation and destruction. Secondly, I want to consider the Adornian revolutionary statement in a conversation with Horkheimer of a need of a “New Manifesto”. Do we need it even today? Would be really possible a new Marxian society in our world? The attempt <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>questions</b> will conclude my paper...|$|R
40|$|Vol. 5, No. 8, November-December 2006 The paper {{introduces}} modeling {{spaces in}} order to help software practitioner to understand modeling. Usually software engineers often think of a specific kind of models – UML models, but there are many open questions such as: Should we assume that the code we write is a model or not; What are models and metamodels, and why do we need them; What does it mean to transform a model into a programming language. Unlike current research efforts that <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>questions</b> in rather partial ways, we define a formal encompassing framework (i. e. Modeling spaces) for studying many modeling problems in a more comprehensive way. We illustrate the benefits of that framework for explaining present dilemmas practitioners have regarding models, metamodels, and model transformations...|$|R
