5|$|Badajoz is the see of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Mérida-Badajoz. Prior to {{the merger}} of the Diocese of Mérida and the Diocese of Badajoz, Badajoz was the see of the Diocese of Badajoz from the bishopric's {{inception}} in 1255. The city has a degree of eminence, crowned as it is by {{the ruins of a}} Moorish castle and overlooking the Guadiana river, which flows between the castle-hill and the powerfully armed fort of San Cristobal. The architecture of Badajoz is indicative of its tempestuous history; even the Badajoz Cathedral, built in 1238, resembles a fortress, with its massive walls. Badajoz is home to the CD Badajoz <b>and</b> <b>AD</b> Cerro de Reyes football clubs and the AB Pacense basketball club. It is served by Badajoz Railway Station and Badajoz Airport.|$|E
5|$|During this time, the Molonglo River {{flowed through}} the flood basin, {{with only a}} small {{fraction}} of the water envisaged in Griffin's plan. The centre of his capital city consisted of mostly farmland, with small settlements—mostly wooden, temporary <b>and</b> <b>ad</b> hoc—on either side. There was little evidence that Canberra was planned, and the lake and Parliamentary Triangle at the heart of Griffin's plan was but a paddock. Royal Canberra Golf Course, and Acton Racecourse and a sports ground were located on the pastoral land that was to become the West Lake, and people had to disperse the livestock before playing sport. A rubbish dump stood on the northern banks of the location of central basin, and no earth had been moved since Griffin's departure three decades earlier.|$|E

5|$|Progressive {{deterioration}} eventually hinders independence, with subjects {{being unable}} to perform most common activities of daily living. Speech difficulties become evident due to an inability to recall vocabulary, which leads to frequent incorrect word substitutions (paraphasias). Reading and writing skills are also progressively lost. Complex motor sequences become less coordinated as time passes <b>and</b> <b>AD</b> progresses, so the risk of falling increases. During this phase, memory problems worsen, and the person may fail to recognise close relatives. Long-term memory, which was previously intact, becomes impaired.|$|E
5|$|The dating of potbelly sculptures {{has been}} {{problematic}} with {{few of the}} earlier known sculptures being found in their original context. Investigators from the 1950s through to the 1970s argued that the style was Olmec derived or perhaps pre-Olmec. Olmec culture is judged to have lasted from 1500 BC through to 400 BC based on radiocarbon dating. Investigations at Santa Leticia were focused on answering the dating problem and securely dated Santa Leticia Monuments 1 and 3 to between 500 BC <b>and</b> <b>AD</b> 100 {{using a combination of}} radiocarbon dating and ceramic evidence.|$|E
5|$|The first {{settlement}} {{formed in}} the Iron Age where a prehistoric track crossed the River Slea. It was a tribal centre and home to a mint for the Corieltauvi in the 1st centuries BC <b>and</b> <b>AD.</b> Evidence of Roman and Anglo-Saxon settlement has been uncovered, and by the late Saxon period the town was an economic and jurisdictional centre with a court and market. In the medieval period, records differentiate between Old and New Sleaford, the latter emerging in the areas around the present day market place and St Denys' Church. Sleaford Castle was constructed in the 12th century for the Bishops of Lincoln, who owned the manor. Granted the right to hold a market in the mid-12th century, New Sleaford developed into a market town and became locally important in the wool trade, while Old Sleaford declined.|$|E

5|$|The {{full extent}} of {{occupation}} and activity in the Motul de San José area is not well understood for the Postclassic Period.

Early Postclassic construction and ceramics have been identified at Motul de San José and all of its satellite sites, but construction was small scale and distribution of pottery was limited. La Trinidad de Nosotros was apparently a small village at this time and has produced some of the best examples of Early Postclassic ceramics.|$|E
5|$|Although Crash! Boom! Bang! saw chart success (No.1 in Sweden, No.2 in Germany & Australia, No.3 in the UK), it sold fewer copies {{than had}} their {{previous}} albums. EMI America {{were reluctant to}} release the album, and instead promoted a shortened 10-track Favorites CD in association with McDonald's. The Favorites of Crash! Boom! Bang! CD reportedly sold about 1 million copies. It was noted by journalists that the McDonald's promotion CD and other CDs by Tina Turner, Garth Brooks and Elton John, led to US music retailers of the time being unhappy with the promotion on several fronts, including that it bypassed established music stores and {{that the price of}} the CD was way below normal wholesale costs. Some stores refused to sell the albums published by EMI, with one major chain protesting by temporarily pulling all products from CEMA (EMI's distribution wing) out of its sales <b>and</b> <b>ad</b> campaigns. Relations with EMI's North American subsidiary, never on the best of terms, collapsed after the release of this album. Crash! Boom! Bang! became the last Roxette release EMI would issue in the US, until Greatest Hits was released in 2011 on subsidiary label Capitol Records.|$|E
5|$|In late 1992, the Dangerous Journeys RPG was {{released}} by Games Designer Workshop, but TSR immediately applied for an injunction against the entire Dangerous Journeys RPG and the Mythus setting, arguing that Dangerous Journeys was based on D <b>and</b> <b>AD.</b> Although the injunction failed, TSR moved forward with litigation. Gygax believed the legal action was without merit and fuelled by Lorraine Williams' personal enmity, but NEC and JVC both withdrew from the project, killing the Mythus computer game. By 1994, the legal costs associated with many months of pretrial discovery had drained all of Gygax's resources; believing that TSR was also suffering, Gygax offered to settle. In the end, TSR paid Gygax for the complete rights to Dangerous Journeys and Mythus. Although Gygax was well compensated for his years of work on Dangerous Journeys and Mythus, neither was ever published—TSR immediately and permanently shelved them.|$|E
40|$|A {{post-prandial}} {{increase in}} {{saturated fatty acids}} (SFAs) and glucose (Glc) activates an inflammatory response, which may be prolonged following restoration of physiological SFAs and Glc levels — a finding referred to as ‘metabolic memory'. This study examined chronic and oscillating SFAs and Glc on the inflammatory signalling pathway in human adipose tissue (AT) <b>and</b> adipocytes (<b>Ads)</b> <b>and</b> determined whether <b>Ads</b> are subject to “metabolic memory. ” Abdominal (Abd) subcutaneous (Sc) explants <b>and</b> <b>Ads</b> were treated with chronic low glucose (L-Glc) : 5. 6 mM and high glucose (H-Glc) : 17. 5 mM, with low (0. 2 mM) and high (2 mM) SFA for 48 h. Abd Sc explants <b>and</b> <b>Ads</b> were also exposed to the aforementioned treatment regimen for 12 -h periods, with alternating rest periods of 12 h in L-Glc. Chronic treatment with L-Glc and high SFAs, H-Glc and high SFAs up-regulated key factors of the nuclear factor-κB (NFκB) pathway in Abd Sc AT <b>and</b> <b>Ads</b> (TLR 4, NFκB; P<. 05), whilst down-regulating MyD 88. Oscillating Glc and SFA concentrations increased TLR 4, NFκB, IKKβ (P<. 05) in explants <b>and</b> <b>Ads</b> <b>and</b> up-regulated MyD 88 expression (P<. 05). Both tumor necrosis factor α and interleukin 6 (P<. 05) secretion were markedly increased in chronically treated Abd Sc explants <b>and</b> <b>Ads</b> whilst, with oscillating treatments, a sustained inflammatory effect was noted in absence of treatment. Therefore, SFAs may act as key instigators of the inflammatory response in human AT via NFκB activation, which suggests that short-term exposure of cells to uncontrolled levels of SFAs and Glc leads to a longer-term inflammatory insult within the Ad, which may {{have important implications for}} patients with obesity and Type 2 diabetes...|$|R

5|$|Motul de San José {{experienced}} {{its second}} major peak in occupation during the Late Classic period, between AD 600 <b>and</b> <b>AD</b> 830. Most {{of the major}} architecture at the site was built during this surge in activity and the city reached its maximum size. Motul de San José {{became one of the}} three most important cities around Lake Petén Itzá and was approximately the same size as Tayasal, while it was slightly smaller than Nixtun Ch'ich'. There was renewed growth in the city's satellite sites, Chakokot reached its peak population and most of its residential complexes were built in the Late Classic. Buena Vista experienced only light occupation at this time. Major construction work took place at Akte including the building of the principal platform and its causeway. It also appears that the rulers of Akte erected several stelae. La Trinidad de Nosotros took on its final form and most of its major architecture was built at this time including the Mesoamerican ballcourt, the major residential complexes, four plazas and the port facilities.|$|E
5|$|The Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set, {{released}} in 1977, was an introductory {{version of the}} original D geared towards new players and edited by J. Eric Holmes. But in the same year, TSR Hobbies released a completely new and complex version of D, Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD). The Monster Manual, released later that year, became the first supplemental rule book of the new system, and many more followed. The AD rules were not fully compatible {{with those of the}} D Basic Set and as a result, D <b>and</b> <b>AD</b> became distinct product lines. Splitting the game lines created a further rift between Gygax and Arneson; although Arneson received a 10% royalty on sales of all D products, Gygax refused to pay him royalties on AD books, claiming it was a new and different property. In 1979, Arneson filed a lawsuit against TSR; it was eventually settled in March 1981 with the agreement that Arneson would receive a 2.5% royalty on all AD products, giving him a very comfortable six-figure annual income for the next decade.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} written by Carter and Spotnitz and {{directed}} by series regular Rob Bowman. In addition to Mulder, Scully, Skinner and Cigarette Smoking Man, it featured guest appearances by Martin Landau, Armin Mueller-Stahl and Blythe Danner, who appeared only in the film.

Jeffrey Spender, Diana Fowley, Alex Krycek and Gibson Praise—characters who had been introduced in the fifth-season finale and/or were integral to the television series—do {{not appear in the}} film. Although the film had a strong domestic opening and received mostly positive reviews from critics, attendance dropped sharply after the first weekend. Although it failed to make a profit during its theatrical release—due in part to its large promotional budget—The X-Files film was more successful internationally. Eventually, the worldwide theatrical box office total reached $189 million. The film's production cost <b>and</b> <b>ad</b> budgets were each close to $66 million.

5|$|The {{history of}} {{maritime}} trade {{along the coast}} of East Africa dates to the Classical Period. The Periplus Maris Erthraei, written by an Egyptian-Greek merchant circa AD 40–55, described trading ports along the Indian Ocean including Azania, a historic designation of the East African coast extending southward to present day Tanzania. Physical evidence for trade predates the earliest towns in the ninth century with the discovery of four Roman beads from the fourth century and pottery from the fifth century. Roman documents from the first through fifth centuries, as well as, Ptolemy's Geographia also provide historical accounts of trade with East Africa, followed by a dearth of historical documents until the tenth century. After the fall of the Roman Empire in the fifth century, Arab, Indian, and Chinese shipping grew in importance, which was eventually dominated by Persia after its conquest of southern Arabia and Egypt in AD 515 <b>and</b> <b>AD</b> 616. It has been proposed that trade between the Swahili Coast and Persia, as well as later Islamic merchants following the spread of Islam after AD 632, contributed to the settlement and development of the coastal sites.|$|E
