25|$|The result (in seconds) for a {{prothrombin}} time performed {{on a normal}} individual will {{vary according to the}} type of <b>analytical</b> <b>system</b> employed. This is due to the variations between different types and batches of manufacturer's tissue factor used in the reagent to perform the test. The INR was devised to standardize the results. Each manufacturer assigns an ISI value (International Sensitivity Index) for any tissue factor they manufacture. The ISI value indicates how a particular batch of tissue factor compares to an international reference tissue factor. The ISI is usually between 0.94 and 1.4 for more sensitive and 2.0-3.0 for less sensitive thromboplastins.|$|E

Chrysler ran a post-graduate educational facility named the Chrysler Institute of Engineering, which allowed DeLorean to advance his education while gaining real-world experience in automotive engineering.|$|E

40|$|Background: Reference {{procedures}} {{are required for}} evaluating the accuracy of routine <b>analytical</b> <b>systems</b> for uric acid (UA). External quality assessment (EQA) for UA has only been conducted with quality controls in China, and the results have not been published. This {{study was designed to}} investigate both the trueness and inter-laboratory precision of UA measurements among routine <b>analytical</b> <b>systems</b> using a candidate reference method. Methods: We performed the HPLC method recommended by the Japan Society of Clinical Chemistry (JSCC). Next, we evaluated its analytical performance and validated its true-ness. The performance of 4 routine <b>analytical</b> <b>systems</b> (5 instruments per system, n= 20) for UA was assessed by using 4 frozen pooled serum samples measured by the HPLC method according to biologically relevant quality goals. Results: Within-run, between-run, inter-day, and total CV of the method were less than 0. 3 %, 0. 4 %, 1. 8 %, and 2. 6 %, respectively. The UA measurements were consistent with the target values of standard reference material (SRM) 909 b, the sixth ring trial for Refer-ence Laboratories (RELA- 2008) specimen, and national primary reference materials.

40|$|Case reportWe {{report a}} case of spuriously 'normal' {{haemoglobin}} A 1 c (HbA 1 c) result due to misidentification of HbG Taipei as HbAo by the Variant II built-in retention time algorithm. The defect was circumvented effectively by {{the implementation of a}} chromatographic system specific internal quality control mechanism for peak identity verification. HbA 1 c and estimated average glucose results were corrected from 4. 7 % to 8. 2 %, and 4. 9 to 10. 5 mmol/L, respectively. The results were consistent with the patient's concurrent and previous fasting blood glucose concentrations and existence of diabetes mellitus dermopathy, indicating poor glycaemic control. A review of currently available <b>analytical</b> <b>systems</b> showed that other than mass spectrometry, HbA 1 c measurements by these systems were generally affected by the presence of haemoglobin variants. The same haemoglobin variant may affect different <b>analytical</b> <b>systems</b> differently, resulting in the deviation of HbA 1 c results from the true value to different extents. Including the analytical principle of HbA 1 c measurement in the laboratory report can avoid inappropriate comparison of results obtained by different <b>analytical</b> <b>systems.</b> Moreover, since individual haemoglobinopathy may affect the degree of glucose binding to haemoglobin in a different way, this uncertainty limits the general application of same decision cut-off of established guidelines for glycaemic control monitoring.
