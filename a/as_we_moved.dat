2500|$|The President of Ireland, Michael D. Higgins, {{speaking}} about the find at an International Women's Day reception, said there [...] "are dark shadows that hang over our meeting, shadows that require us all to summon up yet again a light that might dispel the darkness to which so many women and their children were condemned, and the questions left unanswered <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>moved</b> on." [...] President Higgins described Catherine Corless' work as [...] "another necessary step in blowing open the locked doors of a hidden Ireland." ...|$|E
2500|$|The cast of V {{features}} {{a number of}} actors from other science-fiction series, including Lost, Firefly and Smallville. Peters has stated that the casting of so many actors from a science-fiction background was coincidental, explaining: [...] "Obviously, we went for the best actors we could possibly find. It's a nice bonus {{that a lot of}} these folks have appeared in genre shows in the past, but it was not designed that way. We also wanted to make sure that <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>moved</b> forward, we honoured and respected the characters and the themes that the (original) show envisioned, while introducing brand new characters and brand new themes that make sense in a post-9/11 world." [...] Mitchell was a fan of the original series as a child, recalling: [...] "I liked the escape of it; I liked the entertainment of it. It was a fun night for me. I was allowed to watch an hour of television with my parents, and we made a kind of celebration of it. I hope that other teenagers will do that with their parents with this show." [...] Mitchell's role in V sees her play an FBI agent with traits traditionally assigned to males. She commented: [...] "I like playing a traditional hero. I don't think I've ever done it before. Sigourney Weaver said she always chooses male roles because they are meatier." [...] Mitchell characterizes Erica as having [...] "a little bit of a hero complex", but [...] "her joy and her love and her true affection is with her son, and the fact that he is in imminent danger (makes it) fun to play." ...|$|E

30|$|In {{the short}} run, {{protectionist}} policies will benefit owners of factors {{employed in the}} secondary sector and will harm those employed in the primary and tertiary sectors. Since the proportion of factors employed in the secondary sector increases <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>move</b> upward and toward the left in the diversification and trade region, protectionist policies have more short-run support <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>move</b> closer to the autarky region and less support <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>move</b> closer to the specialization area (see Proposition 3 in Appendix 1).|$|R

60|$|That holiday {{was full}} of big {{comprehensive}} effects; the first view of the Rhone valley and the distant Valaisian Alps, for example, which we saw from {{the shoulder of the}} mountain above the Gemmi, and the early summer dawn breaking over Italy <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>moved</b> from our night's crouching and munched bread and chocolate and stretched our stiff limbs among the tumbled and precipitous rocks that hung over Lake Cingolo, and surveyed the winding tiring rocky track going down and down to Antronapiano.|$|E
60|$|He {{went down}} the steps and into the car without looking at her. She waited in the doorway <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>moved</b> round.

He did not look at her till we were curving to the great, snow-cumbered rhododendrons, when, at the last moment he stood up in a sudden panic to wave to her. Almost as he saw her the bushes came between them and he dropped dejectedly into his seat.|$|E

Near the foot of the bed stood a dish of oranges and a carafe of water. As we passed it Holmes, to my unutterable astonishment, leaned over in front of me and deliberately knocked the whole thing over. The glass smashed into a thousand pieces and the fruit rolled about into every corner of the room.|$|E

30|$|As we have argued, {{even though}} many policy makers {{emphasize}} the need for causal inferences to support “objective” policy decisions, {{the reality of the}} policy process is much more complex and influenced by a host of social and political values and interests. That said, as a research community we often embrace uncertainty and operate with caution <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>move</b> forward with research, especially when using ILSA data. Although policy makers’ and researchers’ goals are not mutually exclusive, since they both aim to improve education, the two groups approach problems differently and, as a result, often have different objectives for the findings. Understanding and communicating these differences will be an important step <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>move</b> forward with more causal modeling of ILSA data.|$|R
