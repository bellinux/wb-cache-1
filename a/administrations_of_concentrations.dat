Understanding the variations in bacterial morphology enables the clinical microbiologist and pathologists to communicate effectively, hopefully leading to an earlier, more precise diagnosis of patient disease.|$|R

40|$|ACh is the {{neurotransmitter}} {{responsible for}} increasing sweat rate (SR) in humans. Because ACh is rapidly hydrolyzed by acetylcholinesterase (AChE), {{it is possible}} that AChE contributes to the modulation of SR. Thus the primary purpose of this project was to identify whether AChE around human sweat glands is capable of modulating SR during local application <b>of</b> various <b>concentrations</b> <b>of</b> ACh in vivo, as well as during a heat stress. In seven subjects, two microdialysis probes were placed in the intradermal space of the forearm. One probe was perfused with the AChE inhibitor neostigmine (10 microM); the adjacent membrane was perfused with the vehicle (Ringer solution). SR over both membranes was monitored via capacitance hygrometry during microdialysis <b>administration</b> <b>of</b> various <b>concentrations</b> <b>of</b> ACh (1 x 10 (- 7) - 2 M) and during whole body heating. SR was significantly greater at the neostigmine-treated site than at the control site during <b>administration</b> <b>of</b> lower <b>concentrations</b> <b>of</b> ACh (1 x 10 (- 7) - 1 x 10 (- 3) M, P 0. 05). Moreover, the core temperature threshold for the onset of sweating at the neostigmine-treated site was significantly reduced relative to that at the control site. However, no differences in SR were observed between sites after 35 min of whole body heating. These results suggest that AChE is capable of modulating SR when ACh concentrations are low to moderate (i. e., when sudomotor activity is low) but is less effective in governing SR after SR has increased substantially...|$|R
40|$|<b>Administration</b> <b>of</b> subanesthetic <b>concentrations</b> <b>of</b> ketamine, a noncompetitive {{antagonist}} of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) type of glutamate receptors, is {{a widely}} accepted therapeutic modality in perioperative and chronic pain management. Although extensive clinical use has demonstrated its safety, recent human histopathological observations as well as laboratory data suggest that ketamine can exert adverse effects on central nervous system neurons. To further investigate this issue, {{the present study was}} designed to evaluate the effects of ketamine on the survival and dendritic arbor architecture of differentiated gamma-aminobutyric acidergic (GABAergic) interneurons in vitro. We show that short-term exposure of cultures to ketamine at <b>concentrations</b> <b>of</b> > or = 20 microg/ml leads to a significant cell loss of differentiated cells and that non-cell death-inducing <b>concentrations</b> <b>of</b> ketamine (10 microg/ml) can still initiate long-term alterations of dendritic arbor in differentiated neurons, including dendritic retraction and branching point elimination. Most importantly, we also demonstrate that chronic (> 24 h) <b>administration</b> <b>of</b> ketamine at <b>concentrations</b> as low as 0. 01 microg/ml can interfere with the maintenance of dendritic arbor architecture. These results raise the possibility that chronic exposure to low, subanesthetic <b>concentrations</b> <b>of</b> ketamine, while not affecting cell survival, could still impair neuronal morphology and thus might lead to dysfunctions of neural networks...|$|R

40|$|The use of siRNA-based therapies for the {{treatment}} of neurodegenerative disease requires efficient, nontoxic distribution to the affected brain parenchyma, notably the striatum and cortex. Here, we describe the synthesis and activity of a fully chemically modified siRNA that is directly conjugated to docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), the most abundant polyunsaturated fatty acid in the mammalian brain. DHA conjugation enables enhanced siRNA retention throughout both the ipsilateral striatum and cortex following a single, intrastriatal injection (ranging from 6 – 60 μg). Within these tissues, DHA conjugation promotes internalization by both neurons and astrocytes. We demonstrate efficient and specific silencing of Huntingtin mRNA expression in both the ipsilateral striatum (up to 73 %) and cortex (up to 51 %) after 1 week. Moreover, following a bilateral intrastriatal injection (60 μg), we achieve up to 80 % silencing of a secondary target, Cyclophilin B, at both the mRNA and protein level. Importantly, DHA-hsiRNAs do not induce neural cell death or measurable innate immune activation following <b>administration</b> <b>of</b> <b>concentrations</b> over 20 times above the efficacious dose. Thus, DHA conjugation is a novel strategy for improving siRNA activity in mouse brain, with potential to act as a new therapeutic platform for {{the treatment}} of neurodegenerative disorders...|$|R
