Lu was eventually selected <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>running</b> <b>mate.</b>|$|E
5|$|Goldwater {{selected}} William E. Miller, U.S. Representative {{and chairman}} of the Republican National Committee, <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>running</b> <b>mate</b> for the general election. Although virtually unknown to many voters, Miller was viewed by those familiar with him as a wise choice for the vice-presidential nomination, with his supporters arguing that he would {{play a key role in}} waging an aggressive campaign against Lyndon Johnson and the Democrats.|$|E
5|$|However, as the GOP {{convention}} neared, Ford appeared {{close to}} victory. Acknowledging his party's moderate wing, Reagan chose moderate Senator Richard Schweiker of Pennsylvania <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>running</b> <b>mate</b> if nominated. Nonetheless, Ford prevailed with 1,187 delegates to Reagan's 1,070. Ford {{would go on}} to lose the 1976 presidential election to the Democratic nominee, Jimmy Carter.|$|E

5|$|On January 26, 2009, Lieutenant Governor Daniel Mongiardo {{announced}} that he would seek the Democratic nomination to challenge incumbent Senator Jim Bunning in the 2010 senatorial election. The move effectively prohibited Mongiardo from running for re-election with Beshear in the 2011 gubernatorial contest. On July 19, 2009, Beshear {{announced that}} Louisville mayor Jerry Abramson would replace Mongiardo <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>running</b> <b>mate</b> in his re-election campaign.|$|E

5|$|Harrison placed fifth on {{the first}} ballot, with Sherman in the lead, and the next few ballots showed little change. The Blaine {{supporters}} shifted their support among candidates they found acceptable, and when they shifted to Harrison, they found a candidate who could attract the votes of many other delegations. He was nominated as the party's presidential candidate on the eighth ballot, by a count of 544 to 108 votes. Levi P. Morton of New York was chosen <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>running</b> <b>mate.</b>|$|E
5|$|John McCain was {{nominated}} as the Republican candidate, and he selected Sarah Palin <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>running</b> <b>mate.</b> The two candidates engaged in three presidential debates in September and October 2008.

He became the first African American to be elected president. Obama delivered his victory speech before hundreds of thousands of supporters in Chicago's Grant Park.|$|E
5|$|Johnson wanted Humphrey to pick Sanford <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>running</b> <b>mate.</b> On one occasion, the Humphrey {{campaign}} asked Sanford if {{he wanted}} to be the vice presidential candidate. Sanford declined, and Humphrey ultimately picked Senator Edmund Muskie of Maine. Though Sanford received a number of legal and business offers from the private sector during this period, he was interested in a position that would allow him to keep his political prospects open.|$|E

5|$|On December 28, 2011, Johnson {{formally}} {{withdrew his}} candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination, and declared his candidacy for the 2012 presidential nomination of the Libertarian Party in Santa Fe, New Mexico. On May 5, 2012, at the 2012 Libertarian National Convention, Johnson received the Libertarian Party's official nomination {{for president in}} the 2012 election, {{by a vote of}} 419 votes to 152 votes for second-place candidate R. Lee Wrights. In his acceptance speech, Johnson asked the convention's delegates to nominate <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>running</b> <b>mate</b> Judge Jim Gray of California. Gray subsequently received the party's vice-presidential nomination on the first ballot.|$|E
5|$|Paul {{defeated}} Native American activist Russell Means at the Libertarian Party's National Convention in Seattle {{to win the}} party's presidential nomination. Former Alaska State representative Andre Marrou {{was selected}} <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>running</b> <b>mate.</b> After over a year of campaigning as the Libertarian Party nominee, Paul received very little media coverage, and was excluded from presidential debates. On Election Day, {{he was on the}} ballot in 46 states and the District of Columbia, and finished in third place with approximately 0.47% of the vote, behind Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis and the winner Vice President George H.W. Bush.|$|E
5|$|Following the speech, Nixon {{formally}} selected Governor Spiro Agnew of Maryland <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>running</b> <b>mate,</b> {{who received}} 1119 delegate votes, with the distant second being Governor Romney with 186. Agnew was relatively unknown nationally, and was selected {{due to his}} purported appeal to African Americans, and work for the Nixon campaign after an embarrassing experience {{as the head of}} the Draft Rockefeller movement. It was later noted that the convention had featured Nixon as the centrist candidate with Rockefeller to his left and Reagan to his right. The same analysis applied to the general campaign, as commentators noted that Nixon would stand to the right of the still undecided Democratic nominee but would fall to the left of American Independent Party candidate George Wallace.|$|E

5|$|Rooteatauira was {{the father}} of Toromona (Solomon) Teuruarii, who served as mayor of Rurutu in the 1970s.

Toromona's son Maeua, born in 1941, bears the title Teuruarii VII. Another descendant, Atitoa a Teuruarii, was the district chief of the southern portion of the island before World War II. His sons, Amaiterai and Tairi a Teuruarii, owned much of the land in the northwestern districts of Teautamatea and Vitaria, the ancestral lands of the Teuruarii royal line, where the remains of the island's ancient temple (Marae Tararoa) still stand.|$|E
5|$|Van Buren {{soon became}} a major target of {{criticism}} from the Whigs following the Panic of 1837. Seeking to run a non-controversial and less ideological war hero who could defeat Van Buren based on popularity, a unified Whig Party nominated Harrison over party founder Henry Clay and fellow general Winfield Scott. John Tyler of Virginia was selected <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>running</b> <b>mate,</b> and Harrison and Tyler defeated Van Buren in the 1840 election. At the time, he was the oldest president ever elected. However, Harrison died of pneumonia in April 1841, a month after taking office. Tyler then assumed the presidency, setting a major precedent.|$|E
5|$|Colbert {{confirmed}} his presidential ambitions on his October 16, 2007 show, stating {{his intention to}} run both on the Republican and Democratic platforms, but only as a favorite son in his native South Carolina. In an interview with Larry King he revealed that, <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>running</b> <b>mate,</b> he would consider Mike Huckabee (who himself jokingly offered Colbert the vice presidential position). He also speculated {{on the possibility of}} a Colbert-Putin or Colbert-Colbert ticket. Colbert abandoned plans to run as a Republican due to the $35,000 fee required to file for the South Carolina primary. On November 1, 2007, it was announced that he would not appear on the Democratic primary ballot either, after being deemed ineligible by the South Carolina Democratic Party executive committee. Several days later he announced that he was withdrawing from the race, saying that he did not wish to put the country through an agonizing Supreme Court battle.|$|E
25|$|The CRNC {{is one of}} {{the leading}} 527 groups in the United States, and {{provides}} field support for Republican and conservative causes nationwide. During Howell's tenure, the CRNC coordinated a large deployment of student volunteers to Virginia, for the 2009 gubernatorial election in support of Bob McDonnell (<b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>running</b> <b>mates</b> Bill Bolling and Ken Cuccinelli). The field program also assisted with the other major general-election effort that year, for New Jersey gubernatorial nominee Chris Christie. After Republican victories in both of those bellwether races, Howell's administration targeted the Fall 2010 CRNC field program towards specific states, which they believed contained the greatest potential for state-level and congressional gains, in the November elections.|$|R

5|$|Hancock's {{name had}} been {{proposed}} several times for the Democratic nomination for president, but he never captured a majority of delegates. In 1880, however, Hancock's chances improved. President Hayes had promised not to run for a second term, and the previous Democratic nominee, Tilden, declined to run again due to poor health. Hancock faced several competitors for the nomination, including Thomas A. Hendricks, Allen G. Thurman, Stephen Johnson Field, and Thomas F. Bayard. Hancock's neutrality on the monetary question, and his lingering support in the South (owing to his General Order Number 40) meant that Hancock, {{more than any other}} candidate, had nationwide support. When the Democratic convention assembled in Cincinnati in June 1880, Hancock led on the first ballot, but did not have a majority. By the second ballot, Hancock received the requisite two-thirds, and William Hayden English of Indiana was chosen <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>running</b> <b>mate.</b>|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} tumultuous primary {{election}} seasons ever began as the Tet Offensive was launched, followed by the withdrawal of President Johnson as a candidate after doing unexpectedly poorly in the New Hampshire primary; it concluded with the assassination {{of one of the}} Democratic candidates, Senator Robert F. Kennedy, just moments after his victory in the California primary. On the Republican side, Nixon's main opposition was Michigan Governor George Romney, though New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller and California Governor Ronald Reagan each hoped to be nominated in a brokered convention. Nixon secured the nomination on the first ballot. He selected Maryland Governor Spiro Agnew <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>running</b> <b>mate,</b> a choice which Nixon believed would unite the party, appealing to both Northern moderates and Southerners disaffected with the Democrats.|$|E
5|$|The speech made Breckinridge {{a target}} of Whigs, Young Americans, and Douglas supporters. Humphrey Marshall, a Kentucky Whig who {{supported}} incumbent President Millard Fillmore, attacked Breckinridge for claiming Fillmore had not fully disclosed his views on slavery. Illinois' William Alexander Richardson, a Douglas backer, tried to distance Douglas from Sanders' attacks on Butler, but Breckinridge showed that Douglas endorsed the Democratic Review a month after it printed its first anti-Butler article. Finally, Breckinridge's cousin, California's Edward C. Marshall, charged that Butler would name Breckinridge Attorney General {{in exchange for his}} support and revived the charge that Breckinridge broke party ranks, supporting Zachary Taylor for president. Breckinridge ably defended himself, but Sanders continued to attack him and Butler, claiming Butler would name Breckinridge <b>as</b> <b>his</b> <b>running</b> <b>mate,</b> even though Breckinridge was too young to qualify as vice president.|$|E
