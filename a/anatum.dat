5000|$|Three primary plant {{communities}} are frequently {{found on the}} Caja del Rio plateau: pinon-juniper savanna, pinon-juniper woodland, and Great Basin sage scrub. The most prevalent vegetative communities consist of a pinon (Pinus edulis) and juniper (Juniperus monosperma) overstory with a short grass understory. Tree densities often range between 100 and 300 trees per acre. Another large community consists of open grassland, with blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis), galleta (Pleuraphis jamesii), and various species of Stipa being the most common grasses. Common woody shrubs include chamisa (Chrysothamnus nauseosus), Apache plume (Fallugia paradoxa), four-wing saltbush (Atriplex canescens), and big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata). [...] Predatory mammals known {{to live in the}} Caja del Rio include black bear (Ursus americanus), mountain lion (Felis concolor), bobcat (Lynx rufus), coyote (Canis latrans), fox (Vulpes spp.), gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), ringtail (Bassariscus astutus), badger (Taxidea taxus), long-tailed weasel (Mustela frenata), western spotted skunk (Spilogale gracilis), and striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis). Non-predatory mammals known to be present include Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus), mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), raccoon (Procyon lotor), porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum), black-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus californicus), desert cottontail, (Sylvilagus auduboni), white-throated woodrat (Neotoma albigula), Botta's pocket gopher (Thomomys bottae), Colorado chipmunk (Neotamias quadrivittatus), pinyon mouse (Peromyscus truei), and deer mouse (Peromyscus spp.).

40|$|The {{emergence}} {{of resistance to}} antimicrobial agents within the salmonellas is a worldwide and severe problem. A case of treatment failure due to the {{emergence of}} resistance to ceftriaxone in Salmonella enterica serotype <b>Anatum</b> was studied. S. enterica serotype <b>Anatum</b> and Escherichia coli, both of which are susceptible to ceftriaxone, were initially isolated from a diabetic patient hospitalized for the treatment of wound and urinary tract infections. Resistant S. enterica serotype <b>Anatum</b> and E. coli strains were isolated concomitantly 2 weeks after the initiation of ceftriaxone therapy. The patient eventually died of a sepsis caused by the ceftriaxone-resistant salmonella. PCR, nucleotide sequence analysis, and DNA-DNA hybridization identified a blaCTX-M- 3 gene located on a 95. 1 -kb plasmid from the ceftriaxone-resistant isolates of S. enterica serotype <b>Anatum</b> and E. coli. The plasmid was proved to be conjugative. Molecular fingerprinting showed that the susceptible and resistant strains were genetically indistinguishable. The emergence of resistance to ceftriaxone in S. enterica serotype <b>Anatum</b> was due to the in vivo acquisition of a plasmid containing the blaCTX-M- 3 gene and was the cause for treatment failure in this patient...|$|E
40|$|Phenotypic and {{molecular}} techniques, including antimicrobial susceptibility testing, plasmid analysis, and {{pulsed-field gel electrophoresis}} (PFGE) were used to characterize 15 isolates of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Salmonella <b>anatum</b> cultured during a 16 mo period from horses and a veterinary clinic environment. The isolates were resistant to multiple antimicrobial agents and could be placed into 4 groups based on their antimicrobial resistance patterns. The isolates contained multiple plasmids {{ranging in size from}} 2 to > 100 kb that could be grouped into 3 different plasmid profile patterns; these patterns did not correlate with the antimicrobial resistance groupings. Furthermore, antimicrobial resistance was conjugatively transferable. Digestion of genomic DNA from the 15 isolates with 3 different restriction endonucleases, SfiI, SpeI, and XbaI followed by PFGE revealed a highly conserved restriction endonuclease digestion pattern. In contrast, diverse banding patterns were observed with S. <b>anatum</b> obtained from other sources. These observations suggest that the MDR S. <b>anatum</b> isolates represent a common outbreak strain even though they possess different, albeit similar, antibiograms and plasmid profiles. The study showed that PFGE is a useful epidemiological tool for discriminating between unrelated and outbreak-related strains of S. <b>anatum.</b> In conclusion, epidemiological studies of outbreaks caused by MDR isolates of S. <b>anatum</b> should consist of both genotypic and phenotypic methods of analysis...|$|E
40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} {{to determine the effects}} of Salmonella <b>anatum</b> and S. heidelberg infections on the differential leukocyte counts of baby chickens. Newly hatched broiler-type chicks were inoculated in the yolk sac with suspensions of either S. <b>anatum</b> or S. heidelberg. At 0, 24, 48, and 72 hr after inoculation, blood was taken by heart puncture from chicks of both inoculated groups and from a group of uninoculated chicks. The averages of the leukocyte counts of three or four chicks from each group were used as the blood values for specific time intervals. The six classes of leukocytes counted were lymphocytes, monocytes, juveniles, heterophils, eosinophils, and basophils. The leukocytes classified as juveniles were immature or degenerate heterophils and were found almost exclusively in the infected chicks. Changes in heterophil, juvenile, and lymphocyte counts were affected by both the number of cells in the inoculum (300 versus 3 million cells of S. <b>anatum)</b> and species (S. <b>anatum</b> and S. heidelberg). Infection with either Salmonella species resulted in the development of a severe heterophilic leukopenia, and a significant increase in the percentage of both juveniles and lymphocytes by 48 hr postinoculation.

40|$|Besides phage si', {{responsible}} for the antigenic conversion from 3, 10 to 3, 15 in group E Salmonella, S. thomasville was found to produce at least two additional types of temperate phage which differ from phages E" in plaque morphology, host range, responsibility for antigenic conversion, serological specificity, etc. This report deals with one of them, which forms large turbid plaque on S. <b>anatum</b> cells (Fig. 1) and has been designated as phage g 341, by the authors. {{in the process of}} single plaque isolation, a virulent phage C 341, which forms large clear plaque on S. <b>anatum</b> cells, was isolated from the phage gmi suspension. These two types of phage, g 341 and C 341, {{have been found to be}} indistinguishable from each other in serological specificity, host range and other pro- perties so far as examined, with the only exception of virulence. S. <b>anatum</b> cells which were lysogenized with phage ε 15 adsorbed neither phages and Cm nor phage ε 15, while S. <b>anatum</b> cells which were lysogenized with phage g 311 remained to be sensitive to phage ε 15 and to be of the same antigenic structure as that of the original S. <b>anatum</b> cells, though they were altered not to adsorb phages ｇ 341 and C 341. The observation that the above alteration resulted from lysogenization of S. <b>anatum</b> cells with phage g 341 was permanent and hereditary provides further evidence of the close relationship of prophage and bacterial nucleus, and suggests that the prophage either eliminates or in some way blocks the gene which controls receptor formation. In addition, the above findings, together with the lysogenic conversion in the antigens from 3, 10 to 3, 15, suggest that the alteration of the surface structure of bacterial cell by lysogenization is rather of usual happening...|$|E
40|$|Four serotypes of Salmonella enteritidis, <b>Anatum</b> ATCC 9270, Newbrunswick ATCC 1608, Oranienburg 200 E, and Pullorum RM, {{were studied}} to {{determine}} biological, chemical, or physical differences which might explain variations in Salmonella virulence as previously reported by McCullough and Eisele (J. Infect. Dis. 88 : 278 - 289, 1951; 89 : 259 - 265, 1951). These investigators found that serotype Pullorum was significantly less virulent than serotypes Newport, Derby, Barielly, Meleagridis and <b>Anatum</b> when fed to healthy humans. Results {{of our own}} experiments showed that serotype Pullorum RM had a generation time approximately twice that of serotype <b>Anatum</b> 9270.

The number of cells required to yield 1 g dry weight was substantially higher for serotype Pullorum RM than for serotypes <b>Anatum</b> 9270, Newbrunswick 1608, and Oranienburg 200 E. The yield of endotoxin per gram dry weight for serotype Pullorum RM averaged 22 mg/g, whereas yields of endotoxin for serotypes <b>Anatum</b> 9270, Newbrunswick 1608, and Oranienburg 200 E averaged 32 to 35 mg/g. The relative abundance of the four major fatty acids (measured by gas chromatography) also showed distinct differences among the serotypes. Pullorum RM contained less lauric and 3 -hydroxymyristic acids and more myristic and palmitic acids than the other three serotypes. The identity of 3 -hydroxymyristate was confirmed by mass spectroscopy. Serotype Pullorum RM required 10 times more lipopolysaccharides (endotoxin) to obtain a 50 % lethal dose in mice than the other three serotypes.

This study was undertaken {{to determine the extent to}} which Salmonella <b>anatum</b> may leach through tile-drained clay loam soil on which swine manure has been applied. For this purpose, swine manure was experimentally contaminated with S. <b>anatum</b> and applied to three tile-drained plots in winter of 2001 while another three plots served as negative controls. Following rainfall events in the spring of 2002 the tiles started to flow and leachate samples of subsurface water were collected at various time intervals and tested for S. <b>anatum.</b> Salmonella <b>anatum</b> was not found to leach into the subsurface drainage water indicating that it was either retained in the upper layers of soil or did not survive over winter.

40|$|A sudden {{increase}} {{in the incidence of}} ampicillin resistance was observed among Salmonella species isolated within New Zealand in 1973 [...] 4. This increase was due mainly to the apperance and proliferation of Salmonella newington and Salmonella <b>anatum</b> serotypes resistant to ampicillin. The plasmid complements of 14 ampicillin-resistant S. newington and S. <b>anatum</b> isolates obtained from widely separated geographical areas within New Zealand between 1973 and 1974 were characterized by agarose gel electrophoresis. Each contained one or more plasmids ranging in molecular weight from 1. 4 to 42 Mdal. Eleven isolates contained a self-transmissible plasmid of 33 Mdal which encoded resistance to ampicillin. After transfer to Escherichia coli, the 33 Mdal R-plasmids from each of these isolates were shown to be identical by restriction endonuclease analysis. The remaining three strains contained ampicillin R-plasmids having molecular weights of 35, 37. 5 and 42 Mdal. These plasmids were shown by restriction endonuclease analysis {{to be related to the}} 33 Mdal R-plasmid.

40|$|Subspecies {{relationships}} within the peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) have been long debated {{because of the}} polytypic nature of melanin-based plumage characteristics used in subspecies designations and potential differentiation of local subpopulations due to philopatry. In North America, understanding the evolutionary relationships among subspecies may have been further complicated {{by the introduction of}} captive bred peregrines originating from non-native stock, as part of recovery efforts associated with mid 20 th century population declines resulting from organochloride pollution. Alaska hosts all three nominal subspecies of North American peregrine falcons-F. p. tundrius, <b>anatum,</b> and pealei-for which distributions in Alaska are broadly associated with nesting locales within Arctic, boreal, and south coastal maritime habitats, respectively. Unlike elsewhere, populations of peregrine falcon in Alaska were not augmented by captive-bred birds during the late 20 th century recovery efforts. Population genetic differentiation analyses of peregrine populations in Alaska, based on sequence data from the mitochondrial DNA control region and fragment data from microsatellite loci, failed to uncover genetic distinction between populations of peregrines occupying Arctic and boreal Alaskan locales. However, the maritime subspecies, pealei, was genetically differentiated from Arctic and boreal populations, and substructured into eastern and western populations. Levels of interpopulational gene flow between <b>anatum</b> and tundrius were generally higher than between pealei and either <b>anatum</b> or tundrius. Estimates based on both marker types revealed gene flow between augmented Canadian populations and unaugmented Alaskan populations. While we make no attempt at formal taxonomic revision, our data suggest that peregrine falcons occupying habitats in Alaska and the North Pacific coast of North America belong to two distinct regional groupings-a coastal grouping (pealei) and a boreal/Arctic grouping (currently <b>anatum</b> and tundrius) -each comprised of discrete populations that are variously intra-regionally connected...|$|E

40|$|International audienceDuring {{the period}} from 2001 to 2004, a total of 72 {{isolates}} of Salmonella enterica serovars: <b>Anatum</b> (n= 40), Enteritidis (n= 18), Corvallis (n= 8), and Typhimurium (n= 6), of various origins (mainly food and diarrhoeagenic stool samples), were collected and further characterized by antibiotic resistance, plasmid analysis, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Forty-five isolates presented multidrug resistance to antibiotics. Among which one S. enterica serovar <b>Anatum</b> isolate was resistant to 11 antibiotics, and one S. enterica serovar Typhimurium DT 104 isolate was resistant to eight antibiotics. Plasmid profiling identified eight plasmid profiles (with 1 - 5 plasmids) among the isolates, of which one plasmid profile (P 01) was predominant. XbaI PFGE analysis revealed {{the presence of a}} predominant clone of the four studied Salmonella serovars circulating in Tunisia throughout the years 2001 - 2004...|$|E
