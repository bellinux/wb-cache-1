In accordance with Machinery Directive 2006 / 42 /EC and the standards ISO 4254 - 1 and DIN EN 14017, <b>fertilizer</b> <b>distributors</b> undergo a risk assessment before construction and market entry to ensure their complying with these legal recommendations and to eliminate largely the risk of injury for the operators. To determine the accident scenarios, causes, and technical solutions, a narrative analysis of 14 reports of accidents that led to moderate and serious injuries from 2008 to 2010 was done, eight victims interviewed, and seven accident machines and eight new ones, which were sold in 2013, evaluated according to applicable regulations. Mostly farm managers were involved in accidents with mineral <b>fertilizer</b> <b>distributors</b> during coupling and uncoupling and filling mainly on the farmyard. During coupling and uncoupling, farm managers collided with the machine itself, and during filling with the fertilizer chunks of the big bags. Falls from the machine were caused by slips and missteps during fertilizing, filling, and cleaning tasks. Farm managers were hit by the machine by coming {{into contact with the}} running spreading unit during fertilization and maintenance tasks. The accident machines showed large and the new machines low permanent deficits in instruction and warning notices as well in constructional execution. Potential constructive improvements are the standardized provision of instructions and warnings, standard-compliant boarding (ladders, grab rails, platforms, etc.) and loading means (lift arms, platforms) for filling and monitoring the container contents, sufficient space or hydraulic coupling elements for coupling, uncoupling, and unfolding of spreader units, and protective devices for agitators in new machines.

40|$|As {{the result}} of 15 years of {{research}} (50 staff years of effort) Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), through its involvement in fluidized-bed combustion, magnetohydrodynamics, {{and a variety of}} environmental programs, has produced extensive computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software and models to predict the multiphase hydrodynamic and reactive behavior of fluid-solids motions and interactions in complex fluidized-bed reactors (FBRS) and slurry systems. This has resulted in the FLUFIX, IRF, and SLUFIX computer programs. These programs are based on fluid-solids hydrodynamic models and can predict information important to the designer of atmospheric or pressurized bubbling and circulating FBR, fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) and slurry units to guarantee optimum efficiency with minimum release of pollutants into the environment. This latter issue will become of paramount importance with the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendment (CAAA) of 1995. Solids motion is also the key to understanding erosion processes. Erosion rates in FBRs and pneumatic and slurry components are computed by ANL`s EROSION code to predict the potential metal wastage of FBR walls, intervals, <b>feed</b> <b>distributors,</b> and cyclones. Only the FLUFIX and IRF codes will be reviewed in the paper together with highlights of the validations because of length limitations.

40|$|This Working Paper for the South Asia {{regional}} {{hub of the}} Pro-Poor Livestock Policy Initiative presents the case for using poultry, in very small units of 5 - 10 adult birds, {{as a means of}} alleviating the poverty of rural women in the region. Policies and procedures that affect the success of such initiatives are examined. The author draws on personal experience and an extensive literature review. The main focus of the paper is a review of {{what is known as the}} Bangladesh Model. Emphasising that this is not a static model, the author explains its evolution by Bangladesh's largest NGO, BRAC, working with the government department responsible for livestock services. The main feature of the model is that the supply of inputs and services are turned into income earning opportunities for poor people. The focus is on poverty reduction, rather than on increasing the supply of eggs and poultry meat. The main components are the involvement of NGOs that have access to groups of very poor women, the provision by NGOs of micro-credit and training to help groups establish small, semi-scavenging, egg-laying units, and special training for poultry workers, <b>feed</b> <b>distributors</b> and egg traders. The Bangladesh model has been incorporated into several major, Danida-sponsored development projects. The paper includes a discussion of its impact on poor families, and the policy and institutional implications that have arisen, in particular the role of government support in terms of the provision of veterinary and other services, research and training. The Bangladesh experience is contrasted to that of India where, in some States, the commercial sector has a strong presence. The author recommends that a survey be undertaken in India and Nepal that should examine livestock policies at (selected) State and at central level. The experiences of NGOs that have used poultry as a means of alleviating poverty should be explored and also the degree to which understanding, skills and knowledge exist in organisations responsible for policy, field level implementation, and research and training.

The fertilizer distributed by these enterprises sold at a universally reduced price, between 20 and 60 percent of the full market cost. Currency over-valuation also created an additional [...] "implicit" [...] subsidy for imported fertilizer. These policies were seen {{as a way to}} counteract the effects of soil erosion and depletion, and increase crop yields by bringing fertilizer within the reach of subsistence farmers. [...] This followed the dominant ‘modernization’ model of the period, which aimed to develop production systems in the sector through the promotion of new technologies like fertilizer and improved hybrid seeds. [...] The subsidy programs often suffered from multiple problems. Inefficient bureaucracies contributed to delays in fertilizer delivery. Overstaffing and lack of efficiency incentives increased overall program costs. In cases of inadequate budgets, fertilizer was rationed, barring farmers from accessing sufficient amounts to apply to their crops. Finally, below market-level pricing disincentivized and displaced private <b>distributors</b> of <b>fertilizer</b> who no longer found it economically feasible to compete with subsidized fertilizer.

In order to test the reliability of the detection system, some failures or malfunctions were simulated, such as the rupture of the <b>agitator</b> or <b>feeding</b> pumps. Results showed that the divergence criterion was able to detect dangerous situations, by distinguishing in advance runaway phenomena from situations under normal operating control. In particular during the simulation of the agitator breakage, the presence of three thermo-resistance sensors located at different positions inside the reactor, allowed to identify the formation of hot-spots due to the missing of stirring. In that case the stability of the emulsion was lost and polymerization occurred with a higher chemical heat flow, with potential dangerous consequences such as the explosion of the reactor...|$|R

40|$|Salinity Gradient Power by Reverse Electrodialysis (SGP-RE) {{technology}} {{allows the}} production of electricity from the different chemical potentials of two differently concentrated salty solutions flowing in alternate channels suitably separated by selective ion exchange membranes. In SGP-RE, {{as well as in}} conventional ElectroDialysis (ED) technology, the process performance dramatically depends on the stack geometry and the internal fluid dynamics conditions: optimizing the system geometry in order to guarantee lower pressure drops (DP) and uniform flow rates distribution within the channels is a topic of primary importance. Although literature studies on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis and optimization of spacer-filled channels have been recently increasing in number and range of applications, only a few efforts have been focused on the analysis of the overall performance of the process. In particular, the proper attention should be devoted to verify whether the spacer geometry optimization really represents the main factor affecting the overall process performance. In the present work, realized within the EU-FP 7 funded REAPower project, CFD simulations were carried out in order to assess the effects of different parameters on the global process efficiency, such as the choice of spacer material and morphology, and the optimization of feed and blowdown distribution systems. Spacer material and morphology can affect the fluid dynamics inside each channel. In particular, the appropriate choice of net spacer material can influence the slip/no-slip condition of the flow on the spacer wires, thus significantly affecting the channel fluid dynamics in terms of pressure drops. A Unit Cell approach was adopted to investigate the effect of the different choices on the fluid flow along the channel. Also, the possibility of choosing a porous medium to substitute the net spacer was theoretically addressed. Such investigation focused on the porosity and the fiber radius required to respect the process constrains of pressure drops and mechanical stability. On the other hand, the overall pressure drops of a SGP-RE or ED stack can be considered as resulting from different contributions: the pressure drop relevant to the <b>feed</b> <b>distributor,</b> the pressure drop inside the channel, and the pressure drop in the discharging collector. The choice of the optimal stack geometry is, therefore, strongly related to the need of both minimizing each of the above terms and obtaining the most uniform feed streams distribution among the stack channels. In order to investigate such aspects, simulations were performed on a simplified ideal planar stack with either 50 spacer-less or 50 spacer-filled channels. The effect of the distribution/collector channel thickness and geometry on single-channel flow rates and overall pressure drops in the system was analyzed and a significant influence of distributor layout and size on the overall process performance was found...|$|R

I study the use of hybrid maize and fertilizer in Kenya, where there are persistent cross-sectional differences in aggregate adoption rates with a large fraction of households switching in and out of adoption. By allowing for selection of farmers into technology use via comparative advantage differences, I examine whether the yield returns to adopting hybrid maize vary across farmers. If so, high average returns can coexist with low returns for the marginal farmer. My findings indicate the existence of two interesting subgroups in the population. A small group of farmers has potentially high returns from adopting the technologies. Yet, they do not adopt. This lack of adoption appears to stem from supply and infrastructure constraints, such as the distance to <b>fertilizer</b> <b>distributors.</b> In addition, a larger group of farmers faces very low returns to adopting hybrid maize, but chooses to adopt.

40|$|The liquid–liquid {{extraction}} process is well-known for its complexity and often entails intensive modeling and computational efforts to simulate its dynamic behaviour. However, rigorous mathematical models are usually impractical or are of limited usefulness for control system design. Therefore, {{there is a}} need to derive simpler models for this process. Reduced-order linear models can be derived through applying system identification on the input–output simulation data. As a first step, a rigorous model for dynamic simulation of an {{extraction process}} is developed. This model employs an improved detailed stage-wise mixing stage with backmixing and it takes into account the variation in hydrodynamics, mass transfer, and physical properties throughout the length of the extraction column. It also approximates end effects by incorporating two mixing stages at both ends in addition to calculation of mass transfer within calming zones through the use of a mass transfer weight factor. The model is validated with dynamic experimental data for a nine stage Scheibel extraction column of type I. The simulation model is shown to be accurate for prediction of process behaviour under different operating conditions. Dynamic analysis of the process is conducted on the developed rigorous simulation model. Then, system identification is applied to derive linear time-invariant reduced-order models, which relate the input process variables (<b>agitator</b> speed, solvent <b>feed</b> flowrate and concentration, feed concentration and flowrate) to the output process variables (raffinate concentration and extract concentration).

KUD Luber Mukti Jaya is the rural {{economy and the}} role of subsidized <b>distributor</b> as a <b>fertilizer.</b> This research aimed at KUD Luber know how to increase its role the income, constraint members of the increasing income, and KUD what is the solution to solve the problem. Using research is a qualitative data and technical this collection conducted in an interview that and the observations. The population of this research is 145 person. The drawing of sample is purposive sampling with the number of land that have been adjusted to member of the members who have 1 hektar. The new formula is based on the calculation of Slovin with 5 % of the level of error. After doing the calculations of sampling was 86 reponden. Research shows that KUD Luber has a role to enhance its earnings and revenue could be seen from the analysis of this member. Income from analisi be higher than before being a member. Facing constraint KUD Luber to enhance income the member several members of the member that does not participate in the training education carried out by KUD Luber, and the problem is in the distribution of any fertilizer. A solution used KUD Luber to overcome the problem of absence of members by doing approach with groups and to delay fertilizer solution the board kud luber obliged to provide stock in KUD Luber for the next three weeks...|$|R
40|$|Fertilization {{plays an}} {{important}} role in increasing the production of palm oil. Fertilization by manually deployed using the hand is considered less effective because the dose of fertilizer is not uniform and improper fertilization methods. The purpose of thisresearch is to design and make the hopper (tank <b>fertilizer</b> <b>distributor)</b> for precise fit required dose and volume of uniform fertilizer for each tree. The case study method is used to getinformation about fertilization technique and dose of fertilizer. The information obtained is used to design and acquire the dimensions, the shape of the hopper is made. Design methodusing descriptive design french.
