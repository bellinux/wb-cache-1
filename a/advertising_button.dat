5000|$|Lenticular lens technology, a major {{development}} in printing with significant applications in consumer marketing, brought numerous prizes — sometimes called tilt cards, flickers, or wiggle pictures — including images illustrated to morph from one view to another, show motion, or show depth (3D). Victor Anderson, {{a leader in}} the commercial success of lenticular printing, co-founded the Vari-Vue company in New York, which by the 1950s had produced millions of lenticular products, and lenticulars had become a pop culture craze. [...] Anderson created the first animated <b>advertising</b> <b>button</b> with the [...] "I LIKE IKE" [...] slogan for Eisenhower's campaign in 1951. [...] In the 1950s, Vari-Vue produced lenticular prizes under the [...] "Magic-Motion" [...] brand that were inserted into packages of numerous consumer products, including Cracker Jack popcorn confection in the US, and Locatelli’s popular Formaggino Mio cheese in Italy. Anderson related in a 1996 interview that he had made animated prizes for Cheerios, about 40 million of them, that were stuck {{to the side of the}} box, but so many of the prizes were being stolen before they even hit the shelves that Cheerios had to start inserting the prizes inside the boxes. [...] Two Japan companies provided prizes around the world in the 1960s and 70s, Toppan, with their [...] "Top Stereo" [...] brand, and Dai-Nippon.|$|E

By 1895 hun-dreds of {{manufacturers}} of bicycles, tires, and accessories wooed buyers with these collectible lapel pins, distributed free {{or for the}} price of stamps. Organizations similarly promoted causes such as good roads or events such as races. Most buttons were small (7 / 8 -inch diameter) and made from celluloid, an easily molded synthetic discovered in the search for an ivory substitute. Others were old-fashioned metal. Durable, attractive, and inexpensive, these colorful promotions (now in the Minnesota Historical Society’s museum collections) reflect the enthusiastic response of the American public to two-wheeled mobility. For a look at the craze in the Red River Valley and the social change that accompanied it, turn to the article beginning on page 268. Photograph by Peter Latner Emma Brock (1886 – 1974) described her career choice, to write and illustrate children’s books, in the simplest ofterms: “I am interested in children. ” More than 30 books stand as witness to her interest and ability...|$|R

To explore why this phenomenon occurred, Langenkamp visits six horror conventions, and tries to discern why the villain became the celebrated figure. After interviewing several attendees, Langenkamp learns that while Nancy Thompson's impact on fans is subtle, she still represents strength and intelligence in {{the hearts and minds}} of many. For the <b>advertising</b> campaign, campaign <b>buttons</b> were given out that displayed [...] "I am Nancy". A Facebook page allowed Nancy fans to share their artwork, photographs, and sentiments about the character. The film won a Best Editing Award at the Amsterdam Film Festival. In addition to interviewing Nancy fans, the documentary also features interviews with Wes Craven, Robert Englund and Jessica Craven (Wes Craven's daughter). Langenkamp learned from Craven that: ...|$|R
