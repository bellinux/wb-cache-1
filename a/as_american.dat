5|$|Additional {{construction}} costs meant the final total was £736,000, up from an original estimate of £235,000. The need for heating {{brought with it}} the requirement for boiler houses, plus additional foundations which were needed for the buildings {{to the north of}} the railway. Lieutenant J.G.N. Clifts of the Royal Engineers created the design for the site and buildings, and the contractor involved was a U.S. Army civil engineering company, appearing on records <b>as</b> <b>American</b> Construction Company.

5|$|American's service {{peaked in}} 1992 with 265 daily departures, after which flights were {{gradually}} scaled back until the hub eventually closed in 1995.

Southwest Airlines quickly filled the void by seizing 54% of the Nashville market and making it a focus city, with American remaining as the second-largest carrier at Nashville, followed by Delta Air Lines.|$|E
