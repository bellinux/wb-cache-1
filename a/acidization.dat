40|$|The {{effect of}} HCl on authigenic {{chlorite}} {{in three different}} sandstones has been examined uisng an Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope (ESEM), together with conventional analytical techniques. The ESEM enabled chlorites to be directly observed in situ at high magnifications during HCl treatment, and was particularly effective in allowing the same chlorite areas to be closely compared before and after acid treatment. Chlorites were reacted with 1 M to 10 M HCl at temperatures up to 80 °C and for periods up to five months. After all treatments, chlorites show extensive leaching of iron, magnesium and aluminum, and their crystalline structure is destroyed. However, despite these major compositional and structural changes, chlorites show little or no visible evidence of acid attack, with precise morphological detail of individual plates preserved in all samples following acid treatments. Chlorite dissolution, sensu stricto, did not occur {{as a result of}} <b>acidization</b> of the host sandstones. Acid-treated chlorides are likely to exits in a structurally weakened state that may make them susceptible to physical disintegration during fluid flow. Accordingly, fines migration may be a significant engineering problem associated with the <b>acidization</b> of chlorite-bearing sandstones. © 1993...|$|E

30|$|Carbon {{steel is}} a major {{construction}} material and is widely used for downhole tubular, casings, flow lines and transmission pipelines in petroleum industry [1, 2]. It is also used as a structural component in ships manufacture. Acidic solutions are extensively used as aggressive solutions in acid processes of pickling, cleaning, descaling, and oil well <b>acidization</b> [1, 2, 3]. During descaling processes that remove rust and mill scale formed during production, steel and other alloys are immersed in acidic solutions. Due to the aggressiveness of acids, steel corrodes severely during these processes particularly {{with the use of}} hydrochloric acid, which results in terrible waste of both resources and money [1, 2]. The damage due to corrosion can be decreased using of corrosion inhibitors.|$|E
40|$|<b>Acidization</b> was studied on a uranium {{sandstone}} deposit in Inner Mongolia with low–permeability {{and heavy}} calcium cementation. Acid dissolving test indicates that hydrochloric acid, formic acid and mud acid can easily dissolve formation minerals. With proper volumes and concentrations of acids used, {{the risk of}} precipitation of reaction products could be minimized. Core flow acidizing trial shows that the acidic fluid systems of hydrochloride acid, formic acid or acetic acid can significantly improve the core permeability. The average permeability has increased by 763 percent for the above three systems. But mud acid didn’t increase the core permeability; on the contrary, it caused formation damage, and led to lowering permeability. In the pilot test, the injection rate has improved by 118 percent for 6 wells.

40|$|International audienceOver {{the past}} 20 years, the Soultz {{experimental}} geothermal site in Alsace, France, has been explored in detail by the drilling of five boreholes, {{three of which}} extend to 5 km depth. Data on geology, fluid geochemistry, temperature, microseismicity, hydraulics and geomechanics have been collected and interpreted by the various teams from the participating European countries and their international collaborators. Two reservoirs have been developed within granite at depths of 3. 5 and 5 km. The reservoir at 3. 5 km was formed from two wells, 450 m apart, {{both of which were}} subjected to hydraulic stimulation injections. The system was circulated continuously for 4 months at 25 kg/s in 1997 using a downhole pump, and yielded results that were extremely encouraging. The impedance reduced to 0. 1 MPa/l/s, the first time this long-standing target had been attained. Construction of a deeper system began shortly afterwards with the drilling of 3 deviated wells to 5 km true vertical depth, where the temperature was 200 degrees C. The wells were drilled in a line, 600 m apart at reservoir depth, and all were hydraulically stimulated and subjected to <b>acidization</b> injections. The 3 -well system was circulated under buoyancy drive for 5 months in 2005 with injection in the central well, GPK- 3, and production from the two outer wells, GPK- 2 and GPK- 4. This showed good linkage between one doublet pair, but not the other. Further <b>acidization</b> operations on the low-productivity well led to its productivity increasing to almost the same level as the other wells. Construction of a power plant at the site was completed in 2008 and a trial circulation with a production pump in one well and the other shut-in was conducted with power production. Downhole pumps are now installed in both production wells in preparation for long-term circulation of the system. In this article we present an overview of the principal accomplishments at Soultz over the past two decades, and highlight the main results, issues identified, and lessons learnt...|$|E

40|$|<b>Acidization</b> is an oil {{reservoir}} stimulation technique for increasing oil well productivity. Hydrochloric acid {{is used in}} {{oil and gas production}} to stimulate the formation. The acid treatment occurs through N 80 steel tubes. The process requires a high degree of corrosion inhibition of tubing material (N 80 steel). In the present investigation effect of synthesized amino acid compounds, namely, acetamidoleucine (AAL) and benzamidoleucine (BAL) as corrosion inhibitors for N 80 steel in 15 % HCl solution was studied by polarization, AC impedance (EIS), and weight loss measurements. It was found that both the inhibitors were effective inhibitors and their inhibition efficiency was significantly increased with increasing concentration of inhibitors. Polarization curves revealed that the studied inhibitors represent mixed type inhibitors. AC impedance studies revealed that charge transfer resistance increases and double layer capacitance decreases in presence of inhibitors. Adsorption of inhibitors at the surface of N 80 steel was found to obey Langmuir isotherm...|$|E
40|$|The United States {{has seen}} {{resurgence}} in petroleum production, mainly driven by technology improvements in unconventional {{oil and gas}} stimulation from shale formations. Hydraulic fracturing, one of the unconventional oil and gas stimulation technologies, has caught a lot of public attention {{that has led to}} more research on it and its impacts as well increased debate over more regulatory oversight. Other unconventional oil stimulation techniques have more or less been left out of the discussion. One of these less frequently discussed techniques is acidizing. Acidizing is a term used for all types of acid use that increase or keep up well productivity or injectivity. The use of these unconventional stimulation techniques has greatly increased over the past decade. The expansion of tight oil and shale gas extraction using unconventional oil stimulation has raised concerns about its potential environmental and health impacts. These concerns include potential direct impacts to groundwater and surface water quality, water supplies, and air quality. Much attention has been on the impacts of hydraulic fracturing with little to no attention on acidizing. This research looks at the acidizing process {{and for the first time}} defines what the chemicals of <b>acidization</b> are, in what amount they are used, and what their toxicity is. The analysis of the present data shows there have been over 600 instances of acidizing in urbanized Southern and Central California from April 2013 to August 2015. Although most of the chemicals of acidizing are similar to hydraulic fracturing, those used most frequently are different. There are close to 200 specific chemicals used in <b>acidization,</b> with at least 28 of them being F-graded hazardous chemicals, which are known carcinogens, mutagens, reproductive toxins, developmental toxins, endocrine disruptors, or high acute toxicity chemicals. Some are used frequently in the range of 100 - 1000 kg per treatment, such as hydrofluoric acid, xylene, diethylene glycol and ethyl benzene. Unlike hydraulic fracturing the chemical concentrations in acidizing are high, ranging from 6 - 18 %, and the waste returns can be highly acidic, in the range of pH 0 - 3. In addition to analyzing the chemicals and their potential impacts this research looks at the legal framework for regulating acidizing activities. Provisions of several federal environmental laws can apply to acidizing activities. The federal role in regulating O&G extraction activities has been the subject of considerable debate and legislative proposals for several years. The Administration has pursued a number of regulatory initiatives related to unconventional O&G development, primarily hydraulic fracturing, under existing statutory authorities. Acidizing, however, has been almost entirely been left out of new proposals. This research sheds light on this topic and suggests areas where acidizing can be better regulated. In addition to looking at the federal laws and state bills in place for regulating <b>acidization,</b> this research specifically looks at a better regulating scheme for stormwater runoff from oil and gas facilities. Contaminated stormwater runoff from oil and gas operations can pose a significant threat to surface waters. The research examines the extent of this threat and recommends more specific permitting requirements and best management practices to protect surface waters. With increasing use of unconventional oil stimulation techniques like acidizing, it is important to understand the technology, the threats caused by them, and how to best protect the public and environment from any potential harm. This dissertation research attempts to shed light on these issues related to acidizing...|$|E
40|$|Cigarette butts {{are the one}} of {{the most}} common garbage worldwide, as an {{estimated}} 4. 5 trillion cigarette butts are deposited somewhere into the environment every year. Chemicals such as arsenic, nicotine, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and heavy metals have been found to leach into water and can be the source of toxicity to life in marine and freshwater environments. The present study is to isolate crude extracts from littered cigarette butts using polar solvents, which is used as corrosion inhibitor for J 55 oil well tubular steel used in <b>acidization</b> of oil well and gas production. The chemical compounds present in the crude extracts analyzed using LC-MS and ASS.

30|$|A highly {{viscous fluid}} not only {{provides}} valuable retardation but {{also tends to}} spread throughout the core thus moving towards lower permeable zones. In contrast, stimulating fluids with lower viscosity tends to predominately invade the high permeable zones (Zakaria and Nasr-El-Din 2015). A high viscous emulsion indicates its droplet sizes to be small which provides an increase in stability of the emulsion (Al-Mutairi et al. 2009 a), this in return provides emulsion acid solubility resistance against high temperature conditions. The core flooding experiment presented here also validates {{the results of the}} acid solubility API RP- 40 test as well as the effect of droplet size conducted before (as shown in Table  4; Fig.  11, respectively). The Jatropha oil-based emulsified acid has a lower acid solubility percentage even with the increase in temperature, thus allowing acid to be consumed much slowly and steps up the stimulation process. Figure  14 shows the cores after exposed to <b>acidization</b> by Jatropha oil-based (a) and diesel oil-based (b) emulsified acids and the flushed out acids after acidizing.|$|E
40|$|Production {{enhancement}} can {{be achieved}} by bridging the gap between the maximum flow rate and the operating point of a well. This can be done by stimulating the well either by matrix <b>acidization</b> or hydraulic fracturing. However, Fracture stimulation is used to overcome the adverse effects of formation damage and low permeability, accelerate production, increase reserves and control formation solids. These fracturing applications require different fracture stimulation designs to achieve their objectives; therefore a means of evaluating treatment designs is important to determine which of well is the optimum approach. In a field that has multiple wells to stimulate, the ones of adverse effect need to be rank first. Thus, this study was carried out to develop a model for stimulation candidate well selection base on skin due to damage, production increase, economics, payback period and the R-factor. Seven wells were used and the results obtained after the candidate well selection for stimulation job will help the company to prioritize the wells based on the model they choose...|$|E
30|$|Since {{the onset}} of {{industrial}} revolution, mild steel {{has been used as}} an alloy for a number of structural and industrial applications [1]. Acid solutions are used in various industries during acid pickling, acid descaling, industrial cleaning and oil-well <b>acidization,</b> etc. [2]. Acidic media results in a uniform corrosion of mild steel with pitting at high concentrations of acid [3, 4, 5, 6]. The use of inhibitors {{is one of the most}} proficient methods for protection of metals from corrosion in acid medium. Organic compounds containing N, O, S heteroatoms and π electrons in their molecules are considered as effective corrosion inhibitors [2, 3, 4, 5]. The inhibitor molecules form a protective film on metal surface that prevents corrosion [7]. Nowadays, researchers are mainly focusing on the use of non-toxic and “green” corrosion inhibitors, e.g., plant extracts and drugs to obviate the harmful effect of chemicals on environment [8, 9, 10]. Because of their non-toxic characteristics [18] and negligible negative impacts on the aquatic environment [19], drugs (chemical medicines) seem to be the ideal candidates to replace traditional toxic corrosion inhibitors [9]. A number of studies are available describing the application of drugs as efficient corrosion inhibitors [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17].|$|E

40|$|Stimulation of {{sandstone}} formations is {{a challenging}} task, which involves several chemicals and physical interactions of the acid with the formation. Some of these reactions {{may result in}} formation damage. Mud acid has been successfully used to stimulate sandstone reservoirs {{for a number of}} years. It is a mixture of hydrofluoric (HF) and hydrochloric (HCl) acids designed to dissolve clays and siliceous fines accumulated in the near-wellbore region. Matrix acidizing may also be used to increase formation permeability in undamaged wells. The change may be up to 50 % to 100 % with the mud acid. For any acidizing process, the selection of acid (Formulation and Concentration) and the design (Pre-flush, Main Acid, After-flush) is very important. Different researchers are using different combinations of acids with different concentrations to get the best results for <b>acidization.</b> Mainly the common practice is combination of Hydrochloric Acid – Hydrofluoric with Concentration (3 % HF – 12 % HCl). This paper presents the results of a laboratory investigation of Orthophosphoric acid instead of hydrochloric acid in one combination and the second combination is Fluoboric and formic acid and the third one is formic and hydrofluoric acid.

40|$|International audienceOver {{two decades}} of {{research}} and development of the EGS Soultz reservoir carried out with French, German and Swiss governmental and European funding, a pilot geothermal power plant has been built by a French-German industrial consortium. The drilling of various exploration and geothermal boreholes at great depth, the deepest penetration into crystalline rock in France, has yielded fundamental insights into the geology, nature of fracturing, fluid geochemistry, temperature and hydraulic properties of deep crystalline rock masses. After the drilling operations, all the wells were hydraulically stimulated as well as chemically stimulated. Several circulation tests were done and showed encouraging results. The 3 -well system was circulated in 2005 under buoyancy drive for 5 months with re-injection in the central well GPK- 3 and production from the two outer wells, GPK- 2 and GPK- 4. This showed a good linkage between one duplet pair (GPK- 3 -GPK- 2) but not the other (GPK- 3 -GPK- 4). Further <b>acidization</b> operations on the low-productivity well, GPK- 4, led to its productivity increasing to almost the same level than the other well. On surface, a binary power plant was designed and built based on an ORC technology (Organic Rankine Cycle). Surface equipments (turbine, heat exchanger, filtering system) and a corrosion loop as well as two different types of down-hole pumps (Line Shaft Pump-LSP, Electro Submersible Pump-ESP) were installed respectively on surface and in the production wells in 2008.

40|$|Carbonate matrix <b>acidization</b> extends a well's {{effective}} {{drainage radius}} by dissolving rock and forming conductive channels (wormholes) from the wellbore. Wormholing {{is a dynamic}} process that involves balance between the acid injection rate and reaction rate. Generally, injection rate is well defined where injection profiles can be controlled, whereas the reaction rate {{can be difficult to}} obtain due to its complex dependency on interstitial velocity, fluid composition, rock surface properties etc. Conventional wormhole propagation models largely ignore the impact of reaction products. When implemented in a job design, the significant errors can result in treatment fluid schedule, rate, and volume. A more accurate method to simulate carbonate matrix acid treatments would accomodate the effect of reaction products on reaction kinetics. It is the purpose of this work to properly account for these effects. This is an important step in achieving quantitative predictability of wormhole penetration during an acidzing treatment. This paper describes the laboratory procedures taken to obtain the reaction-product impacted kinetics at downhole conditions using a rotating disk apparatus, and how this new set of kinetics data was implemented in a 3 D wormholing model to predict wormhole morphology and penetration velocity. The model explains some of the differences in wormhole morphology observed in limestone core flow experiments where injection pressure impacts the mass transfer of hydrogen ions to the rock surface. The model uses a CT scan rendered porosity field to capture the finer details of the rock fabric and then simulates the fluid flow through the rock coupled with reactions. Such a validated model can serve as a base to scale up to near wellbore reservoir and 3 D radial flow geometry allowing a more quantitative acid treatment design...|$|E
40|$|Maximizing Storage Rate and Capacity and Insuring the Environmental Integrity of Carbon Dioxide Sequestration in Geological Formations The U. S. {{and other}} {{countries}} may enter into an agreement that will require {{a significant reduction in}} CO 2 emissions in the medium to long term. In order to achieve such goals without drastic reductions in fossil fuel usage, CO 2 must be removed from the atmosphere and be stored in acceptable reservoirs. The research outlined in this proposal deals with developing a methodology to determine the suitability of a particular geologic formation for the long-term storage of CO 2 and technologies for the economical transfer and storage of CO 2 in these formations. A novel well-logging technique using nuclear-magnetic resonance (NMR) will be developed to characterize the geologic formation including the integrity and quality of the reservoir seal (cap rock). Well-logging using NMR does not require coring, and hence, can be performed much more quickly and efficiently. The key element in the economical transfer and storage of the CO 2 is hydraulic fracturing the formation to achieve greater lateral spreads and higher throughputs of CO 2. Transport, compression, and drilling represent the main costs in CO 2 sequestration. The combination of well-logging and hydraulic fracturing has the potential of minimizing these costs. It is possible through hydraulic fracturing {{to reduce the number of}} injection wells by an order of magnitude. Many issues will be addressed as part of the proposed research to maximize the storage rate and capacity and insure the environmental integrity of CO 2 sequestration in geological formations. First, correlations between formation properties and NMR relaxation times will be firmly established. A detailed experimental program will be conducted to determine these correlations. Second, improved hydraulic fracturing models will be developed which are suitable for CO 2 sequestration as opposed to enhanced oil recovery (EOR). Although models that simulate the fracturing process exist, they can be significantly improved by extending the models to account for nonsymmetric, nonplanar fractures, coupling the models to more realistic reservoir simulators, and implementing advanced multiphase flow models for the transport of proppant. Third, it may be possible to deviate from current hydraulic fracturing technology by using different proppants (possibly waste materials that need to be disposed of, e. g., asbestos) combined with different hydraulic fracturing carrier fluids (possibly supercritical CO 2 itself). Because current technology is mainly aimed at enhanced oil recovery, it may not be ideally suited for the injection and storage of CO 2. Finally, advanced concepts such as increasing the injectivity of the fractured geologic formations through <b>acidization</b> with carbonated water will be investigated. Saline formations are located through most of the continental United States. Generally, where saline formations are scarce, oil and gas reservoirs and coal beds abound. By developing the technology outlined here, it will be possible to remove CO 2 at the source (power plants, industry) and inject it directly into nearby geological formations, without releasing it into the atmosphere. The goal of the proposed research is to develop a technology capable of sequestering CO 2 in geologic formations at a cost of US $ 10 per ton...|$|E
