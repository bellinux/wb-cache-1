5|$|Children of Mana was {{designed}} by series creator Koichi Ishii, directed by Yoshiki Ito, and produced by Takashi Orikata and Katsuji Aoyama. The game was a moderate commercial success: it sold 100,000 copies in its first week of release, and over 280,000 copies in Japan {{by the end of}} 2006. While critics praised the graphics and music <b>as</b> <b>beautiful</b> and unique, they found the combat simplistic and repetitive, and the story insubstantial.|$|E
5|$|Deep Blue is {{the first}} alien to return, taking {{the form of a}} human boy and going to sleep within him. Quiche, Pie, and Tart arrive later to remove humans from Earth and allow the {{remaining}} aliens to return.

5|$|In 1980 Chrisye {{appeared}} in the Indonesian film Seindah Rembulan (<b>As</b> <b>Beautiful</b> as the Moon); at first reluctant to accept the role, he was convinced by Sys NS {{that it would be}} fun. He later regretted the decision, considering the film crew unprofessional and often fighting with director Syamsul Fuad. The following year, he released Pantulan Cita (Reflection of Dreams), a collaboration with Jockie. After the album flopped, Chrisye took a long sabbatical.|$|E

5|$|The word mermaid is a {{compound}} of the Old English mere (sea), and maid (a girl or young woman). The equivalent term in Old English was merewif. They are conventionally depicted <b>as</b> <b>beautiful</b> with long flowing hair. As cited above, they are sometimes equated with the sirens of Greek mythology (especially the Odyssey), half-bird femmes fatales whose enchanting voices would lure soon-to-be-shipwrecked sailors to nearby rocks, sandbars or shoals.|$|E
5|$|Dawn of Mana was designed, directed, and {{produced}} by series creator Koichi Ishii. The script {{was written by}} Ryo Akagi, based on a story created by Masato Kato, and the music was composed by a group led by Kenji Ito. The game was a moderate commercial success: it sold 229,000 copies in its first ten days of release in Japan, and over 410,000 copies worldwide {{by the end of}} 2008. While critics praised the graphics and music <b>as</b> <b>beautiful</b> and lush, they found the leveling system annoying, the combat controls difficult and frustrating, and the story trite.|$|E
5|$|High {{reveals that}} two humans, Líf and Lífþrasir, will have also survived the {{destruction}} by {{hiding in the}} wood Hoddmímis holt. These two survivors consume the morning dew for sustenance, and from their descendants {{the world will be}} repopulated. Vafþrúðnismál stanza 45 is then quoted. The personified sun, Sól, will have a daughter at least <b>as</b> <b>beautiful</b> as she, and this daughter will follow the same path as her mother. Vafþrúðnismál stanza 47 is quoted, and so ends the foretelling of Ragnarök in Gylfaginning.|$|E

5|$|Prior to her infestation, Kerrigan is {{described}} as being a graceful and deadly woman, exceedingly agile and athletic, possessing jade-green eyes and brilliant red hair usually worn as a ponytail. The novel Queen of Blades describes her facial features as being too strong to be classified <b>as</b> <b>beautiful,</b> but instead as striking and completely fitting for her personality. Kerrigan is rarely seen out of her armor, a form-fitting hostile environment suit specifically designed for Ghost operatives and equipped with a personal cloaking device, but when off-duty, she {{is described}} as wearing a soft work shirt, worn cotton pants with a dusty leather jacket, and high leather boots. Even then, it is uncommon for Kerrigan to be unarmed: she is always equipped {{with at least a}} combat knife.|$|E
5|$|Public {{dissatisfaction with}} the newly-issued Morgan dollar led the Mint's {{engravers}} to submit designs for the smaller silver coins in 1879. Among those who called for new coinage was editor Richard Watson Gilder of The Century Illustrated Monthly Magazine. Sometime in the early 1880s, he, along {{with one of his}} reporters and sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens visited Mint Director Burchard to argue for the creation of new designs. They brought along classic Greek and Roman coins in an attempt to persuade Burchard that the coinage could easily be made more beautiful. The visitors left disappointed, after learning that Burchard considered the much-criticized Morgan dollar <b>as</b> <b>beautiful</b> as any of them.|$|E
5|$|The sea {{appears in}} human culture in {{contradictory}} ways, as both powerful but serene and <b>as</b> <b>beautiful</b> but dangerous. It has {{its place in}} mythology and religion, literature, art, poetry, film, theater, and music. The Ancients personified it, believing it {{to be under the}} control of a being who needed to be appeased. It has been populated by fantastic creatures: the Leviathan of the Bible, Scylla in Greek mythology, Isonade in Japanese mythology, and the kraken of late Norse mythology. The sea is especially common in Christian imagery, where several of Jesus's disciples were said to have been fishermen on the Sea of Galilee.|$|E

5|$|The textual {{description}} of Matrikas is generally awesome, frightening and ferocious. In the Mahabharata, all the seven mothers {{are described as}} fatal or serve as threats to foetuses or infants. They are described as living in trees, crossroads, caves and funeral grounds and they are terrible as well <b>as</b> <b>beautiful.</b> But, in the sculptural portrayal, they are depicted quite differently as protectors and benevolent mothers. They are armed with the same weapons, wear the same ornaments, and ride the same vahanas and carry the same banners as their corresponding male deities.|$|E
5|$|The two {{then follow}} a small {{path through the}} woods until they come to {{a house with a}} stake fence around it. The house is {{described}} <b>as</b> <b>beautiful,</b> featuring carvings filled with gold and silver. They enter the house with a few men, and find that it is lit from glass windows in the ceiling, so that the daylight illuminates the room and there are no shadows to be seen due to this. There were depictions of many gods there and a woman who is described as well dressed near the door.|$|E
5|$|Two years {{pass and}} couple have their first child. Their family {{physician}} offers {{to perform an}} operation to restore May's sight. Despite Frank's worries that his wife will not love him if she should see his scarred face, Frank consents to the operation. The operation is a success and the doctor warns May not to remove the bandages as she will lose her sight again. May's desire to see her child {{is so strong that}} she removes the bandages and gazes upon her child. Upon trying to gaze upon her husband, who is standing in strong light, May is permanently blinded. The film concludes with May being content with her blindness and knowing that her baby is <b>as</b> <b>beautiful.</b>|$|E

5|$|Beauty {{in nature}} has {{historically}} been a prevalent theme in art and books, filling large sections of libraries and bookstores. That nature has been depicted and celebrated by so much art, photography, poetry, and other literature shows the strength with which many people associate nature and beauty. Reasons why this association exists, and what the association consists of, are studied by the branch of philosophy called aesthetics. Beyond certain basic characteristics that many philosophers agree about to explain what is seen <b>as</b> <b>beautiful,</b> the opinions are virtually endless. Nature and wildness have been important subjects in various eras of world history. An early tradition of landscape art began in China during the Tang Dynasty (618–907). The tradition of representing nature as it is {{became one of the}} aims of Chinese painting and was a significant influence in Asian art.|$|E
5|$|Moffat {{initially}} doubted Gina Bellman's suitability for {{the role}} of Claire Jackman because he associated her too much with Jane Christie, the character she had played in his sitcom Coupling. Moffat did not imagine the character to be <b>as</b> <b>beautiful</b> as Bellman, but her audition was so good that he revised his vision of the character. Bellman originally auditioned {{for the role}} of Katherine, but the producers wanted someone younger to play that role. However, Bellman said that she talked herself out of the role by arguing that there should be an age gap between Katherine and Claire to avoid Katherine becoming a threat to the wife. Bellman approached her role as if Claire had become caught up in Tom's mid-life crisis, an angle that impressed the producers.|$|E
5|$|Mandodari is queen consort of Ravana, the Rakshasa(demon) king of Lanka. The Hindu epics {{describe}} her <b>as</b> <b>beautiful,</b> pious and righteous. Mandodari is daughter of Mayasura, the King of Asuras(demons) and apsara(celestial nymph) Hema. Some tales narrate how an apsara called Madhura was cursed {{to become a}} frog and imprisoned in a well for 12 years, after which regains her beauty or a frog, blessed to a beautiful maiden; in both cases, she is adopted by Mayasura as his daughter Mandodari. Ravana comes {{to the house of}} Mayasura and falls in love with Mandodari and then marries her. Mandodari bears him three sons: Meghanada(Indrajit), Atikaya and Akshayakumara. According to some Ramayana adaptations, Mandodari is also mother of Rama's wife Sita, who is infamously kidnapped by Ravana. Despite her husband's faults, Mandodari loves him and advises him to follow the path of righteousness. Mandodari repeatedly advises Ravana to return Sita to Rama, but her advice falls on deaf ears. Her love and loyalty to Ravana are praised in the Ramayana. Different versions of Ramayana record her ill-treatment at the hands of Rama's monkey generals. Some versions say they humiliate her, while disturbing a sacrifice by Ravana, while others narrate how they destroy her chastity, which protects Ravana's life. Hanuman tricks her into disclosing the location of a magical arrow which Rama uses to kill Ravana. After Ravana's death, Vibhishana—Ravana's younger brother who joins forces with Rama and is responsible for Ravana's death—marries Mandodari on the advice of Rama. In some versions, Mandodari curses Sita that Rama would abandon her.|$|E
