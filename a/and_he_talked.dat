2500|$|Tony Kubek {{initially}} {{had trouble}} {{adjusting to the}} world of broadcasting. Although he had a lot to say, he was gangling, he tended to stutter, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>talked</b> too fast. Gowdy soon suggested to Kubek that he should work in the off-season to improve his delivery. Kubek bought a tape recorder and took to reading poetry aloud for 20 minutes a day. In 1968, Kubek wowed as a World Series field reporter. Pee Wee Reese, who was soon fired by NBC (and replaced by Kubek as the top analyst) said of Kubek [...] "He wormed his way around, but I wasn't bitter. I just think if you don't have anything to say, you should shut your mouth." ...|$|E

5000|$|It then flashes forward, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>talks</b> about Gracie <b>and</b> her polio affliction. It {{was then}} that the narrator decided to write to Sonny. It seems that the narrator could better {{understand}} his brother now. ("My trouble made his real.") ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Frank has {{now gone}} to Courcy Castle; <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>talks</b> of going from thence to Cambridge.

"He'll have to {{live through}} several," [...] said Cornelia; [...] "You can excuse me when you go. <b>He's</b> very conceited, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>talks</b> to you {{as if he were}} a {{thousand}} years old.
