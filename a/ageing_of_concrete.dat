The main reason for increasing attention for ageing as a topic is the growing awareness that, particularly in industrialized countries, ageing of our assets is a financial burden for the society. It touches our environment and a country's economy. It affects the overall sustainability of our planet and deserves, therefore, our utmost attention. In this contribution the urgency and challenges of <b>ageing</b> <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> structures are addressed. Recent estimates {{of the extent of}} the issue and how ageing problems are dealt with in different disciplines, reactive or pro-active, are mentioned. The complexity of ageing problems will be evaluated by looking in more detail to the evolution in concrete mix design and the consequences thereof for the long-term performance of concrete structures. In this evaluation different kinds of driving forces contributing to ageing will be identified. Emphasis will be on <b>ageing</b> <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> infrastructure and the need of research on ageing phenomena will be addressed. </p...|$|E
40|$|Most of the {{low-level}} {{nuclear waste}} disposal facilities {{are based in}} engineered multi barrier systems where reinforced concrete {{is one of the}} basic materials. The calculation of the time until steel reinforcement depassivation is a need due to the demand of prediction of the service life of concrete structures in radioactive repositories. In doing that, one of the main steps is the transport of chloride ions towards the reinforcement, {{as one of the most}} aggressive agents for the rebars in concrete is chloride ions. <b>Ageing</b> <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> related to chloride penetration leads to significant decrease of the “apparent diffusion” coefficient with time. If this effect is not considered, considerable bias can be introduced when predicting service life of reinforced concrete of repositories. Several effects have been addressed on their influence on the <b>ageing</b> <b>of</b> <b>concrete,</b> including the evolution with time of the concrete pore refinement, the binding of chlorides to the cement phases and to the changes of chloride “surface concentration”. These effects have been studied in specimens made with different mixes trying to represent a wide range of mineral addition proportions. The analysis of their evolution with time has shown that the resistivity alone or the joint consideration of resistivity and binding capacity (Cb/Cf), are appropriate parameters to appraise the diffusivity ageing. For practical reasons, an accelerated procedure is proposed in order to calculate ageing for short periods of time. Peer reviewe...|$|E

The bacteria-based repair system {{presented in this paper}} aims at recovering the concrete permeability thanks to bacteria-induced calcium carbonate precipitation inside cracks/porosity. The performance of the bacteria-based repair system in laboratory and field application were very promising. The laboratory results showed that the crack sealing capacity of the repair system is very good as the cracks were completely sealed after impregnation. Results from field application are also very good as treated concrete had a significant higher resistance to freeze/thaw and only cracks that were not impregnated with the bacteria-based repair system were still heavily leaking.

40|$|AbstractThe {{deflection}} {{and cracking}} behavior <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> structure {{depend on the}} flexural tensile strength <b>of</b> <b>concrete.</b> Many factors {{have been shown to}} influence the flexural tensile strength <b>of</b> <b>concrete,</b> particularly the level <b>of</b> stress, size, <b>age</b> and confinement to concrete flexure member, etc. The concrete members, in general, are of large continuous size and have at least minimum reinforcement introducing a confining effect to the concrete.

Dynamic {{analysis}} of structuresThis paper presents a systematic approach {{to study the}} effects of long-term time-dependent behaviour due to <b>ageing</b> <b>of</b> <b>concrete,</b> concrete creep, concrete shrinkage and cable relaxation on the dynamic properties of concrete bridges. An equivalent stress relaxation model is introduced to obtain the equivalent creep coefficients of prestressing tendons. Based on this, the time integration method for prestressing tendons is developed. A bridge is modelled properly by finite element method using the master-slave technique to ensure compatibility between the concrete member and tendons. Time-dependent analysis is then conducted using time integration considering the interaction among various time-varying factors. Finally, {{on the basis of the}} updated finite element model, dynamic properties of the concrete structure are investigated by the subspace iteration method. The effects of long-term time-dependent behaviour on the dynamic properties of typical concrete bridges are then examined in detail. © 2011 Taylor & Francis Group, London. link_to_subscribed_fulltextThe 21 st Australian Conference on the Mechanics of Structures and Materials, Melbourne, Australia, 7 - 10 December 2010.

40|$|Deterioration of {{microstructure}} in {{cement concrete}} will cause {{changes in the}} transport properties of the concrete. Transport properties at different ages of the concrete provide information about the microstructural changes of the material. A way to measure the transport properties, i. e. the chloride diffusion coefficient, in the laboratory is rapid chloride migration (RCM) Test. With this test, the resistance of concrete to chloride ingress is evaluated. Changing losing resistance represents deterioration and <b>ageing</b> <b>of</b> <b>concrete.</b> In this study, RCM tests were carried out for Portland cement concrete cured in moist conditions at various curing ages up to 3 years. Scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis were performed to identify the reaction product, like delayed ettringite. The experimental {{results show that the}} resistance of Portland cement concrete to chloride ingress decreases when ettringite is formed in concrete. Based on the result it is concluded that delayed ettringite formation contributes to the deterioration of Portland cement concrete, and should thus be considered as a relevant factor in the ageing process of concrete structures at moist curing condition.

Tight, short construction deadlines force the contractors often to conduct works, regardless of weather conditions. The {{development of}} materials technology, implementation of new products, measurement techniques and methods of registration “data” information makes regardless of still useful, traditional tools for rising concrete structure, there must be sought and developed new methods for reduction of adverse events inside the concrete elements, but also allowing faster construction rising. <b>Ageing</b> <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> {{is a result of}} cement hydration, which is an exothermic process. Approximately a full hydration of 1 kg of standard Portland cement causes emission of approximately 400 kJ of heat. The ambient temperature and emition of hydration heat of fresh concrete mix and encountered difficulties in transmitting heat to the outside of the element initiates the formation of thermal gradient in the concrete structure. As time goes by, as a result of hydration process progress, the hardening concrete acquires mechanical characteristics (it increases its strength). If the resulting stress, caused by the temperature gradient, exceed at any given time the strength of the forming “concrete structure”, it is followed by its destruction, and result in emerging fractures and cracks in the constructed element [1]. From the above it can be concluded that the proper thermal care becomes one of the primary factors determining a solid monolithic concrete structure, hence the idea of application of PCM (Phase Change Materials) for the care of the inner concrete mix when ageing in hot and dry climates...|$|E
40|$|The {{doctoral}} thesis deals with {{analysis of the}} <b>ageing</b> <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> and reinforced concrete pipes in sewage systems. The ageing of the sewage system is caused by several reasons, for example material abrasion, chemical and biological corrosion and subsequent static overload sewer construction. One of the common causes of degradation of sewage systems made from materials bonded with cement sealant is biogenic sulphate corrosion. Due to the corrosion the degradation of the pipe walls accelerates, particularly in {{upper part of the}} pipe and reduces planned lifetime of the sewage system. There is proposed new ageing analysis monitoring method for observation and evaluation of the loss of thickness of concrete and reinforced concrete pipes, which is caused by biogenic sulphate corrosion. Residual lifetime is calculated from the expected corrosion rate, it`s the loss of wall thickness on the monitored section of the sewer system. There is designed the monitoring system of the loss of wall thickness on the sewage system for practical application of the measurement procedure, which is administrated in cooperation with the BVK, a. s. The thesis uses existing knowledge regarding this subject. We use this information for better understanding of the process of the loss of wall thickness in sewage systems in real time and the posibility to correct and in-time implementation of appropriate operational measures. This should cause the limitation of the degradation process of piping material while extended service life and safe operation in sewage systems within the required time period. Based on the methodology is proposed to determine the residual life of the sewage system and maintenance and rehabilitation can be done more effectively.

40|$|Deterioration and <b>ageing</b> <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> {{structures}} {{and the increased}} traffic intensities and loads {{are some of the}} major problems facing civil engineers, industry and researchers. Corrosion of embedded steel reinforcement {{is one of the main}} causes of deterioration. Deterioration of reinforced concrete may lead to a number of undesirable consequences such as loss of serviceability, loss of load carrying capacity and reduction in safety of {{structures and}} traffics. Steel bar corrosion affects the reinforcement itself, the surrounding concrete and the composite action between steel and concrete. The most critical effect is probably the reduction in cross sectional area of the affected bar. If corrosion is allowed to propagate over a sufficiently long period of time and proper interventions not are made, loss of bond may also lead to impaired stiffness and strength of affected structural components. The main objective of this PhD project is to develop methodology for assessment of deteriorating concrete structures based on nonlinear finite element simulations. For the numerical simulations to be accurate it is required that constitutive and kinematical models represent realistic approximations to the true behaviour of reinforced concrete structures attacked by reinforcement corrosion. Hence, these models must be based on existing experimental evidence of the structural consequences of reinforcement corrosion. However the available experimental data on steel bar corrosion have been obtained on small scale specimens corroded and tested in the laboratory and showed considerable scatter in the published results. The first part of the thesis deals with presentation of reliable information about change in the maximum bond strength between reinforcement and surrounding concrete and bond-slip behaviour due to corrosion. Available data from published laboratory investigations are collected and compared. Some analytical models for calculation of the residual bond strength and some bond-slip models for uncorroded and corroded bars used in the numerical simulations are presented and discussed in the thesis. An attempt to analyse the effect of the current density on the bond strength and on the residual load-carrying capacity of the concrete beams with corroded reinforcement is also performed. The second part of the PhD project is focused on validation and verification of the nonlinear finite element analysis of deteriorated and repaired concrete structures through a numerical test program. As a first step, simulations of laboratory experiments on small scale beams are performed to verify the finite element model proposed in this project. Accordingly, loss of steel bar section, and reduced bond between deteriorated concrete and corroded rebar are accounted for in the present work. The load-deflection behaviour obtained from the finite element simulations are generally in good agreement with the test data. As a second step in the numerical program, analyses of a full scale beam are carried out. A close approximation to the true sequence of loading, deterioration, unloading, repair and reloading until failure, a so-called service life cycle of concrete beams, are simulated using the phase analysis approach in the finite element software DIANA. The results of the phased  finite element simulation showed that the failure load of the repaired beam was larger than the experimental and estimated probabilistic values. The central deflection of the concrete beam from the finite element analysis was significantly lower than in the experimental study at both the corrosion and repair stages. Next, numerical simulations of the service life cycle of a concrete beam without strengthening, where time-dependent effects such as creep and shrinkage were included in the constitutive models for concrete and repair material, were carried out. The results of the simulations showed that the failure load is in good agreement with the failure load corresponding to the upper bound of the 95 % confidence interval obtained in a previous probabilistic study. Initial strains due to shrinkage of the concrete and the repair material were implemented in the numerical analyses according to a cross section type model, and a model for development of free shrinkage strain in beams exposed to one-side drying. Total strain variations across the cross-section of the beam calculated from the finite element analyses are compared to data available from the experimental study. Finally, effect of some parameters influencing the results of the numerical simulations and the agreement between the laboratory and numerical results are presented.

Fracture toughness <b>of</b> <b>concretes</b> was determined in terms of the critical stress intensity factors: K I c S, K I I c, K I I I c and then a generalized fracture toughness K c was specified. The obtained results are significant for the analysis <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> structures subjected to complex loading. The properties of composites with the additive of LCFA depend on the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> the <b>concrete</b> tested. Mature concretes exhibit high fracture toughness at 20 % additive of LCFA, while the additive of LCFA in the amount of 30 % weight of cement has a beneficial effect on the parameters <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> only after half a year of curing...|$|R

The pond ash {{is used as}} replacement of cement (25 to 45 %). The properties concrete in fresh and hardened state was tested and {{it is found that}} as a percentage of pond ash increases, the compressive strength <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> reduces. It is also observed that early <b>age</b> compressive strength <b>of</b> pond ash <b>concrete</b> is low but it is gradually rises as <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> increases and it gives good later age strength. For all proportions slump was maintained in range from 100 mm to 130 mm. The investigation shows a scope for use of pond ash in concrete...|$|R

The obtained results demonstrate that, within the investigated <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>concrete,</b> factors such as cement fineness, slag origin, w/c ratio and cement and effective water contents clearly influence concrete resistivity and DRCM values. Moreover, a linear trend is observed between DRCM and conductivity. Based on this trend, resistivity determination is proposed as an alternative method for more laborious and time consuming chloride ingress test methods...|$|R
40|$|Estimation <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> {{strength}} {{is an important}} issue in ready-mixed concrete industry, especially, in proportioning new mixtures and for the quality assurance <b>of</b> the <b>concrete</b> produced. In this article, {{on the basis of the}} existing experimental data of compressive strength of normal and recycled aggregate concrete and equation for compressive strength calculating given in Technical regulation are compared. The accuracies of prediction by experimental data obtained in laboratory as well as by EN 1992 - 1 - 1, ACI 209 and SRPS U. M 1. 048 are compared on the basis of the coefficient of determination. The determination of the compressive strengths by the equation described here relies on determination of type <b>of</b> cement and <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> with the constant curing temperature...|$|R
40|$|This paper reports an {{experimental}} method developed {{to measure the}} thermal conductivity <b>of</b> <b>concrete.</b> This method involves the measurement of steady state temperature distribution across a cylindrical specimen <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> under known heat flux supplied at {{the centre of the}} specimen by a heating coil. It was observed that the thermal conductivity <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> varies across the section of the specimen and also with the <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>concrete.</b> The variation <b>of</b> conductivity across the section {{may be due to the}} non-uniform distribution of free water and hydrated products. This idea was verified by conducting the test with a dry mixture of cement, sand and aggregate. It was observed that the thermal conductivity of the dry mix was very low and it did not vary across the section as the composition of the materials was uniform across the section...|$|R
