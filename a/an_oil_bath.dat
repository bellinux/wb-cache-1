25|$|A basic {{melting point}} {{apparatus}} {{for the analysis}} of crystalline solids consists of <b>an</b> <b>oil</b> <b>bath</b> with a transparent window (most basic design: a Thiele tube) and a simple magnifier. The several grains of a solid are placed in a thin glass tube and partially immersed in the oil bath. The oil bath is heated (and stirred) and with the aid of the magnifier (and external light source) melting of the individual crystals at a certain temperature can be observed. In large/small devices, the sample is placed in a heating block, and optical detection is automated.|$|E
25|$|Another {{less obvious}} error can also occur when heating the dies. After being {{taken out of}} the {{annealing}} furnace, the dies must cool for 24 to 36 hours. They are usually given <b>an</b> <b>oil</b> <b>bath</b> to cool them more quickly, but the dies must still cool for a period of several hours. When the dies are cooling, if they are not stored properly or not allowed to fully cool before being used, the result is a much softer die. When the die is subjected to the hubbing press again and work hardened again, it will be softer and more susceptible to wear. If the die is softer because it was not fully cooled, it will not harden to the same standard as a die which has received proper treatment. However, {{there will not be a}} noticeable difference between a good die and a bad die; the change in the structure of the die does is not apparent until it is used for a period of time.|$|E
2500|$|Although it was uncommon, {{the drive}} bands could {{fall out of}} adjustment, {{allowing}} the car to creep, particularly when cold, adding another hazard to attempting to start the car: a person cranking the engine could be forced backward while still holding the crank as the car crept forward, although it was nominally in neutral. As the car utilized a wet clutch, this condition could also occur in cold weather, when the thickened oil prevents the clutch discs from slipping freely. Power reached the differential through a single universal joint attached to a torque tube which drove the rear axle; some models (typically trucks, but available for cars, as well) could be equipped with an optional two-speed Ruckstell rear axle shifted by a floor-mounted lever which provided an underdrive gear for easier hill climbing.

The self-seeding technique was applied for growing single crystals. Solution crystallization was carried out with a dilute concentration of 0.008  wt% in amyl acetate as solvent, and melt crystallization was conducted without solvent and on appropriate silicon wafers. The sample was heated to above the dissolution temperature (T d =  42 °C) in solution system and melting temperature in bulk system (T m =  65 °C) in <b>a</b> temperature-controllable <b>oil</b> <b>bath</b> for 15  min.

The sample was then quickly switched into <b>a</b> desired isothermal <b>oil</b> <b>bath</b> adjusted at crystallization temperature, and maintained for 2  days. Self-seeding method was also used to grow the single-co-crystals. Solution single crystallization {{was carried out in}} amyl acetate (Merck, > 98 %). Desired amount of solutes (50 / 50 wt/wt of homo and copolymer) and amyl acetate were added into the cell tube to reach the dilute concentration of 0.018  wt%. Then the sealed cell tube was heated to above the dissolution temperature (T d =  65  °C) in <b>a</b> temperature-controllable <b>oil</b> <b>bath,</b> and kept for about 12  min.

2500|$|This festival, {{a public}} holiday {{in the island}} nation, is also called [...] "Deepavali" [...] and is celebrated by the Tamil community. On this day, it is {{traditional}} for people to take <b>an</b> <b>oil</b> <b>bath</b> in the morning, wear new clothes, exchange gifts, performing Poosai (Pūjā), and {{a visit to the}} Koil (Hindu temple) is normal. Burning of firecrackers in the evening of the festival is a common practice of this festival. Hindus light oil lamps to invite the blessings of Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth and to banish any evil from the household for once and for all. The festival is marked by illumination, making of toys of enamel and making of figures out of crystal sugar popularly known as Misiri. Sri Lanka's celebration include many of the traditional aspects of Deepavali such as games, fireworks, singing and dancing; however, the tradition of a large meal, family reunions and fireworks are admirably preserved.|$|E
2500|$|The 1949 {{model was}} {{equipped}} with an ignition key and a starter push-button to engage the starter. Pushing the starter button would engage the starter, but if the ignition key was not inserted, unlocking the ignition, the car would not start. The car {{was equipped with}} <b>an</b> <b>oil</b> <b>bath</b> air cleaner. At the bottom edge of the front fender directly behind the front wheel was a badge that said [...] "Futuramic" [...] which identified an Oldsmobile approach to simplified driving, {{and the presence of}} an automatic transmission. [...] Styling changes for the 1950 model include the replacement of a two-piece windshield with a one-piece unit and the addition of the Holiday hardtop coupe to the line. Also a three-speed manual transmission with column shift became available as a [...] "delete for credit" [...] option to the Hydra-Matic automatic transmission. The 88 now outsold the six-cylinder 76 lineup, which was dropped entirely after the 1950 model year. It had a 40ft. turning circle. [...] The 1950 model won the 1950 Carrera Panamericana.|$|E
2500|$|The tractor used a , inline four-cylinder engine. The {{engine was}} similar to the Ford Model T engine in many respects. Like many engines of its day, it was multifuel-capable; it was usually tuned for {{gasoline}} or kerosene, but alcohol could also be burned. (Tractor vaporising oil [...] existed in 1920 but was not yet widely used. It entered broader use in the 1930s and 1940s.) Like many other multifuel machines, the Fordson started on gasoline from a small auxiliary tank (just a few quarts) and then switched over to the main fuel tank once warmed up sufficiently (no more than 5 minutes). To handle the kerosene (or, rarely, TVO), the intake system had a vaporizer downstream of the carburetor. The mixture coming from the carburetor was intentionally rich, and the vaporizer heated it and mixed it with more air to lean it out to the final ratio before entering the intake manifold. The intake system also had a water-bath air cleaner to filter the dust out of the air inhaled by the engine (an invention that did not originate at Ford but that was still rather novel in 1917). Air cleaning is critical to engine lifespan, even for road vehicles and most especially for farming and construction vehicles (which work in environments where dirt is frequently stirred up into the air). The Fordson carburetor and air cleaner were designed by Holley. In later decades, the water bath would be replaced with <b>an</b> <b>oil</b> <b>bath</b> for better filtering performance.|$|E

Some chemicals, improper use of cosmetics, poor hygiene, old age and some diseases causes disorder in the mentioned structures and leads to TEWL increase. The {{aim of this study}} was to obtain the optimal formulation composition of <b>an</b> <b>oiling</b> <b>bath</b> cosmetic based on rapeseed phospholipids and vegetable oil with high content of polyunsaturated fatty acids. In this work, the composition of <b>oiling</b> <b>bath</b> form was calculated and the degree of oil dispersion after mixing the bath preparation with water was selected as the objective function in the optimizing procedure.
