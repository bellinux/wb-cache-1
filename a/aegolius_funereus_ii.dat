We present an example using two indicator bird species, Tengmalm owl (<b>Aegolius</b> <b>funereus)</b> and Pygmy owl (Glaucidium passerinum). Maximum entropy (Maxent), a presence-only modelling approach, is used to model the distribution of these two species within a large study area in the French Alps. Despite biased sampling design, this method performs very well in predicting spatial distribution of the two owl species and brings useful information to help decision-making concerning the protection of valuable habitats...|$|R

These results {{suggest that there is}} competition for food between these two owl species and/or that food caching behaviour of pygmy owls is disturbed by larger Tengmalm’s owls. Interactions among species, such as competition and predation, are fundamental biotic factors determining population densities of animals (Sih et al. 1985, Gurevitch et al. 2000).

40|$|Northern voles and lemmings {{are famous}} for their {{spectacular}} multiannual population cycles with high amplitudes. Such cyclic vole populations in Scandinavia have shown an unexpected and marked long-term decline in density since the early 1970 s, particularly with a marked shift to lower spring densities in the early 1980 s. The vole decline, mainly characterized by a strongly decreased rate of change in numbers over winter, is {{associated with an increased}} occurrence of mild and wet winters brought about by a recent change in the North Atlantic Oscillation. This has led to a decrease in winter stability and has shortened the period with protective snow cover, the latter considered as an important prerequisite for the occurrence of multiannual, high-amplitude cycles in vole populations. Although the vole decline is predicted to be negative for predators' reproduction and abundance, empirical data showing this are rare. Here we show that the dynamics of a predator–prey system (Tengmalm's owl, <b>Aegolius</b> <b>funereus,</b> and voles), have in recent years gradually changed from 3 – 4 yr, high-amplitude cycles towards more or less annual fluctuations only...|$|R
40|$|Boreal owls <b>Aegolius</b> <b>funereus</b> (referred to as Tengmalm’s owls in Europe) {{breed in}} boreal forests {{throughout}} the Holarctic region and in high-elevation subalpine forests further south. They are currently classified as seven subspecies; six found throughout Eurasia, {{and one in}} North America. The geographic distribution of boreal owls in North America and Eurasia is similar, as are their patterns of dispersal and irruption. Because a recent genetic study of boreal owls in North America found very little genetic differentiation among widely disparate locations, we expected that boreal owls in Eurasia similarly would have very little genetic differentiation. Using seven microsatellite markers, we analyzed genetic samples from 275 boreal owls in North America, 36 in Norway, and five in eastern Russia. We found no detectable genetic differentiation between Norwegian and Russian owls, but notable differentiation between North American and Eurasian owls. Low intra-continental genetic differentiation likely results from high rates of long-distance dispersal among subpopulations of boreal owls. In light of these results, we recommend further genetic sampling of boreal owls throughout Eurasia {{in order to determine}} whether six separate subspecies here are warranted...|$|R
40|$|Several boreal taxa can {{be found}} in {{southern}} latitudes in fragments of high altitude alpine habitat. Some of these taxa have remained isolated from the main populations in northern latitudes {{as a result of the}} distribution changes during the last glaciations, being known as glacial relict populations. Such relict populations have often differentiated from the main population as a result of isolation and genetic drift. The Tengmalm's owl <b>Aegolius</b> <b>funereus</b> is a widespread boreal forest species distributed throughout boreal Eurasia and North America. The westernmost Eurasian breeding population is located in the Pyrenees Mountains, and was discovered less than 50 years ago. We studied the genetic structure of this Pyrenean population of Tengmalm's owl, and compared it with a northern latitude population from Fennoscandia.

In the eastern Canadian boreal forest, Boreal Owls are considered resident (with irruptive movements to the south thought to occur during periods of low prey availability), and Northern Saw-whet Owls migratory. Data on late summer abundance of small rodents collected between 1995 and 2004 were used to develop an index of prey availability. Data on the number and age of irrupting/migrating owls were collected between 1996 - 2004 (mid-September to late October) using audiolures and mist nets. Our study revealed strong evidence of (1) a negative relationship between the abundance of small rodents and movement of Boreal Owls and (2) {{a positive relationship between}} the abundance of small rodents and the number of migrating juveniles and second year Northern Saw-whet Owls. In the latter case, it suggests that prey availability can strongly influence breeding success of this species, which is at the northern limit of its breeding range...|$|R
40|$|Loss and {{alteration}} of habitats by human actions {{are the largest}} worldwide hazard to biodiversity and viability of populations. In boreal forests of Eurasia and North America the natural habitat is changing, mainly because of forestry practices and agriculture. Although {{there is evidence that}} the diversity and abundance of animal species are lower in intensively managed than in natural forests, very little is known about how the changes in habitat composition affect reproduction and survival. The best available measure of individual performance in the wild is lifetime reproductive success (LRS), the number of offspring produced during a lifetime, because it combines both survival and reproductive success to a single measure. We show that the LRS of forest-dwelling Tengmalm's owls (<b>Aegolius</b> <b>funereus)</b> increases with the proportion of old forest in the territory because of a higher number of breeding attempts, whereas it decreases with the proportion of agricultural land because of declining fledging success in years when prey populations crashed during owl breeding.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the relationship between}} mast seeding in beech Fagus sylvaticus and oak Quercus spp., and the occurrence of the rodent-dependent predators Tengmalm's Owl <b>Aegolius</b> <b>funereus,</b> Long-eared Owl Asio otus and Tawny Owl Strix alaco in south-eastern Sweden (Blekinge) 1992 - 2000. We also compared available data on seed production with data on winter flocks of Brambling Fringilla montifringilla, mainly depending on beech seeds as winter food. Years of good beech mast production were followed by years of high frequency of Tengmalm's Owl and Long-eared Owl, indicating a rapid numerical response to improved food conditions. The Tawny Owl did not respond in the same way, but tended to reach high densities two years after mast seeding. These results suggest that mast seed production may influence the populations of rodent- feeding predators, and that the numerical response may be very rapid in potentially nomadic specialist predators. This was indicated particularly for the Tengmalm's Owls arriving in Blekinge rather late in spring of 1999. Winters following good beech mast production normally held large numbers of Bramblings. However Bramblings were absent in Blekinge {{during the winter of}} 1992 / 93 despite the very good year for beechnut production in 1992.

A number of theoretical papers have suggested a link between uniparental offspring desertion and ecological factors, but empirical evidence is scarce. We investigated the relationship between uniparental desertion and food abundance in a natural population of Tengmalm's owl <b>Aegolius</b> <b>funereus,</b> both by means of a 5 -year observational study and a 1 -year experimental study. Parents and offspring were fitted with radio-transmitters in order to reveal the parental care strategy (i. e. care or desert) of individual parents, and {{to keep track of the}} broods post-fledging. We found that 70 per cent of the females from non-experimental nests deserted, while their partner continued to care for their joint offspring alone. Desertion rate was positively related to natural prey population densities and body reserves of the male partner. In response to food supplementation, a larger proportion of the females deserted, and females deserted the offspring at an earlier age. Offspring survival during the post-fledging period tended to be lower in deserted than in non-deserted broods. We argue that the most important benefit of deserting may be remating (sequential polyandry) ...|$|R
40|$|The "dilution effect" {{implies that}} where species vary in {{susceptibility}} to infection by a pathogen, higher diversity {{often leads to}} lower infection prevalence in hosts. For directly transmitted pathogens, non-host species may "dilute" infection directly (1) and indirectly (2). Competitors and predators may (1) alter host behavior to reduce pathogen transmission or (2) reduce host density. In a well-studied system, we tested the dilution of the zoonotic Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) in bank voles (Myodes glareolus) by two competitors and a predator. Our study was based on long-term PUUV infection data (2003 - 2013) in northern Sweden. The field vole (Microtus agrestis) and the common shrew (Sorex araneus) are bank vole competitors and Tengmalm's owl (<b>Aegolius</b> <b>funereus)</b> is a main predator of bank voles. Infection probability in bank voles decreased when common shrew density increased, suggesting that common shrews reduced PUUV transmission. Field voles suppressed bank vole density in meadows and clear-cuts and indirectly diluted PUUV infection. Further, Tengmalm's owl decline in 1980 - 2013 {{may have contributed to}} higher PUUV infection rates in bank voles in 2003 - 2013 compared to 1979 - 1986. Our study provides further evidence for dilution effect and suggests that owls may have an important role in reducing disease risk...|$|R
30|$|In forest fires, {{standing}} dead {{pines and}} kelo trees easily catch fire and burn partly {{and therefore they}} may comprise {{a significant amount of}} charred wood, to which some lichen species are specialized (Lõhmus and Kruustuk 2010; Fig. 8). In our study area 41 % of the kelos had been charred reflecting past fires in the landscape (Lehtonen and Kolström 2000). Substrate type diversity is also increased by disturbances such as broken tree tops, which were recorded for 52 % of the kelos. Also woodpeckers, for example the big Black Woodpecker (Dryocopus martius), are known to make their nesting cavities in kelo trees (Fayt 2003), thus providing habitat for a number of other cavity nesting birds and animals, including Tengmalm’s Owl (<b>Aegolius</b> <b>funereus),</b> Goldeneye (Bucephala clangula), Swift (Apus apus), bats and the Siberian Flying Squirrel (Pteromys volans). Thus, kelo trees can also potentially be an important structural component contributing to the “cavity web” in these forests (cf. Martin and Eadie 1999; Martin et al. 2004; Cooke and Hannon 2011). However, in our data only 12 (3.8 %) kelos were reported to have a cavity. It may be that kelo wood is so hard that only trees with decayed heartwood are attractive for woodpecker nesting. Large hollow and broken kelos can also be used for nesting by large owls such as the Great Grey Owl (Strix nebulosa) (Fig. 8).|$|R
50|$|A {{non-profit}} organization {{in association with}} the park operates the Eagle River Nature Center which exhibits interpretive information on wildlife and geological features. The basin of the Eagle River can be accessed by the nearby Albert Loop Trail which passes through three miles (five kilometers) of mixed forests and leads to a river fed by glaciers hidden in the surrounding mountains. At those times in the fall when the park's ursine residents are using the area for their fishing purposes, the trail is closed so as to lessen bear-human interactions. In addition, the Rodak Nature Trail leads to a beaver viewing deck and salmon viewing deck. From the trail red salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) and silver salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) can be seen as they spawn, especially in August. Brown bears (Ursus arctos) often feed on salmon in shallow water between the beaver dams. Hundreds of black bears (Ursus americanus) likewise live in the park. Area streams are excellent for birding as well. The American dipper (Cinclus mexicanus) can be seen during the winter months, which birders will also find a successful time to listen for the great horned owl (Bubo virginianus) and boreal owl (<b>Aegolius</b> <b>funereus).</b> Visitors can rent yurts and cabins along the Eagle River in order to spend time out exploring the scenery and wildlife in the area.

40|$|The {{loss and}} {{fragmentation}} of forest habitats {{have been considered}} to pose a worldwide threat to the viability of forest-dwelling animals, especially to species that occupy old forests. We investigated whether the annual survival of sedentary male Tengmalm’s owls <b>Aegolius</b> <b>funereus</b> {{was associated with the}} cover of old coniferous forests in Finland. Survival and recapture probabilities varied annually with density changes in populations of the main prey (Microtus voles). When this variation was controlled for, and relationships between survival and proportions of the three different forest age classes (old-growth, middle-aged, and young) were modeled separately, the old-growth model was the most parsimonious. Survival increased with the cover of old forest, although the extent of old forest within owl territories was relatively small (mean ∼ 12 %, range 2 – 37 %). This association, however, varied among years and appeared especially in years of increasing vole abundance. At such times, old forests may sustain high populations of bank voles Clethrionomys glareolus, shrews and small passerines. In addition, old forests may serve as refuges against large avian predator species, such as Ural owls Strix uralensis and goshawks Accipiter gentilis. Our results suggest that changes in habitat quality created by agriculture and forestry may have the potential to reduce adult survival, an essential component of fitness and population viability. ...|$|R
40|$|A key tool used {{to assess}} {{reproductive}} trade-offs in birds is brood size manipulation (BSM) experiments. Most BSM {{studies have examined the}} influence on short-term measures of reproductive output. Seldom evaluated are the effects on long-term fitness proxies under temporally or spatially varying environments. Unpredictable environments may affect reproductive trade-offs by altering the value of the brood or hampering optimization of reproductive effort. We reduced or enlarged broods of 140 male Tengmalm’s owls <b>Aegolius</b> <b>funereus</b> by one chick during their first lifetime reproductive event. Males differed in age and bred in environments that varied in quality spatially (habitat structure) and temporally (abundance of main food). We measured the short-term (nestling number and condition) and long-term fitness proxies (survival, lifetime fledgling and recruits produced) until all experimental males disappeared from the population. BSMs did not affect fledgling number or condition, but in enlarged broods, offspring condition was lower in territories with a high proportion of agricultural fields. Importantly, no obvious impacts on long-term fitness proxies emerged; lifetime fledgling and recruit production of males did not differ between the BSM treatments. Thus, the primary caregiver (i. e. Tengmalm’s owl males) passed increased reproductive costs to their offspring, which is in agreement with other studies investigating intergenerational reproductive trade-offs in species of intermediate lifespan. Reluctance to accept increased current reproductive costs in these systems highlights the potential for sexual conflict in bi-parental care systems in which one of the pair is the primary caregiver...|$|R
40|$|In altricial birds, the {{nestling}} {{period is}} an important part of the breeding phase because the juveniles may spend quite a long time in the nest, with associated high energy costs for the parents. The length of the nestling period can be variable and its duration may be influenced by both biotic and abiotic factors; however, studies of this have mostly been undertaken on passerine birds. We studied individual duration of nestling period of 98 Tengmalm’s owl chicks (<b>Aegolius</b> <b>funereus)</b> at 27 nests during five breeding seasons using a camera and chip system and radio-telemetry. We found the nestlings stayed in the nest box for 27 – 38 days from hatching (mean ± SD, 32. 4 ± 2. 2 days). The individual duration of nestling period was negatively related to wing length, but no formally significant effect was found for body weight, sex, prey availability and/or weather conditions. The fledging sequence of individual nestlings was primarily related to hatching order; no relationship with wing length and/or other factors was found in this case. We suggest the length of wing is the most important measure of body condition and individual quality in Tengmalm’s owl young determining the duration of the nestling period. Other differences from passerines (e. g., the lack of effect of weather or prey availability on nestling period) are considered likely to be due to different life-history traits, in particular different food habits and nesting sites and greater risk of nest predation among passerines...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAnimals possess various antipredator {{behaviours}} {{to reduce}} their risk of predation. Whereas most prey make considerable effort to avoid their predators, sometimes individuals approach and mob predators as a group. Among the types of predators that elicit mobbing, raptors such as hawks and owls {{are one of the}} more consistent targets. We conducted playback experiments to investigate the strength of mobbing behaviour according to the perceived risk associated with either predator dangerousness or local pre- dation pressure. We ␣rst determined whether mobbing is speci␣c to dangerous predators or more broadly directed at predatory species. We experimentally investigated whether prey can discriminate the level of dangerousness of two owl species. Our results indicate that prey adjusted the strength of their mobbing behaviour according to the perceived risk: passerine birds mobbed the Eurasian pygmy owl, Glaucidium passerinum (i. e. a dangerous predator) but not the boreal owl, <b>Aegolius</b> <b>funereus</b> (i. e. a far less dangerous species). Second, we compared mobbing behaviour in similar habitats differing in predation pressure (with or without pygmy owls). Working on identical bird communities, we revealed that mobbing varied in relation to the local presence of the predator. Where the pygmy owl was absent, calls of this dangerous predator failed to elicit mobbing among passerine birds although they responded strongly to a playback of a mobbing chorus. This study provides experimental evidence that intense predation increases the expression of cooperative mobbing in passerine birds...|$|R
30|$|Forest {{management}} in Central Europe has shifted towards permanent canopy cover and selective harvests {{over the last}} three decades (Pukkala and von Gadow 2012). Although selective cutting can have negative effects on biodiversity (Paillet et al. 2010), it may be compensated for by an increase in the area of mixed-species forests (see Fig.  1) and increased stand volumes. The positive trends in forest bird populations over time are in contrast to previous observations, but these studies did not separate migratory and non-migratory species or account for land-use type (Leech and Crick 2007; Wade et al. 2013). Indeed, some forest specialist bird species, such as Tetrao urogallus (Capercaillie) and Tetrastes bonasia (Hazel Grouse), which are uncommon species and are not listed in the European Bird Observations, have experienced declines due to anthropogenic causes despite repeated efforts to restore populations through captive breeding and releasing. Trends for owls also appear to be variable. Small forest owls, such as <b>Aegolius</b> <b>funereus</b> and Glaucinium passerinum, have increased in populations with increased abundance of rodents, while some owls have profited from conservation efforts, such as Bubo bubo (Görner 2016). Grouses and owls are cryptic birds that are difficult to monitor because of their low detection probability (Wintle et al. 2005; Kéry and Schmid 2006; Zimmerman and Gutiérrez 2007; Hansen et al. 2011), and therefore they were not included in this study. All birds in our analysis are woodpeckers or passerines, which are smaller-bodied and have different evolutionary histories and ecologies, including higher detection probability.|$|R
40|$|Begging {{behaviour}} of nestlings {{has been}} intensively studied {{for several decades}} as {{a key component of}} parent-offspring conflict. There are essentially two main theories to account for intensity of food solicitation among offspring: that intensity of begging is related to some form of scramble competition between nest mates or that it offers honest signalling of need to parents. The vast majority of studies which have addressed begging behaviour have been based on observations of, and experiments on, nestlings and have not considered begging behaviour, during the post-fledging period. Begging vocalizations in this post-fledging phase of dependence have rarely been studied, despite the importance of vocalizations as a communication method between offspring and parents, particularly for nocturnal species. We radiotracked 39 fledglings of the Tengmalm’s owl (<b>Aegolius</b> <b>funereus)</b> in two years with different availability of prey: 2010 (n = 29 fledglings) and 2011 (n = 10 fledglings) and made 1320 nightly localizations in which we recorded presence or absence of begging calls. Within years, the most important measures related to the probability of vocalization were body condition at fledging, time of night, number of surviving siblings, age and weather conditions. Begging intensity increased with age in both years; however, in the year with low prey availability fledglings vocalized significantly more often. The main factor causing these differences between years was probably the different availability of prey, affecting breeding success, post-fledging behaviour, and thus also both short- and long-term needs of offspring. We believe that our results suggest honest signallin...|$|R

The PFDP can extend over quite a protracted period, particularly in birds of prey, and a knowledge of the movement patterns of individuals is fundamental for understanding mechanisms underlying survival, habitat use and dispersion. We radiotracked 39 fledglings of the Tengmalm’s owl (<b>Aegolius</b> <b>funereus)</b> in two years with different availability of prey: 2010 (n = 29) and 2011 (n = 10) and obtained 1455 daily locations. Fledglings reached independence on average in 45 days after fledging in 2010 (n = 22) and 57 days in 2011 (n = 6). Within years, the most important measures influencing the distance moved from the nest box were age of fledglings and number of surviving siblings present. Individual home range size and duration of PFDP in particular were dependent on maximal number of siblings seen outside the nest box. In the season with low prey availability fledglings were observed at greater distances from the nest box than in the year with higher prey availability (mean distance: 350 m in 2010 and 650 m in 2011) and occupied larger home ranges (mean: 30. 3 ha in 2010 and 57. 7 ha in 2011).

A fence of metal sheet and continuous trapping kept out small mustelids during the breeding season. The only avian predators observed in the area throughout the year were the Ural owl (Strix uralensis) and the tawny owl (Strix aluco) and during summer the common buzzard (Buteo buteo). During autumn and winter pygmy owls (Glaucidium passerinum) was present in the study area. No Tengmalm's owls (<b>Aegolius</b> <b>funereus)</b> were observed around the area.

We suggest that avian predators have only a slight influence on breeding bank vole populations during a peak year in a patchy environment with boreal spruce forest. An explanation could be that bank voles are only an alternative prey for avian predators when field voles (Microtus agrestis) have high densities in more open habitats at the same time.

Data on dietary composition and distribution patterns of pine martens were gathered under differing conditions of food supply and {{across a range of}} landscape types and seasons. Also, similar data were gathered from the following predator species: the weasel Mustela nivalis, the polecat Mustela putorius, the red fox Vulpes vulpes, the raccoon dog Nyctereutes procyonoides, the Ural owl Strix uralensis, the tawny owl Strix aluco, the Tengmalm’s owl <b>Aegolius</b> <b>funereus,</b> and the pygmy owl Glaucidium passerinum; these data were used in the calculation of {{ecological niche}} overlaps between the pine marten and these predatory species. Variations in the abundance of the main prey were monitored. The data showed that the pine marten acted both as an active predator, mostly taking many species of rodents and birds, and as a gatherer, feeding on fruits and scavenging for carrion. The winter density of bank voles drove pine marten numbers. Also, the biomass of carrion was a crucial factor determining predator density in late winter. The analysis undertaken of the two predatory guilds (generalist predators and rodent eaters) suggested that the species, being nearly equally adapted to survive in the available habitats, coexisted stably and competitively limited the population densities of each other. We revealed significant partioning in the habitats and/or food resources that promoted the species’ coexistence. However, the naturalised raccoon dog has negatively affected the pine marten population, and the particular cause seems to be competition for carrion in late winter...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report was to {{investigate}} to which extent local presence of large herbivore mammals (Alces alces, Cervus elaphus, Capreolus capreolus, Dama dama and Sus scrofa) covaries with small rodents (Myodes glaerolus, Apodemus flavicollis and Apodemus sylvaticus? The hypothesis was that high abundance of wild ungulates would inhibit the density of small forest rodents. The data was collected during field work within FoMA (Environmental Monitoring Assessment) /SLU (Swedish University of Agricultural Science). The Ungulate dropping inventory and rodent trappings, which is the base in this report, where performed 2012 – 2014 in Gnesta/Nyköping municipalities (G/N) with a relatively high density of wild ungulates and Vetlanda/Växjö municipalities (V/V) with relatively lower wild ungulate density. The results indicates that in the G/N area, forest rodent populations where less abundant than in the V/V area. It also shows that within some local areas (1 * 1 km) in G/N, with high wild ungulate dropping rate, the rodent catch frequency is lower than in areas with low wild ungulate dropping rate. Therefore, high wild ungulate populations may according to this study, affect local rodent populations. Due to this, wild ungulates also may affect the ecosystem on several other trophic levels. Inhibited rodent populations could on the second hand affect the specialist predators such as Tengmalm´s Owl (<b>Aegolius</b> <b>funereus),</b> pygmy owl (Glaucidium passerinum) and long-Eared Owl (Asio otus). High densities of wild ungulates may also affect plant recruitment of oak (Quercus robur and Quercus petraea) through high predation on seedlings and acorns. Rodents change the spatial pattern of their acorn caches and hence oak recruitment is negatively affected. However, more scientific effort is needed to get a clearer picture on this topic...|$|R
50|$|The {{feathers}} {{of the ear}} tufts in Spanish birds (when not damaged) were found to measure from 63.3 to 86.6 mm. The ear openings (covered in feathers as in all birds) are relatively uncomplicated but are also large, being larger on the right than on the left as in most owls, and proportionately larger {{than those of the}} great horned owl. In the female, the ear opening averages 31.7 mm on the right and 27.4 mm on the left and, in males, averages 26.8 mm on the right and 24.4 mm on the left. The depth of the facial disc and the size and complexity of the ear opening are directly correlated to the importance of sound in an owl’s hunting behaviour. Examples of owls with more complicated ear structures and deeper facial disc are barn owls, long-eared owls (Asio otus) and boreal owls (<b>Aegolius</b> <b>funereus).</b> Given the uncomplicated structure of their ear openings and relatively shallow, undefined facial disc, hunting by ear is secondary to hunting by sight in the eagle-owl, this seems to be true for Bubo in general. It is likely that more sound-based hunters such as the aforementioned species focus their hunting activity in more complete darkness. Also owls with white throat patches such as the Eurasian eagle-owl {{are more likely to be}} active in low light conditions in the hours before and after sunrise and sunset rather than the darkest times in the middle of the night. The boreal and barn owls, to extend these examples, lack obvious visual cues such as white throat patches (puffed up in displaying eagle-owls), again indicative of primary activity being in darker periods.|$|R
40|$|A habitat {{suitability}} index (HSI) model {{based on}} scientific literature and expert opinion {{was developed for}} the Boreal Owl (<b>Aegolius</b> <b>funereus)</b> in western Newfoundland, Canada. Preliminary analyses conducted on the model suggested outputs were most sensitive to variation in home range size, foraging radius, and density of living and dead stems in nesting areas. Over a 2 -yr period data were collected on 307 winter point count locations and nine Boreal Owl home ranges using radio telemetry to examine habitat use and test the HSI model. Owls were detected at 24 % of point count locations during two breeding seasons. Home range sizes during breeding varied with a median range of 429 ha. Log-ratio compositional analyses of roost locations and home ranges indicated that Boreal Owls do not occupy these sites at random. For roost locations, owls selected old and young softwood stands and avoided bogs, disturbed stands and scrub. Owl home ranges favored old softwood and disturbed stands and avoided old mixedwood and hardwood stands. HSI values produced by the original model {{did not differ significantly}} from those updated with local data on home range size. While owls were not occupying sites at random based on HSI values, the model was not able to predict boreal owl presence at levels better than chance alone. The HSI model failed to produce values greater than 0. 60 (out of 1. 00) suggesting that input values from the literature for other parts of the Boreal Owl range may not be reflective of habitat suitability for Boreal Owls in Newfoundland. Further research is needed to address knowledge gaps about parameters identified as sensitive (nesting habitat and nest tree availability). The island of Newfoundland may also contain far less suitable habitat than other comparable areas of North America, or Boreal Owls in Newfoundland may be less habitat-specific than previously thought...|$|R
50|$|A {{multitude}} of wild animals {{live in the}} beech forests of the Harz Mountains. Over 5,000 species, most of them insects, have their home in these woods. They include many species that help to decompose leaves and work them into the soil and ground cover, including springtails, oribatid mites, woodlice, roundworms, millipedes, earthworms and snails. Characteristic breeding birds in the beech woods, with their abundance of dead wood, are the black woodpecker (Dryocopus martius) and stock dove (Columba oenas). An indication of the natural state of the beech woods in the Harz is {{the return of the}} black stork (Ciconia nigra). This shy and susceptible resident of richly diverse deciduous and mixed forest has become very rare in central Europe due to increasing disturbance of its habitat (caused by a lack of old trees and natural brooks). Through improvements to its habitat, including the renaturalisation of waterways and the creation of relatively undisturbed peaceful areas, the black stork population has now recovered. A typical mammal of such deciduous woods is the wild cat (Felis felis), that has established a stable population in the Harz. It prefers the diverse wooded areas, which offer a rich variety of food.The animal kingdom of the mixed beech and spruce woods is also diverse. Species that thrive in mixed forest are especially at home. For example, the mixed mountain forest is the natural habitat of the capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus). The Tengmalm's owl (<b>Aegolius</b> <b>funereus)</b> may also be found here. It breeds almost exclusively in black woodpecker holes in old beeches, and needs, unlike the spruce woods, more open beech forest with its higher population of small mammals in its search for food. For cover, however, it prefers the darker, denser spruce trees.|$|R
30|$|Boreal Owls <b>Aegolius</b> <b>funereus</b> show highly {{differentiated}} {{sex roles}} and a marked RSD during the breeding period; the female is approximately 30 % to 40 % heavier (mean male vs. female body mass, 102 vs. 170 g) and has on average 5 % longer wings than the male (Korpimäki 1981; Korpimäki and Hakkarainen 2012). While the female incubates eggs and broods young for 3 to 4 weeks after hatching (i.e., the brooding period, Korpimäki 1981; Zárybnická 2009 a), the male provides {{nearly all of}} the food for the female and young (Korpimäki 1981; Eldegard and Sonerud 2009; Zárybnická 2009 a). During this time, the female typically leaves the nest for a few minutes each night in order to defecate, regurgitate the remains of food, or for preening, and usually returns to the nest without prey (Korpimäki 1981; Zárybnická 2009 a). The male, however, almost always arrives at the nest with prey (Korpimäki 1981; Zárybnická 2009 a, b; Zárybnická et al. 2009). After the brooding period, females may either help males in providing food for the young or desert them (Eldegard and Sonerud 2009; Zárybnická 2009 a; Korpimäki et al. 2011). When a female deserts, its mate compensates for the absent female's contribution and continues to care for the nestlings (Korpimäki 1981; Zárybnická 2009 a; Eldegard and Sonerud 2012) and fledglings until they become independent (6 to 7 weeks after fledging, Eldegard and Sonerud 2012). Males can be polygynous and simultaneously pair with two or even three females (Carlsson et al. 1987; Carlsson and Hörnfeldt 1989; Korpimäki 1991). Although clutch sizes of primary and secondary/tertiary females do not differ, the latter females produce significantly fewer and lighter fledglings than the primary or monogamous females or their nesting attempt may even fail due to the low food provision rate by males (Korpimäki 1991; Zárybnická, unpublished data). There is no detailed information on whether poor food provision by males affects the parental effort of females during the brooding period or if females can substitute the duties of their partner.|$|R
40|$|Owls My {{exercise}} was {{a comparison of}} eleven owl species according to their body size differences between the male and the female. The body size data were reverse sexual dimorphism (male/female) in wing and the cube root of weight in Europen owl species. The goal {{of this study is}} to identify phylogenetic relatonships among owl species in the context of female biased body size using reverse sexual dimorphism (RSD). In the source article body size samples were selected with the following guidelines: that an adequate sample be obtained, where possible, weights from the breeding season were avoided because of the great changes that occur in the weights of females at this time, and where possible, weights and wing measurements were from the same locality or region because RSD in wing and weight appear to vary geographically. These samples were extracted from Cramp (1985). This article provides further information on female dominance in intra-pair interactions. The species listed in descending order of estimated relative female dominance: (1) Eurasian Pygmy-Ow (Glaucidium passerinum) : If the male is next to the nest without food when the young are hungry, the female will drive him away. In small cages, females will kill males. (2) Boreal Owl (<b>Aegolius</b> <b>funereus)</b> : When food deliveries are insufficient, the female will leave the nest and chase the male for minutes. (3) Northern Eagle-Owl (Bubo bubo) : No intersexual aggression has been recorded in the wild. But if only one female and male are in a cage, the female will kill the male. (4) Ural Owl (Strix uralensis) : No observations of intrapair aggression in the field, but in captivity the female will show a threat display to her male if he is slow to deliver food. (5) Northern Hawk-Owl (Surnia ulula) : Females react to courting males with aggressive vocalisations and with high intensity threat displays in captivity. (6) Little Owl (Athene noctua) : In small cages, a female strikes strangers of both sexes and will even strike her own male. (7) Eurasian Scops-Owl (Otus scops) : Females will strike strangers of both sexes, males will not attack strange females. Rankings for the female dominance (Mueller 1986) were correlated with RSD in weigh...|$|R
