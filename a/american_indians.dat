5|$|The {{archaeology}} of Iowa is {{the study}} of the buried remains of human culture within the state of Iowa from the earliest prehistoric through the late historic periods. When the <b>American</b> <b>Indians</b> first arrived in what is now Iowa more than 13,000 years ago, they were hunters and gatherers living in a Pleistocene glacial landscape. By the time European explorers visited Iowa, <b>American</b> <b>Indians</b> were largely settled farmers with complex economic, social, and political systems. This transformation happened gradually. During the Archaic period (10,500–2,800 years ago) <b>American</b> <b>Indians</b> adapted to local environments and ecosystems, slowly becoming more sedentary as populations increased. More than 3,000 years ago, during the Late Archaic period, <b>American</b> <b>Indians</b> in Iowa began utilizing domesticated plants. The subsequent Woodland period saw an increase on the reliance on agriculture and social complexity, with increased use of mounds, ceramics, and specialized subsistence. During the Late Prehistoric period (beginning about AD 900) increased use of maize and social changes led to social flourishing and nucleated settlements. The arrival of European trade goods and diseases in the Protohistoric period led to dramatic population shifts and economic and social upheaval, with the arrival of new tribes and early European explorers and traders. During the Historical period European traders and <b>American</b> <b>Indians</b> in Iowa gave way to American settlers and Iowa was transformed into an agricultural state.|$|E

5|$|During Harrison's administration, the Lakota Sioux, {{previously}} {{confined to}} reservations in South Dakota, grew restive {{under the influence}} of Wovoka, a medicine man, who encouraged them to participate in a spiritual movement called the Ghost Dance. Many in Washington did not understand the predominantly religious nature of the Ghost Dance, and thought it was a militant movement being used to rally Native Americans against the government. On December 29, 1890, troops from the Seventh Cavalry clashed with the Sioux at Wounded Knee. The result was a massacre of at least 146 Sioux, including many women and children; the dead Sioux were buried in a mass grave. In reaction Harrison directed Major General Nelson A. Miles to investigate and ordered 3500 federal troops to South Dakota; the uprising was brought to an end. Wounded Knee is considered the last major American Indian battle in the 19th century. Harrison's general policy on <b>American</b> <b>Indians</b> was to encourage assimilation into white society and, despite the massacre, he believed the policy to have been generally successful. This policy, known as the allotment system and embodied in the Dawes Act, was favored by liberal reformers at the time, but eventually proved detrimental to <b>American</b> <b>Indians</b> as they sold most of their land at low prices to white speculators.|$|E

40|$|Introduction <b>American</b> <b>Indian</b> youths smoke {{cigarettes}} at high rates, yet few smoking-cessation {{programs have been}} developed for them. The objective of this study, conducted during 2003 and 2004, was to determine the preliminary quit and reduction outcomes of the American Lung Association’s newly adapted <b>American</b> <b>Indian</b> Not On Tobacco (N-O-T) program. Methods Seventy-four <b>American</b> <b>Indian</b> youths aged 14 to 19 years in North Carolina were enrolled in the <b>American</b> <b>Indian</b> N-O-T program or a brief 15 -minute intervention. Quit and reduction rates were compared 3 months after baseline using compliant subsamples and intention-to-treat analyses. Results Among males in the <b>American</b> <b>Indian</b> N-O-T program, between 18 % (intention-to-treat) and 29 % (compliant subsample) quit smoking. Six males (28. 6 %) in the <b>American</b> <b>Indian</b> N-O-T program reported quitting smoking; one male (14. 3 %) in the brief intervention reported quitting. No females in either group quit smoking. More females in the <b>American</b> <b>Indian</b> N-O-T program reduced smoking than females in the brief intervention. Conclusion These pilot results suggest that the <b>American</b> <b>Indian</b> N-O-T program offers a useful and feasible cessation option for <b>American</b> <b>Indian</b> youths in North Carolina. Program modifications are necessary to improve outcomes for <b>American</b> <b>Indian</b> females, and recruitment issues require in-depth study.
