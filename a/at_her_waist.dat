500|$|Van der Weyden {{worked in}} the same {{tradition}} of portraiture as contemporaries Jan van Eyck and Robert Campin. In the early to middle 15th century, these three artists {{were among the first}} generation of [...] "Northern Renaissance" [...] painters, and the first northern Europeans to portray members of the middle and upper classes naturalistically rather than in a medieval Christian idealised form. In earlier Netherlandish art the profile view was the dominant mode of representation for the nobles or clergy worthy of portraiture. In works such as Portrait of a Man in a Turban (1433), Jan van Eyck broke this tradition and used the three-quarter profile of the face which became the standard in Netherlandish art. Here, van der Weyden utilises the same profile, which better allows him to describe the shape of the head and facial features of the sitter. She is shown in half-length, which enables the artist to show her hands crossed <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist.</b>|$|E
500|$|Gluck, an English artist whom Brooks painted around 1923, {{was noted}} in the {{contemporary}} press as much for her style of dress as for her art. She pushed the masculine style further than most by wearing trousers on all occasions, which was not considered acceptable in the 1920s. Articles about her presented her cross-dressing as an artistic eccentricity or {{as a sign that}} she was ultra-modern. [...] Brooks' portrait shows Gluck in a starched white shirt, a silk tie, and a long black belted coat that she designed and had made by a [...] "mad dressmaker"; her right hand, <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist,</b> holds a man's hat. Brooks painted these masculine accoutrements with the same attention she had once given to the parasols and ostrich plumes of La Belle Époque. But while many of Brooks' early paintings show sad and withdrawn figures [...] "consumed by petticoats, veiled hats and other period trappings of femininity", Gluck is self-possessed and quietly intensean artist who insists on being taken seriously. [...] Her appearance is so androgynous that {{it would be difficult to}} identify her as a woman without help from the title, and the title itselfPeter, a Young English Girlunderscores the gender ambiguity of the image.|$|E
2500|$|... wears a long, fitted {{jacket with}} three-quarter-length striped sleeves over a {{matching}} striped skirt. [...] A nosegay of flowers is pinned <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist,</b> c. 1880.|$|E

60|$|The lovely Mrs. McKelvey {{never was}} more {{fascinating}} than last evening {{in her black}} net gown relieved by dainty bands of silver and <b>at</b> <b>her</b> exquisite <b>waist</b> a glowing cluster of Aaron Ward roses.|$|R
6000|$|Soon, Madame Defarge's hands {{ceased to}} strike, and felt <b>at</b> <b>her</b> encircled <b>waist.</b> [...] "It is under my arm," [...] said Miss Pross, in smothered tones, [...] "you shall not draw it. I am {{stronger}} than you, I bless Heaven for it. I hold you till one or other of us faints or dies!" ...|$|R

2500|$|The two-light {{window at}} {{the east end of}} the north aisle {{represents}} Mary and Martha of Bethany, mentioned in Luke 38–42. In that story, Mary is interested in spiritual matters, whereas Martha prefers to do practical work. Thus Martha has a housekeeper's attributes of a spinning wheel and a purse <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist,</b> while Mary is praying and reading the Scriptures. This window is dedicated to Ann Mitchell, the village postmistress, by her husband. The three-light window on the north aisle carries the theme of evangelism and music. It shows King David in the centre light, playing music. The left-hand light carries the words, [...] "Their sound is gone out unto all lands," [...] and the right-hand light says [...] "and their words into the ends of the world." [...] This is a translation of the 4th and 5th lines of Psalm 19, as it appears in the Book of Common Prayer: day 4, morning prayer. The men on either side of David are both saints with halos, and churchmen, wearing mitres. The dedication for this window is missing, but it was said by a local newspaper to have been given by William Clapham Cautley, and that it is dedicated to George Thomas Woods of the Order of Saint John. Woods was church organist for 24 years.|$|E
60|$|Miss Lucretia {{opened a}} {{reticule}} <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist</b> and drew forth a newspaper clipping, which she unfolded and handed to Mrs. Merrill.|$|E
6000|$|... "She wears French corsets, of course. Nothing else {{gives one}} {{such a fine}} figure," [...] {{answered}} Maud, dropping the shawl to look with pride <b>at</b> <b>her</b> own wasp-like <b>waist</b> and stiff back.|$|R
2500|$|... wears a white satin tabbed bodice {{with full}} sleeves trimmed with silver braid or lace and a {{matching}} petticoat. Her bodice is laced {{up with a}} coral ribbon over a stomacher. A matching ribbon {{is set in a}} V-shape <b>at</b> <b>her</b> front <b>waist</b> and tied in a bow to one side. She wears a lace-trimmed smock or partlet with a broad, square collar. A ribbon and a string of pearls decorate her hair, 1632.|$|R

60|$|The door opened, and Louise herself, {{in a gray}} morning gown of some soft material, with a {{bunch of}} deep-red roses <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist,</b> looked into the room.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Somers, unclasping {{the hands}} {{which she had}} folded <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist,</b> and putting one of them out {{to take up the}} fan: [...] "You said you were not criticising the fan." ...|$|E
60|$|There {{were many}} keys upon the oval ring, but the fair Martian maid quickly {{selected}} that which sprung the great lock <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist,</b> and freed she hurried toward the secret panel.|$|E
60|$|A mere mite {{of a girl}} {{stood on}} the steps of the Barber's shop, looking across the Place. A mere baby, one might call her, dressed in the close white linen cap which small French country {{children}} wear (like the children in Dutch pictures), and in a frock of homespun blue, that had no shape except where it was tied round her little fat throat. So that, being naturally short and round all over, she looked, behind, as if she had been cut off <b>at</b> <b>her</b> natural <b>waist,</b> and had had her head neatly fitted on it.|$|R
60|$|He leered <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> {{put an arm}} about <b>her</b> <b>waist,</b> pulled <b>her</b> to him, {{and kissed}} her oafishly.|$|R
60|$|As {{he spoke}} {{he put his}} arm proudly round <b>her</b> <b>waist</b> and looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> with admiring eyes.|$|R
60|$|She did not move, {{nor did she}} answer him. <b>At</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist</b> hung a small {{bunch of}} {{household}} keys and this he seized with a sudden movement and jerked loose from its cord.|$|E
60|$|She {{folded her}} hands <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist,</b> and stood up very straight, looking firmly at Mrs. Munger, who {{made a show of}} taking a new grip of her senses as she sank unbidden into a chair.|$|E
60|$|Dick {{felt his}} heart beat as he saw Clare. She was dressed in white, and the silver clasp gleamed against a {{lavender}} band <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist.</b> It was significant that she wore it, {{but he could not}} see her face clearly. Then Ida beckoned Jake.|$|E
500|$|After {{waiting for}} hours at Howard Johnson's and phoning home repeatedly, Don drives home {{in the early morning}} to find Megan in their {{apartment}} with the security chain on the door. Don kicks the door in, violently struggles with Megan, and chases her through the apartment. Megan and Don trip and collapse on the floor as Megan weeps. Don tearfully hugs <b>her</b> <b>at</b> the <b>waist</b> and tells <b>her</b> he thought he had lost her.|$|R
60|$|Mulhall touched one {{and then}} another {{and pointed to the}} shore. The grass-sheds had disappeared, and Parlay's house rocked drunkenly, Because the wind blew {{lengthwise}} along the atoll, the house had been sheltered by the miles of cocoanut trees. But the big seas, breaking across from outside, were undermining it and hammering it to pieces. Already tilted down the slope of sand, its end was imminent. Here and there in the cocoanut trees people had lashed themselves. The trees did not sway or thresh about. Bent over rigidly from the wind, they remained in that position and vibrated monstrously. Underneath, across the sand, surged the white spume of the breakers. A big sea was likewise making {{down the length of the}} lagoon. It had plenty of room to kick up in the ten-mile stretch from the windward rim of the atoll, and all the schooners were bucking and plunging into it. The Malahini had begun shoving her bow and fo'c'sle head under the bigger ones, and <b>at</b> times <b>her</b> <b>waist</b> was filled rail-high with water.|$|R
50|$|For fall 1939 Borea styled striped necktie wool dresses. Her daytime frocks {{were worn}} with necktie wool blouses and heavy leather belts. Wooljackets were shown with plain skirts. Full skirted dresses with shirtwaist bodices {{were a part}} of her evening wear. One design was made in red and green {{vertical}} stripes. It tucked in <b>at</b> the <b>waist.</b> <b>Her</b> evening gowns were inspired from portraits by Velasquez. The features included long sleeves and gold buttons, with modern shirtwaist effects.|$|R
60|$|A gentle light {{gleamed in}} his blue eyes, and he paused before a trellis of June roses. With his {{gardening}} knife he cut three of them, {{and held them}} gallantly against her white gown. Her sensitive colour responded as she thanked him, and she pinned them deftly <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist.</b>|$|E
60|$|Responding to the {{pressure}} of the hand, back now <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist,</b> Barbara did not answer; {{and the sound of the}} little feet retracing their steps rose in the stillness. Neither of those two at the window turned their heads; once more the feet receded, and again began coming back.|$|E
60|$|The Dragon had {{suffered}} severely in her {{conflict with the}} elements, her large sails had been split or blown away, the bulwarks <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist</b> had been shattered, and considerable damage done to her gear and fittings. Four-and-twenty hours were allowed to the men for rest after their labours, and then all hands were set to work to refit.|$|E
60|$|He looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> for {{a minute}} in silence, and then, getting up from his chair, passed his arm round <b>her</b> <b>waist,</b> and pressed <b>her</b> closely to his heart.|$|R
60|$|With {{her hand}} upon her brother's shoulder, Louisa still stood looking <b>at</b> the fire. <b>Her</b> brother glanced <b>at</b> <b>her</b> face with greater {{interest}} than usual, and, encircling <b>her</b> <b>waist</b> with his arm, drew her coaxingly to him.|$|R
60|$|With his arm round <b>her</b> <b>waist,</b> he led <b>her</b> down {{a little}} distance, and they settled {{themselves}} in the shade; she, seated on the ground, he a little lower, reclining <b>at</b> <b>her</b> feet.|$|R
60|$|Hesitating on the step, a lady {{stood in}} the vine-covered doorway, a study {{in black and white}} in a frame of pink roses. The sash <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist,</b> the lace {{mantilla}} that clung about her throat, the deftly coiled hair with its sheen of the night waters--these in black. The simple gown--a tribute to the art of her countrywomen--in white.|$|E
60|$|Then {{she remembered}} that she had still to {{complete}} her equipment as a Pinzochera. The large leather purse or scarsella, with small coin in it, had to be hung on the cord <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist</b> (her florins and small jewels, presents from her godfather and cousin Brigida, were safely fastened within her serge mantle)--and {{on the other side}} must hang the rosary.|$|E
6000|$|... "Suppose the {{old lady}} doesn't come to," [...] Rawdon said to his [...] little wife as they sat {{together}} in the snug little Brompton [...] lodgings. She had been trying the new piano all the morning. [...] The new gloves fitted her to a nicety. The new shawl became [...] her wonderfully. The new rings glittered on her little hands, [...] and the new watch ticked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist.</b>|$|E
60|$|The Colonel looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> most dubiously. Dolly {{could talk}} {{of it as}} a tragedy, and a--a grand passion, and yet make a {{suggestion}} like that! Then his wrinkles began slowly to come alive, and he gave <b>her</b> <b>waist</b> a squeeze.|$|R
60|$|All looked <b>at</b> Car. <b>Her</b> gown {{was a light}} cotton print, {{and from}} {{the back of her head}} a kind of rope could be seen {{descending}} to some distance below <b>her</b> <b>waist,</b> like a Chinaman's queue.|$|R
5000|$|Sometimes {{the magician}} might give the {{impression}} of hypnotizing the assistant into a rigid trance before having her lifted onto the table. She is secured in place with two metal [...] "straps" [...] that close over <b>her</b> <b>waist</b> and which align close to the plane of the saw. She might also be further secured with straps or manacles <b>at</b> <b>her</b> wrists and ankles. A strip of wood is pushed beneath <b>her</b> <b>waist</b> in line with the saw. The saw is then started and the table set in motion. The saw visibly passes through the assistant and generally sounds like it is sawing through something.|$|R
