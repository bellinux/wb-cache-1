500|$|Beghe was a {{guest in}} May 2009 on the BBC World Service radio program , where he {{discussed}} his views on {{what he thought of}} Scientology when he first joined: [...] "I thought that it was something that was going to deliver miracles, and that it was the most selfless group of people that were totally dedicated to helping mankind, and I {{wanted to be part of}} it." [...] He was also critical of the Scientology organization leadership, including its head David Miscavige: [...] "I think that there are probably things of Scientology that are valuable and that can help people - my main issue is not with Scientology per se, it is with Scientology the organization - it is a corrupt I believe and probably a criminal endeavor, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> do with people who are in charge of Scientology mainly David Miscavige..." ...|$|E
500|$|St. John was {{instructed}} by the show's directors to watch about fifteen episodes of Howarth's performances of Todd {{because they wanted}} him to portray Todd like Howarth did. St. John reported that he watched two episodes, but never tried to mimic Howarth's style because he felt that it was limiting, uncreative, and destructive. He said, [...] "I needed {{to get a sense of}} who Todd was first, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> happen organically." [...] He did not care if Marlon Brando portrayed the role before him, and said that even actors who portray Hamlet do it differently, adding, [...] "I don't care what the other guy did. That's his time." [...] St. John felt that it was up to him to decide how to perform Todd. [...] "I know that sounds very arrogant and overconfident," [...] he stated, [...] "but it would be no fun to try to mimic somebody." ...|$|E
500|$|Daniel Montesinos-Donaghy of Den of Geek stated [...] "After the {{excellent}} pilot episode, 'Day One' {{is both a}} step forward and a step backward. As silly as {{the idea of a}} nymphomaniac extra-terrestrial gas is, the cast throw themselves into it with aplomb, quipping their way to the relatively gripping conclusion." [...] Patrick Holm of Total Sci-Fi felt that the second episode [...] "equates the word 'adult' with sex and swearing – more of a playground definition than a serious drama. In the conclusion of his review, Jonathan Capps of Noise to Signal felt that the episode was [...] "certainly nothing to get excited about, but I think it won't be too indicative of later episodes, as we're still getting to know these characters, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> take the fore in the first few episodes. However, Chris' [...] painfully simplistic, heavy-handed and often clichéd interpretation of sci-fi (some of Jack's techno-babble is frankly embarrassing) could prove to be a worrying factor later in the series." [...] A reviewer of TV Fodder felt [...] "Day One" [...] was a [...] "great second episode", adding [...] "there doesn't seem to be anything I don't like about this show".|$|E

40|$|We {{present the}} {{procedure}} of model calibration {{within the scope}} of financial applications. We discuss several models that are used to describe the movement of financial underlyings and state closed or semi-closed pricing formulas for basic financial instruments. Furthermore, we explain how these are used in a general calibration procedure with the purpose to determine sensible model parameters. Finally, we gather typical numerical issues that often arise in the context of calibration <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be handled with care...|$|R
500|$|In 2008, Popular Mechanics named The Truman Show {{as one of}} the 10 most prophetic {{science fiction}} films. Journalist Erik Sofge argued that the story {{reflects}} the falseness of reality television. [...] "Truman simply lives, and the show's popularity is its straightforward voyeurism. And, like Big Brother, Survivor, and every other reality show on the air, none of his environment is actually real." [...] He deemed it an eerie coincidence that Big Brother made its debut a year after the film's release, and he also compared the film to the 2003 program The Joe Schmo Show: [...] "Unlike Truman, Matt Gould could see the cameras, but all of the other contestants were paid actors, playing the part of various reality-show stereotypes. While Matt eventually got all of the prizes in the rigged contest, the show's central running joke was in the same existential ballpark as The Truman Show." [...] Weir declared, [...] "There has always been this question: Is the audience getting dumber? Or are we filmmakers patronizing them? Is this what they want? Or is this what we're giving them? But the public went to my film in large numbers. <b>And</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be encouraging." ...|$|E
2500|$|Swindon Town were {{knocked out}} of the FA Cup on 6 January 2007 after losing 2–1 away to Crystal Palace. Afterwards it was {{announced}} that local rivals Bristol Rovers were interested in a ground-share at the County Ground while the Memorial Stadium was redeveloped; fans and TrustSTFC opposed the move with vice-chairman Andy Ratcliffe stating: [...] "I think it’s a double-edged sword to be honest. I quite understand the attraction from the club’s point of view. Obviously it would be extra revenue <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be welcome. Against that, I think there is potential for flash points and I think the police and traders would have serious concerns." ...|$|E
2500|$|Not all the Pythons {{agree on}} the {{definition}} of the movie's tone. There was a brief exchange that occurred when the surviving members reunited in Aspen, Colorado, in 1998. In the section where Life of Brian is discussed, Terry Jones says, [...] "I think the film is heretical, but it's not blasphemous." [...] Eric Idle can be heard to concur, adding, [...] "It's a heresy." [...] However, John Cleese, disagreeing, counters, [...] "I don’t think it's a heresy. It's making fun of the way that people misunderstand the teaching." [...] Jones responds, [...] "Of course it's a heresy, John! It's attacking the Church! <b>And</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be heretical." [...] Cleese replies, [...] "No, it's not attacking the Church, necessarily. It's about people who cannot agree with each other." ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{argue that the}} {{detection}} of emotional expressions is, in its early stages, informationally encapsulated. I clarify and defend such a view via the appeal to data from social perception on the visual processing of faces, bodies, facial and bodily expressions. Encapsulated social perception might exist alongside processes that are cognitively penetrated, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do with recognition and categorization, and play a central evolutionary function in preparing early and rapid responses to the emotional stimuli...|$|R

40|$|Increased demand {{variability}} in supply chains (the bullwhip effect) {{has been discussed}} in the literature. The practical measurement of this effect, however, entails some problems <b>that</b> <b>have</b> not received much attention in the literature <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do with the aggregation of data, incompleteness of data, the isolation of demand data for defined supply chains {{that are part of}} a greater supply web. This paper discusses these conceptual measurement problems and discusses experiences in dealing with some of these problems in an industrial project. Also presents empirical results of measurements of the bullwhip effect in two supply chains...|$|R
