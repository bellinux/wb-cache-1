Another 159,000 turkeys were slaughtered with the cull being completed {{on the evening}} of 5 February. Also on 5 February there was criticism that nearby farmers had not been advised as to the action to be taken. Around 320 workers <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> were given anti-viral drugs. Although a vet from the site was admitted into hospital, suffering from a 'mild respiratory illness' during the evening of 6 February, it was found not to be bird flu. The plant was thoroughly disinfected, with cleaning complete on 12 February, and permission being given for production to resume.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} report comparatively investigates labour‘s responses to work restructuring <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Volkswagen (VW) <b>plants</b> in Germany (Kassel) and South Africa (Uitenhage). Since {{the advent of}} industrial revolution, the automotive industry has experienced rapid changes in work organisation and production systems. This report discusses work restructuring in the industry from the 1970 s to 2009, and examines labour‘s engagement with it <b>at</b> <b>the</b> two Volkswagen <b>plants.</b> Semi-structured interviews and focus groups were conducted with Works Council members <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Kassel <b>plant</b> and shop stewards <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Uitenhage <b>plant.</b> <b>The</b> report concludes that VW workers <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Kassel <b>plant</b> are more proactive and effective in their engagement with workplace restructuring than their counterparts <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Uitenhage <b>plant.</b> <b>The</b> report proposes two factors to explain this variation. Firstly, the report argues that the German industrial relations system enables workers <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Kassel <b>plant</b> to influence and shape work restructuring through institutionalised participation. Secondly, the inability of workers <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Uitenhage <b>plant</b> to influence restructuring of work is worsened {{by the fact that}} their plant is controlled by VW headquarters in Germany. The concept of imperial restructuring is developed to highlight difficulties faced by labour <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Uitenhage <b>plant</b> to influence work restructuring processes. It is further argued that Marxist literature on worker participation ignores that workers are sometimes interested in participating in decision making when confronted by uncertainty about their jobs, just as employers are interested in worker participation when their authority and legitimacy is threatened...|$|R

5|$|Faced with stiff {{competition}} and {{an inability to}} increase its own capacity, Rogers Locomotive Works was purchased by ALCO in 1905. Rogers' last independently built locomotive was serial number 6271, a 0-6-0 tank locomotive built for W. R. Grace & Company in February 1905. ALCO continued building locomotives at the Rogers plant until 1913 when manufacturing <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> ceased permanently. Locomotives built at the Rogers plant under ALCO are generally referred to as locomotives built by ALCO-Rogers. ALCO used the Rogers plant buildings as warehouses well into the 1920s, but eventually sold off all of the property. The original Rogers erecting shop was converted into office space and was still in use in that manner as late as 1992.|$|E
5|$|In 1915, Conant {{entered into}} a {{business}} partnership with two other Harvard chemistry graduates, Stanley Pennock and Chauncey Loomis, to form the LPC Laboratories. They opened a plant in a one-story building in Queens, New York, where they manufactured chemicals used by the pharmaceutical industry like benzoic acid that were selling at high prices {{on account of the}} interruption of imports from Germany due to World War I. In 1916, the departure of organic chemist Roger Adams created a vacancy at Harvard that was offered to Conant. Since he aspired to an academic career, Conant accepted the offer and returned to Harvard. On November 27, 1916, there was an explosion <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>plant.</b> Pennock and two other workers were killed and the plant was completely destroyed. One of the contributing causes was Conant's faulty test procedures.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to workers, Schindler moved 250 wagon loads of machinery {{and raw materials}} to the new factory. Few if any useful artillery shells were produced <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>plant.</b> When officials from the Armaments Ministry questioned the factory's low output, Schindler bought finished goods {{on the black market}} and resold them as his own. The rations provided by the SS were insufficient {{to meet the needs of}} the workers, so Schindler spent most of his time in Kraków, obtaining food, armaments, and other materials. His wife Emilie remained in Brünnlitz, surreptitiously obtaining additional rations and caring for the workers' health and other basic needs. Schindler also arranged for the transfer of as many as 3,000 Jewish women out of Auschwitz to small textiles plants in the Sudetenland in an effort to increase their chances of surviving the war.|$|E

5|$|On May 3, {{striking}} workers in Chicago met near the McCormick Harvesting Machine Company plant. Union molders <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> had been locked out since early February and the predominantly Irish-American workers at McCormick had {{come under attack}} from Pinkerton guards during an earlier strike action in 1885. This event, along with the eight-hour militancy of McCormick workers, had gained the strikers some respect and notoriety around the city. By {{the time of the}} 1886 general strike, strikebreakers entering the McCormick plant were under protection from a garrison of 400 police officers. Although half of the replacement workers defected to the general strike on May 1, McCormick workers continued to harass strikebreakers as they crossed the picket lines.|$|E
5|$|Passenger {{transport}} was of two types; trains that {{corresponded with}} the ferries and connected with trains at Tinnoset, and commuter trains transporting workers to the plants at Rjukan. The commuter trains were initiated in 1913, and Norsk Hydro started building housing at Ingolfsland and Tveito, and both Ingolfsland and Miland got their own stops, and from 1919 stations. The two kilometers (one mile) commuter train from Rjukan to Ingofsland took five minutes; a month pass cost NOK 2.50 for employees and their families. There were seventeen departures {{in each direction}} per week, timed to fit with the working times <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>plant.</b> This increased to 58 in 1916, when a new stop at Tveito was opened.|$|E
5|$|Waste {{arriving}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> is {{checked in}} and weighed, before {{being delivered to}} the plant's reception hall. The large reception hall allows the vehicles to dump their waste safely. Air for the combustion of the waste later in the plant is drawn from the reception hall so that odour and dust doesn't pollute the building's surroundings. From the hall waste is tipped into a large concrete bunker. Here the feedstock is homogenefied by a crane operator, who mixes and removes unsuitable waste. A grab crane then manoeuvers waste from the bunker to the hoppers that feed the furnace. This crane is operated from a control room. This room also monitors the equipment in the plant, the combustion gases and maximises {{the efficiency of the}} plant.|$|E

40|$|Regeneration of {{eucalypt}} plantations from coppice {{is increasingly}} {{being used in}} Australia to reduce the costs of re-establishment in subsequent rotations. However, little is known on {{whether there are differences}} between the performance of a cut-to-length harvester felling coppiced and planted eucalypt plantations in Australia. The study compared single-grip harvester cycle times, time elements and post-harvest stump dimensions between first rotation planted and second rotation coppiced Eucalyptus globulus stands with similar sized trees on two comparable sites in the south-west of Western Australia. Cycle times were significantly lower <b>at</b> <b>the</b> coppiced site compared with those <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>planted</b> site. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> mean pooled tree volume, harvester productivity <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>planted</b> site was 19. 1 Green Metric tonne(GMt) / productive machine hour (PMH 0) and 23. 4 GMt/PMH 0 <b>at</b> <b>the</b> coppiced site. The difference in harvester productivity was believed to be caused by reduced bark adhesion <b>at</b> <b>the</b> coppiced site following 51 mm of rain immediately prior to the study after an extended dry period. Felling time was significantly longer <b>at</b> <b>the</b> coppiced site (8 % more time than <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>planted</b> site) because <b>the</b> operator had to spend more time manoeuvring the harvester head to avoid or remove small shoots <b>at</b> <b>the</b> base of many coppiced trees. Stump height and volume were significantly greater <b>at</b> <b>the</b> coppiced site (7. 7 m 3 /ha) compared with those <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>planted</b> site (4 m 3 /ha) because the shape of the coppiced stumps and the design of the harvester head did not allow the stumps to be cut shorter...|$|R

5|$|Weapons {{production}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> {{was halted}} after a combined FBI and EPA raid in 1989. Due {{to the end}} of the Cold War, changes in nuclear weapons policy, and years of protests, the Rocky Flats Plant was shut down, with its buildings demolished and completely removed from the site. The site's mission then changed to cleanup. The Rocky Flats Plant was declared a CERCLASuperfund site in 1989 and began its transformation to a cleanup site in February 1992. Removal of the plant and surface contamination was largely completed in the late 1990s and early 2000s, with federal and state agency support and stakeholder input. The cleanup effort decommissioned and demolished over 800 structures; removed over 21 tons of weapons-grade material; removed over 1.3 million cubic meters of waste; and, treated more than 16 million gallons of water. Four groundwater treatment systems were also constructed. The site achieved regulatory closure in 2006.|$|E
