5|$|Morrowind {{begins with}} the player's character, having been imprisoned, {{arriving}} in Morrowind by boat {{in order to be}} pardoned. This is a common introductory segment throughout the main installments of the series. A tutorial depicting the prisoner's release moves the player through the process of character creation. The player is successively asked questions by a fellow prisoner, an officer, and a bureaucrat as the player is registered as a free citizen; choosing, in the process, the player character's name, race, gender, class, and birthsign. These affect the player's starting <b>attributes,</b> <b>skills,</b> and abilities. The player then determines their class in one of three ways; Picking from a class list, randomly generating a class via questions, or creating a custom class themselves.|$|E
25|$|The fourth {{edition of}} Shadowrun uses a point-based {{character}} creation system. Earlier editions {{and later in}} the fifth edition, used a priority-based system with point-based character creation as an advanced option. Priorities are divided into race, magic, <b>attributes,</b> <b>skills,</b> and resources. All things that do not explicitly fall under the first four classifications, including contacts in third and earlier editions of Shadowrun, are given cash-equivalent values to be bought with resources.|$|E
25|$|Role-playing {{games of}} the 1970s and 1980s, such as Dungeons & Dragons, {{generally}} used random numbers generated by dice rolls to assign statistics to player characters. GURPS, {{following the lead of}} the Hero System first used by the Champions role-playing game, assigned players a specified number of points with which to build their characters. These points were spent to get <b>attributes,</b> <b>skills,</b> and advantages, such as the ability to cast magic spells. Additional points can be obtained by accepting lower-than-average attributes, disadvantages, and other limitations.|$|E
50|$|All {{skills and}} checks {{are based on}} a d10 system of <b>Attribute</b> <b>Skill</b> Variable Modifier vs Difficulty or an {{opposing}} roll. This convention applies to all rolls in the system.|$|R
50|$|In many RPG systems, non-trivial actions {{often require}} dice rolls. Some RPGs roll a fixed number of dice, add a number to the die roll {{based on the}} character's <b>attributes</b> and <b>skills,</b> and compare the {{resulting}} number with a difficulty rating. However, in other systems the character's <b>attributes</b> and <b>skills</b> {{determine the number of}} dice to be rolled.|$|R
5000|$|Qualification: Demonstration of {{physical}} <b>attributes,</b> knowledge, <b>skill,</b> {{training and experience}} required to properly perform NDT tasks.|$|R
500|$|Combat within Shadowrun {{often require}} sharp reflexes, as {{practically}} every screen contains hidden assassins who, from random locations, open fire on Jake; the player may retreat or must otherwise immediately find {{the source of}} the attack and respond. Enemies typically drop nuyen, while at the same time, Jake builds up [...] "karma". If the player retires to a bed to restore health and save one's progress, karma can be allocated into different <b>attributes,</b> <b>skills,</b> and magical powers.|$|E
50|$|The {{character}} {{details are}} defined by <b>attributes,</b> <b>skills,</b> schticks and weapons.|$|E
50|$|Unisystem games use a point-buy {{system to}} {{generate}} characters. Points are spent on <b>Attributes,</b> <b>Skills,</b> Qualities and Metaphysics. Drawbacks {{can be used}} to gain extra points.|$|E
50|$|Storytelling System {{characters}} are built with character points that represent a Dot on their character sheets. Each Dot represents a ten-sided die (d10). The more Dots in an <b>Attribute</b> or <b>Skill,</b> {{the better the}} character is at those abilities. A set of dice representing the Dots in an <b>Attribute</b> or <b>Skill</b> forms a Dice Pool that the character uses to see if he/she succeeds or fails at specific tasks.|$|R
5000|$|The child’s own disposition, {{including}} a particular constellation of <b>attributes,</b> temperament, <b>skills,</b> and potentials, affect {{the process of}} development.|$|R
50|$|All other {{checks are}} made by rolling 1d20 and adding the {{relevant}} <b>attribute</b> or <b>skill</b> modifier and compared to the task rating.|$|R
50|$|Infinity is a {{universal}} system, with brief rules for character <b>attributes,</b> <b>skills,</b> and magic, plus more detailed rules {{for all sorts of}} movement (including vehicles) and combat.|$|E
5000|$|Numberless Interface: DartMUD {{differs from}} earlier LPMuds {{in that it}} is class-less and level-less. <b>Attributes,</b> <b>skills,</b> hit points, and magical aura are {{represented}} using generalized text descriptions, rather than specific numbers.|$|E
50|$|During the game, {{tests are}} made with a simple d20 die roll, {{modified}} by testing characters' <b>attributes,</b> <b>skills</b> and other situation modifiers. If the roll {{is higher than the}} difficulty level, the action is successful.|$|E
50|$|Characters advance by {{increasing}} their <b>skills</b> and <b>attributes.</b> During play, characters earn additional <b>Attribute</b> and <b>Skills</b> Points {{related to the}} <b>attributed</b> and <b>skills</b> they used in play. The cost to increase a <b>skill</b> or <b>attribute</b> {{is the difference between}} the cost of the level they currently have, and the cost of the level they want. Therefore, to improve a Strength score from 5 to 6 would cost 11 points (6² - 5² = 11, omitting aptitude savings).|$|R
5000|$|A {{character}} in CORPS is built {{based on two}} types of statistic based on <b>Attributes</b> and <b>Skills.</b> These are purchased in a points based system, using Attribute Points (AP) to purchase <b>attributes,</b> and <b>Skill</b> Points (SP) to purchase skills. The total number of points available to spend depends on the setting and Game Master. A [...] "normal" [...] human might start with 100AP and 50SP, while a superhero character might start with 200AP and SP (or more).|$|R
50|$|In Fudge, {{character}} Traits such as <b>Attributes</b> and <b>Skills,</b> {{are rated}} on a seven-level, ascending adjective scale: Terrible, Poor, Mediocre, Fair, Good, Great, and Superb.|$|R
50|$|WitchCraft was {{the first}} Unisystem game published. Like all Unisystem games, WitchCraft uses a point-buy system to {{generate}} characters. Points are then spent on <b>Attributes,</b> <b>Skills,</b> Qualities and Metaphysics. Drawbacks can then be used to gain extra points.|$|E
50|$|Protective {{factors are}} {{conditions}} or <b>attributes</b> (<b>skills,</b> strengths, resources, supports or coping strategies) in individuals, families, communities or {{the larger society}} that help people deal more effectively with stressful events and mitigate or eliminate risk in families and communities.|$|E
50|$|The Spiritual Attributes {{also serve}} as the game's {{character}} improvement and development mechanic. Points are awarded to the attributes by the game master when characters act according to these attributes, and spent by players to increase <b>attributes,</b> <b>skills,</b> weapon proficiencies and other character aspects.|$|E
50|$|Nightlife rules {{use only}} ten-sided dice, or d10s. Rolls are usually made by adding {{one of several}} <b>Attributes</b> to a <b>Skill,</b> and then {{attempting}} to roll less than the total on a percentile die. In some cases, several d10s are rolled and then added together, as in rolling <b>attributes</b> and <b>skills</b> at character creation, or gaining new skills and bonuses {{at the end of}} each adventure.|$|R

50|$|A {{character}} in EABA {{is built based on}} <b>attributes,</b> <b>skills</b> and traits. Based on points system, Attribute Points (AP) {{are used to}} purchase attributes, and Skill Points (SP) to purchase skills. Traits are purchased using either type of points, depending on the trait purchased; negative traits can also be chosen which give a character additional AP or SP.|$|E

They want to encourage and foster in them a range of positive <b>attributes,</b> <b>skills</b> and attitudes to prepare them for a rapidly changing world beyond school.|$|E
50|$|As {{with most}} {{role-playing}} games, Bushido players use characters {{defined by a}} series of <b>attributes,</b> <b>skills,</b> professions and levels. The professions are Bushi (fighters), Budoka (martial artists), Yakuza (gangsters), Ninja, Shugenja (Taoist-style wizards) and Gakusho (priests, either Buddhist or Shinto). Character progression is implemented by both down-time training and level advancement. There are only six character levels, an unusually small number in role-playing games.|$|E
5000|$|The job {{system is}} similar to that of Final Fantasy XI. [...] Every {{character}} starts with the occupation Commoner, which grants no special skills. After reaching level 10 as a commoner, by completing specified tasks, the player can qualify for new tasks. Levels, <b>attributes,</b> and <b>skill</b> points are recorded separately for each job. Players may go to an NPC in any town to select a job which their level qualifies them to take. Levels, <b>attributes,</b> and <b>skill</b> points are recorded separately for each job type.|$|R
40|$|This article {{analyzes}} {{the process of}} feminization that affected the administrative sector in Buenos Aires between 1910 and 1950. This process was characterized {{by an increase in}} the number of women working as typists and secretaries. On the one hand, it discusses the interpretations that situated the process in a later period and, on the other hand, it defines the social conceptions that <b>attributed</b> <b>skills</b> inherent to women to these occupations, conjugated with special technical training. It thus demonstrates that administrative jobs received certain quotas of social prestige with respect to other female occupations...|$|R
40|$|Students come {{to first}} year {{engineering}} degree courses {{with a variety}} of learning styles and experiences. Many students can solve problems but lack the ability to critically analyse data and results, and are unable to present the data in meaningful ways. There can be an expectation that these generic attributes are either already present, or will be developed by osmosis through the degree program. This paper describes how learning outcomes are achieved, generic student <b>attribute</b> <b>skills</b> are fostered and experimental reporting skills are nurtured in a specialised unit in experimental methods...|$|R
50|$|The Buffy and Angel RPGs utilize a point-based {{character}} creation system, {{in which}} each player character receives a set number of points in different categories which can then be spent on <b>Attributes,</b> <b>Skills,</b> and Qualities. Drawbacks {{may also be purchased}} to provide additional character points, up to an overall limit of ten points. The number of points available to any given character depends on the Character Type (see below).|$|E
