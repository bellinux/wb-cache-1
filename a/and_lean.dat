5|$|Their {{cattle and}} oxen were now {{exhausted}} <b>and</b> <b>lean,</b> but the Donner Party crossed the next stretch of desert relatively unscathed, and the journey {{seemed to get}} easier, particularly through the valley next to the Ruby Mountains. Despite their near hatred of Hastings, {{they had no choice}} but to follow his tracks, which were weeks old. On September 26, two months after embarking on the cutoff, the Donner Party rejoined the traditional trail along a stream that became known as the Humboldt River. The shortcut had probably delayed them by a month.|$|E
5|$|While the pugs {{that are}} {{depicted}} in eighteenth century prints {{tend to be}} long <b>and</b> <b>lean,</b> modern breed preferences are for a square cobby body, a compact form, a deep chest, and well-developed muscle. Their smooth and glossy coats can be fawn, apricot fawn, silver fawn, or black. The markings are clearly defined, {{and there is a}} trace of a black line extending from the occiput to the tail. The tail normally curls tightly over the hip.|$|E
5|$|A {{factor that}} {{influences}} the directional stability of a bike is wheelbase, the horizontal {{distance between the}} ground contact points of {{the front and rear}} wheels. For a given displacement of the front wheel, due to some disturbance, the angle of the resulting path from the original is inversely proportional to wheelbase. Also, the radius of curvature for a given steer angle <b>and</b> <b>lean</b> angle is proportional to the wheelbase. Finally, the wheelbase increases when the bike is leaned and steered. In the extreme, when the lean angle is 90°, and the bike is steered in the direction of that lean, the wheelbase is increased by the radius of the front and rear wheels.|$|E

5|$|The ant {{who lost}} the ritual fight will lower its body, <b>and</b> <b>lean</b> {{sideways}} from the victorious ant. The victorious ant will remain raised upward and reach {{down to the}} worker and open its mandibles wider, grasping on the opponent's mandibles, and then tug and shake its head slightly for a few moments. However, the fight may continue if neither worker backs down, and will commence a side to side posture. Both ants circle each other and present their gasters directed to their opponent, and on some occasions, either {{one or both of}} the ants would kick outward using their legs at each other. Eventually, they will break contact and groom once appeasement has been reached and continue to search for another ant.|$|E
5|$|A tall <b>and</b> <b>lean</b> swimmer {{known for}} her elegant technique, Leech started {{swimming}} as a child to build strength {{after a series of}} stomach disorders in her infancy. She quickly rose to prominence after breaking a string of age group records. In 1955, she became the youngest swimmer to win an Australian title, claiming victory in the 110-yard freestyle at the age of 13. She twice broke the Australian record in the 100-yard freestyle in late 1955, thereby positioning herself as a leading contender for Olympic selection in 1956. Leech's preparation was hindered by illness, which forced her out of the 1956 Australian Championships, but she recovered to gain Olympic selection in both the 100-metre freestyle and the corresponding relay. Leech produced a late surge to take bronze in the individual event and seal an Australian trifecta, before swimming the second leg in the relay to help secure an Australian victory in world record time. Leech retired after the Olympics at the age of 15; she cited anxiety caused by racing as one of the main factors in her decision.|$|E
25|$|DevOps and {{continuous}} delivery {{share a common}} background in agile methods <b>and</b> <b>lean</b> thinking: small and frequent changes with focused value to the end customer. They are well communicated and collaborated internally, thus helping achieve faster time to market, with reduced risks.|$|E

25|$|Over 150 million Americans play video games, with {{an average}} age of 35 and a gender {{breakdown}} of 59 percent male and 41 percent female. American gamers are more likely to vote than non-gamers, feel that the economy is the most important political issue, <b>and</b> <b>lean</b> conservative.|$|E
25|$|It is also {{important}} to distinguish the steering torque necessary to initiate the lean required for a given turn from the sustained steering torque and steering angle necessary to maintain a constant radius <b>and</b> <b>lean</b> angle until it is time to exit the turn.|$|E
25|$|The company {{implemented}} Six Sigma <b>and</b> <b>lean</b> {{manufacturing processes}} {{to improve its}} efficiency at all levels. It was thus able to weather the Great Recession of 2008 and improve its performance afterward, as it had 80 years earlier when the Depression struck. Growth, particularly in the composites business, led management to move the company's headquarters out of the Albany area.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} types of exercise interventions that can be applied in kinesiology to athletic, normal, and clinical populations. Aerobic exercise interventions help to improve cardiovascular endurance. Anaerobic strength training programs can increase muscular strength, power, <b>and</b> <b>lean</b> body mass. Decreased risk of falls and increased neuromuscular control can be attributed to balance intervention programs. Flexibility programs can increase functional range of motion and reduce the risk of injury.|$|E
25|$|From {{this point}} on a curious {{development}} took place: while in the United States the possibility of applying the computer to business operations {{led to the development}} of management software architecture such as MRP and successive modifications, and ever more sophisticated optimization techniques and manufacturing simulation software, in post-war Japan a series of events at Toyota Motor {{led to the development of}} the Toyota Production System (TPS) <b>and</b> <b>Lean</b> Manufacturing.|$|E
25|$|Gymnastics {{for males}} is {{tailored}} only towards {{those that are}} muscular and defined, rather than the boys that are thin <b>and</b> <b>lean,</b> due to the equipment that is used. These boys could compete with the women, but {{are not permitted to}} participate with the other sex, and males have different events that require a greater amount of strength to women. The men that do compete in gymnastics at a competitive level are defined as 'men' because of their build.|$|E
50|$|Two barbarian builds {{have been}} detailed, the Rageblood Barbarian, {{which focuses on}} the Rageblood Vigor form of Feral Might, Strength <b>and</b> Constitution <b>and</b> <b>leans</b> towards the defender role, and the Thaneborn Barbarian, which focuses on Strength, Charisma and a {{different}} form of Feral Might, <b>and</b> <b>leans</b> towards the leader role.

25|$|El Sanadi, an Egyptian Coptic Christian {{whose family}} {{immigrated to the}} United States in the sixties, earned his bachelor's degree in {{chemistry}} with honors from Case Western Reserve University, graduated with honors in medicine and public health from Ohio State University, completed medical residency and a one-year research fellowship at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation in Cleveland, Ohio, {{and went on to}} complete certifications as a licensed Health Care Risk Manager <b>and</b> <b>Lean</b> Six Sigma Black Belt.|$|E
25|$|When {{combined}} with an appropriate exercise program, dietary supplementation with β-hydroxy β-methylbutyrate (HMB) {{has been shown to}} dose-dependently augment gains in muscle hypertrophy (i.e., the size of a muscle), muscle strength, <b>and</b> <b>lean</b> body mass, reduce exercise-induced skeletal muscle damage, and expedite recovery from high-intensity exercise. HMB is believed to produce these effects by increasing muscle protein synthesis and decreasing muscle protein breakdown by various mechanisms, including activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and inhibition of the proteasome in skeletal muscles.|$|E
25|$|The usual {{dose range}} for {{induction}} of anesthesia using thiopental is from 3 to 6mg/kg; however, {{there are many}} factors that can alter this. Premedication with sedatives such as benzodiazepines or clonidine will reduce requirements, as do specific disease states and other patient factors. Among patient factors are: age, sex, <b>and</b> <b>lean</b> body mass. Specific disease conditions that can alter the dose requirements of thiopentone {{and for that matter}} any other intravenous anaesthetic are: hypovolemia, burns, azotemia, hepatic failure, hypoproteinemia, etc.|$|E

25|$|To {{determine}} the likely {{cause of the}} paramedic's head injury, the AAIB requested that Loganair have {{a man of the}} same height as the paramedic sit in the paramedic's seat of another of their Islander air ambulances, fasten his seat belt, <b>and</b> <b>lean</b> fully forward to see what obstructions might be encountered. The subject's head came close {{to the back of the}} pilot's seat but did not contact it. However, under rapid deceleration, or had the seat belt been slightly looser, his head would have contacted the back of the pilot's seat.|$|E
25|$|Also from Teramo are the spreadable {{sausages}} {{flavored with}} nutmeg, liver sausages tasting of garlic and spices. The ventricina from the Vasto area {{is made with}} large pieces of fat <b>and</b> <b>lean</b> pork, pressed and seasoned with powdered sweet peppers and fennel and all encased in the dehydrated stomach of the pig itself. Atri and Rivisondoli are famous for cheeses. Mozzarella, either fresh or seasoned, made from ewe's milk, although {{a great number of}} lesser known varieties of these cheeses can be found all over Abruzzo and Molise.|$|E
25|$|When the surfer is at wave speed, the surfer must quickly pop up, stay low, {{and stay}} {{toward the front}} of the wave to become stable and prevent falling as the wave steepens. The {{acceleration}} is less toward the front than toward the back. The physics behind the surfing of the wave involves the horizontal acceleration force (Fsinθ) and the vertical force (Fcosθ=mg). Therefore, the surfer should lean forward to gain more speed, <b>and</b> <b>lean</b> on back foot to brake. Also, to increase the length of the ride of the wave, the surfer should travel parallel to the wave crest.|$|E
