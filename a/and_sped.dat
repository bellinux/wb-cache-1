Control rats received saline. Sympathectomized rats displayed reductions in blood pressure (BP) and atria norepinephrine levels while NGF levels in DRG, spleen, and ventricles were increased.

40|$|<b>Sp</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Sp</b> 3 are ubiquitously {{expressed}} mammalian transcription {{factors that}} activate or repress {{the expression of}} a variety of genes and are thought to compete for the same DNA binding site. We used indirect immunofluorescence microscopy and image deconvolution to show that <b>Sp</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Sp</b> 3 are organized into distinct nonoverlapping domains in human breast and ovarian cells. Domains of <b>Sp</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Sp</b> 3 infrequently associate with sites of transcription. Sp 3 partitions with the tightly bound nuclear protein fraction of hormone responsive MCF- 7 breast cancer cells, whereas only a subpopulation of Sp 1 is found in that fraction. Both <b>Sp</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Sp</b> 3 are bound to the nuclear matrix, and the nuclear matrix-associated sites of <b>Sp</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Sp</b> 3 are different. Indirect immunofluorescence studies demonstrate that <b>Sp</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Sp</b> 3 associate with histone deacetylases 1 and 2 and with the estrogen receptor �, albeit at low frequencies in MCF- 7 cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and re-ChIP assays revealed that although both <b>Sp</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Sp</b> 3 bind to the estrogen-responsive trefoil factor 1 promoter in MCF- 7 cells, they do not occupy the same promoter.

Ranulf had previously claimed that he had the rights to Lincoln Castle, held by Stephen, and under the guise of a social visit, Ranulf seized the fortification in a surprise attack. Stephen marched north to Lincoln and agreed to a truce with Ranulf, probably to keep him from joining the Empress's faction, under which Ranulf would be allowed to keep the castle.

5|$|Casting Crowns {{was formed}} in 1999 by Mark Hall (lead vocals), Hector Cervantes (guitar, vocals), Juan DeVevo (guitar, vocals), and Melodee DeVevo (violin, vocals) as a student worship band. The band is {{originally}} from Daytona Beach, Florida but relocated to Eagle's Landing First Baptist Church in McDonough, Georgia in 2001, where they recruited Megan Garrett (piano/vocals), Andy Williams (drums), and Chris Huffman (bass guitar) as members. One of their independent records was discovered by Mark A. Miller, the lead vocalist for country band Sawyer Brown. Although Casting Crowns had not released their independent records with intentions of receiving a record deal, Miller offered the band {{the opportunity to become}} the first artists signed to his record label. The band agreed to join and signed with the as-yet-unnamed record label, an imprint of Provident Label Group, and began work on their debut album. As a group, Casting Crowns was unusual in several ways, such as having seven members, never having toured before, and their producer (Miller) having no history in the Christian music industry. However, Christian singer and songwriter Steven Curtis Chapman was brought in to co-produce the album with Miller, giving the project a greater amount of support in the Christian music industry. Terry Hemmings, Provident Label Group CEO/President and a personal friend of Miller, openly predicted success for Casting Crowns and made them one of his top priorities at the label. While most artists in a similar situation would have received nine months for artist development, Hemmings gave the band four months <b>and</b> <b>sped</b> up the album's release. Casting Crowns was recorded at Glow in the Dark Studio in Decatur, Georgia and Zoo Studio in Franklin, Tennessee. The album was engineered by Matt Goldman and Sam Hewitt.|$|E
