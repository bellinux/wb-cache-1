40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of <b>apalcillin</b> and piperacillin, each administered intravenously as {{a single}} 2 -g dose, were compared in 10 volunteers in a randomized study of crossover design using bioassay and high-pressure liquid chromatographic procedures. The concentrations of both penicillins in serum were determined {{over a period of}} 12 h and in urine over 24 h. Concentrations of <b>apalcillin</b> and piperacillin {{at the end of the}} 15 -min infusion were similar; however, at 8 h, concentrations of piperacillin were below measurable levels, whereas concentrations of <b>apalcillin</b> were still measurable at 10 h. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated according to a two-compartment open model. The area under the curve and the half-life for <b>apalcillin</b> were larger than for piperacillin. On the other hand, renal clearance of piperacillin was substantially greater than that of <b>apalcillin.</b> Of the <b>apalcillin</b> excreted via the kidneys, approximately one-fifth was eliminated as two microbiologically inactive penicilloic acid derivatives. The nonrenal clearance of <b>apalcillin</b> was 79 % of total clearance. Binding of <b>apalcillin</b> to serum protein was almost twice that of piperacillin...|$|E
40|$|<b>Apalcillin,</b> a naphthydridine {{derivative}} of ampicillin, was compared with ticarcillin, azlocillin, mezlocillin, piperacillin, cefotaxime, and cefoperazone against gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial isolates and with cefsulodin and tobramycin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The minimal concentrations of <b>apalcillin</b> at which 50 and 90 % of hospital isolates of Escherichia coli were inhibited {{were similar to}} those of mezlocillin and piperacillin (1. 6 and 100 micrograms/ml, respectively). <b>Apalcillin</b> had minimal inhibitory concentrations similar to those of piperacillin against Citrobacter freundii and Citrobacter diversus. Against Klebsiella, <b>apalcillin</b> inhibited 50 % of organisms at a concentration of 6. 3 micrograms/ml, similar to piperacillin. The activity of <b>apalcillin</b> against Enterobacter (E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, and E. agglomerans) was similar to that of mezlocillin and piperacillin and greater than that of ticarcillin. The activity of <b>apalcillin</b> against Proteus mirabilis was {{similar to that of the}} other agents, as was its activity against indole-positive Proteus and Providencia. Only 40 % of Serratia were inhibited at an <b>apalcillin</b> concentration of 25 micrograms/ml. <b>Apalcillin</b> was as active as piperacillin but twofold less active than cefoxitin or moxalactam against Bacteroides fragilis. It was as active as piperacillin, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin against P. aeruginosa (<b>apalcillin</b> inhibited 90 % of organisms at a concentration of 25 mg/ml). There was an inoculum effect and a difference in the minimal inhibitory concentration and minimal bactericidal concentration with beta-lactamase strains. <b>Apalcillin</b> was hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamase but not as well by cephalosporinases...|$|E
40|$|Quantitative {{susceptibility}} {{tests were}} performed in four separate medical centers, in which <b>apalcillin</b> was compared with piperacillin and carbenicillin. Data from tests of 6, 797 isolates confirmed that <b>apalcillin</b> and piperacillin had nearly identical spectra of activity but that <b>apalcillin</b> was significantly more active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC required to inhibit 90 % of strains, 2. 0 versus 64 micrograms/ml) and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus subsp. anitratus (MIC required to inhibit 90 % of strains, 2. 0 versus 16 micrograms/ml).

40|$|The susceptibilities of 317 gram-negative bacilli to <b>apalcillin</b> and {{piperacillin}} {{were determined}} by standardized microdilution and disk diffusion tests. The respective percentages of strains susceptible to {{less than or equal}} to 64 micrograms of <b>apalcillin</b> and piperacillin per ml were as follows: members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, 90 and 88 %; randomly selected Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 100 and 100 %; multi-drug-resistant P. aeruginosa, 100 and 75 %; and other nonfermenters and Aeromonas hydrophila, 99 and 97 %. The drugs had equal activity against Enterobacteriaceae and A. hydrophila; <b>apalcillin</b> was more active against Pseudomonas species and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and piperacillin was more active against other nonfermenters. By using linear regression analysis, we found that the MICs of <b>apalcillin</b> and piperacillin were highly interrelated; the lines of best fit had slopes close to unity, and correlation coefficients (r) were greater than 0. 90 for Enterobacteriaceae as a group and for other species individually. With disk diffusion testing, inhibition zone diameters around 100 micrograms <b>apalcillin</b> and 100 micrograms piperacillin disks correlated well with respective MICs for Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa (r = - 0. 93 to - 0. 96). Using an error rate-bound classification scheme, we determined breakpoints for <b>apalcillin</b> susceptibility and confirmed those previously established for piperacillin to be appropriate.

40|$|<b>Apalcillin</b> {{is a new}} semisynthetic {{penicillin}} used as a sodium salt. More than 4, 000 {{patients have}} been treated with this antibiotic, but increased serum creatinine levels were noted in 18 cases. In 5 of these cases, <b>apalcillin</b> was possibly responsible, and in 13 it was doubtful. We decided to study renal function of normal volunteers treated with 4 g of <b>apalcillin.</b> Three periods were studied: a pretreatment control period of 80 min followed by a treatment period of 60 min and a posttreatment period of 40 min. Inulin and p-aminohippurate (PAH) infusion were continued during all three periods. At {{the beginning of the}} treatment period, 2 g of <b>apalcillin</b> was injected as a bolus, followed by infusion of 2 g of <b>apalcillin</b> over 1 h. Urinary volume was measured every 20 min. Creatinine, insulin, and PAH clearances and urinary excretion of sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium were calculated for each period. Urinary beta- 2 -microglobulin excretion was also assessed. Analysis of variance was done. We observed no variation in clearances of creatinine or inulin or in urinary electrolyte output.

40|$|The {{intrinsic}} {{mechanisms of}} resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics in Serratia marcescens IFO 12648 were investigated, comparing the action of benzylpenicillin, <b>apalcillin,</b> cefazolin, and ceftizoxime. The minimal inhibitory concentrations for this strain were 1, 600, 3. 13, 6, 400, and 0. 05 microgram/ml, respectively. The addition of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid markedly reduced the minimal inhibitory concentrations of benzylpenicillin and cefazolin, whereas those of <b>apalcillin</b> and ceftizoxime were not influenced. S. marcescens IFO 12648 produced only {{a low level of}} beta-lactamase activity constitutively, and the production was considerably increased by the addition of benzylpenicillin. Cefazolin was hydrolyzed rapidly by beta-lactamase activity, whereas benzylpenicillin, <b>apalcillin,</b> and ceftizoxime were poorly hydrolyzed. Peptidoglycan synthesis in ether-treated strain IFO 12646 cells was inhibited by a concentration of ceftizoxime markedly lower than that of cefazolin and by a concentration of <b>apalcillin</b> moderately lower than that of benzylpenicillin...|$|E

40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{activities}} of cefpiramide and <b>apalcillin</b> {{were compared with}} those of other third-generation cephalosporins and extended-spectrum penicillins against over 1, 000 clinical bacterial isolates. The activity of cefpiramide against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was comparable to those of piperacillin and cefoperazone, inhibiting 90 % of strains at concentrations {{less than or equal to}} 16. 0 micrograms/ml. This drug was also active against a broad range of gram-negative organisms but was generally less active than many of the other cephalosporins tested against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. The activity of cefpiramide against gram-positive organisms was comparable to that of cefoperazone. <b>Apalcillin,</b> along with ceftazidime, was the most active agent tested against P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus subsp. anitratus, inhibiting 90 % of these strains at concentrations less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. Against other gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, its activity was similar to that of piperacillin. The activities of both cefpiramide and <b>apalcillin</b> were significantly reduced by the presence of several plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases in a series of otherwise isogenic strains of P. aeruginosa in comparison with their activities against a parent strain which lacks these enzymes. Many strains of Enterobacter cloacae were synergistically inhibited by the combination of gentamicin with either cefpiramide (5 of 10 strains) or <b>apalcillin</b> (6 of 10 strains). Most strains of P. aeruginosa were synergistically inhibited by the combination of gentamicin with either cefpiramide (8 of 10 strains) or <b>apalcillin</b> (10 of 10 strains). However, cefoxitin antagonized the activity of both cefpiramide and <b>apalcillin</b> against most of these same strains...|$|E

40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{synergistic}} {{activities of the}} beta-lactamase inhibitors YTR 830, clavulanate, and sulbactam, combined with ampicillin, ticarcillin, mezlocillin, azlocillin, piperacillin, and <b>apalcillin,</b> were determined against 34 strains {{of members of the}} Enterobacteriaceae family, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aeromonas hydrophila, and Haemophilus influenzae with characterized plasmid or chromosomal beta-lactamases or both. Strains were tested against fixed concentrations of beta-lactamase inhibitors (8 micrograms/ml) combined with doubling dilutions of beta-lactams. Synergy was defined as a fourfold or greater decrease in the MIC of the beta-lactam. Against Enterobacteriaceae producing Richmond and Sykes class III and V plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, synergy was obtained against most strains with YTR 830 - and clavulanate-beta-lactam combinations, with sulbactam being less effective. Against Enterobacteriaceae producing class I chromosomal beta-lactamases, combinations containing YTR 830 or sulbactam were more synergistic than combinations containing clavulanate. Against strains producing class V PSE enzymes, all three inhibitors were synergistic with piperacillin and <b>apalcillin</b> against strains producing PSE- 1, - 3, and - 4 enzymes, while the PSE- 2 -producing strain was resistant to all inhibitors. YTR 830 -beta-lactam combinations were also synergistic against strains producing the novel beta-lactamases OHIO- 1, TLE- 1, AER- 1, and ROB- 1.

40|$|ObjectiveThe {{in vitro}} {{activity}} of <b>apalcillin</b> plus Ro 48 - 1220, a novel penam sulfone β-lactamase inhibitor, was compared with <b>apalcillin</b> alone, piperacillin/tazobactam, ticarcillin/clavulanic acid, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, imipenem, ceftazidime and cefepime. MethodsAgar dilution and broth microdilution testing of 854 bacterial strains, subcultured from frozen stocks incubated for 24 h in 5 % carbon dioxide, {{was carried out}} to determine the minimum bactericidal (MBC) and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) {{of each of the}} study drugs in accordance with the NCCLS M 26 -T method. ResultsApalcillin/Ro 48 - 1220 was active against all gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic isolates except Klebsiella oxytoca (MIC 90 32 μg/mL). Among the Enterobacteriaceae, synergy for apalcillin/Ro 48 - 1220 (4 μg/mL fixed concentration) vs <b>apalcillin</b> alone was demonstrated for nearly all species when comparing MIC 90 results. Apalcillin/Ro 48 - 1220 was highly potent against β-lactamase-producing Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MICs ≤ 1 μg/mL). However, much of this activity was due to the direct antimicrobial action of Ro 48 - 1220 alone (MICs ≤ 4 μg/mL). All Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas (Xanthomonas) maltophilia and Acinetobacter species were inhibited by apalcillin/Ro 48 - 1220 (MIC 90 0. 25 to 4 μg/mL). For the aerobic gram-positive organisms, none of the drugs tested were consistently effective against oxacillin-resistant staphylococci, Corynebacterium jeikeium and Enterococcus species other than E. faecalis. Apalcillin/Ro 48 - 1220 was as effective as piperacillin/tazobactam against Escherichia coli producing extended-spectrum TEM enzymes, but less active against isolates producing SHV-type β-lactamases. When tested against 204 ceftazidime-, gentamicin- or fluoroquinolone-resistant organisms, 78 %, 91 % and 66 % of strains, respectively, were susceptible to apalcillin/Ro 48 - 1220 (≤ 16 μg/mL). ConclusionsApalcillin/Ro 48 - 1220 is bactericidal with a modest inoculum effect; its wide spectrum of activity favors continued studies of spectrum, pharmacokinetics and in vivo efficacy...|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} {{two methods}} for the quantitative analysis of <b>apalcillin</b> and its metabolites in serum and urine by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), a fast isocratic method {{for the parent}} drug, and a gradient method that allows the simultaneous assay of two metabolites. Serum was deproteinized with acetonitrile, and urine was diluted with buffer solution. The detection limit was about 0. 5 micrograms/ml at a detection wavelength of 254 nm and 1. 5 micrograms/ml at 310 nm. Within-batch precision (coefficient of variation) varied from 10. 2 to 1. 1 % for concentrations of 7. 8 and 185. 3 micrograms/ml of serum, respectively. Recovery rates of 95. 1 and 97. 7 % were found in spiked sera. Results obtained by HPLC correlated well with those from a standard microbiological assay (agar diffusion test); the resulting bivariate regression equation for serum was y-bioassay = 2. 5 micrograms/ml + 0. 992 X xHPLC, and that for urine was ybioassay = 12. 0 micrograms/ml + 1. 009 X xHPLC. At a detection wavelength of 315 nm, no interferences were observed in 10 healthy volunteers. Healthy subjects who were given 2 g of <b>apalcillin</b> intravenously excreted 18 % of the parent drug within 24 h in the urine.

40|$|<b>Apalcillin</b> (PC- 904) {{is active}} against carbenicillin- and ampicillin-{{resistant}} strains of gram-negative bacilli. Among Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains highly resistant to carbenicillin (≥ 3, 200 μg/ml), {{half of them}} were susceptible to PC- 904 at a concentration of 50 to 1, 600 μg/ml. The minimal inhibitory concentration of PC- 904 against P. aeruginosa strains resistant to carbenicillin (400 to 1, 600 μg/ml) ranged from 3. 1 to 25 μg/ml. Ampicillin- and carbenicillin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae strains were similarly susceptible to PC- 904. However, drug resistance to PC- 904 was already apparent among some strains of P. aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, and P. morganii, recently isolated in Japan; i. e., 4, 35, 32, 4, 6, and 14 % of strains isolated were resistant. PC- 904 was more active, on the other hand, than ampicillin and carbenicillin against antibiotic-susceptible Enterobacteriaceae and also showed high activity against most species of Pseudomonadaceae, especially P. cepacia and P. aeruginosa.

40|$|Contraluminal organic anion and cation {{transport}} in {{the proximal}} renal tubule: V. Interaction with sulfamoyl- and phenoxy diuretics, and with β-lactam antibiotics. In order {{to study the}} interaction of sulfamoyl- and phenoxy diuretics {{as well as of}} β-lactam antibiotics with the contraluminal anion and cation transport systems the inhibitory potency of these substances against the influx of 3 H-para-aminohippurate, 14 C-succinate, 35 S-sulfate and 3 H-Nl-methylnicotinamide into cortical tubular cells have been determined. 1.) 2 -, 3 - and 4 -sulfamoylbenzoate inhibit contraluminal PAH influx. N-dipropyl substitution to yield probenecid or ring-substitution to yield furosemide and piretanide augment the inhibitory potency. However, hydrochlorothiazide and acetazolamide exert only a moderate inhibitory potency. Succinate transport was inhibited by furosemide only. Sulfate transport was inhibited by furosemide and 3 -sulfamoyl- 4 -phenoxybenzoate as well as by probenecid, piretanide, hydrochlorothiazide and acetazolamide. 2.) Phenoxy acetate, -propionate, and -butyrate exert increasing inhibition against PAH transport. The weed-killers 2, 4 -dichloro-, and 2, 4, 5 -trichlorophenoxyacetate (2, 4 D and 2, 4, 5 T) had a similar inhibitory potency, while ethacrynic acid showed a lower and the uricosuric tienilic acid a higher inhibitory potency. None of the compounds of this group interact with contraluminal succinate transport, and only the multiring-substituted compounds 2, 4 D, 2, 4, 5 T, ethacrynic and tienilic acid interact slightly with the sulfate transporter. 3.) The monocarboxy-lic penicillins benzylpenicillin and phenoxymethylpenicillin as well as the dicarboxylic ticarcillin interact with the contraluminal PAH transport. The aminopenicillin ampicillin had a lower, and <b>apalcillin</b> a higher inhibitory potency than monocarboxylic penicillin. Benzylpenicillin showed small inhibition against succinate transport and ticarcillin against sulfate transport. 4.)
