I tried to make believable, reasonable characters, and Stuart would insist on throwing in clichés and caricatures.

25|$|In November 2002, {{the book}} “Victoria, Victoria!” came out, {{speaking}} further about her eating disorder. Victoria said: “I {{felt like an}} accelerating train, going right down... during the whole period. I had eating disorders and was aware of it, my anguish was enormous. I really hated how I looked like, how I was... I, Victoria, didn’t exist. It felt like everything {{in my life and}} around me was controlled by others. The one thing I could control was the food I put in me”. She further said that “What happened cost <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> one who stood for the payments. Now I’m feeling well and with the insights I’ve acquired through this I can hopefully help someone else”.|$|E

But you try to be a non-combat troop in a combat area – that is the toughest kind of assignment.|$|E

25|$|During June 1990, Graney, Hayward and Moore {{travelled}} to London {{and recorded}} I Was the Hunter... <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>Was</b> <b>the</b> Prey with Blair on bass guitar, Ross on guitar, and Vause on piano. The album {{was produced by}} Vinall at a Croydon home studio run by former Procol Harum organist Matthew Fisher. The cover by Western shows Graney with full 'Hickock' curled moustache and velvet pomp. It was not issued until May 1992, due to problems with the label, under the name Dave Graney with the Coral Snakes. In mid-1991, the band had moved back to Melbourne with a line-up of Blair, Graney, Moore, and Hayward; with Robin Casinader on keyboards (ex-the Wreckery). In July 1992, they released a live album, Lure of the Tropics on the Torn & Frayed label on Shock Records. It was recorded at St Kilda's Prince of Wales Hotel. A week earlier the group had performed their Little Big Horn Show and first presented the title track. The cover art was by Mahony, the album featured three other improvised tracks and was originally mixed by Phil McKellar – it was re-released in 1997 with extra tracks and remixed by Tony Cohen.|$|E

[...] Joseph Mazzello had initially screen-tested for a role in Hook, but was deemed too young. Spielberg promised Mazzello that they would work together on a future film. Robin Wright turned down a role in the film. Christina Ricci auditioned for a role, but did not receive it.|$|E
500|$|In 1979, Gray {{spoke with}} TV Guide (Canada) and recounted: [...] "At first, {{they had no}} idea what to do with the part. Sue Ellen's lines ran to 'More coffee, darling?' and 'I have a headache.' Victoria Principal and Patrick Duffy were the goody-goodies. Jim Davis and Barbara Bel Geddes were parental. Hagman was the villain. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> redhead on the couch." [...] However, Gray was {{upgraded}} to a starring role once Dallas was picked up for a full season following the five episode arc miniseries. The actress later stated that on-screen husband Larry Hagman had criticized one of her performances early on during the start of the series, and called it [...] "terrible", though he denied it. She joked, [...] "I'm sorry. He said it to me loud and clear, and made me feel terrible, and it started one of our first fights on the way back [...] I swear to you—he devastated me. Then, years later, he said, 'Oh, I didn't mean that.' I could have killed him!" ...|$|E
500|$|Racism also shaped {{his lifelong}} {{paradigm}} {{as a team}} player. [...] "At that time", he has said, [...] "it was never acceptable that a black player was the best. That did not happen... My junior year in college, I had what I thought was {{the one of the}} best college seasons ever. We won 28 out of 29 games. We won the National Championship. I was the [...] at the Final Four. I was first team All American. I averaged over 20 points and over 20 rebounds, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> only guy in college blocking shots. So after the season was over, they had a Northern California banquet, and they picked another center as Player of the Year in Northern California. Well, that let me know that if I were to accept these as the final judges of my career I would die a bitter old man." [...] So he made a conscious decision, he said, to put the team first and foremost, and not worry about individual achievements.|$|E

2500|$|The Phoenix Suns with {{point guard}} Steve Nash were a running team under Mike D'Antoni, and The New York Times called them [...] "this decade’s {{incarnation}} of the Los Angeles Lakers’ Showtime".
