5|$|On 15 February 2002, {{while at}} Speakers' Corner, Singapore Democratic Party chief Chee Soon Juan {{attacked}} the Government's decision to suspend four Muslim girls for wearing the tudung (Islamic headscarf) to public schools. Contrary to police advice, {{he chose not}} to apply for a public entertainment licence, arguing he did not need one. Chee's speech sparked heated exchanges involving the Sikh practice of wearing turbans. In July, Chee was convicted and fined S$3,000 for speaking without the required licence. In his judgment, District Judge Kow Keng Siong emphasized the twin considerations of public order and national security in multi-racial and multi-religious Singapore, finding that Chee's speech had bred social unrest. Under the Constitution of Singapore, <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> been fined at least $2,000 cannot stand for election to Parliament for five years. As a result of the incident, Chee was barred from contesting the 2006 general elections.|$|E
