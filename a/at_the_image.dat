5|$|When {{you think}} about Goya, who painted the most horrendous {{pictures}} of violence and torture and so forth, and they're amazing, exquisite paintings, {{one of the reasons}} they're such wonderful paintings is because what he's saying is, 'Look– look at this.' So if you paint it badly or put it in the sort of wrong perspective, you draw more attention to what's wrong with the image rather than looking <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>image.</b>|$|E

25|$|Optical {{character}} recognition (OCR) {{is preferable to}} rekeying for converting existing text that is already written down but not in machine-readable format (for example, a Linotype-composed book from the 1940s). In other words, to convert the text from an image to editable text (that is, a string of character codes), a person could re-type it, or a computer could look <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> and deduce what each character is. OCR technology has already reached an impressive state (for example, Google Book Search) and promises more for the future.|$|E
25|$|With {{the growth}} of monumental panel {{painting}} in Italy during the 12th and 13th centuries, this type was frequently painted <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> of the Madonna gains prominence outside of Rome, especially throughout Tuscany. While members of the mendicant orders of the Franciscan and Dominican Orders {{are some of the}} first to commission panels representing this subject matter, such works quickly became popular in monasteries, parish churches, and later homes. Some images of the Madonna were paid for by lay organizations called confraternities, who met to sing praises of the Virgin in chapels found within the newly reconstructed, spacious churches that were sometimes dedicated to her.|$|E

25|$|During World War II, the US Navy {{required}} a weapon effective against surface ships, {{such as the}} German Bismarck class battleships. Although missile and TV technology existed, {{the size of the}} primitive guidance systems available rendered automatic guidance impractical. To solve this problem, Skinner initiated Project Pigeon, which was intended to provide a simple and effective guidance system. This system divided the nose cone of a missile into three compartments, with a pigeon placed in each. Lenses projected an image of distant objects onto a screen in front of each bird. Thus, when the missile was launched from an aircraft within sight of an enemy ship, an image of the ship would appear on the screen. The screen was hinged, such that pecks <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> of the ship would guide the missile toward the ship.|$|E
25|$|In {{this system}} a {{filament}} {{is located at}} one focus of an ellipsoidal reflector and has a condenser lens {{at the front of}} the lamp. A shade is located <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> plane, between the reflector and lens, and the projection of the top edge of this shade provides the low-beam cutoff. The shape of the shade edge and its exact position in the optical system determine the shape and sharpness of the cutoff. The shade may be lowered by a solenoid actuated pivot to provide low beam, and removed from the light path for high beam. Such optics are known as BiXenon or BiHalogen projectors. If the cutoff shade is fixed in the light path, separate high-beam lamps are required. The condenser lens may have slight fresnel rings or other surface treatments to reduce cutoff sharpness. Modern condenser lenses incorporate optical features specifically designed to direct some light upward towards the locations of retroreflective overhead road signs.|$|E

500|$|Another {{recurring}} {{element in}} Lynch's films is his experimentation with sound. He stated in an interview, [...] "you look <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> {{and the scene}} silent, it's doing the job it's supposed to do, but the work isn't done. When you start working on the sound, keep working until it feels correct. There's so many wrong sounds and instantly you know it. Sometimes it's really magical." [...] In the opening scene of the film, as the dark-haired woman stumbles off Mulholland Drive, silently it suggests she is clumsy. After Lynch added [...] "a hint of the steam [...] and the screaming kids", however, it transformed Laura Elena Harring from clumsy to terrified. Lynch also infused subtle rumblings throughout portions of the film that reviewers noted added unsettling and creepy effects. Hageman also identifies [...] "perpetual and uncanny ambient sound", and places a particular emphasis on the scene where the man collapses behind Winkie's as normal sound is drowned out by a buzzing roar, noting that the noise [...] "creates a dissonance and suspense that draws in the spectator as detective to place the sound and reestablish order". Mulholland Drives ending with the woman at Club Silencio whispering {{is an example of}} Lynch's aural deception and surreality, according to Ruth Perlmutter, who writes, [...] "The acting, the dreams, the search for identity, the fears and terrors of the undefined self are over when the film is over, and therefore, there is only silence and enigma." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{unwanted}} frequency {{is called}} {{the image of the}} wanted frequency, because it is the [...] "mirror image" [...] of the desired frequency reflected [...] A receiver with inadequate filtering at its input will pick up signals at two different frequencies simultaneously: the desired frequency and the image frequency. Any noise or random radio station <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> frequency can interfere with reception of the desired signal.|$|E
2500|$|In optics, an {{aperture}} is a hole or {{an opening}} through which light travels. [...] More specifically, the aperture and focal length of an optical system determine the cone angle of {{a bundle of}} rays that come to a focus in the image plane. The aperture determines how collimated the admitted rays are, which is of great importance for the appearance <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> plane. [...] If an aperture is narrow, then highly collimated rays are admitted, resulting in a sharp focus <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> plane. [...] A wide aperture admits uncollimated rays, resulting in a sharp focus only for rays coming from a certain distance. [...] This means that a wide aperture results in an image that is sharp for things at the correct distance. The aperture also determines {{how many of the}} incoming rays are actually admitted and thus how much light reaches the image plane (the narrower the aperture, the darker the image for a given exposure time). In the human eye, the pupil is the aperture.|$|E

2500|$|An {{optical system}} {{typically}} has many openings or structures that limit the ray bundles (ray bundles are {{also known as}} pencils of light). [...] These structures may be {{the edge of a}} lens or mirror, or a ring or other fixture that holds an optical element in place, or may be a special element such as a diaphragm placed in the optical path [...] to limit the light admitted by the system. [...] In general, these structures are called stops, and the aperture stop is the stop that primarily determines the ray cone angle and brightness <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> point.|$|E
2500|$|The Catholic defense {{mentions}} textual {{evidence of}} external acts of honor towards icons, arguing {{that there are}} [...] "different kinds of worship" [...] and that the honor shown to icons differs entirely from the adoration of God. Citing the Old Testament, these arguments present examples of forms of [...] "honor" [...] such as in Genesis 33:3, with the argument that [...] "adoration is one thing, and that which is offered in order to honor something of great excellence is another". These arguments assert, [...] "the honor given to the image is transferred to its prototype", and that venerating an image of Christ does not terminate <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> itself– the material of the image is not the object of worship– rather it goes beyond the image, to the prototype.|$|E
2500|$|In 1969, artist Morris {{and writer}} René Goscinny (co-creator of Asterix) had Lucky Luke confronting Jesse James, his brother Frank, and Cole Younger.

Although he passes himself off as such and does indeed steal from the rich (who are, logically, the only ones worth stealing from), he and his gang take turns being [...] "poor," [...] thus keeping the loot for themselves. Frank quotes from Shakespeare, and Younger is portrayed as a fun-loving joker, full of good humor. One critic has likened {{this version of the}} James brothers as [...] "intellectuals bandits, who won't stop theorising their outlaw activities and hear themselves talk." [...] In the end, the at-first-cowed people of a town fight back against the James gang and send them packing in tar and feathers.|$|E

2500|$|The {{style of}} worship at Saint Thomas Church has varied greatly over {{the history of}} the parish. [...] Beginning with the rectorship of John Andrew in 1972, however, it has {{followed}} the Anglo-Catholic or High Church tradition within the Episcopal Church that developed out of the Oxford Movement. This was further developed under the rectorship of Andrew Mead. [...] Sunday services include Low Mass, High Mass, and Evensong, and Solemn Mass on Christmas, Easter and major feast days. [...] Special liturgies and processions are held for Advent, Epiphany, Candlemas and Holy Week. [...] The Litany is sung in procession in Advent and Lent. [...] The choir of men and boys sing most Sundays in term time and, if there are no visiting choirs during the school vacation, the gentlemen of the choir sing the services. [...] The Church uses traditional language on Sundays and for most of its weekday services and the King James Version of the Bible is used on Sundays and at Evensong during the week. [...] Rite II of the BCP1979 is used for the 12.10pm mass Mondays to Fridays. [...] In Lent 2015 Shrine Prayers were started <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> of Our Lady of Fifth Avenue and intercessions are offered at 12noon after the Angelus Mondays to Fridays; these intercessions may be left in the Church or submitted online via the Church website.
