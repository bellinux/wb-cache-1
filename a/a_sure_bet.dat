2500|$|GameSpot's Mathew Gallant scored it 7.6 out of 10, {{calling it}} [...] "an often {{surprising}} action-packed platformer with a distinctive style {{and plenty of}} challenge." [...] He was critical of Haven's mag-ball weapon, writing [...] "the jumping and other mechanics of Haven are solid, but {{the limitations of the}} mag-ball and the fairly frequent requirements of its use tend to overshadow them." [...] He concluded [...] "While Haven does offer a lot, it's not quite <b>a</b> <b>sure</b> <b>bet.</b> Primarily, the annoying control problems involved with the mag-ball can make an already difficult game needlessly frustrating [...] Yet the overall feel is that of a very intense and action-packed game. The fast-paced, quickly changing gameplay is refreshingly unordinary, and while there's an excellent chance that fans of platformers will love the diversity and challenge, some may find it a little too restless and overdone." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bukowski died {{of leukemia}} on March 9, 1994, in San Pedro, aged 73, shortly after {{completing}} his last novel, Pulp. The funeral rites, orchestrated by his widow, {{were conducted by}} Buddhist monks. He is interred at Green Hills Memorial Park in Rancho Palos Verdes. An account of the proceedings {{can be found in}} Gerald Locklin's book Charles Bukowski: <b>A</b> <b>Sure</b> <b>Bet.</b> His gravestone reads: [...] "Don't Try", a phrase which Bukowski uses in one of his poems, advising aspiring writers and poets about inspiration and creativity. Bukowski explained the phrase in a 1963 letter to John William Corrington: [...] "Somebody at one of these places [...] asked me: 'What do you do? How do you write, create?' You don't, I told them. You don't try. That's very important: not to try, either for Cadillacs, creation or immortality. You wait, and if nothing happens, you wait some more. It's like a bug high on the wall. You wait for it to come to you. When it gets close enough you reach out, slap out and kill it. Or if you like its looks you make a pet out of it." [...] Bukowski was an atheist.|$|E

40|$|In {{settings}} such as investing {{for retirement}} or choosing a drug plan, individuals face a staggering number of options. In this paper, we analyze how {{an abundance of}} options influences which alternative is selected. We present both laboratory experiments and field data that confirm our theoretical prediction: larger choice sets induce a stronger preference for simple, easy-to-understand options. The first experiment demonstrates that, in seeming violation of the weak axiom of revealed preference, subjects {{are more likely to}} select <b>a</b> given <b>sure</b> <b>bet</b> over non-degenerate gambles when choosing from a set of 11 options than when choosing from a subset of 3. The second experiment clarifies that excessive choice sets induce a preference for simpler, rather than less risky, options. Lastly, using records of more than 500, 000 employees from 638 institutions, we demonstrate that the presence of more funds in an individualâ€™s 401 (k) plan is associated with a greater allocation to money market and bond funds at the expense of equity funds. 2 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{degree of}} incoherence, when previsions {{are not made}} in {{accordance}} with a probability measure, {{is measured by the}} rate at which an incoherent bookie can be made <b>a</b> <b>sure</b> loser. Each <b>bet</b> is rescaled by one of several normalizations to account for the overall sizes of bets.

40|$|The {{degree of}} incoherence, when previsions {{are not made}} in {{accordance}} with a probability measure, is measured by either of two rates at which an incoherent bookie can be made <b>a</b> <b>sure</b> loser. Each <b>bet</b> is considered as an investment from the points of view of both the bookie and a gambler who takes the bet. From each viewpoint, we define an amount invested (or escrowed) for each <b>bet,</b> and the <b>sure</b> loss of incoherent previsions is divided by the escrow to determine the rate of incoherence. Potential applications include the treatment of arbitrage opportunities in financial markets {{and the degree of}} incoherence of classical statistical procedures. We illustrate the latter with the example of hypothesis testing at a fixed size...|$|R

He was in love with my sister Nell. She hated him. He followed us out West and he has hung on our actions like a sneaking Indian. Why, Nell and I couldn't even walk to the store in the village.

40|$|Adolescents {{often make}} risky and {{impulsive}} decisions. Such behavior {{has led to}} the common assumption that a dysfunction in risk-related decision-making peaks during this age. Differences in how risk has been defined across studies, however, make it difficult to draw conclusions about developmental changes in risky decision-making. Here, we developed a non-symbolic economic decision-making task that can be used across a wide age span and that uses coefficient of variation (CV) in reward as an index of risk. We found that young children showed the strongest preference for risky compared to <b>sure</b> <b>bet</b> options of equal expected value, adolescents were intermediate in their risk preference, and young adults showed the strongest risk aversion. Furthermore, childrenâ€™s preference for the risky option increased for larger CVs, while adolescents and young adults showed the opposite pattern, favoring the <b>sure</b> <b>bet</b> more often as CV increased. Finally, when faced with two gambles in a risk-return tradeoff, all three age groups exhibited a greater preference for the option with the lower risk and return as the disparity in risk between the two options increased. These findings demonstrate clear age-related differences in economic risk preferences that vary with choice set and risk. Importantly, adolescence appears to represent an intermediate decision-making phenotype along the transition from childhood to adulthood, rather than an age of heightened preference for economic risk...|$|R

40|$|Ambiguity, {{as opposed}} to uncertainty, {{reflects}} lack of sufficient information about distribution and payoffs of infrequent events. Reforms are infrequent events, undertaken in ambiguous second-best environments where bad reform outcomes are feasible.
