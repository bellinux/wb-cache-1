In an interview the following year, Miller noted that [...] "Your characters will often assert themselves, and remind you who they really are. In 'Grey Matters' there's <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>where</b> pre-madness Walter wakes up in the chair — that beat emerged on the page. We {{had no idea it}} was going to be in the script until we were writing the scene. As a writer, you live for that." ...|$|E
500|$|Regarding {{the sound}} of Frozen, {{director}} Jennifer Lee stated that sound played a huge part in making the film [...] "visceral" [...] and [...] "transported"; she explained, [...] "n letting it tell the story emotionally, {{the sound of}} the ice when it's at its most dangerous just makes you shudder." [...] The complete silence at the climax of the film right after Anna freezes was Lasseter's idea, one he [...] "really wanted". In that scene, even the ambient sound that would normally be there was taken out {{in order to make it}} feel unusual. Lee explained [...] "that was <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>where</b> we wanted everything to feel suspended." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Shonda Rhimes, and {{directed}} by Rob Corn. Featured music included The Paper Kites' [...] "Featherstone" [...] and Feist's 'Graveyard". Filming took place in Big Bear Lake, California, a location previously used in the seventh season for Yang and Shepherd's fishing trip. Commenting on the filming conditions, Leigh said: [...] "It would rain and be sunny and hot. I never died before [...] That sounds funny saying that. I think everyone has an emotional wellspring and that happened to be <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>where</b> I was sprung. Everybody was very accommodating — the crew, cast. And I opted to stay underneath [...] {{for the most part}} over two days rather than trying to get in and out." ...|$|E

500|$|Scott Esposito of webzine PopMatters {{gave the}} novel mixed comments, writing, [...] "it is no {{surprise}} that Apex Hides the Hurt, Whitehead's third novel, is packed with a number of allegorical elements blended into a multi-layered structure. What's unfortunate, however, is that all this technical artistry is in the service of unremarkable themes and ideas." [...] Entertainment website The A.V. Club complimented the book, writing, [...] "perhaps taking his cues from his protagonist's profession, Whitehead keeps his prose as streamlined as it comes, and he uses it to craft a satiric novel in tune with <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>where</b> marketing overshadows content and even the lowliest blogger thinks in branding terms." [...] Michael McGirr of The Sydney Morning Herald called it [...] "a book of abundant irony".|$|E
500|$|I {{would say}} it was a directorial {{collaborative}} effort. We went to the rainforest and that was interesting. Part of the reason was [...] I love Puerto Rico one of my favorite places ever and I did one of my favorite videos, 'Honey', in Puerto Rico at the El Conquistador hotel. I was involved every step of the way... I like a lot of the shots in the video... There was <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>where</b> I had to do an additional water sequence with no director, just myself and a camera man with an underwater camera. I was looking at the take at 5 in the morning, [...] ready to kill me. But if we didn't have those shots there wouldn't be anything to cut away to, except me.|$|E
500|$|Breeds {{acknowledged}} {{that from a}} musical stand point someone who inspires you creatively and acts as your muse, is a special bond. She attributed it to Liam's feelings for Ruby. Ruby and Liam continue to act a support unit for one another. As the scholarship develops they {{talk to each other}} about [...] "mature things that surpass a student-teacher relationship." [...] Liam later develops feelings for Bianca Scott (Lisa Gormley) and Ruby is seeing Liam slip from her grasp. Breeds said [...] "She sees them flirting and she has <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>where</b> she realises that she's so in love with this guy and it's kind of now or never. She needs to take action." [...] True to Ruby's persona she does not preconceive her actions and Ruby feels she has to [...] "set the record straight and to give it a really good crack." [...] For Ruby it is a spontaneous, impromptu moment; [...] "She's just totally spilling out with feelings for him." ...|$|E

[...] Joe Russo added, [...] "You build things up and people enjoy the experiences you've built up. But then you kind of reach an apex or you reach a climax, <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>where</b> you go, 'This structure is really going to start to be repetitious if we do this again, so what do we do now?' So now, you deconstruct it. We're in the deconstruction phase with [...] and leading into , which are the culmination films." [...] A year later, Feige felt after the conclusion of Phase Three, Marvel might abandon grouping the films by phases, saying, [...] "it might be a new thing." ...|$|E
500|$|As Glitter was an {{unsuccessful}} mixture of covers and dance music, Charmbracelet incorporated slower, contemporary melodies. In {{his review of}} the album, Stephen Thomas Erlewine criticized the album's content, describing Carey's voice as [...] "in tatters". He wrote, [...] "Whenever she sings, there's a raspy whistle behind her thin voice and she strains to make notes throughout the record. She cannot coo or softly croon, nor can she perform her trademark gravity-defying vocal runs. Her voice is damaged, and there's not <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>where</b> it sounds strong or inviting." [...] Though fueled by strong media attention regarding Carey's return to music, {{as well as her}} new deal with Island Records, the album failed to deliver the type of success she had been accustomed to throughout the 1990s, and only managed sales of five million copies globally. After the album's release, and its succeeding tour, Carey began conceptualizing and working on a new project, eventually titled The Emancipation of Mimi, her tenth studio effort. By November2004, Carey had already recorded several songs for the album.|$|E

Barber was appearing in a small guest role in fellow Australian soap opera Home and Away when {{he was given the}} role of Rhys. He began filming his first scenes for Neighbours opposite Alan Fletcher (Karl Kennedy) and Jackie Woodburne (Susan Kennedy) the week before his casting announcement. Of appearing in Neighbours, the actor told Matt Neal of The Warrnambool Standard [...] "I catch myself and have <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>where</b> I realise that I'm working with actors I watched on TV growing up. My first scenes were with Alan and Jackie. It was great to have them there to help out and show me how it's done. I was in safe hands." [...] Barber revealed he loved his character and was looking forward to what was ahead. He made his first on screen appearance as Rhys in July 2011.|$|E

500|$|Some critics {{had similar}} {{opinions}} about the song's meaning. Lauren Down of The Guardian expressed that [...] "Wrapped up {{in the aftermath of}} a relationship, 'Out Of Mind' [...] allows the pain of an ending love affair to breath". Mark Savage of BBC wrote that an indifferent person tells the singer that [...] "time will heal her broken heart". According to Andrew Hampp of Billboard, the singer [...] "tells off" [...] a former boyfriend for expecting her to get over quickly their former relationship. Sam Lansky of Idolator felt that the artist shows [...] "frustrated resignation" [...] while she sings the line [...] "I'll forget you, seriously". In the pre-chorus, the music vanishes and she sings [...] "Are you kidding me?". Lansky felt that the [...] "emotion" [...] on the pre-chorus was [...] "chill-inducing", while Savage wrote that [...] "it's pained and bruised and thrilling and glorious. <b>A</b> <b>moment</b> <b>where</b> meaning and musical intent align perfectly". In the chorus, the singer repeats the line [...] "You're out of your mind to think that I" [...] and later finishes it with ...|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, Charmbracelet was {{released}} to nearly negative critical reception. Aggregator website Metacritic, which averages professional reviews into a numerical score, gave Charmbracelet {{a score of}} 43/100, indicating [...] "mixed or average reviews". Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic rated the album two out of five stars, and criticized its production and the condition of Carey's voice. He wrote, [...] "Whenever she sings, there's a raspy whistle behind her thin voice and she strains to make notes throughout the record...Her voice is damaged, and there's not <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>where</b> it sounds strong or inviting." [...] Tom Sinclair of [...] Entertainment Weekly said she was [...] "in fine voice". He wrote that [...] "Through the Rain" [...] sinks in its own sodden sentimentality, as do by-the-numbers efforts like 'Yours' and 'I Only Wanted'", and added that [...] "Clown' is a moody number graced with mournful acoustic guitar and a gorgeously nuanced vocal, while 'Sunflowers for Alfred Roy' is a short, sweet song sung to a lovely piano accompaniment". He finished by saying that [...] "too much of Charmbracelet is mired in middle-of-the-road muck." ...|$|E
500|$|The EBP {{revealed}} {{that it was}} not surprised by the election of Barack Obama as president of the United States, expressing its belief that it came at <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>where</b> the military industrial complex [...] "needed a charismatic figure to replace [...] Bush, whose poor public perception [...] of the economy had endangered the system". The organization expressed that this pattern where a staunch conservative was replaced by a conciliatory liberal had been seen in American politics throughout {{the second half of the}} 20th century, and that they did [...] "not expect a radical change in politics towards Latin America under Obama". The Macheteros cited that the president backtracked his initial condemnation of the 2009 Honduran coup d'état, the proliferation of American military bases in Colombia and constant confrontations between his administration and Hugo Chávez as supporting evidence for this statement. The EBP further emphasized that the absence of concrete movements to lift the United States embargo against Cuba as a sign that Obama was [...] "more of the same".|$|E

500|$|As {{the seasons}} progressed, and the {{character}} began to grow darker and more sinister, Rosenbaum sought more opportunities to bring humor to the scene, either with physical subtleties like little smiles at key moments, or [...] "self-deprecating humor". One such instance, which became popular with audiences, was in the season six episode [...] "Justice", where Lex made a joke about wanting a ponytail. The producers were concerned over the piece of dialogue, but Rosenbaum convinced them that he could pull it off. To Rosenbaum, this quip by Lex makes him more credible as a person, because {{it is well known}} that Lex always wanted hair. This moment reflects an earlier episode, where Lex reveals his feelings of meagerness when comparing himself to Clark. In season five's [...] "Lockdown", Lex provides a window into his thoughts about his place in Smallville. As writer Steven S. DeKnight describes it, the audience gets to see <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>where</b> Lex shows how he still feels like an outsider, and that he views Clark as this [...] "perfect person". DeKnight believes that, from how Clark sees it, Lex is driven by his desire to attain everything that Clark has, like his family and girlfriend.|$|E
500|$|When Mendelsohn {{was giving}} a talk, she accidentally {{mentioned}} the crossover, as a result Variety was already inquiring about the crossover episodes [...] that same day. Mendelsohn eventually revealed the crossover at the Banff event in Canada. After the episode was taped, Lorre stated: [...] "The biggest challenge for us was doing a comedy with a murder in it. Generally our stories are a little lighter. Would our audience go with a dead body in it? There was <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>where</b> it could have gone either way. I think the results were spectacular. It {{turned out to be}} a really funny episode." [...] "Fish in a Drawer" [...] was written by Carol Mendelsohn and Naren Shankar and directed by Jeff Melman. As an inside joke, George Eads, who plays crime scene investigator Nick Stokes on CSI made a cameo as a guest at the wedding reception. Three days after the initial airing of [...] "Fish in a Drawer", [...] "Two And a Half Deaths", the corresponding CSI episode, aired on CBS. However, in an early Zap2it interview, both Mendelsohn and Lorre stated that this might be the last time a crossover like this might occur.|$|E

In October 2007, Fox Atomic pre-emptively purchased {{the rights to}} Cody's script with Megan Fox to star. Peter Rice, {{who at the time}} oversaw Fox Searchlight and Fox Atomic, brought in the project as Fox Searchlight had previously distributed Cody's film Juno. Mason Novick and Reitman's producing partner Dan Dubiecki signed as producers in November 2007 with plans to produce the film under Hard C, which is housed at Fox Searchlight. Reitman commented, [...] "We want to make unusual films, and anything that turns a genre on its ear interests Dan and I." [...] Karyn Kusama was announced as director in January 2008. Kusama said she signed on to the project because of the script. [...] "I was blessed to read this script at <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>where</b> the producers were meeting with directors and it just knocked me out. It was just so original, so imaginative", she stated. [...] "That's what it is about this script and the world is that it feels like a fairy tale gone psycho and I think that's what most fairy tales actually started as." [...] Additionally, Cody, Reitman and Kusama knew the film would be R rated because of the language.|$|E

500|$|Vicky Allan of the Sunday Herald noted Bond himself, and not {{his love}} interests, was sexually {{objectified}} in this film. <b>A</b> <b>moment</b> <b>where</b> he {{rises from the}} sea is reminiscent of Ursula Andress in Dr. No; he feels [...] "skewered" [...] by Vesper Lynd's criticism of him; [...] "and though it would be almost unthinkable now have a female character in a mainstream film stripped naked and threatened with genital mutilation, {{that is exactly what}} happens to Bond in [...]" [...] So although the film backed off from past criticism of Bond girls being sex objects, [...] "the once invincible James Bond becomes just another joint at the meat market." [...] This sentiment is shared by the University of Leicester's James Chapman, author of License to Thrill, who also notes Craig's Bond is [...] "not yet the polished article"; he felt his incarnation of Bond is close to Fleming's because he is [...] "humourless," [...] but is also different because [...] "Fleming's Bond did not enjoy killing; Craig's Bond seems almost to relish it." [...] Andrew Sarris of The New York Observer wrote that this particular Bond film is [...] "the very first that I would seriously consider placing on my own yearly 10-best list. Furthermore, I consider Daniel Craig to be the most effective and appealing of the six actors who have played 007, and that includes even Sean Connery." ...|$|E
500|$|According to a Metro publication, [...] "Something New" [...] had a {{generally}} positive reaction from fans. Susana Novo Vásquez of The Huffington Post stated that [...] "the indisputable team of Xenomania/Girls Aloud {{have been the}} ones to set the trends over the years for others to follow," [...] adding that the song [...] "continues down that path." [...] Vásquez continued saying that the group returned into <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>where</b> the [...] "pop scene ... isn't the same as when they left," [...] but {{thought that they were}} [...] "doing it in a very intelligent way: by adopting some of the Calvin Harris electronic massive sound that is current right now, yet creating an intricate song structure." [...] Robert Copsey of Digital Spy said that [...] "like most Girls Aloud singles, a few listens are required to get our heads around it." [...] Copsey criticized the distorted vocals and the fact that [...] "there probably won't be a full album of new tracks to accompany it," [...] but admitted that [...] "it sounds modern enough for today's charts without compromising their signature sound" [...] and praised its [...] "massive chorus." [...] Douglas Wolk of Pitchfork Media thought that the track [...] "is a game approximation of the Girls Aloud of seven years ago," [...] while BBC Music reviewer Ian Wade concluded that, [...] "as its title suggests, Something New is just that, a fanfare-like call to arms announcing the group’s return." ...|$|E

A few days later, Suzanne, with Darren's help, gives birth to twins Jack and Francine. Dawson said that at first, Darren chooses to be in denial about it wants nothing to do with Suzanne because {{he does not want to}} lose Nancy. Dawson noted that the birth of Darren's babies is messy and surprising. Darren finds himself in a situation he never expected when he has to deliver the babies and accept responsibility for them. Dawson stated, [...] "I think it's <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>where</b> Darren changes a little bit". Dawson added that Darren does [...] "step up to the mark" [...] and [...] "matures very quickly". Dawson felt that Darren enjoys being a father and it gives him a [...] "purpose in life" [...] which he has never had before. Dawson explained that Darren usually thinks of himself but is now thinking of the babies. E4, regarding Darren becoming a father, commented that due to his previous antics, he would not be an ideal candidate for [...] "Father of the year". The storyline is resolved when Cindy pays Suzanne £200,000 to return to Spain so that she can have Darren to herself. Suzanne accepts the money and leaves, taking Francine and Jack with her and leaving Darren heartbroken.|$|E
