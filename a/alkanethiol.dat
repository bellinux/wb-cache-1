40|$|Recent {{investigations}} of inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy (IETS) for <b>alkanethiol</b> self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) are reviewed. <b>Alkanethiol</b> SAMs are usually prepared by immersing a gold substrate into {{a solution of}} <b>alkanethiol</b> molecules, {{and they are very}} stable, even under ambient conditions. Thus, <b>alkanethiol</b> SAMs have been used as typical molecules for research into molecular electronics. Infrared spectroscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) have frequently been employed to characterize SAMs on the macroscopic scale. For characterization of <b>alkanethiol</b> SAMs on the nanometer scale region, or for single <b>alkanethiol</b> molecules through which electrons actually tunnel, IETS has proven to be an effective method. However, IETS experiments for <b>alkanethiol</b> SAMs employing different methods have shown large differences, i. e., {{there is a lack of}} standard data for <b>alkanethiol</b> SAMs with which to understand the IET process or to satisfactorily compare with theoretical investigations. An effective means of acquiring standard data is the formation of a tunneling junction with scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). After explanation of the STM experimental techniques, standard IETS data are presented whereby a contact condition between the tip and SAM is tuned. We have found that many vibrational modes are detected by STM-IETS, as is also the case for EELS. These results are compared with IET spectra measured with different tunneling junctions. In order to precisely investigate which vibrational modes are active in IETS, isotope labeling of alkanethiols with specifically synthesized isotopically substituted molecule has been examined. This method provides unambiguous assignments of IET spectra peaks and site selectivity for <b>alkanethiol</b> SAMs such that all parts of the <b>alkanethiol</b> molecules almost equally contribute to the IET process. The IET process is also discussed based on density functional theory and nonequilibrium Green's function calculations. These results quantitatively reproduce many the experimentally observed features, whereas Fermi's golden rule for IETS qualitatively explains the propensity rule and site selectivity observed in the experiments. However, comparison between experiment and theory reveals a large difference in IETS intensity for the C-H stretching mode that originates from the side chains of the <b>alkanethiol</b> molecules. In order to explain this difference, we discuss the importance of an intermolecular tunneling process in the SAM.

40|$|The {{main focus}} of this project was the {{nanoscale}} patterning of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of <b>alkanethiols</b> on gold. This has involved continuing development of scanning near-field photolithography (SNP) {{as a tool for}} nanofabrication. SNP is a new technique that uses a scanning near-field optical microscope (SNOM) coupled to a UV laser to create nanoscale structures. The maximum resolution of conventional photolithography is 'AJ 2 which is governed by the diffraction limit, SNOM can improve this by using a small aperture (50 nm) and holding the probe very close to the sample (10 - 15 run), thus limiting diffraction. SNP uses this to create features much smaller than the diffraction limit for 244 run light to the order ofA/ 30 or 9 run. The majority of this work has been on SAMs of <b>alkanethiols</b> on gold, but also <b>alkanethiols</b> on palladium have been used. These basic systems have been studied by various surface science techniques such as contact angle goniometry, atomic force microscopy (AFM), friction force microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and also surface plasmon resonance to study protein attachment. The attachment of biological molecules was examined by either organic reactions on the surface and photochemical attachment. These were subsequently patterned using micronscale photolithography and SNP. Photolithography of SAMs used UV light to perform photooxidation of surface bound <b>alkanethiols,</b> converting them to alkylsulfonates. Alkylsulfonates are weakly bound to the surface and can be replaced by an opposing thiol and therefore make a bifunctional pattern. This can be used for micronscale patterns.

40|$|The {{development}} of methods to produce nanoscale features with tailored chemical functionalities is fundamental for {{applications such as}} nanoelectronics and sensor fabrication. The molecular-ruler process shows great utility for this purpose as it combines top-down lithography {{for the creation of}} complex architectures over large areas in conjunction with molecular self-assembly, which enables precise control over the physical and chemical properties of small local features. The molecular-ruler process, which most commonly uses mercaptoalkanoic acids and metal ions to generate metal-ligated multilayers, can be employed to produce registered nanogaps between metal features. Expansion of this methodology to include molecules with other chemical functionalities could greatly expand the overall versatility, and thus the utility, of this process.

Advances in various techniques and their application in the study of SAMs have significantly improved our understanding of these molecular systems.

We find from {{literature}} that relatively less {{attention has been}} paid to the study of blocking properties of <b>alkanethiol</b> SAMs in non-aqueous solvents primarily due to their perceived instability in these solvents.

Here, we investigate the role of self-assembly monolayers of chain length n, where n ranges between 3 and 18, in modulating the charge injection in pentacene field effect transistors. The charge carrier mobility μ exhibits large fluctuations correlated with odd-even n. For n 8, μ decays exponentially with an inverse decay length β= 0. 6 Å- 1. As the morphology in the channel is invariant, we account for both the electron structure and the molecular disorder at the interface by introducing a length scale of injection {{as a function of the}} chain length. Charge injection across the interface occurs by through-bond tunneling of holes mediated by the <b>alkanethiol</b> layer. At short chain length, decrease of both interfacial morphological disorder and pentacene-surface interactions dominates over the increasing thickness of the <b>alkanethiol</b> monolayer. At long chain length, the charge injection across the <b>alkanethiol</b> monolayer completely governs the transistor response. The odd-even effect is ascribed to the anisotropic coupling between the <b>alkanethiol</b> terminal sigma bond and the HOMO level of ordered pentacene molecules.

MPCs consists of a metal core surrounded by various organic stabilizers. Pd MPCs coated with <b>alkanethiols,</b> alkylamine, dendrimers, surfactants, and polymers have recently been explored for catalysis applications. Pd MPCs coated with alkylamines are more catalytically active than <b>alkanethiols</b> for hydrogentation/isomerization of allyl alcohol, but at shorter chain lengths are unstable in H 2. We explored Pd MPCs synthesized in the presence of octylamines and discovered that the ligands attach to Pd as octanenitrile. This amine to nitrile conversion is catalyzed by the Pd and occurs during reduction of PdCl 4 2 - with sodium borohydride. When nitrile-stabilized Pd MPCs are exposed to H 2 or exposed to <b>alkanethiols</b> during a ligand place-exchange reaction, the nitriles desorb from the Pd surface and partially convert to amide and carboxylic acid groups. When the nitrilecoated Pd MPCs are heated ortreated with H 2 or place-exchange with <b>alkanethiols</b> without O 2, the nitrile ligands desorb from the surface asnitriles. The catalytic properties of dodecanethiol-coated PdAg alloy MPCs prepared by co-reduction of Pd(II) and Ag(I) salts showed an ~ 70 % reduction in catalytic activity towards hydrogenation/isomerization of allyl alcohol with just 10 % Ag incorporated into the alloy. We expected that PdAg alloys prepared by synthesizing dodecanethiol-coated Ag MPCs first followed by galvanic exchange with Pd(II) would produce more catalytically active MPCs with the Pd on the surface, however, difficulty in the isolation of PdAg MPCs prepared this way led to inconclusive results...|$|R

The stability of functionalization against oxidation of germanium for various alkyl chain lengths is elucidated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Among all schemes tested, long chain <b>alkanethiols</b> (>=C 12) are found to impart the most stable GeNW passivation against oxidation upon extended exposure to ambient air. Further, the chemically functionalized oxidation-resistant nanowires are soluble in organic solvents and can be readily assembled into close-packed Langmuir-Blodgett films potentially useful for future high performance electronic devices.
