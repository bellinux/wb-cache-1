40|$|The {{experience}} of ICRISAT {{with the use}} of Vertisols in semi-arid India indicates that the key to drastically improved productivity of Vertisols is the effective control of surface soil water which then enables rational use of the land for food and feed production. ILCA, therefore, developed and tested on-station and on-farm research in various highland Vertisol areas an animal-drawn implement for broadbed and furrow construction which was to combine technical efficiency of surface drainage construction with economic viability. Substantial increments in grain and biomass outputs due to enhanced surface drainage were recorded along with convincing economic returns to the farm in the application of this technology. In this chapter, history, objectives, rational, strategies, target areas and structure and organisation of the Vertisol project are presented; and the tasks of the <b>advisory</b> and <b>technical</b> <b>committees,</b> division the tasks of the <b>advisory</b> and <b>technical</b> <b>committees,</b> division of responsibilities between participating institutions, terms of reference for the <b>technical</b> <b>committee,</b> project phases and funding, and assistance by ICRISAt and IBSRAM are discussed...|$|R
