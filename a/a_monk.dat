5|$|Although Theobald was <b>a</b> <b>monk,</b> his episcopal {{household}} was not monastic in character. As {{he settled}} {{into the role of}} archbishop, he seems to have left most of his monastic habits behind, although he continued to have <b>a</b> <b>monk</b> as a companion. His nephews and brother benefited from his nepotism, with his nephews becoming part of his household early in his archepiscopate. The four nephews—Guillaume, Gilbert, Roger and Lechard—were witnesses to a charter of Theobald's dated to about 1150 or 1153. After Theobald's death, Guillaume was a clerk in Bartholomew, the Bishop of Exeter's household in around 1172.|$|E

5|$|Purportedly born in Weston on the {{outskirts}} of Bath, Ælfheah became <b>a</b> <b>monk</b> early in life. His birth took place around 953. He first entered the monastery of Deerhurst, but then moved to Bath, where he became an anchorite. He was noted for his piety and austerity, and rose to become abbot of Bath Abbey. The 12th century chronicler William of Malmesbury recorded that Ælfheah was <b>a</b> <b>monk</b> and prior at Glastonbury Abbey, but this is not accepted by all historians. Indications are that Ælfheah became abbot at Bath by 982, perhaps as early as around 977. He perhaps shared authority with his predecessor Æscwig after 968.|$|E

5|$|Stephen of Ripon {{says that}} Wilfrid stayed in Lyon for three years, leaving {{only after the}} archbishop's murder. However, Annemund's murder took place in 660 and Wilfrid {{returned}} to England in 658, suggesting that Stephen's chronology is awry. Stephen says that Annemund gave Wilfrid a clerical tonsure, although this {{does not appear to}} mean that he became <b>a</b> <b>monk,</b> merely that he entered the clergy. Bede is silent on the subject of Wilfrid's monastic status, although Wilfrid probably became <b>a</b> <b>monk</b> during his time in Rome, or afterwards while he was in Gaul. Some historians, however, believe that Wilfrid was never <b>a</b> <b>monk.</b> While in Gaul, Wilfrid absorbed Frankish ecclesiastical practices, including some aspects from the monasteries founded by Columbanus. This influence may be seen in Wilfrid's probable adoption of a Frankish ceremony in his consecration of churches later in his life, as well as in his employment of Frankish masons to build his churches. Wilfrid would also have learned of the Rule of Saint Benedict in Gaul, as Columbanus' monasteries followed that monastic rule.|$|E

5|$|In June 1108 Ralph succeeded Gundulf as Bishop of Rochester, {{having been}} {{nominated}} by Gundulf before his death. Ralph was consecrated on 9 August 1108. He was at Anselm's deathbed in April 1109, and, afterwards, Ralph acted as {{administrator of the}} see of Canterbury until 26 April 1114, when he was chosen Archbishop at Windsor. The king had wanted his doctor, Faricus, who was an Italian and Abbot of Abingdon, but the nobles and the bishops objected to anyone but a Norman being appointed. The bishops also desired someone who was not <b>a</b> <b>monk,</b> {{or at least not}} one who was so close to Henry. As a compromise, Ralph was chosen, rather than the secular clergy that the bishops favoured. Although Ralph was <b>a</b> <b>monk</b> and had not served as a royal clerk, he was also a bishop, which seems to have reconciled the other bishops to his selection.|$|E
