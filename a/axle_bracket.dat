50|$|The only {{engine to}} use a {{carburettor}} is the four-cylinder M10 used in the 518, which is fitted with a Pierburg 2B4 carburettor. The slightly inclined engine is mounted on the front <b>axle</b> <b>bracket</b> and screwed to the gearbox.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to analyse the proposed optimum design of tractor front <b>axle</b> <b>bracket</b> for varying load conditions. Due to brittleness of the cast component material, it is subjected to sudden failure under dynamic load condition causing potential danger. The front <b>axle</b> <b>bracket</b> is designed for high strength and stiffness. The existing design has no field failure reports and hence its parameters were taken as basis for comparison with results of the proposed designs. Based on the finite element analysis results, optimum design was carried out for the bracket for weight optimization and easy manufacturability. The proposed design was evaluated for selected worst load cases of the existing design. The finite element analysis of proposed models yielded displacement and stresses close to the existing design. The increase in displacement was not significant and the proposed design met the structural requirement. It was also observed that the proposed design has significant reduction in weight and did not involve welding, thereby significantly saving manufacturing cost. The assembly components like smaller diameters bearing, smaller knuckle size, etc were also found to be cost effective. The present work showcases the use of finite element analysis as a method for reduction of cost in terms of materials & manufacturing...|$|E
25|$|The two cranks, one on {{each side}} and usually mounted 180° apart, connect the bottom <b>bracket</b> <b>axle</b> to the pedals.|$|R
25|$|An {{eccentric}} hub or {{bottom bracket}} allows the off center <b>axle</b> or bottom <b>bracket</b> spindle to pivot {{and change the}} chain tension.|$|R
50|$|Some square tapered bottom <b>bracket</b> <b>axles</b> are {{threaded}} at {{the ends}} and use nuts. Other square tapered bottom brackets are hollow or not and crank bolts thread into the ends.|$|R
50|$|Q Factor is a {{function}} of both the bottom <b>bracket</b> width (<b>axle</b> length) and the crank arms. Bottom <b>brackets</b> <b>axles</b> vary in length from 102mm to 127mm. Mountain bike cranks are typically about 20mm wider than road cranks.|$|R
25|$|In general, U.S. and European cycle {{manufacturers}} used {{to assemble}} cycles {{from their own}} frames and components made by other companies, although very large companies (such as Raleigh) used to make almost every part of a bicycle (including bottom <b>brackets,</b> <b>axles,</b> etc.) In recent years, those bicycle makers have greatly changed their methods of production. Now, almost none of them produce their own frames.|$|R
5000|$|Brackets : Groups {{letters and}} numbers {{describing}} the same bogie. For example, (A1A) indicates a three-axle bogie with the outer two <b>axles</b> driven. When <b>brackets</b> are used a prime {{is not needed}} to indicate a bogie. Mallet locomotives can be indicated by bracketing the front power unit — for example, the Union Pacific Big Boy, 4-8-8-4 in Whyte notation, is (2′D)D2′ in UIC notation.|$|R
5000|$|The Q Factor of {{a bicycle}} is the {{distance}} between the pedal attachment points on the crank arms, when measured parallel to the bottom <b>bracket</b> <b>axle.</b> [...] It may also be referred to as the [...] "tread" [...] of the crankset. The term was coined by Grant Petersen during his time at Bridgestone Bicycles. The [...] "Q" [...] stands for [...] "quack", a reference to the wide stance and waddling gait of ducks.|$|R
5000|$|Cannondale {{developed}} a proprietary bottom bracket and crankset technology called Hollowgram {{which has been}} featured in its high-end bikes since 2001. The crank and bottom bracket set weigh 80 grams less and are 10% stiffer than Dura-Ace (FC-7800). [...] The hollowgram bottom bracket shell can accept standard 68 mm English-threaded bottom bracket cartridges and external bearing cranksets {{through the use of}} an adapter. The aluminum Hollowgram crank is a two piece hollow shell that is bonded with aluminum glue. The Hollowgram bottom <b>bracket</b> <b>axle</b> is also hollow aluminum and oversized.|$|R
50|$|A dustcap {{may also}} refer, on a bicycle, to the crankarm bolt cover. It {{is usually a}} piece of metal or plastic that, on the crankarm, is snapped or screwed into the {{threaded}} counterbore, which houses the bolt that holds the crankarm to its <b>axle,</b> the bottom <b>bracket</b> spindle. The dustcap serves to protect the threads (on {{the inside of the}} counterbore), which are used with a crankarm puller to remove the crankarm from the spindle. It is also possible for the crank arm to squirm on the bottom bracket spindle, causing the crankarm nut/bolt to become loose, leading to the nut/bolt working its way out of the bottom bracket spindle. The dust cap limits the amount of dangerous loosening that can occur.|$|R
5000|$|... "Hollowtech II" [...] - This was {{the next}} {{iteration}} after Hollowtech cranks. For this system the bottom <b>bracket</b> <b>axle</b> was fused to the drive side crank and the non drive side crank fitted on a spline on the axle using pinch bolts. The bottom bracket bearings sat outside the BB shell in the frame, allowing the BB axle to be a larger diameter, making it stiffer and lighter. The bearing reliability of this system remains quite variable compared to previous Shimano cartridge BB's as Hollowtech II bearing alignment is {{at the mercy of}} the alignment of the BB shell threads and the facing of the BB shell rather than factory set by Shimano in the case of the cartridge BB's. Race face make a system with compatible bearings which they call X-Type.|$|R
5000|$|The unified rear {{triangle}} or [...] "URT" [...] for short, {{keeps the}} bottom <b>bracket</b> and rear <b>axle</b> directly connected at all times. Suspension action is provided between the rear triangle, which unites rear <b>axle</b> and bottom <b>bracket,</b> {{and the front}} triangle, which unites seat and front axle. This design uses only one pivot, which keeps the number of moving parts down. The fixed length between bottom <b>bracket</b> and rear <b>axle</b> gives the URT the advantage of zero chain growth and consistent front derailleur shifting. Additionally the bike is easily modified into a single-speed. However, as the URT's suspension moves, the distance between seat and pedals changes, detracting from pedaling efficiency. Furthermore, when the rider shifts any weight from the seat to the pedals, {{he or she is}} shifting weight from the sprung part of the bike to the unsprung parts. As such, part of the rider's weight is no longer suspended by the suspension system. Since pedaling itself is a shift of this weight, the design is very prone to suspension bob.|$|R
40|$|AIM: Among {{the fitness}} activities, cycling in water {{immersion}} performed with water stationary bikes (WSB) {{has become very}} popular. However, {{there is a lack}} of information concerning their physiological demand. The aim of the present study was to assess the cardiovascular responses to four WSBs. METHODS: Twenty-two healthy participants underwent a graded exercise test on a cycle ergometer. Sixteen of them, 8 males (age 31. 5 + or - 8. 2 years) and 8 females (age 31. 9 + or - 5. 8 years) with the same level of peak oxygen consumption (VO(2 peak)) were chosen and submitted, in random order, to four incremental testing sessions performed with four different models of WSB, one with no resistance (WSB 1), two with resistance added to the bottom <b>bracket</b> <b>axle</b> (WSB 2 and WSB 3), one with resistance added to the pedals (WSB 4). The VO(2 peak) and heart rate peak (HR(peak)) were measured in all five conditions. RESULTS: Since no significant main effect for gender was detected, the data were grouped and analyzed all together. No significant differences were found in VO(2 peak) and HR(peak) within the five testing conditions, whilst time to exhaustion (P< 0. 01) and pedaling frequency (RPM) at volitional exhaustion (P< 0. 01) were both significantly different across the four WSBs. When pedaling at 70 RPM, the oxygen consumption and heart rate response (as...|$|R
60|$|The pocket {{apparatus}} {{is similar}} to one originally made and used by Sir William J. Herschel (see Plate 3, Fig. 4, in which the roller and its bearings are drawn {{of the same size}} as those I use). A small cylinder of hard wood, or of brass tube, say 1-3/4 inch long, and 1/2 or 3/4 inch in diameter, has a pin firmly driven into each end to serve as an axle. A piece of tightly-fitting india-rubber tubing is drawn over the cylinder. The cylinder, thus coated with a soft smooth compressible material, turns on its <b>axle</b> in two <b>brackets,</b> each secured by screws, as shown in Plate 2, Fig. 4, to a board (say 6 × 2-1/2 × 1/4 inch) that serves as handle. This makes a very fair and durable roller; it can be used in the heat and damp of the tropics, and is none the worse for a wetting, but {{it is by no means}} so good for delicate work as a cylinder covered with roller composition. These are not at all difficult to make; I have cast them for myself. The mould is a piece of brass tube, polished inside. A thick disc, with a central hole for the lower pin of the cylinder, fits smoothly into the lower end of the mould, and a ring with a thin bar across it, fits over the other end, the upper pin of the cylinder entering a hole in the middle of the bar; thus the cylinder is firmly held in the right position. After slightly oiling the inside of the mould, warming it, inserting the disc and cylinder, and fitting on the ring, the melted composition is poured in on either side of the bar. As it contracts on cooling, rather more must be poured in than at first appears necessary. Finally the roller is pushed out of the mould by a wooden ramrod, applied to the bottom of the disc. The composition must be melted like glue, in a vessel surrounded by hot water, which should never be allowed to boil; otherwise it will be spoilt. Harrild's best composition is more than twice the cost of that ordinarily used, and is expensive for large rollers, but for these miniature ones the cost is unimportant. The mould with which my first roller was made, was an old pewter squirt with the nozzle cut off; its piston served the double purpose of disc and ramrod.|$|R
