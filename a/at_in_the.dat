5|$|At {{the start}} of the English Civil War in 1642, {{fighting}} broke out around Portsmouth between the Royalist forces, led by Colonel George Goring, and Parliamentarians under the command of Colonel Richard Norton. Southsea Castle was held by the Royalist Captain Challoner, supported by a small garrison of eleven men and 14 guns, and Norton decided to attack the fortification with 400 infantry and two troops of cavalry. The assault took place <b>at</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early hours of the morning on 5 September; the garrison had positioned their guns to point inland, so the attackers stormed the moat on the seaward side. They then demanded that the garrison surrender but Challoner, who had been drinking heavily with Goring the night before, refused to discuss this and asked them to return later in the day. A fresh assault began and the garrison surrendered without loss of life. The capture of the castle meant left Portsmouth's position untenable and the town surrendered. A significant Parliamentarian garrison was then installed in the castle to keep it from being retaken.|$|E
5|$|Grissom {{asked to}} remain in Korea to fly another 25 flights, but his request was denied. He was given the option of {{choosing}} which base he wished to be stationed <b>at</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States; he requested Bryan AFB in Bryan, Texas. He served there as a flight instructor, and was joined by his wife and son. His second child was born there in 1953. During a training exercise with a cadet, a trainee pilot caused a flap to break off the plane, sending it spinning out of control. Grissom climbed from the rear seat of the small craft {{to take over the}} controls and safely land the jet.|$|E
5|$|He {{also said}} that the {{situation}} had been looked <b>at</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wrong way by police, members of parliament and the security services; rather than asking if Profumo had committed adultery they should have asked if his conduct had led ordinary people to believe he committed adultery. His analogy was with divorce law; a man does not need to have committed adultery for his wife to have grounds to divorce him, but rather she simply has to believe that he has committed adultery. This is because such a belief would destroy the trust and confidence within the relationship. This brought criticism from several government ministers including Sir John Hobson, the Attorney-General for England and Wales, saying that it would mean condemning a man on the basis of suspicion rather than evidence.|$|E

5|$|In Virginia and Carolina, the Palladian {{manner is}} epitomised in {{numerous}} Tidewater plantation houses, such as Stratford Hall or Westover Plantation, or Drayton Hall near Charleston. These examples are all classic American colonial {{examples of a}} Palladian taste that was transmitted through engravings, {{for the benefit of}} masons—and patrons, too—who had no first-hand experience of European building practice. A feature of American Palladianism was the re-emergence of the great portico, which again, as in Italy, fulfilled the need of protection from the sun; the portico in various forms and size became a dominant feature of American colonial architecture. In the north European countries the portico had become a mere symbol, often closed, or merely hinted <b>at</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> design by pilasters, and sometimes in very late examples of English Palladianism adapted to become a porte-cochere; in America, the Palladian portico regained its full glory.|$|E
5|$|The {{adaptation}} to the screen has continued with the trend of including new scenes to flesh out characters that in the book are only superficially seen through {{the point of view}} characters. These include the dialectical confrontation between Littlefinger and Varys, and the conversation between King Robert and Queen Cersei, and the young lovers Renly and Loras. The show's writers used this opportunity to make explicit Loras and Renly's ongoing assignations, which were only hinted <b>at</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> books.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{service was}} operated by trains composed of an engine and three carriages. Thirty-two passengers could be accommodated in each carriage, which had longitudinal bench seating and sliding {{doors at the}} ends, leading onto a platform for boarding and alighting. It was reasoned {{that there was nothing}} to look <b>at</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tunnels, so the only windows were in a narrow band high up in the carriage sides. Gate-men rode on the carriage platforms to operate the lattice gates and announce the station names to the passengers. Because of their claustrophobic interiors, the carriages soon became known as padded cells. Unlike other railways, the C had no ticket classes or paper tickets; when the railway began operations, a flat fare of two pence, collected at a turnstile, was charged. Despite the cramped carriages and competition from bus and tram services, the railway attracted 5.1million passengers in 1891, its first year of operation. To alleviate overcrowding, the fleet of rolling stock was enlarged.|$|E

5|$|While Cagney was in New York, his brother, who had {{effectively}} {{become his}} agent, angled {{for a substantial}} pay raise and more personal freedom for his brother. The success of The Public Enemy and Blonde Crazy forced Warner Bros.' hand. They eventually offered Cagney a contract for $1000 a week. Cagney's first film upon returning from New York was 1932's Taxi!. The film is notable for not only being {{the first time that}} Cagney danced on screen, but it was also the last time he allowed himself to be shot at with live ammunition (a relatively common occurrence at the time, as blank cartridges and squibs were considered too expensive and hard to find to use in most motion picture filming).

25|$|Though Huxley {{was a great}} {{comparative}} anatomist and invertebrate zoologist, perhaps his most notable scientific achievement was his work on human evolution. Starting in 1858, Huxley gave lectures and published papers which analysed the zoological position of man. The best were collected in a landmark work: Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature (1863). This contained two themes: first, humans {{are related to the}} great apes, and second, the species has evolved in a similar manner to all other forms of life. These were ideas which the careful and cautious Darwin had only hinted <b>at</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Origin of Species, but with which Huxley was in full agreement.|$|E
25|$|We live, they say, in The Information Age, yet {{almost none}} of the {{information}} we think we possess is true. Eskimos do not rub noses. The rickshaw was invented by an American.

Whatever is not interesting, we are even more interested in. Everything is interesting if looked <b>at</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> right way.
