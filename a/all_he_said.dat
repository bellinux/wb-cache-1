500|$|Andrew Garfield {{was given}} the role of Tommy, a well-meaning, rather dim young person who struggles {{to find a place}} in an {{environment}} which values imagination and creativity above <b>all.</b> <b>He</b> <b>said</b> of his character, [...] "There's a sense of anxiety that runs through these kids, especially Tommy, because he's so sensory and feeling and animalistic, that's my perspective of him." [...] Garfield was attracted to the film based on the existential questions the story expresses. He called the experience of being a part of Never Let Me Go a [...] "dream to come true". Garfield enjoys an opportunity to let loose with his roles. He said the scenes in which his character—unable to contain his frustration—erupts with a wail, was [...] "intense" [...] for him. [...] "I think those screams are inside all of us, I just got a chance to let mine out". Before shooting the film, he had read the screenplay and the book. In March 2009 Daily Variety reported that Knightley was signed to the project. Knightley admitted that she only agreed to appear in Never Let Me Go because co-star and friend Mulligan had asked her to. She portrays Ruth, a zealous, ambitious character who behaves manipulatively out of inner insecurity. When asked what she did and did not have in common with her character, Knightley said she was unable to relate to Ruth's situation of being involved in a love triangle.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] was {{directed}} by Francis Lawrence, and filmed in Malibu, California, {{during the week of}} October 29, 2002. Lawrence created the video's concept and told MTV News, [...] " [...] had a conversation on the phone and <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> was he wanted to have some dancing in it, but to do my thing. He told me what the song was about, but in a [...] as well. He just said it was a kiss-off song and so I came up with this idea and he went for it". Lawrence added that he also included some details in the video, including a reference to Spears's tattoo, which Timberlake enjoyed. He explained that he and Timberlake did not mention names while creating the video, only discussing the song's general beats. Lawrence also revealed that executives of Jive Records were nervous about some aspects of the video, such as Timberlake's representation of a voyeur and the tone of some scenes he was portraying with a girl. [...] "That's the thing I liked most about this project, was that he was coming into it with a super clean-cut image with 'N Sync and he's such a nice guy and so handsome and what I was into doing was making him be a bit scary. Lurking around the house in the rain, throwing a rock through her window, being a peeping Tom, getting revenge and doing stuff that's not really what a nice guy does." [...] The music video for [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] was released onto the iTunes Store on April 28, 2003.|$|E
2500|$|... "When he {{went over}} [...] in 1764, to take my father [...] to school, he was {{commissioned}} {{by a number of}} Marylanders to call upon Lord North, England's new Chancellor of the Exchequer, hostile to America, on his way through London, and make representations on the subject of taxation. He was politely received and the minister put a great many questions to him, and seemed to acquiesce in <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> [...] At all events my Grandfather had the pleasure soon after to hear of the repeal of this obnoxious tax".|$|E

2500|$|Thinking, perhaps, {{that the}} sound might go out, that [...] "an abolitionist" [...] had held forth several times to this community, and that the public feeling was not aroused to create mobs or disturbances, leaving the {{impression}} that <b>all</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> was concurred in, and received as gospel and the word of salvation. I am happy to say, that no violence or breach of the public peace was attempted, so far from this, that all except a very few, attended to their own avocations and left the gentleman to hold forth his own arguments to nearly naked walls.

2500|$|In 1955, Coltrane married Naima (born Juanita Grubbs). Naima Coltrane, who {{was already}} a Muslim convert, heavily {{influenced}} his spirituality. [...] When they married, Naima had a five-year-old daughter named Antonia, later named Saeeda. Coltrane adopted Saeeda. Coltrane met Naima {{at the home of}} bassist Steve Davis in Philadelphia. The love ballad he wrote to honor his wife, [...] "Naima" [...] was Coltrane's favorite composition. In 1956 the couple left Philadelphia with their six-year-old daughter in tow and moved to New York City. [...] In August 1957, Coltrane, Naima and Saeeda moved into an apartment on 103d St. and Amsterdam Ave. in New York, near Central Park West. A few years later, John and Naima Coltrane purchased a home on Long Island on Mexico Street. This is the house where they would eventually break up in 1963. Said Naima about the break in J.C. Thomas's Chasin' the Trane: [...] "I could feel {{it was going to happen}} sooner or later, so I wasn't really surprised when John moved out of the house in the summer of 1963. He didn't offer any explanation. He just told me there were things he had to do, and he left only with his clothes and his horns. He stayed in a hotel sometimes, other times with his mother in Philadelphia. <b>All</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> was, 'Naima, I'm going to make a change.' Even though I could feel it coming, it hurt, and I didn't get over it for at least another year." [...] But Coltrane kept a close relationship with Naima, even calling her in 1964 to tell her that 90% of his playing would be prayer. [...] Coltrane would be dead in four years, but he always kept in touch with her. Naima brought serenity and a calmness into his life. All who knew Naima described her gentle spirit and serenity. They remained in touch until his death in 1967. Naima Coltrane died of a heart attack in October 1996.|$|E
2500|$|One official, Back Judge Adrian Burk, {{signaled}} that {{the play was}} a touchdown, but the other game officials did not immediately make any signal. When the officials huddled, Burk and another official, Umpire Pat Harder, thought that the play was a touchdown because Tatum and Fuqua had both touched the ball, while three others {{said that they were}} {{not in a position to}} rule. Referee Fred Swearingen approached Steelers sideline official Jim Boston and asked to be taken to a telephone. Boston took Swearingen to a baseball dugout in the stadium. There was a video monitor in the dugout, but it was not used by Swearingen. (Terry Bradshaw's assertion that a special television was rigged up on the sideline so that Swearingen could watch the replay is not supported by other accounts.) From the dugout telephone Boston put in a call to the press box to reach the NFL's supervisor of officials, Art McNally. Before the call McNally had [...] "an opinion from the get-go" [...] that the ball had hit Tatum's chest, which he confirmed by looking [...] "at one shot on instant replay." [...] In the press box the telephone was answered either by Dan Rooney, son of Steelers owner Art Rooney, or by Steelers public relations director Joe Gordon (reports vary), and McNally was put on the line. According to McNally, Swearingen [...] "never asked me about the rule, and never asked what I saw. <b>All</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> was, 'Two of my men say that opposing players touched the ball.' And I said, 'everything's fine then, go ahead.'" [...] After Swearingen hung up the phone Boston asked, [...] "What do we got?" [...] "We got a touchdown," [...] answered Swearingen, who then went back onto the field to signal the ruling to the crowd. Franco Harris crossed the goal line at approximately 3:29 PM EST. Fans immediately rushed the field, and it took 15 minutes to clear them so that the extra point could be kicked to give the Steelers what turned out to be their final margin of victory, 13–7.|$|E
