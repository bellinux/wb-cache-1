5|$|Before he died, López Salcedo {{appointed}} contador Andrés de Cerezeda as his successor. Cerezada {{was unable}} to impose his authority over the residents of Trujillo, with two rival claimants struggling for power. Vasco de Herrera {{was supported by the}} town council, and was strong enough to force Cerezeda to <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> power-sharing compromise. In reality, it was Vasco de Herrera who wielded true authority over the province.|$|E
5|$|Draw by agreement: Draws {{are most}} {{commonly}} reached {{by mutual agreement}} between the players. The correct procedure is to verbally offer the draw, make a move, then start the opponent's clock. Traditionally, players {{have been allowed to}} <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> draw at any point in the game, occasionally even without playing a move; in recent years efforts have been made to discourage short draws, for example by forbidding draw offers before move thirty.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{informal}} rules governing fighting in ice hockey that players rarely discuss but take quite seriously. The {{most important aspect}} of this etiquette is that opposing enforcers must <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> fight, usually via a verbal or physical exchange on the ice. This agreement helps both players avoid being given an instigator penalty, and helps keep unwilling participants out of fights.|$|E
50|$|In April 2007 the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Portland in Oregon <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> $75 million {{settlement}} with 177 claimants and the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Seattle <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> $48 {{million settlement}} {{with more than}} 160 victims.|$|R
5000|$|On May 6, 2009, the State Election Enforcement Commission {{announced}} that Gaffey and his campaign treasurer had <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> settlement over the double billing complaint. In {{one of the}} largest fines levied by the Commission, Gaffey <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> $6,000 fine and his treasurer <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> $3,000 fine. Gaffey also <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> dissolve his political action committee and forfeit its $20,000 balance to the state.

5|$|As {{it became}} {{apparent}} that Hamhuis would not be re-signed by the Predators following the 2009–10 season, his negotiating rights were traded to the Philadelphia Flyers, along with a 2011 conditional draft pick, for Ryan Parent on June 19, 2010. Hamhuis and the Predators had been negotiating for most of the season, {{as well as in the}} summer, but Nashville was not willing to meet his asking price. After failing to <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> contract with Philadelphia as well, his rights were traded once again to the Pittsburgh Penguins for a 2011 third-round pick on June 25; negotiations with the club were also unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|Cabin in the Cotton (1932) is a Warner Bros. message {{film about}} the evils of capitalism. The film takes place in an {{unspecified}} southern state where workers are given barely enough to survive and taken advantage of by being charged exorbitant interest rates and high prices by unscrupulous landowners. The film is decidedly anti-capitalist; however, its preface claims otherwise: In the end, however, the planters admit their wrongdoing and <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> more equitable distribution of capital.|$|E
5|$|Central to the 2009 dispute was the {{agreement}} that ended the 2007 round of strikes. The 2007 Pay and Modernisation Agreement saw the parties involved <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> four-phase plan, which would be implemented with dialogue between both sides at each stage of the process. However, the Communication Workers Union said that although Royal Mail had carried out three of the phases in this way, it had refused to discuss the final phase, which concerned the government's plans for modernisation, and how these would affect the job security of Royal Mail employees.|$|E
50|$|In December 2011, {{the school}} board and {{teachers}} union <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> early bird, three-year contract.

5|$|Due to {{his age and}} ill health, Brown {{was able}} to speak only once per week. At a {{campaign}} event in Madisonville, he challenged Goebel to a debate, but Goebel ignored the challenge. Brown, and other speakers enlisted {{on behalf of his}} campaign, frequently called attention to Goebel's refusal to acknowledge the challenge or <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> debate. When William Jennings Bryan came to the state to campaign with Goebel, Brown sent him a letter challenging him to repudiate Goebel's nomination because of the broken agreement between Goebel and Stone. Bryan refused to comment on the events of the convention and stressed the importance of party loyalty. He denounced the Honest Election League's convention as irregular and invalid.|$|E
5|$|Enterprise is {{en route}} to the Berengarius system, one of the {{proposed}} locations for a Starfleet starbase, when it is approached by an Orion Syndicate vessel. Captain Archer is invited to visit the Orion ship by its captain, Harrad-Sar. During the visit, Archer and Lieutenant Reed are entertained by three Orion dancers, Navaar, D'Nesh, and Maras.

They return to Enterprise with the slaves and set a course to survey the planet.|$|E

5|$|Following his {{interference}} in the Elimination Chamber match to prevent The Undertaker from winning, Shawn Michaels cut a promo on the next episode of Raw, stating that he interfered so that The Undertaker would <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> rematch at WrestleMania XXVI to get revenge. The Undertaker accepted the match {{on the condition that}} if Michaels lost, he would have to retire, to which Michaels agreed. Two weeks later, the pair agreed to make the match a no countout, no disqualification match.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} two weeks of the shutdown, there was little {{progress}} and neither the governor nor the Republican leaders made proposals accepted by the other side. On July 4, Republican lawmakers affirmed their commitment to not <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> budget of over $34 billion. Documents leaked after June 30 stated that the Republican leadership included anti-abortion provisions, a voter ID requirement, and a ban on stem cell research during the budget negotiations. Both the Republican legislative leaders and Dayton (along with DFL legislative leaders) toured Minnesota to make their case to Minnesotans. The government shutdown ended after Governor Dayton announced on July 14 that he would accept the last Republican offer before the shutdown, albeit with certain conditions.|$|E
5|$|Hanada holes up in Misako's {{apartment}} and Number One begins an extended siege, taunting Hanada with threatening {{phone calls and}} forbidding {{him to leave the}} apartment.

They <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> temporary truce and set times to eat, sleep and, later, to link arms everywhere they go. Number One suggests they eat out one day and then disappears during the meal.|$|E

5|$|Only about 1300 {{cartridges}} of {{the estimated}} 700,000 {{were removed from the}} burial, as the remaining materials were deeper than expected, and made them more difficult to access, according to Alamogordo mayor Susie Galea. The burial was refilled following this event. Joseph Lewandowski, who had worked to arrange the unearthing with the city, said that this was a one-time shot to recover materials from the site, as they do not expect the city to <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> similar event again.|$|E
5|$|Soon after Henry's {{coronation}} Gerard {{was appointed}} to the recently vacant see of York, and became embroiled in the long-running dispute between York and the see of Canterbury concerning which archbishopric had primacy over England. Gerard managed to secure papal recognition of York's claim to jurisdiction over the church in Scotland, but he was forced to <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> compromise with his counterpart at Canterbury, Anselm, over Canterbury's claims to authority over York, although it was not binding on his successors. In the Investiture Controversy between the king and the papacy over the right to appoint bishops, Gerard worked on reconciling the claims of the two parties; the controversy was finally resolved in 1107.|$|E
5|$|The Byzantines, {{who in the}} {{meantime}} had neutralized the detachment left to secure the Abbasid army's rear in Phrygia, were able to trap Harun's army between their own converging forces. The defection of the Armenian general Tatzates, however, allowed Harun to regain the upper hand. The Abbasid prince sent for a truce and detained the high-ranking Byzantine envoys, who included Empress Irene's chief minister, Staurakios. This forced Irene to <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> three-year truce and pay a heavy annual tribute. Irene then focused {{her attention to the}} Balkans, but warfare with the Arabs resumed in 786, until mounting Arab pressure led to another truce in 798, on terms similar to those of 782.|$|E
