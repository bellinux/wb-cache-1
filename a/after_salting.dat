We hypothesized that oxidative stress causes MR activation in high-salt-fed Dahl salt-sensitive rats. Furthermore, we determined if MR activation persisted and induced renal injury, even after switching from a high- to a normal-salt diet. High-salt feeding for 4 weeks increased dihydroethidium fluorescence (DHE, an oxidant production marker), p 22 phox (a NADPH oxidase subunit) and serum and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase- 1 (SGK 1, an MR transcript) in glomeruli, compared with normal-salt feeding, and these changes persisted 4 weeks <b>after</b> <b>salt</b> withdrawal. Tempol treatment (0. 5 mmol/L) during high-salt feeding abolished {{the changes in}} DHE fluorescence, p 22 phox and SGK 1. Dietary <b>salt</b> reduction <b>after</b> a 4 -week high-salt diet decreased both blood pressure and proteinuria, but was associated with significantly higher proteinuria than in normal control rats at 4 weeks <b>after</b> <b>salt</b> reduction.

5000|$|Dried and salted cod, {{sometimes}} referred to simply as salt cod, is cod which has been preserved by drying <b>after</b> <b>salting.</b> Cod which has been dried without the addition of salt is stockfish. Salt cod was long a major export of the North Atlantic region, and has become an ingredient of many cuisines around the Atlantic and in the Mediterranean. With the sharp decline in the world stocks of cod, other salted and dried white fish are sometimes marketed as [...] "salt cod", and the term has become to some extent a generic name.|$|E

We hypothesized that oxidative stress causes MR activation in high-salt-fed Dahl salt-sensitive rats.

50|$|The {{method of}} {{production}} {{is similar to that}} of caciocavallo. The milk is warmed and curdled with the rennet and the curds are placed in a tompagno: a perforated basket similar to a colander. After two or three hours, when the required level of acidity has been reached, the coagulate is sliced up and ‘spun’ in hot water. (See pasta filata.) The pieces are then moulded by hand into their characteristic shape. <b>After</b> <b>salting</b> in brine for 12 to 20 hours (depending on their size), the ‘balloons’ are set to dry for 15 days in the dairy where they were shaped, and then transferred to the cellar to mature.|$|E
50|$|One of such {{practices}} is to constrict the blood locked within meats before cooking by throwing cut {{pieces of the}} meat (<b>after</b> <b>salting</b> and rinsing) into a pot of boiling water, and leaving them there {{for as long as}} it takes for the meat to whiten on its outer layer. This practice prevents the blood from oozing out, and is only a rabbinical precautionary measure (Cf. Hullin 111a). If soup was to be made from meat which was thrown into a pot of boiling water, it was not necessary to take out the meat. Rather, the froth and scum which surfaces were scooped away, and this sufficed. It was also a Jewish practice in Yemen that when salting the cut meat, the pieces are prepared no larger than half a roṭal (about the size of half an orange) so as to permit the effectiveness of the salt on that meat.|$|E
40|$|Kortowski cheese (Műnster type) was salted for 100, 75, 50 and 25 % {{of their}} {{standard}} salting time, which is 48 hours.

40|$|Programmed {{cell death}} (PCD) {{is a key}} element in normal plant growth and {{development}} which may also be induced by various abiotic and biotic stress factors including salt stress. In the present study, morphological, biochemical, and physiological responses of the theoretically immortal unicellular freshwater green alga Micrasterias denticulata were examined <b>after</b> <b>salt</b> (200 mM NaCl or 200 mM KCl) and osmotic stress induced by iso-osmotic sorbitol. KCl caused morphological changes such as cytoplasmic vacuolization, extreme deformation of mitochondria, and ultrastructural changes of Golgi and ER. However, prolonged salt stress (24 h) led to the degradation of organelles by autophagy, a special form of PCD, both in NaCl- and KCl-treated cells. This was indicated by the enclosure of organelles by ER-derived double membranes. DNA of NaCl- and KCl-stressed cells but not of sorbitol-treated cells showed a ladder-like pattern on agarose gel, which means that the ionic rather than the osmotic component of salt stress leads to the activation of the responsible endonuclease. DNA laddering during salt stress could be abrogated by addition of Zn 2 +. Neither cytochrome c release from mitochondria nor increase in caspase- 3 -like activity occurred <b>after</b> <b>salt</b> stress. Reactive oxygen species could be detected within 5 min after the onset of salt and osmotic stress. Respiration, photosynthetic activity, and pigment composition indicated an active metabolism which supports programmed rather than necrotic cell death in Micrasterias <b>after</b> <b>salt</b> stress...|$|R
