5|$|During their investigation, Pembleton and Bayliss learn Kaja {{has been}} in a Haitian prison for four months, {{eliminating}} him as a lead. Gee announces the Baltimore Sun is running a story that Kaja has been cleared <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>suspect,</b> leaked from the police. Pembleton accuses Ballard and Gharty of leaking the story, while Gharty accuses Pembleton of going easy on Felix Wilson because he is a successful black man. The discussion prompts a heated argument with accusations of racism from both sides. Pembleton agrees to interview Felix Wilson alone because he believes it will clear him. When Pembleton tells Wilson he needs a blood test from him and his son, Wilson admits that he had consensual sex with Brierre the night of the murder, but said he does not kill her. Later, a devastated Pembleton and Gee still insist he should not necessarily be treated <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>suspect,</b> much to the disbelief of Ballard and Gharty. The detectives are interrupted by Wilson's attorney, who says the family will not submit to a blood and hair test without a court order.|$|E

The elder Van der Sloot then brought a second action, seeking monetary damages {{for himself and his}} family because of his false arrest. The action was initially successful, but the award of damages was reversed on appeal.|$|E
5|$|At {{the police}} station, Hank tells his rehearsed story to real FBI agents. As Sarah predicted, the agents {{do not believe}} that Hank, an {{upstanding}} member of the community, would be capable of such wrongdoing. Although he is ruled out <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>suspect,</b> Hank is told that the money was part of a ransom and that many of the bills' serial numbers were written down to track the cash. Hank realizes he cannot use the money without being caught; he goes home and burns it all. In a closing narration, Hank reflects on his losses; as he tries to move on with his life, the murderous events constantly haunt him.|$|E

5|$|Dr. Charles Kroger (Stanley Kamel) {{arrives at}} his office and finds Adrian Monk (Tony Shalhoub) and Harold Krenshaw (Tim Bagley) arguing over who should get the {{following}} session. They enter the office and find Teresa Mueller (Lisa Dempsey), the building's cleaning lady, dead, {{and some of the}} patient files scattered. Captain Stottlemeyer (Ted Levine) and Lieutenant Disher (Jason Gray-Stanford) suspect that one of Dr. Kroger's patients was responsible. Dr. Kroger says it can be Joseph Wheeler (Kevin Fry), who threatened him in the past. Dr. Kroger blames himself for not predicting the murder, and decides to retire. Wheeler, however, is dismissed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>suspect</b> as he has a confirmed alibi.|$|E
5|$|In December 1983, Graysmith tracks Allen {{down to a}} Vallejo Ace Hardware store, {{where he}} is {{employed}} as a sales clerk. The men have a brief encounter before Graysmith leaves. Eight years later, victim Mike Mageau meets with authorities and identifies Allen from a police mugshot. As the authorities walk by an airport book store, copies of Graysmith's book Zodiac are shown. Final title cards inform the audience that Allen died in 1992 before he could be questioned further. A DNA test performed in 2002 on an archived autopsy sample did not match a partial DNA sample gathered from the postage stamp {{on one of the}} Zodiac letters, but this does not rule him out <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>suspect.</b>|$|E
5|$|In February 1999, David Protess, a Northwestern University journalism professor, and his {{students}} were studying cases of people on death row. They discovered evidence related to Death Row inmate Anthony Porter that might help exonerate him. The students produced four affidavits and a videotaped statement that attributed guilt for the crime to another suspect. They obtained recantations by some witnesses of their testimony at trial. One witness claimed that he named Anthony Porter <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>suspect</b> only after police officers threatened, harassed and intimidated him into doing so.|$|E

5|$|Martin {{was also}} wanted in San Francisco in the United States {{for the murder}} of {{homosexual}} prostitute Tom Wenger on 28 March 1994. Wenger's body was chopped up and drained of blood; it was found in a garbage skip (dumpster) in Myrte Alley in the Polk Street district. Martin's photograph matched a facial composite picture of a suspect made by San Francisco police, but he was formally eliminated <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>suspect</b> after it was established that he was living in a British halfway house {{at the time of the}} murder. He was also investigated for another murder in Arizona.|$|E

The action was initially successful, but the award of 40,000 Aruban florins (US$22,300) was reversed on appeal. The family's finances were depleted by the legal expenses. In January 2007, Paulus found work as a managing partner at the law firm that represented him.|$|E
5|$|Due to a miscommunication, the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia (MPDC) {{failed to}} follow its own search {{parameters}} in Rock Creek Park, leaving Levy's body to decompose for a year. Furthermore, the MPDC had been informed, and soon dismissed, that Ingmar Guandique, already arrested for attacking women in Rock Creek Park, had confessed to attacking Levy. The MPDC instead put {{much of its}} focus on the revelation that Levy {{was having an affair}} with Congressman Gary Condit, a married Democrat then serving his fifth term representing California's 18th congressional district, and a senior member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Condit had an overwhelming alibi (he was in meetings with the Vice President), was never named <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>suspect</b> by police and was eventually cleared of any involvement in the disappearance. However, due to the cloud of suspicion raised by the intense media focus on the missing intern and the later revelation of the affair, Condit lost his bid for re-election in 2002.|$|E

5|$|Hal Rogers's brother John {{was also}} {{considered}} a suspect {{even though he}} was in state prison serving a sentence for the rape of a woman who had shared his trailer, {{at the time of the}} murders. Police, investigating the woman's rape allegation, found evidence indicating that he had also sexually assaulted Hal's daughter Michelle, although charges involving this assault were later dropped because of her reluctance to testify. The St. Petersburg Times said that John may have planned the murder as he had visited his parents' property near Tampa a month before the murders. However, as the police established John could not have hired a professional killer, did not have accomplices, and could not have known the timing of his sister-in-law's and nieces' trip, he was dismissed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>suspect.</b>|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 20 January, the Avon and Somerset Constabulary arrested 32-year-old Dutch {{engineer}} Vincent Tabak, who lived with his girlfriend in the flat next door to Yeates. However, authorities declined to reveal additional details while the suspect was being interrogated due to concerns over controversial media coverage of Jefferies' arrest, which had breached the rules governing what can be reported when an individual is arrested. The Tabak arrest followed an anonymous tip from a female caller, shortly after a televised appeal by Yeates' parents on Crimewatch. Canynge Road was closed by police while scaffolding was constructed around Yeates' home; and officers sealed off Tabak's adjacent flat. Investigators also searched the nearby townhouse of a friend, where Tabak was {{believed to have been}} staying, about a mile away. Tabak had previously been ruled out <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>suspect</b> during an earlier stage of the investigation, and had returned to Britain from a holiday visit to his family in the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|Pembleton (Andre Braugher) {{continues}} his {{investigation into the}} shooting death of small-time drug peddler Charles Courtland Cox, who he suspects was killed by police during a botched crackhouse raid. As the involved police officers turn over their guns for testing, the press reports heavily on the story, which results in pressure from the department heads to solve the case. Pembleton aggressively questions several officers, but none are cooperative. Gee (Yaphet Kotto) is angry with Pembleton's focus on the police and demands civilian suspects be pursued. Howard (Melissa Leo) and Bayliss (Kyle Secor) canvas the neighborhood of the shooting and find most residents do not trust the police, who they feel are {{responsible for the death of}} one of their own. However, one woman named Dale (June Thorne) tells Bayliss her grandson, Lane Staley (Isaiah Washington) witnessed the shooting. Staley is brought in to the station for questioning and, while Pembleton plans to question him as an eyewitness, Gee demands he be treated <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>suspect.</b>|$|E

5|$|Robert Wesley Rackstraw is {{a retired}} pilot and ex-convict who served on an army {{helicopter}} crew and other units during the Vietnam War. He {{came to the attention}} of the Cooper task force in February 1978, after he was arrested in Iran and deported to the U.S. to face explosive possession and check kiting charges. Several months later, while released on bail, Rackstraw attempted to fake his own death by radioing a false mayday call and telling controllers that he was bailing out of a rented plane over Monterey Bay. Police later arrested him in Fullerton on an additional charge of forging federal pilot licenses; the plane he claimed to have ditched was found, repainted, in a nearby hangar. Cooper investigators noted his physical resemblance to Cooper composite sketches (although he was only 28 in 1971), military parachute training, and criminal record, but eliminated him <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>suspect</b> in 1979 after no direct evidence of his involvement could be found.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after 7:00 am on 30 December 2010, Christopher Jefferies, Yeates' {{landlord}} {{who lived}} in the same building, was arrested on suspicion of her murder. He was taken to a local police station for questioning while forensic investigators inspected his flat. On 31 December, a senior police officer granted investigators a 12-hour extension to the arrest, enabling them to hold him in custody for additional questioning. Police subsequently applied to magistrates for further extensions which were granted on 31 December and 1 January. Investigators were able to detain him <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>suspect</b> for up to 96 hours, but released Jefferies on bail after two days. He retained the legal services of the law firm Stokoe Partnership to act on his behalf. On 4 March 2011, police released him from bail and stated he was no longer a suspect. He subsequently won an undisclosed sum in libel damages for defamatory news articles published following his arrest, and received an apology from Avon and Somerset Police for any distress caused to him during the investigation.|$|E
5|$|The Enterprise {{heads to}} Torona IV to open {{negotiations}} with the Jarada, an insect-like race that is unusually strict in matters of protocol. After practicing the complex greeting the Jarada require to open negotiations, Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) decides to relax with a Dixon Hill story in the holodeck. Playing Detective Hill in the holoprogram, Picard takes up the case of Jessica Bradley (Carolyn Allport), who believes Cyrus Redblock (Lawrence Tierney) is trying to kill her. Picard decides to continue the program later and leaves the holodeck to affirm their estimated arrival at Torona IV. He invites Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) and visiting historian Dr. Whalen (David Selburg) {{to join him in}} the holodeck. While Crusher is still preparing, Picard and Whalen are ready to enter the holodeck when Lt. Cdr. Data (Brent Spiner) arrives, having overheard Picard's invitation. Entering the holodeck, the three discover Jessica has been murdered in Picard's absence. As Picard explains that he saw Jessica at his office the day before, Lt. McNary (Gary Armagnac) brings Picard into the police station for questioning <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>suspect</b> in her murder. Meanwhile, the Enterprise is scanned from a distance by the Jaradan, causing a power surge in the holodeck external controls. Dr. Crusher later enters the holodeck, first experiencing a momentary glitch with the holodeck doors, and joins her friends at the police station.|$|E
