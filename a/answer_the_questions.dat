5|$|The Italian theologian Francesco Antonio Zaccaria criticised Augustine's {{concept of}} {{evil in the}} eighteenth century. He noted a {{distinction}} between using the term evil to imply blame (sin) and to imply lament (suffering) and argued that Augustine posited sin to have occurred before suffering. This was problematic for Zaccaria, who believed that it made Augustine seem offhand and uninterested in human suffering. For Zaccaria, Augustine's perception of evil as a privation did not satisfactorily <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> of modern society as to why suffering exists.|$|E
5|$|As Alice's memory {{begins to}} fade, she daydreams {{of her mother}} and sister, who died in a car crash when she was a teenager. She memorizes words and sets a series of {{personal}} questions on her phone, which she answers every morning. She hides sleeping pills in her room, and records a video message instructing her future self to swallow the pills when she can no longer <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions.</b> As her disease advances, she becomes unable to give focused lectures and loses her job. She becomes lost searching for the bathroom in her own home and does not recognize Lydia after seeing her perform in a play.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} evening Hare took the stand to give evidence. Under {{cross-examination}} about the murder of Docherty, Hare claimed Burke had been the sole murderer and McDougal had twice been involved by bringing Docherty {{back to the house}} after she had run out; Hare stated that he had assisted Burke in the delivery of the body to Knox. Although he was asked about other murders, he was not obliged to <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions,</b> as the charge related only to the death of Docherty. After Hare's questioning, his wife entered the witness box, carrying their baby daughter who was suffering from whooping cough. Margaret used the child's coughing fits as a way to give herself thinking time for some of the questions, and told the court that she had a very poor memory and could not remember many of the events.|$|E

50|$|Contestants {{are given}} a {{question}} with three possible <b>answers.</b> <b>The</b> mob has to <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> within six seconds, and then the contestant has to <b>answer</b> it. When <b>the</b> contestant is happy to <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>question,</b> he/she then pushes the button that corresponds with <b>the</b> <b>answer.</b> If he/she <b>answers</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> correctly, any player in the 100-person mob who <b>answered</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> incorrectly is eliminated from play. Players add a specific amount to their bank for {{every member of the}} mob they eliminated on a particular question (see table, left). If after any correct <b>answer</b> and <b>the</b> entire 100-person mob eliminated, the contestant wins the grand prize of $1,000,000.|$|R

5000|$|Along the way, {{the player}} can be {{assisted}} by a [...] "classmate", {{one of five}} ten-year-old children, in <b>answering</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions.</b> <b>The</b> classmate, chosen for two questions at a time, attempts to <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> at <b>the</b> {{same time as the}} contestant, writing their answer on a virtual blackboard hidden from the contestant's view. The player picks a child to come and stand on the podium beside them and they <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> at <b>the</b> same time as the adult. They lock in their <b>answer</b> and <b>the</b> adult is given the option of copying <b>the</b> child's <b>answer</b> or peeking at it, and if they lock in their own <b>answer</b> and get <b>the</b> <b>question</b> wrong, they can be saved by <b>the</b> child's <b>answer</b> providing it is correct.|$|R

25|$|Francis August Schaeffer (January 30, 1912– May 15, 1984) was an American Evangelical Christian theologian, philosopher, and Presbyterian pastor. He is {{best known}} for {{establishing}} the L'Abri community in Switzerland. Opposed to theological modernism, Schaeffer promoted a more historic Protestant faith and a presuppositional approach to Christian apologetics, which he believed would <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> of the age.|$|E
25|$|In {{this poem}} Naidu {{described}} {{the beauty of}} traditional Hyderabadi Bazaars. She presented the lively pictorial scenes of merchants, vendors, peddlers, goldsmiths, fruit-men and flower girls selling their goods, all of whom similarly <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> of purchasers who buy their articles after a detailed bargaining. The poem also describes the musical instruments {{being used by the}} musicians and magicians described in the bazaar.|$|E

25|$|The {{format for}} the bonus round was {{modified}} in 2006. First-night champions would automatically {{be given a}} $50,000 cash jackpot, {{which could not be}} won until at least their seventh night. The Ten in a Row segment was changed so that ten correct answers would add another $50,000 to the jackpot. There was no need to correctly <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> consecutively, but at least ten answers had to be answered correctly before time ran out.|$|E
25|$|Ultima VI {{introduced}} a more systematic use of copy {{protection in the}} form of in-game questions, preventing the player from progressing any further if the questions were answered incorrectly. In Ultima VII, this practice was continued, although in both games the player had an unlimited number of tries to <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> correctly. Answers could be obtained by consulting the manual or cloth map, although the manual released with the Ultima Collection contained all copy protection answers for every game.|$|E

International variants have aired in around 160 countries worldwide. The show's format is a twist on the game show genre—only one contestant plays at a time (similar to some radio quizzes), and {{the emphasis is on}} suspense rather than speed. In most versions there are no time limits to <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions,</b> and contestants are given the question before they must decide whether to attempt an answer.|$|E

25|$|The Petition {{was read}} {{in front of}} the members of the People's Representative Council (DPR) on 13 May 1980 in an effort to persuade the representatives to ask the {{president}} what he had meant by the two speeches. The delegation to the legislature was led by Maj. Gen. (ret.) Dr Azis Saleh. On 3 July 1980, 19 DPR produced a document containing two number of questions to the president. They asked whether the president agreed that the Expression of Concern contained important issues deserving the attention of all sides, especially the legislature and the government, and whether the people of Indonesia deserved a comprehensive and detailed explanation about the issues raised. These questions were passed on to the president in a letter on 14 July. The questions provoked a variety of reactions in the House. One DPR member, Soedardji, did not agree the president had to <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions.</b> However, his party colleague Anwar Nuris said it was a normal part of the constitutional process.|$|E
500|$|After the 1976 Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and History {{meeting and}} the {{publication}} of Revisiting Blassingame's The Slave Community in 1978, Blassingame produced a revised and enlarged edition of The Slave Community in 1979. In the new preface, Blassingame asserted that the book had to be revised because of George Bentley, an enslaved, pro-slavery Primitive Baptist minister from Tennessee who pastored a white church in the 1850s. Blassingame wanted to [...] "solve the myriad dilemmas posed by George Bentley", but he also wanted to <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions,</b> challenges, and critiques raised by scholars since {{the publication of}} The Slave Community.|$|E
500|$|Minton {{tried again}} to expose what he {{believed}} to be Republican control of the media. He led the committee to target a newspaper with national circulation, Rural Progress. Minton accused the publishers of improperly accepting {{large sums of money}} from corporations and the editors of undue influence from this money. The owner of the paper, Maurive V. Renolds, was summoned before the committee for a hearing, where Minton demanded to know why he was accepting money from corporations. When Renolds asked his manager, Dr. Glen Frank, to help him <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions,</b> Minton and fellow Democratic senators began to shout Dr. Frank down. As he was saying that the money from the corporations was for advertising in the magazine, Minton beat his gavel and yelled, [...] "This committee doesn't intend to permit you to use this as a forum to air your Republican views." ...|$|E

A right answer or a successful challenge added the remaining percentage points to the couple's score. For example, if 53% <b>answered</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> correctly, a team earned 53 points for the closer guess and could earn an additional 47 points from a correct <b>answer</b> to <b>the</b> <b>question</b> or a successful challenge.|$|R

500|$|The Stanley {{plan also}} {{established}} {{a committee to}} investigate race relations and integration in Virginia. [...] This committee was officially titled the Virginia Committee on Law Reform and Racial Activities, but was publicly known as the [...] "Thomson Committee" [...] after its chair, Delegate James McIlhany Thomson. In 1954, David Scull (a printer in Annandale, Virginia) began publishing pro-integration literature {{on behalf of a}} number of organizations in Virginia. The Fairfax Citizens' Council, a group opposed to desegregation, publicized Scull's role in the printing of the literature in 1957. Scull was subpoenaed to appear before the Thomson Committee, and subjected to an aggressive series of questions (many of which did not pertain to the committee's legal charge). Scull refused to answer some of these questions, and the committee went to court to force him to answer. A state circuit court ruled against Scull and ordered him to <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions.</b> He refused, and was convicted of contempt of court.|$|E
500|$|When Jefferson took office, {{he moved}} {{as quickly as}} {{possible}} to fill his cabinet positions. Although he had asked James Madison to be his Secretary of State, Madison did not arrive in Washington until May 1, 1801, due to illness. In the interim, Jefferson asked Lincoln to act temporarily as Secretary of State, which he did from March 5, 1801, until Madison assumed his duties on May 2. During this time, Lincoln was involved in actions that led to the celebrated Marbury v. Madison case concerning judicial review. In the later days of the John Adams administration, the President issued a large number of commissions, some of which had not been delivered by John Marshall, his Secretary of State, at the time Jefferson assumed office. Jefferson ordered Lincoln (in his capacity as acting Secretary of State), and then Madison (after his assumption of the position) not to deliver these commissions. Some intended recipients of these commissions, William Marbury among them, filed a suit in the United States Supreme Court to compel their delivery. In his role as Attorney General, Lincoln was present at the preliminary hearing on the case, representing Madison. When the case was heard (ironically by a court headed by John Marshall, the preparer of the commissions), Lincoln was called to the stand by Marbury's attorney, former Attorney General Charles Lee. Rather than answer Lee's questions, Lincoln invoked both executive privilege and the Fifth Amendment, requesting the opportunity to consider whether or not to <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions.</b> The justices granted him time, but {{made it clear that he}} must either <b>answer</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> or clearly justify his objections to specific written questions. When Lincoln returned the next day, he answered all of the posed questions but one. Asked [...] "hat had been done with the commissions", Lincoln refused to answer directly, only stating that he did not know if Madison ever received them. The opposition press criticized Lincoln for this performance, writing that he [...] "was asked a simple question, but could not answer it until they gave it to him in writing, [...] and then he made out to remember that he had forgot all about it".|$|E
