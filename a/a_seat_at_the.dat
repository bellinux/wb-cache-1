On her thirtieth birthday, June 24, 2016, she stated that she completed <b>A</b> <b>Seat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Table, her third studio album {{three days before}} her birthday, on June 21, 2016. The album was released on September 30, 2016, to widespread critical acclaim. It became her first number-one album in the United States. This made her and Beyoncé the first sisters to have both had US number-one albums in a calendar year. On October 3, 2016, Knowles went on to release two music videos from <b>A</b> <b>Seat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Table: Don't Touch my Hair and Cranes in the Sky; both co-directed by herself and husband, Alan Ferguson.|$|E

At Smalls Paradise, patrons could also reserve <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> club by paying a yearly fee. Many regular visitors of Harlem's night clubs also found the food better at Smalls Paradise than at either The Cotton Club or Connie's Inn. While most of the night spots shut their doors between 3 and 4 am, Smalls Paradise began breakfast dances at 6 am with a floor show of up to 30 dancers and a full jazz band.|$|E
5|$|By {{the fall}} of 1918, the Greeks, with over 300,000 soldiers, were the single largest {{component}} of the Allied army on the Macedonian front. The Greek army gave the much needed advantage to the Allies that altered the balance {{between the two sides}} on the Macedonian front. On 14 September 1918, under the command of French General Franchet d'Esperey, a combined Greek, Serbian, French and British force launched a major offensive against the Bulgarian and German army. After the first serious battle (see battle of Skra) the Bulgarian army gave up their defensive positions and began retreating towards their country. On 29 September, the armistice with Bulgaria was signed by the Allied command. The Allied army pushed north and defeated the remaining German and Austrian forces. By October 1918 the Allied armies had recaptured all of Serbia and were preparing to invade Hungary. The offensive was halted because the Hungarian leadership offered to surrender in November 1918, marking the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian empire. This ended the First World War since Germany lacked forces to stop the Allies from invading Germany from the south. The participation of the Greek army at the Macedonian front was one of the decisive event of the war, earning Greece <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Paris Peace Conference under Venizelos.|$|E
5|$|The {{hijacking}} {{occurred on}} board Braathens SAFE Flight 139 {{en route from}} Trondheim Airport, Værnes to Oslo Airport, Fornebu. The aircraft was a Boeing 737–205, named Harald Gille (after Harald IV of Norway) with registration LN-SUG. The day before the hijacking, Huseby graduated from upper secondary school, where he studied health and social work. That evening, he purchased an air gun in Trondheim. The weapon was in his hand luggage when boarding the aircraft at Trondheim Airport, Værnes, {{where there was no}} security control. He selected <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> rear of the aircraft. While airborne, the hijacker showed a female flight attendant the air gun, and asked her to inform the captain that he wanted control over the aircraft, but that otherwise all was to proceed as planned. The flight attendant and later the hijacker used the intercom to communicate with the pilot. The police were informed about the incident via air controllers at 15:05.|$|E

5|$|Working in his {{laboratory}} {{to develop new}} corrosion-resistant metals for auto parts, Haynes discovered that mixing tungsten with chromium, steel and iron resulted {{in the formation of}} strong and lightweight alloys that were impervious to corrosion, and could endure high temperatures. In 1912, he formed Haynes Stellite Company to produce one of the new alloys, and received lucrative contracts during World War I, making Haynes a millionaire in 1916. He sold his patent for stainless steel to the American Stainless Steel Company in exchange for enough stock to gain <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> company's board of directors, a position he held for 12 years. He merged the Haynes Stellite company with Union Carbide in 1920. After passing through different owners, the company was renamed and is now called Haynes International. Haynes returned his focus to his automotive company, but in the economic recession of the 1920s the business went bankrupt and was liquidated.|$|E

25|$|He {{became a}} member of the Royal Galician Academy in 1933, and shortly after that, in 1935, he was forced into exile by the Spanish {{government}} to the Spanish city of Badajoz, in Extremadura, where he worked as a civil servant. It was then where he began to write what would become his key work, Sempre en Galiza. In 1936 he gained <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Spanish parliament, this time representing the Popular Front coalition, which included the Galicianist Party.|$|E
25|$|The Turko-German embassy withdrew in 1916, but {{not before}} it had {{convinced}} Habibullah that Afghanistan was an independent nation which should not remain beholden to the British. Following {{the closure of the}} World War, Habibullah petitioned the British for favours resulting from Afghanistan's alleged assistance to the British during the war. These favours included the recognition of Afghanistan's independence and <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Versailles Peace Conference. Britain refused both these requests. Habibullah sought to open further negotiations but before these could progress he was assassinated.|$|E

He {{became a member of}} the UDSR party. In January 1947, he joined the cabinet as War Veterans Minister. He held various offices in the Fourth Republic as a Deputy and as a Minister (holding eleven different portfolios in total), including as a mayor of Château-Chinon from 1959 to 1981.|$|E
25|$|A Turco-German mission left Kabul in 1916. By that time, however, it had {{successfully}} convinced Habibullah that Afghanistan was an independent nation {{and that it}} should be beholden to no one. With the end of the First World War, Habibullah sought to gain reward from the British government for his assistance during the war. Looking for British recognition of Afghanistan's independence in foreign affairs, he demanded <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Versailles Peace Conference in 1919. This request was denied by the Viceroy, Frederic Thesiger, 1st Viscount Chelmsford, on the grounds that attendance at the conference was confined to the belligerents. Further negotiations were scheduled, but before they could begin Habibullah was assassinated on 19 February 1919.|$|E
25|$|In 1873 Pasteur {{was elected}} to the Académie Nationale de Médecine and was made the {{commander}} in the Brazilian Order of the Rose.

25|$|After Ida {{retired in}} 1959, and Pollina was demoted, Angelo Bruno was {{appointed}} by the Commission to run the Philadelphia family. Bruno, the first boss of Philadelphia with <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Commission, was a close ally of Carlo Gambino, solidifying his position {{as leader of the}} Philadelphia Mafia. Bruno used his contacts and his own business mind to maintain respect and power among other Mafia bosses in the country. He expanded the family's profit and operations in Atlantic City, which had now become known as the Philadelphia family's turf. Bruno himself avoided the intense media and law enforcement scrutiny and kept violence down. He spent almost three years in prison for refusing to testify at a 1970 hearing on organized crime in the state of New Jersey. After his release, he spent some time in Italy before returning to the United States in 1977.|$|E
25|$|In 1917 Siam {{declared}} war on German Empire and Austria-Hungary, mainly to gain favour with the British and the French. Siam's token participation in World War I secured it <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Versailles Peace Conference, and Foreign Minister Devawongse used this opportunity to argue for {{the repeal of the}} 19th century unequal treaties and the restoration of full Siamese sovereignty. The United States obliged in 1920, while France and Britain delayed until 1925. This victory gained the king some popularity, but it was soon undercut by discontent over other issues, such as his extravagance, which became more noticeable when a sharp postwar recession hit Siam in 1919. There was also the fact that the king had no son. He obviously preferred the company of men to women (a matter which of itself did not much concern Siamese opinion, but which did undermine the stability of the monarchy due to the absence of heirs).|$|E
25|$|According {{to recent}} {{published}} studies, the first government in 1917 {{was funded by}} the German Empire which provided two million dollars because Sun had opposed China's entry into the First World War. The money allowed Sun to bribe the northern navy to defect and pay for the salaries of the National Assembly. He also used the money to buy the loyalty of the southwest due to the nearly mercenary nature of the warlords. Relations with the Germans became strained when it was revealed that they had supported the Manchu Restoration and that Sun refused to cooperate in the Hindu-German Conspiracy. With KMT activists being arrested abroad and Germany losing the war, Sun declared war against the Central Powers in the vain hope of garnering recognition and <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Paris Peace Conference but the seat went to the Beiyang government instead. After the assassination of Tang Hualong by a Nationalist in Canada, several KMT overseas branches were banned. Sun Yat-sen also relied on gambling and selling opium to pay for his government which lacked practical revolutionary spirit.|$|E
