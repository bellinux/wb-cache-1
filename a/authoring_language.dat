50|$|An <b>authoring</b> <b>language</b> is a {{programming}} language used to create tutorials, computer-based training courseware, websites, CD-ROMs and other interactive computer programs. Authoring systems (packages) generally provide high-level visual tools that enable a complete system to be designed without writing any programming code, although the <b>authoring</b> <b>language</b> is there for more in-depth usage.|$|E
50|$|An {{authoring}} system usually includes an <b>authoring</b> <b>language,</b> {{a programming language}} built (or extended) with functionality for representing the tutoring system. The functionality offered by the <b>authoring</b> <b>language</b> may be programming functionality for use by programmers or domain representation functionality for use by subject experts. There is overlap between authoring languages with domain representation functionality and domain-specific languages.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{the concept of}} hypermedia connectors, presenting how spatio-temporal synchronization relations may {{be defined as a}} specialization of architecture description language (ADL) connectors. Some features found in ADLs were brought to hypermedia <b>authoring</b> <b>languages,</b> giving first-class status to relations expressed by links. Among the profits, we can highlight the possibility of reusing a spatio-temporal relation specification in different links with the same behavior and the possibility of defining composite spatio-temporal relations expressed by links, which is an original feature in hypermedia <b>authoring</b> <b>languages.</b> ...|$|R

Device-specific characteristics of a web site are captured separately {{as a set of}} policies that tailor the user experience to the particular type of device being used.

5000|$|In {{the field}} of digital and {{interactive}} television, Nested Context Language (NCL) is a declarative <b>authoring</b> <b>language</b> for hypermedia documents. NCL documents do not contain multimedia elements such as audio or video content; rather they function as a [...] "glue" [...] language that specifies how multimedia components are related. In particular, NCL documents specify how these components are synchronized relative {{to each other and}} how the components are composed together into a unified document. Among its main facilities, it treats hypermedia relations as first-class entities through the definition of hypermedia connectors, and it can specify arbitrary semantics for a hypermedia composition using the concept of composite templates.|$|E
5000|$|In early 1987 Tom Hudson {{extended}} the application {{and it was}} renamed Cyber Studio CAD-3D v.2.02 [...] The name Cyber Studio was proposed by Antic Software publisher Gary Yost due to his interest in William Gibsons seminal 1984 book [...] "Neuromancer" [...] which had introduced the term Cyberspace to describe a virtual 3D environment. [...] As of 1987 the software was packaged together with Cybermate, a Forth-based <b>authoring</b> <b>language</b> written by Tektronix engineer Mark Kimball, {{the creator of the}} StereoTek liquid crystal shutter 3D glasses that Antic Software sold as an add-on to Cyber Studio. Cybermate was used to edit, sequence and present the animation files along with sound. The scripts allowed an operator to control when and how fast a video or audio segment played and whether it should loop. In combination with the other scripting language, CyberControl, users were capable to create video animations up to five minutes long.|$|E

30|$|This paper {{presents}} TAL (Template <b>Authoring</b> <b>Language),</b> an <b>authoring</b> <b>language</b> for hypermedia document templates. Templates describe document {{families with}} structural or semantic similarities among them. TAL supports {{the description of}} templates independently of the target hypermedia <b>authoring</b> <b>language.</b> The paper also presents a TAL processor that generates complete hypermedia documents taking as input a template specification in TAL and a data file with the information that makes that document particular in its family.|$|E

30|$|In {{this paper}} we present TAL: Template <b>Authoring</b> <b>Language.</b> TAL is a modular {{declarative}} language {{that supports the}} specification of templates: incomplete hypermedia compositions. TAL defines a family (a set) of compositions, and it is independent of any <b>authoring</b> <b>language</b> used to specify hypermedia applications that benefit from TAL compositions to define a particular member of the template family. In the paper, we also present a TAL processor, developed to instantiate final hypermedia documents (application specifications) from TAL templates.|$|E
