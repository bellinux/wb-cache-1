40|$|Patients {{with severe}} {{critical}} limb ischemia (CLI) due to long tibial artery occlusions are often poor candidates for surgical revascularization and frequently {{end up with}} a lower limb amputation. Subintimal angioplasty (SA) offers a minimally invasive alternative for limb salvage in this severely compromised patient population. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the results of SA in patients with CLI caused by long tibial occlusions who have no surgical options for revascularization and are facing amputation. We retrospectively reviewed all consecutive patients with CLI due to long tibial occlusions who were scheduled for amputation because they had no surgical options for revascularization and who were treated by SA. A total of 26 procedures in 25 patients (14 males; mean age, 70  ±  15 [SD] years) were evaluated. Technical success rate was 88 % (23 / 26). There were four complications, which were treated conservatively. Finally, in 10 of 26 limbs, no amputation was needed. A major amputation was needed in 10 limbs (7 below-knee <b>amputations</b> and 3 <b>above-knee</b> <b>amputations).</b> Half of the major amputations took place within 3  months after the procedure. Cumulative freedom of major amputation after 12  months was 59 % (SE =  11 %). In six limbs, amputation was limited to a minor amputation. Seven patients (28 %) died during follow-up.

40|$|AbstractPurpose: Morbidly obese {{patients}} who sustained popliteal vascular injury after spontaneous knee dislocation (KD) were studied. Methods: Seven morbidly obese patients (body mass index [BMI] > 35 kg/m 2 and > 100 lb over ideal body weight) who sustained spontaneous KD while upright were reviewed. Results: Severe popliteal arterial injury accompanied all spontaneous KD. The {{mean age of}} patients was 34. 1 ± 6. 7 years; the mean weight was 354 ± 150 lb (range, 220 – 702 lb); and mean BMI was 53 ± 21 kg/m 2 (range, 37 – 98. 4). All had arterial avulsion and thrombosis. Three had concomitant venous injury. All underwent operative repair. Morbid obesity presented unique challenges to surgical management. Limited positioning, specialized operative tables, large incisions, deep exposure, special retraction, long operative times (mean, 537 ± 134 minutes), and major blood loss (mean, 2. 5 ± 3 L) were standard. Five arterial injuries were repaired with interposition vein grafts, and 2 required tibial bypass. Venous repairs included thrombectomy and primary repair (n = 2) and interposition grafting (n = 1). Many complications were related to morbid obesity, including deep wound infection (n = 3), diabetic ketoacidosis (n = 2), and cor pulmonale from sleep apnea (n = 1). Despite patent grafts in all patients, 2 <b>above-knee</b> <b>amputations</b> were required for extensive neuromuscular loss. Conclusion: Morbid obesity is a specific risk factor for spontaneous KD and vascular injury. In addition, morbid obesity presents unique challenges to operative repair and predisposes patients to unusual major postoperative complications. (J Vasc Surg 1998; 28 : 458 - 63. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjective: Cartilage {{swelling}} is {{an early}} event in osteoarthritis (OA). However, the response of chondrocytes to increased tissue hydration is unknown. This work studied the volume and morphology of living in situ human chondrocytes {{as a function of}} cartilage degeneration. Methods: The tibial plateaus from knee joints of 40 patients were obtained following <b>above-knee</b> <b>amputations</b> or knee arthroplasty, and degree of cartilage degeneration from 0 (non-eroded) to 3 (extensive fibrillations) was assessed using several criteria. In situ chondrocytes were labeled with fluorescent indicators (calcein for living cells, propidium iodide for dead cells) permitting the quantification of volume and visualisation of morphology of cells within the cartilage zones by confocal scanning laser microscopy (CLSM). Results: Chondrocyte volume within superficial and mid-zones, but not of deep zone cells, increased significantly (P< 0. 05 and P< 0. 02, respectively; one-way analysis of variance), with degree of cartilage hydration and degeneration. The volume increase (∼ 90 % for mid-zone chondrocytes, grade 3 cartilage) was greater than that which might occur following loss/excision of sub-chondral bone (< 15 % swelling). The CLSM technique utilised here revealed that approximately 40 % of chondrocytes within all cartilage grades exhibited at least one cytoplasmic processes of < 8 μm. The presence of these processes did not indicate a cell body of larger volume than cells without processes, and did not contribute to cell volume. Conclusions: The volume of in situ chondrocytes within the superficial and mid-zones increased with cartilage degeneration. Cell swelling was greater than that expected from the increased hydration in OA, suggesting that an increase in chondrocyte volume might {{play a role in the}} changes to matrix metabolism occurring in OA...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectives: {{to study}} the {{postoperative}} course, mobility, housing conditions and the mortality following bilateral amputations in patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAD). Design: part retrospective, part prospective open study. Setting: vascular unit of a university hospital. Patients: sixty-six consecutive patients with PAD undergoing bilateral trans-metatarsal (TM), below-knee, through-knee and <b>above-knee</b> <b>amputations</b> between 1980 and 1989 were studied. Their medium are {{at the time of}} an amputation in the second limb was 58 years (range 27 - 91 years). Chief Outcome Measures: initial and subsequent amputation levels, co-morbidity, mobility, housing conditions and mortality were recorded from 1989 until 2001. Main Results: follow-up was 98 %. Hospital mortality after amputation of the second leg was 12 %. The mortality after 2 years was 38 % and after 5 years 69 %. At the end of the observation period, truly three patients were still alive (15 %). Coronary heart disease was {{the leading cause of death}} and accounted for 37 %, cerebro-vascular incidents for 14 %. During follow-up, 56 % of the patients needed at least one stump revision or reamputation to a higher level. Reamputations occurred after TM in 63 %, below-knee in 42 % and/through-knee amputations in 69 %, respectively. Of 58 patients who were discharged, 38 % became able to walk, 52 % were mobile with a wheelchair and 10 % remained bedridden. Of the patients who were able to walk, 82 % returned to individual homes as compared to 63 % of those who were mobile with a wheelchair. Conclusions: amputation levels should be kept as distal as possible in the interest of mobility which is one of the primary keys to social reintegration. However reamputations to higher levels are frequent as PAD progresses. The well-known very high mortality is clearly related to generalised atherosclerosis.

40|$|Mobility and {{participation}} in physical activity is of primary importance for children with limb absence or loss. A prosthetic knee joint is an essential facilitator of this, providing controlled articulation to enable sitting, standing, and natural, safe and efficient movements during mobility. Despite recent and notable improvements in adult above-knee prosthetic technologies, prosthetic knee joints for children and youth provide only very basic functions. As such, in this thesis, structured design processes and empirically-driven biomechanical models were used to aid the design and development of novel knee control systems intended to improve elements of prosthetic knee joint function, while quantitative gait analysis and self-report measures were employed to assess functional outcomes. In this thesis {{an examination of the}} design considerations for selecting the type of prosthetic knee joint mechanism is provided, and the important functional requirements of paediatric prosthetic knees established. From this, a basis for configuring a simple single-axis mechanism to provide the advantageous functions of more complex, multi-linkage mechanisms, and the important elements of stance-phase control function were established. Subsequently, a novel stance-phase mechanism is presented and evaluated as part of a crossover design field trial utilizing a self-report measure. The results of long-term field-testing are also reported. In this thesis, guidelines for obtaining reliable intra-session measures of impaired gait using quantitative techniques, provided the basis for the quantitative gait assessments that were used to compare the gait performance of the new stance-phase controlled prosthetic knee joint and conventional high-end paediatric knee joint technologies. The latter part of the thesis examined the other aspect of prosthetic knee joint control, namely swing-phase control. A unique technical solution is presented that circumvents some of the problems of conventional fluid-based swing-phase controllers. The performance of a prototype of the new swing-phase control mechanism is evaluated during gait, involving a sample of young individuals with <b>above-knee</b> <b>amputations.</b> The final chapter provides a discussion and summary of this work and its broader implications, including application to other patient populations...|$|R

Results :Overall 30 -day mortality was 8. 6 %, worse for AKA (16. 5 %) than BKA (5. 7 %) patients (P<. 001). Thirty-day mortality for guillotine amputation for sepsis control was 14. 3 % compared with 7. 8 % for closed amputation (P = 3 D. 03). Complications included cardiac (10. 2 %), wound infection (5. 5 %), and pneumonia (4. 5 %). Twelve AKA (4. 7 %) and 129 BKA (18. 4 %) limbs required subsequent operation. Only 66 BKAs (9. 4 %) required conversion to AKA (average, 77. 1 days postoperatively). Overall survival was 69. 7 % and 34. 7 % at 1 and 5 years, respectively. Survival was significantly worse for AKAs (50. 6 % and 22. 5 %) than BKAs (74. 5 % and 37. 8 %) (P<. 001).

An administrative database (Nationwide Inpatient Sample, 1988 - 2000) and a single institution (1992 - 2000) were reviewed using the International Classification of Diseases, 9 th ed., Clinical Modification, codes for CVI, excluding phlegmasia and concomitant peripheral vascular occlusive disease codes. Demographics, clinical course, and outcomes were as-sessed. Descriptive, univariate, and multivariate statistical analyses were used; p < 0. 05 was considered significant. Nationally, CVI occurred with a mean incidence of 92 / 100, 000 admis-sions, of which 55 % were women, having a mean age of 65 years and a median length of stay of 7 days. Mean hospital charges were $ 13, 900 and did not change significantly over time. Acute deep vein thrombosis affected 1. 3 %, amputation was performed in 1. 2 %, and in-hospital mor-tality was 1. 6 % The local cohort included 67 patients with a mean age of 51 years; a majority were men (60 %), and 85 % were C 6 (of Clinical-Etiologic-Anatomic-Pathophysiology [CEAP]). Patients averaged 23 clinic visits and a median of one hospitalization for CVI care over a 44 -month follow-up. Twelve patients (18 %) underwent a CVI-related amputation (one transmeta-tarsal amputation, nine below-knee <b>amputations,</b> and two <b>above-knee</b> <b>amputations).</b> They had fourfold more CVI-related hospitalizations, greater preoperative chronic narcotic use than non-amputee patients (85 % vs. 58 %), but less ongoing wound care needs (25 % vs. 89 %) (all p values < 0. 05). However, no significant difference in long-term mortality, number of clinic visits, duration of symptoms, antibiotic courses, or prior venous-related surgeries was found. In those with amputation, ambulatory status was maintained in 75 % at 15 -month follow-up. The phy-siological and economic costs of severe CVI are significant and have not decreased over more than a decade. Amputation for CVI-related nonhealing wounds has a reasonable outcome. Future therapy must focus on prevention of CVI sequelae...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundFew options {{other than}} {{amputation}} exist for some patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAD) and severe anatomical limitations. MethodsThis prospective study presents short-term results of dual intramuscular and intra-arterial autologous bone marrow mononuclear cell (BM-MNC) implantation {{for the treatment}} of patients with severe PAD in whom amputation was considered the only viable treatment option. Baseline, two-week, and three-month evaluations were conducted. Ankle brachial indices (ABI) were calculated for both the dorsal pedis and the posterior tibial arteries. Rest pain and ulcer healing also were assessed. Success was defined as meeting the following four criteria: improvement in ABI measurements; relief of rest pain; ulcer healing, if applicable; and absence of major limb amputations. Patients not undergoing major limb amputations continued to be monitored for subsequent procedures. ResultsNine patients for whom limb amputation was recommended underwent this procedure. The study population was comprised of five females and four males, {{with a mean age of}} 61. 7 years. Eight (88. 9 %) patients had rest pain. Seven (77. 8 %) patients also had diabetes. Non-healing ulcers were present in eight (88. 9 %) cases. After the procedure, non-significant improvements of 0. 12 and 0. 08 in ABI were observed for the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial ankle arteries, respectively. Three (33. 3 %) major amputations subsequently were performed, including a below-knee amputation 4. 1 weeks after the BM-MNC implantation and two <b>above-knee</b> <b>amputations</b> at 5. 4 and 11. 0 weeks after the procedure. The six (66. 7 %) patients who did not have major amputations demonstrated improvement in symptom severity three months after the procedure, as evidenced by alleviation of rest pain and improvements by at least one level in Rutherford and Fontaine classifications, and have not required amputations at a mean follow-up of 7. 8 months. Complete wound healing was achieved within three months in all patients who had ulcers prior to BM-MNC implantation and for whom amputation was not required. This specific BM-MNC implantation technique was fully successful in three (33. 3 %) patients, as major amputation was avoided and the other applicable criteria were met. Five (55. 6 %) additional patients demonstrated success in at least one of the four criteria. ConclusionsWith eight (88. 9 %) of nine patients showing some level of improvement and amputation avoided in six (66. 7 %) patients, these short-term results indicate the use of BM-MNC implantation as a means of limb salvage therapy for patients with severe PAD shows promise in postponing or avoiding amputation in a patient population currently presented with few alternatives to amputation...|$|R
40|$|Every year, {{thousands}} of <b>above-knee</b> <b>amputations</b> {{are carried out}} around the world due to circulatory problems, complications of diabetes, or trauma. The loss in mobility results in a degradation {{of the quality of}} life of the amputees. Therefore, there is a real need to develop an efficient lower limb prosthesis to restore mobility functions. The current trends in knee prostheses research are limited to either purely passive (mechanical), actively controlled using adaptive damping, or actively driven (powered) knee prostheses. Attempts to develop actively powered knee prostheses have sought to completely replace the muscle activity with an actuator. However, they do not take into consideration the fact that the human muscle works either passively or actively according to the phase or task. Hence, there is a lack of research in developing a prosthetic knee based on a hybrid approach (semi-active), which behaves closely to the natural functioning of a limb. This research involves the design and development of a novel electromechanical semi-active prosthetic knee that is back-driveable when operating passively under the influence of gravity. It also takes advantage of the dynamic coupling interaction between the amputee's stump and the prosthetic knee. The mechanism is driven in active mode via a de permanent magnet motor and a ball screw. In addition, this mechanism is back-driven by either the gravity forces or the dynamic coupling energy in the passive mode. This research, based on extensive investigations, provides the key design factors and parameters that affect the prosthetic knee performance. The assembly modes, the governing kinematic and dynamic relationships of the proposed knee mechanism are presented. The research also covers the study of the energy reflected from the hip to the prosthetic knee due to the dynamic coupling effect. This dynamic coupling is generated due to the change in the kinetic, and the potential energies of the segments and it is controlled by the kinematic parameters of the hip. A finite element model (FEA) was developed for the CAD model, and normative data for the ground reaction forces and the knee trajectory for level ground walking were applied and imported to the model. The FEA was used to VI check the von Mises stress in addition to the factor of safety for the main parts and components under the required loads and trajectories. A prototype of the proposed system was then manufactured. Experiments were carried out on the prosthetic knee for three prosthesis weights to characterise its performance in both open and closed loops for the active mode. Furthermore, the passive mode performance was tested for three prosthesis weights and braking (damping) scenarios due to braking torques. Furthermore, the dynamic coupling effect was tested, and the results showed that the energy generated by dynamic coupling helps to reduce the power consumption by the motor in the active mode if it works in the same direction. This leads to more efficient lower limb prostheses, and paves the way to significant improvements in prosthetic knees. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
