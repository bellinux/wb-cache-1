40|$|This {{research}} studies the <b>accessibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>grocery</b> stores to university students using the public transportation system, drawing from {{a case study}} of Fargo, North Dakota. Taking into consideration the combined travel time components of walking, riding, and waiting, this study measures two types <b>of</b> accessibilities: <b>accessibility</b> to reach a particular place and accessibility to reach the bus stop to ride the public transit system. These two accessibilities are interdependent and cannot perform without each other. A new method to calculate the average accessibility measure for the transit routes is proposed. A step-wise case study analysis indicates that one route provides accessibility to a grocery store in eight minutes. This also suggests that the North Dakota State University area has moderate accessibility to grocery stores...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} {{community}} and built environments is integrally linked to independence, participation, and mobility for older adults. This capstone project reviews literature that explores the <b>accessibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>grocery</b> stores based on their location within the community and their interior built environments. The results indicate a trend towards fewer grocery stores in areas of low SES and population density, and they identify barriers and facilitators related to shelving, signage, labels, way finding, aisles, lighting, noise level, flooring, shopping carts, in store seating, lighting, and check outs. The evidence highlights issues such as income, availability of transportation, the utility of universal design features, to promote independence in grocery shopping for older adults who wish to age in place. This paper builds upon Lawton and Nahemow’s Ecological model of Aging and proposes a conceptual model that shows how location and interior-built environments are linked to independent grocery shopping...|$|R

40|$|Since the mid-century {{proliferation}} of public housing, {{policy makers and}} environmental justice advocates have exposed the fact that geographically and economically isolated public housing sites are ultimately detrimental to residents and communities. In recent years, more progressive housing policies have {{emphasized the importance of}} site location in the success of housing programs. This study explores the intersection of affordable housing policy and “food desert” research, by assessing the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program in California, with specific attention to the grocery store category within the Site Amenities section. Since the inception of the LIHTC program in 1986, the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee (CTCAC) has made multiple revisions to its application process. The study evaluates the current <b>accessibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>grocery</b> stores from LIHTC sites in Alameda and Santa Clara Counties in Northern California. It also critiques the changes in application scoring, criteria, and the indicators of food facility proximity and quality, identifying weaknesses, recommendations, and areas for further research. It finds that despite CTCAC’s efforts to improve the effectiveness of the application, there does not seem to improvement in grocery store access over time. Further {{research is needed to determine}} whether this condition is a result of a failure on the part of the application process, or of high land costs and limited availability of developable land...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Individual Interdisciplinary Doctoral Program, Washington State UniversityThe {{objective}} of this dissertation is to investigate food deserts, develop valid and reliable measures <b>of</b> <b>accessibility</b> to healthy foods, and offer strategies to mitigate the problem. The food we eat is shaped by both social and economic forces. Food systems incorporate everything from environmental conditions, to the communities that grow it, to their paths from farm to table. Thus, the study of food desert is inherently interdisciplinary and requires scholarly flexibility {{to make sense of}} it. This dissertation seeks to provide the needed flexibility by drawing from the disciplines of economics, marketing, and statistics. The first study offers a theoretical analysis that draws from traditional location theory to explore the influences of producer motivations for locating in urban areas. The second study evaluates the spatial <b>accessibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>grocery</b> retailers by examining racial composition, poverty, and income. The chapter outlines a conceptual model of behavior as it flows to preferences, intentions, and behaviors in the process of location choices. A section focuses on the spatial location variation of the retail formats (e. g. food facilities), but a significant portion also addresses consumer behavior. This chapter explores whether this leads to a more equitable distribution of healthy food options. The third study examines grocery retailer's location with a geographic information system data set to understand the impact of location. It continues the thread of the dissertation with a transportation-costs approach of food deserts that addresses the Maximal Service Area Problem.

40|$|Market Creek Plaza is an {{innovative}} public-private partnership that generated a $ 20 -million, 10 acre commercial center in Southeast San Diego {{built on the}} site of an abandoned aerospace factory and community eyesore. 1 Initiated with the purchase of the site in 1998 by the Jacobs Center for Neighborhood Innovation (JCNI), a nonprofit organization that operates on the premise that residents must own and drive the change in their communities for it to be meaningful, Market Creek Plaza is now fully leased and completely open. When the Plaza’s 57, 000 square foot Food 4 Less Supermarket opened, it ended a twenty year absence <b>of</b> <b>grocery</b> <b>services</b> in the community. 2 PolicyLink has documented the key successes and innovations of this project: • Sixty-nine percent of construction contracts were awarded to local minority-owned enterprises. • Ninety-one percent of the initial Food 4 Less employees were hired from the community to fill unionized jobs with living wages, health care insurance, and pension plans. • Extensive civic participation in all phases of the project. • Resident design of a Neighborhood Corporation that will provide a conduit for returning profits from the Plaza back to the community. 3 The development of Market Creek Plaza was financed through a $ 15 million below-market-rate loan from the New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) Program. NMTC is a federal program created in 2000 to stimulate $ 15 billion dollars in private equity investment in low-income communities. The loan was made possible through a partnership involving JCNI, Clearinghouse CDFI (a community development financial institution), Wells Farg...|$|R

In our pilot study, caregivers residing in a documented Chicago food desert (N = 34, 79 % ethnic minority) received a voucher to use a commercial IGS to purchase groceries for their household. Caregivers most frequently purchased fruits, vegetables, meats, and caloric beverages, and endorsed 4 factors as potentially important determinants of future IGS use.

30|$|To test our hypotheses, we {{developed}} a questionnaire for a consumer survey. Based {{on the results of}} a pilot test, we improved the questionnaire to ensure {{the reliability and validity of}} the scales. The questionnaire contained two sections. Section 1 included questions regarding brand-specific CSR practices in the industry context <b>of</b> <b>grocery</b> stores (<b>service</b> industry) or soft drinks (product industry). Section 2 included questions regarding consumer attitudes: customer satisfaction and customer loyalty for the respective industry context. As the intended contribution is to explore the role of CSR practices in the formation of consumer attitudes and behavioral intentions in a developing country, in contrast to the abundance of extant research on developed countries, we chose to focus on Bolivia as the least developed among the developing countries in the Americas (IMF 2017). This choice ensures a clear focus on a developing country and a marked contrast from the known situation in developed countries.|$|R

Tucson was the main railroad center and soon had a Chinatown with laundries for the general population and a rich mix <b>of</b> restaurants, <b>groceries</b> and <b>services</b> for the residents. Chinese and Mexican merchants and farmers transcended racial differences to form 'guanxi,' which were relations of friendship and trust. Chinese leased land from Mexicans, operated grocery stores, and aided compatriots attempting to enter the United States from Mexico after the Mexican Revolution in 1910. Chinese merchants helped supply General John Pershing's army in its expedition against Pancho Villa. Successful Chinese in Tucson led a viable community based on social integration, friendship, and kinship.|$|R

In our pilot study, caregivers residing in a documented Chicago food desert (N = 34, 79 % ethnic minority) received a voucher to use a commercial IGS to purchase groceries for their household.

IGS programs could {{have a role in}} improving urban food access if they have competitive prices, provide rapid delivery, and incorporate strategies to discourage purchasing of discretionary caloric beverages. Objective Proposals to improve urban food access include providing incentives for new supermarket development, facilitating transportation to existing supermarkets, and using farmers markets and street vendors as supplemental food sources (1 – 4). However, these approaches are costly and face logistical challenges (5, 6). A novel strategy to improve food access involves Internet <b>grocery</b> <b>service</b> (IGS) that delivers healthful foods to the home. IGS is convenient, may overcome potential transportation barriers, and does not require new supermarket construction; however, it does involve delivery fees and requires Internet access.

40|$|Research on grocery {{shopping}} demonstrates that channel decisions, location and product choices {{are shaped by}} socially-embedded practices at the household level and that retailers should {{pay more attention to}} these factors. Socially-embedded practices of various individuals within the same household are illustrated by a range of “day to day” rituals and codes that are seen to deal with a diversity of situations. In this paper, we present the case for a re-conceptualisation of the ‘geographies’ that surround consumer behaviour and decisions relating to the use of e-grocery services and which will better reflect “specific aspects” of store based retailing at the “monadic” decision level. Retailers are encouraged to re-evaluate their provision <b>of</b> online <b>grocery</b> <b>services</b> by acknowledging and integrating local household and decision making into their strategies. We argue that {{it is not just a}} case of creating a new shopping platform but also of nurturing and developing acceptable new practices of shopping that are blended within both the physical, virtual-logistic and household circumstances at the local level. Online retailing models for staple goods such as groceries need to move on to a “next generation” of service provision which reflect the consumer’s ‘real’ engagement with technologies and behaviour. These tend towards evolution and change of perceived local shopping choices that are embedded within household routines and the consumer mindset...|$|R
