40|$|Supernumerary B {{chromosomes}} are optional {{additions to}} the basic set of <b>A</b> <b>chromosomes,</b> and occur in all eukaryotic groups. They differ from the basic complement in morphology, pairing behavior, and inheritance and are not required for normal growth and development. The current view is that B chromosomes are parasitic elements comparable to selfish DNA, like transposons. In contrast to transposons, they are autonomously inherited independent of the host genome and have their own mechanisms of mitotic or meiotic drive. Although B chromosomes were first described a century ago, {{little is known about}} their origin and molecular makeup. The widely accepted view is that they are derived from fragments of <b>A</b> <b>chromosomes</b> and/or generated in response to interspecific hybridization. Through next-generation sequencing of sorted <b>A</b> and B <b>chromosomes,</b> we show that B chromosomes of rye are rich in gene-derived sequences, allowing us to trace their origin to fragments of <b>A</b> <b>chromosomes,</b> with the largest parts corresponding to rye chromosomes 3 R and 7 R.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with the commonly used DNA probes Afa family, 18 S rDNA and pSc 119. 2 showed that the more complex hybridization pattern obtained in T. monococcum relative to bread wheat {{made it possible to}} differentiate the Am and <b>A</b> <b>chromosomes</b> within homoeologous groups 1, 4 and 5. In order to provide additional chromosomal landmarks to discriminate the Am and <b>A</b> <b>chromosomes,</b> the microsatellite repeats (GAA) n, (CAG) n, (CAC) n, (AAC) n, (AGG) n and (ACT) n were tested as FISH probes.

40|$|This review {{presents}} a historical account {{of studies of}} B chromosomes in the genus Brachycome Cass. (synonym: Brachyscome) from the earliest cytological investigations {{carried out in the}} late 1960 s though to the most recent molecular analyses. Molecular analyses provide insights into the origin and evolution of the B chromosomes (Bs) of Brachycome dichromosomatica, a species which has Bs of two different sizes. The larger Bs are somatically stable whereas the smaller, or micro, Bs are somatically unstable. Both B types contain clusters of ribosomal RNA genes that have been shown unequivocally to be inactive {{in the case of the}} larger Bs. The large Bs carry a family of tandem repeat sequences (Bd 49) that are located mainly at the centromere. Multiple copies of sequences related to this repeat are present on the <b>A</b> <b>chromosomes</b> (<b>As)</b> of related species, whereas only a few copies exist in the <b>A</b> <b>chromosomes</b> of B. dichromosomatica. The micro Bs share DNA sequences with the As and the larger Bs, and they also have B-specific repeats (Bdm 29 and Bdm 54). In some cases repeat sequences on the micro Bs have been shown to occur as clusters on the <b>A</b> <b>chromosomes</b> in <b>a</b> proportion of individuals within a population. It is clear that none of these B types originated by simple excision of segments from the <b>A</b> <b>chromosomes.</b> C. R. Leach, A. Houben and J. N. Timmi...|$|R
5|$|The total {{complement}} of genes in an organism or cell {{is known as}} its genome, which may be stored on one or more chromosomes. <b>A</b> <b>chromosome</b> consists of a single, very long DNA helix on which thousands of genes are encoded. The region of the chromosome at which a particular gene is located is called its locus. Each locus contains one allele of a gene; however, members of a population may have different alleles at the locus, each with a slightly different gene sequence.|$|E
5|$|Because many genes {{belonging}} to HLA remain unidentified, positional cloning (a method {{used to identify}} a specific gene, when only its location on <b>a</b> <b>chromosome</b> is known) {{has been used to}} determine that a mucin-like gene is associated with DPB. In addition, diseases caused by identified HLA genes in the DPB-susceptibility region have been investigated. One of these, bare lymphocyte syndrome I (BLS I), exhibits a number of similarities with DPB in those affected, including chronic sinusitis, bronchiolar inflammation and nodules, and the presence of H.influenzae. Also like DPB, BLS I responds favorably to erythromycin therapy by showing a resolution of symptoms. The similarities between these two diseases, the corresponding success with the same mode of treatment, {{and the fact that the}} gene responsible for BLS I is located within the DPB-causing area of HLA narrows the establishment of a gene responsible for DPB. Environmental factors such as inhaling toxic fumes and cigarette smoking are not believed to play a role in DPB, and unknown environmental and other non-genetic causessuch as unidentified bacteria or viruseshave not been ruled out.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{replication}} is for {{the most}} part extremely accurate, however errors (mutations) do occur. The error rate in eukaryotic cells can be as low as 10−8 per nucleotide per replication, whereas for some RNA viruses it can be as high as 10−3. This means that each generation, each human genome accumulates 1–2 new mutations. Small mutations can be caused by DNA replication and the aftermath of DNA damage and include point mutations in which a single base is altered and frameshift mutations in which a single base is inserted or deleted. Either of these mutations can change the gene by missense (change a codon to encode a different amino acid) or nonsense (a premature stop codon). Larger mutations can be caused by errors in recombination to cause chromosomal abnormalities including the duplication, deletion, rearrangement or inversion of large sections of <b>a</b> <b>chromosome.</b> Additionally, DNA repair mechanisms can introduce mutational errors when repairing physical damage to the molecule. The repair, even with mutation, is more important to survival than restoring an exact copy, for example when repairing double-strand breaks.|$|E

50|$|The sex <b>chromosome</b> in <b>a</b> {{human egg}} is always <b>an</b> X <b>chromosome,</b> since <b>a</b> female only has X sex chromosomes.

There are rare exceptions to this rule in which, for example, XX individuals develop as males or XY individuals develop as females. Chromosomes are not the final determinant of sex.

5|$|Recombination allows alleles on {{the same}} strand of DNA to become separated. However, the rate of {{recombination}} is low (approximately two events per chromosome per generation). As a result, genes close together on <b>a</b> <b>chromosome</b> {{may not always be}} shuffled away from each other and genes that are close together tend to be inherited together, a phenomenon known as linkage. This tendency is measured by finding how often two alleles occur together on a single chromosome compared to expectations, which is called their linkage disequilibrium. A set of alleles that is usually inherited in a group is called a haplotype. This can be important when one allele in a particular haplotype is strongly beneficial: natural selection can drive a selective sweep that will also cause the other alleles in the haplotype to become more common in the population; this effect is called genetic hitchhiking or genetic draft. Genetic draft caused by the fact that some neutral genes are genetically linked to others that are under selection can be partially captured by an appropriate effective population size.|$|E
5|$|Transformation, unlike {{transduction}} or conjugation, {{depends on}} numerous bacterial gene products that specifically interact to perform this complex process. In {{order for a}} bacterium to bind, take up and recombine donor DNA into its own chromosome, it must first enter a special physiological state termed competence (see Natural competence). In Bacillus subtilis, about 40 genes are required {{for the development of}} competence. The length of DNA transferred during B. subtilis transformation can be between a third of <b>a</b> <b>chromosome</b> up to the whole chromosome. Transformation appears to be common among bacterial species, and thus far at least 60 species are known to have the natural ability to become competent for transformation. The development of competence in nature is usually associated with stressful environmental conditions, and seems to be an adaptation for facilitating repair of DNA damage in recipient cells.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{predisposition}} for DPB susceptibility {{has been}} localized to two HLA haplotypes (a nucleotide or gene sequence difference between paired chromosomes, {{that is more}} likely to occur among a common ethnicity or trait) common to people of East Asian descent. HLA-B54 is associated with DPB in the Japanese, while HLA-A11 is associated with the disease in Koreans. Several genes within this region of class I HLA are believed to be responsible for DPB, by allowing increased susceptibility to the disease. The common genetic background and similarities in the HLA profile of affected Japanese and Korean individuals were considered in the search for a DPB gene. It was suggested that a mutation of a suspected disease-susceptibility gene located somewhere between HLA-B and HLA-A had occurred on an ancestral chromosome carrying both HLA-B54 and HLA-A11. Further, it is possible that a number of genetic recombination events around the disease locus (location on <b>a</b> <b>chromosome)</b> could have resulted in the disease being associated with HLA-B54 in the Japanese and HLA-A11 in Koreans. After further study, it was concluded that a DPB susceptibility gene is located near the HLA-B locus at chromosome 6p21.3. Within this area, the search for a genetic cause of the disease has continued.|$|E
50|$|Cis acting {{elements}} {{refer to}} mechanisms that {{act on the}} same chromosome they come from, usually either in the same region from which they were produced or a region very close to this origin region. For example, a long non-coding RNA that is produced at one location silences the same or a different location on the same chromosome. Trans acting elements, however, are gene products from one location that act on <b>a</b> different <b>chromosome,</b> either {{the other in a}} chromosomal pair, or on <b>a</b> different <b>chromosome</b> from <b>a</b> separate <b>chromosome</b> pair.

5|$|Heritable {{traits are}} passed from one {{generation}} to the next via DNA, a molecule that encodes genetic information. DNA is a long biopolymer composed of four types of bases. The sequence of bases along a particular DNA molecule specify the genetic information, in a manner similar to a sequence of letters spelling out a sentence. Before a cell divides, the DNA is copied, so that each of the resulting two cells will inherit the DNA sequence. Portions of a DNA molecule that specify a single functional unit are called genes; different genes have different sequences of bases. Within cells, the long strands of DNA form condensed structures called chromosomes. The specific location of a DNA sequence within <b>a</b> <b>chromosome</b> is known as a locus. If the DNA sequence at a locus varies between individuals, the different forms of this sequence are called alleles. DNA sequences can change through mutations, producing new alleles. If a mutation occurs within a gene, the new allele may affect the trait that the gene controls, altering the phenotype of the organism. However, while this simple correspondence between an allele and a trait works in some cases, most traits are more complex and are controlled by quantitative trait loci (multiple interacting genes).|$|E
5|$|The {{karyotype}} in T.talamancae is variable. Samples {{from two}} different localities in Venezuela have 34chromosomes and a fundamental number of 64 chromosomal arms (2n=34, FN=64). Four specimens from another Venezuelan locality each have a different karyotype, {{with the number of}} chromosomes ranging from 40 to 42 and the fundamental number from 66 to perhaps 67. The autosomes (non-sex chromosomes) of the 2n=34 karyotype all have two major arms, but the 2n=40–42 karyotypes include several acrocentric autosomes, which only have one major arm. The 2n=34 karyotype includes two large submetacentric pairs, which have two long arms but one distinctly longer than the other, and one pair of subtelocentric chromosomes, with a long and a much shorter arm, but the 2n=40–42 karyotypes lack the submetacentrics and have another pair of subtelocentrics. Both Robertsonian translocations (fusions of the long arm of one chromosome with the long arm of another and the short arm of the one with the short arm of the other) and pericentric inversions (reversals of part of <b>a</b> <b>chromosome</b> that includes the centromere) are needed to explain {{the difference between the two}} groups.

25|$|The {{differentiation}} of phenotype in heterozygous females is furthered {{by the presence}} of X-inactivation skewing.

40|$|R 2 non-LTR retrotransposons {{exclusively}} insert {{into the}} 28 S rRNA genes of their host, and are expressed by co-transcription with the rDNA unit.

Here {{the structure of the}} E. plorans R 2 element, its abundance relative to the number of rDNA units and its retrotransposition activity were determined. Animals screened from five populations contained on average over 12, 000 rDNA units on their <b>A</b> <b>chromosomes,</b> but surprisingly only about 100 R 2 elements. Monitoring the patterns of R 2 insertions in individuals from these populations revealed only low levels of retrotransposition. The low rates of R 2 insertion observed in E. plorans differ from the high levels of R 2 insertion previously observed in insect species that have many fewer rDNA units. It is proposed that high levels of R 2 are strongly selected against in E. plorans, because the rDNA transcription machinery in this species is unable to differentiate between R 2 -inserted and uninserted units. The B chromosomes of E. plorans contain an additional 7, 000 to 15, 000 rDNA units, but in contrast to the <b>A</b> <b>chromosomes,</b> from 150 to over 1, 500 R 2 elements. The higher concentration of R 2 in the inactive B chromosomes rDNA clusters suggests these chromosomes can act as a sink for R 2 insertions thus further reducing the level of insertions on the <b>A</b> <b>chromosomes.</b> These studies suggest an interesting evolutionary relationship between the parasitic B chromosomes and R 2 elements...|$|R
