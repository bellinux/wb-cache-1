5|$|Although the June 28, 1969, Stonewall riots are {{generally}} considered {{the starting point}} of the modern gay liberation movement, a number of demonstrations and actions took place before that date. These actions, often organized by local homophile organizations but sometimes spontaneous, addressed concerns ranging from anti-gay discrimination in employment and public accommodations to the exclusion of homosexuals from the United States military to police harassment to the treatment of homosexuals in revolutionary Cuba. The early actions have been credited with preparing the gay community for Stonewall <b>and</b> <b>contributing</b> to the riots' symbolic power.|$|E

5|$|In a {{volcanic}} eruption, lava, tephra (volcanic bombs, lapilli, and ash), and various gases are expelled from {{a volcanic}} vent or fissure. While many eruptions only pose dangers to the immediately surrounding area, Earth's largest eruptions {{can have a}} major regional or even global impact, with some affecting the climate <b>and</b> <b>contributing</b> to mass extinctions. Volcanic eruptions can generally be characterized as either explosive eruptions, sudden ejections of rock and ash, or effusive eruptions, relatively gentle outpourings of lava. A separate list is given below for each type.|$|E
5|$|The American defence {{researcher}} Charles Smith identified different {{dimensions of}} Russian military deception. He divided it into multiple types – optical, thermal, radar, radio, sound/silence; multiple environments – aquatic, space, atmosphere – each involving active or passive measures; and organizational aspects – mobility, level, and organization. The levels are the conventional military ones, strategic, operational, and tactical, while organization {{refers to the}} military branch concerned. Finally, Smith identified principles – plausibility, continuity through peace and war, variety, and persistent aggressive activity; <b>and</b> <b>contributing</b> factors, namely technological capability and political strategy.|$|E
5|$|The fishing {{industry}} remains {{an important part}} of the provincial economy, employing 26,000 <b>and</b> <b>contributing</b> over $440 million to the GDP. The combined harvest of fish such as cod, haddock, halibut, herring and mackerel was 150,000tonnes (165,000tons) valued at about $130million in 2006. Shellfish, such as crab, shrimp and clams, accounted for 195,000tonnes (215,000tons) with a value of $316million in the same year. The value of products from the seal hunt was $55million.|$|E

5|$|The {{interest}} cost is another major item of this company's financing. In {{the first few}} years of operation, interest rates were well above market rates. Interest expense stood at around NT$1.3billion per month in April 2008, when THSRC first achieved break-even cash flow, with revenue and cash expenses (which exclude depreciation) both around NT$2.1billion. Interest rates fell in the first half of 2009, reducing interest expenses <b>and</b> <b>contributing</b> to a reduced net loss.|$|E
5|$|Akins played {{high school}} {{football}} at Starkville High School before playing at East Mississippi Community College. He later transferred to Eastern Louisiana University and played for the Warhawks. After going unselected in the 1999 NFL Draft, Akins was signed by the Buffalo Bills of the National Football League but was cut {{before the beginning of}} the regular season. He was signed by the Hamilton Tiger-Cats shortly after and spent his first two seasons moving between the practice squad and the active roster, playing in 9 games each season <b>and</b> <b>contributing</b> heavily on special teams. Akins transitioned to a more offensive role in 2001, but his career was interrupted in later seasons by repeated injuries.|$|E
5|$|Artists such as Albrecht Dürer and Leonardo da Vinci, often {{working with}} naturalists, were also {{interested}} in the bodies of animals and humans, studying physiology in detail <b>and</b> <b>contributing</b> {{to the growth of}} anatomical knowledge. The traditions of alchemy and natural magic, especially in the work of Paracelsus, also laid claim to knowledge of the living world. Alchemists subjected organic matter to chemical analysis and experimented liberally with both biological and mineral pharmacology. This {{was part of a larger}} transition in world views (the rise of the mechanical philosophy) that continued into the 17th century, as the traditional metaphor of nature as organism was replaced by the nature as machine metaphor.|$|E

5|$|In 1904 {{the first}} Ranfurly Shield match was played. The shield, a provincial {{challenge}} trophy won by defeating the holder, {{was to become}} the most prestigious trophy in domestic New Zealand rugby. Due to their unmatched provincial record at the time Auckland were awarded the shield. The first shield challenge was played against Wellington, who were not expected to pose much of a threat. Auckland had not lost at home in six years, but, with Cunningham in the side, Auckland lost 6–3. The second notable match that season was against the touring British Isles who were conducting a tour of Australia and New Zealand. The Aucklanders defeated the British Isles side 13–0, with Cunningham scoring a try <b>and</b> <b>contributing</b> significantly to the dominance of his team's forwards.|$|E
5|$|Jacobson's case {{attracted}} {{some national}} media attention. Civil liberties advocates supported him, worried {{over what they}} saw as dangerous growth in government police powers during the Reagan and Bush administrations, when law enforcement were alleged to have cracked down on drugs as well as pornography distribution {{at the behest of the}} Religious Right. Operation Looking Glass, the USPS claimed, had netted 147 convictions, but only 35 where evidence was found that the offenders had either been involved in producing child pornography or molested children. Critics claimed that the government was exaggerating the child-porn problem at best <b>and</b> <b>contributing</b> to it at worst, possibly by introducing some consumers to material they might never have developed a taste for otherwise.|$|E
5|$|John (24 December 1166– 19 October 1216), {{also known}} as John Lackland (Norman French: Johan sanz Terre), was King of England from 6 April 1199 {{until his death in}} 1216. John lost the Duchy of Normandy to King Philip II of France, {{resulting}} in the collapse of most of the Angevin Empire <b>and</b> <b>contributing</b> to the subsequent growth in power of the Capetian dynasty during the 13th century. The baronial revolt at the end of John's reign led to the sealing of Magna Carta, a document sometimes considered an early step {{in the evolution of the}} constitution of the United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|Lawless was sidelined with a groin injury at the {{beginning}} of the 2013–14 season, and did not make his first start until 17 September in a 3–0 victory against Dartford, in which he scored one goal and set up another. This victory provided the springboard for Luton to embark on a 27-game unbeaten run in the league, in which Lawless was heavily involved, scoring five further times <b>and</b> <b>contributing</b> 10 assists. After playing in 32 games and scoring six goals, including many games in an unfamiliar position as a left midfielder, he missed the final part of the season due to injury. On 15 April 2014, with three games to spare, Luton won the Conference Premier title and were promoted to League Two; this was Lawless' first title and promotion as a player.|$|E
5|$|Mertens claimed another winners' medal on 22 December 2014 after Napoli's penalty {{shoot-out}} {{victory over}} Juventus in the Supercoppa. Despite being predominantly {{used as a}} substitute, he continued his fine form for Napoli {{over the course of}} the next season and a half, netting 10 goals <b>and</b> <b>contributing</b> 11 assists across all competitions in 2014–15, and 11 more goals in 2015–16. His tally in the latter campaign included a brace in Napoli's joint-largest ever winning margin in the Europa League, a 5–0 win over Belgian side Club Brugge. Mertens also scored a second-half hat-trick in a convincing 6–0 victory over Bologna on 19 April 2016.|$|E
5|$|The {{failure of}} the {{supplies}} and reinforcements carried on Thétis to reach the Caribbean may have {{had an effect on}} the outcome of the subsequent invasion of Martinique in January 1809. Except for one reinforcement frigate, Amphitrite, none of the subsequent French efforts to transport supplies or soldiers to Martinique were successful, and a large British expeditionary force was able to overwhelm the island's poorly-supplied defenders in a brief campaign. The tightening blockade also affected other French colonies, preventing the despatch of food and military supplies <b>and</b> <b>contributing</b> to the captures of both Île de France and Guadeloupe in 1810.|$|E

5|$|Until 1976, {{federal tax}} {{incentives}} were virtually non-existent for {{buildings on the}} National Register. Before 1976 the federal tax code favored new construction rather than the reuse of existing, sometimes historical, structures. In 1976, the tax code was altered to provide tax incentives that promote preservation of income-producing historic properties. The National Park Service was given the responsibility to ensure that only rehabilitations that preserved the historic character of a building would qualify for federal tax incentives. A qualifying rehabilitation is one that the NPS deems consistent with the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation. Properties and sites listed in the Register, {{as well as those}} located in <b>and</b> <b>contributing</b> to the period of significance of National Register Historic Districts, became eligible for the federal tax benefits.|$|E
5|$|While the Force 2020 {{plan has}} proven controversial, {{it appears to}} have been adopted by the East Timorese government. The plan was criticised by the United Nations and the governments of Australia and the United States as {{unaffordable}} and in excess of East Timor's needs. East Timorese President José Ramos-Horta defended the plan, however, arguing that its adoption will transform the F-FDTL into a professional force capable of defending East Timor's sovereignty <b>and</b> <b>contributing</b> to the nation's stability. East Timorese defence officials have also stressed that Force 2020 is a long-term plan and does not propose acquiring advanced weapons for some years.|$|E
5|$|Del Piero {{competed with}} fan {{favourite}} Roberto Baggio for an attacking {{spot in the}} starting 11 during the 1998 FIFA World Cup, while struggling to recover from an injury suffered during the 1998 Champions League final with Juventus; Del Piero missed out on Italy's 2–2 opening draw against Chile, and was temporarily replaced by Baggio. He made his first World Cup appearance in the second group match, a 3–0 defeat of Cameroon, coming on for Baggio {{in the second half}}, wearing the number 10 shirt, <b>and</b> <b>contributing</b> to Christian Vieri's final goal. In the final group game against Austria, Del Piero won his first start, setting up Vieri's opening goal of the match from a free-kick as Italy won 2–1 to seal a passage into the next round, avoiding reigning champions Brazil; he was substituted by Baggio in the second half. Italy reached the quarter-finals after defeating Norway 1–0, as Del Piero started the match alongside Vieri once again, coming off for Enrico Chiesa in the 77th minute. Italy eventually fell to hosts and eventual champions France on penalty kicks, following a 0–0 draw; Del Piero was criticised for his performance and was substituted in the second half by Baggio once again.|$|E
