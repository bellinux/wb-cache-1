5|$|Bakshi chose {{rotoscoping}} as {{a cost-effective}} way {{to complete the}} movie's battle scenes with his own finances. Because he {{could not afford to}} hire a film crew or actors, or develop 35mm stock, Bakshi requested prints of films that contained the type of large battle scenes needed, including Sergei Eisenstein's Alexander Nevsky, and spliced together the footage he needed. However, the cost of printing photographs of each frame would have cost $3 million. Learning that IBM had introduced an industrial-sized photocopier, Bakshi <b>asked</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company's technical experts if {{he would be able to}} feed 35mm reels into the machine to produce enlarged copies of each frame. The experiment worked, and Bakshi got the pages he needed for a penny per copy.|$|E

The newspaper also alleged that Oaten had engaged in 'three-in-a-bed' sex sessions with two male prostitutes.

500|$|Male {{survivors}} of the massacre {{have been subjected to}} criticism for not intervening to stop Lépine. In an interview immediately after the event, a reporter <b>asked</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> men why they [...] "abandoned" [...] the women when it was clear that Lépine's targets were women. [...] René Jalbert, the sergeant-at-arms who persuaded Denis Lortie to surrender during his 1984 attack, said that someone should have intervened at least to distract Lépine, but acknowledged that [...] "ordinary citizens cannot be expected to react heroically in the midst of terror." [...] Newspaper columnist Mark Steyn suggested that male inaction during the massacre illustrated a [...] "culture of passivity" [...] prevalent among men in Canada, which enabled Lépine's shooting spree: [...] "Yet the defining image of contemporary Canadian maleness is not M Lepine/Gharbi but the professors and the men in that classroom, who, ordered to leave by the lone gunman, meekly did so, and abandoned their female classmates to their fate—an act of abdication that would have been unthinkable in almost any other culture throughout human history." ...|$|E
500|$|Humber debuted {{with the}} White Sox in their third game in relief. He made two pitches, {{both of which}} {{resulted}} in hits and base runners that came around to score. With Jake Peavy injured {{at the start of}} the 2011 season, the White Sox gave Humber the opportunity to pitch in their starting rotation. On April 9, 2011, Humber won his first start with the White Sox, pitching [...] innings and only allowing one run. Humber surprised the White Sox with his strong performance. On April 25, in the sixth start of his career, he took a no-hitter into the seventh inning against the New York Yankees at Yankee Stadium, but with one out Alex Rodriguez singled up the middle. He finished with seven scoreless innings. He took a no-hitter into the sixth inning against the Washington Nationals on June 26, but ended up earning a 2–1 loss when he surrendered a seventh inning home run to Danny Espinosa. In early July, when he led the major leagues with [...] innings pitched and held an 8–4 record with a 2.69 ERA, he seemed like a probable selection for the 2011 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. In mid-July, the White Sox switched to a six-man rotation. By early August, Humber was in a slump. Humber denies the extra rest affected his pitch command. He spent time on the disabled list with a facial bruise after Kosuke Fukudome lined a baseball into his face above the right eye on August 18. After he was hit, he was very concerned for his wife: [...] "I thought, 'I've got to get up because she's in the stands,'" [...] Humber said. [...] "As soon as I went in , I <b>asked</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> guys to call her to make sure she knew I was OK.", adding [...] "My main concern was cheering up my wife." [...] He appeared in one rehabilitation start for the Charlotte Knights of the Class-AAA International League. Humber pitched seven scoreless innings in his major league return. Humber completed his first full season as an MLB starting pitcher with a 9–9 win–loss record with a 3.75 ERA in 163 innings.|$|E

2500|$|In 1910 Larramendi {{decided to}} run on Traditionalist ticket for the Cortes; as he was {{unrelated}} to Asturias, {{it is not clear}} why he chose the district of Oviedo. Competing against local heavyweights like Melquíades Álvarez and [...] he stood little chance and lost, afterwards appealing corruption and unfair deployment of Guardia Civil. The following year he tried his chances in local elections in Valencia; this time banking on support of local Carlists like [...] and , the latter running a daily Diario de Valencia; the bid proved unsuccessful. In Madrid he engaged in launching a periodical of Traditionalist youth, which eventually materialized as Juventud – Organo de las Juventudes Tradicionalistas. Given lack of broader Carlist base in Madrid the initiative proved to be short-lived, and the weekly was issued in 1912-1913 only. Nevertheless, Larramendi was already well known among conservative youth of the capital: [...] "quién no conoce al simpático y cultisimo Larramendi?" [...] – <b>asked</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> periodicals.

2500|$|Several months later, in February 1924, Judge Thayer <b>asked</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{firearms}} {{experts for}} the prosecution, Capt. Charles Van Amburgh, to reinspect Sacco's Colt and determine its condition. With District Attorney Katzmann present, Van Amburgh took {{the gun from}} the clerk and started to take it apart. Van Amburgh quickly noticed that the barrel to Sacco's gun was brand new, being still covered in the manufacturer's protective rust preventative. Judge Thayer began private hearings to determine who had tampered with the evidence by switching the barrel on Sacco's gun. During three weeks of hearings, Albert Hamilton and Captain Van Amburgh squared off, challenging each other's authority. [...] Testimony suggested that Sacco's gun had been treated with little care, and frequently disassembled for inspection. [...] New defense attorney William Thompson insisted that no one on his side could have switched the barrels [...] "unless they wanted to run their necks into a noose." [...] Albert Hamilton swore he had only taken the gun apart while being watched by Judge Thayer. [...] Judge Thayer made no finding as to who had switched the [...]32 Colt barrels, but ordered the rusty barrel returned to Sacco's Colt. [...] After the hearing concluded, unannounced to Judge Thayer, Captain Van Amburgh took both Sacco's and Vanzetti's guns, along with the bullets and shells involved in the crime to his home where he kept them until a Boston Globe expose revealed the misappropriation in 1960. [...] Meanwhile, Van Amburgh bolstered his own credentials by writing {{an article on the}} case for True Detective Mysteries. [...] The 1935 article charged that prior to the discovery of the gun barrel switch, Albert Hamilton had tried to walk out of the courtroom with Sacco's gun but was stopped by Judge Thayer. [...] Although several historians of the case, including Francis Russell, have reported this story as factual, nowhere in transcripts of the private hearing on the gun barrel switch was this incident ever mentioned. [...] The same year the True Detective article was published, a study of ballistics in the case concluded, [...] "what might have been almost indubitable evidence was in fact rendered more than useless by the bungling of the experts." ...|$|E
