According to Rajab, despite lacking {{a clear understanding of}} what constitutes a culture of human rights or knowledge of human rights standards <b>and</b> <b>norms,</b> he was active within the general Bahraini students union, speaking out against all forms of injustice. He also became involved in international campaigning on specific issues.|$|E
5|$|The Catholic Church {{teaches that}} {{marriage}} is a social and spiritual bond {{between a man and}} a woman, ordered towards the good of the spouses and procreation of children; according to Catholic teachings on sexual morality, it is the only appropriate context for sexual activity. A Catholic marriage, or any marriage between baptised individuals of any Christian denomination, is viewed as a sacrament. A sacramental marriage, once consummated, cannot be dissolved except by death. The Church recognises certain conditions, such as freedom of consent, as required for any marriage to be valid; In addition, the Church sets specific rules <b>and</b> <b>norms,</b> known as canonical form, that Catholics must follow.|$|E

5|$|Adi Shankaracharya (788–820) chose Sringeri in Karnataka to {{establish}} {{the first of his}} four mathas (monastery). Madhvacharya (1238–1317) was the chief proponent of Tattvavada (Philosophy of Reality), popularly known as Dvaita or Dualistic school of Hindu philosophy— one of the three most influential Vedanta philosophies. Madhvacharya was one of the important philosophers during the Bhakti movement. He was a pioneer in many ways, going against standard conventions <b>and</b> <b>norms.</b> According to tradition, Madhvacharya {{is believed to be the}} third incarnation of Vayu (Mukhyaprana), after Hanuman and Bhima. The Haridasa devotional movement is considered as one of the turning points in the cultural history of India. Over a span of nearly six centuries, several saints and mystics helped shape the culture, philosophy and art of South India and Karnataka in particular by exerting considerable spiritual influence over the masses and kingdoms that ruled South India.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the most}} {{powerful}} individual in the Roman Empire, Augustus wished to embody the spirit of Republican virtue <b>and</b> <b>norms.</b> He also wanted to relate to and connect with {{the concerns of the}} plebs and lay people. He achieved this through various means of generosity and a cutting back of lavish excess. In the year 29BC, Augustus paid 400 sesterces each to 250,000 citizens, 1,000 sesterces each to 120,000 veterans in the colonies, and spent 700 million sesterces in purchasing land for his soldiers to settle upon. He also restored 82 different temples to display his care for the Roman pantheon of deities. In 28BC, he melted down 80 silver statues erected in his likeness and in honor of him, an attempt of his to appear frugal and modest.|$|E
5|$|Ginsburg {{has also}} been an {{advocate}} for using foreign law <b>and</b> <b>norms</b> to shape U.S. law in judicial opinions, a view not shared by some of her conservative colleagues. Ginsburg supports using foreign interpretations of law for the persuasive value and possible wisdom, not as precedent which the court is bound to follow. Ginsburg has expressed the view that looking to international law is well-ingrained in tradition in American law, counting John Henry Wigmore and President John Adams as internationalists. Ginsburg's own reliance on international law dates back to her time as an attorney; during her first argument before the court, 1971's Reed v. Reed, she cited two German cases. In her concurring opinion in Grutter v. Bollinger 539 U.S. 306 (2016), a decision upholding Michigan Law School's affirmative action admissions policy, Ginsburg noted there was accord between the notion that affirmative action admissions policies would have an end point and agrees with international treaties designed to combat racial and gender based discrimination.|$|E

We exactly classify the intersection of these two classes, i. e., the class of transition systems which can be equivalently (up to bisimilarity) described by the syntax of <b>normed</b> BPA˙τ <b>and</b> <b>normed</b> BPP˙τ processes. We provide such a characterization for classes of <b>normed</b> BPA <b>and</b> <b>normed</b> BPP processes as well. Next we show that it is decidable in polynomial time whether for a given normed BPA˙τ (or BPP˙τ) process Δ there is some normed BPP˙τ (or BPA˙τ) process Δ such that Δ is bisimilar to Δ. Moreover, {{if the answer is}} positive then the process Δ can be effectively constructed. Simplified versions of the algorithms mentioned above for <b>normed</b> BPA <b>and</b> <b>normed</b> BPP are given too.

5|$|Within the Heathen {{community}} of the United States, gender roles are based upon perceived ideals <b>and</b> <b>norms</b> found in Early Medieval Northwestern Europe, in particular as they are presented in Old Norse sources. Among male American Heathens there is a trend toward hypermasculinized behaviour, while a gendered division of labor—in which men are viewed as providers and women seen as being responsible for home and children—is also widespread among Heathens in the U.S. Due to its focus on traditional attitudes to sex and gender—values perceived as socially conservative in Western nations—it {{has been argued that}} American Heathenry's ethical system is far closer to traditional Christian morals than the ethical systems espoused in many other Western Pagan religions such as Wicca.|$|E
