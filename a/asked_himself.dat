He yearned to dedicate his whole life to unraveling this mystery. His mind was set on finding places where Buddhism was still practiced the way it should be. It was at this point where he decided to become a monastic.|$|E
25|$|Socrates then {{sought to}} solve the divine paradox — that an ignorant man also could be the wisest of all men — in effort to {{illuminate}} {{the meaning of the}} Oracles' categorical statement: that he is the wisest man in the land. After systematically interrogating the politicians, the poets, and the craftsmen, Socrates determined that the politicians were impostors; that the poets did not understand their own poetry; and that the craftsmen, like prophets and seers, did not understand the things they spoke. In that light, Socrates saw himself as spokesman for the Oracle at Delphi (22e). He <b>asked</b> <b>himself</b> if he would rather be an impostor, like the “wise people” he interrogated, or if he would rather be himself, Socrates of Athens. As the defendant under trial, Socrates tells the jury that he would rather be himself than be anyone else. That in searching for a man wiser than himself, his questioning earned him the dubious reputation of social gadfly to the city of Athens.|$|E

[...] Owing to the length of time between the 1883 and 1928 eruptions, Kwee decided to begin his story with the separation of two young siblings.

2500|$|Danny Rubin had {{completed}} and sold his script for Hear No Evil and moved from Chicago to Los Angeles {{to become a}} professional screenwriter around 1990. His agent suggested that he prepare a [...] "calling-card" [...] script that he could use to gain meetings with various producers.

He had <b>asked</b> <b>himself</b> the question [...] "If a person could live forever, if a person was immortal, how would they change over time?" [...] Having this character be immortal and having the world change around them would have been too cumbersome for filming. Instead he came back to a concept he had written down about two years earlier about a man living the same day over and over. With the idea of a person changing over time, this repeating day motif had found its [...] "deeper purpose" [...] within the new script. The two ideas, combined, answered his proverbial question as well as opened up several possibilities of drama and comedy with that framework.|$|E

On the August 28, 2008 episode of Making the Band, Combs, frustrated with the [...] "oversexed" [...] image he felt O'Day now showcased, he called O'Day [...] "one of the worst dancers" [...] in Danity Kane, when she used to be [...] "one of the best." [...] He told O'Day that she no longer looked like the girl he signed. Combs bluntly accused O'Day of trying to expand her fame {{at the expense of the}} entire group, and that she liked flaunting her breasts and wearing big hair. O'Day had boasted about her cleavage to former World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) [...] guru and current SunSport broadband television producer/host Paul Heyman of The Heyman Hustle in order to validate her breasts as natural. In a controversial act, she rubbed her cleavage on Heyman's arm. Furious, Combs <b>asked</b> <b>himself</b> on television why he was keeping O'Day in the group. With O'Day forgoing promotional appearances with the group to appear as Amber Von Tussle on Broadway's Hairspray, speculation arose that O'Day's role in the group had been marginalized.

2500|$|In 1948 Hendrik Casimir {{showed that}} one {{consequence}} of the zero-point field is an attractive force between two uncharged, perfectly conducting parallel plates, the so-called Casimir effect. At the time, Casimir was studying the properties of [...] "colloidal solutions". These are viscous materials, such as paint and mayonnaise, that contain micron-sized particles in a liquid matrix. The properties of such solutions are determined by van der Waals forces – long-range, attractive forces that exist between neutral atoms and molecules. One of Casimir's colleagues, Theo Overbeek, realized that the theory that was used {{at the time to}} explain van der Waals forces, which had been developed by Fritz London in 1930, did not properly explain the experimental measurements on colloids. Overbeek therefore asked Casimir to investigate the problem. Working with Dirk Polder, Casimir discovered that the interaction between two neutral molecules could be correctly described only if the fact that light travels at a finite speed was taken into account. Soon afterwards after a conversation with Bohr about zero-point energy, Casimir noticed that this result could be interpreted in terms of vacuum fluctuations. He then <b>asked</b> <b>himself</b> what would happen if there were two mirrors – rather than two molecules – facing each other in a vacuum. It was this work that led to his famous prediction of an attractive force between reflecting plates. The work by Casimir and Polder opened up the way to a unified theory of van der Waals and Casimir forces and a smooth continuum between the two phenomena. This was done by Lifshitz (1956) in the case of plane parallel dielectric plates. The generic name for both van der Waals and Casimir forces is dispersion forces, because both of them are caused by dispersions of the operator of the dipole moment. The role of relativistic forces becomes dominant at orders of a hundred nanometers.|$|E
