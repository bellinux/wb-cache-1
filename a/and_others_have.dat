5|$|Apart {{from his}} own disciples and followers, the Jews of Jesus' day {{generally}} rejected him as the Messiah, as do {{the great majority of}} Jews today. Christian theologians, ecumenical councils, reformers <b>and</b> <b>others</b> <b>have</b> written extensively about Jesus over the centuries. Christian sects and schisms have often been defined or characterized by their descriptions of Jesus. Meanwhile, Manichaeans, Gnostics, Muslims, Baha'is, <b>and</b> <b>others</b> <b>have</b> found prominent places for Jesus in their religions. Jesus has also had detractors, both past and present.|$|E

5|$|Daniel B. Wallace of the Dallas Theological Seminary <b>and</b> <b>others</b> <b>have</b> {{suggested}} that the fragment {{appears to have been}} intentionally cut, most likely in modern times.

5|$|After its rediscovery, {{observers}} often {{assumed that}} the image was always used as a call to inspire women workers to join the war effort. However, during the war the image was strictly internal to Westinghouse, displayed only during February 1943, and was not for recruitment but to exhort already-hired women to work harder. Feminists <b>and</b> <b>others</b> <b>have</b> seized upon the uplifting attitude and apparent message to remake the image into many different forms, including self empowerment, campaign promotion, advertising, and parodies.|$|E
5|$|Colleagues have testified that, {{far from}} feeling bound or stifled by the Whiteman orchestra, as Green <b>and</b> <b>others</b> <b>have</b> suggested, Bix often {{felt a sense}} of exhilaration.

5|$|Folk {{music is}} {{sometimes}} divided into several spheres of geographic influence, a classification system of three regions, southern, central and northern, proposed by Alan Lomax in 1956 and often repeated. Additionally, Curt Sachs proposed {{the existence of}} two quite distinct kinds of folk music in Europe: continental and Mediterranean, <b>and</b> <b>others</b> <b>have</b> placed the transition zone from the former to the latter roughly in north-central Italy, approximately between Pesaro and La Spezia. The central, northern and southern parts of the peninsula each share certain musical characteristics, and are each distinct from the music of Sardinia.|$|E
5|$|For example, Bina Agarwal <b>and</b> <b>others</b> <b>have</b> critiqued the {{mainstream}} model and helped {{provide a better}} understanding of intra-household bargaining power. Agarwal shows that a lack of power and outside options for women hinders their ability to negotiate within their families. Amartya Sen shows how social norms that devalue women's unpaid work in the household often disadvantage women in intra-household bargaining. These feminist economists argue that such claims have important economic outcomes which must be recognized within economic frameworks.|$|E
5|$|Gryllus firmus {{exhibits}} wing polymorphism; {{some individuals}} have fully functional, long hind wings <b>and</b> <b>others</b> <b>have</b> short wings and cannot fly. The short-winged females have smaller flight muscles, greater ovarian development, and produce more eggs, so the polymorphism adapts the cricket for either dispersal or reproduction. In some long-winged individuals, the flight muscles deteriorate during adulthood and the insect's reproductive capabilities improve.|$|E
