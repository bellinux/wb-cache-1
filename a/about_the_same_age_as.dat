25|$|About {{half of the}} intercrater area {{consists}} of material characterized by a very high density of small, mostly degraded craters, and an irregular to rough surface. Superposition relations suggest that this unit is <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>age</b> <b>as,</b> or older than, all mappable craters and basins. The origin of intercrater plains material is enigmatic; some may be primitive crust, as implied by Trask and Guest, but {{more likely it is}} of mixed origin, dominated by breccias formed by now-unrecognizable ancient craters. Some of the more plainslike areas included within this unit may well have an origin similar to that of intermediate plains material.|$|E

25|$|Agrippa {{was born}} between 64–62 BC, in an {{uncertain}} location. His father was perhaps called Lucius Vipsanius Agrippa. He had an elder brother {{whose name was}} also Lucius Vipsanius Agrippa, and a sister named Vipsania Polla. The family had not been prominent in Roman public life. However, Agrippa was <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>age</b> <b>as</b> Octavian (the future emperor Augustus), and the two were educated together and became close friends. Despite Agrippa's association with the family of Julius Caesar, his elder brother chose another side in the civil wars of the 40s BC, fighting under Cato against Caesar in Africa. When Cato's forces were defeated, Agrippa's brother was taken prisoner but freed after Octavian interceded on his behalf.|$|E
25|$|Cedd is not {{mentioned}} as Chad's companion {{in this stage}} of his education. Probably Cedd was considerably older than Chad, and was ordained priest some years earlier: certainly he was already a priest by 653, when {{he was sent to}} work among the Middle Angles. Chad's companion was Egbert, who was of <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>age</b> <b>as</b> himself. The two travelled in Ireland for further study. Bede tells us that Egbert himself was of the Anglian nobility, although the monks sent to Ireland were of all classes. Bede places Egbert, and therefore Chad, among an influx of English scholars who arrived in Ireland while Finan and Colmán were bishops at Lindisfarne. This means that Egbert and Chad must have gone to Ireland later than the death of Aidan, in 651.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, a study {{ordered by}} Congress found that middle school {{students}} {{who took part in}} abstinence-only sex education programs were just as likely to have sex in their teenage years as those who did not. From 1999 to 2006, the study tracked more than 2,000 students from age 11 or 12 to age 16; the study included students who had participated in one of four abstinence education programs, as well as a control group who had not participated in such a program. By age 16, about half of each group students in the abstinence-only program as well as students in the control group were still abstinent. Abstinence program participants who became sexually active during the 7-year study period reported having similar numbers of sexual partners as their peers of the same age; moreover, they had sex {{for the first time at}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>age</b> <b>as</b> other students. The study also found that students who took part in the abstinence-only programs were just as likely to use contraception when they did have sex as those who did not participate. Abstinence-only education advocates claim the study was too narrow, began when abstinence-only curricula were in their infancy, and ignored other studies that have shown positive effects.|$|E

500|$|Salientia (Latin salere (salio), [...] "to jump") is {{the name}} of the total group that {{includes}} modern frogs in the order Anura as well as their close fossil relatives, the [...] "proto-frogs" [...] or [...] "stem-frogs". The common features possessed by these proto-frogs include 14 presacral vertebrae (modern frogs have eight or 9), a long and forward-sloping ilium in the pelvis, the presence of a frontoparietal bone, and a lower jaw without teeth. The earliest known amphibians that were more closely related to frogs than to salamanders are Triadobatrachus massinoti, from the early Triassic period of Madagascar (about 250 million years ago), and Czatkobatrachus polonicus, from the Early Triassic of Poland (<b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>age</b> <b>as</b> Triadobatrachus). The skull of Triadobatrachus is frog-like, being broad with large eye sockets, but the fossil has features diverging from modern frogs. These include a longer body with more vertebrae. The tail has separate vertebrae unlike the fused urostyle or coccyx in modern frogs. The tibia and fibula bones are also separate, making it probable that Triadobatrachus was not an efficient leaper.|$|E
2500|$|His {{mother is}} known to be Queen Takhat, but who she is exactly is a matter of {{interpretation}} complicated by inscriptions being revised by Seti II and Amenmesse. [...] Among her titles are [...] "King's Daughter", which would make her a daughter of Merenptah or Ramesses II or possibly a granddaughter of Ramesses. [...] The name Takhat appears in a list of princesses dated to Year 53 of Ramesses II (Louvre 666). [...] If this is the same Takhat, she would be <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>age</b> <b>as</b> Seti II.|$|E
2500|$|Ekland {{became famous}} {{overnight}} {{as a result}} of her 1964 whirlwind romance and marriage to English actor and comedian, Peter Sellers, who proposed after seeing her photograph in the paper and then meeting in London. She stood by him after he suffered a series of heart attacks shortly after their marriage. [...] Ekland was stepmother to Sellers' children Sarah and Michael (who died of a heart attack at <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>age</b> <b>as</b> his father). In January 1965 they had a daughter, Victoria. The couple made three films together — A Carol for Another Christmas (1964), After the Fox (1966) and The Bobo (1967) — before divorcing in 1968.|$|E

2500|$|Herbert Godwin Park, {{located at}} 5101 Rutherglen, is {{classified}} as a community park. The Godwin Community Center, on the same lot, has an outdoor pavilion, a playground, and a lighted sports field.

Many mothers and children gather at the park on weekends. Mimi Swartz of the Texas Monthly said [...] "he grass is shorn and green, the playground equipment freshly painted and sturdy.

2500|$|On 1 May 1833, Koerner {{boarded a}} ship in Le Havre sailing to North America {{with a group}} of emigrants headed by the patriarch of the Engelmann family, whose son Theodor was an old friend of his from college. On the passage he became engaged to his future wife Sophie, a {{daughter}} of Engelmann's who was born in the Electorate of the Palatinate (...) , an historic region of Germany. A year earlier, as a vanguard for the family, her cousin George Engelmann had explored the region of the Midwestern United States. George was also from Frankfurt, <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>age</b> <b>as</b> Gustav, and had attended the same school, receiving a degree as M.D. and later becoming a famous expert in the botany of North America.|$|E
2500|$|A second {{specimen}} came {{to light}} around the same time, and was given to {{a team of scientists}} from Shenyang Normal University by a local farmer when they were excavating at the Yaolugou dig site. According to the farmer, this second specimen had been found nearby in the area of Daxishan, also from Tiaojishan Formation rocks of <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>age</b> <b>as</b> the first Anchiornis. Two scientists visited the site in order to compare the new fossil with the rock types found there, and were able to confirm that the new specimen probably did come from the area the farmer described. They were able to dig up several fish fossils and a third Anchiornis fossil. The farmer's fossil underwent study which was published on September 24, 2009, in the journal Nature. It was assigned the catalogue number [...] in the Liaoning Paleontological Museum. It is larger and much more complete than the first specimen, and preserved long wing feathers on the hands, arms, legs and feet, showing that it was a four-winged dinosaur similar to Microraptor.|$|E
