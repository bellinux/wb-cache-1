5000|$|Civilian Instructors, {{known as}} CIs, play an {{important}} role in training cadets and, in many ways, are the 'backbone' of the Squadron. Unlike adult NCOs and Officers, CIs do not wear uniform, although until recently greens were acceptable for fieldcraft and shooting activities, flying suits are still to be worn by those serving on AEF's or VGS', for safety reasons, which override other dress regulations. CI's do not officially form part of the chain of command in the squadron, but they may hold what might be called Command posts. It is expected that any cadet, irrespective of rank, should and will listen to CI's and obey relevant instructions given. A Civilian Instructor's recognised dress consists of a light blue polo shirt and dark blue sweatshirt bearing the name of the corps and [...] "Royal Air Force", in an effort to standardise the means by which CIs are identified. CI's are addressed as Sir or Ma'am by cadets when speaking to them or Mr, Mrs, Miss then surname by staff speaking to them or by anyone who is referring to them when they are not present, neither [...] "CI" [...] and surname or [...] "staff'" [...] are correct forms of address.

50|$|Many ISPs {{register}} the client's MAC <b>address</b> <b>for</b> <b>service</b> and billing services. Since MAC addresses are unique and hard-coded on {{network interface controller}} (NIC) cards, when the client wants to connect a new gadget or change his/her existing gadget, the ISP will detect different MAC addresses and the ISP might not grant Internet access to those new devices. This can be circumvented easily by MAC spoofing. The client only needs to spoof the new device's MAC address to the MAC address that was registered by the ISP. In this case, the client spoofs his or her MAC address to gain Internet access from multiple devices. While this seems like a legitimate case, MAC spoofing new gadgets can be considered illegal if the ISP's user-agreement prevents the user from connecting more than one device to their service. Moreover, the client {{is not the only}} person who can spoof his or her MAC address {{to gain access to the}} ISP. Hackers can gain unauthorized access to the ISP via the same technique. This allows hackers to gain access to unauthorized services, and the hacker will be hard to identify because the hacker uses the client's identity. This action is considered an illegitimate use of MAC spoofing and illegal as well. However, it is very hard to track hackers utilizing MAC spoofing.|$|E

40|$|The well {{established}} rule that an overseas company that establishes {{a place of}} business in Great Britain and does not provide an <b>address</b> <b>for</b> <b>service</b> can be served with process at that place of business 1 was thrown into confusion by the insertion into the 1985 Companies Act of several new provisions including a new section 694 A(2) which provides that process may only be served on a branch “in respect of the carrying on {{of the business of}} the branch”. 2 The new rules did not purport to change the situation in relation to a place of business falling short of a branch, and thus created the anomaly that it was apparently easier to serve a place of business than a branch. The proper interpretation of these rules arose in Saab v. Saudi American Bank (Court of Appeal, 2 July 1999). 3 Before the case was heard by the Court of Appeal, the new Civil Procedure Rules entered into force on 26 April 1999. Under Part 62 (2) : A company may be served by any method permitted under this Part {{as an alternative to the}} methods of service set out in— (a) section 725 of the Companies Act 1985 (service by leaving a document at or posting it to an authorised place); (b) section 695 of that Act (service on overseas companies); and (c) section 694 A of that Act (service of documents on companies incorporated outside the UK and Gibraltar and having a branch in Great Britain).

40|$|An {{appearance}} is the procedure {{used by the}} defendant to inform the plaintiff {{that he or she}} intends to defend the proceedings. The procedure prevents the plaintiff entering a default judgment or taking further steps without notice to the defendant. In Queensland, an {{appearance is}} known as a Notice of Intention to Defend. In the Australian Capital Territory, it is called a Notice of Intention to Respond. Appearances are of two types, though both types are not available in all jurisdictions. The most common type is an unconditional appearance, which acknowledges the court’s jurisdiction and waives any irregularity in service or commencement of proceedings. The other form of appearance is a conditional appearance. Conditional appearances do not waive procedural irregularities, but preserve arguments based on lack of jurisdiction and other irregularities. In the event that an appearance is not entered, the defendant is at risk of a default judgment being entered. Appearances have been abolished in South Australia and in the Federal Court in favour of filing a Notice of <b>Address</b> <b>for</b> <b>Service</b> or alternatively in South Australia, a defence. In New South Wales a Submitting Appearance (r 6. 11) and in the Australian Capital Territory, Notice of Intention to Respond (r 106), may be used by a defendant to submit to the orders of the court save as to costs, and take no part in the proceedings...|$|E
