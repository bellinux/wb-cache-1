5|$|Between 1980 and 2000, Gulf {{moved from}} being a monolithic, {{vertically}} integrated multinational corporation to being more {{of a network of}} allied business interests. This has given the entire Gulf enterprise a high degree of strategic and operational flexibility. It is <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>that</b> reflects fundamental change in the economics of international business.|$|E
5|$|In September 1946, Broderick was {{assigned}} to the office of Mayor William O'Dwyer in an unannounced confidential capacity, <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>that</b> many in city government found surprising. After a few months he was abruptly transferred to the Main Office Division, and in July 1947, he retired from the police department.|$|E
5|$|On March 23, 2007, Maturi made <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>that</b> {{surprised}} many when {{he hired}} Tubby Smith after he {{resigned from the}} University of Kentucky {{to be the next}} head Gopher basketball coach. Smith's name recognition and winning reputation gave the program a new optimism, something it badly needed to counter its dwindling fan interest.|$|E
50|$|Doherty also fired some of {{the front}} office staff that worked in the {{basketball}} office, <b>a</b> <b>moved</b> <b>that</b> shocked North Carolina basketball staffers.|$|R
50|$|Wright {{started his}} own {{advertising}} and public relations agency. He also began selling cancer insurance, <b>a</b> <b>moved</b> <b>that</b> proved so successful that his insurance company promoted him to manager for {{the entire state of}} Missouri. He retired from the insurance industry in 1987.|$|R
5000|$|White's 3.Nf3 is <b>a</b> {{flexible}} <b>move</b> <b>that,</b> {{depending on}} Black's reply, can transpose into lines with ...Nxd5 or ...Qxd5.|$|R
5|$|Between {{these two}} seasons, Bradman seriously {{contemplated}} playing professional cricket in England with the Lancashire League club Accrington, <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>that,</b> {{according to the}} rules of the day, would have ended his Test career. A consortium of three Sydney businesses offered an alternative. They devised a two-year contract whereby Bradman wrote for Associated Newspapers, broadcast on Radio 2UE and promoted the menswear retailing chain FJ Palmer and Son. However, the contract increased Bradman's dependence on his public profile, making it more difficult to maintain the privacy that he ardently desired.|$|E
5|$|By 1759, Prussia {{had reached}} a {{strategic}} defensive position in the war. Upon leaving winter quarters in April 1759, Frederick assembled his army in Lower Silesia; this forced the main Habsburg army to remain in its winter staging position in Bohemia. The Russians, however, shifted their forces into western Poland and marched westward toward the Oder river, <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>that</b> threatened the Prussian heartland, Brandenburg, and potentially Berlin itself. Frederick countered by sending an army corps commanded by Friedrich August von Finck to contain the Russians; he sent a second column commanded by Christoph II von Dohna to support Finck.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the regular}} season, {{speculation}} surrounded whether Turner Gill would leave Buffalo for another school's head coaching position. He {{was identified as}} a candidate at two schools: Syracuse and Auburn. In neither case was Gill hired; Syracuse opted for New Orleans Saints offensive coordinator Doug Marrone, while Auburn passed him over in favor of Iowa State head coach Gene Chizik, <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>that</b> prominent former National Basketball Association (NBA) player, Basketball Hall-of-Famer, and Auburn alumnus Charles Barkley claimed was due to racism. Gill ended up signing a contract extension with Buffalo.|$|E

5|$|Having taken charge Huggins did not {{shy away}} from making {{personnel}} changes. Upon taking over the Yankees, he stressed fundamental baseball, drilling the Yankees {{in the art of}} the bunt. Huggins also made his first player transaction, acquiring Del Pratt and Eddie Plank from the St. Louis Browns trading Nick Cullop, Joe Gedeon, Fritz Maisel, Les Nunamaker, Urban Shocker and $15,000 ($ in current dollar terms), <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>that</b> led to criticism in the press.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, Warner Bros. {{bought the}} rights to the Nancy Drew book series from the Stratemeyer Syndicate, for a {{reported}} $6,000. Warner Bros. wanted to make a series of B-films based on the character, to serve as a companion to their popular Torchy Blane B-film series, which starred Glenda Farrell, Barton MacLane, and Tom Kennedy. Adams sold {{the rights to}} Jack L. Warner without an agent or any consultation; thus, she sold all and any film rights to Warner Bros., <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>that</b> would later come into question following the rise of television.|$|E
5|$|In February 1835, Ohio passed {{legislation}} {{that set up}} county governments in the Strip. The county in which Toledo sat would, later in 1835, be named after incumbent Governor Robert Lucas, <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>that</b> further exacerbated the growing tensions with Michigan. Also, during this period, Ohio attempted to use its power in Congress to revive a previously rejected boundary bill that would formally set the state border to be the Harris Line.|$|E
5000|$|Sut Ma (Knight Sutra) is <b>a</b> {{first free}} <b>move</b> <b>that</b> allows the player to <b>move</b> <b>a</b> Knight and a Pawn <b>a</b> Knight's <b>move</b> from <b>that</b> Knight {{in the same}} turn. Two pieces are moved in this sutra. First, move the Pawn which is <b>a</b> Knight's <b>move</b> from the Knight forward; then move the Knight to the blank square the Pawn has just vacated.|$|R

5|$|In recent decades, South Dakota {{has been}} {{transformed}} from a state dominated by agriculture to one with a more diversified economy. The tourism industry has grown considerably since {{the completion of the}} interstate system in the 1960s, with the Black Hills becoming more important as a destination. The financial service industry began to grow in the state as well, with Citibank moving its credit card operations from New York to Sioux Falls in 1981, <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>that</b> has been followed by several other financial companies. South Dakota was the first state to eliminate caps on interest rates.|$|E
5|$|Ivan Sratsimir was proclaimed emperor in Vidin in 1356 {{and began}} to use the title Emperor of Bulgarians and Greeks, as his father. In order to secure the {{alliance}} of Wallachia, he married his first cousin Anna, {{the daughter of the}} Wallachian voivode Nicholas Alexander, in 1356 or 1357, <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>that</b> was probably arranged with the help of Ivan Sratsimir's mother Theodora as a reaction to the actions of Ivan Alexander.|$|E
5|$|On 1 July 2006, Mertens officially {{signed for}} AGOVV Apeldoorn, who later {{dissolved}} in 2013, on a season-long loan with {{the option of}} purchase. He managed a return of 2 goals in 35 appearances during a season which saw him become a fan favourite amongst De Blauwen supporters. Mertens' form prompted AGOVV, led by new manager John van den Brom, to exercise the option to sign the Belgian permanently the following season. It was <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>that</b> paid off for the Dutch club as Mertens ended the season having 15 goals in 38 appearances for the club.|$|E
5000|$|He founded Balestra Capital Management, {{a global}} macro hedge fund, in 1979. He named the firm after the balestra, <b>a</b> fencing <b>move</b> <b>that</b> {{sometimes}} [...] "dictates a strategic retreat".|$|R
50|$|In the Pokémon game series, <b>a</b> <b>move</b> has the English name of Sucker Punch. It is <b>a</b> Dark-type <b>move</b> <b>that</b> {{allows the}} user to attack before the other Pokémon has a chance to, {{provided}} that the targeted Pokémon is going to attack in that same turn.|$|R
50|$|Big Bang Break (1.02 on): <b>A</b> {{powerful}} <b>move</b> <b>that</b> {{can only}} be performed in character unique situations, usually by canceling a specific B Power Art with a special command. Costs two stocks.|$|R
5|$|Prior to the 2016 season, Obafemi Martins {{abruptly}} {{left the}} club to sign with Shanghai Greenland Shenhua F.C. in the Chinese Super League, <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>that</b> would hamper the Sounders' offense during the season. The move was mitigated somewhat by the signing of homegrown product Jordan Morris. GM Lagerwey also traded Marco Pappa and Lamar Neagle to other clubs in the offseason.|$|E
5|$|Rome {{now turned}} its attentions to Antiochus III of the Seleucid Empire to the east. After campaigns as far abroad as Bactria, India, Persia and Judea, Antiochus moved to Asia Minor and Thrace to secure several coastal towns, <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>that</b> {{brought him into}} {{conflict}} with Roman interests. A Roman force under Manius Acilius Glabrio defeated Antiochus at the Battle of Thermopylae and forced him to evacuate Greece: the Romans then pursued the Seleucids beyond Greece, beating them again in naval battles at the Battle of the Eurymedon and Battle of Myonessus, and finally in a decisive engagement of the Battle of Magnesia.|$|E
5|$|Thatcher {{narrowly}} escaped {{injury in}} an IRA assassination {{attempt at a}} Brighton hotel {{early in the morning}} on 12 October 1984. Five people were killed, including the wife of minister John Wakeham. Thatcher was staying at the hotel to prepare for the Conservative Party conference, which she insisted should open as scheduled the following day. She delivered her speech as planned, though rewritten from her original draft, in <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>that</b> was widely supported across the political spectrum and enhanced her popularity with the public.|$|E
5000|$|Is there <b>a</b> {{sequence}} of <b>moves</b> <b>that</b> allows the player to match a specific tile? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just remember, this ain't settled yet!" [...] {{cried the}} hotel-keeper, to Dave and Roger. [...] "I'm {{going to look}} into it a bit deeper before I make <b>a</b> <b>move,</b> <b>that's</b> all. I know some of you done it, and I'll have you in prison for it yet, see if I don't!" [...] And he shook his head grimly; and then the covered wagon was turned around, and the three men drove off in the {{direction}} of Oakdale.|$|R
6000|$|... "Daggs made {{as crazy}} <b>a</b> <b>move</b> as <b>that</b> of Guy an' Jacobs," [...] spoke up Jean. [...] "They were overbold, an' he was drunk. Let them be {{a lesson to}} us." ...|$|R
5|$|The bus tunnel was {{originally}} intended to be converted for use by light rail trains {{at some point in}} the future. Metro approved the addition of tracks to the bus tunnel in 1988, appropriating half of the $5 million used to install them during construction, the remainder coming from federal sources. To save $1.5 million in costs, Metro eliminated most of the rail's electrical insulation, <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>that</b> would later make them unusable for rail service.|$|E
5|$|The tournament was put {{in further}} {{jeopardy}} in January 1979 when General Motors withdrew as a major sponsor; Eagleson argued GM withdrew {{as a result of}} the dispute with the CAHA. The disputes put the two bodies on the verge of severing all ties, <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>that</b> would have led to Hockey Canada refusing to release any professional or university player to any of Canada's national teams. The tournament was ultimately postponed by a year until September 1980.|$|E
5|$|The {{trial of}} those charged with {{involvement}} in the coup occurred {{more than two years}} later in mid-1963. Diệm scheduled the hearing {{in the middle of the}} Buddhist crisis, <b>a</b> <b>move</b> <b>that</b> was interpreted as an attempt to deter the populace from further dissent. Nineteen officers and 34 civilians were accused of complicity in the coup and called before the Special Military Court.|$|E
5000|$|Fleck {{is now a}} {{teaching}} assistant at the Parkside School, [...] "a Norwich school for children with complex needs", <b>a</b> career <b>move</b> <b>that</b> developed from running coaching sessions for children at the school.|$|R
