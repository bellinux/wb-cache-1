25|$|The SEC {{formally}} investigated whether Brunson's {{offer and}} its publication violated federal securities laws, including the anti-fraud {{provisions of the}} Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As part of its investigation, the SEC subpoenaed documents and testimony from Brunson's lawyers. However, Brunson, who invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and declined to testify in the investigation, directed his lawyers to withhold certain documents and not to testify on critical aspects of the offer, under the <b>attorney-client</b> <b>privilege</b> and work product doctrine. The subpoena enforcement action sought to set aside these privileges on various legal grounds, including the crime-fraud exception, and to compel Brunson's firm to provide the requested documents and testimony.|$|E

5000|$|During the New Jersey Supreme Court's {{hearing of}} the case, the court set out to {{determine}} whether or not Loving Care's computer use policy was sufficient notice that her privacy should be expected while using the company-owned laptop. After hearing the facts of the case and reviewing the previous holdings from the lower courts, the Supreme Court affirmed the decision previously made by the appellate court that Marina Stengart had reasonable expectations that her attorney-client communications would remain private. The decision of the court was formed on the basis of a few principles: (1) that Loving Care's policy was [...] "ambiguous" [...] and did not specify that personal, password-protected e-mails were subject to company review, (2) that reasonable expectation of privacy could have been created due to the company’s allowing of “personal use” of the computer, and (3) that company interests cannot infringe on <b>attorney-client</b> <b>privileges.</b> In addition to the faults in the wording of the company's policy, the New Jersey Supreme Court also pointed out faults in the company's ideas as to what the company can and cannot do. In this case, the court re-emphasized the importance of respecting <b>attorney-client</b> <b>privileges</b> and warned Loving Care's attorneys that by reading the e-mails, they were in violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct.|$|R
25|$|On January 14, 1992, Trafficante's former attorney, Frank Ragano, told Jack Newfield of the New York Post that he relayed {{a request}} from Hoffa to Trafficante and New Orleans boss Carlos Marcello to have Kennedy killed. He {{repeated}} the claim two days later on ABC's Good Morning America, in Newfield's Frontline report entitled JFK, Hoffa and Mob broadcast in November 1992, and again in his 1994 autobiography Mob Lawyer. According to Ragano, he met Hoffa at the Teamsters' headquarters in Washington, DC, then delivered the message to Trafficante and Marcello in {{a meeting at the}} Royal Orleans Hotel in New Orleans. He stated he was chosen by Hoffa because, as both Hoffa and Trafficante's lawyer, he could be assured of <b>attorney–client</b> <b>privilege.</b>|$|E
25|$|On March 17, 1994, Stanfa and 23 of his {{men were}} arrested on {{racketeering}} related chargers. This was the second major indictment on the crime family in seven years. The Federal case was the largest prosecution of an organized crime group in Philadelphia history. The second major indictment against the crime family was another strong case for the prosecution. A key piece of evidence was two years of recorded conversations Stanfa would have with mobsters in his attorney's office and doctor's office. Believing <b>attorney–client</b> <b>privilege</b> and doctor-patient confidentiality would protect him, Stanfa openly talked about important Mafia business with his men. However, the FBI {{was able to get}} a warrant to place covert listening devices in both offices once they figured out they were being used to aid criminal conspiracies. The secretly recorded conversations implicated Stanfa and his men of many criminal acts. The star witness at the trial was John Veasey, who was recruited by Stanfa to fight in the war against Merlino and eventually was inducted into the family. Before this, Veasey had no connection to the Mafia or organized crime.|$|E
500|$|Almost {{two years}} passed. [...] Independent Counsel Starr {{continued}} his investigation. [...] Starr wanted access to notes that Vince Foster's attorney {{took in a}} conversation with Foster about the travel office affair shortly before Foster's suicide, but on June 25, 1998, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 6–3 against Starr in Swidler & Berlin v. United States, stating that <b>attorney–client</b> <b>privilege</b> extends beyond the grave. [...] In September 1998 Independent Counsel Starr released the famous Starr Report, concerning offenses that may have been committed by President Clinton as part of the Lewinsky scandal. [...] It did not mention the travel office matter.|$|E
5000|$|Juveniles' {{appreciation}} {{and understanding of}} <b>attorney-client</b> <b>privileges</b> are also lacking. When comparing juveniles and adults, juveniles {{are much more likely}} to refuse to talk to an attorney, even though it is the attorney's duty to help. When juveniles are asked if they trust their attorney, only 6.2% of juveniles related positively to disclosing information to their attorney. [...] Further, juvenile male defendants and juvenile defendants from ethnic minority groups are less likely to trust their attorney or to disclose information about the case to their attorney than female and Caucasian defendants.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} questions this case answered was in regards to whether or not an employer was legally allowed to obtain and review information from its employee’s attorney-client communications. The Stengart v. Loving Care case clarified that although a company could create a policy and require an employee to abide by it, legally, they could not require an individual to give up their rights such as <b>attorney-client</b> <b>privileges.</b> The court further went on to explain that a company can limit or prevent the use of a company-owned computer; however, accessing personal and private information of the employee is off limits.|$|R
25|$|Lawyers {{are often}} {{required}} by law to keep confidential anything pertaining to the representation of a client. The duty of confidentiality is much broader than the <b>attorney–client</b> evidentiary <b>privilege,</b> which only covers communications between the attorney and the client.|$|R
2500|$|Mandamus is {{the proper}} remedy to compel the quashal of a {{subpoena}} duces tecum for the production {{before a grand jury}} of <b>attorney–client</b> <b>privilege.</b> [...] Presumably, this would apply to attorney work product, although there is no case law on the matter.|$|E

5000|$|On 28 March 2006, David Rivkin {{pleaded guilty}} to charges of {{conspiracy}} and tax evasion in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. [...] "I knew that the losses {{should not have been}} claimed on the tax forms," [...] Rivkin told Judge Kaplan. Rivkin admitted that he conspired with others between January 1999 and May 2004 to prepare and execute false documents so that clients could file false tax returns. He also admitted that he took steps to conceal the existence of fraudulent tax shelters from the Internal Revenue Service and avoided registering the shelters with the IRS by claiming <b>attorney-client</b> <b>privileges.</b> Rivkin signed an agreement to cooperate with prosecutors, who could then ask the judge to consider giving Rivkin a more lenient sentence rather than the years he might face in prison. Sentencing was set for Feb. 9, 2007.|$|R
40|$|When {{questions}} are raised regarding {{a law firm}} attorney’s representation of a firm client, the questioned attorney often wishes to seek legal counsel. A conferral will often benefit the attorney, the firm and the client. Conferences regarding questioned conduct should be encouraged, not discouraged. To encourage these beneficial conferrals, a broad <b>attorney-client</b> communication <b>privilege</b> and a broad work product protection (or privilege) should be available. Availability should not be dependent upon whether in-house, outside or other legal counsel are employed. While earlier federal precedents were split regarding {{the availability of the}} <b>attorney-client</b> communication <b>privilege</b> in the in-house counsel setting, increasingly therein the privilege is recognized by state high courts. As well, work product protections should also often be available to legal counsel advising questioned attorneys. Because of current federal-state and interstate differences in the two immunities from compelled involuntary disclosure, however, conferring legal counsel and questioned attorneys must proceed cautiously...|$|R
50|$|Lastly, {{this case}} has {{emphasized}} the importance of respecting <b>attorney-client</b> <b>privileges</b> and what implications can come about if these rights are neglected by an opposing counsel. This case {{made it clear that the}} forensic reviews of an employee’s computer files are to follow strict guidelines and protocols. These protocols apply not only the acquisition of the forensic files, but also to handling and presentation of such information to the court. Also, any forensic files obtained that contain privileged material must be separated from permissible evidence and such information must be disclosed to the opposing counsel and the court for necessary action. As evident in the case of Stengart v. Loving Care, a counsel’s failure to abide by these guidelines could result in the evidence being deemed inadmissible in court and could bring about court sanctions on the parties involved in the acquisition of the private and restricted information.|$|R
2500|$|Rouse sued his {{attorney}} in 2005 for releasing the tapes, claiming that it breached the <b>attorney–client</b> <b>privilege</b> (though that privilege doesn't apply when an attorney knows about potential criminal activity); {{the suit is}} still pending.

2500|$|As an {{employee}} of the United States Department of State, Mills was Counselor to the Secretary of State; it is unclear under the Federal Rules of Evidence whether <b>attorney–client</b> <b>privilege</b> applies to these communications.

50|$|Unsatisfied {{with the}} trial judge's {{decision}} to allow the e-mails to remain with the defendant, Stengart and her attorney decided to present their case to the New Jersey Superior Court, Appellate Division. The appellate judge subsequently reversed {{the decision of the}} trial court by saying that the trial court had not exhibited proper respect to attorney-client privacy, and thereby ordered that the case be heard in front of a judge in the Chancery Division. Furthermore, the appellate court also warned that Loving Care's counsel could have sanctions imposed upon them for violating the <b>attorney-client</b> <b>privileges</b> and obtaining copies of e-mails {{that they did not have}} rights to. Once again however, the decision of the court was challenged, but this time by Loving Care Agency. After the decision was made by the appellate court, Loving Care Agency then decided to take the case to the New Jersey Supreme Court for the final ruling.|$|R
5000|$|On April 9, 2013, Judge Barry Feudale {{issued a}} 16-page ruling rejecting Messrs Spanier's, Schultz's and Curley's request to omit Presentment 29 from the investigation.

[...] Judge Feudale also stated that senior executives of an organization, like Mr. Schultz, Mr. Curley and Mr. Spanier, are usually represented by that organization's counsel. Judge Feudale further wrote that [...] "Spanier, Curley and Schultz are [...] "highly educated" [...] men who had positions of considerable influence at PSU as well as inferentially, knowledge about important events that impact the reputation of the university; and it therefore strains credulity to infer that they were somehow deluded or misrepresented by attorney Baldwin. Judge Feudale went on to state that he believed that the defendants' motion [...] "lacks merit in fact and law" ...|$|R
5000|$|Stengart v. Loving Care Agency, Inc., 990 A.2d 650 (2010) was a New Jersey Supreme Court {{case that}} {{provided}} guidance to employees {{as to what}} extent they may expect privacy and confidentiality in personal e-mails composed on company-owned computers. Through its decision, the court ruled on two key issues which concluded {{that there should be}} a [...] "reasonable" [...] expectation of privacy in personal e-mails on company computers, and that <b>attorney-client</b> communication <b>privileges</b> and privacy should not be violated. On March 30, 2010, Chief Justice Stuart Rabner and the New Jersey Supreme Court affirmed the appellate courts decision by overturning the previous ruling made by the trial court. The trial court previously determined that a company-created policy provided sufficient warning to employees that all communications and activities performed on company-owned computers were subject to review by the employer and that there should be no expectation of privacy because of such policies.|$|R
2500|$|Trial {{consultants}} {{perform a}} variety of services for lawyers, such as picking jurors (usually relying on in-house or published statistical studies) or performing [...] "mock trials" [...] with focus groups.

2500|$|<b>Attorney–client</b> <b>privilege</b> is {{generally}} {{recognized by the}} courts. Communications between lawyer and client are generally immune from subpoena. In other words, a lawyer cannot be compelled to testify in a trial unless the lawyer becomes, or appears to become, {{a party to the}} litigation. A similar situation exists with [...] "work product", meaning written documents or computer records generated in preparation for a trial or hearing. This includes information such as potential questions that may be asked of witnesses, lists of possible witnesses, memoranda, notes, trial strategies, written briefs, or documents that may, or may not end up being used in the course of litigation. Usually, none of this can be the subject of a subpoena duces tecum. If a communication between lawyer and client is made {{in the presence of the}} third party, the privilege is not recognized to exist.|$|E

5000|$|The psychotherapist-patient <b>privilege,</b> {{like the}} <b>attorney-client</b> and spousal <b>privileges,</b> flows from society's desire to {{facilitate}} certain relationships {{of confidence and}} trust. [...] "Effective psychotherapy... depends upon an atmosphere of confidence and trust in which the patient is willing to make a frank and complete disclosure of facts, emotions, memories, and fears. Because of the sensitive nature of the problems for which individuals consult psychotherapists, disclosure of confidential communication made during counseling sessions may cause embarrassment or disgrace. For this reason, the mere possibility of disclosure may impede disclosure of the confidential relationship necessary for successful treatment."

40|$|When {{questions}} are {{raised by a}} current client regarding an attorney’s representation of the client, the questioned attorney {{should be able to}} seek counsel confidentially. Such a conferral will often benefit the attorney, the firm and the client. Advice regarding questioned conduct should be encouraged, not discouraged. To prompt such conferrals, an attorney-client communication and a work product privilege should be available in Illinois, with availability not dependent upon whether in-house, outside or other attorneys are sought for counsel. While early federal precedents were split, increasingly under other state high court precedents the <b>attorney-client</b> communication <b>privilege</b> is available. Its recognition by the Illinois Appellate Court in 2012 in Garvy should be followed. As well, work product privileges should also be available, though they have not as yet been widely discussed nationally. Yet, because of federal-state and interstate differences in the two privileges, Illinois attorneys and judges must proceed cautiously as not all out-of-state precedents can be followed.

However, the next day MacCracken's law partner gave Northwest Airways vice president Lewis H. Brittin permission to go into MacCracken's files and remove a memo that Brittin claimed was personal and unrelated to the investigation. Brittin later tore up the memo and discarded it. Black charged MacCracken with Contempt of Congress on February 5 and ordered him arrested.

2500|$|By this time, several Drexel executives—including Joseph—concluded that Drexel {{could not}} survive a RICO {{indictment}} {{and would have to}} seek a settlement with Giuliani. [...] Senior Drexel executives became particularly nervous after Princeton Newport Partners, a small investment partnership, was forced to close its doors in the summer of 1988. [...] Princeton Newport had been indicted under RICO, and the prospect of having to post a huge performance bond forced its shutdown well before the trial. [...] Joseph said years later that he'd been told that a RICO indictment would destroy Drexel within a month, if not sooner. [...] Nonetheless, negotiations for a possible plea agreement collapsed on December 19 when Giuliani made several demands that were far too draconian even for those who advocated a settlement. [...] Giuliani demanded that Drexel waive its <b>attorney–client</b> <b>privilege,</b> and also wanted the right to arbitrarily decide that the firm had violated the terms of any plea agreement.

2500|$|The {{priest is}} bound under the severest {{penalties}} {{to maintain the}} [...] "seal of confession", absolute secrecy about any sins revealed to him in confession. This strict confidentiality {{is known as the}} Seal of the Confessional. According to 983 §1 of the 1983 Code of Canon Law, [...] "The sacramental seal is inviolable; therefore it is absolutely forbidden for a confessor to betray in any way a penitent in words or in any manner and for any reason." [...] Priests, and anyone who witnesses or overhears the confession (say, an interpreter, caregiver, or aide of a person with a disability) may not reveal what they have learned during confession to anyone, even under the threat of their own death or that of others. This is unique to the Seal of the Confessional. Many other forms of confidentiality, including in most states <b>attorney-client</b> <b>privilege,</b> allow ethical breaches of the confidence {{to save the life of}} another. But a priest, or anyone else who witnesses or overhears any part of the confession, who breaks that confidentiality incurs latae sententiae (automatic) excommunication reserved to the Holy See. In a criminal matter, a priest may encourage the penitent to surrender to authorities, however, this is the extent of the leverage he wields: he cannot make this a condition of the absolution and he may not directly or indirectly disclose the matter to civil authorities himself.|$|E

2500|$|The scandal which {{unseated}} Ron Carey {{as president}} of the Teamsters began when Hoffa accused Carey of illegal re-election campaign activities on March 19, 1997, three months after the election. [...] Hoffa asserted that, at the direction of President Carey, the Teamsters union had paid $97,000 to Michael Ansara, owner of a Massachusetts-based direct mail firm, for get-out-the-vote work in the 1996 Presidential and Congressional elections—work which was not done. [...] Ansara's wife, Barbara Arnold, then made a $95,000 contribution to the Carey re-election effort days later. [...] The deal, Hoffa alleged, had been brokered by Martin Davis, owner of another direct mail business which had done work for the union and the Carey campaign. Hoffa claimed the donation was pivotal because it permitted the Carey campaign to make a last-minute anti-Hoffa mailing. The use of union funds in a race for union office is prohibited by federal law, and it is also illegal for employers or their family members to contribute to union elections. Carey dismissed the allegations, claiming that it was mere [...] "serendipity" [...] that the donation came {{on the heels of the}} payment. Nonetheless, Carey returned the donation, and a day later returned another $126,000 in donations to other contributors without explanation. The refunds constituted nearly 10 percent of Carey's total campaign fund-raising. On March 26, a Federal grand jury in Manhattan began investigating the allegations. On June 6, 1997, the U.S. Department of Justice indicted Davis on charges of conspiracy, embezzlement, and violations of federal labor law for masterminding the kickback scheme. Ansara pleaded guilty to conspiracy and admitted he had used the union's money to reimburse his wife for her donations to the Carey re-election effort. The Carey campaign tried to shield its internal documents from federal investigators, arguing they were protected by <b>attorney–client</b> <b>privilege,</b> but this claim was dismissed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.|$|E
