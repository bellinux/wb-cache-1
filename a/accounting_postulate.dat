Normative models in management <b>accounting</b> <b>postulate</b> that only relevant cost information should be considered in the course of managerial decision making. In addition, decisions should follow the economic theory of maximising utility. Relevant costs are those future costs that differ between decision alternatives. As well as prescribing the relevant cost information, behavioural factors (such as past experience) are ignored. This paper reports on an empirical survey of the influence of sunk cost and asset specific information on outsourcing decisions made by managers in public and private hospitals which also investigates the influence of behavioural factors such as prior experience. The results suggest that decision makers are influenced by the presence of information about sunk costs and asset specificity. In addition to demonstrating support for the sunk cost effect, this research provided evidence that the level of sunk cost and not just the absence of sunk cost information influences decisions. However, neither years of experience as a manager nor past experience with outsourcing decisions proved to be significant predictors of the decision to outsource...|$|E

With the help of this model, corporate planners and financial analysts can quantify the impacts of the flows of various funds on the assets holding patterns. Important conclusion of the model is that “fixed assets and working capital are complements. Working capital of a firm will increase with the enhancement in fixed assets”.

Action familiarity modulated the representation of means and end information in both cultures in the same way, although the effects were based on different stimulus sets.

Again, we first focus on utilization decisions. Prelec and Loewenstein (1998) integrate Thaler’s (1980, 1985) idea of mental accounts in an evaluation of consumption and payment events. They specify that consumers feel the pain of paying at the time of product purchase, which must be deducted from the pleasure of consumption. Their model comes with two main assumptions: prospective accounting and coupling. Prospective <b>accounting</b> <b>postulates</b> that consumers mentally depreciate past payments, but consider future payments in their full amount. In coupling, individuals create a psychological link between the payment and the consumption of a transaction. In line with their argumentation, coupling moderates the impact of payment on consumption such that the pain of paying attenuates consumption utility and the consumption pleasure buffers the pain of paying. The imputed costs are the highest right after payment and decrease over time. Gourville and Soman (1998) label this gradual adaptation to sunk costs {{with the passage of time}} as payment depreciation. Consequently, the sunk-cost effect should be more present in temporal proximity to the payment. Therefore, we propose the following hypothesis: [...]...|$|R

That is, humans {{should be able to}} cognitively represent robot actions easily, in terms of action goals and means to achieve them. This yields a question of how actions are represented in general.

Future research will aim at examining how much these representations depend on physical properties of the robot actor and its behavior...|$|R

The sensitivity of the behavioral activation system (BAS) is related to extraversion and positive affect, while {{the sensitivity of the}} behavioral inhibition is related to neuroticism and negative affect. Besides the strong links observed, it is unclear what the causal relationships between these constructs are. Participants and procedure The aim {{of this study was to}} provide indirect support for the theoretical <b>accounts</b> <b>postulating</b> the causal direction from behavioral sensitivity through personality to affectivity. Using data from two measurement occasions, two sets of models were specified to test those predictions. A total of 286 social sciences and humanities students participated in the study for course credit or financial reimbursement. Results Our results provide limited support for the proposed causal direction, but only some of the direct links were observed to be significantly different from zero. Extraversion and positive affect showed a reciprocal pattern of influences, while the sensitivity of the behavioral inhibition system (BIS) predicted neuroticism. Conclusions The results presented here give limited support to the proposed direction of relationships between the three sets of affective constructs investigated in this study.

One <b>account</b> <b>postulates</b> that children enter the word-learning task with specific knowledge about how words link to categories. The second account puts the source of children's smart word learning in knowledge about the pragmatics of communication and social interactions. The present experiment tested a third idea: that children's seemingly smart word learning derives from general, indeed mundane, cognitive processes. Forty-eight children from 18 to 28 months of age participated in a task designed to test our alternative explanation as applied to Akhtar, Carpenter, and Tomasello's (1996) finding that children use knowledge of the communicative intents of others to interpret a novel noun. Specifically, we suggest that children's attention to the proper referent was guided by the general effects of a contextual shift on memory and attention. The procedure {{in the present study}} was identical to that of Akhtar et al. except that we differentiated the target through a nonsocial context shift. Findings similar to that of Akhtar et al. emerged under the present procedures. These results strongly suggest that general attentional and memorial processes, and not knowledge about the communicative intents of others, may guide young children's word learning. These findings provide one demonstration of how smart word learning may emerge from more ordinary (and dumb) cognitive processes...|$|R

50|$|It is {{debated in}} {{research}} on visual spatial attention whether {{it is possible to}} split attention across different areas in the visual field. The ‘spotlight’ and ‘zoom-lens’ <b>accounts</b> <b>postulate</b> that attention uses a single unitary focus. Therefore, spatial attention can only be allocated to adjacent areas in the visual field and consequently cannot be split. This was supported by an experiment that altered the spatial cueing paradigm by using two cues, a primary and a secondary cue. It was found that the secondary cue was only effective in focusing attention when its location was adjacent to the primary cue. In addition, it has been demonstrated that observers are unable to ignore stimuli presented in areas situated between two cued locations. These findings have proposed that attention cannot be split across two non-contiguous regions. However, other studies have demonstrated that spatial attention can be split across two locations. For example, observers were able to attend simultaneously to two different targets located in opposite hemifields. Research has even suggested that humans are able to focus attention across two to four locations in the visual field. Another perspective is that spatial attention can be split only under certain conditions. This perspective suggests that the splitting of spatial attention is flexible. Research demonstrated that whether spatial attention is unitary or divided depends on the goals of the task. Therefore, if dividing attention is beneficial to the observer then a divided focus of attention will be utilised.|$|R

A material quantitative part of such financial statements assets is expected to match with properties and equipment figures, which, in turn, should determine significant amortization charges to the income account.

Profit-sharing financial institutions have been established. The research attempts to show how these institutions work, and what alternatives they rely on to substitute interest as a motivation for mobilising savings. The technique of investment of various deposits which are held in one pool, as practised by some Islamic banks, and the methods of determining each depositor's share in investment and in profit, are discussed. Profit generated from the investment is the alternative proposed to substitute interest. Risks surrounding investment environment and the difficulties embodied in the technique used to distribute profit are the major topics discussed. The research centres on a field study, following the case study approach, whereby methods for the distribution of profit used in three Islamic banks in the Sudan are explained in detail with illustrating numerical examples. A comparison between the various methods is made. The historical background to the establishment of Islamic banks is given as an introduction to the research. Furthermore, models of investment used in Islamic banking are explained and the difference between Islamic and conventional banks is shown. By way of introduction the concept of Riba in Islam is also discussed. Moreover, <b>accounting</b> <b>postulates</b> are scrutinised and verified from an Islamic perspective.

Among the recommendations drawn are investment in Limited Mudarabah, using different periods and values for Mudarabah certificates. Islamic banks should also concentrate on profit-sharing models of finance; the credit finance models used, although permitted, should gradually be abandoned...|$|R

40|$|Theoretical {{approaches}} to the principles governing the coordination of speech gestures differ in their assessment of the contributions of biomechanical and perceptual pressures on this coordination. Perceptually-oriented <b>accounts</b> <b>postulate</b> that, for consonant-consonant (C 1 -C 2) sequences, gestural timing patterns arise from speakers’ sensitivity to the listener's need to perceptually recover the input, whereas biomechanically-oriented accounts focus on physical factors that might constrain the relevant articulators. This dissertation contributes to current understanding of gestural coordination by examining the influences of order of place of articulation (front-to-back, back-to-front), manner of C 1 (plosive, fricative), and manner of C 2 (plosive, fricative, lateral) on the timing of constrictions formed by the tongue tip, tongue dorsum, and lips. If speakers produce CC sequences {{in order to accommodate}} listeners’ needs, temporal separation between C 1 and C 2 is expected in contexts in which acoustic masking due to intergestural overlap is especially likely. If speakers’ productions are instead directed by physical limitations of the vocal tract, overlap should be reduced when the gestures for C 1 and C 2 are not independent. Specific instantiations of these broad hypotheses were tested in a production experiment in which eight Greek speakers’ productions of initial CC sequences [pt ps pl ft kt ks kl xt] were imaged using ultrasound and video camera technologies. Degree of gestural overlap was measured in terms of temporal lag between the release of C 1 constriction and the achievement of C 2 constriction. Although perceptual-recoverability and biomechanical accounts made similar predictions for the effect of place order, they differed in their predictions for effects of C 1 and C 2 manner in the two place orders. Results showed that, consistent with biomechanics, dorsal-coronal [kt ks kl xt] were produced with greater intergestural lag than labial-coronal [pt ps pl ft]. Consistent with perceptual recoverability, plosive-plosive [pt kt] were produced with longer lag than fricative-plosive [ft xt]. An outcome not clearly predicted by either hypothesis was that lag was longer in [pt kt] than [ps ks]. Patterns, especially for plosive-lateral [pl kl], varied across speakers. These findings revealed an interplay between physical and perceptual—and potentially language-specific—demands on the timing of gestural coordination in speech production...|$|R

In this paper, we provide such a theoretical discussion of the two models, drawing strong contrasts between them.

On one classic account, facilitation and inhibition of return (IOR) are two ends of a continuum, generated by the same underlying mechanism.

More precisely, we examine various forms of corporate development, i. e. alliance, equity joint ventures and acquisitions, and explore how experience with these activities differentially affects the likelihood of tie dissolution. We argue that corporate development activities will provide opportunities for learning resulting from experience spillovers, but also bring about considerable disruptions. Taking both these arguments into <b>account,</b> we <b>postulate</b> a U-shaped relationship between a firm's CDA experience and the likelihood of its ties ending in a given year. We find support for our proposed curvilinear relationship between CDA experience and likelihood of tie dissolution in a sample of 273 advertising agency-client ties. We also hypothesize and find empirically that the effects of different types of experience are not uniform. We examine differences between acquisitions, joint ventures and other alliances and between horizontal and vertical CDA effects. We thus show that not all types of experience provide the same learning opportunities and disruptive potential for buyer-supplier ties. Although learning spillovers occur, we find limits to the benefits of experience as well as evidence of learning asymmetries. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

The strong assumption of equivalence be-tween attention and eye movements, however, is challenged by demonstrations that human observers are able to keep atten-tion on a specific location while moving the eyes elsewhere. Here we investigate whether a recurrent model of saccadic planning can account for attentional effects without requiring additional or specific mechanisms separate from the circuits that perform sensorimotor transformations for eye movements. The model builds on the basis function approach and includes a circuit that performs spatial remapping using an “internal forward model ” of how visual inputs are modified {{as a result of}} saccadic movements. Simulations show that the latter circuit is crucial to account for dissociations between attention and eye movements that may be invoked to disprove the premotor theory. The model provides new insights into how spatial re-mapping may be implemented in parietal cortex and offers a computational framework for recent proposals that link visual stability with remapping of attention pointers. ...|$|R
40|$|The flash vacuum {{pyrolysis}} (FVP) of bis(trimethylsilyl) ketene led to 1 -trimethylsilylpropyne and a {{trace of}} cyclotrisiloxane. The products were <b>accounted</b> for by <b>postulating</b> a retro-Wolff process. The decomposition kinetics of dimethylsilyl(trimethylsilyl) ketene were followed in a stirred-flow reactor (SFR) and the activation parameters (Ea = 51. 7 Kcal/mol, log A = 12. 97) were obtained. FVP of several alkyl(trimethylsilyl) ketenes were also examined. These ketenes have been observed to decompose by three different routes viz., a retro-Wolff process, a homolytic cleavage process and a retro-ene process. When the alkyl group was t-butyl, the retro-Wolff product was not observed. From decomposition kinetics of t-butyl(trimethylsilyl) ketene to form trimethylsilyketene, the evaluated activation parameters (Ea = 54. 6 Kcal/mol, log A = 13. 0) {{were found to be}} consistent with a retro-ene process;The FVP studies were extended to dimethylsilyl(trimethylsilyl) thioketene and bis(trimethylsilyl) thioketene. The former produced trimethylsilylacetylene in a remarkable 92 % yield with extrusion of dimethylsilanethione (Me[subscript] 2 Si = S). The latter thioketene gave a complex mixture of products, all of which are economically <b>accounted</b> for by <b>postulating</b> a 1, 2 -silyl shift (a retro-thio Wolff process) to give an [alpha]-thioketocarbene. Rearrangements of this thioketocarbene led to products. From the decomposition kinetics of hydridosilylthioketene the activation parameters (Ea = 44. 8 Kcal/mol, log A = 13. 3) were determined;Tris(dimethylsilyl) ketenimine on FVP afforded dimethylsilylacetylene and cyclodisilazane. The products were accounted for by a retro-Wolff type rearrangement;In an effort to study the structure of a silylketene, several bulky silyketenes were synthesized;Thermally generated silylenes were observed to react with certain silylketene and -thioketene with the formation of silylacetylenes;Alkyl radicals stabilization due to [alpha]- and [beta]-trimethylsilyl groups were evaluated and both were found to be the same (2. 6 ± 1 Kcal/mol) ...|$|R
