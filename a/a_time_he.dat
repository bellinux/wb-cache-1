5|$|Radford was {{promoted}} to vice admiral in late 1945. For <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> was Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Air under Secretary of the Navy James V. Forrestal. In the post-war period Radford was a strong advocate that naval aviation programs be maintained. When Fleet Admiral Ernest J. King issued a post-war plan calling for the U.S. to maintain nine active aircraft carriers, Radford suggested he double the number, a politically unrealistic proposal.|$|E

For <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> {{considered}} {{the possibility of a}} singing career, and was instructed by a vocal coach from the Metropolitan Opera who provided lessons for free because the family did not have the money for them. The family later moved to North Bergen, New Jersey, residing on Kennedy Boulevard and 57th Street. Because North Bergen did not have a high school, he attended Union Hill High School in Union Hill, New Jersey, from which he graduated in 1935.|$|E

5|$|Two days later, Small Heath, with Jack Lee and Bernard Pumfrey in {{the forward}} line instead of Walton and Mobley, and Littleford {{standing}} in at back, played a similarly depleted Wolverhampton Wanderers in the semi-final of the Mayor of Birmingham's Charity Cup.

5|$|Wilfrid {{appears to}} have lived at Ripon, and for <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> acted as {{administrator}} of the see of Lindisfarne after Cuthbert's death in 687. In 691, the subdivision issue arose once more, along with quarrels with King Aldfrith over lands, and {{attempts were made to}} make Wilfrid either give up all his lands or to stay confined to Ripon. A proposal to turn Ripon into a bishopric was also a source of dispute. When no compromise was possible Wilfrid left Northumbria for Mercia, and Bosa was returned to York.|$|E

5|$|After this, the Spartans {{sent out}} a new commander, Anaxibius, to Abydos. For <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> <b>he</b> enjoyed a number of successes against Pharnabazus, and seized a number of Athenian {{merchant}} ships. Worried that Thrasybulus's accomplishments were being undermined, the Athenians sent Iphicrates to the region to confront Anaxibius. For a time, the two forces merely raided each other's territory, but eventually Iphicrates succeeded in guessing where Anaxibius would bring his troops on a return march from a campaign against Antandrus, and ambushed the Spartan force. When Anaxibius and his men, who were strung out {{in the line of}} march, had entered the rough, mountainous terrain in which Iphicrates and his men were waiting, the Athenians emerged and ambushed them, killing Anaxibius and many others.|$|E
5|$|Based only on {{uncertain}} {{descriptions of}} the first practical telescope which Hans Lippershey tried to patent in the Netherlands in 1608, Galileo, in the following year, made a telescope with about 3x magnification. He later made improved versions with up to about 30x magnification. With a Galilean telescope, the observer could see magnified, upright images on the earth—it was what {{is commonly known as}} a terrestrial telescope or a spyglass. He could also use it to observe the sky; for <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> {{was one of those who}} could construct telescopes good enough for that purpose. On 25 August 1609, he demonstrated one of his early telescopes, with a magnification of about 8 or 9, to Venetian lawmakers. His telescopes were also a profitable sideline for Galileo, who sold them to merchants who found them useful both at sea and as items of trade. He published his initial telescopic astronomical observations in March 1610 in a brief treatise entitled Sidereus Nuncius (Starry Messenger).|$|E
5|$|Born to an upper-middle-class {{family in}} Saint Ann Parish, Williamson {{initially}} considered {{a life in}} the Roman Catholic clergy before deciding to devote himself {{to the cause of}} gay rights in Jamaica. In the 1990s, he purchased an apartment building in the New Kingston area of Kingston, in which he established a gay nightclub, which remained open for two years despite opposition from police. In 1998, he co-founded J-FLAG with other lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights activists, soon becoming the public face of the organisation. As J-FLAG's representative, he argued in favour of LGBT rights during appearances on Jamaican television and radio programs. This attracted great hostility within Jamaica – a country with particularly high rates of anti-gay prejudice – with J-FLAG members receiving death threats and Williamson surviving a knife attack. For <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>he</b> left Jamaica, living in Canada and England for several years, before returning to Kingston in 2002.|$|E

While they are gone, their talking dog Brian is watching Nova just as the show is interrupted to show several episodes of the sitcom One Day at <b>a</b> <b>Time.</b> <b>He</b> tries to change the channel, but is unable to do so (nor he can turn the TV off), losing his intelligence shortly after watching a few episodes.|$|E
5|$|D'Ávila {{had plans}} to {{establish}} a settlement in Montejo's name near Puerto de Caballos, but knew it fell within the jurisdiction of Honduras, and that Cerezeda would never support such a move. In any case, the situation in Trujillo was too precarious for Cerezeda to support a major expedition. D'Ávila became embroiled in the factional politics of the town, taking the part of Diego Díaz de Herrera. After <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> <b>he</b> decided to leave Honduras, and took passage {{with the majority of}} his men on a ship that stopped at Trujillo, which took them back to Yucatán. A few of D'Ávila's men stayed and settled in Trujillo, where the situation continued to deteriorate.|$|E

In November 2012, Day-Lewis received the BAFTA Britannia Award for Excellence in Film.|$|E
