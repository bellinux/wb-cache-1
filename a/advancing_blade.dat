50|$|A {{rotor blade}} that {{is moving in}} the same {{direction}} as the aircraft is called the <b>advancing</b> <b>blade</b> and the blade moving in the opposite direction is called the retreating blade.|$|E
50|$|The Sikorsky S-69 (military {{designation}} XH-59) is {{an experimental}} co-axial compound helicopter developed by Sikorsky Aircraft as the demonstrator of the <b>Advancing</b> <b>Blade</b> Concept (ABC) under US Army and NASA funding.|$|E
50|$|Work {{began on}} {{building}} {{the first of}} these facilities, the new Rolls-Royce <b>Advanced</b> <b>Blade</b> Casting Facility (ABCF). The <b>Advanced</b> <b>Blade</b> Casting Facility been expected to produce its first blades in late 2014, with the facility capable of manufacturing 200,000 blades per year when fully operational. Each blade will be cast to form a single crystal of super alloy, making it extremely strong and able to resist the intense heat inside a jet engine. The 14,000 m2 facility {{would be one of the}} most <b>advanced</b> <b>blade</b> casting facilities in the world, featuring groundbreaking manufacturing techniques such as 3D structured light for geometry inspection.|$|R

25|$|Early iron blades have rounded points due to {{the limited}} {{metallurgy}} of the time. These were still effective for thrusting against lightly armoured opponents. As armour <b>advanced,</b> <b>blades</b> were made narrower, stiffer and sharply pointed to defeat the armour by thrusting.|$|R
5000|$|The {{forces and}} the {{velocities}} acting in a Darrieus turbine are depicted in figure 1. The resultant velocity vector, , is the vectorial sum of the undisturbed upstream air velocity, , and the velocity vector of the <b>advancing</b> <b>blade,</b> [...]|$|E
50|$|Therefore, the BERP blade {{manages to}} make the best of both worlds by {{reducing}} compressibility effects on the <b>advancing</b> <b>blade</b> and delaying the onset of retreating blade stall. The net result is a significant increase in the operational flight envelope.|$|E
50|$|The Sikorsky S-97 Raider is a {{proposed}} high-speed scout and attack compound helicopter {{based on the}} <b>Advancing</b> <b>Blade</b> Concept (ABC), under development by Sikorsky Aircraft. Sikorsky planned to offer it for the United States Army's Armed Aerial Scout program, along with other possible uses. The S-97 made its maiden flight on 22 May 2015.|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted in}} the Langley Transonic Dynamics Tunnel to evaluate differences between an existing utility-class main-rotor blade and an advanced-design main-rotor blade. The two rotor blade designs were compared with regard to rotor performance oscillatory pitch-link loads, and 4 -per-rev vertical fixed-system loads. Tests were conducted in hover and over a range of simulated full-scale gross weights and density altitude conditions at advance ratios from 0. 15 to 0. 40. Results indicate that the <b>advanced</b> <b>blade</b> design offers performance improvements over the baseline blade in both hover and forward flight. Pitch-link oscillatory loads for the baseline rotor were {{more sensitive to the}} test conditions than those of the advanced rotor. The 4 -per-rev vertical fixed-system load produced by the <b>advanced</b> <b>blade</b> was larger than that produced by the baseline blade at all test conditions...|$|R
40|$|Described is {{a formal}} {{optimization}} procedure for helicopter rotor blade design which minimizes hover horsepower while assuring satisfactory forward flight performance. The {{approach is to}} couple hover and forward flight analysis programs with a general-purpose optimization procedure. The resulting optimization system provides a systematic evaluation of the rotor blade design variables and their interaction, thus reducing the time and cost of designing <b>advanced</b> rotor <b>blades.</b> The paper discusses the basis for and details of the overall procedure, describes the generation of <b>advanced</b> <b>blade</b> designs for representative Army helicopters, and compares design and design effort with those from the conventional approach {{which is based on}} parametric studies and extensive cross-plots...|$|R
50|$|The {{approximate}} knife {{advance rate}} {{can be determined}} {{for a set of}} operating conditions using table 6 below. The table indicates the number of hours that the filter can operate in a one-inch pre coat cake; the required condition is that the <b>advance</b> <b>blade</b> must be at a constant position. This method can be used to check for optimum operation range.|$|R
50|$|Contra-rotating rotors like on Sikorsky X2 {{solve the}} problem of lift {{dissymmetry}} by having both left and right sides provide near equal lift with less flapping. The X2 deals with the compressibility issue by reducing its rotor speed from 446 to 360 RPM to keep the <b>advancing</b> <b>blade</b> tip below the sound barrier when going above 200 knots.|$|E
5000|$|Dissymmetry is {{countered by}} [...] "blade flapping": rotor blades are {{designed}} to flap - lift and twist {{in such a way}} that the <b>advancing</b> <b>blade</b> flaps up and develops a smaller angle of attack, thus producing less lift than a rigid blade would. Conversely, the retreating blade flaps down, develops a higher angle of attack, and generates more lift.|$|E
5000|$|Because the <b>advancing</b> <b>blade</b> has higher {{airspeed}} {{than the}} retreating blade and generates a dissymmetry of lift, rotor blades {{are designed to}} [...] "flap" [...] - lift and twist {{in such a way}} that the <b>advancing</b> <b>blade</b> flaps up and develops a smaller angle of attack. Conversely, the retreating blade flaps down, develops a higher angle of attack, and generates more lift. At high speeds, the force on the rotors is such that they [...] "flap" [...] excessively, and the retreating blade can reach too high an angle and stall. For this reason, the maximum safe forward airspeed of a helicopter is given a design rating called VNE, velocity, never exceed. In addition, it is possible for the helicopter to fly at an airspeed where an excessive amount of the retreating blade stalls, which results in high vibration, pitch-up, and roll into the retreating blade.|$|E
40|$|A test to {{determine}} the performance differences between the 27 -percent-scale models of two rotors for the U. S. Army AH- 64 helicopter was conducted in the Langley 14 - by 22 -Foot Subsonic Tunnel. One rotor, {{referred to as the}} baseline rotor, simulated the geometry and dynamic characteristics of the production baseline rotor, and the other rotor, referred to as the advanced rotor, was designed to have improved hover performance. During the performance test, the dynamic pitch-link forces and blade bending and torsion moments were also measured. Dynamic data from the forward flight investigation are reduced and presented. The <b>advanced</b> <b>blade</b> set was designed to have dynamic characteristics {{similar to those of the}} baseline rotor so that test conditions would not be limited by potential rotor instability and blade resonances, and so that the measured performance increments could be considered to be due purely to aerodynamic causes. Data show consistent trends with advance ratio for both blade sets with generally higher oscillatory loads occurring for the <b>advanced</b> <b>blade</b> set when compared with the baseline blade set...|$|R
5000|$|Dulas, Anglesey {{received}} permission in March 2014 {{to install}} a prototype VAWT on the breakwater at Port Talbot waterside. The turbine is a new design, supplied by Wales-based C-FEC (Swansea), and will be operated for a two-year trial. This VAWT incorporates a wind shield which blocks the wind from the <b>advancing</b> <b>blades,</b> and thus requires a wind-direction sensor and a positioning mechanism, {{as opposed to the}} [...] "egg-beater" [...] types of VAWTs discussed above.|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedThe flow around second-generation controlled diffusion blades in cascade at stall was examined experimentally {{through the use}} of a two-component laser-Doppler velocimeter (LDV). The experimental results were compared with computational fluid dynamics predictions in order to provide information that will allow for more exact design of <b>advanced</b> <b>blades.</b> Midspan blade surface pressure data were also collected over a range of Reynolds numbersbased on chord of 270, 000 to 720, 000. Pressure distribution plots verified that the blades were in the stalled condition. The LDV measurement surveys were taken at one inlet station, at three stations on the suction side of the blade, and at three stations in the wake...|$|R
5000|$|Retreating blade stall. As {{forward speed}} of the {{helicopter}} increases, the airflow over the retreating blade becomes relatively slower, while the airflow over the <b>advancing</b> <b>blade</b> is relatively faster, creating more lift. If not counteracted by flapping, this would cause dissymmetry of lift and eventually retreating blade stall, and blade stability suffers as the blade reaches its limits for flapping.|$|E
50|$|HSI {{noise is}} caused by {{transonic}} flow shock formation on the advancing rotor blade, and is distinct from loading noise. The source of HSI noise is the flow volume around the <b>advancing</b> <b>blade</b> tip, hence it cannot be captured by examining only the acoustic sources {{on the surface of}} the blade, HSI noise is typically directed in the rotor plane forward of the helicopter, like thickness noise.|$|E
50|$|The R44 is a single-engined {{helicopter}} with a semi-rigid two-bladed main rotor, a two-bladed {{tail rotor}} and a skid landing gear. It has an enclosed cabin with {{two rows of}} side-by-side seating for a pilot and three passengers. Tail rotor direction of rotation on the R44 is reversed compared to the R22 for improved yaw control authority. On the R44 the <b>advancing</b> <b>blade</b> is on the bottom.|$|E
40|$|LecturePg. 69 - 78 The <b>advanced</b> {{integral}} shroud <b>blade</b> (ISB) {{structure has}} been developed to improve the reliability and thermal efficiency of mechanical drive steam turbines. This advanced ISB {{has been applied to}} not only the control stage blades but also the intermediate stage blades. Turbines using these <b>advanced</b> <b>blades</b> have been successfully operated. This paper presents the analysis method to calculate the vibratory stresses of the ISB caused by the stage interaction force and the shock load. The vibration response characteristics are explained and comparisons are made to the advanced ISB structure and the conventional grouped blade structure, using the calculated results. Additional verification test results to confirm the validity of the proposed analysis method are also shown...|$|R
2500|$|The {{power system}} and wings are mounted above the centre {{fuselage}} with interconnecting shafts ensuring synchronisation {{of the main}} rotors which overlapped by about [...] [...] Drag and lift losses are reduced by the inverse taper wings with minimum chord in regions of strongest down-wash. The interconnecting shafts also ensured symmetrical lift distribution in event of engine failure. To optimise control in roll and yaw the rotors are arranged to turn in opposite directions with the port rotor turning anti-clockwise and the starboard rotor turning clockwise, ensuring that the <b>advancing</b> <b>blades</b> pass over the fuselage.|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of lower speed, 5 foot diameter model general aviation propellers, was {{tested in the}} Lewis wind tunnel. Performance was evaluated for various levels of airfoil technology and activity factor. The difference was associated with inadequate modeling of blade and spinner losses for propellers round shank blade designs. Suggested concepts for improvement are: (1) <b>advanced</b> <b>blade</b> shapes (airfoils and sweep); (2) tip devices (proplets); (3) integrated propeller/nacelles; and (4) composites. Several advanced aerodynamic concepts were evaluated in the Lewis wind tunnel. Results show that high propeller performance can be obtained to at least Mach 0. 8...|$|R
50|$|Balancing lift {{across the}} rotor disc is {{important}} to a helicopter's stability. The amount of lift generated by an airfoil {{is proportional to the}} square of its airspeed. In a zero airspeed hover the rotor blades, regardless of their position in rotation, have equal airspeeds and therefore equal lift. In forward flight the <b>advancing</b> <b>blade</b> has a higher airspeed than the retreating blade, creating unequal lift across the rotor disc.|$|E
50|$|In a {{retreating}}-blade stall, however, {{only the}} retreating {{half of the}} helicopter's rotor disc experiences a stall. The <b>advancing</b> <b>blade</b> continues to generate lift, but the retreating blade enters a stall condition, usually resulting in an uncommanded increase in pitch of the nose and a roll {{in the direction of}} the retreating side of the rotor disc. In counter-clockwise rotating rotor systems (as in most American-made types) this is the left side. In clockwise rotating systems it is a roll to the right.|$|E
50|$|The 106-hour {{test program}} for the XH-59A ended in 1981. In 1982 it was {{proposed}} that the XH-59A be converted to the XH-59B configuration with advanced rotors, new powerplants (two GE T700s), and a ducted pusher propeller at the tail. This proposed program did not proceed as Sikorsky refused to pay {{a share of the}} costs. Sikorsky and its partners funded the development of the next helicopters using the <b>Advancing</b> <b>Blade</b> Concept; the Sikorsky X2 and Sikorsky S-97 Raider after 2007.|$|E
50|$|Thus, in summary; If {{main rotor}} rpm is too low, {{the speed at}} which the {{retreating}} blade sections stall will be the maximum speed limit. If the main rotor rpm is too high, {{the speed at which}} the <b>advancing</b> <b>blades</b> encounter supersonic airflow would be the maximum speed limit. Even to the casual observer it should be clear that the designer should aim for a balance between these two limits. It should also be mentioned that in addition to these two addressed issues, there are a host of others which also contribute to maximum airspeed limits.|$|R
50|$|One {{solution}} to this problem is to increase the rotor rpm so that the relative airspeed of the retreating blades are higher. However, this solution also has its limits. As any airfoil approaches the speed of sound it encounters a problem known as wave drag.　Airfoils designed for subsonic flight will experience a significant increase in drag if they are subjected to transonic or higher airspeeds. If the rotor rpm were to be increased in an attempt to alleviate retreating blade stall, the helicopter will face a maximum speed induced by extreme drag of the rotor' <b>advancing</b> <b>blades</b> as their tips approach supersonic relative airspeed.|$|R
50|$|Turning {{the crank}} slowly <b>advanced</b> the <b>blade</b> into the boot, {{punching}} {{a hole through}} the center of the instep. The resultant wound was so large that it was not unusual for the prisoner to die of toxaemia soon after.|$|R
5000|$|Transonic drag {{near the}} rotor blade tip. The faster-moving <b>advancing</b> <b>blade</b> tip {{may begin to}} {{approach}} the speed of sound, where transonic drag begins to rise steeply, and severe buffeting and vibration effects can occur. This effect prevents any further increase in speed, even if the helicopter has surplus power remaining, {{and even if it}} features a highly streamlined fuselage. A similar effect prevents propeller-driven aircraft from achieving supersonic speeds, although they can achieve higher speeds than a helicopter, since the propeller blade isn't advancing in the direction of travel.|$|E
5000|$|P-Factor is {{sometimes}} erroneously explained {{with the word}} [...] "bite", as in [...] "the descending blade has a bigger bite, or angle of attack, than the ascending blade". This faulty explanation {{does not take into}} account the forward motion of the blades as aircraft's angle of attack increases. In order to better understand this concept, imagine a propeller aircraft moving forward with a 90° angle of attack (vertical). This situation is identical to what a helicopter experiences, but a helicopter can reduce or increase the angle of attack of individual blades of the rotor (decreasing the angle of attack on the <b>advancing</b> <b>blade,</b> while increasing the angle of attack on the retreating blade) in order to keep the lift of the rotor disc balanced. Because the force of the air on the blades moving forwards through the arc is greater, they will produce more thrust than the blades that move backwards. If the blades of the rotor were unable to independently change their angle of attack there would be a constant backwards rolling motion due to the increased lift on the side of the rotor disc with the <b>advancing</b> <b>blade.</b> In a fixed-wing aircraft, there is usually no way to adjust the angle of attack of the individual blades of the propellers, therefore the pilot must contend with P-Factor and use the rudder to counteract the shift of thrust.|$|E
50|$|At {{the same}} time, the <b>advancing</b> <b>blade</b> creates more lift {{traveling}} forward, the retreating blade produces less lift. If the aircraft were to accelerate {{to the air}} speed that the blade tips are spinning, the retreating blade passes through air moving {{at the same speed}} of the blade and produces no lift at all, resulting in very high torque stresses on the central shaft that can tip down the retreating-blade side of the vehicle, and cause a loss of control. Dual counter-rotating blades prevent this situation due to having two advancing and two retreating blades with balanced forces.|$|E
50|$|Like many {{helicopters}} {{designed in}} France and Russia, the main rotor <b>blades</b> <b>advance</b> to the left.|$|R
40|$|A {{survey is}} {{presented}} of current research efforts in general aviation, low-speed propeller design and high-speed propfan design, with attention on such features as (1) <b>advanced</b> <b>blade</b> shapes, with novel airfoils and sweep, (2) tip devices, (3) integrated propeller/nacelle designs, (4) area-ruled spinners, (5) lightweight, all-composite blade construction, and (6) contra-rotating propfan systems. The potential overall improvements {{associated with these}} design modifications are calculated to lie at 10 - 15 % for low-speed rotors and 15 - 30 % for high-speed ones. Emphasis is placed on noise reduction, blade drag, performance prediction methods and wind tunnel testing of alternative rotor configurations. Extensive use of graphs is made in performance comparisons between alternative blade and rotor designs...|$|R
40|$|The double-sweep is a {{relatively}} new <b>advanced</b> <b>blade</b> shape employed in the rotorcraft industry, mainly, to alleviate rotor noise. The aeroelastic effects of this advanced shape have been relatively less discussed in the open literature. The current work involves a study concerning the effects of a double-sweep, along with a tip-anhedral, on the aeroelastic loads and structural dynamics of a rotor blade. For carrying out this analysis, a comprehensive simulation tool employing the Peters-He dynamic wake model and the ONERA dynamic stall model for air loads is used. It is shown that the double-sweep geometry causes large lag shear forces, lag as well as torsional moments at the blade root and at the double-sweep junction...|$|R
