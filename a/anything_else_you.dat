Brian Baumgartner, who portrays Kevin, actually succeeded in making 14 free-throw shots, of which several {{were included in the}} final footage. Steve Carell later said of his basketball skills, [...] "The thing about looking like you're bad at basketball is, it's like <b>anything</b> <b>else,</b> <b>you</b> have to be incredibly good in order to look bad [...] but that's not the case with me and basketball. I just was bad." [...] However, Carell joked that he would [...] "kick ass" [...] at a hockey episode, a reference to his real-life hockey skills.|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{planning}} to perform [...] "Frozen" [...] in Werchter? I didn't expect <b>anything</b> <b>else,</b> <b>you</b> know. I don't even mind. It just {{would be nice}} because I would finally get some money after all these years, because the case is still going on. I'm {{certainly not going to}} the concert. My lawyer is following the case. I'm really going to follow Madonna's concert with interest, because she really can't perform the song. Yet, I think we won't immediately take steps. The court's decision is subject to various interpretations. The song can't be played on the radio or be sold, but have we arguments enough for the concert to be over? We won't bring additional spectacle to the show. Unnecessary scandals, with Madonna it's guaranteed.|$|E
500|$|As Milo {{struggles with}} words and begins {{the process of}} making himself their master, he also has {{difficulty}} with numbers, especially when he speaks with [...]58 of a child, who with parents and two siblings (whom Milo does not meet) makes up an average family. Milo has had difficulties in school with mathematics and problem solving; his reaction to this encounter is to protest that averages are not real. [...] The partial child enlightens Milo that there is beauty in math beyond the tedium of learning an endless set of rules, [...] "one of the nicest things about mathematics, or <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> <b>you</b> might care to learn, {{is that many of the}} things which can never be, often are". Late in the book, Princess Reason counsels Milo, who has much learning ahead of him, not to be discouraged by its complexity, [...] "You must never feel badly about making mistakes... as long as you take the trouble to learn from them. For you often learn more by being wrong for the right reasons than you do by being right for the wrong reasons". An index card in the Juster papers sets forth the germ of the princess' [...] "memorable" [...] counsel to Milo, [...] "Quite often the road to Rhyme + Reason is through the right mistakes." ...|$|E

2500|$|During the 1940 season, {{government}} {{construction of}} air fields and radio beacon stations created {{a lot of}} business for Northwestern.

[...] The airfield at McGrath was almost midway between Anchorage and Nome, and 8 to 10 planes were landing there every day during the summer of 1940.|$|E
