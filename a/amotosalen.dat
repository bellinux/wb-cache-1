This presents a serious challenge in safeguarding blood products. Transmission of T. cruzi from blood products is a frequent occurrence in Latin America, where Chagas' disease is endemic. This study was designed to determine whether T. cruzi could be inactivated in human platelet concentrates and plasma by a photochemical treatment process with long-wavelength UV A light (UVA, 320 to 400 nm) plus the psoralen <b>amotosalen</b> HCl (Cerus Corporation). Units of platelet concentrates (300 ml) and plasma (300 ml) were intentionally contaminated with approximately 106 T. cruzi trypomastigotes, the T. cruzi form found in the bloodstream, per ml. The viability of T. cruzi after photochemical inactivation was determined by their ability to replicate in 3 T 3 fibroblasts. Controls, including treatment with 150 μM <b>amotosalen</b> or 3 J/cm 2 UVA alone, did not lead to reduction of the viability of T. cruzi in plasma or platelet concentrates. However, treatment with 150 μM <b>amotosalen</b> plus 3 J/cm 2 UVA inactivated T. cruzi to undetectable levels in plasma and platelet concentrates. This represented a > 5. 4 -log reduction of T. cruzi in platelet concentrates and > 5. 0 -log reduction of T. cruzi in plasma.

We were {{surprised to find that}} amotosalen-treated donor T cells persisted long-term in vivo, comprising 6 % to 10 % on average of the T-cell compartment of transplant recipients at 4 months after transplantation. Donor T cells derived from amotosalen-treated splenocytes were predominantly polyclonal CD 44 hi/int CD 8 + memory T cells and were functionally active, synthesizing interferon γ in response to stimulation with murine cytomegalovirus antigen. Amotosalen-treated donor T cells, reisolated from BMT recipients’ spleens ≥ 4 months after transplantation, proliferated in vitro, thus indicating repair of amotosalen-mediated DNA cross-links. Compared with infusion of untreated donor splenocytes, amotosalen-treated cells enhanced thymopoiesis by bone marrow-derived stem cells in BMT recipients. However, <b>amotosalen</b> treatment abrogated the thymopoietic activity of lymphoid progenitor cells among the donor splenocytes. Thus, infusion of amotosalen-treated donor T cells produced rapid immune reconstitution after major histocompatibility complex-mismatched BMT by transferring long-lived polyclonal memory T cells with antiviral activity and also by enhancing bone marrow-derived thymopoiesis.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to conduct a {{systematic}} review on the photoinactivators used in hemotherapy, with action on viral genomes. The SciELO, Science Direct, PubMed and Lilacs databases were searched for articles. The inclusion criterion was that these should be articles on inactivators with action on genetic material that had been published between 2000 and 2010. The key words used in identifying such articles were "hemovigilance", "viral inactivation", "photodynamics", "chemoprevention" and "transfusion safety". Twenty-four articles on viral photoinactivation were found with the main photoinactivators covered being: methylene blue, <b>amotosalen</b> HCl, S- 303 frangible anchor linker effector (FRALE), riboflavin and inactin. The results showed that methylene blue has currently been studied least, because it diminishes coagulation factors and fibrinogen. Riboflavin has been studied most because it is a photoinactivator of endogenous origin and has few collateral effects. <b>Amotosalen</b> HCl is effective for platelets and is also used on plasma, but may cause changes both to plasma and to platelets, although these are not significant for hemostasis. S- 303 FRALE may lead to neoantigens in erythrocytes and is less indicated for red-cell treatment; in such cases, PEN 110 is recommended. Thus, none of the methods for pathogen reduction is effective for all classes of agents and for all blood components, but despite the high cost, these photoinactivators may diminish the risk of blood-transmitted diseases...|$|E

Current methods of separating antiviral T {{cells from the}} alloreactive T cells that produce GVHD are neither routine nor rapid. In a model of lethal murine CMV (MCMV) infection following MHC-mismatched bone marrow transplantation, infusion of MCMV-immune donor lymphocytes pretreated with the DNA cross-linking compound amo-tosalen prevented MCMV lethality without producing GVHD. Although 95 % of mice receiving 30 106 pretreated donor lymphocytes survived beyond day 100 without MCMV disease or GVHD, all mice receiving equivalent numbers of untreated lymphocytes rapidly died of GVHD. In vitro, <b>amotosalen</b> blocked T cell proliferation without suppressing MCMV peptide-induced IFN- production by MCMV-primed CD 8 T cells. In vivo, pretreated lymphocytes reduced hepatic MCMV load by 4 -log 10 and promoted full hemopoietic chimerism.

40|$|Background: Photochemical {{treatment}} (PCT) of {{platelet concentrates}} using photosensitizers and ultraviolet light illumination reduces the proliferation potential of pathogens by damaging biomolecules. Materials and Methods: The impact of riboflavin (RF-PRT) - and <b>amotosalen</b> (AS-PCT) -based pathogen inactivation on platelets was studied using microfluidic flow chambers on immobilized collagen using standard platelet concentrates prepared from buffy coats in additive solution. Flow cytometry, metabolic parameters and light transmission aggregometry with thrombin-related peptide, collagen and ristocetin were determined concurrently. Results: Both PCTs significantly decreased the platelet surface coverage kinetics in flow chambers {{over the course}} of the 7 -day study. Platelet aggregation was affected following RF-PRT in response to all agonists, while AS-PCT mainly impacted low-dose ristocetin agglutination. RF-PRT induces premature platelet activation because integrin (IIb 3) was spontaneously activated, and -degranulation, phosphatidylserine/-ethanolamine exposure and anaerobic metabolism significantly increased following treatment, which was not the case for AS-PCT. On the other hand, AS-PCT significantly diminished thrombus growth onto von Willebrand factor under shear flow. This defect was caused by fewer integrin (IIb 3) interactions, not by defective GPIb-VWF binding as shown by adhesion experiments in the presence of tirofiban. Moreover, integrin (IIb 3) activation was also affected following the activation of platelets via GPVI-FcRIIa or PAR 1. Finally, <b>amotosalen</b> illumination as such is sufficient to induce platelet damage, with no additional measurable effect of the chemical adsorption step.

40|$|Pathogen {{reduction}} in blood components represents a proactive {{approach in the}} prevention of spreading blood-borne pathogens via transfusion. Solvent-detergent pathogen reduction technology has been in routine use for more than two decades. Most current techniques use molecules which target viral, bacterial, protozoan or leukocyte nucleic acids and, with subsequent illumination, disable their replication. Beside pathogen reduction effect, some techniques successfully inactivate leukocytes, thus lowering the number of adverse reactions caused by them. Pathogen reduction system is expected to selectively reduce pathogen load while simultaneously preserving blood component function. This aim is very ambitious and still not attained. The technology must be non-toxic, must not form neoantigens and must preserve clinical function of blood components. Four systems currently used in Europe are: solvent/detergent (SD) pathogen reduction technology, methylene blue (MB) plus visible light reduction technology, <b>amotosalen</b> plus UVA light and riboflavin plus UV light technology. The technology which utilizes <b>amotosalen</b> and UV light for pathogen {{reduction in}} platelet components was introduced into routine practice of the Blood Transfusion Centre of Slovenia in 2008. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages. So far, a system for universal inactivation of all three components has not been developed. Studies for whole blood inactivation system are ongoing. In view of the low risk in transmitting classical transfusion diseases, this approach will be the only pathogen reduction technology the implementation of which will be justifiedwith respect to cost/benefit issues. The other question is how long can we wait and if we can wait at all? In developing countries such a technology can mean difference between life and death. We will present the mechanisms of action, processing, toxicology profile, pathogen reduction efficacy, adverse effects and clinical experience of the methods mentioned above...|$|E

Two methods for treatment of single plasma units are available: <b>amotosalen</b> plus ultraviolet A light and methylene blue plus visible light. This study compared the quality and stability of plasma treated with these two methods. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Plasma units made {{from a pool of}} two ABO-matched fresh apheresis units were photochemically treated with either <b>amotosalen</b> (PCT-FFP) or methylene blue (MB-FFP). A total of 12 paired samples were evaluated. Plasma coagulation function was assessed at three time points: immediately after treatment, after 30 days of frozen storage, and an additional 24 hours at 4 degrees C after thawing. Comparison between PCT-FFP and MB-FFP was assessed with the paired t test and a p value of less than 0. 05 indicated statistical significance. RESULTS: Based on statistical analysis, mean levels of factor (F) II, FXII, FXIII, von Willebrand antigen, ADAMTS- 13, D-dimers, and protein C were equivalent between PCT-FFP and MB-FFP for all three time points. PCT-FFP exhibited shorter mean prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time (two time points), and thrombin time and higher mean levels of fibrinogen, FXI, and protein S than MB-FFP. Retention of FV, FVII, FVIII, FX, or von Willebrand factor:ristocetin cofactor in PCT-FFP was either equivalent to or higher than MB-FFP. MB-FFP contained higher mean levels of plasminogen, antithrombin, and plasmin inhibitor than PCT-FFP. Retention of F IX in MB-FFP was higher than PCT-FFP only after the 4 degrees C storage after thawing. CONCLUSION: There is adequate preservation of therapeutic coagulation factor activities in both PCT-FFP and MB-FFP.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Apheresis or buffy-coat PLT components were leukoreduced, suspended in approximately 35 percent plasma and 65 percent PLT additive solution, and treated with the INTERCEPT process. Blood centers were requested to complete a safety data form after each transfusion. RESULTS: Data for 5106 INTERCEPT components administered to 651 patients were monitored. A total of 5051 (98. 9 %) transfusions and 609 (93. 5 %) patients had no reported reactions. Fifty-five (1. 1 %) transfusions were associated with adverse events, and 42 (0. 8 %) were possibly, probably, or related to the PLT transfusion.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{effect of}} {{photochemical}} pathogen reduction (PR) methods on plasma quality {{has been the}} subject of several reports but solid comparative data for the different technologies are lacking. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Plasma (n[*]=[*] 24) photoinactivated with methylene blue (MB), riboflavin (RF), or <b>amotosalen</b> (AS) was compared using a pool-and-split design. Samples were taken before and after treatment with each method and tested for coagulation factors (fibrinogen, Factor [F] II, FV, FVIII, F[*]IX, FXI), natural coagulation inhibitors (Protein C [PC], protein S [PS], antithrombin III [AT]), prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), and thrombin generation (TG). The three methods were mutually compared by repeated-measures analysis of variance. RESULTS: All three PR methods cause significant reduction (p[*]<[*] 0. 01) of activity of the procoagulant proteins fibrinogen, FII, FV, FVIII, F[*]IX, and FXI. Coagulation is also affected, with significant changes in PT, APTT, and TG. RF treatment causes a significantly higher decrease in concentration of coagulation factors, PS, and AT than the other methods (p[*]<[*] 0. 01). PT, APTT, and TG are also affected most by RF treatment. FII, FVIII, F[*]IX, PC, AT, and PT are best preserved with the MB method and FV, FXI, and TG after AS treatment (p[*]<[*] 0. 01).

METHODS: The focus of this ongoing haemovigilance programme is to document all AEs associated with PCT-PLT transfusion. Data collected for AEs include: time of event after starting transfusion, clinical descriptions, vital signs, results from radiographs and bacterial cultures, event severity (Grade 0 - 4) and causal relationship to PCT-PLT transfusion. RESULTS: One thousand four hundred patients (mean 60 years, range 1 - 96) received PCT-PLT transfusions. The majority of the patients (53. 4 %) had haematology-oncology diseases and required conventional chemotherapy (44. 8 %) or stem cell transplantation (8. 6 %). Sixty-eight PCT-PLT transfusions were associated with AE. Acute transfusion reactions (ATR), classified as an AE possibly related, probably related, or related to PCT-PLT transfusions were infrequent (n = 55, 55 / 7437 = 0. 7 %) and most were of Grade 1 severity. Thirty-nine patients (39 / 1400 = 2. 8 %) experienced one or more ATRs. The most frequently reported signs/symptoms were chills, fever, urticaria, dyspnoea, nausea and vomiting. Five AEs were considered severe (> or = Grade 2); however, no causal relationship to PCT-PLT transfusion was found. Repeated exposure to PCT-PLT did not increase the likelihood of an ATR.

RESULTS: To date, 3232 patients (59. 1 % male) with a primary indication for plasma transfusion due to a hematology disorder (23. 1 %), surgery (32. 4 %), or a general medical condition (44. 4 %) received 7483 PCT-plasma transfusions (composed of 19, 069 apheresis plasma components). The {{mean age of the}} patient population was 57. 3 years (2884 adults, 160 children, and 188 infants). ATRs were reported for 8 / 7483 transfusions (0. 11 %; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 03 - 0. 19) and 8 / 3232 patients (0. 25 %; 95 % CI, 0. 08 - 0. 42 %). Five ATRs were of Grade 1 severity. The remaining three ATRs were classified as serious. No deaths or episodes of transfusion-related acute lung injury attributed to a PCT-plasma transfusion were reported. CONCLUSION: PCT-plasma transfusions were well tolerated in routine clinical use. The EDCS HV program facilitated collection and reporting of safety information on a real-time basis from multiple sites...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Trials of transfusions of {{platelets}} (PLTs) {{treated with}} amotosalen-based pathogen reduction (PR) showed lower corrected count increments (CCIs) compared to conventional PLT components (PCs). However, PR-PLTs and conventional PCs often differed in various factors besides PR. We compared transfusion efficacy of single-donor apheresis PCs treated with PR or gamma irradiation. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Hematologic patients {{were assigned to}} receive PR-PLTs or gamma-irradiated conventional PCs, both prepared in PLT additive solution (PAS). One-hour CCI (primary endpoint), 24 -hour CCI, time to next PLT transfusion, and transfusion requirement of red blood cells and plasma were analyzed. RESULTS: Forty-four patients assigned to PR-PLTs received 220 PR-PLTs and 136 conventional PCs; 72 controls received 517 conventional PCs. No differences between patient groups were observed for mean (±standard deviation [SD]) 1 -hour CCI (11. 4 [± 4. 9] for PR-PLT vs. 11. 0 [± 4. 9] for controls), mean (±SD) 24 -hour CCI (6. 1 [± 4. 4] for PR-PLTs vs. 6. 2 [± 4. 8] for controls), and for the other evaluated outcomes. No differences between PC types were observed for mean (±SD) 1 -hour CCI (10. 6 [± 6. 7] for PR-PLTs vs. 9. 9 [± 6. 2] for conventional PCs) and mean 24 hour-CCI (3. 3 [± 3. 9] for PR-PLTs vs. 4. 2 [± 5] for conventional PCs). Thirty-five percent of PR-PLTs and 38 % of conventional PCs (p[*]=[*] 0. 63) were associated with 1 -hour CCIs of less than 7. 5. Inadequate 24 -hour CCIs were observed for 72 % of PR-PLTs and 64 % of conventional PCs (p[*]=[*] 0. 002). CONCLUSIONS: Transfusion efficacy of single-donor apheresis PCs in PAS treated with <b>amotosalen</b> PR versus gamma irradiation is comparable...|$|E

Lion, N. info:eu-repo/semantics/article article 2016 Transfusion 5671819 - 1827 <![CDATA[BACKGROUND: Pathogen inactivation treatments such as INTERCEPT aim to make sure blood and blood-derived products are free of pathogens before using them for transfusion purposes. At present, there is no established quality control assay that assesses the completeness of the treatment. As INTERCEPT is a photochemical treatment known to generate reactive oxygen species we sought to use the antioxidant power (AOP) of the blood product as a marker of treatment execution. In this perspective, we evaluated an electrochemically based miniaturized system, the EDEL technology, for measuring the AOP in both platelet concentrates (PCs) and plasma. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Aliquots were withdrawn from PCs or plasma units before and after INTERCEPT treatment and a few microliters were directly deposited into the EDEL sensor for the AOP measurement. The result is expressed in EDEL, an arbitrary unit (micromolar equivalent of ascorbic acid). RESULTS: The INTERCEPT treatment resulted in a significant decrease of the AOP. An AOP threshold of 66. 5, 89. 0, 59. 8, and 131. 5 EDEL was determined for apheresis PCs collected from female and male donors, buffy coat PCs, and plasma units, respectively. Below the threshold value, INTERCEPT treatment is considered to be executed. Additionally, we showed that the presence of the photosensitizer in combination with the ultraviolet A illumination is required to observe the AOP decrease. CONCLUSION: The measurement of the AOP of PCs and plasma units can be used to document the completeness of the INTERCEPT treatment...|$|E
