The number of {{patients with}}out any infection in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group was 13 compared to only three in the control group (p < 0. 01). Patients in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group needed parenteral antibiotics during 3 3 % of the days they were granulocytopenic compared to 6 1 % of these days for patients in the control group. However, six of nine bacteriologically documented infections in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group were caused by resistant microorganisms compared to two out of 20 in the control group. INFECTIONS are a frequent consequence of the severe granulocytopenia in patients with acute leukaemia (1). Patients with <b>acute</b> <b>nonlymphocytic</b> <b>leukaemia</b> are espe-cially susceptible to bacterial infections during remission induction treatment. They usually become infected by aerobic gram-negative rods from the alimentary tract (2, 3). The commonest infections are pneumonia, oesophagi-tis, pharyngitis, skin infections, and perianal and perirec-tal lesions. Various methods to prevent infections in these patients have been studied.

The leukaemic cells tested also displayed survival curves with negligible shoulders and steep slopes (average value of D 0 = 0. 66 Gy).

40|$|One {{hundred and}} eight unselected {{patients}} with <b>acute</b> <b>nonlymphocytic</b> leukemia (ANLL) {{were treated with}} a combination of daunorubicin, cytosine arabinoside and 6 -thioguanine (DAT). The complete remission rate was 54. 6 % and was achieved after an average of 2. 3 courses of therapy. Among the initial variables, erythroleukemia morphology was the single most important prognostic factor, being associated with a poorer response rate (14. 2 %). Median remission duration was 48 weeks and median survival was 75 weeks; the estimated proportions of responders alive at 1 and 2 y from diagnosis were 71 and 35 % respectively. Severe myelosuppression was the most common toxic effect observed during induction. DAT combination is an effective remission induction regimen for ANLL patients of all age groups. ¬© 1979...|$|R
