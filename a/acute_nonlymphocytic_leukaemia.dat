The number of {{patients with}}out any infection in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group was 13 compared to only three in the control group (p < 0. 01). Patients in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group needed parenteral antibiotics during 3 3 % of the days they were granulocytopenic compared to 6 1 % of these days for patients in the control group. However, six of nine bacteriologically documented infections in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group were caused by resistant microorganisms compared to two out of 20 in the control group. INFECTIONS are a frequent consequence of the severe granulocytopenia in patients with acute leukaemia (1). Patients with <b>acute</b> <b>nonlymphocytic</b> <b>leukaemia</b> are espe-cially susceptible to bacterial infections during remission induction treatment. They usually become infected by aerobic gram-negative rods from the alimentary tract (2, 3). The commonest infections are pneumonia, oesophagi-tis, pharyngitis, skin infections, and perianal and perirec-tal lesions. Various methods to prevent infections in these patients have been studied. The results of using protective isolation or prophylactic nonabsorbable antibiotics to prevent infection are not always convincing and compa-rable (4 - 6).

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{ionizing}} radiation {{on the growth}} of bone marrow cells from haematologically normal controls or from patients with <b>acute</b> <b>nonlymphocytic</b> <b>leukaemia</b> was studied using colony formation as an endpoint. A modified agar culture method which incorporated daily feeding with new medium was utilized to allow the growth of leukaemic cell colonies.

The leukaemic cells tested also displayed survival curves with negligible shoulders and steep slopes (average value of D 0 = 0. 66 Gy).

40|$|One {{hundred and}} eight unselected {{patients}} with <b>acute</b> <b>nonlymphocytic</b> leukemia (ANLL) {{were treated with}} a combination of daunorubicin, cytosine arabinoside and 6 -thioguanine (DAT). The complete remission rate was 54. 6 % and was achieved after an average of 2. 3 courses of therapy. Among the initial variables, erythroleukemia morphology was the single most important prognostic factor, being associated with a poorer response rate (14. 2 %). Median remission duration was 48 weeks and median survival was 75 weeks; the estimated proportions of responders alive at 1 and 2 y from diagnosis were 71 and 35 % respectively. Severe myelosuppression was the most common toxic effect observed during induction. DAT combination is an effective remission induction regimen for ANLL patients of all age groups. © 1979...|$|R
