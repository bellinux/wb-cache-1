5|$|Balmer was {{promoted}} to temporary group captain on 4May 1944. On 10/11May, his Lancasters took part in <b>a</b> <b>raid</b> <b>on</b> Lille, losing three of their number. In an effort {{to shore up the}} morale of his younger crews, Balmer decided to personally lead their next mission the following night, against a military camp at Bourg-Léopold (Leopoldsburg), Belgium. It was planned to be his last operation before going on to a more senior position. His aircraft failed to return from the raid, causing considerable shock to his unit. The next day, Balmer's place as commanding officer of No.467 Squadron was taken by Wing Commander William Brill, previously a member of No.463 Squadron RAAF, which was also based at Waddington.|$|E

In 1946, {{after the end of}} the war, Lady Wraxall applied to the Ministry of Defence for a repair grant, but was turned down. As a result damp, and latterly birds, entered the house through the roof light, until the house came into the {{ownership}} of the National Trust and was repaired.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} months of 1930 Aiello {{arranged}} several unsuccessful assassination attempts against Capone bodyguards, including Jack McGurn, Phil D'Andrea and Rocco De Grazia. Aiello hoped to leave Capone vulnerable by depleting his security, and Capone began to suspect Aiello had spies within the Chicago Outfit because he seemed to have inside knowledge about where his targets would be and when. In August 1930, two months before Aiello's death, the state's attorney conducted <b>a</b> <b>raid</b> <b>on</b> Aiello's home, obtaining records as part of a series of raids by the United States government to fight against gangland activities in Chicago.|$|E

Delta subsequently meet CIA agent Jeff Riggs, who is leading <b>a</b> <b>raid</b> <b>on</b> the city's last water supply.
