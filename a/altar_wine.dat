6000|$|But Mr Harford {{was very}} decent and never {{got into a}} wax. All the other masters got into dreadful waxes. But why were they to suffer for what fellows in the higher line did? Wells had {{said that they had}} drunk some of the <b>altar</b> <b>wine</b> out of the press in the sacristy and that it had been found out who had done it by the smell. Perhaps they had stolen a {{monstrance}} to run away with and sell it somewhere. That must have been a terrible sin, to go in there quietly at night, to open the dark press and steal the flashing gold thing into which God was put on the altar in the middle of flowers and candles at benediction while the incense went up in clouds at both sides as the fellow swung the censer and Dominic Kelly sang the first part by himself in the choir. But God was not in it of course when they stole it. But still it was a strange and a great sin even to touch it. He thought of it with deep awe; a terrible and strange sin: it thrilled him to think of it in the silence when the pens scraped lightly. But to drink the <b>altar</b> <b>wine</b> out of the press and be found out by the smell was a sin too: but it was not terrible and strange. It only made you feel a little sickish on account of the smell of the wine. Because on the day when he had made his first holy communion in the chapel he had shut his eyes and opened his mouth and put out his tongue a little: and when the rector had stooped down to give him the holy communion he had smelt a faint winy smell off the rector's breath after the wine of the mass. The word was beautiful: wine. It made you think of dark purple because the grapes were dark purple that grew in Greece outside houses like white temples. But the faint smell of the rector's breath had made him feel a sick feeling on the morning of his first communion. The day of your first communion was the happiest day of your life. And once a lot of generals had asked Napoleon what was the happiest day of his life. They thought he would say the day he won some great battle or the day he was made an emperor. But he said: ...|$|E

50|$|Sacramental wine, Communion wine or <b>altar</b> <b>wine</b> is wine {{obtained}} from grapes and {{intended for use}} in celebration of the Eucharist (referred to also as the Divine Liturgy, the Mass, the Lord's Supper or Holy Communion).

Here at the <b>Altar</b> bread and <b>wine</b> is given which should remind the Christians that Jesus Christ gave his life for our salvation.

50|$|Concannon {{was founded}} in 1883 by James Concannon of Inishmore, County Galway. Its success in {{producing}} and selling sacramental or <b>altar</b> <b>wine</b> for the Roman Catholic Church helped it to survive national Prohibition. Grape cuttings from this vineyard were introduced to Mexico between 1889 and 1904 {{for the improvement of}} its commercial viticulture. As such, the vineyard has been designated a California Historical Landmark (#641).|$|E

50|$|When the tin {{prices fell}} many miners turned to farming. The {{subtropical}} highland climate was very suitable for growing cool climate fruits and vegetables. Grapes were first planted {{here in the}} 1860s with encouragement from the local Catholic parish priest Father Jerome Davadi to produce <b>altar</b> <b>wine.</b> His Italian descent made grape growing and wine production a familiar pastime and the notion caught on in the area. There were plenty of Italian settlers and wine was made for home enjoyment.|$|E
50|$|Aloysius and Father Flynn are {{put into}} direct {{conflict}} when she learns from Sister James that the priest met one-on-one with Donald Muller, St. Nicholas’ first African-American student. Mysterious circumstances lead her to believe that sexual misconduct occurred. In a private meeting purportedly regarding the Christmas pageant, Aloysius, {{in the presence of}} Sister James, openly confronts Flynn with her suspicions. He angrily denies wrongdoing, insisting that he was disciplining Donald for drinking <b>altar</b> <b>wine,</b> claiming to have been protecting the boy from harsher punishment. James is relieved by his explanation. Flynn's next sermon is on the evils of gossip.|$|E

In 1997, the winery moved into the historic Sacred Heart Novitiate facility in Los Gatos and expanded to the entire winemaking facility in 2003. The production of <b>altar</b> <b>wine</b> during Prohibition means the Novitiate is the fourth-oldest continuously operating winery in California. Ed Kurtzman was the label's winemaker until Bill Brosseau took over in 2000.|$|E
50|$|Under {{the pretext}} of {{discussing}} the upcoming school Christmas pageant, Sisters Aloysius and (to a lesser extent) James voice their suspicions that Father Flynn's relationship with Donald may be inappropriate. Several times, Father Flynn asks them to leave the matter alone as a private issue between the boy and himself, but Sister Aloysius persists. Finally, he is pressured into admitting that Donald had been caught drinking <b>altar</b> <b>wine,</b> and he had promised Donald not to tell anyone about the incident. Having now been forced to break that promise and reveal the truth, he will need to dismiss Donald as an altar boy, {{which he had been}} trying to avoid. Before leaving, Father Flynn tells Sister Aloysius he is displeased with her handling of the situation. His next sermon regards gossip and how it is easily spread.|$|E
50|$|In August 1904 {{title to}} the {{property}} passed from Samuel Symons Bassett to The Romavilla Vineyards Limited (The Romavilla Vineyards Pty Limited from 1942). Following his death in late 1912, Bassett's sons expanded the enterprise into the largest wine-producing firm in Queensland. In 1916 the annual output was estimated at 31,000 gallons and the cellar holdings at 100,000 gallons. By 1923 Romavilla was supplying products to individuals and hotels (especially) all over Queensland. Romavilla fortified wines - such as port, sherry and madeira - were particularly popular and for a considerable period Romavilla distilled its own spirits for fortifying wine. By the 1930s the firm was supplying to wine saloons throughout the State; Queensland Government Railways stocked Romavilla port in its refreshment rooms; and Romavilla <b>altar</b> <b>wine</b> was popular in Catholic churches. By 1967 Romavilla Vineyards was the sole remaining commercial winery in Queensland, producing 20,000-30,000 gallons annually, until {{the emergence of a}} boutique wine-making industry in the Stanthorpe district of southern Queensland in the 1970s.|$|E

A no-holds-barred account of a criminal's time in the notorious Dublin prison, as revealed to journalist Paul Howard. This extraordinary life story tells it all. The desperate lifestyle of a junkie; bullying and savage beatings among the prisoners; ingenious drug-smuggling ploys; the despairing cry for help of a failed suicide attempt. But alongside the pain there is humor - from the hilarity of World Cup celebrations to the distraction of a beautiful aerobics teacher, from binging on <b>altar</b> <b>wine</b> to the shortest-ever 'hunger strike'. The first ever glimpse of Mountjoy Prison - from the inside. This title is illustrated with black & white photograph...|$|E
