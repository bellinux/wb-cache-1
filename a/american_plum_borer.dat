50|$|Euzophera semifuneralis, the <b>American</b> <b>plum</b> <b>borer,</b> is a moth of {{the family}} Pyralidae. It is found {{throughout}} the United States, southern Canada and parts of Mexico.|$|E
40|$|Pheromone {{components}} of the <b>American</b> <b>plum</b> <b>borer,</b> Euzophera semifuneralis, were defined by use of the electroantennogram screening technique and capillary gas chromatographic retention times of sex pheromone gland constituents. Field studies showed that greatest attraction was achieved with a 1 mg load rate of a 4 -component blend in a rubber septum. This blend consisted of a 2 : 1 ratio of Z,E- 9, 12 - 14 :ALD and Z 9 - 14 :ALD and {{an equal amount of}} the corresponding alcohols in a 2 : 1 ratio, respectively.

40|$|NYS IPM Type: Fruits IPM Fact SheetThe <b>American</b> <b>plum</b> <b>borer</b> (APB) is a cambium-feeding moth pest {{of fruit}} and {{ornamental}} trees. It is unusual because {{it belongs to the}} pyralid, rather than the sesiid (clearwing) family, which is more commonly associated with this kind of damage. It is the major borer pest of stone fruits in Michigan, causing up to a 33 % decline in the life span of tart cherry trees there. Recent studies indicate that it is the most abundant borer in commercial tart cherry orchards in New York. Significant numbers are also found in peach trees infected by canker diseases. Widely distributed throughout most of North America and parts of South America, it has an extensive range of hosts including at least 15 families of fruit, nut, ornamental, and forest trees, and a few woody annuals. Its rise to major pest status in tart cherry can be traced to bark damaged by mechanical harvesters, which provides larvae an entryway to the cambium...|$|E
40|$|Seventy {{percent of}} dwarf and semidwarf trees have burrknots {{susceptible}} to borer infestation. Prebloom or petalfall applications of Lorsban will control both dogwood borer and <b>American</b> <b>plum</b> <b>borer</b> season-long. T he dogwood borer, Synanthedonscitula (Harris), was first recognizedas a pecan pest during the earl 1940 s, {{but was not}} an economic pest of apple until the introduction of clonal apple rootstocks. Such rootstocks tend to produce burrknots, which are attractive oviposition and entry sites for dogwood borer (Figure 2). Because size-controlling rootstocks have become so prevalent in modern apple culture, the con-sequential incidence of dogwood borer in-festations has also risen. Earlier work in New York (Riedl et. al. 1985) highlighted this borer as a prevalent and important pest of apple. Their examinations of apple orchards in western New York and the Hudson Val-ley revealed that 70 percent of trees on dwarfing or semi-dwarfing rootstocks had burrknots and that an average of 40 percent of the burrknots in any particular orchard were infested by dogwood borers. Dogwood borer is in the family Sesiidae, commonly known as clearwing moths. This family also contains peachtree borer, lesser peachtree borer {{and a number of}} borers that Figure 1.

5000|$|The <b>American</b> <b>plum</b> is {{used for}} both {{ornamental}} and culinary purposes. The white flowers are decorative in spring and its short, single leader makes it a popular residential landscape tree. Sargent says of it: [...] "As an ornamental plant P. americana has real value; the long wand-like branches form a wide, graceful head which is handsome in winter and in spring is covered with masses of pure white flowers followed by ample bright foliage and abundant showy fruit."

50|$|The <b>American</b> <b>plum</b> grows {{as a large}} shrub {{or small}} tree, {{reaching}} up to 15 ft. It is adapted to coarse- and medium-textured soils, but not to fine soils. The shrub is winter-hardy, but has little tolerance for shade, drought, or fire. Its growth is most active in spring and summer, and it blooms in midspring. It propagates by seed, but the rate of spread by seed is slow.|$|R

40|$|<b>American</b> <b>plum</b> line pattern virus (APLPV) was moni-tored monthly {{throughout}} {{a year in}} a Japanese plum tree by using ELISA and dot-blot hybridisation. Leaf samples were tested from March to November and dor-mant buds were tested from December to February. Flowers, cortex and fruits, when available, were also tested. For leaf samples, detection by ELISA and hy-bridisation was reliable from March to May. For dor-mant bud samples, detection was reliable from Decem-ber to February. Detection levels decreased from June to August, and were unsatisfactory from September to November. During this latter period, molecular hybridi-sation was more sensitive than ELISA. Leaves were bet-ter sources of APLPV than flowers and cortical tissues in spring, whereas mature fruits were better sources than leaves in summer. Key words: APLPV, detection, ELISA, molecular hy-bridisation. <b>American</b> <b>plum</b> line pattern virus (APLPV), an ilarvirus characterized by Paulsen and Fulton (1968), was first reported from North America where it infects Japanese plum, peach and flowering cherry inducing chlorotic lines, bands, or oak leaf patterns in the leaves (Fulton, 1982). APLPV is not serologically related to any of the other ilarviruses of stone fruits and can be de-tected by ELISA (Fulton, 1982). The full genomic se-quence of an American isolate of the virus was deter-mined by Scott and Zimmerman (2001), who detected the virus by molecular hybridisation and RT-PCR. More recently, Alayasa et al. (2003) and Herranz et al. (2003) published additional information on detection and se-quencing of other isolates.

40|$|In this study, 34 apricot {{orchards}} in south-eastern Spain {{planted with}} the Spanish cultivar ‘Búlida’ and showing “viruela” symptoms were studied for 2 years. Leaf and fruit samples from four trees in each orchard, either {{with or without}} “viruela” symptoms, were collected and analysed by multiplex RT-PCR {{for the detection of}} <b>American</b> <b>plum</b> line pattern virus (APLPV), Apple chlorotic leaf spot virus (ACLSV), Apple mosaic virus (ApMV), Apricot latent virus (ApLV), Plum bark necrosis and stem pitting-associated virus (PBNSPaV), Plum pox virus (PPV), Prune dwarf virus (PDV), and Prunus necrotic ring spot virus (PNRSV). In addition, molecular hybridization assays were performed for the detection of Hop stunt viroid (HSVd) and Peach latent mosaic viroid (PLMVd). All fruits showing “viruela” symptoms were infected with ACLSV and HSVd, suggesting that these pathogens may be responsible for “viruela” disease. Other viruses including PNRSV, PBNSPaV, ApLV, PDV, ApMV and PPV, were detected to a lesser degree. Detection of ACLSV and HSVd in samples without symptoms could be explained by the influence of environmental conditions and/or the physiological stage of fruits on the expression of symptoms...|$|R
40|$|Roots are the “hidden half ” of the tree’s structure. They {{are vital}} to proper tree growth and functioning, yet they’re often {{overlooked}} by most people. It’s easy to understand, though – when the leaves are beginning {{to emerge in the}} spring, we don’t see a similar flush of new roots; the belowground changes that accompany the bright colors of autumn are not visible.
