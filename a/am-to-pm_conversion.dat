40|$|We {{calculate}} the amplitude-to-phase (AM-to-PM) noise conversion in a modified unitraveling carrier (MUTC) photodetector. We obtained two nulls as {{measured in the}} experiments, and we explain their origin. The nulls appear due to the transit time variation when the average photocurrent varies, and the transit time variation {{is due to the}} change of electron velocity when the average photocurrent varies. We also show that the <b>AM-to-PM</b> <b>conversion</b> coefficient depends only on the pulse energy and is independent of the pulse duration when the duration is less than 500 fs. When the pulse duration is larger than 500 fs, the nulls of the <b>AM-to-PM</b> <b>conversion</b> coefficient shift to larger average photocurrents. This shift occurs because the increase in that pulse duration leads to a decrease in the peak photocurrent. The AM-to-PM noise conversion coefficient changes as the repetition rate varies. However, the repetition rate does not change the <b>AM-to-PM</b> <b>conversion</b> coefficient as a function of input optical pulse energy. The repetition rate changes the average photocurrent. We propose a design that would in theory improve the performance of the device. Comment: 10 page...|$|E
40|$|A simple {{unilateral}} nonlinear circuit {{model of}} a GaAs FET {{is used in the}} analysis of the third-order intermodulation distortion and gain compression characteristics of a single-stage amplifier. Expressions are obtained for these characteristics, relating them to the input power level and to the device load admittance. The expressions are illustrated with contours on the load admittance plane of constant intermodulation distortion ratio, intercept point, gain compression, <b>AM-to-PM</b> <b>conversion,</b> and output power, and as output power versus input power plots for fixed terminations. Agreement with experimentally measured distortion characteristics is good. Copyrigh...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{the main}} nonidealities {{appearing}} in polar transmitters will be addressed, together with several implementation considerarions. Special attention {{will be paid}} to the role of AM modulation nonlinearity and parasitic <b>AM-to-PM</b> <b>conversion,</b> once architecture mechanisms as time-delay mismatch between branches or limited bandwidth in the amplitude path are controlled. The device limiting factors for a highly efficient switched mode operation and a linear amplitude modulation will be identified. Some circuit design and implementation guidelines for the RF modulating stage and the envelope amplifier will be discussed, to finish with system level analysis considerations under two-tone and real communication signal excitations...|$|E
40|$|This brief {{deals with}} <b>AM-to-PM</b> noise <b>conversion</b> due to varactors and {{nonlinear}} capacitances. The effect increases {{the sensitivity of}} oscillators to substrate and power supply noise and sets a serious limitation to the phase noise performance of these stages when they are embedded in complete transceivers. A rigorous approach to the quantitative estimate of the conversion factor and a closed-form expression are derived. The conversion due to typical varactor structures available in integrated technology is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{timing jitter}} of optical pulse trains from diode-pumped, {{semiconductor}} saturable absorber mode-locked femtosecond Cr:LiSAF lasers {{is characterized by}} a single-crystal balanced optical cross-correlator with an equivalent sensitivity in phase noise of - 235 dBc/Hz. The RMS timing jitter is 30 attoseconds integrated from 10 kHz to 50 MHz, the Nyquist frequency of the 100 MHz repetition rate oscillator. The <b>AM-to-PM</b> <b>conversion</b> induced excess phase noise is calculated and compared with experiment. The self-steepening effect is proven to be the dominant AM-toPM coupling mechanism, whereas the semiconductor saturable absorber operation does not adversely affect timing jitter. The results show that ultrafast Cr: LiSAF lasers are promising compact and efficient ultralow-jitter sources...|$|E
40|$|A {{great deal}} of {{research}} is presently being conducted to study modulation schemes {{in order to reduce}} the bandwidth of digital communications. These M-ary amplitude and phase shift keying (MAPSK) modulation systems place new requirements on TWT amplifiers in space applications in that the various signal sets usually include two or more discrete output power levels as well as discrete phases at each power level. This paper presents a variety of predistortion schemes to circumvent the TWT problems of AM distortion and <b>AM-to-PM</b> <b>conversion</b> in order to produce MAPSK signal sets. A feedback scheme is presented to correct for long-term phase and amplitude drifts in the transmitter. A complete transmitter is proposed using predistortion to produce the desired MAPSK signal set at very high data rates including the possible use of a feedback stabilization scheme...|$|E
40|$|The {{automatic}} {{amplitude control}} (AAC) loop is an indispensable element for the practical realization of VCOs embedded in a complete transceiver. Its noise however can unacceptably degrade the single-sideband-to-carrier ratio (SSCR) performance of the oscillator, this problem being even exacerbated in low-voltage circuits. This paper addresses the design issues of a low-voltage low-noise differential LC-VCO with AAC, tunable within a 2. 3 - 2. 8 -GHz frequency range, fully integrated in bipolar technology with 2 -V power supply. First, the mechanisms through which the AAC noise affects the output phase are identified as the poor indirect stability and the <b>AM-to-PM</b> <b>conversion</b> due to the varactors. The effect of the AAC noise is discussed and substantially reduced with suitable design choices. We show that the achievable noise-to-signal ratio is bounded by the shot noise coming from the bias source of the differential oscillator, an intrinsic limit set by the low supply voltage which {{does not allow for}} degeneration of the tail transistor. Second, the design of the AAC is discussed. A large gain-bandwidth product (GBWP), about 100 MHz, has been implemented in order to correct for the fast oscillation amplitude variations and reduce the effect of the ground line disturbances. The expected value of the phase noise level, SSCR at 100 kHz =- 104 dBc/Hz, is tightly matched by the experimental results. The core oscillator dissipates 7 mA, while less than 600 μA are drawn by the AAC circuit...|$|E
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} hermetically packaged InGaAs/InP photodetector modules {{for high}} performance microwave photonic applications. The devices employ an advanced photodiode epitaxial layer {{known as the}} modified uni-traveling carrier photodiode (MUTC-PD) with superior performance in terms of output power and saturation. To further improve the thermal limitations, the MUTC-PDs were flip-chip bonded on high thermal conductivity substrates such as Aluminum Nitride (AlN) and Diamond. Modules using chips with active area diameters of 40, 28, and 20 μm were developed. The modules demonstrated a 3 -dB bandwidth ranging from 17 GHz up to 30 GHz. In continuous wave mode of operation, very high RF output power was achieved with 25 dBm at 10 GHz, 22 dBm at 20 GHz, and 17 dBm at 30 GHz. In addition, the linearity of the modules was characterized by using the third order intercept point (OIP 3) as a figure of merit. Very high values of OIP 3 were obtained with 30 dBm at 10 GHz, 25 dBm at 20 GHz and more than 20 dBm at 30 GHz. Under short pulse illumination conditions and by selectively filtering the 10 GHz frequency component only, a saturated power of > 21 dBm was also measured. A very low <b>AM-to-PM</b> <b>conversion</b> coefficient was measured, making the modules highly suitable for integration in photonic systems for ultralow phase noise RF signal generation.
