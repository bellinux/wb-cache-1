[...] ("This place is in too good a situation, and I <b>am</b> <b>too</b> conscious of the service of my country and my honour, {{to listen to your}} proposals"). In reality, the situation was dire: during February, prices of basic foodstuffs stood at 16 francs for a fowl, 12 francs for a rabbit, 20 sous for an egg, 18 sous for a lettuce, 40 sous for a rat and six francs per pound for fish. For the civilian typhus patients, the only food available was a horse-flesh soup.|$|E

500|$|Aboard Guillaume Tell, the British found {{evidence}} {{of the severity of}} the food shortages in Valletta: [...] "the only thing found in La Guillaume Tell was the leg of a mule, hung for safety and his especial use of the admiral's stern-galley". News of the capture of Guillaume Tell was immediately passed to Vaubois by the British besiegers, along with a demand that he surrender the island. The French general, despite dwindling food supplies, refused, stating [...] "Cette place est en trop bon état, et je suis moi-même trop jaloux de bien servir mon pays et de conserver mon honneur, pour écouter vos propositions." [...] ("This place is in too good a situation, and I <b>am</b> <b>too</b> conscious of the service of my country and my honour, to listen to your proposals"). Despite Vaubois' defiance, the garrison was rapidly starving, and although the French commander resisted until 4 September, he was eventually forced to surrender Valletta and all of its military equipment to the British.|$|E

500|$|Carey {{was unable}} to film an {{accompanying}} music video for the single; {{at the time of}} its release, she was recovering from a physical and emotional breakdown that left her hospitalized in August 2001, and caused her to cancel all public appearances to promote Glitter. She said, [...] "When I was asked about the video I said, 'I can't do it today'. And nobody could accept that answer. And that's when I started to get mad. I was, like, look, I <b>am</b> <b>too</b> fatigued. I'm overly-tired, I can't do it as a human being. And nobody was hearing those last two words — human being. They were used to the Mariah that always says, 'Come on, let's fight, let's go'. They just weren't used to me ever saying no. I never said no before". Instead, a video was created using a scene taken directly from the film, where Billie Frank (played by Carey) sings the song at Madison Square Garden during her first sold-out concert. Frank's performance of the song in the film omits its entire second verse, and the song's development runs in parallel with the film's love story.|$|E

[...] Cochin Haneefa, Charle, Kalabhavan Mani, Shanmugarajan and Saurabh Shukla make cameo appearances as delinquent citizens. Haneefa played an indifferent car owner who refuses to help an accident victim as he does not want his [...] "brand new car" [...] to be soiled with blood. Following Haneefa's death in February 2010, Vikram recalled the actor's appearance in the film and said, [...] "Though he'd come only in a few scenes no one could miss him.

500|$|After {{the release}} of Let the Right One In took place, Cloverfield {{director}} Matt Reeves signed on to write and direct an English-language version for Overture Films and Hammer Films. Hammer Films acquired the rights at the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival, where Let the Right One In won the [...] "Founders Award for Best Narrative Feature", and Overture films planned to release the film in 2010. Alfredson has expressed unhappiness {{about the idea of}} a remake, saying that [...] "Remakes should be made of movies that aren't very good, that gives you the chance to fix whatever has gone wrong" [...] and expressing concern that the end result would be too mainstream. Alfredson was initially asked to direct the remake, but he turned it down stating that [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>too</b> old to make the same film twice and I have other stories that I want to tell." [...] Lindqvist, in contrast, said that he had heard that Reeves [...] "will make a new film based on the book, and not remake the Swedish film" [...] and so [...] "it'll be something completely different, but it's going to be really interesting to see." [...] Hammer Films producer Simon Oakes referred to the project as a remake of the film and later not as a remake, but just as [...] "Reeves' version". Let Me In was released in late 2010 starring Chloë Grace Moretz and Kodi Smit-McPhee as Abby and Owen, Eli's and Oskar's respective counterparts, and received very positive reviews but under-performed at the box office.|$|E

[...] The decision to make a new film adaptation has been criticized by Tomas Alfredson. He has stated on numerous occasions that he is not in favor of remaking his film. [...] "If one should remake a film, it's because the original is bad. And I don't think mine is," [...] he said. Producer Donna Gigliotti said, [...] "We're incredibly admiring of the original, but to be honest with you, that picture grossed $2 million. It's not like we're remaking Lawrence of Arabia." [...] Producer Simon Oakes {{made it clear that the}} plot of Let Me In would closely resemble that of the original film, except that it will be made [...] "very accessible to a wider audience." ...|$|E

According to letters to Marie-Blanche Vasnier, perhaps in part designed to gain her sympathy, he found the artistic atmosphere stifling, the company boorish, the food bad, and the monastic quarters [...] "abominable". Neither did he delight in Italian opera, as he found the operas of Donizetti and Verdi not to his taste. Debussy was often depressed and unable to compose, but he was inspired by Franz Liszt, whose command of the keyboard he found admirable.
