5|$|As Nixon {{prepared}} for the August 1968 Republican National Convention in Miami Beach, he discussed possible running mates with his staff. Among these were Ronald Reagan, the conservative Governor of California, and the more liberal Mayor of New York City, John Lindsay. Nixon felt that these high-profile names could split the party, <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>for</b> a less divisive figure. He did not indicate a preferred choice, and Agnew's name was not raised at this stage. Agnew was intending {{to go to the}} convention with his Maryland delegation as a favorite son, uncommitted to any of the main candidates.|$|E
5|$|Some historians see Władysław as {{a dreamer}} {{who could not}} stick to one policy, and upon running into first difficulties, ditched it <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>for</b> another opportunity. Perhaps {{it was due to}} this lukewarmness that Władysław was never able to inspire those he ruled to support, at least in any {{significant}} manner, any of his plans. Władysław Czapliński in his biography of the king is more understanding, noting the short period of his reign (16 years) and the weakness of the royal position he was forced to deal with.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} the war stems from the {{increasing}} numbers of English colonists and their demand for land. As more land was purchased from the Native Americans, they were restricted to smaller territories for themselves. Native American leaders such as King Philip resented the loss of land <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>for</b> a means to slow or reverse it. Of specific concern was {{the founding of the}} town of Swansea, which was located only {{a few miles from the}} Wampanoag capital at Mount Hope. The General Court of Plymouth began using military force to coerce the sale of Wampanoag land to the settlers of the town.|$|E

5|$|The main {{hospital}} in Ashford is William Harvey Hospital, in nearby Willesborough. It {{is named after}} William Harvey, the doctor who discovered the blood circulatory system. The hospital was built because the government decided the old hospital would be too small for demand as Ashford grew, <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>for</b> a 30-acre site that could have a hospital built on a budget of £7–8million. Work started on building the {{hospital in}} 1973 and it was commissioned in 1977, opening in 1979.|$|E
5|$|In 1932–33 the English team, led by Douglas Jardine and jointly {{managed by}} Pelham Warner and Richard Palairet, toured Australia {{and won the}} Ashes in an acrimonious contest that {{became known as the}} Bodyline series. The English team used {{contentious}} bowling tactics where the English pace bowlers Harold Larwood, Bill Voce and Bill Bowes bowled the ball roughly on the line of leg stump. The deliveries were often short-pitched, designed to rise at the batsman's body, with four or five fielders close by on the leg side waiting to catch deflections off the bat. Intended to be intimidating, the tactics proved difficult for batsmen to counter and were physically threatening. The primary target of Bodyline was Donald Bradman, who had overwhelmed the English bowling in the 1930 Ashes series. Leading English cricketers and administrators feared that Bradman would be unstoppable on good Australian batting wickets in 1932–33, <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>for</b> possible weaknesses in his batting technique.|$|E
5|$|The first {{significant}} group of Scottish artists {{to emerge in}} the twentieth century were the Scottish Colourists in the 1920s. The name was retrosepctively given to John Duncan Fergusson (1874–1961), Francis Cadell (1883–1937), Samuel Peploe (1871–1935) and Leslie Hunter (1877–1931). They knew each other and exhibited together, but did not form a cohesive group. All had spent time in France between 1900 and 1914 <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>for</b> inspiration to Paris, particularly to the Fauvists, such as Monet, Matisse and Cézanne, whose techniques they combined with the painting traditions of Scotland. They have been described as the first Scottish modern artists and were the major mechanism by which post-impressionism reached Scotland. Fergusson in particular would later be a major influence on bringing modernism to Scottish art.|$|E

5|$|The {{summer after}} graduation, Baker toured Europe as a celebrity {{correspondent}} for The New York Times, where {{he wrote about}} events like the Henley Royal Regatta. Through his Princeton classmates, {{he was hired by}} Wall Street insurance firm Johnson & Higgins upon his return to the United States. Soon after, another Princeton graduate offered him a job at J.P. Morgan Bank. Hired onto a two-year trainee program, Baker earned about $20 per week. Baker befriended a rich New York socialite, Percy R. Pyne II, who had also attended St. Paul's and Princeton. Though ten years older than Baker, they quickly became friends and Pyne allowed Baker to stay at his house at 263 Madison Avenue. Pyne later introduced Baker to Jeanne Marie Scott, a socialite known as Mimi, to whom Baker was briefly engaged late in 1918. A quiet individual, Baker was embarrassed when bank executives brought important clients by his office to see him. He quickly tired of working in an office job, <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>for</b> ways to alleviate his boredom.|$|E
5|$|Easter Road staged {{its first}} Scottish League match when Hibs joined {{the league in}} 1893. Hibs were only renting Easter Road, which Edinburgh city {{planners}} had designated for future development. This meant the club were unwilling to develop the ground <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>for</b> alternatives. Hibs considered relocating to Aberdeen in 1902, a year before Aberdeen FC was formed by a merger of three local clubs. In 1909, work began on a potential new ground in the Piershill area of Ednburgh, but the North British Railway company won a court order allowing them to build a railway line over the ground. No line was ever built, but Hibs' interest in moving to the site was thwarted. The long-term future of Easter Road was only secured in 1922, when the club agreed a 25-year lease on the ground. Two years later, three banks of terraces were raised, while a main stand seating 4,480 people {{was built on the}} west side of the ground. The redeveloped stadium had a capacity of 45,000. The pitch was also moved 40 yards to the east, providing space for the main stand. The slope was reduced to approximately 6 feet as part of this work.|$|E
5|$|On {{his return}} from National Service in 1962 Dibnah {{retrieved}} his tools from storage, bought a 1927 350cc AJS motorcycle for 21guineas <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>for</b> more work. Bolton, however, {{was in the midst}} of post-industrial decline; between 1957 and 1965 about 70mills were closed in the town, leaving only 37mills operational and about 50disused. Initially he was unable to find much work and existed on smaller, domestic jobs, until he earned enough to buy his own set of ladders and secured his first commission while working at a local mill. He was paid £140 to point a mill tower, which he did at weekends. He struggled, however, to get any more meaningful work, until he met Lonsdale Bonner, one of his teachers from art college. The two agreed a deal whereby Bonner would be paid a commission for each job he got for Dibnah. His first job was dismantling a chimney alongside the Manchester and Bolton Railway, a difficult proposition, as a mistake could force the temporary closure of the railway. The two managed to gain commissions for several jobs, but their relationship was terminated when Dibnah was called upon to undertake another six months of National Service.|$|E

5|$|The Warner {{brothers}} pooled {{their resources}} {{and moved into}} film production in 1910. Then, in 1912, they lent their support to filmmaker Carl Laemmle's Independent Motion Picture Company, which challenged the monopolistic control of the Edison Trust. That same year, Jack Warner acquired {{a job as a}} film splicer in New York, where he assisted brother Sam with the production of the film Dante's Inferno. Despite the film's success at the box office, Harry Warner remained concerned about the economic threat presented by the Edison Trust. He subsequently broke with Laemmle and sent Jack to establish a film exchange in San Francisco, while Sam did the same in Los Angeles. The brothers were soon poised to exploit the expanding California movie market. In 1917, Jack was sent to Los Angeles to open another film exchange company. Their first opportunity to produce a major film came in 1918, when they purchased the film rights for My Four Years in Germany, a bestselling novel that condemned German wartime atrocities. The film proved to be a commercial and critical success, and the four brothers were able to establish a studio in California. In the new studio, Jack became co-head of production along with his older brother, Sam. In this capacity, the two brothers secured new scripts and story lines, managed film production, <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>for</b> ways to reduce production costs.|$|E

25|$|After his speech, he {{was asked}} by the Communist Party in Russia to explore this idea more {{in the form of a}} book. He wrote Negry v Amerike in 1923. He wrote this in Russian, and it was not {{translated}} into English until 1979. Later in life, he came to the conclusion that the Communist party suppressed the idea of individuality and independent thought. Before coming back to America, he denounced the Communist thoughts{citation needed|Date = October 2017}} <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>for</b> other areas to meet his needs.|$|E

Torbay, the large bay of which Torquay {{is located on the}} northern side of, alongside the other towns of Paignton and Brixham, was ideal as a large sheltered anchorage for ships and was frequently used by the Channel Fleet which protected England against invasion by Napoleon and due to this wives and relatives of officers often visited Torquay to be near their loved ones in the fleet. During this period the Royal Navy ship HMS Venerable was wrecked while sheltering in the bay on 24 November 1804.|$|E
25|$|Early in the evening, {{more than}} six hours after the explosion, Kursk failed to {{complete}} a scheduled communication check at 18:00. The Northern Fleet command became concerned and tried to contact Kursk. After repeated failures, at 18:30 they began a search and rescue operation, dispatching aircraft to locate the submarine, which again failed to locate the ship on the surface. At 17:00, an Ilyushin 38 aircraft was dispatched <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>for</b> Kursk for three hours without spotting anything. At 22:30, the Northern Fleet declared an emergency, and the exercise was stopped. Between fifteen and twenty-two vessels of the Northern Fleet, including about 3,000 sailors, began searching for the submarine. Captain Teslenko commanding Mikhail Rudnitsky left port at 00:30.|$|E
25|$|By late 1754, {{the siege}} of Prome was going nowhere for Talaban's men. The besiegers {{had been able to}} fight off Konbaung {{attempts}} to lift the siege but they could not take the fortified city either. At Pegu, some of the Hanthawaddy commanders now feared Alaungpaya's full-scale invasion of the south, <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>for</b> an alternative. Preferring the loose rule of a weak king, they attempted to free the captive king, Mahadhammaraza Dipati on the throne of Hanthawaddy. The plot was discovered by Binnya Dala, who executed not only the conspirators but also the former king himself and other captives from Ava in October 1754. This shortsighted action removed the only possible rival to Alaungpaya, and allowed those who had stayed loyal to the former king to join Alaungpaya with an easy conscience.|$|E
