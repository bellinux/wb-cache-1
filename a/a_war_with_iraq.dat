50|$|The {{agreement}} {{was important to}} Iraq in order to end the Kurdish War and to end the violence near Shatt al-Arab with Iran. It was also in Iran's interest because the Iraqi Army had taken control of many Kurdish areas, in summer 1974, and the Kurdish rebels had failed to get them back.

2500|$|Arab Muslims {{conquered the}} empire {{in the seventh}} century AD, {{ultimately}} leading to the displacement of the indigenous faiths of Zoroastrianism and Manichaeism with Islam. Iran made major contributions to the Islamic Golden Age that followed, producing many influential figures in art and science. After two centuries, a period of various native Muslim dynasties began, which were later conquered by the Turks and the Mongols. The rise of the Safavids in the 15th century led to the reestablishment of a unified Iranian state and national identity, which followed the country's conversion to Shia Islam, marking a turning point in Iranian and Muslim history. By the 18th century, under Nader Shah, Iran briefly possessed what was arguably the most powerful empire at the time. The 19th-century conflicts with the Russian Empire led to significant territorial losses. Popular unrest culminated in the Constitutional Revolution of 1906, which established a constitutional monarchy and the country's first legislature. Following a coup instigated by the United Kingdom and the United States in 1953, Iran gradually became closely aligned with the West, and grew increasingly autocratic. Growing dissent against foreign influence and political repression led to the 1979 Revolution, which followed the establishment of an Islamic republic, a political system which includes elements of a parliamentary democracy vetted and supervised by a theocracy governed by an autocratic [...] "Supreme Leader". During the 1980s, the country was engaged in <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>with</b> <b>Iraq,</b> which lasted for almost nine years and resulted in a high number of casualties and financial loss for both sides.|$|E

A central theme of this book was that the mal-distribution of wealth, which Batra found to be the cause of past episodes of financial speculative manias that were followed by a crash and depression. Lester Thurow was so impressed that he wrote a preface stating the ideas were [...] "novel and brilliant". This book was subsequently renamed as The Great Depression of 1990. It entered the New York Times Best Seller list in the Non-fiction category in early 1987 and reached #1 later that year.|$|R
5000|$|Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda link {{allegations}} {{were made by}} the U.S. government officials who claimed that a highly secretive relationship existed between former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and the radical Islamist militant organization Al-Qaeda from 1992 to 2003, specifically through a series of meetings reportedly involving the Iraqi Intelligence Service (IIS). In the lead up to the Iraq War, U.S. President George W. Bush alleged that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and militant group al-Qaeda might conspire to launch terrorist attacks on the United States, basing the administration's rationale for war, in part, on this allegation [...] The consensus of intelligence experts has been that these contacts never led to an operational relationship, and that consensus is backed up by reports from the independent 9/11 Commission and by declassified Defense Department reports {{as well as by the}} Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, whose 2006 report of Phase II of its investigation into prewar intelligence reports concluded that there was no evidence of ties between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda. [...] Critics of the Bush Administration have said Bush was intentionally building <b>a</b> case for <b>war</b> <b>with</b> <b>Iraq</b> without regard to factual evidence.

50|$|On February 5, 2003, Powell {{appeared}} before the UN to prove the urgency to engage <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>with</b> <b>Iraq.</b> Although the presentation failed to change the fundamental position of the Security Council, including France, Russia, China, and Germany, Powell succeeded in hardening the overall tone of the United Nations towards Iraq. Powell also noted that Iraq harbored a terrorist network headed by al-Qaeda operative Abu Musab al-Zarqawi (in a small region controlled by Ansar al-Islam). Powell also claimed that Iraqis visited Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan and provided training to al-Qaeda members, although thousands of Arabs from many countries did the same.

5000|$|... “Anti-Americanism - Why Do So Many Dislike the U.S.?” was {{the final}} {{installment}} in Winfrey’s anti-war series.

The show asked if America wins <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>with</b> <b>Iraq,</b> could they lose something bigger. [...] The show was strongly condemned by propopents of the war like Townhall.com’s Ben Shapiro who criticized Winfrey for only including anti-Bush guests such as anti-war Fawaz Gerges and Thomas Friedman. He also criticized Winfrey for showing bias during the show:However Steve Perry of Minneapolis/St. Paul City Pages praised the show writing:Also praising the show for its “amazing perspective” was Globe and Mail television critic John Doyle who noted that [...] "at a time when the consensus in American television is that everybody should pull together and support the men and women in the U.S. military, what Oprah Winfrey did was outright subversion." [...] Gerges told Winfrey’s audience that although war was very imminent, he felt a responsibility to express his dissent right up to the last minute. A few months after the show aired, anti-war activist Michael Moore publicly begged Winfrey to run for president.|$|E

5000|$|Criticism {{also came}} from the governments of many countries, notably from many on the United Nations Security Council, who argued that the war broke {{international}} law. (Article VI of the U.S. Constitution states that [...] "...all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land..." [...] and that [...] "...all executive and judicial Officers, both of the United States and of the several States, shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution...", while Article III states that the judicial power of the US Supreme Court extends to [...] "all ... Treaties made". This makes a violation of international law also {{a violation of the}} [...] "supreme Law of The Land" [...] of America, and withholds immunity from government officials, including the president.) See Worldwide government positions on war on Iraq and The UN Security Council and the Iraq war. For its part, the U.S. administration soon presented a list of countries called the coalition of the willing which supported its position. A later aspect of the criticism has been the death toll in Iraq; over 100,000 Iraqi civilians and 4000 U.S. soldiers have been killed {{since the beginning of the}} war mainly during the ensuing insurgency and civil war. In 2004, public assertions by Bush's former Secretary of the Treasury Paul O'Neill and counter-terrorism expert Richard Clarke raised questions about the credibility of the Bush administration's pre-war claims. Both presented evidence that questioned how focused the Bush administration was on combating Al-Qaeda (which was operating out of Afghanistan, not Iraq) before September 11. Specifically, O'Neill presented classified and unclassified documents indicating that planning for <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>with</b> <b>Iraq</b> and the subsequent occupation began at the first National Security Council meeting and continued with each meeting. Clarke presented testimony and witnesses concerning how Bush and much of his cabinet tried to find excuses to attack Iraq immediately after September 11, such as associating it with September 11, claiming that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, and claiming that Iraq posed an imminent threat, which implied that a war against Iraq would be legal by Article 51 of the U.N. Charter.|$|E

40|$|The UK {{economy is}} weaker {{at this time}} than {{expected}} in early summer. As growth {{in the global economy}} continues to be weak forecasters have tended to revise down slightly their forecasts for both this year and next. Against this background the inflation picture has improved and the prospect of a rise in interest rates has receded. But the labour market has weakened slightly over the last few months. The net trade position is improving as exports pick up and the growth of domestic consumer demand appears to be moderating slightly. The prospects of a shift to export- led growth as the world economy recovers therefore seem brighter than earlier in the year. Nevertheless, there are considerable uncertainties in the world economy for both real economic as well as political reasons, such as the growing threat of <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>with</b> <b>Iraq...</b>|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT During {{the last}} quarter of a century, Iran has {{undergone}} funda-mental changes. The revolution was supported by a heterogeneous coalition of social forces, but it led to <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>with</b> <b>Iraq</b> and the stabilization of an Islamic regime. Since the end of the 1980 s, four different types of new social actors have emerged in Iran: post-Islamist intellectuals; feminists; students as a non-revolutionary, reformist and democratically minded group; and ethnic move-ments. These actors mostly (with the exception of some intellectuals) belong to a generation which did not take part in the revolution; their aspirations and demands are totally different from those most characteristic of the revolution-ary phase. The election of President Khatami in 1997 was a result of these changes. Since then, a stalemate has prevailed: the society is post-Islamist, whereas the decisive power centres are controlled by Islamist conservatives.
