5|$|In October 1996 GPC {{began to}} drill and reopen Chevron's wells {{and to build}} an <b>all-weather</b> <b>road</b> {{connecting}} Adar Yale to the garrison town of Melut.|$|E
5|$|One {{estimate}} is that 12,000 people were forced to move in 1999-2000 while the <b>all-weather</b> <b>road</b> was being built between Melut, Paloic and Adar.|$|E
5|$|The Yellowhead {{began as}} the Yellowhead Red River cart trail. When the {{province}} was surveyed, the road {{evolved from a}} dirt to gravel to <b>all-weather</b> <b>road</b> known as Provincial Highway 5 from the Alberta–Saskatchewan boundary to Saskatoon, and as Provincial Highway 14 from Saskatoon to the Manitoba–Saskatchewan boundary. In the late 1950s and 1960s, the highway was straightened and widened. On August 15, 1970 the Yellowhead was opened for the northern Trans-Canada route. The highway was completely designated for the entire route as Saskatchewan Highway 16 in 1976.|$|E
50|$|In 2000, around 40% {{of villages}} in India lacked access to <b>all-weather</b> <b>roads</b> and {{remained}} isolated during the monsoon season. To improve rural connectivity, Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (Prime Minister's Rural Road Program), a project {{funded by the}} Central Government {{with the help of}} World Bank, was launched in 2000 to build <b>all-weather</b> <b>roads</b> to connect all habitations with a population of 500 or above (250 or above for hilly areas).|$|R
50|$|With the {{construction}} of major <b>all-weather</b> <b>roads</b> {{on both sides of}} the Gambia River, the waterway has become less significant for passenger traffic.|$|R
25|$|Examination of Landsat {{images in}} 2006 {{showed that the}} <b>all-weather</b> <b>roads</b> built to access the oil fields have {{disrupted}} the drainage patterns of the marshes.|$|R
5|$|By the 1940s the lessee at Muckaty was Fred Ulyatt. The 1940s also {{marked a}} {{significant}} change in the region's road infrastructure. A dirt track had been formed to service the telegraph line in the late nineteenth century. This became the Stuart Highway, crossing the eastern part of Muckaty, and it was upgraded to an <b>all-weather</b> <b>road</b> in late 1940, before being bitumenised in 1944. Sources do not say who leased the property between the 1940s and 1982, at which point the lease was held by James and Miriam Hagan. In 1988 it was transferred to Hapford Pty Limited and Kerfield Pty Limited. Between 1985 and 1987 a natural gas pipeline was built across the station, carrying gas from Palm Valley in the Amadeus Basin to Channel Island near Darwin.|$|E
5|$|During February 1966, {{as part of}} an American road-building program {{designed}} to challenge the Viet Cong's ability to manoeuvre in the areas around Saigon, the US 1st Engineer Battalion—under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Howard Sargent—had been engaged in constructing an <b>all-weather</b> <b>road</b> between Route 13 and Route 15 in central Binh Duong Province, west of Ben Cat, on the northern apex of the Viet Cong base area known as the Iron Triangle. This road was planned to cut the communist supply routes between War Zone C, the Mekong Delta, the Iron Triangle and War Zone D, while it would also link the two forward brigades of the US 1st Infantry Division between Phuoc Vinh and Lai Khe and help to extend the authority of the South Vietnamese government.|$|E
5|$|US113 {{follows the}} {{corridor}} of a post road {{established in the}} late 18thcentury to connect the aforementioned towns on the Delmarva Peninsula with Wilmington and Philadelphia. The highway was improved as an <b>all-weather</b> <b>road</b> in the 1910s. In Maryland, the post road was designated {{one of the original}} state roads established by the Maryland State Roads Commission (MDSRC) in 1909. In Delaware, the highway was the Selbyville–Dover portion of the DuPont Highway, a roadway whose construction was a grand philanthropic measure of Thomas Coleman DuPont. The DuPont Highway, which was started by DuPont's company and finished by the Delaware State Highway Department (DSHD), spurred economic growth in the tourism and agriculture sectors in southern Delaware. The economic growth resulted in heavy traffic; US113 was widened in both states in the early 1930s and again in the late 1940s. Bypasses of Dover and Pocomoke City were built in the mid-1930s; the bypassed section of highway in Dover became US113Alternate.|$|E

25|$|Relations {{between the}} PRC and India {{deteriorated}} {{during the rest}} of the 1960s and the early 1970s as China–Pakistan relations improved and Sino-Soviet relations worsened. The PRC backed Pakistan in its 1965 war with India. Between 1967 and 1971, an <b>all-weather</b> <b>road</b> was built across territory claimed by India, linking PRC's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region with Pakistan; India could do no more than protest.|$|E
25|$|PR374 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with PR373 {{and a local}} road which connects to Whiskey Jack Landing {{on the shores of}} Kiskittogisu Lake. A two-lane gravel road, PR374 runs northeast from PR373 and makes a wide bend past a dirt road to nearby Cross Lake. The route winds northeast for several kilometers, turning into an asphalt <b>all-weather</b> <b>road.</b> PR374 then reaches the Kichi Sipi Bridge (Great River in Cree), crossing over the Nelson River near Pipestone Lake.|$|E
25|$|Inuvik {{achieved}} village {{status in}} 1967 {{and became a}} full town in 1979 with an elected mayor and council. In 1979, with {{the completion of the}} Dempster Highway, Inuvik became connected to Canada's highway system, and simultaneously the most northerly town to which one could drive in the summer months — although an ice road through the Mackenzie River delta connects the town to Tuktoyaktuk, on the coast of the Arctic Ocean, and Aklavik, in the winter, and an <b>all-weather</b> <b>road</b> connecting Inuvik and Tuktoyaktuk is currently under construction.|$|E

25|$|When {{the guerrilla}} sweep was {{successfully}} {{completed by the}} end of May, the communists reclaimed the lost ground. However, Muang Soui was saved from assault; the USAF claimed the credit. With monsoon rains drenching the Plain, communist resupply lines were expected to be bogged down. In past rainy seasons, air operations supporting the Hmong against the communists had occurred during breaks in the weather. However, in mid June 1969, the communists launched their first ever wet season offensive, Campaign Thoan Thang. It circled behind the Hmong positions and used a tank-supported attack to conquer Moang Soui on 27 June. The Hmong were left facing an enemy that now was being supplied by an <b>all-weather</b> <b>road,</b> Route 7; the communists were still poised to strike.|$|E
25|$|In 1775, Daniel Boone blazed a {{trail for}} the Transylvania Company from Fort Chiswell in Virginia through the Cumberland Gap. It was later lengthened, {{following}} Native American trails, {{to reach the}} Falls of the Ohio at Louisville. The Wilderness Road was steep, rough and narrow, and could only be traversed on foot or horseback. By contrast, wagons could travel along the National Road route (originally the Braddock Road blazed by the competing Ohio Company and George Washington circa 1750), particularly after the improvements. Despite the adverse conditions, thousands of people used the Wilderness Road, particularly slaveholders after the states of Ohio, then Indiana and finally Illinois became free states (abolishing slavery) on the northern bank of the Ohio River, where travelers often embarked on boats to travel westward. In 1792, the new Kentucky legislature provided money to upgrade the road. In 1796, an improved <b>all-weather</b> <b>road</b> was opened for wagon and carriage travel. The road was abandoned around 1840 (construction on the National Road after Vandalia, Illinois also stopping due to the Panic of 1837 and early railroad construction), although modern highways follow much of its route.|$|E
25|$|This road {{had started}} out in the Middle Ages as a lane running out from Berlin to the hamlet of Schöneberg, but it had {{developed}} into part of a trading route running right across Europe from Paris to St. Petersburg via Aachen, Berlin and Königsberg. In 1660 the Elector Frederick William made it his route of choice to Potsdam, the location of his palace, which had recently been renovated. Starting in 1754 a daily stagecoach ran between Berlin and Potsdam, although the road was in poor shape. But in 1740 Frederick II had become King. Not a great lover of Berlin, he later built a new palace, the Sanssouci, at Potsdam in 1744-7, followed by the New Palace in 1763-9, so the road now {{had to be made}} fit for a King, plus all his courtiers and staff. After numerous other improvements, in 1791-3 this section was made into Prussia's first <b>all-weather</b> <b>road.</b> It later became Potsdamer Straße; its point of entry into Berlin, where it passed through the customs wall, became the Potsdamer Tor (Potsdam Gate); once inside the gate Leipziger Straße was its eastwards continuation, and Wilhelmstraße was the first north-south thoroughfare that intersected with it. It was around this gate that Potsdamer Platz was to develop.|$|E

25|$|When the Chinese communists {{took over}} Tibet in 1951, Bhutan closed its {{frontier}} with Tibet and sided with its powerful {{neighbor to the}} south. To offset the chance of Chinese encroachment, Bhutan began a modernization program. Land reform was accompanied by {{the abolition of slavery}} and serfdom and the separation of the judiciary from the executive branch of government. Mostly funded by India after China's invasion of Tibet in 1959, the modernization program also included the construction of roads linking the Indian plains with central Bhutan. An <b>all-weather</b> <b>road</b> was completed in 1962 between Thimphu and Phuntsholing, the overland gateway town on the southwest border with India. Dzongkha was made the national language during Jigme Dorji's reign. Additionally, development projects included establishing such institutions as a national museum in Paro and a national library, national archives, and national stadium, as well as buildings to house the National Assembly, the High Court (Thrimkhang Gongma), and other government entities in Thimphu. The position of gongzim, held since 1907 by the Dorji family, was upgraded in 1958 to lonchen (prime minister) and was still {{in the hands of the}} Dorji. Jigme Dorji Wangchuck's reforms, however, although lessening the authority of the absolute monarchy, also curbed the traditional decentralizatio of political authority among regional leaders and strengthened the role of the central government in economic and social programs.|$|E
500|$|The Arroyo Seco (Spanish: [...] "dry gulch, or streambed") is an {{intermittent}} stream that carries rainfall from the San Gabriel Mountains southerly through western Pasadena into the Los Angeles River near downtown Los Angeles.

500|$|When the {{campaign}} began, the Kokoda Track started at McDonald's Corner, just beyond Ilolo. From there, the track slowly rose about [...] to what later {{became known as}} Owers' Corner. The road from Port Moresby was sealed as far as Seven Mile, and from there a gravel surface was laid to provide an <b>all-weather</b> <b>road</b> as far as Sogeri, roughly [...] from Port Moresby. On 24 June, GHQ queried {{whether it would be}} possible to upgrade the track to one that could handle animal transport or, better still, motor vehicles. There were multiple tracks leading to Kokoda, and in addition to the main track, there was interest at New Guinea Force HQ in a route along the Brown River that had been partially surveyed in 1912.|$|E
500|$|Fur {{traders and}} early {{settlers}} utilised {{the rivers and}} Red River cart roads such as Long Trail until the early 20th century when the railroad and bush planes supplemented travel to this northern boreal transition area. [...] Corduroy roads provided a means for early land vehicles to cross over muskeg and swamp. [...] Horse drawn ploughs filled low areas, settlers hauled gravel and cleared bush for the road ways surveyed along high elevations following lake and river shore lines. [...] Municipalities would grade and gravel roads providing transportation between trading centres. [...] The <b>all-weather</b> <b>road</b> arrived alongside of the NWWR association's impetus for a travel and tourism corridor along the northern area of the western provinces. [...] Traffic volume along the route {{is a major factor}} to determine highway classification, surface type, and construction upgrades.|$|E
500|$|Two airfields were constructed, Inshore and North Cape. These {{were heavy}} bomber strips, [...] long and [...] wide. The former had parking for 210 fighters or light bombers; the latter for 84 heavy bombers. Both were fully {{equipped}} with towers, lighting, and a dispensary. The aviation tank farm {{consisted of three}} [...] storage tanks and nineteen [...] storage tanks, together with the appropriate filling and distribution points. A reserve of [...] was stored in drums. Three hospitals were established, a 100-bed naval base hospital, the 160-bed 24th Army Field Hospital, and the 150-bed Acorn 7 Hospital. The anchorage at Hamburg Bay could accommodate up to five capital ships. Port facilities included eight cranes, [...] of refrigerated space, and [...] of covered storage.
