40|$|BACKGROUND: There are {{a number}} of {{practical}} and ethical issues raised in school-based health research, particularly those related to obtaining consent from parents and assent from children. One approach to developing, strengthening, and supporting appropriate consent and assent processes is through community engagement. To date, much of the literature on community engagement in biomedical research has concentrated on community- or hospital-based research, with little documentation, if any, of community engagement in school-based health research. In this paper we discuss our experiences of consent, assent and community engagement in implementing a large school-based cluster randomized trial in rural Kenya. METHODS: Data collected as part of a qualitative study investigating the acceptability of the main trial, focus group discussions with field staff, observations of practice and authors' experiences are used to: 1) highlight the challenges faced in obtaining assent/consent; and 2) strategies taken to try to both protect participant rights (including to refuse and to withdraw) and ensure the success of the trial. RESULTS: Early meetings with national, district and local level stakeholders were important in establishing their co-operation and support for the project. Despite this support, both practical and ethical challenges were encountered during consenting and <b>assenting</b> <b>procedures.</b> Our strategy for addressing these challenges focused on improving communication and understanding of the trial, and maintaining dialogue with all the relevant stakeholders throughout the study period. CONCLUSIONS: A range of stakeholders within and beyond schools {{play a key role in}} school based health trials. Community entry and information dissemination strategies need careful planning from the outset, and with on-going consultation and feedback mechanisms established in order to identify and address concerns as they arise. We believe our experiences, and the ethical and practical issues and dilemmas encountered, will be of interest for others planning to conduct school-based research in Africa.

40|$|Pediatric biobanking is {{considered}} important for generating biomedical knowledge and improving (pediatric) health care. However, {{the inclusion of}} children’s samples in biobanks involves specific ethical issues. One of the main concerns is how to appropriately engage children in the consent procedure. We suggest that children should be involved through a personalized <b>assent</b> <b>procedure,</b> which means that both the content {{and the process of}} assent are adjusted to the individual child. In this paper we provide guidance on how to put personalized assent into pediatric biobanking practice and consider both the content and process of personalized assent. In the discussion we argue that the <b>assent</b> <b>procedure</b> itself is formative. Investing in the procedure should be a requirement for pediatric biobank research. Although personalized assent will require certain efforts, the pediatric (biobank) community must be aware of its importance. The investment and trust earned can result in ongoing engagement, important longitudinal information, and stability in/for the research infrastructure, as well as increased knowledge among its participants about research activity. Implementing personalized assent will both respect the child and support biobank research...|$|E
40|$|The European Parliament is {{frequently}} {{seen as the}} ‘big winner’ of the Lisbon Treaty, {{given the fact that}} several changes have significantly extended its powers, such as the extension of co-decision as the ordinary legislative procedure, and the introduction of the <b>assent</b> <b>procedure</b> to international agreements. The reform of comitology (Article 291) and the introduction of the new instrument of delegated acts (Article 290) are generally seen in the same light, marking the culmination of a long-standing quest of the EP to gain equal rights to the Council in this area. This article questions the view that the Parliament has had unconditional ‘success’ by examining in detail the way the new provisions have been implemented. It argues that Member States in the Council managed to claw back influence on delegated powers through the manner that the new treaty articles have been put into practice. We identify the EP’s timing and selective attention with regard to this domain as the main explanations for this outcome. Our analysis demonstrates the need to study the actual implementation of treaty provisions before coming to a conclusion about the identity of ‘winners’ and ‘losers’ of treaty reform...|$|E
40|$|Whereas {{research}} on biological samples already exists for many years, developments in information and research technologies have triggered {{an increase of}} biobanking activities both in size and number. Also, {{research on}} children’s biological material may yield valuable information and can be important {{for the development of}} (pediatric) health care. Children, however, are usually considered incompetent to make an autonomous decision on research participation, which gives rise to specific ethical issues in pediatric biobanking. In view of the rapid developments in pediatric biobanking, it is important to address the question of how consent should take shape in this field. The ethical analysis on consent in pediatric biobanking in this thesis is enriched with a case study on the interpretation and use of consent in current pediatric biobanking practice. Three main questions are addressed in this thesis. First, it is questioned what the appropriate consent procedure for the inclusion of residual samples in biobanks is. It is concluded that in general an opt-out procedure is sufficient for the inclusion of residual tissue, when the following conditions are fulfilled: (1) awareness is raised among people about inclusion of residual tissue as the default position, (2) adequate information is provided, and (3) a genuine possibility to object is presented and objections are adequately registered. This can be referred to as a thick opt-out. In certain situations, however, an opt-in method is required. All stages of biobank research, inclusion, storage, and usage of biological material, should be considered when selecting an opt-in or opt-out procedure. Second, it is scrutinized what the appropriate role for children in the consent procedure is at the time of sample inclusion. It is concluded that assent should be understood from an engagement point of view, which means that both the content and the process of assent need to be adjusted to the individual child. This is referred to as personalized assent. An investment from the biobank in the <b>assent</b> <b>procedure</b> is a requirement for including children’s samples. By contrast, since not all children can or want to give assent, it would be strange to impose an affirmative agreement of the child as a strict requirement on researchers. Investing in a personalized <b>assent</b> <b>procedure</b> both shows respect for the child and may contribute to the quality and success of the research. Third, it is addressed whether children should be re-contacted at maturity to obtain their consent for (or to give them the opportunity to withdraw from) the continued use of their samples and data. Four policies are discussed, ranging from an opt-out policy (participants can withdraw their samples, but the biobank does not re-contact the participant) to a strict opt-in (samples will be destroyed when participants do not give their consent). It is concluded that a thick opt-out policy should be the default, meaning that participants are re-contacted by the biobank and given the opportunity to withdraw. By balancing the interests of participants, biobanks and society, this thesis aims to contribute to morally sound pediatric biobank research...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} extent to which {{arrangements}} concluded between European institutions contribute to the separation of powers underlying the European Union’s political system. The point of departure is an analysis of different separation of powers models. The author posits that the European Union’s political system is best interpreted against the background of a ‘separation of institutions’, implying that no European institution should exercise its legal powers in an unchecked manner. This approach builds on the Court of Justice’ institutional balance doctrine. It differs from the more traditional constitutional law theory known as ‘trias politica’ according to which no government authority ought to combine two ‘governmental functions’. Seen from this perspective, separation of powers is a matter of autonomous institutions subject to ‘checks and balances’. Some checks and balances find their basis in EU law. However, many others are based on arrangements between the European institutions. Many of such arrangements are not based on law. An enquiry into the possible general legal bases for such interinstitutional agreements finds all of them unsound. Driessen argues that interinstitutional arrangements without a legal basis (‘interinstitutional conventions’) cannot be legally enforceable. Although there are differences, to a certain extent they can be equated to the ‘constitutional conventions’ known in British constitutional law. An analysis of such interinstitutional conventions suggests their omnipresence in European constitutional practice. The study analyses the effects of interinstitutional arrangements on different fields of EU law. This includes, inter alia, an analysis of the political responsibility of the Commission and of its members towards the European Parliament, of the interinstitutional conventions that govern the Parliament’s rights of oversight, and those governing legislative procedures, the budgetary procedure and external relations. The analysis shows that many interinstitutional conventions are important instruments for the daily management of the Union. Other interinstitutional conventions concern the details of the relations between the institutions. They can tangibly affect the balance of influence between the European institutions. For example, in the budgetary field, the European Parliament successfully used interinstitutional agreements to ensure that about one half of expenditure is subject to its approval as non-compulsory expenditure. Additionally, it acquired some control over the remainder through the financial perspectives, which are equally based on interinstitutional conventions. Driessen researches the limitations on the use of such interinstitutional arrangements. Although they certainly cannot replace the procedures foreseen in European law, they can affect such them. Jurists often fail to notice {{the extent to}} which this happens. The study is based on current law but also takes on board the changes proposed in the Constitutional Treaty.
