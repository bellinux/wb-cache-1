5|$|Takamatsu is {{an honor}} student who has <b>a</b> <b>polite</b> {{personality}} and wears glasses. He mainly contributes to the SSS through intelligence gathering and other affairs but does not actively fight. Yuri herself says to not be fooled by his glasses {{and that he is}} actually an idiot. Though appearing to be slender, he works out and is actually well-built muscle-wise. After he first reveals this, he tends to take his shirt off, much to everyone's discomfort. He is absorbed by a shadow and is turned into an NPC. However, having strong enough feelings (according to Yuri), he is able to regain his senses and manages to disappear like the others. He carries a Desert Eagle as a side-arm, but is also seen using a Sig 552.|$|E
5|$|For {{his next}} movie, Kurosawa chose a subject very {{different}} from any that he had ever filmed before. While some of his previous pictures (for example, Drunken Angel and Kagemusha) had included brief dream sequences, Dreams was to be entirely based upon the director's own dreams. Significantly, {{for the first time}} in over forty years, Kurosawa, for this deeply personal project, wrote the screenplay alone. Although its estimated budget was lower than the films immediately preceding it, Japanese studios were still unwilling to back one of his productions, so Kurosawa turned to another famous American fan, Steven Spielberg, who convinced Warner Bros. to buy the international rights to the completed film. This made it easier for Kurosawa's son, Hisao, as co-producer and soon-to-be head of Kurosawa Production, to negotiate a loan in Japan that would cover the film's production costs. Shooting took more than eight months to complete, and Dreams premiered at Cannes in May 1990 to <b>a</b> <b>polite</b> but muted reception, similar to the reaction the picture would generate elsewhere in the world. In 1990, he accepted the Academy Award for Lifetime Achievement.|$|E

25|$|Rama {{had three}} brothers, {{according}} to the Balakhanda section of the Ramayana. These were Lakshmana, Bharata and Shatrughna. The extant manuscripts of the text describes their education and training as young princes, but this is brief. Rama is portrayed as <b>a</b> <b>polite,</b> self-controlled, virtuous youth always ready to help others. His education included the Vedas, the Vedangas {{as well as the}} martial arts.|$|E

Iqbal's mother Imam Bibi, a local Punjabi Muslim, {{was described as}} <b>a</b> <b>polite</b> and humble woman who helped the poor and her neighbours with their problems. She died on 9 November 1914 in Sialkot. Iqbal loved his mother, and on her death he expressed his feelings of pathos in a poetic form elegy.|$|E
25|$|On 5 June 1857, Nana Sahib sent <b>a</b> <b>polite</b> note to General Wheeler, informing {{him that}} he {{intended}} to attack on the following morning, at 10 AM. On 6 June Nana Sahib's forces (including the rebel soldiers) attacked the British entrenchment at 10:30 AM. The British were not adequately prepared for the attack, but managed to defend themselves for a long time, as the attacking forces were reluctant to enter the entrenchment. Nana Sahib's forces had been led to falsely believe that the entrenchment had gunpowder-filled trenches that would explode if they got closer.|$|E

25|$|In {{the autumn}} of 246, when the Shu {{government}} proclaimed a general amnesty, Meng Guang stepped up and scolded Fei Yi, {{the head of the}} central government, in front of the entire imperial court. He argued that a general amnesty, as a policy, should only be implemented under extraordinary circumstances (e.g., as a political move to gain popular support especially in times of instability) and as a last resort. In his opinion, as Shu was rather peaceful and stable at the time, a general amnesty would benefit criminals instead of improving the government's public image. Fei Yi apologised to Meng Guang in <b>a</b> <b>polite</b> but awkward manner.|$|E
25|$|Frequency {{of touch}} also varies {{significantly}} between different cultures. Harper refers to several studies, {{one of which}} examined touching in coffee houses. During a one-hour sitting 180 touchings were observed for Puerto Ricans, 110 for French, none for English and 2 for Americans. (Harper, 297). In order to know if someone was touching more frequently than normal {{it would be necessary}} to first know what is normal in that culture. In high touch countries a kiss on the cheek is considered <b>a</b> <b>polite</b> greeting while in Sweden it may be considered presumptuous. Jandt relates that two men holding hands will in some countries be a sign of friendly affection, whereas in the United States the same tactile code would probably be interpreted as a symbol of homosexual love (85).|$|E
25|$|Though beer {{was drunk}} in Ancient Rome, it was {{replaced}} in popularity by wine. Tacitus wrote disparagingly {{of the beer}} brewed by the Germanic peoples of his day. Thracians were also known to consume beer made from rye, even since the 5th century BC, as the ancient Greek logographer Hellanicus of Lesbos says. Their name for beer was brutos, or brytos. The Romans called their brew cerevisia, from the Celtic word for it. Beer was apparently enjoyed by some Roman legionaries. For instance, among the Vindolanda tablets (from Vindolanda in Roman Britain, dated c. 97-103 AD), the cavalry decurion Masculus {{wrote a letter to}} prefect Flavius Cerialis inquiring about the exact instructions for his men for the following day. This included <b>a</b> <b>polite</b> request for beer to be sent to the garrison (which had entirely consumed its previous stock of beer).|$|E

25|$|The City of Charleston Police Department, with a {{total of}} 458 sworn officers, 117 civilians, and 27 reserve police officers, is South Carolina's largest police department. Their {{procedures}} on cracking down on drug use and gang violence in the city are used as models to other cities to do the same. According to the final 2005 FBI Crime Reports, Charleston crime level is worse than the national average in almost every major category. Greg Mullen, the former Deputy Chief of the Virginia Beach, Virginia Police Department, serves as the current Chief of the Charleston Police Department. The former Charleston police chief was Reuben Greenberg, who resigned August 12, 2005. Greenberg was credited with creating <b>a</b> <b>polite</b> police force that kept police brutality well in check, even as it developed a visible presence in community policing and a significant reduction in crime rates.|$|E
25|$|These beers {{were often}} thick, {{more of a}} gruel than a beverage, and {{drinking}} straws were used by the Sumerians to avoid the bitter solids left over from fermentation.

25|$|It {{is thought}} that during the hunt only {{those people who have}} been {{selected}} by the spirit of the sea could kill the whale. The hunter has to please the killed whale: it must be treated as a guest. Just like <b>a</b> <b>polite</b> host does not leave a recently arrived dear guest alone, thus similarly, the killed whale should not be left alone by the host (i.e. by the hunter who has killed it). Like a guest, it should not get hurt or feel sad. It must be entertained (e.g. by drum music, good foods). On the next whale migration (whales migrate twice a year, in spring to the north and in the autumn back), the previously killed whale is sent off back to the sea {{in the course of a}} farewell ritual. If the killed whale was pleased to (during its being a guest for a half year), then it can be hoped that it will return later, too: thus, also the future whale hunts will succeed.|$|E
