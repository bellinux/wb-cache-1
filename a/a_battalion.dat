5|$|Along with rapid promotion, the war also noticeably {{lowered the}} age of {{battalion}} commanding officers. In 1914, they were aged over 50, while the average age for <b>a</b> <b>battalion</b> commanding officer in the BEF between 1917 and 1918 was 28. By this stage, it was official policy that men over 35 were no longer eligible to command battalions. This trend was reflected amongst the junior officers. Anthony Eden was the Adjutant of <b>a</b> <b>battalion</b> when aged 18, and served as the Brigade Major in the 198th Brigade while still only aged 20.|$|E

While <b>a</b> <b>battalion</b> from the Yiftach Brigade was performed some diversions attacks on Salbit, Imwas and Bayt Nuba, <b>a</b> <b>battalion</b> from the Harel brigade was to take Hill 346, between the fourth and second Legion regiments and <b>a</b> <b>battalion</b> from the Yiftach Brigade was then to pass through it, take Hill 315 and Latrun village and the police fort by the East. The Israeli operation started with an artillery barrage on the fort, the village of Latrun and the positions around. Hills 315 and 346 occupied with a company from the Legion, were not targeted not to alert the Jordanians.|$|E

5|$|At 10:40, Gonen ordered Adan {{to cross}} {{to the west}} bank and Sharon to move towards Suez City.

5|$|At night, Reshef {{moved with}} his {{remaining}} forces {{north along the}} canal bank. Bypassing the 16th Brigade's positions, the Israelis soon found themselves {{in the center of}} a huge administrative area and vehicle park. Reshef's brigade had stumbled into the command and supply bases of the Egyptian 16th and 21st Divisions. The base was located near the canal on the assumption that it was the safest location from Israeli attacks, which was expected to come from the east, where the defenses were the strongest, not from the south, where they were the weakest. Both sides immediately opened fire, inadvertently leading to the destruction of supply trucks and SAM launchers. The Egyptians managed to organize a counterattack by units of the 21st Division; <b>a</b> <b>battalion</b> of the 14th Brigade and <b>a</b> <b>battalion</b> (less one company) of the 18th Brigade. The tanks repelled the Israelis, who sustained significant losses from vastly overwhelming opposing forces.|$|E

5|$|Brumfield {{demanded the}} right to return to Hill 82 in order to destroy the bunker system and to recover the bodies of Parker and Gillson, and he and Major John Essex-Clark—the {{operations}} officer—began planning <b>a</b> <b>battalion</b> attack. However, with American casualties rising and all available helicopters required for casualty evacuation, the planned operation was cancelled. The thick jungle canopy compounded the issue, and Williamson decided to stage the casualties through an area secured by the Australians at LZ Princess. Operation Hump concluded on 9 November, with the US 1/503rd Battalion and 1 RAR being extracted by helicopter and returning to Bien Hoa in the late afternoon. Following 1 RAR's return to Bien Hoa, Brumfield continued to petition for permission to conduct the operation. <b>A</b> <b>battalion</b> attack was subsequently planned for 14 November, but Williamson later deferred it dependent {{on the availability of}} air and helicopter support, and the start date of the upcoming Operation New Life. Ultimately it was never conducted.|$|E

Kamanyola Division units collapsed almost immediately. French units fought the Battle of Kolwezi to recapture the town from the FLNC. The U.S. provided logistical assistance.|$|E
50|$|The {{development}} of Soviet {{tactical nuclear weapons}} required the {{development of}} a new Army structure even before Army Structure I was fully achieved. To minimize the effects of attacks with tactical nuclear weapons on massed forces, the 28,000 strong divisions of the Heer were broken up into smaller and more mobile brigades. These smaller units were also to be capable of self-sustainment on an atomic battlefield for several days, and to be capable of to move quickly from defense and to attack. The new armoured and mechanized brigades were capable of combined arms combat. Each division was composed of three brigades. The armoured brigades consisted of <b>an</b> armoured infantry <b>battalion,</b> two armoured <b>battalions,</b> <b>an</b> armoured artillery <b>battalion</b> and <b>a</b> supply <b>battalion.</b> The mechanized brigades consisted of <b>a</b> motorized infantry <b>battalion,</b> two mechanized infantry <b>battalions,</b> <b>an</b> armored <b>battalion,</b> <b>a</b> field artillery <b>battalion</b> and <b>a</b> supply <b>battalion.</b> The motorized brigades consisted of three motorized infantry <b>battalions,</b> <b>an</b> anti-tank <b>battalion,</b> <b>a</b> field artillery <b>battalion</b> and <b>a</b> supply <b>battalion.</b> The alpine brigades consisted of three alpine <b>battalions,</b> <b>a</b> mountain artillery <b>battalion</b> and <b>a</b> supply <b>battalion.</b> By 1959 the Heer consisted of 11 divisions of 27 brigades, four Panzer (armoured), four Panzergrenadier (mechanized), two Jäger (motorized), and one Gebirgsjäger (alpine).|$|R
