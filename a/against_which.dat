5|$|Agreeing with Browne-Wilkinson, Lord Griffiths also wrote, {{in regards}} to {{legislative}} interpretation, that: The days have long passed when the courts adopted a strict constructionist view of interpretation which required them to adopt the literal meaning of the language.

5|$|Alice's brother-in-law, Erard of Ramerupt, renounced his wife's {{claim to}} Champagne {{in return for}} compensation, even {{promising}} to support Theobald IV against Alice in 1218.

5|$|Another {{factor in}} the Mellotron's sound is that the {{individual}} notes were recorded in isolation. For a musician accustomed to playing in an orchestral setting, this was unusual, and meant that they had nothing <b>against</b> <b>which</b> to intonate. Noted cellist Reginald Kirby refused to downtune his cello to cover the lower range of the Mellotron, and so the bottom notes are actually performed on a double bass. According to Mellotron author Nick Awde, one note of the string sounds contains {{the sound of a}} chair being scraped in the background.|$|E
5|$|Another push against Bosanski Brod was {{launched}} on 27 September. The advance initially had moderate success, until 4 October when the VRS rebalanced its forces, changing the {{sector of the}} bridgehead <b>against</b> <b>which</b> the 1st Krajina Corps was concentrated. The move managed to disrupt the HVO and HV defences and the VRS achieved a breakthrough, capturing Bosanski Brod on 6 October. In response, the HV and the HVO withdrew their troops and equipment in an orderly fashion, and the bridge spanning the Sava between the town and Slavonski Brod was demolished on 7 October.|$|E
5|$|Dissension {{resulting}} from inadequate government attention to Army needs was restrained under {{the generation of}} officers who had begun their careers during the 1820s.

5|$|French and Wabanaki Confederacy raiding {{activity}} {{continued in}} northern Massachusetts in 1705, <b>against</b> <b>which</b> the English colonists {{were unable to}} mount an effective defense.

5|$|Traditionally, {{religious}} {{language has}} been explained as via negativa, analogy, symbolism, or myth, {{each of which}} describes a way of talking about God in human terms. The via negativa {{is a way of}} referring to God according to what God is not; analogy uses human qualities as standards <b>against</b> <b>which</b> to compare divine qualities; symbolism is used non-literally to describe otherwise ineffable experiences; and a mythological interpretation of religion attempts to reveal fundamental truths behind religious stories. Alternative explanations of religious language cast it as having political, performative, or imperative functions.|$|E

5|$|Alexander's legacy {{includes}} the cultural diffusion and syncretism which his conquests engendered, such as Greco-Buddhism. He founded some twenty cities that bore his name, most notably Alexandria in Egypt. Alexander's settlement of Greek colonists {{and the resulting}} spread of Greek culture in the east resulted in a new Hellenistic civilization, aspects of which were still evident in {{the traditions of the}} Byzantine Empire in the mid-15th century AD and the presence of Greek speakers in central and far eastern Anatolia until the 1920s. Alexander became legendary as a classical hero in the mold of Achilles, and he features prominently in the history and mythic traditions of both Greek and non-Greek cultures. He became the measure <b>against</b> <b>which</b> military leaders compared themselves, and military academies throughout the world still teach his tactics. He is often ranked among the most influential people in history.|$|E
5|$|Baggio {{played in}} 16 World Cup matches for Italy; the Republic of Ireland {{is the only}} nation <b>against</b> <b>which</b> he played more than once.

Baggio is the only Italian to have scored in three World Cups (two goals in 1990, five in 1994 and two in 1998). Three of his World Cup goals were scored in the group stage and six were scored during knockout matches. Baggio is the joint fourth-highest scorer for Italy with 27 goals in 56 appearances, with a 0.48 goal per match average. With Baggio, Italy was always eliminated from the World Cup in penalty shootouts: in 1990, in the semi-finals against Argentina; in 1994, in the final against Brazil; and in 1998, in the quarter-finals against France.

5|$|Diseases {{introduced}} to the Americas by the conquistadors had a great impact upon indigenous populations. As the Spanish were occupied with the conquest of Mexico, these diseases ran ahead of them from 1519 onwards. A smallpox epidemic swept through Guatemala in 1520–1521, and {{is also likely to}} have spread throughout the Pipil region of El Salvador. By the time the Spanish arrived in the area in 1524, it is estimated that up to 50% of the native population of El Salvador had already been eliminated by the new diseases, <b>against</b> <b>which</b> they had no immunity. It is likely that disease had significantly weakened the Pipil by the time they fielded large armies against the Spanish at Acajutla and Tacuzcalco. Further waves of epidemic diseases spread across Mesoamerica in 1545–1548, and again in 1576–1581, reducing indigenous populations to just 10% of their pre-contact levels, making successful resistance against the European colonisers extremely difficult. The deadliest of the newly introduced diseases were smallpox, malaria, measles, typhus, and yellow fever. Their introduction was catastrophic in the Americas; it is estimated that 90% of the indigenous population had been eliminated by disease within the first century of European contact.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the eruption, {{scientists}} {{established a}} grid of benchmarks <b>against</b> <b>which</b> they measured the change {{in the shape of the}} island.

The rate of subsidence was initially about 20cm (8in) per year but slowed to 1–2cm (0.4–0.8in) a year by the 1990s. It had several causes: settling of the loose tephra forming the bulk of the volcano, compaction of sea floor sediments underlying the island, and downward warping of the lithosphere due to the weight of the volcano.|$|E
