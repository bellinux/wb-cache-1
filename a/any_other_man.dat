5|$|Uma {{decides to}} go on a fast and relents to none of the family member's request to quit. Hari, left with no other option, {{explains}} his behaviour. Hari reveals to Uma that when he was performing death rituals for Mahadev and offerings were not accepted by crow for a long time, he took a vow that he would not let <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>man</b> touch Uma. Thus, he did not allow practised rituals of shaving her head to be performed and also declined Tara's request of their marriage. When he learned through Tara that Uma has started loving him, he stopped talking to her, in spite of his love towards Uma.|$|E
5|$|Diệm's {{government}} put Ba Cụt on trial. During the proceedings, Ba Cụt theatrically {{removed his}} shirt {{so that the}} public gallery could see how many scars he had suffered while fighting the communists. This, according to him, demonstrated his devotion to Vietnamese nationalism. He challenged <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>man</b> to show as many scars. The Diệmist judge was unimpressed. Ba Cụt {{was found guilty of}} multiple murders and sentenced to death. Diệm's adviser, Colonel Edward Lansdale from the CIA, was one of many who protested against the decision. Lansdale felt that the execution would tarnish Diệm—who had proclaimed the Republic of Vietnam (commonly known as South Vietnam) and declared himself President—and antagonise Ba Cụt's followers. Ngô Đình Nhu, Diệm's younger brother and chief adviser, denied a reprieve as the army, particularly Minh, opposed any clemency. Some sections of the southern public, however, were sympathetic to Ba Cụt.|$|E
5|$|Warwick's {{position}} {{after the}} accession of Edward IV {{was stronger than}} ever. He had now succeeded to his father's possessions, and in 1462 he also inherited his mother's lands and the Salisbury title. Altogether he had an annual income from his lands of over £7,000 far more than <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>man</b> in the realm but the king. Edward confirmed Warwick's position as Captain of Calais, and made him High Admiral of England and Steward of the Duchy of Lancaster, along with several other offices. His brothers also benefited: John Neville, Lord Montagu, was made Warden of the East March in 1463, {{and the next year}} created Earl of Northumberland. George Neville, Bishop of Exeter, was confirmed in his post as chancellor by King Edward, and in 1465 promoted to the archbishopric of York.|$|E

500|$|Because of Minton's {{previous}} Congressional partisanship, many liberals {{believed he}} would support their positions when on the Court.

500|$|Oliver Hazard Perry Throck Morton (August 4, 1823 – November 1, 1877), {{commonly}} known as Oliver P. Morton, was a U.S. Republican Party politician from Indiana.
