The regions around solution features are indicated by a sensor function. The medial axes {{of the strong}} feature regions are calculated so that elements can be clustered around the most important solution features efficiently. Two approaches, a discrete surface-based approach using a Delaunay triangulation method and a mathematical-representation approach using least square fitting, are shown to calculate the medial axes. Remeshing of an initial volume mesh is performed around the medial axes using <b>an</b> <b>advancing</b> front <b>method</b> and/or <b>an</b> <b>advancing</b> layer <b>method.</b> Two examples are shown to present how our approach works.

For a given computational domain, the numerical solution is more accurate as the mesh quality is controlled. Different meshing techniques can be used to achieve finite element meshes.

50|$|Comb {{trapping}} method (also {{known as the}} swarming method) is based on interrupting the honey bee brood cycle. It is <b>an</b> <b>advanced</b> <b>method</b> that removes capped brood from the hive, where the Varroa mites breed. The queen is confined to a comb using a comb cage.

50|$|In {{mathematics}} {{applied to}} computer graphics, nearest neighbor value interpolation is <b>an</b> <b>advanced</b> <b>method</b> of image interpolation. This method uses the pixel value {{corresponding to the}} smallest absolute difference when a set of four known value pixels has no mode. Proposed by Olivier Rukundo in 2012 in his PhD dissertation, the first work presented at the fourth International Workshop on Advanced Computational Intelligence, was based only on the pixel value corresponding to the smallest absolute difference to achieve high resolution and visually pleasant image. This approach was since upgraded {{to deal with a}} wider class of image interpolation artefacts which reduce the quality of image, and as a result, several future developments have emerged, drawing on various aspects of the pixel value corresponding to the smallest absolute difference.|$|E

The development of efficient algorithms for nuclear detonation detection has led to many advancements in other fields such as kriging, <b>an</b> <b>advanced</b> <b>method</b> of interpolation used primarily in geostatistics. Algorithms are used to identify key characteristics of wave forms, such as peak-to-peak distance, amplitude, phase, P-wave amplitude, and S-wave amplitude. P-waves, or primary waves, are compression waves that propagate quickly through rock, and are generally the first waves to reach seismic stations. S-waves, or shear waves, arrive after P-waves. The ratio of P to S waves is one of several important values used to characterize seismic events. When a nuclear detonation has been identified, algorithms are used to estimate the detonation time and explosive yield ...|$|E

The resulting motion information becomes unacceptable, especially in image areas with periodical structures, in the presence of noise or on moving object boundaries. This approach increases the reliability of motion information in those areas and the detection of occluding, appearing and disappearing areas.

50|$|Model {{predictive}} control (MPC) is <b>an</b> <b>advanced</b> <b>method</b> of process control {{that has been}} in use in the process industries in chemical plants and oil refineries since the 1980s. In recent years it has also been used in power system balancing models. Model {{predictive control}}lers rely on dynamic models of the process, most often linear empirical models obtained by system identification. The main advantage of MPC {{is the fact that it}} allows the current timeslot to be optimized, while keeping future timeslots in account. This is achieved by optimizing a finite time-horizon, but only implementing the current timeslot. MPC has the ability to anticipate future events and can take control actions accordingly. PID and LQR controllers do not have this predictive ability. MPC is nearly universally implemented as a digital control, although there is research into achieving faster response times with specially designed analog circuitry.|$|E
50|$|Phased array {{ultrasonic}}s (PA) is <b>an</b> <b>advanced</b> <b>method</b> of {{ultrasonic testing}} that has applications in medical imaging and industrial nondestructive testing. Common applications are to noninvasively examine the heart or to find flaws in manufactured {{materials such as}} welds. Single-element (non-phased array) probes, known technically as monolithic probes, emit a beam in a fixed direction. To test or interrogate a large volume of material, a conventional probe must be physically scanned (moved or turned) to sweep the beam through the area of interest. In contrast, the beam from a phased array probe can be focused and swept electronically without moving the probe. The beam is controllable because a phased array probe {{is made up of}} multiple small elements, each of which can be pulsed individually at a computer-calculated timing. The term phased refers to the timing, and the term array refers to the multiple elements. Phased array ultrasonic testing is based on principles of wave physics, which also have applications in fields such as optics and electromagnetic antennae.|$|E
