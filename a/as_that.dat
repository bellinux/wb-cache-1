5|$|Banksia cuneata is {{most easily}} {{distinguished}} from the other two species in B.subg. Isostylis by its brighter flowers and duller leaves. It further differs from B.ilicifolia in its smaller habit; its smooth bark; its smaller leaves, flowers and fruit; and in its sequence of flower colour changes. The leaves, flowers and fruit of B.oligantha are smaller still, and its foliage is not as prickly <b>as</b> <b>that</b> of B.cuneata.|$|E

5|$|Cubic {{boron nitride}} has a crystal {{structure}} analogous {{to that of}} diamond.
