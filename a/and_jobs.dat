40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the inadequacies {{of the theories}} of motivation <b>and</b> <b>job</b> satisfaction. It argues that the current motivation <b>and</b> <b>job</b> satisfaction theories are culturally biased and more suitable for individualist that collectivist cultures. In addition, they tend to downplay the effects of organisational structure on motivation <b>and</b> <b>job</b> satisfaction. Through a literature review, the author illustrates {{how and why the}} application of the need, process, intrinsic and extrinsic theories of motivation in the collectivist cultures is problematic. In addition, she {{examines the}} roles of organisational structure and design in influencing motivation <b>and</b> <b>job</b> satisfaction <b>and</b> argues that the way an organisation is structured can have an impact on employee's motivation <b>and</b> <b>job</b> satisfaction. To strengthen her arguments, she has used empirical evidence from the study of motivation <b>and</b> <b>job</b> satisfaction among the Brunei Civil Servants. The thesis also assesses the suitability of Western measurements of motivation <b>and</b> <b>job</b> satisfaction more specifically the <b>Job</b> Diagnostic Survey <b>and</b> <b>Job</b> Design Index, <b>and</b> their possible applicability in Brunei.

In addition, St. Louis was named as the city with the highest crime rate in the United States by CQ Press in 2010, using data reported to the FBI in 2009. Critics of these analyses note that division between St. Louis City and St. Louis County make crime reports for the area appear inflated, and that reporting crime differs greatly depending on the localities involved. The FBI cautioned against using this data {{as a form of}} ranking, as it presents too simplistic a view of crime. From 2006 to 2007, the rate of city youth to be killed by guns was the second-highest in the United States, according to data released by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

In April 1915 he welcomed the start of World War I as a conflict that would bring about the defeat of Germany's enemies and the establishment of a golden age for the new Ario-German Empire. Toward the war's end, he {{believed that}} the German war dead would be reincarnated as a generation who would push through with a national revolution and establish this new, better society. For List, this better future would be intricately connected to the ancient past, reflecting his belief in the cyclical nature of time, something which he had adopted both from a reading of Norse mythology and from Theosophy. Reflecting his monarchist beliefs, he envisioned this future state as being governed by the House of Habsburg, with a revived feudal system of land ownership being introduced through which land would be inherited by a man's eldest son. In List's opinion, this new empire would be highly hierarchical, with non-Aryans being subjugated under the Aryan population and opportunities for education <b>and</b> <b>jobs</b> in public service being restricted to those deemed racially pure. He envisioned this Empire following the Wotanic religion which he promoted.|$|E
