5|$|Although {{adequate}} for the town's residents the new stations were {{a long way}} from the seafront attractions, which were <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> steep hill.

5|$|The town sits <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> steeply rising outcrop of Exmoor {{known as}} North Hill, and the {{original}} name of the town was mynydd, which means mountain in Welsh. It has also been written as Mynheafdon (1046), Maneheve (1086), Menehewed (1225) and Menedun (also 1225), which contain elements of Welsh and Old English words for hill.|$|E
5|$|On 19August 1942, while British {{commando}} units attacked bunker {{positions on}} the outskirts of Dieppe, forces of the 2nd Division landed on four beaches. The easternmost, Blue Beach, which was situated <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sheer cliff, presented the most difficulties; the Royal Regiment of Canada, with a company of the Black Watch, was held at bay by two platoons of German defenders. Only six percent of the men that landed on Blue Beach returned to Britain.|$|E

5|$|In the 18th century turnpikes {{arrived in}} the area and then in the 19th {{communications}} improved with the building of the Grand Western Canal, which reached the town in 1835, and then the Bristol and Exeter Railway. Wellington station was opened when the line reached the town on 1 May 1843. It was a typical Brunel design but was rebuilt in 1932 when two loop lines were put in. This entailed the platforms being moved back to accommodate the widened lines. These platforms are clearly visible and a goods shed still stands {{on the east side of}} the line at the Taunton end of the station, although the station closed on 5 October 1964. Wellington was an important station as it stood <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> steep incline. Banking locomotives were kept here, ready to assist heavy westbound trains up to Whiteball Tunnel.|$|E
5|$|In {{the town}} of West Bloomfield, US20 and NY5 go unnamed as they proceed eastward. Roughly one mile from the county line in the hamlet of West Bloomfield, US20 and NY5 meet the {{southern}} terminus of NY65. Exiting the hamlet, US20 and NY5 head through another area dominated by open land, intersecting Elton Road before passing seamlessly into East Bloomfield. A {{mile and a half}} from the town line, US20 and NY5 intersect NY64, a road running northwest–southeast from the Monroe County line south to US20 and NY5. NY64, whose right-of-way ends at US20 and NY5 <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> small hill, joins the two routes eastward on a triple overlap, entering the village of Bloomfield and intersecting the southern terminus of NY444 south of the portion of Bloomfield once known as Holcomb. Near the junction with NY444, US20, NY5 and NY64 take on a due east alignment, absorbing the routing used by Gauss Road west of this point.|$|E

They are captured by Sorsha, who already has Madmartigan in custody, and are taken to a snowbound mountain camp of the Nockmaar army. Willow tries to restore Raziel, but turns her into a rook instead. Madmartigan is dosed with love dust by the brownies and declares his undying love for Sorsha. The prisoners escape and reach a village <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mountain, where they again encounter Airk and the remains of his army, recently defeated by Bavmorda's forces. Madmartigan proclaims his loyalty to the Nelwyn and promises to protect Willow and Elora.|$|E

5|$|To {{learn about}} the Yeti, which he {{depicted}} as a benevolent creature, Hergé contacted his friend Bernard Heuvelmans, the author of On the Trail of Unknown Animals. After re-reading Heuvelmans' description of the Yeti, Hergé went on to research the cryptid species as much as possible. Hergé interviewed mountaineers, including Herzog, who had spotted the tracks of what he believed was an enormous biped that stopped <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> rock face on Annapurna. The creature's care for the starving Chang derives from a Sherpa account of a Yeti that rescued {{a little girl in}} similar circumstances. Another influence came from Fanny Vlaminck, who was interested in extrasensory perception and the mysticism of Tibetan Buddhism, prominent themes in the story that also fascinated Hergé.|$|E
5|$|Aloy {{was cast}} {{out from the}} Nora tribe at birth, raised by an outcast named Rost (JB Blanc). As a child, she {{obtained}} a Focus, a small augmented reality device that gives her special perceptive abilities. After coming of age, Aloy (Ashly Burch) enters a competition called the Proving to win the right to become a Nora Brave, and by extension, {{a member of the}} Nora tribe. Aloy wins the competition, but the Nora are suddenly attacked by cultists. Aloy is almost killed by their leader Helis (Crispin Freeman), but is saved by Rost, who sacrifices himself to save Aloy from a bomb. When Aloy awakes, a Matriarch explains that the cultists had gained control of corrupted machines. Aloy also learns that as an infant, she was found <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sealed door that the Nora worship, and was believed by some to be cursed, hence being cast out. An Oseram foreigner called Olin (Chook Sibtain) informs Aloy that the cultists are part of a fanatical religious group calling themselves the Eclipse. They worship a demon called HADES (John Gonzalez), who allows them to corrupt machines. Olin indicates that the reason Aloy was targeted by the Eclipse was due to her resemblance to an Old World scientist named Dr. Elisabet Sobeck (also voiced by Burch).|$|E
5|$|As of 2017, {{the tomb}} of Neferhotep I has not been {{formally}} identified, although a strong case now exists {{for it to be}} in Abydos. Since 2013 a team of archaeologists from the University of Pennsylvania under the direction of Josef W. Wegner has been excavating a Late Middle Kingdom—Second Intermediate Period royal necropolis in Abydos, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> natural hill known to the ancient Egyptians as the Mountain of Anubis. The necropolis is located just next to the massive funerary complex of Senusret III of the 12th Dynasty and comprises two further large tombs, likely to have been pyramids built during the mid-13th Dynasty, as well as no less than eight royal tombs, possibly dating to the Abydos Dynasty. One of the large tombs, which was extensively plundered of goods and stones during the Second Intermediate Period, known today as tomb S10, is now believed to belong to king Sobekhotep IV, Neferhotep's brother, on the basis of several finds showing Sobkehotep's name from the nearby royal tombs, such as that of Woseribre Senebkay. As a corollary, Wegner suggested that the anonymous, large, neighboring tomb S9 could have belonged to Neferhotep I. Egyptologists have also noted that both kings were very active in the Abydos region during their reigns.|$|E

5|$|The single known living specimen, a {{young adult}} male, was {{collected}} at 80m (260ft) altitude in the Andaladomo forest (part of the Mikea Forest) in 2003. The Andaladomo forest is different in vegetation {{from the rest of}} the Mikea Forest, and is similar to forests further to the north on Madagascar. The animal was found in an isolated fragment of dry deciduous forest amid land cleared for maize cultivation. The trap was set <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>foot</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tree surrounded by bushes and succulent plants. Other small mammals known from the Mikea Forest include the bastard big-footed mouse, the introduced black rat (Rattus rattus), several species of tenrecs, and the shrew Suncus madagascariensis. Although only a single individual of Petter's big-footed mouse was caught during Goodman and Soarimalala's survey, which accrued 3100trap-nights, they argue that this does not necessarily mean the species is rare, since trapping rates for rodents in the dry forests of Madagascar are often variable depending on year and season. Nothing is known of its behavior, but the animal's morphology suggests it lives on the ground.|$|E
