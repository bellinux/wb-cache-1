5|$|The Badlands are a rocky and hilly valley on the {{northern}} borders of the Septimus Heap world, where DomDaniel once practised his dark magic in an observatory atop a hill. They are inhabited by Land Wurms, giant carnivorous snakelike animals, making them <b>a</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>place.</b> Simon Heap also used to live there with Lucy Gringe.|$|E
5|$|Salim {{appears in}} Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception. He is voiced by TJ Ramini. After Drake defeats the henchmen {{in the desert}} ghost town, Salim comes to him on horseback and helps him escape. After Drake was rescued, Salim tells him that the Atlantis of the Sands is <b>a</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>place</b> and that Marlowe cannot be allowed to enter because of the evil within. Drake {{believes}} that she could use these powers to control others through fear, realising it was not treasure they were after. When Sully is rescued, Salim brings both {{of them to the}} open desert where the Atlantis of the Sands is located. Salim heads off and gets separated from Drake and Sully because of the heavy sandstorm. After Talbot is defeated and the Atlantis of the Sands collapse, Salim appears in time to save them.|$|E
5|$|Another {{commonly}} held misconception is that highway overpasses provide adequate shelter from tornadoes. This belief is partly inspired by widely circulated video captured during the 1991 tornado outbreak near Andover, Kansas, where a news crew {{and several other}} people take shelter under an overpass on the Kansas Turnpike and safely ride out a tornado as it passes by. However, a highway overpass is <b>a</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>place</b> during a tornado, and the subjects of the video remained safe due to an unlikely combination of events: the storm in question was a weak tornado, the tornado did not directly strike the overpass, and the overpass itself was of a unique design. Due to the Venturi effect, tornadic winds are accelerated in the confined space of an overpass. Indeed, in the 1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak of May 3, 1999, three highway overpasses were directly struck by tornadoes, and {{at each of the}} three locations there was a fatality, along with many life-threatening injuries. By comparison, during the same tornado outbreak, more than 2000 homes were completely destroyed, with another 7000 damaged, and yet only a few dozen people died in their homes.|$|E

25|$|Governor Don Pedro Fernandez de Busto {{had been}} warned from a vessel that had sailed fast from the {{recently}} sacked city of Santo Domingo that his city would be next. He decided that all value was to be transported inland, while the city itself was evacuated of all non-combatants. Don Pedro Fernandez called for reinforcements from other nearby settlements and the militia of Cartagena was mustered and defences were prepared. The English fleet after leaving Santo Domingo sailed parallel along the New Granadan coast towards Cartagena. Drake knew that the coast was a treacherous one and <b>a</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>place</b> to land sailors let alone soldiers.|$|E
25|$|In historiography, the {{hurricane}} and the rebuilding afterward divide {{what is known}} as the Golden Era (1875–1900) from the Open Era (1920–1957) of Galveston. The most important long-term impact of {{the hurricane}} was to confirm fears that Galveston was <b>a</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>place</b> to make major investments in shipping and manufacturing operations; the economy of the Golden Era was no longer possible as investors fled. In 1920, Prohibition and tax law enforcement opened up new opportunities for criminal enterprises related to gambling and bootlegging in the city. Galveston rapidly became a prime resort destination enabled by the open vice businesses on the island. This new entertainment-based economy brought decades-long prosperity to the island.|$|E
25|$|On {{the eve of}} her 18th birthday, Rapunzel {{requests}} to leave the tower and discover {{the source of the}} lanterns, but Gothel refuses, claiming that the outside world is <b>a</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>place.</b> Meanwhile, thief Flynn Rider steals Rapunzel's crown from the kingdom and inadvertently discovers the tower after ditching his allies, the Stabbington brothers. Rapunzel captures Flynn and discovers the crown, but is unaware of its significance. Rapunzel plans to take Flynn to Gothel to prove she can take care of herself, but before she can do so, Gothel becomes angry, quickly silencing Rapunzel. Rapunzel then asks for a special paint that will take Gothel three days' round trip to obtain and return, and Gothel accepts. Rapunzel convinces a reluctant Flynn to escort her to see the lanterns in exchange for the crown.|$|E

25|$|Adolescence marks a {{rapid change}} in one's role within a family. Young {{children}} tend to assert themselves forcefully, but are unable to demonstrate much influence over family decisions until early adolescence, when they are increasingly viewed by parents as equals. The adolescent faces the task of increasing independence while preserving a caring relationship {{with his or her}} parents. When children go through puberty, there is often a significant increase in parent–child conflict and a less cohesive familial bond. Arguments often concern minor issues of control, such as curfew, acceptable clothing, and the adolescent's right to privacy, which adolescents may have previously viewed as issues over which their parents had complete authority. Parent-adolescent disagreement also increases as friends demonstrate a greater impact on one another, new influences on the adolescent that may be in opposition to parents' values. Social media has also played an increasing role in adolescent and parent disagreements. While parents never had to worry about the threats of social media in the past, it has become <b>a</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>place</b> for children. While adolescents strive for their freedoms, the unknowns to parents of what their child is doing on social media sites is a challenging subject, due to the increasing amount of predators on social media sites. Many parents have very little knowledge of social networking sites {{in the first place and}} this further increases their mistrust. An important challenge for the parent–adolescent relationship is to understand how to enhance the opportunities of online communication while managing its risks. Although conflicts between children and parents increase during adolescence, these are just relatively minor issues. Regarding their important life issues, most adolescents still share the same attitudes and values as their parents.|$|E

500|$|Director Winrich Kolbe {{had some}} {{ideas about how}} the {{engineering}} set, suggesting {{that it should be}} <b>a</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>place</b> with the Voyager crew looking down on the engine core. Braga compared the idea to the Foucault pendulum in the rotunda at Griffith Observatory. James' designs were not as elaborate as Kolbe suggested, but together with visual effects supervisor Ronald B. Moore they worked out a means of enabling the director to film from above. They raised the set [...] over a blue screen to enable it to be backlit properly. Kolbe had a further impact on the design of the set; he suggested in a production meeting on February 25 that the change of lighting suggesting by James for the bridge should shift from the Starfleet colors to orange in order to maximise the alien effect. James produced a foamcore model of the Dauntless bridge, to both illustrate the final construction and to enable Kolbe to plan out his camera angles while it was still being built.|$|E
500|$|Later, {{while talking}} to Sayo's classmates, Sota learns about a legendary paint nicknamed [...] "Night-Sky" [...] {{which can only}} be {{produced}} from materials unique to a particular pond. Sayo and Sota resolve to find the pond together. However, the route to the pond is dangerous, and involves passing through a train tunnel. In the tunnel Sayo trips and is nearly run over by a train. Sota manages to pull her out just in time, but is scolded by Mr. Arima, Sayo's father, for taking her to such <b>a</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>place.</b> He tells his wife not to let them meet again. Later, Sota returns to the pond with the circus clown. Sota offers to paint a picture of him, but the clown refuses and advises Sota to paint whatever his heart desires. He decides to paint Sayo playing the piano after he watches Sayo play the [...] "Clair de lune". To save money for the painting paper, Sota goes hungry and eats just a few grains of rice each day. Sota's grandfather dies, and after the funeral, Sota goes to the circus to find solace in the circus clown, only to discover that the circus has moved away.|$|E

500|$|The Marble Index [...] "failed to {{challenge}} the supremacy of Nashville Skyline, From Elvis in Memphis, Abbey Road and Diana Ross & the Supremes Join the Temptations on the album charts of 1969". Although Holzman {{was pleased with the}} album, Nico's longevity with the label was unlikely; he was increasingly concerned with her heroin use and she had a difficult, irresponsible attitude. Nico left the United States before she was officially released from Elektra, after a violent incident in a New York City bar. Biographers refer to her leaving the U.S. as an exile; Nico said, [...] "When you live in <b>a</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>place,</b> you also become increasingly dangerous. You might just wind up in jail." [...] In London she recorded two more albums with Cale in the same vein: Desertshore (1970) and The End... (1974), now considered parts of a trilogy. The album was reissued as a CD in 1991 with two bonus tracks. Songs off The Marble Index have been included in Nico compilations, including The Classic Years (1998), Femme Fatale (2002), and The Frozen Borderline – 1968–1970 (2007). To celebrate Elektra's 60th anniversary, [...] "Frozen Warnings" [...] was released as a single on October 25, 2010, with [...] "No One Is There" [...] as its B-side.|$|E
500|$|The St. Pauli {{quarter of}} Hamburg, where the Indra club was located, {{was well known}} as an area where prostitutes were to be found, and was <b>a</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>place</b> for anyone that looked {{different}} from the usual clientele. McCartney's father, Jim McCartney, was reluctant to let his teenage son go to Hamburg, but relented after a visit from Williams, who {{told him that he}} [...] "shouldn't worry". Lennon's aunt, Mimi Smith, was also reluctant to allow Lennon to go to Hamburg, wanting Lennon to continue his studies, but Lennon placated her by exaggerating the amount he would earn. Best had an audition in Williams' Jacaranda club on 15 August 1960, and travelled to Hamburg the next day {{as a member of the}} group. Williams later admitted that the audition with Best was not needed, as they had not found any other drummer willing to travel to Hamburg, but did not tell Best in case he asked for more money. The group were to be paid about £100 per week, which was much more than promoters in Liverpool paid. Williams drove the group and their equipment in his Austin J4 minibus which was loaded by crane onto a ferry at Harwich on 16 August 1960, and landed at the Hook of Holland.|$|E

2500|$|Until the 1980s, {{laws in the}} United States and Canada {{required}} all freight {{trains to}} have a caboose and a full crew, for safety.

The railroads also claimed a caboose was also <b>a</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>place,</b> as slack run-ins could hurl the crew from their places and even dislodge weighty equipment.|$|E
