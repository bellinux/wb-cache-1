5|$|Divorcing <b>a</b> <b>spouse</b> was {{permissible}} {{if there}} was mutual consent, while remarriage {{after the death of}} <b>a</b> <b>spouse</b> was common during the Song period. However, widows under post-Song dynasties did not often remarry, following the ethic of the Confucian philosopher Cheng Yi (1033–1107), who stated that it was better for a widow to die than lose her virtue by remarrying. Widows remarrying another after the death of a first spouse did not become common again until the late Qing dynasty (1644–1912), yet such an action was still regarded as morally inferior.|$|E

5|$|Careful {{selection}} of <b>a</b> <b>spouse</b> {{was important to}} maintain the royal status of a family: depending {{on the law of}} the land in question, if a prince or king was to marry a commoner who had no royal blood, even if the first-born was acknowledged as a son of a sovereign, he might not be able to claim any of the royal status of his father.|$|E

50|$|The {{standard}} English term brother-in-law {{applies to}} both <b>a</b> <b>spouse’s</b> brother and <b>a</b> <b>spouse’s</b> sister’s husband. <b>A</b> man’s relationship {{with these two}} entails two quite different sets of obligations and norms in Ugandan society.

5|$|As <b>a</b> <b>spouse,</b> surgeon, and mother, Meredith has cited {{a number}} times {{that she did}} not want to be like either of her parents: her father had {{followed}} her mother around pathetically before leaving to be happy, while her mother valued her career over her family. Meredith is frequently conflicted trying to balance between the two, and fears her family are hindering her medical aspirations, as much as she fears becoming like her mother whenever she's tempted to choose surgery over family. Meredith and Cristina have a huge rift when Cristina confirms Meredith's fears by stating that Meredith's skills have fallen behind Cristina's due to her familial obligations taking her away from OR time.|$|E
5|$|Dementia {{caregivers}} {{are subject}} to high rates of physical and mental disorders. Factors associated with greater psychosocial problems of the primary caregivers include having an affected person at home, the carer being <b>a</b> <b>spouse,</b> demanding behaviours of the cared person such as depression, behavioural disturbances, hallucinations, sleep problems or walking disruptions and social isolation. Regarding economic problems, family caregivers often give up time from work to spend 47 hours per week on average with the person with AD, while the costs of caring for them are high. Direct and indirect costs of caring for an Alzheimer's patient average between $18,000 and $77,500 {{per year in the}} United States, depending on the study.|$|E

5|$|The {{article was}} {{published}} {{during a period}} of intense public debate. Freedom of press had been established in 1766 and encouraged people to give their suggestions on how to improve Swedish society. Economy, emigration, agriculture and education were hotly debated issues, as well as the problematic situation for unmarried middle class women. Without <b>a</b> <b>spouse</b> a woman in 18th century Sweden could have great difficulty supporting herself, especially as lower ranking servants were often promoted to maids and thereby lowering the number of employment opportunities for unmarried women.|$|E
5|$|During the deportations, {{he tried}} to secure more work permits from the Germans but they refused to issue them. He {{attempted}} to protect those he could. During the Aktion on 3–5 November, in which the paperwork of everyone in the ghetto was checked, holders of work passes– which allowed the holder to protect <b>a</b> <b>spouse</b> and only two children under 16– were checked and anyone not listed on someone's work permit was sent to Ponary. At one point, while Gens was checking permits, a family with three children went through the checkpoint, and Gens pulled aside the third child. Shortly afterwards, a family with only one child passed through the checkpoint. Gens began berating the father for losing track of his second child, and pushed the third child from the first family into the second family. This incident took place {{under the supervision of}} German officials, who did not intervene.|$|E

Overwhelmed by the cultural changes, Jean often stays inside at the hotel, while her husband Douglas explores the sights. Graham finds that the area has greatly changed since his youth and disappears on long outings every day. Muriel, despite her xenophobia, starts to appreciate her doctor for his skill and the hotel maid for her good service. Evelyn gets a job advising the staff of a call centre on how to interact with older British customers. Sonny struggles to raise funds to renovate the hotel and sees his girlfriend Sunaina (Tena Desae), despite his mother's disapproval. Madge joins the Viceroy Club seeking <b>a</b> <b>spouse,</b> where she is surprised to find Norman. She introduces him to Carol (Diana Hardcastle).

40|$|Economic theory {{predicts a}} {{negative}} association between spouses' levels of occupational attainment due to gains from specialization between housework and paid work. Sociology typically stresses facilitating effects of network resources on occupational attainment. Spouses are network members {{who may be}} {{able and willing to}} provide such resources. According to this argument, a positive association between spouses' levels of attainment is expected. Confronting these two alternative hypotheses, questions on the effects of spouse's resources on occupational attainment are addressed. We analyse the Dutch Family Survey 1992 / 93, a survey that covers the complete job histories of about 700 couples. Hypotheses on positive and negative effects of <b>a</b> <b>spouse's</b> resources on employment entry and exit and on job mobility are tested in an event-history analysis. The analysis shows that <b>a</b> <b>spouse's</b> financial resources hinder occupational attainment, while <b>a</b> <b>spouse's</b> human capital has facilitating effects, and therefore both economic and sociological theories are corroborated...|$|R

40|$|A {{married person}} {{sometimes}} acts solely {{for herself and}} at other times on behalf of her spouse. If she incurs debt solely for herself, then only she is liable to the creditor. If, however, she incurs debt both for herself and on behalf of her spouse, both are liable – the debtor directly and the spouse indirectly by imputed liability. Before married women’s property reform, imputed marital liability followed from marital status. As marriage changed to recognize the legal individuality of both spouses, so too did the scope of <b>a</b> <b>spouse’s</b> imputed liability for the debts of the other spouse. Today, the scope of <b>a</b> <b>spouse’s</b> imputed liability for the debts of <b>an</b> insolvent <b>spouse</b> defines <b>an</b> important and largely unexamined aspect {{of what it means to}} be married. Despite change in the terms of marriage between the parties, courts continue to view imputed marital liability with sensitivity to the historical privilege of marital investment and the unique social value of trust and dependency within marriage...|$|R
30|$|By contrast, Figure  2 {{depicts a}} much smaller {{difference}} {{in the proportion of}} migrants who send remittances and marry <b>a</b> German <b>spouse</b> rather than <b>a</b> non-German.

The shift is especially large for men who marry <b>a</b> non-German <b>spouse,</b> among whom, few report sending remittances before marriage. Interestingly, more men who marry <b>a</b> German <b>spouse</b> remit before marriage than their counterparts who marry a non-German. But after marriage slightly more male migrants who marry a non-German remit. The number of women who remit is much more constant around marriage. Similar proportions of women who marry a German and <b>a</b> non-German <b>spouse</b> send remittances until about three years after marriage, then many women who married <b>a</b> German <b>spouse</b> stop remitting. Observations for the year of marriage seem to be extremely noisy and are thus excluded from the analysis.|$|R
