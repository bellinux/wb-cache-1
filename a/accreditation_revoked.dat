40|$|As Christian {{business}} {{faculty and}} administrators, we desire {{to use our}} gifts, talents, and resources to their fullest capacity for Christ, {{and to have the}} greatest impact on Christian students, in order to expand the Kingdom of God. To do this, it is critical to provide Christian business students with the highest quality programs we can possibly develop and sustain. Christian business students who are excellently trained in high quality business theory and practice, will be able to translate their competence in business – and their Christian witness – to make a greater impact for Christ in the business world, than they could if they took low quality skills and strong faith into their business careers. In addition, universities facing reaffirmation of accreditation by their regional associations find that the assessment of student learning has become a significant requirement in the self-study process. The Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) changed its review process to include a shorter capacity audit and a longer effectiveness audit. The effectiveness audit includes institutional effectiveness, of which a primary component is educational effectiveness and student learning outcomes assessment. Institutions of higher education that cannot demonstrate significant work in the use of evidence to determine students ’ progress on learning objectives, will be put on probation, or worse – see their <b>accreditation</b> <b>revoked...</b>|$|E
