5|$|Prior to {{the opening}} of Kristiansund Airport, Kvernberget, Braathens SAFE applied for <b>a</b> <b>concession</b> to fly to it along the West Coast, as well as the direct route from Oslo.

In 1917 a pumphouse powered by a steam boiler and engine was built: this pumped the water from one basin into the other, then across Presque Isle Bay to Erie.
