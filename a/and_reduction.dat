Conant ran a series of experiments with electrochemical oxidation <b>and</b> <b>reduction,</b> {{following in the footsteps}} of the famous German chemist and Nobel laureate Fritz Haber. He determined that the iron centre in methemoglobin is a ferric (FeIII) centre, unlike the ferrous (FeII) centre found in normal hemoglobin, and this difference in oxidation state is the cause of methemoglobinemia, a medical condition which causes tissue hypoxia.|$|E
5|$|In {{more general}} usage, noise is any {{unwanted}} sound or signal. In this sense, even sounds {{that would be}} perceived as musically ordinary in another context become noise if they interfere with the reception of a message desired by the receiver. Prevention <b>and</b> <b>reduction</b> of unwanted sound, from tape hiss to squeaking bass drum pedals, is important in many musical pursuits, but noise is also used creatively in many ways, and in some way in nearly all genres.|$|E

5|$|After {{the end of}} the war, the {{division}} remained on mainland Japan. It occupied Kyūshū from 1945 until 1950. During this time, the US Army shrank. At the end of World War II it contained 89 divisions, but by 1950, the 24th Infantry Division was one of only 10 active divisions in the force. It was one of four understrength divisions on occupation duty in Japan. The others were the 1st Cavalry Division, 7th Infantry Division, and 25th Infantry Division, all under control of the Eighth United States Army. The 24th Division retained the 19th, 21st, and 34th regiments, but the formations were undermanned and ill-equipped due to the post-war drawdown <b>and</b> <b>reduction</b> in military spending.|$|E

5|$|Americium readily {{reacts with}} oxygen and dissolves well in acids. The most common {{oxidation}} state for americium is +3, in which americium compounds are rather stable against oxidation <b>and</b> <b>reduction.</b> In this sense, americium is chemically similar to most lanthanides. The trivalent americium forms insoluble fluoride, oxalate, iodate, hydroxide, phosphate and other salts. Other oxidation {{states have been}} observed between +2 and +7, which is the widest range among the actinide elements. Their color in aqueous solutions varies as follows: Am3+ (colorless to yellow-reddish), Am4+ (yellow-reddish), AmV; (yellow), AmVI (brown) and AmVII (dark green). All oxidation states have their characteristic optical absorption spectra, with a few sharp peaks in the visible and mid-infrared regions, and the position and intensity of these peaks can be converted into the concentrations of the corresponding oxidation states. For example, Am(III) has two sharp peaks at 504 and 811nm, Am(V) at 514 and 715nm, and Am(VI) at 666 and 992nm.|$|E
5|$|Bottlenose {{dolphins}} are not endangered. Their {{future is}} stable {{because of their}} abundance and adaptability. However, specific populations are threatened due to various environmental changes. The population in the Moray Firth in Scotland is estimated to consist of around 190 individuals, and are under threat from harassment, traumatic injury, water pollution <b>and</b> <b>reduction</b> in food availability. Likewise, an isolated population in Doubtful Sound, New Zealand, is in decline due to calf loss coincident {{to an increase in}} warm freshwater discharge into the fjord. Less local climate change, such as increasing water temperature may also play a role but has never been shown to be the case. One of the largest coastal populations of bottlenose dolphins in Shark Bay, Western Australia was forecast to be stable with little variation in mortality over time (Manlik et al. 2016).|$|E

The territory was well populated by a diverse range of indigenous peoples, including Lencas, Nahuas and Misumalpas. The exact political composition of the territory was unknown to the Spanish, such that the Spanish Crown prohibited campaigns of conquest <b>and</b> <b>reduction</b> in Taguzgalpa owing to ignorance of its makeup.|$|E

Our results show that the notion of completeness under random reductions is sensitive tovery smallchanges in success probability, since we can separate completeness under reductions with very small differ- ences in success probability.

He drove through the restructuring of Britain's network of overseas outposts and colonies into the network of economically and politically interdependent states which became the British Empire, aiming for a gradual abolition of slavery and accelerating British colonisation.|$|E
5|$|In {{the history}} of the carnivores, the family Canidae is {{represented}} by the two extinct subfamilies designated as Hesperocyoninae and Borophaginae, and the extant subfamily Caninae. This subfamily includes all living canids and their most recent fossil relatives. All living canids as a group form a dental monophyletic relationship with the extinct borophagines with both groups having a bicuspid (two points) on the lower carnassial talonid, which gives this tooth an additional ability in mastication. This together with the development of a distinct entoconid cusp and the broadening of the talonid of the first lower molar, and the corresponding enlargement of the talon of the upper first molar <b>and</b> <b>reduction</b> of its parastyle distinguish these late Cenozoic canids and are the essential differences that identify their clade.|$|E

5|$|Telecommunication and {{broadcast}} networks {{can be affected}} by volcanic ash in the following ways: attenuation <b>and</b> <b>reduction</b> of signal strength; damage to equipment; and overloading of network through user demand. Signal attenuation due to volcanic ash is not well documented; however, {{there have been reports}} of disrupted communications following the 1969 Surtsey eruption and 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption. Research by the New Zealand-based Auckland Engineering Lifelines Group determined theoretically that impacts on telecommunications signals from ash would be limited to low frequency services such as satellite communication. Signal interference may also be caused by lightning, as this is frequently generated within volcanic eruption plumes.|$|E

The retreat of the Coropuna glaciers threatens the water supply {{of tens of thousands of}} people, and interaction between volcanic activity and glacial effects has generated mudflows that could be a hazard to surrounding populations if the mountain returns to volcanic activity.|$|E
5|$|Braham {{stayed in}} the RAF and joined the Night Fighter Development Wing of the Central Fighter Establishment where he tested and {{developed}} existing and new night fighting equipment. However, the massive disarmament <b>and</b> <b>reduction</b> of the RAF—mimicking that of the early 1920s—disillusioned Braham even more. Flying was reduced to save costs and removed the one activity that had drawn him into the RAF in 1937. Initially he still managed regular flights to Belgium, where the RAF retained large bases. While there {{he was awarded the}} Order of the Crown and Croix de guerre with Palm for his wartime work. The arrangement was short-lived. The Central Fighter Establishment was cut by half. Coupled with rationing and a declining standard of living and low-wages, Braham resigned from the RAF in March 1946 and applied to join the Rhodesian Colonial Police. Bill Gregory heard of Braham's decision and contacted Basil Embry, Braham's former commanding officer. Embry soon persuaded him to return to the RAF at the rank of flight lieutenant with the pay of an acting wing commander. There followed a period of two years of non-flying appointments in the Air Ministry in London.|$|E
