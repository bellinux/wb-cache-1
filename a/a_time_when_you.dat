"Drive" [...] {{was written}} by Mike Will Made It, Cyrus, Pierre Ramon Slaughter, and Samuel Jean; it was {{produced}} by Mike Will Made It, with co-production by P-Nasty, and engineered by Chris [...] "Tek" [...] O'Ryan. Stephen Hybicki recorded the song, which was later mixed by Jaycen Joshua with assistance from Ryan Kaul. Cyrus commented that the song was written on Valentine's Day in 2013, which was [...] "emotionally [...] such a hard time"; she elaborated that the track was [...] "about needing to leave someone but not really wanting to completely cut yourself off from the relationship. It’s <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> want to leave but you can’t. It’s also about moving on." [...] It has been widely speculated to {{have been inspired by}} Cyrus' former fiancé Liam Hemsworth.|$|E

500|$|Anderson {{sought to}} capture the nostalgic feel of the 1950s. In this effort, he used several themes {{associated}} with the time period, including alien invasion movies, nuclear threats, Cold War paranoia, and optimism in the future. About the time period, Anderson said [...] "it seemed like this was <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> could say with a straight face, 'I'm fighting for truth, justice and the American way.'" [...] For the characters Anderson was picturing George Reeves's Superman and Noel Neill's Lois Lane as portrayed in the 1950s television series Adventures of Superman. One reviewer noted that Anderson's portrayal of Lex Luthor {{is that of the}} post-Crisis on Infinite Earths amoral businessman and Batman was more reminiscent of a 1930s-style or a [...] ""-style Batman where he is actively pursued by the police.|$|E

500|$|Bridges re-joined Conference National side Kettering Town on 1 August 2011, {{signing a}} two-year {{deal with the}} club. He joined Kettering on a free transfer, having been out of {{contract}} at Stevenage — [...] "I got injured at {{the back end of}} last season and I was out of contract and because of all the deals that needed to be sorted at Stevenage, I wasn't a priority and I had to wait. There comes <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> can't wait any longer and I needed to sort my future out so here we are". Bridges made his Kettering Town debut in a 2–0 away win at Lincoln City on 10 September 2011, the club's first away victory of the season. After making just five appearances for Kettering, Bridges was transfer-listed by new manager Mark Stimson on 29 September. Despite being transfer-listed due to Kettering's financial problems, Bridges continued to play in the first-team, and he scored his first goal for the club in a 2–2 draw against Ebbsfleet United, scoring from close range to give the club an initial one-goal lead. Bridges scored once again in a 2–1 home defeat to Grimsby Town on 26 November 2011, scoring in injury-time to half the deficit. Bridges was forced to take training following the departure of Stimson, with only six other Kettering players turning up to train due to unpaid wages. Despite the off-field problems, he remained ever-present {{for the remainder of the}} season, playing 38 times in all competitions, and scoring his third and final goal of the campaign in a 1–1 home draw with Barrow in April 2012. Kettering were relegated, finishing bottom of the league, and faced a further relegation due to entering a Company Voluntary Arrangement. Bridges had one year remaining on his contract at Kettering, but left in July 2012, calling the campaign the [...] "worst of his career".|$|E

2500|$|Being {{a period}} of that era of the 1950's I think being gay must have been pretty harsh for Graham. I can imagine...everybody knew, nobody cared, but I think it was such <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> didn't talk about issues that were personal, and I think that made him much more secretive and reclusive, and I think that was {{probably}} quite a tough thing for him... — Susan Gaye Anderson ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2003 Paul Kosky and {{the band}} had an [...] "acrimonious" [...] split; which [...] "almost spelt the end" [...] for the band. According to Mathieson [...] "the band were {{starting}} to bristle at the extent of Kosky's involvement {{in every aspect of}} their stalled career." [...] Kosky felt he was a scapegoat for problems with the second album including its poorer commercial performance: [...] "Everyone was looking for a fall guy. It happened to be me and I left gracefully. I put my life into it for five years and I gambled a lot. Like any relationship, you find <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> move on." [...] Chris Robinson bought out Kosky's share of their partnership in Wah Wah Music and became the band's new manager.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{returning}} to the campaign trail after her debate preparation, Palin stepped up her attacks on the Democratic candidate for President, Senator Barack Obama. At a fundraising event, Palin explained her new aggressiveness, saying, [...] "There does come <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> {{have to take the}} gloves off and that time is right now." [...] In a campaign appearance on October 4, Palin accused Obama of regarding America as [...] "so imperfect that he's palling around with terrorists who would target their own country." [...] The accusation referred to Obama's contacts with Bill Ayers, a founder of the 1960s radical group called the Weathermen, and a New York Times article describing such contacts. The Obama campaign called the allegation a [...] "smear", citing newspaper commentaries critical of Palin's attack. Obama has condemned the Weathermen's violent actions. The criticism of Obama based on his purported relationship with Ayers was subsequently carried on by McCain himself.|$|E
