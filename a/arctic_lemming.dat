40|$|The generic {{status of}} Lasiopodomys and its {{division}} into subgenera Lasiopodomys (L. mandarinus, L. brandtii) and Stenocranius (L. gregalis, L. raddei) are not generally accepted because of contradictions between the morphological and molecular data. To obtain cytogenetic {{evidence for the}} Lasiopodomys genus and its subgenera and to test the autosome to sex chromosome translocation hypothesis of sex chromosome complex origin in L. mandarinus proposed previously, we hybridized chromosome painting probes from the field vole (Microtus agrestis, MAG) and the <b>Arctic</b> <b>lemming</b> (Dicrostonyx torquatus, DTO) onto the metaphases of a female Mandarin vole (L. mandarinus, 2 n = 47) and a male Brandt's vole (L. brandtii, 2 n = 34). In addition, we hybridized <b>Arctic</b> <b>lemming</b> painting probes onto chromosomes of a female narrow-headed vole (L. gregalis, 2 n = 36). Cross-species painting revealed three cytogenetic signatures (MAG 12 / 18, 17 a/ 19, and 22 / 24) that could validate the genus Lasiopodomys and indicate the evolutionary affinity of L. gregalis to the genus. Moreover, all three species retained the associations MAG 1 bc/ 17 b and 2 / 8 a detected previously in karyotypes of all arvicolins studied. The associations MAG 2 a/ 8 a/ 19 b, 8 b/ 21, 9 b/ 23, 11 / 13 b, 12 b/ 18, 17 a/ 19 a, and 5 fissions of ancestral segments appear to be characteristic for the subgenus Lasiopodomys. We also validated the autosome to sex chromosome translocation hypothesis {{on the origin of}} complex sex chromosomes in L. mandarinus. Two translocations of autosomes onto the ancestral X chromosome in L. mandarinus led to a complex of neo-X 1, neo-X 2, and neo-X 3 elements. Our results demonstrate that genus Lasiopodomys represents a striking example of rapid chromosome evolution involving both autosomes and sex chromosomes. Multiple reshuffling events including Robertsonian fusions, chromosomal fissions, inversions and heterochromatin expansion have {{led to the formation of}} modern species karyotypes in a very short time, about 2. 4 MY...|$|E
40|$|Questions: Assuming that <b>arctic</b> <b>lemming</b> {{oscillations}} {{are generated}} by interactions between lemmings and depletable plants, how should these oscillations change {{in response to}} varying densities of marine-subsidized predators and differences {{in the production of}} herbaceous forage? Are the patterns thus generated consistent with existing data? Features of the model: Rosenzweig-type predator–prey model, with lemmings interacting with depletable plants and herbaceous plants. The impact of marine-subsidized predators is included as an extra mortality factor, influencing lemmings in summer. Ranges of parameters: We set the carrying capacity of depletable plants at 2000 kg ·ha− 1. We used carrying capacities for herbaceous plants of 1000 kg ·ha− 1 (grassland/meadow) and 100 kg ·ha− 1 (heath). In the absence of predation, we assume that the population growth rate of lemmings in summer is zero when their foraging rate is 44 % of the saturation rate. In subsequent simulations, we successively increased the foraging rate required for a zero population growth rate to simulate the impact of a successively larger pool of marine-subsidized predators...|$|E
50|$|Among {{the species}} that inhabit various polar seas and {{surrounding}} land areas are polar bear, penguin, reindeer (caribou), muskox, wolverine, ermine, <b>lemming,</b> <b>Arctic</b> hare, Arctic ground squirrel, whale, harp seal, and walrus. These species have unique adaptations to the extreme conditions. Many might be endangered if they cannot adapt to changing conditions. Contrary to popular opinion, the World Wildlife Fund studies for polar bears show that this species has prospered since 1950, attaining five times the numbers found in 1950. In general, Arctic ecosystems are relatively fragile and slow to recover from serious damage.|$|R
50|$|The {{island has}} little or no vegetation. Where {{continuous}} vegetation occurs, it usually consists of hummocks of mosses, lichens, grasses, and sedges. The only woody species, the dwarf willow, grows as a dense twisted mat crawling along the ground. However, a diverse animal population exists: polar bear, Peary caribou, muskox, northern collared <b>lemming,</b> <b>Arctic</b> wolf, Arctic fox, Arctic hare, and ermine (stoat) are common. A 2003 sighting of a grizzly bear and grizzly tracks by an expedition from the University of Alberta represent the most northerly reports of grizzly bears ever recorded.|$|R
40|$|The cyclicity of Arctic {{populations of}} small rodents {{is a subject}} {{with a long history}} and a large {{literature}} (Batzli, 1992) in which the question "What drives the cycle?" has received many answers, among them that the source of the cycle is either rodent interaction with food or the interaction with predators or both. Another question concerns the confinement of the cycle to Arctic conditions. The paper by Garding (2000) presented a simple mathematical model of the combined predator-prey-food interaction based on a general eater-food interaction in which cycle length is an explicit decreasing function of the average birth rate of eaters. In the combined interaction, the cycle length is the same function of the sum of the average birth rates of predators and preys Numerical fits of these models make it possible to answer the questions above. The results are that the short 3 - 5 year cycles of the <b>Arctic</b> rodents: <b>lemming</b> (Lemmus lemmus) and vole (Microtus agrestis) are mainly driven by interaction with food while the ten year cycle of the Canadian snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus), is driven by interaction with its predator - lynx. Rodents in the Arctic live and breed in burrows and experience predation pressure when surfacing. This explains their interaction with food. The greater variety and easier availability of food in a temperate climate accounts for a missing rodent interaction with food. The paper starts with a presentation of the eater-food interaction model itself, its simple but unfamiliar mathematics and its points of credibility. At the end of the paper sonic current hypotheses {{about the nature of the}} rodent cycle are seen in the light of the model used here...|$|R
40|$|The Late Quaternary {{has been}} a period of {{significant}} change for terrestrial mammals, including episodes of extinction, population sub-division and colonisation. Studying this period provides a means to improve understanding of evolutionary mechanisms, and to determine processes {{that have led to}} current distributions. For large mammals, recent work has demonstrated the utility of ancient DNA in understanding demographic change and phylogenetic relationships, largely through well-preserved specimens from permafrost and deep cave deposits. In contrast, much less ancient DNA work has been conducted on small mammals. This project focuses on the development of ancient mitochondrial DNA datasets to explore the utility of rodent ancient DNA analysis. Two studies in Europe investigate population change over millennial timescales. <b>Arctic</b> collared <b>lemming</b> (Dicrostonyx torquatus) specimens are chronologically sampled from a single cave locality, Trou Al’Wesse (Belgian Ardennes). Two end Pleistocene population extinction-recolonisation events are identified and correspond temporally with - localised disappearance of the woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius). A second study examines postglacial histories of European water voles (Arvicola), revealing two temporally distinct colonisation events in the UK. Two further studies of Caribbean rodent species assess DNA recovery from more recent, yet highly degraded, material. The Hispaniolan hutia (Plagiodontia aedium), {{one of the few remaining}} endemic Caribbean land mammals, is found to represent three distinct lineages, biogeographically consistent with the island’s Cenozoic origins and geographic heterogeneity. The extinct Antillean rice rats (Oryzomyini) were once endemic throughout the Lesser Antilles. Phylogenetic analysis of zooarchaeological rice rat material recovered from across the Lesser Antillean reveals a new genus of rice rat and at least two separate colonisation events, via over water dispersal, from South America. These overall findings demonstrate the utility of ancient rodent DNA in eliciting individual response patterns across rodent species and exploring topics of wider evolutionary interest...|$|R
50|$|During the Pleistocene interglacials, arctic {{animals that}} are no longer extant {{occupied}} Scotland, including the woolly rhinoceros, mammoth, polar bear, <b>lemming,</b> <b>Arctic</b> fox and the giant deer Megaloceros giganteus. Other mammals that used to inhabit Scotland but became extinct in the wild during historic times include the Eurasian lynx, which lived in Britain until 1,500 years ago, the European brown bear, subspecies Ursus arctos caledoniensis, which was taken to entertain the Roman circuses but died out in the 9th or 10th century, and the elk, which lasted until about 1300. The wild boar and wild ox or urus died out in the subsequent two centuries, although the former's domesticated cousin, the grice, lasted until 1930 in Shetland. The last known wolf was shot on Mackintosh land in Inverness-shire in 1743, and the walrus is now only an occasional vagrant. St Kilda also possessed an endemic subspecies of the house mouse, Mus musculus muralis, which was longer, hairier, coloured differently and had a skull shape at variance to the norm. It became extinct in 1938, just eight years after the evacuation of the native St Kildans.|$|R
