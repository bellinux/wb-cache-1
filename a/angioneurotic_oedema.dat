40|$|Hereditary <b>angioneurotic</b> <b>oedema</b> is an {{autosomal}} dominant disorder associated with serum deficiency of functionally active C 1 inhibitor protein. This decrease {{is characterized by}} episodic swelling of subcutaneous tissues, of abdominal viscera and of the upper airway. Attacks of <b>angioneurotic</b> <b>oedema,</b> sometimes fatal when involving the upper airway, can occur during any surgery. It is therefore necessary to prepare affected patients before surgery. This review article describes the various preventive treatments used to avoid attacks during surgery: antifibrinolytic agents, androgens, fresh frozen plasma, C 1 esterase inhibitor concentrate.

40|$|A 44 year-old {{man came}} to the {{emergency}} room complaining of a sudden swelling of the sub-cutaneous soft tissue of the face and neck. He was treated with an H 1 anti-histamine agent, corticoids and fresh frozen plasma. The oedema regressed favourably within a few days. The final diagnosis was <b>angioneurotic</b> <b>oedema</b> related to prior medication with lisinopril. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are increasingly prescribed. These drugs have few undesirable side effects but can lead to <b>angioneurotic</b> <b>oedema</b> in 0. 1 to 0. 3 % of the cases.

It is thus important in the emergency room to recognize this potentially mortal side effect. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Fifteen {{members from}} a new family in which {{hereditary}} <b>angioneurotic</b> <b>oedema</b> exists have been studied with respect to serum concentrations of some components of the complement system. C' 1 q levels {{were found to be}} normal in all family members studied. C' 1 haemolytic activity, previously reported to be decreased during attacks of oedema in some patients with this disease, was always within normal limits in our patients. Haemolytic C' 4 activity was found to be subnormal in diseased individuals both during and between acute episodes, an abnormality which is useful as a diagnostic tool. Serum C' 2 activity, previously used as a diagnostic indicator, was found to be normal in some affected individuals between attacks and only slightly decreased during attacks if assayed by a method which provides supplemental human C' 4. Immune adherence (I-A) titres were consistently very low in patients with hereditary <b>angioneurotic</b> <b>oedema</b> during clinically evident episodes of oedema or abdominal pain. This finding along with I-A studies in C' 2 deficient sera suggests that C' 4 is the limiting factor in development of the immune adherence reaction in human serum. In addition, I-A provides a simple effective screening test for hereditary <b>angioneurotic</b> <b>oedema</b> during episodes of oedema or abdominal pain...|$|E

40|$|Sera {{from three}} {{patients}} with systemic lupus erythematosus, hereditary <b>angioneurotic</b> <b>oedema</b> and erythema exudativum multiforme, respectively, {{have been investigated}} for total complement (C'), complement components (C' 1, C' 2, C' 3, C' 4), including β 1 C-globulin, as well as inhibitory and enzymatic substances which are capable of inactivating C' components. All three sera had a low total C' activity. The serum from the patient with systemic lupus erythematosus had low levels of C' 4, C' 2 and β 1 C-globulin, and the reduction of total C' could possibly be attributed to an antigen–antibody reaction in vivo. It is known that the low total C' activity and the pronounced lowering of C' 1, C' 4 and C' 2 in serum from patients with hereditary <b>angioneurotic</b> <b>oedema</b> {{is due to the}} enzymatic inactivation of C' 4 and C' 2 by C' 1 esterase. This mechanism has been confirmed in this investigation. Serum from the patient with erythema exudativum multiforme showed only slightly reduced C' 1, C' 2 and C' 3 activities, whereas there was a pronounced reduction of β 1 C-globulin and of C' 4 activity as determined by the classical titration technique. However, C' 4 activity was normal when determined with a stepwise technique. As the patient recovered, the C' components returned to normal levels but the C' 4 titre increased only moderately. Inhibitory or enzymatic substances could not be found in the erythema multiforme serum. The low total C' activity in the erythema multiforme serum, therefore, is unlike that found in the systemic lupus erythematosus serum or the hereditary <b>angioneurotic</b> <b>oedema</b> serum. Obviously, different mechanisms account for the low total C' activities in the sera from these patients...|$|E

40|$|In {{a six-year}} study of 46 {{children}} with familial Mediterranean fever (recurrent hereditary polyserositis), 20 children (43 per cent) developed cutaneous manifestations.

40|$|While {{undergoing}} conscious sedation for a gastroscopy, an 18 -year-old female developed severe hypotension {{and loss}} of consciousness.

Once conscious, the patient complained of severe lower abdominal pain. Except for a signi cant metabolic acidosis (BE = - 10), initial investigations were negative. She was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) where the abdominal pain continued and the urine output was scanty for the rst 12 hours. Investigations were done to exclude: anaphylaxis, mesenteric ischaemia, <b>angioneurotic</b> <b>oedema,</b> pregnancy, porphyria, autoimmune disease and myocardial ischaemia.

Subsequent anaesthetics produced no reactions until four years later, when thiopentone and suxamethonium were given. This reaction was much milder, but C 3 conversion again occurred. Although the clinical signs indicated an anaphylactoid reaction, the laboratory findings suggested that this patient had an underlying immunopathological condition involving complement activation, which could be triggered by any intravenous agent that activated complement.

40|$|The serum of {{patients}} with hereditary <b>angioneurotic</b> <b>oedema</b> contains small amounts of inhibitor of Cl-esterase (Cl-s) which is usually present in appreciable amounts in the serum of healthy individuals.

The generation of Cl-s by alcohol and EDTA was inhibited by addition of natural inhibitor of Cl-s but not by soyabean trypsin inhibitor, trasylol and hexadimethrine bromide. Hexadimethrine bromide did not block the generation when experiments were carried out in silicon coated glassware. Incubation with kaolin and kallikrein generated Cl-s in remission plasma.

40|$|The most {{satisfactory}} {{diagnostic procedure}} for hereditary <b>angioneurotic</b> <b>oedema</b> is {{the demonstration of}} low serum levels of C 1 esterase-inhibitor. A modified method for the assay of this protein is described.

40|$|The mediator(s) {{responsible}} for localized enhanced vascular permeability that characterizes an exacerbation of hereditary <b>angioneurotic</b> <b>oedema</b> (HAE) {{is thought to}} be a product of either contact or complement system activation. In contrast to normal individuals, plasma from these patients generates both kinin and vascular permeability-enhancing activity following incubation at 37 degrees C. Depletion of C 1 inhibitor in both normal and C 2 -deficient plasma, but not in contact factor-deficient plasmas, resulted in generation of these activities. The kinin activity from incubated HAE plasma was susceptible to kininase inactivation and was blocked by a Bk 2 receptor antagonist. Furthermore, this activity was isolated from HAE plasma; amino acid sequence analysis proved it to be bradykinin. Similarly, the vasopermeability-enhancing activity from ethanol-fractionated or boiled HAE plasma, collected during either attack or remission, co-eluted with bradykinin on reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). These studies conclusively demonstrate that bradykinin is the major kinin and mediator of enhanced vascular permeability generated during incubation of HAE plasma. The role of other bioactive products, such as the C 2 kinin, at local sites of oedema formation remains to be further defined...|$|E

The aim of this 20 -day observational prospective study was to evaluate the frequency and type of adverse reaction to antibiotics, and predisposing risk factors in inpatients in six departments of a university hospital (ophthalmology, paediatrics, internal medicine, general surgery, infectious diseases, anaesthesiology and intensive care). The data on all inpatients undergoing antibiotic treatment were collected by physicians trained by our team and validated by an expert panel. Data were recorded on pre-formatted confidential cards (MIO-card). In the 171 inpatients evaluated (125 adults: 39. 5 % male, mean age 61. 6 years, range 21 - 93; and 46 children: 50 % male; mean age 4. 75 years, range 3 months- 12 years), cefazolin (19. 9 %), chloramphenicol (18. 6 %), ceftriaxone (15. 4 %) and netilmicin (12. 9 %) were the most frequently used antibiotics. Adverse events occurred in four adults and three children: one had leucopenia (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole), one nephrotoxicity (netilmicin+teicoplanin) and one nephrotoxicity (cefotaxime), one diarrhoea (ceftriaxone), one neurotoxicity (isoniazid), one <b>angioneurotic</b> <b>oedema</b> (piperacillin) and one skin rashes (ceftriaxone).

30|$|Angioedema {{was first}} {{described}} by J.L. Milton in 1876. First named <b>angioneurotic</b> <b>oedema</b> by Quinckein 1882, {{it is sometimes}} referred to as Quincke’s oedema [1, 2]. There are various causes of angioedema [3]. The incidence of angioedema varies with its causes. For example, the estimated incidence of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-induced angioedema is 0.1 to 1.0  % [4] and that of hereditary angioedema (HAE) ranges from 0.002 to 0.01  % [5]. It is clinically characterised as episodic localised and transient oedematous swelling, most commonly affecting superficial regions such as the face, genitals, and extremities. If angioedema only affected the superficial regions, imaging evaluation would not be necessary. Angioedema, however, may affect any part of the body, and intra-abdominal involvement can even occur without cutaneous involvement [3, 6, 7]. Angioedema can also present with life-threatening respiratory distress when the upper airway is involved [8]. Angioedema involving the gastrointestinal tract may present as an acute abdominal pain resulting in unnecessary laparotomy [2, 9]. Although the diagnosis of angioedema is clinical, awareness of this entity and its characteristic imaging findings by radiologists will aid in raising the suspicion for angioedema, which may warrant further clinical workup and prevent unnecessary surgery. Additionally, for patients with known previous history of angioedema who have abdominal pain, contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis is the study of choice to evaluate for possible visceral involvement as well as to rule out other pathology.|$|E

40|$|P- Phenylenediamine is an {{oxidative}} {{chemical that}} is frequently {{used as a}} permanent hair-coloring agent. It is added to henna to increase the intensity and longevity of the tattoo and expedites its drying time. Henna itself is a greenish brown vegetable coloring made from the leaves of Lawsonia inermis and rarely causes allergic contact dermatitis. The addition of PPD causes the contact sensitization to black henna. Serious adverse skin reactions to permanent hair dyes and temporary black tattoos have been reported. As temporary tattoos have become fashionable among adolescents, the risk profile for p-phenylenediamine (PPD) sensitization {{of the population has}} changed simultaneously with an increasing use of hair dyes in this age group. With increased popularity of body art such as body piercing and tattooing, an increase in temporary henna tattoos has also occurred. Although the appeal of non-permanence exists for henna tattoos, dermatologists have begun to see numerous cases of allergic contact dermatitis linked with a certain type of henna. We selected 50 patients using hair dye and henna for our study. Patch testing was done in all the patients using Indian standard series of antigens.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{concluded}} that after complement activation the final physiologic degradation products of C 3 are C 3 c and the fragment of relative molecular mass (Mr) 42, 000 which contains the C 3 d and C 3 g domains and was therefore named C 3 d,g. Using fluorescent labelled C 3 b as a substrate, we have determined the putative C 3 d,g ('C 3 d,g') producing activity of both normal and hereditary <b>angioneurotic</b> <b>oedema</b> (HANE) plasmas. In normal plasmas, the rate of production of C 3 d,g was 1. 0 +/- 0. 2 X 10 (- 10) mol/ml/h and this activity was blocked by antibodies to I. In contrast, HANE, plasmas (deficient in C 1 INH) showed {{more than twice as}} much 'C 3 d,g' production as normal plasmas and both antibodies to I and kallikrein were required to inhibit this activity. Because of this result, a more sensitive gel system was employed to detect the Mr 42, 000 peptide and two 'C 3 d,g' fragments of approximately equal intensity with Mr of 42, 000 and 43, 000 were defined. Incubation of purified kallikrein with labelled iC 3 b produced a C 3 d,g-like fragment, C 3 d-k, that aligned with the band of 43, 000 Mr generated in HANE plasma. These results indicate that HANE plasma, in contrast to normal plasma, generates the bioactive C 3 d-k fragment. C 1 INH blocks the activities of kallikrein and C 1 s, and C 3 d-k generation in HANE plasma is probably secondary to the proteolytic activity of kallikrein...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{widespread}} use of latex devices has been followed, in the last 25 years, {{by an increase in}} IgE mediated sensitization. The clinical manifestations of latex allergy affect the skin (urticaria and <b>angioneurotic</b> <b>oedema),</b> the lower and the upper respiratory tracts (rhinoconjunctivitis, asthma and glottis oedema), and the cardiovascular system (anaphylaxis). There is also an anaphylactic risk during surgery and invasive diagnostic procedures. Vegetable food cross-reacts with latex so {{that more than half of}} the patients show specific IgE against some food. Further than traditional groups at risk, as health care workers, other work categories have to be protected, because of the inappropriate use of latex gloves (food or drug industry workers, mechanics, panel beaters and so on). Recently the latex most important allergenic fractions have been characterized and recombinant allergens are now available. The recombinant allergens allow a better standardization of the extracts for diagnostic use, the production of safer extracts for immunotherapy as well as a more accurate evaluation of food cross-reactions. The recombinant allergens will allow a more accurate dosage of latex concentrations in air and in objects and, in future, to establish threshold limit values. The main aims of prevention are the replacement of latex with alternative elastomers, the reduction of work and extra work exposure and an efficient health survey in working environment. The use of latex gloves and devices among general population has to be discouraged. Specific immunotherapy has to be considered a second choice and restricted to highly qualified workers in order to realize a rehabilitation to their previous jobs. The actually obtained protection must be verified...|$|E
