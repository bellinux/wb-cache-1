5|$|Gout affects around 1–2% of the Western {{population}} {{at some point}} in their lifetimes and is becoming more common. Some 5.8 million people were affected in 2013. Rates of gout approximately doubled between 1990 and 2010. This rise is believed to be due to increasing life expectancy, changes in diet and an increase in diseases associated with gout, such as metabolic syndrome <b>and</b> <b>high</b> <b>blood</b> pressure. Factors that influence rates of gout, include age, race and the season of the year. In men over 30 and women over 50, rates are 2%.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, Djajakusuma {{joined the}} National Film Corporation (Perfini) at the {{invitation}} of Usmar Ismail. After making his directorial debut with Embun, Djajakusuma released a further eleven films with the company before leaving in 1964. He then returned to traditional Indonesian theatre, including wayang. Although he continued to direct movies independently of Perfini, most of his energies were dedicated to promoting traditional art forms and teaching cinematography. After over a decade of poor health <b>and</b> <b>high</b> <b>blood</b> pressure, Djajakusuma collapsed during a ceremony and died. He was buried in Karet Bivak Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|When {{given for}} short periods, {{linezolid}} {{is a relatively}} safe antibiotic. It {{can be used in}} people of all ages and in people with liver disease or poor kidney function. Common side effects with short-term use include headache, diarrhea, rash, and nausea. Serious side effects may include serotonin syndrome, bone marrow suppression, <b>and</b> <b>high</b> <b>blood</b> lactate levels, particularly when used for more than two weeks. If used for longer periods still, it may cause sometimes irreversible nerve damage including optic nerve damage.|$|E

5|$|Nasser {{engaged in}} chain smoking. He {{maintained}} 18-hour workdays and rarely took {{time off for}} vacations. The combination of smoking and working long hours contributed to his poor health. He was diagnosed with diabetes in the early 1960s {{and by the time}} of his death in 1970, he also had arteriosclerosis, heart disease, <b>and</b> <b>high</b> <b>blood</b> pressure. He suffered two major heart attacks (in 1966 and 1969), and was on bed rest for six weeks after the second episode. State media reported that Nasser's absence from the public view at that time was a result of influenza.|$|E
5|$|Obesity hypoventilation {{syndrome}} (also {{known as}} Pickwickian syndrome) {{is a condition}} in which severely overweight people fail to breathe rapidly enough or deeply enough, resulting in low blood oxygen levels <b>and</b> <b>high</b> <b>blood</b> carbon dioxide (CO2) levels. Many people with this condition also frequently stop breathing altogether for short periods of time during sleep (obstructive sleep apnea), resulting in many partial awakenings during the night, which leads to continual sleepiness during the day. The disease puts strain on the heart, which eventually may lead to the symptoms such as heart failure, leg swelling and various other related symptoms. The most effective treatment is weight loss, but it is often possible to relieve the symptoms by nocturnal ventilation with positive airway pressure (CPAP) or related methods.|$|E
5|$|Of the 40% of {{patients}} who develop kidney involvement, almost all have evidence (visible or on urinalysis) {{of blood in the}} urine. More than half also have proteinuria (protein in the urine), which in one eighth is severe enough to cause nephrotic syndrome (generalised swelling due to low protein content of the blood). While abnormalities on urinalysis may continue for a long time, only 1% of all HSP patients develop chronic kidney disease. Hypertension (high blood pressure) may occur. Protein loss <b>and</b> <b>high</b> <b>blood</b> pressure, as well as the features on biopsy of the kidney if performed, may predict progression to advanced kidney disease. Adults are more likely than children to develop advanced kidney disease.|$|E

5|$|In adults, {{occupational}} exposure {{is the main}} cause of lead poisoning. People can be exposed when working in facilities that produce a variety of lead-containing products; these include radiation shields, ammunition, certain surgical equipment, developing dental x-ray films prior to digital x-rays (each film packet had a lead liner to prevent the radiation from going through), fetal monitors, plumbing, circuit boards, jet engines, and ceramic glazes. In addition, lead miners and smelters, plumbers and fitters, auto mechanics, glass manufacturers, construction workers, battery manufacturers and recyclers, firing range instructors, and plastic manufacturers are at risk for lead exposure. Other occupations that present lead exposure risks include welding, manufacture of rubber, printing, zinc and copper smelting, processing of ore, combustion of solid waste, and production of paints and pigments. Parents who are exposed to lead in the workplace can bring lead dust home on clothes or skin and expose their children. Occupational exposure to lead increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, in particular: stroke, <b>and</b> <b>high</b> <b>blood</b> pressure.|$|E

40|$|Rationale: A {{recent study}} {{has shown that}} severe adult-onset asthma is a {{distinct}} clinical phenotype, characterized by absence of atopy, nasal polyposis, higher FeNO, persistent eosinophilic airway inflammation <b>and</b> <b>higher</b> <b>blood</b> neutrophil counts [Amelink et al, JACI 2013]. The aim {{of the present study}} was to assess the prevalence and phenotypic characteristics of adult-onset disease amongst patients with severe asthma. Methods: This was a cross-sectional analysis of the U-BIOPRED severe asthma cohort. Patients were recruited from tertiary pulmonary outpatient clinics. Asthma diagnosis was confirmed by a history of typical symptoms and one of the following criteria: reversibility in FEV 1 of >= 12 % and 200 ml after 400 mcg inhaled salbutamol OR airway hyper-responsiveness (PC 20 18 years) or as severe childhood-onset asthma. (Ex) smokers (143 patients, 37. 1 %) were included. Clinical and functional characteristics and inflammatory markers were collected and independent T-test, Mann Whitney U test and Chi-square test were used for group comparisons. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to determine factors associated with severe adult-onset asthma. Results: 216 out of 385 (56. 1 %) patients with severe asthma had adult-onset disease. Compared with patients with severe childhood-onset asthma, patients with severe adult-onset asthma had higher prevalence of male gender (43 % vs 30 %, p= 0. 01), were heavier smokers (8. 3 (0 - 108) vs 2. 9 (0 - 67. 5) pack-years, p< 0. 001), had higher FeNO levels (geometric-mean±gsd 29 ± 2. 3 vs 23 ± 2. 1 ppb, p = 0. 018), higher rate of positive reversibility test (20 ± 19. 2 vs 15 %± 14. 8, p= 0. 02), <b>and</b> <b>higher</b> <b>blood</b> <b>and</b> sputum eosinophil counts (geometric-mean±gsd 3. 27 %± 0. 04 vs 2. 11 %± 0. 98, p< 0. 001; 14 % (0 - 74. 15) vs 6. 4 % (0 - 58. 0), p< 0. 001). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that a higher number of pack-years <b>and</b> <b>higher</b> <b>blood</b> eosinophil counts were independently associated with adult-onset of the disease (Table 1). Conclusions: These results show that more than half of patients with severe asthma in tertiary care have adult-onset asthma. A higher number of pack-years <b>and</b> <b>higher</b> <b>blood</b> <b>and</b> sputum eosinophil counts are independently associated with severe adult-onset asthma. This suggests a distinct phenotype, characterized by eosinophilia and/or positive smoking history...|$|R
5000|$|The {{cause of}} the {{cardiovascular}} problems became, and remains, a subject of intensive research. [...] As of 2012 results have been converging on {{the hypothesis that the}} adverse cardiovascular effects are most likely due to inhibition of COX-2 in blood vessels, which leads to a decrease in the production of prostacyclin in them. Prostacyclin usually prevents platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction, so its inhibition can lead to excess clot formation <b>and</b> <b>higher</b> <b>blood</b> pressure.|$|R
