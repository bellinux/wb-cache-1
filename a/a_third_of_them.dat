40|$|Coproducts, such as Distillers Dried Grains with Solubles (DDGS), {{produced}} during ethanol production {{are essential to}} the economic sustainability of each ethanol plant as they provide an additional source of revenue. DDGS is extensively used as animal feed, but has a relatively low market value compared to the biofuel. By fractioning DDGS into lighter and heavier fractions, the overall composition changes potentially increasing the value of the coproducts as they become more desirable to different markets. Earlier studies have examined fractionating DDGS using sieves and aspirators. This project examined the techno-economics of adding fractionation systems onto an existing 40 million gal/y ethanol plant. The model allowed for estimations of fixed capital costs, annual operating costs, annual revenues, and net profits, {{in order to determine the}} economic feasibility of adding three different fractionation systems.

Most other mammals have a muscle mass that makes up 40 to 45 {{percent of the total}} body weight. They usually move at an average speed of 4 m (10 ft) per minute, but can move at a marginally higher speed of 4.5 m (15 ft), if they are in immediate danger from a predator.

While they sometimes sit on top of branches, they usually eat, sleep, and even give birth hanging from branches. They sometimes remain hanging from branches even after death. On the ground, the maximum speed of sloths is 3m (10ft) per minute. Sloths are surprisingly strong swimmers and can reach speeds of 13.5 m (45 ft) per minute.

Adults are placed in larger pine boxes placed according to size and are stacked three coffins high and two coffins across. Burial records on microfilm at the Municipal Archives in Manhattan indicate that babies and adults were buried together in mass graves up until 1913 when the trenches became separate {{in order to facilitate}} the more common disinterment of adults.

40|$|BACKGROUND: A data {{acquisition}} {{from the medical}} sector may give one important view of {{the burden on the}} society caused by vehicle related injuries. The official police-reported statistics may only reflect a part of all vehicle-related injured seeking medical attention. The aim is to provide a comprehensive picture of the burden of vehicle related injuries on the medical sector (2013), and to compare with official police-reported statistics and the development year 2000 - 2013. METHODS: The data set includes 1085 injured from the Injury Data Base at Umeå University Hospital's catchment area with 148, 500 inhabitants in 2013. RESULTS: Bicyclists were the most frequently injured (54 %). One-third had non-minor (MAIS 2 +) injuries, and bicyclists accounted for 58 % of the 1071 hospital bed days for all vehicle-related injuries. Car occupants represented 23 % of all injured, and only 9 % had MAIS 2 + injuries. They accounted for 17 % of the hospital bed days. Motorized two wheel vehicle riders represented 11 % of the injured and 39 % had MAIS 2 + injuries and they occupied 11 % of the hospital bed days. Of the 1085 medically treated persons, 767 were injured in public traffic areas, and, therefore, {{should be included in the}} official police statistics; however, only <b>a</b> <b>third</b> (232) <b>of</b> <b>them</b> were reported by the police. The annual injury rate had not changed during 2000 - 2013 for bicyclists, motor-cycle riders, pedestrians or snowmobile riders. However, for passenger car occupants a decrease was observed after 2008, and for mopedists the injury rate was halved after 2009 when a licensing regulation was introduced. CONCLUSION: The Swedish traffic injury reducing strategy Vision Zero, may have contributed to the reduction of injured car occupants and moped riders. The official police-reported statistics was a biased data source for vehicle related injuries and the total number medically treated was in total five times higher. Bicyclists caused the heaviest burden on the medical sector; consequently, they need to be prioritized in future safety work, as recently declared in the Government plan Vision Zero 2. 0...|$|R

When he found that his inquiry in this respect was unsuccessful, he was willing to turn the conversation. In reply to the Duchess, then, he generally described the talk of the stranger as full of lively anecdote and epigrammatic views of life; and gave them, for example, a saying of an illustrious foreign Prince, which was quite new and pointed, and which Coningsby told well.

40|$|Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections are {{the manifestation}} of solar {{transient}} eruptions, which can significantly modify the plasma and magnetic conditions in the heliosphere. They are often preceded by a shock, and a magnetic flux rope is detected in situ in <b>a</b> <b>third</b> to half <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> The main {{aim of this study}} is to obtain the best quantitative shape for the flux rope axis and for the shock surface from in situ data obtained during spacecraft crossings of these structures. We first compare the orientation of the flux ropes axes and shock normals obtained from independent data analyses of the same events, observed in situ at 1 AU from the Sun. Then, we carry out an original statistical analysis of axes/shock normals by deriving the statistical distributions of their orientations. We fit the observed distributions using the distributions derived from several synthetic models describing these shapes. We show that the distributions of axis/shock orientations are very sensitive to their respective shape. One classical model, used to analyze interplanetary imager data, is incompatible with the in situ data. Two other models are introduced, for which the results for axis and shock normals lead to very similar shapes; the fact that the data for MCs and shocks are independent strengthen this result. The model which best fit all the data sets has an ellipsoidal shape with similar aspect ratio values for all the data sets. These derived shapes for the flux rope axis and shock surface have several potential applications. First, these shapes can be used to construct a consistent ICME model. Second, these generic shapes can be used to develop a quantitative model to analyze imager data, as well as constraining the output of numerical simulations of ICMEs. Finally, they will have implications for space weather forecasting, in particular for forecasting the time arrival of ICMEs at the Earth.
