5|$|In 1954, at {{a psychic}} event in California, Ruth was {{introduced}} to Ernest Norman, who told her that in a past life {{she had been the}} daughter of an Egyptian Pharaoh and had protected Moses. Members of the organization they later established, the Unarius Academy of Science, <b>affirm</b> <b>that</b> Ernest and Ruth married on the day they met, and the group celebrates their anniversary as February14, 1954. However, Diana Tumminia of California State University, Sacramento, notes in her 2005 study of the group that Ruth was probably still married to George Marian in early 1954 and speculates that their divorce was a lengthy process; Tumminia posits that Ernest and Ruth married in 1956.|$|E

25|$|The Reformed churches {{emphasize}} the , or sacramental presence, of Christ, {{saying that the}} sacrament {{is a means of}} saving grace through which only the elect believer actually partakes of Christ, but merely with the bread and wine rather than in the elements. Calvinists deny the Lutheran assertion that all communicants, both believers and unbelievers, orally receive Christ's body and blood in the elements of the sacrament but instead <b>affirm</b> <b>that</b> Christ is united to the believer through faith—toward which the supper is an outward and visible aid.

25|$|Next to {{the study}} of the Scriptures which I earnestly inculcate, I exhort my pupils to peruse Calvin’s Commentaries, which I extol in loftier terms than Helmich himself (a Dutch divine, 15511608); for I <b>affirm</b> <b>that</b> he excels beyond {{comparison}} in the interpretation of Scripture, and that his commentaries ought to be more highly valued than all that is handed down to us by the library of the fathers; so that I acknowledge him to have possessed above most others, or rather above all other men, what may be called an eminent spirit of prophecy. His Institutes ought to be studied after the (Heidelberg) Catechism, as containing a fuller explanation, but with discrimination, like the writings of all men.|$|E
25|$|The proper policy, in my view, {{should be}} to affirm the status of physician-assisted suicide and {{euthanasia}} as illegal. In so doing we would <b>affirm</b> <b>that</b> as a society we condemn ending a patient's life and do not consider that to have one's life ended by a doctor is a right. This does not mean we deny that in exceptional cases interventions are appropriate, as acts of desperation when all other elements of treatment—all medications, surgical procedures, psychotherapy, spiritual care, and so on—have been tried. Physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia should not be performed simply because a patient is depressed, tired of life, worried about being a burden, or worried about being dependent. All these may be signs that not every effort has yet been made.|$|E
