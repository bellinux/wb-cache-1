5|$|Delaney had {{a lifelong}} history of helping others, and once {{paid for the}} funeral of a former teacher whose family could not afford a proper service. On June 29, 1983, Delaney, who was living in nearby Ruston, went with friends to Critter's Creek, an {{amusement}} center at Chennault Park in Monroe, Louisiana. While reportedly discouraging swimming children from venturing too far out in a pond, Delaney dove in to save three children who were screaming for help, floundering in a water hole left by recent construction work. The water hole, which covered two acres and was six feet deep, was not intended for swimming but {{to add to the}} park's aesthetics. Despite his inability to swim, Delaney nevertheless tried to rescue the children. One child managed {{to get out of the}} water without harm and another was taken to <b>an</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>room</b> where he later died; police recovered the body of Delaney and the remaining child. The amusement park has since been closed to the public.|$|E

25|$|In 2008 and 2010, {{much more}} {{substantive}} {{changes were made}} to the law, {{one of the most important}} of which was to begin an open enrollment period for those receiving subsidized health insurance and anyone buying insurance, including those paying full price, as an individual. Prior to that 2010 change, under the Massachusetts law, residents buying healthcare insurance individually could do so at any time, evenâ€”theoreticallyâ€”as being admitted to a hospital or entering <b>an</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>room.</b> This led to a gaming of the system and research by the state said this gaming added 1%-2% to premium costs, which were continuing to rise for other reasons as well. Given the continuing overall rise in premiums post Massachusetts 2006 healthcare insurance reform, the major goal of the 2012 amendment was to introduce price controls on health care itself; it is not directly related to healthcare insurance as are the earlier legislative actions.|$|E

25|$|Atwater and her husband, Michael Haas, <b>an</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>room</b> {{physician}} {{at a local}} hospital, filed suit under 42 U.S.C. Â§ 1983, represented by Charles Lincoln, alleging that the city violated her Fourth Amendment right {{to be free from}} unreasonable seizures by arresting her for a crime whose only punishment was a fine. This argument required her to concede that the police had probable cause to arrest her for violating the seat belt law, and thus the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas found summary judgment for the city. A panel of the Fifth Circuit reversed, holding that arresting a person for a fine-only misdemeanor was per se unreasonable. The Fifth Circuit sitting en banc reversed the panel, agreeing with the district court's reasoning. Three judges dissented from the en banc panel's ruling, arguing that the police had to have a specific reason for arresting Atwater for only violating the seat belt law. The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear the case.|$|E
