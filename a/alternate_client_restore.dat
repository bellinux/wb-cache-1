50|$|This {{style is}} similar to the Synthetic backup concept. After an initial full backup, only the {{incremental}} backups are sent to a centralized backup system. This server keeps track of all the incrementals and sends the proper data back to the <b>client</b> during <b>restores.</b> This can be implemented by sending each incremental directly to tape as it is taken and then refactoring the tapes as necessary. If enough disk space is available, an online mirror can be maintained along with previous incremental changes so that the current or older versions of the systems being backed up can be restored. This is a suitable method in the case of banking systems.|$|R

40|$|OF THE DISSERTATION Optimal {{buffering}} algorithms for client-server VBR video retrievals by Junbiao Zhang Dissertation Director: Prof. Joseph Y. Hui, Prof. Naftaly Minsky Variable bit rate(VBR) videos {{refer to}} videos with varying frame sizes. When transmitted through networks in a client-server environment, their corresponding traffic is inherently bursty {{because of the}} embedded timing constraints in digital videos. In reservation based networks like ATM network, such traffic may result in considerable network under-utilization if the network has to accommodate the peak bit rate. Traffic smoothing is thus necessary to reduce the burstiness in the VBR video traffic {{and it can be}} very effective in the case of stored video. By introducing a playback delay and buffering video data on the client side, a smoother traffic can be transmitted by the server. In order for the <b>client</b> to <b>restore</b> the original timing information in the video, it is important to avoid buffer overflow or underflow durin [...] ...|$|R

The Tayy are mentioned in the late 5th century as having raided numerous villages in the plains and mountains of the Syrian Desert, including parts of Byzantine territory. This prompted the Byzantine army to mobilize its Arab clients at the desert frontiers with Sassanid-held Mesopotamia to confront the Tayy. The Byzantines demanded restitution from the Tayy, but the Sassanid general Qardag Nakoragan instead opened negotiations that called for the Byzantines' Arab <b>clients</b> to <b>restore</b> livestock and captives taken from Sassanid territory in previous years in return for compensation from the Tayy. The negotiations succeeded, and moreover, the Sassanids and Byzantines delineated their borders to prevent future raiding between their respective Arab clients. However, to the embarrassment of the Sassanids and the outrage of the Byzantines, four hundred Tayyid tribesmen raided several minor villages in Byzantine territory while representatives of the two sides were meeting in Nisibis.

Other practitioners, especially those who work for forensic consultants or firms specializing in disaster response and repair, are more familiar with the variety and extent of building failures as they assist their <b>clients</b> in <b>restoring</b> damaged or deficient buildings. The advent of social medial and twenty-four-hour news channels along with the general ease of finding more examples of failures in the Internet have made us realize that building failures in the broad sense are much more common than we may have realized. Relatively recent events leading to building failures such as the Christchurch, New Zealand earthquakes, the roof/parking deck of the Algo Centre mall in the northern Ontario, Canada city of Elliot Lake and the Indiana State Fairground stage collapse in the US are just a few reminders that much more work needs to be done on a variety of fronts to prevent building failures from a life safety standpoint. The need is compounded by economic concerns from what would be considered more mundane or common failures.

Although scientific approval of this therapy is lacking, commercial neurofeedback clinics are proliferating across Europe and the United States. In this article, ethnographic material gathered through interviews with practitioners and clients and observations during neurofeedback sessions provides the groundwork for a theoretical analysis of neurofeedback. This account demonstrates that although at first glance neurofeedback appears as a straightforward engagement between the two agents - practitioner and client - and a computer, it is in fact a complex entanglement of collaborating and competing actors. Human and non-human actors together perform a process in which it is unclear which actor is directing the 'treatment'. While it remains unclear if and how the <b>client</b> is cured, <b>restored</b> or enhanced, this article demonstrates that through the process of neurofeedback, a new kind of self - one that is extended with all kind of entities that have emerged during the process - has clearly been brought into being. ...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1971 Purpose The {{study was}} {{designed}} to test the effectiveness of a counselor training experience which used pre-recorded client statements as the instructional medium. The principal objective of instruction was to teach counselor trainees to differentiate between the affective and cognitive content of client statements and to respond in ways which would continue to ellicit affective responses by the client. Procedure Twenty-eight graduate students enrolled in a counseling practicum at Oregon State University were selected for the study. Subjects were randomly assigned to an experimental and control group of equal size. The experimental group received two hours of individual instruction interacting with the tape-recorded client statements and the control group engaged in two hours of role-playing counseling interviews, <b>alternating</b> between <b>client</b> and counselor roles. The training tape-recordings were developed specifically for the project. Subjects of both groups participated in a test prior to and following the training sequence. The test consisted of a live structured interview with a role-playing client. All test interviews were recorded and transposed into typescripts. An analysis of each typescript was carried out using a matrix format developed for the study. Counselor-client interactions were classified with respect to degree of lead and their affective-cognitive content. A ratio of acceptable responses made by the subject to all responses made by him was used as a basis for evaluation of performance. Results Several statistical techniques were employed in treatment of the data. Statistical analysis revealed that (1) the experimental subjects gained significantly in the performance criterion from pre- to post-training, (2) the control subjects showed no significant gain, (3) the experimental subjects demonstrated a significant gain in the performance criterion over the control subjects, and (4) controlling for pre-training performance, the experimental and control subjects differed significantly in post-training performance. These results suggested that the experimental subjects enhanced their use of specific verbal communication skills as a result of training in the simulated interview setting...|$|R

40|$|This {{exploratory}} study examined outcomes of single telephone counselling calls, with a self-selected sample of 38 clients {{from a family}} counselling agency. The sample was interviewed by telephone at two days and six weeks after the call to assess crisis counselling outcomes in affect, identification {{of the problem and}} action taken, and client equilibrium. Repeated measures of the 'perceptual concordance' of counsellor and client were taken over a period of six weeks, assessing levels of concordance between client and counsellor about perceptions of counselling, and client equilibrium. The sufficiency of a single counselling session was also assessed. 'Perceptual concordance' was suggested by reduced client stress, high levels of agreement between client and counsellor in the identification of the problem and agreed action, and satisfaction with the counselling. Positive indicators of <b>restored</b> <b>client</b> equilibrium included a maintenance of lower stress levels, changes in behaviour, improvement in perceptions of the seriousness of the problem, satisfaction with life and with the counselling. Further research of equilibrium as a concept, and an indicator of crisis resolution is warranted. The sufficiency of a single session of counselling was supported by 56 % of clients. The variety of services used by clients as an outcome of the counselling suggests that it could be beneficial for telephone counselling agencies to offer a follow-up call. Verifying the agreed action and assessing equilibrium could be useful indicators of effective telephone counselling...|$|R
40|$|Pancreatic {{cancer is}} almost always fatal, {{in part because of}} its delayed diagnosis, poor prognosis, rapid {{progression}} and chemoresistance. Oncogenic proteins are stabilized by the Hsp 90, making it a potential therapeutic target. We investigated the oxidative stress-mediated dysfunction of Hsp 90 and the hindrance of its chaperonic activity by a carbazole alkaloid,mahanine, as a strategic therapeutic in pancreatic cancer. Mahanine exhibited antiproliferative activity against several pancreatic cancer cell lines through apoptosis. It induced early accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) leading to thiol oxidation, aggregation and dysfunction of Hsp 90 in MIAPaCa- 2. N-acetyl-L-cysteine prevented mahanine-induced ROS accumulation, aggregation of Hsp 90, degradation of client proteins and cell death. Mahanine disrupted Hsp 90 -Cdc 37 complex in MIAPaCa- 2 as a consequence of ROS generation. <b>Client</b> proteins were <b>restored</b> by MG 132, suggesting a possible role of ubiquitinylated protein degradation pathway. Surface plasmon resonance study demonstrated that the rate of interaction of mahanine with recombinant Hsp 90 is in the range of seconds. Molecular dynamics simulation showed its weak interactions with Hsp 90. However, no disruption of the Hsp 90 -Cdc 37 complex was observed at an early time point, thus ruling out that mahanine directly disrupts the complex. It did not impede the ATP binding pocket of Hsp 90. Mahanine also reduced in vitro migration and tube formation in cancer cells. Further, it inhibited orthotopic pancreatic tumor growth in nude mice. Taken together, these results provide evidence for mahanine-induced ROS-mediated destabilization of Hsp 90 chaperone activity resulting in Hsp 90 -Cdc 37 disruption leading to apoptosis, suggesting its potential as a specific target in pancreatic cancer. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{benefits}} {{provided by}} cloud computing {{and the space}} savings offered by data deduplication make it attractive to host data storage services like backup in the cloud. Data deduplication relies on comparing fingerprints of data chunks, and store them in the chunk index, to identify and remove redundant data, with an ultimate goal of saving storage space and network bandwidth. However, the chunk index presents a bottleneck to the throughput of the backup operation. While several solutions to address deduplication throughput have been proposed, the chunk index is still a centralized resource and limits the scalability of both storage capacity and backup throughput in public cloud environments. In addressing this challenge, we propose the Scalable Hybrid Hash Cluster (SHHC) that hosts a low-latency distributed hash table for storing fingerprints. SHHC is a cluster of nodes designed to scale and handle numerous concurrent backup requests while maintaining high fingerprint lookup throughput. Each node in the cluster features hybrid memory consisting of DRAM and Solid State Drives (SSDs) to present a large usable memory for storing the chunk index. Our evaluation with real-world workloads shows that SHHC is consistently scalable {{as the number of}} nodes increases. The throughput increases almost linearly with the number of nodes. The restore performance over the relatively low bandwidth wide area network (WAN) links is another drawback in the use of cloud backup services. High speed network connectivity is either too expensive for most organizations or reserved for special applications. Removing redundant data before transmitting over the WAN offers a viable option to improve network throughput during the restore operation. To that end, we propose Application-Aware Phased Restore (AAPR), a simple restore solution for deduplication-based cloud backup <b>clients.</b> AAPR improves <b>restore</b> time by removing redundant data before transmitting over the WAN. Furthermore, we exploit application awareness to restore critical data first and thus improve the recovery time. Our evaluations show that, for workloads with high redundancy, AAPR reduces restore time by over 85 %. Advisor: Hong Jian...|$|R
