5|$|The {{asteroid}} belt {{may also be}} divided into the inner <b>and</b> <b>outer</b> belts, with the inner belt formed by asteroids orbiting nearer to Mars than the 3:1 Kirkwood gap (2.5AU), and the outer belt formed by those asteroids closer to Jupiter's orbit. (Some authors subdivide the inner <b>and</b> <b>outer</b> belts at the 2:1 resonance gap (3.3 AU), whereas others suggest inner, middle, <b>and</b> <b>outer</b> belts; also see diagram).|$|E
5|$|Type II (excision) is the {{complete}} or partial {{removal of the}} inner labia, with or without removal of the clitoral glans <b>and</b> <b>outer</b> labia. Type IIa is removal of the inner labia; Type IIb, removal of the clitoral glans and inner labia; and Type IIc, removal of the clitoral glans, inner <b>and</b> <b>outer</b> labia. Excision in French can refer to any form of FGM.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter's {{magnetosphere}} {{is traditionally}} {{divided into three}} parts: the inner, middle <b>and</b> <b>outer</b> magnetosphere. The inner magnetosphere is located at distances closer than 10RJ from the planet. The magnetic field within it remains approximately dipole, because contributions from the currents flowing in the magnetospheric equatorial plasma sheet are small. In the middle (between 10 and 40RJ) <b>and</b> <b>outer</b> (further than 40RJ) magnetospheres, the magnetic field is not a dipole, and is seriously disturbed by its interaction with the plasma sheet (see magnetodisk below).|$|E

5|$|The asci {{are long}} and cylindrical, and taper into a short stem-like base; they measure 300–375 by 14–16µm.
