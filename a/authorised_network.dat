2500|$|Around {{the end of}} 1901 two {{different}} companies proposed to build electric tramways to link Torquay and Paignton. These schemes failed to get started, but in 1902 the Dolter Electric Company was invited build a line instead that would use their stud-contact system of electrification. A poll was conducted of the ratepayers of Torquay; a small majority was in favour of a tramway being built {{but not for the}} council to either build or operate it. An Act of Parliament was passed on 15 August 1904, <b>authorising</b> a <b>network</b> of [...] gauge tracks and the Dolter power supply.|$|R
50|$|For the {{businessmen}} {{participating in}} the Ostbahn the continuation of historical trade links across the borders to Austria and Bohemia, albeit using the faster railways, was extremely important. As a result, the first link to the Austrian railway network was made as early as 1 September 1861 at Passau via a junction with the Empress Elisabeth Railway. In the same year a connexion with the Bohemian Western Railway to Pilsen followed. This line ran from Schwandorf via Cham (reached on 7 January) and Furth im Wald (20 September) to the border (15 October). Inside five years 446 kilometres of track had been built for the railway <b>network</b> <b>authorised</b> in the first concession of 1856.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a Wireless Security Model (WSM) {{to the security}} risks caused by the leakage of electromagnetic radio waves in wireless networks. The WSM {{is divided into two}} parts. The first part uses a robust security strategy model which enables the Information Security management of the WSM to be continuously improved. The context here is continual improvement of the WSM and takes into consideration those factors both internal and external to the WSM that affects its behaviour. The second part of the WSM uses the geographic limitation inherent in location based services to contain the access of an <b>authorised</b> wireless <b>network</b> user within a predefined parameter. The context here is access based on geographic limitation and takes into consideration the exact position of a mobile device using indoor positioning technology on a single radio frequency to obtain network access. The security strategy model uses the International Standard Organisations (ISO), Information Security Management Systems (ISMS) requirements (27001 : 2005) and Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) Version 3 as a governance framework which makes it suitable for use in any organisation of the 162 member countries who have signed up to and adopted the ISO 27001 : 2005. The positioning technology uses a Wireless Location Appliance (WLA) to identify the location of a mobile device before allowing it to access the network, it then continues to monitor the location at time intervals which are preset using the WLA and then maintains the connection to the network for the duration that the mobile device complies with the preset rules based on its location and any other of the organisations internal information security policies. The security strategy model was evaluated using a questionnaire to collect data from Small Medium Enterprises (SME) which use wireless networks to understand the kind of infrastructure they use and the kind of information security policies they have in place to protect them. The results were compared with surveys undertaken by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) on behalf of the United Kingdom's Government office of Commerce (GOC) which produced the ISO 27001 : 2005 and ITIL V 3 documents. The positioning technology was experimentally evaluated using a laboratory owned by a company that provides Location Based Services to the National Health Service (NHS). The results were compared with a predetermined route marked out on the architectural plan of a room in the laboratories building which was used as a test bed. The security solution model achieved 95...|$|R
