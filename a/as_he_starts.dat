500|$|Rebecca Silverman from Anime News Network praised Alphonse's {{development}} in the manga, especially where he refuses to recover his weakened body and instead helps his friends. As a result, Silverman brought a comparison between the two brothers and wondered whether Edward {{would have done the}} same. Chris Beveridge found the character's growth in Conqueror in Shamballa appealing <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>starts</b> visually resembling Edward. When reviewing the video game Fullmetal Alchemist and the Broken Angel, RPGFan's Neal Chandran enjoyed the dynamic between the main characters both in fights as well as dialogues. After Aaron Dismuke's voice matured, Anime News Network writer Justin Sevakis criticized him for his part in the Fullmetal Alchemist: Premium OVA Collection, writing that [...] "he simply no longer sounds like Alphonse".|$|E

500|$|Other critics found {{a variety}} of Judeo-Christian analogies. Devils Tower {{parallels}} Mount Sinai, the aliens as God and Roy Neary as Moses. Cecil B. DeMille's The Ten Commandments is seen on television at the Neary household. Some found close relations between Elijah and Roy; Elijah was taken into a [...] "chariot of fire", akin to Roy going in the UFO. Climbing Devils Tower behind the faltering Jillian, Neary exhorts Jillian to keep moving and not to look back, similar to Lot's wife who looked back at Sodom {{and turned into a}} pillar of salt.

One day, Peter comes home to find that Lois has thrown the Red Bull out in an attempt to make Peter give up his new addiction. This angers Peter, who in retaliation, attempts to make his own. Because of a misreading, Peter decides to put kerosene in his beverage believing that fuel causes the effect Red Bull has on him. [...] Brian tries to warn Peter that kerosene is dangerous, but Peter ignores him and adds it anyway, causing him to collapse on the floor.|$|E
500|$|Connor {{undergoes}} {{dramatic changes}} in season five. Very much an opposite to his earlier persona, the only features common with his previous self are his protectiveness of loved ones, attraction to older women, and later his fighting prowess. Otherwise he's a prosperous, sweet young man, due to his fake memories of a happy childhood. Jeffrey Bell wanted to highlight Connor's [...] "well-adjusted" [...] mentality for this season. Vincent calls him a [...] "happy" [...] person and liked playing this version more {{because he has been}} playing the [...] "brooding" [...] version {{for a year and a}} half year. The comic book Connor develops in the same direction <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>starts</b> emerging a hero still keeping his pleasant personality. Joss Whedon characterizes the comic book Connor as [...] "the closest thing to a superhero hell has' because he has powers without any of the weaknesses of the vampire, and is well adjusted. Brain considers him [...] "one of the coolest characters in any series or comics".|$|E

500|$|The game {{follows a}} {{cyclical}} narrative structure {{in which the}} protagonist and his descendants individually explore a castle in a quest to battle the primary antagonist, the immortal God King. In the game's introduction, the non-playable protagonist has just finished this quest, but is slain by the God King. The player then assumes {{the role of the}} dead protagonist's descendant <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>starts</b> his own journey {{at the beginning of the}} castle. This cycle, called a bloodline, continues after the player finally faces the God King and either dies or wins. The player may also choose to join the God King and terminate the cycle; upon doing so, the game resumes at the checkpoint before fighting the God King. Enemy difficulty increases with each bloodline cycle. Another bloodline ending is unlocked after purchasing the Infinite Blade item: the sword is placed into a pedestal in the castle's underground dungeons and three doors open. After then defeating each of the three [...] "Deathless"—immortal beings like the God King—of increasing difficulty found within, a final fourth door opens and the player faces a mechanized warrior guarding the high-tech chamber where the God King is reborn whenever he is killed. Upon defeating the mechanized warrior, the chamber is revealed to be controlled by an ancestor of the player character, who chose to serve the God King. After fighting the ancestor, the player character is told that the Infinity Blade has the ability to prevent immortals like the God King from resurrecting after death. The player is then given the option of either starting the next bloodline as they do when defeated, or resetting the game and starting New Game+ mode, which resets all gold and item progression but maintains the character's experience level, letting the player remaster the items and level up even further.|$|E
500|$|Webb {{stated that}} he and the crew wanted to keep the stunts more {{grounded}} physically, a challenge for a superhuman character. The stunt performers included the Armstrong family, Vic and Andy, along with Richard Norton who plays a SWAT team member. Andy Armstrong was the stunt coordinator while Vic was the second unit director. To determine how Spider-Man should swing, Andy videotaped an Olympic Games gymnast swinging on a horizontal bar. Andy noted that in the computer-generated swing in the earlier Spider-Man films, [...] "he swings down at the same speed as he swings up," [...] and this [...] "constant" [...] speed is unlike a real gymnast's movement where [...] "he's accelerating until he reaches the bottom, then <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>starts</b> to come up, he's decelerating until he gets to the top of his swing and he actually gets negative gravity, where he'll go weightless for a second, and then the next swing starts, and it becomes another violent swing again." [...] Vic felt that Spider-Man's moves were comparable to those of Tarzan, and he wanted to add that in the film. While filming in New York City, they swung a man through traffic down the street. Then, while the crew built a rig hundreds of feet long over Riverside Drive in Harlem, Andy built a car rig with a series of wires to help with effects which Webb said required an [...] "incredible wealth of acrobatics". These rigs were over 200–300 feet long and demanded months of rehearsals and design. According to Andy, operating the rigs [...] "was a combination of a lot of human skills and mechanical engineering." [...] The purpose of the rigs was to depict Spider-Man's swing in a way that wasn't computer-generated. Garfield was reported to be involved with some of the stunts. Leaked pictures reveal Garfield with a nosebleed that reports claimed was from swinging. Arad explained that [...] "Andrew is not only a brilliant actor but he is a sportsman. This gave us the opportunity to try things with him that were it not so it would have been almost impossible." ...|$|E
500|$|While the {{character}} development {{was met with}} praise, other critics seemed to felt otherwise. Richard Eisenbeis from Kotaku was critical to Boruto's development, as he felt that his bond with his father {{at the end of}} the Boruto film was unthinkable and weak. Thais Valdivia from Hobby Consolas stated that while viewers of the film may initially dislike Boruto's personality, his character arc helps to make him more appealing adding his fight alongside Naruto and Sasuke as one of the highlights. Chris Beveridge from the Fandom Post disliked the large focus between Naruto and Boruto's relationship on the first chapter of the Boruto manga. Nevertheless, he enjoyed the foreshadow of an older Boruto on a fight against an unknown character. For the anime, Beveridge remarked Boruto's characterization which he felt was superior to the one from the manga. Sam Stewart from IGN felt Boruto's personality was [...] "far less enthused" [...] as the reviewer commented he found {{the character}}'s dislike toward his father misguided and finding types of stories too common in fiction. In a review from the manga, Nick Smith from ICv2 found Boruto as the weak part of the series due to his personality that contrasted the Naruto in the original Naruto series. He also said [...] "The politicking within the power structure surrounding Naruto and Boruto becomes more interesting than Boruto himself" [...] and as a result expected Boruto to change in upcoming chapters to make the series more appealing. However, Melina Dargis liked how Boruto realizes his father's goals and joined Sasuke and the Kages in order to save Naruto. Additionally, Dargis noted Boruto's early strained relationship with his father as well as his use of technology to fight might reflect on modern audiences who might understand his character more as a result. As the character developed, Stewart enjoyed Boruto due to his childish personality <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>starts</b> acting like a hero from an action film he just watched worrying his family in the process. Additionally, the reviewer liked how Boruto's mysterious [...] "Eye Technique" [...] started making references to a previous Naruto film. Theatergoers for the Boruto film were given two different types of fans with one of them using Boruto and Naruto's images.|$|E

Rampaging through South and Central America, Nul was eventually transported to New York City where he began battling Thor, with aid of the Thing, who was transformed into Angrir: Breaker of Souls. After defeating the Thing, Thor stated that he never could beat the Hulk, and instead removed him from the battle by launching him into Earth orbit, after which Thor collapsed from exhaustion. Landing in Romania, Nul immediately began heading for {{the base of the}} vampire-king Dracula. Opposed by Dracula's forces, including a legion of monsters, Nul was seemingly unstoppable. Only after the intervention of Raizo Kodo's Forgiven was Nul briefly slowed. Ultimately, Nul made his way to Dracula's castle where the timely arrival of Kodo and Forgiven member Inka, disguised as Betty Ross, was able to throw off the effects of the Nul possession. Throwing aside the hammer, the Hulk regained control, and promptly left upon realizing [...] "Betty's" [...] true nature.|$|E

[...] Morrison said of the track, [...] "Flamingos Fly", [...] "I've done three versions in the studio. [...] I've done it slow, a ballad version. [...] I've done a mid-tempo version and I've done this version. [...] This is the version I like best for release." [...] "Heavy Connection" [...] is said to be [...] "psychic stuff" [...] with the lyrics vague and secret but speaking [...] of a love connection [...] "when you came into my dreams/like from a whisper to a scream." [...] The last song on the album is [...] "Cold Wind in August". [...] Dr. John describes it as a [...] "cross current from forties to seventies music. [...] It's like where Ray Charles left off. [...] It's a real tear-jerker that gets back to the basics of music."
