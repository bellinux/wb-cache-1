40|$|Cadherin- 11 (cad- 11) is {{primarily}} a mesenchymal cadherin that appears in delaminating neural crest cells. Its expression correlates with morphogenetic events and the pattern has been studied in mouse, rat and Xenopus embryos, but not during avian organogenesis. Our purpose was to investigate this pattern in the chick embryo during organogenesis using immunolocalization and in situ hybridization. Cad- 11 was expressed in mesenchyme around the pharynx and aortic arches, eyes, <b>auditory</b> <b>vesicles,</b> lung buds, stomach, and nasal placodes. Neural expression included some cranial ganglia and also new neuroepithelium within the tail bud region undergoing secondary neurulation. We also found expression in epithelia of the developing circulatory and digestive organs. The limb buds, pineal rudiment and mesonephros were also positive. Cad- 11 expression became more widespread with development. Our findings support the role of cad- 11 as a mesenchymal cadherin, but provide evidence for a wider role that includes epithelial morphogenesis and secondary neurulation. </p...|$|R

Gross morphological and histological analysis of the exposed embryos revealed the following effects: (1) ELMF of 100 Hz/ 1. 2 micro T had the most consistent and powerful inhibitory effect on embryogenesis. Development of embryos was reduced {{to the formation of}} the three primitive layers. Brain <b>vesicles,</b> <b>auditory</b> pit, neural tube, foregut, heart, vessels, and somites were not developed. Glycosaminoglycans were almost absent. (2) The above results demonstrate a window effect because embryos exposed to 100 Hz/ 1. 2 micro T were less developed than embryos exposed at lower and higher intensities and frequencies. (3) Developing organs reacted with different sensitivity to ELMF of specific frequencies and intensities. Somites were not disturbed by exposure to 10 Hz with any of the intensities used. Formation of blood vessels was completely blocked by ELMF of 1000 Hz/ 12 micro T while traces of other organs were present. (4) The drastic embryological disturbances described were obtained with much lower intensities (1 micro T = 0. 01 Gauss) than those used in studies by other investigators. (5) Embryological alterations induced by ELMF may depend on disturbances in the presence and structure of glycosaminoglycans which are essential elements in cellular activities, including cell migration. (6) The use of ELMF of low intensity may be a powerful method to investigate embryogenetic mechanisms and may also be a useful technique for investigation of other biological systems...|$|R

Through a mechanism which has not been completely elucidated, this ubiquitination results in reduced levels of fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) and fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF10).

It is part of the neural ectoderm, which will develop into the membranous labyrinth of the inner ear. This labyrinth is a continuous epithelium, giving rise to the vestibular system and auditory components of the inner ear. During the earlier stages of embryogenesis, the otic placode invaginates to produce the otic cup. Thereafter, the otic cup closes off, creating the otic vesicle. Once formed, the otic vesicle will reside next to the neural tube medially, and on the lateral side will be paraxial mesoderm. Neural crest cells will migrate rostral and caudal to the placode.|$|E
40|$|Using {{degenerated}} PCR-primers {{to identify}} known and novel BMPs that {{are expressed in}} the developing chicken heart, we identified not only BMP 2, - 4, and - 7 mRNA, but also the TGFbeta superfamily member cVg 1. The expression pattern of cVg 1 mRNA was determined during chicken development from HH 4 to HH 44. In early developmental stages, cVg 1 mRNA is expressed in the primitive streak, paraxial mesoderm, developing somites, and developing neural tube. Subsequently, cVg 1 mRNA is expressed in the developing central and peripheral nervous system, retina, <b>auditory</b> <b>vesicle,</b> notochord, lung alveoli, and olfactory mucosa. In the heart, cVg 1 is initially expressed through the linear heart tube, but becomes restricted to the forming chamber myocardium, in an expression domain {{similar to that of}} atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) mRN...|$|E
40|$|Bone {{morphogenetic}} protein 4 (BMP- 4) {{is expressed}} in the ventral marginal zone of the gastrulating embryo. At late gastrula stage this gene {{is expressed in}} the ventral-most part of the slit blastopore and in tissues that derive from it. At tailbud stages BMP- 4 is expressed in the spinal cord roof plate, neural crest, eye and <b>auditory</b> <b>vesicle.</b> The interactions of BMP- 4 with dorsal genes such as goosecoid (gsc) and Xnot- 2 were studied in vivo. In embryos ventralized by UV irradiation and suramin treatment, BMP- 4 zygotic transcripts accumulate prematurely and the entire marginal zone expresses this gene. The patterning effect of BMP- 4 on ventro-posterior development can be revealed by a sensitive assay involving the injection of BMP- 4 mRNA in the ventral marginal zone of embryos partially dorsalized with LiCl, {{which leads to the}} complete rescue of trunk and tail structures. The experiments presented here argue that BMP- 4 may act in vivo as a ventral signal for the proper patterning of the marginal zone, actively interacting with dorsal genes such as gsc and Xnot- 2. A model is proposed in which the timing of expression of various marginal zone-specific genes plays a central role in patterning the mesoderm...|$|E
40|$|Embryonic {{development}} of Clarias gariepinus was studied from oocyte activation {{to the end}} of endogenous feeding (164 h post-fertilization, 164 h-PF). The ontogeny of the eyes, the ear, the heart, the digestive tract and the notochord were described histologically: (i) eyes were not pigmented at hatching (40 h-PF) and the anlage of the retina was observed at 96 h-PF. At 164 h-PF, the pigmented epithelium was distinguished as a single layer of cubical cells and the outer nuclear layer was composed of cones; (ii) the inner ear was oval-shaped and two otoliths and a sensory epithelium were differentiated at hatching. Three semicircular canals with rudimentary cristae developed until 96 h-PF, leading to a fully developed <b>auditory</b> <b>vesicle</b> at 120 h-PF; (iii) at 40 h-PF, a beating heart appeared as a thin-walled tube and at 72 h-PF no blood elements were recorded in the two-chambered heart. The four compartments (bulbus arteriosus, ventricle, atrium, sinus venosus) and mature blood elements were found only at 144 h-PF; (iv) the hatchlings possessed an undifferentiated digestive system, and differentiation of a buccal cavity, oesophagus and intestine was only recorded 96 h-PF. The connection between the oesophagus and the intestine and the anus opened at 144 h-PF; (v) the notochord in newly hatched embryos was composed of vacuolated cells and a peripheral layer of notochordal epithelium inside a fibrous sheath. Subsequently, vacuolated cells proliferated and notochordal epithelium changed from cubical to squamous cells. Eye differentiation was concomitant with first feeding, thus suggesting a key role of visual senses in feeding behaviour...|$|E
40|$|Retinol (vitamin A) and {{retinoic acid}} are potent teratogens and also {{represent}} good candidates for normal morphogens during development. Their actions may be {{mediated by the}} cellular retinoic acid-binding protein (CRABP) and the cellular retinol-binding protein (CRBP). As a step towards understanding the possible function for CRABP and CRBP in morphogenesis, we have used in situ hybridization to analyze their expression during mouse development. Both CRABP and CRBP transcripts were detected at embryonic days 9. 5 - 14. 5. (i) In the nervous system, CRABP transcripts {{were found in the}} mantle layer of the dorsal spinal cord and hindbrain and in the marginal layer of the midbrain, whereas CRBP transcripts were found in the ependymal and mantle layer of the ventral spinal cord and of the forebrain {{as well as in the}} spinal nerves and the roof plate of the spinal cord. (ii) In the eye, CRABP is expressed in the retinal layer, and CRBP is expressed in both retinal and pigmented layers. (iii) In the craniofacial region, CRABP transcripts were found in the mesenchyme of the frontonasal mass and mandible, while CRBP transcripts were found in the mesenchyme of the nasolachrymal duct and surrounding the <b>auditory</b> <b>vesicle.</b> Two general conclusions can be made. First, all of the tissues that are known to be teratogenic targets of retinoic acid and retinol also express CRABP and CRBP transcripts. Second, the specific expression of CRABP and CRBP in numerous developing tissues indicates that these proteins may perform specific functions during morphogenesis of a broad variety of embryonic structures...|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} of RNA, polysaccharides, alkaline and acid phosphatases at successive developmental stages have been analysed in serial transverse {{sections of the}} otic region. Sections submitted to the Unna-Brachet method have permitted {{the study of the}} morphological evolution of embryonic primordia, and of the programmed cellular death sites. Certain aspects of nerve fiber development have been elucidated through observations of sections treated for alkaline phosphatase enzymatic reaction. Acid and alkaline phosphatase tests have revealed the evolution of the primitive sensory areas. Otocyst dissections have allowed {{a better understanding of the}} morphological changes which the primitive otic vesicle undergoes during this period. Several transitory histochemical and morphological features suggest the successive contribution of two different inductors in the primary morphogenesis of the normal auditory placode: the parachordal mesoderm and the rhombencephalon. In addition, the histochemical properties of the invaginating otic pit wall testify the acquisition of a double antero-posterior and dorsoventral polarization. The presumptive sensory area for the future anterior and lateral ampullae and for the utricular macula is easily localized owing to its selective alkaline phosphatase activity. This area is the first to arise from the macula communis. The first primordium of the stato-acoustic ganglion arises from cells migrating from the rostro-ventral wall of the primary <b>auditory</b> <b>vesicle.</b> In this early primordium, we found two portions, one medial and the other lateral. The latter is characterized by its alkaline phosphatase reaction and by its location dorsal to the geniculate ganglion primordium. These two primitive portions do not correspond to the future vestibular and cochlear ganglia. The central sensitive nerve fibers of the ganglionic complex appear very early, before the constitution of the different ganglionic groups. Later on, the motor fibers of the facial nerve become evident. Among the peripheric nerve connections, the anterior ramus fibers become visible earlier.

40|$|Anabas {{species is}} a {{freshwater}} fish which has high potential {{of becoming a}} commercial species in Malaysia. It has high market demand due to its rich protein content. The main {{purpose of this study}} is to study the effect of environmental parameters on hatching period, egg yolk absorption period and starvation period during early development of hybrid Anabas species. Secondly, to isolate and identify type of bacteria exist on infected hybrid Anabas species. Thirdly, to characterize antibiogram of bacteria isolated from infected hybrid Anabas species. Matured broodstock were injected using pituitary hormone to induce breeding. The development stages of embryos and larvae were recorded over period of 0 hours (fertilization eggs) until 312 hours. The larvae and embryo development were studied in four different environmental parameters, namely, water temperature, pH, salinity concentration and formalin concentration. The early development was directly observed and documented in embryonic phase and larvae phase. The growth during embryonic phase was separated into eleven stages starting from a fertilized egg to cleavage, morula, blastula, gastrula, embryonic body formation, optic vesicle and <b>auditory</b> <b>vesicle</b> formation, blastopore closing, tail formation and hatching stages. The hatching further undergoes organogenesis until appears like their parents. Larvae phase consists of two stages which are pre-larvae and post larvae stage. Data analysis using one way ANOVA revealed that temperature is an important and statistically significant factor on hatching period (p< 0. 05). Result on pH, temperature and salinity concentration also gave statistically significant effect on egg yolk absorption. Meanwhile, results on starvation period indicated that temperature, formalin concentration and salinity concentrations were significant. Investigation on antibiotic resistance on infected hybrid Anabas species was done for 19 types of antibiotics using disc diffusion method. Aeromonas sp. and Salmonella sp. were isolated by using medium differentiation followed by a chemical test to identify the type of bacteria. The study reveals that isolates bacteria of Aeromonas sp. has lower Multiple Antibiotic Resistance (MAR index = 0. 19), compared Salmonella sp. (MAR index = 0. 21 and 0. 22). The results on antibiogram showed that Salmonella sp. has lowered sensitive cases (59. 5 %) compared to Aeromonas sp. (67 %). The findings in this study are important to conserve and improve management of Anabas species due to limitation of fish supply...|$|E
