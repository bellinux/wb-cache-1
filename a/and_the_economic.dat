Hobbled by new spending restrictions passed by the opposition-controlled Legislative Assembly, and her administration's corruption scandals, she had difficulty passing her legislative initiatives. Her popularity declined, and her party's candidate José Miguel Alemán lost to the PRD's Torrijos in the subsequent general elections to succeed her.|$|E

5|$|Experience {{from the}} few cities where {{congestion}} pricing has been implemented shows that {{social and political}} acceptability is key. Public discontent with congestion pricing, or rejection of congestion pricing proposals, is due mainly to the inequality issues, the economic burden on neighboring communities, the effect on retail businesses <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> activity in general, and the fears that the revenues will become just another tax.|$|E

5|$|The Treaty of Versailles {{stipulated that}} Germany must {{relinquish}} {{several of its}} territories and demilitarise the Rhineland. The treaty imposed economic sanctions and levied heavy reparations on the country. Many Germans saw the treaty as an unjust humiliation—they especially objected to Article 231, which they interpreted as declaring Germany responsible for the war. The Versailles Treaty <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>economic,</b> social, and political conditions in Germany after the war were later exploited by Hitler for political gain.|$|E

5|$|The {{construction}} of taller buildings during the 1870s was hindered {{by the financial}} Panic of 1873 and the ensuing economic depression, which lasted until around 1879.

5|$|Xenophon {{mentions}} Aspasia {{twice in}} his Socratic writings: in Memorabilia and in Oeconomicus. In both cases her advice is recommended to Critobulus by Socrates.

5|$|After a {{short period}} of demobilization, the major naval nations of the globe began {{programmes}} for increasing the size and number of their capital ships. Wilson's plan for a world-leading set of capital ships led to a Japanese counter-programme, and a plan by the British to build sufficient ships to maintain a navy superior to either. American isolationist feeling <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> concerns of the others led to the Washington Naval Conference of 1921. The outcome of the conference included the Washington Naval Treaty (also known as the Five-Power treaty), and limitations on the use of submarines. The Treaty prescribed a ratio of 5:5:3:1:1 for capital ships between treaty nations. The treaty recognized the U.S. Navy as being equal to the Royal Navy with 525,000 tons of capital ships and 135,000 tons of aircraft carriers, and the Japanese as the third power. Many older ships were scrapped by the five nations to meet the treaty limitations, and new building of capital ships limited.|$|E

5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Iron Curtain <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> and {{political}} barriers that followed, central and eastern European countries with local mushroom harvesting traditions, such as Albania, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Romania, Serbia and Slovenia, developed into exporters of porcini, concentrating primarily on the Italian market. Exported porcini and other wild fungi are also destined for France, Germany and other western European markets, where demand for them exists, but collection on a commercial scale does not. Picking B.edulis has become an annual seasonal income earner and pastime in countries like Bulgaria, especially for many Roma communities and the unemployed. A lack of control has led to heavy exploitation of the mushroom resource.|$|E
5|$|Beshear called another special {{legislative}} session in June 2009 to address another $1 billion shortfall {{in the state}} budget. Later, Beshear amended the call to include the economic incentives package that was not approved during the regular session and, in light of Attorney General Conway's opinion on video lottery terminals, a measure to expand gambling in the state by statute. With the threshold lowered from 60 votes {{for a constitutional amendment}} to 51 votes for a statute, the House of Representatives passed the expanded gambling bill, but the measure died in the Republican-dominated Senate Appropriations and Revenue Committee by a 10–5 vote. The amended budget <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> incentives bills both passed in the 10-day session.|$|E

He was personally assigned by Stalin first to Industry and than to Transportation ministries of Poland. His wife, Julia, became the Editor-in-Chief of the monopolized Polish Press Agency. Minister Jakub Berman – Stalin's right hand in Poland until 1953 – held the Political propaganda and Ideology portfolios. He {{was responsible for the}} largest and most notorious secret police {{in the history of the}} People's Republic of Poland, the Ministry of Public Security (UB), employing 33,200 permanent security officers, one for every 800 Polish citizens.|$|E
5|$|In April 1941, Germany, Italy and Hungary invaded and {{occupied}} Yugoslavia. Montenegro {{was captured by}} the Germans, who soon withdrew, leaving the Italians to occupy it. The Montenegrins quickly developed grievances against the Italians related to the expulsion of Montenegrins from Kosovo and Vojvodina, the influx of refugees {{from other parts of}} Yugoslavia, and those fleeing Ustaše terror in the regions along the borders with Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Montenegrins also had grievances against the Italian annexation of important food producing territory in Kosovo and a salt producing facility at Ulcinj to Albania, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> damage inflicted on many Montenegrins by the temporary removal of Yugoslav banknotes of 500 dinars and above from circulation. By the time of the invasion, Đurišić had been promoted to the rank of kapetan prve klase (captain first class).|$|E
5|$|Jorge Remes Lenicov {{resigned}} in April, alongside ministers De Mendiguren and Capitanich. Peronist governors, legislators, and union leaders {{met at the}} Quinta de Olivos, amid rumors that Duhalde would appoint the populist Daniel Carbonetto as minister of economy. They gave their full support to the president <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> policies instrumented so far. As a result, Duhalde appointed the conservative Roberto Lavagna. Lavagna was the Argentine ambassador to the European Union, and switched offices with Remes Lenicov. He was suggested by Governor Carlos Ruckauf and supported by Alfonsín. He stabilised prices and the exchange rate with tight fiscal and monetary policies, and prevented the crisis from growing into an hyperinflation. The recovery also benefited from the idle capacity of the economy.|$|E

5|$|Laws {{have been}} passed {{in many areas of}} the world to protect bears from habitat destruction. Public {{perception}} of bears is often positive, as people identify with bears due to their omnivorous diets, their ability to stand on two legs, and their symbolic importance. Support for bear protection is widespread, at least in more affluent societies. Where bears raid crops or attack livestock, they may come into conflict with humans. In poorer rural regions, attitudes may be more shaped by the dangers posed by bears <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> costs they cause to farmers and ranchers.|$|E
5|$|The bank bailouts <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> {{downturn}} {{increased the}} country's deficit and debt levels {{and led to}} a substantial downgrading of its credit rating. To build up trust in the financial markets, the government began to introduce austerity measures and in 2011 it passed a law in congress to approve an amendment to the Spanish Constitution to require a balanced budget at both the national and regional level by 2020. The amendment states that public debt can not exceed 60% of GDP, though exceptions would be made in case of a natural catastrophe, economic recession or other emergencies. As one of the largest eurozone economies (larger than Greece, Portugal and Ireland combined) the condition of Spain's economy is of particular concern to international observers. Under pressure from the United States, the IMF, other European countries and the European Commission the Spanish governments eventually succeeded in trimming the deficit from 11.2% of GDP in 2009 to an 7.1% in 2013.|$|E
5|$|Zimbabwe {{suffered}} occasional {{outbreaks of}} acute diseases (such as plague in 1994). The gains {{on the national}} health were eroded by structural adjustment in the 1990s, {{the impact of the}} HIV/AIDS pandemic <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> crisis since the year 2000. In 2006, Zimbabwe had one of the lowest life expectancies in the world according to UN figure – 44 for men and 43 for women, down from 60 in 1990, but this has since recovered to 53 and 54 respectively. The rapid drop was ascribed mainly to the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Infant mortality rose from 6% in the late 1990s to 12.3% by 2004. By 2014 HIV/AIDS prevalence had been reduced to 15% compared to 40% in 1998.|$|E
