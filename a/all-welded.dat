She was the largest <b>all-welded</b> steel vessel to have been {{constructed}} in Australia at the time, and her final price of £124,000 was considerably more than Steele's deliberate underestimate. The ship was launched on 8 August 1945 after being named by Steele's wife, and later became the largest ship to be commissioned by the Australian Army during World War II. Construction of a sister ship, to be called AV2768 Corsair, was also begun, but this ship was cancelled when the war ended.|$|E
5|$|During the 1920s, major {{advances}} {{were made}} in welding technology, including the introduction of automatic welding in 1920, in which electrode wire was fed continuously. Shielding gas became a subject receiving much attention, as scientists attempted to protect welds {{from the effects of}} oxygen and nitrogen in the atmosphere. Porosity and brittleness were the primary problems, and the solutions that developed included the use of hydrogen, argon, and helium as welding atmospheres. During the following decade, further advances allowed for the welding of reactive metals like aluminum and magnesium. This in conjunction with developments in automatic welding, alternating current, and fluxes fed a major expansion of arc welding during the 1930s and then during World War II. In 1930, the first <b>all-welded</b> merchant vessel, M/S Carolinian, was launched.|$|E

50|$|Engineer Evgeny Paton {{played a}} direct {{role in the}} design and {{construction}} of the bridge. Originally he came up with a revolutionary, even on a global scale, innovative idea of <b>all-welding</b> the structure instead of using the traditional riveted design. The first such road bridge in the world, the Maurzyce Bridge, had been opened only in 1928 and since then the idea was a relative novelty in civil engineering, with only a couple dozen constructions finished before the outbreak of World War II. Paton urged the designers that such approach will greatly improve the reliability of the structure, but initially his idea did not find any support amongst the professionals. Eventually his idea of <b>all-welding</b> did receive the support, as he was given the go-head to start building the bridge by the head of the Ukrainian Communist Party, Nikita Khrushchev, who personally oversaw the entire operation. The construction of the first span began in early June 1941, but was interrupted by the Great Patriotic War. After the liberation of Kiev by the Red Army on 6 November 1943, construction of the bridge was forced to begin practically from scratch as the retreating German troops blew up all of the existing parts of the incomplete bridge. However, the construction of the bridge was completed {{just in time for the}} 10th anniversary of the liberation of Kiev and was officially opened on the 5 November 1953. Upon the completion, the bridge was composed of 264 identical blocks which are 29 m in length each, held together by welded seams totalling 10668 m. The total weight of the entire structure is estimated to be over 10000 t. The installation of the streetcar tracks on the bridge also enabled the passengers to commute between the Left Bank and Right Banks of Kiev by tram, taking pressure off the buses.|$|R
40|$|Double channel torch, {{which allows}} {{concentric}} flow {{of two different}} shielding gases, was designed and manufactured in order to pursue double channel torch {{gas metal arc welding}} of unalloyed structural steel S 235 JR (EN 10025 - 2) with fourteen passes. Tensile and Charpy V-notch tests were realized and the results were compared with those of conventional gas metal arc welding. In order to evaluate mechanical testing results, microstructural analyses were conducted. It was found that the increase with double channel gas metal arc welding process in yield and tensile strengths as well as in toughness tests, especially in subzero temperatures, compared with conventional gas metal arc welding was due to longer columnar grains and finer tempered zone grain structure between passes and due to solidification and less dendritic structure formation in <b>all-weld</b> metal in double channel gas metal arc welding...|$|R

40|$|Neural network {{modelling}} {{has been}} applied to search for novel high strength steel weld metal compositions, potentially offering improved tolerance to variations in the weld thermal cycle. An experimental 7 wt % Ni manual metal arc electrode, formulated on these predictions, was used to produce <b>all-weld</b> metals and welds in high strength steel. Mechanical properties were correlated to weld metal microstructure and compared with those of a conventional 3 wt % Ni weld metal for different welding conditions. Light optical and transmission electron microscopy proved the 7 wt % Ni weld metal microstructure to be predominantly bainitic with some martensite. Also the 3 wt % Ni weld metals were bainitic/martensitic but with relative fractions being strongly cooling rate dependent. Similar strength and toughness were measured for both types of weld metals at intermediate cooling rates (∆t 8 / 5 ≈ 10 s). However, the properties of the 7 wt % Ni weld metal varied significantly less with welding conditions and this composition clearly offers an advantage in terms of tolerance to variations in the weld thermal cycle...|$|R
40|$|Low cost welding {{procedures}} were developed for welding 6 -inch thick HY- 150 steel {{to be used}} in the manufacture of large diameter motor case Y rings and nozzle attachment flanges.

Transverse tensiles, <b>all-weld</b> metal tensiles, Charpy V-notch specimens and edge notched bend specimens were tested in the course of the program. In addition metallographic studies and hardness tests were performed on the weld, weld HAZ and base metal. The results of the work performed indicate that both the shielded metal arc and gas metal arc processes are capable of producing consistently sound welds as determined by radiographic and ultrasonic inspection.

The hull of the EIFV is of <b>all-welded</b> 5083 aluminum armour which provides protection from small arms fire and shell splinters, able to defeat armour-piercing projectiles up to 14.5mm in calibre over a 360° arc of attack. Aluminum provides protection {{similar to that of}} steel armor while keeping the vehicle lightweight.

40|$|Fatigue cracks often {{initiate}} at welds as {{a consequence}} of large residual stresses and changes in geometry acting as stress concentrators. A concept showing promise in improving the fatigue life of welded components is the use of so called Low Transformation Temperature (LTT) welding consumables. These reduce the accumulation of residual stresses in welded joints by exploiting transformation plasticity to compensate for thermal contraction. This in turn enhances fatigue life. Three LTT alloys, based on different combinations of mainly Ni and Cr to produce low martensite- start (M s) temperatures, have been studied. Fatigue testing showed similar results with a significant increase in fatigue strength for fillet and butt weld configurations for all three compositions. There was a pronounced interdependence between a lower transformation temperature, lower residual stresses and improved fatigue strength. The LTT effect was clearly related to the weld metal transformation temperature rather than the alloying concept per se. Dilution was an important factor in single-pass applications with M s temperatures increasing by up to 70 °C compared to the corresponding <b>all-weld</b> metals. A 13 Cr 6 Ni alloy was identified as the most promising LTT-alloy considering not only fatigue performance but also aspects such as safety against hot and cold cracking, strength, toughness and ductility. This alloy is crack safe thanks to its ferritic solidification and as a bonus offers some corrosion resistance. Further optimisation is needed, though, to compensate for dilution effects in single-pass applications...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} varying welding {{conditions}} on multipass weld metal {{has been investigated}} in <b>all-weld</b> test plates produced by flux cored arc (FCA) welding. The principal welding conditions varied for the test samples in the current research program were heat input (between approximately 1 and 2. 5 kJ/mm), welding technique (stringer or weave beads), shielding gas, welding position (flat or vertical) and consumable type. Mechanical testing of weld metal included tensile testing and Charpy-vee-notch impact tests over a range of temperatures from - 60 °C to 40 °C. The tensile testing results showed that yield and tensile strength generally decreased with increasing heat input and that the changes were {{of the order of}} 100 MPa. Impact properties showed more varied behaviour depending on consumable type. The effect of varying welding conditions on some less commonly studied microstructural factors has also been investigated, such as proportions of reheated and double-reheated regions and mean free path (MFP) in various distinctive microstructural zones. Using the simplifying assumption that the structural gradient the heat affected zone (HAZ) of reheated weld metal can be characterized in terms of three regions: the grain coarsened, GC; grain refined, GR and intercritical, IC heat affected regions; a second overlapping weld bead creates double-reheated weld metal structures which can be defined in terms of 9 sub-zones: GC-GC, GC-GR, GC-IC, GRGC, GR-GR, GR-IC, IC-GC, IC-GR, IC-IC. Linear and areal measurement techniques have been used on cross-sections of seventeen test plates to determine the volume fractions of solidified weld metal (SW), GC, GR and IC sub-zones of the reheated weld metal and the double-reheated zone. The hardness variation in the sub-zones and the influence of welding conditions has also been investigated in the present research. The mean free path was determined for SW, GC, GR and IC regions and the overall average mean free path of ferrite in each weld was also calculated to provide a characteristic length of the totality of the structural microconstituents in the weld metal. Strong relationships were found between mean free path and heat input and also with the strength of the weld metal. In contrast, toughness correlated poorly with overall mean free path. Impact toughness {{is one of the most}} important mechanical properties of welds. Assessment and understanding of the impact properties of welds is central to the avoidance of catastrophic failure of welded steel structures. Neural networks analysis has been used for the purpose of assessing which factors are beneficial to the low temperature impact properties of steel welds in order to obtain practical guidance as to how impact properties might be improved in FCA welds. Four major data fields were involved in the training of the neural networks: chemical composition, microstructure, non-metallic inclusions and welding condition. The backpropagation algorithm was used for the analysis. Sensitivity analysis of the neural network model revealed that the characteristics of the non-metallic inclusion distribution exerted only a small direct influence on toughness. In contrast, chemical composition and microstructure were indicated to be very important. In particular the toughness is predicted to increase with increasing % acicular ferrite and % reaustenitised region and these factors in turn are sensitive to the selected FCAW process and the welding conditions...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the effect of}} welding on the microstructure and properties of commercially pure titanium welded with a pulsed laser beam. Among other applications, pulsed laser welding is widely used {{in the construction of}} dental implants from pre-fabricated wrought components and also for the repair of both wrought and cast implants. In practice these devices experience an increased number of failures due to fracture of the laser welded titanium framework compared to traditional gold prostheses. The numerous studies which have focused on improving the properties of such welds, however, tend to be more clinically focused with only limited investigations into understanding the fundamental weld metallurgy. In the present work this issue is addressed with detailed investigation into the effect of alloying elements, external contamination from welding and changing process parameters. In addition, micros tensile testing and wave-dispersive spectroscopy techniques are developed to try and improve the characterisation of pulsed laser welds. Modern wave dispersive spectroscopy techniques were successfully employed to measure bulk oxygen content in titanium on a small area 100 x 100 m with good agreement with the bulk ASTM standard technique down to oxygen contents of 500 ppm. The technique was still not localised enough however to be applied to the intended application of laser welds. An <b>all-weld</b> longitudinal micro tensile test was successfully developed with the ability to accurately evaluate the elongation of the welds. It was identified however that the significance of such tensile test results could not be appreciated without further investigation into the weld metallurgy to develop a greater understanding of the cause of the measured changes in properties. Investigations into the weld metallurgy revealed that alloy composition and external contamination have the most significant effect on the weld microstructure and hardness of the weld with the effect of process parameters being more subtle. The welds consist of a fusion zone and a HAZ region which has undergone significant grain growth and morphology change due to heating above the beta transus. At low alloy contents the fusion zone and HAZ undergo a massive transformation on cooling which transits to a martensite transformation with increased alloy content. Iron was found to have the largest effect on weld microstructure, being a strong suppressor of the massive phase and promoting the martensitic transformation. Oxygen and nitrogen do not affect the nature of the allotropic beta to alpha phase transformation as much as iron but have a more pronounced effect on hardness due to solid solution strengthening. The transition from massive to martensitic transformation occurs at lower alloy contents in the fusion zone compared to the HAZ due to the higher cooling rate it experiences. A wide range of process parameters were trialled with little affect {{on the nature of the}} allotropic phase transformation. The main effect of process parameters was to coarsen the microstructure due to changes in the cooling rate linked mainly to changing energy per pulse. The hardness of high solute content alloys was more sensitive to changes in process parameters than low solute content alloys due to the effect solutes have on increasing the gradient of the Hall-Petch relation. For higher pulse energy welds an additional HAZ was identified associated with slow early stage recrystallization in the alpha phase field. This region requires a large number of dislocation to form however so is only present for welds on deformed substrates...|$|R
