25|$|The July 2 Cases {{mark the}} {{beginning}} of the United States' modern legal conversation <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty.</b> Major subsequent developments include forbidding the death penalty for rape (Coker v. Georgia), restricting the death penalty in cases of felony murder (Enmund v. Florida), exempting the mentally handicapped (Atkins v. Virginia) and juvenile murderers (Roper v. Simmons) from the death penalty, removing virtually all limitations on the presentation of mitigating evidence (Lockett v. Ohio, Holmes v. South Carolina), requiring precision in the definition of aggravating factors (Godfrey v. Georgia, Walton v. Arizona), and requiring the jury to decide whether aggravating factors have been proved beyond a reasonable doubt (Ring v. Arizona).|$|E

2500|$|Egypt's {{penal code}} is silent about any {{punishment}} for apostasy from Islam. Contemporary Egyptian jurisprudence prohibits apostasy from Islam, but has also remained silent <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty.</b> Article 2 of the Constitution of Egypt enshrines sharia. Both Court of Cassation and the Supreme Administrative Court of Egypt have ruled that, “it is completely acceptable for non-Muslims to embrace Islam but by consensus Muslims {{are not allowed}} to embrace another religion or to become of no religion at all [...]” The silence about punishment for apostasy along with the constitutional enshrinement of Sharia, means the death sentence for apostasy is a possibility. In practice, Egypt has prosecuted apostasy from Islam under its blasphemy laws using the Hisbah doctrine; and non-state Islamic groups have taken the law into their own hands and executed apostates.|$|E

25|$|Among {{the reasons}} cited for banning capital {{punishment}} in Canada were fears about wrongful convictions, concerns <b>about</b> <b>the</b> state taking people's lives, and uncertainty <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty's</b> {{role as a}} deterrent for crime. The 1959 conviction of 14-year-old Steven Truscott was a significant impetus (although certainly not the only one) toward the abolition of capital punishment. Truscott was sentenced to <b>death</b> for <b>the</b> murder of a classmate. His sentence was later commuted to a life sentence and in 2007 he was acquitted of the charges (although the appeal court did not state {{that he was in}} fact innocent).|$|R

5000|$|The {{official}} ghetto {{was established}} in Lublin on 24 March 1941. The expelled Jews have been returned there.

In October and December 1941, the local administration and the Sicherheitspolizei headquarters issued decrees <b>about</b> <b>the</b> instant <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> for <b>the</b> Jews caught leaving the Jewish district. Any Christian Pole harbouring Jews on the Aryan side of the city was to be executed along with his family. The ghetto inmates were terrorized by the Waffen-SS battalion of Oskar Dirlewanger, engaging in extortion, murder and rape (Rassenschande) to such an extend that they had to be moved elsewhere, yet again.|$|R
