5|$|The series {{moved back}} to once-weekly Saturday broadcasts. All episodes were 45 minutes long, though they also exist in 25-minute versions. Although there were now only 13 episodes in the season, the total running time {{remained}} approximately {{the same as in}} previous seasons since the episodes were <b>almost</b> <b>twice</b> as long.|$|E
5|$|Lead's {{close-packed}} face-centered cubic {{structure and}} high atomic weight {{result in a}} density of 11.34g/cm3, which is {{greater than that of}} common metals such as iron (7.87g/cm3), copper (8.93g/cm3), and zinc (7.14g/cm3). This density is the origin of the idiom to go over like a lead balloon. Some rarer metals are denser: tungsten and gold are both 19.3g/cm3, and osmium—the densest metal known—has a density of 22.59g/cm3, <b>almost</b> <b>twice</b> that of lead.|$|E
5|$|Metis is tidally locked to Jupiter, and {{its shape}} is {{strongly}} asymmetrical, {{with one of}} the diameters being <b>almost</b> <b>twice</b> as large as the smallest one. It {{is also one of the}} two moons known to orbit Jupiter in less than the length of Jupiter's day, the other being Adrastea. It orbits within the main ring of Jupiter, and is thought to be a major contributor of material to the rings.|$|E

5|$|Moonraker {{was noted}} for its high {{production}} cost of $34million, <b>almost</b> <b>twice</b> {{as much money as}} predecessor The Spy Who Loved Me, and it received mixed reviews. However, the film's visuals were praised with Derek Meddings being nominated for the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, and it eventually became the highest-grossing film of the series with $210,300,000 worldwide, a record that stood until 1995's GoldenEye.|$|E
5|$|Other animals, {{including}} {{whales and}} elephants have larger brains than humans. However, when the brain-to-body mass ratio is taken into account, {{the human brain}} is <b>almost</b> <b>twice</b> as large {{as that of a}} bottlenose dolphin, and three times as large as that of a chimpanzee. However, a high ratio does not of itself demonstrate intelligence: very small animals have high ratios and the treeshrew has the largest quotient of any mammal.|$|E
5|$|The {{attendance}} for {{the event}} was 6,500 fans, who paid a total of $80,000 in admission. This is the lowest attendance figure for a King of the Ring event. The attendance the following year was <b>almost</b> <b>twice</b> as large, as 12,000 fans attended King of the Ring 1994. The PPV buyrate was 1.1, which was the highest buyrate in King of the Ring history until the 1999 event.|$|E
50|$|People {{with more}} than ten friends in their {{congregation}} were reported to <b>almost</b> be <b>twice</b> as satisfied with life as people with no friends in their congregation. The religious propensity toward charity and volunteerism can be connected with close church friendship, as well. The benefits of religious social support {{have been found to}} explain the link between attendance at religious services and life satisfaction.|$|R

He spoke <b>almost</b> exactly <b>twice</b> as fast as Mr. Direck, clipping his words much more, using much compacter sentences, and generally cutting his corners, and this put Mr. Direck off his game.|$|R
5|$|The {{broadcasts}} of {{the games}} between the rivals have led {{to an increase in}} television ratings. These games have had at least 50% higher ratings than all of the other games broadcast, sometimes <b>almost</b> <b>twice</b> as high than locally broadcast games. In most cases, the most-watched MLB game on any network during a season is a game between the Yankees and the Red Sox.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1958 season, O'Connell, who {{lacked the}} stature and {{durability}} Paul Brown wanted in a starter, retired {{to take a}} coaching job in Illinois, and Milt Plum was named as his replacement. Cleveland, however, was relying increasingly on the running game, in contrast to its pass-happy early years under Graham. As the team built up a 9–3 regular-season record, Brown in 1958 ran for 1,527yards – <b>almost</b> <b>twice</b> {{as much as any}} other back and a league record at the time.|$|E
5|$|More {{than half}} of the state's households, based on an average family size of four persons, contributed a family member to fight in the war, making the effects of the {{conflict}} widely felt throughout the state. More Hoosiers died in the Civil War than in any other conflict. Although twice as many Hoosiers served in World War II, <b>almost</b> <b>twice</b> as many died in the Civil War. After the war, veterans programs were initiated to help wounded soldiers with housing, food, and other basic needs. In addition, orphanages and asylums were established to assist women and children.|$|E
5|$|The Pros <b>almost</b> scored <b>twice,</b> {{but failed}} once because of ineligible {{receiver}} penalties. On the other hand, Pollard made a touchdown-saving tackle against Sternment {{in the third}} quarter. On the same drive, the Staleys missed a 30-yard field goal. The Staleys' Chamberlin attempted to injure Pollard twice {{in an attempt to}} remove him from the game. The final score ended in a 0–0 tie; however, the Chicago Defender reported that the refereeing was biased towards Decatur.|$|R
40|$|Conidia of TrichodermaharzianumF- 340, {{an active}} {{producer}} of fungal mutanase, were mutagenized with {{physical and chemical}} mutagens used separately or in combination. After mutagenesis, the drop in conidia viability ranged from 0. 004 % to 71 %. Among the applied mutagens, nitrosoguanidine gave the highest frequency of cultures with enhanced mutanase activity (98 %). In total, 400 clones were isolated, and preliminarily evaluated for mutanase activity in flask microcultures. Eight most productive mutants were then quantified for mutanase production in shake flask cultures. The obtained results fully confirmed a great propensity of all the tested mutants to synthesize mutanase, the activity of which increased from 59 to 107 % {{in relation to the}} parental T. harzianumculture. The best mutanase-overproducing mutant (T. harzianumF- 340 - 48), obtained with nitrosoguanidine, produced the enzyme activity of 1. 36 U/ml (4. 5 U/mg protein) after 4 days of incubation in shake flask culture. This productivity was <b>almost</b> <b>twices</b> higher than that achieved by the initial strain F- 340, and, at present, is the best reported in the literature. The potential application of mutanase in dentistry is also discussed...|$|R

5|$|While Argentina's {{finances}} {{were extremely}} strained {{at this juncture}} following the economic crisis in 1953, the most serious setback to the project came in January 1955 when Tank's contract expired. He reputedly requested <b>almost</b> <b>twice</b> as much money to continue but President Perón instead canceled his contract outright. Despite four years of development and trials, the IAe 33 project was still encountering teething problems and its status remained unclear although no final decision {{had been made to}} abandon a project that had reached iconic stature in the Perónist era.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the ships}} was {{authorized}} on 30 June 1890 and the contract for Indiana—not including guns and armor—was awarded to William Cramp & Sons in Philadelphia, who offered to build it for $3,020,000. The {{total cost of the}} ship was <b>almost</b> <b>twice</b> as high, approximately $6,000,000. The contract specified the ship had to be built in three years, but slow delivery of armor plates caused a two-year delay. Indianas keel was laid down on 7 May 1891 and she was launched on 28 February 1893, attended by around 10,000 people, including President Benjamin Harrison, several members of his cabinet and the two senators from Indiana. During her fitting-out in early March 1894, the ship undertook a preliminary sea trial to test her speed and machinery. At this point her side armor, guns, turrets and conning tower had not yet been fitted, and her official trials would not take place until October 1895 due to the delays in armor deliveries.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the ships}} was {{authorized}} on 30 June 1890 and the contract for Massachusetts—not including guns and armor—was awarded to William Cramp & Sons of Philadelphia, who offered to build it for $3,020,000. The {{total cost of the}} ship was <b>almost</b> <b>twice</b> as high, approximately $6,000,000. The contract specified the ship had to be built in three years, but slow delivery of armor plates and guns caused a delay. Her keel was laid down on 25 June 1891 and she was launched two years later on 10 June 1893. The launching ceremony was attended by thousands of people, including Secretary of the Navy Hilary A. Herbert and commander George Dewey. Her preliminary sea trial did not take place until March 1896 because of the delays in armor and gun deliveries. At this point Massachusetts was almost complete, and her official trial was held a month later.|$|E

Upon the second search by Gomber’s servant, Nancy is narrowly saved from discovery, but ends up locked in an upstairs room. In the closet of this room, Nancy finds a knob and after pulling it, discovers a hidden staircase. The stone staircase, {{as it turns}} out, leads to a large underground tunnel that splits off at various points, all of which lead into different rooms in the Turnbull mansion.|$|R

60|$|There {{were two}} junior Ashbys, twins, aged sixteen. They {{went to school}} at Charchester, {{returning}} to the ancestral home for the weekend. Sometimes when Pringle came they would bring a school friend, in which case Pringle and he would play the twins. But as a rule the programme consisted {{of a series of}} five test matches, Charchester versus Beckford; and as Pringle was <b>almost</b> exactly <b>twice</b> as good as each of the twins taken individually, when they combined it made the sides very even, and the test matches were fought out with the most deadly keenness.|$|R
5|$|In 2007, Sidney Crosby {{became the}} {{youngest}} player to win the Art Ross Trophy at age 19, and also {{became the youngest}} scoring champion in any major North American professional sport. At <b>almost</b> <b>twice</b> Crosby's age, Martin St. Louis became the oldest player to capture the Art Ross {{at the age of}} 37, also having the longest gap between scoring titles (nine years). Henrik and Daniel Sedin are the only siblings to win the award, in 2010 and 2011, respectively. Since 2001, only three players, Crosby, Evgeni Malkin, and St. Louis have won the award more than once: Crosby in 2007 and 2014, Malkin in 2009 and 2012, and St. Louis in 2004 and 2013.|$|E
5|$|Nichols {{left the}} Atomic Energy Commission in 1955 {{and opened a}} {{consulting}} firm on K Street, specializing in commercial atomic energy research and development. His clients included Alcoa, Gulf Oil, Westinghouse Electric Corporation and the Yankee Rowe Nuclear Power Station. Nichols was involved {{with the construction of}} the Yankee Rowe Nuclear Power Station, the first privately owned pressurized-water plant, and the Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Plant, which commenced operation in 1961 and 1968 respectively. They were both experimental and not expected to be competitive with coal and oil, but later became more so due to inflation and large increases in coal and oil prices. He was critical of over-regulation and protracted hearings, which meant that by the 1980s similar boiling-water or pressurized-water plants took <b>almost</b> <b>twice</b> as long to build in the United States as in France, Japan, Taiwan or South Korea.|$|E
5|$|No part of M-134 {{is listed}} on the National Highway System, a system of roadways {{important}} to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. In 2009, the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) conducted a survey to determine the traffic volume along the highway, reported using a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT). The department determined that the highest count was the 3,595vehicles a day that used the highway west of the M-129 junction in Cedarville; the lowest counts were 608vehicles daily between the M-48 junction and the De Tour village limits. On the island, 667vehicles use M-134 daily. According to tourism officials in the area, over 100,000vehicles per year are transported round trip on the ferry with <b>almost</b> <b>twice</b> as many additional passengers.|$|E
40|$|A novel FH/MFSK {{receiver}} {{with additional}} partial correlators is proposed {{by means of}} side information for asynchronous frequency-hopping multiple-access (FHMA) systems {{in the presence of}} Rayleigh fading. Performance analysis is carried out and compared for both the novel and conventional receivers. One hop per symbol and Reed-Solomon (RS) coding are used in the FHMA systems.

40|$|Abstract. Attapulgite is {{a natural}} {{rod-like}} nanomaterial. The surface of natural attapulgite nanoparticles was cleaned, modified with silane coupling agent 3 -aminpropyltriethoxysilane (KH 550). The structure and morphology of the modified attapulgite were characterized by infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope (SEM). The methane absorption capacity of the modified attapulgite was recorded by intelligent gravimetric analyzer. SEM revealed that 3 -aminpropyltriethoxysilane was modified {{on the surface of}} rod-like attapulgite nanoparticles. The 3 -aminpropyltriethoxysilane can obviously increase the methane absorption capacity of the nanoparticles <b>almost</b> about <b>twice.</b> This result may provide the attapulgite nanoparticles a new way to industrial application. 1...|$|R
50|$|This ability {{allows one}} Croutonian to {{transfer}} {{some of his}} energy into another Croutonian. To do this they first must clasp both of their hands while facing each other. Then one can have his energy into the other. The effect on the one receiving the energy {{is that he is}} able to move <b>almost</b> at <b>twice</b> his normal speed, and have extremely quick reflexes. The other one will move in an exaggerated slowness and with extremely slow reflexes. It is not explained if the Croutonians must be related to use this ability or if they can transfer energy to any one from Crouton.|$|R
5|$|The {{bottlenose}} dolphin {{has a single}} blowhole located on the dorsal surface of the head consisting of a hole and a muscular flap. The flap is closed during muscle relaxation and opens during contraction. Dolphins are voluntary breathers, who must deliberately surface and open their blowholes to get air. They can store <b>almost</b> <b>twice</b> as much oxygen in proportion to their body weight as a human can: the dolphin can store 36 milliliters (ml) of oxygen per kg of body weight, compared with 20 ml per kg for humans. This is an adaptation to diving. The {{bottlenose dolphin}} typically rises to the surface to breathe through its blowhole {{two to three times}} per minute, although it can remain submerged for up to 20 minutes.|$|E
5|$|The {{facilities}} of {{the theatre}} naturally lent {{themselves to the}} new genre of musical theatre. Chu Chin Chow opened in 1916 and ran for an astonishing world record 2,235 performances (<b>almost</b> <b>twice</b> {{as long as the}} previous record for musical theatre – a record that it held until surpassed by Salad Days in 1955). Major productions of plays with large casts were also performed at His Majesty's. George and Ira Gershwin's Oh, Kay! had its London premiere on 21 September 1927. This starred Gertrude Lawrence and John Kirby, and ran for 213 performances. Noël Coward's operetta Bitter Sweet enjoyed a run of 697 performances beginning 18 July 1929. J. B. Priestley's theatrical adaptation of his own The Good Companions premiered on 14 May 1931.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{system of}} Mortal Kombat II is an improved {{version of that}} from the original Mortal Kombat. There are several changes in standard moves: a crouching punch and turnaround kick are added, low and high kicks have greater differentiation (be they crouching or standing up), the roundhouse kick are made more powerful (knocking an opponent across the screen, like the game's uppercut), and {{it is easier to}} perform a combo due to reduced recovery times for attacks. Returning characters also gained new special moves, including some to be used in mid-air, and the game plays <b>almost</b> <b>twice</b> as fast as the original. However, all playable characters in the game still share most generic attributes (such as power and jump height) and all normal moves are also the same between each character.|$|E
