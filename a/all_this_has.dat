5|$|For a long time, {{bivalves}} {{were thought}} to be better adapted to aquatic life than brachiopods were, outcompeting and relegating them to minor niches in later ages. These two taxa appeared in textbooks as an example of replacement by competition. Evidence given for this included the fact that bivalves needed less food to subsist because of their energetically efficient ligament-muscle system for opening and closing valves. <b>All</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> been broadly disproven, though; rather, the prominence of modern bivalves over brachiopods seems due to chance disparities in their response to extinction events.|$|E
5|$|Since the 1980s, Karnataka {{has emerged}} as the pan-Indian leader in the field of IT (information technology). In 2007, there were nearly 2,000 firms {{operating}} in Karnataka. Many of them, including two of India's biggest software firms, Infosys and Wipro, are also headquartered in the state. Exports from these firms exceeded 50,000 crores ($12.5 billion) in 2006–07, accounting for nearly 38% of all IT exports from India. The Nandi Hills area in the outskirts of Devanahalli is the site of the upcoming $22 billion, 50 square kilometre BIAL IT Investment Region, one of the largest infrastructure projects in the history of Karnataka. <b>All</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> earned the state capital, Bangalore, the sobriquet Silicon Valley of India.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> {{led to the}} {{enduring}} image of an ineffectual leadership in foreign and military affairs under Zaoutzes. This may explain why, despite the resumption of Leo's affair with Zoe, the relationship between Zaoutzes and the emperor became strained: tales of an alleged plot by Zaoutzes's son to murder Leo in 894/895 indicate a rift between the two, and although Zaoutzes himself was not involved, a major quarrel between them ensued shortly after. Although they were reconciled, Zaoutzes's standing seems to have declined further thereafter, as two of his protégés, found guilty of accepting bribes, were punished by Leo. Nevertheless, in late summer 898, {{following the death of}} Theophano in December 865 or 866 and of Zoe's first husband Gouzouniates in early 898, Leo at last married Zoe, raising her to Augusta. In the next year, however, both Zoe and Stylianos died. Following their deaths, Leo proposed to marry yet again, choosing Eudokia Baïana as his wife. Zaoutzes's numerous relatives, who had benefited from his patronage, were fearful of losing their positions to the new Empress's relations, and conspired to overthrow Leo. Chief among them was Basil, Zoe's nephew. The plot, however, was betrayed by the eunuch servant Samonas, and the conspiracy suppressed. The Zaoutzes relatives were exiled or confined to monasteries, and the clan's power broken. Samonas himself was richly rewarded: he was taken into the imperial service and rapidly promoted, becoming parakoimomenos by 908, before he too fell from favor.|$|E

25|$|Agonists produce significant, {{although}} mild, {{side effects}} including somnolence, hallucinations, insomnia, nausea, and constipation. Sometimes, side effects appear {{even at the}} minimal clinically efficacious dose, leading the physician {{to search for a}} different agonist or kind of drug. When compared with levodopa, while they delay motor complications, they control worse symptoms. Nevertheless, they are usually effective enough to manage symptoms in the initial years. They are also more expensive. Dyskinesias with dopamine agonists are rare in younger patients, but along other side effects, more common in older patients. <b>All</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> led to agonists being the preferential initial treatment for the former as opposed to levodopa in the latter. Agonists at higher doses have also been related {{to a wide variety of}} impulse-control disorders.|$|E

25|$|Galicia {{is one of}} {{the poorest}} regions in Central Europe, if not the poorest. It has few natural resources, few mineral deposits. The soil is not {{particularly}} fertile; the farming methods are primitive and the harvests meagre. The deeply rooted Galicians, especially Ruthenians (i.e. Ukrainians) in the eastern part are barely educated and live roughly; they are more backward than the Russian muzhik. <b>All</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> of course effected the economic condition of Galician Jews, who numbered between 900.000 and 1 million before the war. Even Jews in the Austrian Empire enjoy equal rights, with equal access to all the professions and government jobs, those in Galicia are very poor and unsophisticated. This is confirmed by two sets of statistics: Galicia has the highest death rate among Jews and the highest immigration to America.|$|E
25|$|Much of {{the catch}} is shrimp and sardines, with about three {{quarters}} exported to the United States. In 2002, the catch totaled 456,805 tons of seafood with a value of about 2,031 million pesos. In addition to what is caught at sea, there is active fish farming which raises mostly oysters and shrimp. Much of the commercial and sports fishing is essentially unregulated and has had a very pronounced impact on the Gulf of California, with commercially important species such as shrimp, groupers, snappers, corvinas, yellowtail, billfishes have been harvested well above sustainability. Two species which have been particularly hard hit are sharks and manta rays. In addition, shrimp trawling catches {{a large amount of}} non target species, which are discarded, and have destroyed large areas of the Gulf’s seafloor. <b>All</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> led to rapidly declining harvests.|$|E
500|$|A modern {{example of}} desert farming is the Imperial Valley in California, which has high {{temperatures}} and average rainfall of just [...] per year. [...] The economy is heavily based on agriculture {{and the land}} is irrigated through a network of canals and pipelines sourced entirely from the Colorado River via the All-American Canal. The soil is deep and fertile, {{being part of the}} river's flood plains, and what would otherwise have been desert has been transformed {{into one of the most}} productive farming regions in California. Other water from the river is piped to urban communities but <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> been at the expense of the river, which below the extraction sites no longer has any above-ground flow during most of the year. Another problem of growing crops in this way is the build-up of salinity in the soil caused by evaporation of river water. The greening of the desert remains an aspiration and was at one time viewed as a future means for increasing food production for the world's growing population. This prospect has proved false as it disregarded the environmental damage caused elsewhere by the diversion of water for desert project irrigation.|$|E

500|$|A third {{account was}} made by a private named John Shaw who was in Washington's regiment, but not present at the affair. [...] His account, based on {{detailed}} accounts from others who were present, was made in a sworn statement on August 21; the details on Tanacharison's role in the affair are confirmed in a newspaper account printed on June 27. [...] In his account, the French were surrounded while some still slept. [...] Alerted by a noise, one of the Frenchmen [...] "fired a Gun upon which Col. Washington gave the Word for all his Men to fire. [...] Several of them being killed, the rest betook themselves to flight, but our Indians haveing gone round the French ... they fled back to the English and delivered up their Arms ...

Jing can be lost in many ways, but most notably through the loss of body fluids. Taoists may use practices to stimulate/increase and conserve their bodily fluids to great extents. [...] The fluid believed to contain the most Jing is semen. Therefore, Taoists believe in decreasing the frequency of, or totally avoiding, ejaculation in order to conserve life essence.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{criticism}} {{that was made}} of Dewey as governor lay in his treatment of New York legislators and political opponents.

Others discover job-rich construction projects, state buildings, even highways, directed to friendlier [...]" [...] Dewey [...] "forced the legislature his own party dominates to reform its comfortable ways of payroll padding. Now legislative workers must verify in writing every two weeks what they have been doing to earn their salary; every state senator and assemblyman must verify that [...] are telling the truth. <b>All</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> occasioned more than grumbling.

2500|$|Verdi's response, {{which came}} right away was quite blunt: in {{addition}} to complaining of his age, his years of service, and raising other objections, he states: [...] "The conclusion is that <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> cast a chill over this Otello, and stiffened the hand that had begun to trace out a few bars!", but, in total contrast, Boito appears to have simply decided to carry on. Albeit [...] "somewhat disquieted", he immediately proposes [...] "a sort of evil Credo [...] I did... for my own comfort and personal satisfaction, because I felt the need of doing it". On 3 May, Verdi wrote back, calming this down: [...] "Most beautiful this Credo; most powerful and wholly Shakespearian.... it would be well to leave this Otello in peace for a bit.... "we shall {{be able to talk}} it over again, and by then with the necessary calm". Boito did visit Verdi in September for three days.|$|E
2500|$|Miller now {{considered}} the third question. The majority held {{that although the}} language of the two statutes of January 31, 1863, and February 4, 1863, were different, they had the same legal intent and force. Virginia showed [...] "good faith" [...] in holding the elections, Miller asserted. That the Reorganized Virginia legislature did not require vote totals to be reported to it and delegated the transmission of the vote totals to West Virginia was not at issue, Miller said. [...] It gave the Reorganized Governor discretion as to when and where to hold the votes, under what condition the votes should be held, and to certify the votes. The legislature acted within its power to delegate these duties to the Reorganized Governor, [...] "and his decision [...] conclusive as to the result." [...] Were these votes fair and regular? The Virginia Assembly, Miller noted, made only [...] "indefinite and vague" [...] allegations about vote fraud, and unspecified charges that somehow Governor Pierpont must have been [...] "misled and deceived" [...] by others into believing the voting was fair and regular. Miller pointedly observed that not a single person was charged with fraud, no specific act of fraud was stated, and no legal wrongs asserted. The Virginia Assembly also did not claim that the state of West Virginia interfered in the elections. Absent such allegations, Virginia's accusations cannot be sustained, Miller concluded. [...] But even if this aspect of Virginia's argument was ignored, Miller wrote, the Reorganized legislature had delegated all its power to certify to the election to Governor Pierpont, and he had certified it. That alone laid to rest Virginia's allegations. [...] " [...] must be bound by what she had done. She can have no right, years after <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>has</b> been settled, to come into a court of chancery to charge that her own conduct has been a wrong and a fraud; that her own subordinate agents have misled her governor, and that her solemn act transferring these counties shall be set aside, against the will of the State of West Virginia, and without consulting the wishes of the people of those counties." ...|$|E
