500|$|It was {{the first}} Once Upon a Time episode to be written by {{consulting}} producer Jane Espenson, while being directed by Paul Edwards. Espenson was [...] "thrilled" [...] to be assigned the episode; Jiminy Cricket was typically a character that appeared in other people's stories, so she was eager to explore him in his own narrative. Espenson especially wanted to depict how some, like Jiminy in this episode, [...] "have their adolescence well after adolescence. It took Jiminy {{a long time to}} figure out how to get away from the life he was living, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of people feel like that." [...] In addition, the episode contained several cultural references to the television series Lost and the Disney film One Hundred and One Dalmatians.|$|E
500|$|After the 2001 NPC, Crusaders' captain Todd Blackadder left New Zealand to play rugby in Scotland. During the 2002 Super 12 pre-season, half-back Justin Marshall {{questioned}} {{which of}} the senior players were going to step into Blackadder's leadership role for the tough matches. Hammett took the comment [...] "as {{a slap in the}} face", as [...] "one player doesn't make a team." [...] Hammett later said [...] "I took it that way, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of the others must have as well, because we all ended up stepping up!" [...] Subsequently, the Crusaders went through the season unbeaten, including a 96–19 victory over the New South Wales Waratahs. He again played for the All Blacks in 2002, starting against Australia and South Africa in the Tri-Nations. The 2002 NPC season was Hammett's last, and although Canterbury were knocked out in their semi-final, they managed to retain the Ranfurly Shield. Hammett's last match was his 76th for Canterbury.|$|E
500|$|In 1983 and 1984, Crass {{were part}} of the Stop the City actions co-ordinated by London Greenpeace which foreshadowed the {{anti-globalisation}} rallies of the early 21st century. Support for these activities was provided in the lyrics and sleeve notes of the band's last single, [...] "You're Already Dead", expressing doubts about their commitment to non-violence. It was also a reflection of disagreements within the group, as explained by Rimbaud; [...] "Half the band supported the pacifist line and half supported direct and if necessary violent action. It was a confusing time for us, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of our records show that, inadvertently". This led to introspection within the band, with some members becoming embittered and losing sight of their essentially positive stance. Reflecting this debate, the next release under the Crass name was Acts of Love: classical-music settings of 50 poems by Penny Rimbaud, described as [...] "songs to my other self" [...] and intended to celebrate [...] "the profound sense of unity, peace and love that exists within that other self".|$|E

60|$|She too, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> had {{forgotten}} {{these things for}} a while. For it is curious <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> very significant thing that since we had become lovers, we had talked {{very little of the}} broader things that had once so strongly gripped our imaginations.|$|R
5000|$|... "It’s {{time to go}} back to an {{idealized}} president—a well-articulated and idealized president," [...] said Howard Gordon. [...] "Her greatest flaw is her idealism. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that's <b>a</b> fun part to play. What happens when somebody's idealism butts up against the realpolitik of the world? But she's a very human character, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> very strong president and aspirational in the kind of way David Palmer was." [...] "It is an heroic administration. Cherry Jones plays the president brilliantly," [...] he continued.|$|R
500|$|The Eiland-Hall {{response}} brief cited {{a clip of}} Beck interviewing United States Congressman Keith Ellison, a Muslim from Minnesota. Beck had stated to U.S. Representative Ellison, [...] "No {{offense and}} I know Muslims, I like Muslims, I've been to mosques, I really don't think Islam is a religion of evil. I think it's being hijacked, quite frankly. With that being said, you are a Democrat. You are saying let's cut and run. And I have to tell you, I have been nervous about this interview because what I feel like saying is, sir, {{prove to me that}} you are not working with our enemies. And I know you’re not. I’m not accusing you of being an enemy. But that’s the way I feel, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of Americans will feel that way." [...] It was argued that this was an example of Beck's interview style in which he challenged his guests to prove a negative. Randazza concluded Beck's rhetorical style was similar to Gottfried's, simply devoid of comedic intent.|$|E
500|$|Mays has deemed Emma an [...] "amazing" [...] {{character}} to play, and has explained: [...] "I don't find that female characters are always written {{with a lot}} of depth, but she's so well defined on the page. Sure, she's terrified of germs and in love with a married man, so seeing her as the voice of reason for the kids is amazing." [...] Emma's relationship with Will will continue to grow, as [...] "she has these moments of clarity when she's talking to Will because he calms her." [...] Mays described her in an interview with TheTVChick: [...] "She is a romantic at heart. But she’s practical. She’s very interesting, because she does have those dreams and hopes of finding the right man. And in her mind, even though Will Schuester’s married, that sort of guy is like the perfect guy for her. She’s very practical in the fact that she doesn’t want to be alone and she knows that she’s somewhat limited in a small town to men. And Ken Tanaka is a very nice man, he’s not exactly like Will, but he’s good to her and he’s solid. He’s got a job, and he understands her and he understands all her quirks and stuff. So she’s practical, she knows that just might be her lot in life. So it’s weird. She’s got this very dreamy side about her and who she wants to be and what she wants her life to be like. But she’s also got this very practical, down-to-earth, well this is kind of the best I can do thing. It’s funny {{a lot of people have}} thought that part about her is weak. Like a weak character flaw, but I actually don’t think that’s true. I really just think that’s the practical side of her. I think that’s her being practical. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of people are like that sometimes." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{remember}} really vividly, you know, having {{pizza with}} my friends {{a day or two}} after—I opened up the first version of Facebook at the time I thought, [...] "You know, someone needs to build a service like this for the world." [...] But I just never thought that we'd be the ones to help do it. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of {{what it comes down to}} is we just cared more.|$|E
6000|$|... "And Ricardo has {{not seen}} her, whoever she may be. Besides, he can't {{possibly}} marry all of them. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> girl should consider herself lucky if she is saved from a dragon or a giant, without expecting to be married next day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This finicky {{criticism}} don't count. You {{might just}} as well talk about the lack of gondolas and old palaces in Boston. Conditions here are unexampled. It's <b>a</b> new town <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> splendid place to live. Of course you can find fault anywhere." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will never}} know {{anything}} of literature," [...] said I, when Jim had finished. [...] "That is a good, honest, plain piece of work, and tells the story clearly. I see only one mistake: the cook is not a Chinaman; he is <b>a</b> Kanaka, <b>and,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>a</b> Hawaiian." ...|$|R
2500|$|On November 14, 2006, Glenn Beck of CNN Headline News said to Ellison, [...] "I {{have been}} nervous about this {{interview}} with you, because what I feel like saying is, 'Sir, prove {{to me that}} you are not working with our enemies.' And I know you're not. I'm not accusing you of being an enemy, but that's the way I feel, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of Americans will feel that way." [...] Ellison replied that his constituents, [...] "know that I have a deep love and affection for my country. There's no one who's more patriotic than I am, and so you know, I don't need to — need to prove my patriotic stripes." ...|$|E

[...] In {{an interview with}} C-SPAN in 1987 Cockburn was questioned by a caller on this statement and he explained that [...] "it {{was a part of}} a satirical piece which was tasteless." [...] He went on to say [...] "I would ask you {{to look at some of}} the Mujahideen and how they treat women. They have virtual slavery of women. They are in favour of the bride price. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of people don't have a slightest of idea of social conditions in Afghanistan." [...] When asked about the same article on Afghanistan in 1995, Cockburn stated [...] "I shouldn't have ...|$|E
2500|$|On July 5, 2009, Colin Powell told CNN {{said that}} the policy was [...] "correct for the time" [...] but that [...] "sixteen years have now gone by, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> has changed with respect to attitudes within our country, and {{therefore}} I {{think this is a}} policy and a law that should be reviewed." [...] Interviewed for the same broadcast, Mullen said the policy would continue to be implemented until the law was repealed, and that his advice was to [...] "move in a measured way.... At a time when we're fighting two conflicts {{there is a great deal}} of pressure on our forces and their families." [...] In September, Joint Force Quarterly published an article by an Air Force colonel that disputed the argument that unit cohesion is compromised by the presence of openly gay personnel.|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly," [...] Cartwright agreed. [...] "However, {{it looks}} as if some {{engineering}} talent is all he has got, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> long voyage is indicated--" [...] He stopped, and resumed with a twinkle: [...] "For all that, the fellow is not an adventurer, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> married a rich woman." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have only}} been in it once, {{but it has been}} so exactly {{described}} to me that I could find the right room with my eyes shut. She is a timid old woman, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> pistol pointed at her head will get the secret out of her at once." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If you are {{resolved}} on acting," [...] replied the persevering Edmund, [...] "I must {{hope it will}} be in a very small and quiet way; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> theatre ought not to be attempted. It would be taking liberties with my father's house in his absence which could not be justified." ...|$|R
2500|$|Lynch {{has said}} that he is [...] "not a {{political}} person". However, he has expressed admiration for former US President Ronald Reagan. Describing his political philosophy, he stated, [...] "at that time, I thought of myself as a libertarian. I believed in next to zero government. And I still would lean toward no government and not so many rules, except for traffic lights and things like this. I really believe in traffic regulations." [...] Lynch continued to state that [...] "I don't know if there even is a Libertarian party. They wouldn't have a prayer of getting anywhere. So I'm a Democrat now. And I've always been a Democrat, really. But I don't like the Democrats a lot, either, because I'm a smoker, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of the Democrats have come up with these rules for non-smoking." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the topic}} of Sheila and Lauren's [...] "cat fights", Brown said: [...] "People like cat fights because we {{can get away with}} what you can't get away with in {{everyday}} life. You're living vicariously through me. There might be someone that [...] you just might want to put it to someday, and you can't, but you can turn on the TV and see Sheila do it, and get away with it. Being mean and evil and fighting {{and by the end of}} the day, you're spent." [...] On {{the topic of}} Sheila [...] "terrorizing" [...] both Genoa City and Los Angeles while on both soaps, Brown said: [...] "You know, I came to L.A. to start a new life. And well they just didn't make it that easy for me, did they? So I might've shot a gun once or twice again, but it wasn't my fault. You know what, people get what they deserve, they really do. I might've poisoned someone by accident, but he never should've talked to me like that. You just don't do that. Anyway, people get what they deserve, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of them have what's coming to them, and I'm not sure I'm done yet." [...] About Sheila's personality, Brown said: [...] "Sheila's just evil. There's nothing bitchy about what she does, [...] it's very straightforward. She's manipulative but never in a bitchy way, in a way to get things accomplished, and get things done the way she wants to. When being nice and being diplomatic and when being all those things don't work any longer, she snaps." [...] On Sheila's relationship with Stephanie Forrester, Brown said: [...] "Stephanie made my life miserable. So anyway, I shot Stephanie. I did. Stephanie felt she could be a better provider for my child than I could. And you know what, you don't keep a mother like Sheila away from her child, you just don't do that. And Stephanie couldn't stop me." [...] Brown also added that, [...] "To be a good villain, you have to make the character real for you." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Writing is {{a lonely}} profession. Teaching gives my life {{a kind of}} resonance. It's nice to reaffirm the idea that you're part of something, that you {{contribute}} to other people's understanding of things directly. There's {{a sense of being}} part of a community, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of writers don't have that." ...|$|E
5000|$|Corman sent Francis Ford Coppola to Big Sur {{for three}} days to shoot {{additional}} footage. He ended up staying eleven days. Monte Hellman, Jack Hill, Dennis Jacob and Jack Nicholson also directed some scenes.

6000|$|The Governor {{looked puzzled}} for an instant. He {{could not quite}} {{remember}} {{what had happened to}} those jovial men who had cheered him over night. Judson interrupted swiftly: [...] "His Excellency has set them to forced works on barracks <b>and</b> magazines, <b>and,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>a</b> custom-house. When that is done they will be released, I hope, Excellency." ...|$|R

5000|$|Kozlowski, {{commenting on}} his trial in a March 2007 {{interview}} with the CBS television newsmagazine 60 Minutes, told Morley Safer, [...] "I was a guy sitting in a courtroom making $100 million <b>a</b> year <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> juror sitting there just would have to say, 'All that money?

5000|$|In an interview, Edele {{talked about}} her bond with her twin: [...] "She's the {{greatest}} gift I've ever been given, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of identical twins would say that. She really is my other half, and I'm not the same without her.

I missed her." ...|$|E

Grohl noted: [...] "That's the thing with lyrics, {{you never want to}} give away specifics, because it's nice for people to have their own idea or interpretation of the song.
