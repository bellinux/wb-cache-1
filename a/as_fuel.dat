5|$|Cast iron {{was first}} {{produced}} in China during 5th century BC, but was hardly in Europe until the medieval period. The earliest cast iron artifacts were discovered by archaeologists {{in what is}} now modern Luhe County, Jiangsu in China. Cast iron was used in ancient China for warfare, agriculture, and architecture. During the medieval period, means were found in Europe of producing wrought iron from cast iron (in this context known as pig iron) using finery forges. For all these processes, charcoal was required <b>as</b> <b>fuel.</b>|$|E

Wood, coal and oil are used <b>as</b> <b>fuel</b> for production of energy and heating. Gem quality diamond is used in jewelry, and industrial diamonds are used in drilling, cutting and polishing tools for machining metals and stone. Plastics are made from fossil hydrocarbons, and carbon fiber, made by pyrolysis of synthetic polyester fibers is used to reinforce plastics to form advanced, lightweight composite materials.|$|E
5|$|Coke as fuel: By the 11th century, {{during the}} Song Dynasty (960–1279), {{the demands for}} {{charcoal}} used in the blast and cupola furnaces of the iron industry led to large amounts of deforestation of prime timberland; to avoid excessive deforestation, the Song Chinese began using coke made from bituminous coal <b>as</b> <b>fuel</b> for their metallurgic furnaces instead of charcoal derived from wood.|$|E
5|$|Freshmen were {{expected}} to build the early Bonfires to help prove their worth. For almost two decades, the students constructed Bonfire from debris and wood acquired through various, sometimes illicit, means, including appropriating lumber intended for a dormitory in 1912. In 1935, a farmer reported that students carried off his entire barn <b>as</b> <b>fuel</b> for Bonfire. To prevent future incidents, the university made Bonfire a school-sanctioned event. The following year, for the first time, the school provided axes, saws, and trucks for the students and pointed them toward a grove of dead trees {{on the edge of}} town.|$|E
30|$|Bioliquids may be {{transformed}} {{for use in}} engines or used directly <b>as</b> <b>fuels</b> in burners. When used <b>as</b> <b>fuels</b> in burners, certain advantages are evident such as (a) requiring no specific transformation processes, thereby enabling them to be obtained relatively cheaply; (b) less rigorous specifications when used in burners than when used in engines; and (c) {{a wider range of}} technologies linked to burners than to heat engines. In addition, burners have a wider range of regulation vis-à-vis fuel than heat engines [4].|$|R
50|$|Throughout history, {{alcohols}} {{have been}} used <b>as</b> a <b>fuel.</b> The first four aliphatic alcohols (methanol, ethanol, propanol, and butanol)are of interest <b>as</b> <b>fuels</b> {{because they can be}} synthesized chemically or biologically, and they have characteristics which allow them to be used in internal combustion engines.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper the author {{describes}} the research carried out at the University of Sassari on the utilization <b>as</b> <b>fuels</b> or chemical feedstocks of oils derived from plants. Examination of the results obtained with oils derived from Euphorbiae vegetanting in Sardinia suggests to orient the studies toward the isolation of fine chemicals rather then toward the utilization <b>as</b> <b>fuels,</b> directly or after pyrolysis. This conclusion {{is supported by the}} comparison of data on three Sardinian Euphorbiae and by considerations on the Sardinian land...|$|R
5|$|Like most Old World warblers, {{this small}} species is insectivorous, moving restlessly though foliage or briefly hovering. It has been {{recorded}} as taking insects, mainly flies, from more than 50 families, along with other small and medium-sized invertebrates. It will take the eggs and larvae of butterflies and moths, particularly those of the winter moth. The chiffchaff has been estimated to require about one-third of its weight in insects daily, and it feeds almost continuously in the autumn to put on extra fat <b>as</b> <b>fuel</b> for the long migration flight.|$|E
5|$|New Zealand {{units were}} to be capped in number and {{were to be}} {{allocated}} to participants either by grandparenting (gifting) or auctioning. Sectors of the economy were to have progressively entered the NZ ETS, with forestry the first from January 2008 and agriculture last in January 2013. Allocation rules varied between sectors. In general, participants who could pass on costs of the ETS, such <b>as</b> <b>fuel</b> companies, would not be allocated free units. Participants such as exporters with products that are priced internationally, would be allocated free units.|$|E
5|$|STAC {{stated that}} an SST would have {{economic}} performance similar to existing subsonic types. Although they would burn more fuel in cruise, {{they would be}} able to fly more sorties in a given period of time, so fewer aircraft would be needed to service a particular route.

5|$|Sai Tso Wan Recreation Ground {{was built}} between 1995 and 2004 over the former Sai Tso Wan Landfill. During the construction, the former {{landfill}} underwent {{a series of}} restoration works. A final capping layer was added to prevent leakage; a landfill gas control system was used to deploy methane from the decomposed rubbish <b>as</b> <b>fuel,</b> and a leachate management system was built to collect leachate for further processing. The recreation ground started its operation on 30 April 2004.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemically}} resistant (but expensive) fluorinated ionomers {{are used as}} electrochemical cell membranes, of which {{the first and most}} prominent example is Nafion. Developed in the 1960s, it was initially deployed <b>as</b> <b>fuel</b> cell material in spacecraft and then replaced mercury-based chloralkali process cells. Recently, the fuel cell application has reemerged with efforts to install proton exchange membrane fuel cells into automobiles. Fluoroelastomers such as Viton are crosslinked fluoropolymer mixtures mainly used in O-rings; perfluorobutane (C4F10) is used as a fire-extinguishing agent.|$|E
5|$|There was {{in various}} transatlantic {{countries}} such {{an abundance of}} maize, that the farmers had to burn it <b>as</b> <b>fuel</b> in their railway engines.

All this, while thirty million people in the Volga region—not far away and easily reached by our ships—were allowed to starve and die.|$|E
40|$|Waste {{oils and}} fats can be used <b>as</b> {{renewable}} <b>fuel</b> resources. Conversion of waste {{oils and fats}} to biodiesel fuel is one possibility but poses some difficulties {{such as in the}} use of toxic or caustic materials and by product disposal. Conversion to biodiesel may also decrease the economic attractiveness of using waste oils <b>as</b> <b>fuels.</b> An alternative to the use of biodiesel is the use of vegetable oils or rendered animal fats <b>as</b> a <b>fuel.</b> Using relatively unmodified oils or fats eliminates the problem associated with toxic and caustic precursor chemicals and residual biodiesel alkalinity as the oil is used without altering its chemical properties. This paper discusses the use of waste vegetable and animal oils and fats <b>as</b> unmodified <b>fuels</b> in compression ignition engines...|$|R

5|$|What the Iroquois {{wanted was}} not war, but instead a better {{share of the}} fur trade. To serve as {{punishment}} for attacks on French fur fleets, New France ordered two expeditions under Courcelles and Tracy into Mohawk territory in 1666. These expeditions burned villages and destroyed much of the Mohawk winter corn supply. In addition, Denonville’s 1687 invasion of the Seneca nation country destroyed approximately 1,200,000 bushels of corn, crippling the Iroquois economy. This kind of aggression served <b>as</b> <b>fuel</b> for the Iroquois’ retaliation that was to come.|$|E
