25|$|In April 1898, The New York Times {{reported}} on a rescue at sea accomplished by La Bretagnes crew that had happened late the previous month. Encountering the dismasted British bark Bothnia, the crew of La Bretagne effected rescue of the stricken ship's master and ten surviving crewmen. The crew then used carrier pigeons to announce the rescue. The carrier pigeons were being carried aboard La Bretagne as a trial program under the watch of a French Army officer, after the CGT liner La Champagne broke her propeller shaft and was adrift for five days in February without <b>any</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> communicating her predicament.|$|E
25|$|I {{emphasize}} the violent and iconoclastic {{aspect of this}} painting because it is usually enshrined as the great formal exercise which was {{the starting point of}} Cubism. It was the starting point of Cubism, in so far as it prompted Braque to begin painting {{at the end of the}} year his own far more formal answer to Les Demoiselles d’Avignon…yet if he had been left to himself, this picture would never have led Picasso to Cubism or to <b>any</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> painting remotely resembling it…It has nothing to with that twentieth-century vision of the future which was the essence of Cubism.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{phenomena}} in quantum mechanics, such as quantum entanglement, might give the superficial impression of allowing {{communication of information}} faster than light. According to the no-communication theorem these phenomena do not allow true communication; they only let two observers in different locations see the same system simultaneously, without <b>any</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> controlling what either sees. Wavefunction collapse {{can be viewed as}} an epiphenomenon of quantum decoherence, which in turn is nothing more than an effect of the underlying local time evolution of the wavefunction of a system and all of its environment. Since the underlying behaviour does not violate local causality or allow FTL it follows that neither does the additional effect of wavefunction collapse, whether real or apparent.|$|E

25|$|Others such as Francis Collins, Kenneth R. Miller, George Coyne and Francisco J. Ayala {{argue for}} {{compatibility}} {{since they do}} not agree that science is incompatible with religion and vice versa. They argue that science provides many opportunities to look for and find God in nature and {{to reflect on their}} beliefs. According to Kenneth Miller, he disagrees with Jerry Coyne's assessment and argues that since significant portions of scientists are religious and the proportion of Americans believing in evolution is much higher, it implies that both are indeed compatible. Elsewhere, Miller has argued that when scientists make claims on science and theism or atheism, they are not arguing scientifically at all and are stepping beyond the scope of science into discourses of meaning and purpose. What he finds particularly odd and unjustified is in how atheists often come to invoke scientific authority on their non-scientific philosophical conclusions like there being no point or no meaning to the universe as the only viable option when the scientific method and science never have had <b>any</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> addressing questions of meaning or God in the first place. Furthermore, he notes that since evolution made the brain and since the brain can handle both religion and science, there is no natural incompatibility between the concepts at the biological level.|$|E
500|$|Rajab {{pleaded not}} guilty to the charge against him, but the {{prosecutor}} decided to keep him in detention for 7 days. On 12 May, the public prosecution extended his detention by one week. On 16 May, fifty-five lawyers were present in court in solidarity with Rajab who [...] {{pleaded not guilty}} again and stated that the charge against him was [...] "malicious". Despite being granted bail on 20 May, Rajab was kept in detention on a further charge of [...] "organizing illegal protests". Activists accused the Bahraini authorities of trying to find <b>any</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> keeping Rajab off the streets.|$|E
500|$|Other themes {{prevalent}} in the episode include Lori's pregnancy. After getting into a heated argument, Rick reveals to Shane about her pregnancy.

[...] He continued: [...] "Bringing that up to his wife, who he loves, is only going to be painful for her.

[...] In 1984, he earned his bachelor's degree in natural-resource {{planning}} and interpretation, with an emphasis in marine resources. He intended to take a master's degree, but {{said it would be}} in art: [...] "Initially I think I assumed that if I went to school for art I would never have <b>any</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> making a living, so I thought it might be smarter to keep art my passion and hobby and study something else. But by the time I got to the end of my undergrad work, I realized I should be in art." ...|$|E
500|$|Not all reviews were so positive. Author Phil Farrand was {{critical}} of the episode, rating it his fifth least favorite episode of the first four seasons. He criticized the entry for having an uninteresting first half, and relying on the [...] "cliche" [...] of the John F. Kennedy assassination. Furthermore, he was unhappy {{with the fact that}} viewers did not have <b>any</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> knowing whether the content of the episode really happened. Alan Kurtz criticized the episode for being inconsistent with the timetable of The X-Files, pointing {{to the fact that the}} episode contradicts canon that was established in the third season episode [...] "Apocrypha". Furthermore, he derided the show for too closely mirroring the plots of the 1979 movie Apocalypse Now as well as Forrest Gump.|$|E
500|$|Though saloon-keeper Andrew Mehan {{had seen}} Tom deposit his pistol after his beating by Earp {{and before the}} gunfight, none of the Earps had <b>any</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> knowing that Tom had left his {{revolver}} at the saloon. Hotel keeper Albert [...] "Chris" [...] Billickie, whose father Charles owned the Cosmopolitan Hotel, saw Tom McLaury enter Bauer's butcher shop about 2:00p.m. He testified that Tom's right-hand pants pocket was flat when he went in but protruded, as if it contained a pistol (so he thought), when he emerged. Retired army surgeon Dr. J. W. Gardiner also testified that he saw the bulge in Tom's pants. However, the bulge in Tom's pants pocket {{may have been the}} nearly $3,300 in cash and receipts found on his body, perhaps in payment for stolen Mexican beef purchased by the butcher.|$|E

[...] Barry Didcock from Sunday Herald felt that [...] "Morton [...] to find the face of Madonna." [...] He criticized Morton's sketchy portrayal of Madonna's relationship with deceased painter Jean-Michel Basquiat, saying [...] "he commits an error by doing so because, unusually for Madonna, this was a relationship of equals." [...] Gregg Barrios from Daily Star was critical of the book, saying [...] " [...] The fatal flaw of these quickie knockoffs {{is that they have}} no real ending or <b>any</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> predicting what the fates have in store for Madonna Louise Penn [...] nee Ciccone. Once the next Madonna tour, CD, marriage or film appears, their shelf life is cut short." [...] Barbara Ellen from The Guardian criticized Morton's writing by saying, [...] "Andrew Morton achieves the implausible: he takes an interesting woman and an astonishing life and makes them both seem incredibly boring in his life of Madonna.... Once you get used to Morton's pace (dull plod, with occasional snooze), it becomes quite amusing joining him on the journey, a bit like watching someone dragging a dead body around, trying to find some place to hide it. Even luminaries such as Madonna exes Sean Penn and Warren Beatty are reduced to flailing around like disenfranchised phantoms in the shallows of Morton's blandly automatic insight." ...|$|E

2500|$|The series {{consisted}} of thirteen programmes, each fifty minutes long, written and presented by Clark, covering western European civilisation {{from the end}} of the Dark Ages to the early twentieth century. As the civilisation under consideration excluded Graeco-Roman, Chinese and other historically important cultures, a title was chosen that disclaimed comprehensiveness: Civilisation: A Personal View by Kenneth Clark. Although it focused chiefly on the visual arts and architecture, there were substantial sections about drama, literature, philosophy and socio-political movements. Clark wanted to include more about law and philosophy, but [...] "I could not think of <b>any</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> making them visually interesting." ...|$|E

According to Price, various Jesus images flowed together at the origin of Christianity, some of them possibly based on myth, some of them possibly based on [...] "a historical Jesus the Nazorean". Price admits uncertainty in this regard, writing in conclusion: [...] "There may have been a real figure there, but there is simply no longer <b>any</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> being sure".|$|E
