40|$|International audienceWe {{explore a}} {{practical}} approach {{to learn a}} plausible causal Bayesian network {{from a combination of}} non-experimental data and qualitative assumptions that are deemed likely by health experts. The method is based on the incorporation of prior expert knowledge in the form of partial pairwise ordering constraints between variables into a recent constraint-based Bayesian network structure learning algorithm. The learning process ends up with a partially oriented graph. The remaining undirected edges are then oriented according to the expert understanding. We show that the causal graph not only provides a statistical profile of the population under study but also offers a simple guideline principle to identify <b>accessible</b> sets of <b>confounding</b> <b>variables</b> for each causal relation under interest. To illustrate the potential of the proposed approach, we estimate the strength of the causal effect of psychotropic drugs, gait speed, body mass index and bone mineral density on the risk of hip fracture from a prospective cohort study EPIDOS sample, which included more than 7500 elderly osteoporotic women followed-up during 4 years. Our findings suggest that an intervention programme aimed at preventing physical deterioration and maintaining bone mass density should tend {{to reduce the risk of}} hip fracture among elderly...|$|R
30|$|Every {{potential}} <b>confounding</b> <b>variable</b> {{which was}} found to have a significant association with nationality from the univariate model was then tested for its confounding effect using linear regression. The <b>confounding</b> <b>variables</b> for each dependent variable were identified by testing a model in which each <b>confounding</b> <b>variable</b> was entered one at a time, with the first step being nationality and the second step nationality plus one potential <b>confounding</b> <b>variable.</b> When the effect of nationality was attenuated by the inclusion of any single <b>confounding</b> <b>variable,</b> multi-predictors (confounders) models were then utilized to show the collective confounding effects on each dependent measure: nationality was entered in the first step, and in the second, nationality plus all of the <b>confounding</b> <b>variables.</b> To assess how much effect of nationality from the univariate model (i.e., one-way ANOVAs) was accounted for by the <b>confounding</b> <b>variables,</b> squared semipartial correlations of nationality from the first and second steps in the multi-predictors (confounders) models were evaluated.|$|R
30|$|Thus, for outgroup attitude, ingroup bias, and job effectiveness, {{the effect}} of {{nationality}} was shared by the <b>confounding</b> <b>variables</b> {{to the extent that}} a significant effect disappeared when <b>confounding</b> <b>variables</b> were taken into account.

This blocking can be done either by adding the <b>confounding</b> <b>variable</b> as a control in regression, or by matching on the <b>confounding</b> <b>variable.</b>|$|R
30|$|Five <b>confounding</b> <b>variables,</b> i.e., gender, years lived abroad, years {{worked with}} {{cultural}} outgroup members, age, and acculturation strategies, {{were found to}} act significantly {{in at least two}} of the independent-dependent variable associations and to correlate with the dependent variables in those associations. In this section, the results for each of these <b>confounding</b> <b>variables</b> are scrutinized in light of findings about the same variables in the literature, with the goal of gaining deeper insight into the relationship between these <b>confounding</b> <b>variables</b> and the acculturation outcomes of interest in this paper. Moreover, the implications of the recurring significance of these <b>confounding</b> <b>variables</b> are considered, and recommendations offered for future research.|$|R
30|$|Finally, to {{gain insight}} into how the <b>confounding</b> <b>variables</b> {{associated}} with the dependent measures, {{in a series of}} post-hoc tests, one-way ANOVAs (for categorical variables) and correlations (for continuous variables) were utilized to ascertain the significance and directionality of each <b>confounding</b> <b>variable’s</b> association with its dependent variable.|$|R
30|$|For outgroup attitude, when {{comparing}} nationality’s semipartial correlation {{on its own}} and with that {{of all of the}} <b>confounding</b> <b>variables</b> at once, calculations indicated that 79.5 % of the variance associated with nationality was accounted for by the <b>confounding</b> <b>variables.</b> After this shared variance was removed from the effect, the national difference was no longer significant. In the model with all of the <b>confounding</b> <b>variables,</b> 82.8 % of the variance associated with nationality was accounted for by the <b>confounding</b> <b>variables,</b> and once this shared variance was removed, the national difference for ingroup bias was no longer significant. In the model for investiture, 27.0 % of the variance associated with nationality was shared by level of education, and there was a minimal confounding effect, as nationality was significant at p[*]<[*]. 01 in both steps and the beta values were almost unchanged. For job effectiveness, 99.9 % of the variance associated with nationality was accounted for by the <b>confounding</b> <b>variables,</b> and once this shared variance was removed, the effect of nationality was no longer significant.|$|R

40|$|A {{frequent}} {{concern in}} making statistical inference for causal {{effects of a}} policy or treatment based on observational studies {{is that there are}} unmeasured <b>confounding</b> <b>variables.</b> The instrumental variable method is an approach to estimating a causal relationship in the presence of unmeasured <b>confounding</b> <b>variables.</b> A valid instrumental variable needs to be independent of the unmeasured <b>confounding</b> <b>variables.</b> It is important to control for the <b>confounding</b> <b>variable</b> if it is correlated with the instrument. In health services research, socioeconomic status variables are often considered as <b>confounding</b> <b>variables.</b> In recent studies, distance to a specialty care center has been used as an instrument for the effect of specialty care vs. general care. Because the instrument may be correlated with socioeconomic status variables, it is important that socioeconomic status variables are controlled for in the instrumental variables regression. However, health data sets often lack individual socioeconomic information but contain area average socioeconomic information from the US Census, e. g., average income or education level in a county. We study the effects on the bias of the two stage least squares estimates in instrumental variables regression when using an area-level variable as a controlled <b>confounding</b> <b>variable</b> that may be correlated with the instrument. We propose the aggregated instrumental variables regression using the concept of Wald’s method of grouping, provided the assumption that the grouping is independent of the errors.

Two hundred sequentially reported ADR's were included in this study. An independent researcher used algorithms, while an expert panel assessed the same reports using the GI, both aimed at evaluating causality. Reports were divided into three groups according to the presence, absence or lack of information on <b>confounding</b> <b>variables.</b> For the total sample, observed agreements between decisional algorithms compared with GI varied from 21 % to 56 %, average of 47 %. When <b>confounding</b> <b>variables</b> were taken into account, agreements varied between 41 % and 69 %, average of 58 %; 8 % and 65 %, average of 46 % and 15 % and 53 %, average of 42 % accordingly to the absence, lack of information or presence of <b>confounding</b> <b>variables,</b> respectively. The extend of reproducibility beyond chance was low for the total sample (average Kappa =  0. 26) and within the groups considered. The overall observed agreement between algorithm and GI was moderate although poorly different from chance, <b>confounding</b> <b>variables</b> being a shortcoming of algorithms ability in assessing causality.

40|$|Abstract Background Metabolomics is an {{emerging}} high-throughput approach to systems biology, but data analysis tools are lacking {{compared to other}} systems level disciplines such as transcriptomics and proteomics. Metabolomic data analysis requires a normalization step to remove systematic effects of <b>confounding</b> <b>variables</b> on metabolite measurements. Current tools may not correctly normalize every metabolite when the relationships between each metabolite quantity and fixed-effect <b>confounding</b> <b>variables</b> are different, or {{for the effects of}} random-effect <b>confounding</b> <b>variables.</b> Linear mixed models, an established methodology in the microarray literature, offer a standardized and flexible approach for removing the effects of fixed- and random-effect <b>confounding</b> <b>variables</b> from metabolomic data. Findings Here we present a simple menu-driven program, “MetabR”, designed to aid researchers with no programming background in statistical analysis of metabolomic data. Written in the open-source statistical programming language R, MetabR implements linear mixed models to normalize metabolomic data and analysis of variance (ANOVA) to test treatment differences. MetabR exports normalized data, checks statistical model assumptions, identifies differentially abundant metabolites, and produces output files to help with data interpretation. Example data are provided to illustrate normalization for common <b>confounding</b> <b>variables</b> and to demonstrate the utility of the MetabR program. Conclusions We developed MetabR as a simple and user-friendly tool for implementing linear mixed model-based normalization and statistical analysis of targeted metabolomic data, which helps to fill a lack of available data analysis tools in this field.

40|$|In {{observational}} studies, {{selection of}} <b>confounding</b> <b>variables</b> for adjustment is {{often based on}} observed baseline incomparability. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate this selection strategy. We used clinical data on the effects of inhaled long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) use on the risk of mortality among patients with obstructive pulmonary disease to illustrate the impact of selection of <b>confounding</b> <b>variables</b> for adjustment based on baseline comparisons. Among 2, 394 asthma and COPD patients included in the analyses, the LABA ever-users were considerably older than never-users, but cardiovascular co-morbidity was equally prevalent (19. 9 % vs. 19. 9 %). Adjustment for cardiovascular co-morbidity status did not affect the crude risk ratio (RR) for mortality: crude RR 1. 19 (95 % CI 0. 93 – 1. 51) versus RR 1. 19 (95 % CI 0. 94 – 1. 50) after adjustment for cardiovascular co-morbidity. However, after adjustment for age (RR 0. 95, 95 % CI 0. 76 – 1. 19), additional adjustment for cardiovascular co-morbidity status did affect the association between LABA use and mortality (RR 1. 01, 95 % CI 0. 80 – 1. 26). <b>Confounding</b> <b>variables</b> should not be discarded based on balanced distributions among exposure groups, because residual confounding due to the omission of <b>confounding</b> <b>variables</b> from the adjustment model can be relevant...|$|R

In exercise and sports-science research and routine testing, internal validity is commonly achieved by controlling variables such as exercise and warm-up protocols, prior training, nutritional intake before testing, ambient temperature, time of testing, hours of sleep, age, and gender. However, a number of other potential <b>confounding</b> <b>variables</b> often do not receive adequate attention in sports physiology and performance research. These <b>confounding</b> <b>variables</b> include instructions on how to perform the test, volume and frequency of verbal encouragement, knowledge of exercise endpoint, number and gender of observers in the room, influence of music played before and during testing, and the effects of mental fatigue on performance.

40|$|It {{is argued}} that as the major {{occupational}} cancer risks become matters of historical interest, research epidemiologists {{working in the field}} should broaden their approaches to encompass life style factors. In the investigation of possible low-cancer risks, it no longer makes any sense to confine their data-collecting activities solely to exposure to dusts and chemicals at work and to regard exposure to chemicals at home, in the garden or during leisure activities simply as possible <b>confounding</b> <b>variables.</b> Furthermore it {{is becoming more and more}} meaningless to undertake any epidemiological investigation aimed at detecting or defining a low level of cancer risk without taking into account what and how much, for example, people eat, drink and smoke.
