5|$|Congestion pricing is {{a concept}} from market {{economics}} {{regarding the use of}} pricing mechanisms to charge the users of public goods for the negative externalities generated by the peak demand in excess of available supply. Its economic rationale is that, at a price of zero, demand exceeds supply, causing a shortage, and that the shortage should be corrected by charging the equilibrium price rather than shifting it down by increasing the supply. Usually this means increasing prices during certain periods of time or at the places where congestion occurs; or introducing a new usage tax or charge when peak demand exceeds available supply {{in the case of a}} tax-funded public good provided free <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> usage.|$|E

5|$|From {{around the}} 1950s onwards, {{breeding}} resumed in Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand. New plants were produced by crossing among the species and existing cultivars of S. truncata, S. russelliana and the hybrid S. × buckleyi. Treatments which induced mutations were also used. The {{result was a}} wide range of flower colours which had not been available before, including the first true yellow to be sold commercially, S. 'Gold Charm' (which was a sterile triploid). Breeders aimed for plants which grew strongly, were upright <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> sale rather than pendulous, had many flowers or buds, and were adapted to living as house plants.|$|E
5|$|If two {{disjoint}} smooth simple closed curves {{undergo the}} curve-shortening flow simultaneously, they remain disjoint as the flow progresses. The reason is that, if two smooth curves {{move in a}} way that creates a crossing, then at the time of first crossing the curves would necessarily be tangent to each other, without crossing. But, in such a situation, the two curves' curvatures <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> tangency would necessarily pull them apart rather than pushing them together into a crossing. For the same reason, a single simple closed curve can never evolve to cross itself. This phenomenon is known as the avoidance principle.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, NATO issued NATO Basic Military Requirement 3 (NBMR-3) which {{specified}} a VTOL aircraft, {{albeit one}} with the supersonic performance of an aircraft such as the F-4 Phantom II, along with the VTOL capability. Recognising that the P.1127 would not satisfy this, Hawker commenced work upon a new project, designated P.1150, which was effectively a supersonic derivative of the P.1127, as well as another version, designated P.1154, which would meet the specified requirements of NBMR-3. The P.1154 was declared {{the winner of the}} NATO competition; prototype construction was already underway <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> cancellation in 1965.

5|$|Intense {{tropical}} cyclones pose {{a particular}} observation challenge, {{as they are}} a dangerous oceanic phenomenon, and weather stations, being relatively sparse, are rarely available {{on the site of}} the storm itself. In general, surface observations are available only if the storm is passing over an island or a coastal area, or if there is a nearby ship. Real-time measurements are usually taken in the periphery of the cyclone, where conditions are less catastrophic and its true strength cannot be evaluated. For this reason, there are teams of meteorologists that move into the path of tropical cyclones to help evaluate their strength <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> landfall.|$|E

5|$|Like {{other members}} of the genus Sepioteuthis, bigfin reef squids are easy to {{distinguish}} from other squids in that they possess thick and muscular oval fins that extend around almost the entire mantle. The fins extend about 83 to 97% of the mantle length and are 67 to 70% of the mantle length in width. Because of these fins, bigfin reef squids are sometimes mistaken for cuttlefish, a fact reflected by their scientific names.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the differentiability properties of real-valued quasiconvex functions f defined on a separable Banach space X. Continuity is only assumed to hold <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> a dense subset. If so, this subset is automatically residual. Sample results {{that can be}} quoted without involving any new concept or nomenclature are as follows: (i) If f is usc or strictly quasiconvex, then f is Hadamard differentiable <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> a dense subset of X (ii) If f is even, then f is continuous and Gateaux differentiable <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> a dense subset of X. In (i) or (ii), the dense subset need not be residual but, if X is also reflexive, it contains the complement of a Haar null set. Furthermore, (ii) remains true without the evenness requirement if the definition of Gateaux differentiability is generalized in an unusual, but ultimately natural, way. The full results are much more general and substantially stronger. In particular, they incorporate the well known theorem of Crouzeix, {{to the effect that}} every real-valued quasiconvex function on R^N is Frechet differentiable a. e...|$|R
