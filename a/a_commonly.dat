5|$|<b>A</b> <b>commonly</b> cited quote by Ralph Nader {{states that}} {{a pound of}} {{plutonium}} dust spread into the atmosphere {{would be enough to}} kill 8 billion people. However, calculations show that one pound of plutonium could kill no more than 2 million people by inhalation. This makes the toxicity of plutonium roughly equivalent with that of nerve gas. Nader's views were challenged in 1976 by Bernard Cohen, as described in the book Nuclear Power, Both Sides: The Best Arguments for and Against the Most Controversial Technology. Cohen's own estimate is that a dose of 200micrograms would likely be necessary to cause cancer.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>commonly</b> studied {{variation}} of the problem involves networks of interior-disjoint smooth curves, with junctions where three {{or more of the}} curves meet. When the junctions all have exactly three curves meeting at angles of 2/3 (the same conditions seen in an optimal Steiner tree or two-dimensional foam of soap bubbles) the flow is well-defined for the short term. However, it may eventually reach a singular state with four or more curves meeting at a junction, and there may be {{more than one way to}} continue the flow past such a singularity.|$|E
5|$|Amending the UN Charter, {{possibly}} {{through a}} Charter Review Conference under Article 109 of the UN Charter, is <b>a</b> <b>commonly</b> cited possibility. This {{is difficult because}} it requires ratification by two-thirds of UN members, including all five {{permanent members of the}} Security Council. There have been only five amendments to the UN Charter since 1945, and none of them were done through the Article 109 process. Louis Sohn and Grenville Clark, in their 1958 book World Peace Through World Law, proposed establishing a UN Parliamentary Assembly through this method.|$|E

5|$|Edible {{mushrooms}} are well-known examples of fungi. Many are commercially raised, but others must be harvested from the wild. Agaricus bisporus, sold as button mushrooms when small or Portobello mushrooms when larger, is <b>a</b> <b>commonly</b> eaten species, used in salads, soups, {{and many other}} dishes. Many Asian fungi are commercially grown and have increased in popularity in the West.

5|$|In 1755, Benedict Arnold was {{attracted}} {{by the sound of}} a drummer and attempted to enlist in the provincial militia for service against the French, but his mother refused permission. In 1757 when he was sixteen, he did enlist in the Connecticut militia, which marched off toward Albany and Lake George. The French had besieged Fort William Henry in northeastern New York, and their Indian allies had committed atrocities after their victory. Word of the siege's disastrous outcome led the company to turn around; Arnold served for 13 days. <b>A</b> <b>commonly</b> accepted story that Arnold deserted from militia service in 1758 is based on uncertain documentary evidence.|$|E

5|$|In {{material}} sciences, many complicated inorganic and organometallic {{systems have}} been analyzed using single-crystal methods, such as fullerenes, metalloporphyrins, and other complicated compounds. Single-crystal diffraction is also used in the pharmaceutical industry, due to recent problems with polymorphs. The major factors affecting the quality of single-crystal structures are the crystal's size and regularity; recrystallization is <b>a</b> <b>commonly</b> used technique to improve these factors in small-molecule crystals. The Cambridge Structural Database contains over 800,000 structures as of September 2016; over 99% of these structures were determined by X-ray diffraction.|$|E
5|$|Lacks {{was treated}} with radium tube inserts as an {{inpatient}} and discharged {{a few days later}} with instructions to return for X-ray treatments as a follow-up. During her treatments, two samples were taken from Lacks's cervix without her permission or knowledge; one sample was of healthy tissue and the other was cancerous. These samples were given to George Otto Gey, a physician and cancer researcher at Johns Hopkins. The cells from the cancerous sample eventually became known as the HeLa immortal cell line, <b>a</b> <b>commonly</b> used cell line in contemporary biomedical research.|$|E

Chlorophyll, the E numbers E140 and E141, is the most common green chemical found in nature, and only allowed in certain medicines and cosmetic materials. Quinoline Yellow (E104) is <b>a</b> <b>commonly</b> used coloring in the United Kingdom but is banned in Australia, Japan, Norway and the United States. Green S (E142) is prohibited in many countries, for it is known to cause hyperactivity, asthma, urticaria, and insomnia.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} risk scores exist to predict {{bleeding}} in people using warfarin and similar anticoagulants. <b>A</b> <b>commonly</b> used score (HAS-BLED) includes known predictors of warfarin-related bleeding: uncontrolled {{high blood pressure}} (H), abnormal kidney function (A), previous stroke (S), known previous bleeding condition (B), previous labile INR when on anticoagulation (L), elderly as defined by age over 65 (E), and drugs associated with bleeding (e.g. aspirin) or alcohol misuse (D). While their use is recommended in clinical practice guidelines, they are only moderately effective in predicting bleeding risk and do not perform well in predicting hemorrhagic stroke. Bleeding risk may be increased in people on hemodialysis. Another score used to assess bleeding risk on anticoagulation, specifically Warfarin or Coumadin, is the ATRIA score, which uses a weighted additive scale of clinical findings to determine bleeding risk stratification. The risks of bleeding are increased further when warfarin is combined with antiplatelet drugs such as clopidogrel, aspirin, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.|$|E

5|$|Equivalent {{narcotic}} depth (END) is <b>a</b> <b>commonly</b> used way {{of expressing}} the narcotic effect of different breathing gases. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Diving Manual now states that oxygen and nitrogen should be considered equally narcotic. Standard tables, based on relative lipid solubilities, list conversion factors for narcotic effect of other gases. For example, hydrogen at a given pressure has a narcotic effect equivalent to nitrogen at 0.55 times that pressure, so in principle it should be usable at {{more than twice the}} depth. Argon, however, has 2.33 times the narcotic effect of nitrogen, and is a poor choice as a breathing gas for diving (it is used as a drysuit inflation gas, owing to its low thermal conductivity). Some gases have other dangerous effects when breathed at pressure; for example, high-pressure oxygen can lead to oxygen toxicity. Although helium is the least intoxicating of the breathing gases, at greater depths it can cause high pressure nervous syndrome, a still mysterious but apparently unrelated phenomenon. Inert gas narcosis is only one factor influencing the choice of gas mixture; the risks of decompression sickness and oxygen toxicity, cost, and other factors are also important.|$|E
5|$|Heavy metals are {{generally}} defined as metals with relatively high densities, atomic weights, or atomic numbers. The criteria used, and whether metalloids are included, {{vary depending on}} the author and context. In metallurgy, for example, a heavy metal may be defined on the basis of density, whereas in physics the distinguishing criterion might be atomic number, while a chemist would likely be more concerned with chemical behaviour. More specific definitions have been published, but none of these have been widely accepted. The definitions surveyed in this article encompass up to 96 out of the 118 known chemical elements; only mercury, lead and bismuth meet all of them. Despite this lack of agreement, the term (plural or singular) is widely used in science. A density of more than 5g/cm3 is sometimes quoted as <b>a</b> <b>commonly</b> used criterion and is used in the body of this article.|$|E
