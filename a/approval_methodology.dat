40|$|This article investigates a fatigue {{approach}} conducted {{from the}} design phase to testing approval. It considerers modern analytical and experimental tools for structural durability assessment over each development phase for two reference components aiming an early <b>approval</b> <b>methodology</b> validation {{for a new}} design. A Finite element analysis procedure was used to set critical spots for measurements minimizing the data acquisition efforts. Based on measured data, strain life calculation was done for two reference components in order to set the release goals for a new design submitted to this approach. An innovative fatigue experimental technique is proposed using component extracted specimens and an edited input cycle loads. Considering the random data from a standard test track and signal proportionality evaluation, while assuming the Brown Miller equation for bi-axial fatigue together with Ramberg-Osgood model, equivalent damage load blocks were edited and used as input for durability assessment on specimens representing the component material. The results for the three parts materials were plotted as Weibull diagram for B 10 life estimation. Fatigue life results showed good correlation with the reference parts structural performance thus validating the method as well as approving the new design for production without additional on-vehicle durability testing. The methodology and the fatigue testing proposal is therefore recommended for future applications on similar developments...|$|E

40|$|The <b>approval</b> of <b>methodologies</b> and {{individual}} {{projects in the}} context of the Kyoto Protocols Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) is often an issue of national interest. Decisions of the CDM Executive Board (EB) can thus be expected to be highly politicized. Based on data for about 250 methodologies and about 1000 projects discussed by the EB so far, this paper provides a first econometric analysis of this hypothesis. The results suggest that indeed, along with formal quality criteria, political-economic variables determine the final EB decision. This is most clearly the case for decisions on CDM projects which are far less transparent than those on CDM methodologies. In particular, EB membership of the country or countries concerned raises the chances of a project to be approved. Moreover, clearly, with rising numbers of methodologies and projects, EB decision making has become stricter over time.

Most methodologies have been rejected {{because they did not}} comply with implicit quality standards regarding presentation and conservativeness. Also, tools to select the baseline scenario and to prove additionality were frequently lacking. If the level or the quality of production in the baseline or the project scenario changes, a simple before-after-comparison is not valid.

40|$|Forensic {{mental health}} (FMH) is {{described}} as a complex and challenging specialism to work in. The experiences of staff working within FMH settings have important influences on the quality of care provided to patients. This thesis explored the experiences of both multidisciplinary staff and clinical psychologists. A meta-synthesis of international qualitative studies was conducted to explore the experiences of staff working in FMH settings. Sixteen papers were synthesised, revealing five themes: 1) The impact of safety; 2) Psychological and emotional impacts; 3) Trying to maintain control; 4) The double-edged sword of support; and 5) A special insight into humanity. The findings point to the importance of understanding how staff manage the impacts of working in FMH settings in order to develop effective support systems. Eight clinical psychologists were individually interviewed to explore their lived experiences of compassion satisfaction when working in UK forensic mental health settings. Five themes were identified using interpretative phenomenological analysis: 1) The magnitude of trust; 2) Adjusting expectations; 3) Being both lock and key; 4) Needing time and resources; and 5) Variety and complexity. The results highlighted important distinctions in how compassion satisfaction can be experienced by clinical psychologists in this specialty, and what may influence these experiences. A critical appraisal of the process of carrying out the research was conducted.

40|$|The {{research}} {{described in}} this document represents work performed {{in the area of}} software development methodologies as it applied to quality software development in a scheduling department. It addressed traditional methods in software development, current trends in software development, in addition to quality and software development at various companies. The literature suggested a correlation between using a software development methodology and quality software. However, there was limited literature that measured quantitatively the correlation between the effectiveness of the software development methodology and quality software. A software development methodology was developed for the scheduling department of a government contractor company in Aiken, South Carolina based on its needs and emerging technologies. An instrument was utilized to measure the effectiveness of the developed methodology. The methodology was compared with two other methodologies: a standard methodology from the literature and the current method of software development in the scheduling department. A population of computer professionals was divided into three equal groups. Each group was asked to apply the methodology to the case study. Individuals in each group were asked to review the case study and software development methodology. Then using the instrument, the individuals were asked {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the software development methodology, thereby providing a means for evaluated effectiveness, without conducting years of testing. The responses of the three groups were compared to one another. The results indicated a significantly higher level of <b>approval</b> for those <b>methodologies</b> that guided the development activities, standardized the development process, and identified the development phases and deliverables. It was concluded that utilizing a software development methodology that guides, standardizes, and defines the development phases and deliverables will result in an improved software development process and software quality. Further investigation could validate the findings of this research. The results actually achieved from utilizing the methodology developed for the scheduling department compared with the results achieved from utilizing some other methodology could further validate these research findings. Additional research could examine, over an extended time period, the success of the software development process and software quality of those projects utilizing the methodology {{described in this}} dissertation...|$|R
40|$|Aboriginal {{participation}} {{is a key}} component of environmental assessment (EA), and is recognized in various policy processes concerning natural resources development across Canada. Despite the recognition of the participation of Aboriginal peoples as foundational to effective EA, there are long-standing concerns about the limited influence of Aboriginal communities on decisions about developments on their traditional lands. The recent push for more effective and meaningful Aboriginal engagement in development decisions arises, in part, from increased industry and regulatory demand for the streamlining of EA to achieve a more efficient and timely EA process. Notwithstanding the increasing scholarly and policy literature on Aboriginal participation in EA, little research exists on viable solutions to advance meaningful Aboriginal participation in EA whilst maintaining a degree of process efficiency to support timely EA decisions about resource development. This thesis draws on the experiences from industry, government and Aboriginal communities involved in EA for mineral resource development in northwest Saskatchewan, Canada and case studies in international EA practices, to advance the effectiveness of Aboriginal participation in EA. Effectiveness is defined as participation that is both meaningful to those affected and efficient for those seeking development <b>approvals.</b> The research <b>methodology</b> includes the review of scholarly and policy research, several legal and EA case reviews and semi-structured interviews. First, this thesis examined the evolution of participation in EA in Canada, {{and the extent to which}} scholarly research has contributed to solutions for meaningful Aboriginal participation amidst increasing demands for a regulatory process that is more efficient and with shorter timelines for participation and decision-making. Second, attention is focused on the underlying practice-based challenges to meaningful and efficient Aboriginal participation in EA, explored through semi-structured interviews and a case study of EA in northwest Saskatchewan, and adopting a policy community model. Third, drawing on the international literature, case experience, and lessons from northwest Saskatchewan, reforms and enhancements to the current EA system are proposed to help ensure meaningful and efficient participation of Aboriginal peoples in EA processes. The thesis concludes with a discussion of the main findings, addresses specific recommendations to advance Aboriginal participation in EA for uranium development in northwest Saskatchewan, and identifies opportunities for future policy and scholarly research. Results of this research indicate that many of the challenges are multi-dimensional, and of considerable concern to both meaningful and efficient Aboriginal participation in EA. Understanding the nature of these underlying challenges requires increasing attention to the needs, expectations, roles and responsibilities of key actors engaged in the EA policy community, and exploring the much needed institutional and process reforms are critical to advancing meaningful Aboriginal participation in EA without compromising timely decisions for development proponents...|$|R
40|$|The first {{methodology}} {{to address}} the rewetting of drained peatlands "Methodology for rewetting Drained Tropical Peatlands" has {{been approved by the}} Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) Program. As the methodology is the first of its kind, it will provide unique guidance for other projects that aim at rewetting tropical peatlands. The methodology has been developed by WWF Germany and WWF Indonesia with contributions from Remote Sensing Solutions, Alterra Wageningen, and Winrock International. “Tropical peatlands represent a key carbon sink, yet far too often they are cleared and drained to make way for palm oil plantations, destroying valuable ecosystems while releasing enormous volumes of GHG emissions in the process,” said Jerry Seager, Chief Program Officer for the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS). “This new methodology represents an exciting new opportunity to shift that paradigm, and we at the VCS look forward to seeing it in action. ” The methodology applies to project activities in which drained tropical peatlands are rewetted through the construction of permanent and/or temporary structures (such as dams) which hold back water in drainage waterways. The methodology quantifies the reduction in carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions due to decreased oxidation of soil organic material that occurs as a result of project activities. The quantification of emission reductions is based primarily on outputs from the Simulation of Groundwater (SIMGRO) model which estimates the water table depth based on a range of input parameters such as terrain characteristics, peat thickness and climate variables. The methodology is applicable to projects in Southeast Asia; specifically, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei and Papua New Guinea. The methodology has been developed in order to validate the REDD+ demonstration activity taking place in the Sebangau National Park, located in Indonesia - Central Kalimantan. The Sebangau National Park is a large peat dome that rises between two rivers. Historically the peat dome was covered by dense lowland rainforest. Before the Sebangau forest became a National Park, it was production forest, and where illegal loggers created a network of canals dug into the peat surface that were used for floating the logs out of the peatland area. The objective of the project intervention is to restore the hydrological and ecological functions of the peat swamp forest through the construction of dams. As a result of hydrological restoration, significant emissions of CO 2 from peatlands in the project area will be prevented. The project was initiated and is managed by the Ministry of Forestry Indonesia and WWF Indonesia. The methodology passed successfully the VCS <b>methodology</b> <b>approval</b> process conducted by SCS and TÜV SÜD. For further information please refer to: [URL]...|$|R
