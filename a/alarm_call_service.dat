Setting up an <b>alarm</b> <b>call</b> system requires a user (e. g. a physically handicapped person) with a user station and a <b>service</b> operator. The <b>alarm</b> <b>call,</b> activated by the user pressing a button on his of her emergency transmitter reaches the receiver via the public telephone network. Most of the <b>alarm</b> <b>calls</b> (about 90 - 95 %) reaching a service station are not emergency calls triggered by a dangerous situation but so called "routine alarms", mostly socially indicated. Today, it is thought by experts, that between 30, 000 and 40, 000 people are connected up to an emergency call station. The largest operational service station (or operational headquarter) in Germany services more than 1500 people; 400 to 800 users per station is quite a usual figur in urban areas. More than four fifths of the emergency call system users are women. Most a re drawing pensions or annuities; the proportion receiving social assistance varies from 1 % to 40 % depending on the service station. The services provided for users of a private <b>alarm</b> <b>call</b> system by <b>service</b> operators could be made more personal in the future by including visual communcation. Considering {{the fact that many}} of the <b>alarm</b> <b>calls</b> reaching the <b>service</b> stations do not arise from acute emergencies but rather from the user's wish to speak to his or her fellow men, visual communication could represent an as yet unexploited means of supporting the formation of more intensive communication relationships, thus supporting social integration of the elderly, the handicapped and the infirm into a wider community, and securing the independence and dignity of the users of <b>alarm</b> <b>call</b> systems...|$|R

In this study, we tested whether nestling white-browed scrubwrens, Sericornis frontalis, responded to different <b>alarm</b> <b>calls</b> according to their specific risks of predation. As predators on the ground pose a danger to scrubwren nestlings, whereas flying predators do not, we predicted that they would respond to ground <b>alarm</b> <b>calls</b> but not to aerial <b>alarm</b> <b>calls.</b> In a field playback experiment, we tested the response of young to aerial and ground <b>alarm</b> <b>calls,</b> each presented in a shorter (less urgent) and longer (more urgent) form.

40|$|Many animals produce <b>alarm</b> <b>calls</b> that warn conspecifics about predators. In some species, <b>alarm</b> <b>calls</b> {{communicate}} continuous traits {{associated with}} a predator encounter, such as its level of threat. In other species, <b>alarm</b> <b>calls</b> communicate categorical traits, such as predator class (e. g. avian versus terrestrial), and are consequently considered functionally referential. In theory, functionally referential <b>alarm</b> <b>calls</b> can simultaneously communicate continuously distributed traits, though examples of such calls are rare. Such dual-function calls could be adaptive because they would enable receivers to tailor their responses to a specific predator class, {{as well as to}} more subtle characteristics of individual attacks. Here, we tested whether male fowl (Gallus gallus) communicate continuous variation in avian stimuli through graded structure in their functionally referential aerial <b>alarm</b> <b>calls.</b> In the first experiment, we held male fowl in an indoor test cage and allowed them to view wild birds flying past a window.

40|$|On encountering a predator, {{many species}} emit {{potentially}} risky vocalizations known as <b>alarm</b> <b>calls.</b> We evaluated {{the relative importance}} of two adaptive hypotheses on the evolution of calling: (1) communicating to predators, which may function by deterring pursuit and hence increasing individual survival, and (2) an alternative nepotistic hypothesis for <b>alarm</b> <b>calling</b> whereby callers obtain direct and indirect fitness by warning relatives. Focusing on 209 species of rodents, we found significant associations between diurnality and <b>alarm</b> <b>calling,</b> living socially and <b>alarm</b> <b>calling,</b> and diurnality and sociality. Diurnality, however, accounted for nearly three times as much variation in whether or not a species <b>alarm</b> <b>called</b> than did sociality. Phylogenetic tests revealed that the evolution of diurnality preceded the evolution of <b>alarm</b> <b>calling,</b> and that the evolutions of diurnality and sociality were unrelated. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that alarm communication evolved to communicate to predators.

40|$|Abstract Some {{animals have}} the {{cognitive}} capacity to diVerentiate between diVerent species of predators and generate diVerent <b>alarm</b> <b>calls</b> in response. However, {{the presence of}} any addition information that might be encoded into <b>alarm</b> <b>calls</b> has been largely unexplored. In the present study, three similar-sized human females walked through a Gunnison’s prairie dog (Cynomys gunnisoni) colony wearing each of three diVerent-colored shirts: blue, green, and yellow. We recorded the <b>alarm</b> <b>calls</b> and used discriminant function analysis to assess whether the calls for the diVerent-colored shirts were signiWcantly diVerent. The {{results showed that the}} <b>alarm</b> <b>calls</b> for the blue and the yellow shirts were signiWcantly diVerent, but the green shirt calls were not signiWcantly diVerent from the calls for the yellow shirt. The colors that were detected, with corresponding encoding into <b>alarm</b> <b>calls,</b> reXect the visual perceptual abilities of the prairie dogs. This study suggests that prairie dogs are able to incorporate labels about the individual characteristics of predators into their <b>alarm</b> <b>calls,</b> and that the complexity of information contained in animal <b>alarm</b> <b>calls</b> may be greater than has been previously believed...|$|R
50|$|Meerkat calls {{may carry}} {{specific}} meanings, with particular calls indicating {{the type of}} predator and {{the urgency of the}} situation. In addition to <b>alarm</b> <b>calls,</b> meerkats also make panic calls, recruitment calls, and moving calls. They chirrup, trill, growl, or bark, depending on the circumstances. Meerkats make different <b>alarm</b> <b>calls</b> depending upon whether they see an aerial or a terrestrial predator. Moreover, acoustic characteristics of the call will change with the urgency of the potential predatory episode. Therefore, six different predatory <b>alarm</b> <b>calls</b> with six different meanings have been identified: aerial predator with low, medium, and high urgency; and terrestrial predator with low, medium, and high urgency. Meerkats respond differently after hearing a terrestrial predator <b>alarm</b> <b>call</b> than after hearing an aerial predator <b>alarm</b> <b>call.</b> For example, upon hearing a high-urgency terrestrial predator <b>alarm</b> <b>call,</b> meerkats are most likely to seek shelter and scan the area. On the other hand, upon hearing a high-urgency aerial predator <b>alarm</b> <b>call,</b> meerkats are most likely to crouch down.

Campbell's males give acoustically distinct <b>alarm</b> <b>calls</b> to leopards, Panthera pardus, and crowned-hawk eagles, Stephanoaetus coronatus, and Diana monkeys respond to these calls with their own corresponding <b>alarm</b> <b>calls.</b> However, in less dangerous situations, Campbell's males emit a pair of low, resounding 'boom' <b>calls</b> before their <b>alarm</b> <b>calls.</b> Playbacks of boom-introduced Campbell's <b>alarm</b> <b>calls</b> no longer elicited <b>alarm</b> <b>calls</b> in Diana monkeys, indicating that the booms have affected the semantic specificity of the subsequent <b>alarm</b> <b>calls.</b> When the booms preceded the <b>alarm</b> <b>calls</b> of Diana monkeys, however, they were no longer effective as semantic modifiers, indicating that they are meaningful only in conjunction with Campbell's <b>alarm</b> <b>calls.</b> I discuss the implications of these findings for the evolution of syntactic abilities.

40|$|A major {{evolutionary}} force driving functionally referential <b>alarm</b> <b>calls</b> {{is the need}} for different strategies to escape various predator types in complex structured habitats. In contrast, a single escape strategy appears to be sufficient in less-structured open habitats, and under such conditions urgency-dependent <b>alarm</b> <b>calls</b> may be favored. Nevertheless, some species, such as meerkats (Suricata suricatta), have evolved functionally referential <b>alarm</b> <b>calls</b> despite living in open areas, using only bolt-holes for retreat.

Cape ground squirrels emitted urgency-dependent <b>alarm</b> <b>calls</b> and responded to playbacks depending on urgency, not predator type. Vigilance behavior and habitat use differed between the two species. Meerkats roam widely to find prey and for efficient foraging depend on coordinated predator vigilance and escape behavior. As herbivores with smaller territories, Cape ground squirrels depend less on coordinated antipredator behavior, and urgency-dependent <b>alarm</b> <b>calls</b> encode all essential information.

Here, we present {{the results of a}} field experiment with a New World primate, the black-fronted titi monkey (Callicebus nigrifrons), designed to explore the information conveyed by their <b>alarm</b> <b>call</b> system. Adults produced sequences consisting of two main <b>alarm</b> <b>call</b> types that conveyed, {{in different parts of the}} utterance, {{information about}} a predator’s type and location. In particular, sequence compositions differed depending on whether the predator was a mammalian carnivore or a raptor, and whether it was detected in a tree or on the ground. This is the first demonstration of a sequence-based <b>alarm</b> <b>call</b> system in a non-human animal that has the capacity to encode both location and type of predatory threat...|$|R

Faculty of Science, Charles University in Prague. <b>Alarm</b> <b>calls</b> of the Great tit (Parus major) {{used in the}} context of ground-predators or perching-raptors consist of high-frequency tonal syllables and of series of churring syllables with broad-frequency range. The function of some acoustical parametres of these complex calls was tested in playback experiment on feeder. As the most effective appeared to be <b>alarm</b> <b>calling</b> of two birds simultaneously. More important for warning function of the calls were broad-frequency range syllables. The length of series of these syllables had an opposite impact than in some north-American chickadees (genus Poecile). The Blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus) responds to Great tit's <b>alarm</b> <b>calls,</b> but its reactions are weaker. This difference can be caused by its lower competition ability against the Great tit. Key words: antipredation behavior, <b>alarm</b> <b>calls,</b> tits, playback experimen...|$|R
50|$|While it has {{a limited}} vocal repertoire, the species {{has been shown to}} make use of the <b>alarm</b> <b>calls</b> of other species, for example {{responding}} with increased vigilance or flight behaviour to the <b>alarm</b> <b>calls</b> of the white-bellied go-away-bird.|$|R

One study showed, along with other ungulates, wildebeests responded more {{strongly}} to the baboon <b>alarm</b> <b>calls</b> compared to the baboon contest calls, though both types of calls had similar patterns, amplitudes, and durations. The <b>alarm</b> <b>calls</b> were a response of the baboons to lions, and the contest calls were recorded when a dispute between two males occurred.|$|R
40|$|Many species produce <b>alarm</b> <b>calls</b> {{that vary}} {{according}} to situation. Theoretically, <b>alarm</b> <b>call</b> structure could covary with predator type and could communicate potentially “referential” information, or calls could covary with the degree of risk a caller experienced when it emitted a call. Using similar methods, I studied {{the ways in which}} Olympic (Marmota olympus), hoary (M. caligata), and Vancouver Island marmots (M. vancouverensis) communicated situational variation. I observed both natural <b>alarm</b> <b>calling,</b> and I arti cially elicited alar...|$|R

It is mainly focused on inter-species and intra-species variability in acoustic structure of <b>alarm</b> <b>calls</b> which are emitted in presence of predators. The {{major part of the}} thesis deals with intra-species variability in acoustic structure of the <b>alarm</b> <b>calls</b> in five Eurasian ground squirrels, Spermophilus citellus, S. taurensis, S. xanthoprymnus, S. suslicus and S. fulvus. It has been confirmed that the <b>alarm</b> <b>calls</b> of these ground squirrels show a high level of species specificity. The thesis further describes another vocalizations produced by three Eurasian ground squirrel species, Spermophilus suslicus, S. citellus and S. fulvus., and shows that {{with the exception of the}} <b>alarm</b> <b>calls,</b> vocal repertoires of these three ground squirrels are remarkably similar. The last part of the thesis deals with individual distinctiveness of the <b>alarm</b> <b>calls</b> of three Eurasian ground squirrels, Spermophilus citellus, S. taurensis and S. xanthoprymnus. It has been shown that the <b>alarm</b> <b>calls</b> of these species have a [...] ...|$|R
