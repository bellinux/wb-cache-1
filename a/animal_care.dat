5|$|In May 2005, a {{veterinarian}} named Kris Nelson filed {{a series of}} complaints against the zoo regarding <b>animal</b> <b>care</b> and management. Her complaints were backed by two former zoo employees: a chief veterinarian and an animal nutritionist. The complaints stated that dozens of animals had been harmed or {{died as a result}} of poor management, feeding practices, and quarantine procedures. Another veterinarian, 15-year zoo employee Kathy Orr, discounted many of Nelson's claims as being either invalid, or having been corrected already.|$|E

5|$|The use {{of marine}} mammals by the Navy, even in {{accordance}} with the Navy's policy, continues to meet opposition. The Navy's policy says that only positive reinforcement is to be used while training the military dolphins, and that they be cared for {{in accordance with}} accepted standards in <b>animal</b> <b>care.</b> The inevitable stresses involved in training are topics of controversy, as their treatment is unlike the animals' natural lifestyle, especially towards their confined spaces when not training. There is also controversy over the use of muzzles and other inhibitors, which prevent the dolphins from foraging for food while working. The Navy states that this is to prevent them from ingesting harmful objects, but conservation activists say this is done to reinforce the trainers' control over the dolphins, who hand out food rewards. The means of transportation is also an issue for conservation activists, since they are hauled in dry carriers, and switching tanks and introducing the dolphin to new dolphins is potentially dangerous as they are territorial.|$|E

The NMMP says it complies strictly with United States Department of Defense requirements and federal laws regarding the proper care of the animals, including the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Animal Welfare Act. The program is listed as an accredited institution by the Association for the Accreditation of Animal Laboratory <b>Animal</b> <b>Care</b> (AAALAC), whose voluntary accreditation program requires research programs to demonstrate that they meet standards of <b>animal</b> <b>care</b> beyond those required by law.

40|$|When in the 1970 s {{and later}} many governments of ACP {{countries}} had to reform their economies and {{cut back on}} public expenses, veterinary services were not spared the suffering. One reaction was for commercial enterprises to jump into this service gap. Privately-run artificial insemination, pest control programmes and clinical services {{are but a few}} examples of this. At the same time, the idea that rural communities had to develop self reliance in many ways started to gain ground. This do-it-your-self thinking also applied to <b>animal</b> health <b>care</b> services for farm animals and community-based <b>animal</b> health <b>care</b> (CBAHC) was born. In two well-documented publications, the Intermediate Technology Development Group East Africa (ITDG-EA) have laid down their experiences in years of supporting and setting up community based services in this field. Community-based <b>animal</b> health <b>care</b> in East Africa describes the history of CBAHC services in Kenya and gives a step-by-step overview on how to set up a CBAHC service and how to operate it, evaluate it and consequently re-direct it. The book offers advice on training requirements for CBAHC workers and trainers, and presents 13 case studies of Kenyan CBAHC services. The role of community-based <b>animal</b> health <b>care</b> in rural development builds on the previous book and can be considered more as a handbook on CBAHC and is a reference book for rural development workers throughout East Africa.
