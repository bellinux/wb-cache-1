40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{is to develop a}} control scheme for the Arctic Multipurpose Vessel Oil Spill Fighter vessel model using a {{joystick}} as the connection between vessel and operator. A mathematical model of the vessel is also to be developed using data gathered from experiments done with the vessel model and existing maneuvering model theory. The parameters that are not determined during experiments have all been given an assumed value. The developed mathematical model is, in addition to providing the platform on which to test the controls, meant to be a framework ready for more accurate parameters done by future students. The Oil Spill Fighter is an amphibious vessel powered by two <b>Archimedes</b> <b>screws</b> that run the length of the vessel {{on each side of the}} hull. This is not a unique way of powering an amphibious vessel, but no research have been found on the topic of how such a vessel moves on neither land nor water. This will therefore be discussed in this thesis. The results of this discussion will be appended to the mathematical model of the vessel in order to end up with a model as close to reality as is possible with the determined parameters. In order to determine what control scheme to pursue, the work space and configuration space of the vessel are discussed. The conclusion of this discussion is to make the land-based control an open-loop control with the joystick providing surge force and yaw moment and the water-based control an autopilot. Those two controllers are then combined to come up with a single model of the amphibious property of the vessel. When designing the controllers they are kept separate at first in order to simplify the design and tuning. The performance of each is presented and discussed separately and they are then combined into one model. The performance of this combined model is then presented. The concept of hardware-in-the-loop testing is given an introduction, and the use of this type of testing with regards to the developed models are presented. This involves designing an interface in LabView which is connected to a CompactRIO that holds the model. The concept of real-time calculations are discussed, and a presentation of the developed models performance when uploaded to a CompactRIO and tested in the LabView interface is given. At the end the mathematical model is compared to the results from the experiments. These fit very well, and this result is discussed. </p...|$|R

40|$|Operation of manned {{oil and gas}} {{installations}} in arctic locations is complicated and presents new challenges. One of the challenges is to maintain {{the safety of the}} crew, by obtaining adequate lifeboat systems for crew evacuation. This master thesis focuses on different methods for meeting this challenge. The weather and climate conditions in the Arctic are very different from the conditions we find in more southern oceans. Extreme temperatures, winds caused by polar lows, icing and sea ice presents new and difficult challenges which is demanding for the operation of lifeboats. Hazard identification analyses of two types are performed to identify potential hazards of operating existing lifeboats in arctic conditions. These identify the following hazards as the most critical: Freezing of moving davit components Risk of floating pieces of ice occurring in the launching zone for free fall lifeboats Close pack ice present at the time of evacuation Open drift ice or close pack ice present during the initial operational phase Sea spray icing on the lifeboat at sea Open drift ice or close pack ice present in the operational phase Based on the hazard identification analyses, a specification of requirements for arctic lifeboats is established. This specification is intended to supplement, and not replace, the existing regulations and requirements which apply to lifeboats. Based on the specification, alternatives for modification of existing lifeboats are suggested and discussed. The modification alternatives include modifications of launching equipment, hull strengthening and propulsion equipment. However, full compliance with the specification is not believed to be achievable by modifications. Three different concepts for arctic survival crafts are outlined, each intended for a specific set of ice conditions. Concept one is an arctic free fall lifeboat, intended to be launched by free fall in the icefree summer season, and launched by a more conventional method in the ice season. The lifeboat is designed to be able to operate in higher ice concentrations than existing lifeboats are capable of. Concept two is an arctic conventional lifeboat, intended to be launched {{in the same way as}} existing conventional lifeboats. It is designed to operate in very high ice concentrations, by use of <b>Archimedes</b> <b>screws.</b> Concept three is an arctic survival vehicle, designed to operate in continuous ice and very high ice concentrations. Propulsion is provided by twin pair of tracks. In the final part of the thesis, the Arctic Free Fall Lifeboat is developed further. Dimensions, capacities, hull design and features for arctic operation are described. An improved launching arrangement is also described, capable of operating in two different modes depending on the ice concentrations in the area. The thesis concludes that existing lifeboats can be modified to achieve better performance and safety in arctic conditions, but the potential for improvement is limited. To achieve high performance and a high level of safety, arctic lifeboats must be designed and built for this purpose. </p...|$|R

50|$|The <b>Archimedes</b> <b>screw</b> {{consists}} of a screw (a helical surface surrounding a central cylindrical shaft) inside a hollow pipe. The screw is usually turned by windmill, manual labor, cattle, or by modern means, such as a motor. As the shaft turns the bottom end scoops up a volume of water. This water is then pushed up the tube by the rotating helicoid until it pours out {{from the top of}} the tube.|$|E
50|$|In soft ground, {{there are}} three main types of TBMs: Earth Pressure Balance Machines (EPB), Slurry Shield (SS) and {{open-face}} type. Both types of closed machines operate like Single Shield TBMs, using thrust cylinders to advance forward by pushing off against concrete segments. Earth Pressure Balance Machines are used in soft ground with less than 7 bar of pressure. The cutter head does not use disc cutters only, but instead an combination of tungsten carbide cutting bits, carbide disc cutters, drag picks and/or hard rock disc cutters. The EPB gets its name because it uses the excavated material to balance the pressure at the tunnel face. Pressure is maintained in the cutterhead by controlling the rate of extraction of spoil through the <b>Archimedes</b> <b>screw</b> and the advance rate. Additives such as bentonite, polymers and foam can be injected ahead of the face to increase {{the stability of the}} ground. Additives can also be injected in the cutterhead/extraction screw to ensure that the spoil remains sufficiently cohesive to form a plug in the <b>Archimedes</b> <b>screw</b> to maintain pressure in the cutterhead and restrict water flowing through.|$|E
50|$|A screw {{conveyor}} is an <b>Archimedes</b> <b>screw</b> contained within a tube and turned by a motor {{so as to}} deliver material {{from one end of}} the conveyor to the other. It is particularly suitable for transport of granular materials such as plastic granules used in injection molding, and cereal grains. It may also be used to transport liquids. In industrial control applications the conveyor may be used as a rotary feeder or variable rate feeder to deliver a measured rate or quantity of material into a process.|$|E
50|$|Water Playground. This was {{completed}} in 1996 {{and is one of}} the most popular attractions. The playground consists of a round hole with a diameter of forty meters, surrounded by a dike. On the embankment flows water pumped from the sea, in a gutter. Along the route of the gutter, waterfalls and streams are placed so visitors can change the flow and the course of water. Other components are an <b>Archimedes</b> <b>screw,</b> a water wheel, a water organ and a water tunnel caves. The eye-catching landmark of the Water Playground is an eight-meter high windmill.|$|E
5000|$|If {{water is}} {{fed into the}} top of an <b>Archimedes</b> <b>screw,</b> it will force the screw to rotate. The {{rotating}} shaft can then be used to drive an electric generator. Such an installation has the same benefits as using the screw for pumping: the ability to handle very dirty water and widely varying rates of flow at high efficiency. Settle Hydro and Torrs Hydro are two reverse screw micro hydro schemes operating in England. The screw works well as a generator at low heads, commonly found in English rivers, including the Thames, powering Windsor Castle.|$|E
50|$|Fenestellidae is {{a family}} of Bryozoans {{belonging}} to the order Fenestrida. The skeleton of its colonies consists of stiff branches that are interconnected by narrower crossbars (or dissepiments). The individuals of the colony (or zooids)inhabit {{one side of the}} branches in two parallel rows or two at the branch base and three or more rows further up. Zooids can be recognized as small rimmed pores (or apertures), and in well-preserved specimens the apertures are closed by centrally perforated lids. The front of the branches carries small nodes in a row or zigzag line between the apertures. Branches split (or bifurcate) from time to time giving the colonies a fan-shape or, in the genus Archimedes, create an mesh in the shape of an <b>Archimedes</b> <b>screw.</b>|$|E
50|$|The distinctions {{above are}} {{enforced}} in the controlled vocabulary of standards organizations. Nevertheless, there are sometimes {{differences between the}} controlled vocabulary and the natural language use of the words by machinists, auto mechanics and others. These differences reflect linguistic evolution shaped by the changing of technology over centuries. The words bolt and screw have both existed since before today's modern mix of fastener types existed, and the natural usage of those words has evolved retronymously {{in response to the}} technological change. (That is, the use of words as names for objects changes as the objects change.) Non-threaded fasteners predominated until the advent of practical, inexpensive screw-cutting in the early 19th century. The basic meaning of the word screw has long involved the idea of a helical screw thread, but the <b>Archimedes</b> <b>screw</b> and the screw gimlet (like a corkscrew) preceded the fastener.|$|E
