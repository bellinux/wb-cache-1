25|$|Specialty diapers are {{required}} for swimming or pool therapy. These are known as swim diapers or containment swim briefs. They are intended mainly for fecal incontinence, however {{they can also be}} useful for temporary urine containment, to maintain dignity while transferring from change room to pool. Manufacturers such as Discovery Trekking, Splash About and Theraquatics commonly utilize a stretch fabric to allow increased <b>adjustability</b> for a snug fit. They are washable and reusable. There are no disposable adult swim diapers.|$|E
25|$|In 1953, the trapeze {{tailpiece}} was dropped, {{and a new}} stopbar {{design was}} added. This design combined a pre-intonated bridge and tailpiece with two studs just behind the bridge pickup. This increased the sustain of the Goldtop noticeably; however, the intonation and string height <b>adjustability</b> were limited. A new design, the Tune-o-matic, replaced the stopbar in 1955. It consisted of a separate bridge and tailpiece attached directly {{to the top of}} the guitar, combining an easily adjustable bridge with a sustain-carrying tailpiece. This design has been used on most Les Pauls ever since. The tuners were produced by Kluson.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have also}} been {{performed}} on {{the components of the}} DNA translation mechanism. One desire of scientists creating synthetic biological circuits {{is to be able to}} control the translation of synthetic DNA in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. One study tested the <b>adjustability</b> of synthetic transcription factors (sTFs) in areas of transcription output and cooperative ability among multiple transcription factor complexes. Researchers were able to mutate zinc fingers, the DNA specific component of sTFs, to decrease their affinity for DNA, and thus decreasing the amount of translation. They were also able to use the zinc fingers as components of complex forming sTFs, which are the eukaryotic translation mechanisms.|$|E
500|$|Social Security {{benefits}} would be adjusted for any price changes due to FairTax implementation. [...] The Beacon Hill Institute {{states that it}} would not matter, apart from transition issues, whether prices fall or rise—the relative tax burden and tax rate remains the same. [...] Decreases in production cost would not fully apply to imported products; so according to proponents, it would provide tax advantages for domestic production and increase U.S. competitiveness in global trade (see Border <b>adjustability).</b> [...] To ease the transition, U.S. retailers will receive a tax credit equal to the FairTax on their inventory to allow for quick cost reduction. Retailers would also receive an administrative fee equal to the greater of $200 or 0.25% of the remitted tax as compensation for compliance costs, which amounts to around $5 billion.|$|E
2500|$|... 84–87 front {{suspension}} is a wider direct {{derivative of}} the Chevrolet Chevette and Pontiac T1000. It employs a double A-arm (or double wishbone) design common {{prior to the}} advent of struts, and has naturally good geometry. A drawback of this design, however, means that the car's front suspension has four ball joints. Nevertheless, the tie-rods allow toe-in/out <b>adjustability.</b> Minimal camber adjustments exist on 1984 to 1987 models without an after-market upgrade that replaces the upper ball joints with slotted mounting points units. The joints have typical grease fittings for regular lubrication commonly found on pre-2000 autos.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{treeless}} saddle designs {{may present}} problems for riders as well. [...] Without a supportive tree over the horse's withers, a treeless saddle may place the rider behind {{the movement of}} the horse, creating pressure on the horse's loin and the rider's low back. Inadequate support may also lead to the rider's seat bones digging into the horse's back. [...] Additionally, a solid tree supports the curvature of the rider's spine which is essential for communication between horse and rider. [...] On the other hand, many riders with preexisting back or hip problems are more comfortable in a treeless saddle due to the extra padding, <b>adjustability</b> and shock absorption. [...] Treeless saddles have started to become popular in horse therapy and hippotherapy for this reason.|$|E
2500|$|The Lotus 16's front {{suspension}} {{was also}} {{borrowed from the}} 12, with Chapman's own double wishbone design incorporating the anti-roll bar within the upper wishbones; an example of Chapman's innovative attention to detail in trying to shave every excess ounce from his cars. Unlike the 12, however, the 16 was designed from the outset to incorporate the Chapman strut rear suspension design. This {{was one of the}} first rear independent suspension designs to be incorporated into a Formula One car, and offered much better traction, handling and <b>adjustability</b> than the previously-common de Dion tube systems. The 16 also sported the, by now iconic, Lotus [...] "wobbly-web wheels"; an innovative cast alloy design borrowed from the aviation industry. Brakes were disc brakes all round, mounted inboard at the rear.|$|E
2500|$|Series 8 (January 1999– August 2002) was {{the final}} series, and was only {{available}} in the Japanese market. More efficient turbochargers were available on certain models, while improved intercooling and radiator cooling {{was made possible by}} a redesigned front fascia with larger openings. The seats, steering wheel, and instrument cluster were all changed. The rear spoiler was modified and gained <b>adjustability</b> on certain models. Three horsepower levels are available: 255ps for automatic transmission equipped cars, 265ps for the Type RB, and 280ps available on the top-of-the-line sporting models. The high-end [...] "Type RS" [...] came equipped with Bilstein suspension and 17-inch wheels as standard equipment, and reduced weight to [...] Power was increased {{with the addition of a}} less restrictive muffler and more efficient turbochargers which featured abradable compressor seals, [...] with [...] of torque as per the maximum Japanese limit. The Type RS had a brake upgrade by increasing rotor diameter front and rear to [...] and front rotor thickness from [...] to [...] The Type RS version also sported a 4.30 ratio differential, providing a significant reduction in its 0–100km/hr time. The gearbox was also modified, 5th gear was made longer to reduce cruising rpm and improve fuel efficiency. The very limited edition Type RZ version included all the features of the Type RS, but at a lighter weight (at 1270kg). It also featured custom gun-metal colored BBS wheels and a custom red racing themed interior. An improved ABS system worked by braking differently on each wheel, allowing the car better turning during braking. The effective result made for safer driving for the average buyer. Easily the most collectible of all the RX-7s were the last 1,500 run-out specials. Dubbed the [...] "Spirit R", they combined all the [...] "extra" [...] features Mazda had used on previous limited-run specials with new exclusive features like cross-drilled brake rotors. Sticker prices when new were 3,998,000 yen for Type-A and B and 3,398,000 yen for Type-C. Mazda's press release said [...] "The Type-A Spirit R model is the ultimate RX-7, boasting the most outstanding driving performance in its history." ...|$|E
6000|$|There {{is another}} change of position, {{the value of}} which is not so {{apparent}} to me, as it may well seem to be {{to those who are}} unfamiliar with the subject under discussion. Mr. Gladstone discards his three groups of [...] "water-population," [...] "air-population," [...] and [...] "land-population," [...] and substitutes for them (1) fishes, (2) birds, (3) mammals, (4) man. Moreover, it is assumed, in a note, that [...] "the higher or ordinary mammals" [...] alone were known to the [...] "Mosaic writer" [...] (p. 6). No doubt it looks, at first, as if something {108} were gained by this alteration; for, as I have just pointed out, the word [...] "fishes" [...] can be used in two senses, one of which has a deceptive appearance of <b>adjustability</b> to the [...] "Mosaic" [...] account. Then the inconvenient reptiles are banished out of sight; and, finally, the question of the exact meaning of [...] "higher" [...] and [...] "ordinary" [...] in the case of mammals opens up the prospect of a hopeful logomachy. But what is the good of it all in the face of Leviticus {{on the one hand and}} of palæontology on the other? ...|$|E

[...] But before she could answer, and because also, doubtless, the {{question}} had too much the sound of a taunt, I came up, as if for her real convenience, quite in another place. [...] "Perhaps my idea--my timing, that is, of your crisis--is the result, in my mind, of my own association with that particular instant. It comes back to me that what I was most full of while your face signed to me and your voice then so graciously confirmed it, and while too, as I've said, Long walked away--what I was most full of, as a consequence of another go, just ended, at Lady John, was, once more, this same Lady John's want of <b>adjustability</b> to the character you and I, in our associated speculation of the morning, had so candidly tried to fit her with. I was still even then, you see, speculating--all on my own hook, alas!--and it had just rolled over me with renewed force that she was nothing whatever, not the least little bit, to our purpose. The moment, in other words, if you understand, happened to be one of my moments; so that, by the same token, I simply wondered if it mightn't likewise have happened to be one of yours." ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{happened}} that {{shortly after his}} arrival, riding an unruly horse which Euphemia had with shy admiration watched him mount in the castle-yard, he was thrown with a violence which, without disparaging his skill, made him for a fortnight an interesting invalid lounging in the library with a bandaged knee. To beguile his confinement the accomplished young stranger was repeatedly induced to sing for him, which she did with a small natural tremor that might have passed for the finish of vocal art. He never overwhelmed her with compliments, but he listened with unfailing attention, remembered all her melodies and would sit humming them to himself. While his imprisonment lasted indeed he passed hours in her company, making her feel not unlike some unfriended artist who has suddenly gained the opportunity to devote a fortnight {{to the study of}} a great model. Euphemia studied with noiseless diligence what she supposed to be the [...] "character" [...] of M. de Mauves, and the more she looked the more fine lights and shades she seemed to behold in this masterpiece of nature. M. de Mauves's character indeed, whether from a sense of being so generously and intensely taken for granted, or for reasons which bid graceful defiance to analysis, had never been so much on show, even to the very casual critic lodged, as might be said, in an out-of-the-way corner of it; it seemed really to reflect the purity of Euphemia's pious opinion. There had been nothing especially to admire in the state of mind in which he left Paris--a settled resolve to marry a young person whose charms might or might not justify his sister's account of them, but who was mistress, at the worst, of a couple of hundred thousand francs a year. He had not counted out sentiment--if she pleased him so much the better; but he had left a meagre margin for it and would hardly have admitted that so excellent a match could be improved by it. He was a robust and serene sceptic, and it was a singular fate for a man who believed in nothing to be so tenderly believed in. What his original faith had been he could hardly have told you, for as he came back to his childhood's home to mend his fortunes by pretending to fall in love he was a thoroughly perverse creature and overlaid with more corruptions than a summer day's questioning of his conscience would have put to flight. Ten years' pursuit of pleasure, which a bureau full of unpaid bills was all he had to show for, had pretty well stifled the natural lad whose violent will and generous temper might have been shaped by a different pressure to some such showing as would have justified a romantic faith. So should he have exhaled the natural fragrance of a late-blooming flower of hereditary honour. His violence indeed had been subdued and he had learned to be irreproachably polite; but he had lost the fineness of his generosity, and his politeness, which in the long run society paid for, was hardly more than a form of luxurious egotism, like his fondness for ciphered pocket-handkerchiefs, lavender gloves and other fopperies by which shopkeepers remained out of pocket. In after-years he was terribly polite to his wife. He had formed himself, as the phrase was, and the form prescribed to him by the society into which his birth and his tastes had introduced him was marked by some peculiar features. That which mainly concerns us is its classification of the fairer half of humanity as objects not essentially different--say from those very lavender gloves that are soiled in an evening and thrown away. To do M. de Mauves justice, he had in the course of time encountered in the feminine character such plentiful evidence of its pliant softness and fine <b>adjustability</b> that idealism naturally seemed to him a losing game.|$|E
