5|$|At {{the request}} of a friend, {{relative}} or acquaintance, with medical certificates written by two medical practitioners. This method was amended by The Mental Health Act 1959 which stated <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>could</b> be admitted upon the recommendation of a medical practitioner who had examined the person. As soon as possible after admission the superintendent of the hospital was required to examine the patient and either approve the recommended admission or discharge the patient.|$|E
5|$|Portable {{ventilators}} may {{be required}} to support breathing. Historically, a noninvasive, negative-pressure ventilator, more commonly called an iron lung, was used to artificially maintain respiration during an acute polio infection until <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>could</b> breathe independently (generally about one to two weeks). Today, many polio survivors with permanent respiratory paralysis use modern jacket-type negative-pressure ventilators worn over the chest and abdomen.|$|E
5|$|Until 2008, Kosovo did {{not have}} a flag of its own. However, during {{different}} periods of history, different flags were flown in Kosovo. Before 1969, the only flags that could legally fly over Kosovo (then an autonomous province) were those of SFR Yugoslavia and SR Serbia. If a nationalist flag were flown, such as Albanian, Serbian or Croatian, <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>could</b> go to prison for doing it.|$|E

5|$|About 20minutes {{after the}} first step, Aldrin joined Armstrong {{on the surface and}} became the second human to set foot on the Moon, and the duo began their tasks of {{investigating}} how easily <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>could</b> operate on the lunar surface. Early on, they unveiled a plaque commemorating their flight, and also planted the flag of the United States. The flag used on this mission had a metal rod to hold it horizontal from its pole. Since the rod did not fully extend, and the flag was tightly folded and packed during the journey, the flag ended up with a slightly wavy appearance, as if there were a breeze. Shortly after their flag planting, President Richard Nixon spoke to them by a telephone call from his office. The President spoke for about a minute, after which Armstrong responded for about thirty seconds.|$|E
5|$|Although the scholar-officials viewed {{military}} {{soldiers as}} lower {{members in the}} hierarchic social order, <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>could</b> gain status and prestige in society by becoming a high-ranking military officer {{with a record of}} victorious battles. At its height, the Song military had one million soldiers divided into platoons of 50 troops, companies made of two platoons, battalions composed of 500 soldiers. Crossbowmen were separated from the regular infantry and placed in their own units as they were prized combatants, providing effective missile fire against cavalry charges. The government was eager to sponsor new crossbow designs that could shoot at longer ranges, while crossbowmen were also valuable when employed as long-range snipers. Song cavalry employed a slew of different weapons, including halberds, swords, bows, spears, and 'fire lances' that discharged a gunpowder blast of flame and shrapnel.|$|E
5|$|From then on, Kouao kept Climbié {{away from}} hospitals, turning instead to churches. Kouao {{said to the}} pastors {{that she was the}} mother and that demons were inside Climbié. The pastor at the Mission Ensemble Pour Christ, Pascal Orome, offered prayers for Climbié to cast out the devil, and thought that her {{injuries}} were due to demonic possession. On another occasion, Kouao took Climbié to a church run by the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, where the pastor, Alvaro Lima, suspected she was being abused, although he took no action. He said in the inquiry that Climbié told him that Satan had told her to burn herself. The pastor did not believe her, but he still believed that <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>could</b> be possessed.|$|E

25|$|Reproof {{involves}} {{actions for}} which <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>could</b> be disfellowshipped, and {{is said to}} be an effort to 'reach the heart' and convince a person of the need to hate the sanctioned actions and repent. Reproof is considered sufficient if the individual is deemed repentant.|$|E
25|$|The German {{physician}} Gottlob Schober (1670-1739), {{who worked}} in Russia from 1712, notes that <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>could</b> hang from the ribs for about three days prior to expiring, his primary pain being that of extreme thirst.

25|$|<b>A</b> <b>person</b> <b>could</b> {{be indicted}} {{on charges of}} afflicting with witchcraft, or for making an {{unlawful}} covenant with the Devil.

25|$|The above {{definitions}} {{are limited}} in {{that they do not}} take into account the time period over which the drinking occurs or the body mass of the person drinking. <b>A</b> <b>person</b> <b>could</b> be defined as a binge drinker even if he or she never becomes intoxicated.

25|$|The American parapsychologist J. B. Rhine {{coined the}} term extra-sensory {{perception}} to describe receiving information paranormally from an external source. Following this, he used the term psychokinesis in 1934 to describe mentally influencing external objects or events {{without the use of}} physical energy. His initial example of psychokinesis was experiments that were conducted to determine whether <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>could</b> influence the outcome of falling dice.|$|E

25|$|In 1964, a Brazilian {{land law}} was passed that {{supported}} ownership of the land by the developer: if <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>could</b> demonstrate effective cultivation {{for a year and}} a day, then that person could claim a right to the land. This act paved the way for clearing enormous areas of forest for cattle production as developers sought to gain a financial profit from land with which they were provided.|$|E
