5|$|Fillet is {{the curved}} {{juncture}} of two surfaces {{that would have}} otherwise met at a sharp corner or edge. Simply, fillets {{can be added to}} <b>a</b> <b>die</b> casting to remove undesirable edges and corners.|$|E

5|$|Acurad was <b>a</b> <b>die</b> {{casting process}} {{developed}} by General Motors {{in the late}} 1950s and 1960s. The name is an acronym for accurate, reliable, and dense. It was developed to combine a stable fill and directional solidification with the fast cycle times of the traditional die casting process. The process pioneered four breakthrough technologies for die casting: thermal analysis, flow and fill modeling, heat treatable and high integrity die castings, and indirect squeeze casting (explained below).|$|E

5|$|Mario Party 4 {{features}} eight playable characters: Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Yoshi, Wario, Donkey Kong, Princess Daisy and Waluigi {{from the}} Mario series, {{who can be}} directed as characters on six themed game boards in the game. The objective {{of the game is}} to earn as many stars as possible, which are obtained by purchase from a single predefined space on the game board. Each character's movement is determined by a roll of <b>a</b> <b>die,</b> with a roll from each player forming a single turn. Each turn in Mario Party 4 is followed by a minigame in which characters compete for coins they can use to purchase items and stars.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} material properties for the dies are thermal shock resistance and softening at elevated temperature; other important properties include hardenability, machinability, heat checking resistance, weldability, availability (especially for larger dies), and cost. The longevity of <b>a</b> <b>die</b> is directly {{dependent on the}} temperature of the molten metal and the cycle time. The dies used in die casting are usually made out of hardened tool steels, because cast iron cannot withstand the high pressures involved, therefore the dies are very expensive, resulting in high start-up costs. Metals that are cast at higher temperatures require dies made from higher alloy steels.|$|E
