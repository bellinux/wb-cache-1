40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore the design of optimal incentive-compatible {{anti-dumping}} (AD) measures. When the weight given to the domestic firm's profit in the government's objective function is relatively small, it is shown that no <b>AD</b> <b>duty</b> should be imposed if the foreign firm reports its own costs, but a constant <b>AD</b> <b>duty</b> should be imposed if the domestic firm reports the foreign firm's cost. When this weight is large, in either case of reporting the <b>AD</b> <b>duty</b> is a prohibitive tariff. The optimal AD measures are modified {{in the presence of}} a GATT/WTO constraint. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the determinants of}} "echoing" in antidumping (AD) cases (i. e., different countries sequentially imposing AD measures on the same product from the same exporter). We develop a dynamic game in which two competing importers can choose to impose an <b>AD</b> <b>duty</b> on a third exporting country {{in one of two}} periods, if at all. Assuming that governments are politically motivated (favoring their import competing industries), we find that a country imposes an <b>AD</b> <b>duty</b> in the first (second) period independently of the other country’s actions if its political-economy parameter is "very high" ("high"). Instead, it never introduces AD measures when its political-economy parameter is below a critical "low" threshold. Echoing occurs for intermediate values of the political-economy parameter: a country chooses to impose an <b>AD</b> <b>duty</b> in the second period if and only if the competing importer has done so in the first period. Using a novel AD dataset, we document that echoing is a common practice among both traditional and new users of AD. In line with the conclusions of the theoretical model, the econometric results show that AD measures {{are more likely to be}} introduced in response to other countries’ measures when governments care to some extent, but not too much, about their import-competing industries. Thus, this paper shows that countries’ political-economy-driven trade policies are interdependent and should not be analyzed in isolation...|$|E

We examine both pass-through issues using monthly prices across 345 U. S. - imported Canadian iron and steel products from 1989 through 1995, some of which received duties in U. S.

Additionally, AD laws allow for recalculation of the <b>AD</b> <b>duties</b> over time in what are known as the administrative review process. These features of AD policy imply that foreign firms that face AD trade protection must solve a dynamic pricing problem, and this has not been considered by previous literature. In response, this paper models the dynamic pricing problem of firms facing possible <b>AD</b> <b>duties</b> and empirically examines some of the model’s implications. We characterize a firm’s optimal dynamic pricing paths under both certain and uncertain AD enforcement. Under certain enforcement of AD policy, a foreign firm choosing to dump in the initial period will dump more over time until the price reaches a steady state value. Thus, under this scenario <b>AD</b> <b>duties</b> increase or stay constant over time in subsequent administrative reviews. However, a foreign firm may choose its initial period price with a positive probability for avoiding <b>AD</b> <b>duties</b> (uncertain enforcement).

This paper examines {{for the first time the}} resulting dynamic pricing problem of a foreign firm that faces such an AD trade protection policy in its export market. When <b>AD</b> <b>duties</b> are certain for any dumping that occurs, we obtain the surprising result that dumping and <b>AD</b> <b>duties</b> should increase over time toward a stationary equilibrium value. Adding uncertainties prevalent in AD enforcement into our analysis changes these conclusions substantially and leads to more realistic testable implications. Firms with ex ante expectations that the probability of AD enforcement is low, or with expectations that the probability of a termination/VER (instead of <b>AD</b> <b>duties)</b> is high, will decrease their dumping and <b>AD</b> <b>duties</b> over time in the administrative review process once they face <b>AD</b> <b>duties.</b> Using detailed data from U.

Second, we argue that <b>AD</b> <b>duties</b> are more costly than simply the visible costs of AD protection. There are significant additional costs associated with the prospect of protection and these costs are imposed on both the domestic economy and on the international trading community.

40|$|At the {{inception}} of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1994, South Africa, as one of the founding members, embarked on a robust trade liberalisation policy. This was mainly achieved through the drastic reduction of tariffs across a number of industries. The agricultural sector was also subjected to this trade liberalisation, which left it open to international competition. As part of the WTO legal framework, the Agreement on the Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (Anti-Dumping Agreement / ADA) was adopted and all the WTO members were bound by it. The ADA enables a WTO member to impose Anti-Dumping (<b>AD)</b> <b>duties</b> against imports that are being dumped on its domestic market by an exporter of another WTO Member State. In 1999, the South African Poultry Association (SAPA) petitioned the SA AD investigating authority, the Board on Tariffs and Trade (the Board), to impose <b>AD</b> <b>duties</b> on certain USA poultry imports. The Board made use of the constructed NV method, sanctioned by WTO law, to determine NV which resulted in the imposition of final <b>AD</b> <b>duties</b> against USA poultry imports on 9 December 2000. These <b>AD</b> <b>duties</b> were so high that it effectively stopped the importation of USA poultry into the SA market. However, US Government, various interested parties, and scholars have since been very critical of the imposition of the December 2000 <b>AD</b> <b>duties</b> imposed against USA poultry products. It has been argued that the Board egregiously calculated the costs of production of the poultry products, a step vital to the determination of dumping. According to the critics of these <b>AD</b> <b>duties,</b> the Board intentionally made use of the constructed NV method to manipulate cost in order to protect an inefficient and uncompetitive SA poultry industry. So, this study will seeks to test the merits of the argument that the Board?s determination of constructed NV was WTO inconsistent in its December 2000 AD decision against USA poultry products. In doing this, the author will analyse the Board?s decision and WTO Panel reports on the interpretation of Article 2. 2. 1. 1 of the ADA, which deals with the determination of constructed NV. tm 2017 Centre for Human RightsLLMUnrestricte...|$|R

This paper investigates the impact of granting market economy status to China on antidumping (AD) duties and imports. With regard to non-market economies (like China), it is presumed that prices and costs are influenced by state interference and, therefore, authorities use prices and costs from a third party economy to construct normal values. This, however, leads to higher dumping margins. This paper examines the use of Non-Market Economy (NME) on dumping margins and statistical analysis finds that NME, in fact, raises margins by 18. 7 ∼ 27. 3 %.

This equilibrium is characterized by unilateral dumping by the foreign firm into the domestic economy. Two instruments of anti-dumping (AD) policy are examined, namely, a price undertaking (PU) and an anti-dumping duty. We establish an equivalence result between the effects of an <b>AD</b> <b>duty</b> and a PU. For certain parameter configurations, AD policy appears to be desirable on welfare grounds.

40|$|The {{last two}} decades have {{witnessed}} that countries across the world are guided by {{the rules and regulations}} of multilateral trading institutions (for example, World Trade organization [WTO], International Monetary Fund [IMF]) in order to promote free and fair trade through gradual reduction in trade barriers. The World economy has noticed significant reduction in tariffs, yet we find a rise in non-tariff barriers (NTBs). However, we still find dumping and few other trade strategies of the exporting countries as a major hindrance to free and fair trade. Such behaviour has led to “contingent protection” as a tool of new-protectionism. Among the contingent protection measures, anti-dumping (AD) has evolved as the most popular choice of strategy for the trading nations. The AD policy invokes a threat to the exporter and thereby can change its strategic behaviour. We describe the phenomenon of dumping through a price-leadership model and thereby compute the optimal level of anti-dumping duty that can offset dumping. Using a sequential game, we conclude that the credible threat of an <b>AD</b> <b>duty</b> restricts dumping and thereby leads to a win-win situation for both the foreign and domestic firms. ...|$|E

40|$|US {{antidumping}} (AD) {{policy can}} generate anticipatory effects on firms subject to AD duties {{because of a}} process called "administrative reviews" in which US government agencies determines refund rates based on exporters' most recent pricing behavior. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to assess the anticipatory effects from importers' and exporters' side by examining the US-Canada softwood lumber disputes. Using a demand estimation technique, we find evidence of the importers' anticipation: importers were less sensitive to tariff rates under the AD duties compared to standard tariffs, which indicates that the importers increased their volume of imports anticipating the future refund. We further show that the importers adjusted their anticipation adaptively, in the sense that the anticipated refund rate evolved according to the most recent revised rate of an <b>AD</b> <b>duty</b> released in the determination of an administrative review. On the other hand, using a pass-through regression, we find evidence of the exporters' anticipation: the pass-through of the AD duties into export prices (boarder prices) is larger than that of standard tariffs by about 41 % after controlling for unobserved demand shocks. The result indicates that the exporters set their prices higher under the AD duties in order to raise the future refund, which in turn increase their future profits through the evolution of the importers' anticipation. ...|$|E

In this paper, we examine China’s use of these TTBs both before and during the 2008 - 9 crisis in order to identify underlying historical trends and explore potential changes in their use over time. While the flow of new AD investigations increased during the crisis, China’s total stock of imports subject to AD measures decreased in terms of both count and value. Despite this decrease in the stock of imports subject to AD, we find a number of worrying trends. An increase in the flow of AD investigations during the crisis was a reversal of the trend from last five years. Second, prior to the crisis, almost all of China’s AD use was confined to only five Harmonized System (HS) sectors, however, during the crisis, some new AD investigations were in sectors that had never participated in AD earlier. In addition, a large number of China’s AD measures have lasted for longer than five years. At the end of 2009, only 40 % of the AD cases imposed five or more years ago have been removed. However, not all news is bad. The size of the ad valorem <b>AD</b> <b>duty</b> has decreased in recent years. Also, through 2009, very few Chinese firms have participated as petitioners with most of them participating only once. We also find several differences in China’s AD use across developed and developing trading partners both before and during the crisis. For instance, not only all of China’s AD measures through 2009 disproportionately targeted developed countries but also the entire increase in AD investigations by new sectors during the crisis years was directed against developed countries.
