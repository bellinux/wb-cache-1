5|$|An {{alignment}} {{is calculated}} {{by measuring the}} <b>azimuth,</b> the angle from north, of the structure and the altitude of the horizon it faces The <b>azimuth</b> is usually measured using a theodolite or a compass. A compass is easier to use, though the deviation of the Earth's magnetic field from true north, known as its magnetic declination {{must be taken into}} account. Compasses are also unreliable in areas prone to magnetic interference, such as sites being supported by scaffolding. Additionally a compass can only measure the <b>azimuth</b> to a precision of a half a degree.|$|E
5|$|As well as solar alignments, {{there are}} {{proposed}} lunar alignments. The four station stones mark out a rectangle. The short sides point towards the midsummer sunrise and midwinter sunset. The long sides if viewed towards the south-east, face the most southerly rising of the moon. Aveni notes that these lunar alignments have never gained the acceptance that the solar alignments have received. The Heel Stone <b>azimuth</b> is one-seventh of circumference, matching the latitude of Avebury, while summer solstice sunrise <b>azimuth</b> {{is no longer}} equal to the construction era direction.|$|E
5|$|The AI sets {{added to}} Beaufighters {{were the first}} to be mass-produced. The {{operating}} frequency was 190 to 195 MHz with a wavelength of 1.5 metres. The equipment consisted of a receiver, transmitter, control panel, modulator, indicator unit and a system of fixed dipole aerials. On the nose the aerial was a double arrowhead shape with a pair of <b>azimuth</b> aerials protruding above and below the leading edge of each wing between the cannon and the wingtip. A pair of elevation aerials were located above and below the wing surfaces near the RAF roundel on the starboard side. The indicator display consisted of two cathode ray tubes. They displayed elevation and <b>azimuth</b> bearing. The set had a range-limitation of four miles (circa 20,000 feet). The minimum range of detection was usually around 400 feet. At closer ranges the target merged with the transmission pulse and was obscured. At altitudes below 1,000 feet, the returns from ground objects would swamp the tubes. Operators like Rawnsley were left to do a fair amount of guesswork. No scales or calibration markings were put on early sets. The position and heading of the enemy in the <b>azimuth</b> plane, its height, and its range had to be guessed. At least the GCI could bring the Beaufighter well within range of the target, usually a mile or so behind the bomber.|$|E

5|$|For interception, {{the radar}} {{operator}} had {{to compare the}} length of the blips on the displays. If the blip was slightly longer on the right than left side of the <b>azimuth</b> display, for instance, he would instruct the pilot to turn right in an effort to centre the target. Interceptions normally resulted in a stream of left/right and up/down corrections while reading out the (hopefully) decreasing range.|$|E
5|$|The Mk. IV was {{a complex}} lash-up of systems, known collectively in the RAF as the Airborne Radio Installation 5003 (ARI 5003).

The horizontal velocities east of the CHNF are approximately 66  mm/year, N 270 °. The velocities gradually decrease westward to approximately 15  mm/year, N 259 °. The <b>azimuths</b> of velocities exhibit pseudo-counterclockwise rotation from EW to WSW. Most <b>azimuths</b> of velocities in the northern area are almost westward. However, the <b>azimuths</b> in the southern area rotate from nearly W (approximately 270 °) to WSW (approximately 255 °). A velocity gradient appears between the LCMF–HHAF–HCLF and the CHNF (Fig.  1).|$|R
40|$|The {{modality}} {{by which}} object <b>azimuths</b> (directions) are presented affects learning of multiple locations. In Experiment 1, participants learned sets {{of three and}} five object <b>azimuths</b> specified by a visual virtual environment, spatial audition (3 D sound), or auditory spatial language. Five <b>azimuths</b> were learned faster when specified by spatial modalities (vision, audition) than by language. Experiment 2 equated the modalities for proprioceptive cues and eliminated spatial cues unique to vision (optic flow) and audition (differential binaural signals). There remained a learning disadvantage for spatial language. We attribute this result {{to the cost of}} indirect processing from words to spatial representations...|$|R
5|$|The {{reference}} point (analogous to {{the origin of}} a Cartesian coordinate system) is called the pole, and the ray from the pole in the reference direction is the polar axis. The distance from the pole is called the radial coordinate or radius, and the angle is called the angular coordinate, polar angle, or <b>azimuth.</b>|$|E

The forward pair of thrusters is fixed, but the aft pair can swivel through 360°, removing {{the need for a}} rudder. The Queen Mary 2 is the first quadruple-propeller passenger ship completed since the SS France in 1961. Queen Mary 2 carries eight spare blades on the foredeck, immediately forward of the bridge screen.|$|E
5|$|Homing transponders {{are similar}} to IFF systems in general terms, but used shorter pulses. When a signal was {{received}} from the radar, the transponder responded with a short pulse on the same frequency, the original radar pulse would not be reflected {{so there was no}} need to lengthen the signal as in the case of IFF. The pulse was sent to the Mk. IV's display and appeared as a sharp blip. Depending on the location of the transponder relative to the aircraft, the blip would be longer on the left or right of the <b>azimuth</b> display, allowing the operator to guide the aircraft to the transponder using exactly the same methods as a conventional aircraft intercept.|$|E

5000|$|In {{addition}} to the operational advantages, OBC also has geophysical advantages over a conventional NATS survey that arise from the increased fold and wider range of <b>azimuths</b> associated with the survey geometry. [...] However, much like a land survey, the wider <b>azimuths</b> and increased fold come at a cost and the ability for large-scale OBC surveys is severely limited.|$|R

5|$|The inputs {{operated}} by the bomb-aimer's mate drove a mechanical calculator inside the console, or computor. The output of the calculator drove flexible shafts that rotated the sight head to the proper angles in <b>azimuth</b> and altitude, representing the wind drift and range angle. The sight head replaced the older wire crosshairs with a modern reflector sight that {{was easy to see}} at night. The sight could be rotated manually to view objects well in front of the aircraft, allowing the bomb aimer to select among a wider variety of objects to use for drift measurements.|$|E
5|$|While {{the stars}} are fixed to their declinations the Sun is not. The rising point of the Sun varies {{throughout}} the year. It swings between two limits marked by the solstices {{a bit like a}} pendulum, slowing as it reaches the extremes, but passing rapidly through the midpoint. If an archaeoastronomer can calculate from the <b>azimuth</b> and horizon height that a site was built to view a declination of +23.5° then he or she need not wait until 21 June to confirm the site does indeed face the summer solstice. For more information see History of solar observation.|$|E
5|$|Each {{receiver}} antenna {{was sent to}} one of the channels of the displays in turn, causing one of the displays to refresh. For instance, at a given instant the switch might be set to send the signal to {{the left side of the}} <b>azimuth</b> display. The timebase generator was triggered to start sweeping the CRT dot up the screen after the transmission ended. Reflections would cause the dot to be deflected to the left, creating a blip whose vertical location could be measured against a scale to determine range. The switch would then move to the next position and cause the right-hand side of the display to be redrawn, but the signal inverted so the dot moved to the right. The switching occurred fast enough that the display looked continuous.|$|E
30|$|Frissell et al. (2016) studied {{sources and}} {{characteristics}} of MSTIDs in the North American sector using HF radar. They focused on MSTIDs observed during the winter daytime. They found {{that a majority of}} MSTIDs propagated equatorward in this period, which is similar to our observations. Oinats et al. (2015) studied MSTIDs using the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network in Hokkaido, i.e., a location that is more poleward than Taiwan. Northeastward propagating MSTIDs were typical for summer and equinox. In Taiwan, we also observe northeastward propagating MSTIDs in summer; however, they are more often observed in the evening hours. Southeast <b>azimuths</b> prevailed in winter daytime. We also observe southeast <b>azimuths</b> in Taiwan in this period, as shown in Fig.  8. Oinats et al. (2015) also observed southwest <b>azimuths</b> in the summer, equinox nighttime, and equinox evening and northwest <b>azimuths</b> in summer daytime and evening; similar observations are not found in our observations from Taiwan.|$|R

3000|$|All {{canonical}} buildings {{described in}} Figure 1 have been illuminated with plane waves. A total of nine distinct incidences have been used, combination of three <b>azimuths</b> { 0 °, 40 °, 80 °} and three elevations { 0 °, 40 °, 80 °}. To allow a global interpretation, the incidences were grouped into two different sets: [...] "typical LMS incidence" [...] for elevations and <b>azimuths</b> smaller {{or equal to}} 40 ° (four cases) and [...] "extreme LMS incidence" [...] for larger elevations or <b>azimuths</b> (five cases). The source was linearly polarised, θ and φ, at a frequency of 1.5 GHz. The θ polarisation represents a generalised case of vertical polarisation for non-null elevations while the φ polarisation represents horizontal polarisation.|$|R
5|$|Most of {{the fossils}} {{discovered}} in the Mussentuchit are scattered and disarticulated, with intact skeletons being relatively rare. Although the lakes did not actively destroy bones, it was not particularly conducive to good preservation either due to the long duration of the burial process. Before burial, scavengers could have disrupted the skeletal material, which {{is evident in the}} severed Eolambia tibiae bearing tooth marks {{discovered in the}} Cifelli #2 quarry. The regression of the lake could have occasionally created bogs, but they would not have been permanent enough to entrap and preserve larger vertebrates. Action by water currents seems to {{have played a role in}} the deposition of Eolambia bones in the Cifelli #2 quarry, where the bones are largely deposited at 28°, 69°, 93°, 131° and 161° <b>azimuth</b> (i.e. relative to north). These directions would have been parallel or sub-parallel to the edges of the lake, indicating orientation by lake currents, except for the 69° and 93° azimuths, which probably represent river currents.|$|E
5|$|The {{barn owl}} has acute hearing, with ears placed asymmetrically. This {{improves}} detection of sound position and distance {{and the bird}} does not require sight to hunt. The facial disc plays a part in this process, as is shown {{by the fact that}} with the ruff feathers removed, the bird can still locate the source in <b>azimuth</b> but fails to do so in elevation. Hunting nocturnally or crepuscularly, this bird can target its prey and dive to the ground, penetrating its talons through snow, grass or brush to seize small creatures with deadly accuracy. Compared to other owls of similar size, the barn owl has a much higher metabolic rate, requiring relatively more food. Weight for weight, barn owls consume more rodents—often regarded as pests by humans—than possibly any other creature. This makes the barn owl one of the most economically valuable wildlife animals for agriculture. Farmers often find these owls more effective than poison in keeping down rodent pests, and they can encourage barn owl habitation by providing nest sites.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the bomb}} run {{the pilot was}} {{directed}} to fly the aircraft in several different directions in sequence, preferably about 120 degrees apart. On each leg, the bomb aimer used the reticle to measure the drift angle, either by rotating the wind direction dial on the computor to get the sight head to the right angle, or by unlocking the <b>azimuth</b> control from the computor and turning the sight manually. The drift angle was whatever angle the sight head was pointing when objects on the ground could {{be seen to be}} moving along the line on the sight. Once measured, the angle of the aircraft and the angle of the drift (measured either from the dial on the computor or the scale on the sight) were recorded. Using the Mk. III Navigation Computor, the RAF's version of the modern E6B, the three sets of angles were entered on the wind calculator face. This normally resulted in a small triangular area forming where the three lines came close to meeting, and the centre of this triangle revealed the wind speed and direction. This value was then entered into the computor.|$|E
40|$|It is {{examined}} whether {{there may be}} preferred <b>azimuths</b> for earth-satellite paths along which fading and space diversity statistics are influenced differently than along other <b>azimuths.</b> Such preferred directions may exist if individual rain cells are statistically elongated along them for the given climatological region. The analysis is performed using the rain reflectivity data base obtained at Wallops Island during June, July and August 1973 using a high resolution radar. It is found that {{in the vicinity of}} Wallops Island increased attenuation and poorer diversity gains exist along paths whose <b>azimuths</b> and base lines lie in the NE-SW quadrants as compared to the NW-SE sectors. This result suggests the dominance of the major axis of rain cells in these quadrants...|$|R

The other model, by Sykes et al. (1982), uses rates and <b>azimuths</b> inferred from the geometry of the Lesser Antilles Wadati-Benioff zone. Overall, {{it is found that}} the data fit the Jordan geometry better, that the data used in global plate motion models are more suitable than rates and <b>azimuths</b> inferred from the geometry of the Wadati-Benioff zone for determining relative motions, and that incorporation of all relevant plate boundaries is essential...|$|R
5|$|Uxmal is a Mayan {{city in the}} Puuc Hills of Yucatán Peninsula, Mexico. The Governor's Palace at Uxmal {{is often}} used as an exemplar of why it is {{important}} to combine ethnographic and alignment data. The palace is aligned with an <b>azimuth</b> of 118° on the pyramid of Cehtzuc. This alignment corresponds approximately to the southernmost rising and, with a much greater precision, to the northernmost setting of Venus; both phenomena occur once every eight years. By itself this would not be sufficient to argue for a meaningful connection between the two events. The palace has to be aligned in one direction or another and why should the rising of Venus be any more important than the rising of the Sun, Moon, other planets, Sirius et cetera? The answer given is that not only does the palace point towards significant points of Venus, it is also covered in glyphs which stand for Venus and Mayan zodiacal constellations. Moreover, the great northerly extremes of Venus always occur in late April or early May, coinciding with the onset of the rainy season. The Venus glyphs placed in the cheeks of the Maya rain god Chac, most likely referring to the concomitance of these phenomena, support the west-working orientation scheme.|$|E
