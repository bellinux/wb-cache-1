5|$|Although its {{equations}} {{of motion}} can be linearized, <b>a</b> <b>bike</b> is a nonlinear system. The variable(s) to be solved for cannot be written as a linear sum of independent components, i.e. its behavior is not expressible as a sum of the behaviors of its descriptors. Generally, nonlinear systems are difficult to solve and are much less understandable than linear systems. In the idealized case, in which friction and any flexing is ignored, <b>a</b> <b>bike</b> is a conservative system. Damping, however, can still be demonstrated: under the right circumstances, side-to-side oscillations will decrease with time. Energy added with a sideways jolt to <b>a</b> <b>bike</b> running straight and upright (demonstrating self-stability) is converted into increased forward speed, not lost, as the oscillations die out.|$|E

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>bike</b> is also {{an example}} of an {{inverted}} pendulum. Just as a broomstick is more easily balanced in the hand than a pencil, a tall bike (with a high center of mass) can be easier to balance when ridden than a low one because the tall bike's lean rate (rate at which its angle of lean increases as it begins to fall over) will be slower. However, a rider can have the opposite impression of <b>a</b> <b>bike</b> when it is stationary. A top-heavy bike can require more effort to keep upright, when stopped in traffic for example, than <b>a</b> <b>bike</b> which is just as tall but with a lower center of mass. This {{is an example of a}} vertical second-class lever. A small force at the end of the lever, the seat or handlebars at the top of the bike, more easily moves a large mass if the mass is closer to the fulcrum, where the tires touch the ground. This is why touring cyclists are advised to carry loads low on <b>a</b> <b>bike,</b> and panniers hang down on either side of front and rear racks.|$|E
2500|$|Trail — <b>A</b> trail <b>bike</b> is <b>a</b> dual-purpose <b>bike,</b> {{made for}} on-road and {{recreational}} off-road riding. [...] <b>A</b> trail <b>bike</b> may resemble <b>an</b> enduro <b>bike,</b> but since <b>a</b> trail <b>bike</b> {{is not intended}} to be used for competition, it may be less rugged, and equipped with dual-purpose tires and with more road legal equipment, such as indicators, mirrors and extra instruments.|$|R

5|$|Cyclists can deter {{attack by}} {{attaching}} a long pole with a flag to <b>a</b> <b>bike,</b> {{and the use}} of cable ties on helmets has become common and appears to be effective.|$|E
5|$|If the {{steering}} of <b>a</b> <b>bike</b> is locked, it becomes {{virtually impossible to}} balance while riding. On the other hand, if the gyroscopic effect of rotating bike wheels is cancelled by adding counter-rotating wheels, it is still easy to balance while riding. One other way that <b>a</b> <b>bike</b> can be balanced, with or without locked steering, is by applying appropriate torques between the bike and rider {{similar to the way}} a gymnast can swing up from hanging straight down on uneven parallel bars, a person can start swinging on a swing from rest by pumping their legs, or a double inverted pendulum can be controlled with an actuator only at the elbow.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>bike</b> remains upright {{when it is}} steered so {{that the}} ground {{reaction}} forces exactly balance all the other internal and external forces it experiences, such as gravitational if leaning, inertial or centrifugal if in a turn, gyroscopic if being steered, and aerodynamic if in a crosswind.|$|E

5|$|Another {{option for}} travel in Gifu is via bicycle.

5|$|Around 1939, the old aqueduct, {{which was}} now a popular hiking trail, started {{becoming}} a popular route with cyclists. Soon after, there was a proposal to redevelop the trail as <b>a</b> <b>bike</b> path. This proposal never came to fruition, although in the mid-1970s, the city built a separate bike path along Mosholu Parkway, the Bronx River Parkway, and Pelham Parkway between Jerome Avenue and Pelham Bay Park.|$|E
5|$|Bike {{maneuverability}} {{and handling}} {{is difficult to}} quantify for several reasons. The geometry of <b>a</b> <b>bike,</b> especially the steering axis angle makes kinematic analysis complicated. Under many conditions, bikes are inherently unstable and must always be under rider control. Finally, the rider's skill has a large influence on the bike's performance in any maneuver. Bike designs tend to consist of a trade-off between maneuverability and stability.|$|E

5|$|Motions of <b>a</b> <b>bike</b> can {{be roughly}} grouped into those {{out of the}} central plane of symmetry: lateral; {{and those in the}} central plane of symmetry: {{longitudinal}} or vertical. Lateral motions include balancing, leaning, steering, and turning. Motions in the central plane of symmetry include rolling forward, of course, but also stoppies, wheelies, brake diving, and most suspension activation. Motions in these two groups are linearly decoupled, that is they do not interact with each other to the first order. An uncontrolled bike is laterally unstable when stationary and can be laterally self-stable when moving under the right conditions or when controlled by a rider. Conversely, <b>a</b> <b>bike</b> is longitudinally stable when stationary and can be longitudinally unstable when undergoing sufficient acceleration or deceleration.|$|E

5|$|One {{study has}} shown {{theoretically}} that, while <b>a</b> <b>bike</b> leaned in a turn, road undulations can excite the weave mode {{at high speed}} or the wobble mode at low speed if either of their frequencies match the vehicle speed and other parameters. Excitation of the wobble mode can be mitigated by an effective steering damper and excitation of the weave mode is worse for light riders than for heavy riders.|$|E

5|$|The {{effect that}} the design {{parameters}} of <b>a</b> <b>bike</b> have on these modes can be investigated by examining the eigenvalues of the linearized equations of motion. For more details on the equations of motion and eigenvalues, see the section on the equations of motion above. Some general conclusions that have been drawn are described here.|$|E
5|$|These designs, {{such as the}} Python Lowracer, a recumbent, {{usually have}} very lax head angles (40° to 65°) and {{positive}} or even negative trail. The builder of <b>a</b> <b>bike</b> with negative trail states that steering the bike from straight ahead forces the seat (and thus the rider) to rise slightly and this offsets the destabilizing effect of the negative trail.|$|E
