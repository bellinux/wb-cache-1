40|$|Silicon carbide is {{of great}} {{interest}} for structural use in aircraft and automobile engines. This ceramic combines high thermal conductivity and low coefficient of thermal expansion, and consequently has good thermal shock resistance. However, like other ceramics, silicon carbide shows strength variability due to processing flaws such as large voids, shrinkage cracks, and inclusions. Agglomerates in the starting powder {{seem to be the}} predominant cause of such defects. Improved processing techniques such as slurry <b>pressing</b> <b>and</b> hot isostatic <b>pressing</b> (HIP) were employed to minimize these defects and to improve strength and reliability in the fabricated material. For this purpose 2 -inch diameter disks were fabricated by various consolidation techniques. These include: dry <b>pressing</b> <b>and</b> sintering, slurry <b>pressing</b> <b>and</b> sintering, <b>and</b> slurry <b>pressing</b> <b>and</b> HIPing. The results are discussed...|$|R

5|$|With Iraqi independence, the new Assyrian spiritual-temporal leader, Mar Eshai Shimun XXIII the Catholicos Patriarch of the Assyrian Church of the East, {{demanded the}} Assyrians be given {{autonomy}} within Iraq, seeking {{support from the}} United Kingdom <b>and</b> <b>pressing</b> his case before the League of Nations in 1932. His followers planned to resign from the Assyrian Levies (a military force {{under the command of}} the British that served British interests) and to re-group as a militia and concentrate in the north, creating a de facto Assyrian enclave.|$|E
5|$|Corpses {{thought to}} be vampires were {{generally}} described as having a healthier appearance than expected, plump and showing little or no signs of decomposition. In some cases, when suspected graves were opened, villagers even described the corpse as having fresh blood from a victim all over its face. Evidence that a vampire was active in a given locality included death of cattle, sheep, relatives or neighbours. Folkloric vampires could also make their presence felt by engaging in minor poltergeist-like activity, such as hurling stones on roofs or moving household objects, <b>and</b> <b>pressing</b> on people in their sleep.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, as {{evolutionary}} theorists {{explored the}} possibility of multiple units of selection, ecologists turned to evolutionary approaches. In population ecology, debate over group selection was brief but vigorous; by 1970, most biologists agreed that natural selection was rarely effective above the level of individual organisms. The evolution of ecosystems, however, became a lasting research focus. Ecology expanded rapidly {{with the rise of}} the environmental movement; the International Biological Program attempted to apply the methods of big science (which had been so successful in the physical sciences) to ecosystem ecology <b>and</b> <b>pressing</b> environmental issues, while smaller-scale independent efforts such as island biogeography and the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest helped redefine the scope of an increasingly diverse discipline.|$|E

5|$|John Buchan's brigade skirmished {{with the}} French {{defenders}} of Orthez all morning. Having received orders {{to cross the}} Gave de Pau, Hill got his troops marching for the Souars Ford at 11:00 am. Arriving there, the 12,000 Anglo-Portuguese brushed aside the cavalry regiment and two battalions of the 115th Line Infantry Regiment defending the ford. Hill's troops were soon across the river in strength <b>and</b> <b>pressing</b> back Harispe's outnumbered division. They were joined by Buchan's Portuguese who crossed at the Orthez bridge the moment the town's defenders pulled out. Joined by some newly arrived conscript battalions, Harispe attempted to make a stand at the Motte de Tury heights. The raw recruits proved to be poor fighting material; Hill's men broke Harispe's line and captured three guns.|$|E
5|$|On 2 February, the Red Army {{launched}} Operation Star, {{threatening to}} recapture the cities of Belgorod, Kharkov and Kursk. A Soviet drive, spearheaded by four tank corps organized under Lieutenant-General Markian Popov, pierced the German front by crossing the Donets River <b>and</b> <b>pressing</b> into the German rear. On 15 February, two fresh Soviet tank corps threatened the city of Zaporizhia on the Dnieper River, which controlled the last major road to Rostov and housed the headquarters of Army Group South and Luftflotte 4 (Air Fleet Four). Despite Hitler's orders to hold the city, Kharkov was abandoned by German forces and the city was recaptured by the Red Army on 16 February.|$|E
5|$|Ryu has {{the ability}} to jump on and off ladders and walls, and by using the {{directional}} pad, he can climb up or down ladders. Ryu can spring off walls by holding the directional pad in the opposite direction he is facing <b>and</b> <b>pressing</b> the jump button. He cannot attack while on walls or ladders. Players can use this technique to get Ryu to climb up spaces between walls and columns by holding down the jump button and alternating between left and right on the directional pad. Ryu can also vertically climb a single wall by springing off it and then quickly pressing the directional pad back towards the wall.|$|E

5|$|In 1943, Thurman and {{her husband}} moved to San Francisco. She wrote several {{articles}} about their Asian trip, analyzing information, discussing their meeting with Gandhi <b>and</b> <b>pressing</b> for scholarship exchanges for negro students at Indian universities. It was from the Thurmans and their talks and writings that Martin Luther King Jr. learned of non-violent resistance {{as a means of}} social protest. By 1944, the church which they had envisioned after their meeting with Gandhi became a reality when they, along with Fisk, opened the Church for the Fellowship of All Peoples. It was the first interracial, non-denominational church in the United States. While her husband assumed the pastoral duties, Thurman organized forums and lectures for the members to learn about other peoples such as Native Americans, Africans, Asians and their cultures, covering everything from the Jews to the Navajos.|$|E
5|$|In {{the ensuing}} years, Abdullah leaves Afghanistan and Mr. Wahdati suffers a stroke, {{prompting}} Nila to take Pari {{and move to}} Paris, France. Nabi, while assuming the role of Wahdati's primary caregiver, finds a number of sketchbooks in Wahdati's closet filled with pictures of him drawn before the stroke. Unnerved by the discovery that Mr. Wahdati loves him, he resolves to leave but decides against it after {{he is unable to}} find someone suitable to take over for him. Nabi subsequently spends the next 50 years working for Mr. Wahdati. He develops a deep bond with his employer, and Nabi comes to the realization that his purpose is to take care of Mr. Wahdati. Later Mr. Wahdati's health deteriorates further, and Nabi helps him commit assisted suicide by kissing him on the lips <b>and</b> <b>pressing</b> a pillow over his face.|$|E
5|$|Glass welding is {{a common}} {{practice}} during glassblowing. It is used very often {{in the construction of}} lighting, neon signs, flashtubes, scientific equipment, and the manufacture of dishes and other glassware. It is also used during glass casting for joining the halves of glass molds, making items such as bottles and jars. Welding glass is accomplished by heating the glass through the glass transition, turning it into a thick, formable, liquid mass. Heating is usually done with a gas or oxy-gas torch, or a furnace, because the temperatures for melting glass are often quite high. This temperature may vary, {{depending on the type of}} glass. For example, lead glass becomes a weldable liquid at around , and can be welded with a simple propane torch. On the other hand, quartz glass (fused silica) must be heated to over , but quickly loses its viscosity and formability if overheated, so an oxyhydrogen torch must be used. Sometimes a tube may be attached to the glass, allowing it to be blown into various shapes, such as bulbs, bottles, or tubes. When two pieces of liquid glass are pressed together, they will usually weld very readily. Welding a handle onto a pitcher can usually be done with relative ease. However, when welding a tube to another tube, a combination of blowing and suction, <b>and</b> <b>pressing</b> and pulling is used to ensure a good seal, to shape the glass, and to keep the surface tension from closing the tube in on itself. Sometimes a filler rod may be used, but usually not.|$|E

5|$|In 1885, Burchard was succeeded as Mint {{director}} by James Kimball. The {{new director}} was {{more receptive to}} Gilder's ideas and in 1887 announced a competition for new designs for the non-gold coinage. These plans were scuttled when Vermont Senator Justin Morrill questioned the Mint's authority to produce new designs. The Mint had claimed authority under the Coinage Act of 1873 in issuing the Morgan dollar in 1878 and the Liberty Head nickel in 1883. Morrill was a supporter of coin redesign and {{had in the past}} introduced bills to accomplish this; he felt, however, that this could not be done without an act of Congress. Kimball submitted the issue to government lawyers; they indicated that the Mint lacked the claimed authority. All three men worked to secure a bill to authorize new designs: Morrill by introducing <b>and</b> <b>pressing</b> legislation, Kimball by lobbying for the authority in his annual report, and Gilder by orchestrating favorable coverage. With legislators busy with other matters, it was not until September 26, 1890 that President Benjamin Harrison signed legislation making all denominations of U.S. coins available for immediate redesign by the Mint upon obtaining the Secretary of the Treasury's approval. Each coin could thereafter be altered from the 25th year after it was first produced; for example, a coin first struck in 1892 would be eligible for redesign in 1916.|$|E

40|$|Rats pressed keys or levers {{for water}} {{reinforcers}} delivered by several multiple variable-interval schedules. The programmed rate of reinforcement varied from 15 to 240 reinforcers per hour in different conditions. Responding usually increased and then decreased within experimental sessions. As for food reinforcers, the within-session changes in both lever <b>and</b> key <b>pressing</b> were smaller, peaked later, {{and were more}} symmetrical around {{the middle of the}} session for lower than for higher rates of reinforcement. When schedules provided high rates of reinforcement, some quantitative differences appeared in the within-session changes for lever <b>and</b> key <b>pressing</b> <b>and</b> for food and water. These results imply that basically similar factors produce within-session changes in responding for lever <b>and</b> key <b>pressing</b> <b>and</b> for food and water. The nature of the reinforcer and the choice of response can also influence the quantitative properties of within-session changes at high rates of reinforcement. Finally, the results show that the application of Herrnstein's (1970) equation to rates of responding averaged over the session requires careful consideration...|$|R
