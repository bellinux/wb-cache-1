40|$|The mobile games sector {{seems to}} be one of the fast growing {{industries}} due to the rising of mobile market. With the advancement of mobile technology, mobile devices can now be used as a mobile media centre. One of the emerging areas is also in using it for gaming, like a portable game console. However, players may have different preferences in what genres of games they will be more interested in <b>at</b> <b>different</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> the day. Furthermore, it can sometimes be difficult to use mobile internet to download the interested games <b>at</b> <b>different</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> the day. In this paper, a personalised mobile game recommendation system which takes into consideration the time-of-day and time-of-week is proposed. From the data collected, it can be seen that <b>at</b> <b>different</b> <b>time</b> periods users may download different games and from different game genres...|$|R

5|$|Barbary falcons have a {{red neck}} patch but {{otherwise}} differ in appearance from the peregrine proper merely according to Gloger's Rule, relating pigmentation to environmental humidity. The Barbary falcon has a peculiar way of flying, beating only {{the outer part}} of its wings like fulmars sometimes do; this also occurs in the peregrine, but less often and far less pronounced. The Barbary falcon's shoulder and pelvis bones are stout by comparison with the peregrine, and its feet are smaller. Barbary falcons breed <b>at</b> <b>different</b> <b>times</b> <b>of</b> year than neighboring peregrine falcon subspecies, but {{they are capable of}} interbreeding. There is a 0.6–0.7% genetic distance in the peregrine-Barbary falcon ("peregrinoid") complex.|$|E
5|$|Because the Earth's axis is tilted {{relative}} to its orbital plane, sunlight is incident at different angles <b>at</b> <b>different</b> <b>times</b> <b>of</b> the year. In June the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun, so {{at any given}} Northern Hemisphere latitude sunlight falls more directly on that spot than in December (see Effect of sun angle on climate). This effect causes seasons. Over thousands {{to hundreds of thousands}} of years, changes in Earth's orbital parameters affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth and influence long-term climate. (See Milankovitch cycles).|$|E
5|$|For a {{relatively}} small fee, entrance could be gained by {{any member of the}} general public to the Bath complex. While the area was obviously primarily used for public bathing, one could exercise and enjoy a variety of recreational activities. Attendants were paid to oversee these activities, and the happenings of the complex, enforcing opening and closing times, and the rules of conduct. Men and women were not allowed to bathe together; they would either be in separate baths, or bathe <b>at</b> <b>different</b> <b>times</b> <b>of</b> the day.|$|E

5|$|Fossil {{evidence}} indicates that other notable species of sharks, such as the great white shark, responded to competitive pressure from megalodon by avoiding regions it inhabited by mainly inhabiting the cooler waters of the time. In areas where their ranges seemed to overlap, such as in Pliocene Baja California, {{it is possible that}} megalodon and the great white shark occupied the area <b>at</b> <b>different</b> <b>times</b> <b>of</b> the year while following different migratory prey. Megalodon probably also had a tendency for cannibalism, much like contemporary sharks.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Broadcasting Corporation {{stated that}} it wished to run up to four multichannels <b>at</b> <b>different</b> <b>times</b> <b>of</b> the day or {{alternatively}} offer an HDTV service. It claimed that up to $100 million {{would be needed to}} prepare for these services, half of which would need to be government-funded. Other interested parties, such as internet service provider OzEmail argued for the provision of spectrum for interactive services, while Telstra, shareholder in the subscription television provider Foxtel, supported ASTRA's argument for a competitive bidding process for digital spectrum.|$|E
5|$|Aveni {{states that}} one of the {{strengths}} of the Brown methodology is that it can explore astronomies invisible to statistical analysis and offers the astronomy of the Incas as another example. The empire of the Incas was conceptually divided using ceques radial routes emanating from the capital at Cusco. Thus there are alignments in all directions which would suggest there is little of astronomical significance, However, ethnohistorical records show that the various directions do have cosmological and astronomical significance with various points in the landscape being significant <b>at</b> <b>different</b> <b>times</b> <b>of</b> the year. In eastern Asia archaeoastronomy has developed from the History of Astronomy and much archaeoastronomy is searching for material correlates of the historical record. This is due to the rich historical record of astronomical phenomena which, in China, stretches back into the Han dynasty, in the second century BC.|$|E

Specific {{surface area of}} the ground fly ash was found out by using BET method. The samples were degassed at 350 °C before testing. The surface energy of the samples was calculated by measuring contact angle. The powder contact angles were found out using Dynamic Contact angle Tester (DCAT) from Dataphysics, UK.|$|R

Nowadays, it is easy to obtain crowdsourced data; this would be an excellent source of audio content for such a system. A larger set of source recordings would allow creating more versatile content compared to rearranging segments from a single recording. However, this would also need paying attention to possible acoustical mismatches between recordings, e.g., recorded <b>at</b> <b>different</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> the day.|$|R

5|$|Several {{sets were}} {{rendered}} digitally, {{and almost all}} of the sets had some form of digital enhancement. The largest digital environment was the Devetashka cave, which had to be digitally recreated because of the environmental concerns of filming explosions in the real cave. Using over 5,000 photographs taken <b>at</b> <b>different</b> <b>times</b> <b>of</b> day, the cave was accurately illuminated and rendered down to crevices and moss. The cave's interior containing a concealed nuclear vault was subjected to several changes up to two months before the effects' delivery date based on editorial input, including modifications to its scale. The railcar used within the cave was also digitally built alongside a practical version, but the digital versions versatility saw it largely replace its practical counterpart. The scene featuring the Expendables and prisoners trapped in the cave were shot entirely on Chroma key with the cave background inserted later.|$|E
5|$|Social {{behaviour}} {{is influenced}} by the climate and geography; as such, the impala are territorial at certain times of the year and gregarious at other times, and the length of these periods can vary broadly among populations. For instance, populations in southern Africa display territorial behaviour only during the few months of the rut, whereas in eastern African populations, territoriality is relatively minimal despite a protracted mating season. Moreover, territorial males often tolerate bachelors, and may even alternate between bachelorhood and territoriality <b>at</b> <b>different</b> <b>times</b> <b>of</b> the year. A study of impala in the Serengeti National Park showed that in 94% of the males, territoriality was observed for less than four months.|$|E
5|$|The {{black bean}} aphid has both sexual and asexual generations in its life cycle. It also {{alternates}} hosts <b>at</b> <b>different</b> <b>times</b> <b>of</b> year. The primary host plants are woody shrubs, and eggs are laid on these by winged {{females in the}} autumn. The adults then die and the eggs overwinter. The aphids that hatch from these eggs in the spring are wingless females known as stem mothers. These are able to reproduce asexually, giving birth to live offspring, nymphs, through parthenogenesis. The lifespan of a parthenogenetic female is about 50 days and during this period, each can produce as many as 30 young. The offspring are also females and able to reproduce without mating, but further generations are usually winged forms. These migrate to their secondary host plants, completely different species that are typically herbaceous plants with soft, young growth.|$|E

5|$|The blue-faced honeyeater {{appears to}} be {{generally}} sedentary within its range, especially {{in much of the}} Northern Territory, Queensland and New South Wales. However, in many places (generally south of the Tropic of Capricorn), populations may be present or absent <b>at</b> <b>different</b> <b>times</b> <b>of</b> the year, although this appears to result from nomadic rather than seasonal migratory movements. Around Wellington in central New South Wales, birds were recorded over winter months, and were more common in autumn around the Talbragar River. Birds were present all year round near Inverell in northern New South Wales, but noted to be flying eastwards from January to May, and westwards in June and July. In Jandowae in southeastern Queensland, birds were regularly recorded flying north and east from March to June, and returning south and west in July and August, and were absent from the area in spring and summer.|$|E
5|$|The {{combination}} {{of wind and}} solar PV has the advantage that the two sources complement each other because the peak operating times for each system occur <b>at</b> <b>different</b> <b>times</b> <b>of</b> the day and year. The power generation of such solar hybrid power systems is therefore more constant and fluctuates less than {{each of the two}} component subsystems. Solar power is seasonal, particularly in northern/southern climates, away from the equator, suggesting a need for long term seasonal storage in a medium such as hydrogen or pumped hydroelectric. The Institute for Solar Energy Supply Technology of the University of Kassel pilot-tested a combined power plant linking solar, wind, biogas and hydrostorage to provide load-following power from renewable sources.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{sound and}} music were handled by Takahiro Ogata, Masaki Kurokawa and Kenichi Tsuchiya: Ogata acted as sound director. To {{accurately}} create {{the sound of}} modern-day Tokyo within Nine, Ogata and Kurokawa went to districts such as Kichijōji and Roppongi to make recordings of ambient sounds <b>at</b> <b>different</b> <b>times</b> <b>of</b> day. While {{there was a general}} theme for various city districts, the music subtly changed depending on the player's overall alignment: for instance, to represent the Law and Chaos alignments in the game, piano was used for the former and guitar for the latter. Battle music also featured randomly-generated soundtrack variations, with Ogata estimating somewhere over three hundred possible variants on battle themes. A major improvement enabled by the Xbox was the use of 5.1 surround sound, which could enable richer use of both music and in-game sound effects. According to Okada, this additional sound capacity would compensate for what could not be managed at a visual level. Maken X had already given the team a chance to use 3D sound, but Nine was the first title to make major use of 5.1, and implementing it alongside all the other features proved a challenge for the team.|$|E
