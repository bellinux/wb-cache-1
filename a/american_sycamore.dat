5|$|It was in 1955 {{that the}} tree won {{recognition}} from the American Forests Association {{as the largest}} tree of its species in the United States. It only held the title for three weeks before a larger <b>American</b> <b>sycamore</b> in Maryland was discovered and recognized by the association.

5|$|The Webster Sycamore {{had long}} been a local {{landmark}} on account of its age and size, and was known locally as being the world's largest <b>American</b> <b>sycamore.</b> By 1920, author Edwin Lincoln Mosely had included an image and {{a brief description of}} a similar <b>American</b> <b>sycamore</b> near Webster Springs– probably the Webster Sycamore– in his book Trees, Stars and Birds: A Book of Outdoor Science.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{founding}} of the city, the area was mostly prairie and open forest. Native Americans maintained this environment, good for hunting, by burning underbrush. Trees are mainly oak, maple, and hickory, similar to the forests of the nearby Ozarks; common understory trees include eastern redbud, serviceberry, and flowering dogwood. Riparian areas are forested with mainly <b>American</b> <b>sycamore.</b>|$|E

50|$|In 1968 and 1970, Frank S. Santamour, Jr., recreated the P. orientalis, P. occidentalis cross using a P. orientalis of Turkish origin with <b>American</b> <b>sycamores</b> (P. occidentalis). The {{offspring}} {{were evaluated}} following {{several years of}} exposure to anthracnose infection. Two selections, 'Columbia' and 'Liberty', were released in August, 1984.|$|R
50|$|One major mystery {{surrounds}} the forest. Large sandstone boulders, estimated to weigh about 200 pounds (90 kg), {{have been found}} in the tops of three trees: one eighty-foot (24 m) tall chestnut oak and two <b>American</b> <b>sycamores,</b> one of which is 45 ft tall. Speculation as to how the boulders got there ranges from college pranks, tornadoes, ancient hunters to UFOs.|$|R
25|$|In {{the eastern}} US, the gypsy moth prefers oaks, aspen, apple, sweetgum, {{speckled}} alder, basswood, gray birch, paper birch, poplar, willow, and hawthorns, among other species. Older larvae feed on {{several species of}} softwood that younger larvae avoid, including cottonwood, hemlock, Atlantic white cypress, and pine and spruce species native to the east. The gypsy moth avoids ash trees, tulip-tree, <b>American</b> <b>sycamore,</b> butternut, black walnut, catalpa, flowering dogwood, balsam fir, cedar, American holly, and mountain laurel and rhododendron shrubs, but will feed on these in late instars when densities are extremely high.|$|E
25|$|The first {{settlers}} {{in what would}} be Newburgh Township were David Bryant and his son, Whitman, who arrived in June 1797. East of the Portage Escarpment, they found dense forests of <b>American</b> <b>sycamore,</b> beech, black walnut, eastern hemlock, eastern redcedar, northern red oak, Ohio buckeye, shagbark hickory, sugar maple, and white oak. West of the escarpment were American elm, ash, beech, and black cherry. In some places, settlers would have seen artificial meadows, created by Native Americans using controlled fire. On the flats which formed {{the valley of the}} Cuyahoga River bluegrass, white clover, and wild rye grew in profusion. American bison, eastern elk, and the extremely plentiful white-tailed deer were the most common game animals inhabiting the area. Canada geese, ducks, grouse, passenger pigeon, quail, and wild turkey were the most common game fowl.|$|E
25|$|There are {{at least}} 29 tree species that Indiana bats use during the summer. The {{greatest}} number of tree species {{are found in the}} central portion of Indiana bats' range (primarily Missouri, southern Illinois, southern Indiana, and Kentucky), but this is likely because the majority of research conducted on the species has occurred in this region. Roost trees from these central states, which are mainly in the oak-hickory cover type, include silver maple, red maple (Acer rubrum), sugar maple (A. saccharum), white oak (Q. alba), red oak (Q. rubra), pin oak (Q. palustris), scarlet oak (Q. coccinea), post oak (Q. stellata), shingle oak (Q. imbricaria), eastern cottonwood, shagbark hickory, bitternut hickory, mockernut hickory (C. alba), pignut hickory (C. glabra), American elm, slippery elm (Ulmus rubra), honey locust (Gleditsia triacanthos), sourwood (Oxydendrum arboreum), green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), white ash (F. americana), Virginia pine (Pinus virginiana), <b>American</b> <b>sycamore</b> (Platanus occidentalis), and sassafras (Sassafras albidum).|$|E
50|$|The {{island was}} so {{named after the}} wild grapevines which once covered the island. Grape Island is forested, {{predominantly}} with <b>American</b> <b>sycamores.</b> The island serves as a habitat for great blue heron, wood ducks, cormorants, Canada geese, and migrating loons and tundra swans. Because of its diversity in wildlife, Grape Island {{is a part of}} the Ohio River Islands National Wildlife Refuge.|$|R
50|$|Despite its name, {{there are}} very few natural pine trees around Pines Lake. The area is mostly forested in black oak, white oak, and red oak along with {{flowering}} dogwoods and American beech. There are groves of mature Eastern hemlocks that may have been mistaken for pine trees. The Glen is forested with mature oaks, hemlocks, and beech, including <b>American</b> <b>sycamores</b> along the stream banks.|$|R

25|$|The Allegheny and Cumberland Plateaus of West Virginia are {{predominantly}} covered by hardwood forests, but along the Ohio River and its principal tributaries, the valuable timber {{has been removed}} and considerable areas have been wholly cleared over the centuries for farming and pasture lands. Among the most prevalent trees of this region are the chestnut oaks, the walnut, the yellow poplar, and the cherry. Southern West Virginia contains the largest reserve supply of timber. In the Ridge-and-Valley region of the Appalachian Mountains, the Eastern Panhandle and Potomac Highlands have a forest covering {{similar to that of}} the plateau region, however between these two areas of hardwood there is a long belt where spruce and white pine cover the mountain ridges. Other trees common in the state are the persimmon, sassafras, and, in the Ohio and Potomac Valley regions, the <b>American</b> <b>sycamore.</b> Hickory, chestnut, locust, maple, beech, dogwood, and pawpaw are widely distributed throughout the state as well. Among the state's common shrubs and vines are the blackberry, black and red raspberry, gooseberry, huckleberry, hazel, and wild grape. Ginseng is an important medicinal plant that is harvested primarily in West Virginia's southern regions. Wild ginger, elder, and sumach are common, and deep in the mountainous areas, rhododendrons, mountain laurel, and azaleas grow in abundance.|$|E
500|$|The Webster Sycamore (alternatively {{known as}} the Webster Springs Sycamore and the Big Sycamore Tree) was an <b>American</b> <b>sycamore</b> (Platanus occidentalis) in the U.S. state of West Virginia. Long {{recognized}} for its size, the Webster Sycamore was the largest living <b>American</b> <b>sycamore</b> tree in West Virginia until its felling in 2010.

500|$|The Webster Sycamore {{reached a}} tree height {{measurement}} of , a tree crown measurement of , and a circumference of [...] at breast height. In 1955, the American Forests Association declared the tree {{the largest of}} its species in the United States. It only held the title for three weeks, before the association identified a larger <b>American</b> <b>sycamore</b> in Maryland. Despite losing its national title, the sycamore remained the largest <b>American</b> <b>sycamore</b> in West Virginia. Following a 1963 survey of large trees in West Virginia, the Webster Sycamore was named the second-largest tree after a white oak (Quercus alba) in Randolph County.|$|E
50|$|Piss Pot Island is {{an island}} on the South Branch Potomac River west of Romney in Hampshire County, West Virginia. Piss Pot Island {{received}} its unflattering name before 1755, the year it was included on Joshua Fry's and Peter Jefferson's Carte de la Virginie et du Maryland. Uncommon for islands of its size and geologic nature, Piss Pot Island has remained approximately the same size since the eighteenth century. The island is forested primarily with <b>American</b> <b>sycamores</b> and silver maples. It continues to be popular with fishermen and canoers on the South Branch Potomac River. Mill Creek empties into the South Branch to its western shore and Wergman Run enters the river to its northeast.|$|R
5000|$|Runyon's Esenbeckia is a small, multi-trunked {{tree that}} slowly grows to around 30 ft in height and 2 ft in diameter. The dark green, glossy leaves are trifoliate, with each leaflet 1 - 3 in long. Bark is whitish [...] except for {{irregular}} copper-colored patches that exfoliate {{to reveal the}} greenish, lenticel-dotted inner bark, much like <b>American</b> <b>sycamores.</b> The star-shaped white flowers [...] are about 0.25 in in width and have four or five sepals, with {{an equal number of}} petals and stamens. The flowers form in broad, terminal panicles and are produced biannually, once in late spring and once in September. The fruit is a thick-skinned, woody capsule roughly 1 in in length that has five carpels. When mature, carpels dehisce (break apart) to eject black, up to 1/3 in long seeds. Green capsules are distinctively orange scented, while leaves smell like lemons.|$|R

5000|$|For over a {{thousand}} years {{before the arrival of}} European explorers, Sycamore Shoals and adjacent lands had been inhabited by Native Americans. [...] The first permanent European settlers arrived in 1770, and established the Watauga Association - [...] one of the first written constitutional governments west of the Appalachian Mountains - [...] in 1772. Richard Henderson and Daniel Boone negotiated the Treaty of Sycamore Shoals in 1775, which saw the sale of millions of acres of Cherokee lands in Kentucky and Tennessee and led to the building of the Wilderness Road. During the <b>American</b> Revolution, <b>Sycamore</b> Shoals was both the site of Fort Watauga, where part of a Cherokee invasion was thwarted in 1776, and the mustering ground for the Overmountain Men in 1780.|$|R
40|$|Bottomland {{hardwood}} forests normally regenerate with species {{found in}} the overstory. These species reflect the timing, duration, depth of water, {{and nature of the}} sediment in past flooding. The longer water stands during the growing season and the deeper the sediment, the fewer the species that are able to survive. Flooding patterns often change over the life of a bottomland hardwood stand. If conditions moderate, more species can regenerate the site; if flooding worsens and sediment builds up, fewer species can occupy the site. There are three sources of reproduction in bottomland forests-“advanced ” under-story seedlings (seedlings already growing), stump and root sprouts from harvested trees, and new seedlings. Advance reproduction over 18 inches tall is the most dependable source of regeneration of moderately tolerant to tolerant species and the only dependable source for oak. Sprouts from the stumps of cut trees under 12 inches d. b. h. are a major source of acceptable regeneration for most species; maples, green ash, and sweetgum are the most prolific. Sweetgum is also a good root sprouter. <b>American</b> elm, <b>sycamore,</b> green ash, sweetgum, boxelder, red an...|$|R
50|$|A {{third of}} the Robert Frost Trail is located within the bottomlands of the Connecticut River Valley, a {{relatively}} flat landscape with occasional rounded hills. The underlying strata is sedmientary rock, and the area {{has a long history}} of successful agriculture dating back to pre-colonial times. Soils are rich enough to support a commercial tobacco crop. The area is characterized by wetlands, meadering brooks with deeply cut banks, agricultural land, and patches of northern riverine forest and red maple swamp. Tree species include willow, <b>American</b> elm, and <b>sycamore.</b> The Connecticut River is 1300 ft from bank to bank at the southern terminus of the Robert Frost Trail and is navigable by power boat. Seasonal spring flooding replenishes the nutrients in the surrounding agricultural land.|$|R
500|$|Prior to {{the arrival}} of European American {{settlers}} and explorers, the Allegheny Mountain Range of the Appalachian Mountains was overlaid with old-growth forests consisting predominantly of deciduous hardwood trees, which were characterized by individual trees of enormous size and girth. The <b>American</b> <b>sycamore</b> (Platanus occidentalis) was one of the species of trees that proliferated throughout these old-growth forests. American sycamores can grow at least [...] in height and the species is distributed throughout the Eastern United States. It usually thrives in moist soils along streams, especially in sandy loam soils. American sycamores are a dominant species in bottomland and riparian forests. The species is present throughout every county in West Virginia, and is most abundant along the state's streams.|$|E
2500|$|The long-stemmed fruit {{balls of}} Liquidambar {{resemble}} those of the <b>American</b> <b>sycamore</b> or buttonwood (Platanus occidentalis), but are spiny and remain intact after their seeds are dispersed; [...] the softer fruits of Platanus disintegrate upon seed dispersal. The long-persisting fallen spiked fruits can be unpleasant to walk on; [...] sweet gum is banned in some places for this reason. [...] In abundance, they can leave a lawn lumpy. The winter buds are yellow brown, one-fourth of an inch long, acute. [...] The inner scales enlarge with the growing shoot, becoming half an inch long, green tipped with red.|$|E
2500|$|Most of West Virginia {{lies within}} the Appalachian mixed mesophytic forests ecoregion, while the higher {{elevations}} {{along the eastern}} border and in the panhandle lie within the Appalachian-Blue Ridge forests. The native vegetation {{for most of the}} state was originally mixed hardwood forest of oak, chestnut, maple, beech, and white pine, with willow and <b>American</b> <b>sycamore</b> along the state's waterways. Many of the areas are rich in biodiversity and scenic beauty, a fact that is appreciated by native West Virginians, who refer to their home as Almost Heaven (from the song, [...] "Take Me Home, Country Roads" [...] by John Denver). Before the song, it was known as [...] "The Cog State" [...] (Coal, Oil, and Gas) or [...] "The Mountain State".|$|E
50|$|The {{township}} {{was originally}} created on March 20, 1753 and included {{what is now}} North Whitehall and South Whitehall Townships. In 1810, a petition was made to the Northampton County Court to split the township into two portions (at the time, the area now encompassed by Lehigh County was part of Northampton County). The name Whitehall refers to a white hall that was built along the Jordan in the early 1700s as a hunting lodge. The area had a large ruffed grouse population along with numerous white-tail deer, eastern elk, eastern wolves, and black bear. Mountain lions or cougars may have also existed within Whitehall Township {{at some point in}} time. Because of the rich biodiversity of the area it became known as the wilderness of Whitehall. Old growth forest consisting of oak, tulip poplar, hickory, black walnut, sugar maple, basswood, American chestnut, <b>American</b> beech, and <b>sycamore</b> covered the entire township.|$|R
40|$|Leaf {{decomposition}} of three species of native Ozark vegetation {{was compared to}} that of one nonnative invasive species. Leaves were placed in an urban gravel-bed stream for 23 days. Changes in mass and condition of the leaves were assessed along with stream temperature, flow, width, depth and discharge. Species native to Eastern North <b>American</b> forests were <b>sycamore</b> (Platanus occidentalis), dogwood (Cornus florida), and redbud (Cercis canadensis). The nonnative species, Japanese (Amur) honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii) comprised approximately 80 % of the understory vegetation within the riparian zone of the study reach. After 23 days, Sycamore lost 24. 6 % mass, dogwood lost 30 %, redbud lost 37. 5 %, and honeysuckle lost 38. 3 %. Sycamore leaves retained their relative structures the most (ranked 9 on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the most sclerophyllous), and honeysuckle the least (ranked 2 on a scale of 1 to 10). As a result of this study, we suggest that the fast {{decomposition of}} leaves at southern latitudes may contribute to the low percentage of detritivores in streams, and that Japanese honeysuckle exacerbates this situation {{as a result of its}} more rapid rate of decomposition, therefore potentially depriving univoltine detritivores of nutrients later in their life cycles...|$|R
