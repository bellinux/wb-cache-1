500|$|In January 1959, Kelly {{joined the}} {{musician}} {{with whom he}} became most associated – Miles Davis. Adderley, the alto saxophonist in the band, related how Kelly came to replace Red Garland on piano: Davis had admired Kelly's playing as part of Gillespie's band, and Garland was invariably late to arrive for their club performances; [...] "One night, Wynton was there when we started and Miles asked him to sit in. When Red came, Wynton was playing. Miles told Red, 'Wynton's got the gig.' Just like that." [...] Kelly stayed with the trumpeter until March 1963, appearing on the studio albums Kind of Blue <b>and</b> <b>Someday</b> My Prince Will Come, {{as well as on}} numerous concert recordings. On 1959's Kind of Blue, often mentioned as the best-selling jazz album ever, Kelly replaced Bill Evans on the track [...] "Freddie Freeloader". Even though Kelly was Davis' regular pianist, the trumpeter had planned his album with Evans in mind, so this was the only piece that Kelly played. Kelly toured 22 cities in Europe as part of Davis' quintet in the spring of 1960. Fellow pianist McCoy Tyner commented on Kelly's playing with Davis: [...] "His harmonic colorations were very beautiful. But I think above all it was his ability to swing. John [...] used to mention that. Miles used to get off the bandstand and just look at Wynton with admiration, because he really held the group together." ...|$|E

2500|$|While Macero {{produced}} many artists' albums, he had {{an especially}} long and prolific relationship with Miles Davis. He produced most of Davis' Columbia catalog, including the classics Kind of Blue, Porgy and Bess, Sketches of Spain, <b>and</b> <b>Someday</b> My Prince Will Come. Macero's role as producer on Kind of Blue has sometimes been disputed, {{as some of the}} early Kind of Blue sessions were overseen by Irving Townsend. But numerous sources, including the original liner notes, support Macero's involvement in the sessions, and preparation of the final album, and credit him as producer. (However, despite the citations mentioned in the previous sentence, careful inspection of the front and back covers, including the liner notes and labels of the original 1959 Columbia Records LP release (CL 1355), shows no mention of Macero's name. In fact, there is no producer listed. Macero is credited as the [...] "digital remix producer" [...] in the accompanying booklet of the 1987 Columbia Jazz Masterpieces CD reissue.) ...|$|E

2500|$|After Jang's death, it was belatedly {{revealed}} {{that she had}} been secretly married. She had wed her husband, Kim Young-kyun, while in the U.S. for cancer treatment, and registered the marriage to make it official in Korea just days before her death. Kim later published a book commemorating the 608 days of their relationship, called My Last Gift To Her. The book features previously unreleased photos (including that of their Las Vegas wedding), {{as well as some of}} the letters and text messages they'd exchanged. When asked in an interview why he wrote the book, Kim answered: [...] "Right now, my memories of Jin-young are distinct, but I'm human <b>and</b> <b>someday</b> my memories will grow dimmer. I don't want to lose my memories of being with her. Writing this was my way to deal with that. Someone who writes for a living told me that it helps and is a good method for organizing their emotions, and those words motivated me to write the book. Also, as I've already said in the prologue, Jin-young was an actress who had a great future ahead of her, and I thought it would help in having her remembered beautifully. Even when her time was limited, she didn't give up hope and lived diligently, and I wanted to let people know of Jin-young's passionate life." ...|$|E
