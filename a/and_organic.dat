5|$|Although {{there has}} been {{speculation}} about earlier works, Sorabji's earliest known (albeit lost) composition is a transcription dating from 1914 of Delius's In a Summer Garden. His early works are predominantly piano sonatas, songs and piano concertos. Of these, Piano Sonatas Nos. 1–3 (1919; 1920; 1922) are compositionally the most ambitious and significant. They are characterised mainly by {{their use of the}} single-movement format and by their athematism. The main criticism levelled at them is that they lack stylistic consistency <b>and</b> <b>organic</b> form. Sorabji himself developed a largely unfavourable view of his early works, to the extent that late in his life he even considered destroying many of their manuscripts.|$|E

5|$|Chronologically, it is {{difficult}} to establish guidelines that illustrate the evolution of Gaudí's style faithfully. Although he moved on from his initially historicist approach to immerse himself completely in the modernista movement which arose so vigorously in the last third of the 19th century in Catalonia, before finally attaining his personal, organic style, this process did not consist of clearly defined stages with obvious boundaries: rather, at every stage there are reflections of all the earlier ones, as he gradually assimilated and surpassed them. Among the best descriptions of Gaudí's work was made by his disciple and biographer Joan Bergós, according to plastic and structural criteria. Bergós establishes five periods in Gaudí's productions: preliminary period, mudéjar-morisco (Moorish/mudéjar art), emulated Gothic, naturalist and expressionist, <b>and</b> <b>organic</b> synthesis.|$|E
5|$|For {{most of its}} history, {{agriculture}} {{has been}} organic, without synthetic fertilisers or pesticides, and without GMOs.

40|$|With {{the unique}} {{advantages}} of lower operational and maintenance cost, the applications of subsurface flow constructed wetlands {{for the treatment}} of wastewater have been increasing rapidly throughout the world. The removal of nitrogen <b>and</b> <b>organics</b> by such systems has gained substantial attention in recent years. In subsurface flow wetlands, the removal of pollutants often relies on a diverse range of co-existing physical, chemical and biological routes, which are vitally dependent on numerous environmental and operational parameters. This paper provides a comprehensive review of wetland structures, classic and novel nitrogen <b>and</b> <b>organics</b> removal mechanisms along with the key environmental parameters and operational conditions that enhance removal in subsurface flow wetland systems. The critical exploration identifies the major environmental parameters such as: pH, DO, and temperature, operational factors i. e. organic carbon availability, loading, feed mode, retention time, recirculation, harvesting, and the complex role (of both parameters) on classical nitrogen <b>and</b> <b>organics</b> removal pathways. Subsequently, the necessity of further extensive research on such factors, for promoting novel nitrogen removal routes in wetland systems has also been highlighted. The expansion of the review on the influence of the unconventional wetland matrix indicates that, the structural differences and inherent properties of these media can support substantial nitrogen <b>and</b> <b>organics</b> removal from wastewater, under optimal operating conditions. Overall, the critical review illustrates the necessity of a profound knowledge on the complicated inter-relationship between nitrogen <b>and</b> <b>organics</b> removal routes, governing environmental and operational parameters, and wetland matrix for improving the treatment performances of subsurface flow wetlands...|$|R

5|$|The {{glutathione}} system includes glutathione, glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidases, and glutathione S-transferases. This {{system is}} found in animals, plants and microorganisms. Glutathione peroxidase is an enzyme containing four selenium-cofactors that catalyzes the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide <b>and</b> <b>organic</b> hydroperoxides. There are at least four different glutathione peroxidase isozymes in animals. Glutathione peroxidase 1 is the most abundant and is a very efficient scavenger of hydrogen peroxide, while glutathione peroxidase 4 is most active with lipid hydroperoxides. Surprisingly, glutathione peroxidase 1 is dispensable, as mice lacking this enzyme have normal lifespans, but they are hypersensitive to induced oxidative stress. In addition, the glutathione S-transferases show high activity with lipid peroxides. These enzymes are at particularly high levels in the liver and also serve in detoxification metabolism.|$|E

40|$|Three {{methods for}} {{assessing}} the relationships between estuarine sediment contaminant levels and watershed stressors for 25 Chesapeake Bay sub-estuaries were compared. A geographic information system (GIS) was used to delineate watersheds for each sub-estuary and analyze land use pattern (area and location of developed, herbaceous and forested land) and point source pollution (annual outflow and contaminant loading) using three landscape analysis methods: (1) a watershed approach using the watershed of the estuary containing the sampling station, (2) a 'partial watershed' approach using {{the area of the}} watershed within a 10 radius of the sampling station and (3) a 'weighted partial watershed' approach where stressors within the par- tial watershed were weighted by the inverse of their linear distance from the sampling station. Nine sediment metals, 16 sediment <b>organics</b> <b>and</b> seven metals loading variables were each reduced to one principal component for statistical analyses. Relationships between the first principal components for sediment metals <b>and</b> <b>organics</b> concentrations <b>and</b> watershed stressor variables were analyzed using rank correlation and multiple regression techniques. For both metals <b>and</b> <b>organics,</b> the watershed method yielded values considerably lower than the partial and weighted partial watershed analysis methods. Regression models using stressor data generated by the weighted partial watershed landscape analysis method explained 76 % and 47 % of the variation in the first principal component for sediment metals <b>and</b> <b>organics</b> concentrations, respectively. Results suggest that the area of developed land located in the watershed within 10 km of the sediment sampling station is a major contributing factor in the sediment concentrations of both metals <b>and</b> <b>organics.</b> [...] ...|$|R
