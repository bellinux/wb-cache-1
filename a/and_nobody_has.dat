5|$|The {{supposed}} refusals {{from these}} first three artists to participate {{was seen as}} evidence of self-censorship {{out of fear of}} violence from Islamists, which led to much debate in Denmark. The Danish news paper Politiken stated at February 12, 2006, that they asked Bluitgen to put them in touch with the artists, so the claim that none of them dared to work with him could be proved. The author refused, <b>and</b> <b>nobody</b> <b>has</b> ever been able to confirm whether the incident is properly described.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{arriving}} in Los Angeles, the 14 men that Jacobsen saw were detained for questioning and identity verification. The Federal Air Marshal Service {{concluded that they}} were Syrian band members {{en route to a}} San Diego casino to perform. Jacobsen claims, however, that only two of the men were briefly investigated <b>and</b> <b>nobody</b> <b>has</b> determined where the men went after leaving the airport. The Sycuan Casino & Resort confirmed that Syrian singer Nour Mhanna performed there two days later, and that he brought his own backup band.|$|E
60|$|My entry created no sensation. <b>Nobody,</b> apparently, <b>had</b> {{heard the}} latch click, <b>and</b> <b>nobody</b> <b>had</b> {{caught sight of}} me. Their {{eyes were fixed on}} the young man and Beale. I stood at the gate, and watched them.|$|R
60|$|Settling {{himself before}} the roaring fire, Barringford told his story in detail. He {{repeated}} {{all that the}} inhabitants at Bedford had told him, but this threw no light on the mystery. <b>Nobody</b> <b>had</b> seen the stranger come into the place <b>and</b> <b>nobody</b> <b>had</b> seen him depart.|$|R

500|$|Grant was {{nominated}} for two Academy Awards, for Penny Serenade (1941) and None But the Lonely Heart (1944), but never won a competitive Oscar; he received a special Academy Award for Lifetime Achievement in 1970. The inscription on his statuette read [...] "To Cary Grant, for his unique mastery {{of the art of}} screen acting with respect and affection of his colleagues". On being presented with the award, his friend Frank Sinatra announced: [...] "It was made for the sheer brilliance of acting... No one has brought more pleasure to more people for so many years than Cary has, <b>and</b> <b>nobody</b> <b>has</b> done so many things so well".|$|E
500|$|In {{a secret}} ending {{exclusive}} to Re:coded, Mickey and Yen Sid discuss {{the location of}} Terra, Aqua, and Ventus. During their conversation, however, Yen Sid reveals that the destruction of Xehanort's Heartless <b>and</b> <b>Nobody</b> <b>has</b> brought about the eventual return of Master Xehanort. To prepare for this new threat, Yen Sid orders Mickey to bring Sora and Riku to him, intending to examine them for the Mark of Mastery. In a second secret ending exclusive to Kingdom Hearts HD 2.5 Remix, a resurrected Braig meets with the time-traveling Young Xehanort. With the plot to gather the thirteen incarnations of Xehanort already underway, Braig and Young Xehanort discuss the latter's eventual inheritance of a Keyblade from his elder self. Braig surmises the entire plan relates to the Keyblade War, and debates which of the reconstructed members of Organization XIII will be the [...] "poor soul" [...] he chooses for his own unknown agenda.|$|E
2500|$|In December 1933, Bush {{was hired}} as {{the manager of the}} Minneapolis Millers, the team he had coached in 1932. [...] He {{remained}} with the Millers from 1934 to 1938 and won pennants in 1934 and 1935. [...] Ted Williams played for the Millers in 1938, saw his batting average jump 75 points over the prior year, and later credited Bush with some of his success. After learning that Bush had died, Williams said: [...] "I've been in the game for 36 years <b>and</b> <b>nobody</b> <b>has</b> any closer affection to my heart than Ownie." [...] He noted that Bush was as [...] "fiery as a man could be...a man who tried to be tough but was as soft as a grape." ...|$|E
6000|$|This speech may be {{interpreted}} as follows. A few nights since a great lady, Lady Flamingo, had cut Miss Amory and Lady Clavering. She was quite mad because she could not get an invitation to Lady Drum's ball: {{it was the end}} of the season <b>and</b> <b>nobody</b> <b>had</b> proposed to her: she had made no sensation at all, she who was so much cleverer than any girl of the year, and of the young ladies forming her special circle. Dora who had but five thousand pounds, Flora who had nothing, and Leonora who had red hair, were going to be married, <b>and</b> <b>nobody</b> <b>had</b> come for Blanche Amory! ...|$|R

60|$|And Tom was right. She was {{precisely}} {{that sort of}} person. <b>Nobody</b> ought to <b>have</b> been able to resist her coaxing manner; <b>and</b> <b>nobody</b> <b>had</b> any business to try. Yet she never seemed {{to know it was}} her manner at all. That was the best of it.|$|R

Packer, who says, [...] "It {{is safe to}} {{say that}} no {{comparable}} exposition of the work of redemption as planned and executed by the Triune Jehovah has ever been done since Owen published his. None has been needed....obody has a right to dismiss the doctrine of the limitedness, or particularity, of atonement as a monstrosity of Calvinistic logic until he has refuted Owen's proof that it is part of the uniform biblical presentation of redemption, clearly taught in plain text after plain text. <b>And</b> <b>nobody</b> <b>has</b> done that yet." [...] It should be noted of course that those who oppose the doctrine would disagree that Owen has [...] "proved" [...] anything from [...] "plain text after plain text," [...] maintaining that instead he has misinterpreted his texts; they would also disagree with the assertion that [...] "no one has done that [...] yet." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ryan Leslie started {{spotting}} Cassie at {{clubs and}} parties in late 2004. They were introduced by Diddy's makeup artist, {{who had worked}} with her on a modeling photoshoot, and in February 2005, the two wrote a duet called [...] "Kiss Me," [...] as a result of Cassie being asked by her mother to record a song as a birthday gift. After recording the track, Leslie played it for music executive Tommy Mottola. Mottola offered Cassie a management deal, and Leslie signed her to NextSelection Lifestyle Group, his music-media company founded with online marketing partner Rasheed Richmond. Leslie wrote and produced Cassie's first single, [...] "Me & U," [...] in 2005. That same year, they set up a MySpace page, where they uploaded the song which soon went viral and became a club hit in Germany, creating a label bidding frenzy. In the meantime, Diddy heard [...] "Me & U" [...] in a club, and Leslie convinced him to partner his Bad Boy Records with Leslie's NextSelection imprint for the release of Cassie's debut album. [...] "I think {{that was one of the}} only songs that we didn't do organically—I'll literally come in and we wrote from scratch [...] I love how the tone feels of the song. It's not too much. It's really simple <b>and</b> <b>nobody</b> <b>has</b> anything like this," [...] she said of her debut single.|$|E

60|$|The {{light was}} {{not strong enough}} to see clearly, <b>and</b> <b>nobody</b> <b>had</b> the courage to make more of an illumination. Sobber stood {{in the center of the}} room and as he did this the snake {{suddenly}} seemed to fly through the air right at him.|$|R
60|$|The {{fighting}} had greatly agitated {{the women}} in the fort, <b>and</b> <b>nobody</b> <b>had</b> slept for two nights. Yet even now, with the fire out and silence brooding everywhere, nobody thought of going to bed. All felt that this was but the lull before the greater storm.|$|R
60|$|Harold {{found out}} the hours for the trains, and did {{everything}} to expedite me. He made it certain that poor little Dora had not been vaccinated. When she was born, no doctor lived within sixty miles of Boola Boola, <b>and</b> <b>nobody</b> <b>had</b> ever thought of such a thing.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Don't go;' and a bird-like {{little hand}} seized her on either side. 'Mary {{never came to}} bed, <b>and</b> <b>nobody</b> <b>has</b> been here all the morning, and we can't bear to be alone.' ...|$|E

60|$|He said it, The Pride of the Thames, {{had been}} in use, just as it now stood (or rather as it now hung together), for the last forty years, to his knowledge, <b>and</b> <b>nobody</b> <b>had</b> complained of it before, {{and he did not}} see why we should be the first to begin.|$|R

50|$|Some UFO proponents {{accepted}} IDH {{because the}} distance between stars makes interstellar travel impractical using conventional means <b>and</b> <b>nobody</b> <b>had</b> demonstrated an antigravity or faster-than-light travel hypothesis that could explain extraterrestrial machines. With IDH, it is unnecessary to explain any propulsion method because the IDH holds that UFOs are not spacecraft, but rather devices that travel between different realities.|$|R

6000|$|The {{father came}} home from work at about four o'clock. He dragged silently into the house and sat down. Minnie bustled to give him his dinner. Tired, he laid his black arms on the table.

60|$|I said I {{went there}} to consult--allowing {{for the sake of}} {{argument}} that he was in any wise concerned in the matter.

6000|$|... 'I say! I beg everybody's pardon for intruding again,' said Crowl, {{looking in}} at this happy juncture; 'but what a queer {{business}} this is, isn't it?

6000|$|I {{have never}} {{disguised}} it from myself, <b>and</b> <b>nobody</b> <b>has</b> ever disguised it from me, that I {{am not a}} handsome dog. Even mother never thought me beautiful.

6000|$|There was a {{sound of}} children's voices calling and talking: high, childish, girlish voices, {{slightly}} didactic and tinged with domineering: 'If you don't come quick, nurse, I shall run out there to where there are snakes.' <b>And</b> <b>nobody</b> <b>had</b> the sangfroid to reply: 'Run then, little fool.'
