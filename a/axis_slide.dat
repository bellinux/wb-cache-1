40|$|Since 1977, {{more than}} 2300 {{publications}} on discotic (disk-like) liquid crystalline materials have appeared. Discotic liquid crystals, which usually consist of polyaromatic molecules surrounded by long peripheral alkyl tails, can form liquid crystalline mesophases {{in a wide}} temperature range. Within these mesophases, the molecules self-assemble in large columnar stacks via p -stacking interactions between the aromatic cores. These assemblies can provide an efficient charge transport pathway, as indicated by their informal designation as " molecular-wires ". As a result, they nowadays attract significant interest for optoelectronic applications. Several possible applications where discotic liquid crystals could be used are field effect transistors (FETs), light emitting diodes (LEDs) and photovoltaic solar cells. In all the discotic materials described so far, the molecules inside the columns, can still rotate around the columnar <b>axis,</b> <b>slide</b> out of the columns or oscillate within the columnar stack. This represents a limitation of their applicability as " molecular-wires ". Therefore, in this research, an additional stabilization of columnar discotic mesophases was envisaged {{in order to increase}} their organization, without the frequently concomitant loss of processability that would result from extensions of the aromatic core. The research described in this thesis focuses on the stabilization of columnar mesophases by highly tunable (i. e. controlled) H-bonding interactions, without enlarging the aromatic cores and thus maintaining their processability. Functional H-bonding groups, such as urea, amide, thiourea or 1, 3, 5 -benzenetrisamide, have been used in this work, {{in order to create a}} H-bonding network parallel to the columnar axis, alongside the existing π-π stacking interactions between the disk-like molecules. In Chapter 1 an overview of the different types of liquid crystalline phases is presented, with emphasis on the organization of columnar discotic mesophases. Since this work focuses on the hydrogen bond stabilization of the triphenylene-based discotic liquid crystals, the most important synthetic approaches towards these materials are discussed. Several of these methods were applied to prepare the materials investigated in Chapters 2 to 5. Besides the synthetic aspect, several characterization techniques, which are normally used to investigate the properties of the liquid crystal materials, are shortly discussed. Chapter 2 deals with the synthesis and thermotropic properties of a series of hexaalkoxytriphenylenes that contain one amide, urea or thiourea group in one of their alkoxy tails, as H-bond forming group. The biphenyl route turns out to be the best with respect to yields and versatility, as compared to other methods. The optical polarization microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray studies show that the intermolecular hydrogen bonding has a negative influence on the formation and stability of the columnar liquid crystalline phases: The stronger the hydrogen bonding, the more the liquid crystallinity is suppressed. This is probably due to disturbance of the p - p stacking of the triphenylene disks and a lower flexibility of the alkyl tails. So far, the urea and amide containing triphenylene derivatives do not exhibit liquid crystalline properties, probably because an H-bond stabilization of the crystalline state is obtained. However, several thiourea derivatives show columnar hexagonal (Col h) mesophases, because in these compounds the p - p interactions are more important than the relatively weak thiourea hydrogen bonding. Because in the columnar mesophases the motions of the aromatic core and the alkyl tails are strongly correlated, the length of the alkyl chains, which surround the disk-like aromatic cores, is an important factor that determines the stability of the columns. Since in the previous chapter long substituents carrying an urea, amide or thiourea group have been used, a complementary study, with focus on t he synthesis and phase behavior of unsymmetrically substituted hexaalkoxytriphenylenes, is described in Chapter 3. In this study, one of the hexyloxy chains in hexahexyloxytriphenylene (HAT 6) is replaced by either a shorter or longer chain. In the series HAT-(OC 6 H 13) 5 -(OC n H 2 n + 1), with n ranging from 2 to 18, the compounds with n ³ 13 are not liquid crystalline anymore. For all compounds with n £ 12, Col h phases are found. Furthermore, X-ray investigations show that the intercolumnar distance gradually increases from 20. 19 Å to 22. 03 Å, with increasing n, while a small odd-even effect on the increase of the intercolumn distance with n is observed. This odd-even effect is also found in the change of ΔH of isotropization with n. The interdisk distance remains constant (3. 6 Å). Since the stabilization of the columnar mesophase by H-bonding interactions still remains an unsolved issue, Chapter 4 describes a 1, 3, 5 -benzenetrisamide with three pendant hexaalkoxytriphenylene groups, as a new approach for the intermolecular H-bond-stabilization of columnar discotic liquid crystalline materials. This compound forms a columnar hexagonal plastic (Col hp) discotic phase with a clearing point at 208 ° C. Surprisingly, the material does not crystallize on cooling from the isotropic phase, even after annealing for a few days at room temperature, but goes into a glassy state due to the enforced H-bonding network formed between the benzenetrisamide units. Modeling studies show that the central 1, 3, 5 -benzenetrisamide cores are rotated 60 ° with respect to each other, which makes the adjacent triphenylene moieties to stack with a small 15 ° rotation. This small rotation observed between the adjacent triphenylene units plays a key role, since for such a rotation ~ 85 % of the maximum charge transfer integral is achieved. This result is correlated to the very high charge carrier mobility of 0. 12 cm 2 V - 1 s - 1 at 180 ° C, found for this particular compound. This value is the second highest ever reported for liquid crystalline triphenylene systems. This is a first proof for the intermolecular H-bonding stabilization of the columnar organization of triphenylene moieties, without loosing the ease of processing provided by the liquid crystalline phase. Since the modeling discussed in the previous chapter suggests that the conformation of the butyl spacer, which is used for that particular compound, dictates the p - p overlap of the triphenylene units within the liquid crystal phase, a new series of 1, 3, 5 -benzenetrisamid e derivatives with three hexa alkoxytriphenylene pendant groups is prepared and their properties discussed in Chapter 5. In this case, the length of the spacer, as well as the size of the ortho -substituent at the triphenylene core is varied. Taking into account these modifications, all these materials show liquid crystalline behavior with high isotropization points (170 - 200 ° C). Different columnar hexagonal phases have been identified going from a columnar hexagonal plastic (Col hp) phase, when using a butyl spacer, with a shorter butyl ortho -substituent of the triphenylene core, to a columnar hexagonal disordered (Col hd) phase, when a pentyl spacer is used and a hexyl ortho -substituent is present on the triphenylene groups. A chiral 1, 3, 5 -benzenetrisamide was shown to form columnar stacks with a single helical organization, both in an apolar solvent and in a film, as found by circular dichroism studies. By using pulse-radiolysis time-resolved microwave conductivity, charge carrier mobilities as high as 0. 25 cm 2 V - 1 s - 1 are found for the liquid crystalline phase (Col h) of this chiral derivative. This mobility is twice the highest value ever reported for triphenylene-based liquid crystalline materials, approaching mobilities found for hexabenzocoronene-based liquid crystals, with a much larger aromatic core. This is a substantial improvement regarding the stabilization of disk-like molecules within their liquid crystal phase, without expanding the aromatic cores, but by tuning the H-bonding and the length of the spacer...|$|E

5000|$|An in-line crank slider is {{oriented}} {{in a way}} {{in which}} the pivot point of the crank is coincident with the axis of the linear movement. The follower arm, which is the link that connects the crank arm to the slider, connects to a pin in the center of sliding object. This pin is considered to be on the linear movement axis. Therefore, to be considered an in-line crank slider, the pivot point of the crank arm must be in-line with this pin point. The stroke (...) of an in-line crank slider is defined as the maximum linear distance the slider may travel between the two extreme points of its motion. With an in-line crank slider, the motion of the crank and follower links is symmetric about the <b>sliding</b> <b>axis.</b> This means that the crank angle required to execute a forward stroke is equivalent to the angle required to perform a reverse stroke. For this reason, the in-line slider-crank mechanism produces balanced motion. This balanced motion implies other ideas as well.

On a layer of heavy meromyosin on a nitrocellulose-coated coverglass, this bead-actin filament complex slid smoothly, trailing the bead at its end. Therefore we called this preparation "bead-tailed" actin filaments. The sliding velocity was indistinguishable from that of nonbeaded filaments. With use of this system, we tried to detect the axial rotation (rotation around the filament <b>axis)</b> in a <b>sliding</b> actin filament. Although a single bead at the tail end did not serve as the marker for the axial rotation, we occasionally found another bead bound to the tail bead.

We observed that actin filaments slid over distances of many tens of micrometers without showing a complete turn of the bead-aggregates.

During the various studies several numerical models have been proposed to explain the collapse dynamics but a comprehensive and reliable insight into the failure kinematics is still missing. A major step forward in the understanding of the landslide mechanisms is represented by the reconstruction of the geometry of the different geological units within the landslide body and of the associated physical properties. A large scale geophysical experiment based on 2 D and 3 D seismic and resistivity was undertaken to address the issue.

Methods: A series of 60 ThinPrep cases representing the full spectrum of adequate, 'satisfactory but limited by' (SBLB) and unsatisfactory reports were included. Two cell-counting protocols with three different magnifications, using x 10, x 20 and x 40 objectives, were evaluated and related to the true cellularity, together with a reassessment of the degree of adequacy originally reported. The cell-counting protocol that showed the highest correlation coefficient was considered the most accurate. Results: Based on seven (re) assessments a majority score for adequacy was established. There were 42 cases with a majority score 'unsatisfactory' or 'SBLB' (low cellularity) of which 41 contained fewer than 20 000 squamous cells; and 18 cases with a majority score 'satisfactory' of which one had fewer than 20 000 cells.

40|$|Soft-sediment {{deformation}} structures crop {{out in the}} Lower Cretaceous {{succession of}} the Gubbio anticline in the Umbria-Marche Apennines of Italy. The deformation interval is 13 m thick and occurs between the upper Hauterivian–lower Aptian Maiolica Formation and the Aptian Marne a Fucoidi Formation. It can be observed along the anticline for a distance of 12 km. Different types of deformation structures are distributed in several outcrops, with detachment extensional structures prevailing in the southeast sector. Imbricated slides, slump structures, and chaotic layers are distributed vertically and longitudinally in the middle and/or {{lower part of the}} deformed sediments. In the northwest sector of the anticline, compressional duplex structures can be considered the lower section of a large sediment failure. Geometrical and kinematic analysis of the fold <b>axis</b> trends and <b>sliding</b> surfaces have led to infer a single, large gravitational event possibly Albian in age. The synsedimentary deformation could be activated by several internal trigger mechanisms induced by external regional tectonic events such as earthquakes. An orthogonal system of calcite veins crossing the limestone layers represents the primary pathway for fl uid-driven breaching of joint seals. These fl uids can be related to the significant increase in the total organic carbon in the Hauterivian–Aptian layer of the Maiolica and Marne a Fucoidi Formations. This suggests the possibility that the limestone layer, sandwiched and sealed between clay of the organic-rich black shales, could have favored a pore pressure increase approaching lithostatic stress. With a thin overburden, lithostatic stress is more easily reached at low hydrostatic pressure. This slump sheet occurrence suggests the existence of a local paleoslope dipping toward the north-northwest, where the mass involved in the deformation is distributed over an estimated area of 60 km 2 for a volume of 0. 8 km 3 of displaced sediments. The restoration and rotation of the slump fold hinges to the Early Cretaceous direction, in line with available paleomagnetic data, have shown that the strike of the slope corresponds to the main trend of the oldest Jurassic extensional lineaments and is linked to transform faults of the westernmost Tethys rifting systems...|$|R

However, for small F, S and M, the 3 D waves are considerably smaller, both in the near- and far-field. Empirical equations are presented to transform wave parameters from 2 D to 3 D. One 2 D- 3 D test pair, involving a solitary-like wave, is investigated in detail regarding the slide kinematics, water surface elevations and slide-water interaction power. This power is derived from pressure measurements on the slide front and the slide kinematics. The identical test pair is then used to calibrate the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics SPH code DualSPHysics and to numerically investigate the wave features in five intermediate geometries between 2 D and 3 D. For a “channel” geometry with diverging side wall angle of 7. 5 °, the wave amplitudes along the <b>slide</b> <b>axis</b> were found to lie approximately halfway between the values observed in 2 D and 3 D. At 45 °, the values are practically identical to those in 3 D. These findings support preliminary landslide-tsunami hazard assessment...|$|R
