5|$|White {{missed the}} opening of NBA camp on Monday October 1, due to a desire to have a {{contractual}} plan put in place with the Rockets and the NBA that addressed the league wide mental health policy or lack thereof. After sessions with his own long-time doctor, White requested permission to travel by bus when {{necessary in order to}} limit his flight schedule. The Rockets and White came to an agreement regarding travel, including allowing White travel by personal bus rather than flying (which has been <b>an</b> <b>anxiety</b> trigger in the past for white). White missed the first week of training camp before this agreement was put in place.|$|E
5|$|Adi Da's {{father told}} Rudi of his son's onetime {{aspiration}} {{to become a}} Lutheran minister. Feeling that he needed better grounding, in 1965 Rudi insisted that he marry Nina, find steady employment, lose weight, end his drug use, and begin preparatory studies to enter the seminary. As a student at Philadelphia's Lutheran Theological Seminary in 1967, Adi Da described undergoing a terrifying breakdown. Taken to a hospital emergency room, a psychiatrist diagnosed it as <b>an</b> <b>anxiety</b> attack. It {{was the first in}} a series of such episodes he would experience throughout his life, each followed by what he explained to be profound awakenings or insights. Feeling none of his Lutheran professors understood this experience, Adi Da left and briefly attended St. Vladimir's Russian Orthodox Seminary in Tuckahoe, New York. Disillusioned, he moved back to New York City and got a job working for Pan American Airlines, in hopes this would facilitate his being able to visit Swami Muktananda's ashram in India. He did so for four days in April 1968. Swami Muktananda encouraged Adi Da to end his studies with Rudi and study with himself directly.|$|E
5|$|Opeth was {{scheduled}} to perform in Jordan without a crew due to the fear of terrorist attacks in the Middle East. Opeth's tour manager distributed 6,000 tickets for the concert, but before the band left for Jordan, drummer Lopez called Åkerfeldt stating he was having <b>an</b> <b>anxiety</b> attack and could not perform, forcing the band to cancel the show. In early 2004, Lopez was sent home from Canada after more anxiety attacks on tour. Opeth decided against cancelling {{the remainder of the}} tour, with Lopez's drum technician filling in for two concerts. Lopez promised that he would return to the tour as soon as he could, but two shows later Opeth asked Strapping Young Lad drummer Gene Hoglan to fill in. Lopez returned to Opeth for the Seattle show on the final leg of the Deliverance and Damnation tour. Per Wiberg also joined the band on tour to perform keyboards, {{after more than a year}} on tour.|$|E

5|$|Palomeque {{was found}} dead on August 22, 2009. His {{body was found in}} a river near the town of El Rosario, Sinaloa. According to a bus driver who was {{transporting}} Palomeque and other passengers to Mexico City on Friday night August 20, Palomeque became agitated, panicked and demanded to be let off the bus despite it being 1:30 in the morning. A text message he sent to his wife after leaving the bus confirms that Palomeque found himself lost on the dark hillside. After receiving the text message, his wife contacted local wrestling promoter Vicente Martinez, who organized a search party. On the morning of August 22, Palomeque was found floating face down in the river. Afterwards, medical expert Jesús Enrique Castro López stated that such <b>an</b> <b>anxiety</b> attack could be steroid related, but Palomeque's alleged steroid abuse has not been confirmed. An autopsy was carried out on August 23, which determined that {{the cause of death was}} drowning, and no further investigation into the death is planned. A memorial was held in Mexico City on August 24 for friends and family of Palomeque, many of whom showed up without their masks on, to keep the focus of the event on Palomeque. His body was subsequently cremated, with the ashes taken to Villahermosa to be buried.|$|E

25|$|About 12% {{of people}} are {{affected}} by <b>an</b> <b>anxiety</b> disorder {{in a given year}} and between 5-30% are affected {{at some point in their}} life.

They affect those between the ages of 15 and 35 the most and become less common after the age of 55. Rates appear to be higher in the United States and Europe.|$|E
25|$|There did {{not appear}} {{on the part of}} Napoleon any eagerness to resume the {{movement}} of the Imperial Guard towards the lower extremity of Ligny, but rather <b>an</b> <b>anxiety</b> to await calmly the most favourable moment for his projected attack. Doubtless he had discovered the march of the remaining battalions of Colonel Langbn's Brigade, from Sombreffe towards Saint-Amand, as a further reinforcement to the Prussian right, and calculated upon paralysing the attack which Blücher was evidently preparing against the French left flank, by executing a sudden and vigorous assault on the Prussian centre, with a preponderating mass of fresh troops.|$|E

40|$|The {{current study}} focused {{on the effects of}} anxiety on balance index in young female {{university}} students. A group of 15 female students with <b>a</b> high <b>anxiety</b> score (higher than 42 in Spielberger’s score) and a group of 15 female students with <b>a</b> low <b>anxiety</b> score (lower than 42 in Spielberger’s score) were recruited in this study. The Anteroposterior (AP), Mediolateral (ML) and the overall dynamic Stability Index (SI) of the subjects were recorded by use of a Biodex stabilometer (Biodex Stabilometer System, USA) and were compared with each other. The results revealed {{a significant difference between the}} two groups. The subjects with <b>a</b> high <b>anxiety</b> score showed <b>a</b> stability index higher than those in low anxiety group (p< 0. 005) which simply means significantly less stability in this group. In conclusion, this study showed a less stability index existed in subjects with higher anxiety scores.

25|$|Normally, the pyloric valve at {{the lower}} end of the stomach regulates the release of food into the bowel. When the gastric bypass patient eats a sugary food, the sugar passes rapidly into the intestine, where it gives rise to a {{physiological}} reaction called dumping syndrome. The body will flood the intestines with gastric content in an attempt to dilute the sugars. An affected person may feel their heart beating rapidly and forcefully, break into a cold sweat, get a feeling of butterflies in the stomach, and may have <b>an</b> <b>anxiety</b> attack. The person usually has to lie down, and could be very uncomfortable for 3045 minutes. Diarrhea may then follow.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{existence}} of ORS is generally accepted, there is some controversy {{as to whether it}} is a distinct condition or merely a part or manifestation of other psychiatric conditions, mainly due to the overlapping similarities. Similarly, there is controversy with regards how the disorder should be classified. As ORS has obsessive and compulsive features, some consider it as a type of obsessive compulsive spectrum disorder, while others consider it <b>an</b> <b>anxiety</b> disorder due to the strong anxiety component. It is also suggested to be a type of body dysmorphic disorder or, as it involves a single delusional belief, some suggest that ORS is a monosymptomatic hypochondriacal psychosis (hypochondriacal type of delusional disorder, see monothematic delusion).|$|E
25|$|Genetics {{and family}} history (e.g., parental anxiety) may {{predispose}} an individual for {{an increased risk}} of <b>an</b> <b>anxiety</b> disorder, but generally external stimuli will trigger its onset or exacerbation. Genetic differences account for about 43% of variance in panic disorder and 28% in generalized anxiety disorder. Although single genes are neither necessary nor sufficient for anxiety by themselves, several gene polymorphisms have been found to correlate with anxiety: PLXNA2, SERT, CRH, COMT and BDNF. Several of these genes influence neurotransmitters (such as serotonin and norepinephrine) and hormones (such as cortisol) which are implicated in anxiety. The epigenetic signature of {{at least one of these}} genes BDNF has also been associated with anxiety and specific patterns of neural activity.|$|E

25|$|A {{possible}} explanation for the mental symptoms of subclinical thyroid disease, might be found {{in the fact that the}} brain has among the highest expression of THR's, and that neurons are often more sensitive than other tissues to thyroid abnormalities, including sublicnical hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis. In a 1996 survey study respondents reported a significant decline in memory, attention, planning, and overall productivity from the period 2 years prior to Graves' symptoms onset to the period when hyperthyroid. Also, hypersensitivity of the central nervous system to low-grade hyperthyroidism can result in <b>an</b> <b>anxiety</b> disorder before other Graves' disease symptoms emerge. E.g., panic disorder has been reported to precede Graves' hyperthyroidism by 4 to 5 years in some cases, although it is not known how frequently this occurs.|$|E
25|$|It {{is rather}} universally {{accepted}} that {{a body of}} Shakespeare's sonnets, including 65, are addressed {{to a young man}} whose beauty the poems make known. The young man is like Caesar, then, in that Shakespeare recognizes the presence of feminine qualities in a man. But the common theme is more than recognition, it is an acknowledgment of tension created by that recognition. Especially by Cassius, Caesar is made out to be rather feminine, as is the young man in descriptions of his beauty. In that the speaker does not directly refer to the addressee of the sonnets as a man, and in that Brutus and the others find discomfort in Caesar's ruling ability because of his appeared weaknesses, shows that Shakespeare recognizes <b>an</b> <b>anxiety</b> about men with feminine qualities, or women with masculine qualities, like Queen Elizabeth, of whom Caesar {{may or may not be}} representative.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} shown that there is a two to {{threefold}} greater risk of having social phobia if a first-degree relative also has the disorder. This could be due to genetics and/or due to children acquiring social fears and avoidance through processes of observational learning or parental psychosocial education. Studies of identical twins brought up (via adoption) in different families have indicated that, if one twin developed social anxiety disorder, then the other was between 30 percent and 50 percent more likely than average to also develop the disorder. To some extent this 'heritability' may not be specific – for example, studies have found that if a parent has any kind of anxiety disorder or clinical depression, then a child is somewhat more likely to develop <b>an</b> <b>anxiety</b> disorder or social phobia. Studies suggest that parents of those with social anxiety disorder tend to be more socially isolated themselves (Bruch and Heimberg, 1994; Caster et al., 1999), and shyness in adoptive parents is significantly correlated with shyness in adopted children (Daniels and Plomin, 1985).|$|E
