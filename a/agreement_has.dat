5|$|Brussels' hosting of {{institutions}} {{has made it}} a major centre for the EU. Together with NATO it has attracted more journalists and ambassadors than Washington D.C. However the three-city <b>agreement</b> <b>has</b> been criticised, notably concerning the Parliament due to {{the large number of}} people that move between the cities. The European Green Party estimated that the arrangement costs 200million euro and 20,268 tonnes of carbon dioxide. Brussels is preferred by some due to the presence of other institutions and other groups whereas Strasbourg is supported due to its historical importance to European unity.|$|E

5|$|The matter {{ended in}} court, {{with a case}} to {{determine}} whether Autolink {{should be allowed to}} take control of four train radios that were located in locomotives owned by Autolink, but operated by Ofotbanen. In a shareholder agreement between Autolink and Rail Management, the ownership of the train radios had been transferred to Autolink, but the <b>agreement</b> <b>has</b> clauses that specified that Autolink could not start a competing railway company. Stating that Autolink had been disloyal in regard to the contract, Ofoten District Court ruled on 17 July 2008 against Autolink's demand for an interim order to transfer the ownership of the radios to Autolink. The court ruled that an interim decision could not be made due to the complexity of the contracts, and that a normal lawsuit would have to be carried out to determine the matter. There was agreement that Autolink, on 13February 2008, had bought five shunters from Ofotbanen for NOK12 million, of which NOK9.5 million was paid by Autolink deleting debt.|$|E
