25|$|Although {{birth was}} {{considered}} to be ritually polluting, <b>a</b> <b>death</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> family was thought to be much more so. In the case of the death of the oldest member of the family, whether male or female, the body would be cremated on a pyre; for all other family members burial was the norm. In either case, the ceremonies were conducted by the Maran subgroup of the community and they utilised both elements of superstition and of Hinduism.

She attended the 2016 Marrakech International Film Festival, {{as a member}} of the jury presided by Hungarian director Béla Tarr. The 18th Mumbai Film Festival saw the release of two of Koechlin's films—the widely praised <b>A</b> <b>Death</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Gunj and the panned Mantra. In the former, she played Mimi, a Kolkata-based Anglo-Indian woman, who seduces a younger disturbed teenager. To prepare for the role, she attended an acting workshop conducted by the film's casting director, Atul Mongia, and also learnt an Anglo-Indian accent. She thought of it unlike anything that she had done before, calling it [...] "a very sexual, beautiful character". [...] <b>A</b> <b>Death</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Gunj, after having been delayed on multiple occasions, was released theatrically on June 2, 2017.

500|$|Diderot's Encyclopédie cites {{butterflies}} as {{a symbol}} for the soul. A Roman sculpture depicts a butterfly exiting {{the mouth of a}} dead man, representing the Roman belief that the soul leaves through the mouth. In line with this, the ancient Greek word for [...] "butterfly" [...] is ψυχή (psȳchē), which primarily means [...] "soul" [...] or [...] "mind". According to Mircea Eliade, some of the Nagas of Manipur claim ancestry from a butterfly. In some cultures, butterflies symbolise rebirth. The butterfly is a symbol of being transgender, because of the transformation from caterpillar to winged adult. In the English county of Devon, people once hurried to kill the first butterfly of the year, to avoid a year of bad luck. In the Philippines, a lingering black butterfly or moth in the house is taken to mean <b>a</b> <b>death</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> family. Several American states have chosen an official state butterfly.|$|E

500|$|The battle {{gave rise}} to a {{tradition}} at nearby Chartley Park, a holding of Robert de Ferrers, 2nd Baron Ferrers of Chartley. [...] The baron maintained a herd of white cattle with black ears, descended from wild specimens found when the park was formed from part of the ancient Needwood Forest. In 1322 an unusual black calf was born in the herd that was said to have foretold the Battle of Burton Bridge and the subsequent downfall of the de Ferrers house (who were supporters of Lancaster). [...] Subsequently it was said that the birth of a dark-hued or part-coloured calf in the herd would foretell <b>a</b> <b>death</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> de Ferrers family within the year. [...] Such omens were said to have preceded the deaths of, amongst others, Robert Shirley, 7th Earl Ferrers; his wife; their son Robert Sewallis Shirley and his wife and the son, daughter and wife of Washington Shirley, the 8th Earl. [...] Another local tradition places the legendary figure of Robin Hood at the battle fighting for Lancaster.|$|E
500|$|This {{story was}} the basis for the most often-cited origin tale, Moore's {{one-shot}} The Killing Joke. The Joker quits his job as a Lab assistant, becoming a stand-up comedian to support his pregnant wife. Unsuccessful, he agrees to help mobsters with a robbery and dons the Red Hood. The heist goes awry; the comedian leaps into a chemical vat to escape Batman, surfacing disfigured. This, combined with the earlier accidental death of his wife and unborn child, drives the comedian insane and he becomes the Joker. This version has been cited in many stories, including [...] (in which Batman deduces that the Red Hood survived his fall and became the Joker), Batman #450 (in which the Joker dons the Red Hood to aid his recovery after the events in <b>A</b> <b>Death</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Family, but finds the experience too traumatic) and [...] "Death of the Family".

500|$|Ornstein {{was born}} in Kremenchug, a large town in the Ukrainian {{province}} of Poltava, then under Imperial Russian rule. He {{grew up in a}} musical environment—his father Avrom Gornshtein was a Jewish cantor, while a violinist uncle encouraged the young boy's studies. Ornstein was recognized early on as a prodigy on the piano; in 1902, when the celebrated Polish pianist Josef Hofmann visited Kremenchug, he heard the six-year-old Ornstein perform. Hofmann gave him a letter of recommendation to the highly regarded St. Petersburg Conservatory. Soon after, Ornstein was accepted as a pupil at the Imperial School of Music in Kiev, then headed by Vladimir Puchalsky. <b>A</b> <b>death</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> family forced Ornstein's return home. In 1903, Osip Gabrilovich heard him play and recommended him to the Moscow Conservatory. In 1904, the eight-year-old Ornstein auditioned for and was accepted by the St. Petersburg school. There he studied composition with Alexander Glazunov and piano with Anna Yesipova. By the age of eleven, Ornstein was earning his way by coaching opera singers. To escape the pogroms incited by the nationalist and antisemitic organisation Union of the Russian People, the family emigrated to the United States in February 1906. They settled in New York's Lower East Side, and Ornstein enrolled in the Institute of Musical Art—predecessor to the Juilliard School—where he studied piano with Bertha Feiring Tapper. In 1911, he made a well-received New York debut with pieces by Bach, Beethoven, Chopin, and Schumann. Recordings two years later of works by Chopin, Grieg, and Poldini demonstrate, according to music historian Michael Broyles, [...] "a pianist of sensitivity, prodigious technical ability, and artistic maturity." ...|$|E
