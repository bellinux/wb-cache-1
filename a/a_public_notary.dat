During his final years in college, Peña Nieto worked for <b>a</b> <b>public</b> <b>notary</b> in Mexico City, {{around the same time}} when his relative, Alfredo del Mazo González, was {{mentioned}} as a firm candidate for the 1988 presidential elections. In his twenties, he worked at the San Luis Industrial Corporation, an auto parts manufacturer, and at the law firm Laffan, Muse and Kaye.

He also befriended and roomed with Luis Miranda, who occupied several offices during the 1999–2000 administration in the State of Mexico.|$|E

6000|$|It {{is further}} remarkable, in this {{judicial}} argument, that exceptions are allowed {{not only to}} rules of evidence, but that the rules of evidence themselves are not altogether the same, where the subject-matter varies. The Judges have, to facilitate justice, and to favor commerce, even adopted the rules of foreign laws. They have taken for granted, and would not suffer to be questioned, the regularity and justice of the proceedings of foreign courts; and they have admitted them as evidence, {{not only of the}} fact of the decision, but of the right as to its legality. [...] "Where there are foreign parties interested, and in commercial matters, the rules of evidence are not quite the same as in other instances in courts of justice: the case of Hue and Cry, Brownlow, 47. A feme covert is not a lawful witness against her husband, except in cases of treason, but has been admitted in civil cases.[53] The testimony of <b>a</b> <b>public</b> <b>notary</b> is evidence by the law of France: contracts are made before <b>a</b> <b>public</b> <b>notary,</b> and no other witness necessary. I should think it would be no doubt at all, if it came in question here, whether this would be a valid contract, but a testimony from persons of that credit and reputation would be received as a very good proof in foreign transactions, and would authenticate the contract."[54] ...|$|E
6000|$|This {{has been}} controverted, I know, in some cases, but I have always found, {{that by the}} most {{experienced}} merchants, and especially in places of the greatest business abroad, it was always given in favour of the remitter, namely, that the right of guiding the payment is in him, all the time the bill is running; and no bill can or ought to be paid before it is due, without the declared assent of the remitter, signified under his hand, and attested by <b>a</b> <b>public</b> <b>notary.</b> There are, I say, abundance of niceties {{in the matter of}} foreign exchanges, and in the manner of drawing, accepting, and protesting bills; but as I am now speaking with, and have confined my discourse in this work to, the inland tradesmen of England, I think it would be as unprofitable to them to meddle with this, as {{it would be difficult to}} them to understand it.[48] ...|$|E
60|$|And, indeed, this he {{performed}} very faithfully {{in a few}} days, making himself indebted to me 470 moidores of gold, over and above what had been lost at sea, after I had left the place. And then he recounted to me what misfortune he had gone through, which forced my money out of his hands, to buy part in a new ship-but says he, you shall not want, take this; and, when my son returns, every farthing shall be paid you. Upon which he put into my hand a purse of 150 moidores in gold, as likewise the instrument, containing the title to the ship which his son was in, and which he offered as security for the remainder. But really when I saw so much goodness, generosity, tenderness, and real honesty, I had not the heart to accept it, for fear he should straiten himself upon my account. It is true, said he, it may be so; but then the money is yours, not mine, {{and you may have}} the greatest occasion for it. However, I returned fifty of them back again, promising that I would freely forgive him the other hundred when I got my effects into my hands, and that I designed to go myself for that purpose. But he told me he could save me that trouble, and so caused me to enter my name with <b>a</b> <b>public</b> <b>notary,</b> as likewise my affidavit, with a procuration affixed to it; and this he ordered me to send in a letter to one of his acquaintance, a merchant in Brazil; and, indeed, nothing could be more faithfully and honourably observed; for, in seven months time, I had a very faithful account of all my effects, what sums of money were raised, what expended, and what remained for myself! In a word I found myself to be worth 5000L. sterling, and 1000 per annum. Nor was this all, for my partner congratulated me upon my being alive, telling me how much my plantation was improved; what Negroes were at work, and how many Ave Marias he had said to the Virgin Mary for my preservation, desiring me to accept kindly some presents he had sent me, which I found showed the greatest generosity.|$|E
