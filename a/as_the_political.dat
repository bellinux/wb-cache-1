5|$|Amid German defeats {{against the}} Russians on the Eastern Front after 1942, the King {{prepared}} {{for the end of}} the war. He ordered the preparation of a document, known <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Political</b> Testament (Testament Politique), which would justify his behaviour under the occupation and detail his interventions on behalf of Belgian prisoners of war and deported workers. Leopold however continued to condemn the action of the Belgian government in exile (based in London after October 1940). On 7 June 1944, following D-Day, he was deported to Germany. He was finally liberated by American forces on 7 May 1945.|$|E

5|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> {{climate in}} New South Wales became more {{volatile}} after Lang's attempts {{to abolish the}} Legislative Council and conflict with the Federal Government over debts, Bruxner emphasised the need that the Country Party remain independent of the United Australia Party (which had succeeded the Nationalist Party) amidst calls for the opposition to unite. On 26 April 1932, Country Party Leader Buttenshaw notified the party of his intention to resign. Bruxner was then elected as the new party Leader.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> {{conflict}} escalated into full-scale {{rebellion in}} 1321–22, Edmund {{played an important}} role in its suppression. The opposition stemmed from resentment against the king's new favourites, Hugh Despenser the Younger and Hugh Despenser the Elder. When Bartholomew Badlesmere, steward of the royal household, defected to the opposition, Edward made his youngest brother Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports in place of Badlesmere on 16 June. In the parliament of July 1321, Edmund briefly sided with the opposition when he agreed to exile the Despensers, but later claimed this had been done under duress, and in November sat on the council that annulled the exile.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> {{situation}} deteriorated, Whitlam and {{his government}} continued to enact legislation: The Family Law Act 1975 provided for no-fault divorce while the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 caused Australia to ratify the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination that Australia had signed under Holt, but which had never been ratified. In August 1975, Whitlam gave the Gurindji people of the Northern Territory title deeds to part of their traditional lands, beginning the process of Aboriginal land reform. The next month, Australia granted independence to Papua New Guinea.|$|E

5|$|But as American {{involvement}} in Vietnam was winding down, the Army canceled the Cheyenne program on 9 August 1972. By this time, the AH-1 Cobra was widely deployed by the Army during the Vietnam War and {{equipped with the}} TOW anti-tank missile. Controversy with the United States Air Force over the Cheyenne's role in combat as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> climate regarding military acquisition programs had caused the Army to amend the service's attack helicopter requirements {{in favor of a}} twin-engine conventional helicopter, viewed as less technical and more survivable. The Army announced a new program for an Advanced Attack Helicopter (AAH) on 17 August 1972, which {{led to the development of}} the AH-64 Apache.|$|E

He {{has been described as a}} beacon of economic conservatism and a hero for his urban agenda. Today, he continues to be described as a hero to fiscal conservatives who believe that free markets and low taxes work better than government bureaucracies. Kemp was considered the leader of the progressive conservatives who adhere to the hard right on social issues, but avoid protectionist fiscal and trade policy.|$|E

5|$|Justinian also {{strengthened}} {{the borders of}} the Empire from Africa to the East through the construction of fortifications and ensured Constantinople of its water supply through construction of underground cisterns (see Basilica Cistern). To prevent floods from damaging the strategically important border town Dara, an advanced arch dam was built. During his reign the large Sangarius Bridge was built in Bithynia, securing a major military supply route to the east. Furthermore, Justinian restored cities damaged by earthquake or war and built a new city near his place of birth called Justiniana Prima, which was intended to replace Thessalonica <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> and religious centre of Illyricum.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{important}} shift was a religious one: Thebes effectively became the religious as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> center of the country, its local god Amun credited with inspiring Ahmose in his victories over the Hyksos.

He died soon after in Bucharest, and was buried in the World War I heroes' crypt in Mărăști.

His {{support for the}} Khilafat movement also helped him sideline Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who had announced {{his opposition to the}} satyagraha non-cooperation movement approach of Gandhi.

5|$|There {{is often}} a fierce rivalry between the two strongest teams in a {{national}} league, and this is particularly the case in La Liga, where the game between Barcelona and Real Madrid is known as El Clásico. From the start of national competitions the clubs were seen as representatives of two rival regions in Spain: Catalonia and Castile, {{as well as of}} the two cities. The rivalry reflects what many regard <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> and cultural tensions felt between Catalans and the Castilians, seen by one author as a re-enactment of the Spanish Civil War.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{communist}} groups existed in Sarawak, {{the first of}} which, the Sarawak Overseas Chinese Democratic Youth League, formed in 1951. Another group, the North Kalimantan Communist Party (NKCP) (also known as Clandestine Communist Organisation (CCO) by government sources) was formally set up in 1970. Weng Min Chyuan and Bong Kee Chok {{were two of the}} more notable communist leaders involved in the insurgency. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> scene changed, it grew progressively more difficult for the communists to operate. This led to Bong opening talks with chief minister Abdul Rahman Ya'kub in 1973 and eventually signing an agreement with the government. Weng, who had moved to China in the mid-1960s but nonetheless retained control of the CCO, pushed for a continued armed insurrection against the government in spite of this agreement. The conflict continued mostly in the Rajang Delta region but eventually ended when, on 17 October 1990, the NKCP signed a peace agreement with the Sarawak government.|$|E

5|$|After {{being pushed}} back repeatedly, a {{constitutional}} referendum {{was held on}} 17 November 2010 that resulted in adoption of the state's fourth constitution with 73% in favor and a voter turnout of 52.6%. The independent Malagasy political watchdog group KMF-CNOE, as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> opposition and the international community, cited numerous irregularities in the process, which was carried out unilaterally by the HAT. The constitution in effect at the time Rajoelina took office required that presidential candidates attain a minimum of 40 years of age. One substantive change made by the new constitution was to lower the minimum age for presidential candidates from 40 to 35, making Rajoelina eligible to stand in presidential elections. In addition, the new constitution mandated {{the leader of the}} High Transitional Authority – the position held by Rajoelina – be kept as interim president until an election could take place. The new constitution also contained a clause that required presidential candidates to have lived in Madagascar for at least six months prior to the elections, effectively barring Ravalomanana and other opposition leaders living in exile from running in the next election. After being repeatedly postponed, the general election was held on 25 October 2013.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{as active}} in routine business, Johnson still took an {{interest}} in political events. For example, he spearheaded the efforts of the booksellers of London and Westminster to appeal a new copyright law in 1808. Moreover, although Johnson did not publish controversial political works after his imprisonment, he still undertook important publishing ventures. For example, he administered the publication of a forty-five volume work entitled The British Essayists, edited by Alexander Chalmers; the complete works of Samuel Johnson; and a ten-volume set of Shakespeare. Johnson published in more congers during the last decade of his life than at any other time. He also occasionally published important new authors, such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> economist Thomas Malthus, whose Essay on the Principle of Population (1798) sparked a long debate between idealists and pragmatists. His emphasis on educational books continued or even increased as his interest in publishing contentious political works diminished. He also continued to support his friends, as with Godwin, who needed financial rescue after his play, Faulkener, cost him £800.|$|E
5|$|China's newly commercialized {{society was}} evident in the {{differences}} between its northern capital and the earlier Tang capital at Chang'an. A center of great wealth, Chang'an's importance <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> center eclipsed its importance as a commercial entrepôt; Yangzhou was the economic hub of China during the Tang period. On the other hand, Kaifeng's role as a commercial center in China was as important as its political role. After the curfew was abolished in 1063, marketplaces in Kaifeng were open every hour of the day, whereas a strict curfew was imposed upon the two official marketplaces of Tang era Chang'an starting at dusk; this curfew limited its commercial potential. Shopkeepers and peddlers in Kaifeng began selling their goods at dawn. Along the wide avenue of the Imperial Way, breakfast delicacies were sold in shops and stalls and peddlers offered hot water for washing the face at the entrances of bathhouses. Lively activity in the markets did not begin to wane until about the evening meal of the day, while noodle shops remained open all day and night. People in the Song era were also more eager to purchase houses located near bustling markets than in earlier periods. Kaifeng's wealthy, multi-story houses and common urban dwellings were situated along the streets of the city, rather than hidden inside walled compounds and gated wards as they had been in the earlier Tang capital.|$|E
