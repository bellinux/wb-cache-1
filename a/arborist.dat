2500|$|<b>Arborists</b> gain {{qualifications}} {{to practice}} arboriculture {{in a variety}} of ways and some <b>arborists</b> are more qualified than others. [...] Experience working safely and effectively in and around trees is essential. [...] <b>Arborists</b> tend to specialize in one or more disciplines of arboriculture, such as diagnosis and treatment, climbing and pruning, cabling and lightning protection, or perhaps consultation and report writing. [...] All these disciplines are related and some <b>arborists</b> are very well experienced in all areas of tree work, but not all <b>arborists</b> have the training or experience to properly practice every discipline.|$|R

Since the plans provide information vital to the <b>arborists,</b> his or her proper evaluation will show the negative impact and the changes that can be negotiated to lower these impacts. Therefore, <b>arborists</b> need to educate themselves on the reading of basic construction plans. <b>Arborists</b> possess {{a wide range of}} knowledge related to tree health, from pruning methods to soil science. They evaluate disease and insects pests, appraise tree values, and calculate hazard po-tentials. Training prepares them to understand th...|$|R

While {{some aspects of}} this work are done {{on the ground or}} in an office, much of it is done by <b>arborists</b> who perform tree {{services}} and who climb the trees with ropes, harnesses and other equipment. Lifts and cranes may be used too. The work of all <b>arborists</b> is not the same. Some may just provide a consulting service; others may perform climbing, pruning and planting: whilst others may provide a combination of all of these services.|$|R

2500|$|<b>Arborists</b> {{generally}} {{focus on}} {{the health and safety}} of individual plants and trees, rather than managing forests (the domains of forestry and silviculture) or harvesting wood.

2500|$|<b>Arborists</b> are {{frequently}} consulted {{to establish the}} factual basis of disputes involving trees, or by private property owners seeking to avoid legal liability through the duty of care. [...] <b>Arborists</b> {{may be asked to}} assess the value of a tree in the process of an insurance claim for trees damaged or destroyed, or to recover damages resulting from tree theft or vandalism. [...] In cities with tree preservation orders an <b>arborist's</b> evaluation of tree hazard may be required before a property owner may remove a tree, or to assure the protection of trees in development plans and during construction operations. Carrying out work on protected trees and hedges is illegal without express permission from local authorities, and can result in legal action including fines. [...] Homeowners who have entered into contracts with a homeowner's association (see also Restrictive covenants) may need an <b>arborist's</b> professional opinion of a hazardous condition prior to removing a tree, or may be obligated to assure the protection of the views of neighboring properties prior to planting a tree or in the course of pruning. [...] <b>Arborists</b> may be consulted in forensic investigations where the evidence of a crime can be determined within the growth rings of a tree, for example. [...] <b>Arborists</b> may be engaged by one member of a dispute in order to identify factual information about trees useful to that member of the dispute, or they can be engaged as an expert witness providing unbiased scientific knowledge in a court case. [...] Homeowners associations seeking to write restrictive covenants, or legislative bodies seeking to write laws involving trees, may seek the counsel of <b>arborists</b> in order to avoid future difficulties.|$|R

25|$|<b>Arborists</b> who climb (as not all do) can use {{a variety}} of {{techniques}} to ascend into the tree. The least invasive, and most popular technique used is to ascend on rope. There are two common methods of climbing, Single Rope Technique (SRT) and Double Rope Technique (DRT or DdRT). When personal safety is an issue, or the tree is being removed, <b>arborists</b> may use 'spikes', (also known as 'gaffs' or 'spurs') attached to their chainsaw boots with straps to ascend and work. Spikes wound the tree, leaving small holes where each step has been.|$|R

It is used for both ascending and descending, and is preferred by many <b>arborists</b> over other hitches, such as the taut-line hitch, as it is less prone to binding.|$|R
