5|$|Despite {{the declining}} {{prevalence}} of marriage, {{more than three-quarters}} of Americans will marry at least once in their lifetime. The average age for marriage for a male was 26.8 and 25.1 for a female. Americans are also likely to remarry after their first divorce. In 1990, 40% of all marriages were remarriages.

Personal income changes considerably over the life-time of the average American, from $28,000 at age 25 to about $42,000 {{at the age of}} 65. Yet, very young and old persons would commonly not be considered to be average Americans.|$|E
