5|$|On November 27, 1998, King County Metro driver Mark McLaughlin, {{the driver}} of a {{southbound}} route 359 Express articulated bus, {{was shot and killed}} by a passenger, Silas Cool, while driving across the bridge. Cool then shot himself <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> veered across two lanes of traffic and plunged off the bridge's eastern side onto the roof of an apartment building below. Herman Liebelt, a passenger on the bus, later died of injuries he sustained in the crash.|$|E
5|$|The agents {{interview}} Tony Fiore, the ex-partner of Morris, who attributes Morris' {{death to}} a triad gang {{they had been}} investigating together. Later that day, Fiore meets with a Leon Felder, and the two discuss claiming a large sum of money from a safety deposit box, but agree that they haven't waited the ten years they had intended to, ominously discussing {{that they are the}} last two claimants left. That night, Felder gets off a bus, but his scarf catches in the door, seemingly moved by an invisible force, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> drives off. The driver tries to brake, but the bus inexplicably continues to accelerate, strangling Felder as Michelle watches from inside the bus.|$|E
5|$|As {{the train}} departs towards King's Cross, Rubeus Hagrid waves riders goodbye {{outside of the}} window. Shadows of Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger can also been seen walking down the train corridor, looking for an empty compartment. Following this, Buckbeak flies outside the window, while Hogwarts {{can be seen in}} the background. Shortly after, the train enters a forest where centaurs are running. Upon exiting the forest, Hogwarts can be seen once again in the background. Fred and George Weasley appear, flying broomsticks and playing with fireworks. The Hogwarts Express then enters a tunnel, after which riders find {{themselves}} in the middle of a storm and pass Malfoy Manor. The journey then enters a second tunnel; Harry, Ron, and Hermione appear again in the train corridor. As a spider crawls up the compartment door, Ron eats it and the trio continue to walk on down the corridor. After the tunnel the journey continues into London passing by an industrial factory and then a residential area. The Knight Bus then appears; squeezing between buildings and shrinking to pass under a bridge. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> drives away, the train enters King's Cross station, where Alastor Moody greets passengers.|$|E

5|$|Business US Highway127 (Bus. US127) is a {{business}} loop through Alma. The highway starts at a partial interchange for exit123 on US127 {{in a rural area}} east of Alma. There are a few businesses adjacent to the interchange and an intersection with State Road, which provides access to another partial interchange with US127 as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bus.</b> US127 for St. Louis. Continuing westward along Lincoln Road, the landscape along the southern leg of Bus. US127 comprises farm land. Once the highway enters Alma, the street name changes to Superior Street. Bus. US127 crosses the Pine River and runs through residential neighborhoods on the eastern side of Alma before entering the downtown area. At an intersection with Wright Avenue to the east of the campus of Alma College, Bus. US127 turns northward. North of downtown, the business loop crosses another residential area before passed the hospital and more commercial properties. In Pine River Township north of the city, Bus. US127 intersects M-46 (Monroe Road). M-46 connects the Alm{{a business}} loop to the St. Louis business loop and a partial interchange with US127, while the Alma business loop continues less than half a mile (0.6km) to the partial interchange with US127 that serves as the business loop's northern terminus.|$|E

50|$|After World War II, <b>the</b> Transit <b>Bus</b> was rebranded <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Universal <b>Bus</b> in Ford's marketing, but {{remained}} commonly known <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Transit <b>Bus.</b> Postwar demand was high, and 4,800 buses were sold during 1946 and 1947. However, production ended in September 1947. Changes in Ford's {{production and distribution}} arrangements fostered the designing of a replacement model, designated the 8MB, the prototype chassis for which was also built in September 1947.|$|R

25|$|The Brevik Line {{opened with}} {{electric}} traction from 19 June 1949, {{along with the}} Bratsberg Line through Grenland. Thus electric trains from Oslo could reach Brevik via that route. The Vestfold Line would not be electrified until the mid-1950s. With the electrification the line saw a major increase in traffic—by 1951 there were eighteen round trips and nineteen from 1957, operating at a fixed, hourly headway. Following the 1962 opening of the Brevik Bridge the railway saw {{a sharp decline in}} patronage <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> service was rerouted, capturing more of the traffic. Thus NSB decided to terminate the commuter trains to Skien from 1 February 1964. The express trains followed suit and since 26 May 1968 there has only been freight trains on the line.|$|E
25|$|The station {{received}} a face-lift in the 1930s, {{at which time}} the restaurant was moved from the southern to the northern wing. It was moved back after renovations in 1954, which also saw the main entrance moved to the road side and the offices and ticket booths renovated. Water closets were installed. To shorten {{the distance to the}} ferry quay, a pedestrian path was built in the 1950s. Following the 1962 opening of the Brevik Bridge the railway saw a sharp decline in patronage <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> service was rerouted, capturing more of the traffic. Thus NSB decided to terminate the commuter trains to Skien from 1 February 1964. The express trains followed suit and since 26 May 1968 there has only been freight trains on the line.

25|$|Attached devices {{can take}} either {{the form of}} an {{integrated}} circuit fitted onto the motherboard itself (called a planar device in the PCI specification) or an expansion card that fits into a slot. The PCI Local Bus was first implemented in IBM PC compatibles, where it displaced the combination of several slow ISA slots and one fast VESA Local Bus slot <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> configuration. It has subsequently been adopted for other computer types. Typical PCI cards used in PCs include: network cards, sound cards, modems, extra ports such as USB or serial, TV tuner cards and disk controllers. PCI video cards replaced ISA and VESA cards until growing bandwidth requirements outgrew the capabilities of PCI. The preferred interface for video cards then became AGP, itself a superset of conventional PCI, before giving way to PCI Express.|$|E
25|$|In May 1949, Triboro Coach {{appealed to}} the police {{commissioner}} for permission to move the bus stop to the intersection. Following approval, the bus stop was moved north {{to the corner of}} Ditmars and 31st Street. In October 1949, the bus stop was shifted back to the station stairs following protests from commuters. This move was intended to be temporary, but the stop at the corner was not reinstated. At the end of April 1950, Triboro decided to shift the bus stop back to the corner, this time due to several accidents with the pillars of the Astoria elevated line. The original setup at the middle of the block was more convenient for subway riders, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> stop was adjacent to the station. As late as 1962, there were calls to reinstate the former setup. The two bus routes were merged around 1960.|$|E
25|$|The {{public transit}} system in Metro Vancouver, planned {{and funded by}} TransLink, {{currently}} has bus and rail connections from Richmond to Downtown Vancouver, Surrey, New Westminster, Burnaby, Delta and the University of British Columbia. A SkyTrain rail line called the Canada Line, connecting both Richmond Centre and the airport to Downtown Vancouver and to points in between, opened on Monday, 17 August 2009. The Canada Line provides travel to Downtown Vancouver in 25 minutes with a frequency of 3 to 12 minutes, 20 hours per day, using the same fares <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> system. Major transit hubs are the Richmond–Brighouse Station, which is the hub for almost all Richmond bus routes, and the Bridgeport Station which is the hub for all bus routes from outlying suburbs.
