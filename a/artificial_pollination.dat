2500|$|Hybridizing philodendrons {{is quite}} easy if {{flowering}} plants are available, {{because they have}} very few barriers to prevent hybridization. However, some aspects of making crosses can make philodendron hybridization more difficult. Philodendrons often flower at different times and {{the time when the}} spathe opens up varies from plant to plant. The pollen and the inflorescence both have short lives, which means a large collection of philodendrons is necessary if crossbreeding is to be done successfully. The pollen life can be extended to a few weeks by storing it in film canisters in a refrigerator. [...] <b>Artificial</b> <b>pollination</b> is usually achieved by first mixing the pollen with water. A window is then cut into the spathe and the water-pollen mixture is rubbed on the fertile female flowers. The entire spathe is then covered in a plastic bag so the water-pollen mixture does not dry out; the bag is removed a few days later. If the inflorescence has not been fertilized, it will fall off, usually within a few weeks.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Artificial {{introductions}} of non-native species by humans can remove geographical barriers between species. In {{the absence of}} reproductive barriers, closely related introduced taxa {{may be able to}} hybridize, resulting in the formation of novel genotypes. These may be more suited to the new environment than either of their parent taxa, and have the potential to become more invasive. We investigated potential reproductive barriers between the non-native invasive Impatiens glandulifera and its less aggressive non-native congener I. balfourii. We examined behaviour of pollinators, including their foraging preferences and whether they switched from one species to the other. Moreover, conspecific and interspecific artificial crosses were performed between these species and seed production and the germination success of hybrid seeds were assessed. Both I. balfourii and I. glandulifera had relatively long flowering periods which mostly overlapped. Insect visitors were observed to switch from flowers of one species to the other during a single foraging bout, confirming that natural pollen transfer between species is possible. <b>Artificial</b> interspecific <b>pollination</b> resulted in the production of seeds, suggesting the presence of incomplete reproductive barriers between the two species. However, hybrid seeds mostly failed to germinate making the production of invasive hybrids unlikely. Nevertheless, because of the prolific reproductive output of these species we would not exclude the possibility that some viable hybrid seeds could be formed and become established. Further investigation of the fitness of hybrid seeds is required as hybridisation may allow Impatiens to exploit different ecological niches...|$|R
40|$|Worldwide wheat (Triticum aestivum L. em. Thell, 2 n = 6 X = 42, AABBDD) {{breeding}} programs aim {{to reorganize}} genotypes to achieve better yields, environmental adaptation and food quality. The necessary interdisciplinarity for breeding purposes requires an accurate {{choice of the}} most appropriate cellular and/or molecular strategies available to be integrated with agronomic approaches in order to overcome the genetic limitation of each cultivated species, at each agroecosystem. Cytogenetics has given a great contribution to wheat genetic studies and breeding, due to viability of chromosomal variants because of homoeology among genomes in this allohexaploid species and the genus Triticum. The level of development of cytogenetic techniques achieved over the last 60 years has set wheat apart from other cereal crops in terms of possibilities to introduce genetic material from other species. Cytogenetic approaches have been extensively used in chromosomal mapping and/or resistance gene transference from tribe Triticeae-related species. Monosomic analysis, entire chromosomes engineered through single additions and/or substitutions, reciprocal translocation through radiation or manipulation of homoeologous pairing, as well as synthesis of new amphiploids to allow homologous recombination by chiasmata evolved considerably since the past decades. The association of tissue culture and molecular biology techniques provides bread wheat breeding programs with a powerful set of biotechnological tools. However, knowledge on genetic system components, cytotaxonomical relationships, cytogenetic structure and evolutionary history of wheat species cannot be neglected. This information indicates the appropriate strategy to avoid isolation mechanisms in interspecific or intergeneric crosses, according to the genome constitution of the species the desired gene is to be transferred from. The development of amphiploids as "bridge" species {{is one of the}} available procedures to facilitate gene flow between wheat and related species. Since the environment at the center of origin of wheat in Southern Asia is quite different from subtropical environments, Brazilian breeding programs overcome more challenges to adapt wheat crop to biotic and abiotic stresses than some other countries. The germplasm bank of Embrapa Trigo has about 1000 registered entries of Triticum relatives, Aegilops, Secale and Agropyron species supplied from several germplasm banks distributed over the world which were multiplied and/or selected for naturally occurring or artificially inoculated fungal diseases. Since Aegilops squarrosa L. entries showed very good performance, the genetic variability observed in this species was firstly exploited. It is reported here the strategy used for transferring useful genes from Ae. squarrosa (DD, 2 n = 14) : crossing with tetraploid species (AABB, 2 n = 28), rescue and in vitro culture of immature embryos for regeneration of the trihaploid (ABD, 2 n = 21) hybrid, and colchicine treatment for genome duplication resulting in the artificial synthesis of hexaploid wheat lines (AABBDD, 2 n = 42).

O trabalho com o gênero Dendrobium foi iniciado utilizando 15 plantas de Dendrobium nobile selecionadas por um produtor da Holambra. Foram realizados 11 cruzamentos e 10 autofecundações, com o objetivo de avaliar a germinação e crescimento {{in vitro}} e o florescimento das plantas resultantes. As polinizações artificiais foram {{realizadas}} na casa de vegetação, e, aos nove meses foram coletadas as cápsulas. As cápsulas foram esterilizadas e as sementes germinadas in vitro. Após cinco meses do cultivo in vitro no meio MS (Murashige e Skoog, 1962) foram avaliadas a altura da plântula, o número de raízes, a massa fresca e seca total. Os cruzamentos D 9 x D 7; D 6 x D 15; D 13 x D 15; D 14 x D 7 e D 3 x D 8 e as autofecundações D 10 e D 7 foram os mais favoráveis para o crescimento in vitro. As plântulas restantes foram transferidas para bandejas de isopor tendo como substrato o esfagno. Após a etapa de aclimatização 20 mudas resultantes de cada cruzamento e autofecundação foram cultivadas individualmente em vasos de plástico em telado para a avaliação do desenvolvimento vegetativo e florescimento. Três cruzamentos destacaram-se pela exuberância, número e cores das flores, homogeneidade da progênie e vigor no florescimento. O florescimento ocorreu nos meses de agosto e setembro de 2005. As três cultivares selecionadas apresentaram 100 % de florescimento e possuem as seguintes características: a planta do cruzamento D 9 x D 7 com pseudobulbo com aproximadamente 35 cm de altura, as flores apresentam coloração roxa, e tamanho médio de 5, 0 cm de diâmetro; a planta do cruzamento D 3 x D 8 apresenta flores de coloração amarelo com cerca de 7, 0 cm de diâmetro e durabilidade de quase 30 dias; e a do cruzamento D 14 x D 7 apresenta flores roxas com cerca de 8, 0 cm de diâmetro e alguns pseudobulbos produzem 30 flores. The Department of Agronomy from Universidade Estadual de Londrina (UEL) started in 1997 {{a program of}} improvement with diverse genus of orchids. The work with the genus Dendrobium initiated with 15 plants of Dendrobium nobile selected by a producer from the city Holambra. In this work, 11 crossings and 10 self-pollination were done with the objective to evaluate the germination and the in vitro development and the bloom of the plants obtained. The <b>artificial</b> <b>pollinations</b> were conducted in greenhouse and nine months later the capsules were collected. The capsules were sterilized and the seed were germinated in vitro. After five months of in vitro cultivation, in MS media (Murashige e Skoog, 1962), the seedlings height, the number of roots and the total of fresh and dry mass were evaluated. The crossings D 9 x D 7; D 6 x D 15; D 13 x D 15; D 14 x D 7 and D 3 x D 8 and the self-pollinations D 10 and D 7 were the most favorable to the in vitro growing. The others seedlings were transferred to styrofoam trays having as substratum the sphagnum. After the acclimatization step, 20 seedlings obtained from each crossing and each self-pollination was cultivated individually in plastic vases, at screen, to evaluate the vegetative development and the bloom. Three hybrids were distinguished by their exuberance, number and colors of flowers, progenies homogeneity and vigor in the bloom. The bloom occurred in August and September of 2005. The three cultivars selected had 100 % of bloom and the following characteristics: the plant from the crossing of D 9 x D 7 with pseodobulb within 35 cm in media of height, flowers having on average 5, 0 cm of diameter and purple coloration; the crossing D 3 x D 8 produced a plant with yellow flowers within 7, 0 cm of diameter on average and durability of 30 days; D 14 x D 7 produced plants with purple flowers within 8, 0 cm of diameter on average and some pseudobulbs producing 30 flowers...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDisease {{is one of}} {{the main}} factors driving both natural and {{artificial}} selection. It is a particularly important and increasing threat to the managed honeybee colonies, which are vital in crop <b>pollination.</b> <b>Artificial</b> selection for disease-resistant honeybee genotypes has previously only been carried out at the colony-level, that is, by using queens or males reared from colonies that show resistance. However, honeybee queens mate with many males and so each colony consists of multiple patrilines that will vary in heritable traits, such as disease resistance. Here, we investigate whether response to artificial selection for a key resistance mechanism, hygienic behaviour, can be improved using multi-level selection, that is, by selecting not only among colonies as normal but also among patrilines within colonies. Highly hygienic colonies were identified (between-colony selection), and the specific patrilines within them responsible for most hygienic behaviour were determined using observation hives. Queens reared from these hygienic patrilines (within-colony selection) were identified using DNA microsatellite analysis of a wing-tip tissue sample and then mated to drones from a third highly hygienic colony. The resulting colonies headed by queens from hygienic patrilines showed approximately double the level of hygienic behaviour of colonies headed by sister queens from non-hygienic patrilines. The results show that multi-level selection can significantly improve the success of honeybee breeding programs...|$|R
