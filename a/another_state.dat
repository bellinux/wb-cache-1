5|$|When the Sproul Road Bill {{was signed}} on May 31, 1911, the state began {{maintenance}} over state highways. One of those highways was Legislative Route 157, the modern Hamilton Boulevard section of PA 222, west of Allentown. <b>Another</b> <b>state</b> highway was Legislative Route 159, aligned east of Allentown to downtown Bethlehem along Hanover Avenue and Broad Street. No routes had a designation {{within the city}} of Allentown.|$|E
5|$|A {{trademark}} dispute {{involving the}} owners of the identically named Burger King in Mattoon, Illinois led to a federal lawsuit; the case's outcome helped define the scope of the Lanham act and trademark law in the United States. An existing trademark held by a shop of the same name in South Australia forced the company to change its name in Australia, while <b>another</b> <b>state</b> trademark in Texas forced the company to abandon its signature product, the Whopper, in several counties around San Antonio. The company was only able to enter northern Alberta, in Canada, in 1995, after it paid the founders of another chain named Burger King.|$|E

5|$|América won {{the next}} ten editions of the Mineiro, and Atlético only won the league again in 1926, led by striker Mário de Castro. In 1927, {{forwards}} Said and Jairo joined Castro to form an attacking partnership nicknamed the Trio Maldito ("Unholy Trio"), which guided Atlético to <b>another</b> <b>state</b> league triumph. In 1929, the club played its first international encounter, against Portuguese club Vitória de Setúbal, winning 3–1 in a match played at the Presidente Antônio Carlos Stadium. The ground had opened earlier that year, and would be the club's home for the following two decades.|$|E
5|$|From 1929 until 1960, {{the road}} {{was part of the}} state highway system as M-135. The {{northern}} end of the highway always contained a section that ran concurrently with M-98, <b>another</b> <b>state</b> highway in the area. For a period in the 1950s, M-135 had a different northern terminus separate from M-98's endpoint. A few years before both highways were removed from the highway system, M-135 was moved to use M-98's terminus with M-28. Since the 1970s, M-135 {{has been a part of}} the county-designated highway system and assigned the number H-33, a moniker it has borne since.|$|E
5|$|M-49 is a north–south state {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the south-central {{portion of the}} US state of Michigan. It runs from the Ohio state line north to Litchfield through rural Hillsdale County. M-49 is the only Michigan highway in which the road crossing into <b>another</b> <b>state</b> has the same state highway number. M-49 continues as State Route 49 (SR49), near the Indiana–Michigan–Ohio tripoint south of Camden. The highway dates back to 1930 and was only altered once in the 1940s. M-49 runs through Southern Michigan farmlands connecting several small towns along its path.|$|E

5|$|New York State Route375 (NY375), locally {{known as}} West Hurley Road for its entire length, {{is a short}} highway in the Catskill Park located entirely within Ulster County, New York, in the United States.

It runs northsouth from NY28 at West Hurley to near the business district of Woodstock, where it terminates at <b>another</b> <b>state</b> highway, NY212. The route was designated in the 1930 renumbering in New York, replacing a piece of legislative Route5 from 1908 and has remained unchanged since.|$|E
5|$|Other {{rooms in}} the state suite include the Red Room— so called because its walls are covered in red brocade— a large drawing room {{containing}} paintings by Jan Brueghel and Charles Le Brun. Like much of the palace the room contains ornate 18th-century French-style furniture. From the Red Room leads the York Room. Furnished as a state bedchamber, this room is frescoed with illustrations of the four seasons by Gregorio de Ferrari. The following room, known as the Yellow Room (or sometimes as the Louis XV Bedchamber), is <b>another</b> <b>state</b> bedroom.|$|E

Mosqueda-Lewis was <b>another</b> <b>State</b> Farm/WBCA High School Player of the Year for UConn, Banks was a highly rated guard, and Stokes, a 6'3 post player, was highly ranked as well.

5|$|The National Historic Landmarks in Indiana {{represent}} Indiana's {{history from}} the Native American era to its early European settlers and motor racing. There are 42 National Historic Landmarks (NHLs) in the state, which are located in 23 of its 92 counties. They illustrate the state's industrial and architectural heritage, as well as battles, circuses, education, and several other topics. One of the NHLs in the state has military significance, fourteen are significant examples of different architectural styles, nine are associated with significant historical figures, and one is an archaeological site. Two NHL properties, both ships that were formerly located in Indiana, were later moved to <b>another</b> <b>state.</b>|$|E

5|$|When {{the highway}} was first {{designated}} {{in the late}} 1910s, it extended farther south than it does today and ended well short of its current northern terminus. The southern end was added to <b>another</b> <b>state</b> highway, truncating M-18's length to roughly its current southern terminus in 1926. The northern end was also simultaneously extended {{for the first time}} with these revisions to the highway's routing. In the 1940s, the northern extension was reversed and then reinstated. M-18's course was last changed with the opening of three different freeways in the area in the 1960s and 1970s. The last extension in 1973 supplanted the M-144 designation from Roscommon north to Luzerne.|$|E

5|$|Article Two, {{initially}} {{ratified by}} seven states through 1792 (including Kentucky), was not ratified by <b>another</b> <b>state</b> for eighty years. The Ohio General Assembly ratified it on May 6, 1873 {{in protest of}} an unpopular Congressional pay raise. A century later, on March 6, 1978, the Wyoming Legislature also ratified the article. Gregory Watson, a University of Texas at Austin undergraduate student, started a new push for the article's ratification with a letter-writing campaign to state legislatures. As a result, by May 1992, enough states had approved Article Two (38 of the 50 states in the Union) for it to become the Twenty-seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution. The amendment's adoption was certified by Archivist of the United States Don W. Wilson and subsequently affirmed {{by a vote of}} Congress on May 20, 1992.|$|E
5|$|During the 1990s, {{attempts}} to both ban and legalize same-sex marriage {{did not pass}} through the legislature. After a Maryland House of Delegates committee voted in March 2004 to reject a pair of marriage bills that would have submitted a constitutional amendment against same-sex marriage to voters and invalidated same-sex marriages performed in <b>another</b> <b>state</b> or foreign country, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and Equality Maryland filed a lawsuit, Deane & Polyak v. Conaway, to challenge the existing law on behalf of nine same-sex couples and one bereaved man whose partner had died. The lead plaintiffs, from whom the case received its name, were Gita Deane, a learning specialist at Goucher College, and her partner Lisa Polyak, an environmental engineer for the U.S. Army Medical Department. The plaintiffs had applied for marriage licenses in several different Maryland counties but were denied by court officials. In their complaint, the plaintiffs argued that the state's statutory ban on same-sex marriage violated constitutional protections of due process, equality, and prohibitions against sex discrimination in Articles 24 and 46 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.|$|E
5|$|M-35 is an {{original}} state trunkline that was first designated by July 1, 1919, {{originally intended to}} run from Menominee {{in the south to}} near Big Bay in the north, before turning toward L'Anse to end at Ontonagon. However, the section through the Huron Mountains in northern Marquette and Baraga counties was never built. Automobile pioneer Henry Ford helped halt this construction to gain favor with and membership in the exclusive Huron Mountain Club. Some discontinuous sections were later ceded to local control. The northern segment of the route between Ontonagon and Baraga was retained as a discontinuous segment of the highway; this northern segment was redesignated as <b>another</b> <b>state</b> trunkline. The northern end was rerouted out of the City of Negaunee into Negaunee Township to avoid mining activity near Palmer.|$|E
