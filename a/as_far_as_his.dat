25|$|Born in Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, Romney's {{first-class}} debut came against Leicestershire: he made 4 and 10 not out. In {{his next}} game against Oxford University he hit what {{proved to be}} his highest score, 20 not out (the second top score in the innings) as Worcestershire were dismissed for 121 (they went on to lose by three wickets). Poor displays against Gloucestershire and MCC followed, {{and that was that}} <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> first-class career was concerned.|$|E
25|$|Despite another decent {{domestic}} {{season in}} 1973, Birkenshaw was {{omitted from the}} England side for both series that summer (against New Zealand and West Indies), the 41-year-old Illingworth again being the barrier to his selection. However, there was no Illingworth on the winter tour to the Caribbean, and Birkenshaw played {{in the last two}} Tests. A total return of 2–96 and 15 runs in three innings was not enough to keep his place for the summer of 1974, and that was <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> England career lasted.|$|E
25|$|Dravid {{did well}} in the 3–2 series win against New Zealand in the {{bilateral}} ODI series, scoring 240 runs in 5 games {{at an average of}} 60 and a strike rate of 83.62, ending as the second highest scorer in the series. The highlight of the series was his inning in the second game at Hyderabad. He scored run-a-ball 153 runs – his career best effort – which included 15 fours and two sixes. He featured in a 331-run partnership with Tendulkar, which was the highest partnership in ODI cricket history, a record that stood for 15 years until it was broken in 2015. With this series, Dravid ended an eventful year, <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> ODI career was concerned, on a high note. In 1999, Dravid scored 1761 runs in 43 ODIs at an average of 46.34 and a strike rate of 75.16 including 6 hundreds and 8 fifties and featured in two 300+ partnerships.|$|E

500|$|In {{his late}} twenties, Johnson formed two friendships {{that were to}} shape {{the rest of his}} life. The first was with the painter and writer Henry Fuseli, who was {{described}} as [...] "quick witted and pugnacious". Fuseli's early 19th-century biographer writes that when Fuseli met Johnson in 1764, Johnson [...] "had already acquired the character which he retained during life,—that of a man of great integrity, and encourager of literary men <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> means extended, and an excellent judge of their productions". Fuseli became and remained Johnson's closest friend.|$|E

The reason should be obvious. On television, I'm allowed to be myself; in pictures, I was always some other guy. I come over like just another bum in a tuxedo." [...] Como was offered some movie roles [...] that interested him after he began appearing on the weekly TV shows, but there was just never enough time to pursue any film work.|$|E
500|$|After The Michigan Daily criticized his {{performance}} following the Marietta game, Maulbetsch [...] "threatened to desert the Michigan squad {{and give up}} football for good." [...] It reportedly took Yost several hours to coax Maulbetsch to report for practice again, {{and in the next}} game against Case, Maulbetsch did not play until the third quarter. [...] In the season's first big game, Michigan was soundly beaten by Michigan Agricultural College, 24–0, and most of Maulbetsch's runs [...] "didn’t even get <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> own line." [...] In the final four games of the season, matters got worse for Michigan and Maulbetsch, as the team went 0–3–1, scoring only 14 points in four games.|$|E

500|$|The Pacific Northwest murders culminated on Sunday, July 14 {{with the}} broad {{daylight}} abductions {{of two women}} from a crowded beach at Lake Sammamish State Park in Issaquah, [...] east of Seattle. Five female witnesses described an attractive young man wearing a white tennis outfit with his left arm in a sling, speaking with a light accent, perhaps Canadian or British. Introducing himself as [...] "Ted," [...] he asked their help in unloading a sailboat from his tan or bronze-colored Volkswagen Beetle. Four refused; one accompanied him <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> car, {{saw that there was}} no sailboat, and fled. Three additional witnesses saw him approach Janice Anne Ott, 23, a probation case worker at the King County Juvenile Court, with the sailboat story, and watched her leave the beach in his company. About four hours later, Denise Marie Naslund, a 19-year-old woman who was studying to become a computer programmer, left a picnic to go to the restroom and never returned. Bundy told Stephen Michaud that Ott was still alive when he returned with Naslund—and that one was forced to watch as the other was murdered—but he later denied it in an interview with Lewis {{on the eve of his}} execution.|$|E

2500|$|Grimm's {{scientific}} character combined {{breadth and}} unity. He {{was as far}} removed from the narrowness of the specialist who has no ideas or sympathies beyond just one author or corner of science as he was from the shallow dabbler who feverishly attempts to master the details of a half-dozen unrelated pursuits. The same concentration exists within his own specialised studies. [...] The very foundations of his nature were harmonious; his patriotism and love of historical investigation realised their fullest satisfaction {{in the study of the}} language, traditions, mythology, laws and literature of his own country. But from this centre, he pursued his investigations in every direction <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> instinct allowed. He was equally fortunate in the harmony that existed between his intellectual and moral natures. He cheerfully made the heavy sacrifices that science demands from its disciples without envy or bitterness; although he lived apart from his fellow men, he was full of human sympathy.|$|E
2500|$|The {{novel is}} a satire {{of society as}} a whole, characterised by {{hypocrisy}} and opportunism, {{but it is not}} a reforming novel; there is no suggestion that social or political changes or greater piety and moral reformism could improve the nature of society. It thus paints a fairly bleak view of the human condition. This bleak portrait is continued with Thackeray's own role as an omniscient narrator, one of the writers best known for using the technique. He continually offers asides about his characters and compares them to actors and puppets, but his cheek goes even <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> readers, accusing all who may be interested in such [...] "Vanity Fairs" [...] as being either [...] "of a lazy, or a benevolent, or a sarcastic mood". As Lord David Cecil remarked, [...] "Thackeray liked people, and for the most part he thought them well-intentioned. But he also saw very clearly that they were all in some degree weak and vain, self-absorbed and self-deceived." [...] Amelia begins as a warm-hearted and friendly girl, though sentimental and naive, but by the story's end she is portrayed as vacuous and shallow. Dobbin appears first as loyal and magnanimous, if unaware of his own worth; by the end of the story he is presented as a tragic fool, a prisoner of his own sense of duty who knows he is wasting his gifts on Amelia but is unable to live without her. The novel's increasingly grim outlook can take readers aback, as characters whom the reader at first holds in sympathy are shown to be unworthy of such regard.|$|E
