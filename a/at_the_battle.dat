5|$|The Alamanni on {{the other}} hand resumed their drive towards Italy almost immediately. They {{defeated}} Aurelian <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Battle</b> of Placentia in 271 AD but were beaten back for a short time after they lost the battles of Fano and Pavia later that year. They were beaten again in 298 AD at the battles of Lingones and Vindonissa but fifty years later they were resurgent again, making incursions in 356 AD <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Battle</b> of Reims, in 357 AD <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Battle</b> of Strasbourg, in 367 AD <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Battle</b> of Solicinium and in 378 AD at Battle of Argentovaria.

5|$|After the French victory <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Battle</b> of Jena-Auerstadt, Bourcier {{was placed}} {{in charge of the}} several {{thousands}} of horses confiscated from the Prussians.

Although the Muslims neither won nor were defeated <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Battle</b> of Uhud, their military strength was gradually growing. In April 626 Muhammad raised {{a force of}} 300 men and 10 horses to meet the Quraysh army of 1,000 at Badr for the second time. Although no fighting occurred, the coastal tribes were impressed with Muslim power. Muhammad also tried, with limited success, to break up many alliances against the Muslim expansion. Nevertheless, {{he was unable to}} prevent the Meccan one.|$|E

5|$|Despite these successes, the Parthians {{were soon}} {{driven out of}} the Levant by a Roman counteroffensive. Publius Ventidius Bassus, an officer under Mark Antony, {{defeated}} and then executed Labienus <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Battle</b> of the Cilician Gates (in modern Mersin Province, Turkey) in 39 BC. Shortly afterward, a Parthian force in Syria led by general Pharnapates was defeated by Ventidius <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Battle</b> of Amanus Pass. As a result, Pacorus I temporarily withdrew from Syria. When he returned {{in the spring of}} 38BC, he faced Ventidius <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Battle</b> of Mount Gindarus, northeast of Antioch. Pacorus was killed during the battle, and his forces retreated across the Euphrates. His death spurred a succession crisis in which Orodes II chose Phraates IV of Parthia (r. c.38–2BC) as his new heir.|$|E
5|$|During the Peninsular War (1809–1814) in Spain, the Vistula Legion gained fame <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Battle</b> of Zaragoza. In the Battle of Fuengirola, a small Polish force {{managed to}} defeat an Anglo-Spanish expeditionary force outnumbering them 10-1, {{capturing}} their {{commander in the}} process. Other troops served in Napoleon's Imperial Guard and the Polish Chevau-léger regiment distinguished itself <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Battle</b> of Somosierra in 1808. Another Polish cavalry regiment– the Vistula uhlans– also fought in Spain. They distinguished themselves many times there, including <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Battle</b> of Albuhera in 1811, where they destroyed a British infantry brigade. Their valour in that conflict inspired the British {{to create their own}} lancer units equipped with Polish-style uniforms and weapons.|$|E
5|$|During {{the initial}} {{phase of the}} campaign, Nansouty's {{division}} was at first attached to Marshal Louis Nicolas Davout's III Corps, with which it crossed the Rhine and then the Danube, before rejoining Murat's cavalry reserve. Nansouty had a first opportunity to lead his men into combat <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Battle</b> of Wertingen, where his men were noted for their excellent manoeuvring. Detaching his two Carabiniers-à-Cheval regiments, which {{he had to leave}} with Murat, Nansouty and his reduced division followed the Emperor at Augsburg, where he was attached to Marshal Jean Lannes's V Corps. In this capacity, they supported Walther's division <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Battle</b> of Schöngrabern. Then, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Battle</b> of Wischau on 25 November 1805, the 9th Cuirassiers participated in a major cavalry action, alongside d'Hautpoul's cuirassier division, Walther's dragoons and Bessières's Grenadiers à Cheval and Chasseurs à Cheval of the Guard cavalry.|$|E

5|$|He also attacks Wei {{in campaigns}} masterminded by Zhuge Liang. Zhuge Liang gains Jiang Wei {{as a general}} after {{isolating}} him and tricking Wei general Ma Zun into thinking that he was betraying him, in a clever ploy <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Battle</b> of Tianshui ("Tales").

5|$|In 1266, {{conflict}} between the Hohenstaufen house and the Papacy led to Sicily's conquest by Charles I, Duke of Anjou. With the usurpation of the Sicilian throne from Conradin by Manfred of Sicily in 1258, {{the relationship between the}} Papacy and the Hohenstaufen had changed again. Instead of the boy Conradin, safely sequestered across the Alps, the Papacy now faced an able military leader who had greatly supported the Ghibelline cause <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> of Montaperti in 1260. Accordingly, when negotiations broke down with Manfred in 1262, Pope Urban IV again took up the scheme of disseising the Hohenstaufen from the kingdom, and offered the crown to Charles of Anjou again. With Papal and Guelph support Charles descended into Italy and defeated Manfred <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> of Benevento in 1266 and in 1268 Conradin <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> of Taglicozzo.|$|E
