500|$|During the controversy, Resistance: Fall of Man {{rose from}} 40th {{place in the}} United Kingdom's top 40 Full Priced video games chart to 22nd place for the week of 17 July to 23 July. It {{remained}} in the top 30 through the next week falling to 27th place, and to 36th place in the next week. In November 2009, IGN.com placed the incident in their [...] "Top 10 Gaming Controversies". It was also selected as a finalist along with six other games in the BAFTA British Academy Video Game Awards for the [...] "PC World Gamers Award", {{which is the only}} category based on sales and public reception. The Dean of Manchester Cathedral, the Very Reverend Rogers Govender, criticised the selection, stating that [...] "BAFTA should not be seen condoning such behaviour unless they <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>it</b> is acceptable for producers to walk into historic buildings and film interiors– ignoring contracts, rights and liability", asking for either BAFTA or Sony to withdraw the game from the award. Neither withdrew it, but it ultimately lost to Football Manager 2007.|$|E
500|$|Irreemplazable is {{primarily}} a R and Latin pop album. The Spanish-language songs from the EP were written by Cuban American composer Rudy Pérez and he wrote the lyrics phonetically to help Beyoncé perform the songs in Spanish. [...] "We spent hours and hours working on it. She {{wanted to make it}} perfect. She worked hard. That's why people <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>it</b> sounds like she's fluent in Spanish", Perez added. Pérez changed some of the words in Spanish as he felt it they [...] "didn't fit the music" [...] and [...] "doesn't make sense". He assisted with Beyoncé on pronouncing her r's in Spanish. Irreemplazable opens with [...] "Amor Gitano", a duet with Alejandro Fernández originally from Fernández' fifteenth studio album, Viento a Favor. [...] "Listen", a theme song from Dreamgirls, in which Beyoncé appears, was re-recorded under the title [...] "Oye". The EP's title track is a Spanish version of [...] "Irreplaceable", a song that was highly successful in its English recording. Three recordings of [...] "Beautiful Liar" [...] appear on Irreemplazable: a Spanish version (titled [...] "Bello Embustero"), a remixed English version and a Spanglish version. A norteña remix of [...] "Irreemplazable" [...] is the EP's seventh track, while Timbaland's remix of [...] "Get Me Bodied", which features vocals from Voltio, closes Irreemplazable.|$|E

2500|$|I {{think the}} {{decision}} {{will have no}} impact on people's right to privacy, because I don't regard truthful information in court records published by court order in a newspaper to be private information. If anything, the decision is likely to simply muddle the interesting philosophical questions {{and make it more}} difficult to make real progress on privacy issues. In the case of truthful, non-defamatory information obtained legally, I think there is no possibility of any defensible [...] "right" [...] to censor what other people <b>are</b> <b>saying.</b> <b>It</b> is important to avoid language like [...] "data" [...] because we aren't talking about [...] "data"—we are talking about the suppression of knowledge.|$|E
2500|$|Mississauga mayor Hazel McCallion {{initially}} expressed pessimism over Miller's 'One-cent now' campaign, {{stating that}} [...] "I {{can assure you}} our citizens [...] can’t point out to us where there’s a lot of waste. Toronto, unfortunately, has that situation, in which their citizens <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>it,</b> {{as well as their}} board of trade has been saying it and even their own councillors are saying it". Denzil Minnan-Wong compared the two mayors, saying [...] "Hazel McCallion runs a tight ship. David Miller’s ship has leaks all over the place,” and some commentators suggested that Toronto would have a difficult time making a credible case to the federal government for funding. She unveiled her own plan known as 'Cities Now!' to get federal funding for municipal infrastructure. However, McCallion's proposal did not receive support during a meeting with fifteen regional mayors, and she agreed to support Miller's campaign.|$|E

60|$|If Amy {{makes any}} reply the words arrive {{upside-down}} and are unintelligible. The maid announces Miss Dunbar. Then Amy rises, brings {{her head to}} the position in which they are usually carried; and she and Ginevra look into each other's eyes. They always do this when they meet, though they meet several times a day, and it is worth doing, for what they see in those pellucid pools is love eternal. Thus they loved at school (in their last two terms), and thus they will love till the grave encloses them. These thoughts, and others even more beautiful, are in their minds as they gaze at each other now. No man {{will ever be able to}} say 'Amy,' or to say 'Ginevra,' with such a trill as they <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

And I never went bare-legged in church in my toughest days. I'd never have thought of doing such a thing. But that hateful old Kitty Alec says Faith has never been the same girl since that time I stayed in the manse. She says Cornelia Elliott will live to rue the day she took me in. It hurts my feelings, I tell you. But it's Mr. Meredith I'm really worried over." ...|$|E

5000|$|Conservative {{commentator}} Charles Krauthammer {{brought the}} term up {{in a discussion}} about President Obama on the show Fox News All-Stars in June 2010, saying: What we see here is conditional truthiness.

60|$|Doubtless {{there is}} an overruling Providence in this matter which we may not {{distrust}} without accusing the order which has not yet failed in the due succession of the seasons and the days and nights. While we <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>it</b> {{is never going to}} rain, it rains; or when it seems as if nature were finally frozen up, a thaw begins; when we feel that the dark will not end, the dawn is already streaking the east. If the preacher thinks that the old texts are no longer applicable to life, there is suddenly reported an outbreak of vice in the city which puts him in mind of Sodom and Gomorrah; or the opportune flight of a defaulter furnishes material for a homily which searches the consciences of half the congregation with the words of the commandment against stealing. The journalist wakes in heavy-eyed despair, but he finds from the papers on his breakfast-table {{that there has been a}} revolution in South America, or that the Socialists have been doing something in Belgium almost too bad even for Socialists as the capitalists imagine them, and his heart rises again. Even the poor magazine essayist, who has lived through the long month in dread of the hour when his copy shall be due, is not forbidden his reprieve. He may not have anything to say, but he certainly has something to say it about. The world is always as interesting to-day as it was yesterday, and probably to-morrow will not be so dull as it promises.|$|E

5000|$|Former Pitcairn {{resident}} Shawn Christian, 29, then {{living in}} Australia, announced a legal {{challenge to the}} validity of New Zealand lawyers’ and judges’ carrying out a trial in a British colony on 27 November 2005.

5000|$|A war {{of words}} was waged between the two fighters prior to the fight, Arthur had stirred up the {{animosity}} between the pair stating {{in an interview that}} Gomez [...] "gets involved in wars with journeymen" [...] and that [...] "looking deep into Gomez's eyes at the press conference, I'm not sure even he believes he can win.

The English-speaking press, very nobly, said: 'We don't care whether you <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>it</b> right or wrong, mate, your feelings are actually {{what we want to}} know about.' And I think, in football, one needs to have feelings, otherwise, if one just philosophizes, one will never go further. Because of this, at that time, I risked myself.

5000|$|The Markham {{government}} is now suggesting to rename Highway 7 as [...] "Avenue 7", {{saying that this}} would help the road to sound more [...] "urban". The Markham council is presenting this idea to the York Region government, {{as well as the}} Richmond Hill and Vaughan councils. Some objecting voices <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>it</b> would be too confusing, or the name [...] "Avenue 7" [...] would not make sense because the main route south of Highway 7 is named as [...] "14th Avenue", and the main route north of Highway 7 is named as [...] "16th Avenue", and thus Highway 7 should be named as [...] "15th Avenue". However, as any proposed name is expected to be applied along the entire road across the region, that designation would be problematic due to Highway 7 shifting southward to the west in Vaughan to follow the same baseline as 14th Avenue.|$|E
