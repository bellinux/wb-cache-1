50|$|Many {{sovereign}} states have provisions for conventions besides their permanent legislature.

This process has never occurred, save for the original drafting of the constitution, although it almost happened in several cases. The US Constitution also has provisions for constitutional amendments {{to be approved by}} state conventions of the people.

50|$|In the Bhisho High Court on 11 July, EE, {{represented}} by the LRC, obtained an order-by-consent compelling Minister Motshekga to publish an <b>amended</b> <b>draft</b> norms and standards for school infrastructure. The order set the date of publication for public comment as 12 September 2013, {{and said that the}} norms had to be finalised and promulgated into law by 30 November 2013.When Minister Motshekga published her second draft on 12 September, EE welcomed it as a much improved version of the previous draft norms and standards released in January. Not only did it include considerably more detail, but it also had built-in timeframes and accountability measures, which the earlier draft did not. For EE, however, there were some concerns. Although significantly improved, the timeframes did not reflect the urgency of the problem. The draft stated that water, electricity, toilets and fencing should be provided within 10 years, and all other norms, including libraries, laboratories and sports fields, by 2030. EE held a second round of public hearings in Limpopo, KwaZulu-Natal, the Eastern Cape, Gauteng and the Western Cape in late September and early October. Learners and parents spoke out against the long time frames in the new draft. It was felt that the schools suffering under the worst conditions, such as most of those visited during the Eastern Cape Solidarity Visit, could not be expected to wait 10 years for assistance.Another key concern was that of accountability. In accordance with Section 58C of the Schools Act, the draft stipulated that, six months after the norms were finalised and adopted, provincial MECs would be required to submit a plan to the Minister on how they would ensure implementation. Following this, they would also need to report to the Minister annually on their progress. While EE welcomed these stipulations, it was widely felt that these plans and annual reports should also be made available to the public, who could thereby monitor the progress and hold the provincial governments to account. In addition, EE insisted that the DBE and the provincial education departments should accept overarching responsibility for the implementation of these norms without, as had been done in the draft, making delivery contingent on the cooperation of other government departments.On 11 October, EE and the Equal Education Law Centre (EELC) made a joint submission on the DBE’s draft Minimum Norms and Standards for School Infrastructure, raising these concerns about its timeframes and accountability measures. The submission drew together the comments of hundreds of learners and parents who participated in public workshops which EE hosted during September and October throughout the country.|$|E
40|$|This article {{proposes that}} the European Union (EU) should {{consider}} re-introducing the Passenger Name Record Directive from 2011. The Directive {{did not get}} through the legislative process due to concerns over how it would cultivate a surveillance society and fail to adequately protect data protection along with an individual’s privacy. In relation to terrorist activity, events have moved on since 2011 posing an increased threat {{to the national security}} of EU Member States, in particular the rise of the terrorist group Islamic State. By examining the current terrorist threat the EU faces, this paper argues that a different version of the 2011 directive on Passenger Name Records should be introduced in a form that does not compromise the EU’s commitment to data protection and rights to privacy of EU citizens. Following the terrorist attacks in Paris in January 2015, European Parliament MEP’s have already heard proposals for an <b>amended</b> <b>draft</b> of the Passenger Name Records Directive be introduced. The proposal in this article challenges the content of that draft by recommending that a new Directive applies solely to terrorism investigations allowing only a very short, limited period of retention of the data by national security and a counter-terrorism policing agencies. To prevent data mining, it is recommended that the information contained in passenger name records is checked only against terrorist suspects already on intelligence systems...|$|E
40|$|In {{the winter}} of 1890 - 1891, Robert Bond, the Colonial Secretary of Newfoundland, {{attempted}} to negotiate a reciprocal trade agreement with James G. Blaine, the American Secretary of State. Although Blaine accepted an <b>amended</b> <b>draft</b> treaty, the Imperial Government, in London, withheld ratification from the proposed treaty when it received a series of protests from the Canadian Government through its High Commissioner in London. [...] In {{order to understand the}} significance of these negotiations, it was necessary to provide the background to both the problems of the Newfoundland economy and fishery, as well as to describe the various attempts to achieve a permanent settlement of the North West Atlantic Fisheries Question. The fishery was the basis of Newfoundland's export trade in 1890, and any reciprocity treaty would have been designed to increase Newfoundland fish exports to the United States. [...] The negotiation of a reciprocity treaty between a British colony and a foreign country was conducted through the British Minister in the foreign capital. In addition, the power to permit these negotiations and their ratification rested in London. The Imperial Government refused to ratify the Convention because of the objections of the Canadian Government. Therefore, a large portion of this study was given over to a discussion of how the relations between the various members of the British Empire - Newfoundland, Canada and Great Britain - affected the Bond-Blaine negotiations. Although this discussion of reciprocity has been broadened to encompass an analysis of Bond's and Blaine's motives for commencing the talks, the basic problem remained - whether Newfoundland should be allowed to negotiate bilaterally with the United States or in concert with Canada as an Imperial unit...|$|E

[...] It also established free, secular education for all. However, anti-clerical laws nationalized Church properties and required the Church to pay rent {{for the use}} of properties which it had previously owned. In addition, the government forbade public manifestations of Catholicism such as processions on religious feast days, banished the crucifix from schools; the Jesuits were expelled. Catholic schools continued, but outside the state system, and in 1933 further legislation banned all monks and nuns from teaching.|$|R

50|$|However, {{substantial}} amendments were nonetheless made to this draft {{prior to}} a referendum in 2005, resulting in a split in the then ruling coalition. The Liberal Democratic Party faction of the government, led by Raila Odinga, and supported by KANU led a successful 'No' vote against the <b>amended</b> Bomas <b>Draft</b> (called the Wako draft after the alleged mastermind of the changes).

5000|$|The Act {{allows the}} {{insertion}} of arbitration clauses, which require the parties to submit to specific arbitration procedures {{in the event of}} disputes. The Law Commission initially excluded arbitration clauses from the Act, but later <b>amended</b> their <b>draft</b> bill so as to allow third parties to take advantage of arbitration proceedings. The provisions on arbitration clauses were not received well during the bill's passage through Parliament, and were described as [...] "very messy", [...] "a labyrinth" [...] and [...] "a mire". The Commission initially proposed that jurisdiction clauses be specifically excluded from the Act. During the bill's passage through Parliament, however, this exclusion disappeared, and the Act's explanatory notes assume that the Act covers jurisdiction clauses.|$|R
30|$|After civil {{servants}} consult political superiors in their ministry and <b>amend</b> the <b>draft</b> accordingly, the draft bill enters the official consultation phase (Begutachtungsverfahren), in which other ministries, provincial governments, social partners and other potentially affected organized interest groups, and sometimes—because of particular expertise—individuals, are officially invited {{to comment on}} the draft bill. Civil servants then collect and analyse these comments. The draft bill is changed—often only marginally, but sometimes even substantially—before it enters the Council of Ministers. It has to be unanimously approved there to become a governmental bill, which is then sent to Parliament. During the ensuing parliamentary process, it is the central goal of the ministry in charge to get the law through Parliament “undamaged” (Griessler and Lehner 2010 : 130).|$|R

The 170th General Assembly in 1958 authorized a committee to develop a brief contemporary statement of faith. The 177th General Assembly in 1965 considered and <b>amended</b> the <b>draft</b> confession and sent a revised version for general discussion within the church. The 178th General Assembly in 1966 accepted a revised draft and sent it to presbyteries throughout the church for final ratification. As the confession was ratified by more than 90% of all presbyteries, the 178th General Assembly finally adopted it in 1967. The UPCUSA also adopted a Book of Confessions in 1967, which would include the Confession of 1967, the Westminster Confession and Shorter Catechism, the Heidelberg Catechism, the Second Helvetic and Scots Confessions and the Barmen Declaration.|$|R
