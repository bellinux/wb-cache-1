5|$|Alpha Trianguli Australis, {{known as}} Atria, is a second-magnitude orange giant <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> {{star in the}} constellation, {{as well as the}} 42nd-brightest star in the night sky. Completing the {{triangle}} are the two white main sequence stars Beta and Gamma Trianguli Australis. Although the constellation lies in the Milky Way and contains many stars, deep-sky objects are not prominent. Notable features include the open cluster NGC 6025 and planetary nebula NGC 5979.|$|E
5|$|The revolt {{was led by}} 28-year-old Lieutenant Colonel Vương Văn Đông, a northerner, who {{had fought}} with the French Union forces against the Viet Minh during the First Indochina War. Later trained at Fort Leavenworth in the United States, Đông was {{regarded}} by American military advisers as a brilliant tactician <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> military prospect of his generation and {{he served in the}} Airborne Division. Back in Vietnam, Đông became discontented with Diệm's arbitrary rule and constant meddling {{in the internal affairs of}} the army. Diệm promoted officers on loyalty rather than skill, and played senior officers against one another in order to weaken the military leadership and prevent them from challenging his rule. Years after the coup, Đông asserted that his sole objective was to force Diệm to improve the governance of the country. Đông was clandestinely supported by his brother-in-law Lieutenant Colonel Nguyen Trieu Hong, the director of training at the Joint General Staff School, and Hong's uncle Hoang Co Thuy. Thuy was a wealthy Saigon-based lawyer, and had been a political activist since World War II. He was the secretary-general of a minority opposition party called the Movement of Struggle for Freedom, which had a small presence in the rubber-stamp National Assembly.|$|E

25|$|The {{easiest way}} to locate the {{constellation}} is to find its two brightest stars Castor and Pollux eastward from the familiar “V” shaped asterism of Taurus and the three stars of Orion’s belt. Another way is to mentally draw {{a line from the}} Pleiades star cluster located in Taurus <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> star in Leo, Regulus. In doing so, you are drawing an imaginary line that is relatively close to the ecliptic, a line which intersects Gemini roughly at the midpoint of the constellation, just below Castor and Pollux.|$|E

25|$|Just {{two years}} later, {{in the wake}} of an {{economic}} crisis, not one of the privately owned English newspapers had survived. The party established its own English-language paper, The National Socialist, in May 1878 but managed to keep the publication alive only one year. The year 1878 saw the establishment of a more enduring newspaper: the German-language New Yorker Volkszeitung (New York People's News). The Volkszeitung included material by the best <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> of the German-American socialist movement, including Alexander Jonas, Adolph Douai, and Sergei Shevitch, and Herman Schlüter and quickly emerged as the leading voice of the SLP during the last decades of the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|At {{magnitude}} 2.2, Alpha Cassiopeiae, or Schedar, {{is generally}} {{the brightest star}} in Cassiopeia, though is often shaded by Gamma Cassiopeiae, which has brightened to magnitude 1.6 on occasion. The constellation hosts some of the most luminous stars known, including the yellow hypergiants Rho Cassiopeiae and V509 Cassiopeiae and white hypergiant 6 Cassiopeiae. The semiregular variable PZ Cassiopeiae {{is one of the largest}} known stars. In 1572, Tycho Brahe's supernova flared brightly in Cassiopeia. Cassiopeia A is a supernova remnant <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> extrasolar radio source in the sky at frequencies above 1GHz. Fourteen star systems have been found to have exoplanets, one of which—HR 8832—is thought to host seven planets. A rich section of the Milky Way runs through Cassiopeia, containing a number of open clusters, young luminous galactic disc stars, and nebulae. IC 10 is an irregular galaxy that is the closest known starburst galaxy and the only one in the Local Group of galaxies.|$|E

In the manga, Yaginuma includes many references to historical events related {{to the development of}} human spaceflight as well as literary works such as Kenji Miyazawa's novel Night on the Galactic Railroad. American publishing company Vertical announced acquisition of the manga's license for English-language translation at the New York Anime Festival in September 2009, and the translated first volume was published in May 2010. The series was described by Vertical marketing director Ed Chavez as [...] "technically sound" [...] and [...] "heartfelt" [...] during its initial assessment.|$|E

500|$|Sirius ( [...] , a romanization of Greek , Seirios, [...]"glowing" [...] or [...] "scorching") is a {{star system}} <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> star in the Earth's night sky. With a visual {{apparent}} magnitude of −1.46, it is almost twice as bright as Canopus, the next brightest star. The system has the Bayer designation Alpha Canis Majoris (α CMa). What the naked eye perceives as a single star is a binary star system, consisting of a white main-sequence star of spectral type A0 or A1, termed Sirius A, and a faint white dwarf companion of spectral type DA2, called Sirius B. The distance separating Sirius A from its companion varies between 8.2 and 31.5 AU.|$|E
500|$|Polaris, the {{brightest}} star in the constellation, is a yellow-white supergiant <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> Cepheid variable star in the night sky, ranging from an apparent magnitude of 1.97 to 2.00. Beta Ursae Minoris, also known as Kochab, is an aging star that has swollen and cooled to become an orange giant with an apparent magnitude of 2.08, only slightly fainter than Polaris. Kochab and magnitude 3 Gamma Ursae Minoris have been called the [...] "guardians of the pole star". Planets have been detected orbiting four of the stars, including Kochab. The constellation also contains an isolated neutron star—Calvera—and H1504+65, the hottest white dwarf yet discovered, with a surface temperature of 200,000 K.|$|E
500|$|In March 2010, {{the case}} was finally heard by a jury.

Jones denied any discrimination against white employees. He testified that [...] "I wanted the best <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>brightest.</b> That meant blacks, whites, Asians, Latinos, Republicans, Democrats, Independents, gay, straight, anybody who wanted to work for DeKalb County. I wanted everybody to have a seat at the table". Other testimony revealed that during {{the first five years of}} Jones' term in office, the number of white senior county managers had dropped from 61 to 57, and the number of African-American senior county managers had risen from 33 to 61.|$|E

500|$|Canis Major {{contains}} Sirius, {{the brightest}} star in the night sky, known as the [...] "dog star". It is bright because of its proximity to the Solar System. In contrast, the other bright stars of the constellation are stars of great distance and high luminosity. At magnitude 1.5, Epsilon Canis Majoris (Adhara) is the second-brightest star of the constellation <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> source of extreme ultraviolet radiation in the night sky. Next in brightness are the yellow-white supergiant Delta (Wezen) at 1.8, the blue-white giant Beta (Mirzam) at 2.0, blue-white supergiants Eta (Aludra) at 2.4 and Omicron1 at 3.0, and white spectroscopic binary Zeta (Furud), also at 3.0. The red hypergiant VY Canis Majoris {{is one of the largest}} stars known, while the neutron star RX J0720.4-3125 has a radius of a mere 5km.|$|E
500|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} in Radio Slobodna Evropa, Ljupcho Jolevski called the album [...] "magical and multilayered... an accomplishment which has an instant likability, but which you discover with each next listen". Jolevski praised the team responsible for the arrangement and the instrumentation for their efforts to give their best in the album's songs. He described the sound of Makedonsko Devojče 2 as a mixture of Macedonian folklore and the [...] "ocean of worldwide sounds". According to Jolevski, the album elevates to an [...] "amazing collection of songs which defy the ugliness of rhythms and simple lyrics which we are splashed with on a daily basis". At the end of his article, Jolevski concluded that Gočeva has reached her musical zenith <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> point of her career with the album characteristic of her hometown, Bitola. He concluded that the album [...] "brings the sounds and customs of the Old Bazaar of Bitola, the city that even nowadays somehow resists the turbo-attacks from all sides".|$|E
