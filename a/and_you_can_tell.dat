25|$|Sago Road, {{where the}} mine is, follows the Buckhannon River {{and a set}} of {{railroad}} tracks. When you arrive just outside the Sago Baptist church, where relatives and friends of the miners have gathered, you see cars. Everywhere, lining the roads, in people's yards, there are cars {{as far as you can}} see. Then, you see satellite trucks and TV crews and reporters and photographers. They're also everywhere <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> our presence, just under 24 hours at the time, is taking a toll on the small town and the little area we've taken over.|$|E
500|$|Robert Kirkman {{claimed that}} he had {{considered}} {{the idea of a}} television series, but never actively pursued it. When Darabont became interested, Kirkman called it [...] "extremely flattering" [...] and {{went on to say that}} [...] "he definitely cares about the original source material, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> that in the way he's adapting it." [...] In his interview, Kirkman exclaimed that it was [...] "an extreme validation of the work", and continued by expressing that [...] "never in a million years could [...] have thought that if Walking Dead were to ever be adapted that everything would be going this well." ...|$|E
500|$|James {{had several}} unique {{experiences}} while {{living with the}} Smith family in Nauvoo. She recorded that often, as she went about doing the washing and cleaning for the Smiths, either Emma (Joseph's wife) or Lucy (Joseph's mother) would stop her and talk with her. One day while James was in Joseph's mother's room, the woman told her to [...] "bring me that bundle from the bureau and sit down here." [...] According to Jane, she was shown the Urim and Thummim, the tools used by Joseph Smith to translate the Book of Mormon. Lucy then said to her, [...] "You will live long after I am dead and gone <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> the Latter-day Saints that you was permitted to handle the Urim and Thummim". Another time, Emma asked James if {{she would like to}} be adopted by and sealed to her and Joseph. Not understanding at the time, James said nothing. Emma encouraged her to think about it. Two weeks later, she asked James again, at which time she said [...] "no m'am". James would say later that she did not understand what that meant, or she would have taken the couple up on their offer. This early decision {{had a significant impact on}} James' later life as a member of the Latter Day Saint church.|$|E

2500|$|Stewart also {{fired back}} at Joe Scarborough by telling Cramer to relay {{the message that}} the nature of The Daily Shows satire is not to be fair. In addition, Stewart apologized to Cramer for the {{personalized}} nature of the media coverage by saying, [...] "You now have become the face of this, and that is incredibly unfortunate. Because you're not the face of it, you shouldn't be the face of it. You were the person that was, uh, I-don't-know-what enough to stand up and go, 'Hey, that wasn't fair!' Which it's not, because this show isn't fair, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> 'Doucheborough' it isn't supposed to be fair." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Nacirema Dream was {{met with}} {{generally}} positive reviews from music critics. Reed Jackson of XXL praised his storytelling, colorful metaphors and overtly complex word play. He also said, [...] "The production is so outdated you can’t help but think that these songs have literally just been sitting around this whole time. But ultimately, The Nacirema Dream should be celebrated – not only for it’s long overdue release, but because Papoose actually made the album he had always planned on making." [...] Logan Smithson of PopMatters gave the album a seven out of ten, saying [...] "The Nacirema Dream {{is a prime example}} of how hip-hop can serve as a platform for storytelling. Papoose confirms that the hype around his lyrical prowess was real. However, the album isn’t without its faults. Coming out seven years behind schedule, the production is noticeably a little dated. [...] While the beats are solid, The Nacirema Dream isn’t an album that you’ll be listening to because you want to hear great production. It also could have benefited from being slightly trimmed. Listeners might feel fatigued while sitting through the 75 minutes that this album has to offer. Regardless, The Nacirema Dream is an admirable achievement. Papoose fought through label issues and made the album that he wanted to make, even if it took him seven years to finally get that album out to the public." [...] Del F. Cowie of Exclaim! gave the album a six out of ten, saying [...] "Papoose gamely battles on, delivering some of his trademark punch lines, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> he genuinely attempted to deliver a well-rounded record. However, there's not enough innovation to interest casual fans in the project." ...|$|E
