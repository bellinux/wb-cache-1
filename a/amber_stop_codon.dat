Specific orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (o-aaRS) /amber suppressor tRNA CUA pairs (o-pairs) for the incorporation of ncAAs in S. cerevisiae were previously selected from an E. coli tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNACUA mutant library. Incorporation fidelity relies on the specificity of the o-aaRSs for their ncAAs and the ability to effectively discriminate against their natural substrate Tyr or any other canonical amino acid. Methodology/Principal Findings: We used o-pairs previously developed for ncAAs carrying reactive alkyne-, azido-, or photocrosslinker side chains to suppress an amber mutant of human superoxide dismutase 1 in S. cerevisiae. We found worse incorporation efficiencies of the alkyne- and the photocrosslinker ncAAs than reported earlier. In our hands, amber suppression with the ncAA containing the azido group did not occur at all. In addition to the incorporation experiments in S. cerevisiae, we analyzed the catalytic properties of the o-aaRSs in vitro. Surprisingly, all o-aaRSs showed much higher preference for their natural substrate Tyr than for any of the tested ncAAs. While it is unclear why efficiently recognized Tyr is not inserted at amber codons, we speculate that metabolically inert ncAAs accumulate in the cell, and for this reason they are incorporated despite being weak substrates for the o-aaRSs.

We recently described a conditional mutation system in Escherichia coli that uses a plasmid to produce an amber suppressor tRNA regulated by the arabinose promoter. This suppressor was used here in the construction of amber mutations in seven essential E. coli genes. <b>Amber</b> <b>stop</b> <b>codons</b> were introduced as “tagalong” mutations in the flanking DNA of a downstream antibiotic resistance marker by lambda red recombination.

We were unable to isolate an amber mutation in ftsZ. Kinetics of cell death and morphological changes were measured following removal of arabinose. As expected given the wide range of cellular mechanisms represented, different mutants showed widely different death curves. All of the mutations were bactericidal except the mutation in gcpE, which was bacteriostatic. The strain carrying an amber mutation in murA was by far the most sensitive, showing rapid killing in nonpermissive medium.

Moreover, a variety of bioorthogonal reactions to covalently modify proteins was illustrated. Applications of site-selective protein modifications were briefly introduced with referenced reviews. ^ In chapter 2, styrene derived unnatural amino acid (KStyr) was site-specifically incorporated into proteins and displayed highly bioorthogonal reactivity with tetrazine and tetrazole. New fluorophores were formed in both reactions, which enabled KStyr to be a versatile fluorogenic chemical reporter for site-selective protein labeling. Protein labelings in vitro and in vivo were successfully demonstrated. ^ In chapter 3, vinyl sulfide unnatural amino acid (EVSI) as an oxidative stress-masked electrophilic unnatural amino acid was designed for a proximity-enhanced protein-protein crosslinking. Introducing EVSI at interaction surface of GST proteins allowed for a covalent bond formation with its proximal nucleophilic residue on the interacting GST after oxidation. ^ In chapter 4, a photo-enhanced oxidative coupling for bioorthogonal ligation was disclosed by a means of protein-based fluorescent screening. Quinone methide intermediates initiated by ferricyanide displayed high selective reactivity with HOMO-promoted dienophile over cysteine. The reaction rate was dramatically increased by photo-irradiation and enabled site-selective protein labeling in cell lysate within short time. ^ In chapter 5, a vinyl protected tyrosine (ViP) was designed and selectively incorporated at Tyr 66 of sfGFP and cpsfGFP to turn off their fluorescence. Oxymercuration of vinyl ether was capable of removing protective vinyl group and recovered wild type sfGFP and cpsfGFP.

Phaberge is a helper phage with an <b>amber</b> <b>stop</b> <b>codon</b> in pIII gene, therefore non-SupE E. coli strains reduce the amount of non-fused pIII production and most is provided for phage assembly by the phagemid containing the pIII fused protein. To test if Phaberge increases the level of Cry 1 Ac-pIII incorporated to the capsid, we used the non-SupE E. coli HB 2151 strain housing the pCADS-Cry 1 Ac vector and M 13 phage were produced. Western-blot analysis of the viral particles showed more than two fold increased production of Cry 1 Ac-pIII protein compared with the same construct using M 13 phage (Fig.  2 a, lanes 3 and 4).|$|E
40|$|Abstract De novo {{origin of}} coding {{sequence}} remains an obscure issue in molecular evolution. One {{of the possible}} paths for addition (subtraction) of DNA segments to (from) a gene is <b>stop</b> <b>codon</b> shift. Single nucleotide substitutions can destroy the existing <b>stop</b> <b>codon,</b> leading to uninterrupted translation up to the next <b>stop</b> <b>codon</b> in the gene’s reading frame, or create a premature <b>stop</b> <b>codon</b> via a nonsense mutation. Furthermore, short indels-caused frameshifts near gene’s end may lead to premature <b>stop</b> <b>codons</b> or to translation past the existing <b>stop</b> <b>codon.</b> Here, we describe {{the evolution of the}} length of coding sequence of prokaryotic genes by change of positions of <b>stop</b> <b>codons.</b> We observed cases of addition of regions of 30 UTR to genes due to mutations at the existing <b>stop</b> <b>codon,</b> and cases of subtraction of C-terminal coding segments due to nonsense mutations upstream of the <b>stop</b> <b>codon.</b> Many of the observed <b>stop</b> <b>codon</b> shifts cannot be attributed to sequencing errors or rare deleterious variants segregating within bacteria...|$|R
40|$|This {{study shows}} that a {{statistical}} excess of <b>stop</b> <b>codons</b> has evolved at the third codon downstream of the real <b>stop</b> <b>codon</b> UAA in yeasts. Comparative analysis indicates that <b>stop</b> <b>codons</b> at this location are considerably more conserved than sense codons, suggesting that these tandem <b>stop</b> <b>codons</b> are maintained by selection...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Stop</b> <b>codon</b> {{suppression}} or {{translational readthrough}} occurs when in translation a <b>stop</b> <b>codon</b> is {{interpreted as a}} sense codon, that is, when a (standard) amino acid is 'encoded' by the <b>stop</b> <b>codon.</b> Mutated tRNAs can {{be the cause of}} readthrough, but also certain nucleotide motifs close to the <b>stop</b> <b>codon.</b> Translational readthrough is very common in viruses and bacteria, and has also been found as a gene regulatory principle in humans, yeasts, bacteria and drosophila. This kind of endogenous translational readthough constitutes a variation of the genetic code, because a <b>stop</b> <b>codon</b> codes for an amino acid. In the case of human malate dehydrogenase, the <b>stop</b> <b>codon</b> is read through with a frequency of about 4%. Amino acids inserted at the <b>stop</b> <b>codon</b> depends of the identity of the <b>stop</b> <b>codon</b> itself: Gln, Tyr and Lys; have been found for UAA and UAG codon, while Cys, Trp, Arg for UGA codon have been identified by mass spectrometry ...|$|R
