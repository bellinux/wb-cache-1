5|$|Klaipėda (German: Memel), an {{important}} seaport in East Prussia, was detached from Germany by Article 28 of the Treaty of Versailles and was {{governed by the}} Allies according to Article 99. France assumed administration of the region while Lithuania continued to lobby for its control, claiming that it should belong to Lithuania as it had a significant Lithuanian population (see Lithuania Minor) and was that country's only access to the Baltic Sea. Poland also laid claim to the territory. As the Allies were hesitant {{to make a decision}} <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>that</b> the region would remain a free state much like the Free City of Danzig, Lithuania took the initiative and organized the Klaipėda Revolt in January 1923. Soviet Russia and Germany supported the action. The region, as an autonomous territory with its own parliament (Klaipėda Parliament), was attached to Lithuania. The region covered about 2,400km² and had a population of approximately 140,000.|$|E
5|$|Charles V {{ascended the}} thrones of both Spain and the Holy Roman Empire {{following}} {{the deaths of}} his grandfathers, Ferdinand in 1516 and Maximilian in 1519. Francis I likewise became king of France upon the death of Louis in 1515, leaving three relatively young rulers and {{an opportunity for a}} clean slate. The careful diplomacy of Cardinal Thomas Wolsey had resulted in the Treaty of London in 1518, aimed at uniting the kingdoms of western Europe {{in the wake of a}} new Ottoman threat, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>that</b> peace might be secured. Henry met Francis I on 7 June 1520 at the Field of the Cloth of Gold near Calais for a fortnight of lavish entertainment. Both hoped for friendly relations in place of the wars of the previous decade. The strong air of competition laid to rest any hopes of a renewal of the Treaty of London, however, and conflict was inevitable. Henry had more in common with Charles, whom he met once before and once after Francis. Charles brought the Empire into war with France in 1521; Henry offered to mediate, but little was achieved and by the end of the year Henry had aligned England with Charles. He still clung to his previous aim of restoring English lands in France, but also sought to secure an alliance with Burgundy, then part of Charles' realm, and the continued support of Charles. A small English attack in the north of France made up little ground. Charles defeated and captured Francis at Pavia and could dictate peace; but he believed he owed Henry nothing. Sensing this, Henry decided to take England out of the war before his ally, signing the Treaty of the More on 30 August 1525.|$|E

25|$|Then, on 8 December 1940, Operation Compass began. Planned as an {{extended}} raid, {{a force of}} British, Indian and Australian troops succeeded in cutting off the Italian troops. Pressing their advantage home, General Richard O'Connor pressed the attack forwards and succeeded in reaching El Agheila (an advance of 500 miles), capturing {{tens of thousands of}} enemy troops. The Italian army was virtually destroyed, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>that</b> the Italians would be swept out of Libya. However, at the crucial moment, Winston Churchill ordered that the advance be stopped and troops dispatched to defend Greece. Weeks later the first German troops were arriving in North Africa to reinforce the Italians.|$|E
25|$|Simpson was {{out without}} {{addition}} next morning. After Benaud and Mackay had added 60, Gibbs took a hat-trick with the score on 281, dismissing Mackay for 29 and Grout and Misson for ducks. Australia were now 281-8, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>that</b> West Indies {{would have a}} first innings lead of close to one hundred. However Hoare, in {{what was to be}} his only Test, helped Benaud to add 85 before he was out for 35, (Hoare had replaced the injured Davidson, whose bowling was badly missed.) Benaud quickly followed for 77, but the deficit had been reduced to 27. By the end of the day's play, West Indies had reached 150-1 in their second innings, with Hunte on 44 not out and Kanhai on 59 not out.|$|E
25|$|Politically, {{the kingdom}} was {{evolving}} {{into a major}} European power, through the youthful and energetic kingship of Edward III. In 1346, the English had won a decisive battle over the Scots at the Battle of Neville's Cross, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>that</b> Edward III would realise his grandfather Edward I's ambition of bringing the Scots under the suzerainty of the English crown. The English were also experiencing military success on the continent. Less than {{two months before the}} Battle of Neville's Cross, a numerically inferior English army led by the king himself won a spectacular victory over the French royal forces at the Battle of Crécy. The victory was immediately followed by Edward laying siege to the port city of Calais. When the city fell the next year, this provided the English with a strategically important enclave that would remain in their possession for over two centuries.|$|E

25|$|While the 1960s did {{result in}} some trophies and good Serie A {{finishes}} for Fiorentina, nobody {{believed that the}} club could challenge for the title. The 1968–69 season started with Milan as frontrunners, but on matchday 7, they lost to Bologna and were overtaken by Gigi Riva's Cagliari. Fiorentina, after an unimpressive start, then moved {{to the top of}} the Serie A, but the first half of their season finished with a 2–2 draw against Varese, leaving Cagliari as outright league leader. The second half of the season was a three-way battle between the three contending teams, Milan, Cagliari and Fiorentina. Milan fell away, instead focusing their efforts on the European Cup, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>that</b> Cagliari would retain top spot. After Cagliari lost against Juventus, however, Fiorentina took over at the top. The team then won all of their remaining matches, beating rivals Juve in Turin on the penultimate matchday to seal their second, and last, national title. In the European Cup competition the following year, Fiorentina had some good results, including a win in the Soviet Union against Dynamo Kyiv, but they were eventually knocked out in the quarter-finals after a 3–0 defeat in Glasgow to Celtic.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, Melbourne {{plunged into}} a new crisis, winning only five games for the year and posting a $1 million loss. President Gabriel Szondy {{resigned}} <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>that</b> Daniher's tenure as coach was under threat. But, continuing the recent trend, in 2004, Melbourne climbed the ladder again, winning 14 games and leading the competition, albeit for one round only, in Round 18; from there, the club lost five matches in a row, including the elimination final, to finish seventh. During the 2004 post-season, the Demons tragically lost defender Troy Broadbridge in the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami, when he was swept off Phi Phi island in Thailand. He was walking along the beach with his wife Trisha when the tsunami struck. His body was found on 3 January 2005, and brought home. A funeral was held on 20 January 2005 in recognition to the No. 20 guernsey he wore during his playing days. During the 2005 off-season, the whole team travelled to the island in which Broadbridge was killed {{to build a new}} school for those struck by the tsunami. The No.20 jumper was then rested for two years.|$|E

[...] He met with Ouro Preto, and undertook to personally present the Emperor {{with a list}} of the names of those to be included in a new cabinet. To the disillusionment of civilian and military republicans, Deodoro did not proclaim a republic, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>that</b> he would only topple the cabinet. He was unsure whether he wanted to act against Pedro II, and the rebels themselves did not believe the coup would succeed.

500|$|In January 2006, Minor {{selected}} the University of Michigan. [...] Although {{he did not}} enroll in the 2006 Summer semester, he reported to Michigan on June 16 for strength and conditioning training. [...] Minor and fellow freshman Carlos Brown were behind three returning running backs (Mike Hart, Kevin Grady and senior Jerome Jackson) [...] on the depth chart entering the season. [...] Minor was considered the less heralded than Brown, who was regarded as the fastest player on the team. [...] On opening day, only Hart and Grady had more carries than Minor, in part because Jackson, who entered his senior season with 505 career rushing yards, did not dress. [...] In his first carry as a Wolverine, he rushed for 24 yards against the Vanderbilt Commodores during the September 2 season opening game. [...] Nonetheless, the depth chart was not very clear behind Hart. [...] By late September, Minor was clearly third on the depth chart <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>that</b> Brown might be redshirted. When Hart left the game due to injury against Michigan State on October 7, Minor scored his first touchdown on a 40-yard run. [...] He had his first 100-yard game on November 4, when he rushed for 108yards on 12carries, including a 40-yard touchdown run in a 3426 win against Ball State. [...] As a true freshman member of the 2006 Michigan Wolverines football team, Minor rushed {{for a total of}} 238yards on 42carries, which was second on the team to Hart.|$|E
500|$|Harris was {{followed}} into the witness-box by {{a succession of}} landladies, waitresses and other women, all of whom confirmed Davidson's habitual pestering without making any serious accusation of misconduct. [...] When Davidson himself took to the stand, on 25 May, his light-hearted, even flippant, manner created, says Tucker, [...] "the flavour of a comedy routine with the rector's counsel as straight man". Davidson's disastrous finances were aired—he took great offence when his association with Gordon was presented as a [...] "partnership in crime". [...] He caused disbelief and amusement in the court when, questioned about the boil-lancing incident with Rose Ellis, he professed not to know what a [...] "buttock" [...] was, claiming: [...] "It is a phrase I have honestly never heard. So far as I remember {{it is a little}} below the waist." [...] At this stage, only Harris's largely uncorroborated testimony had provided specific allegations of immorality; the rest of the evidence was inconclusive <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>that</b> the prosecution might fail. Davidson's cause was severely damaged, however, when Oliver produced a photograph of him, taken on 28 March 1932, with a nearly naked girl. She was Estelle Douglas, the 15-year-old daughter of one of Davidson' oldest friends. Davidson explained that the picture had been intended as a publicity shot to help the girl find work as an actress. He protested that he had been set up, and did not know she was naked under her shawl; he thought she was wearing a bathing suit, as she had been in an earlier photograph. [...] On 6 June, after closing speeches from both sides, the court adjourned until 8 July to allow the chancellor, who alone would determine the outcome, to consider the evidence.|$|E
2500|$|Hermione's {{first name}} {{is taken from}} a {{character}} in William Shakespeare's The Winter's Tale, though Rowling {{has said that the}} two characters have little in common otherwise.

[...] Her original last name was [...] "Puckle", but Rowling felt the name [...] "did not suit her at all", and so the less frivolous Granger made it into the books.|$|E

2500|$|Despite that setback, Van der Vaart {{produced}} some superlative {{performances in the}} Bundesliga the following season, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>that</b> Van der Vaart's turn to shine on the big stage was to finally come – at the 2006 World Cup. However, niggling injury problems resurfaced, and Van der Vaart was not risked by Dutch coach Marco van Basten for the opening World Cup encounter against Serbia and Montenegro. With victory in that opening game, the national team coach would once again decide to continue fielding a [...] "Van der Vaart-less" [...] lineup. And once again, Van der Vaart {{was reduced to a}} bit-part role in the squad although since then he has become a more regular fixture in the starting XI.|$|E
2500|$|The script of [...] "Band of Brothers" [...] {{describes}} Darius as a monk with a [...] "hideously ugly face", {{but when}} the producers cast the part, they chose German actor Werner Stocker, who did not fit this description.

And when I got to France, I noticed that they cast this young, handsome German actor named Werner Stocker. I said, 'Wait a minute. What's going on here? He's supposed to be ugly.' <b>And</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>that</b> the Germans, who were putting up a great deal of money, didn't want the only German actor in the show to be ugly; so he wasn't ugly.
