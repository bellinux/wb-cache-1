5|$|Young AAC users {{benefit from}} rich {{language}} and literacy experiences to foster vocabulary development, discourse skills, and phonological awareness, {{all of which}} supports successful literacy learning. Communication partners are encouraged to provide augmented input with the child, such as signing or pointing to symbols and codes as they communicate, including using the individual's communication system themselves. They <b>also</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> focussed and explicit reading instruction.|$|E
5|$|Territorial {{males are}} very site-faithful; 90% {{return to the}} same lekking sites in {{subsequent}} seasons, the most dominant males being {{the most likely to}} reappear. Site-faithful males can acquire accurate information about the competitive abilities of other males, leading to well-developed dominance relationships. Such stable relationships reduce conflict and the risk of injury, and the consequent lower levels of male aggression are less likely to scare off females. Lower-ranked territorial males <b>also</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> site fidelity since they can remain on the leks while waiting for the top males eventually to drop out.|$|E
5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet reduces seizure frequency by {{more than}} 50% in half of the patients who try it and {{by more than}} 90% in a third of patients. Three-quarters of children who respond do so within two weeks, though experts recommend a trial {{of at least three}} months before assuming it has been ineffective. Children with refractory epilepsy are more likely to benefit from the ketogenic diet than from trying another anticonvulsant drug. There is some evidence that adolescents and adults may <b>also</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> the diet.|$|E

5|$|While much wetland habitat {{has been}} {{eliminated}} due to human activity, new muskrat habitat {{has been created}} by the construction of canals or irrigation channels, and the muskrat remains common and widespread. They are able to live alongside streams which contain the sulfurous water that drains away from coal mines. Fish and frogs perish in such streams, yet muskrats may thrive and occupy the wetlands. Muskrats <b>also</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> human persecution {{of some of their}} predators.|$|E
5|$|The Hadza {{people of}} Tanzania also share food, {{possibly}} to gain in reputation. Hunters cannot be sharing meat mainly to provision their families or to gain reciprocal benefits, as teenage boys often give away their meat {{even though they}} do not yet have wives or children, so costly signalling of their qualities is the likely explanation. These qualities include good eyesight, coordination, strength, knowledge, endurance, or bravery. Hadza hunters more often pair with highly fertile, hard-working wives than non-hunters. A woman benefits from mating with a man who possesses such qualities as her children will most likely inherit qualities that increase fitness and survivorship. She may <b>also</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> her husband’s high social status. Thus, hunting is an honest and costly signal of phenotypic quality.|$|E
25|$|Many {{computer}} algebra {{systems such}} as Mathematica <b>also</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> the availability of arbitrary precision arithmetic which can provide more accurate results.|$|E

25|$|The state's tax {{policies}} {{relative to}} other states make Maryland competitive, according to the Tax Foundation. Maryland businesses <b>also</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> credits, exemptions and business loss deductions. As a result, when taking into account both the tax rate and base, Maryland is ranked as 14th best state for corporate taxes.|$|E

25|$|When youth {{participate}} in established empowerment programs {{they see a}} variety of benefits. The practices of youth involvement and empowerment become embedded within the organizational culture and the community culture. Adults and organizations <b>also</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> empowerment programs. The both become more connected and responsive to youth in the community, which leads to program improvements as well as increased participation from youth.|$|E
25|$|A 2016 {{report by}} the U.S. {{government}} report identifies the current challenges facing the education system, including the high dropout rate among high school students. The country needs even more workers who are fluent in English and languages such as Portuguese, Mandarin and French. It would <b>also</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> more graduates in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) programs, according to the report.|$|E
25|$|Currently, {{there are}} cross-subsidies in the tariff structure. Medium voltage {{consumers}} pay higher tariffs that serve to subsidize lower tariffs for low voltage consumers. Users that consume less than 150 kWh per month receive transfers {{from the rest}} of the consumers. The lowest-consumption users (0-50kWh/month) benefit from reductions between 45% and 63% in their average tariff. Consumers above the 50kWh limit <b>also</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> the subsidy scheme to a smaller extent.|$|E

25|$|A very {{important}} point to consider is that weeds would undergo the same acceleration of cycle as cultivated crops, and would <b>also</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> carbonaceous fertilization. Since most weeds are C3 plants, {{they are likely to}} compete even more than now against C4 crops such as corn. However, on the other hand, some results make it possible to think that weedkillers could increase in effectiveness with the temperature increase.|$|E
25|$|Helena holds {{numerous}} {{arts and}} crafts fairs and musical performances throughout the year in public spaces. Helena’s residents <b>also</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> the multitude of cultural attractions in the greater Birmingham area such as the Birmingham Zoo, Birmingham Museum of Art, McWane Center, and Vulcan statue and park. During 2005, Helena gained nationwide notice as the hometown of singer Bo Bice, who was a finalist on the popular Fox program American Idol.|$|E
25|$|Batsmen <b>also</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> the {{analysis}} of Hawk-Eye, as a record can be brought up of the deliveries batsmen scored from. These are often shown as a 2-D silhouetted figure of a batsmen and colour-coded dots of the balls faced by the batsman. Information such as the exact spot where the ball pitches or speed of the ball from the bowler's hand (to gauge batsman reaction time) can also help in post-match analysis.|$|E

25|$|As {{an example}} of how {{resource}} recycling can be beneficial, many of the items thrown away contain precious metals which can be recycled to create a profit, such as the components in circuit boards. Other industries can <b>also</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> resource recycling with the wood chippings in pallets and other packaging materials being passed onto sectors such as the horticultural profession. In this instance, workers can use the recycled chips to create paths, walkways, or arena surfaces.|$|E
25|$|Mycoheterotrophic {{plants are}} {{plants that are}} unable to photosynthesize and instead rely on carbon {{transfer}} from mycorrhizal networks as their main source of energy. This group of plants includes about 400 species. Some families that include mycotrophic species are: Ericaceae, Orchidaceae, Monotropaceae, and Gentianaceae. In addition, partially mycoheterotrophic ('mixotrophic') plants <b>also</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> energy transfer via hyphal networks. These plants have fully developed leaves but usually live in very nutrient and light limited environments that restrict their ability to photosynthesize.|$|E
25|$|All adult Octopus Card holders {{would be}} the first to benefit from the merger. Student and Concessionary Octopus holders would <b>also</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>from</b> the merger by further {{reducing}} $0.1 from their 50% off fares. Student Octopus holders would continue to pay the current reduced concessionary fares on the MTR network. Elderly Octopus holders would be introduced to a new fare system which only the elderly can enjoy a $2 fare to anywhere on the MTR network (excluding Airport Express, Light Rail, and Cross-Boundary Stations).|$|E
