50|$|Although it is {{assessed}} as a least concern species by IUCN, the eutrophication of {{the lakes}} in the Subalpine region, {{which began in}} the 1950s and peaked in 1979, badly affected Salvelinus umbla populations, which crashed during that period. The <b>lake</b> <b>char</b> became locally extinct in lakes such as Mondsee and other char species, such as Salvelinus profundus, were driven to extinction in the same period. Currently, however, most <b>lake</b> <b>char</b> populations are gradually recovering.|$|R

50|$|Lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) is a {{freshwater}} char living {{mainly in}} lakes in northern North America. Other names for it include mackinaw, <b>lake</b> <b>char</b> (or charr), touladi, togue, and grey trout. In Lake Superior, {{it can also}} be variously known as siscowet, paperbelly and lean.

50|$|The lake {{is home to}} {{numerous}} native species of trout, and other game fish. Catchable species include, {{but are not limited}} to - westslope cutthroat trout, rainbow trout, bull trout (<b>char),</b> <b>lake</b> trout (<b>char),</b> <b>Lake</b> Superior whitefish, mountain whitefish, kokanee salmon (landlocked sockeye), and suckers. However, the lake is nutrient-poor and is not considered a prime fishing destination. Grizzly bears, black bear, moose, and mule deer are found in many places near the lake but are most common on the north shore. The lake is surrounded by a dense coniferous forest dominated by various species of spruce, fir, and larch.|$|R
50|$|The lake {{is home to}} {{a variety}} of fish species, {{including}} Rainbow Trout, Sockeye Salmon (Kokanee), <b>Lake</b> Trout (<b>Char),</b> Ptychocheilus (Pikeminnows or Squawfish), Freshwater Whitefish (Whitefish), and Burbot.|$|R
50|$|<b>American</b> <b>Lake</b> {{is located}} in Lakewood, Washington and Joint Base Lewis-McChord. There are two public parks on the large lake: <b>American</b> <b>Lake</b> North Park & Marina, and Harry Todd Park. Both have lakeside beaches for swimming, fishing, or picnicking. The first also {{features}} a boat launching area; the latter has tennis courts. Fishing is a popular activity at <b>American</b> <b>Lake,</b> with cutthroat trout, largemouth bass, rainbow trout, rock bass, smallmouth bass, Sockeye salmon (kokanee) and yellow perch the most sought-after game fish. The Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife regularly monitors {{the health of the}} fishery and stocks favored species regularly.|$|R

40|$|The Chilean Patagonian lakes are {{characterized}} by their oligotrophy, high endemism, significant predominance of calanoid copepods in comparison to daphnid cladocerans, and low species richness. These characteristics are {{in marked contrast to}} the situation in North <b>American</b> <b>lakes.</b> In the present study, published information of chlorophyll concentrations and species richness for Chilean Patagonian lakes was considered. The results denoted direct correlations between chlorophyll concentration and species richness, as well as an inverse correlation between latitude and species richness, whereas a relationship between lake surface and species richness was not observed. The results obtained would indicate that the oligotrophic status of the sites studied is the main cause of low species richness. Our conclusions most probably reveal the existence of different regulator mechanisms in comparison to North <b>American</b> <b>lakes.</b> Ecological and biogeographical topics are discussed...|$|R

Removal of piscivorous fish can change lake water from clear to green by allowing phytoplankton to flourish.|$|R
