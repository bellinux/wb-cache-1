25|$|The Ford Model T (colloquially {{known as}} the Tin Lizzie, Leaping Lena, or flivver) is an {{automobile}} produced by Ford Motor Company from October 1, 1908, to May 26, 1927. It is generally regarded as the first affordable automobile, the car that opened travel to the common middle-class American; some of this was because of Ford's efficient fabrication, including <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> <b>production</b> instead of individual hand crafting.|$|E
25|$|American auto {{companies}} in the 1920s expected they would soon sell six million cars a year, but {{did not do so}} until 1955. Numerous companies disappeared. Between 1922 and 1925, the number of U.S. passenger car builders decreased from 175 to 70. H. A. Tarantous, managing editor of MoToR Member Society of Automotive Engineers, in a New York Times article from 1925, suggested many were unable to raise production and cope with falling prices (due to <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> <b>production),</b> especially for low-priced cars. The new pyroxylin-based paints, eight cylinder engine, four wheel brakes, and balloon tires as the biggest trends for 1925.|$|E
500|$|In 1830 James Nasmyth (son of Alexander Nasmyth) {{visited the}} newly opened Liverpool and Manchester Railway, and on his return to Manchester noted the {{suitability}} of a site alongside the canal at Patricroft for an engineering works. [...] He and his brother leased the land from Thomas de Trafford, and established the Bridgewater Foundry in 1836. The foundry was completed the following year with a design based upon <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> <b>production.</b> In 1839 Nasmyth invented the steam hammer, which enabled the manufacture of forgings at a scale and speed not seen before. In the same year the foundry started to manufacture railway locomotives, with109 built by 1853. Nasmyth died a wealthy man in 1890.|$|E

2500|$|Machines, in Wiener's opinion, {{are meant}} to {{interact}} harmoniously with humanity and provide respite from the industrial trap we have made for ourselves. Wiener describes the automaton as inherently necessary to humanity's societal evolution. People could be free to expand their minds, pursue artistic careers, while automatons take over <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> <b>production</b> to create necessary commodities. These machines must be [...] "used {{for the benefit of}} man, for increasing his leisure and enriching his spiritual life, rather than merely for profits and the worship of the machine as a new brazen calf" [...] (p.162).|$|E

40|$|Mixed-model <b>assembly</b> <b>lines</b> are {{of great}} {{practical}} relevance and {{are widely used}} {{in a range of}} industries, such as the final assembly of the automotive and electronics industries. Prior research mainly selected and discussed isolated problems rather than considering the whole planning process. In this article mixed-model production planning is decomposed into five steps: initial configuration of the line, master scheduling, reconfiguration planning, sequencing and resequencing. The paper reviews and discusses all relevant planning steps and proposes general planning instruments as well as formalized decision models for those steps, which have not been thoroughly investigated in the literature thus far.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} a new software tool for automatic creation of simulation models for flow lines. The tool {{was developed in}} a general way. The tool {{was applied to the}} <b>production</b> flow <b>line</b> at the rolling stock Company Bombardier Transportation Portugal, SA, in Amadora, in order to develop its simulation model. Information regarding manufacturing philosophies, flow <b>assembly</b> <b>lines,</b> <b>production</b> scheduling, and software tools for the model creation are required to perform this task. The paper mainly focuses on the model creation process and the productivity gains generated by this work...|$|R

50|$|On October 7, 1913, the Highland Park Ford Plant {{became the}} first {{automobile}} production facility {{in the world to}} implement the moving <b>assembly</b> <b>line.</b> The new <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> improved <b>production</b> time of the Model T from 728 to 93 minutes. The Highland Parks <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> lowered the price of the Model T from $700 in 1910 to $350 in 1917 making it an affordable automobile for most Americans. Ford offered nearly three times the wages paid at other unskilled manufacturing plants.|$|R
50|$|Heyco {{was founded}} in 1937 by Max and Ernst Heynen and started off {{manufacturing}} hand tools for the early automotive industry in Remscheid, Germany. After World War II, Heyco began production of tools for <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> automobile <b>production.</b> Heyco expanded to Tittling/Bavaria, Germany in 1961, and to Derschen/Rheinland-Pfalz, Germany in 1981.

50|$|Alfred Sloan of General Motors further {{developed}} the concept of <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> <b>production</b> by building a process called mass production that allowed scale and variety.

50|$|The Prairie School {{developed}} in {{sympathy with the}} ideals and design aesthetics of the Arts and Crafts Movement begun in the late 19th century in England by John Ruskin, William Morris, and others.

50|$|The Detroit area company became {{well known}} for their sleek racing boats in the 1910s and 1920s.

In the late 1920s, Chris-Craft {{extended}} its market into the middle class when it {{became one of the}} first mass producers of civilian pleasure boats. The company began <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> <b>production</b> at their Algonac, Michigan plant, dramatically lowering production costs. Formerly, most powerboats had been hand-built.|$|E

We also find that greater parallelism offers greater opportunity for improvement. <b>assembly</b> <b>line,</b> throughput, <b>production</b> system design...|$|R
50|$|During the {{industrial}} revolution, fabric production was mechanised with machines powered by waterwheels and steam-engines.

50|$|Just in {{sequence}} (JIS) is an inventory strategy that matches {{just in time}} (JIT) and complete fit {{in sequence}} with variation of <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> <b>production.</b> Components and parts arrive at a production line right in time as scheduled before they get assembled. Feedback from the manufacturing line is used to coordinate transportation {{to and from the}} process area. When implemented successfully, JIS improves a company's return on assets (ROA), without loss in flexibility, quality or overall efficiency. JIS is mainly implemented with automobile manufacturing.|$|E
50|$|Loziers were {{top line}} luxury cars {{and for a}} time were the most {{expensive}} cars produced in the United States. The 1910 model line featured cars priced between US$4,600 and US$7,750. The same year, a Cadillac could be had for about US$1,600 and a Packard US$3,200. A pre-assembly line Ford Model T of the same year retailed at approximately US$850 (after installing <b>assembly</b> <b>line</b> <b>production</b> a few years later, new Model Ts sold for as little as US$240). The average annual salary in America that year was approximately US$750.|$|E

By 1926, when Wanderer introduced a successful Typ 10, {{the company was}} making 25 vehicles a day; parts were made at the old plant in Chemnitz and assembled at the 1927 built new site in Siegmar, delivered by rail right to the <b>assembly</b> <b>line.</b> Motorcycle <b>production</b> continued in Chemnitz alone.|$|R
