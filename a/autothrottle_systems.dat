40|$|Several YF- 12 C {{airplane}} {{analog control}} systems {{were converted to}} a digital system. Included were the air data computer, autopilot, inlet control system, and <b>autothrottle</b> <b>systems.</b> This conversion was performed to allow assessment of digital technology applications to supersonic cruise aircraft. The digital system was composed of a digital computer and specialized interface unit. A large scale mathematical simulation of the airplane was used for integration testing and software checkout...|$|E
40|$|In {{conventional}} {{flight control}} design, the autopilot and the <b>autothrottle</b> <b>systems</b> are usually considered separately, {{resulting in a}} complex system and inefficient integration of functions. Therefore, the concept of aircraft energy control is brought up {{to solve the problem}} of coordinated control using elevator and throttle. The goal of this study is to develop an optimal energy control system (OECS), based on the concept of optimal energy for fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The energy of an aircraft is characterized by two parameters, which are specific energy distribution rate, driven by elevator, and total specific energy rate, driven by throttle. In this study, a system identification method was employed to obtain the energy model of a small UAV. The proposed approach consists of energy distribution loop and total energy loop. Energy distribution loop is designed based on linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) regulator and is responsible for regulating specific energy distribution rate to zero. On the other hand, the total energy loop, based on simple gain scheduling method, is responsible for driving the error of total specific energy rate to zero. The implementation of OECS was successfully validated in the hard-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation of the applied UAV...|$|E
500|$|Flight Data Recorder (FDR) {{information}} recovered {{after the}} crash and released by Brazilian authorities showed that immediately prior to touchdown, both thrust levers were in CL (or [...] "climb") position, with engine power being governed by the flight computer's <b>autothrottle</b> <b>system.</b> Two seconds prior to touchdown, an aural warning, [...] "retard, retard," [...] was issued by the flight's computer system, advising the pilots to [...] "retard" [...] the thrust lever to the recommended idle or reverse thrust lever position. This would disengage the aircraft's <b>autothrottle</b> <b>system,</b> with engine power then being governed directly by the thrust lever's position.|$|R
40|$|Flight {{test results}} {{obtained}} {{with the original}} Mach hold autopilot designed the YF- 12 C airplane which uses elevator control and a newly developed Mach hold <b>system</b> having an <b>autothrottle</b> integrated with an altitude hold autopilot system are presented. The autothrottle tests demonstrate good speed control at high Mach numbers and high altitudes while simultaneously maintaining control over altitude and good ride qualities. The <b>autothrottle</b> <b>system</b> was designed to control either Mach number or knots equivalent airspeed (KEAS). Excellent control of Mach number or KEAS was obtained with the <b>autothrottle</b> <b>system</b> when combined with altitude hold. Ride qualities were significantly better than with the conventional Mach hold system...|$|R
50|$|In speed mode the {{throttle}} is positioned {{to attain a}} set target speed. This mode controls aircraft speed within safe operating margins. For example, if the pilot selects a target speed which is slower than stall speed, or a speed faster than maximum speed, the <b>autothrottle</b> <b>system</b> will maintain a speed closest to the target speed that is {{within the range of}} safe speeds.|$|R
50|$|During its tests {{aboard the}} Admiral Kuznetsov {{aircraft}}-carrying cruiser, the aircraft had a springboard-assisted takeoff from strips 195 m and 95 m long. According {{to the results}} of the tests, the landing accuracy proved to be very high, which made it possible at a later stage to switch over to a three-cable arrester system on the Admiral Gorshkov. The landing accuracy is additionally enhanced through the employment of an <b>autothrottle</b> <b>system.</b> The takeoff characteristics allow for most flights to be possible under tropical conditions at a ship speed of 10 kn.|$|R
5000|$|On July 15, 2013, two Korean {{passengers}} filed {{a lawsuit}} against Asiana Airlines in a California federal court for [...] "an extensive litany of errors and omissions" [...] and improper crew training and supervision. On the same day, 83 passengers filed a petition for discovery in Chicago, alleging a possible failure of the <b>autothrottle</b> <b>system</b> and malfunctioning evacuation slides and seat belts. An additional lawsuit against Asiana Airlines and Boeing Aircraft Company was filed on August 9, 2013. In addition to alleging product defects, the suits focus on the training provided to the Asiana crew.|$|R
40|$|The {{factors which}} {{affected}} {{two groups of}} airline pilots in the transition from traditional airline cockpits to a highly automated version were studied. All pilots were highly experienced in traditional models of the McDonnell-Douglas DC- 9 prior to their transition to the more automated DC- 9 - 80. Specific features of the new aircraft, particularly the digital flight guidance system (DFGS) and other automatic features such as the <b>autothrottle</b> <b>system</b> (ATS), autobrake, and digital display were studied. Particular {{attention was paid to}} the first 200 hours of line flying experience in the new aircraft, and the difficulties that some pilots found in adapting to the new systems during this initial operating period. Efforts to prevent skill loss from automation, training methods, traditional human factors issues, and general views of the pilots toward cockpit automation are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{was to determine if}} the two-segment profile equipment, and operational procedures as defined by the B- 727 Simulation Evaluation are operationally sound under all flight conditions expected to be encountered in line service. The evaluation was divided into the following areas: (1) to verify that the two-segment system operates as it was designed; (2) to conduct sufficient tests to secure a supplemental type certificate for line operation of the system; (3) to evaluate the normal operation of the equipment and procedures; (4) to evaluate the need for an <b>autothrottle</b> <b>system</b> for two-segment approaches; (5) to investigate abnormal operation of the equipment and procedures, including abused approaches and malfunctions of airborne and ground components; (6) to determine the accuracy and ease of flying the two-segment approach; (7) to determine the improvement in ground noise levels; and (8) to develop a guest pilot flight test syllabus...|$|R
50|$|On 25 February 2009, Turkish Airlines Flight 1951, a Boeing 737-800 from Istanbul {{crashed on}} approach, just 1 km {{short of the}} airport's Polderbaan runway. The plane carried 128 {{passengers}} and 7 crew on board. 9 {{people were killed and}} a further 86 were injured, including six with serious injuries. Four of the dead were employees of Boeing, involved in an advanced radar deal with Turkey. An initial report from the Dutch Safety Board revealed that the left radio altimeter had failed to provide the correct height above the ground and suddenly reported -8 ft. As a result of this the <b>autothrottle</b> <b>system</b> closed the thrust levers to idle, as it is programmed to reduce thrust when below 27 ft radio altitude. This eventually resulted in a dropping airspeed that was not acted upon {{until it was too late}} to recover, and the aircraft stalled and crashed in a field.|$|R
50|$|As the {{aircraft}} lifted off the runway on the accident flight with both engines at full power, a faulty micro-switch {{in conjunction with}} a possible short circuit caused the right engine's thrust reverser to deploy. The imbalance of power resulted in {{the aircraft}} rolling and veering to the right as it was climbing away from the runway. The safety system automatically cut the power to the engine suffering the thrust reverser malfunction. The copilot, seeing the right engine power lever automatically move to the closed position, thought that the lever had slipped back and pushed it back to the full power position alongside the left engine throttle lever. Once again, the automatic safety system closed the right engine throttle and the captain, who was conducting the takeoff, called for the <b>autothrottle</b> <b>system</b> to be switched off. After switching off the system, the copilot again pushed the right engine power lever fully forward and forcefully held it there.|$|R
40|$|The {{altitude}} hold mode of the YF- 12 A airplane was modified {{to include a}} high-pass-filtered pitch rate feedback along with optimized inner loop altitude rate proportional and integral gains. An <b>autothrottle</b> control <b>system</b> was also developed to control either Mach number or KEAS at the high-speed flight conditions. Flight tests indicate that, with the modified system, significant improvements are obtained in both altitude and speed control, and the combination of altitude and autothrottle hold modes provides the most stable aircraft platform thus far demonstrated at Mach 3 conditions...|$|R
5000|$|Cessna {{formally}} {{announced the}} aircraft on February 6, 2008 FAA certification was planned {{by the end}} of 2013, with deliveries beginning in 2014. The Columbus had a target range of 4000 nmi km with 8 passengers. The cockpit would have featured a synthetic vision <b>system,</b> <b>autothrottles,</b> optional head-up display and Collins' MultiScan weather radar with optional windshear prediction.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the implementation {{and evaluation of}} technologies that predict and assess the future aircraft energy state and autoflight configuration, and provide appropriate alerting to better inform pilots {{of the effect of}} problematic autoflight inputs or conditions. Prediction algorithms are used to extrapolate {{the current state of the}} aircraft based on flight management, autopilot and <b>autothrottle</b> <b>system</b> control laws and knowledge of mode transition logic. The resulting predicted trajectory represents the future four-dimensional flight path of the aircraft if the current course of action is continued. Probabilistic methods are used to estimate the trim envelope through high-fidelity model-based computation of attainable equilibrium sets. The corresponding maneuverability limitations of the aircraft are determined through a robust reachability analysis (relative to the trim envelope) through an optimal control formulation. The combination of prediction and assessment technologies are used to trigger timely alerts to avoid loss of control situations. The maneuvering envelope limits are also indicated on the primary flight display, and the predicted trajectory is displayed on navigation and vertical situation displays. The display features and alerts were evaluated in the Advanced Concepts Flight Simulator at NASA Ames Research Center, where commercial airline crews flew multiple problematic approach and landings scenarios to investigate the impact on current and future aircraft energy state awareness. Results show that the display features and alerts have the potential to improve situational awareness of what the automation is doing now and what it will do in the future...|$|R
500|$|At {{the moment}} of touchdown, the spoiler lever was in the [...] "ARMED" [...] position. According to the system logic of the A320's flight controls, {{in order for the}} {{spoilers}} to automatically deploy upon touchdown not only must the spoiler lever be in the [...] "ARMED" [...] position, but both thrust levers must be at or close to the [...] "idle" [...] position. The FDR transcript shows that immediately after the warning, the flight computer recorded the left thrust lever being retarded to the rear-most position, activating the thrust reverser on the left engine, while the right thrust lever (controlling the engine with the disabled thrust reverser) remained in the CL position. One theory put forth by CENIPA is that the pilots may not have noticed that the right engine remained at CL because the Airbus <b>autothrottle</b> <b>system,</b> unlike other aircraft manufacturers, does not automatically move the levers when the autothrust controller changes engine settings. Therefore, the pilots may have thought that the right engine was at idle power without realizing that Airbus autothrust logic dictates that, when {{one or more of the}} thrust levers is pulled to the idle position, the autothrust is automatically disengaged. Thus, when the pilot pulled the left engine thrust lever to idle, it disconnected the autothrust system and the computer did not retard the right engine power to idle. The A320's spoilers did not deploy during the landing run, as the right thrust lever was above the [...] "idle" [...] setting required for automatic spoiler deployment. Since the right engine thrust lever was still in the [...] "climb" [...] detent at that time, the right engine accelerated to climb power while the left engine deployed its thrust reverser. The resulting asymmetric thrust condition resulted in a loss of control and a crash ensued.|$|R
25|$|The {{cockpit of}} the PC-24 is {{designed}} for efficiency and to reduce pilot workload. Marketed as the Advanced Cockpit Environment (ACE), information is displayed on four 12-inch liquid-crystal displays (LCDs). Pilatus selected Honeywell to develop and supply the ACE avionics suite. It uses {{some of the same}} avionics used in the Pilatus PC-12, in addition to those developed specifically for the PC-24. Standard avionics equipment includes a synthetic vision <b>system,</b> <b>autothrottle,</b> Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS II), localizer performance with vertical guidance and graphic flight planning system.|$|R
40|$|International audienceOver {{the last}} few years, several {{concepts}} dealing the delegation to the flight crew of some tasks currently performed by the air traffic controllers have emerged. Among these new ideas, relative guidance has appeared to be capable {{to contribute to the}} enhancement of air traffic capacity though it raises difficult technical challenges. Indeed, this kind of maneuver appears difficult to perform manually, and may induce an excessive increase in flight crew workload, thus requiring new on-board automated functions. Some linear and nonlinear techniques have already been studied to design a feedback loop which performs automatically merging maneuvers and maintains station keeping behind a designated aircraft. The main contribution of this paper consists in the design of a feedback control loop using flatness control: this technique takes advantage of feedback linearization through a reference error between the ghost position of the leading aircraft and the current position of the trailing aircraft to provide a commanded speed to the <b>autothrottle</b> speed control <b>system</b> of the trailing aircraft. The robustness of the proposed design with respect to uncertainties in the dynamics of the leading aircraft and in the dynamics of the <b>autothrottle</b> speed control <b>system</b> of the trailing aircraft is achieved by the periodic update of the reference error. The reference error generation is detailed and simulation results are presented...|$|R
