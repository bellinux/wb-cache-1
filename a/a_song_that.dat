5|$|Production of {{the song}} was a {{collaborative}} effort between Jackson, David Foster and Bill Bottrell. Andrae Crouch's Choir and Jackson engage in a back and forth chant as the song reaches its climactic finale. Jackson's intent was to create <b>a</b> <b>song</b> <b>that</b> was lyrically deep yet melodically simple, so the whole world, particularly non-English-speaking fans, could sing along. He conceptualized <b>a</b> <b>song</b> <b>that</b> had an emotional message.|$|E

The song, which was engineered and produced by Del Palmer, was released on Azulay's album Out of the Ashes.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Rachel (Lea Michele) {{realizes that}} some glee club members are faking their singing. She tells glee club {{director}} Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison), complaining {{that she is}} {{doing most of the}} work, exhausting herself and getting ill in the process. She reveals the non-participants as Finn (Cory Monteith), Quinn (Dianna Agron), Puck, Brittany (Heather Morris), and Santana. Will gathers the students and gives them a new task for the week: each club member will have to do solos, and each must choose <b>a</b> <b>song</b> <b>that</b> best represents their feelings.|$|E
5|$|Pentangle {{reached their}} highest point of {{commercial}} {{success with the}} release of their Basket of Light album in 1969. The single, Light Flight, taken from the album became popular through its use as theme music for a TV drama series Take Three Girls for which the band also provided incidental music. In 1970, at the peak of their popularity, they recorded a soundtrack for the film Tam Lin, made at least 12 television appearances, and undertook tours of the UK, including the Isle of Wight Festival, and America, including a concert at Carnegie Hall). However, their fourth album, Cruel Sister, released in October 1970, was a commercial disaster. This was an album of traditional songs that included a 20-minute-long version of Jack Orion, <b>a</b> <b>song</b> <b>that</b> Jansch and Renbourn had recorded previously as a duo on Jansch's Jack Orion album.|$|E
5|$|Per Gessle and Marie Fredriksson {{first met}} in Halmstad, Sweden, {{in the late}} 1970s. Gessle {{performed}} in Gyllene Tider, one of Sweden's most popular bands at the time, and Fredriksson in the less successful Strul and MaMas Barn (Mama's Children) before both embarked on solo careers. In 1981, Fredriksson sang {{for the first time}} with Gyllene Tider on stage and was featured as a background vocalist for a Swedish-language album the band released in 1982. Gessle also worked with ex-ABBA singer Frida, for <b>a</b> <b>song</b> <b>that</b> appeared on her 1982 album Something's Going On, setting music to a Dorothy Parker poem.|$|E

5|$|The Simpsons go to {{the local}} movie theater to see a film. Bart and Lisa see Space Mutants VI, while Homer, Marge, and Maggie see The Stockholm Affair. As the film starts, Homer acts loud and obnoxious, {{embarrassing}} Marge. When he gives away the film's ending, Marge berates him and the audience heckles Homer, embarrassing them both. During the car ride home, Marge tries to apologize, but Homer will not accept it, by dropping Marge and the children off at home and goes off on a long drive into the night, finally stopping at a redneck bar called Beer 'N' Brawl, where he grabs a beer while listening to an attractive waitress named Lurleen Lumpkin performing on stage. She sings <b>a</b> <b>song</b> <b>that</b> follows Homer's current state with every detail, and once she finishes, Homer introduces himself to her.|$|E
5|$|This is an escapist anthem {{about leaving}} {{wherever}} you're stuck, {{getting in a}} car, whacking some amazing music on the stereo and putting your foot down. In other words, it's still only when she's dancing that she feels this free, and it's still music making the people come together. It captures a brilliantly teenage sensation ("only music can save me from my shit life") but makes sense of it in <b>a</b> <b>song</b> <b>that</b> doesn't sound like she's trying too hard to be down with the kids... Real life is sometimes a bit more complicated than that, and sometimes freedom is {{about being able to}} leave the cunts behind to get on with their useless lives. And that's what this song is about.|$|E
5|$|According to Njáls saga, Gilli and Sitriuc spent Yule with Sigurðr in Orkney, where Sitriuc {{convinced}} Sigurðr to ally {{himself against}} Brian {{on the condition}} that Sigurðr would gain Gormlaith in marriage. In April 1014, the opposing forces met and clashed at the remarkably bloody Battle of Clontarf. Although Brian's forces ultimately won the day, and Sigurðr himself was amongst the slain, Brian lost his life as well. As for Gilli, he appears in a chapter of Njáls saga that presents a series of supernatural events connected with the conflict. In one instance, a Caithnessman is said to have witnessed valkyrie-like apparitions singing songs for the slain, whilst a similar event is said to have occurred in the Faroe Islands. Priests in Iceland are stated to have encountered paranormal phenomena, whilst an Orcadian is said to have encountered the spectre of Sigurðr before disappearing {{off the face of the}} earth. As for Gilli, the saga asserts that he dreamt of <b>a</b> <b>song</b> <b>that</b> foretold the outcome of the battle and the fall of Brian and Sigurðr. There is reason to suspect that the aforesaid supernatural manifestationsarguably somewhat detached from the saga's general narrativeare actually interpolations of separate material. Elsewhere in the narrative, however, there are examples of paranormal phenomena intervening into human affairs. For example, the episode concerning Gilli's dream seems to directly parallel an earlier episode in which another man, the Icelander Flosi Þórðarson, is depicted dreaming of the burning of the saga's eponym, Njáll Þorgeirsson.|$|E

5|$|Bruno Mars {{has earned}} {{numerous}} awards and honors throughout his career, including five Grammy Awards, three Brit Awards, one Guinness World Record and three MTV Europe Music Awards. In 2011, Mars made Time magazine's 100 list and in 2013 {{he was considered}} the sixth best songwriter of that year by Billboard. The Smeezingtons, Mars' former songwriting and record producing team, have earned several accolades. In 2014, Mars became the artist with the most top five entries on the Billboard Hot 100 since his first week on the chart. Along with Adele and John Legend, Mars is the only artist who has <b>a</b> <b>song</b> <b>that</b> features only piano and vocals to top the Hot 100. He is the first male artist to place two titles as a lead act in the Hot 100's top 10 simultaneously. Mars was the most played artist on pop radio in 2013 according to Mediabase {{and became the first}} solo male artist whose first 13 Top 40 hits all reached the Top 10 on the American Top 40. In total, he has had seven number-one singles on the Hot 100 chart.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by {{executive}} producer Diane Ruggiero and directed by John T. Kretchmer, marking Ruggiero's sixteenth and penultimate writing credit and Kretchmer's twelfth directing credit. One scene in the episode depicts Veronica and Max sitting {{in the backseat of}} a vehicle with Chelsea's pimp (a woman) and several bodyguards. Kretchmer decided to place one of the physically domineering bodyguards between Max and Veronica for comedic effect. In addition, Thomas noted that the actress of the pimp, Jackie Debatin, appeared in a similar role in an episode of The Office several weeks after the episode aired. The scene in which Keith, in a Sheriff's uniform, spots Don Lamb in his car was difficult to edit because although there was initially no radio music playing, Michael Muhney, the actor of Lamb, was moving his mouth as if singing lyrics. Thomas reported difficulty in finding <b>a</b> <b>song</b> <b>that</b> would match the movements.|$|E

25|$|The {{song was}} written {{considering}} how popular music consumers chose {{to listen to}} music in the early 2010s: by listening to samples on a purchasing page, or to ringtone versions of a song, and from there deciding if they like a song or not. Yamaguchi wanted to create <b>a</b> <b>song</b> <b>that</b> was hard to critically review due to its complexity, and that music consumers could not evaluate listening to a single sample. Yamaguchi wrote <b>a</b> <b>song</b> <b>that</b> was similar in style to songs in a Japanese school chorus competition: songs without a chorus but with multiple different verses. He made the first section begin with a kayōkyoku-inspired pop melody, so that the song could be understood by casual pop music listeners.|$|E
