5|$|The 2007 Pacific {{hurricane}} season was {{an event in}} the annual cycle of tropical cyclone formation. This timeline documents all the storm formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, and dissipation. The timeline also includes information which was not operationally released, which is information from post-storm <b>analysis</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> National Hurricane Center.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 57 genera of {{flowering}} plants contain at least 500 species, {{according to a}} 2004 <b>analysis</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> botanical taxonomist David Frodin. The actual numbers of species are imprecisely known, {{as many of the}} genera have not been the subject of recent monographs. For instance, {{estimates of the number of}} species in the orchid genus Pleurothallis range from 1,120 to 2,500. Genera from other groups of vascular plants, but which have similarly large numbers of species, include Selaginella, Asplenium and Cyathea.|$|E
5|$|In November 2012, {{after a week}} of {{conflict}} between Israel and Palestinian militant groups, a ceasefire brokered by Egypt was announced on November 21. UN OCHA says 2,205 Palestinians (including at least 1,483 civilians) and 71 Israelis (including 66 soldiers) and one foreign national in Israel were killed in the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict. According to an <b>analysis</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> New York Times, men ages 20–29, {{who are most likely to}} be militants, are most overrepresented in the death toll.|$|E

5|$|According to the U.S. Department of Energy, {{combined}} sales of plug-in hybrids and battery electric {{cars in the}} American market climbed more rapidly and outsold by more than double sales of hybrid-electric vehicles over their respective 24 month introductory periods. A 2016 <b>analysis</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Consumer Federation of America (CFA) found that 5 years after its introduction, sales of plug-in electric cars in the U.S. continued to outsell conventional hybrids. An analysis by Scientific American found a similar trend {{at the international level}} when considering the global top selling PEVs over a 36-month introductory period. Monthly sales of the Volt, Prius PHV and Leaf performed better than the conventional Prius during their respective introductory periods, {{with the exception of the}} Mitsubishi i-MiEV, which has been outsold most of the time by the Prius HEV over their 36-month introductory periods.|$|E
5|$|Committee {{inquiries}} typically {{begin with}} the reference of an issue or a proposed law to the committee for inquiry and report back to the Senate. The committee will make a call for submissions, seeking public input on the matter referred to the committee. It will often publish those submissions to help inform stakeholders of the views that are being put to the committee. A committee will often hold one or more public hearings, at which committee members ask questions of key stakeholders interested in the issue under inquiry. These hearings may be held anywhere in Australia, are often broadcast, and result in a published transcript (Hansard) that records the evidence taken. The opportunity to make submissions, and the greater accessibility of the committees compared to parliament itself, can provide disadvantaged individuals and organisations valued opportunities to engage in democratic processes. Committees also frequently ask relevant government agencies to respond to issues raised by submissions or evidence given to the inquiry. Once evidence has been gathered there usually follows a period of research and <b>analysis</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> committee. It will then deliver {{a report to the}} Senate, which will generally include recommendations. The Commonwealth government is then expected to table a response to the report, stating responses to any recommendations the committee may have made.|$|E
5|$|The {{depression}} strengthened {{further and}} officially attained tropical storm status at 0000UTC on December 27, {{based on the}} <b>analysis</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), though the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) unofficially classified it as a tropical storm six hours prior. Shortly thereafter, an eye with a 39km (24mi) diameter became apparent on satellite imagery, along with rainbands extending southward {{to the opposite side}} of the equator. At 0600UTC, the JMA first classified the system as Tropical Storm Vamei, about 65km (40mi) northeast of Singapore, and the agency estimated the storm attained peak winds of 85km/h (50mph) at the same time. However, the JTWC upgraded Vamei to typhoon status with peak winds of 140km/h (85mph), based on a United States Navy ship report from within the eye; a second ship reported wind gusts of 195km/h (120mph) in the southern portion of the eyewall. The storm was small and compact, with gales extending about 45km (30mi) from its center. At about 0830UTC on December 27, Vamei made landfall approximately 60km (35mi) northeast of Singapore, in the southeastern portion of the Malaysian state of Johor. Initially, the Malaysian Meteorological Department (MetMalaysia) classified the cyclone as a tropical storm, though it was later re-assessed as a typhoon at landfall.|$|E
