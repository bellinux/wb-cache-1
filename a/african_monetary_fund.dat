40|$|Could a West <b>African</b> <b>monetary</b> union (either of the non-CFA countries, or all ECOWAS members) be an {{effective}} "agency of restraint" on fiscal policies? We discuss how monetary union could affect fiscal discipline and the arguments for explicit fiscal restraints considered in the European Monetary Union literature, and their applicability to West Africa. The empirical evidence, EMU literature, and CFA experience suggest that monetary union could create the temptation for fiscal profligacy through prospects of a bailout, or costs diluted through the membership. Thus, a West <b>African</b> <b>monetary</b> union could promote fiscal discipline only if {{the hands of the}} fiscal authorities are also tied by a strong set of fiscal restraints.

40|$|There is {{substantial}} evidence that International <b>Monetary</b> <b>Fund</b> policies {{are driven by}} the powerful states which intervene to align policy with their preferences. In particular, many {{have argued that the}} United States uses its position as the Fund’s largest shareholder to achieve its foreign policy objectives. As a result, a substantial volume of literature argues and presents evidence to support the claim that International <b>Monetary</b> <b>Fund</b> decisions faithfully reflect US interests. My findings extend these claims. Using a new dataset on the presence in International <b>Monetary</b> <b>Fund</b> agreements of binding conditions, which cause the agreement to be suspended or terminated if they are not met, I demonstrate that International <b>Monetary</b> <b>Fund</b> agreements contain fewer binding conditions when a suspension of International <b>Monetary</b> <b>Fund</b> lending plausibly would impose greater hardship on creditor country banks and exporters...|$|R
