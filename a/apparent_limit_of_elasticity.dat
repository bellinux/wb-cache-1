If a high-torque motor is used, the instrument-specific limit-torque (fracture limit) is often exceeded, thus increasing {{the risk of}} intracanal failure. A possible {{solution to this problem}} is to use a low-torque endodontic motor which operates below these values. If the torque is set just below the <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>elasticity</b> for each instrument, the risk of fracture is likely to be markedly reduced. The purpose of this paper was to discuss mechanical properties of NiTi rotary instruments, the rationale for selecting low torque values, and to use clinically a new endodontic motor (step-motor) which operates below the <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>elasticity</b> <b>of</b> each rotary file. The step-motor was found to be helpful in reducing the risk of instrument fracture. Irreversible material damage (plastic deformation) and instrument fracture were rarely seen.

The objective of this study is to clarify the stress-strainbehaviors when the loading direction is reversed. For the purpose conventional triaxialtests for a saturated clay were performed in which deviator stress was applied in compressionstate and unloaded to failure in extension state. Stress-strain behavior has been found to be elastic in some portion after the moment ofunloading of shear stress and beyond the portion the behavior begins to be elasto-plastic. Such a <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>elasticity</b> can be determined in stress space and the variation with the defor-mation history having been given before unloading are discussed.

A few of conclusions are summarized as follows: 1) A parameter defined as a function of stress ratio at the start of unloading and stressratio at the <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>elasticity</b> appears to be related to shear strain given before unload-ing uniquely in spite of both drainage condition and OCR. 2) G is not influenced by the degree of the deformation history if effective mean stressis not altered during deformation history as in drained tests but it decreases in thecase when effective mean stress decreases with shear as in undrained tests for normallyconsolidated clays...|$|R

The objects are disks of the same size but, in general, of different materials. Potential applications include the design of new amorphous polymeric and related granular materials as well as the design of package cushioning systems. The problem is considered on a grid structure with a fixed step size w and for a fixed diameter of the discs, i. e., the number of placed disks may increase as the size of the placement region increases. The near-equilibrium configurations have to be calculated from uniformly distributed random initial placements. The final arrangements of disks must ensure that any particular object is deformed only within the <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>elasticity</b> <b>of</b> the material. The main result concerns -approximations of the probability distribution on the set of equilibrium placements. Under a natural assumption about the configuration space, we prove that a run-time of n+logO(1) (1 /} is sufficient to approach with probability 1 ??? the minimum value of the objective function, where depends on the maximum of the escape depth of local minima within the underlying energy landscape. The result is derived from a careful analysis of the interaction among probabilities assigned to configurations from adjacent distance levels to minimum placements.
