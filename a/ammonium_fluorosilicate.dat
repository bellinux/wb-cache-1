50|$|<b>Ammonium</b> <b>fluorosilicate</b> is noncombustible, but it {{will still}} release {{dangerous}} fumes in a fire, including hydrogen fluoride, silicon tetrafluoride, and nitrogen oxides.

50|$|<b>Ammonium</b> <b>fluorosilicate</b> finds {{use as a}} disinfectant, and it {{is useful}} in etching glass, metal casting, and electroplating.|$|E
50|$|Fluorosilicic {{acid and}} its salts are poisonous. <b>Ammonium</b> <b>fluorosilicate,</b> however, {{is very rare}} in nature and {{apparently}} much easier to synthesize.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ammonium</b> <b>fluorosilicate</b> (also {{known as}} {{ammonium}} hexafluorosilicate, ammonium fluosilicate or ammonium silicofluoride) has the formula (NH4)2SiF6. It is a toxic chemical, like all salts of fluorosilicic acid. It {{is made of}} white crystals, which have at least three polymorphs and appears in nature as rare minerals cryptohalite or bararite.|$|E
50|$|Although bararite was {{claimed to}} be {{metastable}} at room temperature, {{it does not appear}} one polymorph has ever turned into another. Still, bararite is fragile enough that grinding it for spectroscopy will produce a little cryptohalite. Even so, <b>ammonium</b> <b>fluorosilicate</b> assumes a trigonal form at pressures of 0.2 to 0.3 GPa. The reaction is irreversible. If it is not bararite, the phase is at least very closely related.|$|E
50|$|Bararite is {{a natural}} form of <b>ammonium</b> <b>fluorosilicate</b> (also known as hexafluorosilicate or fluosilicate). It has {{chemical}} formula (NH4)2SiF6 and trigonal crystal structure. This mineral was once classified as part of cryptohalite. Bararite is named after {{the place where it}} was first described, Barari, India. It is found at the fumaroles of volcanoes (Vesuvius, Italy), over burning coal seams (Barari, India), and in burning piles of anthracite (Pennsylvania, U.S.). It is a sublimation product that forms with cryptohalite, sal ammoniac, and native sulfur.|$|E
50|$|In Barari, burning-coal gases {{go through}} a dike (igneous intrusion) of mica and peridotite. The sulfur dioxide must attack apatite in the dike, which {{produces}} hydrofluoric acid that attacks the abundant silicates. Silicon fluoride is formed. Ammonia also comes from burning coal. From there, <b>ammonium</b> <b>fluorosilicate</b> can form. A slight excess of ammonia {{could lead to the}} white lumps of silica and cryptohalite. Bararite and cryptohalite in their pure forms, for the most part, grow out of these nodules. Recrystallization from the rain is probably responsible.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ammonium</b> <b>fluorosilicate</b> {{has three}} major polymorphs: α-(NH4)2SiF6 form is cubic (space group Fm3m, No. 225) and {{corresponds}} to the mineral cryptohalite. The β form is trigonal (scalenohedral) and occurs in nature as mineral bararite. A third (γ) form was discovered in 2001 and identified with the hexagonal 6mm symmetry. In all three configurations, the SiF62− octahedra are arranged in layers. In the α form, these layers are perpendicular to 111 directions. In the β- and γ- forms, the layers are perpendicular to the c-axis. (Note: trigonal symmetry {{is part of the}} hexagonal group, but not all hexagonal crystals are trigonal.) The silicon atoms of α-(NH4)2SiF6 (alpha), have cubic close(st) packing (CCP). The γ form has hexagonal close(st) packing and the β-(NH4)2SiF6 has primitive hexagonal packing. In all three phases, 12 fluorine atoms neighbor the (NH4)+.|$|E
30|$|Zeolite-containing {{catalysts}} {{have been}} playing important roles in oil refining and petrochemical fields [1]. Crystalline aluminosilicate Y zeolite has typical microporous structure and three-dimensional channels. Due to its adjustable acidity, high surface area, and thermal/hydrothermal stabilities, Y zeolite has been widely used in many reactions such as fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) [2], hydrocracking [3], alkylation [4] and desulfurization [5]. However, with the crude oil supplies becoming severe and inferior, the micropore of conventional Y zeolite set severe limitation on the diffusion of large-molecule reactants and products [6]. Moreover, the porthole is easily blocked up with the bigger molecules in severe and inferior feedstock, which deactivates the FCC catalyst quickly and reduces the conversion of feedstock. Nanosized zeolite and hierarchical (i.e., micro-, mesoporous) materials can substantially increase the external surface area and shorten the diffusion path length in micropores [7, 8]. Therefore, various strategies {{have been developed to}} obtain extra-large-pore zeolites [9, 10], nanosized zeolites [11, 12, 13] and hierarchical zeolites [14, 15, 16]. For Y zeolite, two approaches have been developed to obtain hierarchical structures, involving direct synthesis using dual templates [17] and post-treatment of Y zeolite by desilication or dealumination using acid or alkali. Hierarchical Y zeolite by acid dealumination has enhanced thermal/hydrothermal stabilities along with the extraction of Al atoms from zeolite lattices [18, 19]. In contrast, desilication of Y zeolite by alkali can generate enough defects and rich mesoporosity in inner zeolite [20]. Various acid and basic agents such as phosphoric acid, citric acid, <b>ammonium</b> <b>fluorosilicate</b> and NaOH have been adopted to modify Y and ZSM- 5 zeolites in our previous studies [21, 22, 23, 24]. However, one obvious drawback of post-treatment is the great reduction of crystallinity which decreases the structural stability. Therefore, it is a challenge to generate more mesopores on Y zeolite while maintaining its high crystallinity. In this study, the combined action of citric acid and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt (EDTA- 2 Na) was adopted to modify USY zeolite to create hierarchical USY with high surface area.|$|E
