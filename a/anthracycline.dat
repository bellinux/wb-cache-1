40|$|Since the {{genotoxicity}} of many antitumor agents is {{an important}} problem in modern cancer chemotherapy, we studied with <b>anthracyclines</b> the possibility that antitumor properties can be separated from genotoxicity. We previously demonstrated that N-alkylation of the primary amino group in the daunosamine moiety abolishes the genotoxicity of <b>anthracyclines</b> without influencing their antitumor properties. <b>Anthracyclines</b> are known to intercalate into the cellular DNA and DNA-strand breaks are induced by interaction of topoisomerase 2 with the intercalation complex. We now demonstrate that in V 79 cells <b>anthracyclines</b> with a primary amino group induce DNA-strand breaks, whereas N-alkylated <b>anthracyclines</b> are inactive. These data are in excellent correlation with the mutagenicity of these compounds at the HGPRT genelocus, suggesting that the DNA-strand break induction {{is involved in the}} mutagenic activity. We also studied the induction of DNA-strand breaks in vitro with isolated calf thymus topo isomerase 2 and pBR 322 DNA. Contrary to the results in V 79 cells, all investigated <b>anthracyclines</b> induced strand breaks.

Methods We conducted a broad search strategy of major electronic databases. We performed a meta- analysis of adverse effects on randomized controlled trials comparing liposomal formulation and conventional <b>anthracyclines</b> on different tumors. The primary outcome was the adverse effects including congestive heart failure (CHF), hematological toxicity, palmar-plantar erythrodysthesias (PPE), alopecia, nausea and vomiting. The odds ratios of the adverse effects were calculated separately and the overall odds ratio of the pooled data was calculated. Results We identified nine randomized controlled trials comparing liposomal formulations and conventional <b>anthracyclines.</b> The study included 2220 patients, of which 1112 patients were treated with liposomal formulations and 1108 were treated with conventional <b>anthracyclines.</b> We found that the liposomal formulations have low incidence of CHF(OR 0. 34, 95 % CI, 0. 24 â€“ 0. 47), alopecia (OR 0. 0. 25, 95 % CI, 0. 0. 10 - 0. 62), neutropenia (OR 0. 62, 95 % CI, 0. 45 - 0. 85),(OR 0. 89, 95 % CI, 0. 71 - 1. 125), and thrombocytopenia (OR 0. 87, 95 % CI, 0. 61 - 1. 25). The incidence of PPE was similar in both arms (OR 1. 08, 95 % CI, 0. 11 - 10. 30). Conclusions Liposomal doxorubicin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin demonstrated favorable toxicity profiles with better cardiac safety and less myelosuppression, alopecia, nausea and vomiting compared with the conventional <b>anthracyclines.</b> The better therapeutic index of liposomal <b>anthracyclines</b> without compromising the efficacy makes it a favorable choice over conventional <b>anthracyclines</b> in elderly patients, patients with risk factors for cardiac disease and patients with prior use of <b>anthracyclines.</b> </p...|$|R

The aim of this meta-analysis was to assess associations between obesity or being overweight and cardiotoxicity from <b>anthracyclines</b> and sequential <b>anthracyclines</b> and trastuzumab in patients with breast cancer. MethodsWe performed a random-effects analysis and a network meta-analysis and assessed publication bias. We included 15 studies and 8, 745 patients with breast cancers who were treated with <b>anthracyclines</b> and sequential <b>anthracyclines</b> and trastuzumab. ResultsCombination of obesity and being overweight was significantly associated with {{a greater risk of}} developing cardiotoxicity after <b>anthracyclines</b> and a sequential <b>anthracyclines</b> and trastuzumab regimen in patients with breast cancer. Pooled odds ratio for cardiotoxicity was 1. 38 (95 % CI, 1. 06 to 1. 80; I- 2 = 43 %; N = 8, 745) for overweight or obesity (body mass index. 25 kg/m(2)), 1. 47 (95 % CI, 0. 95 to 2. 28; I- 2 = 47 %; n = 2, 615) for obesity, and 1. 15 (95 % CI, 0. 83 to 1. 58; I- 2 = 27 %; n = 2, 708) for overweight. Associations were independent of study design, year of publication, drug regimen (<b>anthracyclines</b> alone v sequential <b>anthracyclines</b> and trastuzumab), or definitions of cardiotoxicity and of overweight or obesity. There was no evidence of publication bias; however, we could not separate the contributions of obesity-related cardiovascular risk factors, such as diabetes and hypertension, from that of obesity itself in this largely unadjusted analysis.

Information about weight, clinical and personal factors was retrieved from medical records of breast cancer patients treated with chemotherapy between 2001 and 2010 in 4 different hospitals. Results Body weight information was complete in n = 483 patients (66 %). There was substantial between-patients variability in weight change during chemotherapy: within the upper quintile of weight change, median weight gain was + 6 kg, while in the bottom quintile median weight loss was of - 3 kg. Adjusted multivariate regression analysis showed that change in weight differed between types of chemotherapy: women treated with <b>anthracyclines</b> + taxanes gained + 0. 9 kg (95 %CI 0. 1, 1. 7) more than women treated with <b>anthracyclines</b> only.

40|$|Background One of {{the most}} {{important}} adverse effects of <b>anthracyclines</b> is cardiotoxicity. A well-informed decision on the use of <b>anthracyclines</b> in the treatment of childhood cancers should be based on evidence regarding both antitumour efficacy and cardiotoxicity. Objectives To compare antitumour efficacy of treatment including or not including <b>anthracyclines</b> in children with childhood cancer. Search strategy We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1966 to March 2010) and EMBASE (1980 to March 2010). In addition, we searched reference lists of relevant articles, conference proceedings and ongoing trials databases. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing treatment of any type of childhood cancer with and without <b>anthracyclines</b> and reporting outcomes concerning antitumour efficacy. Data collection and analysis Two reviewers independently performed the study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. Main results We identified RCTs for six types of tumour: acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) (three trials; 912 children), Wilms' tumour (one trial; 316 children), rhabdomyosarcoma/undifferentiated sarcoma (one trial; 413 children), Ewing's sarcoma (one trial; 94 children), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (one trial; 284 children) and hepatoblastoma (one trial; 255 children). All studies had methodological limitations. For ALL no evidence of a significant difference in antitumour efficacy was identified in the meta-analyses, but in most individual studies there was a suggestion of better antitumour efficacy in patients treated with <b>anthracyclines.</b> For both Wilms' tumour and Ewing's sarcoma a significant difference in event-free and overall survival in favour of treatment with <b>anthracyclines</b> was identified, although for Wilms' tumour the significant difference in overall survival disappears with long-term follow-up. For rhabdomyosarcoma/undifferentiated sarcoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and hepatoblastoma no difference in antitumour efficacy between the treatment groups was identified. Clinical cardiotoxicity was evaluated in three RCTs: no significant difference between both treatment groups was identified, but in all individual studies there was a suggestion of a lower rate of clinical cardiotoxicity in patients who did not receive <b>anthracyclines.</b> None of the studies evaluated asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction.
