5|$|Discussions {{over the}} sale of the Su-35 proved {{protracted}} due to concerns over intellectual property rights. Since China had reverse engineered the Su-27SK and Su-33 to create the J-11B and J-15, respectively, there were concerns that China would copy the airframe and offer the copied design on the export market. At one stage Rosoboronexport demanded that China provided a legally-binding guarantee against copying. However, industry sources believed that Chinese industry was interested in the AL-41FS1 engine and Irbis-E radar. According to The Diplomat, China was specifically interested in the engine of the Su-35, as the country was already test flying the J-11D. While the aircraft reportedly has less range, payload and manoeuvrability than the Su-35, the J-11D has an <b>active</b> <b>electronically-scanned</b> <b>array</b> radar, instead of the less-advanced PESA radar as found on the Su-35. Various reports have drawn attention to the need for Chinese industry to close the technological gap between its engine industry and those of the US, Europe and Russia.|$|E

Pakistani Air Force officials have described it as a [...] "fourth generation plus" [...] fighter jet. According to unconfirmed media reports the induction is expected to start around 2019. As of September 2016, the design of the JF-17 Block III has been finalized. The PAF is expected to place an order for 50 JF-17 Block-III fighter jets {{in the first half of}} 2017.|$|E
40|$|Advanced Thermal Management Materials"" {{provides}} a comprehensive and hands-on treatise {{on the importance}} of thermal packaging in high performance systems. These systems, ranging from <b>active</b> <b>electronically-scanned</b> radar <b>arrays</b> to web servers, require components that can dissipate heat efficiently. This requires materials capable of dissipating heat and maintaining compatibility with the packaging and dye. Its coverage includes all aspects of thermal management materials, both traditional and non-traditional, with an emphasis on metal based materials. An in-depth discussion of properties and...|$|R
500|$|The Su-35 {{employs the}} {{powerful}} N035 Irbis-E ("Snow Leopard") passive <b>electronically-scanned</b> <b>array</b> (PESA) radar, {{which is a}} further development of the N011M radar that had been evaluated on Su-27M test-beds and constitutes {{the core of the}} Su-35's weapons-control system. It is capable of detecting an aerial target up to [...] away, and can track thirty airborne targets and engage eight of them simultaneously; in addition, the multi-function radar is capable of providing high-resolution images of the ground using synthetic aperture mode. The aircraft is equipped with an OLS-35 optoelectronic targeting system ahead of the cockpit to provide other forms of tracking including infra-red search and track. For defences against enemy tracking, the Su-35 is equipped with the L175M Khibiny-M electronic countermeasure system, while engineers have applied radar-absorbent materials to the engine inlets and front stages of the engine compressor to halve the Su-35's frontal radar cross-section and minimise the detection range of enemy radars. The multi-role Su-35 can deploy air-to-air missiles of up to [...] range, and can carry the heavy Oniks anti-ship cruise missile, as well as the multitude of air-to-ground weaponry.|$|R

40|$|PR- 2) is a dual {{frequency}} (14 and 35 GHz), dual polarization radar system concept with substantially increased capabilities compared to today's instruments (TRMM). Dual frequency and polarization capability enhance rain retrieval accuracy and adaptive wide-swath scanning greatly increases areal coverage. The system concept is built upon a novel 5 -m inflatable cylindrical reflector fed by an <b>electronically-scanned</b> phased <b>array</b> feed. A prototype subarray {{of the full}} 368 -element feed array is being developed under the NASA ESTO ATI program. This 35 GHz subarray combines eight 1 watt transmitter channels and 16 receiver channels into a module that is 4. 2 cm wide. Compact orthomode transducers and square waveguide apertures are used to feed a pair of flared, corrugated plates. This technique along with state-of-the-art mm-wave MMICs and innovative packaging yields a robust, high-performance and relatively low-cost subarray. I...|$|R
