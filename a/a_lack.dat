40|$|BACKGROUND: Evidence {{continues}} to accumulate that oxidative stress is etiologically {{important in the}} pathogenesis of age-related maculopathy (ARM) and that appropriate antioxidants of dietary origin may protect against this condition. OBJECTIVE: Risk factors for ARM may be classed as established or putative. We report a study designed to investigate whether such risk factors are associated with <b>a</b> dietary <b>lack</b> of antioxidants relevant to retinal health. DESIGN: Dietary, anthropometric, and sociodemographic details relating to 828 healthy Irish subjects aged 20 - 60 y were recorded in a cross-sectional fashion and analyzed for associations between risk factors for ARM and dietary intake of relevant nutrients. RESULTS: Of the established risk factors for ARM, increasing age was associated with <b>a</b> relative <b>lack</b> of dietary zeaxanthin (P < 0. 05) and tobacco use with <b>a</b> relative <b>lack</b> of dietary vitamin C (P < 0. 05). Of the putative risk factors for ARM, alcohol consumption was associated with <b>a</b> relative <b>lack</b> of dietary alpha-linoleic acid (P < 0. 05), and female sex was associated with <b>a</b> relative <b>lack</b> of dietary zinc (P < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: We showed that several variables related to risk for ARM are associated with <b>a</b> relative dietary <b>lack</b> of key nutrients. Our finding that age, {{the most important and}} universal risk factor for ARM, is associated with <b>a</b> relative <b>lack</b> of dietary zeaxanthin, is an important finding that warrants further investigation...|$|R
