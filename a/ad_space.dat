In August 2000 Nupedia had more than 60 {{academics}} contributing to the peer-review process on the site, most with doctor of philosophy or doctor of medicine degrees. Scholars wishing to contribute to Nupedia were required to submit their credentials via fax for verification.

40|$|Abstract—Ad exchanges {{are kind}} {{of the most popular}} online {{advertising}} marketplaces for trading <b>ad</b> <b>spaces</b> over the Internet. Ad exchanges run auctions to sell the <b>ad</b> <b>spaces</b> on publishers’ web-pages to advertisers, who want to display ads on the <b>ad</b> <b>spaces.</b> However, the parties in the auction cannot check whether the auction is carried out correctly or not. Furthermore, the advertisers are usually not willing to reveal their sensitive information when participating in the auction. In this paper, we jointly consider the auction verifiability and advertisers’ privacy preservation, and propose ERA, which is an Efficient, pRivacy-preserving, and verifiAble online auction mechanism for ad exchanges. ERA exploits an Order Preserving Encryption Scheme (OPES) to guarantee privacy-preservation, and achieves verifiability by integrating a Certified Bulletin Board (CBB) and a protocol of Privacy-Preserving Integer Comparison (PPIC), which is based on the Paillier’s Homomorphic Encryption Scheme (PHES). We extensively evaluate the performance of ERA, and our evaluation results show that ERA satisfies the properties of verifiability and privacy-preservation with low overhead, so ERA can be easily deployed in today’s ad exchanges.

In 24 hours, the trailer had been viewed over 2 million times. Tancharoen also stated that Season 2 would not affect his development of the feature film.

500|$|Historians of The New York Times—including Gay Talese, Susan Tifft and Alex S. Jones—have {{argued that}} the Times, faced with {{newsprint}} rationing during World War II, decided to increase its news coverage {{at the expense of}} its advertising, while the Herald Tribune chose to run more ads, trading short-term profit for long-term difficulties. [...] In The Kingdom and the Power, Talese's 1969 book about the Times, Talese wrote [...] "the additional space that The Times was able to devote to war coverage instead of advertising was, in the long run, a very profitable decision: The Times lured many readers away from the Tribune, and these readers stayed with The Times after the war into the Nineteen-fifties and Sixties". [...] Although The New York Times had the most comprehensive coverage of any American newspaper—the newspaper put 55 correspondents in the field, including drama critic Brooks Atkinson—its news budget fell from $3.8 million in 1940 to $3.7 million in 1944; the paper did not significantly expand its number of newsroom employees between 1937 and 1945 and its <b>ad</b> <b>space,</b> far from declining, actually increased during the conflict and was consistently ahead of the Herald Tribunes. [...] Between 1941 and 1945, advertising space in the Times increased from 42.58 percent of the paper to 49.68 percent, while the Tribune saw its <b>ad</b> <b>space</b> increase from 37.58 percent to 49.32 percent. [...] In 1943 and 1944, more than half the Times went to advertising, a percentage the Herald Tribune did not meet until after the war. [...] However, because the Tribune was generally a smaller paper than the Times and saw its <b>ad</b> <b>space</b> jump more, [...] "the proportionate increase in the Tribune seemed greater than it was in absolute terms. [...] The evidence that this disproportionate increase in the Tribunes advertising content left its readers feeling deprived of war news coverage and sent them in droves to the Times is, at best, highly ambiguous." ...|$|E

Among the contents are fictional book chapters, letters, reports, and articles written by various Watchmen characters. DC had trouble selling <b>ad</b> <b>space</b> in issues of Watchmen, which left an extra eight to nine pages per issue. DC planned to insert house ads and a longer letters column to fill the space, but editor Len Wein felt this would be unfair to anyone who wrote in during the last four issues of the series. He decided to use the extra pages to fill out the series' backstory. Moore said, [...] "By the time we got around to issue #3, #4, and so on, we thought that the book looked nice without a letters page. It looks less like a comic book, so we stuck with it." ...|$|E

40|$|Future space {{missions}} are envisioned {{to be implemented}} using a flexible, distributed architecture consisting of constellations of dynamically deployed or configured space and mobile platforms that are networked together into an integrated information system, which we term an <b>ad</b> hoc <b>space</b> network. An <b>ad</b> hoc <b>space</b> network is characterized by changing topology and potentially sparse and intermittent connectivity, which pose unique challenges to routing. In this paper we describe a flexible routing architecture for <b>ad</b> hoc <b>space</b> networks, consisting of an interrogation-based relay routing mechanism and an attribute-based naming (AN) and intentional routing (IR) scheme. The interrogation-based relay routing mechanism allows satellites to buffer data and to interrogate each other {{so as to make}} intelligent routing decisions. The AN and IR scheme facilitate mission-specific routing capability. We present a simulation study of the effects of buffer space, satellite density, and orbital patterns on the throughput of the interrogation-based relay routing mechanism...|$|R

[...] By 2006, the site was utilizing advertising networks to sell <b>ad</b> <b>space.</b> [...] Though he was dissatisfied with the aesthetic integration of advertising with his site design, the income (initially $500 a month) did begin to cover all of Brazelton's varied associated costs.

We linked 2000 census data with property data at the census block group level to investigate two neighborhood-level determinants of ad density: income level and physical decay. Results showed that block groups were exposed to an average of four <b>ad</b> <b>spaces</b> per 1, 000 residents and that vacant lot square footage was a significant positive predictor of ad density. An inverse relationship between median household income and ad density did not reach significance, suggesting that relative affluence did not protect black neighborhoods from being targeted for outdoor advertisements...|$|R
