Nonuniform browning patterns of ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) pottants were observed for glass/EVA/glass-encapsulated c-Si cell samples under solar simulator exposures at elevated temperatures. The polymer/polymer-configured laminates with Tedlar or Tefzel did not discolor because of photobleaching reactions, but yellowed with polyester or nylon top films. Delamination was observed for the polyester/EVA layers on a-Si minimodules and for a polyolefin-based thermoplastic pottant at high temperatures. For all tested c-Si cell samples, irregular changes in the current-voltage parameters were observed that could not be accounted for simply by the transmittance changes of the superstrate/pottant layers. Silicone-type adhesives used under UV-transmitting polymer top films were observed to cause greater cell current/efficiency loss than EVA or polyethylene pottants...|$|E
40|$|Reinforcing {{steel in}} {{concrete}} {{has been used}} for many years in roads, bridges and other structures to give strength and durability; concrete has only good compressive strength and reinforcing steel gives the tensile strength to the concrete to sustain both the compressive and tensile load, making concrete structures {{to be used in the}} common as well as critical areas. Reinforcing steel that was used in structures predominantly is mild steel, which is considerably cheaper than stainless steel, and more susceptible to corrosion leading to the damage of the structures and less longevity. To solve the problem with the use of mild steel in critical areas, such as bridges; stainless steel is used; which has iron as the main constituents along with the chromium as the major alloying element and various grades are manufactured varying the compositions of steel. To reduce the cost of the stainless steel, some compositions like chromium, molybdenum, nickel are varied; especially the nickel is being replaced by manganese, the cost of which is significantly less than that of nickel. The alternative grades of the reinforcing steel that were used for testing the corrosion resistance are mild steel (400), weldable mild steel (400 W) and four stainless steel 316 LN, UNS 24100 (Enduramet 32), 2304, LDX 2101; among them 316 LN and UNS 24100 are the austenitic steels (Valbruna) and 2304 and LDX 2101 are duplex steels (Outokumpu). The austenitic steels have no ferritic phase which is making austenitic steel more corrosion resistance than the duplex steels which have almost equal parts of the ferritic and austenitic phases. Concrete that is used commonly as the shield for the reinforcing steel providing the environment to passivate the reinforcement. Concrete has the pH of ~ 13. 5 which is the equivalent to the pH of the pore solution. Its strength and curing time varies due to the water cement ratio and composition and also the environment in which it is placed. Good quality concrete has less permeability and fewer cracks thereby limiting the ingress of the de-icing slats to the reinforcing steel and delaying the onset of corrosion. Corrosion of the reinforcing steels was tested in concrete using both an <b>accelerated</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>test</b> and ASTM A 955 M standard for cracked prisms to measure the corrosion rate and open circuit potential, which are quantitative measurement for corrosion. It is hoped that the results will provide a guide for the future use of the alternative grades of the reinforcing steel to be used in the concrete. Reinforcing mild steels were compared to determine if there is any advantage in using the more carefully controlled 400 W welding grade, rather than the 400 grade. The service life of structures with the 400 grade of steel is well established and so the data from the 400 grade also provided a relative measure of corrosion resistance for the alternative grades of the stainless steel. Microcell corrosion of the reinforcing steel was monitored by the use of the linear polarization and the corrosion potential. The data for show that there is no significant corrosion on any of the stainless steels after 15 months of measurement, whereas both the mild steels embedded in the concrete corroded fully as confirmed by visual observation of the beams after autopsying The autopsied samples were then analysed for chloride content in the concrete adjacent to the reinforcing bars. This was accomplished by titration. The chloride content on the beams with 400 and 400 W grades was found to be higher than the beams with the stainless steels, where the percentage of chloride remained almost the same. Macrocell corrosion tests were performed on the ASTM A 955 M cracked prisms and showed changes in corrosion current density in agreement with the accelerated corrosion current density of the stainless steels. The only difference was observed in the corrosion potentials of the 400 and 400 W steels, which were more negative in the cracked prisms than in the beams. In summary, all the stainless steels showed evident corrosion resistance both in accelerated and ASTM A 955 M prisms tests and no sign of corrosion was found in the stainless steels after 400 days in beams and 200 days in prisms. The regular and weldable steels corroded in both tests in agreement with the data present in research...|$|E

Multi-circular defects 1 mm in diameter were also created in the specimens. The test results indicate that the mean and maximum corrosion depths increased with increasing diameter of the single defect of the coated steel plate.

40|$|Reflectors are a {{vital part}} of a concentrating solar thermal power plant. One of their most {{important}} characteristics is their durability, which entails the maintenance of their optical properties throughout their service lifetime, aimed at 10 - 30 years or more. The assessment of their optical durability involves the design of two types of aging <b>tests,</b> outdoor <b>exposure</b> <b>testing</b> under real ambient conditions and <b>accelerated</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>testing</b> in weathering chambers under simulated conditions. After exposure to different stress factors for certain periods of time, the optical performance of reflectors is evaluated mainly in terms of reflectance, but also regarding qualitative parameters such as their visual appearance and degradations patterns. The ultimate goal of a durability study is to conceive meaningful accelerated testing procedures that simulate real outdoor degradation in a short time and provide service lifetime estimates for a certain type of reflector at a specific site. to achieve this, more research on service lifetime prediction should be conducted and the standardization of accelerated testing procedures and reflectance evaluation methods should become widespread, to obtain comparable representative results.

40|$|Durability {{testing of}} a variety of {{candidate}} solar reflector materials at outdoor test sites and in laboratory accelerated weathering chambers is the main activity within the Advanced Materials task of the Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) Program. Outdoor <b>exposure</b> <b>testing</b> (OET) at up to eight outdoor, worldwide exposure sites has been underway for several years. This includes collaboration {{under the auspices of the}} International Energy Agency (IEA) Solar Power and Chemical Energy Systems (SolarPACES) agreement. Outdoor sites are fully instrumented in terms of monitoring meteorological conditions and solar irradiance. Candidate materials are optically characterized prior to being subjected to exposure in real and simulated weathering environments. Optical durability is quantified by periodically re-measuring hemispherical and specular reflectance as a function of exposure time. By closely monitoring the site- and time-dependent environmental stress conditions experienced by the material samples, site-dependent loss of performance may be quantified.

However, it is also known that rubber performance drops due to the ageing effect. Many problems are still not clear, for example, how does the property of hdr material change over the time, which environmental factor dominates the degradation of hdr, in what way does ageing progress from the surface to {{the interior of the}} hdr bearing, and what influence does ageing produce on the mechanical performance of hdr bridge bearing. In order to solve these problems, in this study a series of <b>accelerated</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>tests</b> are carried out on hdr pieces and blocks. Firstly, different degradation factors such as thermal oxidation, ultraviolet, ozone, low temperature ozone, salt water and acid rain are applied to hdr specimens.

Then, thermal oxidation tests are performed on hdr blocks at various elevated temperatures and the development of the property profiles is investigated. An aging model for hdr bearing is developed to predict the mechanical behaviors at any position inside the bearing. Next, based on the predicted material properties, fem analysis is carried out using the constitutive law. Finally, the long-term performance of aged hdr bearing is clarified.

40|$|Concentrated {{solar power}} systems are {{expected}} to be sited in desert locations where the direct normal irradiation is above 1800 kWh/m 2. year. These systems include large solar collector assemblies, which account for a significant share of the investment cost. Solarreflectors are the main components of these solar collector assemblies and dust/sand storms may affect their reflectance properties, either by soiling or by surface abrasion. While soiling can be reverted by cleaning, surface abrasion is a non reversible degradation. The aim of this project was to study the accelerated aging of second surface silvered thickglass solar reflectors under simulated sandstorm conditions and develop a multi-parametric model which relates the specular reflectance loss to dust/sand storm parameters: wind velocity, dust concentration and time of exposure. This project focused on the degradation caused by surface abrasion. Sandstorm conditions were simulated in a prototype environmental test chamber. Material samples (6 cm x 6 cm) were exposed to Arizona coarse test dust. The dust stream impactedthese material samples at a perpendicular angle. Both wind velocity and dust concentrationwere maintained at a stable level for each accelerated aging <b>test.</b> The total <b>exposure</b> time in the test chamber was limited to 1 hour. Each accelerated aging test was interrupted every 4 minutes to measure the specular reflectance of the material sample after cleaning. The accelerated aging test campaign had to be aborted prematurely due to a contamination of the dust concentration sensor. A robust multi-parametric degradation model could thus not be derived. The experimental data showed that the specular reflectance loss decreasedeither linearly or exponentially with exposure time, so that a degradation rate could be defined as a single modeling parameter. A correlation should be derived to relate this degradation rate to control parameters such as wind velocity and dust/sand concentration. The sandstorm chamber design would have to be updated before performing further accelerated aging test campaigns. The design upgrade should improve both the reliability of the test equipment and the repeatability of accelerated aging <b>tests.</b> An outdoor <b>exposure</b> <b>test</b> campaign should be launched in deserts {{to learn more about the}} intensity, frequencyand duration of dust/sand storms.

40|$|Traditional coil {{coated steel}} product {{consists}} of two layers of coating, which are applied {{on top of a}} pretreated hot-dip-galvanized steel coil. In other fields of industry the TOC coating method is quite widely used and it has attracted attentions also in the coil coating industry. The economically and environmentally sound alternative designed to replace the traditional pretreatment and the base coating layer has increased research and development of the TOC method. 	Thin organic coatings in coil coating applications have been studied quite scarcely in SSAB. This thesis {{is a part of the}} HYBRIDS – Hybrid Materials program, which studies among other subjects the potential of the TOC-method. In this thesis the goal was to optimize a coating layer on top of two separate TOC-substrates. The objective of the thesis was to find the most suitable binder, film thickness and curing cycle combination for the first coating layer of the TOC based product. The chemistry of the studied binders was mainly based on polyester and PVdF chemistry. With isocyanate crosslinked binder system, a polyurethane-chemistry based binder was also introduced to the studies. With all of the previously mentioned binder systems, the film thicknesses and curing cycles were varied to test a wide variety of property combinations. 	The optimization started with the results of the <b>accelerated</b> environment <b>exposure</b> <b>testing,</b> with which the first elimination of binders was based. The mechanical testing data was analyzed with statistical method ANOVA. With the statistical analyzing method the most potential binder, film thickness and curing cycle for each TOC was selected from both of the binder categories. The final products were compared to reference samples, which were treated with the same paint process. The samples used for the references were traditionally pretreated and untreated HDG-steels. The final conclusions on the optimized products were done based on <b>accelerated</b> environment <b>exposure</b> <b>testing</b> and mechanical testing. 	With the optimization process a clear indication was observed, that the film thickness variations and binder selection affects the properties of the product significantly. The thickest dry films performed with best results. A significant difference was not observed with the curing cycles, but marginally better results were observed with double curing with the TOC 2 substrate. 70 % PVdF / 30 % PMMA ratio binders performed with best results with both of the TOC substrates. TOC 2 had significant difficulties with polyester-chemistry, which led to a series of separate studies. Isocyanate (instead of melamine) crosslinked binder worked perfectly with the said substrate. 	<b>Accelerated</b> humidity <b>exposure</b> <b>testing</b> results and mechanical resistance testing results reveal a significant importance of the pretreatment or TOC-layer. HDG steel with any sort of binder suffers a significant amount of damage and deterioration during exposure to humidity in elevated temperatures. Mechanical resistance results show a similar trend. The traditionally pretreated samples and TOC based samples, when compared against each other, showed notable but not significant differences on behalf of the TOC based samples. A conclusion from the testing in this thesis is that the TOC based product can perform at least as well as the traditionally pretreated product. Although the results are quite encouraging and positive for the TOC based products, the results are not unequivocal and can only be considered as a guideline towards future studies and research projects...|$|R

Thus, the results of outdoor <b>exposure</b> <b>tests</b> conducted at specific sites are not applicable to sites with different weather conditions.|$|R
30|$|Outdoor <b>exposure</b> <b>test</b> {{is one of}} the {{standard}} methods for evaluating the durability of wood-based boards. As a test specimen is exposed in a natural weathering environment for a long-term period, the deterioration of the test specimen strongly depends on the climate conditions of the exposure locations. Consequently, the results of the outdoor <b>exposure</b> <b>tests</b> conducted at specific locations are not generally applicable to locations with different climate conditions. This is a disadvantage of outdoor <b>exposure</b> <b>test.</b>|$|R
30|$|Outdoor <b>exposure</b> <b>tests</b> {{have many}} {{disadvantages}} including the time consumed {{and the difficulty}} in implementing them. In addition, results from outdoor <b>exposure</b> <b>tests</b> are confounded with the test location [15]. In contrast, short-term tests assess changes in mechanical properties after accelerated aging treatments, such as water immersion, boiling, steaming, freezing, or drying. The results of outdoor <b>exposure</b> <b>tests</b> are sometimes used as basic indicators when selecting among standardized test methods [16, 17]. In Japan, to evaluate the durability of wood-based panels, outdoor <b>exposure</b> <b>tests</b> at eight sites using commercial wood-based panels have been conducted by the Research Working Group on Wood-based Panels of the Japan Research Society since 2004. In our previous reports, we discussed the results of 5 -year exposure in Shizuoka City and standardized accelerated aging tests [18 – 20].|$|R
30|$|Outdoor <b>exposure</b> <b>tests</b> {{are used}} to assess the {{durability}} of wood-based boards (boards). In North America, outdoor <b>exposure</b> <b>tests</b> have been conducted on boards [1 – 3]. However, in Japan, these tests have rarely been conducted [4]. Therefore, outdoor <b>exposure</b> <b>tests</b> started in 2004 as part of a project organized by the Research Working Group on Wood-based Panels from the Japan Wood Research Society. The boards used were particleboard, oriented strand board (strandboard), and medium-density fiberboard (fiberboard). Our research group [5 – 12], Kojima et al. [13 – 16], and Sekino et al. [17] recently reported the results.|$|R
40|$|The {{choice of}} {{materials}} and components used {{in the manufacture of}} photovoltaic modules can affect their safety, performance, durability and reliability. The materials and design of the components used to produce a photovoltaic module {{play a critical role in}} protecting the module from the outdoor environment. Material performance properties are described and their impact on photovoltaic module performance and reliability are discussed. These critical properties include the mechanical, optical, electrical, thermal characteristics and the durability of these properties under relevant <b>accelerated</b> <b>exposure</b> conditions. Results of <b>accelerated</b> <b>exposure</b> on materials and modules are presented. Accelerated test conditions to establish material durability and the relationship of these accelerated conditions to both the outdoor environment and cumulative degradation over the expected module lifetime are discussed. The measurement and characterization {{of materials and}} modules removed from the service environment will be discussed. A review of the characterization strategies that have been found useful for module and subsequent materials evaluation will also be presented. JRC. F. 7 -Renewable Energ...|$|R

40|$|Oxobiodegradable {{agriculture}} mulch films {{made from}} polyethylene (PE) {{are known to}} have many benefits for agriculture practice, including increased yields and resource efficiency, without the drawback of removing the film after the growing season. However, anecdotal evidence suggested when pesticides are applied to these films, their rate of degradation may be affected. The goal of this investigation was to characterize the delay in degradation that occurs when pesticides are applied to oxobiodegradable agriculture mulch films. Two pesticides, Pyrinex 480 and Round Up, were tested in the field and laboratory environment to determine the effects on degradation with normal and <b>accelerated</b> <b>exposure</b> conditions for the films. <b>Exposure</b> <b>tests</b> indicated the pesticides were having stabilizing effects on the PE films, delaying degradation. Therefore, tests were designed to explore the chemical mechanisms underlying each pesticide?s stabilizing influence. These included experimental and computational measurements of redox potential to define chain breaking donor and chain breaking acceptor capacities of the pesticides. UV (ultraviolet) screener capacity of the pesticides was also investigated. We concluded that Pyrinex 480 likely has the ability to absorb UV energy that would normally break bonds in PE, along with some other capacity to stabilize degradation, such as the ability to accept electrons. In contrast, Round Up likely donates electrons or atoms to prevent degradation reactions and stabilize PE films...|$|R
