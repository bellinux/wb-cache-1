A survey for the introgressive haplotypes across many Sub-Saharan populations suggest that this admixture event happened with archaic hominins who once inhabited Central Africa.|$|E

These factors are not only individual accounting entries, but also analytical inputs as the internal company processes, management of costs or short-term financial decisions and specifically {{in the case of}} agriculture within the EU also the public subsidy schemes implemented through the EU Common <b>Agricultural</b> Policy. <b>Groups</b> of <b>agricultural</b> producers are created as a response to current market dynamics and the opportunity for each agricultural enterprise regardless the size. In this paper, the basis for agricultural cooperation is provided, traditional economic performance measures are presented and their applicability on the sample of <b>agricultural</b> producers’ <b>groups</b> and wholesale entities is empirically verified. Wholesale entities are analysed by its business activity and performance features to consider whether they are suitable peer group for comparing economic performance of examined <b>agricultural</b> producers’ <b>group.</b> Since the economic performance of <b>agricultural</b> producers’ <b>groups</b> directly affects the economic performance of all participating entities, and vice versa, their economic performance measurement may involve specific constraints. According to the structure and characteristics of <b>agricultural</b> producers’ <b>groups</b> may be inferred that whilst the common performance measurement techniques are applicable on the majority of companies, <b>agricultural</b> producers’ <b>groups</b> represent specific entities and therefore need adjusted performance measurement approach...|$|R
