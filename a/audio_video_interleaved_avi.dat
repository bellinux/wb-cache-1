After preprocessing of the original image sequence, which is sampled from the video camera, the target moving object is detected with the improved algorithm in which the moving object region can be extracted completely through several processing of background extraction and Minimal Graph Cuts Segmentation. Among the multiple moving objects of the video, the target object has been detected based on particular criteria of region that it occupies. Then the results of these processing can be used to determine the traveling speed of the target moving object from changes of its coordinate position from the video frames.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} video {{encryption}} algorithm using RSA and Pseudo Noise (PN) sequence, aimed at applications requiring sensitive video information transfers. The system is primarily {{designed to work}} with files encoded using the <b>Audio</b> <b>Video</b> <b>Interleaved</b> (<b>AVI)</b> codec, although it can be easily ported for use with Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) encoded files. The audio and video components of the source separately undergo two layers of encryption to ensure a reasonable level of security. Encryption of the video component involves applying the RSA algorithm followed by the PN-based encryption. Similarly, the audio component is first encrypted using PN and further subjected to encryption using the Discrete Cosine Transform. Combining these techniques, an efficient system, invulnerable to security breaches and attacks with favorable values of parameters such as encryption/decryption speed, encryption/decryption ratio and visual degradation; has been put forth. For applications requiring encryption of sensitive data wherein stringent security requirements are of prime concern, the system is found to yield negligible similarities in visual perception between the original and the encrypted video sequence. For applications wherein visual similarity is not of major concern, we limit the encryption task to a single level of encryption which is accomplished by using RSA, thereby quickening the encryption process. Although some similarity between the original and encrypted video is observed in this case, {{it is not enough}} to comprehend the happenings in the video.

40|$|Brief background: Image {{compression}} {{has been}} widely accepted as {{the solution to the}} explosion of imaging data since the advent of multiaxial multisequence imaging. However, compromise on diagnostic quality secondary to this modification has been an issue. Many studies have been carried out looking at just noticeable differences but few have been undertaken to look at the difference in ability to detect pathology in original versus cineloop compressed images. This study was done to compare lesion detection ability of cineloop compressed images as compared to original images. Objectives: A comparative study to evaluate detection of brain lesions in wavelet compressed <b>Audio</b> <b>video</b> <b>Interleave</b> (<b>AVI)</b> cineloop re-formatted MRI images as compared to originally acquired 16 bit digital MRI images. Methods: This was a prospective comparative study. MRI brain images of consecutive non-selected patients referred for MRI brain examinations were compressed by means of a wavelet algorithm at ratios of 30 : 1 (70 %) and then converted into Microsoft AVI cine loop format using Image J freeware(Appendix 3). All the sequences and all the sections of a particular examination (original and reformatted images) were reviewed on the same high resolution computer monitor by two independent reviewers (Appendix 2). Analysis: Each of the observers captured their findings in a pre-defined form then comparison of lesion detection was done taking the original images as a gold standard. Sensitivity were calculated for evaluation of number of lesions, location of lesions, signal characteristics and image quality. As compared to the original brain MRI images the sensitivities in the cineloop compressed images for presence of lesions was 100 %, Number of lesions present was 100 %, location of largest lesion was 97 %, T 1 signal was 96 %, T 2 signal was 96 %, GRE signal was 95 %, FLAIR signal was 93 %, Presence of restricted diffusion was 98 %, post contrast enhancement was 98 %, and edema surrounding lesion was 100 %. There was reduction of subjective image quality with 79 % of the compressed cineloop images scoring 1 less point than the original images. Outcomes: This study proves cineloop compressed images at a a ratio of 1 : 30 do not reduce ability to detect lesions in terms of size, number, locations and signals. Despite reduced quality of images, the diagnosis remains largely unchanged. Hence, image compression can be applied to MRI Brain imaging for interpretation allowing ease of teleradiology, reduced storage costs and increased transmission speeds...|$|R
