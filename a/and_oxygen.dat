5|$|Insect wing {{muscle is}} a {{strictly}} aerobic tissue. Per unit protein it consumes fuel <b>and</b> <b>oxygen</b> at rates {{taking place in}} a very concentrated and highly organized tissue so that the steady-state rates per unit volume represent an absolute record in biology. The fuel <b>and</b> <b>oxygen</b> rich blood is carried to the muscles through diffusion occurring in large amounts, {{in order to maintain}} the high level of energy used during flight. Many wing muscles are large and may be as large as 10mm in length and 2mm in width. Moreover, in some Diptera the fibres are of giant dimensions. For instance, in the very active Rutilia, the cross-section is 1800µm long and more than 500µm wide. The transport of fuel <b>and</b> <b>oxygen</b> from the surroundings to the sites of consumption and the reverse transport of carbon dioxide therefore represent a challenge to the biologist both in relation to transport in the liquid phase and in the intricate system of air tubes, i.e. in the tracheal system.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Long-term {{trends and}} spatial {{patterns}} of water quality at 5 {{stations in the}} upstream of the Daling River basin of North China were examined for 5 parameters—pH, suspended sediment (SS), dissolved oxygen (DO), permanganate demand (CODMn) <b>and</b> biochemical <b>oxygen</b> demand (BOD 5). Analysis determined the trends of parameters of each station between 1987 and 2007. The variations in permanganate demand <b>and</b> biochemical <b>oxygen</b> demand showed increasing trends and the variations in dissolved oxygen were decrease in 1990 s. Multi-year average values of permanganate demand <b>and</b> dissolved <b>oxygen</b> in Chaoyang station and Jianping station were 2. 8 mg/L, 37. 6 mg/L and 9. 6 mg/L, 6. 1 mg/L, respectively. The parameter characteristics of water quality in flood and dry season showed significant heterogeneity at main stream and tributary. Correlations between parameters were analyzed using a regression analysis method. The correlations of each parameter determined there were linear negative correlation between dissolved <b>oxygen</b> <b>and</b> permanganate demand, dissolved <b>oxygen</b> <b>and</b> biochemical <b>oxygen</b> demand at Habaqi station, Dachengzi station and Chaoyang station. The permanganate demand <b>and</b> biochemical <b>oxygen</b> demand was significant positive correlation in 3 stations...|$|R

Spatial dissolved <b>oxygen</b> <b>and</b> temperature variations {{measured in the}} stratified lake are presented to illustrate the horizontal uniformity {{of the lake and}} to demonstrate the applicability of the one dimensional assumption for sampling and theoretical modeling of temperature <b>and</b> dissolved <b>oxygen.</b> A nocturnal density overturning within the epilimnion was investigated and its significance as a mode of vertical mixing evaluated.

The typical seasonal patterns of water temperatures <b>and</b> dissolved <b>oxygen</b> concentrations in twenty-seven classes of Minnesota lakes have been simulated by calibrated models and related to observations of three fish guilds i. e, coldwater, coolwater, and warmwater fishes. Data from 3002 lakes were available in the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources lake database. Water temperature <b>and</b> dissolved <b>oxygen</b> criteria derived from a very large USEP A fish-temperature data base <b>and</b> dissolved <b>oxygen</b> observations were used to define and link simulated water temperatures <b>and</b> dissolved <b>oxygen</b> conditions to suitability of habitats for various species of fish.
