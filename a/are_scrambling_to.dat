60|$|She vanishes {{into the}} void; and again there is nothing: all {{existence}} seems suspended infinitely. Then, vaguely, {{there is a}} live human voice crying somewhere. One sees, with a shock, a mountain peak showing faintly against a lighter background. The sky has returned from afar; and we suddenly remember where we were. The cry becomes distinct and urgent: it says Automobile, Automobile. The complete reality comes back with a rush: in a moment it is full morning in the Sierra; and the brigands <b>are</b> <b>scrambling</b> <b>to</b> their feet and making for the road as the goatherd runs down from the hill, warning them of the approach of another motor. Tanner and Mendoza rise amazedly and stare at one another with scattered wits. Straker sits up to yawn {{for a moment before}} he gets on his feet, making it a point of honor not to show any undue interest in the excitement of the bandits. Mendoza gives a quick look to see that his followers are attending to the alarm; then exchanges a private word with Tanner.|$|E

50|$|The {{reconnaissance}} squadron {{is completely}} different from the armored cavalry formations {{of the cold war}} with massive armored and BFV units intended to engage massive armored threats. FM's are still being written on the doctrine. Many soldiers <b>are</b> <b>scrambling</b> <b>to</b> understand the new concepts of combined arms and the reconnaissance squadron. The criticisms of the IBCT RSTA include a lack of dismount capability in the mounted troops and an organizational framework that makes a poor compromise between stealth and economy of force, producing elements too heavy to conduct the traditional LRSD mission, but too weak to conduct the traditional cavalry mission.|$|E

50|$|Many {{institutions}} <b>are</b> <b>scrambling</b> <b>to</b> produce {{estimates of}} Downturn LGD, but often resort to 'mapping' since Downturn data is often lacking. Mapping {{is the process}} of guesstimating losses under a downturn by taking existing LGD and adding a supplement or buffer, which is supposed to represent a potential increase in LGD when Downturn occurs. LGD often decreases for some segments during Downturn since there is a relatively larger increase of defaults that result in higher cure-rates, often the result of temporary credit deterioration that disappears after the Downturn Period is over. Furthermore, LGD values decrease for defaulting financial institutions under economic Downturns because governments and central banks often rescue these institutions in order to maintain financial stability.|$|E
