On the slope grounds, as result of the gradient of the hill side, there is a permanent potential danger of starting erosion. Slope ditches and outlets were desinged as <b>antierosion</b> <b>works.</b> The determination of the compensation slope was carried out by verifying the velocity of water discharge resulting in case of the mechanical consolidation type by stone masonry a maximum slope of 7 % with a velocity of discharge of 4, 96 m/s, and in case of consolidation by grassing a slope of 0, 09 % at a velocity of 0, 9 m/s...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{studied the}} impact of {{unfavorable}} factors on agriculture land, pretability and measures to reduce negative consequences. Nowadays, there are about 40 anthropogenic factors of soil degradation, but the erosion is the main factor of soil cover degradation in the Republic of Moldova. This type of degradation is manifested from old times as a natural process depended on the accidental relief and torrential rains. The present quality state of the soil cover denotes that the fields with a high reliability note of 80 - 100 points occupy about 27 % of the total area of agricultural lands. The soils with medium reliability note of 70 points or less occupy 52 % from the total area of agricultural fields and are moderate degraded. The soil with low rating are completely destroyed by ravens and active earth flows with a surface of 178 thousand ha and have a very low productivity. The complex of measures and technologies regarding the conservation and the increase of eroded soils fertility includes: the antierosion organization of the territory; the formation of forest framing, including the protection curtains against the erosion provoked by waters and winds; recovering of the hardly eroded soils by grassing and foresting; settling ravens and earth flows by regulating water drainages, their and limitary field grassing and foresting, cultivation of field cultures in bands on the slopes; the formation of protection bands from perennial herbs; the implementation of antierosion crop rotations; the unconditioned apply of <b>antierosion</b> soil <b>works</b> on slopes, agrotechnical actions etc...|$|R
