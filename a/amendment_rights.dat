5|$|On March 22, 1982, the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey held (536 F. Supp. 317, (1982)) {{that the}} New Jersey statute was not unconstitutionally vague {{and did not}} impermissibly {{infringe}} on union members' First <b>Amendment</b> <b>rights.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Fifth <b>Amendment's</b> <b>right</b> {{to counsel}} {{attaches}} upon invocation (i.e., when an attorney is requested). The Sixth <b>Amendment's</b> <b>right</b> to counsel attaches when adversarial proceedings begin (i.e., at the arraignment). The presumption in Jackson attempted to analogize the Fifth <b>Amendment's</b> <b>right</b> against self-incrimination through Edwards v. Arizona to the Sixth <b>Amendment's</b> <b>right</b> to counsel, essentially not allowing police interrogation after the right attached. Under Montejo, {{in the case}} where the Defendant has not asserted his Fifth <b>Amendment's</b> <b>right</b> to counsel but rather relies on his Sixth <b>Amendment's</b> <b>right</b> to counsel, police may reinitiate interrogation after his Miranda rights have been read. However, if a Defendant has asserted his Fifth <b>Amendment's</b> <b>right</b> to counsel and adversarial proceedings have begun, police may not reinitiate questioning without counsel present and waiver under Edwards, or unless the Defendant initiates the conversation and police get a waiver.|$|R

5|$|Heffernan brought suit {{alleging that}} his {{demotion}} violated his First <b>Amendment</b> <b>rights.</b> The case took {{a decade to}} reach the Supreme Court.

A later summary judgment in the city's favor was overturned on appeal before being granted again in the third trial.|$|E
40|$|This Article {{analyzes}} {{the future of}} the Sixth <b>Amendment</b> <b>right</b> to counsel following the United States Supreme Court case of Montejo v. Louisiana, 129 S. Ct. 2079 (2009). In Montejo, the Court overturned a long-standing prohibition on the interrogation of a represented defendant without his counsel present. Now, following Montejo, the police may approach a criminal defendant and ask him, outside the presence of his lawyer, to waive his Sixth <b>Amendment</b> <b>right</b> to have counsel present during an interrogation. This significant change in Sixth Amendment law raises many new questions regarding the scope and procedure of a waiver of the Sixth <b>Amendment</b> <b>right</b> to counsel. In addressing these questions, this Article first critiques the Montejo decision for its conflation of the Sixth <b>Amendment</b> <b>right</b> to counsel with the Fifth <b>Amendment</b> <b>right</b> to counsel. This Article posits that the Court wrongly grafted Fifth Amendment notions of voluntariness and coercion onto its Sixth Amendment analysis, thereby ignoring traditional Sixth Amendment concerns, such as fairness in the adversarial process and the provision of counsel as an intermediary between the defendant and the State. This Article then considers several questions that arise in the wake of Montejo, including: whether a formal waiver is still needed to waive the Sixth <b>Amendment</b> <b>right</b> to counsel; if it is, what language constitutes a valid waiver; and what police conduct will invalidate a waiver? In answering each of these questions, this Article discusses the inherent limitations of the Montejo Court’s conclusion that the protections afforded by the Fifth <b>Amendment</b> <b>right</b> to counsel, namely those of Miranda and its progeny, offer sufficient protection of a defendant’s Sixth <b>Amendment</b> <b>right</b> to counsel. Finally, this Article argues that these Fifth Amendment-based protections are, in fact, insufficient, and courts should answer these post-Montejo questions by reaffirming the distinct fundamental principles that underlie the Court’s traditional Sixth <b>Amendment</b> <b>right</b> to counsel jurisprudence...|$|R
50|$|Provisions {{that the}} Supreme Court either {{has refused to}} incorporate, or whose {{possible}} incorporation {{has not yet been}} addressed include the Fifth <b>Amendment</b> <b>right</b> to an indictment by a grand jury, and the Seventh <b>Amendment</b> <b>right</b> to a jury trial in civil lawsuits.|$|R
50|$|Under Montejo v. Louisiana (2009), the Sixth <b>Amendment's</b> <b>right</b> {{to counsel}} {{does not prevent}} police from {{initiation}} of interrogation once the right attaches. This {{is in contrast to}} the Fifth <b>Amendment</b> <b>right</b> to counsel, where the police custodial interrogation is not permitted as per Edwards.|$|R
5|$|Heffernan v. City of Paterson, 578 U.S. ___ (2016), was a United States Supreme Court case in 2016 {{concerning}} the First <b>Amendment</b> <b>rights</b> of public employees. By a 6–2 margin, the Court {{held that a}} public employee's constitutional rights might be violated when an employer, believing that the employee was engaging in what would be protected speech, disciplines them because of that belief, even if the employee did not exercise such a constitutional right.|$|E
5|$|In a 5-4 decision, the Court {{overturned}} the silver platter doctrine and Elkins' conviction. Associate Justice Potter Stewart wrote the majority opinion, while Associate Justices Felix Frankfurter and John M. Harlan II dissented. By giving {{a rationale for}} a broader interpretation of Fourth <b>Amendment</b> <b>rights,</b> the decision prepared the way for Mapp v. Ohio (1961), which applied the exclusionary rule to the states.|$|E

The ACLU sought $100,000 (1988, $182,000 in 2008) to compensate Nelson for damage to the painting, and to [...] "punish" [...] the aldermen and police for their actions.|$|R
25|$|As noted, {{information}} obtained {{in violation of}} the defendant's Sixth <b>Amendment</b> <b>right</b> to counsel is subject to suppression unless the government can establish that the defendant waived his right to counsel.

5|$|Portland, Oregon police {{officers}} searched {{the home of}} James Butler Elkins, ostensibly for obscene material, and seized tape recordings that Elkins had made from illegal wiretaps. He was subsequently convicted in federal court of intercepting and divulging telephone communications, but appealed his federal conviction {{on the grounds that}} state police had gathered the evidence against him in violation of his Fourth <b>Amendment</b> <b>rights.</b> His conviction was upheld by the Ninth US Circuit Court of Appeals.|$|E
5|$|Scull appealed his {{conviction}} to the U.S. Supreme Court. In a unanimous ruling in May 1959, {{the high court}} held in Scull v. Virginia ex rel. Comm. on Law Reform and Racial Activities that the conviction violated Scull's 14th <b>Amendment</b> <b>rights</b> to due process because the committee's inquiry was so vague and so confusing that Scull could not tell what he was being asked.|$|E

When {{the school principal}} removed an article concerning divorce and another concerning teen pregnancy, the student journalists sued, claiming that their First <b>Amendment</b> <b>rights</b> had been violated. A lower court sided with the school, but its decision was overturned by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, which sided with the students.|$|E

Colorado AIM's leadership has come into conflict with some leaders in the Denver Italian American community, the main supporters of the parade.

On 14 March 2007, Rockstar's parent company Take-Two Interactive filed a lawsuit against Thompson in an attempt to preemptively restrict him from his attempts to declare Rockstar's games as a nuisance. Games declared to be a nuisance are effectively banned for sale, which Take-Two believed would be a violation of First <b>Amendment</b> <b>rights.</b> Thompson responded by filing a countersuit, accusing Take-Two of violating federal RICO statues, committing perjury, obstruction of justice, and conspiring against him with third parties to deprive him of his civil rights.|$|E
5|$|In Herring v. United States, , Ginsburg dissented to the Court's {{decision}} not to suppress evidence due to a police officer's failure to update a computer system. In contrast to Justice Roberts' emphasis on suppression {{as a means to}} deter police misconduct, Ginsburg took a more robust view on the use of suppression as a remedy for a violation of a defendant's Fourth <b>Amendment</b> <b>rights.</b> Ginsburg viewed suppression as a way to prevent the government from profiting from mistakes, and therefore as a remedy to preserve judicial integrity and respect civil rights. She also rejected Roberts' assertion that suppression would not deter mistakes, contending making police pay a high price for mistakes would encourage them to take greater care.|$|E

5|$|In the 1950s, the Civil Rights Movement {{increased}} {{pressure on the}} federal government to protect the voting rights of racial minorities. In 1957, Congress passed the first civil rights legislation since Reconstruction: the Civil Rights Act of 1957. This legislation authorized the Attorney General to sue for injunctive relief on behalf of persons whose Fifteenth <b>Amendment</b> <b>rights</b> were deprived, created the Civil Rights Division within the Department of Justice to enforce civil rights through litigation, and created the Commission on Civil Rights to investigate voting rights deprivations. Further protections were enacted in the Civil Rights Act of 1960, which allowed federal courts to appoint referees to conduct voter registration in jurisdictions that engaged in voting discrimination against racial minorities.|$|E

Ferber, , that images of children need not meet legal definitions of obscenity to be prohibited by the government, since the state's interest in protecting children from harm trumped First <b>Amendment</b> <b>rights</b> in this instance.|$|E
