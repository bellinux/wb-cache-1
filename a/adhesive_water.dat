50|$|Raiba {{lived in}} a 100 square feet {{tenement}} with his mother, {{his wife and three}} children. This space served too as the studio. Canvas in those was not easy to come by and was usually imported. During his time in Kashmir stretched cloth on a board served as his canvas. Jute when stretched tight is extremely taught, but the fibres from the strains of jute often shed. Being from a plant that grows in standing water, with humid conditions, the fibre resists decay by humidity and is apt for tropical temperatures. It is readily available and cheap. Using jute for its availability and cost, Raiba soon devised a method of priming the stretched jute, using techniques learnt during his training to be a muralist at school. He would prepare the surface of his jute canvas by creating a white sticky solution of white clay paste, fevicol (gum <b>adhesive),</b> <b>water</b> and ground bricks. The gum adhesive would act as the binder and bring in the colour. The prepared canvas had a taught smooth surface that was dull white in colour. The process is time consuming as the jute strings absorb the solution easily but the pores between them take time to fill. It takes 15 layers of application before the stretched jute {{can be used as a}} canvas. Raiba, is distinct in his use of jute, he changes the surface of the material to resemble a canvas and does not use it in its natural form. While painting there is a deep absorption of the paint into the surface, leaving a rough texture on the surface, altering the shades of the paint. Even after years of having been painted these canvases do not develop cracks or have any fungal damage in comparison to the common canvas. The placement of subjects within his paintings borrow from the murals, narrating multiple stories, histories through intricate images that often go unnoticed but remain essential.|$|E

For dentin powder {{exposed to the}} adhesives under clinical application conditions, gelatin zymography revealed the release of MMP- 2 (not of MMP- 9) by the etch & rinse adhesive, while no release of enzymes could be detected for the mild self-etch adhesive, most likely because of its limited dentin demineralization effect.

40|$|Abstract—We have {{demonstrated}} the fluidic self-assembly of micromachined silicon parts onto silicon and quartz substrates in a preconfigured pattern with submicrometer positioning precision. Self-assembly is accomplished using photolithographically defined part and substrate binding sites that are complementary shapes of hydrophobic self-assembled monolayers. The patterned substrate is passed through a film of hydrophobic <b>adhesive</b> on <b>water,</b> causing the <b>adhesive</b> to selectively coat the binding sites. Next, the microscopic parts, fabricated from silicon-on-insulator wafers and {{ranging in size from}} 150 150 15 m 3 to 400 400 50 m 3, are directed toward the substrate surface under water using a pipette. Once the hydrophobic pattern on a part comes into contact with an adhesive-coated substrate binding site, shape matching occurs spontaneously due to interfacial free energy minimization. In water, capillary forces of the adhesive hold the parts in place with an alignment precision of less than 0. 2 m. Permanent bonding of the parts onto quartz and silicon is accomplished by activating the adhesive with heat or ultraviolet light. The resulting rotational misalignment is within 0. 3. Using square sites, 98 -part arrays have been assembled in less than 1 min with 100 % yield.
