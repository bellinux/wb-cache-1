5|$|After {{being open}} for {{little more than}} a year, the school failed in February 1737, gaining Johnson a {{reputation}} as a failed schoolmaster. He slowly <b>abandoned</b> <b>his</b> desire to teach to focus more on writing his first major work, the historical tragedy Irene. The play did not earn him the money he had hoped for, though, until Garrick produced it in 1749.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1282, Ladislaus laid siege to Borostyánkő (now Bernstein im Burgenland in Austria), {{which was}} held by the Kőszegis. The Kőszegis resisted, forcing the king to lift the siege in early 1283. Ladislaus even {{reconciled}} with Ivan Kőszegi and appointed him palatine before 6 July. Ladislaus <b>abandoned</b> <b>his</b> wife, Isabella, and settled among the Cumans {{by the end of}} the year.|$|E

5|$|Chotiner {{was born}} in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; his father moved the family to California and then <b>abandoned</b> <b>his</b> wife and children. Murray Chotiner {{attended}} UCLA, and graduated from the Southwestern School of Law. He practiced law in Los Angeles, and branched out into public relations. Involving himself in Republican politics, he played {{an active part in}} several political campaigns and made an unsuccessful run for the California State Assembly in 1938.|$|E
5|$|Chotiner {{was born}} on October 4, 1909, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the son of Albert Hyman Chotiner and Sarah Chotiner.

Albert Chotiner, a cigar maker by trade, managed a chain of movie theaters in California, and soon <b>abandoned</b> <b>his</b> wife and children.|$|E
5|$|The {{attempted}} expedition had {{a significant}} consequence. Wassmuss left Constantinople to organise the tribes in south Persia to act against British interests. While evading British capture in Persia, Wassmuss inadvertently <b>abandoned</b> <b>his</b> codebook. Its recovery by Britain allowed the Allies to decipher German communications, including the Zimmermann Telegram in 1917. Niedermayer led the group following Wassmuss's departure.|$|E

5|$|A Venetian fleet forced Vatatzes' {{naval forces}} to withdraw, {{but after the}} Venetians {{departed}} for home the Greeks and Bulgarians besieged Constantinople again in November 1235. John sent letters to European monarchs and the pope, pleading for assistance. Since {{the survival of the}} Latin Empire was in jeopardy, Pope Gregory urged the crusaders to defend Constantinople instead of the Holy Land. A combined naval force from Venice, Genoa, Pisa and Geoffrey II of Achaea broke through the blockade. Asen soon <b>abandoned</b> <b>his</b> alliance with Vatatzes, who was forced to lift the siege in 1236.|$|E
5|$|After de l'Orme died in 1570, Catherine <b>abandoned</b> <b>his</b> {{design for}} a {{freestanding}} house with courtyards. To his unfinished wing she added a pavilion that extended the building towards the river. This was built in a less experimental style by Jean Bullant. Bullant attached columns to his pavilion, as advocated in his 1564 book on the classical orders, to mark proportion. Some commentators have interpreted his different approach as a criticism of de l'Orme's departures from the style of Roman monuments.|$|E
5|$|After the Mongol withdrawal, Béla IV <b>abandoned</b> <b>his</b> {{policy of}} {{recovering}} former crown lands. Instead, he granted large estates to his supporters, and {{urged them to}} construct stone-and-mortar castles. He initiated {{a new wave of}} colonization that resulted in the arrival of a number of Germans, Moravians, Poles, and Romanians. The king re-invited the Cumans and settled them in the plains along the Danube and the Tisza. A group of Alans, the ancestors of the Jassic people, seems to have settled in the kingdom around the same time.|$|E

5|$|After {{wintering}} in Weymouth, Gorges <b>abandoned</b> <b>his</b> new {{colony in}} the spring of 1624 due to financial difficulties. Most of his settlers returned to England, but some remained in as colonists in Weymouth, Plymouth, or Virginia. The remaining Weymouth settlers were supported by Plymouth until they were made part of the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1630. Massachusetts Bay Governor John Winthrop visited the settlement in 1632. In time, the location of the original settlement was lost to history and development. The location of the original fort was not rediscovered until 1891.|$|E
5|$|Alfred rescued about 100 men; Rattler, about 40; and Culloden, 127, {{including}} Captain Renaudin, who <b>abandoned</b> <b>his</b> {{ship and}} left {{in the very first}} British boat. He was taken to Culloden and served a meal in the officers' mess; as he dined with his son and other French and British officers, a commotion was heard; racing to the gallery of Culloden, the party witnessed Vengeur sink with the remaining wounded aboard. Figures of the casualties on Vengeur are not precisely known, but amount to approximately 250 killed during the battle, 106 drowned in the sinking, and 367 rescued by the British.|$|E
5|$|Antigonus, who {{had brought}} with him a large force of 20,000 {{infantry}} and 1,300 cavalry, was marching through Euboea towards the Peloponnese. The hostile Aetolian League occupying parts of Thessaly had threatened to oppose him if he went further south than Thermopylae, despite their neutrality {{at that point in}} the war. Aratus met Antigonus at Pagae, where he was pressured by Antigonus into giving Megara to Boeotia. When Cleomenes heard of the Macedonian advance through Euboea, he <b>abandoned</b> <b>his</b> siege of Sicyon and constructed a trench and palisade running from Acrocorinth to the Isthmus. He chose this location to avoid facing the Macedonian phalanx head-on.|$|E

5|$|At {{the cost}} of many casualties, the Third Fort's {{defenders}} delayed the advance of the Germans, but were forced to evacuate and retreat later the same day. The next day the Fourth Fort was abandoned and the Fifth Fort was conquered soon afterwards. In a chain reaction, the other forts began capitulating. Commander Grigoriev <b>abandoned</b> <b>his</b> post and escaped to Žiežmariai. When the Germans crossed the Nemunas river they captured the Sixth and Seventh Forts. The remaining two forts were captured soon afterwards. After eleven days of fighting, the fortress had been taken.|$|E
5|$|Both of Cimabue's {{surviving}} crucifixes {{were commissioned}} by the Franciscan order. Founded by Saint Francis of Assisi, their reformist, religious and social views {{had a profound effect}} on the visual arts in the century after his death. The son of a wealthy cloth merchant, Francis <b>abandoned</b> <b>his</b> inheritance to take up preaching in his mid-twenties. He venerated poverty and developed a deep appreciation for the beauty of nature. Byzantine depictions tended to show Christ as invincible, even in death. Imagery based on Franciscan ideals in the thirteenth century generally reinforce his veneration of simplicity and naturalism, infusing the paintings with the new values of humanism.|$|E
5|$|By 926 Sihtric {{had evidently}} {{acknowledged}} Æthelstan as over-king, adopting Christianity and marrying a sister of Æthelstan at Tamworth. Within {{the year he}} may have <b>abandoned</b> <b>his</b> new faith and repudiated his wife, but before Æthelstan and he could fight, Sihtric died suddenly in 927. His kinsman, perhaps brother, Gofraid, who had remained as his deputy in Dublin, came from Ireland to take power in York, but failed. Æthelstan moved quickly, seizing much of Northumbria. In less than a decade, {{the kingdom of the}} English had become by far the greatest power in Britain and Ireland, perhaps stretching as far north as the Firth of Forth.|$|E
