5|$|In the infancy of the hacker {{subculture}} and {{the computer}} underground, criminal convictions were rare because there was an informal code of ethics {{that was followed by}} white hat hackers. Proponents of hacking claim to be motivated by artistic and political ends, but are often unconcerned <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of criminal means to achieve them. White hat hackers break past computer security for non-malicious reasons and do no damage, akin to breaking into a house and looking around. They enjoy learning and working with computer systems, and by this experience gain a deeper understanding of electronic security. As the computer industry matured, individuals with malicious intentions (black hats) would emerge to exploit computer systems for their own personal profit.|$|E

5|$|James Fleming {{has written}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of the postmodern {{tradition}} in 1602, {{and how this}} is employed; {{as a means to}} respond to the post-9/11 world in which the comic was written; and to propose a new model of postmodernism better suited to the post-9/11 world. On the one hand, 1602 is clearly postmodern, depending as it does on the mixing of tropes of both Elizabethan fiction and contemporary comics. But Fleming focuses particularly on Gaiman's use of The Watcher as a witness that provides an epistemological grounding to the text - a grounding that, citing Brian McHale, Fleming argues is absent in traditional postmodern writing.|$|E
5|$|Rotblat {{continued}} to have strong reservations <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of science to develop such a devastating weapon. In 1985 he related that at a private dinner at the Chadwicks' house at Los Alamos in March 1944, he was shocked to hear {{the director of the}} Manhattan Project, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., say words to the effect that the real purpose in making the bomb was to subdue the Soviets. Historians, notably Barton Bernstein, have cast doubt on this story.|$|E
5|$|Screenwriter Andrew Davies {{said he was}} {{attracted}} to the story because it featured a girl transitioning into womanhood and it included his interests in Victorian erotica; he compared it to Pride and Prejudice—for which he wrote the BBC screenplay—"with dirty bits". Both Waters and Davies were concerned <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of dildos in scenes with Diana, but the BBC allowed it. When news releases told of the BBC featuring swearing and sex toys, the Daily Mail reported that viewers began to protest. BBC representatives downplayed the gratuitousness of the story, comparing it to Moll Flanders.|$|E

Their free speech arguments raised important constitutional issues: they asserted that their political advocacy was protected by the First Amendment, because the CPUSA did not advocate imminent violence, but instead merely promoted revolution as an abstract concept.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} running jokes {{throughout}} the series. Established in Goldfinger is Q's continuing disgust at how his equipment is often lost, {{damaged or destroyed}} by Bond during missions. Another is how easily distracted Bond is in the lab ("Now pay attention") as Q rattles off details <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of the equipment which Bond needs to commit to memory. Another part of the customary byplay between Q and Bond is Bond's amused reaction to the latest devices and the Quartermaster's indignant response ("I never joke about my work"). There are also sight gags showing prototype equipment. In the field, however, Bond always remembers the details and takes {{full advantage of the}} tools supplied.|$|E

5|$|Graham {{subsequently}} held {{a series}} of regimental and staff appointments, serving in a number of infantry and armoured units. Volunteering for overseas service, he transferred to the Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF) on 26 July 1941. He was subsequently posted to the 2/11th Armoured Car Regiment as the adjutant, followed by attendance at the Staff School. Promoted to captain in September 1942, Graham briefly served on the headquarters of the 1st Armoured Division before being attached to the British Army. Serving with the British 7th Armoured Division, he saw action with them in the North Africa and Italy 1943–44. Coming ashore {{on the first day of}} the Allied landing at Salerno, he was wounded but remained on duty. During this period he gained valuable operational experience in armoured warfare; while his service in North Africa may also have shaped his thinking <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of tactical minefields which had been used extensively during the mobile infantry and armoured battles of 1941–42.|$|E
5|$|Starting in the mid-1940s, Carson {{had become}} {{concerned}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of synthetic pesticides, {{many of which}} had been developed through the military funding of science since World War II. It was the US federal government's 1957 gypsy moth eradication program, however, that prompted Carson to devote her research, and her next book, to pesticides and environmental poisons. The gypsy moth program involved aerial spraying of DDT and other pesticides (mixed with fuel oil), including the spraying of private land. Landowners on Long Island filed a suit to have the spraying stopped, and many in affected regions followed the case closely. Though the suit was lost, the Supreme Court granted petitioners the right to gain injunctions against potential environmental damage in the future; this laid the basis for later successful environmental actions.|$|E
5|$|The first {{strand of}} the novel follows Hollis Henry, {{a former member of}} the early 1990s cult band The Curfew and a {{freelance}} journalist. She is hired by advertising mogul Hubertus Bigend to write a story for his nascent magazine Node (described as a European Wired) <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of locative technology in the art world. Helped by curator Odile Richard she investigates Los Angeles artist Alberto Corrales, who recreates virtually the deaths of celebrities such as River Phoenix. Corrales leads her to Bobby Chombo, an expert in geospatial technologies who handles Corrales' technical requirements. Chombo's background is troubleshooting navigation systems for the United States military. He is reclusive and paranoid, refusing to sleep in the same GPS grid square on consecutive nights, and only consents to talk to Hollis due to his admiration for The Curfew.|$|E

5|$|This series {{proved to}} be highly controversial, with many people {{complaining}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of pitch correction software on the broadcast of contestants' auditions, the decision to form two groups out of rejected soloists, the rejection of popular contestant Gamu Nhengu at judges' houses and Cole's failure to vote to eliminate an act in week 5 of the live shows. Controversy also surrounded contestants Shirlena Johnson, who was axed over fears for her mental health, and Treyc Cohen, who was reported to already have a record deal when the live shows started. There were also accusations of fixing, which were denied by the show's producers. It was the most watched series to date, {{with an average of}} 14.13million viewers per episode. The final was watched by 17.71million people, making it the highest rated television episode of 2010 in the UK.|$|E
5|$|In April 1995, the State Duma {{considered}} {{the first draft}} of a law that would have established a State Medical Commission with a psychiatrist to certify the competence of the President, the Prime Minister, and high federal political officials to fulfill the responsibilities of their positions. In 2002, Ukrainian psychiatrist Ada Korotenko stated that today the question was raised <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of psychiatry to settle political accounts and establish psychiatric control over people competing for power in the country. Obviously, one will find supporters of the feasibility of such a filter, she said, though is it worthwhile to substitute experts' medical reports for elections? In 2003, the suggestion of using psychiatry to prevent and dismiss officials from their positions was supported by Alexander Podrabinek, author of the book Punitive Medicine, a 265-page monograph covering political abuses of psychiatry in the Soviet Union. He suggested that people who seek high positions or run for the legislature should bring from the psychiatric dispensary a reference that they are not on the psychiatric registry and should be subjected to psychiatric examination in the event of inappropriate behavior. Concerned about the problem, authorities ruled that the Russian Mental Health Law should not be applied to senior officials and the judiciary on the ground that they are vested with parliamentary or judicial immunity. A psychiatrist who violates this rule can be deprived of his diploma and sentenced to imprisonment. In 2011, Russian psychiatrists again tried to promote the idea that one's marked aspiration in itself for power can be referred to psychopathic symptoms and that there are statistics about 60 percent of current leaders of states suffering from various forms of mental abnormalities.|$|E
