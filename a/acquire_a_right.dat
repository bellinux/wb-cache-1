50|$|An {{alternative}} argument {{raised for}} the respondent Jones was that section 41 was only ever {{intended to be}} a transitional provision, to have effect only until the Parliament of Australia made laws about who could vote in federal elections. On this view, the section could be read as referring only to adult persons who were alive when the Constitution came into effect, or referring only to state laws in force when the Constitution came into effect, under which people might <b>acquire</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to vote. This argument was first raised by John Quick and Robert Garran in their 1901 book, The Annotated Constitution of the Australian Commonwealth.|$|E

5000|$|The next {{problem of}} {{allegiance}} is who {{exactly is the}} rightful ruler? And according to Hume, such questions are often irresolvable by reason, {{and it can be}} wise to simply go with the flow in the [...] "interests of peace and liberty". Again, Hume agrees that political society begins with a social agreement promising allegiance to certain people. But once a government acquires its own authority by serving the public interest, it is (paradoxically) in our interest to renounce our interest and simply abide the powers that be, lest we fall into divisive controversies over the best possible ruler. Questions of succession are then answered with five somewhat arbitrary principles: (1) long possession: the influence of custom favors long-established forms of governments, though it takes longer to <b>acquire</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to large nations; (2) present possession: few governments have any better claim to authority than successfully holding onto power; (3) conquest: we favor glorious conquerors over detestable usurpers; (4) succession: along with the clear advantages of hereditary government, Hume emphasizes our imaginative tendency to associate parents with children and pass belongings from one to the other; (5) positive laws: lawmakers may change the form of government, though any drastic departures from tradition are apt to diminish popular allegiance. And with so many distinct principles, the choice of ruler is sometimes wonderfully clear, and sometimes hopelessly unclear. In a closing discussion of the Glorious Revolution, Hume defends keeping the right of resistance unformulated and out of the legal code, and extending this right from cases of direct oppression to cases of interbranch constitutional encroachment in [...] "mix'd governments", adding two [...] "philosophical reflections": first, Parliament's authority to exclude the heirs of rulers they have deposed, but not the heirs of rulers who simply died, derives from mere imaginative inertia; second, a contested change in authority may acquire legitimacy retroactively from a stable line of successors.|$|E
40|$|Is it {{possible}} in Hong Kong to <b>acquire</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> of way by long, open and uninterrupted usage? One {{might have expected}} this question, fundamental and of practical importance, to have been settled authoritatively. The answer has instead divided Hong Kong's judges. Although the weight of recent opinion {{seems to be in}} favour of allowing such a right, the basis of doing so is not at all clear. It will be the gravamen of this article that the courts should no longer entertain any doubts upon the matter. Acquisition of such rights by usage is possible. The basis for recognition of such rights will be suggested and is, perhaps surprisingly, straightforward, {{but it is not the}} basis that has sometimes been suggested. published_or_final_versio...|$|E

[...] Studies of higher education first began to recognize students as stakeholders in 1975. External stakeholders may include employers. In Europe, the rise of stakeholder regimes has arisen from the shift of higher education from a government-run bureaucracy to modern system in which the government's role involves more monitoring than direct control.|$|R

50|$|A {{third-party}} beneficiary only <b>acquires</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> {{of action}} to enforce his benefit once he has accepted the benefit provided for in the contract.

Acceptance may also be a suspensive condition in certain contracts. Under Scots law, acceptance is not necessary to be vested in <b>a</b> <b>right</b> of action, but is necessary to be liable. Before acceptance, however, the ius quaesitum tertio is tenuous so that acceptance of a benefit does not create <b>a</b> <b>right,</b> but rather entrenches that right.
