2500|$|The [...] is an {{idealization}} of {{continuum mechanics}} under which fluids {{can be treated}} as continuous, even though, on a microscopic scale, they are composed of molecules. Under the continuum assumption, macroscopic (observed/measurable) properties such as density, pressure, temperature, and bulk velocity are taken to be well-defined at [...] "infinitesimal" [...] volume elements -- small {{in comparison to the}} characteristic length scale of the system, but large in comparison to molecular length scale. Fluid properties can vary continuously from one volume element to another and are average values of the molecular properties. The continuum hypothesis can lead to inaccurate results in applications like supersonic speed flows, or molecular flows on nano scale. Those problems for which the continuum hypothesis fails, can be solved using statistical mechanics. [...] To determine whether or not the continuum hypothesis applies, the Knudsen number, defined as the ratio of the molecular mean free path to the characteristic length scale, is evaluated. Problems with Knudsen numbers below 0.1 can be evaluated using the continuum hypothesis, but molecular approach (statistical mechanics) can be applied for <b>all</b> <b>ranges</b> of Knudsen numbers.|$|E
2500|$|The M1895 was {{equipped}} with a ladder-type rear sight adjustable {{to a maximum of}} 2,000 yards, determined by actual firing at Winchester in March 1896. [...] Because of the relatively high velocity and flat trajectory of the 6mm Lee cartridge, authorities calibrated the sights at their lowest setting with a point-blank or dead aim range of 725 yards (663 m). [...] The latter was intended for use on targets at <b>all</b> <b>ranges</b> from point-blank to 700 yards. [...] The single battle setting was intended to discourage individual soldiers or marines from adjusting their sight elevation unless firing at mass targets at extreme ranges, in which case officers would give commands for ranges to be set in such situations. [...] Owing to the necessity of supplying the Navy with rifles as soon as practicable, no provision for drift (windage) was included in the rear sight. [...] The prominence of the front sight and its exposure to damage led to the adoption of a sheet metal front sight cover for the 10,000 rifles in the original order. [...] The front sight cover was browned (blued) to reduce glare. [...] Each rifle was tested at Winchester for accuracy by firing a group of three shots at 50 yards, any rifle not showing the desired accuracy was returned to the line for adjustment, which sometimes involved restocking the entire rifle.|$|E
2500|$|As the Chief of the Bureau of Naval Ordnance {{stated in}} his 1897 Small Arms {{report to the}} Secretary of the Navy, [...] "In making what may appear a radical {{departure}} in its selection of a caliber smaller than as yet adopted elsewhere...the Bureau is convinced it is {{looking to the future}} … it is surely wise to attempt to advance with one stride as far as existing conditions allow toward the goal to which the world is moving with slow steps." [...] The report went on to list the advantages of the smaller 6mm caliber: greatly increased velocity, flatness of bullet trajectory, reduced recoil, a 100% increase in penetration compared to the former [...]45-70 Government cartridge, and the ability to carry twice the number of cartridges per individual sailor or marine. The report acknowledged, however, that the 6mm round had two principal disadvantages: first, as a small-caliber round, the 6mm bullet would not sufficiently wound an enemy to put him out of action, and second, the [...] "shock" [...] or stopping power of the smaller bullet would not [...] "stop the onset of excited men at short range." [...] In answer to these objections, the report gave three responses: first, [...] "the battle of the future will be fought at long range, and men will not live to come to close quarters with an enemy who stands his ground"; second, [...] "99 percent of wounded enemy soldiers were unlikely to investigate the severity of their wound, but simply retire to the rear", and last, [...] "the explosive effect of a small-caliber, high-velocity bullet against the human body—the bullet tumbles or fragments to produce devastating wounds against bone or fluid-filled organs—would be more incapacitating at <b>all</b> <b>ranges</b> than wounds made by a slow-moving bullet of large caliber.|$|E

2500|$|Firing a [...] bullet at [...] from a [...] barrel, the 6mm U.S.N. was the highest-velocity {{cartridge}} used by {{any military}} {{force at the}} time of its adoption. [...] Designed to achieve better penetration than the Army's [...]30 Army cartridge used in the Model 1892/98 (Krag) rifle, the round was intended to perforate the hulls of small enemy craft such as patrol and torpedo boats, and could penetrate [...] of soft wood at , [...] of low-carbon steel at 10 feet (3m); 0.375-inch (9.5mm) of ordinary boiler plate at , or a -thick suspended chrome steel alloy boiler plate at [...] The [...] roundnosed bullet had a flatter trajectory than its [...] predecessor at <b>all</b> <b>ranges</b> up to 500 yards; above this distance, the heavier bullet began to show an advantage. [...] The new loading had an effective range (individual rifle fire) of around 600-700 yards, at which point the blunt-tip bullet rapidly lost velocity and energy. [...] The [...] bullet, like its predecessor, demonstrated an inclination to instability unless rapidly rotated. The M1895 Lee rifle therefore received a rapid barrel rifling twist of one turn in 7.5 inches (19cm) (with right-hand twist) to keep the bullet from wobbling or tumbling at extended ranges. At some point, this rifling was changed in later production rifles to one turn in 10 inches RH (25cm). [...] Contemporary medical reports of the day noted the [...] bullet produced noticeably greater damage to tissue and bone than other military cartridges of the day when fired at full velocity (2,560 fps), and the bullet's copper jacket frequently fragmented or detached entirely from its lead core after penetrating a hard substance such as bone or metal. On the other hand, when the 6mm bullet struck muscle or air-filled cavities such as the lungs, the bullet tended to make a perforating wound of small diameter that caused little damage.|$|E

60|$|For, in {{whatever}} direction {{the building is}} contracted, in that direction the eye will be drawn to its terminal lines; {{and the sense of}} surface will only be at its fullest when those lines are removed, in every direction, as far as possible. Thus the square and circle are pre-eminently the areas of power among those bounded by purely straight or curved lines; and these, with their relative solids, the cube and sphere, and relative solids of progression (as in the investigation of the laws of proportion I shall call those masses which are generated by the progression of an area of given form along a line in a given direction), the square and cylindrical column, are the elements of utmost power in all architectural arrangements. On the other hand, grace and perfect proportion require an elongation in some one direction: and a sense of power may be communicated to this form of magnitude by a continuous series of any marked features, such as the eye may be unable to number; while yet we feel, from their boldness, decision, and simplicity, that it is indeed their multitude which has embarrassed us, not any confusion or indistinctness of form. This expedient of continued series forms the sublimity of arcades and aisles, of <b>all</b> <b>ranges</b> of columns, and, on a smaller scale, of those Greek mouldings, of which, repeated as they now are in all the meanest and most familiar forms of our furniture, it is impossible altogether to weary. Now, it is evident that the architect has choice of two types of form, each properly associated with its own kind of interest or decoration: the square, or greatest area, to be chosen especially when the surface is to be the subject of thought; and the elongated area, when the divisions of the surface are to be the subjects of thought. Both these orders of form, as I think nearly every other source of power and beauty, are marvellously united in that building which I fear to weary the reader by bringing forward too frequently, as a model of all perfection--the Doge's palace at Venice: its general arrangement, a hollow square; its principal façade, an oblong, elongated to the eye by a range of thirty-four small arches, and thirty-five columns, while it is separated by a richly-canopied window in the centre, into two massive divisions, whose height and length are nearly as four to five; the arcades which give it length being confined to the lower stories, and the upper, between its broad windows, left a mighty surface of smooth marble, chequered with blocks of alternate rose-color and white. It would be impossible, I believe, to invent a more magnificent arrangement of all that is in building most dignified and most fair.|$|E
