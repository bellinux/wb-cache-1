50|$|The uniflow type {{of steam}} engine uses steam that flows in one {{direction}} only in each half of the cylinder.

50|$|In practice, the uniflow engine has {{a number}} of {{operational}} shortcomings. The large expansion ratio requires a large cylinder volume. To gain the maximum potential work from the engine a high reciprocation rate is required, typically 80% faster than a double-acting counterflow type engine. This causes the opening times of the inlet valves to be very short, putting great strain on a delicate mechanical part. In order to withstand the huge mechanical forces encountered, engines have to be heavily built and a large flywheel is required to smooth out the variations in torque as the steam pressure rapidly rises and falls in the cylinder. Because there is a thermal gradient across the cylinder, the metal of the wall expands to different extents. This requires the cylinder bore to be machined wider in the cool center than <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> <b>ends.</b> If <b>the</b> cylinder is not heated correctly, or if water enters, the delicate balance can be upset causing seizure mid-stroke or, potentially, destruction.|$|R

30|$|A two-zone {{tube furnace}} {{connected}} to an inert gas supply and {{small amount of}} SiO granulate are the basic ingredients for the synthesis of silicon nanowires. Crucial for growth is a temperature gradient from about 1350 to 900 Â°C along the tube of the furnace. SiO is evaporated <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>hotter</b> <b>end</b> of <b>the</b> tube, flows with the gas stream to the cooler part, where it undergoes a disproportionation reaction into Si and SiO 2, thereby forming the nanowires (Pan et al. 2001). In principle, two different growth methods are possible: growth with and without metal catalyst. Growth assisted {{by the presence of}} a metal catalyst is relatively rapid (Gu et al. 2000). Consistent with the concept of VLS growth, the diameters are determined {{by the size of the}} catalyst particle, although the interplay between the nanowire and the catalyst droplet seems to be more complex compared to normal CVD growth. As a consequence of the disproportionation reaction, the diameter ratio between crystalline core and amorphous shell remains approximately constant (Kolb et al. 2004). The second growth mode, metal-catalyst-free growth, has been originally proposed for growth via laser ablation (Wang et al. 1998), where it was observed that nanowires can be catalyzed by silicon dioxide (Wang et al. 1999). Remarkable about this oxide-assisted growth (OAG) is that SiO 2 -containing targets clearly raise the yield of the final amount of silicon nanowires compared to pure silicon targets or mixed siliconâ€“metal targets (Wang et al. 1998). By carrying out the growth process over several hours, one can obtain millimeter-long crystalline silicon nanowires with varying diameters from about 5 nm to 100 nm, covered by an amorphous shell of up to several 10 nm (Shi et al. 2000; Zhang et al. 2000; Shi et al. 2005).|$|R

The objectives of this paper are to present in-situ respiration data from five remote sites along a climatic gradient in the Kalahari of Botswana and {{to determine the effects of}} temperature, moisture and biological crust cover on soil CO 2 fluxes. Moisture was the primary limiting factor to efflux which increased with amount of simulated rainfall. On dry soils, mean CO 2 efflux was between 1. 5 and 5. 9 mg C m? 2 h? 1. After 2 mm and 50 mm simulated wetting, mean rates increased to 4. 0 to 21. 8 and 8. 6 to 41. 5 mg C m? 2 h? 1 respectively.

The normal flow is balanced by a flow of the superfluid component from the cold to the hot end. At the end sections a normal to superfluid conversion takes place and vice versa. So heat is transported, not by heat conduction, but by convection. This kind of heat transport is very effective, so the thermal conductivity of He-II is very much better than the best materials.

50|$|The vapour {{pressure}} over the hot liquid working fluid <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> <b>end</b> {{of the pipe}} {{is higher than the}} equilibrium {{vapour pressure}} over the condensing working fluid at the cooler end of the pipe, and this pressure difference drives a rapid mass transfer to the condensing end where the excess vapour condenses, releases its latent heat, and warms the cool end of the pipe. Non-condensing gases (caused by contamination for instance) in the vapour impede the gas flow and reduce the effectiveness of the heat pipe, particularly at low temperatures, where vapour pressures are low. The speed of molecules in a gas is approximately the speed of sound, {{and in the absence of}} noncondensing gases (i.e., if there is only a gas phase present) this is the upper limit to the velocity with which they could travel in the heat pipe. In practice, the speed of the vapour through the heat pipe is limited by the rate of condensation at the cold end and far lower than the molecular speed. Note/explanation: The condensation rate is very close to the sticking coefficient times the molecular speed times the gas density, if the condensing surface is very cold. However, if the surface is close to the temperature of the gas, the evaporation caused by the finite temperature of the surface largely cancels this heat flux. If the temperature difference is more than some tens of degrees, the evaporation from the surface is typically negligible, as can be assessed from the vapour pressure curves. In most cases, with very efficient heat transport through the gas, it is very challenging to maintain such significant temperature differences between the gas and the condensing surface. Moreover, this temperature differences of course corresponds to a large effective thermal resistance by itself. The bottleneck is often less severe at the heat source, as the gas densities are higher there, corresponding to higher maximum heat fluxes.|$|E

Due to numerical difficulties, the models of produced sdBs are generally constructed from more massive stars with non-degenerate cores, leaving several uncertainties on the exact characteristics of sdB stars. Employing MESA, we systematically studied the characteristics of sdBs produced from the common envelope (CE) ejection channel, {{and found that the}} sdB stars produced from the CE ejection channel appear to form two distinct groups on the effective temperature-gravity diagram.

For a given initial stellar mass and a given core mass <b>at</b> <b>the</b> onset of the CE, if the CE ejection stops early, the star has a relatively massive H-rich envelope, resulting in a canonical sdB generally. The fact of only a few short-orbital-period sdB binaries being in the flash-mixing sdB region and the lack of He-rich sdBs in short-orbital-period binaries indicate that the flash mixing is not very often in the products of the CE ejection. A falling back process after the CE ejection, similar to that happened in nova, is an appropriate way of increasing the envelope mass, then prevents the flash mixing.

40|$|The primary {{function}} of a cement clinker cooler must always be the adequate cooling of the clinker product; however {{from the point of}} view of fuel economy, such coolers are also designed to utilise the sensible heat of the clinker to preheat the secondary air necessary for combustion. In modern, large capacity plant, the efficiency of heat recuperation has assumed a growing importance because of two related economic factors. The first is cutting fuel costs via the well understood benefits of heat recuperation; the second factor is the gradual improvement in fuel economy of cement kilns in general. As kilns become more finely tuned, the air required for combustion is reduced in direct proportion to the fuel usage, i. e. less air is available to cool a unit quantity of clinker. Hence, in order to avoid the situation where more air is supplied to the cooler than is required for complete combustion of the fuel, more efficient heat recuperation is needed. The Fuels and Energy Research Group <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Surrey (FERGUS), first became aware of these kiln/cooler problems in the late 1960 's, during the course of their pioneer work on the aerodynamics of rotary cement kilns. Consequently during the last decade, FERGUS has actively investigated the limitations of grate cooler systems, in general. In the initial stages of the research, a perspex water model was constructed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University, based on some of the largest kilns in <b>the</b> world, those <b>at.</b> Northfleet Works of Blue Circle Industries. These coolers were experiencing "air sliding" of the clinker bed, causing red hot clinker to be dumped onto the rubber belt conveyors. Using suitable flow tracing media under controlled, scaled flow conditions, the aerodynamics of the Fuller grate cooler were studied, thus revealing that the air flow balance through <b>the</b> chambers <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>hotter</b> <b>end</b> of <b>the</b> cooler was more significant in its effect on the clinker bed than <b>the</b> balance <b>at</b> <b>the</b> colder end. A solution to this problem could then be achieved by using a three step grate. Water modelling, although giving quick visual solutions to aerodynamics problems, is only qualitative. In order to quantify results, various models of rotary kiln cooler systems have been constructed, in particular a 1 / 24 th scale model of the No. 2 kiln of Rugby Cement's South Ferriby Works. This kiln had for some time suffered from excessive wear rates in the burning zone refractory lining, an expensive problem in terms of down-time and rebricking. Air model pitot static measurements indicated that the air jet (representing the fuel/primary air stream) was exhibiting a peculiar "corkscrewing" effect, which could possibly be the cause of impingement on the refractory lining, leading to premature failure of the refractory coating. Correct kiln firing practice is to promote recirculation of combustion products; these gases, being cooler than the flame, protect the brickwork from overheating. It was already understood that the primary cause of flame impingement was a lack of recirculation due to insufficient burner momentum flux, the solution being a costly change in the firing system. However, the air model results were later verified by full scale plant trials and a solution was proposed to eliminate the "corkscrewing" effect by means of a wedge- shaped bluff body welded along the jet axis. This study has quantified the macro aerodynamic effects of grate cooler systems, through the media of air and water modelling. Considerable information has also been obtained on the dynamic behaviour and heat transfer mechanisms of a particular polysize bed of clinker particles. From this information, putative predictions can be made regarding the general behaviour of clinker in beds. Recommendations have been made for further studies in this area.

40|$|We discuss {{atmosphere}} {{models of}} HD 209458 b {{in light of}} the recent day-side flux measurement of HD 209458 bâ€™s secondary eclipse by Spitzer-MIPS at 24 Âµm. In addition, we present a revised secondary eclipse IRTF upper limit at 2. 2 Âµm which places a stringent constraint on the adjacent H 2 O absorption band depths. These two measurements are complementary because they are both shaped by H 2 O absorption and because the former is on the Wien tail of the planetâ€™s thermal emission spectrum and the latter is near the thermal emission peak. A wide range of models fit the observational data, confirming our basic understanding of hot Jupiter atmospheric physics. Although a range of models are viable, some models <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> and cold <b>end</b> of the plausible temperature range can be ruled out. One class of previously unconsidered hot Jupiter atmospheric models that fit the data are those with C/O ï¿½ 1 (as Jupiter may have), which have a significant paucity of H 2 O compared to solar abundance models with C/O = 0. 5. The models indicate that HD 209458 b is in a situation intermediate between pure in situ reradiation and very efficient redistribution of heat; one which will require a careful treatment of atmospheric circulation. We discuss how future wavelength-dependent and phase-dependent observations will further constrain the atmospheric circulation regime. In the shorter term, additional planned measurement...|$|R
