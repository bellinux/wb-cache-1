50|$|Some solar {{cars have}} complex data {{acquisition}} systems that monitor the whole electrical system, while basic cars show battery voltage and motor current. In order {{to judge the}} range available with varying solar production and motive consumption, an <b>ampere-hour</b> <b>meter</b> multiplies battery current and rate, thus providing the remaining vehicle range at each moment in the given conditions.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{equipment and}} techniques {{used in the}} tritium laboratory at the Australian Atomic Energy Commission Research Establishment for the determination of low level activities of tritium in water samples. Samples are enriched by electrolysis in sixteen glass cells connected in series. An enrichment of about 25 times and an enrichment factor of about 0. 85 are obtained. A calibrated <b>ampere-hour</b> <b>meter</b> in series with a precision shunt measures the weight of water electrolysed and a preset counter is used to shut off the current when 20 g of electrolyte remains in each cell. After distillation the enriched samples are counted in Teflon vials using emulsion liquid scintillation techniques. The accuracy of measurements is discussed and applied to routine measurements. The overall standard deviation for samples having an activity greater than 5 'tritium units' is less than 10 %...|$|E
25|$|Meters which {{measured}} {{the amount of}} charge (coulombs) used, known as <b>ampere-hour</b> <b>meters,</b> {{were used in the}} early days of electrification. These were dependent upon the supply voltage remaining constant for accurate measurement of energy usage, which was not a likely circumstance with most supplies. The most common application was in relation to special-purpose meters to monitor charge / discharge status of large batteries.|$|R
2500|$|In 1894 Oliver Shallenberger of the Westinghouse Electric Corporation {{applied the}} {{induction}} principle previously used [...] only in AC <b>ampere-hour</b> <b>meters</b> {{to produce a}} watt-hour meter of the modern electromechanical form, using an induction disk whose rotational speed was made proportional to the power in the circuit. The Bl√°thy meter was similar to Shallenberger and Thomson meter {{in that they are}} two-phase motor meter. Although the induction meter would only work on alternating current, it eliminated the delicate and troublesome commutator of the Thomson design. Shallenberger fell ill and was unable to refine his initial large and heavy design, although he did also develop a polyphase version.|$|R
40|$|Low-power analog/digital {{electronic}} circuit meters discharge of storage battery in <b>ampere-hours.</b> By <b>metering</b> discharge, one obtains indication {{of state of}} charge of battery and avoids unnecessary recharging, maintaining capacity of battery and prolonging life. Because of its small size and low power consumption, useful in such applications as portable video cameras, communication equipment on boats, portable audio equipment, and portable medical equipment...|$|R
40|$|The {{electronic}} <b>ampere-hour</b> <b>meter</b> {{does not}} require any voltage supply and its operation {{is based on the}} magnetic coupling to electrical conductors feeding consumer's load. A capacitor inside the meter is charged at a rate proportional to the load current of the consumer and the number of discharges of the capacitor which occurs at a predetermined capacitor voltage is registered as the ampere-hour reading. Test results of a prototype meter for resistive, inductive and capacitive loads are compared with those from a conventional kWh meter. Results show that the Ah meter functions with reasonable accuracy and it is shown that it can be modified to work as a two-rate meter to implement a 6 day-night tariff without much increase in cost, with possible application in stand-alone hydro power type schemes. Other advantages of the meter are simple construction, less wear and maintenance and lower cost compared to the conventional kWh meter...|$|E
40|$|Philippines [4] {{as shown}} in figure 4. There were only 9 battery users at that time with only one TV set in the whole island. The number of battery users grew to 20 within four months of the SBCS operation. 2 Figure 4 SBCS in Malalison Island, Antique Two years later, the site was {{inspected}} to repair the faulty <b>ampere-hour</b> <b>meter.</b> Utilization of the station has dropped because two diesel generators are now operating in the island. Of the 110 households, 50 were connected to the genset with a monthly fee of $ 3. 75. There are now 8 TV sets in the community with two video houses. A store runs another generator and operates a refrigerator producing cold water. The improvement of livelihood in this fishing village was mainly due to the increase in their catch {{as a result of a}} successful resource management program. As this was anticipated, people in Malalison chose to use diesel gensets because there are no solar home systems available for them to rent. Fuel is accessible for the genset operator and for fishing boats. The genset operator claims to have a total monthly collection of $ 125. 00 with 50 consumers against an operating and maintenance cost of $ 75. 00. Operation of the genset becomes viable with more than 20 consumers paying $ 3. 75 per month...|$|E
