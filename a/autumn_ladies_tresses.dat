50|$|Tyntesfield (ST505712), {{formerly}} {{the home of}} the Gibbs family, came on to the market in 2002 and was acquired by the National Trust with assistance from the National Heritage Memorial Fund and many local private benefactors. It is surrounded by 200 Ha of gardens, farmland and unspoilt woodland. Much of this still remains to be explored, though it is clear that there is considerable potential for wildlife. The buildings contain several bat roosts and eight species of bat are known to live in this area, notably the Lesser Horseshoe Bats (Rhinolophus hipposideros), which roost in the courtyard. Over 90 individuals of this endangered species have been counted there. Other bat species found include the Greater Horseshoe Bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum), Brown Long-eared Bat (Plecotus auritus), and Serotine Bat (Eptesicus serotinus), Whiskered Bat (Myotis sp), and the two Pipistrelle species, (Pipistrellus pipistrellus and P. pygmaeus). The female Glow Worm (Lampyris noctiluca) may be seen on a warm June night in the area close to the house at Tyntesfield. These beetles are in rapid decline, probably due to the increase in urban lights that may distract the males. Their food is mainly snails and slugs, which are in plentiful supply in this area. The orchid <b>Autumn</b> <b>Ladies</b> <b>Tresses</b> (Spiranthes spiralis) grows in the lawn outside the main house.|$|E

50|$|The {{associated}} {{water treatment}} yards historically have supported a significant flowering area of <b>Autumn</b> <b>Lady's</b> <b>Tresses.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{impressive}} {{abundance of}} orchids includes early purple, fly, bee, fragrant, lesser butterfly, pyramidal and <b>autumn</b> <b>lady’s</b> <b>tresses.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Autumn</b> <b>lady's</b> <b>tresses</b> is a polycarp, perennial, {{herbaceous}} plant that remains underground during its dormancy in summer with tubers. The species has thirty chromosomes (2n=30).|$|R
50|$|The genus Spiranthes {{contains}} about forty species, {{most of which}} are from North America. Some species are found in Central and South America, in temperate and tropical Asia southward to Australia and New Zealand. In Europe, three species occur in the wild. Besides the <b>autumn</b> <b>lady's</b> <b>tresses,</b> these are the summer <b>lady's</b> <b>tresses</b> S. aestivalis, and the Irish <b>lady's</b> <b>tresses</b> S. romanzoffiana, a mainly North American species that also occurs in Ireland and western Scotland. The <b>autumn</b> <b>lady's</b> <b>tresses</b> is easily distinguished because the two other species of previously have inflorescences that occur earlier during the year (May-July) from a living rosette, with lanceolate leaves rising at an angle and having cream-colored instead of greenish or greyish white flowers. The <b>autumn</b> <b>lady's</b> <b>tresses</b> also resembles the evergreen Goodyera repens (creeping lady's-tresses or dwarf rattlesnake plantain), which has a creeping rhizome rather than tubers. The inflorescence emerges from the centre of a rosette of ovate leaves with a pointed tip, and has striking perpendicular connective veins. The flowers are covered in long hairs that are often tipped with tiny droplets.|$|R
50|$|Pollination of <b>autumn</b> <b>lady's</b> <b>tresses</b> {{is little}} observed. In the Netherlands the common carder bee Bombus pascuorum and red-tailed {{bumblebee}} Bombus lapidarius are regular visitors. In southern France (Rhône Department) the honeybee also pollinates. The silver Y Autographa gamma is also seen to visits the flowers, but attached pollinia {{have not been}} observed.|$|R
50|$|<b>Autumn</b> <b>lady's</b> <b>tresses</b> may {{be found}} on quite {{different}} substrates, from weathered chalk and limestone to sand and gravel in dunes and slightly acidic heathlands. Occasionally, {{it has also been}} found on clay on sloping sites. It sometimes occurs in lawns, and was reported from the top of a wall in Sicily. Soils need to be low in nitrogen and phosphorus and neither dry nor wet.|$|R
50|$|The {{site is a}} flat {{bottomed}} valley {{with steep}} sides. The unimproved chalk grassland has several nationally rare plants, including moon carrot, spotted catsear, field fleawort, burnt tip orchid and pasque flower. There are also a variety of wild flowers such as the <b>autumn</b> <b>lady’s</b> <b>tresses,</b> which has been studied on the site for over fifty years. The ancient strip lynchet field system is of archaeological interest.|$|R
50|$|The {{grassland}} {{is dominated}} by grasses such as upright brome, sheep's fescue, {{and there is little}} tor-grass. The latter makes the common different from others in the region. Herbs include rock-rose, common bird's-foot-trefoil, salad burnet and wild thyme. Orchids are in abundance including <b>autumn</b> <b>lady's</b> <b>tresses,</b> green-winged orchid and fragrant orchid, particularly in the quarry areas. There are scrub areas of hawthorn and there some trees such as ash.|$|R
50|$|In 52% of {{the plants}} the flowers are {{arranged}} counterclockwise, in 39% clockwise and in 9% {{of the plants}} the flowers are {{to one side of}} the inflorescence. The pollinators always land at bottom of the inflorescence and visit the flowers ever higher up. Most bumblebees have a strong preference for counterclockwise arrangement, fewer for clockwise. It seems that <b>autumn</b> <b>lady's</b> <b>tresses</b> responds to this preference by offering different inflorescence types and thus increases the chances of fertilization.|$|R
5000|$|Vanda coerulea, {{commonly}} known as blue orchid, blue vanda or <b>autumn</b> <b>ladys</b> <b>tresses,</b> is a species of orchid found in Assam and neighbouring Khasi hills with its range extending to China (southern Yunnan). It is known as Kwaklei in Manipuri and Vandaar in Sanskrit. It has bluish purple flowers (Thelymitra crinita is the only orchid that has true blue flowers) which are very long lasting compared to other orchids. The plant bears up to 20 to 30 spikes ...|$|R
50|$|Around {{the end of}} August a rosette {{of leaves}} appears, which winters and dies back in July at the latest. During the {{following}} weeks, a flower stalk emerges from {{the centre of the}} dead leaf rosette, and during flowering, one or two new rosettes are formed. <b>Autumn</b> <b>lady's</b> <b>tresses</b> blossoms after the summer (August-October). The species is not self-pollinating. The pollination is done by bees and bumblebees. In nature, less than the half of the fruit capsules produce seeds. The very fine seeds are dispersed by the wind in October or November. Nevertheless, most seeds will not disperse more than a few dm from the mother plant since the vast majority of new plants are in close vicinity to an adult plant. <b>Autumn</b> <b>lady's</b> <b>tresses</b> spreads primarily through sexual reproduction. However, the plants to a limited extent also propagate vegetatively by the formation of side buds on the underground stem. The new plant forms its own tuber and leaf rosette, and if the old root dies, the connection between the two daughter plants is broken. The plants therefore often occur in small dense groups. An individual plant does not usually flower every year, apparently because the production of seeds takes a lot of effort. Plants do not necessarily appear above ground each year, so that after an absence mature plants suddenly seem to appear out of nowhere.|$|R
50|$|Like {{most other}} species of orchids, <b>autumn</b> <b>lady's</b> <b>tresses</b> needs a root fungus (or mycorrhiza) for its seed to {{germinate}} under field conditions. The seeds contain no endosperm or other food reserves. After germination, {{the lower part of}} the seedling (or protocorm) is colonized by mycorrhiza. The seedlings parasitize actually on the mycorrhiza, which provides both water, minerals and organic compounds. Since it takes about eight years before the plant produces green parts, this part of the lifecycle of this orchid is very long. Mature plants also contain mycorrhiza most of the year, but the amount of hyphae fluctuates with a maximum during the fall and winter. Most deeply infiltrated hyphae are digested at the beginning of flowering time, though the outer cell layer of the tuber may still contain living hyphae. New tubers are colonized when they have reached their maximum size. Infiltrated cells contain coils of hyphae of Rhizoctonia-type. <b>Autumn</b> <b>lady's</b> <b>tresses</b> can accommodate at least types of fungus in its roots. Some of these mycorrhizal fungi are from genera that also occur in other orchids, such as Ceratobasidium and Rhizoctonia. But there are also fungi present in the tubers that were not known to enter into an endophytic relationship, such as the ascomycete genera Davidiella, Leptosphaeria and Alternaria and the basidiomycete Malassezia. Even fungi that are known to be pathogenic in other plants, such as Fusarium oxysporum and Bionectria ochroleuca can be found in healthy specimens of this orchid, suggesting that it is able to keep such fungi in check.|$|R
50|$|To {{conserve}} S. spiralis {{and improve}} the establishment of new habitats the hydrology must be just right: not too dry nor too moist. Because the species has little competitive strength, the soil must be moderate poor in nutrients and eutrophication, for example from adjacent farmland, should be avoided. <b>Autumn</b> <b>lady's</b> <b>tresses</b> grow best in a soil that is not acid. Therefore, acidification must be halted, on loamy soils for example by raising the ground watertable slightly, or by removing the acid humus layer. On sandy soil, {{it is important to}} retain or restore the small scale relief so that the optimal moisture is present both in dry and in wet years in the field. During flowering should not be mowed or grazed, but mowing and grazing by sheep or cattle outside this period is beneficial to keep the vegetation sufficiently short. Damaging the soil should be avoided. New locations can be created in the vicinity of existing habitats, possibly aided by scattering cuttings from existing locations to encourage establishment.|$|R
50|$|<b>Autumn</b> <b>lady's</b> <b>tresses</b> {{occurs in}} Europe and small {{adjacent}} parts of North Africa and Asia. In the west, it occurs from Ireland to Portugal, {{in the south}} from Spain including the Balearic Islands, the coastal mountains of Algeria, Italy including Sicily, Greece including Crete, the Mediterranean, Aegean and Black Sea Coasts of Turkey and the Caucasus Mountains, North Iran eastwards to the Western Himalayas. To the North its limit is from northern England, the Netherlands, Denmark and the southern Baltic, Poland to western Ukraine. In Switzerland the most recent locations are around Lake Lucerne, the Rhine Valley near Chur, {{in the area of}} Lake Walen and in Ticino. In Italy it is found in the north-east near the sea. In Great Britain and Ireland its northern-most occurrence is on the Isle of Man. It has never been found in Scotland. In Ireland it has a scattered southern distribution north to County Sligo. In Germany, the plant is endangered in Bavaria (Franconian Heights and Franconian Jura) and Hesse, very endangered in Baden-Württemberg (Swabian Jura and foothills of the Alps) and Rhineland-Palatinate, and near extinction in Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and Lower Saxony. In France, it occurs across the country, except for the regions of Champagne-Ardenne and Lorraine, and the departments of Nord, Aisne, Eure, Bas-Rhin, Val d'Oise and Seine-et-Marne. It is relatively common on the coasts of Brittany and the Provence, and in the valley of the Orne.|$|R
