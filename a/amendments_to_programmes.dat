40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesThe South African {{government}} launched two {{public transport}} reform programmes {{in the last}} two decades to address generally declining services as well as specific problems with paratransit, the dominant service provider. One <b>programme</b> aims <b>to</b> incorporate paratransit in new bus-based networks in cities; the other is a national paratransit fleet renewal scheme. Cape Town is arguably most advanced with the former, and the first phase of its bus network is nearing completion. Paratransit operators have shown resistance <b>to</b> both <b>programmes,</b> yet there have been few efforts to gain direct insight into their views on their businesses or their attitudes to reform. It is thus difficult to identify reasons behind their unenthusiastic response, or to understand if revisions <b>to</b> the <b>programmes</b> might cause more operators to opt in. This research employed a case study strategy to investigate paratransit operators' business aspirations and needs in Cape Town, and to identify commonalities between their attitudes and the aims of the reform <b>programmes</b> <b>to</b> inform potential <b>amendments</b> <b>to</b> these <b>programmes.</b> The details of incorporating paratransit operators in the new bus system in Cape Town were not systematically recorded, and it was thus first necessary to trace the engagement process between the municipality and these operators. Information was drawn from a variety of sources over a six-year period. Against this background, semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with 30 operators and eight drivers from different parts of the city to explore their aspirations and views on reform. Access was arranged through trusted intermediaries and the eight associations to which respondents belonged. The research revealed that operators were not necessarily passive players waiting for government-led change: some established large transport enterprises, whereas others built small-scale businesses. Propositions were subsequently drawn, amongst other things, on the prospects of and potential revisions <b>to</b> the reform <b>programmes.</b> The recapitalisation programme has had the broader reach of the two programmes. The national government should consider extending it and reviewing its financial support mechanism to make it more accessible to small operators. Larger businesses might be well positioned for incorporation in bus operating companies, but concerted efforts must be made to build trust with these operators and to familiarise them with the transition process. By documenting operator incorporation in the bus system, and providing first-hand insight into paratransit aspirations and attitudes to reform, the research ultimately contributes a basis from which to understand operators' existing responses to reform and the potential for their greater participation in it...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the effectiveness of a}} mentoring programme supporting the transition of first year psychology students. The programme, in which third year students worked with small groups of first year students within tutorials, was developed to enhance five aspects associated with student success (capability, connectedness, resourcefulness, purpose, and culture), encourage deep and strategic learning approaches, and build psychological literacy. The programme was implemented across {{the first year of the}} undergraduate programme at a metropolitan Australian university, and 241 first year students (166 females and 65 males) provided data for the evaluation study. Significant positive change was noted on three of the five aspects of student success, with an increase in deep and strategic learning approaches and a decrease in surface learning. Significant change was reported for six of the nine psychological literacies. Compared with previous cohorts, grades also showed a shift upwards, with a higher proportion of final grades in the range between 60 % and 80 %. Together, these findings suggest that proactive interventions in the first semester of first year can enhance important aspects of learning and increase success for undergraduate psychology students. Recommendations for <b>amendments</b> <b>to</b> the mentoring <b>programme,</b> particularly surrounding its use with mature age students, are discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{case study}} {{research}} involves a unique cohort of seven third year pre-registration student nurses (PRSNs) {{towards the end}} of their nursing programme with a North West Higher Educational Institution (HEI). The aim of the research was to provide the reader with {{a deeper understanding of the}} experiences, motivation and challenges of the PRSNs when completing the theoretical component of their nursing programme within the current socio-political and professional nurse education reforms. A Case study approach to gather and interpret the PRSNs perceptions of their nursing programme was necessary. Data was collected through use of focus groups, PRSNs Personal reflections and academic grades. Thematic network analysis and descriptive analysis were used to interpret the data followed by Triangulation of the findings. The key findings suggest that a definitive demarcation between the engagement of PRSNs to the theory and practical components of the nursing programme. Other key findings included which impacted on the PRSNs learning and motivation were, the actions of others, the increase in academic level and the use of formative assessment. The main external challenge to be recognised was the need for some of the PRSNs to undertake additional paid work distracting them from their studies. The nursing programme is currently ‘fit for prurpose’ with PRSNs meeting all the necessary requirements to apply for registration status. However, <b>amendments</b> <b>to</b> the <b>programme</b> would improve the PRSNs expereince. Therefore the recommendations would be as follows, to increase student engagement and maintain flexibility within programme development, change the delivery model, amalgamate academic and professional regulations and change the current grading system. It should be recognised that pre -registration programmes throughout the country incorporate similar standards and therefore generality of the study can be applied. Future research to enhance student re-motivation, to decrease the theory practice gap, change assessment marking practices and raise public awareness of degree awards for nurses will prove beneficial...|$|R
40|$|This study explores Australian {{small-scale}} rural lifestyle landowners’ {{perceptions of}} and experiences with natural resource management (NRM) extension and incentive programmes and discusses means <b>to</b> better-match such <b>programmes</b> <b>to</b> these landowners’ NRM interests, assistance needs and delivery preferences. Data was collected from seventeen in-depth qualitative case-studies of small-acreage landholders {{located in the}} Noosa hinterland in south-east Queensland. These landholders indicated a high need for expert advice, labour and other resource assistance to achieve their property management objectives. They had, however, a low-level of awareness and understanding of available programmes (particularly incentive schemes) that could provide some of their needed support. Other key barriers to the landholders’ participation in these <b>programmes</b> were aversions <b>to</b> support providers, a perceived unsuitability of properties or irrelevance of particular incentive programmes, and concerns about programme application procedures or property-rights and value-related implications of engagement. Increased NRM engagement among small-scale lifestyle landowners may be achievable through <b>amendments</b> <b>to</b> existing support <b>programmes</b> and better communication of these programmes. The design and delivery of appropriate measures and messages may require collaborative partnerships, with knowledgeable and influential ‘go-to’ landowners and peer-mentoring networks playing a critical role. In many cases, conservation-focused incentive <b>programmes</b> may need <b>to</b> facilitate cooperative NRM among groups of adjoining micro-scale lifestyle landowners and allow greater flexibility in the length and allowable land and forest management practices of contractual agreements. Moreover, small-scale lifestyle landowners have much interest in and need for support to integrate multi-purpose agroforestry systems with other environmental and aesthetic property management goals. Workshops, follow-up field-days on participating properties, free one-on-one on-property advice, and NRM guides that include detailed case-study accounts of landowner experiences are important means of communicating the availability, administrative requirements and benefits of support <b>programmes</b> <b>to</b> small-scale lifestyle landowners. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
