5|$|The skull looks delicate. The interorbital region (between the eyes) is {{narrow and}} hourglass-shaped, and the braincase is smooth; both lack conspicuously {{developed}} ridges <b>and</b> <b>shelves.</b> The zygomatic arches (cheekbones) are poorly developed. The incisive foramina (openings {{in the front}} part of the palate) are short and narrow. The bony palate ends {{at the level of}} the back of the third upper molars. The alisphenoid strut (a piece of bone at the back of the skull separating two foramina, or openings) is absent. The strut is present in most Eliurus, but absent in some specimens of E.grandidieri. The subsquamosal fenestrae (openings in the squamosal bone) are fairly large. The auditory bullae are small. The incisors are weak and the enamel on the upper incisors is yellow to light orange. The root of the lower incisor does not project into a distinct capsular process at the back of the mandible (lower jaw), a feature shared only with E.grandidieri among species of Eliurus.|$|E
25|$|The style {{developed}} during {{rest of the}} Azuchi-Momoyama period (1568–1600) and was characterised by small rooms of usually {{four and a half}} tatami, or even less, that had a tokonoma <b>and</b> <b>shelves.</b> These buildings were normally entered through a garden often by means of an indirect curved or diagonal path that would not allow an instant view of the teahouse.|$|E
25|$|Entering {{from the}} stairs via a vestibule, {{there were three}} main rooms — one for cattleyas, laelias, and hybrids; one for odontoglossums, oncidiums, miltonias, and their hybrids; and a {{tropical}} room (according to Fer-de-Lance). It must have been quite a sight with the angle-iron staging gleaming in its silver paint and on the concrete benches <b>and</b> <b>shelves</b> 10,000 pots of orchids in glorious, exultant bloom.|$|E

25|$|As I {{walked down}} {{at this place}} I was walled on both sides by those {{inaccessible}} high rocky barren hills which hang over one’s head in some places and appear very terrible; and from them springs many little currents {{of water from the}} sides and clefts which trickle down to some lower part where it runs swiftly over the stones <b>and</b> <b>shelves</b> in the way, which makes a pleasant rush and murmuring noise and like a snowball is increased by each spring trickling down on either side of those hills, and so descends into the bottoms which are a Moorish ground in which in many places the waters stand, and so form some of those Lakes as it did here.|$|E
500|$|As most North American comic shops {{focus on}} teenage and adult customers, and The Beguiling itself mainly on adults, the owners wanted {{to fill a}} void by opening the first children's comic shop in North America, and {{possibly}} the world. [...] Little Island Comics opened 6 September 2011 at 742 Bathurst Street in the Annex, close to The Beguiling. [...] The shop was designed with children in mind, with bright colours <b>and</b> <b>shelves</b> at child-height. [...] When Mirvish Village closed in 2017, so did Little Island; several of the staff moved to Page& Panel.|$|E
500|$|The {{hotel was}} {{completed}} in July at a total cost of £800. It included a building made of iron, containing a main room with counters <b>and</b> <b>shelves</b> and storage above, an attached kitchen, two wooden sleeping huts, outhouses, and an enclosed stable-yard. The building was stocked with provisions shipped from London and Constantinople, {{as well as local}} purchases from the British camp near Kadikoi and the French camp at nearby Kamiesch. Seacole sold anything – [...] "from a needle to an anchor"—to army officers and visiting sightseers. Meals were served at the Hotel, cooked by two black cooks, and the kitchen also provided outside catering.|$|E

500|$|By 1716, {{the tower}} was {{reported}} to Parliament as being in a [...] "ruinous condition", and an enquiry concluded that repairs and restoration should go ahead {{at a cost of}} £870. The work commenced under Nicholas Hawksmoor, the Surveyor General, but staff turnover in the Office of Works and accusations of corruption slowed the work. Cut-backs were made, in particular to the plans to strengthen the roof of the tower with fire-resilient brick vaults; despite this, the costs totalled £1,118 {{by the end of the}} project in 1719. The outside of the tower was reworked to form its modern appearance, with plainer, larger windows and a simpler parapet, and a new chimney to keep members of the House of Lords warm while they were reading the records. Specialised wooden cupboards <b>and</b> <b>shelves</b> were installed on the first floor to hold the documents. Further work was carried out in 1726 to improve the security and safety of the tower, particularly from the threat of fire, at a cost of £508.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{creative}} boom while writing lyrics for the album, all {{three members of}} Blink-182 faced setbacks while recording Dude Ranch. DeLonge was having vocal problems and spent much time recording and re-recording vocal tracks, and Hoppus realized he too was having difficulty singing after losing his voice during a one-off Christmas concert. Forced to cancel the final week of recording in December 1996, Hoppus realized {{the magnitude of the}} situation and quit smoking in order {{to take care of his}} voice, which was stressed due to lack of vocal warm-ups, full days of vocal tracks, and the strain of singing for [...] "Dammit", which was accidentally written just outside Hoppus' vocal range. Meanwhile, Raynor had broken both heels and was in a wheelchair. Raynor was well enough to record the drum tracks for the album while on crutches. Aside from the recording, the band spent time playing Crash Bandicoot and [...] "reading the articles from the shelves <b>and</b> <b>shelves</b> of Playboys that the studio had thoughtfully provided." [...] The group ate lunch nearly each day at Sombrero, a local Mexican restaurant namedropped in [...] "Josie", and Chinese for dinner from Encinitas' Pick Up Stix.|$|E

2500|$|The epigenomics era largely began more recently, about 2000. [...] One {{major source}} of {{epigenetic}} change is altered methylation of CpG islands at the promoter region of genes (see DNA methylation in cancer).

2500|$|Accordingly, the schoolroom was {{equipped}} with child-sized furnishings, [...] "practical life" [...] activities such as sweeping and washing tables, and teaching material that Montessori had developed herself. Children were given freedom to choose and carry out their own activities, at their own paces and following their own inclinations. In these conditions, Montessori {{made a number of}} observations which became the foundation of her work. First, she observed great concentration in the children and spontaneous repetition of chosen activities. She also observed a strong tendency in the children to order their own environment, straightening tables <b>and</b> <b>shelves</b> and ordering materials. As children chose some activities over others, Montessori refined the materials she offered to them. Over time, the children began to exhibit what she called [...] "spontaneous discipline".|$|E
2500|$|In May 2016, Apple {{significantly}} redesigned its Union Square Apple Store {{in downtown}} San Francisco, adding large glass doors for the entry, open spaces with touch-sensitive tables <b>and</b> <b>shelves</b> for product displays, and rebranded rooms for the store. [...] "The Avenue" [...] {{is the central}} location for hardware, {{as well as for}} receiving advice from salespersons and [...] "Creative Pros" [...] - individuals with specialized knowledge of music, creativity, apps and photography. The [...] "Genius Bar" [...] becomes the [...] "Genius Grove", a tree-lined area for help and support. [...] "The Forum" [...] features a large video screen and offers game nights, sessions with experts in creative arts, and community events. [...] "The Boardroom" [...] lets aspiring developers and entrepreneurs learn how to use their products to their full potential. [...] "The Plaza", while limited to select locations, offers a [...] "park-like" [...] space outside the store featuring free 24/7 Wi-Fi access and will host live concerts on some weekends. Designed by Jony Ive and Angela Ahrendts, the idea was to make Apple Stores into [...] "town squares", in which people come naturally to the store as a gathering place, and to [...] "help foster human experiences that draw people out of their digital bubbles". The new design will be adopted to every store Apple has, and while renovation is undergoing, stores are either relocated or temporarily closed. For some locations, including its flagship Fifth Avenue store in New York City, the redesign means substantial expansion of space, requiring dismantling, and possibly reworking, of its physical properties.|$|E
