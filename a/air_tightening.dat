Detta för att ta fram vilken metod som är lämpligast att tillämpa med avseende på kostnad.   Metod: Metoderna som tillämpats för att besvara målet var observationer, mätningar, beräkningar, litteraturstudie samt intervjuer. Den huvudsakliga metoden som användes var observationstekniken ”observatör som deltagare”. Intervjuer tillämpades för att anbringa ny kunskap men även verifiera empirin hämtad från observationerna.   Resultat: Studien visar att det finns både mindre och markanta skillnader mellan objektens lufttätnings- och provtryckningsmetoder som genererar både för och nackdelar. De största skillnaderna var framförallt vid fönster- och dörrutförandet, materialvalet i installationsväggen och om en tidig provtryckning utförs eller inte. Fördelarna med Gripen var att de inte var beroende av utomstående aktörers utförande vid fönsteranslutningen samt att de hade ett moment mindre under kontrollen av klimatskalet. Studien visar även att Gripen hade en lägre totalkostnad för lufttäthetsarbetet än Vimans Trädgård. Dock var kostnaden per kvadratmeter desto högre för varje färdigställd kvadratmeter. Efter en noggrann strukturell jämförelse bedömdes Vimans Trädgårds tillvägagångssätt var den mest kostnadseffektiva lufttätnings- och provtryckningsmetoden utifrån kr/kvm, se Tabell 13. Konsekvenser: Studien visar att båda objektens metoder fungerar för att nå byggnadens ställda lufttäthetkrav. Då metoderna liknade varandra på många punkter kunde slutsatsen dras att lufttätningsutförandet av fönster- och dörranslutningar hade en stor inverkan på tiden samt kostnaden. Slutligen kan följande rekommendationer ges, en byggnads lufttäthet bör säkerställas i ett tidigt skede, företagens luftätningsmetoder bör fortsätta utvecklas samt en enhetlig lufttätnings- och provtryckningsmetod bör utformas och appliceras inom hela företaget. Begränsningar: Rapportens undersökningsstrategi är en kvantitativ fallstudie. Studien begränsas till fallstudiens båda undersökningsobjekt och deras lufttätnings- samt provtryckningsmetod utan avseende till materialkostnader. Undersökningen begränsas även till objektens förutsättningar som materialval men tar ingen hänsyn till geografisk placering eller väderstrecksorientering. Detta medför att studien är giltig under specifika förhållanden. Vid en eventuell upprepning kan studien påvisa andra resultat och generera skilda slutsatser än det som vidtagits i denna utredning. Purpose: The {{purpose is}} to provide an {{overview}} {{of the cost of the}} work performance of two <b>air</b> <b>tightening</b> and pressure testing methods through a structural comparison of the case study's investigative objects. This is to find out which method is most appropriate to apply in terms of cost. Method: The chosen methods, used to answer the goal, were observations, measurements, calculations, literature studies and interviews. The main method used was the observation technique "observer as a participant". Interviews were applied to conceive new knowledge, but also to verify the information from the observations. Findings: The study shows that there are both minor and significant differences between the objects <b>air</b> <b>tightening</b> and pressure testing methods that generate both pros and cons. The main differences were mainly the execution of the windows and doors, the choice of materials in the installation wall and if an early pressure test is performed or not. The benefits of Gripen were that they were not dependent on external operator’s performance at the window connection and that they had a moment less under the control of the climate scale. The study also shows that Gripen had a lower total cost of air tightness than Vimans Trädgård. However, the cost per square meter was the higher for each completed square meter. After a careful structural comparison, Vimans Trädgård ́s approach was evaluated as the most cost-effective <b>air</b> <b>tightening</b> and pressure testing method, see Table 13.   Implications: The study shows that the <b>air</b> <b>tightening</b> methods of both objects work to reach the building's airtightness requirements. As the methods were similar at many points, it could be concluded that the <b>air</b> <b>tightening</b> of window- and door connections had a major impact on time as well as the cost. Finally, the following recommendations that can be given is, building airtightness should be ensured at an early stage, companies' <b>air</b> <b>tightening</b> and pressure testing methods should continue to evolve and a uniform <b>air</b> <b>tightening</b> and pressure testing method should be designed and applied throughout the companies. Limitations: The report's investigation strategy is a quantitative case study. The study is limited to two study objects of the case study and their <b>air</b> <b>tightening</b> and pressure testing method without regard to material costs. The investigation is also limited to the object's conditions as material choice, but does not consider geographical location or weather-orientation. This means that the study is valid under specific conditions. In the event of a repeat, the study can demonstrate other results and generate different conclusions than those undertaken in this investigation. ...|$|E

40|$|As a {{developing}} country, the Dominican Republic {{does not have}} the financial resources or expertise in the construction field to fully implement many of the available sustainable technologies. However, sustainable approaches can be both subtle and radical for their application to this country. If our intention as designers is to really make a change, then the answer is balance, a balance between simple yet effective techniques and new technologies. The Passive House standard, which focuses on energy efficiency by super insulating and <b>air</b> <b>tightening</b> the envelope, {{is one of the most}} rigorous energy standards in Europe and the United States. Dominican vernacular architecture, without any specific set of standards uses the opposite approach of cross ventilation and open air. It has been proven itself to satisfy user’s needs for comfort since being colonized by Spain. With the help of design software that analyzes the energy performance of buildings, this thesis will compare, analyze and contrast the performance of an average Dominican house against modified versions that applies vernacular and passive house techniques. The highlights of these analyses will be utilized to design a building that merges the best of both techniques and responds to the environmental, economic and social needs of the Dominican Republic...|$|E
40|$|Commissioning California's houses {{can result}} in better {{performing}} systems and houses. In turn, this will result in more efficient use of energy, carbon emission reductions, and improved occupant comfort. In particular, commissioning houses can save {{a significant amount of}} HVAC-related energy (15 to 30 % in existing houses, 10 to 20 % in new conventional houses, and up to 8 % in advanced energy efficiency houses). The process that we considered includes corrective measures that could be implemented together during construction or during a single site visit (e. g., <b>air</b> <b>tightening,</b> duct sealing, and refrigerant and air handler airflow corrections in a new or existing house). Taking advantage of additional, more complex opportunities (e. g., installing new windows in an existing house, replacing the heating and air conditioning system in a new or existing house) {{can result in}} additional HVAC-related energy savings (60 to 75 % in existing houses, and 50 to 60 % in new conventional houses). The commissioning-related system and house performance improvements and energy savings translate to additional benefits throughout California and beyond. By applying commissioning principles to their work, the building community (builders and contractors) benefit from reduced callbacks and lower warranty costs. HERS raters and inspectors will have access to an expanded market sector. As the commissioning process rectifies construction defects and code problems, building code officials benefit from better compliance with codes. The utilities benefit from reduced peak demand, which can translate into lower energy acquisition costs. As houses perform closer to expectations, governmental bodies (e. g., the California Energy Commission and the Air Resources Board) benefit from greater assurance that actual energy consumption and carbon emissions are closer to the levels mandated in codes and standards, resulting in better achievement of state energy conservation and environmental goals. California residents' quality of life is improved through better indoor environmental comfort and lower energy bills. Lower energy bills free up money for residents to spend on other needs or goals, such as additional education and health and welfare. With an expansion of existing industries and the development of new commissioning-related industries, related jobs and tax revenues will increase, further increasing {{the quality of life for}} California...|$|E

40|$|We empirically {{assess whether}} firms face economies and/or diseconomies of scale {{with respect to}} air {{pollution}} control by evaluating the effects of production on firmlevel air emission levels using a panel of Czech firms during the country’s transitional period of 1993 to 1998. By estimating a separate set of production-related coefficients for each individual sector, the analysis permits economies/diseconomies of scale to differ across sectors. More important, the analysis allows these scale effects to vary over time, which seems critical {{in the context of}} a transition economy, as the Czech government was <b>tightening</b> <b>air</b> protection polices by imposing more stringent emission limits and escalating emission charge rates.
