5|$|Leaks were noticed {{immediately}} after {{the installation of the}} topping. Harry S. Peterson Co. attempted many times to fix the leaks. In 1991, the owners contracted Trow to investigate the chronic leaking and find a solution. Two options were provided, but upon consulting with Coreslab, it was determined that neither plan could go forward due to the HCS not being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> additional loads.|$|E
5|$|A hub is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> low {{bandwidth}} devices mixed with other speed device via a special PID value, PRE. This is required as a USB hub {{functions as a}} very simple repeater, broadcasting the host message to all connected devices regardless if the packet was for it or not. This means in a mixed speed environment, {{there is a potential}} danger that a low speed will misinterpret a high or full speed signal from the host.|$|E
5|$|An {{aviation}} centre {{was constructed}} {{at the airport}} in 1976, which included a 12-unit motel, flight training school, and aircraft overhaul shop; the latter is no longer maintained. Later, a helicopter flight and training club was established. In September2007, Pacific Coastal Airlines began offering daily flights from this airfield to the Vancouver International Airport and Calgary International Airport for a period of twelve months. During this time, the airline served an 22,000passengers at the airport. It has been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> emergency Boeing 747landings since the 1970s, but this capability has never been tested; the runway has been used by Airbus 320s, Boeing 727-200s, Boeing 737-400s, Boeing 737-700s, and Cessna 150s.|$|E

5|$|In 1935, O'Reilly took up an {{appointment}} at Sydney Grammar School, {{one of the}} leading private schools in the state, having been offered 50% paid leave for his cricket commitments. There he taught English, history and business. In 1939 he took a job in the sports store of close friend, teammate and fellow Irish Catholic Stan McCabe, which was located on George Street, the city centre's main thoroughfare. O'Reilly was a financial partner in the business, but following the outbreak of World War II, the sales revenue began to suffer and O'Reilly left as the store would not be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> two stakeholders.|$|E
5|$|In 1948 Kathleen married Frank Cole, a World War II veteran, {{and moved}} the family to Virginia. Godwin was further {{inspired}} by her mother's determination to continue writing after having a second child. According to Godwin, {{much of her time}} growing up was spent in the newsroom, where her mother worked. She also witnessed her mother's plays and novels being rejected. Godwin's autobiography creates the impression that much of her own writing was intended to accomplish the things her mother could not. As Cole's salary increased and he was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> the family, Godwin's mother focused on being a wife and homemaker, eventually not writing at all.|$|E

5|$|Many {{women are}} {{convinced}} that their husbands are putting their lives at risk by engaging in extramarital sexual relations without using protection; however, because of their secondary status, they are often unwilling to initiate discussions about HIV/AIDS in the home. Most women in Malawi do not view divorce as a viable option, even when their husbands are HIV-positive and refuse {{to protect them from}} the virus by wearing condoms during marital intercourse. Because they lack the education and training needed to seek gainful employment, women are not usually <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> themselves and their children outside of marriage without resorting to commercial sex work for money.|$|E
5|$|McCracken, {{who came}} to Hollywood after winning acclaim in the 1943 {{production}} of Oklahoma!, was deeply discouraged by her experiences filming the Hollywood Canteen number and did not like working with Prinz. As a choreographer he {{made no effort to}} integrate his dances into specific story lines, or to choreograph specific dance steps. This resulted deep disillusionment for McCracken, whose Oklahoma! dances were choreographed by Agnes de Mille, since Prinz was not <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> or advance McCracken's artistic development. However, he gave her latitude to incorporate ballet in her dance routine, and Prinz did not object to her ideas.|$|E
5|$|The keep {{is unusual}} {{both for the}} period and for Devon as a whole, being a very strong {{defensive}} structure, albeit without any independent source of water or facilities to support a garrison {{in the event of}} a siege. Other rectangular 11th century keeps in Devon existed, including at Exter and Lydford, and were typically associated with the king or major nobles. Few were built on top of fresh mottes, as at Okehampton, and this may have been made possible in this case because the motte was largely natural and therefore <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> the heavy weight.|$|E

5|$|Though the {{original}} bridge {{was designed for}} 38-ton vehicles, when it was inspected around 1995 it was found unable {{to comply with a}} European Union directive for supporting vehicles up to 40 tons, and would only be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> 17-ton vehicles. A feasibility study was carried out for a new Tamar Crossing in 1991, but was rejected as the estimated cost would be around £300 million. The existing bridge could not be closed as it was being used by over 40,000 vehicles a day.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{learning}} that the Prussian army was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> him, Wellington decided to offer battle on the Mont-Saint-Jean escarpment, across the Brussels road. Here he withstood repeated attacks by the French throughout the afternoon, {{aided by the}} progressively arriving Prussians. In the evening Napoleon committed his last reserves to a desperate final attack, which was narrowly beaten back. With the Prussians breaking through on the French right flank, Wellington's Anglo-allied army counter-attacked in the centre, and the French army was routed.|$|E
5|$|Within {{a year of}} {{arriving}} in Harbin, China, Kalep's son died and her husband disappeared. Kalep was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> herself by working as an interpreter—she spoke Russian, German, English and Chinese—for a British general in Shenyang. She was also employed by Zhang Zuolin and later his son, Zhang Xueliang, but {{decided to return to}} Estonia in 1925. She traveled through Indonesia, Italy and France before eventually arriving in Tallinn in 1926. Soon afterwards she settled in Paris, where she studied the art of oil painting with Russian painter Alexandre Jacovleff. She married Rolf Baron von Hoeningen-Bergendorff, who was of German or Austrian descent.|$|E

5|$|As a result, the Americans {{entered the}} battle with a very good picture of where, when, and in what {{strength}} the Japanese would appear. Nimitz knew that the Japanese had negated their numerical advantage by dividing their ships into four separate task groups, all too-widely separated to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> each other. This dispersal resulted in few fast ships being available to escort the Carrier Striking Force, {{reducing the number of}} anti-aircraft guns protecting the carriers. Nimitz calculated that the aircraft on his three carriers, plus those on Midway Island, gave the U.S. rough parity with Yamamoto's four carriers, mainly because American carrier air groups were larger than Japanese ones. The Japanese, by contrast, remained mainly unaware of their opponent's true strength and dispositions even after the battle began.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, Chadwick was {{appointed}} Dean of Christ Church, uniquely a dual {{role as a}} cathedral dean and head of a college. This period was not entirely happy; a scholarly ability to see all sides of a question, along with an ingrained desire not to upset his colleagues, sometimes made it {{hard for him to}} make a quick or firm decision. However, during his time as Dean the college benefited from a continued programme of renovation with internal changes that provided more student accommodation. The position gave Chadwick the chance to influence the musical direction of the cathedral. In The Independent newspaper, obituary writer Andrew Louth notes that at the retirement of Sydney Watson as organist, when he and Chadwick played piano duets together Chadwick's technique was the equal of Watson's. The new organist, Simon Preston, had ambitious plans for improving musical standards, and Chadwick was pleased to be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> these, not least by raising funds for a new organ.|$|E
5|$|Initially the old {{tower was}} {{converted}} into a stronger keep which was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> artillery guns on its roof, a gatehouse was built alongside it, four stirrup towers – so-called because of their shape – a curtain wall was constructed around {{the outside of the}} castle, and bastions erected around the wall. Towards the end of this phase of work the castle was altered in a frantic burst of work, possibly driven on by pressure from the King himself. The height of the curtain wall was increased, the gatehouse extended into an entrance bastion, a new network of underground passages installed, and foreworks added around the outside of the bastions. By the end of 1540 the castle was garrisoned with 17 men and equipped with artillery, with Chute appointed as its captain.|$|E
