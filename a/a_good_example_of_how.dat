25|$|Until the 1960s, {{there was}} little focus on long-distance freight between the major centres. Instead, the Main South Line was used to feed its many branch lines, with the {{majority}} of goods trains being local services between regional areas and major centres or harbours in Christchurch (Lyttelton), Timaru, Oamaru, Dunedin (Port Chalmers), and Invercargill (Bluff). <b>A</b> <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> regionalised this traffic was comes from the Dunedin-Invercargill portion of the line. North of Clinton were five branches whose traffic essentially ran to and from Dunedin/Port Chalmers, while south of Clinton were four branches whose traffic essentially ran to or from Invercargill/Bluff. As this short-distance local traffic declined in the 1950s and 1960s and branch lines closed, long-distance freight increased, with through services between the major centres rising to prominence. The concentration of exports on fewer ports and the development of containerisation spurred on long-distance freight, and the first freight train from Christchurch to Invercargill was introduced in December 1970 on a 16-hour schedule.|$|E

It was shot in a single frame, with the camera approaching Madonna, as she stands behind a pillar. She rotates around it and sings the song, as air blows through the room. The video ends with Madonna looking up towards the camera the last time, and then closing her eyes. It was treated with sepia color. Carol Vernallis, author of Experiencing music video: aesthetics and cultural context felt that the video was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> image can direct the viewer's attention towards the shift in instrumentation and arrangement of the song.

We get some more fun nuggets about how Earth 2 differs from Earth 1... Your Bose headphones cannot protect you from the awesome sonic power of [...] "The Box". UGO Networks' Alex Zalben wrote [...] "Two weeks in, Fringe {{is still the best}} damn show currently on TV". Zalben loved the serial aspects of the plot, praised Anna Torv's performance, but disliked how no one has realized Fauxlivia's true identity. Josh Wigler from MTV enjoyed the episode particularly because although he found the parallel universe a [...] "compelling world, sometimes it's nice to just kick your feet up on the table and know that you're home... Two episodes down, and it's safe to say that the third season of [...] "Fringe" [...] is off to a very strong start". Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly thought it was a terrific episode, with [...] "a tremendously clever game-changer of an ending...This Fringe was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> far the series has come since its first season, dominated by pre-credits scare-scenarios for Fringe Division to investigate, some of which spilled over into the show's mythology.

500|$|... "All Around the World" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Jenna Rubenstein of MTV {{thought that the}} [...] "fist-pumping club banger" [...] is a complete departure from Bieber's previous work, while Diadem Pambid of the International Business Times stated that the singer joined the [...] "'synth-pop' bandwagon" [...] along with Britney Spears, Chris Brown and Usher. Jocelyn Vena also of MTV stated that the song could have been recorded by Usher, due to its [...] "grinding, fist-pumping" [...] background. Entertainment Weekly columnist Ray Rahman gave [...] "All Around the World" [...] a positive review, and stated: [...] "a Euro beat worthy of The Wanted? The vocal swagger of Chris Brown? Lyrics smacking of One Direction? Check, check, and check, please!" [...] Rick Florino of Artistdirect rated [...] "All Around the World" [...] five out of five stars, and commented that the track {{is not only a}} sequel to [...] "Baby", but is also [...] "a whole new level for pop itself." [...] Becky Bain of Idolator explained that the song is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> Bieber is taking [...] "baby steps to 'swaggy' adulthood through the evolution of his music — keep the content G-Rated, but make the beat something the older club-going crowd can enjoy. So far, it’s working." [...] Amy Sciaretto of Pop Crush gave the track a mixed review, and deemed it as highly similar to the work of Spears, stating: [...] "If you told us this song was penned for Britney Spears for her last album Femme Fatale, we'd Believe it, because the computerized style and the thick vocal effects remind us of recent Brit material. It's safe to say that 'All Around the World' is a club banger. And while we love Bieber, it's not our favorite song on Believe so far." ...|$|E
500|$|Mini Metro {{received}} [...] "generally favourable" [...] reception from critics {{according to}} aggregate review website Metacritic. Technology Tell writer, Jenni Lada described Mini Metro as [...] "aesthetically pleasing" [...] and found {{playing the game}} an oddly relaxing experience, despite the game's attempt to put the player under pressure. Lena LeRay, of IndieGames.com, also felt that Mini Metro had a relaxing tone and complimented its intuitive interface. LeRay appreciated changes that were made during the early access phase, noting that audio and the Daily Challenge mode were welcome additions, and the interface improvements had diminished her initial complaints about the game. Reviewing the PC version, GamesTM thought that the depth of Mini Metros gameplay along with the difficulty scaling kept the game interesting. However, they did question why the game hadn't been released for smartphones yet, pointing out that such devices would be suited for the game's simple interface. Kill Screen editor, Ethan Gach commended the game for its simplicity and elegance, having combined interactive aesthetics with a robust simulation. Alec Meer of Rock, Paper, Shotgun praised the game for being a [...] "mesmerising challenge of logic and aesthetics". He particularly enjoyed how beautifully the gameplay descended into chaos as the difficulty gradually increased, calling it [...] "elegant even in disaster". He also thought that Mini Metro was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> to release game in early access. Reviewing the mobile version, Gamezebo writer Rob Rich commended the visual design and intuitive touch controls. He thought {{that the use of}} geometric shapes to represent commuters and stations helped simplify the complicated tasks, resulting in an accessible game. Pocket Gamer reviewer Christian Valentin remarked that the game felt confusing early on but became [...] "surprisingly engaging".|$|E

500|$|... "Mrs. California" [...] {{received}} mixed {{responses from}} critics. The A.V. Club reviewer Myles McNutt said the episode had {{the possibility of}} being a great episode of The Office, but that it did not live up to that possibility. He suggested that the writers could tell jokes, but could not successfully [...] "break a story anymore". He also called the subplot a mixed bag for featuring Dwight as a caricature of his former self, but complimented the character development for Darryl which started in [...] "Lotto". He gave the episodes a C+. Hannah Lawrence of Hollywood.com called the episode a large improvement over [...] "Gettysburg" [...] and also called it possibly her [...] "favorite episode of the season so far". Chris Plante of New York called Robert California the worst part of The Office and said that he kept Andy from being more of a lead character for the series. TV Guide writer Bruce Fretts criticized the episode for under using guest star Maura Tierney. He also said that the episode suffered without former series star Steve Carell to serve as the comic foil. IGN writer Cindy White said the episode did not feel like The Office and called it [...] "the exact opposite". Despite this, she went on to compliment Susan asking Andy on a date and the pairing of Darryl and Val as a couple, saying that the latter had possibilities. She ultimately gave the episode a 7.5/10. Joseph Kratzer from What Culture? gave the episode three out of five stars and wrote, [...] "I'm going {{to go out on a}} bit of a limb here and say that while 'Mrs. California' was of course not a return to form for The Office, it was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> the series might define itself in this new Michael-less era." [...] M. Giant of Television without Pity gave the episode a B+. [...] After viewing [...] "Mrs. California," [...] Washington Post writer Hank Stuever named The Office one of the ten best TV shows of 2011 and said that the episode proved the series could still deliver cringe humor without Carell. Multiple critics complimented the cold open to the episode.|$|E

2500|$|Amy Ratcliffe of IGN {{rated the}} episodes 8.6 out of 10, saying [...] "Overall, tonight's super serving of Once Upon a Time covered {{a lot of}} ground with forward plot {{movement}} and character development.

It had 3,420 seats and was built with funds jointly donated by the Singapore government and the public through [...] "a-dollar-a-brick" [...] campaign with song requests made on radio. On 14 May 1964, The then Minister for Culture, S Rajaratnam, formally received the keys of the theatre from the company which carried out the construction said: [...] "The theatre provides <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> {{the success of any}} effort depends ultimately on the co-operation and dedication of {{people from all walks of}} life." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite Turkey {{being an}} officially secular country, the Preamble of the Constitution states that [...] "there shall be no {{interference}} whatsoever {{of the sacred}} religious feelings in State affairs and politics." [...] In order to control the way religion is perceived by adherents, the State pays imams' wages (only for Sunni Muslims), and provides religious education (of the Sunni Muslim variety) in public schools. The State has a Department of Religious Affairs, directly under the Prime Minister bureaucratically, responsible for organizing the Sunni Muslim religion – including what will {{and will not be}} mentioned in sermons given at mosques, especially on Fridays.

[...] The careering course of the wind is embodied in the headlong pace of the poem. [...] Rachel Bromwich called [...] "The Wind" [...] one of [...] "the outstanding expressions of Dafydd's wonder and awe at the mysteries of the cosmic forces", but pointed out that in the end Dafydd curbs this force to act as a love-messenger to Morfudd. [...] The poet Gwyneth Lewis sees the poem as [...] "a hymn to the havoc that art can work in the world", while for the scholar Helen Fulton the wind is a metaphor for [...] "freedom and autonomy from the laws of governing society".

2500|$|The {{composition}} {{is known for}} its harmonic sophistication and extensive use of inverted chords, including third inversions such as B7/A. The first chord of the verse (D major/A) is a non-diatonic chord. The tonic chord (E major) usually only appears with the major 3rd or the 5th in the bass. The entire verse progression sounds restless and ambiguous, until the line [...] "God only knows what I'd be without you" [...] when the chord progression finally reaches a clear goal (A–E/G#–F#m7–E). This has been cited by musicologists as <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> lyrical meaning can be supported and enhanced by a chord progression—along with the melody hook which also provides an example of [...] "a sense of increasing melodic energy that comes by way of the gradually ascending line". Stephen Downes similarly named the song's [...] "tonal plasticity" [...] emphasized by the disuse of authentic cadences and root-position tonics as the reason for its [...] "expansiveness". In musicologist Philip Lambert's opinion, the song's vocal counterpoint evokes the sacred traditions of a cantata by Johann Sebastian Bach or an oratorio by George Frideric Handel. Andy Gill of the post-punk band Gang of Four describes the composition: ...|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the {{submission}} of Lucania and the bringing back of hostages, Livy {{said that the}} Lucanians were willing to give hostages as a pledge of good faith. Cornell remarks that [...] "he intimation of that the Lucanians’ submission {{was the result of}} military action is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> events could be improved in the telling." [...] Forsythe points out that Livy noted that in 296 BC the Romans suppressed plebeian disturbances in Lucania on the behest of the Lucanian aristocracy. He argues that this suggests divisions in Lucania over the alliance with Rome and that, if this was also the case in 298 BC, Barbatus might have gone to Lucania to quell any possible local resistance to the alliance as well as to prevent Samnite raids and to collect the agreed hostages. Forsythe also notes that Barbatus’ campaign in Etruria could be explained in three ways: 1) it could be fictive; 2) Barbatus could have campaigned in both Samnium and Etruria; 3) Barbatus participated in the campaigns linked to the front which led to the Battle of Sentinum in 295 BC, and that this may have included operations in Etruria in that year, but it might have been attributed by later historians to his consulship in 298 BC. As for the claim that Barbatus subdued all of Lucania, Forsythe suggests that this is [...] "perhaps part truth and part a Roman aristocratic exaggeration." ...|$|E
2500|$|John Murphy of musicOMH {{positively}} {{reviewed the}} single as follows: [...] "First single 'Rock Steady' is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> at ease All Saints sound with their skanking new direction. It feels fresh and cool, and the backing vocals from the Appleton sisters fit in beautifully." [...] Matthew Chisling of Allmusic described the song as a [...] "kicking track" [...] and [...] "solid dance hit with enticing grooves". M. H. Lo of Stylus Magazine gave the track a {{nine out of}} ten rating, saying: [...] "With a brilliantly insistent chorus, a backing track that deftly weaves a ska rhythm around a kind of breakbeat, the song will not leave your mind as long as you're willing to give it three spins. The golden age of British girl bands receives reinforcements." [...] Hamish Champ of Virgin Media mentioned in a review of Studio 1: [...] "From the opener, 'Rock Steady', one can't help feeling that the quartet has made a conscious decision to move into Girls Aloud territory." [...] Leon McDermott of the Sunday Herald also gave the single a thumbs-up, saying: [...] "An updated take on the sound they made their own, it adds cheeky nods to Jamaican-inspired two tone, ska and rock steady the genre that provides the title for their skanking, jumping comeback single." [...] Adrian Thrill of the Daily Mail positively reviewed the song: [...] "New single 'Rock Steady' finds their voices blending brilliantly over a backdrop of rimshot drumming and heavy, dubby bass." [...] Malcolm Mackenzie of The London Paper said [...] "Rock Steady" [...] is [...] "girly ska pop reminiscent of early Bananarama and [...] Lily Allen." ...|$|E
