5000|$|In February 1942, Slovakia {{became the}} first Nazi ally to agree to deportations. The Nazis had asked for 20,000 young able-bodied Jews for labour duties.

One Jewish writer stated: By the end of June 1942, some 52,000 Slovak Jews had been deported, mainly to Auschwitz and to their death. Then, however, the deportations slowed to a standstill.

We use two approximations for the participation in informal economy, self-employment and employment in small workplace (10 and fewer workers or 5 and fewer workers). Both statuses are potentially associated with the participation in an informal economy. Using the similar methodology as presented in Bosh and Maloney (2007), we show that recent recession caused substantial increase in transitions of workers from formal into both self-employment and employment.

40|$|ISSN 0139 - 5475 National audienceThe paper {{deals with}} the {{influence}} <b>of</b> <b>Slovak</b> folk costumes on urban clothing in Slovakia {{during the second half}} of the 19 th and the 1 st half of the 20 th century. The interest in folk costumes <b>of</b> the <b>Slovak</b> population first appeared as part <b>of</b> the <b>Slovak</b> national movement in the 2 nd half of the 19 th century. It culminated in the adoption of the Memorandum <b>of</b> the <b>Slovak</b> nation in 1861 in Turčiansky Svätý Martin by 'national clothing'. The impressive women dresses of national celebrations spread. They reminded festive folk costumes of the women from Turčianska, Liptovská and Oravská counties. They were popular; and in addition to it they corresponded to the tendencies of contemporary fashion. The men's 'national' wear had a national-demonstrative character. Blouses of squires from the region Dolná Orava became models for it. The male "national wear" was fundamentally different from men's contemporary clothing. Therefore, onlya small group <b>of</b> nationally conscious <b>Slovaks</b> wore it. In the next period, folk costumes, in particular Slovak embroidery influenced the urban clothing at times when it was important to demonstrate national identities and acclamation <b>of</b> <b>Slovaks.</b> Živena, the <b>Association</b> <b>of</b> <b>Slovak</b> Women, played an important role in the impact of folk costumes on urban popular clothing, which was shown in the Slovak Embroidery exhibition in Turčiansky Svätý Martin in 1887. The association activated cultural and political life and helped to develop the Slovak people's national consciousness. Under its influence a "national costume" extended in an urban environment in the late 19 th century. It was a festive authentic folk costume, worn by women on festive events of nationally unique representational character. In the late 19 th century, nationally conscious men wore 'national shirts' with Slovak embroidery. Important role in transferring Slovak embroidery on the women's and children's urban wear had the Dennica and the Živena magazines; in Skalica it was the Lipa and Družstvo companies; later the company Detva. The share <b>of</b> the <b>Association</b> Izabella is a matter of a more thorough examination. After termination of the Ugrian state, the spontaneous wearing of 'national costume' and 'national shirts' was an expression of joy and freedom as well as nationality within the independent Czechoslovak Republic. In the affluent environment, it was also a matter of representation. So called 'housekeeping courses' (Gazdinské kurzy) of the Živena, and opening of the Institute of Milan Rastislav Štefánik in Turč. Sv. Martin in 1926, together with the County School for Teachers in Schools of Housekeeping, also had the next impact on urban popular clothing. During the World War II, women wore 'national costume' for exceptional celebrations; children also wore Slovak embroidered clothing. Spontaneous wearing of 'national costume', often in an improvised way, was happening at the time <b>of</b> liberation <b>of</b> <b>Slovak</b> towns and villages after the World War H. After 1945, the Centre for Folk Art Production effected urban popular clothing in particular. Influence of fashion clothing by folk costumes is a common phenomenon. In Slovakia, in comparison with Germany and Austria, this process did not result into the creation of a representative contemporary 'national costume'...|$|R
