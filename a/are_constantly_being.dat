25|$|The sun's corona is much hotter (by {{a factor}} from 150 to 450) than the visible {{surface of the}} Sun: the photosphere's average {{temperature}} is 5800 kelvin compared to the corona's one to three million kelvins. The corona is 10−12 times as dense as the photosphere, and so produces about one-millionth as much visible light. The corona is separated from the photosphere by the relatively shallow chromosphere. The exact mechanism by which the corona is heated is still the subject of some debate, but likely possibilities include induction by the Sun's magnetic field and magnetohydrodynamic waves from below. The outer edges of the Sun's corona <b>are</b> <b>constantly</b> <b>being</b> transported away due to open magnetic flux and hence generating the solar wind.|$|E

25|$|Scope: While new {{reactions}} <b>are</b> <b>constantly</b> <b>being</b> discovered, most reactions have extremely narrow {{substrate scope}} {{and the reason}} for such narrow scope is often not understood. In the field of palladium catalysis, after the foundations of mechanistic understanding were established, the scope of reactions saw rapid growth. Knowing the factors that affected each step of catalysis allowed for the chemists to envision and pursue new reactions of high synthetic utility, such as C-H bond activation reactions. In the field hydrogen bond catalysis, chemists have not yet reached a stage where new types of reactivity can be easily and systematically targeted. At this point, reaction discovery is useful, but more detailed mechanistic study is required to realize the full potential of hydrogen bond catalysis.|$|E
25|$|In Canada, many of {{the land}} cession {{treaties}} the British made with the Ojibwe provided for their rights for continued hunting, fishing and gathering of natural resources after land sales. The government signed numbered treaties in northwestern Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta. British Columbia had no signed treaties until the late 20th century, and most areas have no treaties yet. The government and First Nations are continuing to negotiate treaty land entitlements and settlements. The treaties <b>are</b> <b>constantly</b> <b>being</b> reinterpreted by the courts because {{many of the}}m are vague and difficult to apply in modern times. The numbered treaties were some of the most detailed treaties signed for their time. The Ojibwe Nation set the agenda and negotiated the first numbered treaties before they would allow safe passage of many more British settlers to the prairies.|$|E
25|$|Nicknamed “Cornfield High” when it opened, Broad Run’s facilities, academics, and extracurricular environments {{have always}} been {{challenged}} by its location {{in one of the}} fastest-growing counties in the United States. In 1969, Loudoun County opened its third public high school amidst corn fields in Ashburn to accommodate the growing student populations resulting from new housing developments in the unincorporated communities in the eastern half of the county. Since then, the county population has increased nearly sevenfold (most of it in the east), straining education budgets, infrastructure, and local politics. For Ashburn, this has resulted in constantly shifting attendance boundaries as new schools <b>are</b> <b>constantly</b> <b>being</b> opened, at all levels, elementary, middle, and high. The area’s student demographics have significantly changed as well: Loudoun County’s residents are now the country’s most affluent (per capita), and its ethnic composition continues to diversify as foreign immigration into Northern Virginia increases.|$|E

25|$|However, the {{analysis}} of capitalist competition offered in Marx's Capital, Volume III is completely {{based on the principle}} that commodities, human labor capacity, currencies and assets (physical or financial) in reality do not trade at their value. Rather, they <b>are</b> <b>constantly</b> <b>being</b> traded at margins above their value and below their value, in markets where sales are constantly fluctuating. It is, as Marx explains in the first chapter of Capital, Volume III, precisely the difference between the necessary cost-prices and the possible selling prices of commodities which is critical for profit margins, and which is therefore at the epicenter of competition in product markets. Commodities could be sold below their value, at a good profit, assuming a sufficient turnover – the classical principle of competition. Moreover, the further development of {{the analysis}} in Capital, Volume III shows that goods and assets are also being traded for profit external to the sphere of production.|$|E
25|$|Christianity {{arrived in}} Nagaland {{in the early}} 19th century. The American Baptist Naga mission {{grew out of the}} Assam mission in 1836. Miles Bronson, Nathan Brown and other Christian missionaries working out of Jaipur to bring Christianity to the Indian subcontinent, saw the {{opportunity}} for gaining converts since India's northeast was principally animist and folk religion driven. Along with other tribal regions of the northeast, the people of Nagaland accepted Christianity. However, the conversions have been marked by high rates of re-denomination ever since. After having converted to Christianity, people do not feel bound to any one sect and tend to switch affiliation between denominations. According to a 2007 report, breakaway churches <b>are</b> <b>constantly</b> <b>being</b> established alongside older sects. These new Christian churches differ from older ones in terms of their liturgical traditions and methods of worship. The younger churches exhibit a more vocally explicit form of worship. The Constitution of India grants all citizens a freedom to leave, change or adopt any religion and its new sects.|$|E
25|$|Bone {{metabolism}} also changes. Normally, bone is {{laid down}} {{in the direction of}} mechanical stress. However, in a microgravity environment there is very little mechanical stress. This results in a loss of bone tissue approximately 1.5% per month especially from the lower vertebrae, hip and femur. Due to microgravity and the decreased load on the bones, there is a rapid increase in bone loss, from 3% cortical bone loss per decade to about 1% every month the body is exposed to microgravity, for an otherwise healthy adult. The rapid change in bone density is dramatic, making bones frail and resulting in symptoms which resemble those of osteoporosis. On Earth, the bones <b>are</b> <b>constantly</b> <b>being</b> shed and regenerated through a well-balanced system which involves signaling of osteoblasts and osteoclasts. These systems are coupled, so that whenever bone is broken down, newly formed layers take its place—neither should happen without the other, in a healthy adult. In space, however, there is an increase in osteoclast activity due to microgravity. This is a problem, because osteoclasts break down the bones into minerals that are reabsorbed by the body. Osteoblasts are not consecutively active with the osteoclasts, causing the bone to be constantly diminished with no recovery. This increase in osteoclasts activity has been seen particularly in the pelvic region, because this is the region which carries the biggest load with gravity present. A study demonstrated that in healthy mice, osteoclasts appearance increased by 197%, accompanied by a down-regulation of osteoblasts and growth factors that are known to help with the formation of new bone, after only sixteen days of exposure to microgravity. Elevated blood calcium levels from the lost bone result in dangerous calcification of soft tissues and potential kidney stone formation. It is still unknown whether bone recovers completely. Unlike people with osteoporosis, astronauts eventually regain their bone density. After a 3–4 month trip into space, it takes about 2–3 years to regain lost bone density. New techniques are being developed to help astronauts recover faster. Research on diet, exercise and medication may hold the potential to aid the process of growing new bone.|$|E

500|$|In {{the summer}} of 2016, a content filter was {{set up on the}} Links to {{restrict}} navigation to certain websites, such as pornography sites and other sites with not safe for work (NSFW) content. This was described as a problem especially among the homeless, and at least one video showed a homeless man watching pornography on a LinkNYC tablet. This problem has supposedly been ongoing since at least January 2016. Despite the existence of the filter, Link users still found a way to bypass these filters. The filters, which consisted of Google SafeSearch as well as a web blocker that was based on the web blockers of many schools, were intentionally lax to begin with because LinkNYC feared that stricter filters that blocked certain keywords would alienate customers. Other challenges included the fact that [...] "stimulating" [...] user-generated content can be found on popular, relatively interactive websites like Tumblr and YouTube; it is hard to block NSFW content on these sites, because that would entail blocking the entire website when only a small portion hosts NSFW content. In addition, it was hard, if not impossible, for LinkNYC to block new websites with NSFW content, as such websites <b>are</b> <b>constantly</b> <b>being</b> created.|$|E

2500|$|The {{production}} of alternatively spliced mRNAs is regulated {{by a system}} of trans-acting proteins that bind to cis-acting sites on the primary transcript itself.

If two nearby neurons often produce an impulse in close temporal proximity, their functional properties may converge. Conversely, neurons that are not regularly activated simultaneously may be less likely to functionally converge.|$|E
