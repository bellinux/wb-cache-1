5|$|Ammonia was {{tentatively}} detected on Mars by the Mars Express satellite, {{but with}} its relatively short lifetime, {{it is not}} clear what produced it. Ammonia is not stable in the Martian <b>atmosphere</b> <b>and</b> breaks down after a few hours. One possible source is volcanic activity.|$|E
5|$|Carbon-14 (C) is a {{naturally}} occurring radioisotope, {{created in the}} upper atmosphere (lower stratosphere and upper troposphere) by interaction of nitrogen with cosmic rays. It is found in trace amounts on Earth of up to 1 part per trillion (0.0000000001%), mostly confined to the <b>atmosphere</b> <b>and</b> superficial deposits, particularly of peat and other organic materials. This isotope decays by 0.158MeV β emission. Because of its relatively short half-life of 5730years, C is virtually absent in ancient rocks. The amount of C in the <b>atmosphere</b> <b>and</b> in living organisms is almost constant, but decreases predictably in their bodies after death. This principle is used in radiocarbon dating, invented in 1949, which has been used extensively to determine the age of carbonaceous materials with ages up to about 40,000years.|$|E

5|$|A {{major problem}} in sending space probes to Jupiter is that the planet has no solid surface on which to land, {{as there is a}} smooth {{transition}} between the planet's <b>atmosphere</b> <b>and</b> its fluid interior.

5|$|A {{month before}} Christmas the Main Square in Bratislava is {{illuminated}} by a Christmas {{tree and the}} Christmas market stalls are officially opened.

40|$|The {{study of}} exoplanets {{is arguably the}} most {{exciting}} and fastest-growing field in astrophysics. Given the youth of exoplanet science, the field is strongly driven by observations.

5|$|A {{planet that}} can sustain life is termed habitable, even if life did not {{originate}} there.

5|$|Almost a year later, in August 1981, Voyager 2 {{continued}} {{the study of}} the Saturn system. More close-up images of Saturn's moons were acquired, as well as evidence of changes in the <b>atmosphere</b> <b>and</b> the rings. Unfortunately, during the flyby, the probe's turnable camera platform stuck {{for a couple of days}} and some planned imaging was lost. Saturn's gravity was used to direct the spacecraft's trajectory towards Uranus.|$|E
5|$|Although flat designs {{have the}} benefit of simplicity, other designs such as {{inverted}} pyramids and cones can be significantly more effective. This is probably because the designs shield the condensing surfaces from unwanted heat radiated by the lower <b>atmosphere,</b> <b>and,</b> being symmetrical, they are not sensitive to wind direction.|$|E

5|$|Another {{mission to}} Titan {{proposed}} in early 2012 by Jason Barnes, {{a scientist at}} the University of Idaho, is the Aerial Vehicle for In-situ and Airborne Titan Reconnaissance (AVIATR): an unmanned plane (or drone) that would fly through Titan's <b>atmosphere</b> <b>and</b> take high-definition images of the surface of Titan.
