Each design is evaluated by computing a safety factor. Computational experience with the heuristic is presented and discussed. 1 Introduction The design of a composite cylinder involves the selection of the material (fiber and resin), the determination of the number of layers, and the selection <b>of</b> the <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>wrap</b> for the layers. This work concentrates on the latter issue: for a given selection of material and number of layers, the problem becomes one <b>of</b> selecting the <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>wrap</b> that result in the "best" design. Practical considerations limit the angles that are considered to a small set, such as 30, 40, 50, 60 a [...] ...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Many production machines are used in which flexible material is processed. In these machines, cyclic tension variations can be induced in the material by interaction with the machine components. At resonance, these variations can be large and may result in breakage or distortion of the material. It is important to determine these resonant frequencies, and their dependence on the machine parameters, to help avoid these problems at the machine design stage. A mathematical model of such machines has been developed. Materials with linear elastic and linear visco-elastic tensile properties have been considered. The effects of friction between material and guide rollers have been included. A numerical method {{has been used to}} solve the resulting differential equations. This method gives accurate results even when adhesion between the material and some machine components is lost. By assuming the tension perturbations proportionately small, an approximate linear model was derived. It was found to give resonant frequencies close to those predicted by the non-linear model, but gave less accurate estimates of the amplitudes at resonance. For the linear model orthogonality relations for the eigenvectors were derived. Using these relations expressions were obtained which are first order approximations to the amplitudes of oscillation at resonance. The amplitudes are related to the <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>wrap</b> round the rollers and, in the visco-elastic case, to the loss factor of the material. In addition, the expressions determine how the amplitudes are related to the position of the corresponding span in the system. Expressions were also found using perturbation theory. They give the local variation of the resonant frequencies with respect to the span lengths and moments of inertia of components of the system. These relations are used to carry out an analysis of certain types of system. Experimental work has been carried out, using a closed loop of material, to test the predictions of the mathematical model. A variety of materials was used with several different systems of rollers. In general, the results show that the resonant frequencies detected corresponded closely with those predicted, but the amplitudes tended to be over-estimated. Finally a programme of work was carried out on a production machine, and the results compared with model predictions...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} problem of {{compression}} {{for the purpose of}} similarity identification, where similarity is measured by the mean square Euclidean distance between vectors. While the asymptotical fundamental limits of the problem - the minimal compression rate and the error exponent - were found in a previous work, in this paper we focus on the nonasymptotic domain and on practical, implementable schemes. We first present a finite blocklength achievability bound based on shape-gain quantization: The gain (amplitude) of the vector is compressed via scalar quantization and the shape (the projection on the unit sphere) is quantized using a spherical code. The results are numerically evaluated and they converge to the asymptotic values as predicted by the error exponent. We then give a nonasymptotic lower bound on the performance of any compression scheme, and compare to the upper (achievability) bound. For a practical implementation of such a scheme, we use wrapped spherical codes, studied by Hamkins and Zeger, and use the Leech lattice as an example for an underlying lattice. As a side result, we obtain a bound on the covering <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> any <b>wrapped</b> spherical code, {{as a function of the}} covering radius of the underlying lattice.

40|$|In a disk type {{friction}} {{false twisting}} process, {{the angle of}} inclination between the yarn path and the disk axis {{is a very important}} factor in relation to the tension and the twisting torque over the disk surface. According to this angle, the yarn in contact with the rotating disk receives the frictional force that twists the yarn and sends it to the forward direction. A triple-stack multi-disk spindle unit is used widely in actual draw texturing process. The main {{purpose of this paper is}} to give more precise angle of inclination in this spindle unit using the differential geometry of the yarn path over the disk surface. The angle of inclination was calculated in the actual range of the disk diameter, the radius of the disk edge, the distance between the central plane of two successive disks and the distance between the two disk centers of spindle unit. The angle of inclination obtained in this investigation gave the smaller value than angles obtained by previous studies. The <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>wrap</b> was calculated at the same time. The effect of the radius of the disk edge on the angle of inclination and wrap was explained for the first time...|$|E
40|$|Shape {{memory alloy}} (SMA) {{actuators}} {{can be integrated}} with a pulley system to provide mechanical advantage and to reduce packaging space; however, {{there appears to be}} no formal investigation of the effect of a pulley system on SMA structural or functional fatigue. In this work, cyclic testing was conducted on nickel&# 8211;titanium (NiTi) SMA actuators on a pulley system and a control experiment (without pulley). Both structural and functional fatigues were monitored until fracture, or a maximum of 1 E 5 cycles were achieved for each experimental condition. The Taguchi method and analysis of the variance (ANOVA) were used to optimise the SMA&# 8211;pulley system configurations. In general, one-way ANOVA at the 95 % confidence level showed no significant difference between the structural or functional fatigue of SMA&# 8211;pulley actuators and SMA actuators without pulley. Within the sample of SMA&# 8211;pulley actuators, the effect of activation duration had the greatest significance for both structural and functional fatigue, and the pulley configuration (<b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>wrap</b> and sheave diameter) had a greater statistical significance than load magnitude for functional fatigue. This work identified that structural and functional fatigue performance of SMA&# 8211;pulley systems is optimised by maximising sheave diameter and using an intermediate wrap-angle, with minimal load and activation duration. However, these parameters may not be compatible with commercial imperatives. A test was completed for a commercially optimal SMA&# 8211;pulley configuration. This novel observation will be applicable to many areas of SMA&# 8211;pulley system applications development...|$|E
