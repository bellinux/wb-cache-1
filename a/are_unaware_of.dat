5|$|An eclipse is {{a natural}} phenomenon. However, in some ancient and modern cultures, solar eclipses were {{attributed}} to supernatural causes or regarded as bad omens. A total solar eclipse can be frightening to people who <b>are</b> <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> its astronomical explanation, as the Sun seems to disappear {{during the day and}} the sky darkens in a matter of minutes.|$|E
5|$|Many, if {{not most}} Mauritians <b>are</b> <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> the {{existence}} of such a graveyard in Mauritius. Each grave recalls the story of deportee life in an alien country, the result of mass deportation from Haifa by the British of refugees who escaped Nazi barbarity, only to find themselves in jail in a tiny British island colony where they died of disease instead of creating new lives for themselves in Palestine/Israel.|$|E
5|$|People {{with cancer}} may not report pain due to costs of {{treatment}}, {{a belief that}} pain is inevitable, an aversion to treatment side effects, fear of developing addiction or tolerance, fear of distracting the doctor from treating the illness, or fear of masking a symptom that is important for monitoring progress of the illness. People {{may be reluctant to}} take adequate pain medicine because they <b>are</b> <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> their prognosis, or may be unwilling to accept their diagnosis. Failure to report pain or misguided reluctance to take pain medicine can be overcome by sensitive coaching.|$|E

5|$|The {{graphics}} and characters of each worlds {{were designed to}} resemble the artwork style of each Disney films. Each Disney world is inhabited by characters from the film: including Hercules and Philoctetes in Olympus Coliseum, and Aladdin, Princess Jasmine and Jafar in Agrabah. Each world is disconnected from the others and exists separately. Most characters in the worlds <b>are</b> <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> other ones, with few exceptions. Players travel from one world to another via Gummi Ship.|$|E
5|$|The redback spider's {{affinity}} for human-modified habitat has enabled it to spread to several countries via international shipping and trade. Furthermore, its tolerance to cold {{means that it}} {{has the ability to}} colonise many temperate countries with a winter climate cooler than Australia. This is concerning due to the risks to people being bitten who <b>are</b> <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> its venomous nature, and also to the conservation of local threatened insect species that the redback might prey upon.|$|E
5|$|While writing The Last of Us, Druckmann had {{a general}} {{idea of the}} events that would shape Ellie's identity; when conceiving the story {{direction}} for Left Behind, he found that these events were suitable. Druckmann felt that omitting the nature of the argument between Ellie and Riley, which took place prior to the events of the game, allowed players to draw their own conclusions. The team found various sections of the game interesting, such as the references to Facebook and Halloween, as the characters <b>are</b> <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> their meaning.|$|E

5|$|Doctor Phlox {{receives}} {{a letter from}} his Interspecies Medical Exchange counterpart, Doctor Jeremy Lucas, who is serving a term on Denobula. He begins to compose a letter back, describing his experiences with the crew, {{and the ways in}} which humans are different. Meanwhile, on the Bridge, the crew are discussing a pre-warp vessel they have encountered. The alien they speak with, a Valakian, begs them to assist with a medical emergency their species is facing. Sub-Commander T'Pol reveals that the Vulcans <b>are</b> <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> the species, but she agrees with Captain Archer to help them. Phlox continues his letter, describing the challenges of treating the disease – with over fifty million lives at stake.|$|E
5|$|Epidemiological {{studies of}} {{serotonin}} syndrome are difficult as many physicians <b>are</b> <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> the diagnosis {{or they may}} miss the syndrome due to its variable manifestations. In 1998 a survey conducted in England found that 85% of the general practitioners that had prescribed the antidepressant nefazodone were unaware of serotonin syndrome. The incidence may be increasing as {{a larger number of}} pro-serotonergic drugs (drugs which increase serotonin levels) are now being used in clinical practice. One postmarketing surveillance study identified an incidence of 0.4 cases per 1000 patient-months for patients who were taking nefazodone. Additionally, around 14 to 16 percent of persons who overdose on SSRIs are thought to develop serotonin syndrome.|$|E
5|$|In the Western world, about 15% of {{all people}} have gallstones in their {{gallbladder}} but the majority <b>are</b> <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> this and have no symptoms. Over tenyears, 15–26% will suffer one or more episodes of biliary colic (abdominal pain due {{to the passage of}} gallstones through the bile duct into the digestive tract), and 2–3% will develop complications of obstruction: acute pancreatitis, cholecystitis or acute cholangitis. Prevalence of gallstone disease increases with age and body mass index (a marker of obesity). However, the risk is also increased in those who lose weight rapidly (e.g. after weight loss surgery) due to alterations in the composition of the bile that makes it prone to form stones. Gallstones are slightly more common in women than in men, and pregnancy increases the risk further.|$|E
50|$|A 2012 meta {{analysis}} of studies assessing rates of HIV infection among transgender women in 15 countries found that trans women are 49 {{times more likely}} to have HIV than the general population.

5|$|John {{returns to}} the Resistance {{headquarters}} located aboard a nuclear submarine and is briefed by General Ashdown (Ironside) that the Resistance has discovered a hidden signal containing a code protocol which they believe can initiate a permanent shutdown of Skynet's machines. Working on this intelligence, the human militia plans to launch an offensive against the Skynet base in San Francisco. It is decided among the Resistance that the offensive will commence in four days, due to an intercepted kill-list created by Skynet, which plans to terminate the Resistance's command staff within the same time frame. John learns he is second on this list, following Kyle Reese (Yelchin). The Resistance leaders <b>are</b> <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> Kyle's importance, but John knows Kyle will eventually travel {{back in time and}} become his father, and realizes that Skynet has learned of this fact.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the food}} thrown away {{could have been avoided}} (4,100,000 tonnes, 61 per cent of the total amount of food waste) and with better {{management}} could have been eaten or used. Unavoidable foods, such as vegetable peelings and tea bags, account for 19 per cent of the total, with the remaining 20 per cent being unavoidable through preferences (e.g. bread crusts) and cooking types (e.g. potato skins). However, the vast majority of consumers (90%) <b>are</b> <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> the amount of food they throw away; individuals who believed that their household wasted no food were shown to be throwing away 88kg of avoidable food per year.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In the episode, Assistant Director Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) and Michael Kritschgau (John Finn) work desperately {{in an attempt to}} discover what is wrong with Mulder, who is imprisoned by his own frenetic brain activity, but they <b>are</b> <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> Agent Diana Fowley’s (Mimi Rogers) duplicity.

5|$|There are {{texts in}} which Isis travels {{in the wider}} world. She moves among {{ordinary}} humans who <b>are</b> <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> her identity, and she even appeals to these people for help. This is another unusual circumstance, for in Egyptian myth, gods and humans are normally separate. As {{in the first phase}} of the myth, she often has the aid of other deities, who protect her son in her absence. According to one magical spell, seven minor scorpion deities travel with and guard Isis as she seeks help for Horus. They even take revenge on a wealthy woman who has refused to help Isis by stinging the woman's son, making it necessary for Isis to heal the blameless child. This story conveys a moral message that the poor can be more virtuous than the wealthy and illustrates Isis's fair and compassionate nature.|$|E
5|$|Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm (also {{known as}} Fair Laughs the Morn and Youth and Pleasure) is an oil {{painting}} on canvas by English artist William Etty, first exhibited in 1832 and currently in Tate Britain. Etty {{had been planning}} the painting since 1818–19, and an early version was exhibited in 1822. The piece {{was inspired by a}} metaphor in Thomas Gray's poem The Bard in which the apparently bright start to the notorious misrule of Richard II of England was compared to a gilded ship whose occupants <b>are</b> <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> an approaching storm. Etty chose to illustrate Gray's lines literally, depicting a golden boat filled with and surrounded by nude and near-nude figures.|$|E
5|$|After {{the events}} of the season six finale, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) and Michael Kritschgau (John Finn) are desperately {{attempting}} to find the truth behind the so-called alien object. Meanwhile, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) is still imprisoned by his own frenetic brain activity. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and Skinner <b>are</b> <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> FBI Special Agent Diana Fowley's (Mimi Rogers) duplicity—she is working for Cigarette Smoking Man (William B. Davis). Scully then travels to Africa to unravel the secrets of the alien artifacts, finding something that looks like a spaceship buried under the shoreline off the Côte d'Ivoire coast. The object may prove that life originated elsewhere, and all religion is based on the Navajo contact with alien life. Unsuccessful, Scully returns from Africa to revisit Mulder in Washington, D.C., but instead she finds out that he has disappeared. She contacts Kritschgau and Skinner to find her partner. Cigarette Smoking Man has taken Mulder to a place where all his problems seem to have disappeared. Fowley helps Scully locate Mulder, which leads to her death at the hands of Cigarette Smoking Man.|$|E

5|$|Initially, {{the crew}} <b>are</b> <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> the loop. However, Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) begins to hear noises before {{she goes to}} bed {{following}} the poker game. Having a sense of déjà vu during the poker game and able to predict the cards Data will deal during a subsequent loop, Crusher takes a tricorder with her to her room, records the voices, and later analyzes them to discover they are the panicked commands and broadcasts of the crew. The senior staff work out that they are stuck in the loop; the voices they are hearing are those of themselves from the previous loop {{just prior to the}} destruction of the ship. They evaluate the voices to determine that the loop is restarted due to the collision of the two ships but {{do not know how to}} avoid that collision in the first place. Data suggests that his positronic brain can be used to send a short message to himself in the next loop which may help them to avoid the collision. When they arrive at the anomaly, and after the collision, Data sends the message.|$|E
5|$|The player character, a boy scout, has {{approached}} a mansion {{looking for work}} during Bob a Job week. The door is answered by an old man wearing horn-rimmed glasses—the owner of the mansion. The man, a mad scientist, expresses surprise that the boy has managed {{to get past the}} guards and booby traps in the mansion's grounds. As the boy scout explains the reason for his visit, the scientist collapses, asking for his pills. At this point the game begins. The player must gather the 16 keys needed to unlock the safe and retrieve the scientist's pills before he passes away. During play the boy scout must negotiate the mansion's rooms, avoiding hazards and the mansion's staff, who have been told to protect the inventions within the mansion, using lethal force if necessary. The staff <b>are</b> <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> the boy scout's purpose and will attack him should they come into contact.|$|E
5|$|With the Halliwells' help, Billie {{attempts}} to help Christy reintegrate back into {{everyday life and}} to gain control over her powers. Billie and the Halliwells <b>are</b> <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> Christy's collaboration with the Triad. The Triad identifies Billie as the Ultimate Power, which was foreshadowed in earlier episodes as the season's big bad, and refers to Christy {{as the key to}} unlocking Billie's power. The Triad arranges for Christy's parents to be killed by a pair of Noxon demons (John Rosenfeld and David S. Lee), believing prolonged contact with them could sway her morality to the side of good. Billie becomes angry by the Halliwell sisters when they decide to interrogate the demons to gather more information about the Ultimate Power rather than killing them to avenge her parents' deaths. Christy uses Billie's feeling of betrayal to turn her against the Charmed Ones. Billie and Christy vanquish the Noxon demons, who were previously believed to be invincible, and the Halliwell sisters realize that Billie is the Ultimate Power.|$|E
