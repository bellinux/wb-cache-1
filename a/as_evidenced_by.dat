5|$|Zimbabwe has {{relatively}} well-developed {{national infrastructure}} and a long-standing tradition of promoting {{research and development}} (R), <b>as</b> <b>evidenced</b> <b>by</b> the levy imposed on tobacco-growers since the 1930s to promote market research.|$|E
5000|$|In the Bible, God {{is portrayed}} as [...] "playful" [...] in one verse, which is used <b>as</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>by</b> {{supporters}} of a deus ludens God. In , God plays with wisdom.|$|R
50|$|The {{so-called}} Trawniki ID card {{on which}} the German prosecutors case relied heavily was the same controversial card used previously <b>as</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>by</b> Israeli prosecutors. It was controversial for several reasons.|$|R

5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Akkadian Empire, Hurrians began to settle in the city and its surroundings, and by c. 1725 BC they {{constituted}} a sizable portion of the population. The presence of a large Hurrian population brought Hurrian culture and religion to Halab, <b>as</b> <b>evidenced</b> <b>by</b> the existence of certain religious festivals that bear Hurrian names.|$|E
5|$|As the Great Depression wore on, Art Deco {{emerged as}} a popular {{building}} style, <b>as</b> <b>evidenced</b> <b>by</b> the Post Office building downtown.

5|$|In technology, medicine, and mathematics, ancient Egypt {{achieved}} {{a relatively high}} standard of productivity and sophistication. Traditional empiricism, <b>as</b> <b>evidenced</b> <b>by</b> the Edwin Smith and Ebers papyri (c. 1600BC), is first credited to Egypt. The Egyptians created their own alphabet and decimal system.|$|E
5|$|Pregnancy {{leads to}} marked changes in thyroid hormone physiology. The gland is {{increased}} in size by 10%, thyroxine production is increased by 50%, and iodine requirements are increased. Many women have normal thyroid function but have immunological evidence of thyroid autoimmunity (<b>as</b> <b>evidenced</b> <b>by</b> autoantibodies) or are iodine deficient, and develop evidence of hypothyroidism {{before or after}} giving birth.|$|E
5|$|The planar {{aromatic}} chromophore {{portion of}} the molecule intercalates between two base pairs of the DNA, while the six-membered daunosamine sugar sits in the minor groove and interacts with flanking base pairs immediately adjacent to the intercalation site, <b>as</b> <b>evidenced</b> <b>by</b> several crystal structures.|$|E
25|$|The Arabic {{script for}} the name of Allah is purported to be visible in a {{satellite}} photograph of the 2004 Asian tsunami. This was taken <b>as</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>by</b> some Muslims that Allah had sent the tsunami as punishment.|$|R

5|$|The {{prognosis}} {{of these}} patients is grim with untreated patients having an extremely short survival. The severity of liver disease (<b>as</b> <b>evidenced</b> <b>by</b> the MELD score) {{has been shown to}} be a determinant of outcome. Some patients without cirrhosis develop HRS, with an incidence of about 20% seen in one study of ill patients with alcoholic hepatitis.|$|E
5|$|After the war, {{construction}} and reconstruction work resumed on the A3 motorway. The battle damage {{was the first}} to be addressed, along with removal of the trenches excavated in the flyover embankments. Similarly, unexploded ordnance and minefields left around the motorway had to be removed by minesweepers. The motorway pavement was seriously deteriorated, <b>as</b> <b>evidenced</b> <b>by</b> extensive ruts and cracks incurred during the four-year wartime period. Unlike repairs made to the viaducts and flyovers, mine clearance and pavement reconstruction took considerably more time to perform.|$|E
5|$|Egyptian {{independence}} was limited severely by the continuing British {{occupation of the}} country. British influence remained pervasive, <b>as</b> <b>evidenced</b> <b>by</b> the Abdeen Palace Incident of 1942, which almost led to Farouk I's forced abdication. In October 1951, Prime Minister Mustafa el-Nahhas introduced, and Parliament approved, decrees unilaterally abrogating the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936 and proclaiming Farouk I King of Egypt and the Sudan. The move was intended to further Egypt's claims over Sudan, which had been governed as an Anglo-Egyptian condominium since 1899.|$|E

5|$|Horton Hatches the Egg {{has been}} used in discussions {{on a wide variety of}} topics e.g., economics, Christianity, feminism, and adoption. James Kemp, a retired United Methodist pastor, {{compared}} Horton to the early Christians to whom the First Epistle of Peter was addressed. Like those early Christians, Horton faces persecution and ridicule for his actions, but Horton is faithful to his mission and is rewarded, <b>as</b> <b>evidenced</b> <b>by</b> the elephant-bird that hatches at the end of the book.|$|E
5|$|In 1699 a Spanish {{expedition}} {{under the}} command of sergeant Martín de Montoya was sent from the Spanish garrison at Nuestra Señora de los Remedios y San Pablo, Laguna del Itza (formerly Nojpetén) to investigate Indian activity in the former Ch'ol and Mopan territories. He found evidence that there were still surviving Maya in all the lands he crossed, <b>as</b> <b>evidenced</b> <b>by</b> the carefully tended cacao and vanilla orchards. At this time there were said to be 400 relocated Maya from the same area living in Belén.|$|E
5|$|In the synoptics, the {{ministry}} of Jesus takes a single year, but in John it takes three, <b>as</b> <b>evidenced</b> <b>by</b> references to three Passovers. Events are not {{all in the same}} order: the date of the crucifixion is different, as is the time of Jesus' anointing in Bethany, and the cleansing of the temple occurs in the beginning of Jesus' ministry rather than near its end.|$|E
5000|$|The Woozle effect, {{also known}} <b>as</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>by</b> citation, [...] or a woozle, occurs when {{frequent}} citation of previous publications that lack evidence misleads individuals, {{groups and the}} public into thinking or believing there is evidence, and nonfacts become urban myths and factoids.|$|R
50|$|In January 2002, Almalki was one {{of seven}} targets of {{simultaneous}} search warrants by Project O Canada, and faxes detailing the sale of field radio components to Mohamad Elzahabi's brother, which were later entered <b>as</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>by</b> American prosecutors who had obtained it from Project O Canada.|$|R
25|$|The {{temple was}} covered with roof plates, <b>as</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>by</b> {{the fact that there}} were no remains of roof tiles and no traces of lead roof. The cornice, which has not been {{preserved}} in its original form, was probably made of a series of roughly dressed stone stabs.|$|R
