40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to analyze the influence of leadership style and motivation upon employee performance in the Office of the Secretary, West Sulawesi. The research population consists of all 322 employees of West Sulawesi's Secretary Office. The stratified random sampling technique was employed, along with Slovi's formula, thus the number of employees sampled was 76. The research employed path analysis for testing the hypothesis. The results showed as follows: 1) instruction leadership style directly affects employee performance <b>and</b> influences <b>indirectly</b> through motivation. 2) consultation leadership style directly affects employee performance <b>and</b> influences <b>indirectly</b> through motivation. 3) participation leadership style directly affects employee performance <b>and</b> influences <b>indirectly</b> through motivation <b>and</b> 4) Delegation leadership style directly affects employee performance <b>and</b> influences <b>indirectly</b> through motivation...|$|R

Popular attractions along this portion include Negro Bill Canyon, with hiking trails to Morning Glory Arch, campgrounds and boat docks at a curve in the river called Big Bend.|$|E
40|$|This {{cross-sectional}} study investigated how parents and friends influence adolescents’ food likes and consumption. 709 adolescent-parent and 638 adolescent-friend dyads completed a questionnaire, {{allowing us to}} compare target-parent and target-friend resemblances both on food likes and consumption, while distinguishing between cultural influence and dyadic unique influence. In addition, we identified two psychosocial predictors of resemblance, namely parenting style and adolescents' self-monitoring. As expected, results indicated that authoritative parenting style increased target-parent resemblance in food likes (directly) <b>and</b> consumption (<b>indirectly),</b> <b>and</b> self-monitoring orientation increased target-friend resemblance in food likes (directly) <b>and</b> consumption (<b>indirectly).</b> We also showed that target-friend resemblance was more culture-based than target-parent resemblance, suggesting that parental influence is more specific to the dyadic relation than is peer influence...|$|R

5|$|In {{the period}} between 1950 and 1974, 85 {{tropical}} or subtropical cyclones impacted the state, which collectively resulted in about $7billion (2017USD) in damage, primarily from Hurricanes Donna and Dora. Additionally, the storms were directly responsible for 93 fatalities <b>and</b> <b>indirectly</b> for 23 more deaths. Several tropical cyclones produced over 20inches (500mm) of rainfall in the state, including Hurricane Easy, which is the highest total during the period. The 1969 season was the year with the most tropical cyclones affecting the state, {{with a total of}} 8 systems. The 1954 and 1967 seasons were the only years during the period in which a storm did not affect the state.|$|E
5|$|Isabel {{produced}} {{moderate to}} heavy damage across eastern North Carolina, totaling $450million (2003USD, $ USD). Damage was heaviest in Dare County, where storm surge flooding and strong winds damaged thousands of houses. The storm surge produced a 2,000foot (600m) wide inlet on Hatteras Island, isolating Hatteras by road for two months. Strong winds downed hundreds of trees of across the state, leaving up to 700,000residents without power. Most areas with power outages had power restored {{within a few}} days. The hurricane directly killed one person <b>and</b> <b>indirectly</b> killed two in the state.|$|E

5|$|Recovery {{began with}} the mid-1948 {{currency}} reform in Western Germany, and was sped up by the liberalisation of European economic policy that the Marshall Plan (1948–1951) both directly <b>and</b> <b>indirectly</b> caused.

5|$|Sea anemones {{and their}} {{attendant}} anemone fish can make attractive aquarium exhibits {{and both are}} often harvested from the wild as adults or juveniles. These fishing activities significantly impact the populations of anemones and anemone fish by drastically reducing the densities of each in exploited areas. Besides their collection from the wild for use in reef aquaria, sea anemones are also threatened by alterations to their environment. Those living in shallow water coastal locations are affected directly by pollution and siltation, <b>and</b> <b>indirectly</b> by the effect these have on their photosynthetic symbionts and the prey on which they feed.|$|E
