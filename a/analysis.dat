5|$|Liu {{and colleagues}} {{conducted}} a separate phylogenetic <b>analysis</b> in 2017. They criticized the <b>analysis</b> of Rieppel and colleagues as having unnecessarily repeated several characters in their data, thus imbuing the repeated characters with undue {{weight in the}} <b>analysis.</b> In their own <b>analysis,</b> Liu and colleagues used the same source datasets, but deleted repeated characters, added two new characters from an <b>analysis</b> by Sean Modesto and Hans-Dieter Sues (2004), and removed poorly preserved or potentially chimeric taxa such as Cosesaurus, Kadimakara, Trachelosaurus, and Malerisaurus. Analyses based on parsimony-based and Bayesian methods found that Dinocephalosaurus {{was a member of}} the Tanystropheidae, being the sister group to a clade containing Tanystropheus, Macrocnemus, Langobardisaurus, and Tanytrachelos. The analyses also recovered a monophyletic Protorosauria, albeit to the exclusion of Prolacerta. The tree from the parsimony-based <b>analysis</b> is reproduced above, at right.|$|E

5|$|Xu Xing of the Chinese Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology (IVPP) in Beijing, {{along with}} Peter Makovicky, {{formerly}} of the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) in New York City and others, published a cladistic <b>analysis</b> in the 2002 description of Liaoceratops. This <b>analysis</b> {{is very similar to}} one published by Makovicky in 2001. Makovicky, who currently works at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, also included this <b>analysis</b> in his 2002 doctoral thesis. Xu and other colleagues added Yinlong to this <b>analysis</b> in 2006.|$|E
25|$|Closely related, but {{slightly}} different, formal techniques include cost-effectiveness <b>analysis,</b> cost–utility <b>analysis,</b> risk–benefit <b>analysis,</b> {{economic impact}} <b>analysis,</b> fiscal impact <b>analysis,</b> and social {{return on investment}} (SROI) <b>analysis.</b>|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the methods for collecting data mentioned above, qualitative research includes {{a wide range of}} ways to analyse the data. One of the most popular of these is known as grounded theory. Others include conversation <b>analysis,</b> discourse <b>analysis,</b> thematic <b>analysis,</b> and even historical <b>analysis.</b>|$|E
25|$|A needs assessment, an <b>analysis</b> of {{corporate}} and individual goals, is often undertaken {{prior to the}} development of a training program. In addition, a careful needs <b>analysis</b> is required in order to develop a systematic understanding of where training is needed, what should be taught, and who will be trained. A training needs <b>analysis</b> typically involves a three-step process that includes organizational <b>analysis,</b> task <b>analysis</b> and person <b>analysis.</b>|$|E

25|$|Netchain <b>analysis</b> is a {{theoretical}} concept integrating {{supply chain management}} and network <b>analysis</b> which was introduced by Lazzarini, Chaddad and Cook in 2001. While supply chain <b>analysis</b> focuses on vertical and network <b>analysis</b> on horizontal inderdependencies across companies, netchain <b>analysis</b> incorporates both type of interdependencies into one concept. Netchain <b>analysis</b> emphasizes value creation and coordination mechanism sources corresponding to different kind of interdependencies. In practice, netchain <b>analysis</b> is often used in a more general way referring to the perspective {{that takes into account}} chain and network characteristics as well. However, it differs in the focus and in the tools used from network science.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} definition uses {{ideas from}} mathematical <b>analysis</b> to define jets and jet spaces. It can {{be generalized to}} smooth functions between Banach spaces, analytic functions between real or complex domains, to p-adic <b>analysis,</b> and {{to other areas of}} <b>analysis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Complex {{social network}} <b>analysis</b> {{is used to}} study the {{dynamics}} of large, complex social networks. Dynamic network <b>analysis</b> brings together traditional social network <b>analysis,</b> link <b>analysis</b> and multi-agent systems within network science and network theory. Through the use of key concepts and methods in social network <b>analysis,</b> agent-based modeling, theoretical physics, and modern mathematics (particularly graph theory and fractal geometry), this method of inquiry brought insights into the dynamics and structure of social systems. New computational methods of localized social network <b>analysis</b> {{are coming out of}} the work of Duncan Watts, Albert-László Barabási, Nicholas A. Christakis, Kathleen Carley and others.|$|E
25|$|Computational {{mathematics}} proposes {{and studies}} methods for solving mathematical {{problems that are}} typically too large for human numerical capacity. Numerical <b>analysis</b> studies methods for problems in <b>analysis</b> using functional <b>analysis</b> and approximation theory; numerical <b>analysis</b> includes the study of approximation and discretization broadly with special concern for rounding errors. Numerical <b>analysis</b> and, more broadly, scientific computing also study non-analytic topics of mathematical science, especially algorithmic matrix and graph theory. Other areas of computational mathematics include computer algebra and symbolic computation.|$|E

25|$|Different {{from the}} <b>analysis</b> on {{differentially}} expressed individual genes, {{another type of}} <b>analysis</b> focuses on differential expression or perturbation of pre-defined gene sets and is called gene set <b>analysis.</b> Gene set <b>analysis</b> demonstrated several major advantages over individual gene differential expression <b>analysis.</b> Gene sets are groups of genes that are functionally related according to current knowledge. Therefore, gene set <b>analysis</b> is considered a knowledge based <b>analysis</b> approach. Commonly used gene sets include those derived from KEGG pathways, Gene Ontology terms, gene groups that share some other functional annotations, such as common transcriptional regulators etc. Representative gene set <b>analysis</b> methods include GSEA, which estimates significance of gene sets based on permutation of sample labels, and GAGE, which tests the significance of gene sets based on permutation of gene labels or a parametric distribution.|$|E

25|$|Legal {{writing is}} of two, broad categories: (i) legal <b>analysis</b> and (ii) legal drafting. Legal <b>analysis</b> is two-fold: (1) {{predictive}} <b>analysis,</b> and (2) persuasive <b>analysis.</b> In the United States, in most law schools students must learn legal writing; the courses focus on: (1) predictive <b>analysis,</b> i.e., an outcome-predicting memorandum (positive or negative) {{of a given}} action for the attorney's client; and (2) persuasive <b>analysis,</b> e.g., motions and briefs. Although not as widely taught in law schools, legal drafting courses exist; other types of legal writing concentrate upon writing appeals or on interdisciplinary aspects of persuasion.|$|E
25|$|Real <b>analysis</b> {{is an area}} of <b>analysis</b> {{that studies}} {{concepts}} such as sequences and their limits, continuity, differentiation, integration and sequences of functions. By definition, real <b>analysis</b> focuses on the real numbers, often including positive and negative infinity to form the extended real line. Real <b>analysis</b> is closely related to complex <b>analysis,</b> which studies broadly the same properties of complex numbers. In complex <b>analysis,</b> it is natural to define differentiation via holomorphic functions, which have a number of useful properties, such as repeated differentiability, expressability as power series, and satisfying the Cauchy integral formula.|$|E

25|$|Vickers' <b>analysis</b> of {{the issue}} is the most {{extensive}} yet undertaken. As well as analysing the distribution {{of a large number of}} rhetorical devices throughout the play, he also devised three new authorship tests; an <b>analysis</b> of polysyllabic words, an <b>analysis</b> of the distribution of alliteration and an <b>analysis</b> of vocatives. His findings led him to assert, with complete confidence, that Peele wrote Act 1, 2.1 and 4.1. Vickers' findings have yet to be challenged.|$|E

25|$|While {{practitioners}} of system <b>analysis</b> {{can be called}} upon to create new systems, they often modify, expand or document existing systems (processes, procedures and methods). Researchers and practitioners rely on system <b>analysis.</b> Activity system <b>analysis</b> has been already applied to various research and practice studies including business management, educational reform, educational technology, etc.|$|E
25|$|With the {{development}} of statistical techniques and numerical taxonomy in the 1960s, mathematical methods (including Cluster <b>analysis,</b> Principal components <b>analysis,</b> correspondence <b>analysis</b> and Factor <b>analysis)</b> {{have been used to}} build typologies. These techniques provide a qualitative way to articulate the degrees of consistency among particular attributes. Correlation coefficients created by these methods help archaeologists discern between meaningful and useless similarities between artefacts. During the 1990s archaeologists began to use phylogenetic methods borrowed from Cladistics.|$|E
