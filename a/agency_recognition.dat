40|$|Since the 1990 s, the Indigenous {{movement}} worldwide {{has become}} increasingly relevant to research in India, re-shaping the terms of engagement with Adivasi (Indigenous/tribal) peoples and their pasts. This book responds to the growing need for an inter-disciplinary re-assessment of Tribal studies in postcolonial India and defines a new agenda for Adivasi studies. It considers the existing conceptual and historical parameters of Tribal studies, {{as a means of}} addressing new approaches to histories of de-colonization and patterns of identity-formation that have become visible since national independence. Contributors address a number of important concerns, including the meaning of Indigenous studies in the context of globalised academic and political imaginaries, and the possibilities and pitfalls of constructions of indigeneity as both a foundational and a relational concept. A series of short editorial essays provide theoretical clarity to issues of representation, resistance, <b>agency,</b> <b>recognition</b> and marginality. The book is an essential read for students and scholars of Indian Sociology, Anthropology, History, Cultural Studies and Indigenous studies...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Attempts {{to engage}} the {{scientific}} community to annotate biological data (such as protein/gene function) stored in databases have not been overly successful. There are several hypotheses on why {{this has not been}} successful {{but it is not clear}} which of these hypotheses are correct. In this study we have surveyed 50 biologists (who have recently published a paper characterizing a gene or protein) to better understand what would make them interested in providing input/contributions to biological databases. Based on our survey two things become clear: a) database managers need to proactively contact biologists to solicit contributions; and b) potential contributors need to be provided with an easy-to-use interface and clear instructions on what to annotate. Other factors such as ‘reward ’ and ‘employer/funding <b>agency</b> <b>recognition</b> ’ previously perceived as motivators was found to be less important. Based on this study we propose community annotation projects should devote resources to direct solicitation for input and streamlining of the processes or interfaces used to collect this input.

40|$|Discussions of the {{cultural}} relativity of occupation and the potential hegemony of Western conceptualisations have included increasing awareness of a dominant focus on the individual and individual <b>agency.</b> <b>Recognition</b> {{of the importance of}} understanding occupation in diverse contexts led to an ethnographic study exploring occupation in a Greek town. A transactional perspective underpinned the emergent understanding of occupation as a multidimensional and fluid process occurring within and between individuals, the family and the community, from each moment to across the life-span. This paper presents part of the findings of that study, focusing on the family as ideology and as practice. Values and beliefs around the ideal family, occupation for the maintenance of the household, and the network of family occupation, transacted in an ongoing process that constructed and reconstructed each element. Family was embedded in memories and stories, the embodied experience of growing up in the town and in the ongoing family occupation that predominated throughout the days and weeks. Family was part of who one was, but also an inextricable part of what one did. The study supports expanding conceptualisations of occupation beyond the individual to include the family as an important part of everyday life. © 2014 © 2014 The Journal of Occupational Science Incorporated...|$|E

40|$|The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in 1999 {{issued a}} draft New Basel Capital Accord (Basel 2). Its {{principles}} {{are to be}} incorporated into the European legislation and into the Czech banking regulations. The Standardised Approach to calculating the capital requirement for credit risk is newly based on external credit assessments (ratings). Banking regulators and supervisors have to be prepared for the process of determining eligible credit assessment institutions (ECAIs) and will have to elaborate a formal recognition procedure. This paper investigates the approaches a supervisor may apply to ECAI recognition and elaborates on the criteria of recognition. First, the paper reviews the available rating agencies on the market (including their rating penetration on the Czech market), their best practices and the experience with the use of their ratings for regulatory purposes. Second, drawing on international experience and the proposed Basel 2 rules, we outline the fundamental supervisory approaches to recognition, including the legal aspects thereof, and analyse their pros and cons and the frontiers of supervisory decision making. Third, we outline the rules for recognition, including requirements or expectations (e. g. soft limits), documentation and typical interview questions with the potential candidates. We find the CNB's approach to be in compliance with CEBS Consultative Paper CP 07 (issued for public consultation in June 2005).

40|$|The {{concept of}} a {{transition}} phase from childhood to adult life is a well-recognised stage in human development. However, young people with complex disabilities experience this transition differently from other young people. Little is known about what impact these experiences have {{on the life of}} the family supporting the young person or the young person themselves. This small qualitative research study explores the recurring issues that affect families of young people with complex disabilities and the young people themselves as they transition to adult life. The study focuses on the family perspective of the transition period. The research draws on descriptive data generated from two focus group interviews. Seven parents of young people with complex disabilities participated in the focus groups. Data was analysed using constant comparative analysis. The overall perspective was social constructivism. Three themes emerged from the data analysis. These include service mismanagement, caretaking tensions and perpetual childhood management. The over-arching concept within which these themes rest is parental loss. Research findings suggest that the transition period for these parents is a highly stressful time, when services and funding are lost, yet the needs of the young people are not decreasing. Parents’ influence is diminished, as society perceives the young person as an autonomous adult, however this is not parental reality as families must continue to care for a young person with the cognitive ability of a child. This research highlights the need for young people with complex disabilities to be recognised as having differing needs from others with less severe disabilities. To address this, policy and funding discrepancies would need to be considered at a governmental level. At a local level, service <b>agency</b> <b>recognition</b> of the ongoing role of parents, and a continuation of the family-centred model of care would assist parents with the daily challenges and losses they experience as their young people transition...|$|E
40|$|Protecting children’s {{development}} is a key principle of international children’s rights law. However, while the meanings of children’s development are a central concern of disciplines such as psychology, sociology, neurology and pedagogy, so far {{there has been no}} systematic analysis of the meaning of the child’s legal right to development. This thesis remedies this significant gap in our knowledge by establishing the foundations for analysing the child’s right to development, as protected by the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. Interpreting the child’s right to development first requires unpacking the meaning of the term ‘children’s development’. In international children’s rights law, the thesis argues that the meaning of this term derives from the concept of children as ‘human becomings’. The focal point of this concept is the protection of children’s socio-psychological development and caring for their future, as adults. Consequently, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child provides a broad protection for eight segments of children’s development, on top of protecting children’s overall right to development. Based on an analysis of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child’s jurisprudence between the years 1993 and 2010, the thesis concludes that the Committee interprets the Convention in a way that subjugated most of the Convention’s rights to protect children’s socio-psychological development, while overlooking the formulation of ‘development’ as a human right. Based on literature on childhood studies, children’s rights theory, children’s development, the Capability Approach, archival research of the drafting process of the Convention, the jurisprudence of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, and interviews with members of the UN Committee, the thesis challenges this absorption of ‘children’s development’ into legal terms, and suggests a new framework for analysis. This framework accommodates a hybrid conception of childhood, a respect for children’s <b>agency,</b> <b>recognition</b> {{of the importance of the}} process of maturation (‘development’) as well as its outcome, and a cross-disciplinary understanding of ‘development’. Under the suggested framework, the child’s right to {{development is}} interpreted as a composite right that aims to ensure the child’s abilities to fulfill her or his human potential to the maximum during childhood and adulthood alike...|$|E

40|$|By the mid- 1970 s, in {{virtually}} all of Africa, strategies of modernization and technology transfer had clearly failed to initiate self-sustained processes of development. Government intervention and centralized planning had spurred economic disaster, rather than growth. In the world of finance, preferential credit had suppressed national resource mobilization and created external indebtedness without concomitant increases in productivity. In the rural economy, agricultural development banks channeled targeted credit through cooperatives and thereby undermined their potential as via ble financial intermediaries between savers and investors - borrowers.

40|$|Can we {{have rights}} without the equally {{compelling}} presence of power, flag, identity, and laws? Rights need {{the state to}} be legitimised, a government to be operational, a nation to be vindicated, and laws to be defined, arbitrated, and strengthened. The claim of rights is both experiential and phenomenological {{in the sense that}} rights present themselves to us both in the structure of everyday action and as a category in social interactions. Rights are demonstrated by their daily and recurrent recognition by the individuals and the political society as claims to the conditions of existence, development, and transformation. Rights therefore exhibit a sense of reciprocity and a characteristically recursive nature. They imply agency and a sense of contentious yet reciprocal relationship, which means that they need institutions, <b>agencies,</b> procedures, <b>recognitions,</b> and constraints – all a matter of reciprocity and recurrence. In short, in asserting one’s own right one acknowledges the validity of the institutions, actors, and agencies that act as standard setting exercises.
