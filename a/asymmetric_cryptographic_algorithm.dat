To determine which Cryptographic algorithms will be used in data security systems, besides of considering the strength, the speed is also important to be considered. This consideration of the speed will be more prefered if Cryptographic algorithms is used in the computer network environment. Therefore, besides of the speed, the strength of the cryptographic algorithm is also has to be considered. The measurement of cryptographic algorithm speed has been done by several parties, but commonly for symmetry type. Therefore in this research performed comparison of three speed popular <b>asymmetric</b> <b>cryptographic</b> <b>algorithm,</b> that are RSA, Elgamal and eliptic Curve. RSA, Elgamal and eliptic Curve these three are type of <b>asymmetric</b> <b>cryptographic</b> <b>algorithm</b> that has a public and private key pairs for encryption and decryption. In this study, all three algorithms are implemented in C + + and compiled with Borland C + + Builder. This study led to the conclusion of encryption processing speed sequence from the fastest to the slowest which are RSA, Elgamal and eliptic Curve. While the sequence of the fastest to the slowest for the decryption process is different from the order of the encryption process which are Elgamal, eliptic Curve and RSA.

Many transmission media are available in today’s world to transfer the data to destination like e-mails, social sites etc. Many approaches like cryptography are used to transfer the data securely to the destination without any modifications.

The concept of image cryptography concerns itself with ways of embedding a secret message into a cover object, without changing the properties of the cover object evidently. The embedding procedure is typically related with a key, usually called a stego-key. Without knowledge of this key it will be difficult for a third party to extract the message or even detect its presence.

Cloud computing provides numerous advantages to organizations in terms of improved scalability, lower cost, and flexibility, to name a few. Despite these technical and economical advantages, many potential cloud consumers are still hesitant to adopt cloud computing due to security and privacy concerns. In particular, one of the main factors for the reluctance of organizations to adopt cloud computing is the lack of strong encryption scheme that can ensure the confidentiality of client's data while store in cloud service provider's (CSPs) data centers. With the existing encryption schemes adopted by the CSPs, there is always a possibility that the client's data can be compromised due to insider threats. In this paper, we propose a new scheme capable to secure client information from both insider and outsider threats. In particular, we develop an encryption scheme by combining both symmetric and <b>asymmetric</b> <b>cryptographic</b> <b>algorithms,</b> which provide strong data confidentiality preserving secret key encryption functionalities, including periodically renewable public key certificates through trusted third parties. Due to these functionalities, the data owner can utilize the best secret key encryption schemes while the trusted third party will hold and communicate the secret keys to CSPs on behalf of cloud service users (CSUs) ...|$|R

40|$|This book {{presents}} two practical physical attacks. It {{shows how}} attackers can reveal the secret key of symmetric {{as well as}} <b>asymmetric</b> <b>cryptographic</b> <b>algorithms</b> based on these attacks, and presents countermeasures on the software and the hardware level that can help to prevent them in the future. Though their theory {{has been known for}} several years now, since neither attack has yet been successfully implemented in practice, they have generally not been considered a serious threat. In short, their physical attack complexity has been overestimated and the implied security threat has been underestimated. First, the book introduces the photonic side channel, which offers not only temporal resolution, but also the highest possible spatial resolution. Due to the high cost of its initial implementation, it has not been taken seriously. The work shows both simple and differential photonic side channel analyses. Then, it presents a fault attack against pairing-based cryptography. Due to the need for at least two independent precise faults in a single pairing computation, it has not been taken seriously either. Based on these two attacks, the book demonstrates that the assessment of physical attack complexity is error-prone, and as such cryptography should not rely on it. Cryptographic technologies have to be protected against all physical attacks, whether they have already been successfully implemented or not. The development of countermeasures does not require the successful execution of an attack but can already be carried out as soon as the principle of a side channel or a fault attack is sufficiently understood...|$|R
