50|$|The {{courts will}} not as readily {{conclude}} that failure {{to respond to}} a letter is an <b>admission</b> <b>by</b> <b>silence</b> {{as in the case of}} a failure to deny orally. Surrounding circumstances must permit the reasonable inference that the failure to respond can be equated with an admission, as in commercial practice, especially when there has been correspondence on an issue.|$|E
50|$|A demand letter, or {{letter of}} demand (of payment), is letter stating a legal claim (usually drafted by a lawyer) {{which makes a}} demand for {{restitution}} or performance of some obligation, owing to the recipients' alleged breach of contract, or for a legal wrong. Although demand letters are not legally required they are frequently used, especially in contract law, tort law, and commercial law cases. For example, if one anticipate a breach, it is advantageous to send a demand letter asserting {{that the other side}} appears to be in breach and requesting assurances of performances. Demand letters that are not responded to may constitute <b>admissions</b> <b>by</b> <b>silence.</b> Also, a demand letter will often generate a denial letter stating the basis for rejecting your side's claim (such as when the incorrect entity is sued), and is sometimes a good indication of what defenses will be raised if suit is brought later.|$|R

40|$|The rules {{under which}} jurisdictions (nations, provinces) can deny {{immigration}} or expel residents are generally {{governed by a}} constitution, but there do not exist either positive or normative analyses to suggest what types of exclusion rules are best. We stylise this problem by suggesting four constitutional rules of admission: free mobility, <b>admission</b> <b>by</b> majority vote, <b>admission</b> <b>by</b> unanimous consent, <b>admission</b> <b>by</b> a demand threshold for public goods. In a simple model we characterise the equilibria that result from these rules, and provide a positive theory for which constitutional rule will be chosen...|$|R
