2500|$|The way I have taken, {{is not so}} {{streight}} as Metaphrase, nor so loose as Paraphrase: Some {{things too}} I have omitted, and sometimes added of my own. [...] Yet the omissions I hope, are but of Circumstances, and such as wou'd have no grace in English; and the Addition, I also hope, are easily deduc'd from Virgil's Sense. [...] They will seem (<b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> the Vanity to think so), not struck into him, but growing out of him. (5:529) ...|$|E
2500|$|.....a pianist {{who appears}} to be {{something}} really quite extraordinary. [...] I had to overcome great resistance in order to go at all, for the description I'd heard from Dr. Hoffmann and from Maurice Zam had made me very skeptical. [...] But I must say that I have never heard such a pianist before...First, [...] he does not play at all in the style you and I strive for. [...] And just as I did not judge him on that basis, I imagine that when you hear him, you too will be compelled to ignore all matters of principle, and probably will end up doing just as I did. [...] For your principles would not be the proper standard to apply. [...] What he plays is expression in the older sense of the word, nothing else; but such power of expression I have never heard before. [...] You will disagree with his tempis as much as I did. [...] You will also note that he often seems to give primacy to sharp contrasts at the expense of form, the latter appearing to get lost. [...] I say appearing to; for then, in its own way, his music surprisingly regains its form, makes sense, establishes its own boundaries. [...] The sound he brings out of the piano is unheard of, or <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> never heard anything like it. [...] He himself seems not to know how he produces these novel and quite incredible sounds - although he appears to be a man of intelligence and not just some flaccid dreamer. [...] And such fullness of tone, achieved without ever becoming rough, I have never before encountered. [...] For me, and probably for you too, it's really too much fullness, but as a whole it displays incredible novelty and persuasiveness. [...] And above all he's only [...] old, so he's still got several stages of development before him, from which one may expect great things, given his point of departure... it is amazing what he plays and how he plays it. [...] One never senses that it is difficult, that it is technique - no, it is simply a power of the will, capable of soaring over all imaginable difficulties in the realization of an idea. - You see, I'm waxing almost poetic.|$|E

60|$|She {{said that}} {{whatever}} could have possessed her {{to let me}} take those poor unfortunate children away from her, and muddle up everything without her, was a mystery to herself.

60|$|It {{might be}} the old world indeed, but {{something}} new lay upon all things, a glowing certitude of health and happiness. It {{might be the}} old world, but the dust and fury of the old life was certainly done. <b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> no doubt of that.|$|R

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> seen {{moonlight}} and daylight together before, but <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{not seen}} daylight and black night elbow to elbow before. <b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{not seen the}} daylight resting upon an object sufficiently close at hand, before, to make the contrast startling and at war with nature.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{nothing to}} say. <b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{nothing in my}} mind that I could say. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> an {{undefined}} impression that it might have been better if we had had some other inmate, but <b>I</b> could hardly <b>have</b> explained why even to myself. Or, if to myself, certainly not to anybody else.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is better}} as it is, Hugh;--for me <b>at</b> <b>least.</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> always {{a sort of}} {{conviction}} {{that it would be}} better, though <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a longing to play the other part.

6000|$|... "Quite well, I believe. <b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{no reason}} to think otherwise. Rather thinnish if anything, but filled out wonderfully since I first saw 'em." ...|$|E

60|$|I half feared {{to descend}} into a country so diverse from any <b>I</b> <b>had</b> yet seen. Hitherto <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{encountered}} little else than friendliness. But here--doves in eyries! I stood, twisting my fingers in Rosinante's mane, debating and debating. And {{she turned her}} face to me, and looked with age into my eyes: and I know not how woke courage in me again.|$|R
60|$|Three {{summers in}} Catalina waters <b>I</b> <b>had</b> tried {{persistently}} to capture my first broadbill swordfish; and so great were the chances against me that I tried really without hope. It was fisherman's pride, I imagined, rather than hope that drove me. <b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a remarkably keen {{appreciation of the}} defeats in store for any man who aspired to experience with that marvel of the sea--Xiphius gladius, the broadbill swordsman.|$|R
60|$|I do {{not know}} if it was the thought of her child or the naked word shame that gave her deliverance; <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> no sooner spoken than a sound passed her lips, the like of it I never heard; it was as though she had lain buried under a hill and sought to move that burthen. And the next moment she had found a sort of voice.|$|R

5000|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 2006-07 season, Gooden appeared with a patch of {{hair on the back of}} his head. He refers to this hair style as a [...] "duck tail." [...] Gooden said, [...] "It is drawing a lot of attention...One thing I've found out is even negative publicity is good publicity. <b>At</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> the (guts) to do it."

6000|$|... "I was a fellow-traveller, on the steamship, with Sparrow MacCoy, and <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> the {{satisfaction}} of spoiling his little game for the voyage. The very first night I went into the smoking-room, and found him {{at the head of}} a card-table, with a half a dozen young fellows who were carrying their full purses and their empty skulls over to Europe.

6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Marilla sarcastically, [...] "if I'd {{decided it}} was worth while to dye my hair I'd have dyed it a decent color <b>at</b> <b>least.</b> <b>I</b> wouldn't <b>have</b> dyed it green." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I am as I am," [...] {{answered}} the poor woman, {{with a touch}} of natural dignity, [...] "but <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> loved him and worked for him for fifteen long years." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If it had stormed," [...] she retorted, [...] "I {{should not}} <b>have</b> cared! <b>I</b> {{hoped it would}} storm. Then <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> should <b>have</b> run the same danger,--I {{hoped it would be}} dangerous." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{threw up}} my arms, shouted a ghostly shout, {{and set off}} in vast leaps towards it. I missed one of my leaps and dropped into a deep ravine and twisted my ankle, and after that I {{stumbled}} at almost every leap. I {{was in a state}} of hysterical agitation, trembling violently, and quite breathless long before I got to it. Three times <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to stop with my hands resting on my side and in spite of the thin dryness of the air, the perspiration was wet upon my face.|$|R
60|$|Next, as I {{lay in the}} bushes, {{there came}} upon me a feeling of desolation, a {{consciousness}} that I was homeless. I {{made up my mind}} never to return to my mother and the Chatterer. I would go far away through the terrible forest, and find some tree for myself in which to roost. As for food, I knew where to find it. For the last year <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> not been beholden to my mother for food. All she had furnished me was protection and guidance.|$|R
