25|$|Riou {{positioned}} himself near the iceberg, and despatched boats {{to collect the}} ice. By the time the last boats had been recovered night had fallen, when a sudden fogbank descended, hiding the iceberg from view. Riou {{found himself in a}} dangerous situation. Somewhere to leeward lay a large mass of ice, concealed in the darkness and fog. He posted lookouts in the bows and rigging, and began to edge slowly forward. After sometime the danger seemed to be past, and the iceberg left behind, when at 9 o'clock a strange pale glow was reported by the lookout in the bows. Riou ordered the helm to turn hard a starboard, turning into the wind as a wall of ice higher than the ship's masts slid by along the side. It briefly appeared that the danger had been avoided, but as she passed by the Guardian struck an underwater projection with a sudden crash. Caught in a sudden gust of wind the ship reared up and swung <b>about,</b> <b>driving</b> the stern into the ice, smashing away the rudder, shattering her stern frame and tearing a large gash in the hull. Despite the seriousness of the situation Riou remained calm, using the sails to pull clear of the ice, and then taking stock of the damage.|$|E
500|$|... "502" [...] is <b>about</b> <b>driving</b> fast cars. [...] "In My Darkest Hour" [...] {{was written}} by Mustaine shortly {{after the death of}} Metallica bassist Cliff Burton. Mustaine had found out through word of mouth, as his former bandmates never {{contacted}} him about the tragic event that occurred in Europe. He later recalled that he was extremely unhappy that day and wrote the song in one sitting. [...] "Liar" [...] is a rant directed at past member Chris Poland. [...] "Hook in Mouth" [...] declaims censorship and the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC). Mustaine elaborated that the lyrics were aimed at those who were [...] "fucking around with our constitutional rights and trying to take away our freedom of speech".|$|E

30|$|Besides {{the systems}} that are {{specialized}} on detecting driver aggressiveness, there also exist advanced driving assistance systems (ADAS) in literature. ADAS are very popular {{in recent years and}} used in order to provide assistance to the driver <b>about</b> the current <b>driving</b> conditions such as lane departure or forward collision possibility [13]. They are used for collecting data <b>about</b> the <b>driving</b> and for warning the driver by giving feedback <b>about</b> the <b>driving</b> behaviour. However, ADAS do not interpret the driving data to reach an aggressiveness conclusion.|$|R
500|$|... "Bad" [...] was {{originally}} {{intended as a}} duet between Jackson and musician Prince. Other artists {{that were supposed to}} be featured on the album included Diana Ross, Whitney Houston, Aretha Franklin and Barbra Streisand, but none of those collaborations ended up happening. The song was viewed as a revived [...] "Hit the Road, Jack" [...] progression with lyrics that pertain to 'boasting'. [...] "Dirty Diana" [...] was viewed by AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine as [...] "misogynistic" [...] and its lyrics, describing a sexual predator, do not aim for the [...] "darkness" [...] of [...] "Billie Jean", instead sounding equally intrigued by and apprehensive of a sexual challenge, while having the opportunity to accept or resist it. [...] "Leave Me Alone" [...] was described as being a [...] "paranoid anthem". [...] "Man in the Mirror" [...] was seen as Jackson going [...] "a step further" [...] and offering [...] "a straightforward homily of personal commitment", which {{can be seen in the}} lyrics, [...] "I'm starting with the man in the mirror/I'm asking him to change his ways/And no message could have been any clearer/If you wanna make the world a better place/Take a look at yourself and then make a change." [...] The lyrics to [...] "Speed Demon" [...] are <b>about</b> <b>driving</b> fast.|$|E

500|$|Waltrip, {{who failed}} {{to qualify for the}} Daytona 500 after {{crashing}} on lap 52, said he felt he had let everyone down but was thankful his team and his sponsor Aaron's had given him an opportunity to race in the Duels. Patrick, who was hit by Almirola on the final lap and crashed heavily into the wall, said, [...] "It sucks [...] You just have to brace yourself. I guess in these situations, I just have to be glad that I'm a small driver and that I've got room. Kinda hug it in and let it rip." [...] She also said the crash was [...] "a blessing in a big disguise". Patrick, along with Gilliland, Montoya and Menard, were required to drive their backup cars for the Daytona 500. After the wreck on lap nine, Gilliland cut his thumb on his helmet; the thumb required one stitch but he was confident <b>about</b> <b>driving</b> his backup car. According to Menard, who was involved in the lap nine wreck, [...] "Somebody turned (David) Gilliland; I saw him get sideways underneath me. I was three lanes up and I tried to clear him and didn’t quite make it.” It took 56 minutes and 34 seconds to complete the first race; because it ended under caution, no margin of victory was recorded.|$|E

500|$|By midnight, the Baley {{company had}} fallen behind the Rose company {{and decided to}} stop and make a {{mountain}} camp while Rose and others continued to the Colorado River, where they planned to water their combined stock and build a raft {{in preparation for the}} impending river crossing. By noon on August 28, Rose had reached a patch of Cottonwood trees about one mile from the river, where their oxen were unhitched and allowed to join the loose stock racing towards the water. There the emigrants encountered more Mohave, but unlike the friendly ones that greeted them at Sitgreaves Pass, these were rude and hostile. After a thorough watering, the work oxen were returned to the wagons. Rose and his wife, Amanda, decided to scout the river bank for a suitable campsite, exiting their wagon to make the journey by foot. Moments later, an aggressive Mohave placed his hand on her shoulder and bosom, and she ran back, terrified, to the relative safety of their wagon. Rose, not wanting to incite the Mohave, ignored the incident and continued to the river. Other Mohave harassed Alpha Brown's family, briefly threatening to take his wife's dress and abduct their son. That danger was averted, but many Mohave set <b>about</b> <b>driving</b> off and slaughtering several of the party's cattle before leaving the emigrants alone at their encampment, some two hundred yards from the river and [...] away from the Baley company's mountain camp.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{noted the}} game's length as shorter than expected, with about ten hours of content. Clayman (IGN) had little desire to replay the solved puzzles and Bramwell (Eurogamer) was even {{eager for the}} game to end. Halverson (Play) planned {{to return to the}} game but wrote that he would have {{preferred}} five more hours of the single-player over the Xbox Live features. Reviewers were largely unimpressed with the extra Xbox Live cooperative play and score attack features. Halverson (Play) had hopes for Kameo and Psychonauts to rekindle developer interest in the 3D platforming genre, but concluded that such games were likely not to return. Clayman (IGN) did not find the game {{to live up to its}} publicity as a competitor against The Legend of Zelda series, though Theobald (GameSpy) thought Kameo boss battles were comparable. Pfister (1UP.com) noted several traditional Rare flourishes—lots of color and graphics effects, puns for character names—but ultimately wrote that Kameo was proof that Microsoft had received [...] "exactly what they paid for" [...] in its acquisition of Rare. Theobald (GameSpy) said that Rare had avoided its usual tropes of making players collect lots of items and poor character design, and made a [...] "worthy" [...] launch title. Nigel Kendall (The Times) wrote that the game was [...] "more cerebral" [...] than the console's other games, which were stereotypically <b>about</b> <b>driving,</b> football, or shooting. Kasavin (GameSpot) noted that Kameo was the most accessible launch title to players of all ages. In summary, he thought the game was a suitable fit for players' first experiences on the new Xbox 360.|$|E

2500|$|In 1967, Penske {{contacted}} Donohue <b>about</b> <b>driving</b> Penske's {{brand new}} Lola T70 spyder in the United States Road Racing Championship.

2500|$|While {{being tested}} for {{competing}} British television programme Top Gear, first broadcast on 11 November 2007, a floor panel came {{loose from the}} test vehicle as it was being driven at speed by Jeremy Clarkson, after he had already made a play of being scared <b>about</b> <b>driving</b> the car because of Plato's experience. Afterwards, {{there was a problem}} with the car's petrol injection system.

2500|$|The CJLS {{accepted}} a responsum {{which holds that}} if a person rides to synagogue on Shabbat, {{with the intention of}} fulfilling Shabbat mitzvot, and that if no other driving on Shabbat is done, then that person will not be held as being in violation of halakha. The decision <b>about</b> <b>driving</b> was in the nature of an emergency decree, overriding what the authors saw as rabbinic law. The reason was that a tremendous number of American Jews were now living far from synagogues as an unavoidable consequence of modern life, and unless Jews were permitted to drive to synagogue, then most American Jews would lose their connection to Jewish life ("Responsum on the Sabbath" [...] by rabbis Morris Adler, Jacob B. Agus and Theodore Friedman.) ...|$|E

Senna expressed his discomfort with the handling of his car, stating, [...] "I have a very negative feeling <b>about</b> <b>driving</b> the car and driving it on the limit and so on... Some of that is down to the lack of electronic change. Also, the car has its own characteristics which I'm not fully confident in yet."

2500|$|Just after 5:00a.m. on February 11, 2011, Gelman stabbed {{and killed}} his stepfather, Aleksandr Kuznetsov, in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn after an {{argument}} with his mother <b>about</b> <b>driving</b> Kuznetsov's vehicle. According to Gelman, he believed DEA agents were after him and planned to flee to the Dominican Republic. He claimed he woke his mother {{to find out where}} his passport was, and this developed into an argument as his mother believed he was drunk. Their argument awoke Kuznetsov, who came into the kitchen swearing at Gelman in Russian. Gelman grabbed a knife and stabbed Kuznetsov repeatedly. When the knife broke, Gelman continued the attack with a carving fork, ultimately stabbing Kuznetsov 55 times. [...] His mother was not physically hurt. Gelman then took the vehicle and sped off in it, running over a crossing guard and breaking her leg.|$|E
2500|$|Andrew first {{appears in}} the [...] "Pilot" [...] of season one. His first {{speaking}} role is arguing with his mother, Bree, over her desire for perfection.

Andrew repeatedly breaks the rules during Season 1, infuriating Bree, who eventually humiliates him by turning up at the strip club he is visiting with his friends while grounded. Bree does later apologize to Andrew (who also admits how much he misses his father) for lying to him, but removes the door to his room in punishment for him smoking marijuana.|$|E
