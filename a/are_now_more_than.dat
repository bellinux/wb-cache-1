5|$|The first {{ascent of}} Mont Blanc in 1786 by Jacques Balmat and Michel Paccard {{initiated}} {{the sport of}} alpine mountaineering, and {{it was during the}} golden age of alpinism (185465) and the silver age of alpinism (186582) {{that the majority of the}} main summits of the massif were first attained. Members of the England-based Alpine Club were instrumental in many of the first ascents, usually accompanied by guides from the towns of Chamonix or Courmayeur, such as Michel Croz, Michel Payot and Émile Rey, as well as the Swiss guide, Christian Almer. Across the massif there <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> two thousand different mountaineering routes to the summits, ranging greatly in both length and difficulty. These attract climbers from all over the world who, unlike the early ascensionists, now have access to numerous climbing guidebooks, modern safety equipment, good information on climbing routes and technical difficulty, as well as weather forecasts and mountain accommodation and food.|$|E
25|$|According to OMF International estimates, as of 2008, there <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 700,000 Christian Lisu in Yunnan, and 450,000 in Burma. Only the Lisu of Thailand have {{remained}} unchanged by Christian influences. Now, Christianity {{is becoming the}} dominant religion among the Lisu people gradually.|$|E
25|$|Although the rear-entrance {{double-deck}} AEC Routemaster is {{the archetypal}} London bus, their numbers have dwindled quite quickly owing to their age (the oldest <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 60 years old), {{their inability to}} accept wheelchairs or pushchairs, and their requirement for a two-person crew. As described below, Routemasters are now restricted to one heritage route.|$|E

25|$|Bangladesh {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{countries}} in Asia to offer MBA degree. There <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 50 business schools in Bangladesh offering the MBA, predominantly targeting graduates without any work experience. Most MBAs are two years full-time. There is little use of GMAT. The Business Schools conduct their own admission tests instead. Classes are taught in English.|$|E
25|$|Out of {{the three}} that opposed, one was Channel 4, which has been putting in place a {{portfolio}} of free-to-air channels, among them Film4 which was made free-to-air across all platforms on 23 July 2006. Channel 4 argued {{that the number of}} free channels available has been the major driving force behind the massive success of the platform – there <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 10 million Freeview boxes in use.|$|E
25|$|In China, {{a distant}} hope for HIV {{prevention}} {{is the development}} of an effective vaccine that can offer long-term protection against the wide spectrum of HIV variants that exist. Despite the fact that there <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 30 vaccine candidates in clinical trials (in the world), and three of these are in advance stage testing (phase IIb and phase III), many obstacles still lie {{in the way of the}} development of a truly effective HIV preventive vaccine.|$|E

25|$|With {{the passing}} of time some of these prisoners have been {{released}} or, like Igor Sutyagin, exchanged with other countries for Russian agents held abroad. Nevertheless, the numbers continue to mount. According to some organisations there <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 300 individuals who have either been sentenced to terms of imprisonment in Russia, or are currently detained awaiting trial (in custody or under home arrest), or have fled abroad or gone into hiding, because of persecution for their beliefs and their attempts to exercise their rights under the Russian Constitution and international agreements.|$|E
25|$|There <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 160 {{producer}} organisations (PO) in the EU. These are voluntary organisations {{set up by}} fishermen or fish farmers to assist in selling their product. Their members must include a minimum percentage of vessels in that sector, not discriminate in terms of nationality or location of their members within the EU, and must comply with other EU regulations. Organisations are required to develop plans to adjust fish catches to market demand. They may require non-members fishing in the same areas to follow the same restrictions as members.|$|E
25|$|Later the {{emphasis}} was on classical studies, dominated by Latin and Ancient History, and, for boys with sufficient ability, Classical Greek. From {{the latter part of}} the 19th century this curriculum has changed and broadened: for example, there <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 100 students of Chinese, which is a non-curriculum course. In the 1970s, there was just one school computer, in a small room attached to the science buildings. It used paper tape to store programs. Today, all boys must have laptop computers, and the school fibre-optic network connects all classrooms and all boys' bedrooms to the internet.|$|E

25|$|Discovering Britain is {{a website}} {{featuring}} {{a series of}} self-led geographical walks that help explain the stories behind the UK's built and natural landscapes. Each walk explores a particular landscape, finding out about {{the way in which}} the forces of nature, people, events and the economy have created and shaped the area. There <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 120 walks on the Discovering Britain website, covering all regions of the United Kingdom. Walks are themed according to the landscape in which they are located, including built, prehistoric, historic, working, hidden and changing landscapes. Walks also look at people in the landscape, and shaping, preserving and exploiting the landscape.|$|E
25|$|Diazepam {{was first}} {{synthesized}} by Leo Sternbach, and was first manufactured by Hoffmann-La Roche. It {{has been one}} of the most frequently prescribed medications in the world since its launch in 1963. In the United States it was the highest selling medication between 1968 and 1982, selling more than two billion tablets in 1978 alone. In 1985 the patent ended, and there <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 500 brands available on the market. Diazepam is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most effective and safe medicines needed in a health system. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about 0.01 USD per dose as of 2014. In the United States it is about 0.40 USD per dose.|$|E
25|$|The 747-400's leasing, resale and {{salvage value}} has dropped steeply {{because it is}} {{relatively}} expensive to operate. As many 747-400s <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 20 years old, airlines are beginning to replace them. Airlines using the 747-400 have accelerated its retirement (as of 2015) and are replacing the model with more fuel efficient aircraft. The main appeal of the 747-400 like its predecessors was its range rather than its capacity, {{and in many cases}} it has been replaced by wide-body twin-engine aircraft of similar range such as the Boeing 777 and Boeing 787. The change in emphasis from hub and spoke operations to point-to-point flights has also reduced the need for jumbo jets. Airlines such as British Airways and Qantas who plan to maintain the same capacity on routes currently served by 747-400s have ordered the Airbus A380 rather than the updated 747-8.|$|E

25|$|The {{tour and}} {{recording}} helped spark {{the formation of}} many LGBT choruses in the United States and around the world, including the Gay Men's Chorus of Washington DC, Boston Gay Men's Chorus, Vancouver Men's Chorus in Canada, and the Melbourne Gay and Lesbian Chorus in Australia. By 1982, choruses were performing in many cities across the US, Canada, Europe (for instance, Stockholms Gaykör, Sweden). and a global LGBT choral movement had begun to take shape. SFGMC founding member Jay Davidson helped create the Gay and Lesbian Association of Choruses (GALA Choruses) and served as its first board president. LGBT singers {{in other parts of}} the world created similar organizations, including LEGATO, an association for lesbian and gay choirs and ensembles in Europe established in 1997, and SING OUT! – the Association of Lesbian and Gay Choirs in the UK and Ireland. There <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 250 LGBT choruses worldwide.|$|E

500|$|The Disney-owned {{publisher}} Hyperion paid $6.7million for {{the rights}} to publish a book about Pausch called The Last Lecture, co-authored by Pausch and Wall Street Journal reporter Jeffrey Zaslow. The book became a New York Times best-seller on April 28, 2008. The Last Lecture expands on Pausch's speech. The book's first printing had 400,000 copies, and it has been translated into 46 languages. It has spent more than 85 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list, and there <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 4.5 million copies in print in the U.S. alone. Despite speculation that the book would be made into a movie, Pausch had denied these rumors, stating that [...] "there's a reason to do the book, but if it's telling the story of the lecture in the medium of film, we already have that." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Phillips Mansion is a Second Empire style {{historic}} {{house in}} Pomona, Los Angeles County, California. [...] It {{was built in}} 1875 by Louis Phillips, who by the 1890s had become the wealthiest man in Los Angeles County. [...] Situated along the Butterfield Stage route, the Phillips Mansion became a center of community activity in the Pomona and Spadra area.

2500|$|Until {{the twentieth}} century, {{only a few}} hundred {{meteorite}} finds had ever been discovered. More than 80% of these were iron and stony-iron meteorites, which are easily distinguished from local rocks. To this day, few stony meteorites are reported each year that can be considered to be [...] "accidental" [...] finds. The reason there <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 30,000 meteorite finds in the world's collections started with the discovery by Harvey H. Nininger that meteorites are much more common {{on the surface of the}} Earth than was previously thought.|$|E
50|$|As {{a result}} of the use of antihypertensives, the {{incidence}} of hypertensive emergencies has declined from 7% to 1% of patients with hypertension.
