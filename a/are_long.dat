5|$|The adult's plumage is white, {{with black}} flight {{feathers}} in the wings. Wild birds usually appear soiled with a rusty or brown shade {{to the white}} plumage, derived from mud or iron-rich soil. Captive specimens without access to soil have clean white plumage. It has been suggested as a case of cosmetic colouration. The bill is slender and long, and {{the tip of the}} upper mandible is hooked. The nostril is an elongated horizontal slit. The neck feathers <b>are</b> <b>long</b> and form a hackle. The wings are pointed, with the third primary being the longest; the tail is wedge shaped. The legs are pink in adults and grey in juveniles. The claws <b>are</b> <b>long</b> and straight, and the third and fourth toes are slightly webbed at the base.|$|E
5|$|A broad muzzle {{is found}} on the river otter's flat head, and the ears are round and inconspicuous. The rhinarium is bare, with an obtuse, {{triangular}} projection. Eyes of the animal are small and placed anteriorly. A short, broad rostrum for exhaling and a long, broad cranium define the relatively flat skull. The river otter's nostrils and ears close during submersion, inhibiting water from entering them. Its vibrissae (whiskers) <b>are</b> <b>long</b> and thick, enhancing sensory perception underwater and on land.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of erosion of {{sandstone}} and the erosion-resistant sills and dikes, the topography in Minnesota has repeated parallel hills and valleys. The tightly packed lakes in the narrow valleys <b>are</b> <b>long</b> and narrow, and they orient from the east to west. The cliffs in these narrow valleys are the habitat to several rare plants which prefer living in narrow cliff areas in a sub-Arctic climate. In Ontario the Rove Formation is overlain by a thick diabase cap.|$|E
5|$|Cairanoolithus dughii is {{the type}} oospecies. At , its eggshell is {{slightly}} thicker than that of C. roussetensis. It has slender, partially fused columnar eggshell units. Their outer surface is almost without ornamentation, and the inner surface is covered with hollows once filled by organic cores. C. dughiis eggshell exhibits an angusticanaliculate pore system, i.e. its pores <b>are</b> <b>long,</b> narrow, and straight.|$|E

5|$|Similarly, {{even when}} blind, house sparrows {{continue}} to be photoperiodic, i.e. show reproductive development when the days <b>are</b> <b>long,</b> but not when the days are short. This response is stronger when the feathers {{on top of the}} head are plucked, and is eliminated when India ink is injected under the skin {{at the top of the}} head, showing that the photoreceptors involved in the photoperiodic response to day length are located inside the brain.|$|E
5|$|Snake scales {{occur in}} variety of shapes. They may be cycloid as in family Typhlopidae, long and pointed with pointed tips, {{as in the}} case of the Green Vine Snake Ahaetulla nasuta, broad and leaf-like, {{as in the case}} of green pit vipers Trimeresurus spp or as broad as they <b>are</b> <b>long,</b> for example, as in Rat snake Ptyas mucosus.|$|E
5|$|Spores are spherical, hyaline (translucent), {{and measure}} 2.5–3.4μm in diameter. They are {{thick-walled}} {{with a short}} pedicel (a tubelike extension), and are ornamented with tiny spines (verrucae) that are roughly equidistant from each other. Capillitial threads <b>are</b> <b>long,</b> hyaline, and branched, measuring 2.4–4μm thick. They are septate and occasionally have pits on their walls. The exoperidium comprises thick-walled, inflated hyphae mixed with sphaerocysts (spherical cells), while the endoperidium is made of tightly interwoven, thick-walled hyphae. In the rhizomorphs, the hyphae in the central core are several times as thick {{as those in the}} surrounding subcortex.|$|E

Although in most Pezizales {{all of the}} ascospores {{are formed}} {{simultaneously}} through delimitation by an inner and outer membrane, in S.coccinea the ascospores located in the basal parts of the ascus develop faster. The paraphyses (sterile filamentous hyphae present in the hymenium) are about 3µm wide (and only slightly thickened at the apex), and contain red pigment granules.|$|E
5|$|The body of {{the creek}} whaler is {{spindle-shaped}} and rather stocky. The long snout has a narrowly parabolic shape and large nostrils preceded by small, nipple-shaped flaps of skin. The eyes are circular and of medium size, and are equipped with nictitating membranes. The arched mouth has very short furrows at the corners. There are 30 upper and 28–30 lower tooth rows. The upper teeth <b>are</b> <b>long</b> and triangular with strongly serrated edges, and become increasing angled towards {{the sides of the}} jaw. The lower teeth are slender and upright with finely serrated edges. The five pairs of gill slits are short.|$|E
5|$|The first island {{platform}} comprises platforms 5 to 8. Platform 5 {{is inside the}} main train shed while 6 is a southerly extension and 7 and 8 were added outside the supporting wall in the 1930s. Platform 5 is used by trains towards Cardiff and platform 7 to Portsmouth; platforms 6 and 8 are the main platforms for Weston-super-Mare and stations to Penzance. Between platforms 5 and 7 are the two spur sidings that <b>are</b> <b>long</b> enough to stable a single Class 153 DMU.|$|E
