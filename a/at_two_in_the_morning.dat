5|$|The action quickly {{revealed}} {{a breakdown in}} discipline amongst Benbow's captains. He had intended that the 64-gun HMS Defiance under Captain Richard Kirkby would lead the line of battle, but Kirkby was not maintaining his station. Benbow {{decided to take the}} lead himself, and the Breda pulled ahead, followed by the 50-gun HMS Ruby under Captain George Walton. The two maintained contact with the French throughout the night, but the other five ships refused to close. The chase ensued until 24 August, with only Benbow, Walton, and Samuel Vincent aboard HMS Falmouth making active efforts to bring the French to battle. At times, they bore the brunt of the fire of the entire squadron. The Ruby was disabled on 23 August, and Benbow ordered her to retire to Port Royal. The French resumed the action <b>at</b> <b>two</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> on 24 August, the entire squadron closing on the Breda from astern and pounding her. Benbow himself was hit by a chain-shot that broke his leg and he was carried below.|$|E

Ponyboy runs away after Darry slaps him, and meets up with Johnny to run away. Ponyboy calms down and wonders if running away would be a good idea.|$|E
500|$|One of the {{earliest}} accounts of an ascent of Helvellyn {{for the pleasure of}} doing so is contained in James Clarke's guidebook of 1787. He quotes the account of an unnamed gentleman from Penrith who wanted to eat his dinner on Midsummer Day while sitting in a snowdrift on top of Helvellyn. The man left home <b>at</b> <b>two</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> rode to Glencoyne and left his horse at a house in the valley there. He started to walk up the mountain at between four and five in the morning and after five hours hot and hard work he reached the snow and the summit. The snow was covered with dust so he had to dig for clean snow to eat with his dinner. He returned by a different route, reaching Glencoyne ten hours after leaving it. This story seems to reflect the colder climatic conditions of the eighteenth century, during the so-called [...] "Little Ice Age".|$|E

500|$|On his hiring, Baker explained, [...] "I did the Dino De Laurentiis {{version of}} King Kong in 1976 {{and was always}} {{disappointed}} because I wasn't {{able to do it}} as realistically as I wanted. I thought Apes would {{be a good way to}} make up for that." [...] In addition to King Kong, Baker previously worked with designing ape makeup on , , and the 1998 remake of Mighty Joe Young. The makeup took 4.5 hours to apply and 1.5 hours to remove. Burton explained, [...] "it's like going to the dentist <b>at</b> <b>two</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> and having people poke at you for hours. Then you wear an ape costume until nine at night." [...] Burton was adamant that the apes should be substantially [...] "more animal-like; flying through trees, climb walls, swing out of windows, and go ape shit when angry." [...] For a month and a half before shooting started, the actors who portrayed apes attended [...] "ape school". Industrial Light & Magic, Rhythm and Hues Studios and Animal Logic were commissioned for the visual effects sequences. Rick Heinrichs served as the production designer and Colleen Atwood did costume design.|$|E
500|$|Hoppus {{attributed}} the album's delay {{to the band}} learning to work by themselves without Finn, and both DeLonge and Hoppus expressed frustration during the sessions at the band's cabal of publicists, managers and attorneys (which DeLonge described as [...] "the absolute diarrhea of bureaucracy"). A result of the band's split was each members hiring his own attorney, and, during the sessions of Neighborhoods, the band had four managers. Later, {{it was revealed that}} DeLonge and Hoppus would go months without direct communication, only speaking through their managers. Hoppus moved to London with his family late in the recording process, also complicating matters. Under pressure, the band released a statement in April that effectively rescheduled all European tour dates due to the album's prolonged recording. The decision — a [...] "hugely expensive" [...] one — was protested by DeLonge but pushed forward by Barker, who felt the trio had made commitments to only tour with new material. [...] The biggest argument of the recording process ensued, which resulted in Geffen Records setting a July 31 deadline for the record amid concerns about the volatility of the band, explaining there would be penalties if the album was not turned in on time. DeLonge joked that, [...] "We'll probably actually drive it to the (Geffen) president's house <b>at</b> <b>two</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> and hand it through his bedroom window at the last possible minute." [...] The band, as a whole, only entered the studio for [...] "one or two weeks" [...] following the release of the statement in the spring, with only three days dedicated to writing. Recording lasted through May and into the summer, and {{by the time of the}} July 31 deadline, the record was near completion and finally completed over August.|$|E
2500|$|There were {{no signs}} of the {{garrison}} yielding. They treated Cromwell's summons lightly and miscalculated {{the power of his}} heavy guns. By the evening of 13 October two wide breaches had been effected, and <b>at</b> <b>two</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> it was resolved to storm the place at six, when the sky would be growing clear before the rising of the sun. The weary soldiers were directed to snatch a brief rest, but Cromwell spent part at least of the remainder of the night in meditation and prayer. He was verily persuaded that he was God's champion in the war against the strongholds of darkness, and as he figured to himself the idolaters and the idols behind the broken wall in front of him, the words, [...] "They that make them are like unto them, so is every one that trusteth in them", rose instinctively to his lips.|$|E

2500|$|Perri {{recorded}} the album in 33 days in two studios {{located on the}} same property, both running at the same time. She described the process as [...] "the best 33 {{days of my life}} and it was the worst 33 days of my life." [...] Describing the hectic conditions she was under while recording, she stated, [...] "I was running from studio one to studio three and I was running back and forth doing the vocals, the piano, the guitar, the harmonies, and the doubles.” Perri stated that sometimes they would record two songs in one day, forcing Perri to mentally prepare to sing about one relationship in 2007, then sing another other song with different emotions about a relationship in 2008. Perri stated that she was [...] "ripping [...] stitches" [...] to ensure that a certain song was sung with the right emotions, later adding that it took such an emotional toll on her that she would be driving home later that night crying <b>at</b> <b>two</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> forcing herself to pull over and drink a milkshake.|$|E
2500|$|The January term brought miserable {{weather and}} a {{struggle}} {{to keep up with}} his studies. Around this time, he had an earnest conversation with John Herbert about going into Holy Orders, and asked him whether he could answer yes to the question that the Bishop would put in the ordination service, [...] "Do you trust that you are inwardly moved by the Holy Spirit". When Herbert said that he could not, Darwin replied [...] "Neither can I, and therefore I cannot take orders" [...] to become an ordained priest. Even his interest in insect collecting waned. He fell out with one of the two locals he employed to catch beetles when he found that the local was giving first choice to a rival collector. In the doldrums, he joined a crowd of drinking pals in a frequent [...] "debauch". He put in some hard riding. On one night he and three friends saw the sky lit up and [...] "rode like incarnate devils" [...] eleven miles to see the blaze. They arrived back <b>at</b> <b>two</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> and violated curfew. He was risking [...] "rustication", temporary expulsion. Such behaviour would be noticed by the Proctors, university officials appointed from the colleges who patrolled the town in plain gowns to police the students.|$|E
2500|$|The {{project of}} co-writing was {{expedited}} by the {{collaboration between the}} four co-writers on the internet working from different geographical locations. With Iñárritu in Los Angeles, Giacobone and Bo in Buenos Aires, and Dinelaris in New York, the script was mainly written through Skype calls and emails. Although this complicated the writing process, Dinelaris said he believed the best ideas in Birdman came from Skype sessions <b>at</b> <b>two</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> where he and Giacobone were [...] "cracking each other up". Incorporating the one-shot feature also affected the writing. Bo said [...] "We wrote everything thinking of this one shot, {{and a lot of}} decisions that would mostly be taken in the editing room were taken before shooting". The one-shot approach meant the scenes could not be removed or re-ordered in post-production, so the writers needed to be [...] "very, very sure about what was on the page." [...] As a result, it took {{about a year and a}} half to complete the final draft. As Dinelaris summarized: [...] "You have to be an idiot to do it all in one shot. You have to be an idiot to attempt it. It takes a great, great deal of ignorance to not pay attention to the difficulties and to think you're going to do this. Birdman looks like a good idea now, but [...] we did not know how we would land." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Marshall Mathers LP was {{recorded}} in a two-month-long [...] "creative binge", which often involved 20-hour-long studio sessions. Eminem hoped to keep publicity down during the recording {{in order to stay}} focused on working and figuring out how to [...] "map out" [...] each song. He described himself as a [...] "studio rat" [...] who benefited creatively from the isolated environment of the studio. Much of the album was written spontaneously in the studio; Dr. Dre noted, [...] "We don't wake up <b>at</b> <b>two</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> call each other, and say, 'I have an idea. We gotta get to the studio. ' We just wait and see what happens when we get there. [...] " [...] Eminem observed that much of his favorite material on the album evolved from [...] "fucking around" [...] in the studio; [...] "Marshall Mathers" [...] developed from the rapper watching Jeff Bass casually strumming a guitar, while [...] "Criminal" [...] was based on a piano riff Eminem overheard Bass playing in studio next door. [...] "Kill You" [...] was written when Eminem heard the track playing in the background while talking to Dr. Dre on the phone and developed an interest in using it for a song. He then wrote the lyrics at home and met up with Dr. Dre and the two recorded the song together.|$|E
