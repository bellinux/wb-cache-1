5|$|If {{there is}} doubt <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> {{of the skin}} lesions, a biopsy of the skin may be {{performed}} to distinguish the purpura from other diseases that cause it, such as vasculitis due to cryoglobulinemia; on microscopy the appearances are of a hypersensitivity vasculitis, and immunofluorescence demonstrates IgA and C3 (a protein of the complement system) in the blood vessel wall. However, overall serum complement levels are normal.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, a {{new theory}} {{surfaced}} after the newspaper Crónica spoke to the police <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> of the accident. The police source mentioned the possibility that Rodrigo's intensive routine might have increased the production of adrenaline in his body. The investigators explained that, if Rodrigo did not release the excess adrenaline through urination after his last concert, he could have lost his sense of distance in relation to Pesquera's Blazer. This could have caused Rodrigo {{to apply the brake}} and turn the wheel violently.|$|E

5|$|Little {{was known}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> {{of the disease}} until 1903 when Adelchi Negri (1876–1912) first saw {{microscopic}} lesions– now called Negri bodies– in the brains of rabid animals. He wrongly thought they were protozoan parasites. Paul Remlinger (1871–1964) soon showed by filtration experiments that they were much smaller than protozoa, and even smaller than bacteria. Thirty years later, Negri bodies were shown to be accumulations of particles 100–150nanometres long, now known to be the size of rhabdovirus particles– {{the virus that causes}} rabies.|$|E
5|$|When Buffy is on patrol, she laments in {{song about}} how uninspired her life has become ("Going Through the Motions"). The {{next morning at}} the Magic Box, the gang reveal that they also sang that evening.

Buffy learns that the whole town is affected when she looks outside the shop to see a large group (led by series writer and producer David Fury) singing and dancing about how a dry-cleaning service got their stains out ("The Mustard").|$|E
5|$|On 20 September, the {{surviving}} relatives of each decedent received 2 million Russian rubles (about US$40,000) {{for each person}} {{who died in the}} accident. Ukrainian relatives stated to Norwegian media that they had not received information <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> and other issues surrounding the accident. At the time, Ukraine was experiencing very high unemployment, and Arktikugol offered wages many times what was then offered in mainland Ukraine. Many miners not only had to support their immediate family, but also relatives. Vnukovo Airlines stated on Ukrainian television that the relatives would receive US$20,000 per deceased person. About a year after the accident, all relatives had been offered US$20,000, but about two-thirds of them chose not to accept the amount, and instead started a process to sue the insurance company. Their lawyer, Gunnar Nerdrum, stated that according to both Norwegian and Russian law, they could demand at least US$140,000.|$|E

5|$|The Michigan Sea Grant Program {{organized}} a three-day dive {{to survey the}} Fitzgerald in 1989. The primary objective was to record 3-D videotape for use in museum educational programs and production of documentaries. The expedition used a towed survey system (TSS Mk1) and a self-propelled, tethered, free swimming remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV). The Mini Rover ROV was equipped with miniature stereoscopic cameras and wide angle lenses {{in order to produce}} 3-D images. The towed survey system and the Mini Rover ROV were designed, built and operated by Chris Nicholson of Deep Sea Systems International, Inc. Participants included the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the National Geographic Society, the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society (GLSHS), and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the latter providing RV Grayling as the support vessel for the ROV. The GLSHS used part of the five hours of video footage produced during the dives in a documentary and the National Geographic Society used a segment in a broadcast. Frederick Stonehouse, who wrote one of the first books on the Fitzgerald wreck, moderated a 1990 panel review of the video that drew no conclusions <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> of Fitzgeralds sinking.|$|E
5|$|Two {{competing}} {{theories have}} arisen <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> of the explosion. The {{first is that}} the bomb detonated {{in or near the}} black powder magazine used for the ship's saluting guns and catapult charges. This would have detonated first and then ignited the smokeless powder magazines which was used for the ship's main armament. A 1944 Navy Bureau of Ships report suggests that a hatch leading to the black powder magazine was left open, possibly with flammable materials stocked nearby. The Naval History and Heritage Command explained that black powder might have been stockpiled outside the armored magazine. The alternative explanation is that the bomb penetrated the armored decks and detonated directly inside one of the starboard magazines for the main armament, but smokeless powder is relatively difficult to detonate. Thus the 14-inch powder bags required a black powder pad to quickly ignite the powder. The time elapsed from the bomb hit to the magazine explosion was shorter than experience suggested burning smokeless powder required to explode. It seems unlikely that a definitive answer to this question will ever be found, as the surviving physical evidence is insufficient to determine the cause of the magazine explosion.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} match, Money Inc. (Ted DiBiase and Irwin R. Schyster) defended their WWF Tag Team Championship against The Mega-Maniacs (Hulk Hogan and Brutus Beefcake). Beefcake wore a protective titanium facemask {{because of his}} injured face, and Hulk Hogan came to the ring with a black eye, which led the announcers to speculate <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause.</b> Money Inc. gained the early advantage, but DiBiase soon injured himself by hitting Beefcake's mask. Hogan and Beefcake brawled with their enemies and controlled the match until Money Inc. was counted out. Referee Earl Hebner announced, however, that he would strip them of their title {{if they did not}} return to the ring and continue the match. DiBiase returned to the ring and rendered Hogan unconscious with the Million Dollar Dream chokehold. Beefcake attacked DiBiase by applying a sleeper hold and then turned his attention to Schyster, but DiBiase hit him in the back with Schyster's briefcase. Money Inc. attacked Beefcake and removed his facemask, but Beefcake fought back and applied a sleeper hold to Schyster. The referee was accidentally knocked unconscious, and Hogan recovered and attacked both members of Money Inc. with Beefcake's facemask. He tried to make the cover for a pinfall, but the referee still unconscious. Manager Jimmy Hart turned his jacket inside-out to reveal a striped referee jacket; he made the three-count and declared The Mega-Maniacs the winners of the match. Referee Danny Davis came to the ring and disqualified Hogan for using the facemask as a weapon. Money Inc. won the match and retained their championship, but The Mega-Maniacs threw them out of the ring and opened Schyster's briefcase to reveal stacks of cash. They celebrated in the ring and threw the money into the crowd.|$|E

25|$|During the {{investigation}} {{there was a}} large media coverage of a dispute between the Swedish Airline Pilots Association (SPF) and the Swedish Air Traffic Controllers Association (SFTF). The former accused the F10 air traffic control for not following correct civil aviation procedures. SFTF responded by an official letter to the government questioning why the pilots were represented in the commission, as this could pose a potential conflict of interest. Both parties were criticized for speculating <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> of the accident before the conclusion of the commission.|$|E
25|$|There is dispute <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> of Beethoven's death: {{alcoholic}} cirrhosis, syphilis, infectious hepatitis, lead poisoning, sarcoidosis and Whipple's disease {{have all}} been proposed.
