5|$|The {{peregrine}} falcon {{belongs to a}} genus whose lineage includes the hierofalcons and the prairie falcon (F.mexicanus). This lineage probably diverged from other falcons {{towards the end of}} the Late Miocene or in the Early Pliocene, about 5–8million years ago (mya). As the peregrine-hierofalcon group includes both Old World and North American species, it is likely that the lineage originated in western Eurasia or Africa. Its relationship to other falcons is not clear, as the issue is complicated by widespread hybridization confounding mtDNA sequence <b>analyses.</b> <b>For</b> example, a genetic lineage of the saker falcon (F.cherrug) is known which originated from a male saker producing fertile young with a female peregrine ancestor, and the descendants further breeding with sakers.|$|E

25|$|Working as a {{lecturer}} from 1814, in 1816 Hansteen {{was promoted to}} professor of astronomy and applied mathematics.

25|$|A {{review study}} {{suggested}} that the children with lesbian or gay parents appear less traditionally gender-typed {{and are more likely}} to be open to homoerotic relationships, partly due to genetic (80% of the children being raised by same-sex couples in the US are not adopted and most are the result of heterosexual marriages)) and family socialization processes (children grow up in relatively more tolerant school, neighborhood, and social contexts, which are less heterosexist), even though majority of children raised by same-sex couples identify as heterosexual. A 2005 review by Charlotte J. Patterson for the American Psychological Association found that the available data did not suggest higher rates of homosexuality among the children of lesbian or gay parents. One study suggested that children of gay and lesbian parents were more likely to adopt non-heterosexual identities, especially daughters of lesbian parents (inter-generational transfer was not significant in some <b>analyses</b> <b>for</b> sons).|$|E

2500|$|Workers {{whose work}} {{involves}} chemistry, {{but not at}} a complexity requiring an education with a chemistry degree, are {{commonly referred to as}} chemical technicians. Such technicians commonly do such work as simpler, routine <b>analyses</b> <b>for</b> quality control or in clinical laboratories, having an associate degree. A Chemical Technologists [...] has more education and/or experience than a chemical technician but less than a Chemist, often having a bachelor's degree in a different field of science with also an associate degree in chemistry (or many credits related to Chemistry) or having the same education as a Chemical technician but more experience. There are also degrees specific to become a Chemical Technologist, which are somewhat distinct from those required when a student is interested in becoming a professional Chemist. A Chemical technologist is more involved in the management and operation of the equipment and instrumentation necessary to perform chemical analyzes than a chemical technician. They are part of the team of a chemical laboratory in which the quality of the raw material, intermediate products and finished products is analyzed. They also perform functions in the areas of environmental quality control and the operational phase of a chemical plant.|$|E
2500|$|Foucault has {{frequently}} {{been criticized by}} historians for what {{they consider to be}} a lack of rigor in his <b>analyses.</b> <b>For</b> example, Hans-Ulrich Wehler harshly criticized Foucault in 1998. Wehler regards Foucault as a bad philosopher who wrongfully received a good response by the humanities and by social sciences. According to Wehler, Foucault's works are not only insufficient in their empiric historical aspects, but also often contradictory and lacking in clarity. For example, Foucault's concept of power is [...] "desperatingly undifferentiated", and Foucault's thesis of a [...] "disciplinary society" [...] is, according to Wehler, only possible because Foucault does not properly differentiate between authority, force, power, violence and legitimacy. In addition, his thesis is based on a one-sided choice of sources (prisons and psychiatric institutions) and neglects other types of organizations as e.g. factories. Also, Wehler criticizes Foucault's [...] "francocentrism" [...] because he did not take into consideration major German-speaking theorists of social sciences like Max Weber and Norbert Elias. In all, Wehler concludes that Foucault is [...] "because of the endless series of flaws in his so-called empirical studies ... an intellectually dishonest, empirically absolutely unreliable, crypto-normativist seducer of Postmodernism".|$|E
2500|$|Thorne's {{work has}} dealt with the {{prediction}} of gravitational wave strengths and their temporal signatures as observed on Earth. These [...] "signatures" [...] are of great relevance to LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory), a multi-institution gravitational wave experiment for which Thorne has been a leading proponent – in 1984, he cofounded the LIGO Project (the largest project ever funded by the NSF) to discern and measure any fluctuations between two or more 'static' points; such fluctuations would be evidence of gravitational waves, as calculations describe. A significant aspect of his research is developing the mathematics necessary to analyze these objects. Thorne also carries out engineering design <b>analyses</b> <b>for</b> features of the LIGO that cannot be developed {{on the basis of}} experiment and he gives advice on data analysis algorithms by which the waves will be sought. He has provided theoretical support for LIGO, including identifying gravitational wave sources that LIGO should target, designing the baffles to control scattered light in the LIGO beam tubes, and – in collaboration with Vladimir Braginsky's (Moscow, Russia) research group – inventing quantum nondemolition designs for advanced gravity-wave detectors and ways to reduce the most serious kind of noise in advanced detectors: thermoelastic noise. With Carlton M. Caves, Thorne invented the back-action-evasion approach to quantum nondemolition measurements of the harmonic oscillators – a technique applicable both in gravitational wave detection and quantum optics.|$|E

2500|$|A 1974 {{planning}} {{study by}} the Civil Aviation and Public Works departments identified the small island of Chek Lap Kok, off Lantau Island, as a possible airport replacement site. Away from the congested city centre, flight paths would be routed over the South China Sea rather than populous urban areas, enabling efficient round-the-clock operation of multiple runways. The Chek Lap Kok (CLK) airport master plan and civil engineering studies were completed {{towards the end of}} 1982 and 1983 respectively. In February 1983, however, the government shelved the project for financial and economic reasons. In 1988, the Port & Airport Development Strategy (PADS) Study was undertaken by consultants, headed by Mott MacDonald Hong Kong Limited, reporting in December 1989. This study looked at forecasts for both airport and port traffic to the year 2011 and came up with three recommended strategies for overall strategic development in Hong Kong. One of the three assumed maintaining the existing airport at Kai Tak; a second assumed a possible airport in the Western Harbour between Lantau Island and Hong Kong Island, and the third assumed a new airport at Chek Lap Kok. The consultants produced detailed <b>analyses</b> <b>for</b> each scenario, enabling Government to consider these appraisals {{for each of the three}} [...] "Recommended Strategies". In October 1989 the Governor of Hong Kong announced to the Legislative Council that a decision had been made on the long-term port and airport development strategy for the territory. The strategy to be adopted was that which included a replacement airport at Chek Lap Kok and incorporating new container terminals 8 and 9 at Stonecutters Island and east of the island of Tsing Yi respectively.|$|E
6000|$|As for Giovanni Sforza of whom so many able pens {{have written}} so feelingly as the constant, unfortunate victim of Borgia ambition, {{there is no}} need to enter into <b>analyses</b> <b>for</b> the purpose of judging him here. His own {{subjects}} did so in his own day. When a prince is beloved by all classes of his people, it must follow that he is a good prince and a wise ruler; when his subjects are divided into two factions, one to oppose and the other to support him, he may be good or bad, or good and bad; but when a prince can find none to stand by him in the hour of peril, it is to be concluded that he has deserved little at the hands of those whom he has ruled. The latter is the case of Giovanni Sforza--this prince whom, Yriarte tells us, [...] "rendered sweet the lives of his subjects." [...] The nobility and the proletariate of Pesaro abhorred him; the trader classes stood neutral, anxious to avoid the consequences of partisanship, since it was the class most exposed to those consequences.|$|E
