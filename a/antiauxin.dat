40|$|This {{work was}} {{designed}} to investigate the structural features required for a branched xyloglucan nonasaccharide (XG 9; composition: glucose 4 xylose 3 galactose 1 fucose 1) to exhibit anti-auxin activity in the pea (Pisum sativum L.) stem segment straight-growth bioassay. Oligosaccharides were prepared by cellulase-catalyzed hydrolysis of Rosa xyloglucan, and tested for auxin antagonism. The quantitatively major hepta-, octa-, and decasaccharides (XG 7, XG 8, and XG 10) showed no <b>antiauxin</b> activity at the concentrations tested and did {{not interfere with the}} <b>antiauxin</b> effect of 10 − 9 molar XG 9 when coincubated at equimolar concentrations. The results indicate that the XG 9 -recognition system in pea stem segments is highly discriminating. A terminal α-l-fucose residue is essential for the <b>antiauxin</b> activity of XG 9 and a neighboring terminal β-d-galactose residue can abolish the activity; possible reasons for the effect of the galactose residue are discussed. A sample of XG 9 extensively purified by gel-permeation chromatography followed by paper chromatography in two solvent systems still exhibited <b>antiauxin</b> activity with a concentration optimum around 10 − 9 molar. This diminishes the likelihood that the <b>antiauxin</b> activity reported for previous nonsaccharide preparations was due to a compound other than XG 9...|$|E
40|$|The auxin-induced growth {{reaction}} of the Avena coleoptile has been treated by methods of classical enzyme kinetics. The kinetic treatment {{makes it possible to}} characterize the growth promoting activity of an auxin by two parameters, K[subscript s] and V[subscript max]. These express respectively the affinity of the auxin for the auxin-receptive site within the plant and the ability of the complex thus established to promote growth. Treatment of Avena section growth by the methods of enzyme kinetics has made it possible to determine rigorously whether or not inhibitors of auxin-induced growth are true antiauxins and act by competing with auxin for the auxin-receptive site within the plant. Certain auxin-inactive compounds have been shown to possess <b>antiauxin</b> activity. Among such substances are 2, 4 -dichloroanisole, 4,-chloro- and 2, 4 -dichlophenoxyisobutyric acids, and 2, 6 -dichloro-and 2, 4, 6 -trichlorophenoxyacetic acids. Each of these substances can be considered as derived from an active auxin (2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) by elimination of one of the structural features essential to auxin activity and thereby capable of combining at one point of the auxin-receptive site but incapable of consumating the two-point attachment requisite for auxin activity. It is shown that chemically different auxins compete with one another for the same receptive sites within the plant. Auxins of low v[subscript max] are capable of inhibiting or augmenting the activity of auxins of greater V[subscript max]. Whether inhibition or promotion result depend on the concentrations of the two substances and the differential in V[subscript max] exhibits apparent <b>antiauxin</b> activity. This activity is shown to be different from competitive inhibition of true antiauxins. The relationship between Avena section growth rate and auxin concentration has been demonstrated to be predictable {{on the basis of a}} requirement for two-point attachment of the auxin molecule to some receptive entity within the plant. The growth inhibition resulting from high auxin concentrations is not alleviated by antiauxins but rather the auxin inhibition is augmented by the presence of sufficiently high <b>antiauxin</b> concentrations. A necessary corollary to the single point attachment <b>antiauxin</b> concert and the bimolecular complex formation concept for inhibitory auxin concentrations is therefore confirmed. A preliminary investigation concerning herbicidal activity of mixtures of an <b>antiauxin</b> and an auxin on bean plants is presented. The data obtained do not unequivocally establish that inactive bimolecular auxin receptor complex formation at high auxin concentrations is a factor contributing to herbicidal action of 2, 4 -D, but the possibility that this is in fact so is considered. A cultural technique for obtaining isolated flax root clones is described and data for some experiments with an isolated flax root clone are presented.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} by earlier workers in this laboratory (Bedford College) {{that there is a}} wide variation in the degree of stimulation by IAA of the growth of pea root sections. It was then suspected that effects of age, diffuse light in which sections were weighed and metallic impurities present in distilled water might modify this stimulation. Experiments were carried out to investigate the effects of these factors. The results of the experiments showed that age of the seedlings has a pronounced effect in the growth of root sections, but it does not alter the stimulatory effect of IAA. Strong light promotes the growth of root sections. It also causes a shift in the optimal concentration of IAA from one part in 10 to one part in 10. This seems to be due to IAA destruction. Metallic impurities such as Ca++, Mn++, Zn++, CU++ and Boron in dilute concentrations do not alter the response to IAA. Cobalt at 10 M not only stimulates root growth but also antagonises both stimulatory and inhibitory effects of IAA. It can finally be concluded that, since the concentrations of metallic impurities likely to exist in ordinary distilled water are much lower than any of the above concentrations of metals giving interference with IAA stimulation, variations in the quantities of metallic impurities in ordinary distilled water {{are not likely to be}} the cause of the previously observed variations in sensitivity to stimulatory concentrations of IAA. The main concern of the investigations was studies on the interaction of IAA with <b>antiauxins</b> i. e. N. M. S. P., N. M. S. A., C. N. B. and P. C. I. B. in the stimulation of root section growth and also the interaction between <b>antiauxins</b> themselves. The investigations of this nature should throw some light on the hypothesis postulated by Audus and Shipton (1952) that auxin (IAA) and <b>antiauxins</b> stimulate the growth of root sections by antagonising the action of a natural inhibitor which holds the root growth below the possible maximum. The results of the interaction experiments with these compounds at growth stimulatory concentrations support the hypothesis that both types of compound are exerting fundamentally the same action in the growth system but suggest that the action is a direct one and not due to an antagonism of a natural endogenous growth inhibitor. <p...|$|R

40|$|Changes in {{the pattern}} of protein {{synthesis}} and in the translatable mRNA population have been examined during auxin-induced root development from excised mung bean seedlings. Several proteins, predominantly of low molecular weight and high pI, as shown by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, are synthesized specifically by auxin-treated tissue. These auxin-induced proteins appear between 6 and 12 hours of auxin treatment, reach a maximum at 24 hours, and decline at 48 hours. Untreated seedlings (placed in Hoagland solution), known to produce small number of roots at the cut end probably due to endogeneous auxin accumulated at the cut end through basipetal transport, show low level synthesis of auxin-specific proteins. <b>Antiauxin</b> treatment that completely inhibits auxin-induced rooting also prevents the appearance of auxin-induced proteins. The induction of a group of three to four proteins appears to be specific to <b>antiauxin</b> treatment. In vitro translation of mRNA from auxin-treated tissue, but not of mRNA from antiauxin-treated tissue, yields several polypeptides of low molecular weight and high pI. Since the auxin-induced proteins precede root development and are synthesized transitorily, it is likely that they play some regulatory role during the initiation of root development. The result show that auxin-induced root formation involves altered gene expression...|$|E

Proliferation rate of shoot is decreased drastically following several subcultures. Growth regulators have remarkable {{effects on the}} key phase of proliferation in micropropagation of this popular crop. In this research the effects of BAP and <b>antiauxin</b> of TIBA on {{quality and quantity of}} developed shoots in Rosa hybrida cv. Full House were studied. BAP and TIBA were applied at three concentrations of 0, 2. 2 and 8. 8 µmol in proliferation phase of micropropagation.

After two months, the percentage of proliferated explants, survived main and lateral shoot number, length of the main and lateral shoots, number of green leaves on the shoots, the average number of shoots with chlorotic and necrotic leaves, the average axillary shoot base diameter, fresh weight of shoots and number of shoots with necrotic tip were recorded. Analysis of variance indicated that BAP was ineffective on the number of the main shoot green leaves and decreasing number of shoots with necrotic tip, but enhanced other traits. The concentration of 8. 8 µmol of BAP had greater effect than 2. 2 µmol of this growth regulator on mentioned traits. The higher concentration of TIBA resulted to more shoot with necrotic tip.

40|$|When cultured in {{inductive}} medium containing adequate auxin and cytokinin, isolated mesophyll {{cells of}} Zinnia elegans L. cv Envy differentiate into tracheary elements with lignified secondary wall thickenings. Differentiation {{does not occur}} when cells are cultured in control medium, which has reduced levels of auxin and/or cytokinin. The activities of two enzymes involved in lignin synthesis, 4 -coumarate:coenzyme A ligase and peroxidase, were examined. An induction-specific cationic isoperoxidase, visualized by low pH polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, is detectable in soluble and wall fractions of cultured Zinnia cells long before tracheary elements visibly differentiate and is thus an early marker of differentiation.

The <b>antiauxin</b> p-chlorophenoxyisobutyric acid enhanced translocation of 2, 4, 5 -trichlorophenoxyacetic acid to the growing shoots and primary leaves. Translocation to the roots was unaffected by p-chlorophenoxyisobutyric acid while leaching of 2, 4, 5 -trichlorophenoxyacetic acid into the nutrient solution was enhanced slightly. Steam girdling experiments revealed that translocation to the primary leaves was in the xylem. The protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, inhibited accumulation of 2, 4, 5 -trichlorophenoxyacetic acid in young shoots, epicotyls, and roots and enhanced accumulation in the primary leaves.

40|$|The {{development}} of somatic embryos is, in many plants, inhibited by 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 -D) and other auxins. The finding that difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) can counteract this inhibition {{has been used}} to test some of the hypotheses for the mechanism of inhibition. Inhibition of somatic embryogenesis in carrot (Daucus carota L.) by exogenous ethylene (from ethephon), antioxidants (ascorbic acid and glutathione), ethanol/acetaldehyde and abscisic acid was not counteracted by DFMO, indicating that the inhibitory effect of 2, 4 -D is not manifest through the formation of these compounds. Embryogenesis was abolished by micromolar concentrations of the polar auxin transport inhibitors 2, 3, 5 -triiodobenzoic acid (TIBA), N- 1 -naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) and 9 -hydroxyfluorene- 9 -carboxylic acid (HFCA).

Inhibition by relatively high concentrations of the <b>antiauxin</b> 2 -(p-chlorophenoxy) -isobutyric acid (CPIB), which does not affect polar auxin transport, was in contrast not counteracted by DFMO.

40|$|Exogenous {{application}} of indoleacetic acid {{results in a}} significant suppression of the linear growth that is promoted by exogenous gibberellic acid in Avena stem segments in a fashion similar to that previously noted in Avena leaf base segments (van Overbeek and Dowding, 1961, Fourth International Conference Plant Growth Regulation). Treatment with the auxin transport inhibitors, methyl- 2 -chloro- 9 -hydroxyfluorene-(9) -carboxylate (CFM) or 2, 3, 5 -triiodobenzoic acid (TIBA), alone promotes elongation growth of the stem segments over that of control growth. This effect is interpreted as being due to the interference in the transport of native indoleacetic acid by CFM and TIBA, thus removing the inhibitory effect of native indoleacetic acid on gibberellin-promoted growth in the internodal intercalary meristem. This results in a greater promotion of internodal growth by native gibberellins. In the presence of (2 -chloroethyl) trimethylammonium chloride (CCC), the growth-promoting effects of CFM and TIBA are decreased, and the <b>antiauxin,</b> PCIB (4 -chloro-phenoxyisobutyric acid), has no growth-promoting effects whatsoever.

Kinetin (10 − 5 and 10 − 6 molar) stimulates development of tillers and inhibits development of root primordia, whereas indoleacetic acid (IAA) (10 − 5 and 10 − 6 molar) causes the reverse effects. Abscisic acid strongly inhibits kinetin-induced tiller bud release and elon-gation and IAA-induced adventitious root development. IAA, in combination with kinetin, also inhibits kinetin-induced bud prophyll (outermost leaf of the axillary bud) elongation. The IAA oxidase cofactor p-coumaric acid stimulates lateral bud release; the auxin transport inhibitor 2, 3, 5 -triiodo-benzoic acid and the <b>antiauxin</b> α (p-chlorophenoxy) -isobutyric acid inhibit IAA-induced adventitious root formation. Gibberellic acid is synergistic with kinetin in the elongation of the bud prophyll. In intact oat plants, tiller release is induced by shoot decapitation, geostimulation, or the emergence of the inflorescence. Results shown support the apical dominance theory, namely, that the cytokinin to auxin ratio plays a decisive role in determining whether tillers are released or adventitious roots develop.

40|$|Germination of mung bean, Phaseolus mungo L., and wheat, Triticum aestivum L., seeds {{was used}} for {{bioassay}} to demonstrate the toxic effects of selected pesticides [...] menazon, disulfoton, and GS- 14254 [...] and allergens [...] alantolactone and usnic acid. The ability of gibberellic acid to counteract the toxic effects of these chemicals on germination and seedling growth was studied. Chemical composition of the treated and untreated seeds was made with special attention to starch and protein degradation. Effect of these toxicants on the synthesis of amylase, ATPase, and protease enzymes during germination was studied since these enzymes are synthesized de novo during germination. To ascertain their effect on protein synthesis in storage tissue of the germinating seeds, uptake and incorporation of 14 C-L-leucine into protein was studied in potato tuber slices and germinating mung beans. Correlation of biochemical data and histochemical changes in the treated and untreated seeds of mung bean was obtained with menazon and usnic acid. Furthermore, ultrastructural changes were studied in order to relate functional and structural changes in the seeds. in conjunction with phytotoxic actions of these chemicals. Among the insecticides, menazon (250 ppm) {{was found to be}} more toxic to both species than was disulfoton. GS- 14254 (100 ppm) also was equally inhibitory to seed germination and seedling growth of mung bean and wheat seeds. When a solution of the herbicide GS- 14254 (100 ppm) was added to either of the insecticides at their maximum concentrations the inhibitory effect of the combined pesticides on seed germination and seedling growth was more pronounced, especially with wheat. Usnic acid (50 to 250 mg/ 1) and alantolactone (100 mg/ 1) significantly inhibited germination and root and shoot growth in both mung bean and wheat seeds. These two compounds appeared to be more phytotoxic than the pesticides. Gibberellic acid partially counteracted the inhibitory effects of the pesticides and allergens, thus these chemicals showed no <b>antiauxin</b> activity. Before any growth is observed there is a marked increase in respiration during germination that releases energy from food materials already present in usable form in the cells. At their maximum concentrations, menazon, disulfoton, GS- 14254, alantolactone, and usnic acid significantly blocked the respiration of the germinating seeds at the end of 72 h after treatment. In all cases except alantolactone respiration of wheat seeds was considerably more affected than that of the mung beans. Compared to control seeds, pesticide chemicals as well as allergenic compounds caused significant reduction in the amounts of soluble reducing sugars and free amino acids after 72 h germination period. Similarly, starch degradation was less in the treated seeds. Among the species of seeds, considerably less amounts of reducing sugars and amino acids were formed in the pesticide-treated wheat seeds than in the mung beans as compared to their respective controls. Such differences in the inhibitory effects were not observed in seeds treated with allergenic compounds. The development of amylase and ATPase activity in the seeds treated with maximum concentrations of pesticides tended to be lower than that in the control seeds. In case of menazon, inhibition of amylase activity was more pronounced than that of disulfoton or GS- 14254. Proteoiytic activity in control and disulfoton- and menazon-treated seeds was not significantly different during germination period, but in case of GS- 14254, it was considerably lower. Usnic acid at highest concentration tested completely inhibited the development of amylase activity in mung beans whereas it was significantly lower in seeds treated with the maximum concentration of alantolactone. The inhibition of amylase activity in wheat seeds treated with these compounds was more or less similar. ATPase inhibition in seeds treated with usnic acid was more severe than that in alantolactone treated seeds. However, proteolytic activity in control and treated seeds showed almost the same trend during the germination period. The activity per se of amylase isolated from mung bean and wheat seeds germinated for 3 days was not significantly inhibited by the presence of the pesticides or allergens in the reaction mixture indicating that these chemicals do not inhibit already synthesized amylase enzyme. Observations with potato tissue and germinating mung beans indicated that both total uptake and incorporation of 14 c-L-leucine into protein were significantly inhibited by menazon, disulfoton, GS- 14254, and alantolactone. On the other hand, the uptake in germinating mung bean treated with usnic acid was not affected although both uptake and incorporation were inhibited in potato tissue. Menazon and usnic acid were then selected as the representative chemicals for pesticides and allergens, respectively, and their toxic effects were studied histochemically in 3 -day germinating mung beans. It was observed that total nucleic acid content and RNA content in seeds treated with these chemicals were considerably less than that in the control seeds. Similarly, treated seeds showed more starch grains and protein bodies indicating less metabolic activity in these seeds. At the ultrastructural level, menazon- or usnic acid-treated mung bean cotyledons at day 3 of germination contained no vacuoles but many undigested protein bodies were observed. In contrast, fully developed mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum with ribosomes, and vacuoles were seen in control cells indicating protein (enzyme) synthesis and digestion of the food reserves...|$|E

Em seguida, inocularam-se as gemas em meio MS solido contendo diferentes combinacoes de BAP (0; 0, 5; 1, 0 e 1, 5 mg L- 1) e NAA (0; 0, 5 e 1, 0 mg L- 1). Apos 60 dias, foram selecionados os melhores tratamentos para proliferacao das brotacoes, que foram individualizadas e transferidas para estes meios por mais trinta dias, em meio MS liquido. Plantas oriundas do experimento anterior tiveram as folhas cortadas e apenas segmentos de 1 cm foram inoculados em meio MS liquido contendo os diferentes tratamentos: T 1 -MS, T 2 -MS + 1, 0 mg L- 1 BAP + 0, 5 mg L- 1 NAA, T 3 -MS + 1, 0 mg L- 1 BAP + 0, 5 mg L- 1 NAA + 10 mM SPD, T 4 -MS + 1, 0 mg L- 1 BAP + 0, 5 mg L- 1 NAA + 10 mM SPM, T 5 -MS + 1, 0 mg L- 1 BAP + 0, 5 mg L- 1 NAA + 10 mM PUT, T 6 -MS + 10 mM SPD, T 7 -MS + 10 mM SPM e T 8 -MS + 10 mM PUT. Na ultima fase, segmentos foram inoculados em meio MS liquido contendo os tratamentos: T 1 -MS, T 2 -MS + 1, 0 mg L- 1 BAP + 0, 5 mg L- 1 NAA, T 3 -MS + 0, 5 ÊM TIBA, T 4 -MS + 1, 0 ÊM TIBA, T 5 -MS + 2, 0 ÊM TIBA, T 6 -MS + 4, 0 ÊM TIBA, T 7 -MS + 8, 0 ÊM TIBA e T 8 -MS + 16, 0 ÊM TIBA. Apos, as plantas foram aclimatizadas em substrato Plantmax e houve 100 % de sobrevivencia, independente do tratamento. Foram realizados cortes histologicos foliares para estudar a influencia das poliaminas e TIBA na anatomia foliar [...] . The {{effects of}} exogenous polyamines and TIBA (<b>antiauxin)</b> application in the micropropagation, leaf anatomy of pineapple plants IAC Gomo-de-mel and {{the contents of}} endogenous polyamines, peroxidase activity, protein, IAA-oxidase and probable relationship with the different micropropagation phases were studied. Initially, the axillary bud explants were excised from the crown of healthy fruits and the asepsis was accomplished with sodium hypochloride (2 to 2, 5 % of active chlorine) 30 % for 20 minutes and washed 3 times in distilled and autoclaveted water. After, the axillary buds were inoculated in MS solid medium containing the different BAP (0; 0, 5; 1, 0 and 1, 5 mg L- 1) and NAA (0; 0, 5 and 1, 0 mg L- 1) combinations. After 60 days, the best treatments were selected for shoot proliferation that were individualized and transferred to these media for more 30 days, in MS liquid medium. Plants from the previous experiment had the leaves cut and just 1 cm segments were inoculated in MS liquid medium containing the different treatments: T 1 -MS, T 2 -MS + 1, 0 mg L- 1 BAP + 0, 5 mg L- 1 NAA, T 3 -MS + 1, 0 mg L- 1 BAP + 0, 5 mg L- 1 NAA + 10 mM SPD, T 4 - MS + 1, 0 mg L- 1 BAP + 0, 5 mg L- 1 NAA + 10 mM SPM, T 5 -MS + 1, 0 mg L- 1 BAP + 0, 5 mg L- 1 NAA + 10 mM PUT, T 6 -MS + 10 mM SPD, T 7 -MS + 10 mM SPM and T 8 -MS + 10 mM PUT. In the last phase, segments were inoculated in MS liquid medium containing the treatments: T 1 -MS, T 2 -MS + 1, 0 mg L- 1 BAP + 0, 5 mg L- 1 NAA, T 3 -MS + 0, 5 mM TIBA, T 4 -MS + 1, 0 mM TIBA, T 5 -MS + 2, 0 mM TIBA, T 6 -MS + 4, 0 mM TIBA, T 7 -MS + 8, 0 mM TIBA and T 8 -MS + 16, 0 mM TIBA. After, the plants were acclimatizated in Plantmax substrate and there were 100 % survival, independent of the treatment. Leaf cuts were made to study polyamines and TIBA influence in the leaf anatomy. The highest shoot number wasobserved with 1, 0 mg L- 1 BAP + 0, 5 mg L- 1 NAA, however with hyperhydricity [...] .
