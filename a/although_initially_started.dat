50|$|Twist Magic {{returned}} in the Haldon Gold Cup {{for the third}} year running, this time failing by half a length to concede 19 lbs to his stablemate Tchico Polos, who was ridden by Ruby Walsh. Plans to run in the Tingle Creek were scuppered when Sandown was lost to the weather and the race was transferred to Cheltenham, a track Twist Magic did not prefer. Instead he was rerouted to the Peterborough Chase, also rearranged due to frost and held this year at Newbury. <b>Although</b> <b>initially</b> reluctant to <b>start,</b> Twist Magic had taken the lead and was travelling powerfully when he fell at the second last fence and fractured a fetlock, resulting in him being put down. Jockey Sam Thomas escaped unharmed. Trainer Paul Nicholls paid tribute, calling him “such a wonderful horse” and the injury “a real tragedy”.|$|R
3000|$|Another {{important}} contribution {{at that time}} came from Jacob Mincer, who was writing his PhD dissertation (finished in [1957] and published in a short version on the JPE in 1958). In his dissertation, Mincer developed what then {{became known as the}} [...] "schooling model", which attempted to use human capital (education and training) as a major explanatory device for empirical findings such as a higher remuneration for occupations requiring more training and a more pronounced lifetime income pattern as a result of training on the job. A peculiar aspect of Mincer’s initial work on human capital was that he developed it while largely unaware that other people were interested in turning human capital into an explanatory principle for several economic issues. <b>Although</b> Mincer <b>initially</b> <b>started</b> his graduate studies in Chicago, he then moved to Columbia for personal reasons and graduated there in [1957]. Mincer and Schultz interacted more closely when Mincer went to Chicago as a post-doctoral fellow (1957 – 8) after an invitation from Schultz. Mincer’s short but intensive period at Chicago would provide him with important stimulus to explore further the relevance of human capital theory (in particular the role of on-the-job training) for lifetime income and income inequality, which led to important publications in the early 1960 s (for more details see Teixeira [2007], [2011]).|$|R
