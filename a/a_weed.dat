5|$|A {{hardy and}} {{versatile}} garden plant, B.integrifolia is widely planted in Australian gardens. It {{is a popular}} choice for parks and streetscapes, and {{has been used for}} bush revegetation and stabilisation of dunes. Its hardiness has prompted research into its suitability for use as a rootstock in the cut flower trade, but has also caused concerns about its potential to become <b>a</b> <b>weed</b> outside its natural habitat.|$|E

5|$|Lettuce {{was first}} {{cultivated}} {{by the ancient}} Egyptians who turned it from <b>a</b> <b>weed</b> whose seeds were used to produce oil, into a food plant grown for its succulent leaves and oil-rich seeds. Lettuce spread to the Greeks and Romans, the latter of whom gave it the name , from which the English lettuce is ultimately derived. By 50 AD, many types were described, and lettuce appeared often in medieval writings, including several herbals. The 16th through 18th centuries saw the development of many varieties in Europe, and by the mid-18th century cultivars were described that can still be found in gardens.|$|E
5|$|The Asiatic dayflower is {{considered}} <b>a</b> <b>weed</b> both {{in areas where}} it was introduced and {{in certain parts of}} its native range. The flowers' interactions with pollinators have been well studied and have helped to support important hypotheses about pollination in the field of plant ecology. Recent research has also revealed that the Asiatic dayflower can bioaccumulate a number of metals, making it a candidate for revegetating and essentially cleaning spoiled copper mines. Several animals and fungi use the plant as a food source, with a few species feeding upon it exclusively.|$|E
5|$|Vavilovian mimicry {{presents}} {{an illustration of}} unintentional (or rather 'anti-intentional') selection by man. Weeders {{do not want to}} select weeds and their seeds that look increasingly like cultivated plants, yet there is no other option. For example, the Echinochloa oryzoides plant, a species of grass found as <b>a</b> <b>weed</b> in rice (Oryza sativa) fields, looks similar to rice; its seeds are often mixed in rice and have become difficult to separate through Vavilovian mimicry. Vavilovian mimics may eventually be domesticated themselves, {{as in the case of}} rye in wheat; Vavilov called these weed-crops secondary crops.|$|E
50|$|A. conyzoides {{is prone}} to {{becoming}} <b>a</b> rampant environmental <b>weed</b> when grown outside of its natural range. It is <b>an</b> invasive <b>weed</b> in Africa, Australia, Southeast Asia and the USA. It is considered <b>a</b> moderate <b>weed</b> of rice cultivation in Asia.|$|R

5|$|Ectomycorrhizal, Amanita muscaria forms {{symbiotic}} {{relationships with}} many trees, including pine, spruce, fir, birch, and cedar. Commonly seen under introduced trees, A.muscaria is the fungal equivalent of <b>a</b> <b>weed</b> in New Zealand, Tasmania and Victoria, forming new associations with southern beech (Nothofagus). The species is also invading a rainforest in Australia, {{where it may}} be displacing the native species. It appears to be spreading northwards, with recent reports placing it near Port Macquarie on the New South Wales north coast. It was recorded under silver birch (Betula pendula) in Manjimup, Western Australia in 2010. Although it has apparently not spread to eucalypts in Australia, it has been recorded associating with them in Portugal.|$|E
5|$|Top-Insight International {{licensed}} Ginga Legend Weed {{for release}} in Taiwan. The company released seven individual DVDs, and one complete box set. The series aired in Taiwan on China Television. Future Film licensed and released the series in Finland. The company released Ginga Legend Weed on eight separate DVDs between August2,2006 and December5,2006. On November14,2007, Future Film released the entire series on a collector's edition. The release was bundled with <b>a</b> <b>Weed</b> booklet and mobile phone charm. In Sweden, AudVid distributed the series in one box set on June15,2007. The set included an extra 16-page booklet. The Finnish and Swedish releases included both Swedish and Finnish subtitles. In Denmark, Scanbox Entertainment released eight DVDs containing the series in 2007, and in 2008 produced two box sets containing episodes 1-13 and 14-26, respectively. In {{addition to a}} Danish dub, Scanbox's release included Danish and Norwegian subtitles.|$|E
5|$|Aggressive mimicry {{stands in}} {{semantic}} contrast with defensive mimicry, {{where it is}} the prey {{that acts as a}} mimic, with predators being duped. Defensive mimicry includes the well-known Batesian and Müllerian forms of mimicry, where the mimic shares outward characteristics with an aposematic or harmful model. In Batesian mimicry, the mimic is modeled on a dangerous (usually unpalatable) species, while in Müllerian mimicry both species are harmful, and act as comimics, converging on a common set of signals and sharing the burden of 'educating' their predators. Also included in defensive mimicry is the lesser known Mertensian mimicry, where the mimic is more harmful than the model, and Vavilovian mimicry, where weeds come to mimic crops through unintentional artificial selection. In defensive mimicry, the mimic benefits by avoiding a harmful interaction with another organism that {{would be more likely to}} take place without the deceptive signals employed. Harmful interactions might involve being eaten, or pulled out of the ground as <b>a</b> <b>weed.</b> In contrast, the aggressive mimic benefits from an interaction that would be less likely to take place without the deception, at the expense of its target.|$|E

5|$|Although Fillmore {{had retired}} from the {{legislature}} after the 1831 session, he did not remain absent from politics for long. In 1832, {{he ran for the}} House of Representatives, and was elected. The Anti-Masonic presidential candidate, former Attorney General William Wirt, won only Vermont as President Jackson easily gained re-election. At the time, Congress convened its annual session in December, and so Fillmore had to wait {{more than a year after}} his election to take his seat. Fillmore, Weed, and others had realized that opposition to Masonry was too narrow a foundation on which to build a national party, and assembled the broad-based Whig Party from National Republicans, Anti-Masons, and disaffected Democrats. The Whigs were initially united by their opposition to Jackson, but became a major party by expanding their platform to include support for economic growth through rechartering the Second Bank of the United States and federally funded internal improvements including roads, bridges, and canals. Weed joined the Whigs before Fillmore, and became a power within the party; his anti-slavery views were stronger than Fillmore's (who, though he disliked slavery, deemed the federal government without power over it), and closer to those of another prominent New York Whig, William H. Seward of Auburn, who was also seen as <b>a</b> <b>Weed</b> protégé.|$|E

40|$|Alligatorweed forms dense mats {{along the}} {{shoreline}} of lakes, ponds, streams, ditches, and wetlands, with the mat ex-tending out into open water. The dense growth suppresses native plant species, reduces the quality of habitat for water-fowl, wildlife, and fish, and will reduce oxygen levels in the water under the mat. The dense growth interfere with naviga-tion and recreational use, and will exacerbate flooding. Regulations Alligatorweed is not listed as <b>a</b> federal noxious <b>weed,</b> although the related sessile joyweed (Alternanthera sessilis) was listed out of concern that it too would become <b>a</b> widespread <b>weed.</b> It is listed as <b>a</b> noxious <b>weed</b> in AR and SC, and <b>a</b> Class C <b>weed</b> in AL.

25|$|GMO crops can, however, {{result in}} genetic {{contamination}} of native plant species through hybridization.
