25|$|Both {{hard-wired}} (cable) and through-water electronic voice {{communications systems}} {{may be used}} with surface supplied diving. Wired systems are more popular {{as there is a}} physical connection to the diver for gas supply in any case, and adding a cable does not make the system <b>any</b> <b>different</b> to handle. Wired communications systems are still more reliable and simpler to maintain than through-water systems. The communications equipment is relatively straightforward and may be of the two-wire or four-wire type. Two wire systems use the same wires for surface to diver and diver to surface messages, whereas four wire systems allow the diver's messages and the surface operator's messages to use separate wire pairs.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{a complex}} set of reasons, {{conditions}} in Western Europe began to improve after 700. In that year, the two major powers in western Europe were the Franks in Gaul and the Lombards in Italy. The Lombards had been thoroughly Romanized, and their kingdom was stable and well developed. The Franks, in contrast, were barely <b>any</b> <b>different</b> from their barbarian Germanic ancestors. Their kingdom was weak, hopelessly divided, and ruled by a king who was barely distinguishable from a peasant. Impossible to guess at the time, {{but by the end of}} the century, the Lombardic kingdom would be extinct, while the Frankish kingdom would have nearly reassembled the Western Roman Empire.|$|E

He had seen many acts come and go during his earlier years in management, and felt that to think that Presley, despite being Parker's most successful act to date, would be <b>any</b> <b>different,</b> was foolish. In January 1958 Presley received his draft notice from the United States Army. He was upset {{about the possibility of}} it affecting his career, but Parker was secretly overjoyed. Presley had been showing signs of rebellion against him recently, and Parker believed that a stint in the Army would cure him of this.|$|E
25|$|This {{branch of}} {{recursion}} theory analyzed the following question: For fixed m and n with 0<m<n, for which functions A {{is it possible}} to compute for <b>any</b> <b>different</b> n inputs x1,x2,...,xn a tuple of n numbers y1,y2,...,yn such that at least m of the equations A(xk) = yk are true. Such sets are known as (m,n)-recursive sets. The first major result in this branch of Recursion Theory is Trakhtenbrot's result that a set is computable if it is (m,n)-recursive for some m,n with 2m>n. On the other hand, Jockusch's semirecursive sets (which were already known informally before Jockusch introduced them 1968) are examples of a set which is (m,n)-recursive if and only if 2m<n+1. There are uncountably many of these sets and also some recursively enumerable but noncomputable sets of this type. Later, Degtev established a hierarchy of recursively enumerable sets that are (1,n+1)-recursive but not (1,n)-recursive. After a long phase of research by Russian scientists, this subject became repopularized in the west by Beigel's thesis on bounded queries, which linked frequency computation to the above-mentioned bounded reducibilities and other related notions. One of the major results was Kummer's Cardinality Theory which states that a set A is computable if and only if there is an n such that some algorithm enumerates for each tuple of n different numbers up to n many possible choices of the cardinality of this set of n numbers intersected with A; these choices must contain the true cardinality but leave out at least one false one.|$|E
25|$|In a federated {{database}} {{system or}} any other more loosely defined multidatabase system, which are typically distributed in a communication network, transactions span multiple (and possibly distributed) databases. Enforcing global serializability in such system, where different databases may use different types of concurrency control, is problematic. Even if every local schedule of a single database is serializable, the global schedule of a whole system is not necessarily serializable. The massive communication exchanges of conflict information needed between databases to reach conflict serializability globally would lead to unacceptable performance, primarily due to computer and communication latency. Achieving global serializability effectively over different types of concurrency control has been open for several years. Commitment ordering (or Commit ordering; CO), a serializability technique publicly introduced in 1991 by Yoav Raz from Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), provides an effective general solution for global (conflict) serializability across any collection of database systems and other transactional objects, with possibly different concurrency control mechanisms. CO does not need the distribution of conflict information, but rather utilizes the already needed (unmodified) atomic commitment protocol messages without any further communication between databases. It also allows optimistic (non-blocking) implementations. CO generalizes Strong strict two phase locking (SS2PL), which {{in conjunction with the}} Two-phase commit (2PC) protocol is the de facto standard for achieving global serializability across (SS2PL based) database systems. As a result, CO compliant database systems (with <b>any,</b> <b>different</b> concurrency control types) can transparently join existing SS2PL based solutions for global serializability. The same applies also to all other multiple (transactional) object systems that use atomic transactions and need global serializability for correctness (see examples above; nowadays such need is not smaller than with database systems, the origin of atomic transactions).|$|E

500|$|The 1998 {{season was}} not {{expected}} to be <b>any</b> <b>different,</b> as the Falcons had failed to reach the playoffs the previous two seasons and only made the playoffs twice in the previous fifteen seasons. However, head coach Dan Reeves, who was hired before the previous season, had overhauled the roster in an attempt to reverse the team's fortunes. Thirty-eight of the fifty-three players on the 1998 Falcons team had been brought in by Reeves over the previous year, including journeyman quarterback Chris Chandler, who had a career-best season in 1998. Running back Jamal Anderson also posted a career-high 1846 rushing yards, which led the NFC that year, and the defense finished fourth overall in points allowed. As a result, the Falcons won the NFC West with a record of 14–2 and clinched 2nd overall seed in the NFC playoffs, behind only the Vikings. The team was nicknamed the [...] "Dirty Birds" [...] after a touchdown dance created by tight end O.J. Santiago [...] but popularized by Anderson.|$|E
