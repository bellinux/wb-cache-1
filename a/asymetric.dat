Its tertiary structure is basically composed by alpha domain, formed almost exclusively from alpha helix. Its size is of 31,489 bases composed by 618 amino acids and has a molecular mass of 69900 Da. cIAP1 contains baculovirus IAP repeat domains that facilitate binding to caspases and other proteins. cIAP1 is recruited to TNF receptor complexes where they support cell survival through NF-kB activation while suppressing apoptosis by preventing caspase activation.|$|E

[...] This is potentially problematic, as by definition set-off deals with two separate claims. It seems that set-off is to be viewed defensively with respect to each claim, which creates the possibility of <b>asymetric</b> application (ie. set-off might operate to partly extinguish a German law claim, but not partly extinguish the Spanish claim which is relied upon to do so). The better view would presumably be that the set-off must be operative under each governing law to be effective under either.|$|E
