40|$|Only {{abstract}} of poster available. Track III: Energy InfrastructureChallenges {{within the}} utilities servicing customers with electric power {{are faced with}} an evolving landscape of security requirements. Regardless of the issuing body, security regulations and/or standards offer a unique challenge to utilities in terms of design of security controls and more importantly the overall integration of each control within an operational environment that remains sensible in terms of day-to-day usage and overall cost. Security projects are becoming less about technology and gizmos and more {{about the business of}} incorporating key event data from security controls into a coherent and intelligent manner. Companies choosing to focus on cameras and <b>access</b> <b>card</b> <b>readers</b> rather than on integrated solutions are faced with higher overall maintenance costs, costly management, and in many cases poorly designed solutions failing to meet the basic vulnerabilities originally identified. This course will discuss the issues presented above by examining the following topics: 1. What are the current regulations and/or standards requiring security controls for electric system assets? 2. What are the common vulnerabilities for electric system assets? 3. What are the prevailing security solutions for these vulnerabilities? 4. What are the steps necessary for building an integrated security program for addressing vulnerabilities and responding to critical events? 5. What has been proven successful in the industry...|$|R

Microsoft Windows systems utilize the ActivCard Gold middleware software to enable CAC reader functionality. This software package is well integrated and documented in the Microsoft Windows environment. Starting with Macintosh OS X 10. 4. x, {{there was no need to}} install any middleware software as all of the support for the US Federal Smart Cards is built in.

40|$|Over the years, several {{security}} {{measures have been}} employed to combat the menace of insecurity of lives and property. This is done by preventing unauthorized entrance into buildings through entrance doors using conventional and electronic locks, discrete access code, and biometric methods such as the finger prints, thumb prints, the iris and facial recognition. In this paper, a prototyped door security system is designed to allow a privileged user to access a secure keyless door where valid smart card authentication guarantees an entry. The model consists of hardware module and software which provides a functionality to allow the door to be controlled through the authentication of smart card by the microcontroller unit.

25|$|The {{proprietary}} {{nature of}} the complete SD specification affects embedded systems, laptop computers, and some desktop computers; many desktop computers do not have card slots, instead using USB-based <b>card</b> <b>readers</b> if necessary. These <b>card</b> <b>readers</b> present a standard USB mass storage interface to memory cards, thus separating the operating system from {{the details of the}} underlying SD interface. However, embedded systems (such as portable music players) usually gain direct <b>access</b> to SD <b>cards</b> and thus need complete programming information. Desktop <b>card</b> <b>readers</b> are themselves embedded systems; their manufacturers have usually paid the SDA for complete access to the SD specifications. Many notebook computers now include SD <b>card</b> <b>readers</b> not based on USB; device drivers for these essentially gain direct access to the SD card, as do embedded systems.|$|R

The Tappr <b>Card</b> <b>Reader</b> combines credit and debit card acceptance with an App Marketplace and supports digital wallets, P2P payments, transportation schemes and Bitcoins. The <b>Card</b> <b>Reader</b> runs Android Ice Cream Sandwich and Tappr has built their own SDK which is currently available in beta to enlisted third party developers to develop apps for the <b>Card</b> <b>Reader.</b> The <b>Card</b> <b>Reader</b> supports the ARM A8 processor with 512 MB of RAM to provide adequate capacity for apps with high graphics and data requirements. The <b>Card</b> <b>Reader</b> also supports a TFT 2.8" [...] color LCD touch screen for added functionality. Tappr's aims to release their SDK to the public after official launch of the Tappr <b>Card</b> <b>Reader.</b> Tappr claims the <b>Card</b> <b>Reader</b> to be a Gen 2 product in mPOS hardware. Hales suggests while many people will use the Tappr <b>Card</b> <b>Reader</b> to [...] "just" [...] accept a payment, opening up our SDK to the developer community opens up a new world to enrich the relationship between merchants and consumers by offering new and exciting ways {{to buy and sell}} things. The Tappr <b>Card</b> <b>Reader</b> will be release in three colors varieties including Black, White and Blue, however other colors will be available once pilot production is commenced.

5000|$|CAC {{is based}} on X.509 {{certificates}} with software middleware enabling an operating system to interface with the card via a hardware <b>card</b> <b>reader.</b> Although <b>card</b> manufacturers such as Schlumberger provided a suite of smartcard, hardware <b>card</b> <b>reader</b> and middleware for both Linux and Windows, not all other CAC systems integrators did likewise. In an attempt to correct this situation, Apple Federal Systems has done work for adding some support for Common <b>Access</b> <b>Cards</b> to their later Snow Leopard operating system updates {{out of the box}} using the MUSCLE (Movement for the Use of Smartcards in a Linux Environment) project. The procedure for this was documented historically by the Naval Postgraduate School in the publication [...] "CAC on a Mac" [...] although today the school uses commercial software. According to the independent military testers and help desks, not all cards are supported by the open source code associated with Apple's work, particularly the recent CACNG or CAC-NG PIV II CAC cards. Third party support for CAC Cards on the Mac are available from vendors such as Centrify and Thursby Software. Apple's Federal Engineering Management suggest not using the out-of-the-box support in Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard but instead supported third party solutions. Mac OS X 10.7 Lion has no native smart card support. Thursby's PKard for iOS software extends CAC support to Apple iPads and iPhones. Some work has also been done in the Linux realm. Some users are using the MUSCLE project combined with Apple's Apple Public Source Licensed Common <b>Access</b> <b>Card</b> software. Another approach to solve this problem, which is now well documented, involves the use of a new project, CoolKey, to gain Common <b>Access</b> <b>Card</b> functionality. This document is available publicly from the Naval Research Laboratory's Ocean Dynamics and Predictions Branch. The Software Protection Initiative offers a LiveCD with CAC middleware and DoD certificate within a browser-focused, minimized Linux OS, called LPS-Public that works on x86 Windows, Mac, and Linux computers.|$|R
