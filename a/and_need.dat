5|$|Between October 1942 and November 1943, Groves paid monthly {{visits to}} the Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley. Reports {{indicated}} that compared to the alternatives of a gaseous diffusion plant or a plutonium-producing nuclear reactor, an electromagnetic plant would take longer and require more scarce materials to build, <b>and</b> <b>need</b> more manpower and more electricity to operate. The cost of a kilogram of fissile material would therefore be much greater. On the other hand, while the alternative processes still faced considerable technical obstacles, the electromagnetic process was proven to work, and could be built in stages that would immediately start producing fissile material. Groves cancelled the pilot plant on 14 November, in favor of proceeding immediately with the production plant.|$|E

40|$|Background: Complex dentitions {{and decline}} in {{adequate}} oral hygiene in elderly {{may lead to}} poor oral health. This may have impact on their general health, wellbeing and quality of life. With increased longevity, the problems <b>and</b> <b>needs</b> in oral health of community dwelling elderly lead to changes in oral health care <b>needs.</b> We identified <b>and</b> prioritized problems <b>and</b> <b>needs</b> in oral health of community dwelling elderly. Methods: The problems <b>and</b> <b>needs</b> in oral health of community dwelling elderly were elicited during focus groups and interviews. The list of problems <b>and</b> <b>needs</b> derived thereof was presented to 97 elderly who prioritized these. Results: Overall, older people appeared {{to be satisfied with}} their current oral health, and the maintenance and care for their oral health. Cost of care was identified as a major problem in general. There are differences in current perceived problems <b>and</b> <b>needs</b> <b>and</b> problems <b>and</b> <b>needs</b> anticipated for the future. Perceived current problems <b>and</b> <b>needs</b> concern dental care provision and knowledge on oral health of professionals and patients. For anticipated future problems <b>and</b> <b>needs</b> the importance of daily oral care by caregivers was prioritised, while emphasis was placed on fear of losing autonomy. Conclusion: It is important to take the perspectives and expectations of elderly into account in policy and planning of future oral health care practice, because these differ from the perspectives of dental professionals...|$|R

5|$|Not all gallstones {{implicated in}} {{ascending}} cholangitis actually originate from the gallbladder, but cholecystectomy (surgical {{removal of the}} gallbladder) is generally recommended in {{people who have been}} treated for cholangitis due to gallstone disease.

5|$|Once a neuron is in place, {{it extends}} {{dendrites}} and an axon {{into the area}} around it. Axons, because they commonly extend a great distance from the cell body <b>and</b> <b>need</b> to reach specific targets, grow in a particularly complex way. The tip of a growing axon consists of a blob of protoplasm called a growth cone, studded with chemical receptors. These receptors sense the local environment, causing the growth cone to be attracted or repelled by various cellular elements, and thus to be pulled in a particular direction at each point along its path. The result of this pathfinding process is that the growth cone navigates through the brain until it reaches its destination area, where other chemical cues cause it to begin generating synapses. Considering the entire brain, thousands of genes create products that influence axonal pathfinding.|$|E

5|$|Rodents {{including}} guinea pigs, mice, rats, hamsters, gerbils, chinchillas, degus and chipmunks make convenient pets {{able to live}} {{in small}} spaces, each species with its own qualities. Most are normally kept in cages of suitable sizes and have varied requirements for space and social interaction. If handled from a young age, they are usually docile and do not bite. Guinea pigs have a long lifespan <b>and</b> <b>need</b> a large cage. Rats also need plenty of space and can become very tame, can learn tricks and seem to enjoy human companionship. Mice are short-lived but take up very little space. Hamsters are solitary but tend to be nocturnal. They have interesting behaviors, but unless handled regularly they may be defensive. Gerbils are not usually aggressive, rarely bite and are sociable animals that enjoy the company of humans and their own kind.|$|E

5|$|Some insects, {{occupying the}} {{biological}} niches that they do, {{need to be}} incredibly maneuverable. They must find their food in tight spaces and be capable of escaping larger predators – or they may themselves be predators, <b>and</b> <b>need</b> to capture prey.
