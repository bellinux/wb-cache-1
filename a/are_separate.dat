5|$|In contrast, chords {{cannot be}} shifted around the {{fretboard}} in standard tuning, which requires four chord-shapes {{for the major}} chords: There <b>are</b> <b>separate</b> fingerings for chords having root notes {{on one of the}} four strings three–six.|$|E
5|$|Larger species often {{break up}} when stimulated, and the {{fragments}} often grow into full individuals. Some species fragment routinely and even parts near the tail can grow full bodies. All reproduce sexually, and most species are gonochoric (the sexes <b>are</b> <b>separate),</b> {{but all the}} freshwater forms are hermaphroditic.|$|E
50|$|Any {{two points}} which can <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> by a {{function}} can <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> by closed neighborhoods. If they can <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> by closed neighborhoods then clearly they can <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> by neighborhoods. It follows that every completely Hausdorff space is Urysohn and every Urysohn space is Hausdorff.|$|R

5|$|The 2007 {{version was}} {{announced}} September 12, 2006. A tabbed interface {{allows users to}} access the Norton Protection Center and the program settings without separate tray icons and windows open. Symantec revised Norton Internet Security and made this version more modularized, which has reduced the suite's memory usage to 10–15 megabytes and scan times by 30–35 percent. Another result is that spam filtering and parental controls <b>are</b> <b>separate</b> components to install. When installed, the features consume 100 MB of disk space.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature {{currently}} {{assesses the}} orca's conservation status as data deficient {{because of the}} likelihood that two or more killer whale types <b>are</b> <b>separate</b> species. Some local populations are considered threatened or endangered due to prey depletion, habitat loss, pollution (by PCBs), capture for marine mammal parks, and conflicts with human fisheries. In late 2005, the Southern Resident Killer Whales, the population that inhabits British Columbia and Washington state waters, {{were placed on the}} U.S. Endangered Species list.|$|E
5|$|The key {{activities}} of cultivated plant taxonomy relate to classification (taxonomy) and naming (nomenclature). The rules associated with naming plants <b>are</b> <b>separate</b> from the methods, principles or purposes of classification, {{except that the}} units of classification, the taxa, are placed in a nested hierarchy of ranks – like species within genera, and genera within families. There are three classification categories used in the Cultivated Plant Code, the cultivar and the Group and the grex, but they are only loosely equivalent to ranks in the Botanical Code.|$|E

5|$|Typically, the labial palpi are prominent, three-segmented, {{springing}} {{from under}} the head and curving {{up in front of}} the face. There is great variation in morphology of labial palpi in different families of Lepidoptera; sometimes the palpi <b>are</b> <b>separate</b> and sometimes they are connivent and form a beak, but they are always independently movable. In other cases, the labial palpi may not be erect but porrect (projecting forward horizontally).|$|E
5|$|U.S. Route 50 (US-50) in Utah {{crosses the}} center of the state. The highway serves no major {{population}} centers in Utah, with the largest city along its path being Delta. Most of the route passes through desolate, remote areas. Through the eastern half of the state the route is concurrent with Interstate 70 (I-70). US-50 both enters and exits Utah concurrent with US-6, however the two routes <b>are</b> <b>separate</b> through {{the center of}} the state.|$|E
5|$|Varsity Scouting {{is part of}} the Boy Scouting {{division}} of the BSA. It is an alternative available to boys ages fourteen through seventeen that takes basic Boy Scouting and adds high adventure, sporting, and other elements that are more appealing to older youth to accomplish the aims of character development, citizenship training, and personal fitness. Varsity Scouts are organized into teams, which <b>are</b> <b>separate</b> chartered units from a Boy Scout troop. Varsity Scouts participate in the standard Boy Scouting advancement program along with programs unique to Varsity Scouting.|$|E

5|$|While the pupa is {{generally}} stationary and immobile, {{those of the}} primitive moth families Micropterigidae, Agathiphagidae and Heterobathmiidae have fully functional mandibles. These serve principally to allow the adult {{to escape from the}} cocoon. Besides this, all appendages and the body <b>are</b> <b>separate</b> from the pupal skin and enjoy a degree of independent motion. All other superfamilies of the Lepidoptera are more specialised, have non-functional mandibles, appendages and body attached to the pupal skin, and lose a degree of independent movement.|$|E
5|$|After leaving Sag Harbor, NY114 {{encounters}} a modern roundabout {{at the intersection}} of Short Beach Road (County Route60 or CR60) and Tyndall Road. NY114 makes a turn through the roundabout and then travels one more mile through North Haven before reaching the first of two ferries along its route. Shelter Island's two ferries, both of which technically carry NY114, are operated by two different companies. The South Ferry (between North Haven and Shelter Island) is operated by the South Ferry Company and the North Ferry (between Shelter Island Heights and Greenport) is operated by the North Ferry Company. Since the two entities <b>are</b> <b>separate,</b> there is no incentive to use both ferries, although both companies offer discounts for round trip fares and for Shelter Island residents.|$|E
5|$|Burger King's supply {{contracts}} for non-carbonated beverages <b>are</b> <b>separate</b> {{from the ones}} for its sodas. When the company first chose to introduce a bottled water product, it chose Nestlé's Poland Spring brand over Coke's Dasani. When the contract expired in 2003, BK moved to Pepsi's Aquafina, the top-selling brand at the time. In 2008 Burger King renewed its relationship with Nestlé by entering into an agreement to sell Pure Life bottled water products. BK moved away from Pepsi's Tropicana brand juices in 2001 when it went with Coca-Cola's Minute Maid brands for the North America market. With the introduction of its Positive Steps nutrition program for children, the company turned to the Hershey Company to provide Hershey's branded low-fat milk in its North American stores. BK is utilizing a popular brand name to promote its products in a move to draw customers' attention to itself and its meal programs.|$|E

5|$|Camping is {{available}} at local recreational vehicle parks (RV parks), including Carl Precht Memorial RV Park, Sunset Lakes RV Park (adjacent to Duck Lake), and Margie's R.V. Park. There are over a half-dozen campgrounds in proximity to Omak. The Omak–Okanogan region has been well known for its rock climbing structures since the early 1970s. Nearby communities in Okanogan County offer horseback riding and hunting. Fishing and boating is achievable within short distance, at the nearby Omak Lake. The Omak Pioneers represent Omak High School as their baseball, basketball, football, soccer, volleyball, and wrestling teams. There <b>are</b> <b>separate</b> teams based on age and gender. There are all-terrain vehicle (ATV) courses located nearby, specifically in the Loup Loup Ski Bowl.|$|E
5|$|Each season {{consists}} of 12 to 18 Grands Prix contested on closed circuits, {{as opposed to}} public roads. Points earned in these events count toward the drivers' and constructors' world championships. The driver's and constructor's championship <b>are</b> <b>separate</b> championships, but {{are based on the}} same point system. The number of points awarded {{at the end of each}} race to the top 15 qualifying riders depends on their placement. Points received by each finisher, from first 1st place to 15th place: 25, 20, 16, 13, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Historically, there have been several points systems. Results from all current Grands Prix count towards the championships; in the past, only a certain number of results were counted.|$|E
5|$|Each season {{normally}} {{consists of}} 12 to 16 rallies driven on surfaces ranging from gravel and tarmac to snow and ice. Points from these events are calculated towards the drivers' and manufacturers' world championships. The driver's championship and manufacturer's championship <b>are</b> <b>separate</b> championships, but {{are based on}} the same point system. In the current points system, points are awarded {{at the end of each}} rally to the top ten WRC (overall), junior and production car drivers that qualify as follows: 25, 18, 15, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, 1. Despite how many drivers are in one team, constructors can only nominate two drivers to score points for the team as well as scoring for themselves.|$|E
