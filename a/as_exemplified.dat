5|$|Parthian art can {{be divided}} into three geo-historical phases: the art of Parthia proper; the art of the Iranian plateau; and the art of Parthian Mesopotamia. The first genuine Parthian art, found at Mithridatkert/Nisa, {{combined}} elements of Greek and Iranian art in line with Achaemenid and Seleucid traditions. In the second phase, Parthian art found inspiration in Achaemenid art, <b>as</b> <b>exemplified</b> by the investiture relief of Mithridates II at Mount Behistun. The third phase occurred gradually after the Parthian conquest of Mesopotamia.|$|E

5|$|The {{charting}} and {{conquest of}} this new world made real regions previously only idealised in the imagination of artists and poets. At the same time, the certainty of the old biblical paradise began to slip from the grasp of thinkers into the realms of mythology. In response, treatment of the Paradise in literature, poetry and art shifted towards a self-consciously fictional Utopian representation, <b>as</b> <b>exemplified</b> by the writings of Thomas More (1478–1535).|$|E
5|$|The second season, {{along with}} its ongoing {{examination}} of the drug problem {{and its effect on}} the urban poor, examines the plight of the blue-collar urban working class <b>as</b> <b>exemplified</b> by stevedores in the city port, as some of them get caught up in smuggling drugs and other contraband inside the shipping containers that pass through their port. In a season-long subplot, the Barksdale organization continues its drug trafficking despite Avon's imprisonment, with Stringer Bell assuming greater power.|$|E
5|$|At least 200 people fell or {{jumped to}} their deaths from the burning towers (<b>as</b> <b>exemplified</b> in the {{photograph}} The Falling Man), landing {{on the streets and}} rooftops of adjacent buildings hundreds of feet below. Some occupants of each tower above the point of impact made their way toward the roof in hope of helicopter rescue, but the roof access doors were locked. No plan existed for helicopter rescues, and the combination of roof equipment and thick smoke and intense heat prevented helicopters from approaching.|$|E

5|$|Bold {{experiments}} in cinematic storytelling were sometimes attempted during the classic era: Lady in the Lake, for example, is shot entirely {{from the point}} of view of protagonist Philip Marlowe; the face of star (and director) Robert Montgomery is seen only in mirrors. The Chase (1946) takes oneirism and fatalism as the basis for its fantastical narrative system, redolent of certain horror stories, but with little precedent in the context of a putatively realistic genre. In their different ways, both Sunset Boulevard and D.O.A. are tales told by dead men. Latter-day noir has been in the forefront of structural experimentation in popular cinema, <b>as</b> <b>exemplified</b> by such films as Pulp Fiction, Fight Club, and Memento.|$|E
5|$|Estañol's views {{represented}} {{those of}} {{the portion of the}} upper class which was willing {{to come to terms with}} at least a portion of the middle class in order to crush the peasant uprisings, <b>as</b> <b>exemplified</b> by those of Zapata, which were erupting throughout Mexico. Limantour, who broadly agreed with Estañol, had the support of the Mexican financiers, who feared the downgrading of Mexican international credit and a general economic crisis as a result of ongoing social unrest, as well as that of the large landowners who were willing to come to terms with Madero if it would put an end to the agrarian uprisings.|$|E
5|$|However, it did {{not take}} long for Fàbregas {{to become one of the}} most coveted and celebrated young talents in the game with his success at Arsenal. Functioning mostly as a playmaker and renowned for his passing range, he was {{described}} as the general of Arsenal's first team, bringing vision, creativity, and an innate understanding of timing and space to Arsenal's intricate passing game, displaying maturity that belied his age. He was the main creative force when he was at Arsenal, <b>as</b> <b>exemplified</b> by his 16 assists in all competitions in the 2006–07 season. Between 2006–07 and 2010–11, Fàbregas created the most chances in the top-division leagues of England, Spain, Italy, Germany and France.|$|E

5|$|The Saskatchewan Métis' {{requested}} land grants {{were all}} {{provided by the}} government {{by the end of}} 1887, and the government resurveyed the Métis river lots in accordance with their wishes. The Métis did not understand the long term value of their new land, however, and it was soon bought by speculators who later turned huge profits from it. Riel's worst fears were realised—following the failed rebellion, the French language and Roman Catholic religion faced increasing marginalisation in both Saskatchewan and Manitoba, <b>as</b> <b>exemplified</b> by the controversy surrounding the Manitoba Schools Question. The Métis themselves were increasingly forced to live on undesirable land or in the shadow of Indian reserves (as they did not themselves have treaty status). Saskatchewan did not attain provincehood until 1905.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode is}} {{read in a}} radically {{different}} way by Walter Goffart. According to him, the whole story assumes an allegorical meaning, with Paul intent on telling an edifying story of {{the downfall of the}} hero and his expulsion from the promised land, because of his human weakness. In this story, the skull cup plays a key role as it unites original sin and barbarism. Goffart does not exclude the possibility that Paul had really seen the skull, but believes that by the 740s the connection between sin and barbarism <b>as</b> <b>exemplified</b> by the skull cup had already been established.|$|E
5|$|The {{ethos of}} the {{aristocracy}} <b>as</b> <b>exemplified</b> in the English public school greatly influenced Pierre de Coubertin. The public schools subscribed {{to the belief}} that sport formed an important part of education, an attitude summed up in the saying mens sana in corpore sano, a sound mind in a sound body. In this ethos, a gentleman was one who became an all-rounder, not the best at one specific thing. There was also a prevailing concept of fairness, in which practising or training was considered tantamount to cheating. Those who practised a sport professionally were considered to have an unfair advantage over those who practised it merely as a hobby.|$|E

5|$|While {{still an}} undergraduate, Stanford was {{appointed}} organist of Trinity College, Cambridge. In 1882, aged 29, {{he was one}} of the founding professors of the Royal College of Music, where he taught composition for the rest of his life. From 1887 he was also Professor of Music at Cambridge. As a teacher, Stanford was sceptical about modernism, and based his instruction chiefly on classical principles <b>as</b> <b>exemplified</b> in the music of Brahms. Among his pupils were rising composers whose fame went on to surpass his own, such as Gustav Holst and Ralph Vaughan Williams. As a conductor, Stanford held posts with the Bach Choir and the Leeds triennial music festival.|$|E
5|$|Athletes have {{historically}} been willing to take legal and health risks to improve their performance, with some even stating their willingness to risk their lives, <b>as</b> <b>exemplified</b> by research by Mirkin, Goldman and Connor in researching attitudes to the so-called Goldman dilemma. To prevent use of performance-enhancing substances, athletes must submit to drug tests that are conducted {{both in and out}} of competition by anti-doping officials or accredited medical staff. Penalized athletes are susceptible to higher testing upon return to competition. Athletes found to have taken substances on the World Anti-Doping Agency's banned list receive sanctions and may be banned from competition for a period of time that corresponds to the seriousness of the infraction. However, the use of substances not on the prohibited list may also result in sanctions if the substance is deemed similar to a banned substance in either composition or effect. Athletes may also be sanctioned for missing tests, seeking to avoid testing or tampering with results, refusing to submit to testing, through circumstantial evidence, or confession of use.|$|E
5|$|Early Baroque organ {{music in}} Germany was highly contrapuntal. Sacred organ music {{was based on}} chorales: composers such as Samuel Scheidt and Heinrich Scheidemann wrote chorale preludes, chorale fantasias, and chorale motets. Towards {{the end of the}} Baroque era, the chorale prelude and the partita became mixed, forming the chorale partita. This genre was {{developed}} by Georg Böhm, Johann Pachelbel, and Dieterich Buxtehude. The primary type of free-form piece in this period was the praeludium, <b>as</b> <b>exemplified</b> in the works of Matthias Weckmann, Nicolaus Bruhns, Böhm, and Buxtehude. The organ music of Johann Sebastian Bach fused characteristics of every national tradition and historical style in his large-scale preludes and fugues and chorale-based works. Towards the end of the Baroque era, George Frideric Handel composed the first organ concertos.|$|E

5|$|Inscriptions {{and other}} {{literary}} records indicate the Rashtrakutas selected {{the crown prince}} based on heredity. The crown did not always pass on to the eldest son. Abilities were considered more important than age and chronology of birth, <b>as</b> <b>exemplified</b> by the crowning of Govinda III who was the third son of king Dhruva Dharavarsha. The most important position under the king was the Chief Minister (Mahasandhivigrahi) whose position came with five insignia commensurate with his position namely, a flag, a conch, a fan, a white umbrella, a large drum and five musical instruments called Panchamahashabdas. Under him was the commander (Dandanayaka), the foreign minister (Mahakshapataladhikrita) and a prime minister (Mahamatya or Purnamathya), {{all of whom were}} usually associated with one of the feudatory kings and must have held a position in government equivalent to a premier. A Mahasamantha was a feudatory or higher ranking regal officer. All cabinet ministers were well versed in political science (Rajneeti) and possessed military training. There were cases where women supervised significant areas as when Revakanimaddi, daughter of Amoghavarsha I, administered Edathore Vishaya.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of the masing molecule, {{there are}} a few {{requirements}} that must be met for a strong maser source to exist. One requirement is a radio continuum background source to provide the radiation amplified by the maser, as all maser transitions take place at radio wavelengths. The masing molecule must have a pumping mechanism to create the population inversion, and sufficient density and path length for significant amplification to take place. These combine to constrain when and where megamaser emission for a given molecule will take place. The specific conditions for each molecule known to produce megamasers are different, <b>as</b> <b>exemplified</b> by {{the fact that there is}} no known galaxy that hosts both of the two most common megamaser species, hydroxyl and water. As such, the different molecules with known megamasers will be addressed individually.|$|E

Ron believes the park system should be privatized and run entirely by corporations for profit, <b>as</b> <b>exemplified</b> by the business model of the Chuck E. Cheese's chain of family entertainment centers. He advocates for program cuts wherever possible, and purposely tries to hire people who are bad at their jobs so they will slow down the government.
