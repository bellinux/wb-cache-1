While the British degree accreditation and classification system {{allows students to}} go straight from a three-year bachelor's degree onto a master's degree (normally requiring a 1st or a 2:1 - those with a 2:2 or a 3rd usually require <b>appropriate</b> <b>professional</b> <b>experience),</b> South Africa does not do so unless the student has proven research capabilities. South African Honours degrees prepare the students to undertake a research-specific degree (in terms of master's), by spending an in-depth year (up to 5 modules) creating research proposals and undertaking a research project of limited scope. This prepares students for the research degrees later in their academic career.|$|E

40|$|To {{obtain a}} better {{understanding}} of WIL rationale and practices in Australian ICT degrees, a survey of managers and educational leaders of ICT was undertaken. These survey results were analysed and informed by discussions at a forum of ICT educational leaders. Results indicate that WIL practices are broad {{with a wide range of}} internal (university) and external (industry) combinations to provide the student with <b>appropriate</b> <b>professional</b> <b>experience.</b> The majority of respondents indicated that their curricula are industry relevant, and that they offer an industry-linked final year project. Virtual or simulated work experiences also seem to be commonly practiced. The range of options is influenced by local context, staff approaches and resource availability. The majority of universities regard WIL as important and beneficial and apparently have practices that provide for industry contribution to the curriculum even though this may not be obvious to graduates in the workplace. Support provided to students for an industry placement is variable. Success measures of placements are that students have improved understanding of professional responsibility and have gained a variety of work perspectives. That the student is employable as a consequence is not seen as very important. There appears to be a tension between desired outcomes from academia and industry including those of 'work readiness' and lifelong learning. It seems that the range of options provided by universities need to be recognised by all stakeholders as contributing to the development of an ICT Professional...|$|E
40|$|Self-reflection is an {{integral}} part of student?s training, including practical training. Self-reflection can be seen as a professional development and also as a development of personality. The aim was to characterize the reflection of social work students within the linking theory and professional practice. In the theoretical part of this diploma, author focuses on the concept of self-reflection, reflection and self-knowledge. Author also briefly describes social work, skills required for the performance of social work and the importance of <b>appropriate</b> <b>professional</b> <b>experience.</b> Author deals with how theoretical knowledge and practical experience can be connected and how personal experience can be reflected. In subsequent chapters is described supervision as one of its goals is self-reflection. The focus is mainly on auto-supervision and development supervision. In the last chapter author tries to outline the impact of ethics, rules and their dilemmas that affect social work. In the research part is set the main objective: "To characterize the reflection of social work students within the linking theory and professional practice. " Author also sets two partial objectives: "To determine the nature of reflection of social work students in relation to the length of study. " And: "To identify the extent of students' use of reflection during their professional practice. " To fulfill the objectives method of qualitative research technique with half standardized interview was chosen. The interview had structure of broadly worded questions that pointed to the knowledge of the problem. The research group consists of students of the Faculty of Health and Social Studies who completed Bachelor and subsequent Master study in the discipline of Rehabilitation ? psychosocial care for handicapped children, adults and seniors. The character of reflection in relation to length of study and level of use of reflection is defined in the proposed hypotheses. The gained finding can be used to improve students' self-reflection and the development of social work professional practice...|$|E
40|$|A {{modern and}} {{efficient}} corporate governance framework for European undertakings, investors and employees must {{be adapted to}} the needs of today’s society and to the changing economic environment. High performing, effective boards are needed to challenge executive management. This means that boards need independent non-executive members with diverse views, skills and <b>appropriate</b> <b>professional</b> <b>experience.</b> Such members must also be willing to invest sufficient time {{in the work of the}} board. The article addresses the following subjects which are at the heart of good corporate governance: Comply or explain approach: The ‘comply or explain’ principle is an important tool for the application of the corporate governance rules in the EU. Most corporate governance is soft law and guidelines are included in voluntary national codes of conduct. In principle, member countries decide upon what type of legal instrument to use, in the respective field: mandatory or ‘comply or explain’. Board of directors, structure and composition: There is no uniform approach as regard structure of corporate governance. As generally known, there are two basic concepts of the public limited (joint stock) companies 2 ̆ 7 corporate governance structures: one and two tier system. In EU, different board structures coexist. Depending on the country, listed companies may put in place either a ‘single board’ system (also called ‘monistic’ or ‘unitary board’ system), a two-tier (or ‘dual board’) system or some form of mixed system. Non-executive or supervisory directors: The administrative, managerial and supervisory bodies should include an appropriate balance of executive (managing) and non -executive (supervisory) directors such that no individual or small group of individuals can dominate decision-making on the part of these bodies. A sufficient number of independent non -executive or supervisory directors should be elected to the (supervisory) board of companies to ensure that any material conflict of interest involving directors will be properly dealt with. Independent directors: A director should be considered to be independent only if he is free of any business, family or other relationship, with the company, its controlling shareholder or the management of either, that creates a conflict of interest such as to impair his judgement. duties is assured (Annex II, which identifies a number of situations reflecting the relationships or circumstances usually recognised as likely to generate material conflict of interest). Boards should be organised in such a way that a sufficient number of independent non-executive or supervisory directors play an effective role in key areas where the potential for conflict of interest is particularly high. Board committees: Nomination, remuneration and audit committees should be created. The nomination, remuneration and audit committees should make recommendations aimed at preparing the decisions to be taken by the (supervisory) board itself. The primary purpose of the committees should be to increase the efficiency of the (supervisory) board by making sure that decisions are based on due consideration, and to help organise its work with a view to ensuring that the decisions it takes are free of material conflicts of interest...|$|E
