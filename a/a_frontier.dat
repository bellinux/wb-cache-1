5|$|By the 1850s, Indiana had {{undergone}} major changes: {{what was once}} <b>a</b> <b>frontier</b> with sparse population had become a developing state with several cities. In 1816, Indiana's population was around 65,000, and in less than 50 years, it had increased to more than 1,000,000 inhabitants.|$|E

5|$|La Blanca {{occupied}} <b>a</b> <b>frontier</b> zone {{between the}} northeastern and southeastern Petén regions {{and the site}} {{is dominated by the}} acropolis, an especially well built palace complex. The city appears to have been an administrative centre with comparatively little emphasis upon religious or ceremonial activity. It is likely that La Blanca was a subsidiary of a major Maya city such as Yaxha or Naranjo, given the complete absence of hieroglyphic texts and sculpted monuments, and archaeologists presume that La Blanca served as <b>a</b> <b>frontier</b> post or trading centre.|$|E

5|$|Gil González Dávila and Andrés Niño first {{explored}} {{the coast of}} El Salvador in 1522 as they sailed northwest along the Pacific coast of Central America from Panama, and briefly landed in the Bay of Fonseca.

5|$|The city, {{which began}} as <b>a</b> <b>frontier</b> town, has several {{historical}} attractions. The Lethbridge Viaduct, {{commonly known as}} the High Level Bridge, is the longest and highest steel trestle bridge in North America. It was completed in 1909 on what was then the city's western edge. Indian Battle Park, in the coulees of the Oldman River, commemorates the last battle between the Cree and the Blackfoot First Nations in 1870.|$|E
5|$|This is {{the period}} from the late 7th century (for most of Somerset) to 1066, though {{for part of the}} 10th and 11th centuries England was under Danish control. Somerset, like Dorset to the south, held the West Saxon advance from Wiltshire/Hampshire back for over a century, {{remaining}} <b>a</b> <b>frontier</b> between the Saxons and the Romano-British Celts.|$|E
5|$|Around 260 AD, {{the fall}} of the Agri Decumates {{territory}} north of the Rhine transformed today's Switzerland into <b>a</b> <b>frontier</b> land of the Empire. Repeated raids by the Alamanni tribes provoked the ruin of the Roman towns and economy, forcing the population to find shelter near Roman fortresses, like the Castrum Rauracense near Augusta Raurica. The Empire built another line of defence at the north border (the so-called Donau-Iller-Rhine-Limes), {{but at the end of}} the fourth century the increased Germanic pressure forced the Romans to abandon the linear defence concept, and the Swiss plateau was finally open to the settlement of Germanic tribes.|$|E

5|$|Britain annexed the Voortrekkers' {{short-lived}} Natalia Republic in 1843 as the Colony of Natal. Pretorius briefly led Boer {{resistance to}} this, but before long {{most of the}} Boers in Natal had trekked back north-west to {{the area around the}} Orange and Vaal Rivers. In 1845 Kruger was a member of Potgieter's expedition to Delagoa Bay in Mozambique to negotiate <b>a</b> <b>frontier</b> with Portugal; the Lebombo Mountains were settled upon as the border between Boer and Portuguese lands. After Maria and their first child died of fever in January 1846, Kruger married her cousin Gezina du Plessis, from the Colesberg area, in 1847. Their first child, Casper Jan Hendrik, was born on 22 December that year.|$|E
5|$|By 1851, {{treaties}} between Native American {{tribes and}} the U.S. government had opened much of Minnesota to U.S. settlement. Fort Snelling {{was no longer}} <b>a</b> <b>frontier</b> outpost. Efforts to establish Minnesota as a prominent future state in the Union were swift. In 1851 territorial legislature petitioned the U.S. Congress for land to build a railroad between Milwaukee, Wisconsin and Saint Paul. That same year the legislature incorporated the University of Minnesota and established its endowment (though the University would not admit students until many years later).|$|E
5|$|Following the {{discovery}} of iron ore deposits {{in the north of}} Sweden, Lappland became <b>a</b> <b>frontier</b> for industrial development, instead of an exotic wilderness of the Sami culture and midnight sun. Opportunistically, Carl Adam Victor Lundholm published his Lappland, det stora svenska framtidslandet (Lappland, the great Swedish land of the future). He engaged noted Swedish artists—such as Karl Tirén, Alfred Thörne, Per Daniel Holm and Hjalmar Lindberg—to create the illustrations. Since Bauer was an inexperienced illustrator by comparison, Lundholm tested his abilities by sending him to create some drawings of Sami people at Skansen.|$|E

5|$|Harrison {{had many}} {{friends in the}} eastern aristocracy, and quickly gained a {{reputation}} among them as <b>a</b> <b>frontier</b> leader. He ran a successful horse-breeding enterprise that won him acclaim throughout the Northwest Territory. Harrison became a champion of lower land prices, a primary concern of settlers in the Territory at the time. The U.S. Congress had legislated a territorial land policy that led to high land costs, which many of the territory's residents disliked. In October 1799, after it had been determined that the Northwest Territory's population had reached a sufficient number to have a delegate in the U.S. Congress, Harrison ran for election. He campaigned to encourage further migration to the territory, which eventually led to statehood.|$|E

A new legend is included, wherein Krishna laments in uncontrollable sorrow when his son dies, and a Ghatapandita feigns madness to teach Krishna a lesson. The Jataka tale also includes an internecine destruction among his siblings after they all get drunk. Krishna also dies in the Buddhist legend by {{the hand of a}} hunter named Jara, but while he is traveling to <b>a</b> <b>frontier</b> city.
