25|$|Polio {{vaccination}} {{efforts have}} also faced resistance in another form. The priority placed on vaccination by national authorities has {{turned it into}} a bargaining chip, with communities and interest groups resisting vaccination, not due to direct opposition, but to leverage other concessions from governmental authorities. In Nigeria this has taken the form of 'block rejection' of vaccination, which is only resolved when state officials agree to repair or improve schools <b>and</b> <b>health-care</b> facilities, pave roads or install electricity. There have been several instances of threatened boycotts by health workers in Pakistan over payment disputes.|$|E

40|$|Current {{research}} and policy on maternal <b>and</b> child <b>health-care</b> in Eritrea <b>and</b> Ethiopia focus primarily on female education and employment, while little attention is placed on women’s decision-making autonomy. However, the role of women’s decision-making in reproductive health cannot be overemphasized. In this paper, different dimensions of women’s decision-making autonomy {{and their relationship to}} maternal <b>and</b> child <b>health-care</b> utilization are investigated using data from the Demographic and Health Surveys of Ethiopia and Eritrea. We simultaneously consider the role of socio-economic (indirect) indicators of women’s status. The study shows that most autonomy indicators are important predictors of maternal <b>and</b> child <b>health-care</b> utilization although the strength and statistical significance vary by <b>health-care</b> utilization outcome <b>and</b> country, and in some cases significance is lost when socio-economic indicators are held constant. The strong positive effect of women’s sole decision-making in visiting family or relatives on use of antenatal care and child immunization is particularly impressive. On the other hand, the loss of significance of other dimensions of women’s decision-making when socio-economic factors are controlled for indicates that some health-care seeking behaviours are more dependent on socio-economic factors like education and employment. The results show that most socio-economic indicators have strong influence on both women’s decision-making autonomy and on maternal <b>and</b> child <b>health-care</b> utilization. These findings suggest that both women’s autonomy and socio-economic indicators should be analyzed in order to derive a complete understanding of the determinants of maternal <b>and</b> child <b>health-care</b> utilization.

25|$|The FDA has {{classified}} the HPV vaccine as {{a pregnancy}} Category B, meaning {{there is no}} apparent harm to the fetus in animal studies. HPV vaccines have not been causally related with adverse pregnancy outcomes or adverse effects on the fetus. However, data on vaccination during pregnancy is very limited and vaccination during the pregnancy term should be delayed until more information is available. If a woman {{is found to be}} pregnant during the three-dose series of vaccination, the series will be postponed until pregnancy has been completed. While there is no indication for intervention for vaccine dosages administered during pregnancy, patients <b>and</b> <b>health-care</b> providers are encouraged to report exposure to vaccines to the appropriate HPV vaccine pregnancy registry.|$|E
25|$|As the Constitutional Convention {{concluded}} {{its work}} on the amendment, some politicians announced plans to make the November 2004 elections a referendum on same-sex marriage. In Vermont following the enactment of civil unions legislation in 2000, {{a large group of}} its supporters had been defeated. One political action committee announced plans to target legislative candidates who supported same-sex marriage, eight Republicans and two independents. Ronald Crews of the Massachusetts Family Institute estimated a possible shift of 10 to 15 seats against same-sex marriage. The elections resulted in shifts that consistently favored supporters of same-sex marriage rights. Carl Sciortino, a gay activist and first-time candidate, drew support from supporters of same-sex marriage, but ran largely on traditional issues like education, taxation, <b>and</b> <b>health-care,</b> and narrowly defeated a 16-year veteran and same-sex marriage opponent in the Democratic primary on September 14. Later that month, Speaker of the House Finneran resigned from the legislature to be replaced by Sal DiMasi, who backed same-sex marriage. Some candidates who backed a constitutional amendment did not make same-sex marriage a campaign issue as anticipated, but it proved critical in a few races. All 50 incumbents who opposed a constitutional amendment and faced challengers won re-election. Four supporters of Goodridge retired and successors with similar views replaced them. Five opponents of Goodridge retired and three of their successors were supporters of same-sex marriage. In special elections in the spring of 2005, three incumbents who supported a constitutional amendment lost to supporters of same-sex marriage.|$|E

500|$|Offshore of Malaysia, two U.S. Navy {{ships in}} Vamei's eyewall were damaged by strong winds. Upon moving ashore, the storm brought storm surge damage to {{portions}} of southeastern Peninsular Malaysia. Vamei brought strong winds and heavy rainfall to portions of Melaka, Negeri Sembilan, and Selangor {{as well as}} to Johor, where rainfall reached over 200mm (8in) in Senai. Additionally, monsoonal moisture, influenced by the storm, produced moderate to heavy precipitation across various regions of peninsular Malaysia. The passage of the cyclone resulted in flooding and mudslides, which forced the evacuation of more than 13,195people in Johor and Pahang states into 69shelters. Along Gunung Pulai, the rainfall caused a landslide which destroyed four houses and killed five people. River flooding was also reported, {{as a result of the}} precipitation from Vamei as well as previous rainfall. Damage from the flooding was estimated at RM13.7million (2001MYR, $3.6million 2001USD). About 40percent of the damage occurred to crops at a farm in Kota Tinggi. Moderate damage to transportation, education, <b>and</b> <b>health-care</b> facilities was also reported. The Malaysian government provided affected families up to RM5,000 (2001MYR, $1,300 2001USD) in assistance for food, clothing, and repairs.

2500|$|Though {{the effect}} of the Cultural Revolution was {{disastrous}} for millions of people in China, there were positive outcomes for some sections of the population, such as those in the rural areas. [...] For example, the upheavals of the Cultural Revolution and the hostility to the intellectual elite is widely accepted to have damaged the quality of education in China, especially at the upper end of education system. [...] However, the radical policies also provided many in the rural communities with middle school education for the first time, which is thought to have facilitated the rural economic development in the 70s and 80s. [...] Similarly, a large number of health personnel were deployed to the countryside as barefoot doctors during the Cultural Revolution. Some farmers were given informal medical training, <b>and</b> <b>health-care</b> centers were established in rural communities.

2500|$|Like {{many other}} Royal consorts, the young Queen {{initially}} limited {{herself to a}} ceremonial role. In 1961 {{during a visit to}} France, the Francophile Farah befriended the French culture minister André Malraux, leading her to arrange the exchange of cultural artifacts between French and Iranian art galleries and museums, a lively trade that continued until the Islamic revolution of 1979. Farah and Mohammad Reza usually spoke French rather than Farsi to their children. She spent much of her time attending the openings of various education <b>and</b> <b>health-care</b> institutions without venturing too deeply into controversial issues. [...] However, as time progressed, this position changed. The Queen became much more actively involved in government affairs where it concerned issues and causes that interested her. [...] She used her proximity and influence with her husband, the Shah, to secure funding and focus attention on causes, particularly in the areas of women's rights and cultural development. Farah's concerns were the [...] "realms of education, health, culture and social matters" [...] with politics being excluded from her purview. However, Mohammad Reza's politically powerful twin sister Princess Ashraf came to see Farah as a rival. It was the rivalry with Princess Ashraf that led Farah to press her husband into reducing her influence at the Court.|$|E
2500|$|Disrupted {{healthcare}} sectors is a {{term the}} World Health Organization describes for medical facilities that are destroyed or partially destroyed in war torn areas. Health care facilities are essential {{for the establishment of}} support systems for rape victims. Psychological support units are also hampered by the lack of material resources available to the medical community on-ground. Medical practitioners <b>and</b> <b>health-care</b> workers face daunting challenges in conflict and post-conflict area. As the WHO explains, [...] "healthcare delivery fragments and deteriorates, memory and knowledge are eroded, and power disperses". War-torn societies in immediate post-conflict zones have broken medical infrastructure such as: destroyed or partially destroyed hospitals (or clinics); non-functioning hospitals; poor, scarce or inadequate medical supplies, lack of running water, and scarce or lack of electricity. Dismantling weapons from armed rebels and other groups are prioritized in immediate post-conflict situations which in effect de-prioritizes the immediate physical and psychiatric care that war rape victims are in urgent need of. [...] "If {{we do not have the}} capacity to prevent war, we have a collective responsibility to better understand and treat its psychiatric, medical, and social consequences." [...] Access to phycological health services further causes inequity for survivors of war rape who are at the margins of society living in chronic poverty or located in rural regions. Healthcare and psychiatric care is a key component to the healing processes of war rape.|$|E
