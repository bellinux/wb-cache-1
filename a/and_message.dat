5|$|Japanese radio {{intercepts}} did notice {{an increase}} in both American submarine activity <b>and</b> <b>message</b> traffic. This information was in Yamamoto's hands prior to the battle. Japanese plans, however, were not changed: Yamamoto, at sea in , assumed Nagumo had received the same signal from Tokyo, and did not communicate with him by radio, {{so as not to}} reveal his position. These messages were, contrary to earlier historical accounts, also received by Nagumo before the battle began. For reasons which remain unclear, Nagumo did not alter his plans or take additional precautions.|$|E

5|$|The album's {{songs are}} characterised by metronomic pop, vocal harmonies, hand claps, {{prominent}} electric guitar riffs, bright synthesizers, a homogeneous sound <b>and</b> <b>message,</b> and rotations of lead vocals. The members' voices are presented individually on the record, and its lyricism speaks of falling in love, unrequited love, the insistence that flaws are what {{make a person}} unique, commitment, jealousy, and longing for past significant others. Take Me Home garnered mostly positive reviews from music critics. There was praise for its quality of production, while criticism hinged on its generic, rushed nature.|$|E
5|$|Aquino's Book of Coming Forth by Night makes {{reference}} to The Book of the Law, a similarly 'revealed' text {{produced by the}} occultist Aleister Crowley in 1904 which {{provided the basis for}} Crowley's religion of Thelema. In Aquino's book, The Book of the Law was presented as a genuine spiritual text given to Crowley by preternatural sources, but it was also declared that Crowley had misunderstood both its origin <b>and</b> <b>message.</b> In making {{reference to}} The Book of the Law, Aquino presented himself as being as much Crowley's heir as LaVey's, and Aquino's work would engage with Crowley's writings and beliefs to a far greater extent than LaVey ever did.|$|E
5|$|Electric Music for the Mind and Body was {{released}} on May 11, 1967. Much of the album's material continued to expand upon the band's new psychedelic medium, with it embracing all facets of the members' influences, which ranged from their folk roots, blues, raga rock and hard rock. The album also saw Cohen coming forward in a larger role with inventive distorted-organ melodies. In addition, McDonald's lyrical content, which brazenly pronounced topics of political protest, recreational drug use, and love, augmented by satirical humor, clearly introduced the band's orientation <b>and</b> <b>message.</b> The compositional structures followed discrete movement patterns emulating the style of John Fahey, whom McDonald admired. Though Electric Music for the Mind and Body {{was among the most}} complex works to date, it possessed the quality that several other San Francisco acts shared of being recorded mostly live, with only the vocals being overdubbed after the instrumentals were completed.|$|E

However, {{support for the}} integration of object <b>and</b> <b>messaging</b> services, in particular for transaction processing across object <b>and</b> <b>messaging</b> components, is very limited. In this paper, we introduce the concept of Dependency-Spheres (D-Spheres), a global transaction context for distributed objects <b>and</b> <b>messages.</b> A D-Sphere integrates standard distributed object transactions <b>and</b> conditional asynchronous <b>messages</b> in one single unit-of-work.

5|$|The Azusa Street Revival was a {{historic}} revival meeting {{that took place}} in Los Angeles, California, and is the origin of the Pentecostal movement. Neely Terry, an African American woman who attended a small holiness church pastored by Julia Hutchins in Los Angeles, made a trip to visit family in Houston late in 1905. While in Houston, she visited Seymour's church, where he preached on receiving the Holy Spirit with the evidence of speaking in other tongues, and though he had not experienced this personally, Terry was impressed with his character <b>and</b> <b>message.</b> Once home in California, Terry suggested that Seymour be invited to speak at the local church. Seymour received and accepted the invitation in February 1906, and he received financial help and a blessing from Parham for his planned one-month visit.|$|E
5|$|The four {{canonical}} gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John) are {{the foremost}} {{sources for the}} life <b>and</b> <b>message</b> of Jesus. However, {{other parts of the}} New Testament also include references to key episodes in his life, such as the Last Supper in 1 Corinthians 11:23. Acts of the Apostles (Acts 10:37–38 and Acts 19) refers to the early ministry of Jesus and its anticipation by John the Baptist. Acts 1:1–11 says more about the Ascension of Jesus (also mentioned in 1 Timothy 3:16) than the canonical gospels do. In the undisputed Pauline letters, which were written earlier than the gospels, the words or instructions of Jesus are cited several times (1 Corinthians 7:10–11, 9:14, 11:23–25, 2 Corinthians 12:9).|$|E

5|$|Perhaps no {{director}} better displayed {{that spirit}} than the German-born Robert Siodmak, {{who had already}} made a score of films before his 1940 arrival in Hollywood. Working mostly on A features, he made eight films now regarded as classic-era film noirs (a figure matched only by Lang and Mann). In addition to The Killers, Burt Lancaster's debut and a Hellinger/Universal co-production, Siodmak's other important contributions to the genre include 1944's Phantom Lady (a top-of-the-line B and Woolrich adaptation), the ironically titled Christmas Holiday (1944), and Cry of the City (1948). Criss Cross (1949), with Lancaster again the lead, exemplifies how Siodmak brought {{the virtues of the}} B-movie to the A noir. In addition to the relatively looser constraints on character <b>and</b> <b>message</b> at lower budgets, the nature of B production lent itself to the noir style for economic reasons: dim lighting saved on electricity and helped cloak cheap sets (mist and smoke also served the cause); night shooting was often compelled by hurried production schedules; plots with obscure motivations and intriguingly elliptical transitions were sometimes the consequence of hastily written scripts, of which there was not always enough time or money to shoot every scene. In Criss Cross, Siodmak achieved these effects with purpose, wrapping them around Yvonne De Carlo, playing the most understandable of femme fatales; Dan Duryea, in one of his many charismatic villain roles; and Lancaster as an ordinary laborer turned armed robber, doomed by a romantic obsession.|$|E
