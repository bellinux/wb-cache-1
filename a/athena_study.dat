40|$|From a {{pharmacological}} perspective, {{this interesting}} article requires two "refinements " to {{the section on}} in-teractions. Mention is made of "digitalis, " without any further differentiation. There is no such preparation – it is either digoxin or digitoxin. Both drugs – combined with amio-darone – can trigger substantial bradycardia and atrio-ventricular conduction disturbances. The {{same is true for}} combinations with beta blockers or calcium antago-nists of the verapamil or diltiazem type. Pharmacokinetic interactions, however, arise only between amiodarone and digoxin, {{as a result of the}} plasma concentration of digoxin.

Only atorvastatin, lovastatin, und simvastatin, and to a limited extent fluvastatin, are biotransformed by cytochrome P 4503 A 4. Pravastatin, which is mostly sulfated, can be combined with amiodarone without any problem.

However, the ANDROMEDA study, evaluating the use of dronedarone in patients with recent decompensated heart failure, and the PALLAS study, evaluating the use of dronedarone in patients with chronic AF, were both terminated prematurely due to a trend toward an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Conclusion: Dronedarone has been demonstrated to be effective in reducing the incidence of AF recurrence. It appears to be less effective but better tolerated than amiodarone. Dronedarone appears to have a low proarrhythmic risk and is the first anti-arrhythmic that has been demonstrated to reduce cardiovascular mortality and cardiovascular hospitalization in clinically stable patients with other risk factors for recurrent AF. Therefore, dronedarone can be recommended as an anti-arrhythmic of choice in clinically stable patients for maintaining SR. If dronedarone is to be used in a patient with chronic stable heart failure, the patient must be monitored closely for any worsening of heart failure symptoms. The drug must be discontinued should the heart failure symptoms worsen. Keywords: dronedarone, atrial fibrillation, anti-arrhythmic...|$|E
40|$|Background: Immunosuppression with calcineurin inhibitors {{remains the}} {{mainstay}} of treatment after kidney transplantation; however, long-term use of these drugs {{may be associated with}} nephrotoxicity. In this regard, the current approach is to optimise available immunosuppressive regimens to reduce the calcineurin inhibitor dose while protecting renal function without affecting the efficacy. The <b>ATHENA</b> <b>study</b> is designed to evaluate renal function in two regimens: an everolimus and reduced calcineurin inhibitor-based regimen versus a standard treatment protocol with mycophenolic acid and tacrolimus in de novo kidney transplant recipients. Method/Design: ATHENA is a 12 -month, multicentre, open-label, prospective, randomised, parallel-group study in de novo kidney transplant recipients (aged 18  years or older) receiving renal allografts from deceased or living donors. Eligible patients are randomised (1 : 1 : 1) prior to transplantation to one of the following three treatment arms: everolimus (starting dose 1. 5  mg/day; C 0 3 – 8  ng/mL) with cyclosporine or everolimus (starting dose 3  mg/day; C 0 3 – 8  ng/mL) with tacrolimus or mycophenolic acid (enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium at 1. 44  g/day or mycophenolate mofetil at 2  g/day) with tacrolimus; in combination with corticosteroids. All patients receive induction therapy with basiliximab. The primary objective is to demonstrate non-inferiority of renal function (eGFR by the Nankivell formula) in one of the everolimus arms compared with the standard group at month 12 post transplantation. The key secondary objective is to assess the incidence of treatment failure, defined as biopsy-proven acute rejection, graft loss, or death, among the treatment groups. Other objectives include assessment of the individual components of treatment failure, incidence and severity of viral infections, incidence and duration of delayed graft function, incidence of indication biopsies, slow graft function and wound healing complications, and overall safety and tolerability. Exploratory objectives include evaluation of left ventricular hypertrophy assessed by the left ventricular mass index, evolution of human leukocyte antigen and non-human leukocyte antigen antibodies, and a cytomegalovirus substudy. Discussion: As one of the largest European multicentre kidney transplant studies, ATHENA will determine whether a de novo everolimus-based regimen can preserve renal function versus the standard of care. This study further assesses a number of clinical issues which impact long-term outcomes post transplantation; hence, its results will have a major clinical impact.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Therapeutic drug {{monitoring}} (TDM) is recommended in several international HIV treatment guidelines. The adherence of clinicians to these recommendations is unknown. The authors evaluated the {{adherence to the}} Dutch TDM guideline of 2005. METHODS: From the <b>ATHENA</b> cohort <b>study,</b> three scenarios were selected for which the guideline recommended TDM: 1) start {{of a combination of}} lopinavir/ritonavir + efavirenz or nevirapine (drug-drug interaction); 2) start of efavirenz (routine TDM); and 3) use of nelfinavir during pregnancy. For each scenario, we determined the proportion of patients for whom TDM was performed. Multivariable logistic regression modeling was used to identify determinants for the use of TDM. RESULTS: The adherence to the TDM guideline was 46. 7 % in patients who started lopinavir/ritonavir plus efavirenz or nevirapine; 9. 5 % for patients who started efavirenz; and 58. 5 % for patients who used nelfinavir during pregnancy. Patients treated in clinics that had a TDM assay available locally and patients treated in academic clinics were more likely to receive TDM. A higher baseline HIV viral load was another significant predictor for the performing TDM. CONCLUSION: The adherence of clinicians to the Dutch TDM guidelines varied from low to moderate for the three investigated TDM scenarios. This study identifies several determinants for the use of TDM, which may be useful information for those responsible for generating TDM guidelines...|$|R

We conduct analyses to study the flow of energy from differential rotation to turbulent fluctuations to thermalization. A study of the time-correlation between the rates of change of different volume-averaged energy components shows that energy injected into turbulent fluctuations dissipates on a timescale of Ω − 1, where Ω is the orbital frequency of the local domain. Magnetic dissipation dominates over kinetic dissipation, although not by as great a factor as the ratio of magnetic to kinetic energy.

40|$|Background: Nevirapine (NVP) {{is often}} {{prescribed}} once daily in clinical practice {{in combination with}} a once daily nucleoside backbone. We investigated the relationship of NVP dosing with safety and efficacy. Methods: Patients from the Dutch AIDS Therapy Evaluation in the Netherlands (<b>ATHENA)</b> cohort <b>study,</b> Canadian HAART Observational Medical Evaluation and Research (HOMER) cohort and Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS) using NVP-based combination therapy either once daily or twice daily were included. Risk factors for discontinuing NVP because of hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) were investigated using multivariate logistic regression. Risk factors for virological failure 96 weeks after NVP initiation were identified using logistic regression and Cox models. Results: Of 5, 636 patients (774 once daily and 4, 862 twice daily), 268 (4. 8 %) discontinued NVP because of HSR between 2 and 18 weeks. Logistic regression showed that, compared with patients with detectable HIV type- 1 (HIV- 1) RNA starting twice-daily NVP, there was a significantly higher risk of discontinuation of once-daily NVP because of HSR in patients with detectable HIV- 1 RNA {{at the start of}} NVP (odds ratio [OR] 1. 52; P= 0. 04), whereas the risk was actually significantly lower in patients starting once-daily NVP with undetectable HIV- 1 RNA (OR 0. 44; P= 0. 04). Cox models showed that risk of virological failure was not different for twice- versus once-daily NVP in treatment-naive patients (twice-daily versus once-daily hazard ratio [HR] 1. 01; P= 0. 95), treatment-experienced patients experiencing treatment failure (twice-daily versus once-daily HR 1. 22; P= 0. 30) or patients with undetectable HIV- 1 RNA simplifying treatment with NVP (twice-daily versus once-daily HR 1. 29; P= 0. 30).

We present {{a set of}} ideal magnetohydrodynamic, unstratified shearing box simulations using two initial magnetic field configurations: a net uniform vertical field, and a sinusoidally varying zero-net vertical field. These simulations provide a comparison with results from earlier studies that used different numerical algorithms. We find that our simulations agree well with previously published results, including the decreasing turbulent energy {{as a function of}} resolution in the zero-net field model. We next carry out analyses to study the flow of energy from differential rotation to turbulent fluctuations to thermalization. The first analysis is based on a direct measurement of the time-evolution of volume-averaged quantities, including the correlation in time between the rates of change of different energy components. We find that the timescale over which energy is injected into turbulent fluctuations and then dissipated is on the order of Ω − 1, where Ω is the orbital frequency of the local domain. Magnetic dissipation dominates over kinetic dissipation, although not by as great a factor as the ratio of magnetic to kinetic energy. The second analysis examines the magnetic and kinetic energy evolution equations in Fourier space, using the assumption that the time-averaged energies are constant. From this, we characterize the numerical dissipation as a function of length scale and model it as effective resistive and viscous losses. We find the numerical resistivity and viscosity are a function of resolution, but the effective magnetic Prandtl number is ∼ 2, independent of resolution or initial field geometry.

40|$|Background. Recommendations that {{nevirapine}} (NVP) {{should be}} avoided in female individuals with CD 4 cell counts > 250 cells/μL and in male individuals with CD 4 cell counts > 400 cells/μL are based on findings in treatment-naive patients. It is unclear whether these guidelines also apply to treatment-experienced patients switching to NVP-based combination therapy. Methods. Patients in the <b>ATHENA</b> cohort <b>study</b> who had used NVP-based combination therapy were included. We identified patients who discontinued NVP-based combination therapy because of hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs; rash and/or hepatotoxicity) within 18 weeks after starting such therapy. We grouped patients according to their CD 4 cell count {{at the start of}} NVP-based combination therapy (current CD 4 cell count) as having a high CD 4 cell count (for female patients, > 250 cells/μL; for male patients, > 400 cells/μL) or a low CD 4 cell count. Treatment-experienced patients were further subdivided according to the last available CD 4 cell count before first receipt of antiretroviral therapy (ART; pre-ART CD 4 cell count) using the same criteria. Risk factors for HSR were assessed using multivariate logistic regression. Results. Of 3752 patients receiving NVP-based combination therapy, 231 patients (6. 2 %) discontinued NVP therapy because of HSRs. Independent risk factors included female sex and Asian ethnicity. Having an undetectable viral load (VL) at the start of NVP therapy was associated with reduced risk of developing an HSR (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0. 52; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 38 - 0. 71). Pretreated patients with low pre-ART and high current CD 4 cell counts and a detectable VL when switching to NVP-based combination therapy had a significantly higher risk of developing an HSR, compared with treatment-naive patients who started NVP therapy with low CD 4 cell counts (adjusted OR, 1. 87; 95 % CI, 1. 11 - 3. 12); pretreated patients with low pre-ART CD 4 cell counts who switched to NVP therapy with a high current CD 4 cell count and an undetectable VL did not have an increased risk of developing an HSR (adjusted OR, 1. 03; 95 % CI, 0. 66 - 1. 61). Conclusions. Treatment- experienced patients who start NVP-based combination therapy with low pre-ART and high current CD 4 cell counts and an undetectable VL have a similar likelihood for discontinuing NVP therapy because of HSRs, compared with treatment-naive patients with low CD 4 cell counts. This suggests that NVP-based combination therapy may be safely initiated in such patients. However, in similar patients with a detectable VL, it is prudent to continue to adhere to current CD 4 cell count thresholds...|$|R
40|$|International audienceLong-term bisphosphonate {{therapy is}} {{associated}} with increased risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ). In a retrospective analysis, a 16 % ONJ incidence was reported in patients receiving bisphosphonates with anti-angiogenic therapy (bevacizumab or sunitinib) for bone metastases from breast, colon, or renal cell cancers. To assess ONJ incidence with bevacizumab, we analysed data from 3, 560 patients receiving bevacizumab-containing therapy for locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer (LR/MBC) in two double-blind, randomised trials (AVADO and RIBBON- 1) and a large, non-randomised safety <b>study</b> (<b>ATHENA).</b> The overall incidence of ONJ with bevacizumab was 0. 3 % in the blinded phase of the two randomised trials and 0. 4 % in the single-arm study. There was a trend towards increased ONJ incidence in patients who received bisphosphonate therapy versus those with no bisphosphonate exposure (0. 9 vs. 0. 2 %, respectively, in the pooled analysis of the randomised trials; 2. 4 vs. 0 %, respectively, in ATHENA). In conclusion, {{this is the largest}} analysis of ONJ in patients receiving bevacizumab for LR/MBC. The 0. 3 – 0. 4 % incidence is considerably lower than previously suggested with anti-angiogenic therapy in a small retrospective analysis. The risk of ONJ appeared to be increased in patients exposed to bisphosphonates, a pattern consistent with observations before the introduction of anti-angiogenic therapy to breast cancer management.
