5|$|The Japanese {{permitted}} the POWs to build septic systems and irrigation ditches throughout the prisoner {{side of the}} camp. An onsite commissary was available to sell items such as bananas, eggs, coffee, notebooks, and cigarettes. Recreational activities allowed for baseball, horseshoes, and ping pong matches. In addition, a 3,000-book library was allowed (much of which {{was provided by the}} Red Cross), and films were shown occasionally. A bulldog was kept by the prisoners, and served as a mascot for the camp. Each year around Christmas, the Japanese guards gave permission for the Red Cross to donate <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>box</b> to each of the prisoners, containing items such as corned beef, instant coffee, and tobacco. Prisoners were also able to send postcards to relatives, although they were censored by the guards.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} Dungeons & Dragons, now {{referred to}} as OD, was <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>box</b> set of three booklets published in 1974. It was amateurish in production and assumed the player was familiar with wargaming. Nevertheless, it grew rapidly in popularity, first among wargamers and then expanding to a more general audience of college and high school students. Roughly 1,000 copies of the game were sold {{in the first year}} followed by 3,000 in 1975, and much more in the following years. This first set went through many printings and was supplemented with several official additions, such as the original Greyhawk and Blackmoor supplements (both 1975), as well as magazine articles in TSR's official publications and many fanzines.|$|E
5|$|In October 2012, {{new details}} emerged in her murder investigation. Charges were brought against Jorge Antonio Hernández Silva (alias El Silva) and José Adrián Hernández Domínguez (alias El Jarocho), {{two men who}} were alleged to have murdered Martínez Pérez. Silva, who had already been arrested, confessed to the murder. According to Silva's confession, the {{reporter}} knew Domínguez and therefore allowed both of them into her house {{on the night of}} her murder. After some conversation, Domínguez grew angry and started beating Martínez Pérez with the intention of forcing her to reveal where she hid her money and other valuable possessions. Silva then joined his accomplice in the beating until they killed her. Investigators said that the attackers had plunged the journalist's head into a toilet bowl, hit her on the head several times with brass knuckles, and threw her against a tub, where she cracked her skull. Martínez Pérez unsuccessfully tried to defend herself by grabbing a kitchen knife and stabbing one of the attackers in the forearm, but they managed to outweigh her because she only weighed 108lbs (48.9kg). Both men then stole a plasma TV, two cellphones, a laptop computer, a camera and <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>box,</b> and the journalist's wristband from her home before leaving the crime scene.|$|E

5|$|The weather {{continued}} to hamper the 9th Division's advance. The 26th Brigade, further inland, remained {{stuck on the}} eastern side of the Busu. On 10 September, the commandos providing flank security managed to get across the Sankwep River, close to its confluence with the Busu, pushing a kunda bridge across. Shortly afterwards, they clashed with a small party of Japanese attempting to advance towards the bridge, and several Japanese were killed. To reinvigorate the 26th, engineer support was brought up. The 2/7th Field Company was pushing a jeep track forward with the help of the 2/48th, and they subsequently arrived with boats, ropes and cables, and several attempts were made to get across, all of which eventually failed as the engineers came under fire from the opposite bank. Heavy clashes later took place as the Australians and Japanese fought desperately in the swamp around the crossing. As it became uncertain whether the 26th would be able to force their way across, a company from the 2/48th was sent south to use the 24th Brigade's crossing and then advance north along the western bank of the Busu to help secure the brigade's beachhead when it finally did get across. on 13 September further engineer stores arrived, including bridging equipment and folding boats, and the following day <b>a</b> <b>Small</b> <b>Box</b> Girder bridge was pushed across despite heavy fire from the opposite bank, allowing the 26th Brigade to get across the Busu on 14 September.|$|E

His grief was added to when he learned {{a couple of days later}} that his beloved elder sister, Wilhelmine, who had shared their father's wrath in 1730 during the Katte affair, had died on the same day. He sulked in his tent for a week. At one point, he showed his librarian <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>box</b> of opium capsules, 18 in total, that he could use to [...] "journey to a dark place from which there was no return."

500|$|... "Dual Spires" [...] is {{presented}} as an homage to Twin Peaks, and CNN writer Katie McLaughlin noted several allusions the episode makes to the series. In {{the beginning of the}} episode, there is a chocolate bunny on Shawn's desk. In Twin Peaks, Special Agent Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) delivered the famous line [...] "Diane, I'm holding in my hands <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>box</b> of chocolate bunnies." [...] Gus then asks, [...] "Since when is the sound of opening and closing shades so disruptive that it needs to be alleviated?" [...] The character Nadine Hurley in Twin Peaks attempted to patent her silent drape runner invention. Someone from a website by the name of UnderTheNail.com sends Shawn and Gus an e-mail that says, [...] "Who killed Paula Merral?" [...] Twin Peaks famed the catchphrase [...] "Who Killed Laura Palmer?" [...] The killer also purposely placed clues in his victims' fingernail beds.

500|$|The [...] "From Hell" [...] {{letter was}} {{received}} by George Lusk, {{leader of the}} Whitechapel Vigilance Committee, on [...] 1888.

The letter came with <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>box</b> in which Lusk discovered half of a kidney, preserved in [...] "spirits of wine" [...] (ethanol). Eddowes' left kidney had been removed by the killer. The writer claimed that he [...] "fried and ate" [...] the missing kidney half. There is disagreement over the kidney; some contend that it belonged to Eddowes, while others argue {{that it was a}} macabre practical joke. The kidney was examined by Dr Thomas Openshaw of the London Hospital, who determined that it was human and from the left side, but (contrary to false newspaper reports) he could not determine any other biological characteristics. Openshaw subsequently also received a letter signed [...] "Jack the Ripper".|$|E

500|$|In 1894, the [...] "blue pebbles" [...] were {{recognized}} as sapphires. [...] One story credits {{a local school}} teacher for recognizing the blue pebbles as sapphires. A variation is that the teacher lived in Maine, but {{was a friend of}} a local miner, who had mailed her <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>box</b> with some gold and a few [...] "blue pebbles" [...] in it. Another story credits a miner named S.S. Hobson for surmising that the blue stones might be sapphires, and his guess was confirmed by a jeweler in Helena. [...] Ultimately, in 1895, Jake Hoover sent a cigar box containing those he had collected while mining gold to an assay office, which in turn sent them via regular, uninsured mail to Tiffany's in New York City for appraisal by Dr. George Frederick Kunz, the leading American gemologist of the time. Impressed by their quality and color, Kunz pronounced them [...] "the finest precious gemstones ever found in the United States".

500|$|Between August and November 1888, {{at least}} five brutal murders were {{committed}} in the Whitechapel district of London. Although Whitechapel was an impoverished area and violence there was common, these murders {{can be linked to}} the same killer through a distinctive modus operandi. All the murders took place within the distance of a few streets, late at night or in the early morning, and the victims were all women whose throats were cut. In four of the cases, their bodies were mutilated, or even eviscerated. The removal of internal organs from three of the victims led to contemporary proposals that [...] "considerable anatomical knowledge was displayed by the murderer, which would seem to indicate that his occupation was that of a butcher or a surgeon." [...] Media organisations and the police received many letters and postcards purportedly written by the killer, who was dubbed [...] "Jack the Ripper" [...] after one of the signatories. Most of the anonymous confessional letters were dismissed by the police as hoaxes but one, known as the [...] "From Hell" [...] letter after a phrase used by the writer, was treated more seriously; it was sent with <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>box</b> containing half of a preserved human kidney.
