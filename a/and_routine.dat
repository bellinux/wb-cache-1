40|$|A {{number of}} blind {{children}} exhibit delays in cognitive functioning and language usage resulting in difficulties in sharing meaningful conversation by three years. One {{reason may be}} that blindness in infancy limits the availability of information about space, especially distal space and so these children have to rely on other information in making sense of their environment. Time-based information about actions and events is likely to be very important to blind infants. Rhymes <b>and</b> <b>routines</b> depend partially on time-based information and have been reported to be widely used by blind children and their sighted parents. The present study examines the relationship between cognitive and language functioning and the quality and nature of rhymes <b>and</b> <b>routines</b> in four blind children and their mothers. All children were able to initiate rhymes <b>and</b> <b>routines</b> as well as using increasingly sophisticated verbal strategies and language play. Differences emerged between dyads concerning {{the extent to which they}} were able to involve objects and space in rhymes <b>and</b> <b>routines.</b> The findings are discussed in relation to the potential role of rhymes <b>and</b> <b>routines</b> in the development of blind children...|$|R

5|$|There are 21 {{counties}} in New Jersey. These counties together contain 565 municipalities, or administrative entities composed of clearly defined territory; 250 boroughs, 52 cities, 15 towns, 244 townships, and 4 villages.

Counties traditionally perform state-mandated duties such as the maintenance of jails, parks, and certain roads. The site of a county's administration and courts is called the county seat.|$|E

40|$|The {{current study}} had two purposes. The first {{purpose was to}} examine the {{association}} between family rules <b>and</b> <b>routines</b> <b>and</b> first grade children's teacher-rated and peer-rated behavioral competencies (e. g., emotional symptoms, conduct problems, peer problems, hyperactivity, and prosocial behavior) after controlling for both family stressors (i. e., single parent home, mobility, socioeconomic status, property ownership) and child ethnicity (African American, Caucasian, Hispanic). The second purpose was to determine if child regulatory control abilities mediates the effects of family rules <b>and</b> <b>routines</b> <b>and</b> children's behavioral competencies. The parents of 215 ethnically diverse children (38 %, Caucasian, 22 % African American, 33 % Hispanic, 7 % Other) were interviewed in their homes with a modified and shortened version of Family Routines Inventory (FRI; Jensen, James, Boyce, & Hartnett, 1983). Teachers completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ; Goodman, 1997), and peers completed {{a modified version of the}} Class Play (Masten, Morison & Pelligrini, 1985). Scores from the SDQ were standardized and combined with the standardized scores obtained from the peer nominations to create composites of the behavioral competencies. Additionally, teachers completed a modified version of the California Child Q-set (CCQ) (Block & Block, 1980) as a measure of these children's regulatory control abilities. African American parents' ratings of their family's rules <b>and</b> <b>routines</b> were higher than those of Hispanic and Caucasian parents' ratings. Additionally, family stressors were positively associated with higher teacher and peer ratings of conduct problems and lower ratings of prosocial behavior. Neither ethnicity nor family rules <b>and</b> <b>routines</b> predicted child competencies. A statistically significant curvilinear relationship was found between family rules <b>and</b> <b>routines</b> <b>and</b> conduct problems such that children of parents reporting the highest and lowest levels of family rules <b>and</b> <b>routines</b> have more conduct problems. No associations were found between family rules <b>and</b> <b>routines</b> <b>and</b> child competencies or children's regulatory control abilities. Limitations of the study are discussed in terms of inadequate measurement of family rules <b>and</b> <b>routines,</b> a defensive response set, self-selection on the part of the parents to participate in the interview, and a sample that is not representative of the community of parents and children in the participating schools...|$|R

5|$|Treatment {{is based}} on the {{severity}} of the bite; the majority of cases do not require medical care and patients with localised pain, swelling and redness usually only require local application of ice <b>and</b> <b>routine</b> analgesics. Hospital assessment is recommended if simple analgesia does not resolve local pain or clinical features of systemic envenoming occur. In more severe bites, Redback antivenom can be given. Redback antivenom can also cross-neutralise katipo venom, and it is used to treat envenoming from Latrodectus katipo in New Zealand. It is available from most major New Zealand hospitals. Antivenom will usually relieve symptoms of systemic envenoming and is indicated in anyone suffering symptoms consistent with Latrodectus envenoming. Unlike some other antivenoms, it is not limited to patients with signs of severe, systemic envenoming. Particular indications for using antivenom are local then generalised pain, sweating or hypertension. However, good evidence to support the effectiveness of widow spider antivenoms is lacking and studies have cast some doubt on antivenoms efficacy in latrodectism. Pain relief agents, such as parenteral opiates, or benzodiazepines may be required as adjunct agents.|$|E
