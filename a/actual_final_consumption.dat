50|$|<b>Actual</b> <b>final</b> <b>consumption</b> of {{households}} excludes the general government's {{collective consumption expenditure}} which is expenditure on goods and services that cannot be uniquely attributed to households (e.g. expenditure on defence, safety and order, home affairs, environmental protection, national bodies such as parliament, governments etc.).|$|E
50|$|Approximately {{one quarter}} of the economy-wide <b>final</b> <b>consumption</b> {{expenditure}} in the European Union of 27 member states is made by governments; countries with relatively large government shares in <b>final</b> <b>consumption</b> expenditure are Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Finland and Sweden (around one-third of their <b>final</b> <b>consumption</b> expenditure).|$|R
50|$|The most {{important}} part of <b>final</b> <b>consumption</b> expenditure is household <b>final</b> <b>consumption</b> expenditure.

The analysis of the <b>final</b> <b>consumption</b> shows concern especially by observing the evolution of its two components: actual consumption achieved by households and the one achieved by public administrations. <b>Final</b> <b>consumption</b> has a high share within the gross domestic product, but the trend is one of diminishing it. The situation in which our country is found is no different from what occurs in other EU countries, where the <b>final</b> <b>consumption</b> has a significant share in GDP. ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the member}} states of the European Union the share of {{household}} final consumption expenditure (HFCE) in <b>actual</b> <b>final</b> <b>consumption</b> of households usually varies between 70% and 90%. The rest is goods and services consumed free of charge (or at reduced prices) transferred by governments and non-profit institutions serving households to households. A high government share {{in the provision of}} individual consumption goods and services is often found in countries known as welfare states. Countries with relatively large shares of such transfers in kind are Belgium, Denmark, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Finland and Sweden, where HFCE represents less than 80% of <b>actual</b> <b>final</b> <b>consumption</b> of households for most years. The above observations are based on data downloadable from Eurostat's website: ...|$|E
50|$|Household final {{consumption}} expenditure (HFCE) is not an exhaustive measure of {{the goods and services}} consumed by households. The general government and non-profit institutions serving households (NPISH) often provide goods and services to households for their individual consumption free of charge or at reduced prices. Examples are health services provided by governments or reimbursed by a social security fund, education services, the part of service provided by public museums, concert halls, operas, swimming pools that is not financed by entrance fees, aid for social housing etc. By adding the general government's and NPISHs' individual consumption expenditure to household {{final consumption}} expenditure one receives the <b>actual</b> <b>final</b> <b>consumption</b> of households.|$|E

One of the main aspects of GDP analysis is the correlation with the <b>final</b> <b>consumption,</b> an important macroeconomic indicator. The evolution of the Gross Domestic Product is highly influenced by the evolution of the <b>final</b> <b>consumption.</b> To analyze the correlation, the paper proposes the use of the linear regression model, {{as one of the most}} appropriate instruments for such scientific approach.

To calculate the productivity growth of export goods, exports were analyzed. The separation of non-tradable goods and export goods was executed according to the commodity base method. In other words, productivity is calculated by considering products for domestic consumption and for export.|$|R

Analysis of <b>final</b> energy <b>consumption</b> during 2000 - 2013 period indicated the main driving forces of <b>final</b> energy <b>consumption</b> {{during and after}} world financial crisis of 2008. The paper aimed to evaluate the impact of economic activity and other factors on <b>final</b> energy <b>consumption.</b> The decomposition of the <b>final</b> energy <b>consumption</b> is assessed by analyzing effect of different drivers by the main end-users sector (industry, transport, households, agriculture, services), activity, demography, lifestyles, structural effects, energy savings etc. The {{results show that the}} reduction in <b>final</b> energy <b>consumption</b> in most EU memb ers states before and after year 2008 can be related to the decline in energy intensities within end - users sectors. At the same time, the increase in final energy intensity after the year 2008 is attributed to expansion of energy demand sectors. Comparison of <b>final</b> energy <b>consumption</b> trends and drivers in Latvia and Czech Republic indicated that Czech Republic implemented more policies and measures in industry and tertiary sector and this provided for <b>final</b> energy <b>consumption</b> decreased and huge energy savings in these sectors...|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{the causal}} nexus between child {{mortality}} rate, fertility rate, GDP, household <b>final</b> <b>consumption</b> expenditure, and food production index in Ghana was investigated spanning from 1971 to 2013 using the Autoregressive and Distributed Lag (ARDL) method. The study tested for unit root, ARDL bounds cointegration test, ARDL long-run elasticities, Granger causality, and Variance Decomposition Analysis using Cholesky technique. There {{was evidence of}} long-run equilibrium relationship running from fertility rate, food production index, GDP, and household <b>final</b> <b>consumption</b> expenditure to the mortality rate. There was evidence of a bidirectional causality running from household <b>final</b> <b>consumption</b> expenditure to fertility rate. Evidence from the Variance Decomposition Analysis shows that, almost 6 % of future fluctuations in mortality rate are due to shocks in the food production index, while 2 % of future fluctuations in mortality rate are due to shocks in fertility rate. Evidence from the study shows that the increasing levels of social determinants like Gross Domestic Product and Household <b>final</b> <b>consumption</b> expenditure will help reduce child mortality rates in Ghana. In order to reduce child mortality rates among children under- 5, infants and vulnerable in Ghana, there {{is the need to}} end hunger and ensure access to safe and nutritious food...|$|R

40|$|Along {{with the}} rapid {{economic}} growth and reform since 1978, {{there has been a}} remarkable trend in China, i. e. the steady decline of the share of <b>final</b> <b>consumption</b> expenditure in GDP that has made China be one of economies with lower ratio of consumption in the world for a long period. This phenomenon has become one of hot issues among the economists in China in recent years. It is also very important for policy implication given the key role of consumption in the growth. This paper is mainly used to analyze the reasons why China's <b>final</b> <b>consumption</b> rate was declined. We found that there are four reasons to explain why China's <b>final</b> <b>consumption</b> rate was declined: decrease of propensity of consumption; adjustment of distribution structure of national income; the reform of housing system in urban area and slower growth of income of rural residence...|$|R
40|$|This {{empirical}} {{study examines}} the long-run relationship between inflation and its determinants in South Africa. Three models of inflation involving money supply, bank credit and expenditure components are tested using the unrestricted error correction models of Pesaran et al. (2001). Unlike other existing {{studies on the}} subject, one of the models {{in the present study}} considers various components of real income as determinants. The disaggregated components are <b>final</b> <b>consumption</b> expenditure, expenditure on investment goods and exports. Based on ‘bounds’ testing, the presence of a long-run equilibrium relationship between inflation and its determinants is confirmed for all three models. The study found that the major causes of inflation in South Africa are import prices, real income, and <b>final</b> <b>consumption</b> expenditure. The relationship is elastic for import prices and <b>final</b> <b>consumption</b> expenditure. Monetary variables, money supply and bank credit are found to have an indirect effect on inflation...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{a method}} to attribute hazardous waste streams to regional production and consumption activity, and to connect these same waste streams through to different management options. We argue that a method using an input-output framework provides useful intelligence for decision makers seeking to connect elements of {{the management of the}} hazardous waste hierarchy to production and to different patterns and types of <b>final</b> <b>consumption</b> (of which domestic household consumption is one). This paper extends application of conventional demand driven input-output attribution methods to identify hazardous waste ‘hotspots’ in the supply chains of different <b>final</b> <b>consumption</b> goods and consumption groups. Using a regional case study to exposit the framework and its use, we find that domestic government <b>final</b> <b>consumption</b> of public administration production indirectly drives hazardous waste generation that goes to landfill, particularly in the domestic construction and sanitary services sectors, but also in the manufacture of wood products...|$|R
