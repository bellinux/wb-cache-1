5|$|Some misguided Hollywood {{press agent}} sought to alter Como's life story by {{changing}} his previous occupation from barber to coal miner, claiming {{it would make}} for better press. Fred Othman, a Hollywood columnist, publicly stated that he believed Como the barber was just a publicity gimmick. Perry gave him a shave and haircut at the Fox Studios barber shop to prove him wrong. In 1985, Como related {{the story of his}} first film role experience in Something for the Boys. He sat ready to work in his dressing room for two weeks without being called. Perry spent the next two weeks playing golf, still not missed by the studio. It was five weeks before he was <b>actually</b> <b>called</b> to the set, despite the studio's initial urgent report for work notice. When Como finally appeared, the director had no idea who he was.|$|E
25|$|The Crown Keeper (kustosz koronny) was the {{official}} responsible for safeguarding the Royal Treasury, where the royal insignia were kept. The {{keys to the}} Treasury were held by the Great Treasurer and six voivods, and without each of them, the Treasury could not be opened. Traditionally, the Crown Keeper was chosen from among the priests of Kraków Cathedral. The Lithuanian Keeper was <b>actually</b> <b>called</b> a Treasurer (skarbny).|$|E
25|$|At first Napoleon {{hoped that}} the invading Allied armies {{numbered}} only 80,000 men but they fielded 200,000 troops, to which the French emperor could only oppose 70,000 soldiers. Among Schwarzenberg's formations were the Austrian III Corps under Ignaz Gyulai with 14,732 soldiers and 56 artillery pieces and the Württemberg IV Corps under Crown Prince Frederick William of Württemberg with 14,000 men and 24 guns. To defend his regime, Napoleon planned to conscript 936,000 Frenchmen but only a third were <b>actually</b> <b>called</b> up. Of these, only about one-eighth fought because muskets were not available; large numbers resisted the draft. The emperor eventually drew from his southern armies 11,015 foot soldiers, 3,420 horsemen and 40 guns from Marshal Jean-de-Dieu Soult and 8,051 infantry, 2,132 cavalry and 18 guns from Marshal Louis-Gabriel Suchet. Because of the French generals' weak forces, the Coalition armies' advance from the frontiers to the Marne River was hardly opposed at all.|$|E

25|$|Iturbide {{sent his}} most trusted man, his protégé of sorts (whom, he wrote, he had {{treated as a}} son), General Echávarri, to combat the rebels. Iturbide's effort met with success. Santa Anna {{considered}} escaping to the United States but was stopped by Victoria. Santa Anna, with most of his infantry destroyed by the Imperial army, made himself strong {{in the city of}} Veracruz with his superior artillery. Victoria himself was separated from Veracruz, fighting behind Imperial lines. Bravo and Guerrero were defeated, with Guerrero suffering such a grievous injury in battle that the nation believed him dead until he resurfaced months later. However, General Echávarri and several other imperial officers decided to proclaim a new plan, the Plan de la Casa Mata. This plan called for the installation of a new Congress, as opposed to the old one. It also recognized the Empire as the elected and legitimate form of government, and Emperor Iturbide as the legitimate ruler of the nation. Thus, none of the treaties proclaimed against the Empire <b>actually</b> <b>called</b> specifically for Iturbide's abdication. Casa Mata's key point was giving provinces the right to govern themselves in the interim until the new Congress was formed. Almost all of the Provinces wished to govern themselves rather than letting a central government do it. Thus, they all accepted the plan, {{with the exception of the}} province of Chiapas.|$|E

Already knowing from earlier maps that the region included two rivers called the Columbia and the Kootenay, Thompson thought that {{what is now called}} the Columbia was the Kootenay, and he thought that he had not yet found the real Kootenay. Thence he applied the name [...] "McGillivray’s River" [...] to the real Kootenay in honor of his trading partners William and Duncan McGillivray. In his writings, the Columbia from Columbia Lake to the Big Bend was <b>actually</b> <b>called</b> the Kootenae.|$|E

Frank leaves, Carl angrily realizing a minute too late that he has been fooled. Later, at Christmas, Carl is still at work when Frank calls him, attempting to apologize for duping Carl. Carl rejects his apology and tells him he will soon be caught, but laughs when he realizes Frank <b>actually</b> <b>called</b> him because he has no one else to talk to. Frank hangs up, and Carl continues to investigate, suddenly realizing (thanks to a waiter) that the name [...] "Barry Allen" [...] is from the Flash comic books and that Frank is actually a teenager.|$|E
500|$|Dan Weiss from Spin {{observed}} that the [...] "most surprising thing about a song that's <b>actually</b> <b>called</b> 'Bitch, I'm Madonna' is that it doesn't have any surprises". In contrast, Andrew Unterberger of the same publication enjoyed the track, claiming that [...] "it might not be your favorite Madonna, but it's unquestionably her, and it's far more compelling than the anonymous EDM enthusiast she played on MDNA (2012)". Unterberger also praised the addition of PC Music [...] "ping-ponging oddball freneticism" [...] and [...] "Diplo's block-dropping beats". Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone was also positive, calling it [...] "frenetic", and praised Minaj's verse for being [...] "pure fire", while Anna Zelaski of The A.V. Club appreciated the song for being [...] "the right kind of ... that's mindless fun and impossible to take seriously". In the same vein, Andy Gill of The Independent called it [...] "amusingly abrasive" [...] and praised Minaj for [...] "repris her role as Madge's rapping henchgirl".|$|E

500|$|Batwoman {{appears in}} the [...] episode [...] "The Criss Cross Conspiracy!", voiced by Vanessa Marshall. Though {{visually}} based on the Kathy Kane's Batwoman, the character is never <b>actually</b> <b>called</b> Batwoman and is also an original character: Katrina Moldoff, the heiress to the Moldoff Circus fortune. On his Formspring page, Brave and the Bold director Ben Jones confirmed {{that the decision to}} rename the character was brought about after DC Comics voiced concerns about the episode's depiction of the character having a negative impact on the new Batwoman comic book series, the first issue of which launched {{less than a month after}} the episode's initial air date. She is portrayed as a thrill seeker and a trained circus acrobat whom Batman dislikes due to her crime fighting occasionally endangering innocent bystanders. When she is unmasked in public by the Riddler, she is forced to give up her crime-fighting life. She attempts to get revenge by encouraging Felix Faust to use a spell to switch her and Batman's bodies, allowing her to get closer to the Riddler without the police coming after her. When she fails, Batman rescues her and gets Faust to switch them back. She goes along quietly with the police while they are arresting Riddler and his henchmen.|$|E
500|$|After leaving college, Oppong {{took part}} in the draft combine for the newly-formed National Basketball League of Canada (NBL) in August 2011. He was later {{selected}} by the Halifax Rainmen as the 13th overall pick {{in the second round of}} the 2011 NBL Canada draft. He made his professional debut with the Rainmen on November 3, 2011, scoring 6 points and recording 4 rebounds in a loss to the London Lightning. Through the next seven games, he saw very limited playing time, spending over 10 minutes on the court in just three contests. After averaging three points per game, Oppong was released by Halifax in early December 2011. Nevertheless, he still drew the attention of Gary Durrant, the director of basketball operations for the Oshawa Power, who pursued Oppong in the draft combine itself. Oppong said, [...] "Gary <b>actually</b> <b>called</b> my agent and said they wanted me to come back to take another look at me. They liked me and it worked out." [...] He was pleased at the idea of joining the Power because of it was located very close to his hometown as well. Oppong made his first appearance for Oshawa on January 12, 2012, but was scoreless with 3 personal fouls vs the Summerside Storm. He scored a season-best 10 points on January 29, lifting his team to a victory over the Moncton Miracles.|$|E
500|$|Looking Glass {{signed a}} multi-game {{publishing}} deal with Electronic Arts in May 1998, and that company became {{the publisher of}} Flight Combat. The team [...] "undersold" [...] the game to Electronic Arts, and James Sterrett of the fansite Through the Looking Glass believed that the team [...] "gambled that it could get the game out the door faster than the budget <b>actually</b> <b>called</b> for". In March 1999, the game was announced as the World War II-themed Flight Combat: Thunder Over Europe, directed by Hantzopoulos and scheduled for release in fall of that year. That May, the game was shown at the Electronic Arts booth at E3. Computer Games Magazines Steve Udell wrote that the game would feature a new iteration of the Flight Unlimited terrain renderer, and IGN reported that one million square miles of terrain based on European landscapes would be available. Weather conditions such as snow and rain were planned. Udell wrote that Flight Combats flight physics were {{an updated version of}} those from recent Flight Unlimited games, with new material taken from operations manuals and flight tests. Plane models and textures were based on photographs, and many of the moving parts and flight control surfaces were modeled individually. Players were given the option to customize planes. Udell described a physics-based damage system that, according to the company, made it impossible to [...] "see the exact same kind of damage twice". Two campaigns—the Battle of Britain and the Defence of the Reich—were announced, with missions based on dogfights, air-to-ground combat and bombing runs. Looking Glass claimed that the game would feature [...] "moving tanks and ships duk it out on a dynamic battlefield" [...] as the player carried out missions. Aesthetically, IGN's Tal Blevins noted that the game had [...] "a very distinct 40s charm", which was present [...] "from the briefings to the options screens".|$|E

Zenke conducted a follow-up interview with ESRB President Patricia Vance, who clarified {{that the reason for}} the re-classification, aside from the previously-undisclosed gore, centered around the fact that the texture for nude female breasts was created by Bethesda and already existed in the game's files, and was not created or added after the fact by the modder, similarly to the infamous [...] "Hot Coffee" [...] minigame from [...] [...] "In the case of Oblivion, the first thing we had heard about was the topless characters, where you can actually opt-in to play throughout the whole game with a topless character.

It wasn't a Barbie Doll image, it was fully rendered." [...] In regard to what is considered by the ESRB for rating a game, Vance stated, [...] "Our policies are quite clear: it's what's created by the publisher and included on the disc, not what's created or introduced by a mod. The mod may unlock it, the mod may make it accessible, but again, going back to the publisher's burden; putting the accountability on the publisher to fully account for the content that they create and they ship – that's all we care about." [...] Vance went on to state that [...] "ESRB can't rate content that is created by other players. We never have, we never tried, nor will we ever," [...] and that the only warning ESRB issues regarding third-party content is [...] "Game Experience May Change During Online Play." ...|$|E
