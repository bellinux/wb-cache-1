Stein further stated that as of August 1, <b>all</b> <b>trades</b> needed to be confirmed with the league office by all involved parties before they would be considered consummated. Lindros signed a five-year contract with the Flyers worth an estimated $24million. As a rookie, he earned $2million, while Gretzky, with the largest NHL contract, earned $3million. Lindros did not accompany the Flyers to Quebec for an exhibition game prior to the 1992–93 season due to concern about the reception he would receive. Hextall and Ricci initially {{did not want to}} report to Quebec, but relented.|$|E

25|$|A {{successful}} merchant and lawyer, Thomas Cromwell was {{a self-made}} man of relatively humble beginnings whose intelligence and abilities {{enabled him to}} rise {{to become the most}} powerful man in England next to the king. His own father, Walter Cromwell, had been a jack of <b>all</b> <b>trades</b> - a blacksmith, fuller and brewer who had, from time to time, come to the attention of the authorities. Thomas Cromwell was sent to school as a boy, where he learned to read and write and was taught a little Latin. Thomas Cromwell was determined to provide a more extensive education for his own son, Gregory.|$|E

25|$|After Shemp {{rejoined the}} act, Moe, Shemp, and Larry shot a {{television}} pilot for ABC called Jerks of <b>All</b> <b>Trades</b> (1949), apparently intended {{to lead to}} a weekly sitcom series on the premise that the Stooges would try a different job or business every week, hoping that eventually one of their attempts would be successful. Anything they tried {{turned out to be a}} fiasco, which was the source of the comedy. The pilot took a single day to film and was never aired. It was actually a kinescope film of a three camera television production, most likely to replicate a proposed live broadcast.|$|E
25|$|The Shemp years also {{marked a}} major milestone: the Stooges' first {{appearance}} on television. In 1948, they guest-starred on Milton Berle's popular Texaco Star Theater and Morey Amsterdam's The Morey Amsterdam Show. By 1949, the team filmed a pilot for ABC-TV {{for their own}} weekly television series, titled Jerks of <b>All</b> <b>Trades.</b> Columbia Pictures blocked the series from going into production, but their slapstick humor was in great demand for television stations looking to fill air time. The team went on to appear on Camel Comedy Caravan (also known as The Ed Wynn Show), The Kate Smith Hour, The Colgate Comedy Hour, The Frank Sinatra Show and The Eddie Cantor Comedy Theatre, among others.|$|E

From 1925 to 1931, {{he was also a}} Professor of Aesthetics at the newly founded Fine Arts School of Cluj, and as such a faculty colleague of several influential figures in 20th century Romanian art theory, painters (Catul Bogdan, Aurel Ciupe, Anastase Demian, Romulus Ladea, Eugen Pascu, Alexandru Popp) as well as intellectuals (historian Coriolan Petreanu, critics Liviu Rusu and Gheorghe Bogdan-Duică).|$|E

25|$|In {{the absence}} of {{negative}} externalities, the introduction of taxes into a market reduces economic efficiency by causing deadweight loss. In a competitive market {{the price of a}} particular economic good adjusts to ensure that <b>all</b> <b>trades</b> which benefit both the buyer and the seller of a good occur. The introduction of a tax causes the price received by the seller to be less than the cost to the buyer by the amount of the tax. This causes fewer transactions to occur, which reduces economic welfare; the individuals or businesses involved are less well off than before the tax. The tax burden and the amount of deadweight cost is dependent on the elasticity of supply and demand for the good taxed.|$|E
25|$|The Law on Nine-Year Compulsory Education (中华人民共和国义务教育法), {{which took}} effect on July 1, 1986, {{established}} requirements and deadlines for attaining universal education tailored to local conditions and guaranteed school-age children {{the right to}} receive at least nine years of education (six-year primary education and three years secondary education). People's congresses at various local levels were, within certain guidelines and according to local conditions, to decide the steps, methods, and deadlines for implementing nine-year compulsory education {{in accordance with the}} guidelines formulated by the central authorities. The program sought to bring rural areas, which had four to six years of compulsory schooling, into line with their urban counterparts. Education departments were exhorted to train millions of skilled workers for <b>all</b> <b>trades</b> and professions and to offer guidelines, curricula, and methods to comply with the reform program and modernization needs.|$|E
25|$|Concretely, Tunisian {{women are}} very {{involved}} in society, as they represent 58.1 per cent of students in higher education. They work in <b>all</b> <b>trades,</b> in the army, in civil and military aviation and in the police. They represent 72 per cent of pharmacy workers, 42 per cent in medicine, 27 per cent of magistrates, 31 per cent of lawyers and 40 per cent of university professors. In total, in 2004 they constituted 26.6 per cent of the work force, although in 1989 they had only represented 20.9 per cent and a mere 5.5 per cent in 1966. Furthermore, from 1999 to 2004 job creation grew 3.21 per cent for women, {{with an average of}} 19,000 created each year. Moreover, the illiteracy rate of women ten years and older declined from 96.6 per cent in 1956 to 58.1 per cent in 1984 to 42.3 per cent in 1994 to 31 per cent in 2004; the masculine rate in 2004 was 21.2 per cent. This is explained primarily {{by the fact that the}} number of girls per one hundred boys in primary school was 52 in 1965 and 83 in 1989. Furthermore, in the absence of the equity law, they represented 14.89 per cent of the members of government, 22.75 per cent (43 of 189) of the deputies of the House elected on October 24, 2004, 27.06 per cent of municipal councillors and 18 per cent of the members of the economic and social council. In addition, between ten thousand and fifteen thousand of them are business leaders. Nevertheless, unemployment affects women disproportionately, 16.7 per cent in 2004 compared to 12.9 per cent for men.|$|E

500|$|When Philip of Hesse's {{law on the}} {{protection}} of the Jews in his territory expired in 1538, he commissioned Bucer to create a new policy. Philip gave him a draft that was tolerant in the regulation of their affairs. Bucer rejected the favourable conditions and recommended that Jews be prohibited from <b>all</b> <b>trades</b> except those providing minimum subsistence. [...] His Judenratschlag also included his first use of negative stereotypes of the Jews. Philip's ordinance of 1539 represented a compromise. He allowed the Jews to engage in trade and commerce but included strict rules on their association with Christians. The potential for an arbitrary enforcement of the new policy was frightening, and as a result many Jews chose to leave Hesse. For this Bucer must share part of the blame.|$|E
