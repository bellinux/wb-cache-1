5|$|Five {{weeks into}} the season, guard Howard Glenn broke his neck during a loss to the Houston Oilers, and died a few hours later, {{becoming}} the first player in professional football to die from injuries sustained on the field. New York suffered other injuries as the season progressed, and Wismer lacked the money to replace the injured players. Several players had to play both offense and defense. Wismer had arranged for the Titans to play three home games before their cross-river rivals, the Giants, started their season. This meant the Titans had to play their final three games on the road, and Wismer claimed to have lost $150,000 on the trip. The Titans finished their first season 7–7; according to attendance figures released by the team, the Titans drew an average of 16,375fans per game. This claim was mocked by the New York press, which reported that the fans had disguised themselves <b>as</b> <b>empty</b> seats. The New York Times estimated that the team had lost $450,000 for the season; in his autobiography, Wismer set the figure at $1.2million.|$|E
5|$|Webs are {{typically}} established in low-growing dune plants and other vegetation {{such as the}} native Pingao (Desmoschoenus spiralis) or the introduced marram grass (Ammophila arenaria). They may also build their webs under driftwood, stones, or other debris such <b>as</b> <b>empty</b> tin cans or bottles. Webs are almost always constructed over open sand and near the ground so as to catch crawling insects for food. Spiders inhabiting dune grasses construct their webs in open spaces between the grass tufts, while spiders inhabiting areas of shrubbery do so {{on the underside of}} a plant overhanging open sand. It has been found that these patches of open sand are necessary for katipo to build their webs as plants that envelop sand dunes in dense cover, such as exotic plants like kikuyu or buffalo grass, create an environment unsuitable for web construction. The katipo therefore prefers to spin its web amongst pingao plants as this plants growth pattern leaves patches of sand between each plant. The wind can then blow insects and other prey through these gaps and into the web. Marram grass has been extensively planted in New Zealand to help stabilise sand dunes and has largely replaced pingao in many areas. Because marram grass grows in a very tight formation only leaving small gaps between tuffs, this makes it difficult for the katipo to construct a suitable web for capturing prey.|$|E

Studies resumed starting 11 January, with IDF Home Front Command representatives stationed at schools. Only schools with fortified classrooms and bomb shelters were allowed to bring in children. Israeli Education Minister Yuli Tamir said she hoped a return to school would provide a little structure and routine {{in a time of}} great stress and uncertainty for the children. However, students were reluctant to return, with students at Sapir College in Sderot reporting less than 25 percent attendance.|$|E

25|$|The {{university}} broke {{ground on}} the new inpatient tower on April 9, 2012. At the time, the hospital was expected to cost $664 million and had been named the Jacobs Medical Center in honor of Irwin and Joan Jacobs donating $75 million toward its construction (they {{would go on to}} donate another $25 million). Over the next few years, construction costs continued to grow as health system officials decided to add a specialized surgical suite, operating rooms, an anatomic pathology lab, a cardiac rehabilitation program, a discharge pharmacy, and nursing administrative space. Additionally, it was determined that multiple floors which were originally planned <b>as</b> <b>empty</b> space would open {{with the rest of the}} hospital. The finished 509,500 sq ft, 245-bed tower cost $943 million and opened in November 2016.|$|E
25|$|VFAT Long File Names (LFNs) {{are stored}} on a FAT file system using a trick—adding (possibly multiple) {{additional}} entries into the directory before the normal file entry. The additional entries are {{marked with the}} Volume Label, System, Hidden, and Read Only attributes (yielding 0x0F), which is a combination that is not expected in the MS-DOS environment, and therefore ignored by MS-DOS programs and third-party utilities. Notably, a directory containing only volume labels is considered <b>as</b> <b>empty</b> and is allowed to be deleted; such a situation appears if files created with long names are deleted from plain DOS. This method {{is very similar to}} the DELWATCH method to utilize the volume attribute to hide pending delete files for possible future undeletion since DRDOS6.0 (1991) and higher. It is also similar to a method publicly discussed to store long filenames on Ataris and under Linux in 1992.|$|E
25|$|In {{classical}} Athens, it {{was used}} as an abbreviation for the Greek θάνατος (thanatos, “death”) and as it vaguely resembles a human skull, theta was used as a warning symbol of death, {{in the same way that}} skull and crossbones are used in modern times. It survives on potsherds used by Athenians when voting for the death penalty. Petrus de Dacia in a document from 1291 relates the idea that theta was used to brand criminals <b>as</b> <b>empty</b> ciphers, and the branding rod was affixed to the crossbar spanning the circle. For this reason, use of the number theta was sometimes avoided where the connotation was felt to be unlucky—the mint marks of some Late Imperial Roman coins famously have the sum ΔΕ or ΕΔ (delta and epsilon, that is 4 and 5) substituted as a euphemism where a Θ (9) would otherwise be expected.|$|E

25|$|During the Great Depression of the 1930s, {{through the}} years of World War II American art was {{characterized}} by Social Realism and American Scene Painting (as seen above) {{in the work of}} Grant Wood, Edward Hopper, Ben Shahn, Thomas Hart Benton, and several others. Nighthawks (1942) is a painting by Edward Hopper that portrays people sitting in a downtown diner late at night. It is not only Hopper's most famous painting, {{but one of the most}} recognizable in American art. It is currently in the collection of the Art Institute of Chicago. The scene was inspired by a diner (since demolished) in Greenwich Village, Hopper's home neighborhood in Manhattan. Hopper began painting it immediately after the attack on Pearl Harbor. After this event there was a large feeling of gloominess over the country, a feeling that is portrayed in the painting. The urban street is empty outside the diner, and inside none of the three patrons is apparently looking or talking to the others but instead is lost in their own thoughts. This portrayal of modern urban life <b>as</b> <b>empty</b> or lonely is a common theme throughout Hopper's work.|$|E

Whorf argued that by habitually speaking of the vapor-filled drums <b>as</b> <b>empty</b> and by extension as inert, the workers were oblivious to the risk posed by smoking near the [...] "empty drums".|$|E

500|$|The {{power of}} Saruman's voice is noted {{throughout}} the book. Jonathan Evans calls {{the characterization of}} Saruman in the chapter The Voice of Saruman a [...] "tour de force".

[...] Tom Shippey writes that [...] "Saruman talks like a politician ... No other character in Middle-earth has Saruman's trick of balancing phrases against each other so that incompatibles are resolved, and none comes out with words <b>as</b> <b>empty</b> as 'deploring', 'ultimate', worst of all, 'real'. What is 'real change'?" [...] Shippey contrasts this modern speech pattern with the archaic stoicism and directness that Tolkien employs for other characters such as the Dwarven King Dáin, which Shippey believes represent Tolkien's view of heroism in the mould of Beowulf.|$|E

[...] Satin published 75 issues of New Options from 1984 to 1992, virtually half a million words. [...] He wrote nearly all the articles. [...] In 1989 New Options received Utne Readers first [...] "Alternative Press Award for General Excellence: Best Publication from 10,000 to 30,000 Circulation". [...] In 1990 The Washington Post identified New Options as one of 10 periodicals spearheading [...] "The Ideology Shuffle".

Officials at the Langley Air Force Base in Hampton ordered about 6,000 workers to evacuate elsewhere, due to its vulnerability to flooding. About 350 National Guard workers assisted boat owners in the southeastern portion of the state. In Mathews County, two boat owners experienced fatal heart attacks as they worked to protect their boats. Officials distributed sandbags throughout the state for residents in flood-prone areas, including about 10,000 {{in the city of}} Alexandria. [...] Prior to the arrival of the hurricane, the Chesapeake Bay Bridge Tunnel was closed, as were all campgrounds along the Blue Ridge Parkway and the primary parkway in Roanoke.

500|$|One of the film's key contentions is {{that the}} private media aired footage {{selectively}} {{to make it look}} like the violence of 11April was caused by Chávez's supporters, portraying them as an [...] "irrational and uncivilized mob". Private television repeatedly showed Chávez's supporters on [...] as they shot at Baralt Avenue below, an area purportedly full of opposition marchers. The film says this footage was edited to show the gunmen but not the people near them who were ducking to avoid being shot. It follows with images taken from above the bridge showing an empty Baralt Avenue, claiming that [...] "the opposition march had never taken that route" [...] and that Chávez's supporters were only returning fire. Gunson charges that this edit is itself a misrepresentation, stating that the film does not mention that both sets of marchers were fired upon, and taking issue with the implication that [...] "coup plotters" [...] were the shooters. In response, the filmmakers say, [...] "Nowhere in the film did we say that only [...] were shot... Nobody can say with certainty who orchestrated the shootings." [...] Gunson also asserts that the footage of the empty street was taken earlier that day, citing an [...] "analysis of the shadows" [...] by Schalk, who created a counter-documentary, X-Ray of a Lie, to examine The Revolution Will Not Be Televised [...] "scene by scene to uncover [...] narrative strategies and use of artifice". Brian A. Nelson agreed with the analysis, claiming that Baralt Avenue was not <b>as</b> <b>empty</b> as the film portrays and that the filmmakers [...] "put a black bar at the top of the frame to hide the Metropolitan Police trucks that were still there". Bartley and ÓBriain reaffirmed their claim that the opposition did not pass below the Puente Llaguno bridge, citing eyewitness statements—including one from Le Monde Diplomatiques deputy editor—and an Australian documentary, Anatomy of a Coup, that [...] "came to conclusions similar to our own".
