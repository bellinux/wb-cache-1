40|$|Telomeres prevent {{chromosome}} fusions {{and degradation}} by exonucleases and are implicated in DNA repair, homologous recombination, chromosome pairing and segregation. All these functions of telomeres require {{the integrity of}} their chromatin structure, which has been traditionally considered as heterochromatic. In agreement with this idea, different studies have reported that telomeres associate with heterochromatic marks. However, these studies addressed simultaneously the chromatin structures of telomeres and subtelomeric regions or the chromatin structure of telomeres and Interstitial Telomeric Sequences (ITSs). The independent analysis of Arabidopsis telomeres, subtelomeric regions <b>and</b> <b>ITSs</b> has allowed the discovery of euchromatic telomeres. In Arabidopsis, whereas subtelomeric regions <b>and</b> <b>ITSs</b> associate with heterochromatic marks, telomeres exhibit euchromatic features. We think that this scenario {{could be found in}} other model systems if the chromatin organizations of telomeres, subtelomeric regions <b>and</b> <b>ITSs</b> are independently analyzed...|$|R

5|$|During the 5th century, Canterbury {{went into}} decline <b>and</b> <b>its</b> Roman {{institutions}} and buildings crumbled, although {{the city walls}} survived. In 597, Augustine was sent to Kent by Pope Gregory I to convert the local population to Christianity. Augustine established Canterbury Cathedral within the city, possibly because the walled site gave them additional protection or because it was symbolically important as a former Roman city. Canterbury, now called Cantwaraburh, prospered <b>and</b> <b>its</b> population and trade increased. Much of the land within the walls had become water meadows and farmland, and an palisade may have built around the cathedral <b>and</b> <b>its</b> precinct to form a secure inner stronghold.|$|E
