500|$|Shortly after {{returning}} from Havana to record the Buena Vista Social Club album, Ry Cooder began working with German film director Wim Wenders on the soundtrack to Wenders' film The End of Violence, the third such collaboration between the two artists. According to Wenders, it {{was an effort to}} force Cooder to focus on the project, [...] "He always sort of looked in the distance and smiled, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> was back in Havana." [...] Although Wenders knew nothing about Cuban music at the time, he became enthused by tapes of the Havana sessions provided by Cooder, and agreed to travel to the island to film the recording of Buena Vista Social Club Presents: Ibrahim Ferrer, the singer's first solo album, in 1998.|$|E
500|$|During a 2001 {{interview}} with Gary Graff from Wall of Sound Magazine, Maida recounted {{the inspiration for}} the lyrics of [...] "Are You Sad". He was in New York recording [...] "In Repair" [...] at the old Hit Factory studio, which was later known as Avatar Studios. Following those sessions, Maida attempted to call his younger brother from his hotel room but couldn't get through. [...] "When you're making a record, you kind of go into hiding, especially when I'm writing lyrics or writing music; I tend not {{to keep in touch with}} any friends or family or stuff. But my brother and I have a good relationship, and I want to keep it good. I couldn't get a hold of him for, like, a week, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> was going through a shitty time — typical young-20s, no job, having a tough life. I wanted to talk to him desperately, and this song just came out of me, [...] "Are You Sad?" [...] It came out really quickly on a shitty travel guitar". The meaning of [...] "If You Believe" [...] was revealed in a 2001 {{interview with}} Cleveland.com, [...] "That song's about having an out-of-body experience and seeing that the afterlife is real," [...] Maida confirms, [...] "and telling people that there's something machines can't have, and we've got it.|$|E

500|$|Sheen's {{breakthrough}} {{role was}} as British politician Tony Blair in 2003's The Deal. The Channel 4 film explored the so-called Granita pact made by Tony Blair and Gordon Brown {{prior to the}} 1994 Labour Party leadership election, and was the actor's first collaboration with screenwriter Peter Morgan. Director Stephen Frears cast him because [...] "he was in Mary Reilly <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> was brilliant." [...] Filmed while he was playing Caligula nightly on stage, Sheen has remarked, [...] "It's interesting that in searching for monsters to play, you often end up playing leaders." [...] The Daily Telegraph praised his [...] "earnest, yet steely, portrayal" [...] while The Guardian found him [...] "excellent. This is intelligent and honest casting." [...] In 2004, Sheen starred in ITV's Dirty Filthy Love, a comic film about a man dealing with OCD and Tourette's after a marital separation. Sheen spoke of [...] "treading a fine line" [...] because [...] "a lot of the symptoms are intrinsically comical". He {{was nominated for a}} BAFTA Award for Best Television Actor and a RTS Best Actor Award. Also in 2004, Sheen played a pompous rock star in the romantic comedy Laws of Attraction and produced and starred in The Banker, which won a BAFTA Award for Best Short Film. In 2005, Sheen starred in the National Theatre's production of The UN Inspector, a David Farr adaptation of The Government Inspector. The Times wrote of [...] "a scathingly brilliant and inventive performance" [...] while Variety noted that the actor [...] "adds comic finesse to his apparently ceaseless repertoire". The Evening Standard, while conceding that the performance was [...] "technically brilliant", expressed bemusement as to why [...] "one of the most mercurial and inspiring actors we have seems set on impersonating Rik Mayall throughout". Also that year, he took part in the Old Vic's 24 Hour Play, in which The Telegraph felt he [...] "dazzled". In 2005 film work, Sheen starred in Dead Long Enough, a small-budget Welsh/Irish film, with his longtime friend, Jason Hughes. In addition, he had a supporting role in Ridley Scott's Kingdom of Heaven, made a cameo appearance in The League of Gentlemen's Apocalypse and starred in the short film The Open Doors.|$|E
2500|$|Her name {{appeared}} {{extensively in}} the international press following the murder of Terre'Blanche on 3 April 2010. In {{an exclusive interview with}} the Daily Mail she revealed [...] "I suppose at some level I always thought he would come to a very violent end. He lived a violent existence <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> wasn't going to die peacefully in bed. I think he knew it too." [...] She also told the newspaper that she believed his murder was politically orchestrated. In 2012, Terre'Blanche's widow, Martie denied allegations of an affair between her late husband and Allan. Allan also reasserted that she believed affair allegations were orchestrated by South African intelligence services. Despite defending affair claims she made, Linda Shaw also agreed with Allan's assertion that intelligence services used the story to discredit Terre'Blanche and the far-right movement.|$|E
