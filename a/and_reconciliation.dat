Seven national events held between 2008 and 2013 commemorated the experience of former students of residential schools. In 2015, the TRC concluded with the establishment of the National Centre for Truth <b>and</b> <b>Reconciliation,</b> and the publication of a multi-volume report detailing the testimonies of survivors and historical documents from the time.|$|E

In 2014, the federal government ceased to contribute funds to Indigenous health {{organizations such as the}} AHF and the National Aboriginal Health Organization. Since then, more pressure has been placed on churches to sustain their active participation in these healing efforts.|$|E
5|$|Although {{not without}} conflict, European Canadians' early {{interactions}} with First Nations and Inuit populations were relatively peaceful. First Nations and Métis peoples {{played a critical}} part {{in the development of}} European colonies in Canada, particularly for their role in assisting European coureur des bois and voyageurs in the exploration of the continent during the North American fur trade. The Crown and indigenous peoples began interactions during the European colonization period, though the Inuit, in general, had more limited interaction with European settlers. However, from the late 18th century, European Canadians encouraged indigenous peoples to assimilate into their own culture. These attempts reached a climax in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with forced integration and relocations. A period of redress is underway, which started with the appointment of the Truth <b>and</b> <b>Reconciliation</b> Commission of Canada by the Government of Canada in 2008.|$|E

Following the end of military rule and return of democracy to Chile in 1990, investigation of human rights violations became a top priority. Though a 1978 amnesty decree prevented prosecution for pre-1978 offenses, the new Aylwin government sought disclosure of the truth and recompense for the victim's families and appointed a National Commission for Truth <b>and</b> <b>Reconciliation.</b> The commission's February 1991 Rettig Report named victims disappeared shortly after the coup, executed by gunshot, and presumed {{to be buried in}} Patio 29.

Kennedy returned to Indiana and on April 10 delivered his third and final speech inspired by King's death.

5|$|The {{compensation}} package {{led to the}} Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement (IRSSA), {{announced on}} May 8, 2006, and implemented in September 2007. At the time, there were about 86,000 living victims. The IRSSA included funding for the AHF, for commemoration, for health support, and for a Truth <b>and</b> <b>Reconciliation</b> program, {{as well as an}} individual Common Experience Payment (CEP). Any person who could be verified as having resided at a federally run Indian residential school in Canada was entitled to a CEP. The amount of compensation was {{based on the number of}} years a particular former student resided at the residential schools: $10,000 for the first year attended (from one night residing there to a full school year) plus $3,000 for every year thereafter.|$|E
5|$|The four {{churches of}} the IRSSA– the United, Roman Catholic, Anglican and Presbyterian churches– agreed to {{participate}} in the reconciliation process between Indigenous and settler Canadians.

The Anglican Church of Canada set up the Anglican Healing Fund in the 1990s to respond to the ongoing need for healing related to residential schools. In the 2000s the United Church established the Justice <b>and</b> <b>Reconciliation</b> Fund to support healing initiatives and the Presbyterian Church has established a Healing & Reconciliation Program.|$|E
