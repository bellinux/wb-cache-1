30|$|In (2), it {{is noted}} that the {{effectiveness}} of HEQ-FC {{is directly related to the}} reliable estimation of both reference and test CDFs. A better CDF estimation can be achieved by using a larger <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>sample</b> data. Due to its relatively large <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>sample</b> data in the training phase, the reference CDF can be well estimated by the classical cumulative histogram approach. However, current speech recognizers frequently employ a short utterance or word as their input unit. In this case, the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>sample</b> data can be insufficient for the reliable estimation of the test CDF. In this test environment, the reliable estimation of the test CDF is an important issue for the effective HEQ-FC. When the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>sample</b> data is small, the order statistic-based CDF estimation method can be more reliable than the classical histogram-based approach due to its enhanced probabilistic resolution. A brief algorithm of the order statistics-based CDF estimation is given as follows [13].|$|R

Since the coarse pores are most important for water infiltration, gas exchange and transport, focusing on them when measuring the porosity and the diffusion coefficient is recommended. Data gained at a laboratory are reliable as long as a certain <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples</b> has been analyzed. That is why it is highly necessary to gather a large number of soil samples throughout the entire sample plot you are interested in.|$|E

The result is that a computer running 64-bit OS was needed and simple Windows XP and 2GBs of data may not cut it. Other criticisms include the note of the wobbliness of some of the solo samples and while the Bass were [...] "gutsy" [...] and the sopranos [...] "ethereal" [...] it was difficult to make samples switch roles. Focusing on the high price, the product was given an overall mixed review and it was noted due to the high price some seeking such a product may be better off if the software offered a quarter of the content at a lower price.|$|E

[...] Unlike the band's other songs in the era, the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples</b> in the song is kept to a minimum, with the only apparent samples being a constant ticking of clocks and a crowd chanting in the distance. Nonetheless, Ewing stated that [...] "The Last Dance" [...] is also the band's [...] "wisest, most moving song, a meditation on history, on the impossibility of making something new in art and {{on the need to}} try and do so anyhow. It’s also their most musically endearing, a tune as taut and poignant as anything Wire ever recorded, with delicate guitar lines meshing and weaving, always pretty but always understated." ...|$|E

50|$|Gels {{can vary}} in size. The <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples</b> {{to be run}} will {{determine}} the appropriate gel size. All gels are divided into lanes that run parallel through the gel. Each lane will contain a specific sample. Typically, molecular-weight size standards are placed in an outer lane. If a gel has a particularly high number of lanes, then multiple ladders may be placed across the gel for higher clarity. Proteins and standards are pipetted on the gel in appropriate lanes. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) interacts with proteins, denaturing them, and giving them a negative charge. Since all proteins have the same charge-to-mass ratio, protein mobility through the gel will solely be based on molecular weight. Once the electric field is turned on, protein migration will initiate. Upon completion, a detection mechanism such as western blotting can be used, which will reveal the presence of bands. Each band represents a specific protein. The distance of travel is solely based on molecular weight; therefore, the molecular weight of each protein can be determined by comparing the distance of an unknown protein to the standard of known molecular weight.|$|E

High predictive power, i.e. level A-B, was achieved for N, where {{a high number of}} samples was available for model development. Whereas the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples</b> was also high for C, the specific value range was very restricted with 95 % of the measured C concentrations between 48.8 % and 49.3 % and a difference between the minimum and maximum C concentration of only 9 %.

The maximum Lyapunov exponents in the two kinds of structural monitored data are both over zero, indicating that in the structural system chaos phenomenon has appeared. And, experiments {{have shown that the}} maximum Lyapunov exponent is sensitive of the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples</b> and the time delay. So, to compute the chaos index, the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples</b> and the time duration are of importance. Meanwhile, the Lyapunov exponent spectrum entropy is effective to measure the chaotic characteristic of the system, but,the entropy is less sensitive to state recognition more than the max Lyapunov exponent...|$|E

So, the reference CDF can be obtained quite reliably. On the other hand, at the test phase, when short utterances are to be recognized, the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>sample</b> data may be insufficient for the reliable estimation of the test CDF. In this case, many researches [27, 24, 25] used the order statistics to compute the test CDF.|$|R

The proposed scheme exploits the temporal {{pattern of the}} sensed process {{to reduce the number}} of samples sent back by a sensor node to the sink and decrease the energy consumption in data transmission. The proposed scheme is orthogonal to the techniques that reduce the spatial density of collected samples deactivating nodes with similar measurements. Thus, the proposed scheme can be used along with these techniques. Results show that for very regular processes the scheme can reduce around 90 % the total <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples</b> sent in the network and even for less regular processes the proposed scheme can reduce between 10 and 20 % the total <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>samples</b> sent with small reconstruction errors.

30|$|The initial biopsy {{failed to}} {{definitively}} diagnose esophageal metastasis in {{almost half of}} the cases. This is because metastatic lesions are often located in the submucosa, and mucosal biopsy generally does not provide a sufficient <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>sample</b> for definitive diagnosis. We did not use a special method for biopsy; however, we could collect a sufficient <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>sample,</b> including submucosal tissue, for diagnosis of esophageal metastasis in this case. According to Matsumoto et al.
