40|$|Intumescent {{material}} with commercial <b>resin,</b> such as <b>acrylic</b> <b>copolymer</b> <b>resin,</b> {{has been demonstrated}} to be extremely effective in improving the fire performance of wooden materials used for indoor furnishing. This study investigates the enhancement of painted thin red lauan (Parashorea spp.) plywood by using intumescent coating with organo-clays added with different types of Cloisite 30 B, Cloisite 10 A and Cloisite 15 A and different amounts of organo-clays (1, 3, 5 and 10 %). These intumescent formulations significantly enhanced the fire retardancy of painted plywood, exhibiting lower peak heat release rates (PHRR) and extending the time to reach PHRR, as compared with plywood panels coated with intumescent coating with absence of organo-clay. Therefore, the amount of organo-clays added in intumescent is important. In additional, 3 % of Cloisite 30 B and 5 % of Cloisite 10 A further enhanced fire retardancy. The FT-IR, (27) Al and (31) P NMR analyses demonstrated that adding organo-clay extended the survival duration of the phosphor-carbonaceous chars structure. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.

30|$|Among 165 {{samples taken}} from the tower for a {{complete}} technical study, a total of 24 samples containing arsenic sulfide pigment and sampled on different floors were selected. The samples were numbered P 201.061 to P 210.036 for archiving. They were then mounted as cross-sections (C 87.129 to C 90.158) {{in order to be}} analyzed. The cross-sections were prepared by embedding the samples between acrylic resin cubes. The bulk sample was first fixed to a 1  cm 3 poly(methyl methacrylate) cube using a white PVA glue, after which the <b>acrylic</b> <b>copolymer</b> <b>resin</b> (Spofacryl®, Spofa Dental CZ- 10031, Prague) was poured on the sample and the second cube placed on top.

Then, polishing was continued in set circumstances using Micro Mesh© polishing cloths in a sequence of grits (2400, 4000, 6000 and 8000  mesh) leading to a mirror-like surface. In the case of the reference samples, a JEOL Cross Section Polisher IB- 09010 CP (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) was used for 12  hours with a 4.0  kV accelerating voltage, 4.4 argon gas flow and a swinging stage.

Another firm, Canadian Electro Products of Shawinigan, Quebec, invented polyvinyl acetate {{which was used}} in <b>copolymer</b> <b>resins</b> <b>and</b> water-based paints. The wartime production of nitrocellulose naturally led to the manufacture at Shawinigan in 1932, of transparent cellulose film used for packaging. What is now called fibreglass was invented in the US in 1938 at Owens-Corning by Russell Games Slayter and introduced to Canada shortly thereafter. Aluminum also became popular. In 1902, attracted by the availability of cheap hydro power, the Aluminum Company of America established a Canadian subsidiary, the Northern Aluminum Company (Alcan) at Shawinigan Falls, Quebec to produce that metal using the electrolysis technique. Corporate changes {{led to the creation}} of the Aluminum Company of Canada (Alcan) in 1925 and in 1926 the company constructed a giant aluminum smelter at a place it named Arvida, Quebec. Once again the site was chosen for the availability of cheap hydro electricity and the proximity of a deep-water port at Bagotville for large ships carrying bauxite or aluminum ore. World War II accelerated the demand for aluminum, which was the principal material in aircraft production and the Arvida facility was greatly expanded. In 1958 another huge Alcan smelter was built at Kitimat, British Columbia.|$|R

Mixtures of polystyrene-block-polyisoprene-block-polystyrene (SIS triblock) <b>copolymers</b> with <b>resin</b> <b>and</b> their blends with polystyrene-block-polyisoprene (SI diblock) copolymers were investigated experimentally and theoretically. The experiments involved small-angle X-ray scattering, atomic force microscopy, and tensile measurements, while the theoretical analysis invoked a mesoscopic representation of SBC materials {{combined with a}} continuum, 3 D real-space self-consistent-field (SCF) approach. The calculations predict that the SBC systems should become microphase separated, with PS-rich spherical domains forming a bcc lattice in SIS triblock/SI diblock blends and in SIS triblock/resin systems with low resin content (20 wt %), while at high (60 wt %) resin content a disordered structure of PS-rich domains is expected. Extensive comparisons of SCF predictions concerning the type and the geometric characteristics of the morphologies obtained, the composition profiles, {{and the effect of}} diblock <b>and</b> <b>resin</b> content on the long-range space ordering of the PS-rich domains are performed against the experimental data. SCF theory predicts that approximately 79 % of SIS molecules are connecting different PS-rich domains (i. e., are forming bridges) in SIS/SI blends, almost independently of the SI diblock content. The SCF results are combined with a slip tube model of rubber elasticity to predict the elastic behavior of SBC materials. In particular, the bridging properties are used to estimate the PS-rich domain cross-linking contribution, G(c), to the total shear modulus.

40|$|Toner resins are {{polymeric}} {{materials used in}} the manufacturing of toners {{to be used in}} the photocopy machines and LaserJet printers. The popular commercial resins are the styrene <b>acrylic</b> <b>copolymers.</b> A typical toner resin has a bimodal molecular weight distribution, having one fraction of lower molecular weight and another of higher molecular weight, so that it can impart good fixing and offset properties to provide the performance of a good toner. This research project describes the synthesis of toner resins by suspension polymerization, using poly(vinyl alcohol) and benzoyl peroxide as a colloid stabilizer and initiator respectively, in an aqueous medium to produce the copolymers in the form of tiny beads. Three series of experiments were carried in the study: (i) synthesis of low molecular weight styrene <b>acrylic</b> <b>copolymers,</b> (ii) synthesis of high molecular weight styrene <b>acrylic</b> <b>copolymers</b> and (iii) blending the both high and low molecular weight copolymers at different ratios to obtain the desired properties. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was used to study molecular weight distribution (MWD); melt flow index (MFI) reflected the flow ability of resin; Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) was used to study the thermal properties; and acid number (AN) to quantify the amount of acidic groups in the resin. The effects of monomer ratio, concentration of initiator and concentration of crosslinking agent on the properties of high and low molecular weight resins had been investigated. The desired glass transition temperature of toner resin was obtained by varying the monomer ratio. By increasing the concentration of initiator, the number average of molecular weight of resin tends to shift to lower molecular weight presumably due to the excess free radicals that could lead to more chain termination and chain transfer reactions. The addition of cross-linking agent leads to gel formation. The percentage of tetrahydrofuran (THF) insoluble fraction has increased as the concentration of cross-linking agent was increased. The properties of synthesized toner resins were compared to those of selected commercial resins. The synthesized resins after blend at different ratios have glass transition temperature in the range of 56 - 69 oC; MFI in the range of 13 – 55 g/ 10 min; AN in the range of 2. 5 - 3. 4 mg KOH/g; Mw in the range of 7. 00 x 103 – 3. 20 x 103 Daltons (1 Daltons = 1. 66 x 10 - 27 kg) with 9 - 14...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The unique {{physical}} properties of leather make it ideally {{suited for the}} manufacture {{of a variety of}} products. Retanning has important effects on the mechanical and {{physical properties}} of the resultant leather. In this paper, a novel amphoteric <b>acrylic</b> <b>copolymer</b> as retanning material was prepared by free radical copolymerization. The effects of this copolymer on the physical properties of the resultant leather have been investigated by measuring physical and mechanical indexes of the retanned leather. The function mechanism of this copolymer was also researched. Results showed that this copolymer could improve the properties of the resultant leather including softness and strength, and increase leather’s dyeability in contrast to anionic acrylic polymer...|$|R
40|$|Soluble, {{branched}} (meth) <b>acrylic</b> <b>copolymers</b> {{have been}} made via facile, one-step, batch solution polymerisations taken to high conversion. Methyl methacrylate has been copolymerised with a bifunctional monomer using a chain transfer agent to inhibit gelation. Conventional chain transfer using a mercaptan {{has been compared to}} catalytic chain transfer (CCT) using a cobalt porphyrin. The polymerisations have been monitored as a function of monomer conversion and the polymer prepared at high conversion has been fractionated across the molecular weight distribution. The polymerisations remain isotropic, with both the chemical composition and physical architecture distribution varying systematically as a function of monomer conversion and copolymer molecular weight. A mechanism for the polymerisation is proposed based on the experimental data...|$|R
