40|$|A heavily used {{competitive}} tactic in {{the grocery}} business is the weekly <b>advertising</b> <b>of</b> <b>price</b> <b>reductions</b> in newspaper inserts and store fliers. Store managers commonly believe that advertisements of price reductions and loss leaders help to build store traffic by diverting customers from competing stores, thereby increasing store volume and profitability. It is therefore not surprising that grocery retail planners across competing stores expend considerable thought on what items to advertise each week and at what levels of prominence. What is surprising, however, is that we marketing scientists do not {{know much about the}} manner and extent to which feature advertising in a competitive environment influences where and how customers shop. The marketing science literature has not even been able to establish that feature advertising has a substantial impact on store choice, let alone the more operational question of which categories are better at drawing consumers away from one store and into a competing store. In this paper we employ a stochastic choice modeling framework to propose and empirically estimate a disaggregate, consumer-level model of the effects of feature advertising on store choice. We use this model to understand which categories are more influential drivers of store traffic and better at diverting consumers from competing stores. ...|$|E
40|$|At first sight, <b>price</b> <b>reduction</b> is not {{considered}} to be a general remedy for breach of contract or force majeure in Belgian law. Nevertheless, <b>price</b> <b>reduction</b> as a remedy is recognized in article 50 of the CISG, in Dutch law (partial termination), in the European initiatives of harmonization of private law (DCFR and PECL), and in a proposalnbsp;a regulation on a Common European Sales Law (CESL). First, we will discuss specific applications (in sales and tenancy contracts) <b>of</b> <b>price</b> <b>reduction</b> as a remedy for partial failure to fulfill obligations in situations of force majeure and of imputable shortcomings. A clear example <b>of</b> <b>price</b> <b>reduction</b> in Belgian law is the actio quanti minoris (Art. 1644 CC) in sales contracts. Another example is the custom in French and Belgian law to remedy small shortcomings (e. g. in quality or in quantity) in the performance with a réfaction (i. e. a <b>price</b> <b>reduction</b> in commercial sales contracts).

There are some doubts about the justification of creating funds for <b>price</b> <b>reduction</b> and commercial risks. Repricing does not take place only in Poland. Other countries also apply various systems of building up reserves to finance the effects <b>of</b> reduced <b>prices</b> as well as various mean of stimulating demand. The aim of this paper is to consider how to take advantage of the wide experience of the trade abroad to increase the effectiveness of the Polish repricing system. The first part of the paper deals with principles <b>of</b> <b>price</b> <b>reduction</b> in the socialist countries where in spite of similar forms of governing the repricing systems differ considerably. Principles of creating and using the repricing funds in Poland, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, Bulgaria, Rumania and Czechoslovakia are presented in that part. In order to give a picture how repricing is carried out in different market conditions the experiences of the Jugoslavian and Swedish trade are shown. In the second part of the paper an analysis is made, aiming at an improvement of the Polish system <b>of</b> <b>price</b> <b>reduction</b> and taking into account foreign solutions.

40|$|Damages are {{considered}} the primary remedy in English sales law. This remedy has also been adopted in the Convention on Contracts for the International Sale <b>of</b> Goods. However, <b>price</b> <b>reduction</b> seems to be of a higher importance than damages in the latter legal regime, while the Sale of Goods Act (SGA) has excluded the remedy <b>of</b> <b>price</b> <b>reduction.</b> It remains unanswered whether {{it is time for}} English law to introduce <b>price</b> <b>reduction</b> in the SGA so that it can add significantly practical advantage to the current remedies available to a commercial buyer. This article seeks to explore the appropriateness <b>of</b> <b>price</b> <b>reduction</b> in comparison with its leading competitor—that is, damages. To do this, the article examines the distinctions between damages and <b>price</b> <b>reduction</b> against a novel evaluative framework that provides an appropriate mechanism for analysing the relationship of doctrine to commercial utility necessary for the buyer. This framework consists of four norms: certainty, performance interest, efficiency, and relational theory of contract. However, it proves difficult to determine which remedy could most effectively address and satisfy the particular needs of a commercial buyer. Damages are likely to provide very similar practical solutions to <b>price</b> <b>reduction</b> once a sales contract is breached, and this may constitute the reason why the SGA excluded <b>price</b> <b>reduction</b> in business-to-business transactions and why no serious attempt has been carried out to include this remedy within this particular legal regime...|$|R

The value <b>of</b> <b>price</b> risk <b>reduction</b> is discussed to some length in general terms in the literature reviewed but, so far, no methodology for calculating the value has been presented. Here we suggest such a method. The problem <b>of</b> valuating <b>price</b> risk <b>reduction</b> is approached using a variation of the Black–Scholes model by considering a hypothetical financial instrument that a consumer would purchase to insure herself against unexpected price hikes. This hypothetical instrument is then compared with an actual energy efficiency investment that reaches the same level <b>of</b> <b>price</b> risk <b>reduction.</b> To demonstrate the usability of the method, case examples are calculated for typical single-family houses in Finland. The results show that the price risk entailed in household energy consumption can be reduced by a meaningful amount with energy efficiency investments, and that the monetary value of this reduction can be calculated. It is argued that this often-overlooked benefit of energy efficiency investments merits more consideration in future studies...|$|R

Our objective is to explore the impact <b>of</b> future <b>price</b> <b>reductions</b> caused by increasing uptake on HTAs and decision making for medical devices. Methods: We demonstrate {{the use of a}} two-stage modelling approach to derive estimates <b>of</b> technology <b>price</b> as a consequence of changes in technology uptake over future periods based on existing theory and supported by empirical studies. We explore the impact on cost-effectiveness and expected value of information analysis in an illustrative example based on a technology used in pre-term birth screening that is in development. Results: The application of our approach to the case study technology generates smaller incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) compared to the commonly used single cohort approach. The extent of this reduction of the ICER depends on the magnitude <b>of</b> the modelled <b>price</b> <b>reduction,</b> the speed <b>of</b> diffusion and the length of the assumed technology-life horizon. Results of value of information analysis are affected through changes in the expected net benefit calculation, the addition of uncertain parameters and the diffusion-adjusted estimate of the affected patient population. Conclusions: Since modelling future changes in price and uptake has the potential to affect HTA outcomes, modelling techniques that can address such changes should be considered for medical devices that may otherwise be rejected...|$|R
