Laboratory analyses revealed very low protein S levels as well as anticardiolipin antibodies. Aggressive treatment by low-molecular-weight heparin, steroids, intravenous immunoglobulins and fresh frozen plasma was able to prevent the extension of the lesions and to correct the coagulation abnormalities. No lesions required skin grafting. As in our patient, an acquired protein S deficiency is probably responsible for most cases of purpura fulminans occurring after varicella, but the concomitant presence of antiphospholipid antibodies may also play a role...|$|E

40|$|Because {{licensure}} of <b>a</b> <b>chickenpox</b> (varicella) {{vaccine is}} likely soon, {{it is important}} to ascertain the age-specific incidence of chickenpox. Increasing vaccine coverage and a resulting decrease in transmission may result in an accumulation of susceptible adults, followed by a shift of incidence into those older age groups in future years. Valid baseline age-specific incidence will make it possible to detect this phenomenon. Two studies were conducted in Kentucky to assess age-specific incidence of chickenpox. The first assessed chickenpox occurrence in two consecutive school-year cohorts of children from a geographically representative sample of Kentucky primary schools. The second gathered information from household members of those persons interviewed in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System telephone survey. The age-specific rates are remarkably similar between studies. Rates peak during the preschool and kindergarten years (ages 3 - 6). Approximately 20 percent of children remain susceptible to chickenpox after age 8 in both studies. The results from these two surveys will be valuable baselines for comparison with findings in incidence studies that will be performed after vaccine licensure...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to compare female child-care providers with female university workers and with mothers of children in child-care centers for: (1) frequency of illness and work loss days due to infectious diseases, (2) prevalence of antibodies against measles, rubella, mumps, hepatitis B, hepatitis <b>A,</b> <b>chickenpox</b> and cytomegalovirus (CMV), and (3) status regarding health insurance and job benefits. ^ Subjects from twenty child-care centers and twenty randomly selected departments of a university in Houston, Texas were studied in a cross-sectional fashion. ^ A cluster sample of 281 female child-care providers from randomly selected child-care centers, a cluster sample of 286 university workers from randomly selected departments and a systematic sample of 198 mothers of children from randomly selected child-care centers. ^ Main outcome measures were: (1) self-reported frequency of infectious diseases and number of work-days lost due to infectious diseases; (2) presence of antibodies in blood; and (3) self-reported health insurance and job benefits. ^ In comparison to university workers, child-care providers reported a higher prevalence of infectious diseases in the past 30 days; lost three times more work-days due to infectious diseases; and {{were more likely to have}} anti-core antibodies against hepatitis B (odds ratio = 3. 16 95 % CI 1. 27 - 7. 85) and rubella (OR 1. 88, 95 % CI 1. 02 - 3. 45). Child-care providers had less health insurance and job-related benefits than mothers of children attending child-care centers. ^ Regulations designed to reduce transmission of vaccine and non-vaccine preventable diseases in child-care centers should be strictly enforced. In addition policies to improve health insurance and job benefits of child-care providers are urgently needed. ...|$|E

40|$|Introducción: La varicela es una enfermedad de distribución mundial con una elevada morbilidad y pocas complicaciones, aunque puede presentar cuadros clínicos graves en inmunodeprimidos y adultos sanos. El objeto de este estudio es identificar y describir las características y los costes de un brote epidémico en Extremadura, cuya tasa anual de casos declarados al sistema de Enfermedades de Declaración Obligatoria (EDO) oscila en alrededor de 5 por 1. 000 habitantes. Métodos: Estudio descriptivo con búsqueda activa de casos entre los meses de noviembre del año 2000 y marzo de 2001, y de la susceptibilidad de la cohorte escolarizada del colegio de Herrera del Duque (Badajoz). Las definiciones de casos fueron recogidas de los protocolos de la Red de Vigilancia de la comunidad extremeña. La confirmación microbiológica se realizó por aislamiento del virus y por presencia de marcadores IgM e IgG en el suero del enfermo. Se analizaron los costes tangibles directos e indirectos y los no tangibles del brote. Resultados: De los 75 casos identificados, 71 (94, 7 %) eran niños de entre uno y 9 años, predominando el sexo masculino. La tasa de ataque fue de 18, 5 casos por 1. 000 habitantes, y del 68, 2 % en convivientes menores de 10 años. La evolución fue benigna, sin ingresos hospitalarios ni complicaciones. Se encontró un 71, 6 % de niños {{susceptibles}} en los de entre 3 y 8 años. Se analizó una posible agregación temporal de casos en el colegio, obteniéndose un riesgo relativo (RR) de 5, 01 (p Introduction: Chickenpox is {{a worldwide}} disease with high morbidity but few complications, although complications can be sevre in immunocompromised individuals and healthy adults. The annual chickenpox rate declared to the National Notification Disease Surveillance System is approximately 5 cases per 1, 000 inhabitants in Extremadura (Spain). The {{aim of this}} study was to identify and describe the characteristics and cost of an epidemic outbreak of chickenpox in Extremadura. Methods: Between November 2000 and March 2001, a descriptive study was performed. Cases of chickenpox were actively sought in a cohort of schoolchildren in Herrera del Duque (Badajoz). The protocols of the Monitoring Network of the Autonomous Community of Extremadura was used for case definition. Microbiological confirmation was performed by isolation of the virus and the presence of IgM and IgG markers in serum. We analyzed the direct and indirect tangible costs as well as the intangible costs of the outbreak. Results: Seventy-five cases were identified, of which 94. 7 % occurred in children aged between 1 - 9 years, mainly boys. The attack rate was 18. 5 cases per 1, 000 inhabitants and 68. 2 % occurred in children aged less than 10 years charing a home. The clinical course was benign, without hospital admissions or complications. A total of 71. 6 % of children aged between 3 and 8 years were susceptible. A possible temporary aggregation of cases in the school was analyzed and a relative risk of 5. 01 (p < 0. 0001) was obtained. The virus was isolated in the 4 vesicle samples studied and serology was positive (IgM) in the 9 serum samples studied. The total cost of the outbreak was of 927, 21 e, with a mean of 12, 53 e per case and 205 school days lost. Conclusion: <b>A</b> <b>chickenpox</b> outbreack was confirmed in Herrera del Duque, with person-to-person transmission, affecting children aged between 1 and 9 years. The high susceptibility of the pupils, the characteristics of teaching, and the meetings prior to the carnivals played a determining role in the transmission of the epidemic. The estimated cost of this outbreak was 76 % less than the cost that would have been generated by single-dose vaccination of the 75 individuals who contracted the disease...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{estimate}} the nonhospital costs of treating chickenpox and {{to ascertain the}} opinion of parents regarding the usefulness of vaccination. DESIGN: Retrospective postal survey. SETTING: Province of Quebec. PARTICIPANTS: Random sample of 3333 families with children aged six months to 12 years. OUTCOME MEASURES: For cases of chickenpox that occurred between September 1, 1997 and August 31, 1998, the use of health services, time away from school or work, patient care required, direct and indirect costs for the families and the health care system, and the opinion of parents regarding chickenpox and the vaccine were evaluated. RESULTS: The response rate was 64. 7 %, and 18. 8 % of households reported <b>a</b> history of <b>chickenpox,</b> <b>a</b> total of 693 cases. A physician was consulted in 45. 8 % of these cases, and medication was used in 91. 7 %. The frequency of hospitalizations was 0. 6 %.
