5|$|Although the ZX Microdrive was {{initially}} greeted with good reviews, it never took {{off as a}} distribution method due to worries <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> the cartridges and piracy. Hence the main use became to complement tape releases, usually utilities and niche products like the Tasword word processing software and Trans Express, (a tape to microdrive copying utility). No games {{are known to be}} exclusively released on Microdrive.|$|E
5|$|The {{whole point}} is that we are the song. The self is coming from a state of pure awareness, from the state of being. All the rest that comes about in the outward manifestation of the {{physical}} world (including all the fluctuations which end up as thoughts and actions) is just clutter. The true nature of each soul is pure consciousness. So the song is really about transcending and <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> the transcendent.|$|E

5|$|Despite his {{successes in}} America, the Australian Swimming Union {{did not offer}} to fund a return home for Brooks for the 1982 Australian Championships, but the University of Arkansas paid his fare {{as a reward for}} his {{performances}} in collegiate competition. Despite failing to defend his 100m title, he qualified for the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane. The team then went into a five-week training camp in the seaside Sydney suburb of South Coogee. The team resided at a migrant hostel, which at the time was primarily occupied by Vietnamese refugees from the Vietnam War. Brooks spoke out <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> the accommodation, leading officials to make improvements.|$|E
5|$|The {{complaints}} from the SS-FHA <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> Volksdeutsche recruits {{had no effect}} on Berger's approach. He concluded further agreements with Hungary and Romania, and imposed on the puppet regimes of the Independent State of Croatia and the Slovak State, to effectively authorise the unrestricted conscription of ethnic Germans in those territories. In the German-occupied territory of Serbia, the General Government (annexed Poland) and parts of the Soviet Union, ethnic Germans were conscripted into the Waffen-SS in the same arbitrary manner Reich Germans were conscripted by the Wehrmacht. By the end of 1943, a quarter of the strength of the Waffen-SS was made up of Volksdeutsche.|$|E
5|$|The film had regular showings in many theaters worldwide, {{with many}} as a monthly event.

Wiseau has claimed that it was his intent for audiences to find humor in the film, although viewers and some of the cast members generally have viewed it as a poorly-made drama.|$|E

5|$|Beer {{was such}} an {{important}} consumable to Americans that they would closely watch the stocks of barley held by farmers to ensure quality beer production. In John Adams' correspondence with his wife Abigail, he asked <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> barley crops to ensure adequate supply {{for the production of}} beer for himself and their friends. However, hops, essential to production of beer, did not grow well in the colonies. It only grew wild in the New World, and needed to be imported from England and elsewhere. In addition to these alcohol-based products produced in America, merchants imported wine and brandy. Beer was not only consumed for its flavor and alcohol content, but because it was safer to drink than water, which often harbored disease-causing microorganisms. Even children drank small beer.|$|E
5|$|In {{parallel}} with his RGS duties Markham served {{as secretary of}} the Hakluyt Society until 1886, subsequently becoming that society's president. As part of his work for this body, Markham was responsible for many translations from Spanish into English of rare accounts of travel, in particular those relating to Peru. In time scholars would express doubts <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> some of these translations, finding them prepared in haste and lacking in rigour. Nevertheless, this work ran to 22volumes in the society's publications. In 1873 Markham had been elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in subsequent years received several overseas honours, including the Portuguese Order of Christ and the Order of the Rose of Brazil. He briefly considered, but did not pursue, the idea of a parliamentary career.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, American general Stephen Van Rensselaer III, a Federalist {{political}} appointee, {{in command}} of a sizable army near Lewiston, was pressured by the American president to invade. Although Van Rensselaer had severe doubts <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> his troops, {{he had no choice}} but to attack. He was an inexperienced militia general, and not trusted by the majority of regular army troops. In the early morning of 13 October 1812, he attempted to cross the Niagara River, leading to the Battle of Queenston Heights. Despite heavy fire from British artillery, the first wave of Americans (under Captain John E. Wool) managed to land, and then follow a fishermen's path up to the heights. From this point, they attacked and routed the British artillery. Brock had arrived from nearby Fort George and moved up to the artillery battery to gain a better view only minutes before Wool attacked. He, his aides, and the gunners were forced to beat a hasty retreat, leading their horses down the steep slope.|$|E
5|$|The {{men in the}} Castle Inn {{retreated to}} Penydarren House, who were joined by the initial {{reinforcements}} from the Yeomanry, bringing the establishment's numbers to around 300, {{not all of them}} were armed and able to fight. They faced increasingly well-armed insurgents and Bute became increasingly concerned <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> the opposition facing his men. Bute sent spies into the insurgency, and nearby Cyfarthfa Castle was pressed into service as an observation post. Bute mobilised military pensioners, and used them to start to bring Penydarren House additional weaponry from Cardiff; he was advised to be careful, however, in case the shipments fell {{into the hands of the}} insurgency. Morgan's forces were able to prevent the radical crowds from entering either Penydarren or Cyfartha, and Bute arrested potential insurgents in Cardiff.|$|E
5|$|There were {{complaints}} that year from officials {{at all three}} of the mints concerning the quality of the coins produced. In the summer of 1874, coiner A. Loudon Snowden issued a formal complaint to Pollock <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> the strikings, most notably on the high points of the design; Barber began modifying the design later that year, reducing the relief. The modified dies began service in 1875. In the fall of that year, Linderman suggested that the reverse of the trade dollar should be altered in 1876 to commemorate the centennial of American independence; Pollock opposed the idea, noting that such a change would be difficult to carry out because Congressional approval would be necessary and that it might cause the coin to lose favor in the Orient. In May 1876, former assistant engraver Anthony C. Paquet created a reverse die after being hired by Linderman to improve the striking quality of the coins. Linderman approved of the new design, but it was ultimately rejected by Mint officials due to fears of Chinese disapproval.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} 1990s the West Indian team {{had begun to}} decline. It was {{defeated}} by Australia in a 1994–95 series, the Third Test of which was played at the Queen's Park Oval, as {{were two of the}} ODI matches. The ground hosted two Tests of the 1997–98 tour by England, the second of which in February saw the West Indies defeated by England. The West Indian captain during the match, Brian Lara, went on to be the leading run scorer at the Queen's Park Oval in ODI matches, as well as hold record for the highest score made there. The West Indies lost heavily again to Australia at the ground in 1999, by a margin of 312 runs. This, the opening Test of the series, set the tone for a five-nil whitewash of the host team by the visiting Australians. The retirement of Ambrose and Courtney Walsh in 2001 further hampered West Indian efforts, and they were defeated at the Queen's Park Oval by South Africa in March, and India in August 2001. They were likewise defeated in ODI matches at the ground by both sides. The West Indies dropped to eighth in the Test rankings, with another heavy loss at the Queen's Park Oval against England in 2004, amid complaints <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> the pitch from England players. The West Indies also suffered at the hands of South Africa during ODI matches played at the ground.|$|E
