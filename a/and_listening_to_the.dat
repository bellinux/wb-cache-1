5|$|In August 1996, Radiohead toured as {{the opening}} act for Alanis Morissette. They resumed {{recording}} {{not at a}} studio but at St. Catherine's Court, a 15th-century mansion near Bath.

25|$|In February 2010, Stefan Gates {{presented}} a half-hour BBC Radio 4 documentary entitled Stefan Gates's Cover Story, about {{his part in}} the making of the album cover. Gates claimed in the documentary to have felt there was something sinister about the image, although his sister disagreed. He also admitted never having heard the album. The programme ended with Gates returning to Giant's Causeway <b>and</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> album on a portable player, after which he claimed that a great weight had been lifted from him.|$|E

25|$|Schmid and {{his friends}} took Rowe to the desert, where Schmid and Saunders murdered her. Before murdering Alleen, Schmid told Saunders to rape her, but he couldn't do it, because Saunders was gay. While the murder occurred, Mary French {{was waiting in the}} car <b>and</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> radio. Afterwards the three buried her. When Alleen went missing, her father told her mother he felt she had been murdered and left in the desert. The mother, Norma Rowe, went to the police and was told that she needed more {{evidence}} before they could go looking in the desert.|$|E
25|$|As an {{alternative}} to the power suit, the safari jacket, Nehru suit and Mao suit remained popular in Australia, South Africa, India, China, and Zaire, where it was known as an Abacost and worn with a leopard print hat resembling the Astrakhan cap. At the same time, young African dandies known as sapeurs rebelled against the post-decolonisation government's suppression of Western fashions by investing in expensive designer suits from Italy and France <b>and</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> soukous music of Papa Wemba. This continued until the kleptocratic dictator Mobutu's deposition and death in the late 1990s, when the outbreak of a civil war in Zaire resulted in the sapeurs' disappearance until the 2010s.|$|E
25|$|Research {{suggests}} that specific leisure interventions enhance feelings of SWB. This {{is both a}} top-down and bottom-up effect, in that leisure satisfaction causally affects SWB, and SWB causally affects leisure satisfaction. This bi-directional effect is stronger in retired individuals than in working individuals. Furthermore, it appears that satisfaction with our leisure at least partially explains the relationship between our engagement in leisure and our SWB. Broadly speaking, researchers classify leisure into active (e.g. volunteering, socializing, sports and fitness) and passive leisure (e.g. watching television <b>and</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> radio). Among older adults, passive leisure activities and personal leisure activities (e.g. sleeping, eating, and bathing) correlate {{with higher levels of}} SWB and feelings of relaxation than active leisure activities. Thus, although significant evidence has demonstrated that active leisure is associated with higher levels of SWB, or happiness, {{this may not be the}} case with older populations.|$|E

25|$|Both {{before and}} since DAB launched, other mediums of {{transmitting}} <b>and</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> radio have expanded. In 1989, cable television subscribers in the Saltash area could hear some BBC Radio stations on their television sets {{for the first}} time. With the expansion of digital cable television, many more radio stations have been added. With the expansion of satellite television too, many stations, including others from the European continent and beyond are available. The BBC added radio to UK Gold in 1993 on the Astra satellite, and subsequent satellites and services have been extended since then. The expansion of Freeview, and its subsequent replacement in Cornwall in 2009 of existing analogue television services is perhaps {{going to have the}} greatest impact. The internet, with thousands of radio stations streaming online, and the expansion of broadband has meant that radio reception has diversified in the number of stations that can be heard, and it is no longer restricted to crackles and night time fading of a few stations of old.|$|E
25|$|In 1865, Ward {{relocated}} to Chicago, {{where he worked}} for Case and Sobin, a lamp house. He traveled for them as salesman, and sold goods on commission for a short time. Chicago {{was the center of}} the wholesale dry-goods trade, and in the 1860s Ward joined the leading dry-goods house, Field Palmer & Leiter, forerunner of Marshall Field & Co. He worked for Field for two years and then joined the wholesale dry-goods business of Wills, Greg & Co. In tedious rounds of train trips to southern communities, hiring rigs at the local stables, driving out to the crossroads stores <b>and</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> complaints of the back-country proprietors and their rural customers, he conceived a new merchandising technique: direct mail sales to country people. It was a time when rural consumers longed for the comforts of the city, yet all too often were victimized by monopolists and overcharged by the costs of many middlemen required to bring manufactured products to the countryside. The quality of merchandise also was suspect and the hapless farmer had no recourse in a caveat emptor economy. Ward shaped a plan to buy goods at low cost for cash. By eliminating intermediaries, with their markups and commissions, and drastically cutting selling costs, he could sell goods to people, however remote, at appealing prices. He invited them to send their orders by mail and he delivered the purchases to their nearest railroad station. The only thing he lacked was capital.|$|E
500|$|I was {{listening}} to the radio and heard 'Genius of Love', and I hadn't heard it in a long time.

[...] However, Earlewine's review was mixed, arguing that the band's humor and gimmicks wore thin over an entire album.|$|E
500|$|Lee {{was born}} as Ryan Anthony Massaro in 1977 and {{was raised in}} Kensington, Philadelphia. He moved to [...] Cherry Hill, New Jersey at age 11 and {{graduated}} from Cherry Hill High School East. Lee attended the University of South Carolina and graduated {{with a degree in}} English and a minor in education. During his college years he developed an interest in music after being inspired by the John Prine album, Great Days. During this period he began playing the guitar and bass as part of a band (Hot Lava Monster) <b>and</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> music of Donny Hathaway, Joni Mitchell, Luther Vandross, Bill Withers and Otis Redding.|$|E

That whole first week I was there we worked on the 'Woods' song, which is called 'Lost in the World'.

500|$|The {{development}} team {{wanted to}} have a Western singer contribute to the score. Mitsuda initially had difficulties finding an artist that matched his vision, but eventually chose Joanne Hogg from the Celtic band Iona after stumbling upon their album The Book of Kells in a CD store <b>and</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> song [...] "Chi-Rho". Hogg was enthusiastic in contributing as it was her first video game-related recording. She did not play the game for the project, however. Irish music was not well known in Japan at the time, but Mitsuda felt that a [...] "Celtic boom" [...] was about to hit the country. His prediction would later turn true with the popularity of the American film Titanic and the Irish stepdancing show Riverdance.|$|E
500|$|I {{try not to}} get too {{specific}} so {{that people}} can apply the lyrics to their own lives. When I was growing up <b>and</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> radio and I would hear a song that reminded me of a certain person or a situation or whatever, I would {{want to be able to}} completely connect it to that moment. And then if I heard someone explaining it and making it into something totally different, it ruined it for me. So I kind of like to keep it open for people's imaginations. It evokes something different depending on who listens to it and at what time. [...] "Don't Forget About Us" [...] could give you a good, happy memory, or you could be miserable, crying, listening to it over and over. All in all, I think it's good to have music you can live vicariously through, and that's what a lot of people have told me this record has been for them.|$|E
500|$|The {{gameplay}} mostly {{consists of}} reading <b>and</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> conversations provided. Every now and then, a [...] "Please Select Your Destiny" [...] event will occur, giving the player multiple choices {{on how to}} respond. The choices selected determine who will be Rin's destined love; depending on which route the player takes, there will be between 8 and 12 multiple-choice questions. At {{a certain point in}} the visual novel, a translucent image of the destined character appears when the day changes indicating who Rin has fallen in love with after which the multiple-choice events become almost nonexistent. Near the end of the game, two sex scenes will occur. After some more conversation the visual novel ends. After the visual novel has been completed at least once, players can view CG (computer graphics) artwork they have observed, skip to scenes or endings for characters they have viewed, and listen to music they have heard in the game.|$|E

However, vandals attacked St. Joseph's Seminary in Yonkers, New York, by spray-painting a large pentagram {{in front of}} the doors, black inverted crosses in two columns {{in front of the}} main entrance, and the number six on three steps leading into the Seminary. The words [...] "Reign in Blood" [...] were scrawled on the seminary landing, while the phrase [...] "Better to reign in Hell than to serve in Heaven", taken from Book 1 of John Milton's [...] poem Paradise Lost, was found inscribed on two inside columns.

The oldest of three sisters, {{including}} Danielle and Elizabeth, she moved with her family to Waldorf, Maryland, soon after her birth. Milian was four years old when she showed an interest in show business, and when her family realized that she was a talented actress, she became determined to pursue an entertainment career. As a child, Milian was [...] "very imaginative and very creative", and watching television <b>and</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> radio became her life. They inspired her to have fun, and she convinced her parents that she [...] "did not want to be inside the TV", although it took some time to convince them. By the time she was nine years old, Milian had begun auditioning with local talent agencies, shot commercials for Wendy's and Honeycomb, and played the lead role in the musical Annie. Milian's mother noticed her daughter's potential and left her husband and moved to Los Angeles with her three daughters when Milian was 13 years old. Her father had to stay in Maryland and divorced her mother soon after the move.|$|E
