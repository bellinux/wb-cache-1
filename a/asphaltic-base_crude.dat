40|$|Contamination of soils with {{crude oil}} {{deriving}} from e. g. exploration and processing of petroleum is of major environmental concern. The various compounds {{of crude oil}} are used to produce prod-ucts such as gasoline, kerosene propane, fuel oil, lubricating oil, wax, and asphalt (Atlas 1995). Based {{on the nature of}} the hydrocarbons (HC), crude oil can be classified into three groups: (i) paraffin-based crude oils; (ii) <b>asphaltic-base</b> <b>crude</b> oils and (iii) mixed-base crude oils (Cleveland 2007). Additionally, petroleum contains a complex mixture of compounds which can be categorized into four fractions: saturates, aromatics, resins and asphaltenes (Killops and Al-Jaboori 1990, Outdot et al. 1998). In several oil-producing countries, crude oil is one of the most important contaminants of soils and sediments. Large areas have been contami-nated with petroleum oil near the oil refineries and oil storage tanks. Crude oil may cause land degradation by affecting plants and soil micro-organism. These harmful effects depend on the concentration and type of contaminant (Boethling and Alexander 1979). Bioremediation techniques have become a major tool to enhance natural biodegradation of crude oil residuals (based on indigenous microorganisms). Among the different techniques to enhance natural biodegradation by indigenous microorganisms, inoculation with hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria and fertilizing the indigenous population have attracted the most interest. The application of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorous was shown to be most effective in accelerating the Effect of N and P fertilisation and aeration on biodegradation of crude oil in aged hydrocarbon contaminated soil...|$|E
