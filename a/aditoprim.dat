40|$|ABSTRACT The {{pharmacokinetics}} of <b>aditoprim,</b> a not yet commercialized selective reversible inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase, {{were determined}} in turkeys after intravenous (5 mg/kg BW) and oral (5. 46 ±. 44 mg/kg BW) administration. The mean (± SD) {{total body clearance}} of 26. 9 ± 2. 3 mL/min per kg BW was high when compared with that determined for other species, presumably {{a consequence of the}} higher metabolic rate of birds. Consequently, mean <b>aditoprim</b> elimination half-life was relatively short (3. 3 ±. 2 h). As determined in mammalian species, the apparent volume of distribution at steady state was large. <b>Aditoprim</b> in drinking water (100 and 300 mg/L water) provided plasma concentrations between. 08 and. 19 /*g/mL. Circadian rhythms with highest concentrations in the late afternoon and lowest concentra-tions in the morning were observed. Despite its short elimination half-life, <b>aditoprim</b> may still be a valuable antimicrobial for use in avian medicine pending safety, efficacy, and residue depletion studies...|$|E
40|$|The title compd. (I), an {{intermediate}} for antibacterial <b>aditoprim,</b> useful in veterinary medicine, is prepd. via bromination or chlorination of 4 -(dimethylamino) benzonitrile (II), {{treatment of the}} resulting 3, 5 -dibromo- (III) or -dichloro- 4 -(methylamino) benzonitrile with alkali methoxide {{in the presence of}} Cu and DMF or dimethylacetamide, methylation of the resulting 3, 5 -dimethoxy- 4 -(methylamino) benzonitrile (IV), and redn. of the resulting 3, 5 -dimethoxy- 4 -(dimethylamino) benzonitrile. II in MeOH was brominated with aq. HBr, the resulting III treated with MeONa/MeOH and CuCl, and the resulting IV methylated with HCO 2 H/paraformaldehyde followed by redn. with Raney Ni to give I...|$|E
