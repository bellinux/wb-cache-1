The floor panels, consisting of calcium sulphate, feature unique dimensions of 500 x 500 mm and are applied with a special scratch-resistant covering made of galvanised steel sheets. The covering is an exclusive design by Lindner. The pinnacle of the cylindrical building, which has a base of 45 m in diameter, is crowned by a dome.|$|E
50|$|On January 1, 2016, {{the company}} {{acquired}} White Enterprises, which added Tate <b>access</b> <b>flooring</b> to the company's product line. <b>Access</b> <b>flooring</b> {{is also known}} as raised flooring, and is used in certain business applications, such as for data centers.|$|R
40|$|There is {{a current}} trend towards ever more slender {{concrete}} floor structures, which is resulting in more frequent {{problems with their}} vibration serviceability. Predictive methods for vibration serviceability must consider not only the structures themselves, but also the non-structural elements which are attached to them, as these may {{have a significant effect}} on the dynamic characteristics of the floor structural system. As there has been very little past research in this area, this thesis describes an investigation into the effects of raised <b>access</b> <b>floors</b> on the vibration serviceability of long-span concrete floors. The development of a new modal testing facility based on electrodynamic shaker excitation, which was capable of producing high quality estimates of the modal properties of full-scale floor structures, is described. This was subsequently utilised to determine the modal properties of three full-scale floor structures, before and after the installation of various configurations of raised <b>access</b> <b>floors.</b> The response of these structures to controlled pedestrian excitation was also measured. Realistic finite element models of all structures were developed and updated using the results from the experimental work. These were subsequently utilised for investigation of the experimentally measured effects of the raised <b>access</b> <b>floors.</b> It was found that raised <b>access</b> <b>floors</b> had only minor effects on the modal properties of the long-span concrete floors. Reductions in natural frequencies due to the increased mass were, to some extent, offset by the slight increases in stiffness following the installation of the <b>access</b> <b>floors.</b> Modal damping ratios increased for some modes of vibration, but these changes were rather unpredictable and hence they were too unreliable to be used in design. The response of the structures under controlled pedestrian excitation reduced following the installation of various configurations of raised <b>access</b> <b>floors.</b> The reduction appeared to be greater for relatively deep <b>access</b> <b>floors</b> (500 - 600 mm) than for relatively shallow <b>access</b> <b>floors</b> (150 - 200 mm). Therefore, it is recommended that the effects of <b>access</b> <b>floors</b> may be included in vibration serviceability analyses by applying a reduction factor to predicted responses calculated by assuming a bare floor. The proposed reduction factors are 0. 9 for <b>access</b> <b>floors</b> where the finished floor height is less than 500 mm and 0. 8 for <b>access</b> <b>floors</b> where the finished floor height is 500 mm or greater...|$|R
40|$|A {{facility}} for the structural testing of General <b>Access</b> <b>Flooring</b> panels has been constructed and is operational.

At least 16 panels and 65 pedestals must be supplied for all sixteen tests to be performed. " [...] p. (ii) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{elevators}} {{in each of}} {{the residence}} halls are divided based on a low rise and high rise system. In Morrill, the low rise elevators go to floors 1, 3-14 and the high rise elevators goes to floors 1,3, 15-23. Only authorized officials can <b>access</b> <b>floor</b> 2 using the elevators. In Lincoln, low rise elevators reach floors 1-14, while high rise elevators reach floors 1,2, and 15-23. Each side of the building has 3 elevators.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} {{features an}} environmentally friendly raised floor underfloor air system. Conditioned air for the occupants {{is provided by}} multiple environmental air towers located in the tenant space that deliver 62 F air into a raised <b>access</b> <b>floor</b> plenum. This underfloor air system provides users {{with the ability to}} control their own space temperature as well as improving the ventilation effectiveness. When building churn occurs, workstation moves can be performed more easily with lower cost and less product waste.|$|E
50|$|Many office {{buildings}} now use access flooring {{to create more}} flexible and sustainable spaces. When underfloor air is designed into a building {{from the start of}} the project, the building can be less expensive to build and less expensive to operate over the life of the building. Underfloor air requires less space per floor, thereby reducing the overall height of the building, which in turn reduces the cost of the building facade. The blowers and air handlers required for underfloor air are much smaller and require less energy, since hot air rises naturally through the space as it comes in contact with people and equipment that warm the air and it rises to the ceiling. Additionally, when buildings are designed to combine modular electrical, modular walls, and <b>access</b> <b>floor,</b> the space within the building can be reconfigured in a few hours, as compared to historical means of demolishing walls and drilling holes in the floor to route electrical and other services. As more companies construct or renovate buildings to meet LEED (Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design) underfloor air and <b>access</b> <b>floor</b> usage will continue to grow. The USGBC (United States Green Building Council) states that 40-48% of new nonresidential construction is green.|$|E
50|$|The type {{of floor}} a {{facility}} uses can also greatly affect its air flow capabilities and limitations. Specifically, a raised floor allows for under-floor cable management {{as well as}} air flow. There are two main classifications of such <b>access</b> floors: low-profile <b>floors</b> (under 6 inches in height) as well as standard/traditional <b>access</b> <b>floors</b> (over 6 inches).|$|R
50|$|Although it {{does not}} yet have the same {{cultural}} significance as the 109 Building, it is a prime retail and office destination. The public <b>access</b> <b>floors</b> (floors 1 - 11) are marked by glass-walling, allowing for views across Shibuya and Tokyo.|$|R
50|$|The {{mezzanine}} {{level of}} the office building includes a fitness center and central mechanical room. The 3rd through 29th floors are typical office <b>floors</b> complete with <b>access</b> <b>flooring</b> and nine foot ceilings.

50|$|The RB-47H and ERB-47H {{were highly}} capable aircraft, but the EWO {{compartment}} {{was not only}} cramped with sitting room only, but also had both poor noise insulation and climate control. This made 12-hour missions very uncomfortable and tiring, and some sources say that the Crows even {{had to deal with}} fuel leaks on occasion. Successful ejection downward (cutting through the belly radome) was impossible on-or-near the ground. Crows sat bobsled-like on the pilot compartment <b>access</b> <b>floor</b> for takeoff and landing; having to crawl encumbered with Arctic clothing with parachute to-from their compartment along an unpressurized maintenance shelf during temporary level-off at 10000 ft.|$|E
50|$|Specific space {{considerations}} {{should be}} taken when using UFAD systems in laboratories because of its critical room pressurization requirements and potential migration of chemicals into the <b>access</b> <b>floor</b> plenum due to spillage. UFAD systems are not recommended in some specific facilities or spaces, such as small non-residential buildings, wet spaces like restrooms and pool areas, kitchens and dining areas and gymnasiums, because UFAD may result in especially difficult or costly in design. UFAD systems may also be used with other HVAC systems, like displacement ventilation, overhead air distribution systems, radiant ceiling or chilled beam systems to get better performance.|$|E
50|$|The system {{manufacturer}} {{should have}} {{a sufficient number of}} types, sizes, and shapes of speakers available so it can accommodate a wide variety of masking applications, possibly on the same project. The system should be able to handle indoor and outdoor applications, large, small, or no plenum ceilings, and large or small <b>access</b> <b>floor</b> cavities. Both loudspeakers and vibration devices should be available. For visible masker locations, speaker shape and color must be acceptable to the owner. The system should be able to incorporate paging and music; it increases system utility and provides an economic advantage to the user. The system should be able to equalize the spectrum and level at least in each zone.|$|E
30|$|Fragility {{groups that}} {{significantly}} contribute to repair costs {{were identified as}} structural components, glass curtain wall cladding, wall partitions, suspended ceilings, HVAC equipment, and office equipment. Negligible costs were associated with stairs, <b>access</b> <b>flooring,</b> elevators, piping, fire sprinkler systems, and electrical systems. This novel finding will enable future seismic performance assessments to include only the fragility groups critical to repair costs in order to decrease computational effort.|$|R
50|$|The {{conceptual}} design {{calls for a}} slender cone with convex, gently curved sides. An exterior of pale-coloured glass draws inspiration from Korean ceramics and features accents of metal filigree. Located near the Han River, the tower is planned to contain retail outlets (floors 1-12), offices (14-38), residences (42-71), a luxury hotel (76-101), private office (105-114), and public <b>access</b> <b>floors</b> (117-123) with an observation deck.|$|R
30|$|Figure  10 {{indicates}} that significant repair costs {{are produced by}} the fragility groups of structural components, glass curtain wall cladding, wall partitions, suspended ceilings, HVAC equipment, and office equipment. Fragility groups with negligible contributions to repair costs are stairs, <b>access</b> <b>flooring,</b> elevators, piping, fire sprinkler systems, and electrical systems. Future seismic performance studies may exclude the fragility groups with negligible repair costs in order to decrease the required computation time.|$|R

50|$|Temperature {{control and}} the {{production}} of some of its energy are accomplished in an environmentally friendly manner for the tower. Insulated glazing reduces thermal loss, lowering energy consumption and increasing transparency.

When building churn occurs, workstation moves can be performed more easily with lower cost and less product waste. The cooling system produces and stores ice during off-peak hours, and allows the ice to melt to help cool the building during peak load, similar to the ice batteries in the 1995 Hotel New Otani Tokyo in Japan. Ice batteries have been used since absorption chillers first made ice commercially available 150 years ago, before the invention of the electric light bulb.|$|E
5000|$|The Discovery Offices Building is {{constructed}} using a concrete manufactured with slag, {{a byproduct of}} blast furnaces. The mixture used in the tower concrete is 55% cement and 45% slag. The use of slag cement reduces damage to the environment by decreasing the amount of cement needed for the building, which in turn lowers {{the amount of carbon}} dioxide greenhouse gas produced through the normal cement manufacturing process. Each ton of regular cement produced creates about one ton of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Temperature control and the production of some of its energy are accomplished in an environmentally friendly manner for the tower.

50|$|Each {{shelving}} unit is normally {{mounted on a}} level trackway (to eliminate gradients in the supporting floor), {{making it possible to}} move heavy units with minimal effort. Mobile shelving can be moved manually or by the use of electrical motors. The track/flooring can either sit on top of an existing floor or be integrated into raised <b>access</b> <b>flooring</b> allowing for a smooth transition between unit and surrounding floor levels.|$|R
50|$|A {{raised floor}} (also raised <b>flooring,</b> <b>access</b> <b>floor(ing),</b> or raised <b>access</b> {{computer}} <b>floor)</b> provides an elevated structural floor above a solid substrate (often a concrete slab) {{to create a}} hidden void for the passage of mechanical and electrical services. Raised floors are widely used in modern office buildings, and in specialized areas such as command centers, IT data centers and computer rooms, {{where there is a}} requirement to route mechanical services and cables, wiring, and electrical supply. Such flooring can be installed at varying heights from 2 in to heights above 4 ft to suit services that may be accommodated beneath. Additional structural support and lighting are often provided when a floor is raised enough for a person to crawl or even walk beneath.|$|R
50|$|Stairs {{may be a}} {{required}} component of egress from structures and buildings. Stairs are also provided for convenience to <b>access</b> <b>floors,</b> roofs, levels and walking surfaces not accessible by other means.

Stairs are also a subject used in art to represent real or imaginary places built around impossible objects using geometric distortion, as in the work of artist M. C. Escher.|$|R
50|$|Unlike masking {{speakers}} above {{a suspended}} ceiling or under a raised <b>access</b> <b>floor,</b> the masking sound from face-down speakers travels directly {{down to a}} listener {{without the benefit of}} any intervening sound attenuating materials. Face-down speakers have been, for many years, typical for paging and music systems, but is now used more recently in some sound masking applications. Initially, the intention was to minimize the visibility of the speaker by having a ceiling-like tile act as a masking speaker. It was first introduced by Bertagni and later commercialized by the Armstrong Company. The picture on the upper right shows a plenum view of this masker. The lower side appears to be a standard fiberglass mineral tile. Because so many devices penetrate ceilings, this speaker's invisibility is appealing to architects. The technical difficulty in developing this product was in broadening the spread of the masking to overcome the lack of intervening material, but the masking spectrum can be adjusted to those typical of those recommended by consultants.. A more recent development was the introduction of a face-down masking speaker much smaller than those used for paging systems. The lower picture shows this masker. Because of small size this masker has a masking spectrum that is not in the range of spectra recommended by consultants. See the recommendations section below. These speakers are often called direct field speakers to distinguish them from the other arrays that radiate sound indirectly through intervening materials. Although the speaker locations in the previous sections are often preferred to increase sound diffusion and acceptability, there are situations where use of direct field speakers is advantageous. An alternative location for the small speakers is mounting on a wall.|$|E
40|$|Raised <b>access</b> <b>floor</b> panels {{currently}} have a chipboard core and are encapsulated within {{thin layer of}} galvanised steel. Two key problems with these raised <b>access</b> <b>floor</b> panels are that they are heavy because of the chipboard and expensive, {{as the cost of}} steel has increased significantly over the past few years. The consequence of the raised <b>access</b> <b>floor</b> panel’s mass is that they are difficult to handle, they are expensive to transport and they add considerably to the load on a structures foundation. Glass fibre filled epoxy of floor panels were designed and optimised to achieve lighter weights without compromising their strength using Altair Hypermesh software. A material weight reduction of the glass fibre filled epoxy floor panel was achieved by optimised design of the panes using an evolutionary structural optimisation (ESO) method and the introduction of panel ribs. The lighter weight of new raised floors panel would {{have a significant impact on}} the loadings of buildings foundation and allow architects to reduce the carbon footprint of a building resulting in reduced construction costs. In addition, a reduction in the weight of the new raised <b>access</b> <b>floor</b> panels would reduce the transportation costs of the panels...|$|E
40|$|<b>Access</b> <b>floor</b> {{are raised}} floor systems {{consisting}} of modular panels supported by posts {{at a certain}} height to create a gap below the floor surface.

This paper presents the results of two measurement campaigns carried out using the procedures given by EN ISO 140 - 6 and 140 - 12 standards. A stage of measurement has been performed on different <b>access</b> <b>floor</b> configurations, obtained by changing different floor elements, such as panels, surface finishes and damping materials under the posts base, in order to optimize their acoustic performance.

40|$|The European {{standard}} EN ISO 140 - 12 : 2000 gives {{a methodology}} {{to measure the}} acoustic performance of access floors {{in terms of both}} airborne and impact sound insulation. Access floors are often used in office buildings and working environments as they create a hollow space below the floor surface for network cabling and electrical wiring: in this way they are useful from the functional (ease of inspection, repair and changing of system elements), the aesthetic (no exposed wires and elements) and acoustic point of view. This paper presents the measurement procedures used at the Acoustic Laboratory of the University of Perugia – Italy, in order to perform the tests defined by the EN ISO 140 - 12. The standard requires the measurement of two parameters, Ln,f e Dn,f, that qualify respectively the airborne and the impact sound insulation trough an <b>access</b> <b>floor,</b> and the calculation of the two corresponding single number indexes Ln,f,W e Dn,f,W.
