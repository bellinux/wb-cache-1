5|$|By 1912, the use {{of horse}} and buggy {{had fallen out of}} fashion, and the Burnside Fountain saw little use in its {{intended}} purpose. By 1939 citizens of Worcester were already calling for the fountain to be moved to a more suitable place where it could be of more use. It took until 1969 for the Burnside Fountain to be moved from Central Square. It was relocated to the Worcester Common <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> Salem Square. One year later, in May 1970, the statue was ripped from its pedestal and stolen. It was returned later that same year, but it took until 1972 for the boy and turtle to be placed back on top of the basin. Another apparent theft attempt happened in 2004 when the bronze sculpture was toppled off its pedestal and left dangling off the basin. The city was quick to fix the statue this time, with it being righted and reattached within days.|$|E
500|$|The John F. Adams House, listed {{incorrectly}} as the John E. Adams House by the National Register of Historic Places, is {{a historic}} house at 11 Allen Avenue in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. The house's unique exterior and architecture was described in the multiple property submission which described it as the [...] "finest late Italianate dwelling still standing in Pawtucket." [...] Its design {{is similar to the}} dwellings designed by Henry Austin and features Moorish window hoods and Indian porch columns. The John F. Adams House was moved back [...] <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> Allen Avenue after it was purchased by the Beacon Oil Company in 1929. This minor move was found not to make it ineligible because of the house's architectural and historical significance. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.|$|E
2500|$|On 28 December 1929 — {{which would}} be known {{thereafter}} as [...] "Black Saturday" [...] — New Zealand military police fired upon a peaceful demonstration which had assembled to welcome home A.G. Smyth, a European movement leader returning to Samoa after a two-year exile. Reports of the massacre are sketchy because the official cover-up for the incident was so effective. Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III had rushed {{to the front of}} the crowd <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> his people; he called for peace from them because some were throwing stones at the police. With his back to the police calling for peace he was shot in the back; another Samoan who rushed to help him was shot in both legs while cradling his head. Another who had attempted to shield his body from the bullets was shot. Two more rushing to help were killed before they could reach him.|$|E

2500|$|In December 1840, Colonel Harney {{finally got}} revenge for his humiliation on the Caloosahatchee River. He led ninety men into the Everglades from Fort Dallas on the Miami River, {{traveling}} in canoes {{borrowed from the}} Marines. They were guided by a black man named John {{who had been in}} Seminole captivity for a while. The column encountered some Indians in canoes and gave chase, catching some of them and promptly hanging the men. When John was having trouble finding the way, Harney tried to force the captured Seminole women to lead the way to the camp, reportedly by threatening to hang their children. However, John got his bearings again and the Harney party found the camp of Chakaika and the 'Spanish Indians'. Dressed as Indians, the soldiers approached the camp early in the morning, achieving surprise. Chakaika was outside the camp when the attack started. He started to run and then stopped <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> the soldiers, offering his hand, but one of the soldiers shot and killed him. There was a brief fight during which some of the Indians escaped. [...] Harney had two of the captured warriors hanged, and had Chakaika's body hung beside them. Harney and his men returned to Fort Dallas after twelve days in the Everglades. Harney had lost one soldier killed. His command had killed four Indians in action and hanged five more. The Legislative Council of Florida presented Harney with a commendation and a sword, and Harney was soon given command of the Second Dragoons.|$|E

60|$|He let {{his hand}} fall <b>to</b> his side, <b>and</b> <b>turned,</b> fully <b>to</b> <b>face</b> her.|$|R
50|$|He then kills off the {{remaining}} henchman (besides Ice) and corners a helpless Milverstead. Wielding a samurai sword {{he took off}} one of the henchman, he chops a sobbing Milverstead's head off <b>and</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> Ice. He quickly beats (but does not kill) Ice, avenging his friend's death. He goes back to LA with Kristy and her daughter to start a new chapter of his life.|$|R
60|$|He {{rose from}} his chair and, with a fine show of indignation, thrust the gasping Bassett from the room, <b>and</b> then <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> the girl.|$|R
60|$|Philippa {{laid down}} the book which she had been reading, <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> her husband. He made a little grimace.|$|E

50|$|The game {{begins with}} three {{cardboard}} cutouts moving into position against a blank wall <b>and</b> <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> the player. The cutouts display {{a mixture of}} gangsters and innocent/friendly people; the player must react quickly and shoot only the gangsters. In later rounds, the backdrop changes from the blank wall to a city block, with some cutouts already exposed as they emerge into view. The player is confronted with five cutouts {{in each of these}} latter rounds.|$|R

Instead she went to New York and {{became a member of the}} chorus of [...] "The Rose of America," [...] and Mr. Wodehouse is enabled to lift the curtain of the musical comedy world.|$|R
60|$|But, try as he would, {{the panel}} would yield neither to cunning nor force, so that {{eventually}} {{he gave it}} up <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> me.|$|E
60|$|He {{closed the}} window, <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> his companion. He was himself again, and calm, {{for all that}} his face was haggard beyond its wont.|$|E
60|$|While still pondering {{over his}} letter {{he heard the}} rustle of a woman's dress <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> the princess, in {{magnificent}} attire, her gloved hand extended toward him, her face radiant with pleasure.|$|E
50|$|Early {{the next}} morning, John is awakened {{to hear the}} sounds of police combing the woods calling his name. He has overslept. He quickly throws on some clothes and begins to run through the woods, but townspeople have now taken up the search for John. He runs at first, but he {{suddenly}} gives up trying to escape his pursuers <b>and</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> them, looking skyward. The townspeople have found him first. He knows his fate, and the townspeople club him before the police arrive.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said the}} lady, {{stopping}} also, <b>and</b> <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> him, [...] "you did, and {{you ought to}} remember it. You said if I had a husband to travel about with me you would like very much to employ me {{in the search for}} Mr Keswick, and it was solely on that account that I went and got married." [...] Observing the look of blank and utter amazement on his face, she smiled, and said: [...] "Please don't look so horribly astonished. Mr Null is void." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Let them bury {{me after}} the fashion of my people, Macumazahn, and set my eyes towards Zululand;' and he {{took my hand and}} shook it, <b>and</b> then <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> the {{advancing}} foe.|$|R
60|$|But Merapi {{had seen}} or felt Seti {{advancing}} {{from the shadows}} and seeing flung herself upon his breast. He {{kissed her on the}} brow before them all, then bade me hold her up <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> the people.|$|E
60|$|We {{found her}} {{kneeling}} before the Crucifix, telling her beads; and we stood waiting {{a few moments}} in silence until with a sigh and a rustle of her stiff black dress she rose gently <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> us.|$|E
60|$|The American {{saw that}} the two were {{pressing}} Butzow much too closely for safety and that Coblich had now recovered {{from the effects of}} the blow and was in pursuit, drawing his saber as he ran.

60|$|I {{had been}} {{thinking}} very busily, and the peasant's words had illumined for me a score of little obscure matters, had explained to me the queer behaviour and the odd speeches of Fifanti himself since that evening in the garden when the Cardinal-legate had announced to him his appointment as ducal secretary.

60|$|The {{young woman}} {{did as she}} was bid, and when she had taken her place <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> him the boy threw the ball to her.

5000|$|Sal tells Ace she'll {{only give}} up the map if he refuses to kill Duke and Chester, but instead he forms a posse to dispose of them.

The ice splits, leaving Sal and Chester on one side, and Duke {{on the side of the}} mob. He throws the map, wishes them well <b>and</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> the mob.|$|R
