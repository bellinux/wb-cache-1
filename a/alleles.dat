5|$|Selfish alleles– non-{{addictive}} <b>alleles</b> {{are unable}} to replace addictive <b>alleles</b> during recombination but the opposite is able to occur.|$|E
5|$|These <b>alleles</b> do {{not account}} for all dominantly {{inherited}} white spotting in horses. More KIT <b>alleles</b> {{are expected to be}} found with roles in white spotting. Most W <b>alleles</b> each occur within a specific breed or family and arise as spontaneous mutations. The KIT gene itself seems prone to mutation, and so new <b>alleles</b> of W could occur in virtually any breed.|$|E
5|$|When {{multiple}} different <b>alleles</b> for a gene {{are present}} in a species's population it is called polymorphic. Most different <b>alleles</b> are functionally equivalent, however some <b>alleles</b> can give rise to different phenotypic traits. A gene's most common allele is called the wild type, and rare <b>alleles</b> are called mutants. The genetic variation in relative frequencies of different <b>alleles</b> in a population is due to both natural selection and genetic drift. The wild-type allele {{is not necessarily the}} ancestor of less common <b>alleles,</b> nor is it necessarily fitter.|$|E
5|$|According to Mendelian inheritance, {{variations}} in an organism's phenotype (observable physical and behavioral characteristics) are {{due in part}} to {{variations in}} its genotype (particular set of genes). Each gene specifies a particular trait with different sequence of a gene (<b>alleles)</b> giving rise to different phenotypes. Most eukaryotic organisms (such as the pea plants Mendel worked on) have two <b>alleles</b> for each trait, one inherited from each parent.|$|E
5|$|<b>Alleles</b> at a locus may be {{dominant}} or recessive; dominant <b>alleles</b> {{give rise}} to their corresponding phenotypes when paired with any other allele for the same trait, whereas recessive <b>alleles</b> {{give rise to}} their corresponding phenotype only when paired with another copy of the same allele. If you know the genotypes of the organisms, you can determine which <b>alleles</b> are dominant and which are recessive. For example, if the allele specifying tall stems in pea plants is dominant over the allele specifying short stems, then pea plants that inherit one tall allele from one parent and one short allele from the other parent will also have tall stems. Mendel's work demonstrated that <b>alleles</b> assort independently {{in the production of}} gametes, or germ cells, ensuring variation in the next generation. Although Mendelian inheritance remains a good model for many traits determined by single genes (including a number of well-known genetic disorders) it does not include the physical processes of DNA replication and cell division.|$|E
5|$|As {{shown in}} the table, {{the total number of}} {{possible}} combinations to have an equal (conserved) number of A and B <b>alleles</b> is six, and its probability is 6/16. The total number of possible alternative combinations is ten, and the probability of unequal number of A and B <b>alleles</b> is 10/16. Thus, although the original colony began with an equal number of A and B <b>alleles,</b> chances are that the number of <b>alleles</b> in the remaining population of four members will not be equal. In the latter case, genetic drift has occurred because the population's allele frequencies have changed due to random sampling. In this example the population contracted to just four random survivors, a phenomenon known as population bottleneck.|$|E
5|$|Consequences of {{selection}} can include meiotic drive (unequal transmission of certain <b>alleles),</b> nonrandom mating and genetic hitchhiking.|$|E
5|$|Such {{cooperation}} within {{species may}} have evolved {{through the process}} of kin selection, which is where one organism acts to help raise a relative's offspring. This activity is selected for because if the helping individual contains <b>alleles</b> which promote the helping activity, it is likely that its kin will also contain these <b>alleles</b> and thus those <b>alleles</b> will be passed on. Other processes that may promote cooperation include group selection, where cooperation provides benefits to a group of organisms.|$|E
5|$|A genetic hybrid carries two {{different}} <b>alleles</b> {{of the same}} gene, where for instance one allele may code for a lighter coat colour than the other.|$|E
5|$|In asexual organisms, {{genes are}} {{inherited}} together, or linked, as they cannot mix with genes of other organisms during reproduction. In contrast, {{the offspring of}} sexual organisms contain random mixtures of their parents' chromosomes that are produced through independent assortment. In a related process called homologous recombination, sexual organisms exchange DNA between two matching chromosomes. Recombination and reassortment do not alter allele frequencies, but instead change which <b>alleles</b> are associated with each other, producing offspring with new combinations of <b>alleles.</b> Sex usually increases genetic variation and may increase the rate of evolution.|$|E
5|$|Incomplete lineage sorting: the {{presence}} of multiple <b>alleles</b> in ancestral populations might lead to the impression that convergent evolution has occurred.|$|E
5|$|Recombination allows <b>alleles</b> on {{the same}} strand of DNA to become separated. However, the rate of {{recombination}} is low (approximately two events per chromosome per generation). As a result, genes close together on a chromosome {{may not always be}} shuffled away from each other and genes that are close together tend to be inherited together, a phenomenon known as linkage. This tendency is measured by finding how often two <b>alleles</b> occur together on a single chromosome compared to expectations, which is called their linkage disequilibrium. A set of <b>alleles</b> that is usually inherited in a group is called a haplotype. This can be important when one allele in a particular haplotype is strongly beneficial: natural selection can drive a selective sweep that will also cause the other <b>alleles</b> in the haplotype to become more common in the population; this effect is called genetic hitchhiking or genetic draft. Genetic draft caused by the fact that some neutral genes are genetically linked to others that are under selection can be partially captured by an appropriate effective population size.|$|E
5|$|The {{founder effect}} is a special case of a {{population}} bottleneck, occurring when a small group in a population splinters off from the original population and forms a new one. The random sample of <b>alleles</b> in the just formed new colony is expected to grossly misrepresent the original population {{in at least some}} respects. It is even possible that the number of <b>alleles</b> for some genes in the original population is larger than the number of gene copies in the founders, making complete representation impossible. When a newly formed colony is small, its founders can strongly affect the population's genetic make-up far into the future.|$|E
5|$|The {{hair color}} of Highland cattle {{can vary from}} black, brindled, red, yellow and dun. The coat colors are caused by <b>alleles</b> at the MC1R gene (Elocus) and the PMEL or SILV gene (Dlocus).|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanisms}} of genetic drift can be illustrated with a simplified example. Consider {{a very large}} colony of bacteria isolated in a drop of solution. The bacteria are genetically identical except for a single gene with two <b>alleles</b> labeled A and B. A and B are neutral <b>alleles</b> meaning {{that they do not}} affect the bacteria's ability to survive and reproduce; all bacteria in this colony are equally likely to survive and reproduce. Suppose that half the bacteria have allele A and the other half have allele B. Thus A and B each have allele frequency 1/2.|$|E
5|$|While natural {{selection}} has a direction, guiding evolution towards heritable adaptations {{to the current}} environment, genetic drift has no direction and is guided only by the mathematics of chance. As a result, drift acts upon the genotypic frequencies within a population without regard to their phenotypic effects. In contrast, selection favors the spread of <b>alleles</b> whose phenotypic effects increase survival and/or reproduction of their carriers, lowers the frequencies of <b>alleles</b> that cause unfavorable traits, and ignores those that are neutral.|$|E
5|$|From a Neo-Darwinian perspective, {{evolution}} {{occurs when}} there are changes in the frequencies of <b>alleles</b> within a population of interbreeding organisms. For example, the allele for black colour in a population of moths becoming more common. Mechanisms {{that can lead to}} changes in allele frequencies include natural selection, genetic drift, genetic hitchhiking, mutation and gene flow.|$|E
5|$|Hans Asperger {{described}} common symptoms {{among his}} patients' family members, especially fathers, and research supports this observation and suggests a genetic contribution to Asperger syndrome. Although no specific gene {{has yet been}} identified, multiple factors are believed {{to play a role}} in the expression of autism, given the phenotypic variability seen in children with AS. Evidence for a genetic link is the tendency for AS to run in families and an observed higher incidence of family members who have behavioral symptoms similar to AS but in a more limited form (for example, slight difficulties with social interaction, language, or reading). Most behavioral genetic research suggests that all autism spectrum disorders have shared genetic mechanisms, but AS may have a stronger genetic component than autism. There is probably a common group of genes where particular <b>alleles</b> render an individual vulnerable to developing AS; if this is the case, the particular combination of <b>alleles</b> would determine the severity and symptoms for each individual with AS.|$|E
5|$|If genetic {{differentiation}} between populations develops, gene flow between populations can introduce traits or <b>alleles</b> which are disadvantageous {{in the local}} population and this may lead to organisms within these populations evolving mechanisms that prevent mating with genetically distant populations, eventually resulting in the appearance of new species. Thus, exchange of genetic information between individuals is fundamentally important {{for the development of}} the biological species concept.|$|E
5|$|Preserved {{woolly mammoth}} fur is orange-brown, {{but this is}} {{believed}} to be an artefact from the bleaching of pigment during burial. The amount of pigmentation varied from hair to hair and also within each hair. A 2006 study sequenced the Mc1r gene (which influences hair colour in mammals) from woolly mammoth bones. Two <b>alleles</b> were found: a dominant (fully active) and a recessive (partially active) one. In mammals, recessive Mc1r <b>alleles</b> result in light hair. Mammoths born with at least one copy of the dominant allele would have had dark coats, while those with two copies of the recessive allele would have had light coats. A 2011 study showed that light individuals would have been rare. A 2014 study instead indicated that the colouration of an individual varied from non-pigmented on the overhairs, bi-coloured, non-pigmented and mixed red-brown guard hairs, and non-pigmented underhairs, which would give a light overall appearance.|$|E
5|$|Repeat {{this process}} {{a number of}} times, {{randomly}} reproducing each generation of marbles to form the next. The numbers of red and blue marbles picked each generation fluctuates; sometimes more red and sometimes more blue. This fluctuation is analogous to genetic drift– {{a change in the}} population's allele frequency resulting from a random variation in the distribution of <b>alleles</b> {{from one generation to the}} next.|$|E
5|$|Several {{studies have}} focused on changes of anthropometrical (body weight, BMI, WHR,…) or {{biochemical}} parameters (mostly plasma lipid levels) {{as a result of the}} interactions between common APOA5 variants and dietary habits (polyunsaturated fatty acid intake, n-3 and n-6 fatty acid intake, total fat and total energy intake, alcohol intake), dietary (lowering the energy intake) and/or physical activity interventions or dyslipidaemic (using statins or fenofibrate) treatment. Due to the high heterogeneity of the examined populations, differences in protocol and/or interventions used, the studies are difficult to directly compare and draw definitive conclusions. However, with caution, it could be concluded that carriers of the minor C-1131, Trp19, or T553 <b>alleles</b> are in some cases less prone to the positive effects of environmental and/or pharmacological interventions. Some papers suggest the importance of the interactions between APOA5 and other genes, especially with common APOE (OMIM acc. No. 107741) three allelic (E2, E3, and E4) polymorphism, in the modulation of plasma lipids. In these cases, the interaction between minor <b>alleles</b> of both genes seems to be of importance. In the general population, APOE4 seems to have the potential to diminish the effect of minor APOA5 rs662799 and rs3135506 <b>alleles,</b> especially in females. Interaction between APOE and APOA5 Ser19˃Trp has been suggested to play some role in the development of type III hyperlipidaemia. Further studies, in which interaction with APOA5 has been described, have included, for example, variants within FTO, lipoprotein lipase, USF-1 and FEN-1. They have also focused not only on plasma lipids, but on BMI values or hypertension as well.|$|E
5|$|Single cross hybrids {{result from}} the cross between two true-breeding organisms which {{produces}} an F1 hybrid (first filial generation). The cross between two different homozygous lines produces an F1 hybrid that is heterozygous; having two <b>alleles,</b> one contributed by each parent and typically one is dominant and the other recessive. Typically, the F1 generation is also phenotypically homogeneous, producing offspring that are all similar to each other.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Cattle Dog carries {{recessive}} piebald <b>alleles</b> {{that produce}} {{white in the}} coat and skin and are linked to congenital hereditary deafness, though {{it is possible that}} there is a multi-gene cause for deafness in a dog with the piebald pigment genes. Around 2.4% of Cattle Dogs in one study were found to be deaf in both ears and 14.5% were deaf in at least one ear.|$|E
5|$|The jack jumper ant genome is {{contained}} {{on a single}} pair of chromosomes (males have just one chromosome, as they are haploid). This is the lowest number known (indeed possible) for any animal, a number shared with the parasitic roundworm Parascaris equorum univalens. Jack jumper ants are taxonomically discussed as a single biological species in the Myrmecia pilosula species complex. The ant has nine polymorphic loci, which yielded 67 <b>alleles.</b>|$|E
5|$|When some {{component}} of a trait is heritable, selection alters the frequencies of the different <b>alleles,</b> or variants of the gene that produces the variants of the trait. Selection {{can be divided into}} three classes, {{on the basis of its}} effect on allele frequencies: directional, stabilizing, and purifying selection. Directional selection occurs when an allele has a greater fitness than others, so that it increases in frequency, gaining an increasing share in the population. This process can continue until the allele is fixed and the entire population shares the fitter phenotype. Far more common is stabilizing selection, which lowers the frequency of <b>alleles</b> that have a deleterious effect on the phenotype – that is, produce organisms of lower fitness. This process can continue until the allele is eliminated from the population. Purifying selection conserves functional genetic features, such as protein-coding genes or regulatory sequences, over time by selective pressure against deleterious variants.|$|E
5|$|Workers in {{colonies of}} the Asian honey bee, Apis florea, are also {{reported}} {{to engage in}} oophagy. Using microsatellite analysis, researchers concluded that no mature drones had non-queen <b>alleles</b> in the colonies they investigated. Thus, even though workers had activated ovaries and were capable of laying eggs, worker policing ensured the functional sterility of otherwise fertile workers.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{selection}} acts on an organism's phenotype, {{or physical}} characteristics. Phenotype {{is determined by}} an organism's genetic make-up (genotype) and {{the environment in which}} the organism lives. When different organisms in a population possess different versions of a gene for a certain trait, each of these versions is known as an allele. It is this genetic variation that underlies differences in phenotype. An example is the ABO blood type antigens in humans, where three <b>alleles</b> govern the phenotype.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the number}} of {{individual}} HLA <b>alleles</b> that have been identified is large, approximately 40% of these <b>alleles</b> appear to be unique, having only been identified in single individuals. Roughly a third of <b>alleles</b> have been reported {{more than three times}} in unrelated individuals. Because of this variation in the rate at which of individual HLA <b>alleles</b> are detected, {{attempts have been made to}} categorize <b>alleles</b> at each expressed HLA locus in terms of their prevalence. The result is a catalog of common and well-documented (CWD) HLA <b>alleles,</b> and a catalogue of rare and very rare HLA <b>alleles.</b>|$|E
25|$|Each {{human cell}} expresses six MHC class I <b>alleles</b> (one HLA-A, -B, and -C allele from each parent) and {{six to eight}} MHC class II <b>alleles</b> (one HLA-DP and -DQ, {{and one or two}} HLA-DR from each parent, and {{combinations}} of these). The MHC variation in the human population is high, at least 350 <b>alleles</b> for HLA-A genes, 620 <b>alleles</b> for HLA-B, 400 <b>alleles</b> for DR, and 90 <b>alleles</b> for DQ. Any two individuals who are not identical twins will express differing MHC molecules. All MHC molecules can mediate transplant rejection, but HLA-C and HLA-DP, showing low polymorphism, seem least important.|$|E
25|$|Compared to a {{population}} {{in which all}} S <b>alleles</b> are co-dominant, the presence of dominance relationships in the population, raises the chances of compatible mating between individuals. The frequency ratio between recessive and dominant S <b>alleles,</b> reflects a dynamic balance between reproduction assurance (favoured by recessive <b>alleles)</b> and avoidance of selfing (favoured by dominant <b>alleles).</b>|$|E
25|$|Compound {{heterozygosity}} {{in medical}} genetics is {{the condition of}} having two heterogeneous recessive <b>alleles</b> at a particular locus that can cause genetic disease in a heterozygous state. That is, an organism is a compound heterozygote when it has two recessive <b>alleles</b> for the same gene, but with those two <b>alleles</b> being {{different from each other}} (for example, both <b>alleles</b> might be mutated but at different locations). Compound heterozygosity reflects the diversity of the mutation base for many autosomal recessive genetic disorders; mutations in most disease-causing genes have arisen many times. This means that many cases of disease arise in individuals who have two unrelated <b>alleles,</b> who technically are heterozygotes, but both the <b>alleles</b> are defective.|$|E
25|$|Mutations causing laminopathies include {{recessive}} {{as well as}} dominant <b>alleles</b> {{with rare}} de novo mutations creating dominant <b>alleles</b> that do not allow their carriers to reproduce before death.|$|E
25|$|Mutations {{create new}} <b>alleles.</b> These <b>alleles</b> have new DNA {{sequences}} and can produce proteins with new properties. So if an island was populated entirely by black mice, mutations could happen creating <b>alleles</b> for white fur. The combination of mutations creating new <b>alleles</b> at random, and natural selection picking out {{those that are}} useful, causes adaptation. This is when organisms change in ways that help them to survive and reproduce. Many such changes, studied in evolutionary developmental biology, affect the way the embryo develops into an adult body.|$|E
25|$|By 1990, {{the full}} {{complexity}} of the HLA class I antigens was beginning to be understood. At the time new serotypes were being determined, the problem with multiple <b>alleles</b> for each serotype was becoming apparent by nucleotide sequencing. RFLP analysis helped determine new <b>alleles,</b> but sequencing was more thorough. Throughout the 1990s, PCR kits, called SSP-PCR kits were developed that allowed, at least under optimal conditions, the purification of DNA, PCR and Agarose Gel identification of <b>alleles</b> within an 8-hour day. <b>Alleles</b> {{that could not be}} clearly identified by serotype and PCR could be sequenced, allowing for the refinement of new PCR kits.|$|E
25|$|Pathogenic coevolution, a counterhypothesis, {{posits that}} common <b>alleles</b> are under {{greatest}} pathogenic pressure, driving positive selection of uncommon alleles—moving targets, so to say, for pathogens. As pathogenic {{pressure on the}} previously common <b>alleles</b> decreases, their frequency in the population stabilizes, and remain circulating in a large population. Despite great MHC polymorphism at the population level, an individual bears at most 18 MHC I or II <b>alleles.</b>|$|E
