Between the 1950s and 1970s, most species of glass frogs were known from Central America, particularly from Costa Rica and Panama, where Taylor and Jay M.

During the running mate deliberations, McCain had favored Joe Lieberman, who shared his romantic sense of righteousness and honor. But the opposition from social conservatives, who objected to Lieberman's pro-choice views, was too strong, and a Lieberman pick might have caused a floor fight at the convention. McCain wanted someone who would shake up the race and reinforce his image as a maverick, so he decided against more conventional choices on his short list including Romney and Governor Tim Pawlenty.|$|E
25|$|The {{bottom half}} quarter-final line-up was {{scheduled}} to play today, with only two women's singles matches taking the court. The first pitted seven-time Grand Slam champion Serena Williams against Shahar Pe'er of Israel.

Pe'er looked on-form for victory when she went up 6–5 in the final set, <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> points from her first major semi-final, but it was Williams who then showed her fighting spirit by winning the next three games to wrap up the 3–6, 6–2, 8–6 victory and {{become one of the}} ten lowest-ranked women in the Open Era to compete in a Grand Slam semi-final.|$|E
25|$|The {{tropical}} storm remnant of Hurricane Hazel caused 81 deaths in October 1954 due to flooding that swept homes along river banks into Lake Ontario. A sudden downburst during a strong thunderstorm {{was believed to}} have played a contributing factor in the Air France Flight 358 crash in August 2005 <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> weeks later record-breaking intense rainfall, the worst since Hazel, deluged north-central sections of the city {{within a couple of}} hours resulting in record insurance claims. Some rain gauges recorded 175mm (7") of rain, over 100mm (4") in just one hour. Another large rainstorm with intense, record rainfall amounts struck a wide swath of the city during the afternoon rush hour on July 8, 2013 flooding city streets, subway tunnels, basements and knocking out power for over 2 million residents, stranding commuters, some having to be rescued from a submerged train. A daily rainfall record of 126.4mm (5") was set at Pearson Airport, most falling in an hour and a half. Flood insurance claims are likely to exceed the 2005 storm due to a wider area affected.|$|E

2500|$|By 23 June, {{a larger}} battle {{south of the}} state capital, Wau town, broke out between SPLA and SPLM-IO, the latter {{claiming}} to fight {{in order to protect}} the local Fertit people from attacks by the Dinka-dominated SPLA. As result of the increasing violence, a state of emergency was declared in Wau town, and the SPLA's 5th Division moved in, officially to prevent further escalation of violence. These forces were under the command of Lt. Gen. Gabriel Jok Riak, who had been accused of human rights abuses by the United Nations during the South Sudanese Civil War. Governor Waya initially claimed to support the emergency declaration, stating [...] "All who are here are rebels, so the Division [...] SPLA is ready and even those who are just walking around are ready". However, opposition groups claimed that the army soon began to plunder the state capital, and to assault the civilian population, leading Governor Waya to criticise the soldiers. Soon thereafter, on 24 June 2016, President Kiir unexpectedly sacked Waya, <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hours later, had him arrested. A local SPLA commander declared that Waya had been arrested because he was responsible for the deteriorating situation in the state, claiming that he had no respect for the military and talked [...] "nonsense". A few days later, a document began to circulate on the internet that claimed that Lt. Gen.

2500|$|The {{value of}} the Iranian rial has plunged since autumn 2011, it is {{reported}} to have devalued up to 80%, falling 10% immediately after the imposition of the EU oil embargo since early October 2012, causing widespread panic among the Iranian public. [...] In January 2012, the country raised the interest rate on bank deposits by up to 6 percentage points in order to curtail the rial's depreciation. The rate increase was a setback for Ahmadinejad, who had been using below-inflation rates to provide cheap loans to the poor, though naturally Iranian bankers were delighted by the increase. Not long after, <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days after Iran's economic minister declared that [...] "there was no economic justification" [...] for devaluing the currency because Iran's foreign exchange reserves were [...] "not only good, but the extra oil revenues are unprecedented," [...] the country announced its intention to devalue by about 8.5 percent against the U.S. dollar, set a new exchange rate and vowed to reduce the black market's influence (booming, of course, {{because of the lack of}} confidence in the rial). The Iranian Central Bank desperately tried to keep the {{value of the}} rial afloat in the midst of the late 2012 decline by pumping petrodollars into the system to allow the rial to compete against the US dollar. Efforts to control inflation rates were set forth by the government through a three-tiered-multiple-exchange-rate; this effect has failed to prevent the rise in cost of basic goods, simultaneously adding to the public's reliance on the Iranian black-market exchange rate network. Government officials attempted to stifle the black-market by offering rates 2% below the alleged black-market rates, but demand seems to be outweighing their efforts.|$|E
60|$|Several {{ladies of}} quality {{who had known}} his perfections, coveted to make the boy one of their domestics, as a page, or a playfellow to their children; for though he could not speak, {{he had such a}} vivacity in all his actions, such a sprightliness of behaviour, and such a merriment {{accompanying}} all his gestures, that he afforded more entertainment than the prettiest and wittiest little prattlers at those years are wont to do. Mr. Campbell had certainly accepted of some of these fortunate offers for his little cousin, which were many of them likely to prove very advantageous, {{if it had not been}} put in his head by some friends, particularly myself, that if he had a mind to dispose of the boy in that manner, the best way he could take would be to present him to the late Earl of Argyle, who for his namesake and for his father's sake, as well as the qualifications and endowments of the boy, would more naturally, according to all probability, take a greater pleasure and delight in him, and consequently provide better for him, and with a more lasting care, than any other person of quality that had a sudden liking to him, which might change, and took him as a stranger out of a bare curiosity. Mr. Campbell was by these reasons overruled in the disposal of his little dumb prophetical cousin, as he called him, and resolved that an offer should be made of him to the present illustrious Duke of Argyle's most noble father. But it so unfortunately happened, that the earl making very much a longer stay at London than was expected, Mr. Campbell, the uncle, sent our young Duncan Campbell, his nephew, handsomely accoutred, and with a handsome sum of money in his pocket, by sea, with Captain Meek of Kircaldie, to London, with letters of recommendation to the earl's favour, <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days before young Duncan arrived in London, the earl was set out on his journey to his seat in Scotland.|$|E
