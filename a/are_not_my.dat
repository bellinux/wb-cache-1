500|$|... "By {{the time}} of the film's release in 1939, there was some {{question}} as to who should receive screen credit," [...] writes Yeck. [...] "But despite the number of writers and changes, the final script was remarkably close to Howard's version. The fact that Howard's name alone appears on the credits may have been as much a gesture to his memory as to his writing, for in 1939 Sidney Howard died at age 48 in a farm-tractor accident, and before the movie's premiere." [...] Selznick, in a memo written in October 1939, discussed the film's writing credits: [...] "ou can say frankly that of the comparatively small amount of material in the picture which is not from the book, most is my own personally, and the only original lines of dialog which <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>my</b> own are a few from Sidney Howard and a few from Ben Hecht and a couple more from John Van Druten. Offhand I doubt that there are ten original words of [...] Garrett's in the whole script. As to construction, this is about eighty per cent my own, and the rest divided between Jo Swerling and Sidney Howard, with Hecht having contributed materially to the construction of one sequence." ...|$|E

Later in the year, she collaborated with Michael Stipe {{on the track}} [...] "Rio Grande" [...] for Johnny Depp's sea shanty album , and in 2013, co-wrote and contributed vocals on [...] "Rat A Tat" [...] from Fall Out Boy's album Save Rock and Roll; she also appeared in the music video for the track. After solo performances in December 2012 and January 2013, Love appeared in advertisements for Yves Saint Laurent alongside Kim Gordon and Ariel Pink. Love completed a solo tour of North America in mid-2013, which was purported to be in promotion of an upcoming solo album; however, it was ultimately dubbed a [...] "greatest hits" [...] tour, and featured songs from Love's and Hole's back catalogue. Love told Billboard {{at the time that}} she had recorded eight songs in the studio. [...] " [...] <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>my</b> usual (style)", Love said. [...] "I don't have any Fleetwood Mac references on it. Usually I always have a Fleetwood Mac reference as well as having, like, Big Black references. These are very unique songs that sort of magically happened." ...|$|E

500|$|Skelton's {{contract}} {{called for}} MGM's approval {{prior to his}} radio shows and other appearances. When he renegotiated his long-term contract with MGM, he wanted a clause that permitted him to remain working in radio {{and to be able}} to work on television, which was then largely experimental. [...] At the time, the major work in the medium was centered in New York; Skelton had worked there for some time and was able to determine that he would find success with his physical comedy through the medium. By 1947, Skelton's work interests were focused not on films, but on radio and television. His MGM contract was rigid enough to require the studio's written consent for his weekly radio shows, as well as any benefit or similar appearances he made; radio offered fewer restrictions, more creative control and a higher salary. Skelton asked for a release from MGM after learning he could not raise the $750,000 needed to buy out the remainder of his contract. He also voiced frustration with the film scripts he was offered while on the set of The Fuller Brush Man, saying, [...] "Movies <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>my</b> field. Radio and television are." [...] He did not receive the desired television clause nor a release from his MGM contract. [...] In 1948, columnist Sheilah Graham printed that Skelton's wishes were to make only one film a year, spending the rest of the time traveling the U.S. with his radio show.|$|E
500|$|In August and September 2014, {{unreleased}} demos from 1998 were {{leaked to}} the internet. Many of the demos were of songs that made the final album or released as b-sides, however some were different from the final album version with the most notable differences being a reggae influenced version of the title track with different lyrics and a very different vocal melody, a version [...] "Scar Tissue" [...] with a longer intro, a slower version of [...] "Purple Stain" [...] with added lyrics and different chorus, [...] "Porcelain Alice", the original version of [...] "Porcelain" [...] with different lyrics, an instrumental version of 'Quixoticelixer' (with the [...] working title [...] "New Wave Song"), [...] "How Strong Is Your Love", the original version of [...] "How Strong" [...] and the original demos for [...] "Fat Dance" [...] and [...] "Bunker Hill" [...] (originally titled [...] "These <b>Are</b> <b>Not</b> <b>My</b> Dreams of Bunker Hill"). The leaked demos also included never before heard songs such as [...] "Plate of Brown", [...] "Tellin' a Lie", [...] "Mommason", [...] "Andaman & Nicobar", [...] "Boatman", [...] "Sugar Sugar" [...] and [...] "Trouble in the Pub". In February 2015, a collection of rough mixes of outtakes from the Californication sessions was leaked. This group of songs, which were recorded on April 21, 1999 at The Village Studio, contains a version of [...] "Trouble in the Pub" [...] with vocals along with [...] "Blondie", a song Frusciante mentioned in an interview as an album outtake however the song turns out only to be a rough mix of [...] "Instrumental #2". An unmastered mix of the album also exists that features alternate versions of some songs, such as extended endings ("Easily"), extra verses ("Savior"), alternate choruses ("Around the World") and different guitar mixes ("How Strong").|$|E

As from November 2011, it remains Frenzal Rhomb's highest charting album, reaching No.11. It spawned their highest charting single, [...] "You <b>Are</b> <b>Not</b> <b>My</b> Friend" [...] (August), which reached No.49. Allmusic's album reviewer Mike DaRonco felt [...] "the first two songs are great in that catchy, playful pop-punk sort of way, but the rest ... fall under the trap of having all their tracks sounding like one big, long song". The album also features fan favourites [...] "We're Going Out Tonight" [...] and [...] "Never Had So Much Fun".|$|E

Rabbi Zeira went to the marketplace to buy something. He said to the one who was weighing: that was weighed very fairly. He responded: Do not depart from here, Babylonian, because your ancestors destroyed the Temple. At that moment Rabbi Zeira said, <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>my</b> ancestors the same as the ancestors of this one?! Rabbi Zeira entered the house of study and heard the voice of Rabbi Sheila who was sitting and teaching: [...] "'If it is a wall': if Israel had ascended like a wall from the Exile, the Temple {{would not have}} been destroyed a second time."

2500|$|At Columbia University in 1971, Borges further {{elaborated}} on the story's creation, [...] "I {{tried to}} imagine what a real Nazi might be like. I mean someone who thought of violence as being praiseworthy for its own sake. Then I thought that this archetype of the Nazis wouldn't mind being defeated; after all, defeats and victories are mere matters of chance. He would still be glad of the fact, even if the Americans and British won the war. Naturally, when I am with Nazis, I find they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>my</b> idea of what a Nazi is, but this wasn't meant to be a political tract. It was meant to stand for {{the fact that there was}} something tragic in the fate of a real Nazi. Except that I wonder if a real Nazi ever existed. At least, when I went to Germany, I never met one.

2500|$|Yancey's {{previous}} 1848 {{attempt at}} demanding a slave code for the territories was his Alabama Platform, {{which was in}} response to the Northern Wilmot Proviso attempt at banning slavery in territories conquered from Mexico. [...] Justice Peter V. Daniel wrote a letter about the Proviso to former President Martin Van Buren: [...] "It is that view of the case which pretends to an insulting exclusiveness or superiority on the one hand, and denounces a degrading inequality or inferiority on the other; which says in effect to the Southern man, 'Avaunt! you <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>my</b> equal, and hence are to be excluded as carrying a moral taint with you.' [...] Here is at once the extinction of all fraternity, of all sympathy, of all endurance even; the creation of animosity fierce, implacable, undying." [...] Both the Alabama Platform and the Wilmot Proviso failed, but Yancey learned to be less overtly radical in order to get more support. Southerners thought they were merely demanding equality, in that they wanted Southern property in slaves to get the same (or more) protection as Northern forms of property.|$|E

2500|$|In 1972 {{a review}} of pilgrimages noted Chase's across a few paragraph's in some detail taking from his In Galilee and Scheffler's comments. In 1973 O. Z. Whitehead wrote a biographical article on Chase {{published}} in Baha'i News. The work identified him specifically as a Captain serving in the Civil War {{as well as his}} life as an insurance salesman and his singing voice, refers to Scheffler's essay, and in general to the process by which Chase came to the Bahá'í Faith, and adding an anecdote of Chase meeting John Bosch. In 1974 it was mentioned that John Bosch was Chase's [...] "literary executor" [...] and in general Chase's papers and collected material was willed to Bosch – including calligraphy by a Bahá'í specialist, Mishkin-Qalam, and noted that Mrs. Chase had burned some material before Bosch could arrive. In November 1974 Hand of the Cause Dhikru'llah Khadem called Chase [...] "the Mullá Husayn of the West", (the first believer of the religion founded by the Báb and accepted as a precursor to the religion by Bahá'ís.) In 1974 the Pittsburgh Courier again notes Chase, this time in a profile of a major Bahá'í conference, noting he him as the first Bahá'í in America. In 1979 Roger White, called a poet laureette of the religion, albeit unofficially, published a volume of work called Another Song, Another Season: Poems and Portrayals which included a 7 page creative nonfiction story [...] "Graveyards <b>Are</b> <b>Not</b> <b>My</b> Style; Thornton Chase 1847-1912" [...] centering on that first graveside memorial visit with [...] `Abdu'l-Bahá. It was written {{from the point of view}} of a Catholic man in love with a Bahá'í and their struggle over unity being of different religions and their resolution at the interaction of `Abdu'l-Bahá, Thornton Chase's gravesite, and them.|$|E
