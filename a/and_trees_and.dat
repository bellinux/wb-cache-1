5|$|September 9, 1881– Wilmington {{is struck}} by what is {{considered}} the most severe hurricane in over 40years; strong winds from the storm wreck buildings <b>and</b> <b>trees,</b> <b>and</b> damage from the cyclone totals $100,000 (1881USD, $2.1million 2007USD).|$|E
5|$|Carolina wrens {{adapt to}} various {{habitats}}. Natural habitats include {{various types of}} woodland such as oak hardwoods and mixed oak-pine woodlands, ash and elmwoods, hickory-oak woodlands with a healthy amount of tangled undergrowth. The preferred habitats are riparian forests, brushy edges, swamps, overgrown farmlands, and suburban yards with abundant thick shrubs <b>and</b> <b>trees,</b> <b>and</b> parks. It has an affinity for dilapidated buildings and unkempt yards in man-made areas. Subspecies burleighi and neophilus inhabit slash pine and palmettos.|$|E
5|$|The Siberian accentor feeds {{mainly on}} insects, {{typically}} picked off the ground, but sometimes taken from vegetation including bushes <b>and</b> <b>trees,</b> <b>and</b> frequently from near snow fields. Young birds are fed mainly on insects, especially the larvae of beetles, several food items being {{carried to the}} nest at each visit.|$|E

5|$|The game {{introduces}} the Batmobile as a drivable vehicle. The bulletproof Batmobile can be {{summoned to the}} player's location while on foot or, if the player is airborne, summoned to meet Batman as he lands. The vehicle features the ability to perform jumps, speed boosts, rotate on the spot, smash through objects like barricades <b>and</b> <b>trees,</b> <b>and</b> fire missiles that can immobilize enemy vehicles. Batman can eject from the Batmobile and immediately begin gliding around Gotham City.|$|E
5|$|Unmanned {{spacecraft}} in Earth orbit {{have become}} an essential technology of modern civilization. They allow direct monitoring of weather conditions, relay long-range communications like television, provide a means of precise navigation, and allow remote sensing of the Earth. The latter role serves {{a wide variety of}} purposes, including tracking soil moisture for agriculture, prediction of water outflow from seasonal snow packs, detection of diseases in plants <b>and</b> <b>trees,</b> <b>and</b> surveillance of military activities.|$|E
5|$|The South Vietnamese M113s had {{no problem}} {{crossing}} the generally shallow streams and rivers typical of the Mekong Delta, but the heavy 10-ton M113s became bogged down in the deeper Cong Ba Ky Canal, forcing the crews and the infantry company on board to cut down brush <b>and</b> <b>trees</b> <b>and</b> fill the canal until it was shallow enough for the M113s to cross. The rescue operation was further delayed when Ba tried to obtain proper authorization to advance, because he was under orders not to take commands directly from the American advisers. Vann, who was flying above the armored formation, demanded that Ba advance immediately. Ba replied {{that he would not}} take instructions from Americans. When Vann threatened to have Ba shot, he reluctantly continued to advance, although very slowly, toward the entrenched Viet Cong.|$|E

5|$|To {{the north}} of the fort, the Hessian right, {{commanded}} by Johann Rall, moved up the steep hillside south of Spuyten Duyvil Creek against almost no resistance from the Americans. The Hessians began to bring up their artillery. At this point, the main body of Hessians, 4,000 men, under Knyphausen began to advance down the Post Road, which ran between Laurel Hill and the hill Rall was on. The Hessians crossed swampy land and when they approached the wooded hillside near the fort, they were fired upon by 250 riflemen of the Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment under the command of Lt. Col. Moses Rawlings. Rawlings' men hid behind rocks <b>and</b> <b>trees</b> <b>and</b> darted from place to place to shoot at the Hessians as they tried to advance through the fallen trees and rocks. The first and second charges by the Hessians were repulsed by Rawlings' riflemen.|$|E
5|$|At West Palm Beach, the {{majority}} of the damage was confined to vegetation. Several coconut and royal palms that withstood the 1928 hurricane snapped, littering streets with broken trunks. Winds downed road signs on many streets, and floodwaters covered the greens on a local golf course. Some garages and isolated structures, mostly lightweight, were partly or totally destroyed, along with a lumber warehouse. Some homes that lost roofing shingles had water damage to their interiors as well. Nearby Lake Worth sustained extensive breakage of windows, including plate glass, and loss of tile and shingle roofing, but preparations reduced losses to just several thousand dollars, and no post-storm accidents took place. Strong winds snapped many light poles in the city, <b>and</b> <b>trees</b> <b>and</b> shrubs were broken or uprooted. As in Lake Worth, officials in West Palm Beach credited preparations and stringent building codes with reducing overall damage. The city had learned from previous experience with severe storms in 1926, 1928, and 1929. High tides eroded Ocean Boulevard at several spots and disrupted access to several bridges on the Lake Worth Lagoon. Winter estates and hotels on Palm Beach generally sustained little material damage, except to vegetation, and county properties went largely unscathed.|$|E
5|$|Fire {{is another}} {{important}} element in {{the maintenance of the}} Everglades. The majority are caused by lightning strikes from thunderstorms during the wet season. Their effects are largely superficial, and serve to foster further plant growth: sawgrass will burn above water, but the roots are preserved. Fire in the sawgrass marshes serves to keep out larger bushes <b>and</b> <b>trees,</b> <b>and</b> releases nutrients from decaying plant matter more efficiently than decomposition. Large burned areas also affect waterflow, since wind and water are undeterred by the eradicated sawgrass; water may flow two to three times faster in recently burned areas. During the wet season only dead plant matter and the tips of plants are burned; however, the effects of fire are much more significant in the dry season, as fire may be fed by organic peat and burn deeply, destroying root systems. The only impediment to the spread of fire in the Everglades is the presence of water. It takes around 225years for one foot (0.3m) of peat to develop, but the peat is not as dense as it should be for the 5,000years of the Everglades' existence. Scientists point to fire as the reason.|$|E

5|$|In Miami, {{sustained}} winds reached , shattering plate-glass {{windows and}} interrupting electrical and telegraph services. The Florida East Coast Railway Station in Hallandale Beach was nearly destroyed. Windows and roofs were damaged in Hollywood and Fort Lauderdale, but damage was minor overall. At the latter, the storm also downed power lines, telephone wires, <b>and</b> <b>trees,</b> <b>and</b> destroyed car garages. The hurricane caused two fatalities in the city. In Pompano Beach, the recently constructed Pompano Theater was severely damaged. The Kester Building, a drug store, and {{a grocery store}} also suffered impact. Nearly all small frame houses were destroyed in Deerfield Beach, while several citizens estimated that at least 50% of homes were demolished. The town's post office, depot, and an entire business block were also destroyed. A freight train was blown off its tracks. An eight year old boy drowned in a ditch near where his family sought refugee, while 51 additional people were injured throughout Broward County.|$|E
5|$|Production {{is still}} {{specialized}} in horticultural goods, {{but most of}} the masseiras were substituted by greenhouses and a significant share of the production is exported to other Western European markets. Póvoa de Varzim is part of the ancient Vinho Verde winemaking region, and there is commercial wine production, however local masseira wines are not commercially produced. The inland valley region is committed to milk production and the Agros corporation headquarters of Lactogal, the largest dairy products and milk producer company in the Iberian Peninsula, is located in Espaço Agros and has several departments such as exhibition park and laboratories. In agriculture, the masseira farm fields were developed. This technique increases agricultural yields by using large, rectangular depressions dug into sand dunes, with the spoil piled up into banks surrounding the depression. Grapes are cultivated on the banks to the south, east and west, <b>and</b> <b>trees</b> <b>and</b> reeds on the northern slope act as a windbreak against the prevailing northern wind. Garden crops are grown in the central depression.|$|E

25|$|In {{a modern}} botanical context, manna {{is often used}} to refer to the {{secretions}} of various plants, especially of certain shrubs <b>and</b> <b>trees,</b> <b>and</b> in particular the sugars obtained by evaporating the sap of the manna ash, extracted by making small cuts in the bark. The manna ash, native to southern Europe and southwest Asia, produces a blue-green sap, which has medicinal value as a mild laxative, demulcent, and weak expectorant.|$|E

25|$|Herring Island is an {{artificial}} island that {{was formed in}} 1928 by cutting a new path for the Yarra River through an old basalt quarry, {{as part of a}} plan to control flooding of the river. The new island, which was initially called Como Island, was built up with silt dredged from the river. Levee banks were constructed up on the island, <b>and</b> <b>trees</b> <b>and</b> shrubs were planted; but they were swept away by a major flood in November 1934.|$|E
