5|$|Kafka {{finished}} {{none of his}} full-length {{novels and}} burned around 90 percent of his work, much of it during the period he lived in Berlin with Diamant, who helped him burn the drafts. In his early years <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>writer,</b> <b>he</b> was influenced by von Kleist, whose work he described {{in a letter to}} Bauer as frightening, and whom he considered closer than his own family.|$|E
5|$|An {{enthusiastic}} {{reader and}} independent thinker as a child, Balzac had trouble {{adapting to the}} teaching style of his grammar school. His willful nature caused trouble throughout his life and frustrated his ambitions {{to succeed in the}} world of business. When he finished school, Balzac was apprenticed in a law office, but he turned his back on the study of law after wearying of its inhumanity and banal routine. Before and during his career <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>writer,</b> <b>he</b> attempted to be a publisher, printer, businessman, critic, and politician; he failed in all of these efforts. La Comédie Humaine reflects his real-life difficulties, and includes scenes from his own experience.|$|E
5|$|Awake is an American {{television}} police procedural fantasy {{drama that}} originally aired on NBC for one season from March1 to May24, 2012. The pilot episode had an early release on Hulu on February16, 2012, {{two weeks before}} the series' premiere on television. The show's central character is Michael Britten (Jason Isaacs), a detective who works for the Los Angeles Police Department. Kyle Killen, the series' creator, was primarily responsible for the program's concept; although he served <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>writer,</b> <b>he</b> avowed that writing episode scripts was difficult.

5|$|After his brother's death, Poe began more earnest {{attempts}} {{to start his}} career <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>writer.</b> <b>He</b> chose a difficult time in American publishing to do so. He was the first well-known American to try to live by writing alone and was hampered {{by the lack of}} an international copyright law. Publishers often produced unauthorized copies of British works rather than paying for new work by Americans. The industry was also particularly hurt by the Panic of 1837. There was a booming growth in American periodicals around this time period, fueled in part by new technology, but many did not last beyond a few issues and publishers often refused to pay their writers, or paid them much later than they promised. Throughout his {{attempts to}} live as a writer, Poe repeatedly had to resort to humiliating pleas for money and other assistance.|$|E
5|$|Freedom from Want was {{published}} with an essay by Carlos Bulosan {{as part of}} the Four Freedoms series. Bulosan's essay spoke on behalf of those enduring domestic socioeconomic hardships rather than sociopolitical hardships abroad, and it thrust him into prominence. As he neared his thirtieth birthday, the Philippine immigrant and labor organizer Bulosan was experiencing a life that was not consistent with the theme Rockwell depicted in his version of Freedom From Want. Unknown <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>writer,</b> <b>he</b> was subsisting as a migrant laborer working intermittent jobs. Post editors tracked down the impoverished immigrant to request an essay contribution. Bulosan rose to prominence during World War II when the Commonwealth of the Philippines, a United States territory, was occupied by Japan. To many Americans, Bulosan's essay marked his introduction, and his name was thereafter well recognized. The essay was lost by The Post, and Bulosan, who had no carbon copy, had to track down the only draft of the essay at a bar in Tacoma.|$|E

25|$|Kandukuri Veeresalingam is {{reckoned}} as {{the chief}} architect of the Renaissance of Telugu literature in the later {{half of the nineteenth}} century. But due to the enormity of his service as a social reformer in comparison with that of his work as a pioneer in modern Telugu literature, he is looked upon by the people as a reformer. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>writer,</b> <b>he</b> was the first to try his hand at many of the modern literary forms such as minor poem, burlesque, biography, autobiography, novel, satire, farce and plays. If Veeresalingam was the path-finder in this respect, Chilakamarti was a torch-bearer along the path, as the former went on breaking new grounds. Both of them were versatile writers in verse and as well as in prose. The literary output of both of them was conspicuously voluminous. There was practically no genre left untouched by them except in one or two spheres.|$|E

500|$|Haley's {{warning to}} avoid [...] "telegraphing to readers" [...] and his advice about [...] "building {{suspense}} and drama" [...] demonstrate {{his efforts to}} influence the narrative's content and assert his authorial agency while ultimately deferring final discretion to MalcolmX.

In the words of Eakin, [...] "Because this complex vision of his existence is clearly not that of the early sections of the Autobiography, Alex Haley and MalcolmX were forced to confront the consequences of this discontinuity in perspective for the narrative, already a year old." [...] MalcolmX, after giving the matter some thought, later accepted Haley's suggestion.|$|E
