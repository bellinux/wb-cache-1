40|$|This paper reports an {{experiment}} conducted {{to assess the}} effects of alterations in production conditions and product durability on market power in Bertrand-Edgeworth duopolies. Experiment results indicate that <b>advance</b> <b>production</b> increases market power {{in the sense that}} mean transaction prices increase relative to static Nash equilibrium predictions for a baseline market. In a similar way, a simple inventory option reduces market power. We also find that both <b>advance</b> <b>production</b> and inventory carryover undermine a strong tendency toward tacit collusion observed in our baseline duopoly markets.

40|$|<b>Advance</b> <b>production</b> {{serves as}} a means of {{quantity}} commitment. Therefore an oligopolist, unlike a monopolist, may have an incentive to invest in <b>advance</b> <b>production</b> in order to pre-empt its opponent(s) even when [i] it is technologically more costly than on-spot production, and [ii] it does not entitle the firm to Stackelberg leadership in the subsequent marketing stage. When firms set quantities, such pre-emption acts as strategic substitutes between oligopolists. Namely, in a pure strategy subgame perfect equilibrium, some but not all firms may engage in <b>advance</b> <b>production,</b> whether the firms are a priori symmetric or not. More generally, a firm's incentive for <b>advance</b> <b>production</b> arises only if there is a quantity-setting opponent, irrespective of the firm's own strategic variable (i. e., price or quantity) and the characteristics of the concerned products (i. e., substitutes or complements). inventory, storage costs, time preferences, pre-emption, strategic substitution. ...|$|R

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{designed to}} assess the effects of <b>advance</b> <b>production</b> decisions on posted-offer market performance is reported. Six of the twelve triopolies were conducted under standard posted-offer rules. In the remaining markets sellers made binding production commitments prior to posting prices, an alteration that shifts the unique stage-game Nash equilibrium from the competitive to the Cournot outcome. As predicted, the <b>advance</b> <b>production</b> decisions raised prices and lowered output. Nevertheless, stable Cournot outcomes were never observed...|$|R

In addition, <b>advance</b> <b>production</b> results in higher prices than production to order if both games have an equilibrium in nondegenerated mixed strategies...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>advance</b> <b>production</b> in posted offer and double auctio n markets are investigated. Previously-observed {{differences}} between the se institutions in mean contract prices and {{in the distribution of}} producers' and consumers' surpluses under the production to demand condition disappear when sellers make output decisions and incur production costs {{prior to the start of}} trading. The double auction institution under production to demand remains more efficient under <b>advance</b> <b>production.</b> The results suggest that the differential effects of alternative trading institutions on market outcomes may be partially offset by the production conditions characterizing a market.
