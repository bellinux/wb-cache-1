40|$|Intimate. s tspically are {{positively}} biased in <b>their</b> <b>relationship</b> evaluations. Given this fact, how can intimates regulate <b>their</b> esteem needs <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>relationships</b> and still function effectively, without risking later regret and disappointment? We {{address this issue}} by first reviewing work showing that because bias and accuracy are independ-ent, they can co-exist. We next show how bias and accuracy are subject to different evaluative motives, relationship evaluations, and situations. It is argued that the pur-suit ofimportant goals {{is a time when}} people are motivated tofeel good <b>about</b> <b>their</b> re-lationships. This is a time when relationshipjudgments {{are positively}} biased and rela-tively inaccurate. However, important choice points in the relationship are times when people are motivated to both accurately understand <b>their</b> <b>relationships</b> and to feel good <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>relationships.</b> These dual needs can be simultaneously met by becoming more accurate in epistemic-related relationship judgments while being more positively biased in esteem-related relationship judgments. Most individuals are positively biased when evalu-ating <b>their</b> romantic <b>relationships.</b> This scientific tru-ism is supported by a large body of research showing that intimates systematically evaluate their own rela-tionship as being more positive than what reality sug-gests is the case (e. g., Agnew, Loving, & Drigotas...|$|R

5|$|Wendell and Edith Willkie {{moved to}} New York in October 1929, only {{weeks before the}} Wall Street Crash of 1929, and found an {{apartment}} overlooking Central Park.

However, in an unexpected turn of events, Nalla and Padayatchi's daughter Balasaraswathi, called Bala (Kiran Rathod), fell in love with each other. Realising their chances of getting together would be slim if Padayatchi knew <b>about</b> <b>their</b> <b>relationship,</b> Nalla and Bala decided to elope to Kerala. Nalla boarded a bus bound for Kerala, and on his way to meet Bala, the bus crashed on a hillside leaving him scarred, disfigured, and partially paralysed for life.

Padayatchi had earlier lied to Bala that Nalla died in the accident. It was also at this time that Nalla became a firm believer in kindness and love. Despite suffering from an inferiority complex due to his scarred and deformed body, Nalla performs community service and social work with renewed fervour while continuing to fight for union causes.|$|E
