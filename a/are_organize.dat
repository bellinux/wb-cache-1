40|$|Abstract We use {{an early}} twentieth century (1908 – 1958) {{atmospheric}} reanalysis, based on assimilation of surface and sea level pressure observations, to contrast atmospheric circulation during two periods of persistent drought in North America: 1932 – 1939 (the ‘Dust Bowl’) and 1948 – 1957. Primary forcing for both droughts is believed to come from anomalous sea surface temperatures (SSTs) : a warm Atlantic and a cool eastern tropical Pacific. For boreal winter (October–March) in the 1950 s, a stationary wave pattern originating from the tropical Pacific is present, with positive centers over the north Pacific and north Atlantic ocean basins and a negative center positioned over northwest North America and the tropical/subtropical Pacific. This wave train is largely absent for the 1930 s drought; boreal winter height anomalies <b>are</b> <b>organize...</b>|$|E

40|$|Asylum seekers {{have been}} {{recognized}} as having unique and complex health needs which require attention upon arrival in the host country. Not much is known about what issues to address in first contacts with asylum seekers. The {{purpose of this study}} is to give insight in the specific issues that healthcare providers need to address in the first contacts with newly arrived asylum seekers. A qualitative study using different types of data in 2007 and 2008. Questionnaires (n = 89) were used as input for seven group interviews with Dutch care providers (n = 46) working with asylum seekers in the Netherlands, were qualitatively analysed, using a framework method. Healthcare providers identified four issues they aimed to address in first contacts with asylum seekers: (1) assessing the current health condition; (2) health risk assessment; (3) providing information about the healthcare system of the host country; and (4) health education. The first contacts between healthcare providers and asylum seekers serve different goals, especially assessing health problems and risks, and providing health information. These issues may, however, be addressed differently by different healthcare providers, across different host countries, dependent on the way healthcare and medical insurance for asylum seekers <b>are</b> <b>organize...</b>|$|E
40|$|Accepting the {{hypothesis}} that cancers are self-organizing, opportunistic systems, {{it is crucial to}} understand the collective behavior of cancer cells in their tumorous heterogeneous environment. In the present paper, we ask the following basic question: Is this self-organization of tumor evolution reflected {{in the manner in which}} malignant cells are spatially distributed in their heterogeneous environment? We employ a variety of nontrivial statistical microstructural descriptors that arise in the theory of heterogeneous media to characterize the spatial distributions of the nuclei of both benign brain white matter cells and brain glioma cells as obtained from histological images. These descriptors, which include the pair correlation function, structure factor and various nearest neighbor functions, quantify how pairs of cell nuclei are correlated in space in various ways. We map the centroids of the cell nuclei into point distributions to show that while commonly used local spatial statistics (e. g., cell areas and number of neighboring cells) cannot clearly distinguish spatial correlations in distributions of normal and abnormal cell nuclei, their salient structural features are captured very well by the aforementioned microstructural descriptors. We show that the tumorous cells pack more densely than normal cells and exhibit stronger effective repulsions between any pair of cells. Moreover, we demonstrate that brain gliomas <b>are</b> <b>organize...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract XML {{and other}} types of semi-structured data are typ-ically {{represented}} by a labeled directed graph. To speed up path expression queries over the graph, a variety ofstructural indexes have been proposed. They usually work by partitioning nodes in the data graph into equivalenceclasses and storing equivalence classes as index nodes. A(k) -index introduces the concept of local bisimilarity forpartitioning, allowing the trade-off between index size and query answering power. However, all index nodes in A(k) -index have the same local similarity k, which cannot takeadvantage of the fact that a workload may contain path expressions of different lengths, or that different parts of thedata graph may have different local similarity requirements. To overcome these limitations, we propose M(k) - andM*(k) -indexes. The basic M(k) -index is workload-aware:Like the previously proposed D(k) -index, it allows differ-ent index nodes to have different local similarity requirements, providing finer partitioning only for parts of the datagraph targeted by longer path expressions. Unlike D(k) -index, M (k) -index is never over-refined for irrelevant in-dex or data nodes. However, the workload-aware feature still incurs overrefinement due to over-qualified parent in-dex nodes. Moreover, fine partitions penalize the performance of short path expressions. To solve these problems,we further propose the M*(k) -index. An M*(k) -index con-sists of a collection of indexes whose nodes <b>are</b> <b>organize...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{recognition}} and alignment of homologous chromosomes early in meiosis {{is essential for}} their subsequent segregation at anaphase I; however, the mechanism by which this occurs is unknown. We demonstrate here that, {{in the absence of}} the molecular motor, Kar 3 p, meiotic cells are blocked with prophase monopolar microtubule arrays and incomplete synaptonemal complex (SC) formation. kar 3 mutants exhibit very low levels of heteroallelic recombination. kar 3 mutants do produce double-strand breaks that act as initiation sites for meiotic recombination in yeast, but at levels severalfold reduced from wild-type. These data are consistent with a meiotic role for Kar 3 p in the events that culminate in synapsis of homologues. Meiosis is a dynamic process in which the behavior of the chromosomes and spindle is coordinated to allow the generation of haploid gametes from diploid precursor cells. This is especially evident in the dramatic movements of the chromosomes and spindle in anaphase I, when homologous chromosomes are drawn apart. Before this, during prophase, the chromosomes align and recombine with their homologous partners while an organized array of microtubules develops. The relationship of microtubule and chromosome activity in prophase is less clear; however, there is evidence to suggest that these are not independent processes. For example, in many organisms it has been shown that chemical agents or environmental conditions that disrupt meiotic spindle development have profound effects on chiasma formation or chromosome synapsis (for review see Loidl, 1990). The interdependence of microtubule function and chromosome behavior in early meiosis is also seen in certain oocytes in which the highly condensed meiotic chromatin serves as a foundation around which the microtubules <b>are</b> <b>organize...</b>|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we solve {{a type of}} {{shortest}} queue problem, {{which is}} related to multibeam satellite systems. We assume that the packet interarrival times are independently distributed according to an arbitrary distribution function, that the service times are Markovian with possibly different service rates, {{that each of the}} servers has its own buffer for packet waiting, and that jockeying among buffers is permitted. Packets always join the shortest buffer(s). Jockeying takes place as soon as the difference between the longest and shortest buffers exceeds a pre-set number (not necessary 1). In this case, the last packet in a longest buffer jockeys instantaneously to the shortest buffer(s). We prove that the equilibrium distribution of packets in the system is modified vector-geometric. Expressions of main performance measures, including the average number of packets in the system, the average packet waiting time in the system and the average number of jockeying, are given. Based on the above solutions, numerical results are computed. By comparing the results for jockeying and non-jockeying models, we show that a significant improvement of the system performance is achieved for the jockeying model. The performance study of a great number of satellite systems basically depends on the analysis of the related queueing systems. The major interesting measures of such analysis includes the system throughput, the average packet delay on the satellite, and the buffer overflow probability for the case of finite buffer size. Multibeam satellite systems have been studied extensively (for example, see Chlamtac and Ganz 1986, and Chang 1983), and {{it has been shown that}} they provide a greater system flexibility and a better performance.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} pressent {{study is}} to examine the process of {{construction}} of national identity, the understanding of the concept of one"s own country and the recognition of the national symbols by children from Bilbao, aged 6 to 14 years old. @@ The theoretical starting point is based, one one hand, on the cognitive theories that emphasize the task carried out by each person during the learnig process (Piaget, Delval); and on the other hand, by the theory of Social Identity (Tajfel, Turner) and the theory of Social Representation (Moscovici). @@ The group studied was formed by 160 children aged 6 to 14 years old under two different linguistic models: model A (the studies in Spanish and Basque as subject) and model D (the studies in Basque and Spanish as subject). The technique used for collecting data has been the clinique interview based on a semistructured interview, with the help of additional material specially designed for this research. @@ This work, in a descriptive and explorative way, tries to establish how the social representations associated with national identity are being formed within a specific cultural contex, the basque context. Additionally, the possible influence of other factors such as the school language of the children, their sex and age is analized. @@ Specifically, this research is focused on three closely related aspects, such as: the representation of one"own country, the national identity and national symbols. Concerning the representation of the country, two main aspects are considered: the verbal recognition of the different geographic & administrative units of Spain and their graphic representation in maps. Referring to the national identity, self-image has been the first point explored; followed by the social/national group that is freely recognised by each person, and finally the national self-classification and the facts that defined the self-identiy. As far as the national symbols are concerned, the process of acquisition of the concept of symbol and the relationship between the knowledge of the symbol and the different attitudes towards them are studied. @@ The answers obtained have been doubly analysed, firstly an analysis of quantitative nature {{as a function of the}} variables studied, and secondly an analysis of qualitative nature that allow us to assess how children"ideas about nationality <b>are</b> <b>organize...</b>|$|E
