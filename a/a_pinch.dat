5|$|Mass {{civil disobedience}} spread {{throughout}} India as millions broke the salt laws by making salt or buying illegal salt. Salt was sold illegally {{all over the}} coast of India. <b>A</b> <b>pinch</b> of salt made by Gandhi himself sold for 1,600 rupees (equivalent to $750 at the time). In reaction, the British government arrested over sixty thousand people {{by the end of}} the month.|$|E
5|$|Salt is {{considered}} to be a very auspicious substance in Hinduism and is used in particular religious ceremonies like house-warmings and weddings. In Jainism, devotees lay an offering of raw rice with <b>a</b> <b>pinch</b> of salt before a deity to signify their devotion and salt is sprinkled on a person's cremated remains before the ashes are buried. Salt is believed to ward off evil spirits in Mahayana Buddhist tradition, and when returning home from a funeral, <b>a</b> <b>pinch</b> of salt is thrown over the left shoulder as this prevents evil spirits from entering the house. In Shinto, salt is used for ritual purification of locations and people (harae, specifically shubatsu), and small piles of salt are placed in dishes by the entrance of establishments for the two-fold purposes of warding off evil and attracting patrons.|$|E
5000|$|In mathematics, and {{especially}} topology and differential geometry, <b>a</b> <b>pinched</b> torus (or croissant surface) {{is a kind}} of two-dimensional surface. It gets its name from its resemblance to a torus that has been <b>pinched</b> at <b>a</b> single point. <b>A</b> <b>pinched</b> torus is <b>an</b> example of an orientable, compact 2-dimensional pseudomanifold.|$|R
50|$|Pinches are {{classified}} as frontside or reverse. A right-handed player shooting a forehand shot to the right front corner is shooting <b>a</b> frontside <b>pinch.</b> <b>A</b> right-handed player shooting to the left front corner is <b>a</b> reverse <b>pinch.</b> <b>A</b> right-handed player shoots <b>a</b> backhand frontside <b>pinch</b> to the left corner and <b>a</b> reverse double <b>pinch</b> to the right corner. Everything for a left-handed player would be the opposite.|$|R

5|$|He {{made his}} major league debut on September 7, 2010, as <b>a</b> <b>pinch</b> hitter for Denard Span, {{striking}} out against Kansas City Royals' pitcher Jesse Chavez. He {{remained in the}} game, replacing Span in center field. He recorded his first major league run batted in (RBI) on September 18, 2010, when he grounded out to score J. J. Hardy {{in a game against}} the Oakland Athletics. He recorded his first major league hit a day later.|$|E
5|$|Humber {{was named}} 2001 Texas High School Class 4A Player of the Year and {{enrolled}} at Rice University {{for the next}} season. Humber flirted with a no-hitter in college, pitching for the Rice Owls baseball team. On April 6, 2002 he held a no-hitter going into the eighth inning against the San Jose State Spartans baseball team. In that contest, he surrendered <b>a</b> <b>pinch</b> hit single in the eighth, but did not allow any runs until a ninth-inning home run.|$|E
5|$|Musial {{made his}} 12th NL All-Star {{appearance}} in 1955 as a reserve player, when Cincinnati's Ted Kluszewski outpolled him by 150,000 votes {{to get on}} the starting lineup at first base. Musial entered the game as <b>a</b> <b>pinch</b> hitter in the fourth inning, and played left field as the game entered extra innings. Leading off the bottom of the 12th, he hit a home run to give the NL a 6–5 victory.|$|E

5|$|Signed as <b>a</b> <b>pinch</b> hitter for the Cleveland Indians at age 19, Paschal {{appeared}} in nine games, collecting one hit on August 16, which broke up a no-hitter by Bernie Boland {{with two outs}} in the ninth inning. The Indians declared Paschal too inexperienced, and {{he was sent to}} the Muskegon Reds of the Central League. The league disbanded {{in the middle of the}} 1917 season, and Paschal became a free agent.|$|E
5|$|The 1931 {{season was}} Hornsby's last as a {{full-time}} player. Boils on his feet bothered him during {{the start of the}} 1932 season, and he did not play his first game until May29. Hornsby played right field from May29 to June10, appeared in two games as <b>a</b> <b>pinch</b> hitter, played third base from July14 through July18, and played one last game as a Cub when he pinch-hit on July31.|$|E
5|$|The {{voting for}} the 2004 Major League Baseball All-Star Game Final Vote again {{continued}} for three days, running from Sunday, July 4, 2004 and ending on Wednesday, July 7, 2004. The final results were announced with ordinal vote rankings (shown below) and approximate winning vote totals (Hideki Matsui – 1.2 million, Bobby Abreu – 2 million, of more than 9.5 million votes). Abreu appeared as <b>a</b> <b>pinch</b> hitter, while Matsui both pinch hit and played left field.|$|E

5|$|To aid his {{recovery}} from Tommy John surgery, Fernández {{cut back on}} the use of his fastball during spring training in 2016 and began working on his secondary pitches. Appearing as <b>a</b> <b>pinch</b> hitter in the 12th inning against the Atlanta Braves on July 1, Fernández doubled in two runs to put the Marlins ahead 7–5, which ended up being the final score. He became just the second pitcher in Marlins history to produce a game-winning hit, following Dennis Cook on August 1, 1997. Fernández appeared in the 2016 MLB All-Star Game.|$|E
5|$|Trent Durrington {{became the}} only Australian {{position}} player to pitch in an MLB game when he appeared for the Milwaukee Brewers on 17 April 2004 against the Houston Astros. Durrington had already entered the game initially as <b>a</b> <b>pinch</b> hitter and remained in the game playing at third base. With two outs {{in the bottom of}} the eighth inning, Durrington faced one hitter and induced a fly ball out.|$|E
5|$|Walls' double {{continued}} his success as <b>a</b> <b>pinch</b> hitter, making him 13-for-26 with 12 {{runs batted in}} in such situations for the season. Don Larsen entered to relieve O'Dell, who had not recorded an out but had earned a blown save for his performance. Maury Wills hit a ground ball to the first baseman, who threw home {{in an attempt to}} put out Walls who slid hard into the Giants' catcher Haller. The slide, which cut Haller's arm deep enough to later require six stitches, caused him to drop the ball, leaving Walls safe on Haller's error and extending the Dodgers' lead to 7–5. John Orsino entered as the new catcher to replace the injured Haller. Wills then stole second, his 101st stolen base of the season, before the batter Gilliam saw a single pitch. Orsino's throw to try to catch Wills went past second base and into center field. Wills attempted to advance to third, but was thrown out by Willie Mays. Larsen then induced a flyball out by Gilliam and the inning was over. Between the two halves of the sixth the two teams had scored a combined 11 runs and used six pitchers, three pinch hitters, two defensive replacements, and <b>a</b> <b>pinch</b> runner.|$|E

5|$|Banister {{began the}} 1991 season with Buffalo. The Pirates {{promoted}} Banister from {{the minor leagues}} on July 23, 1991, when catcher Don Slaught was injured and placed on the disabled list. Manager Jim Leyland used Banister as <b>a</b> <b>pinch</b> hitter for pitcher Doug Drabek {{in the eighth inning}} of that day's game against the Atlanta Braves at Three Rivers Stadium. Using Cecil Espy's bat, Banister hit a ball from Dan Petry and just beat shortstop Jeff Blauser's throw to first base. Banister is one of only 15 batters (excluding pitchers) in baseball history to record a hit in his only major league plate appearance.|$|E
5|$|Born in Houston, Bates {{attended}} the University of Texas and, in his freshman season, won the 1983 College World Series {{as a part}} of the Texas Longhorns baseball team. For the next two seasons, Bates was named to the College Baseball All-America Team, a team composed of the best collegiate baseball athletes in America. Drafted by Milwaukee in the 4th round of the 1985 MLB draft, he rose through the Brewers' farm system and teams that he played for won multiple minor league titles. He subsequently made his MLB debut in 1989, after Milwaukee starting second baseman became injured. A trade sent Bates to Cincinnati in 1990, where the Reds used him as <b>a</b> <b>pinch</b> runner at the end of the regular season and into the postseason. Facing the Oakland Athletics in the World Series, Bates reached base on <b>a</b> <b>pinch</b> hit single against Dennis Eckersley and later scored the winning run in Game 2, as the Reds ultimately swept the Athletics, four games to none. Following the World Series championship, Bates spent two years in minor league baseball, one for the Reds and one for the Chicago Cubs, and last played exhibition baseball in 1995. After retirement, he worked as an equipment supplier in the oil and gas industry in Houston and coached his daughter's softball team.|$|E
5|$|Despite lack of run support {{contributing}} to a poor win-loss record, Hamels was among the best pitchers in the National League, and was even mentioned as a Cy Young candidate. On September 1, Hamels pitched six innings of a Phillies combined no-hitter against the Atlanta Braves. Hamels was pulled for <b>a</b> <b>pinch</b> hitter {{in the top of}} the seventh due to having five walks, a hit-batter, and 108 pitches through six innings. Overall, Hamels was the only consistent star on the Phillies, finished sixth in Cy Young voting, and was frequently mentioned as a candidate to be traded in the offseason to bolster the Phillies' lackluster farm system, after he avoided being dealt at the July trading deadline.|$|E

5|$|Ryan Michael Hanigan (born August 16, 1980) is an American {{professional}} baseball catcher {{who is a}} free agent. He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB)for the Cincinnati Reds, Tampa Bay Rays, Boston Red Sox and Colorado Rockies. After graduating from Andover High School in 1999, Hanigan attended Rollins College, where he signed as an undrafted free agent with the Cincinnati Reds. He then spent the 2002 to 2006 seasons with Reds minor league baseball teams, including the Dayton Dragons, and Louisville Bats. He made his MLB debut on September 9, 2007 as <b>a</b> <b>pinch</b> hitter. He recorded his first major league hit in that at-bat. While with the Reds he caught two no hitters, both thrown by Homer Bailey. He previously played for the Tampa Bay Rays and Boston Red Sox.|$|E
5|$|The final {{series of}} the home stand {{featured}} the Washington Nationals. After Burnett's poor pitching led some {{to suggest that he}} would retire after the season, he dominated game one by striking out 12 batters and allowing one run in seven innings for a 3–2 win. The Phillies' success continued the next day, when Sandberg started Freddy Galvis and Darin Ruf in place of Chase Utley and Ryan Howard. Ruf and Galvis combined for four hits, two runs and three RBIs in a 4–3 victory. The team swept the series when Sizemore entered the game as <b>a</b> <b>pinch</b> hitter in the sixth inning, and his two-run homer helped the Phillies to an 8–4 final score.|$|E
5|$|As <b>a</b> <b>pinch</b> hitter, Caballero {{came through}} with hits in clutch situations, notably against the St. Louis Cardinals on August 30. Behind 6–3 at Sportsman's Park in St. Louis, the Phillies sent Caballero {{to the plate}} to pinch hit {{in the top of}} the seventh inning. He led off the inning with a single, scoring the first run of a seesaw come-from-behind rally that ended with a 9–8 Phillies victory, closer Jim Konstanty's 13th of the season. Caballero {{displayed}} his running skills again in September, replacing Goliat in the ninth inning of another game against the Cardinals, and scoring a late-inning run in place of Lopata against the Cincinnati Reds several days later to tie a close game that the Phillies eventually lost in 18 innings. On September 26, Caballero scored another crucial run against the Boston Braves when he pinch-ran for outfielder Dick Sisler. Waiting on third base after advancing from first on a Del Ennis single to center field, Jones hit a high ground ball to Boston shortstop Sibby Sisti, who booted the ball and allowed Caballero to score the game-tying run; the Phillies won, 8–7.|$|E
