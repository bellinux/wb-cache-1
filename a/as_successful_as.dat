5|$|During his lifetime, the Irish {{schools were}} not <b>as</b> <b>successful</b> <b>as</b> Smith had anticipated.

5|$|<b>As</b> <b>successful</b> <b>as</b> Carroll was in business, however, he and {{his wife}} {{experienced}} many personal losses throughout this period. Of the ten children born to Charles and Mary Carroll, five died within a year of their birth. Henry, their eldest son, died the year before his father in 1719, at the age of 21 or 22. Only the third child, named Charles and later known as Charles Carroll of Annapolis, and their next son Daniel would marry and have children of their own.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>successful</b> <b>as</b> Kansas' offense was, {{it was the}} Jayhawks' {{special teams}} (beating Virginia Tech coach Frank Beamer at his own game) that earned them the victory.

Kansas punter Kyle Tucker did an {{excellent}} job pinning Virginia Tech deep in its own end of the field, kicking the ball five times for a total of 250yards, averaging 50yards a punt.

5|$|His {{research}} on plant evolution also progressed during this period; {{he worked on}} the genetics of forage grasses, looking at polyploidy and the evolution of the Poaceae and publishing numerous papers on the subject though the 1940s. He produced an artificial autotetraploid grass from the diploid species Ehrharta erecta through treatment with the chromosome doubling agent colchicine.

5|$|Queer Eyes American success caused {{television}} networks {{in several countries}} to syndicate the American episodes, {{with a number of}} countries creating their own local versions of Queer Eye for broadcast in their countries.

5|$|The album {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics, with many commending the band for making {{music with a}} darker tone.

5|$|The underpowered engines {{made the}} fighter sluggish, and the hydro-skis were not <b>as</b> <b>successful</b> <b>as</b> hoped; they created violent {{vibration}} during takeoff and landing, despite the shock-absorbing oleo legs they were extended on. Work on the skis and legs improved this situation somewhat, {{but they were}} unable to resolve the sluggish performance. The Sea Dart proved incapable of supersonic speed in level flight with the J34 engines; not helping was its pre-area rule shape, which meant higher transonic drag.|$|E
25|$|Although Lloyd's {{individual}} {{films were}} not <b>as</b> commercially <b>successful</b> <b>as</b> Chaplin's on average, {{he was far}} more prolific (releasing twelve feature films in the 1920s while Chaplin released just four), and made more money overall ($15.7 million to Chaplin's $10.5 million).|$|R
