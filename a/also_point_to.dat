5|$|Other economists {{believe that}} these {{elements}} cannot completely explain the dramatic rise and fall in tulip prices. Garber's theory has also been challenged for failing to explain a similar dramatic rise and fall in prices for regular tulip bulb contracts. Some economists <b>also</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> other factors associated with speculative bubbles, such as a growth in the supply of money, demonstrated {{by an increase in}} deposits at the Bank of Amsterdam during that period.|$|E
5|$|Support for {{continued}} use of the name {{has come from the}} team's owners and a majority of fans, which include some Native Americans. Supporters say that the name honors the achievements and virtues of Native Americans, and that it is not intended in a negative manner. Some, such as team president Bruce Allen, <b>also</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> the use of Redskins by three high school teams, two on reservations, that have a majority of Native American students. Supporters have asserted that a majority of Native Americans are not offended by the name based upon a national poll by Annenberg Public Policy Center in 2004. In a commentary published soon after that poll, 15 Native American scholars collaborated on a critique that stated that there were so many flaws in the Annenberg study that rather than being a measure of Native American opinion, it was an expression of white privilege and colonialism. Specific criticism of the methodology includes the use of self-reporting to identify Native Americans, which violated the basic principles supporting the validity of public opinion polling. In May 2016, the Washington Post published a poll that duplicated the central question posed in 2004, yielding an identical result.|$|E

25|$|Scholars {{supporting}} the Satem {{character of the}} Illyrian languages highlight particular toponyms and personal names such as Asamum, Birzinimum Zanatis etc. in which these scholars claim that there is clear evidence of the Satem character of the Illyrian language. They <b>also</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> other toponyms including Osseriates derived from /*eghero/ (lake) or Birziminium from PIE /*bherǵh/ or Asamum from PIE /*aḱ-mo/ (sharp).|$|E
25|$|Affirmation of the {{classification}} of Macedonian as a separate language {{is an important issue}} for the ethnic Macedonian self-view. Critics often treat it as a dialect of Bulgarian, due to their close structural affinity and mutual intelligibility in both written and spoken forms; they <b>also</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> Macedonian's recent emergence as a separate standard language, and the political motivation behind its promotion in the mid-20th century.|$|E
25|$|Defenders of Thomson's {{argument}} {{reply that}} the alleged disanalogies between the violinist scenario and typical cases of abortion do not matter, either because {{the factors that}} critics appeal to are not genuinely morally relevant, or because those factors are morally relevant but {{do not apply to}} abortion in the way that critics have claimed. Thomson's defenders <b>also</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> her 'people-seeds' argument as a strong analogy to typical cases of abortion.|$|E

25|$|The {{morphological}} {{features of}} the cave bear chewing apparatus, including loss of premolars, have long been suggested to indicate their diets displayed {{a higher degree of}} herbivory than the Eurasian brown bear. Indeed, a solely vegetarian diet has been inferred on the basis of tooth morphology. Results obtained on the stable isotopes of cave bear bones <b>also</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> a largely vegetarian diet in having low levels of nitrogen-15 and carbon-13, which are accumulated at a faster rate by carnivores as opposed to herbivores.|$|E
25|$|Experience-induced {{changes in}} {{dendritic}} spine stability <b>also</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> spine turnover {{as a mechanism}} involved in the maintenance of long-term memories, though {{it is unclear how}} sensory experience affects neural circuitry. Two general models might describe the impact of experience on structural plasticity. On the one hand, experience and activity may drive the discrete formation of relevant synaptic connections that store meaningful information in order to allow for learning. On the other hand, synaptic connections may be formed in excess, and experience and activity may lead to the pruning of extraneous synaptic connections.|$|E
25|$|Colorectal {{cancer is}} a disease of old age: It {{typically}} originates in the secretory cells lining the gut, and risk factors include diets low in vegetable fibre and high in fat. If a younger person gets such a cancer, it {{is often associated with}} hereditary syndromes like Peutz-Jegher's, hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer or familial adenomatous polyposis. Colorectal cancer can be detected through the bleeding of a polyp, colicky bowel pain, a bowel obstruction or the biopsy of a polyp at a screening colonoscopy. A constant feeling of having to go to the toilet or anemia might <b>also</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> this kind of cancer.|$|E

25|$|Those {{who argue}} against a blanket {{moratorium}} on the extraction of asymptomatic, disease-free wisdom teeth point out that wisdom teeth commonly develop periodontal disease or cavities which may eventually damage the second molars {{and that there are}} costs associated with monitoring wisdom teeth. They <b>also</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> {{the fact that there is}} an increase in the rate of post-operative periodontal disease on the second molar, difficulty of surgery and post-operative recovery time with age. The UK has also seen an increase in the rate of dental caries on the lower second molars increasing from 4–5% prior to the NICE guideline to 19% after its adoption.|$|E
25|$|The building's plan {{consists}} of a rectangular tower and an irregular, hexagonal bastion, with elongated flanks, that projects south into the river. It is basically a large articulated vertical space resting on a horizontal stone slab, covered by masonry enclosures. On the northeast angle of the structure, protected by a defensive wall with bartizans, is a drawbridge to access the bulwark, decorated in plant motifs, surmounted by the royal coat of arms and flanked by small columns, complemented with armillary spheres. The Manueline armillary spheres appear at the tower's entrance, symbolizing Portugal's nautical explorations, and were used on King Manuel I's personal banner to represent Portuguese discoveries during his rule. The decorative carved, twisted rope and elegant knots <b>also</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> Portugal's nautical history and are common elements of the Manueline style.|$|E
25|$|Those {{opposed to}} amalgam use suggest that modern {{composites}} are improving in strength. In {{addition to their}} claims of possible health and ethical issues, opponents of dental amalgam fillings claim amalgam fillings contribute to mercury contamination of the environment. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that health care facilities, including dental offices, account {{for as much as}} 5% of total waste water mercury emissions. The WHO also points out that amalgam separators, installed in the waste water lines of many dental offices, dramatically decrease the release of mercury into the public sewer system. However, critics say that the separators are not mandatory in some states of the United States. The critics <b>also</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> cremation of dental fillings as an additional source of air pollution, contributing about 1% of total global emissions.|$|E
50|$|Tory {{statements}} {{before the}} election <b>also</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> a reduction in corporation tax, perhaps partly paid for by changes to capital allowances which are currently seen as complex.|$|R

25|$|Archaeological {{surveys in}} Kausambi, 96km {{east of the}} Reh {{inscription}} showed that Kausambi had been completely destroyed at one point, and that the archaeological layer corresponding to the destruction contained numerous double-tanged and some triple-tanged arrows, consisting in an adaptation of Western socketed designs rather than Eastern designs, and previously associated with the Greeks in Taxila. These arrows can therefore {{be associated with the}} Indo-Greek invasion in the 2nd century BCE. Such arrowheads have also been found at Sonkh (near Borapa) and Mathura. The Manhai pillar capital, as well as fortification walls nearby Kausambi consisting of large blocks joined together with iron clamps and nails, a mode of construction unknown at the time in the Ganges valley, and thought to be the work of Greek craftsmen, <b>also</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> the presence of the Indo-Greeks.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of the Little Bighorn was {{the subject}} of an 1879 U.S. Army Court of Inquiry in Chicago, held at Reno's request, during which his conduct was scrutinized. Some {{testimony}} by non-Army officers suggested that he was drunk and a coward. The court found Reno's conduct to be without fault. After the battle, Thomas Rosser, James O'Kelly, and others continued to question the conduct of Reno due to his hastily ordered retreat. Defenders of Reno at the trial noted that, while the retreat was disorganized, Reno did not withdraw from his position until it became apparent that he was outnumbered and outflanked by the Indians. Contemporary accounts <b>also</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> the fact that Reno's scout, Bloody Knife, was shot in the head, spraying him with blood, possibly increasing his own panic and distress.|$|E
25|$|Unlike Bush, Clinton {{was able}} to unite his fractious and ideologically diverse party behind his candidacy, even when its {{different}} wings were in conflict. To garner the support of moderates and conservative Democrats, he attacked Sister Souljah, a little-known rap musician whose lyrics Clinton condemned. Furthermore, Clinton made clear his support {{of the death penalty}} and would later champion making school uniforms in public schools a requirement. Clinton could <b>also</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> his centrist record as Governor of Arkansas. More liberal Democrats were impressed by Clinton's record on abortion and affirmative action. His strong connections to African Americans also played a key role. In addition, he organized significant numbers of young voters and became a symbol of the rise of the Baby Boomer generation to political power. Supporters remained energized and confident, even in times of scandal or missteps.|$|E
50|$|He <b>also</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> {{developments}} in Florida, where newly elected Gov. Rick Scott fired {{the president of}} a similar public-private entity and has proposed to consolidate economic development operations into a reinstated Department of Commerce.|$|R

50|$|Piskor's drawing {{has been}} {{influenced}} by 1960s and '70s underground comix scene, and he <b>also</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> Robert Crumb as a major influence, but comic critics have praised Piskor for developing his own artistic style.|$|R
25|$|Despite its {{regressive}} tax formula, Social Security benefits are calculated using a progressive benefit formula that replaces {{a much higher}} percentage of low-income workers' pre-retirement income than that of higher-income workers (although these low-income workers pay {{a higher percentage of}} their pre-retirement income). Supporters of the current system <b>also</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> numerous studies that show that, relative to high-income workers, Social Security disability and survivor benefits paid on behalf of low-income workers more than offset any retirement benefits that may be lost because of shorter life expectancy (this offset would only apply at a population level). Other research asserts that survivor benefits, allegedly an offset, actually exacerbate the problem because survivor benefits are denied to single individuals, including widow(er)s married fewer than nine months (except in certain situations), divorced widow(er)s married fewer than 10 years, and co-habiting or same-sex couples, unless they are legally married in their state of residence. Unmarried individuals and minorities tend to be less wealthy.|$|E
25|$|A {{utilitarian}} view {{asserts that}} it is obligatory to steer to the track with one man on it. According to classical utilitarianism, such a decision would be not only permissible, but, morally speaking, the better option (the other option being no action at all). An alternate viewpoint is that since moral wrongs are already {{in place in the}} situation, moving to another track constitutes a participation in the moral wrong, making one partially responsible for the death when otherwise no one would be responsible. An opponent of action may <b>also</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> the incommensurability of human lives. Under some interpretations of moral obligation, simply being present in this situation and being able to influence its outcome constitutes an obligation to participate. If this is the case, then deciding to do nothing would be considered an immoral act if one values five lives more than one.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of the tin mines on Dartmoor are located in granite country rock {{and most of the}} lodes trend ENE–WSW and are of limited length, though there are exceptions. In the underground workings, the tin ore, cassiterite, was usually found in association with large amounts of tourmaline, and in central Dartmoor with much specular haematite. In {{the southern part of the}} moor, the cassiterite was usually found in relatively large grains, but the lodes were of very variable quality. These factors, combined with the fact that none of the underground workings was found to be profitable at depth, are typical of the deepest zone of tin mineralisation. The once very extensive alluvial deposits of tin ore, that were the first deposits to be mined, <b>also</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> the vast quantity of ore that once existed in lodes that have been eroded from above the granite since it was emplaced in the Carboniferous period.|$|E
50|$|Catherine L Albanese {{theorized that}} Transcendentalism has Hermetic influence. Among Transcendentalist thinkers, she {{especially}} <b>points</b> <b>to</b> Ralph Waldo Emerson who has ideas of humankind transcending into deification {{similar to those}} of Joseph Smith. She <b>also</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> the spiritual narcissism of Henry David Thoreau.|$|R
