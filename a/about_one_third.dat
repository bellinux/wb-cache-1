In addition the 2/3 portion was weighted for gender. About 70 openings were reserved for children of Rice University faculty and staff.

Adenoid cystic carcinoma, which is of salivary gland origin, account for <b>about</b> <b>one</b> <b>thirds</b> of adult primary tracheal tumors. A 49 -year-old gentleman presented to us after undergoing a pneumonectomy elsewhere. Computed tomography scan of the thorax at our hospital showed a residual disease in the primary site, size of which was same as that in the preoperative scan. Because there was a compromised respiratory reserve due to pneumonectomy we decided to keep the radiation dose to the remaining lung as low as possible. We treated him by positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) directed intensity modulated radiation therapy to a dose of 60 Gy in 30 Fractions over 6 weeks on a linear accelerator. PET helped in exact localization of the target on the planning CT. He tolerated the treatment very well. PET-CT done 1 year posttreatment showed no residual disease. Presently he is disease free with good pulmonary reserve...|$|R

5|$|As regards numbers, the mid-2nd-century army {{contained}} c. 80,000 cavalry out of c. 385,000 total effectives i.e. cavalry constituted c. 21% of {{the total}} forces. For the late army, <b>about</b> <b>one</b> <b>third</b> of the army units in the Notitia are cavalry, but in numbers cavalry were a smaller proportion {{of the total}} because cavalry units were on average smaller than infantry units.

Overall, the available evidence suggests that the proportion of cavalry was much the same as in the 2nd century. Examples: in 478, a comitatus of 38,000 men contained 8,000 cavalry (21%).

I show evidence on three hypotheses to explain why health habits vary by SES.

Second, women respond to common knowledge differentially by SES, so that knowledge and its use combined explain up to <b>one</b> <b>third</b> of differential smoking by education. Third, the most important determinants of differential health behavior are 'third variables,' or variables that can simultaneously determine health habits and SES.
