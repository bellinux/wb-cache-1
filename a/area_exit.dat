40|$|In general, {{jet engines}} operate with choked nozzle during take-off, climb and cruise, whereas unchoking occurs while landing and taxiing (when engine is not running at full power). Appropriate thrust in an {{aircraft}} in {{all stages of}} the flight, i. e., take-off, climb, cruise, descent and landing is achieved through variation in the nozzle <b>exit</b> <b>area.</b> This paper describes the effect on thrust and IR radiance of a turbojet engine due to variation in the <b>exit</b> <b>area</b> of a just choked converging nozzle (M-e = 1). The variations in the nozzle <b>exit</b> <b>area</b> result in either choking or unchoking of a just choked converging nozzle. Results for the change in nozzle <b>exit</b> <b>area</b> are analyzed in terms of thrust, mass flow rate and specific fuel consumption. The solid angle subtended (Omega) by the exhaust system is estimated analytically, for the variation in nozzle <b>exit</b> <b>area</b> (A(ne)), as it affects the visibility of the hot engine parts from the rear aspect. For constant design point thrust, IR radiance is studied from the boresight (phi = theta degrees, directly from the rear side) for various percentage changes in nozzle <b>exit</b> <b>area</b> (%Delta A(ne)), in the 1. 9 - 2. 9 mu m and 3 - 5 ism bands.
