40|$|Law 87 - ф 3 {{was signed}} by Russian President Vladimir Putin six {{months prior to the}} December 2007 presidential election. Law 87 - ф 3 rearranged the {{division}} of functions between the investigator and the procurator during the preliminary investigation. It also saw the creation of the investigative committee within the procuracy, which would have exclusive supervision of all investigations within that branch. Because of the Committee’s personal jurisdiction over investigations involving individuals with official immunity and agents of Russia’s power structures, both Russian media and Western academia saw the law as being politically motivated by the upcoming transfer of power. The new law is seen as a further step in Russia’s transition away from a Soviet procurator-centered criminal procedure system and toward a judicial oversight model consistent with <b>adversarial</b> <b>principles.</b> This paper examines the political rationalizations for law 87 - ф 3 reforms and points out the flaws.

40|$|Learning {{low-dimensional}} {{representations of}} networks has proved effective {{in a variety}} of tasks such as node classification, link prediction and network visualization. Existing methods can effectively encode different structural properties into the representations, such as neighborhood connectivity patterns, global structural role similarities and other high-order proximities. However, except for objectives to capture network structural properties, most of them suffer from lack of additional constraints for enhancing the robustness of representations. In this paper, we aim to exploit the strengths of generative adversarial networks in capturing latent features, and investigate its contribution in learning stable and robust graph representations. Specifically, we propose an Adversarial Network Embedding (ANE) framework, which leverages the <b>adversarial</b> learning <b>principle</b> to regularize the representation learning. It consists of two components, i. e., a structure preserving component and an adversarial learning component. The former component aims to capture network structural properties, while the latter contributes to learning robust representations by matching the posterior distribution of the latent representations to given priors. As shown by the empirical results, our method is competitive with or superior to state-of-the-art approaches on benchmark network embedding tasks. Comment: AAAI 201...|$|R

Each person {{has the right to}} protect his/her infringed rights in court. In accordance with {{the first part of the}} Article 4 of the Civil Procedural Code of Georgia legal proceedings shall be exercised on the basis of the <b>adversarial</b> <b>principle.</b> The Article underlines the second part of the Article 4 according to which the court may apply the measures provided under this Code on its own initiation. In the author’s opinion, this stipulation contradicts the nature of competition. The article expresses the idea that the court should not be actively involved in gathering evidences; it must support the parties if they cannot obtain the evidence by themselves for some reason and submit a petition to the court. The court’s role is regulated differently with respect to the <b>adversarial</b> <b>principle</b> in legislations of different countries. However, the Common Law regards the trial as a kind of tournament where a judge plays a role of an arbiter. Each party shall provide the evidence. I.

40|$|Most public {{infrastructure}} {{is provided by}} traditional procurement methods generally based on quantitative selection techniques and <b>adversarial</b> contracting <b>principles.</b> International evidence suggests that this method of contracting is inefficient, is often delivered late, and is often over-budget. Further, the adversarial nature of these contracts means that disputes over variations, changes to specification or renegotiation may lead to lengthy and costly ex post negotiations or civil action. The introduction of alternative procurement methods (APM) in the early 1990 s introduced a less adversarial contracting approach in which ownership (of decision-making) and responsibility for design and operation of the service-producing asset passed to the contractor with the state adopting a regulatory role. The contract is non-adversarial {{to the extent that}} the relationship between the contractor and the state is one of long-term relationship management. Evidence suggests that APM is achieving better time and cost performance than adversarial methods and contributing to improved service delivery and lower lifecycle costs. This paper reviews the theoretical literature with a view to understanding the relationship of the parties in a nonadversarial project procurement contract. It finds that the principal and agent view of traditional procurement may not be the best way to understand collaborative contracts where the relationship can be characterised as purely transactional – the principal is a buyer of services and the contractor is the producer. The paper also reviews the empirical evidence and finds that the characteristics of non-adversarial contract models such as the output specification, qualitative selection criteria, the alignment of responsibility for service outcomes and residual control rights, incentives, life cycle costing and risk-weighted value for money measurements, are improving project delivery performance and service outcomes...|$|R

40|$|The French Law of {{evidence}} {{is at the}} crossroad between procedural law and civil law. As part of the procedural law, it is governed by general principles set out by the Code de procédure civile, such as the contradictory principle, the principle of public hearing or the free disposition principle, {{which means that the}} parties define the framework of the proceeding and that the judge cannot base his decision on facts that were not put forward by the parties themselves. It is also the Code de procédure civile that organises the respective roles of the judge and the parties for the taking {{of evidence}}: since 1976, it imposes a – rather complex – balance between <b>adversarial</b> and inquisitorial <b>principles.</b> Other general principles were set by case law, e. g. the principle that no one can pre-constitute evidence in his own favour or the principle of fair evidence. On the other hand, more substantive rules {{are to be found in}} the Code civil. These rules mix two systems, the system of the preuve morale, applicable in some specific litigation, and the system of the preuve légale, which is clearly dominant in civil litigation. In the first system, evidence is in principle free, which means not only that any mode of proof is admissible, but also that assessment of evidence by the judges is free. In the second one, only determined means of evidence are admissible and their probative force is often set out by law. A majority of evidence rules derive more or less directly from this summa divisio. In fact, the predominance of the preuve légale system has made the French system of evidence rather rigid, in particular regarding the exaggerated importance of written evidence...|$|R

But these standards do not always match the legal research question. This paper focuses on normative legal argument based on empirical evidence. Whether there is a normative problem, and whether legal intervention promises to mitigate the problem, requires a decision. If uncertainty cannot be completely removed, the legal decision-maker must weigh the risk of false positives against the risk of false negatives. This may call for an adjustment of the significance level.

40|$|Since Estonia regained its {{independence}} on 20 August 1991 Estonian civil procedure has been gradually {{developed from the}} civil procedure of Estonian SSR to the modern civil procedure rules in force today.

Since coming into force several changes {{have been made to}} the current code with significant changes coming into force on 1 January 2009. Estonian civil procedure is mainly based on the <b>adversarial</b> <b>principle,</b> except for some specific cases and proceedings on petition where the inquisitorial principle is used. Deriving from this the parties are in most cases free to decide on what evidence to submit and whether to submit evidence at all. While the court may ask the parties to submit evidence, they are not required to do so. The situation is different in cases based on the inquisitorial principle. Estonian civil procedure does not impose many restrictions as to the kind of evidence that can be submitted.

40|$|Croatian {{criminal}} procedure has been significantly reformed in the latest, fifth legislative amendment passed in November 2013, {{which was supposed}} to fully implement the decision of the Croatian Constitutional Court of 19 July 2012 and harmonize the Criminal Procedure Act from 2008 with the Croatian Constitution and the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. The pre-trial proceedings has been particularly thoroughly restructured, inter alia, because the original provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act, which replaced the traditional judicial investigation with the state attorney's investigation, considerably disturbed the balance between the dominant tendency for efficient prosecution and punishment of offenders, and requirements for respect and protection of the defendant's fundamental rights, particularly right to a fair trial. The latest legislative amendment made a significant progress in reinforcing fair trial guarantees, including minimum defence rights. Possible limitations of certain rights are conceived as necessary exceptions, and in accordance with the proportionality principle. However, particular legislative provisions are still disputable from the perspective of fundamental fair trial guarantees. For example, the possibility for the court to found the judgement on the state attorney's records of non-adversarial examination of witness, with the sole requirement that a conviction may not exclusively or to a decisive extent, be based on these records, is contrary to requirements of <b>adversarial</b> <b>principle</b> and the principle of equality of arms. The right of the arrested person to have a lawyer in the police station is proclaimed by law, but it doesn't refer to informal police interviews. Severe breach of the right to a fair trial, although conceived as an instrument of reinforcing the protection of defendant's right to a fair trial, is opposed to the concept of substantive violations of the {{criminal procedure}} provisions that actually serve to realize and protect the right to a fair trial. Therefore it is possible to conclude that the last legislative reform of Croatian criminal procedure, regarded through the perspective of the defendant's right to a fair trial, has not completely achieved its purpose...|$|E

40|$|Despite {{a general}} {{harmonization}} of international arbitration law and arbitral procedure, {{there is no}} international consensus on how the applicable substantive law in arbitration should be ascertained and applied. In Swedish law, this issue – often {{discussed in terms of}} whether jura novit curia applies to international arbitration or not – is uncertain. This thesis makes a comparative analysis of English, French, Swedish and Swiss law in order to recommend a solution to this uncertainty. In national courts, two basic approaches exist in how to ascertain and apply the substantive law. In civil law jurisdictions, the judge is generally obliged to research the law and apply the correct legal basis ex officio under the legal maxim jura novit curia. This is the case in Sweden, France and Switzerland. The freedom of the judge to apply the law ex officio is however limited to some extent by the parties’ right of disposition and right to be heard. In common law jurisdictions, the parties are generally responsible for researching the law and presenting legal arguments. Under the <b>adversarial</b> <b>principle,</b> the judge must refrain from conducting legal research and from raising legal issues ex officio. Such is the case, for example, in England. When foreign law is applied in national courts, however, the differences between the common and civil law jurisdictions appear less drastic. In England as well as in France, Sweden and Switzerland, it is generally the parties who are responsible for ascertaining the content of the applicable foreign law. Yet, in Sweden and France, the court still has a secondary responsibility for ascertaining the content of foreign law. In international arbitration, the arbitral tribunal generally enjoys considerable liberty in ascertaining and applying the applicable substantive law. Rules applied in national courts are rarely imposed in international arbitral procedure. In Sweden, however, this issue is uncertain. In England, France and Switzerland, at least two factors are common: (1) the parties are generally responsible for ascertaining the content of the applicable substantive law, and (2) the arbitral tribunal enjoys a discretionary power to research the law and raise legal issues ex officio, this authority is limited by the parties’ right to be heard on points of law. The underlying principle is that the arbitral tribunal may not take the parties by surprise when it applies the law; the parties must be afforded an opportunity to comment if the arbitral tribunal considers application of legal rules, principles, sources or arguments, to which the parties have not referred. This deference to a discretionary power of the arbitral tribunal and the parties’ right to be heard on points of law is also supported in other key sources of international arbitration law. This thesis suggests that the principles based on commonalities in the examined jurisdictions should also be applied in international arbitral procedure in Sweden. Consequently, jura novit curia, as it is understood in Swedish civil litigation, should not be applied in international commercial arbitration...|$|E
