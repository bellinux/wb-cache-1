40|$|We {{present a}} {{computational}} algorithm for isotrigon texture discrimination. The {{aim of this}} method consists in discriminating isotrigon textures against a binary random background. The extension of the method {{to the problem of}} multitexture discrimination is considered as well. The method relies {{on the fact that the}} information content of time or space-frequency representations of signals, including images, can be readily analyzed by means of generalized entropy measures. In such a scenario, the Rényi entropy appears as an effective tool, given that Rényi measures can be used to provide information about a local neighborhood within an image. Localization is essential for comparing images on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Discrimination is performed through a local Rényi entropy measurement applied on a spatially oriented 1 -D pseudo-Wigner distribution (PWD) of the test image. The PWD is normalized so that it may be interpreted as a probability distribution. Prior to the calculation of the texture's PWD, a preprocessing filtering step replaces the original texture with its localized spatially oriented <b>Allan</b> <b>variances.</b> The anisotropic structure of the textures, as revealed by the <b>Allan</b> <b>variances,</b> turns out to be crucial later to attain a high discrimination by the extraction of Rényi entropy measures. The method has been empirically evaluated with a family of isotrigon textures embedded in a binary random background. The extension to the case of multiple isotrigon mosaics has also been considered. Discrimination results are compared with other existing methods. © 2008 Optical Society of America.

40|$|Our work {{is focused}} on the {{investigation}} of an influence of an additive thermal noise and a multiplicative phase noise in space communication chains. The most important properties of both noise types are summarized. The main concern of this paper is on the multiplicative phase noise that is especially important in systems with the phase shift keying. The simulation procedure for modeling of a signal degraded by the multiplicative phase noise is described. One starts from the frequency domain, where noise properties are set up. Five basic phase noise types can be included. After a passing to the time domain, the final noisy signal is obtained. To prove the modeling correctness, two ways are used. Firstly, <b>Allan</b> <b>variances</b> are utilized as a time domain processing. Finally, for a comparison, the direct conversion formula from the frequency to the time domain is exploited. Created signal corrupted by the phase noise expresses the harmonic oscillator output signal. A pair of these oscillators, disturbed by different phase noise processes, is installed into a communication channel model and with its help, the simultaneous influence of both oscillators on the useful signal is examined. Results show a good coincidence with theoretical presumptions...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, it {{is shown}} that two popular conceptions about the {{behavior}} of negative power law (neg-p) noise—that is, noise with a PSD Lp(f) |f| p for p< 0 —are based on myth and that the reality is quite different. The first myth is that one can “fix ” a neg-p divergence problem in a variance like a standard or N-sample variance simply by replacing it with an <b>Allan</b> or Hadamard <b>variance</b> without further action. The paper will show that each type of variance has a different interpretation as an error measure and that such arbitrary swapping merely masks the true problem. In the process, we will show that such variance divergences are true indicators of severe system or modeling problems that must be physically addressed, not ignored. The second myth is that one can use ensemble-based statistical estimation techniques like least squares and Kalman filters to properly estimate polynomial deterministic behavior in data containing non-highpass filtered neg-p noise. It is demonstrated that such noise can generate highly anomalous fitting results because non-highpass-filtered neg-p noise is both infinitely correlated and non-ergodic. Thus, non-p noise is shown to act more like systematic error than conventional noise in such cases...|$|R
