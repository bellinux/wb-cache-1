5|$|On {{the right}} wing of the Republican party, some of Goldwater's {{political}} positions included anti-communism, an emphasis on total victory in war and opposition to high taxes and government spending. He often criticized the politics of some of his more moderate contemporaries, including President Dwight D. Eisenhower. He criticized some aspects of Eisenhower's economic policy, citing his failure to balance the federal budget. After being written off as too right-wing to successfully wage <b>a</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>campaign,</b> Goldwater actively supported Richard Nixon's campaign against John F. Kennedy in the 1960 presidential election.|$|E
5|$|The RNC hired Albert Lasker, an {{advertising}} executive from Chicago, to publicize Harding, and Lasker unleashed a broad-based advertising campaign that used many now-standard advertising techniques {{for the first}} time in <b>a</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>campaign.</b> Lasker's approach included newsreels and sound recordings. Visitors to Marion had their photographs taken with Senator and Mrs. Harding, and copies were sent to their hometown newspapers. Billboard posters, newspapers and magazines were employed in addition to motion pictures. Telemarketers were used to make phone calls with scripted dialogues to promote Harding.|$|E

5|$|Born in 1860, Bryan grew up {{in rural}} Illinois and in 1887 moved to Nebraska, where he practiced law and entered politics. He won {{election}} to the House of Representatives in 1890, and was re-elected in 1892, before mounting an unsuccessful US Senate run. He {{set his sights on}} higher office, believing he could be elected president in 1896 even though he remained a relatively minor figure in the Democratic Party. In anticipation of <b>a</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>campaign,</b> he spent much of 1895 and early 1896 making speeches across the United States; his compelling oratory increased his popularity in his party.|$|E
5|$|Since Herrick and {{his brother}} began selling {{manipulated}} taxidermy heads in the 1930s, such trophies, as well as jackalope postcards and related gift-shop items, {{can be found in}} many places beyond Douglas. The student magazine of the Santa Fe University of Art and Design in New Mexico is called The Jackalope. On {{the other side of the}} world, The Hop Factory craft beer cafe in Newcastle, Australia, uses a leaping jackalope as its logo. In 1986, James Abdnor, a senator from South Dakota, gave U.S. President Ronald Reagan a stuffed jackalope (rabbit head with antlers) during <b>a</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>campaign</b> stop in Rapid City.|$|E
5|$|Kemp was {{considered}} {{the star of the}} 1992 Republican National Convention. In 1992 and 1993, Kemp {{was considered}} the favorite or co-favorite for the 1996 Presidential nomination. At the time of the 1994 mid-term elections, Kemp was widely anticipated to announce his candidacy for 1996, and his supporters wanted a formal announcement {{by the end of the}} year. In January 1995, Kemp's stated reason for not entering the 1996 Republican Party presidential primaries was that his personal beliefs were out of balance with the contemporary Republican political landscape: Kemp opposed term limits, he always preferred tax cuts to anything resembling a balanced budget amendment and, unlike most Republicans, favored federal incentives to combat urban poverty. In 1995, Gloria Borger noted Kemp was not in step with the 1994 Contract with America. Kemp also noted a distaste for the vast fundraising necessary for <b>a</b> <b>Presidential</b> <b>campaign.</b> Gergen stated that by 1996 the selection process had become so expensive, mean and personally invasive that it discouraged several top Republicans from running. In 1995, while the world awaited the campaign decision announcement by Colin Powell, Kemp had positive thoughts on the prospect of such a campaign.|$|E

5|$|When World War II focused President Franklin D. Roosevelt's {{attention}} on foreign affairs, Barkley gained {{influence over the}} administration's domestic agenda. He resigned as floor leader after Roosevelt ignored his advice and vetoed the Revenue Act of 1943. The veto was overridden and the Democratic caucus supported and unanimously re-elected Barkley {{to the position of}} Majority Leader. Barkley had a good working relationship with Harry S. Truman, who ascended to the presidency after Roosevelt's death in 1945. With Truman's popularity waning entering the 1948 Democratic National Convention, Barkley gave a keynote address that energized the delegates. Truman selected him as his running mate for the upcoming election and the Democratic ticket scored an upset victory. Barkley took {{an active role in the}} Truman administration, acting as its primary spokesman, especially after the Korean War necessitated the majority of Truman's attention. When Truman announced that he would not seek re-election in 1952, Barkley began organizing <b>a</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>campaign,</b> but labor leaders refused to endorse his candidacy because of his age, and he withdrew from the race. He retired but was coaxed back into public life, defeating incumbent Republican Senator John Sherman Cooper in 1954. Barkley died of a heart attack while giving a speech at the Washington and Lee Mock Convention on April 30, 1956.|$|E

In 2006 he cooperated with Charlyne Berens who wrote a biography entitled Chuck Hagel: Moving Forward. On September 10, 2007, Hagel {{announced that he would}} retire and not seek a third term.

On November 13, 2006, Giuliani announced during a leadership conference in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania that he had taken the first step toward a potential 2008 White House bid by forming the Rudy Giuliani Presidential Exploratory Committee, Inc., allowing him to raise money for national travel and for <b>a</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>campaign.</b>|$|E

In addition, Pataki has formed an environmental consulting firm with his {{former chief of staff}} John Cahill, the Pataki-Cahill Group and work with the Council on Foreign Relations on climate change issues.

25|$|From May 1993 to April 1994, he was Minister of Finance and {{resigned}} in April 1994 to launch <b>a</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>campaign.</b> In the October 3 election, {{he won the}} presidency on {{the first round of}} voting with 54% of the vote, more than twice that of his nearest opponent, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. This is still the largest margin of victory ever recorded in a free election in Brazilian history. After the constitution was amended to allow a president to succeed himself, he won a second term almost as easily in 1998, taking 53% to Lula's 31.7%. To date, he is the only president to win an outright majority of the popular vote, and the only one to win office without a runoff election since the popular elections were reinstated in 1989.|$|E
25|$|Romney {{initially}} {{supported a}} regional greenhouse gas cap-and-trade initiative for New England and eastern Canada, but he ultimately withdrew his support {{when he was}} unable to ensure establishment of certain limits on the penalty fees businesses would be charged for exceeding emissions allowances. A week later, his administration issued a rule allowing companies to pay a fine instead of having to clean up emissions of toxins like mercury. Both decisions were made as Romney announced he would not run for a second term as governor and began to focus on entering the 2008 presidential campaign. Some former Romney policy advisors later told the New York Times that his political team had been afraid that, with industry being opposed to the cap-and-trade proposal, Romney's having included Massachusetts in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative would have made Romney's chance of winning <b>a</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>campaign</b> very unlikely.|$|E
25|$|Nixon won {{a resounding}} {{victory in the}} {{important}} New Hampshire primary on March 12, with 78% of the vote. Anti-war Republicans wrote {{in the name of}} New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller, the leader of the Republican Party's liberal wing, who received 11% of the vote and became Nixon's new challenger. Rockefeller had originally not intended to run, having discounted a campaign for the nomination in 1965 and planned on making Senator Jacob Javits the favorite son, either in preparation of <b>a</b> <b>presidential</b> <b>campaign</b> or to secure him the second spot on the ticket; as Rockefeller warmed to the idea of entering the race again however, Javits moved his attentions back towards seeking a third term in the Senate. Nixon led Rockefeller in the polls throughout the primary campaign, and though Rockefeller defeated Nixon and Governor John Volpe in the Massachusetts primary on April 30, he otherwise fared poorly in state primaries and conventions, having declared too late to place his name on state ballots.|$|E
