The following year, Ferraro was assigned to the new Special Victims Bureau, which prosecuted cases involving rape, child abuse, spouse abuse, and domestic violence. She was named head of the unit in 1977, with two other <b>assistant</b> <b>district</b> attorneys assigned to her. In this role, she became a strong advocate for abused children.

Meanwhile, Fassl approaches <b>Assistant</b> <b>District</b> Attorney Damon Kaylor and begs to {{be sent back to}} prison. Kaylor refuses, but is killed by the Bearded Man.

Working under lead prosecutor Laurence Howard Eldredge and alongside assistant prosecutor Lemuel Braddock Schofield, Sawyer assisted in the trial of Chief Magistrate John J. O'Malley for 206 counts of malfeasance in office. O'Malley was found not guilty in two trials in 1948 and 1949.

5|$|For {{the open}} office of {{district}} attorney, vacated by Dilworth {{when he ran}} for mayor, the Democrats nominated city councilman Victor H. Blanc against the Republicans' Wilhelm F.

5|$|However, {{given the}} length of time the abuse has been going on, Connie is afraid no one will believe her. The <b>assistant</b> <b>district</b> {{attorney}} assigned to the case, Rhonda Preshutski (Christine Dunford) agrees, believing the case to be weak. Child Protective Services cannot remove Sara from the household until Connie undergoes a psychiatric evaluation, although Black and police lieutenant Bob Bletcher (Bill Smitrovich) investigate the Bangs home to check up on the girl. The father, Joe Bangs (Paul Dooley), chases them off as his wife watches detachedly. Bangs wields a degree of political clout in the community, and pressures the district attorney's office to drop the case. Preshutski is furious with Black over the matter, until it is discovered from Connie's medical exams that Sara is not her sister, but her daughter.|$|E

5|$|In an {{arrangement}} that predates the 1951 City Charter, Philadelphia elects a District Attorney independent of the mayor's office. Dilworth had been elected to the office in 1951 but resigned in 1955 to run for mayor. Victor H. Blanc, a city councilman and former <b>assistant</b> <b>district</b> attorney, was elected to fill the unexpired term. Blanc was a veteran of both World Wars who, during his time on the council, led an investigation into corruption in construction at Philadelphia International Airport. In 1957, he ran for a full four-year term, but his connection with machine politics led Clark and Dilworth to withhold their endorsement of him. The Republican nominee was Emil F. Goldhaber, a local lawyer who {{had worked in the}} state attorney general's office and in private practice. He was unopposed in the primary. The split in the Democratic leadership made the district attorney's race the liveliest of the campaign, according to Philadelphia Inquirer writer Joseph H. Miller.|$|E
5|$|In the November 1980 general elections, Governor Romero BarcelÃ³ was re-elected by {{a margin}} of 3,503 votes (one of the closest in Puerto Rico history), though his party lost control of the state {{legislature}} to the main opposition party, the PPD. This loss was attributed by The New York Times to the surrounding controversy regarding the investigations at the time. Other news organizations, such as Time, attributed the loss to Gov. Romero Barcelo's stance on the island's political status. The Legislature quickly started new inquiries and hearings into the Cerro Maravilla incident. The Senate, then presided by Miguel HernÃ¡ndez Agosto, spearheaded the investigations by naming former <b>Assistant</b> <b>District</b> Attorney Hector Rivera Cruz to investigate.|$|E
5|$|In the at-large races, {{all five}} Democrats were elected, {{including}} city party chairman James A. Finnegan, former registration commissioner Victor E.

The Republican slate ran more than 100,000 votes behind the Democrats, with incumbent councilman Louis Schwartz and state senator John W. Lord, Jr. narrowly edging out labor leader John B. Backhus, <b>assistant</b> <b>district</b> attorney Colbert C. McClain, and clergyman Irwin W. Underhill {{for the two}} minority party slots on the council. The Progressive Party, a left-wing party founded in 1948 around Henry A. Wallace's presidential bid, ran two candidates who took {{less than one percent}} of the vote.|$|E
