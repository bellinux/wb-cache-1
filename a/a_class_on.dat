25|$|In 1993 Gianfranco De Bellis became co-proprietor. Tatuus then-on {{focused on}} {{producing}} Formula Renault cars. The Tatuus RC95 {{was the first}} Formula Renault car made by Tatuus. The Tatuus factory team fielded three drivers, Italian Rino Mastronardi, Norwegian Tommy Rustad and Brazilian Enrique Bernoldi. The team competed in the Eurocup Formula Renault, Tommy Rustad won three races during the inaugural season for the team. The first title for the Tatuus factory team and chassis came in 1996. Enrique Bernoldi won six out of ten races and took the title. Teammate Danilo Cascio was places seventh. David Cook entered a Tatuus customer car in the British Formula Renault championship. In this very competitive championship Cook beat Darren Turner to the 1996 title. Other customer Tatuus chassis were entered in the French Formula Renault, Antoine Brousseau achieved a {{second place in the}} championship. A Tatuus chassis also took the title in the German Formula Renault with driver Alexander Müller. 1997 was a highly successful for the team and the chassis. The team scored a one-two finish in the European championship. Jeffrey van Hooydonk and Max Busnelli were <b>a</b> <b>class</b> <b>on</b> their own securing the first and second place in the championship. The top ten were seven Tatuus and three Martini cars. Three Tatuus customer entries filled the podium in the German championship. Robert Lechner won the title in front of Thomas Mutsch and Michael Schröter. Marc Hynes, driving a customer Tatuus, won the British title. The French championship, however, was a different story. France, home of Mygale, Martini and Renault, had the most competitive Formula Renault championship. Benoît Tréluyer driving a Tatuus was placed sixth in the championship standings, scoring one win and four podium finishes out of 17 races. Tatuus again was the chassis to beat in the European, British and German championships. Lucas Lasserre managed to achieve a third place in the French championship, behind two factory entered Mygales. Tatuus again dominated the British championship in 1999 with Tatuus chassis winning 12 out of 13 races, Antônio Pizzonia took the title. Tatuus customer entries also won the European and German championships. Lucas Lasserre now took the title in the prestigious French championship. In heavy competition between Mygale, Martini and Tatuus, Tatuus prevailed winning 14 out of 21 races.|$|E

Munroe signed up after hearing about it from a friend and decided to teach <b>a</b> <b>class</b> <b>on</b> energy. Though the lecture felt [...] "dry" [...] at first, once Munroe started bringing up examples from Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings, the students became more excited.

She was a straight-A student at Wellesley College, graduating with a BA in English in 1912. She found particular gifts in <b>a</b> <b>class</b> <b>on</b> elocution, and joined the first suffrage club with six of her classmates. She was elected as [...] "Class Orator" [...] at Wellesley, but was unable to fulfill the office since she was already involved in other activities. During her senior year while visiting home, her mother showed her a lump on her breast. Marjory arranged the surgery to have it removed. After the graduation ceremony, her aunt informed her it had metastasized, and within months her mother was dead. The family left making the funeral arrangements up to Marjory.|$|E

He talks to the administrator and accepts an opening to teach <b>a</b> <b>class</b> <b>on</b> having a successful marriage.

The class collectively gets up to leave, but when Homer mentions his conversation with Marge in bed, the class decides to stay, eager to hear gossip. Marge soon discovers that everyone in town knows her personal secrets, reacting by confronting Homer about it and he promises to stop. He instead continues telling her secrets anyway. Homer then takes the night off teaching class by having his class observe the family over dinner.|$|E
500|$|The World Grand Championship, {{also known}} as the [...] "Big Stake" [...] or [...] "Rider's Cup, Canter" [...] is the final class of the Celebration. It is held late on the Saturday night before Labor Day, or more often, very early Sunday morning. To compete in the stake, horses must qualify by showing in <b>a</b> <b>class</b> <b>on</b> the first Saturday night of the show. Previous World Grand Champions are {{automatically}} eligible to compete again. The competing horses enter the arena to the song [...] "Flat Walk Boogie" [...] which was composed and is played by official TWHNC organist Larry Bright. Horses are required to perform the flat walk, running walk and canter twice each in two separate workouts. Between workouts, riders dismount and unsaddle their horses so the judges can evaluate their conformation. The winner is announced by a spotlight sweeping back and forth along the line-up of horses and then settling on the World Grand Champion.|$|E
500|$|Hubbard's {{academic}} record, {{which came}} to light in the 1970s, revealed {{that he had been}} a student in George Washington University's School of Engineering and had majored in civil engineering. He attended the summer semester in 1931 and the fall and spring semesters in 1931–32. In September 1931, he was placed on probation and he failed to return for the fall 1932 semester. A Scientology account says that he [...] "excell in but thoroughly detest his subjects"; while the latter may have been true, the former certainly was not, as his grades were consistently poor. At the end of his first year, he received a D average grade, earning an A for physical education, B for English, C for mechanical engineering, D for general chemistry and Fs for German and calculus. During his second year, he enrolled in <b>a</b> <b>class</b> <b>on</b> atomic and molecular physics– the [...] "nuclear physics" [...] course cited in his official biographies– but earned an F grade. His other grades were also poor, ranging from a B for English to D in calculus and electrical and magnetic physics. He dropped out soon afterwards. Although Hubbard told Look magazine in 1950 that [...] "I never took my degree," [...] a biography published a few years later by the Church of Scientology's Ability magazine nonetheless identifies him as the holder of a [...] "B. S. in Civil Engineering".|$|E
