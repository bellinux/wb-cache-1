5|$|The Analytical Review {{was meant}} to {{enlighten}} the public {{as well as to}} simplify communication between <b>authors</b> separated by great distances; most importantly, the debates between those <b>authors</b> could be read by the public.

5|$|The <b>authors</b> {{have named}} several other <b>authors</b> {{as sources of}} {{inspiration}} when writing the novels.

The <b>authors</b> have also mentioned several other sources of inspiration. The New Forest in southern England was the base for the forest where the original series took place. Other influential locations include Loch Lomond, as well as the Scottish Highlands. Nicholas Culpeper, a physician who used materials occurring in the natural world as medicine, also had an influence on the Warriors series. His book, Culpeper's Herbal, is used as a source by the <b>authors</b> for the herbal remedies that the cats use in the books. In addition, the <b>authors</b> suggested that they may use some fan-created names in future books. Also mentioned as a source of inspiration was the film series Rambo.|$|E

In the opinion of J. Isamu Yamamoto the main difference is that Christianity preaches a personal God while Taoism does not.
