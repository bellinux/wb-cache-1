5|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> passed, General Walker {{decided that}} the {{situation}} was most critical in the Naktong Bulge area of the US 2nd Division sector. There the North Koreans threatened Miryang {{and with it the}} entire Eighth Army position. At 11:00 Walker ordered US Marine Corps Brigadier General Edward A. Craig, commanding the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade, to prepare the marines to move at once. The marines made ready to depart for the Naktong Bulge at 13:30.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> progressed and {{the light}} changed he would switch to {{sequentially}} later canvas settings, sometimes working on as many as ten or twelve paintings a day, each one depicting a slightly different aspect of light. The process would be repeated {{over the course of}} days, weeks, or months, depending on the weather and the progress of the paintings until they were completed. As the seasons changed the process was renewed.|$|E
5|$|Several local meteorologists, however, did {{depart from}} the {{official}} predictions of a Tampa Bay landfall as early <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> of August 13. Jim Farrell of WINK, Robert Van Winkle WBBH, Steve Jerve of WFLA in Tampa, Jim Reif of WZVN in Fort Myers, and Tom Terry of WFTV in Orlando, all broke with their national news forecasts and stated at around 1500 UTC that Charley {{was going to turn}} early, striking around Charlotte Harbor and traveling over Orlando, as would prove to be the case.|$|E

5|$|As {{the battle}} around Taechon {{dragged into the}} night of November 26, the ROK 11th Infantry Regiment on the division's right became disorganized. Brigadier General Paik Sun Yup of the ROK 1st Infantry Division soon brought up the 15th Infantry Regiment from his reserve to relieve the 11th Infantry Regiment. After {{receiving}} news on the Chinese attack against the 25th Division across the Kuryong River, Paik had also directed his division to defend against the upcoming Chinese counteroffensive. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> came on November 27, the Chinese troops around Taechon did not stop their assault even under punishing UN air strikes, {{and some of the}} attacks spilled into US 24th Infantry Division's area. Upon noticing their flank was buckling, the US 24th Infantry Division and the US 35th Infantry Regiment started the retreat southward to the Ch'ongch'on River.|$|E
5|$|Despite German {{claims that}} the {{blockage}} did not impede their operations, the operation to close the Ostend canal {{seemed to have been}} at least partially successful. The channel was largely blocked and so Bruges was ostensibly closed off from the open sea, even if the position of the blockship meant that smaller ships could get through. In fact, the entire operation had been rendered moot before it even began, due to events at the wider canal in Zeebrugge. British assessments of that operation had proven optimistic and the channel there had not been properly closed. Small coastal submarines of the UC class had been able to pass through the channel as early <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> after the Zeebrugge Raid and German naval engineers were able to dredge channels around the blockages at both ports over the coming weeks.|$|E
5|$|Ebla was a polytheistic state. During {{the first}} kingdom, Eblaites worshiped their dead kings. The pantheon {{of the first}} Ebla {{included}} pairs of deities {{and they can be}} separated into three genres; in the first and most common one, there were the couples, such as the deity and his female consort. The second type of pairs was the divine twosomes, such as the deities that cooperate to create the cosmos, like in the Egyptian and Mesopotamian pantheons. The third type included divine pairs who were actually a single deity that had two names. Eblaites worshiped few Mesopotamian deities, preferring North-Western Semitic gods, some of which were unique to Ebla. The first genre of pairs included Nidakul, who was exclusive to Ebla, and his consort, Belatu ("his wife"); Rasap and his consort Adamma; the patron gods of the city Kura, who was unique to Ebla, and his consort Barama. The third genre included the artisan god Kamish/Tit, Kothar-wa-Khasis and the planet Venus represented by twin mountain Gods; Shahar <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> star and Shalim as the evening star.|$|E

5|$|In 1966, Whitney and Thayer {{attempted}} to organize {{what would have}} been New York's first joint operating agreement (JOA) with the Hearst-owned New York Journal American and the Scripps-owned New York World-Telegram and Sun. Under the proposed agreement, the Herald Tribune would have continued publication <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> partner and the Journal-American and World-Telegram would merge as the World Journal, an afternoon paper. All three would publish a Sunday edition called the World Journal Tribune. The newspapers would have maintained their own editorial voices (all three of which tended to be conservative). On paper, the JOA, which would have taken effect April 25, 1966, would have led to profits of $4 million to $5 million annually, but would have also led to the loss of 1,764 out of 4,598 employees at the papers. The Newspaper Guild, concerned about the possible job losses, said the new newspaper would have to negotiate a new contract with the union; the publishers refused. The day the JOA was supposed to go into effect, the Guild struck the newly merged newspaper (the Times continued to publish).|$|E
5|$|The Chinese {{promptly}} withdrew <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> came on November 26, and a counterattack by the 38th Infantry Regiment later reopened {{the road}} to the rear. When the ROK 3rd Infantry Regiment of the ROK 7th Infantry Division suddenly appeared in the 38th Infantry Regiment's sector, Colonel George B. Peploe of the 38th Infantry Regiment realized the right flank of the US 2nd Infantry Division and the entire Eighth Army had collapsed. Under orders from Major General Laurence B. Keiser, commander of the US 2nd Infantry Division, Colonel Peploe immediately took command of the ROK 3rd Infantry Regiment while trying to refuse his right flank. At the same time, Colonel Paul L. Freeman of the 23rd Infantry Regiment had also tried to lead his regiment to capture Chinaman's Hat, but without much success.|$|E
5|$|The {{pages of}} the Grolier Codex contain seven hieroglyphs {{representing}} days; the style of these glyphs {{differs from that of}} the other three Maya codices but is most similar to the glyphs of the Dresden Codex. The glyphs are arranged in vertical columns incorporating day signs accompanied by a number; each date corresponds to a manifestation of Venus. Whereas the Venus almanac in the Dresden Codex documents the planet after inferior conjunction <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> star, the Grolier Codex documents all four of the stations of Venus: rising after inferior conjunction as morning star in the east, disappearance before superior conjunction, reappearance as evening star in the west and disappearance before inferior conjunction.|$|E

5|$|Two {{weeks after}} winning the Kentucky Derby, American Pharoah entered the second leg of the Triple Crown, the 2015 Preakness Stakes, run over {{nine and a half}} furlongs at Pimlico Race Course. Despite an {{unfavorable}} inside draw of the number one post position, he was installed <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> line favorite ahead of Firing Line and Dortmund. No horse had won the Preakness starting from the rail since 1994. Immediately before post time, the weather changed to a heavy downpour with thunder. The last time the Preakness had been run on a sloppy track was in 1983, and American Pharoah was the only horse in the field to have previously faced similar conditions, having won the Rebel Stakes running in rain and mud.|$|E
5|$|All {{along the}} ANZAC perimeter, Turkish troops {{continued}} trying to advance using fire and manoeuvre. This gradually petered out <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> progressed, and the Turks tried {{to regain their}} own lines instead. The Australians and New Zealanders continued to fire on them, sometimes showing themselves above their trenches. The Turks were now able to return fire, which caused {{the majority of the}} ANZAC casualties. It was now clear to the Australians and New Zealanders that the Turkish attack was a failure. However, a report arrived at Turkish headquarters suggesting that some objectives had been captured. So the Turkish commanders issued orders, at 05:00, for a second assault, this time to be supported by an artillery bombardment. Over the next few hours several new attacks began. At 05:25 the 2nd and 5th Divisions attacked again, but instead of moving directly at the Australian lines, they advanced at an angle, and were again mown down. At No.1 Post in the No.4 Section the Canterbury Mounted Rifles observed the Turks forming in Malone's Gully, in preparation for another assault on Russell's Top. The location of the post was such that they could turn their machine-gun and engage the Turks from the rear, which broke up the attack. The Turks attacked Quinn's four more times, and on one occasion an officer and around thirty men managed to reach the junction of Courtney's and Quinn's before being killed. This pattern of attack was kept up until around 10:00, when Allied observers reported a reluctance among the Turkish troops to leave their trenches.|$|E

25|$|In native Greek tradition, {{the planet}} Venus had two names: Hesperos {{as the evening}} star and Eosphoros <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> star.
