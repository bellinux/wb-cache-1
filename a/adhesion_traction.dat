40|$|Directed cell {{migration}} is mediated by cycles of protrusion, <b>adhesion,</b> <b>traction</b> generation on the extracellular matrix and retraction. However, how the events after protrusion are timed, and what dictates their temporal order is completely unknown. We used acute {{epidermal growth factor}} (EGF) stimulation of epidermal keratinocytes to initiate the {{cell migration}} cycle to study the mechanism of the timing of <b>adhesion,</b> <b>traction</b> generation, and de-adhesion. Using microscopic and biochemical assays, we surprisingly found that at ∼ 2 min after EGF stimulation protrusion, activation of myosin-II, traction generation, adhesion assembly, and paxillin phosphorylation occurred nearly simultaneously, followed by a 10 -min delay during which paxillin became dephosphorylated before cell retraction. Inhibition of myosin-II blocked both the EGF-stimulated paxillin phosphorylation and cell retraction, and a paxillin phosphomimic blocked retraction. These results suggest that EGF-mediated activation of myosin-II acts as a mechanical signal to promote a cycle of paxillin phosphorylation/dephosphorylation that mediates a cycle of adhesion strengthening and weakening that delays cell retraction. Thus, we reveal {{for the first time}} a mechanism by which cells may temporally segregate protrusion, adhesion, and traction generation from retraction during EGF-stimulated cell migration...|$|E

40|$|To {{understand}} how adherent cells regulate traction forces on their surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM), quantitative techniques {{are needed to}} measure forces at the cell–ECM interface. Microcontact printing is {{used to create a}} substrate of 1 μm diameter circles of ECM ligand to experimentally study the reconstruction of traction stresses at constrained, point-like focal <b>adhesions.</b> <b>Traction</b> reconstruction with point forces (TRPF) and Fourier transform traction cytometry (FTTC) are used to calculate the traction forces and stress field, respectively, at isolated adhesions. We find that the stress field calculated with FTTC peaks near the center of individual adhesions but propagates several microns beyond the adhesion location. We find the optimal set of FTTC parameters that yield the highest stress magnitude, minimizing information lost from over-smoothing and sampling of the displacement or stress field. A positive correlation between the TRPF and FTTC measurements exists, but integrating the FTTC stress field over the adhesion area yields {{only a small fraction of}} the force calculated by TRPF. An effective area similar to that defined by the width of the stress distribution measured with FTTC is required to reconcile these measurements.

40|$|ABSTRACT We {{examine the}} {{relationships}} of three variables (projected area, migration speed, and traction force) at various type I collagen surface densities in a population of fibroblasts. We observe that cell area is initially an increasing function of ligand density, but that above a certain transition level, increases in surface collagen cause cell area to decline. The threshold collagen density that separates these two qualitatively different regimes,; 160 molecules/mm 2, is approximately equal to the cell surface density of integrin molecules. These results suggest a model in which collagen density induces a qualitative transition in the fundamental way that fibroblasts interact with the substrate. At low density, the availability of collagen binding sites is limiting and the cells simply try to flatten {{as much as possible}} by pulling on the few available sites as hard as they can. The force per bond under these conditions approaches 100 pN, approximately equal to the force required for rupture of integrin-peptide bonds. In contrast, at high collagen density <b>adhesion,</b> <b>traction</b> force and motility are limited by the availability of free integrins on the cell surface since so many of these receptors are bound to the surface ligand and the force per bond is very low...|$|E

40|$|The {{traction}} control in modern electric and diesel electric locomotives has allowed rail operators to utilise high <b>traction</b> <b>adhesion</b> levels without undue {{risk of damage}} from uncontrolled wheel spin. At the same time, some locomotive manufacturers have developed passive steering locomotive bogies to reduce wheel rail wear and further improve locomotive adhesion performance on curves. High locomotive traction loads in curving are known to cause the loss of steering performance in passive steering bogies. At present there are few publications on the curving performance of locomotive steering with linkage bogies. The most extreme traction curving cases of low speed and high adhesion for hauling locomotives have not been fully investigated, with effects of coupler forces and cant excess being generally ignored. This paper presents a simulation study for three axle bogie locomotives in pusher and pulling train positions on tight curves. The simulation study uses moderate and high <b>traction</b> <b>adhesion</b> levels of 16. 6 % and 37 % for various rail friction conditions. Curving performance is assessed, showing forced steering bogies to have considerable advantages over self steering bogies. Likewise it is shown that self steering bogies are significantly better than yaw relaxation bogies at improving steering under traction. As the required <b>traction</b> <b>adhesion</b> approaches the rail friction coefficient, steering performance of all bogies degrades and yaw of the bogie frame relative to the track increases. Operation with excess cant and tensile coupler forces are both found to be detrimental to the wear performance of all locomotive bogies, increasing the bogie frame yaw angles. Bogie frame pitching is also found to have significant effect on steering, causing increased performance differences between bogie designs...|$|R

Methods: The study included 189 patients (239 eyes) with peripheral retinal degeneration. 77 men and 112 women aged 18 to  84 underwent an ophthalmologic examination since November 2012 until October 2013. The peripheral retina was visualized {{with the help of}} optical coherence tomography («RTVue- 100,» USA). The fundography was carried out using a Nikon NF 505 ‑AF (Japan) fundus camera. All patients were examined with a Goldmann lens. Results: Optical coherence tomography was used to evaluate different kinds of peripheral retinal degenerations, such as lattice and snail track degeneration, isolated retinal tears, cystoid retinal degeneration, pathological hyperpigmentation, retinoschisis and cobblestone degeneration.  The following morphometric data were studied: dimensions of the lesion (average length), retinal thickness along the edge of the lesion, retinal thickness {{at the base of the}} lesion and the vitreoretinal interface.

40|$|Collective {{migration}} {{is a basic}} mechanism of cell translocation during morphogenesis, wound repair and cancer invasion. Collective movement requires cells to retain cell-cell contacts, exhibit group polarization with defined front-rear asymmetry, and consequently move as one multicellular unit. Depending on the cell type, morphology {{of the group and}} the tissue context, distinct mechanisms control the leading edge dynamics and guidance. Leading edge migration may either result from adhesion to ECM and contractile pulling, or from forward pushing. The leading edge consists of either one or few dedicated tip cells or a multicellular leading row that generate <b>adhesion</b> and <b>traction</b> towards the tissue substrate. Alternatively, a multicellular bud consisting of many cells protrudes collectively by proliferation and growth thereby mechanically expanding and pushing towards the tissue stroma. Each type of collective guidance engages distinct spatiotemporal molecular control and feedback towards rearward cells and the adjacent tissue microenvironment; these include intrinsic polarity mechanisms regulated by the interplay between cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions; or the heterotypic integration of stromal cells that adopt leader cell functions.

40|$|Mechanical forces play an {{important}} role in the regulation of cellular behavior and physiological processes including adhesion, migration, proliferation, tissue repair, embryogenesis and development. In addition, a number of diseases including cancer, have been linked to changes in cellular and extracellular mechanical properties. However, whether a correlation exists between the progression of cancer towards metastasis and mechanical factors has not been clearly defined. Additionally, how a cell responds to changes in extracellular mechanical cues as it gains metastatic abilities is poorly understood. To address these questions, we have utilized a panel of murine breast cancer cell lines with progressive metastatic. We have asked how the cells ability to produce mechanical forces changes as the cells progress in metastatic abilities. Furthermore we have asked if metastatic progression changes the cells ability to respond to altered extracellular mechanical cues in two-dimensional in-vitro cultures. Our results indicate that with metastatic progression, the strength of <b>adhesion</b> and <b>traction</b> stress progressively decreases. Furthermore we observe a downward trend in the number of focal adhesions at the leading edge, and subsequent reduction in the activation of integrin beta 1 and migration speed. We have also found that this cell panel loses its ability to sense changes in compliance as metastatic abilities increase and that this occurs in a fibronectin dependent manner. We found that the loss in mechanical sensing is associated with a decrease in integrin (alpha 3) beta 1 activation and FAKpY 397. Finally, we showed that when a transient mechanical cue is provided, and coupled to changes in compliance, normal and non-metastatic cells respond preferentially to the transient cue. However, the metastatic cells neither sensed changes in compliance, nor did they respond to the transient stimulation. Together these results show that a cells ability to produce mechanical force, and sense extracellular mechanical forces, progressively decrease with the gain of metastatic characteristics...|$|R
