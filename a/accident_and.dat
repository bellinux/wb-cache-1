5|$|Lack of {{evidence}} in determining the cause of Flight 370's disappearance, even physical evidence that the aircraft crashed, raises many issues regarding responsibility for the <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> payments made by insurance agencies. Under the Montreal Convention, it is the carrier's responsibility to prove lack of fault in an <b>accident</b> <b>and</b> each passenger's next-of-kin are automatically entitled, regardless of fault, to a payment of approximately US$175,000 from the airline's insurance company—a total of nearly US$40million for the 227 passengers on board.|$|E

40|$|Marriage {{may reduce}} the risk of <b>accidents</b> <b>and</b> assaults by {{promoting}} social control of health behavior. This study examines the impact of marital status on non-fatal <b>accidents</b> <b>and</b> assaults in young British women. Data is drawn from a large cohort study of the people born in 1958. Rate ratios of overall and specific incidence of non-fatal <b>accidents</b> <b>and</b> assaults are determined by negative binomial regression, with adjustment for socio-economic and behavioral confounders. The null hypothesis of no association between marital status and incidence of non-fatal <b>accidents</b> <b>and</b> assaults is rejected. It is suggested that, independent of parental status, more exposure to marriage and less exposure to marital dissolution may reduce <b>accidents</b> <b>and</b> assaults. <b>accidents</b> assaults social control marital status Britain...|$|R

40|$|This study aims at {{identifying}} {{determinants of}} motorcyclists’s attitudes and analysing their {{influences on the}} occurrence of traffic <b>accidents</b> <b>and</b> offences. A self-reported questionnaire survey was distributed in year 2016 among {{a representative sample of}} motorcyclists in Denpasar, Bali. The questionnaire consisted variables of socioeconomic factors, the use of motorcycle and riding history, learning method and experience on riding motorcycles, motorcyclist attitudes and involvement in traffic <b>accidents</b> <b>and</b> offences. The results show that age and education level influenced learning method and experiences variables while gender did on motorcyclists’ attitude. In addition, learning method and experience and motorcyclists’ attitudes on the road were two significant factors respectively that negatively affected motorcyclists’ involvement in traffic <b>accidents</b> <b>and</b> offences. In other words, ages, education level and gender have significant indirect influences on motorcyclists’ involvement in traffic <b>accidents</b> <b>and</b> offences. The influence of gender implies that compared to females, male motorcyclists are more likely to fail giving priority and violate parking signs. In comparison with females, male motorcyclists therefore, are more likely to get involved in traffic <b>accidents</b> <b>and</b> offences. Interestingly, this study indicated that motorcyclists with a higher education were not a guarantee not to involve in traffic <b>accidents</b> <b>and</b> offences...|$|R
