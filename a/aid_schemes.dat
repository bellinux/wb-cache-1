50|$|OBA {{generally}} works {{through a}} private firm, or another third party, {{acting as the}} service provider. The service provider {{is responsible for the}} initial financing of the project and, only after results have been verified, will the firm receive subsidies from a donor. In such schemes, it is the provider who bears the risk of loss, rather than the aid donor, and output-based schemes allow for the tracking of results {{because of the way they}} function. Integration of the private sector into <b>aid</b> <b>schemes</b> is common with OBA, since they often provide the initial financing. The World Bank sees OBA as a way to improve aid effectiveness. This differs from traditional <b>aid</b> <b>schemes</b> that will usually focus on the inputs to service providers rather than the outputs. The donor is usually the World Bank, a government or an international organization or philanthropist that is part of the OBA scheme. Subsidies from a donor will generally serve to complement or reduce user fees. The subsidy is paid only after the particular service has been delivered to a community. The subsidies are targeted to poorer individuals, since OBA initiatives are carried out in regions with significant amounts of poverty.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the responsiveness of the demand for college to changes in student aid arising from a Danish reform. Student aid in Denmark is means-tested, so accounting for borrowing contraints in the analysis is crucial. We separately identify the e¤ect of aid from that of other observed and unobserved variables such as parental income. For the Danish case, we exploit the combination of a kinked <b>aid</b> <b>scheme</b> and the reform of the student <b>aid</b> <b>scheme</b> to identify the e¤ect of direct costs on college enrollment. We …nd that enrollment is less responsive than found in other studies and that the presence of borrowing constraints is neither statistically or economically important...|$|R

50|$|In Hong Kong, the Legal Aid Department {{provides}} {{funding to}} legal services {{for those who}} pass the means and merits test. The two Legal <b>Aid</b> <b>Schemes</b> that it operates, namely the Ordinary Legal Aid Scheme (OLAS) and the Supplementary Legal Aid Scheme (SLAS) have facilitated the practice of public interest law through narrowing the resource inequality between economically disadvantaged litigants and the government. However, NGOs and charitable organizations are not eligible to get legal aid. The NGOs and Charitable organizations contributed to opening of avenues for people who deserved justice but lacked interest to approach courts and helped them in becoming petitioners to get justice.|$|E
50|$|Prior to the mid-20th century, {{literature}} on legal aid emphasised collective enforcement of economic, {{social and cultural}} rights. As classic welfare states {{were built in the}} 1940s and following World War II, an underlying principle was that citizens had collective responsibility for economic, social and cultural rights; and the state assumed responsibility for those unable to provide for themselves through illness and unemployment. The enforcement of economic, social and cultural rights was to be collective, through policies rather than individual legal action. Laws were enacted to support welfare provisions, though these were regarded as laws for planners, not lawyers. Legal <b>aid</b> <b>schemes</b> were established, as it was assumed that the state had a responsibility to assist those engaged in legal disputes, but they initially focused primarily on family law and divorce.|$|E
40|$|Use of inter-loop aiding for {{improving}} tracking performance {{has been widely}} researched in recent years. However, most of the previously proposed <b>aiding</b> <b>schemes</b> rely {{on the assumption that}} the aiding loop remains unaffected by received interference. This paper argues that this may not always be the case. It is likely that the performance of the aiding loop may also degrade in the case where interference is received at the aiding carrier’s frequency resulting in performance degradation of both aiding and aided loops. This paper proposes an <b>aiding</b> <b>scheme</b> that offers performance improvements in case interference corrupts both frequencies. Also, an algorithm is proposed that continuously updates the aided loop bandwidth to keep its jitter at a minimum. A relationship between the quality of the aiding signal and its effects on the performance of the aided loop is analysed. An adaptive Kalman filter-based implementation of the aiding architecture is proposed to improve the quality of aiding estimates. This implementation offers an improved margin against received interference. Simulation and real data results are presented that show improvements of 7 and 5 dB-Hz in this margin by employing the proposed <b>aiding</b> <b>scheme</b> with and without an adaptive Kalman filter...|$|R
