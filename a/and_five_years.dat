Hinman was sentenced to between one <b>and</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> in prison. In 1957, one of Chotiner's divorce clients had been killed along with her daughter by the client's estranged husband in the attorney's Beverly Hills office.|$|E

This province covered the coastal plain from Rafah in the south to just north of Caesarea, extending in the east to the western slopes of Samaria and the Hebron Hills; its major towns were Qaqun, Ludd, and Ramla. In 1294, an earthquake devastated Gaza, <b>and</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> later the Mongols again destroyed all that was restored by the Mamluks. That same year, Gaza was the center of a conspiracy against Sultan al-Adil Kitbugha, but the plot was detected and crushed before being carried out.|$|E

The WAAAF itself, the first and largest of Australia's wartime women's services, was disbanded on 30September 1946. It was succeeded in 1950 by a new organisation with a separate charter to the RAAF, the Women's Royal Australian Air Force (WRAAF). WRAAF members achieved a pay scale equal to the male service in 1972, <b>and</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> later were integrated with the RAAF.|$|E

5|$|The {{education}} system features a non-compulsory kindergarten education followed by {{six years of}} compulsory primary education, <b>and</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> of optional secondary education. Schools in the primary {{education system}} are divided into two categories: national primary schools, which teach in Malay, and vernacular schools, which teach in Chinese or Tamil. Secondary education is conducted for five years. In {{the final year of}} secondary education, students sit for the Malaysian Certificate of Education examination. Since the introduction of the matriculation programme in 1999, students who completed the 12-month programme in matriculation colleges can enroll in local universities. However, in the matriculation system, only 10 per cent of places are open to non-bumiputera students.|$|E
5|$|The ships {{built by}} AG Vulcan—Sachsen and Württemberg—were {{completed}} in three <b>and</b> <b>five</b> <b>years,</b> respectively.

Facing the Hokies were the No. 3 Auburn Tigers, who had gone 12–0 during the regular season. Normally, Auburn's undefeated season would have been justification for a spot in the 2005 BCS National Championship Game, but because two other teams had also gone undefeated during the regular season, Auburn, as the No. 3 team in the country, was left out of the National Championship game.|$|E

In 1979 he moved to the United Kingdom (UK) to continue his higher education.

Following a series of reforms of which he was initially skeptical of, al-Jamri returned to Bahrain in December 2001. He co-founded Al-Wasat in September 2002 and became its editor-in-chief since then. The newspaper, said to be the only one offering independent and non-sectarian coverage in Bahrain was a success, becoming the country's most popular and profitable. Al-Jamri writes daily columns described to be moderate and non-sectarian.|$|E
5|$|A {{new site}} for the cathedral was {{selected}} above Caine Road by the Glenealy Ravine and {{the cornerstone of the}} new church was laid on 8 December 1883. Crawley and Company of London were hired to be the architects <b>and</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> later, construction was completed. The church opened on 7 December 1888, the vigil of the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, and was blessed one day later. The construction of the cathedral cost US$15,400, and since a Catholic church can only be consecrated once it has become free from debt, the cathedral did not have its rite of consecration held until 8 December 1938, exactly fifty years after it first opened. The ceremony was officiated by the Vicar Apostolic of Hong Kong Enrico Valtorta, the Bishop of Macau José da Costa Nunes and the Bishop Emeritus of Canton; three of the cathedral's altars were also consecrated.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{armistice}} both sides withdrew and a demilitarised zone was created.

In April 1954, 2 RAR returned to Australia and was replaced by 1 RAR which remained in South Korea until March 1956. 3 RAR finally returned to Australia in September 1954 after four years of continuous service in Korea <b>and</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> before that in Japan. Total Army casualties in Korea included 293 killed, 1,210 wounded and 23 captured, the majority being infantrymen of the Royal Australian Regiment. The fighting in Korea provided the regiment with valuable combat experience, establishing a foundation for its further development and marking the emergence of the Australian Regular Army. The Korean War remains the only large-scale, conventional war that the regiment has fought. During this time the Army developed the capability to maintain two battalions on major operations at the same time.|$|E
