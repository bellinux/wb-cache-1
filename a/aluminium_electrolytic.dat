25|$|Comparing the permittivities of the {{different}} oxide materials it is seen that tantalum pentoxide has a permittivity approximately three times higher than aluminum oxide.

5000|$|An ESR meter {{does not}} measure the {{capacitance}} of a capacitor; the capacitor must be {{disconnected from the}} circuit and measured with a capacitance meter (or a multimeter with this capability). Excessive ESR is {{far more likely to}} be an identifiable problem with <b>aluminium</b> <b>electrolytics</b> rather than out-of-tolerance capacitance, which is rare in capacitors with acceptable ESR.|$|R
50|$|<b>Aluminium</b> and {{tantalum}} <b>electrolytic</b> capacitors with non {{solid electrolyte}} have much higher ESR values, {{up to several}} ohms, and ESR tends to increase with frequency due to effects of the electrolyte. A very serious problem, particularly with <b>aluminium</b> <b>electrolytics,</b> is that ESR increases over time with use; ESR can increase enough to cause circuit malfunction and even component damage, although measured capacitance may remain within tolerance. While this happens with normal aging, high temperatures and large ripple current exacerbate the problem. In a circuit with significant ripple current, an increase in ESR will increase heat dissipation, thus accelerating aging.|$|R
25|$|All etched or {{sintered}} anodes have a {{much higher}} surface compared to a smooth surface of the same area or the same volume. That increases the later capacitance value, depending on the rated voltage, {{by a factor of}} up to 200 for non-solid <b>aluminium</b> <b>electrolytic</b> capacitors as well as for solid tantalum electrolytic capacitors. The large surface compared to a smooth one is the second reason for the relatively high capacitance values of electrolytic capacitors compared with other capacitor families.|$|E

25|$|Industrial espionage was {{implicated in}} the {{capacitor}} plague, {{in connection with the}} theft of an electrolyte formula. A materials scientist working for Rubycon in Japan left the company, taking the secret water-based electrolyte formula for Rubycon's ZA and ZL series capacitors, and began working for a Chinese company. The scientist then developed a copy of this electrolyte. Then, some staff members who defected from the Chinese company copied an incomplete version of the formula and began to market it to many of the <b>aluminium</b> <b>electrolytic</b> manufacturers in Taiwan, undercutting the prices of the Japanese manufacturers. This incomplete electrolyte lacked important proprietary ingredients which were essential to the long-term stability of the capacitors and was unstable when packaged in a finished aluminum capacitor. This faulty electrolyte allowed the unimpeded formation of hydroxide and produced hydrogen gas.|$|E

500|$|The major use for tantalum, as {{the metal}} powder, {{is in the}} {{production}} of electronic components, mainly capacitors and some high-power resistors. Tantalum electrolytic capacitors exploit the tendency of tantalum to form a protective oxide surface layer, using tantalum powder, pressed into a pellet shape, as one [...] "plate" [...] of the capacitor, the oxide as the dielectric, and an electrolytic solution or conductive solid as the other [...] "plate". Because the dielectric layer can be very thin (thinner than the similar layer in, for instance, an <b>aluminium</b> <b>electrolytic</b> capacitor), a high capacitance can be achieved in a small volume. Because of the size and weight advantages, tantalum capacitors are attractive for portable telephones, personal computers, automotive electronics and Cameras.|$|E

50|$|Computers use {{large numbers}} of filter capacitors, making size an {{important}} factor. Solid tantalum and wet tantalum capacitors offer {{some of the best}} CV (capacitance/voltage) performance {{in some of the most}} volumetrically efficient packaging available. High currents and low voltages also make low equivalent series resistance (ESR) important. Solid tantalum capacitors offer low ESR versions that can often meet ESR requirements but they are not the lowest ESR option among all capacitors. Solid tantalums have an additional issue which must be addressed during the design stage. Solid tantalum capacitors must be voltage derated in all applications. A 50% voltage derating is recommended and generally accepted as the industry standard; e.g.: A 50V solid tantalum capacitor should never be exposed to an actual application voltage above 25V. Solid tantalum capacitors are very reliable components if the proper care is taken and all design guidelines are carefully followed. Unfortunately, the failure mechanism for a solid tantalum capacitor is a short which will result in a violent flaring up and smoking on a PCB capable of damaging other components in close proximity as well as completely destroying the capacitor. Fortunately, most solid tantalum capacitor failures will be immediate and very evident. Once in application solid tantalum capacitor performance will improve over time and the chances of a failure due to component mis-manufacturing decrease. Wet tantalums are a type of the electrolytic capacitor, using a tantalum pellet in an electrolytic material sealed in a hermetic package. This type of tantalum capacitor does not require the same derating that a solid tantalum does and its failure mechanism is open. A 10% to 20% voltage derating curve is recommended for wet tantalums when operating from 85C to 125C. Wet tantalums are not commonly referred to as just 'electrolytics' because usually 'electrolytic' refers to <b>aluminium</b> <b>electrolytics.</b>|$|R
