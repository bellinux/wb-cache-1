In 1994, we continued in that direction by proposing a class of articulated microrobots using hollow triangular beams (HTB's) as links, microhinges [4] as revolute joints, and linear electrostatic stepper motors for actuation [5].

40|$|Abstract. Probabilistic {{relational}} {{models are}} an {{efficient way to}} learn and represent the dynamics in realistic environments consisting of many objects. Autonomous intelligent agents that ground this representation for all objects need to plan in exponentially large state spaces and large sets of stochastic actions. A key insight for computational efficiency is that successful planning typically involves only a small subset of relevant objects. In this paper, we introduce a probabilistic model to represent planning with subsets of objects and provide a definition of object relevance. Our definition is sufficient to prove consistency between repeated planning in partially grounded models restricted to relevant objects and planning in the fully grounded model. We propose an algorithm that exploits object relevance to plan efficiently in complex domains. Empirical results in a simulated 3 D blocksworld with an <b>articulated</b> <b>manipulator</b> and realistic physics prove the effectiveness of our approach. ...|$|E

Given an object, a continuum manipulator tries to grasp it by wrapping around and squeezing it. A main open problem is how to determine if the object can be grasped and if so, the whole-arm wrapping around configurations of the robot to grasp it, which we call grasping configurations. In this paper, we provide a general and complete analysis of grasping configurations of a spatial continuum manipulator consisting of three constant-curvature sections, for any given 3 -D object. We formulate conditions for existence of solutions and describe how to determine valid grasping configurations. Our method can extend to general continuum manipulators of n constant-curvature sections (where n ≥ 3) ...|$|E

40|$|Joint {{torque control}} of a robotic {{manipulator}} requires a close dynamic description model involving the non negligible dynamics of the subsystems making up the system. The mathematical model for joint torque control of the robotic manipulator {{has been identified as}} one of the major sources of failures of commercial robots. The manipulator is basically made up of links connected by joints, and the torque that moves the links connected to a joint is produced by the joint actuator and also in practice, the control law is fed into the actuator inputs, therefore the actuator dynamics becomes non negligible dynamics in the dynamic modeling of the manipulator for robust joint torque control. Hence, a complete dynamic model of the manipulator which involves the link dynamics plus actuator dynamics was proposed. This paper focuses on the modeling of a 3 DOF <b>articulated</b> <b>manipulator</b> based on independent joint (decentralized) scheme and the determination of the viscous damping coefficient for the joint torque control model.
