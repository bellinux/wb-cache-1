5|$|The {{delegation}} traveled back to Wisconsin by rail, {{spreading the}} good news to the various Ojibwa bands <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>went.</b> Buffalo also announced that all the tribal representatives should gather at La Pointe for payments the next summer (1853), and he would reveal {{the specifics of the}} agreement.|$|E
5|$|Akhmatova {{wrote that}} by 1935 {{every time she}} went to see someone off {{at the train station}} <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> into exile, she'd find herself {{greeting}} friends at every step as so many of St Petersburg's intellectual and cultural figures would be leaving on the same train. In her poetry circles Mayakovsky and Esenin committed suicide and Marina Tsvetaeva would follow them in 1941, after returning from exile.|$|E
5|$|Manchester United and Arsenal took {{immediate}} action by fining {{a number of}} their players; Arsenal also punished their manager, George Graham. A month after the game, the FA fined both clubs £50,000 for bringing the game into disrepute. Arsenal were docked two points, one more than Manchester United as {{they were involved in}} a similar brawl against Norwich City in 1989. This did not impact on Arsenal's title challenge, however, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> on to become league champions with just one defeat.|$|E

5|$|Miller {{would finish}} the 2000–01 {{season with the}} Kings. In the final 13 games of the regular season, he had five assists, {{finishing}} with a career-best 14 assists and matching his career high of 18 points in one season. He contributed an assist in 13 playoff games as the Kings played the Avalanche, Miller's former team, who defeated Los Angeles <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> {{on to win the}} Stanley Cup for the second time.|$|E
5|$|Soon after, another German {{machine gun}} opened up, killing Private Styles and {{wounding}} Corporal Upchurch. With Private Beard, Statton began to crawl {{back to his}} own lines, while the inspired 37th Battalion continued its advance and cheered the pair <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> past. Later that evening, Statton, while under heavy machine gun fire, went out and retrieved the badly-wounded Upchurch and the body of Styles. By 20:00, both battalions had reached and consolidated their positions, and were relieved by the British 17th Division the following day.|$|E
5|$|Wapasha and the Sioux persisted {{for several}} hours in {{attempts}} to draw the Spanish defenders out. They {{went as far as}} brutally killing some captives they had taken in the fields. Although this angered some of the townspeople, Lebya refused to grant permission to the militia to make a sortie. The attackers eventually withdrew and headed north, destroying crops, livestock, and buildings <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>went.</b>|$|E

5|$|After this, the Allied forces {{advanced}} to the fortified naval outpost of Tobruk. The 6th Division attacked the perimeter defences early on 21 January, following a week of continuous bombardment from both land and sea. The 2/3rd Battalion was tasked with breaching the outer Italian defences for the 2/1st Battalion to pass through. Following the initial breakthrough, the 2/3rd then advanced west along the inner ring of defences, attacking a number of Italian posts <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>went.</b> Tobruk fell the next day, with the Italians surrendering to Brigadier Horace Robertson, {{the commander of the}} 19th Brigade. The Italian flag was taken down {{and in the absence of}} an Australian flag, a signaler from the 2/4th Battalion tied his slouch hat to the flag staff and hauled it up to the top. The battalion's losses during the fighting for Tobruk were seven officers and 50 men killed or wounded.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time as the aerial evacuation, tens of {{thousands}} of South Vietnamese fled towards TF-76 aboard junks, sampans, and small craft. MSC tugs pulled barges filled with people from Saigon Port out to TF-76. A flotilla of 26 Republic of Vietnam Navy and other vessels concentrated off Long Sơn Island southwest of Vung Tau with 30,000 sailors, their families, and other civilians on board. On the afternoon of 30 April, TF-76 moved away from the coast, picking up more refugees <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>went.</b> On 2 May, Task Force 76, carrying the Operation Frequent Wind evacuees and 44,000 seaborne evacuees and the RVN Navy group set sail for reception centers in the Philippines and Guam.|$|E
5|$|During {{the siege}} of Echinus by Philip V of Macedon in 211BC, the besiegers built {{underground}} tunnels to protect the soldiers and sappers <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> {{back and forth from}} the camp to the siege works. These included two siege towers connected by a makeshift wickerwork curtain wall mounted with stone-shooting ballistae, and sheds to protect the approach of the battering ram. Despite the early reputation of Macedon as a leader in siege technology, Alexandria in Ptolemaic Egypt became the center for technological improvements to the catapult by the 3rdcenturyBC, as evidenced by the writings of Philo of Alexandria.|$|E

5|$|Historically the King of the Welsh {{people would}} travel, with his court, in a circuit, {{demanding}} tribute {{in the form}} of food from communities they visited <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>went.</b> The tribute was codified in the Laws of Hywel Dda, showing that people lived on beer, bread, meat and dairy products, with few vegetables beyond cabbages and leeks. The laws show how much value was put on different parts of Welsh life at the time, for example that wealth was measured in cattle; they also show that the court included hunters, who would be restricted to seasonal hunting sessions.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 863, Umar struck again, joining forces with the Abbasid general Ja'far ibn Dinar al-Khayyat (probably the {{governor}} of Tarsus) for a successful raid into Cappadocia. The Arabs crossed the Cilician Gates into Byzantine territory, plundering <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>went,</b> until they reached a place near Tyana. There, the Tarsian army returned home, but Umar obtained Ja'far's leave to press on into Asia Minor. Umar's forces represented {{the bulk of his}} emirate's strength, but their size is unknown: the contemporary Muslim historian Ya'qubi claims that Umar had 8,000 men at his disposal, while the Byzantine historians Genesius and Theophanes Continuatus inflate the numbers of the Arab army to 40,000 men. The Byzantinist John Haldon considers the former number to be closer to reality, and estimates the size of the combined Arab force at 15,000–20,000 men. It is likely that a Paulician contingent under Karbeas was present as well.|$|E

5|$|On 14 March 1471, Edward's army {{landed at}} Ravenspurn. Gathering more men <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>went,</b> the Yorkists moved inland towards York. Edward's march was unopposed at the {{beginning}} because he was moving through lands {{that belonged to the}} Percys, and the Earl of Northumberland was indebted to the Yorkist king for the return of his northern territory. Furthermore, Edward announced that he was returning only to claim his father's title of Duke of York and not to contest the English crown. The ruse was successful: Montagu, who was monitoring Edward's march, could not convince his men to move against the Yorkist king.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the next two days, the {{battalion}} withdrew towards Athens, where they arrived in the early morning on 24 April. They continued on to the beach at Porto Rafti, destroying their vehicles and other equipment <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>went.</b> In the confusion of orders and counter orders, the battalion's carrier and mortar platoons had gotten separated from the rest of the unit. By 9:00pm on 24 April when the final move to the beach commenced they still had not arrived. The operation went according to plan however, and by 3:00am on 25 April the transports embarked. Of the various groups that had become detached from the battalion, some were able to make their own way to the embarkation beaches, but a number of them were ultimately captured. The battalion's casualties in Greece were 10 killed or died of wounds, six wounded, 83 captured, 11 wounded and captured.|$|E
5|$|Senator Joseph S. Clark's and Senator Robert F. Kennedy's {{tour of the}} Mississippi Delta {{occurred}} on April 10, 1967. At the behest of civil rights lawyer Marian Wright, Clark and Kennedy, together with two other Senators, traveled to Mississippi to investigate reports of extreme poverty and starvation. Following a field hearing, they drove from Greenville to Clarkesdale, stopping and touring impoverished communities <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>went.</b> Deeply disturbed by what they saw, the senators returned to Washington D.C. and began pushing {{for a series of}} reforms to alleviate the situation. Extensive media coverage of the event exposed the American public to real instances of malnutrition and starvation. The country was shocked and hunger became an important topic nationwide as people began looking for solutions. Efforts by the government and political action groups ultimately resulted in the problem being largely reduced by the 1970s.|$|E

5|$|Taking {{over control}} of the {{northern}} sector from the 7th Brigade, which was subsequently transferred to the southern sector {{to take part in the}} main offensive, the 11th Brigade advanced along the coast from Kuraio Mission, sending out patrols into the interior to flush the Japanese out of their positions in the mountains <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>went.</b> The 31st/51st Infantry Battalion, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Kelly and roughly 800-strong, formed the vanguard of the advance, its main body moving along the coast road towards Amun, Sipaai and Rukussia, while patrols were sent inland from Totokei towards Lalum and Soraken, both of which were considered key Japanese positions. By 16 January 1945, the lead company of the 31st/51st reached Rukussia, having encountered no Japanese up until that point.|$|E
