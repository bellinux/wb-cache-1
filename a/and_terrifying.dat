25|$|Since Brook's production, {{directors}} {{have used their}} imaginations freely in staging the play. In particular, {{there has been an}} increased use of sexuality on stage, as many directors see the palace as a symbol of restraint and repression, while the wood is a symbol of unrestrained sexuality, both liberating <b>and</b> <b>terrifying.</b>|$|E
25|$|Actor Bryan Cranston praised Edwards' vision, tone, {{and pitch}} {{for the film}} and titular character. In an {{interview}} with Canada's Entertainment Tonight, he compared Edwards' approach similar to Steven Spielberg's style in Jaws where the film does not immediately show the beast but rather build up to its appearance while still delivering an eerie <b>and</b> <b>terrifying</b> off-screen presence.|$|E
25|$|Disgusting <b>and</b> <b>terrifying</b> {{parasitic}} {{alien species}} are widespread in science fiction, as {{for instance in}} Ridley Scott's 1979 film Alien. In one scene of that film, an alien bursts out of the chest of a dead man, with blood squirting out under high pressure assisted by explosive squibs. Animal viscera were used to reinforce the shock effect. The scene was filmed in a single take, and the startled reaction of the actors was genuine.|$|E

25|$|His {{depiction}} of suburban late Victorian {{culture in the}} novel was an accurate reflection of his own experiences {{at the time of}} writing. In the late 19th Century the British Empire was the predominant colonial and naval power on the globe, making its domestic heart a poignant <b>and</b> <b>terrifying</b> starting point for an invasion by Martians with their own imperialist agenda. He also drew upon a common fear which had emerged in the years approaching the turn of the century, known at the time as fin de siècle or 'end of the age', which anticipated apocalypse at midnight {{on the last day of}} 1899.|$|E
25|$|Yet in his research, McDonough {{also notes}} that Meyer's female {{characters}} were limited in how powerful they could appear; often the female lead is raped (Up! and Lorna) or brutally murdered (Beyond the Valley of the Dolls, Supervixens, Lorna and Blacksnake). While Russ Meyer may have championed powerful woman characters, he also forced them into violent <b>and</b> <b>terrifying</b> situations, making them prove their physical and mental strength against tremendous odds. He also ensured that women's breasts were at least semi-exposed during these ordeals for comic or erotic effect. Furthermore, according to frequent collaborator and longtime lover Kitten Natividad, Meyer's love of dominant women extended to his personal life, and he was almost always in a tumultuous relationship.|$|E
25|$|Harris {{was soon}} moving again, sailing to Portugal to {{participate}} in the opening actions of the British involvement in the Peninsular War. Harris was at the very first action, a skirmish at the town of Óbidos, where he saw Lieutenant Ralph Bunbury fall, the first British casualty of the war. On 17 August 1808 he was in the hotly contested skirmish line at Battle of Rolica, and saw serious opposition for the first time, reporting it as an exhilarating <b>and</b> <b>terrifying</b> experience. Many of his companions were killed at this action and the ensuing Battle of Vimeiro, but Harris remained unhurt, continuing the march to Salamanca before becoming trapped in northern Spain with the rest of Sir John Moore's army. The Light Brigade of Robert Craufurd, which included the 2nd/95th, did not march {{with the rest of the}} army to Corunna but marched to Vigo. The sights and horrors of the march remained with him for decades to come, and he was lucky to escape, claiming to be the very last man collected from the beaches at Vigo, and embarking for England in a severely weakened state.|$|E

[...] "Thinking about going {{back on the road}} is both thrilling <b>and</b> <b>terrifying</b> in equal measure," [...] Manson stated, [...] "...but we've always enjoyed a little pain mixed in with our pleasure." [...] Manson considered that self-reflection helped change the way the group approached touring, and, as a result, [...] "we're playing the best shows of our career." [...] Eric Avery, who performed with the band during their Bleed Like Me tour, rejoined them as the tour bassist. The band played concerts throughout North and South America, Europe, Oceania and Asia.|$|E
500|$|Yorke {{said that}} the {{starting}} point for the record was the [...] "incredibly dense <b>and</b> <b>terrifying</b> sound" [...] of Bitches Brew, the 1970 avant-garde jazz fusion album by Miles Davis. He described the sound of Bitches Brew to Q: [...] "It was building something up and watching it fall apart, that's the beauty of it. It was at the core of {{what we were trying to}} do with OK Computer." [...] Yorke identified [...] "I'll Wear It Proudly" [...] by Elvis Costello, [...] "Fall on Me" [...] by R.E.M., [...] "Dress" [...] by PJ Harvey and [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] by the Beatles as particularly influential on the album's songwriting. Radiohead drew further inspiration from the recording style of film soundtrack composer Ennio Morricone and the krautrock band Can, musicians Yorke described as [...] "abusing the recording process".|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} met with {{generally}} mixed reviews from television critics. Dan Martin of The Guardian thought that [...] "The Curse of the Black Spot" [...] was [...] "a little bit anticlimactic" [...] {{in comparison to the}} opening two-part episode of the series, though it was [...] "a nice old-fashioned runaround bolstered by some high concepts and cute moments", much like the classic episodes. He praised Lily Cole as the Siren but criticised the character of Avery. Martin later rated it the worst episode of the first twelve of the series (the finale, which had not aired at the time, {{was not included in the}} list). IGN's Matt Risley gave it an overall [...] "good" [...] score of 7 out of 10, admitting that there were [...] "some great lines" [...] and the [...] "Space Pirate" [...] twist was [...] "a refreshingly sci-fi spin on the well-worn genre plot", but he criticised the Siren for lacking qualities to become [...] "a credible <b>and</b> <b>terrifying</b> Who villain".|$|E
500|$|Erik Kain of Forbes {{enjoyed the}} game for its anxiety-inducing horror, and wrote that it succeeded as {{marketing}} for the upcoming Silent Hills. David Houghton of GamesRadar praised it for its immersive, well-executed horror and for how the game's difficulty created online discourse: [...] "By spreading out into the real world, by forcing solutions by way of hearsay, internet whispers, and desperate, rumoured logic, it has become its own urban myth." [...] Eurogamers Jeffrey Matulef wrote that, through its emphasis on [...] "sound effects, visual design, choreography, and difficult to decipher enemy placements" [...] over traditional progress, the game became immersive <b>and</b> <b>terrifying.</b> However, the puzzles in P.T. received criticism. Klepek panned the puzzles, describing them as an [...] "exercise in frustration". Matthew Reynolds of Digital Spy wrote that the final puzzle was a [...] "source of frustration" [...] which lacked a clear solution. In contrast, Matulaf stated that, while the puzzles ranged in cleverness and difficulty, they added to {{the horror of the}} game by being emotionally [...] "uncomfortable".|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} {{reviews of}} the album, published by the LA Weekly and Newsweek, were positive. Rolling Stone critic Christian Hoard wrote that [...] "Octagon's verses often feel unfocused and random, but when he bears down he can be mesmerizing, channeling his quick-tongued rhymes with streetwise brassiness and cosmic vibrations." [...] Allmusic reviewer Marisa Brown wrote that the album [...] "doesn't always {{make a lot of}} sense, but that's the beauty of it. It's a kind of concept album that concentrates more on the actual overall sound than the concepts. Its elements are all on the very edge of control, which is both exhilarating <b>and</b> <b>terrifying</b> at the same time; if it works, it could bring us to where we've never been, protect us from what may be, but if it fails, it could kill us all." [...] Hip Hop DX reviewer B. Love wrote, [...] "This is Kool Keith's best album in years—arguably even better than his classic Octagonecologyst—and marks a fine return to form for one of rap music's most distinctive and original talents." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{romantic and}} emotionally charged {{aspects of the}} film were equally praised. Andrew L. Urban of Urban Cinefile said, [...] "You will walk out of Titanic not talking about budget or running time, but of its {{enormous}} emotive power, big as the engines of the ship itself, determined as its giant propellers to gouge into your heart, and as lasting as the love story that propels it." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly described the film as, [...] "A lush <b>and</b> <b>terrifying</b> spectacle of romantic doom. Writer-director James Cameron has restaged the defining catastrophe of the early 20th century on a human scale of such purified yearning and dread that he touches the deepest levels of popular moviemaking." [...] Janet Maslin of The New York Times commented that [...] "Cameron's magnificent Titanic is the first spectacle in decades that honestly invites comparison to Gone With the Wind." [...] Richard Corliss of Time magazine, on the other hand, wrote a mostly negative review, criticizing the lack of interesting emotional elements.|$|E
500|$|Writer John Ajvide Lindqvist, on {{the other}} hand, says that Reeves {{told him that he}} [...] "will make a new film based on the book, and not remake the Swedish film" [...] and so [...] "it'll be {{something}} completely different, but it's going to be really interesting to see." [...] Reeves expressed his intent to retain the book's early 1980s setting and his admiration for the book and Alfredson's adaptation. [...] "It's a terrific movie and a fantastic book. I think it could be a really touching, haunting <b>and</b> <b>terrifying</b> film. I'm really excited about what it could be", he said. In response to the criticism he said, [...] "I can understand because of people's love of the [...] film that there's this cynicism that I'll come in and trash it, when in fact I have nothing but respect for the film. I'm so drawn to it for personal and not mercenary reasons ... I hope people give us a chance." [...] When Reeves was initially approached, he at first was against the idea but after reading the novel gained a better appreciation for the story, ...|$|E
500|$|Ideas {{alluding}} to romance are prevalent throughout the episode. The development between Shane Walsh and Lori Grimes continues in [...] "TS-19", which showcases a flashback featuring Shane being conflicted {{with the decision}} to leave an unconscious Rick Grimes in the hospital—who Shane initially presumes to be dead. Kirkman asserted that the sequence added dimension to the storyline, and concluded that by {{the ending of the}} episode, the audience will no longer identify Shane as an antagonist. [...] "Up until the sixth episode, you get the sense that Shane actually is a bad guy, that he lied to Lori and made her believe that he was dead in order to facilitate him moving in on her," [...] said Kirkman. [...] "The flashback does a great job of telling you that that's not true: He tried to save Rick, he wanted to save Rick. He was kind of up against the wall there and actually did believe that Rick was dead." [...] Lincoln said of the flashback: [...] "You realize Shane's loyalty as a friend and as a man—and also his weaknesses. He still can't make a decision without his partner, and you realize he's flawed—everybody is under incredible duress, you see the state of the world is so extreme <b>and</b> <b>terrifying</b> that people are making split-second decisions under great duress. Is Shane barricading Rick in, or is he trying to prevent him being taken by the walkers? There are many different ways to construe what Shane has done and that's the beauty of the show is that there's no clear and definite answers, you make your own mind." [...] Other themes prominent in the episode include suicide and terror.|$|E

500|$|For Kilgrave, Maslansky used many suits {{created by}} {{designer}} Paul Smith, rather than custom-making {{them as she}} originally planned, as Smith [...] "was [...] about purple" [...] in the previous fashion season. On the suits, Maslansky added that the designers [...] "wanted {{to find a place}} where we could utilize clothing in shades of purple, but not go so over the top that it would look silly and that he would stop feeling ominous or menacing." [...] Expanding on this, Maslansky called purple a traditionally [...] "fairly friendly color, and he’s anything but friendly. So I had to find ways to make him be ominous and frightening <b>and</b> <b>terrifying.</b> I found that I needed the right proportion of shades of purple to other shades that were similar: navy, black, maroon." [...] Maslansky felt Luke Cage was also someone [...] "who wears his clothing like an armor," [...] with his wardrobe consisting of T-shirts, jeans, leather jackets or an army jacket. For a character like Trish Walker, who does not {{have the same kind of}} [...] "statement costume" [...] as Jones, Maslansky tried to create a certain character style. Maslansky said that Walker's uniform is fashion, so [...] "even when she was hanging around the house, she was wearing a pair of rag & bone jeans with a Chloé top, and this was her version of a T-shirt and jeans." [...] Maslansky added that Robin was [...] "a blast to dress" [...] because of her [...] "quirky" [...] personality, yet she was still able to [...] "put herself together aesthetically." [...] For Malcolm, as his story progressively became brighter throughout the season, so did his wardrobe, becoming [...] "a little brighter and a little more hopeful." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviews for the Saturn and PlayStation ports {{were mostly}} {{positive}} although some were mixed. Sam Hickman from the Sega Saturn Magazine {{commented that the}} game manages to be extremely creepy <b>and</b> <b>terrifying</b> despite having almost no bloodshed. He predicted that the game would be outclassed by Resident Evil (still in development {{at the time of}} the review), but concluded that D was the best horror game presently on the market. Four reviewers at Electronic Gaming Monthly commented that the Saturn version had reduced the load times seen in the 3DO version to almost nothing. They highly praised the storyline and intelligently designed puzzles, and described it as [...] "scary enough to make you an insomniac." [...] GamePro staff gave positive reviews for both the Saturn and PlayStation versions, recommending it to those looking for a horror experience. Maximum staff likewise gave positive reviews to both versions, saying that D is similar to Myst (1993) and Mansion of Hidden Souls (1993) but ultimately better due to its more enticing story. They also praised the FMV graphics and cinematic presentation, but criticized it for its lack of longevity. The reviewers felt its short length, addictive gameplay, and lack of overly challenging puzzles ensured that the player will be finished with it very quickly. A Next Generation reviewer gave the same praises for the scary storyline and graphics, and also said the puzzles [...] "are just challenging enough to satisfy and yet not so difficult as to impede your progress for very long." [...] However, he felt the slow character movement and lack of longevity kept the game from being truly exceptional. Staff at Game Informer were more critical in their review of the Saturn version. They found the gameplay tedious but did praise the graphics and the storytelling, concluding the [...] "story would make a great movie or book, but not a game." ...|$|E
