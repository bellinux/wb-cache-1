5|$|The deputy sheriff's {{position}} was {{worth more than}} US$40,000 a year (about $ today) because he was also county assessor and tax collector, {{and the board of}} supervisors allowed him to keep 10% of the <b>amounts</b> <b>paid.</b> While Wyatt was deputy sheriff, former Democrat state legislator Johnny Behan arrived in September 1880.|$|E
5|$|Hemming singles out the conquests of England by Cnut and William the Conqueror {{as being}} {{especially}} damaging. He {{claims that the}} work only covers the lost estates that were assigned to support the cathedral chapter, but as he describes the loss of several manors that were listed in Domesday Book as belonging to the bishop, the work probably covers more than the author claims. It also contains a listing of <b>amounts</b> <b>paid</b> to King William to regain items the king had taken from the diocese. Worcester paid over 45.5 marks of gold to recover their belongings. Others singled out in the work as significant plunderers of Worcester's lands included Leofric, Earl of Mercia, {{and other members of}} his family.|$|E
5|$|Paul finally became sheriff in April 1881, {{but it was}} {{too late}} to reappoint Wyatt Earp as deputy sheriff because on January 1, 1881, the eastern portion of Pima County {{containing}} Tombstone had been split off into the new Cochise County, which would need its own sheriff, based in the county's largest city, Tombstone. This position was filled by a political appointment from the governor, and Wyatt and Behan both wanted the job. The Cochise County sheriff's position was worth more than $40,000 a year (about $ today) because the office holder was also county assessor and tax collector, and the board of supervisors allowed him to keep ten percent of the <b>amounts</b> <b>paid.</b>|$|E

A few hours later, the record <b>amount</b> <b>paid</b> by a British club was broken again when Chelsea paid £50,000,000 for Fernando Torres from Liverpool.|$|R
5000|$|In {{personal}} finance, {{a finance}} charge {{may be considered}} simply the dollar <b>amount</b> <b>paid</b> to borrow money, while interest is a percentage <b>amount</b> <b>paid</b> such as annual percentage rate (APR).

25|$|In {{addition}} to {{concerns about the}} inclusion of non-AQ (Automatic Qualifying) conference teams in the five BCS bowls, some critics have noted the disparities between the <b>amounts</b> <b>paid</b> to the six AQ conferences and their respective schools, as opposed to other conferences and their own schools.|$|E
25|$|When Cochise County was {{initially}} formed, both Wyatt Earp and Johnny Behan sought the new sheriff's position. It was a lucrative job, far beyond its salary. The sheriff {{was not only}} responsible for enforcing the law but was also county assessor, tax collector, and responsible for collecting prostitution, gambling, liquor, and theater fees. The county supervisors allowed the sheriff to keep ten percent of all <b>amounts</b> <b>paid.</b> This made the job worth more than $40,000 a year (about $ today).|$|E
25|$|Remuneration for the Chief Executive of Hong Kong {{is among}} the highest in the world for a {{political}} leader, and second only to that of the Prime Minister of Singapore. The pay level took a cue from the handsome <b>amounts</b> <b>paid</b> to the city's colonial governors – worth $273,000 per annum plus perks in 1992 – and is 25 times more than that of Xi Jinping, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China. In 2005, then-CE CH Tung received some HK$3million ($378,500). From 2009 until the end of 2014, the salary for the job stood at HK$4.22million. In January 2015, CY Leung reversed a pay freeze imposed in 2012, resulting in its increase to HK$4.61million ($591,000).|$|E

25|$|<b>Amounts</b> <b>paid</b> {{to program}} {{beneficiaries}} rose from $28.6 billion in 2005 to $76.1 billion in 2013, falling back to $66.6 billion by 2016. This increase {{was due to}} the high unemployment rate (leading to higher SNAP participation) and the increased benefit per person with the passing of ARRA. SNAP average monthly benefits increased from $96.18 per person to $133.08 per person. Other program costs, which include the Federal share of State administrative expenses, Nutrition Education, and Employment and Training, amounted to roughly $3.7 million in 2013. There were cuts into the program's budget introduced in 2014 that were estimated to save $8.6 billion over 10 years. Some of the states are looking for measures within the states to balance the cuts, so they would not affect the recipients of the federal aid program.|$|E
25|$|Lenders {{argue that}} the real estate attorney's fee, for example, is a {{pass-through}} cost, not a cost of the lending. In effect, they are arguing that the attorney's fee is a separate transaction and {{not a part of}} the loan. Consumer advocates argue that this would be true if the customer is free to select which attorney is used. If the lender insists, however, on using a specific attorney, the cost should be looked at as a component of the total cost of doing business with that lender. This area is made more complicated by the practice of contingency fees – for example, when the lender receives money from the attorney and other agents to be the one used by the lender. Because of this, U.S. regulators require all lenders to produce an affiliated business disclosure form which shows the <b>amounts</b> <b>paid</b> between the lender and the appraisal firms, attorneys, etc.|$|E

He wrote a regular column for Sydney's The Daily Telegraph, prosaically titled [...] "Like It or Lump It", {{in which he}} often criticised {{the administration of the}} game and the <b>amounts</b> <b>paid</b> to Australia's leading cricketers. Barnes was {{one of a number of}} cricket writers of the immediate post-war era who adopted a confrontational tabloid style of journalism, in contrast to the more sedate reporting of the 1930s.|$|E

500|$|At a {{press conference}} in Tokyo on 27 October, {{president}} Takayama blamed Woodford for the decline in the company's share price, saying [...] "If this secret information had not been leaked, {{there would have been no}} change in our corporate value." [...] Takayama said the <b>amounts</b> <b>paid</b> for Gyrus [...] "will pay off considering what value we will gain from the Gyrus acquisition in the future." [...] He further justified the purchase of the three small Japanese companies as part of a strategy [...] "to find new growth areas to reduce our over-reliance on the endoscope business." [...] However, Mori, who was the main speaker, and Takayama were criticised by impatient journalists for their responses that meandered without addressing the issues.|$|E
500|$|In 1975, Congress {{passed the}} Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (IDEAA). [...] IDEAA {{authorized}} the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Health and Human Services to contract with Native American tribes {{to take over}} services that had, in the past, been provided by the BIA and the Indian Health Service (IHS), among others. [...] The stated intent of IDEAA was to improve tribal self-determination in planning and managing federally funded programs for tribal members. [...] The Secretary of the Interior was responsible for administering these contracts out of monies appropriated by Congress. [...] The contracts required two parts, first the direct cost of the program being administered by the tribe, and second, indirect costs of administering the program, subject to funds being appropriated by Congress. [...] When there were shortfalls in the <b>amounts</b> <b>paid</b> by BIA to the tribe, the agency would underpay the tribe for indirect costs, forcing the tribes to cut services to tribal members to pay the indirect costs.|$|E
