5|$|Kneale's {{remaining}} television {{work was}} written for ITV. His first script for ITV was the one-off play Murrain, made by the network's Midlands franchise holders Associated TeleVision (ATV) in 1975. The play, a horror piece based around witchcraft, led the following year to a series called Beasts, a six-part anthology where Kneale created six different character-based tales of horror and the macabre. It featured some well-known actors such <b>as</b> <b>Martin</b> Shaw, Pauline Quirke and Bernard Horsfall, but did not gain a full network run on ITV; different regions transmitted the episodes in different timeslots and some in different sequences.|$|E
5|$|Some {{authors have}} dealt with {{comparative}} studies between Taoism and Christianity. This has been of interest for students of history of religion such as J.J.M. de Groot, among others. The comparison of the teachings of Laozi and Jesus of Nazareth {{has been done by}} several authors such <b>as</b> <b>Martin</b> Aronson, and Toropov & Hansen (2002), who believe that they have parallels that should not be ignored. In the opinion of J. Isamu Yamamoto the main difference is that Christianity preaches a personal God while Taoism does not. Yet, a number of authors, including Lin Yutang, have argued that some moral and ethical tenets of these religions are similar.|$|E

5|$|There was {{a similar}} {{opposition}} during the 1799 election of {{delegates to the}} Buenos Aires Cabildo: Castelli was elected as third Regidor, but was rejected by merchants associated with the port of Cádiz.

Castelli, however, rejected the post because of his high workload in the Consulate. This {{was seen as an}} insult by peninsular merchants such <b>as</b> <b>Martín</b> de Álzaga, who was influential in the Cabildo.|$|E
