5|$|Jackson was speculated as a {{potential}} candidate for the U.S. Senate in 2004, but declined to run and instead became one of Barack Obama's early supporters. He endorsed Howard Dean for the 2004 Democratic presidential nomination, joining <b>Al</b> <b>Gore</b> <b>in</b> saying Dean was the most likely candidate in the primary to beat Bush. The endorsement was a bitter blow to the hopes of candidate Al Sharpton, who had hoped for endorsements from both Jackson and his father.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Mark Kirkland {{and a lot of}} new designs and backgrounds had to be created for the wilderness scenes. The backgrounds were designed by animator Debbie Silver. The design of the forest ranger was based on then-Vice President <b>Al</b> <b>Gore.</b> <b>In</b> the episode, Marge watches an old film which includes a comment from naturalist John Muir. The impression of Muir was done by Dan Castellaneta, who originally based the voice on an impersonator he met at Yosemite National Park. However, the producers asked him to make the voice older and crazier.|$|E
5|$|After the 1948 election, {{the state}} turned firmly Republican. Although {{registered}} Republicans were {{a minority in}} the state until 2015, starting in 1952, Oklahoma has been carried by Republican presidential candidates {{in all but one}} election (1964). This is not to say every election has been a landslide for Republicans: Jimmy Carter lost the state by less than 1.5% in 1976, while Michael Dukakis and Bill Clinton both won 40% or more of the state's popular vote in 1988 and 1996 respectively. <b>Al</b> <b>Gore</b> <b>in</b> 2000, though, was the last Democrat to even win any counties in the state. Oklahoma was one of three states, the others being Utah and West Virginia, where Barack Obama failed to carry any of its counties in 2012, and it was the only state where Barack Obama failed to carry any county in 2008. In 2016, Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, again won every county, being one of only two states, the other being West Virginia, where Democrat Hillary Clinton failed to carry a single county.|$|E

25|$|Like {{neighboring}} Suffolk County, Nassau County residents primarily {{supported the}} Republican Party in national elections until the 1990s. That decade, {{it began to}} shift toward the Democratic Party. Democrat Bill Clinton carried the county in the presidential elections of 1992 and 1996. Later Nassau voters gave a large margin of victory to <b>Al</b> <b>Gore</b> <b>in</b> 2000 (19.4%), but John Kerry's winning margin in 2004 was considerably slimmer (5.6%). In that election, Kerry won the towns of Hempstead and North Hempstead, but lost the Town of Oyster Bay.|$|E
25|$|The South's {{transition}} to a Republican stronghold took decades and manifested an incremental seepage downward from national to state to local levels. First the states started voting Republican in presidential elections—the Democrats countered that by nominating Southerners who could carry some states in the region, such as Jimmy Carter in 1976 and Bill Clinton in 1992 and 1996. However, the strategy narrowly failed with <b>Al</b> <b>Gore</b> <b>in</b> 2000. Then the states began electing Republican senators to fill open seats caused by retirements and finally governors and state legislatures changed sides.|$|E
25|$|Maine {{has voted}} for Democratic Bill Clinton twice, <b>Al</b> <b>Gore</b> <b>in</b> 2000, John Kerry in 2004, and Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. In the 2016 {{election}} Donald J. Trump won one of Maine's electoral votes with Hillary Clinton winning the other three. Although Democrats have mostly carried {{the state in}} presidential elections in recent years, Republicans have largely maintained their control of the state's U.S. Senate seats, with Edmund Muskie, William Hathaway and George J.

In the 113th Congress the House delegations from all six states of New England were all Democratic.

25|$|The Democratic Party holds a {{plurality}} of registrations in Delaware. Until the 2000 presidential election, the state tended to be a Presidential bellwether, sending its three electoral votes to the winning candidate since 1952. This trend ended in 2000 when Delaware's electoral votes went to <b>Al</b> <b>Gore.</b> <b>In</b> 2004 John Kerry won Delaware by eight percentage points. In 2008 Democrat Barack Obama defeated Republican John McCain in Delaware 62.63% to 37.37%. Obama's running mate was Joe Biden, who had represented Delaware in the United States Senate since 1973. Obama carried Delaware again in 2012. In 2016, Delaware's electoral votes went to Hillary Clinton.|$|E
