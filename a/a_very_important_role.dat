Some task categories are stone-working, woodworking, metalworking, farming, and crafting; there are further combat-related skills.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Rapidity gap, {{defined as}} the absence of {{particles}} in a rapidity or pseudorapidity region, is a signature of the exchange of a color-singlet. In the soft diffractive and elastic interactions, the so-called "pomeron" with quantum numbers of the vacuum, is exchanged, and leaves a rapidity gap in the final state. "Hard diffraction" {{is characterized by the}} presence of rapidity gaps due to pomeron exchange, associated with a hard process in the pomeron-(anti-) proton interactions (such as the production of jets, W boson, etc). Another issue of interest is the exchange of a strongly interacting color-singlet. This process has been observed in dijet events with a central rapidity gap between jets at the Tevatron and the HERA. 2 DETECTOR APPARATUS The calorimetry, one of the relevant detectors to this physics, plays <b>an</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>role</b> in all analyses of rapidity gap physics.

40|$|The {{projective}} construction (the slave-particle approach) {{has played}} <b>an</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>role</b> in understanding strongly correlated systems, {{such as the}} emergence of fermions, anyons, and gauge theory in quantum spin liquids and quantum Hall states. Recently, fermionic Projected Entangled Pair States (fPEPS) have been introduced to effciently represent many-body fermionic states. In this paper, we show that the strongly correlated bosonic/fermionic states obtained both from the projective construction and the fPEPS approach can be represented systematically as Grassmann tensor product states. This construction can also be applied to all other tensor network states approaches. The Grassmann tensor product states allow us to encode many-body bosonic/fermionic states effciently with a polynomial number of parameters. We also generalize the tensor-entanglement renormalization group (TERG) method for complex tensor networks to Grassmann tensor networks. This allows us to approximate the norm and average local operators of Grassmann tensor product states in polynomial time, and hence leads to a variational approach for describing strongly correlated bosonic/fermionic systems in higher dimensions.
