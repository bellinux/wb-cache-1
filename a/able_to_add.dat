The Sooners' QB Paul Thompson went 11 for 19 with two touchdowns and no interceptions. He also ran for 28yards and a score while Allen Patrick added 162yards on 36carries.

The first Corona spy satellite mission in August 1960 put limits on their program {{that appeared to be}} well below the lower bound of any of the estimates, and a follow-up mission in late 1961 clearly demonstrated the US had a massive strategic lead.

5|$|Four columns {{were built}} through the {{existing}} Main Stand {{to support the}} Club Deck, which resulted in approximately 1,000 seats having a restricted view. After opening the Club Deck, Ibrox had a capacity of 44,500. When a new playing surface was installed in 1992, Rangers were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>add</b> a further 1,300 seats {{to the front of}} three stands by lowering the pitch slightly. The only standing area of the ground, the enclosure of the Main Stand, was seated in 1994 to comply with the Taylor Report and UEFA regulations. The multi-coloured seats were replaced in 1995 with uniform blue seats. A further 1,200 seats was added in this process by reconfiguring passageways, giving a total capacity of 47,998.|$|E
5|$|Nobuo Uematsu was {{the chief}} music {{composer}} of the Final Fantasy series until his resignation from Square Enix in November 2004. Other composers include Masashi Hamauzu, Hitoshi Sakimoto and Junya Nakano. Uematsu was allowed to create much of the music with little direction from the production staff. Sakaguchi, however, would request pieces to fit specific game scenes including battles and exploring {{different areas of the}} game world. Once a game's major scenarios were completed, Uematsu would begin writing the music based on the story, characters, and accompanying artwork. He started with a game's main theme, and developed other pieces to match its style. In creating character themes, Uematsu read the game's scenario to determine the characters' personality. He would also ask the scenario writer for more details to scenes he was unsure about. Technical limitations were prevalent in earlier titles; Sakaguchi would sometimes instruct Uematsu to only use specific notes. It was not until Final FantasyIV on the SNES that Uematsu was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>add</b> more subtlety to the music.|$|E

Tech's offense replied with a field goal, but Louisville was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>add</b> another touchdown {{before the end of the}} quarter, extending its lead to 14–3. In the second quarter, Virginia Tech fought back and narrowed Louisville's lead to a single touchdown. At halftime, the score was 17–10 in Louisville's favor. In the second half, Virginia Tech's offense began to have success. Tech earned the only points of the third quarter—a 28-yard field goal from kicker Brandon Pace—to narrow Louisville's lead to 17–13. In the fourth quarter, the game fully turned in the Hokies' favor. Though Louisville scored a touchdown early in the quarter, Virginia Tech scored 22unanswered points in the final 13minutes of the game to take a 35–24 lead and earn the win.|$|E
5|$|When White {{retired in}} December 1999, he gave back the Michelin stars, but under Robert Reid, The Restaurant won a single star {{again in the}} 2001 and 2002 editions of the guide before closing later that year. During the course of The Restaurant's two locations, White sought to develop the {{techniques}} used in the dishes and expand the range of food on offer. The space used at Harveys was inadequate for his plans, but with the Hyde Park Hotel location he was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>add</b> elements which were braised or made confit. At the Oak Room, both chickens and lamb were cooked each day just for pressed juices with which to make sauces for other dishes. The Restaurant was critically acclaimed, with critics such as Michael Winner, A. A. Gill and Jonathan Meades praising the food served. As did Egon Ronay, who gave the restaurant a maximum three stars in his restaurant guide.|$|E
5|$|That praises {{are without}} reason lavished on the dead, {{and that the}} honours due only to {{excellence}} are paid to antiquity, is a complaint likely to be always continued by those, who, being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>add</b> nothing to truth, hope for eminence from the heresies of paradox; or those, who, being forced by disappointment upon consolatory expedients, are willing to hope from posterity what the present age refuses, and flatter themselves that the regard which is yet denied by envy, will be at last bestowed by time. Antiquity, like every other quality that attracts the notice of mankind, has undoubtedly votaries that reverence it, not from reason, but from prejudice. Some seem to admire indiscriminately whatever has been long preserved, without considering that time has sometimes co-operated with chance; all perhaps {{are more willing to}} honour past than present excellence; and the mind contemplates genius through the shades of age, as the eye surveys the sun through artificial opacity. The great contention of criticism is to find the faults of the moderns, and the beauties of the ancients. While an authour is yet living we estimate his powers by his worst performance, and when he is dead we rate them by his best.|$|E
