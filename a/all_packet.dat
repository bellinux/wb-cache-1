50|$|If {{a network}} does not {{guarantee}} packet delivery, then it becomes the host's responsibility to provide reliability by detecting and retransmitting lost packets. Subsequent experience on the ARPANET indicated that the network itself could not reliably detect <b>all</b> <b>packet</b> delivery failures, and this pushed responsibility for error detection onto the sending host in any case. This {{led to the development}} of the end-to-end principle, which is one of the Internet's fundamental design assumptions.|$|E
50|$|Fair queuing is {{a family}} of {{scheduling}} algorithms used in some process and network schedulers. The concept implies a separate data packet queue (or job queue) for each traffic flow (or for each program process) {{as opposed to the}} traditional approach with one FIFO queue for <b>all</b> <b>packet</b> flows (or for all process jobs). The purpose is to achieve fairness when a limited resource is shared, for example to avoid that flows with large packets (or processes that generate small jobs) achieve more throughput (or CPU time) than other flows (or processes).|$|E

50|$|In 2007, Robert Watson and Christian Peron added zero-copy buffer {{extensions}} to the BPF {{implementation in}} the FreeBSD operating system, allowing kernel packet capture in the device driver interrupt handler to write directly to user process memory {{in order to}} avoid the requirement for two copies for <b>all</b> <b>packet</b> data received via the BPF device. While one copy remains in the receipt path for user processes, this preserves the independence of different BPF device consumers, as well as allowing the packing of headers into the BPF buffer rather than copying complete packet data.|$|E
50|$|Simultaneous to {{the brand}} launch, Xchange Magazine {{reported}} that Aviat was focusing in on aiding the carrier transition from legacy to all-IP and LTE networks, and helping operators reach rural and underserved areas with wireless broadband. In support of these claims, Aviat announced {{a few weeks}} later at Mobile World Congress that it was adding cell site gateway functionality (normally provided by an external device) to the Eclipse Packet Node platform, making possible seamless TDM to IP backhaul migration. They explained that the gateway features were made possible by a plug-and-play Network Convergence Module (NCM), designed to fit in the Eclipse nodal indoor unit, giving wireless operators the choice to support legacy TDM traffic over an <b>all</b> <b>packet</b> backhaul network as an alternative to transporting TDM natively using a hybrid configuration.|$|E
5000|$|... 10Gbit Ethernet has {{a strict}} charter {{requiring}} a Mean Time to False Packet Acceptance (MTTFPA) {{to be on}} the order of 1 billion years for a single operating link. To achieve this at normal bit error rates requires at least a four bit hamming distance protection for <b>all</b> <b>packet</b> data. In other words, all combinations of four randomly spaced bit-flips within a packet boundary must be detected and result in an invalidated packet. Several strategies were combined to achieve the 4-bit hamming distance for 64b/66b packets: 1) strong type fields were chosen with 4-bit hamming distance, 2) the scrambler polynomial was chosen to be compatible with the CRC-32 used for packet protection and 3) protocol violations adjacent to the packet boundaries are required to invalidate the packet. The combination of CRC-32 and the chosen scrambler polynomial were evaluated by exhaustively enumerating all 4-bit error patterns for all possible packet sizes with an optimized C program.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} packet {{networks and}} {{make use of}} the “adversarial queuing theory ” model [10]. We are interested in the question of guaranteeing that <b>all</b> <b>packets</b> are actually delivered to destination, and of having an upper bound on the delivery times of <b>all</b> <b>packets.</b> Whether this is possible against all adversarial queuing theory rate- 1 adversaries was previously posed as an open question [13, 10]. Among other things, we give a queuing policy that guarantees bounded delivery time whenever the rate- 1 adversary injects a sequence of packets for which there exists a schedule with a finite upper bound on the delivery times of <b>all</b> <b>packets,</b> and adheres to certain additional conditions. On the negative side we show that there exist rate- 1 sequences of packets {{for which there is no}} schedule with a finite upper bound on the delivery times of <b>all</b> <b>packets.</b> We thus answer an open question posed by Gamarnik [13]. We further show that delivering <b>all</b> <b>packets</b> while maintaining stability (we coin the term “reliability ” for this property) can be done by an offline scheduler whenever the injection of packets is done at rate of at most 1. But, on the other hand, we also show that there is no online protocol (even centralized) that can achieve that property against all rate- 1 adversaries. We thus answer an open question of Borodin et al. [10]...|$|R

5000|$|Almost <b>all</b> <b>packet</b> types {{contain a}} {{parameter}} flagging whether its information is relevant for the [...] "nominal" [...] or [...] "reverse" [...] direction (or both). If a train sees balise 1 before balise 2 then it passes over {{the group in}} the nominal direction. Consequently, some packets may be dropped by the application software of the receiver {{if they are not}} designated for the relevant direction. The ERTMS header block of 50 bits contains the ETCS version, the current number and total count of balises within a balise group (up to 8 balises), a flag whether it is a copy (up to 4 copies) that increases chances for the receiver to see the telegram of the balise in a group, a serial number flagging whether the message has changed lately, a 10-bit country identifier along with the 14-bit balise group identifier allowing for a unique ID of every balise group. The linking information informs about the distance to the next balise group (one linking packet per direction) and the required train reaction if the next balise group is missed (e.g. train stop). The movement authority packet defines a maximum speed that may be used for a given maximum distance and maximum time - setting the maximum speed to zero will force the train to stop. The gradient profile may have a variable length based on the contained pairs of section length (scalar and number in the metric system) and section gradient (uphill/downhill flag and a number in %). Similarly the international static speed profile is given in a variable count of section parts with each part denoting the section length (number in meters - the scale is only given once {{at the start of the}} packet for all sections), the maximum speed (number * 5 km/h - allowed numbers are 0-120 i.e. some spare values are left over) and a flag if the speed restriction applies to the front or rear end of the train (possibly allowing for a delay). The trailer packet only contains its packet id with no parameters where 255 equals the state of all bits set in the 8-bit packet id field (11111111).|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} the {{performance}} of TCP over Mobile IP (MIP) hand-offs is analysed. During Mobile IP hand-offs a Mobile Node is forced to suffer network service disruption. It is identified that due to the exponential back-off retransmission scheme of TCP, timeout values may reach sizes longer than the MIP hand-off. In these conditions the TCP communication may not resume even though network connectivity is established after the hand-off. Furthermore, it is identified that TCP {{is based on the}} assumption that <b>all</b> <b>packet</b> loss is due to network congestion. As such, <b>all</b> <b>packet</b> loss that is caused during a MIP hand-off will be perceived by TCP as the product of network congestion and reduce its transmission rate. The proposed solution involves the establishment of a communication between the protocols of MIP and TCP for the communication of information such as the beginning and end of MIP hand-offs. This information can be utilised by TCP to respond accordingly with respect to its status as sender or receiver. The improvement in performance brought by this scheme is identified through the use of simulations...|$|E
