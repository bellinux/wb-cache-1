5|$|Jedi Knight is {{primarily}} a first-person shooter, although it does offer {{the choice of a}} third-person view. The game consists of twenty-one levels with objectives which the player must complete before being able to continue to the next level. There are weapons available in each level and after level three, the player has the use of a lightsaber, along with the Force. In addition to being an effective weapon, the lightsaber is also <b>a</b> <b>useful</b> <b>tool</b> <b>for</b> the player, providing light in dark areas, deflecting incoming blaster fire and cutting through some obstacles.|$|E
5|$|Kouao and Climbié {{left the}} Ivory Coast {{possibly}} in November 1998 and flew to Paris, France, where Climbié enrolled at school. By December 1998, however, Kouao began to receive warnings about Climbié's absenteeism, and in February 1999, the school issued a child-at-risk notification {{and a social}} worker became involved. The school observed how Climbié tended to fall asleep in class, and the headteacher later recalled Kouao's mentioning Climbié suffering from some form of dermatological condition and that, on her last visit to the school on 25 March 1999, Climbié had a shaven head and was wearing a wig. When they left France, Kouao owed the authorities £2,000, after being wrongly paid in child benefit, and it is claimed that Kouao viewed Climbié as <b>a</b> <b>useful</b> <b>tool</b> <b>for</b> claiming benefits. Kouao had also been evicted {{from her home in}} France because of rent arrears.|$|E

Establishing that a given number is a Liouville number {{provides}} <b>a</b> <b>useful</b> <b>tool</b> <b>for</b> proving a given number is transcendental. However, not every transcendental number is a Liouville number. The terms in the continued fraction expansion of every Liouville number are unbounded; using a counting argument, one can then show {{that there must be}} uncountably many transcendental numbers which are not Liouville. Using the explicit continued fraction expansion of e, one can show that e {{is an example of a}} transcendental number that is not Liouville. Mahler proved in 1953 that π is another such example.|$|E
25|$|Programs for characterizing planets {{outside of}} the solar system depend largely on {{spectroscopy}} to identify atmospheric constituents and states, especially those that point to the presence of life forms or which could support life. However, brightness can be measured for very distant Earth-sized objects that are too faint for spectroscopic analysis. A. Mallama has demonstrated that phase curve analysis may be <b>a</b> <b>useful</b> <b>tool</b> <b>for</b> identifying planets that are Earth-like. Additionally, J. Bailey has pointed out that phase curve anomalies such as the brightness excess of Venus could be useful indicators of atmospheric constituents such as water, which might be essential to life in the universe.|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, a bivector or 2-vector is a {{quantity}} in exterior algebra or geometric algebra that extends {{the idea of}} scalars and vectors. If a scalar is considered an order zero quantity, and a vector is an order one quantity, then a bivector {{can be thought of}} as being of order two. Bivectors have applications in many areas of mathematics and physics. They are related to complex numbers in two dimensions and to both pseudovectors and quaternions in three dimensions. They can be used to generate rotations in any number of dimensions, and are <b>a</b> <b>useful</b> <b>tool</b> <b>for</b> classifying such rotations. They also are used in physics, tying together a number of otherwise unrelated quantities.|$|E

25|$|This {{realignment}} in Confucian {{thought was}} {{parallel to the}} development of Legalism, which saw filial piety as self-interest and not <b>a</b> <b>useful</b> <b>tool</b> <b>for</b> a ruler to create an effective state. A disagreement between these two political philosophies came to a head in 223 BC when the Qin state conquered all of China. Li Si, Prime Minister of the Qin Dynasty, convinced Qin Shi Huang to abandon the Confucians' recommendation of awarding fiefs akin to the Zhou Dynasty before them which he saw as being against to the Legalist idea of centralizing the state around the ruler. When the Confucian advisers pressed their point, Li Si had many Confucian scholars killed and their books burned—considered a huge blow to the philosophy and Chinese scholarship.|$|E
25|$|Because of his {{position}} as {{the heir to the}} throne after his elder brother Gustav, he was early targeted as <b>a</b> <b>useful</b> <b>tool</b> <b>for</b> the opposition to his brother: already in the 1760s, the Caps (party) tried to use him against his brother the crown prince through his then love interest countess Brita Horn, daughter of the Cap's politician Adam Horn. This was in the critical period following the December Crisis (1768). Gustav, however, was always careful to prevent Charles from being used by the opposition, which came to its first test during the 1768 crisis, when Charles, ultimately, did not let himself be used by the Caps party. In 1770, he made a journey through Germany and France alone.|$|E
500|$|For horticultural purposes, all Narcissus cultivars {{are split}} into 13 {{divisions}} as first described by Kington (1998), for the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS), based partly upon flower form (shape {{and length of}} corona), number of flowers per stem, flowering period and partly upon genetic background. Division 13, which includes wild daffodils, is the exception to this scheme. The classification is <b>a</b> <b>useful</b> <b>tool</b> <b>for</b> planning planting.

500|$|Stebbins's review, [...] "The {{significance}} of polyploidy in plant evolution", published in American Naturalist in 1940, demonstrated how work done on artificial polyploids and natural polyploid complexes {{had shown that}} polyploidy was important in developing large, complex, and widespread genera. However, {{by looking at the}} history of polyploidy in plant families, he argued that polyploidy was only common in herbaceous perennials and infrequent in woody plants and annuals. As such, polyploids played a conservative role in evolution since problems with fertility prevented the acquisition and replication of new genetic material that might lead to a new line of evolution. This work continued with the 1947 paper [...] "Types of polyploids: their classification and significance", which detailed a system for the classification of polyploids and described Stebbins' ideas about the role of paleopolyploidy in angiosperm evolution, where he argued that chromosome number may be <b>a</b> <b>useful</b> <b>tool</b> <b>for</b> the construction of phylogenies. These reviews were highly influential and provided a basis for others to study the role of polyploidy in evolution.|$|E
500|$|Large game hunting {{has been}} studied {{extensively}} as a signal of men’s willingness to take physical risks, as well as showcase strength and coordination. Costly signalling theory is <b>a</b> <b>useful</b> <b>tool</b> <b>for</b> understanding food sharing among hunter gatherers {{because it can be}} applied to situations in which delayed reciprocity is not a viable explanation. Instances that are particularly inconsistent with the delayed reciprocity hypothesis are those in which a hunter shares his kill indiscriminately with all members of a large group. In these situations, the individuals sharing meat have no control over whether or not their generosity will be reciprocated, and free riding becomes an attractive strategy for those receiving meat. Free riders are people who reap the benefits of group-living without contributing to its maintenance. [...] Fortunately, costly signalling theory can fill some of the gaps left by the delayed reciprocity hypothesis. Hawkes has suggested that men target large game and publicly share meat to draw social attention or to show off. Such display and the resulting favorable attention can improve a hunter’s reputation by providing information about his phenotypic quality. High quality signallers are more successful in acquiring mates and allies. Thus, costly signalling theory can explain apparently wasteful and altruistic behaviour.|$|E
