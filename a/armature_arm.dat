50|$|This design {{also allows}} us to {{increase}} the output voltage by modifying {{the shape of the}} armature. We can add more rectangular loops to the armature as seen on the picture on the right. The additional loops at the <b>armature</b> <b>arm</b> are connected in series, which are actually additional windings of the same conductor wire to form a coil in rectangular shape. In this example, there are 4 windings in the coil. Since the shapes of all windings are the same, the amount of the lines of force will be cut at the same amount in the same direction {{at the same time in}} all windings. This creates in phase AC output for these 4 windings. As a result, the output voltage is increased 4 time as shown in the sine wave in the diagram.|$|E
50|$|The {{relationship}} of armature rotation and the AC output {{can be seen}} in this series of pictures. Due to the circular motion of the armature against the straight lines of force, a variable number of lines of force will be cut even at a constant speed of the motion. At zero degrees, the rectangular arm of the armature does not cut any lines of force, giving zero voltage output. As the <b>armature</b> <b>arm</b> rotates at a constant speed toward the 90° position, more lines are cut. The lines of force are cut at most when the armature is at the 90° position, giving out the most current on one direction. As it turns toward the 180° position, lesser number of lines of force are cut, giving out lesser voltage until it becomes zero again at the 180° position. The voltage starts to increase again as the armature heads to the opposite pole at the 270° position. Toward this position, the current is generated on the opposite direction, giving out the maximum voltage on the opposite side. The voltage decrease again as it completes the full rotation. In one rotation, the AC output is produced with one complete cycle as represented in the sine wave.|$|E
40|$|Four spent {{females of}} deep-sea pelagic gonatid squid Gonatopsis octopedatus, dorsal mantle length 24 - 39 cm, {{were caught in}} the 0 - 50 m layer of the Okhotsk Sea over the depths of 92 - 126 and {{approximately}} 3300 m. Two alike but smaller (12 - 13. 5 cm) females were caught at the surface of the Japan Sea over the depths of 3000 - 3300 m. They were degenerated, combjelly-like in consistence, most of the <b>arm</b> <b>armature</b> was lost, the oviducts were empty or contained not more than 3 - 5 eggs up to 4. 0 - 4. 3 mm in length. On the contrary, mature males were not degenerated, with most arm hooks and suckers present. The gelatinous degeneration in females begins rather early, at 11 or 111 maturity stages, but at very different sizes. In this period the feeding stops, as degenerated females cannot catch prey. It is supposed that females spawn and juveniles hatch in deep layers, all the eggs are spawned in a short time, and then the females come passively to the surface and die. The difference in size · between females from the two seas may be caused by difference in productivity between very productive Okhotsk Sea and less productive Japan Sea...|$|R
40|$|To {{develop a}} recoverable, noninvasive medium to {{long-term}} tag attachment platform which would enable detailed data sets {{to be collected}} over {{extended periods of time}} (multiple days to multiple months) and would aid in understanding natural whale behaviors and assessing anthropogenic impacts on vulnerable populations. OBJECTIVES • To develop a peduncle style tag and tag deployment system as a means of attaching medium to long-term tags to free swimming whales. Two different systems are currently under development: 1) a pole deployed peduncle saddle pack tag for mid-sized whales 2) a net gun deployed towed telemetry buoy for large whales • To demonstrate the potential of the peduncle style tag as a benign medium to long-term, noninvasive tag attachment platform either through field trials or in a captive animal setting. APPROACH Peduncle saddle pack tag A padded harness will fit around the tail stock of the whale at the narrowest portion of the peduncle just before the fluke insertion point. To deploy the belt, a cantilevered pole mounted on the bow of a small inflatable will drop a spring loaded armature on the caudal terminus of the whale (Figure 1). Once triggered, the <b>armature’s</b> sickle shaped <b>arms</b> will close, latching a buckle under the whale’s belly. As the arms lift away, the elasticized belt is cinched to snugly secure the semi-rigid saddle housing the tag electronics to the dorsal ridge of the peduncle. An electronic timed release combined with a backup...|$|R
40|$|Regurgitations were {{collected}} from 41 black-browed albatross adults feeding chicks at Bird Island (54 °S 38 °W), South Georgia in February 1986. The samples were sorted into recognisable food categories and weighed. Cephalopods were identified {{by means of the}} lower beak, or in some cases the gladius, and allometric equations were used to calculate mantle length and wet body weight represented by beaks. The samples contained 35. 5 %Euphausia superba, 30. 9 % cephalopods and 27. 1 % fish, by weight. A total of 21 samples contained recognisable cephalopod remains and 20 contained specimens that could be identified. In all, 50 cephalopod specimens, representing an estimated 6, 866 g wet weight, were identified. The diet was dominated in terms of numbers, weight and percent occurrence by the ommastrephid squidMartialia hyadesi, and in most cases the entire squid was present with only partial digestion of the skin and <b>arm</b> <b>armature.</b> The cranchiid squidGaliteuthis glacialis was the only other cephalopod of numerical importance but no soft parts were present suggesting that, although significant in the diet of the adults, this species was not being fed to chicks. One specimen each ofGonatus antarcticus, Chiroteuthis sp.,Histioteuthis sp. B. and the octopodidPareledone polymorpha were also present. The cephalopod composition of the diet corresponded closely with a collection made 10 years earlier. The commonest species in the bird's diet,M. hyadesi, has not been found in net and jig samples at South Georgia although it has been taken from the Antarctic Polar Frontal Zone {{to the west of the}} Island. The presence of almost complete, undigested, specimens ofM. hyadesi in the bird's diet indicates that it occurs relatively close to South Georgia. M. hyadesi preys largely on myctophid fishes, which themselves prey on small zooplankters, so a significant component of the black-browed albatross diet depends on a food chain which largely by-passesE. superba...|$|R
