2500|$|The word gained {{currency}} {{with the}} overly literal interpretations of Wagner's music by Hans von Wolzogen, who in 1876 published a Leitfaden (guide or manual) to the Ring. In it {{he claimed to}} have isolated and named all of the recurring motifs in the cycle (the motif of [...] "Servitude", the [...] "Spear" [...] or [...] "Treaty" [...] motif, etc.), often leading to absurdities or contradictions with Wagner's actual practice. Some of the motifs he identified began to appear in the published musical scores of the operas, arousing Wagner's annoyance; his wife Cosima Wagner quoted him as saying [...] "People will think all this nonsense is done at my request!". In fact Wagner himself never publicly named any of his leitmotifs, [...] preferring to emphasise their flexibility of <b>association,</b> <b>role</b> in the musical form, and emotional effect. The practice of naming leitmotifs nevertheless continued, featuring in the work of prominent Wagnerian critics Ernest Newman, Deryck Cooke and Robert Donington.|$|E
5000|$|An <b>{{association}}</b> <b>role</b> {{is given}} {{end of an}} association and describes {{the role of the}} corresponding class. For example, a [...] "subscriber" [...] role describes the way instances of the class [...] "Person" [...] participate in a [...] "subscribes-to" [...] association with the class [...] "Magazine". Also, a [...] "Magazine" [...] has the [...] "subscribed magazine" [...] role in the same association. <b>Association</b> <b>role</b> multiplicity describes how many instances correspond to each instance of the other class of the association.

40|$|AFIT Wide Spectrum Object Modeling Environment (AWSOME) {{automatically}} generates {{executable code}} by applying transforms {{to the formal}} specifications developed from the domain knowledge. AWSOME uses the specification language called as AFIT Wide Spectrum Language (AWL). All the transforms developed for AWSOME depend on and manipulate Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) created by parsing the formal specifications of a model. The main idea is to speed {{the process of creating}} error free code, to aid reusability of code and also to make the maintenance changes to be consistent and correct. The AWSOME metamodel contains the structural (object) model, the functional (operations) model and the dynamic (state based) model. This thesis focuses on designing transforms based on the structural model, with focus on transforming associations, aggregations and associative objects and on transforming the invariants. Given a formal specification, this thesis transforms associations into one way pointers, two-way pointers or associative object pointers, transforms aggregations into one way pointers and also transforms associative objects into associative object pointers. It also updates the references to the association 2 ̆ 7 s role names which are lost when the associations are transformed and removed from the AST. All together the fifteen transforms developed in this thesis result in an output containing valid expressions which refer not only to the local attributes or method arguments but also to the transformed <b>association</b> <b>role</b> names...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{ultimate}} aims of biomedical text mining would be to extract both explicit and implicit associations between different types of entities. In addition, assigning roles that entities have or may have in biological processes is also of interest. In this talk I will be discussing our experience in selecting and engineering textual features that can help in mining <b>associations</b> and <b>roles</b> from literature. Depending on tasks and entities involved, we have used four types of features: from simple words and terms, to words and semantic classes, to textual contexts, to contexts augmented with additional background attributes.

The final section of the program has included Julie Virgo's paper on the <b>association</b> <b>role</b> in developing professional competence. I would like to present an argument which I hope will both offer some new material and provide a framework for summarizing many of the ideas presented during the course of the clinic. I will discuss competencies needed by librarians from the point of view of the cooperative library agency. I see two major needs. The first is for a body of professionals to work in such agencies and the second is for an enlightened clientele of librarians who are familiar with the role of those agencies and able to take the greatest advantage of what they can offer. I believe that the secret of these competencies lie less in knowing how to perform certain tasks than in a values clarification process which identifies values such as cooperation, humanism and ethical behavior as foremost among the characteristics needed by librarians in cooperating for the use of library technology. published or submitted for publicatio...|$|E
40|$|Patient {{satisfaction}} {{levels are}} a valuable {{source of information}} for healthcare providers when assessing {{the quality of care}} delivered to patients. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the satisfaction level of Division I student-athletes in regards to the athletic training services they received from their certified athletic trainers. Following a review of the literature, the researcher developed a questionnaire which contained the following sections: participant information, student-athlete satisfaction with the athletic training services, strengths of the athletic training services and suggestions for improving the athletic training services. Using a Likert scale, participants rated their level of satisfaction regarding the athletic training services provided by certified athletic trainers. The athletic training services measured fell within the six domains of athletic training as identified by the National Athletic Trainers' <b>Association</b> <b>Role</b> Delineation Study conducted in 1999. Written comments were also requested regarding the strengths of the athletic trainingservices as well as suggestions for improving the athletic training services. The questionnaire was administered to 48 (28 males, 20 females) Division I student-athletes. Means and standard deviations of participant responses indicated a high level of satisfaction with their certified athletic trainers in all six domains. Conversely, the participants in this study did not indicate any athletic training services with which they were dissatisfied. T-Test results demonstrate that male participants had higher satisfaction levels in the following domains: prevention; recognition, evaluation & assessment; and treatment, rehabilitation & reconditioning. Conversely, female participants had higher satisfaction levels in the following domains: immediate care; organization & administration; and professional development and responsibility. The findings of this study suggest that Division I student-athletes are satisfied with the athletic training services they receive from certified athletic trainers. Future research in this area could include a qualitative study of student-athlete satisfaction with the athletic training services they receive from certified athletic trainers in order to lead to additional criteria for measuring satisfaction not included in the current study.
