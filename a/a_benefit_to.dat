Both parties stated the planned intersection was less expensive than a conventional stop light.|$|E
5|$|In Age of Empires III: The Asian Dynasties, {{the three}} new civilizations must build a Wonder to advance from age to age, instead of {{advancing}} from the Town Center. Unlike previous Age of Empires games, the player does not achieve victory {{by building a}} wonder. Players can choose from a selection of wonders, each having benefits unique to their civilization. Once built, this wonder provides an initial bonus of units or resources, while continuing to provide <b>a</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>to</b> the player's civilization. This initial bonus becomes larger, depending on which age is being advanced to. Since the wonder is a building, players can assign different numbers of villagers to build it, which affects the speed of advancement. Wonders that are destroyed cannot be rebuilt.|$|E
5|$|This {{behaviour}} {{appears at}} first to be an evolutionary paradox, since helping others costs precious resources and decreases one's own fitness. Previously, many had interpreted this as an aspect of group selection: individuals are doing {{what is best for}} the survival of the population or species as a whole. British evolutionary biologist W. D. Hamilton used gene-frequency analysis in his inclusive fitness theory to show how hereditary altruistic traits can evolve if there is sufficient genetic similarity between actors and recipients of such altruism (including close relatives). Hamilton's inclusive fitness has since been successfully applied to a wide range of organisms, including humans. Similarly, Robert Trivers, thinking in terms of the gene-centred model, developed the theory of reciprocal altruism, whereby one organism provides <b>a</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>to</b> another in the expectation of future reciprocation. Dawkins popularised these ideas in The Selfish Gene, and developed them in his own work. In June 2012 Dawkins was highly critical of fellow biologist E.O. Wilson's 2012 book The Social Conquest of Earth as misunderstanding Hamilton's theory of kin selection. Dawkins has also been strongly critical of the Gaia hypothesis of the independent scientist James Lovelock.|$|E

Moreover, some studies find that CSR programs are motivated by corporate managers' personal interests {{at the cost of}} the shareholders so they are a type of an agency problem in corporations.|$|E

25|$|Given {{their large}} ranges, {{it is thought}} that bees of the Euglossine tribe trapline for more {{efficient}} foraging. Traplining occurs when an insect will visit a series of flowers in a stable, repeatable sequence. Traplining gives the bee an advantage in that they have a series of flowers they can visit to gain nectar. There is also <b>a</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>to</b> the flora, which can be many kilometers from each other, but can still be cross-pollinated because they are on the same traplining path. Ef. surinamensis and other orchid bees are major players in flora gene flow, and are vital to the continued health of tropical forests.|$|E
25|$|A {{relatively}} obscure {{design in}} the West, it was {{a radical departure from}} NEC's previous V-series CPUs—the NEC V20-V50 series—, which were based on the Intel x86 model, although it retained the ability to emulate them. According to NEC's documentation, the architectural change was made due to the increasing demand and diversity of programs, calling for a processor with both power (the 32-bit internal bus) and flexibility, having large numbers of general-purpose registers—a common feature of RISC architectures and <b>a</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>to</b> the emerging high-level languages. The V60 architecture retained however CISC features (which its manual describe as mainframe-based) like variable-length instructions, memory-to-memory operations including string manipulation, and fairly complex operand addressing schemes.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, the TPA {{proposed}} {{to build a}} $38 million pedestrian tunnel to the airport from the foot of Bathurst Street. The TPA proposed that the project be paid for in the majority from federal and provincial economic stimulus funds.

The project was not included on a City-approved list of projects submitted to the Government of Canada. On October 6, 2009, the TPA, having not yet received approval for the tunnel project, {{announced that it was}} now too late to proceed to meet the March 2011 completion date deadline condition for the project to receive federal infrastructure stimulus funds.|$|E

25|$|Though the Animorphs {{can assume}} {{the form of}} any animal they touch, there are several {{limitations}} to the ability. The most vital {{is that they can}} stay in animal form for a maximum of two hours, otherwise they will be unable to return to human form. Others include having to de-morph back to human in between morphs, only tight clothing being able to be carried over with a morph, and having to consistently maintain concentration during a morph to prevent the animal's natural instincts from overwhelming the human intellect. <b>A</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>to</b> morphing is that it allows the team to heal any superficial, non-genetic injury, sustained as a human or in a morph. Also, while in morph, they can telepathically communicate with anyone nearby.|$|E

A High Court injunction by Justice Casey stopped the tour. The All Blacks did not tour South Africa until {{after the fall of}} the apartheid régime (1990–1994), although after the 1985 tour was cancelled an unofficial tour took place in 1986 by a team that included 28 out of the 30 All Blacks selected for the 1985 tour, known as the New Zealand Cavaliers but often advertised in South Africa as the All Blacks or depicted with the Silver Fern.|$|E
25|$|Some medical {{systems have}} a {{practice}} of routinely performing chest x-rays before surgery. The premise behind this practice is that the physician might discover some unknown medical condition which would complicate the surgery, and that upon discovering this with the chest x-ray, the physician would adapt the surgery practice accordingly. In fact, medical specialty professional organizations recommend against routine pre-operative chest x-rays for patients who have an unremarkable medical history and presented with a physical exam which did not indicate a chest x-ray. Routine x-ray examination {{is more likely to}} result in problems like misdiagnosis, overtreatment, or other negative outcomes than it is to result in <b>a</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>to</b> the patient. Likewise, other tests including complete blood count, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, basic metabolic panel, and urinalysis should not be done unless the results of these tests can help evaluate surgical risk.|$|E
