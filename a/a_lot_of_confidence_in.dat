500|$|Following {{the death}} of the {{commander}} of the V Bomber Command, Brigadier General Kenneth Walker, in an air raid over Rabaul in January 1943, the commander of the Fifth Air Force, Lieutenant General George Kenney asked Lieutenant General Henry H. Arnold, the chief of Army Air Forces to send Ramey to Australia as a replacement. The two men had known each other for years and Ramey had recently been on Kenney's staff when Kenney was commander of the Fourth Air Force. [...] "I had <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> him," [...] Kenney later wrote, [...] "and believed he would do a real job for me. Arnold replied the next day that I could have him." [...] Ramey assumed command of V Bomber Command in January 1943. After the arguments over bombing tactics with Walker, Kenney was pleased that Ramey liked the skip bombing tactics the Fifth Air Force was developing. These tactics were put in practice with devastating effect at the Battle of the Bismarck Sea in March 1943.|$|E
500|$|MPC {{additionally}} {{worked on}} the disappearing waterfall that serves as Jennifer's grave when she is killed {{at the beginning of}} the film. They transformed the mysterious waterfall into a whirlpool. [...] "We came up with an approach that we thought would work because we had <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> our water sims", stated Nordby. [...] "The waterfall appears both as a day and night shot, so we had to integrate with the water. And the night shots play a pivotal role in the film, and we do a huge crane over." [...] They could not lock it to a pan or to a tilt and filming the shots was difficult due to the actual base of the waterfall being out of reach. Nordby said, [...] "I eventually lowered down a shot—a ton of reference of the area because I knew we'd have to do some digi-matte work to recreate the basin that the whirlpool ends up in." [...] They soon realized that there was an insufficient amount of churning and foam to read as real as the location. The CG Supervisor, Pete Dionne, presented a different idea. [...] "He grabbed chunks of that river and tialing it so that it had a nice stretch of birds' eye point of view of the water that existed on the location in the lighting situation we were trying to match", stated Nordby. [...] "And then he projected that onto a whirlpool of animated sprites and had similar enough texture to the actual water that existed there, but pulled control into lighting it and could add depth mainly to the center of it." [...] Dealing with [...] "very shallow" [...] water, the team had to take extra care when filming the scenes.|$|E

2500|$|Titans {{starting}} {{running back}} Chris Johnson - {{who had the}} vast majority of the carries in 2009, rushing for over 2000 yards - will reportedly get fewer carries in 2010. This will likely mean in increase in number of carries for Ringer. Backup Running back LenDale White is an impending free agent, and his future with the team also affects Ringer's future.

[...] During the first pre-season game of the 2010 season, Ringer led the team in rushing yards (60 yards, seven carries). Fullback Ahmad Hall said of Ringer [...] "Everybody knew he was a great back last year... He really, really immersed himself in the playbook, and picked everything up. If anything happened to C.J. he could definitely fill in and execute well. He is a smart guy, and he applies himself. The guy is a good running back." ...|$|E
