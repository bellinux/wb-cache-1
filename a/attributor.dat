40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 56) The {{following is}} an inquiry into the cognitive process underlying the attribution of responsibility (AR) for negative events. Two models of this process were examined and tested. The first of these models was the defensive attribution hypothesis (DAR). Originally proposed by Walster (1966) and later modified by Shaver (1970) and Shaw and McMartin (1973), the DAR describes {{a process in which}} <b>attributors</b> would attempt to avoid the unpleasant thought that they might possibly be held responsible for negative events similar to those generated by another individual. It is suggested that this avoidance could be accomplished through assignments of responsibility which reflect defensive distortions of causal relationships. In its most recent form, the DAR predicts high order interactions among negative outcome severity, situational relevance and personal relevance. An examination of the results generated in previous tests of the DAR suggested that this hypothesis was not a sufficiently inclusive explanation of the AR elicited by negative events. The second of the two models tested in this inquiry posited an unbiased processing of information and attribution of responsibility. The formulations of Harold Kelley (1967, 1971, 1973) formed the basis for suggesting that <b>attributors</b> would invoke "cognitive schemata" reflecting the usual probabilities of association between negative events and their potential causal antecedents. It was generally hypothesized that <b>attributors</b> would make "normative assumptions" and/or probable inferences about the prevailing causal relationships. It was further hypothesized that <b>attributors</b> would base their attributions of responsibility on these unbiased inferences. (See more in text. ...|$|R

By distinguishing carefully between what in the account describes {{the contribution of the}} <b>attributor’s</b> context and what describes the contribution of the subject’s situation, we can resolve this dispute in favour of Holliday’s (2015) claim that the iteration principles are rendered invalid. However, that {{is not the end of}} the story. For Lewis’s account still predicts that counterexamples to the negative iteration principle (¬Kp→K¬Kp) come out as elusive: such counterexamples can occur only in possibilities which the <b>attributors</b> of knowledge are ignoring.

5000|$|In {{the studies}} {{completed}} {{up to this}} point, no support for contextualism has been found. This critique of contextualism {{can be summed up}} as: stakes have no impact on evidence. More specifically, non-philosophical intuitions about knowledge attributions are not affected by the importance to the potential knower of the accuracy of that knowledge. Some may argue that these empirical studies for the most part have not been well designed for testing contextualism, which claims that the context of the <b>attributor</b> of [...] "knowledge" [...] affects the epistemic standards that govern their claims. Because most of the empirical studies don't vary the stakes for the <b>attributor,</b> but for the subject being described, these studies are more relevant to the evaluation of John Hawthorne's [...] "Subject-Sensitive Invariantism" [...] or Jason Stanley's [...] "Interest-Relative Invariantism"—views on which the stakes for the putative subject of knowledge can affect whether that subject knows—than they are of contextualism. However, Feltz & Zarpentine (forthcoming) have tested the stakes for both the subject and the <b>attributor,</b> and the results are not in keeping with contextualism.

Philosophy of mind and developmental psychology also draw on simulation to explain our capacity to mentalize, i.e., to understand mental states (intentions, desires, feelings, and beliefs) of others (aka theory of mind). In this context, the basic idea of simulation is that the <b>attributor</b> attempts to mimic the mental activity of the target by using his own psychological resources. [...] In order to understand the mental state of another when observing the other acting, the individual imagines herself/himself performing the same action, a covert simulation that does not lead to an overt behavior. One critical aspect of the simulation theory of mind is the idea that in trying to impute mental states to others, an <b>attributor</b> has to set aside her own current mental states, and substitutes those of the target.|$|E

30|$|Vande Kopple’s (1985) {{classification}} for meta-discourse included textual {{and interpersonal}} main categories.

5000|$|However, contextualist {{epistemology}} {{has been}} criticized by several philosophers. Contextualism is opposed to any general form of Invariantism, which claims that knowledge is not context-sensitive (i.e. it is invariant). More recent criticism {{has been in the}} form of rival theories, including Subject-Sensitive Invariantism (SSI), mainly due to the work of John Hawthorne (2004), and Interest-Relative Invariantism (IRI), due to Jason Stanley (2005). SSI claims that it is the context of the subject of the knowledge attribution that determines the epistemic standards, whereas Contextualism maintains it is the <b>attributor.</b> IRI, on the other hand, argues that it is the context of the practical interests of the subject of the knowledge attribution that determines the epistemic standards. Stanley writes that bare IRI is [...] "simply the claim that whether or not someone knows that p may be determined in part by practical facts about the subject's environment." [...] ("Contextualism" [...] is a misnomer for either form of Invariantism, since [...] "Contextualism" [...] among epistemologists is considered to be restricted to a claim about the context-sensitivity of knowledge attributions (or the word [...] "knows"). Thus, any view which maintains that something other than knowledge attributions are context-sensitive is not, strictly speaking, a form of Contextualism.) DeRose (2009) responds to recent attacks on contextualism, and argues that contextualism is superior to these recent rivals.|$|E

References to general dispositions also undergo a much greater developmental increase among Americans than among Hindus, whereas references to contextual factors show the opposite pattern of developmental change.

40|$|Objective: This study {{aimed to}} {{describe}} <b>attributors</b> of family stressors which cause rehospitalizations {{in patients with}} psychotic disorders. Materials and methods: In a cross sectional study (during 2006 - 7) 203 randomly selected psychiatric readmitted patients with psychotic diagnosis and registered demographic and psychiatric clinical data were included. Family stressors as the possible cause of readmission were asked through a structured interview by the psychiatrist. Results: Family factors were reported as a cause in 132 (60. 6 %) cases. Poor family support (n= 88; 43. 3 %) and family conflict (n= 58; 28. 6 %) were the two most prevalent family stressors, respectively. Bivariate analysis showed that admission due to family issues was different among men and women (79. 1 % vs. 38. 7 %, respectively p< 0. 001) and according to job situation (p< 0. 001), and literacy (p= 0. 036). According to logistic regression, gender (men) was the only predictor of admission due to family issues (OR= 5. 989, CI= 3. 220 - 11. 141, p< 0. 001). Conclusion: Family factors are prevalent causes of return to hospital in patients with psychotic disorders, and this is more prevalent in men. An approach to decrease the marital stressors is needed in patients with psychotic disorders. In this approach, increasing family support and decreasing family conflict are essential. </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} I promote Michael Williams’s methodological contextualism {{as the best}} {{candidate}} for a contextualist response to scepticism. Often {{when people talk about}} contextualist responses to scepticism they think of a particular branch of contextualism, a group of semantic theses. In the first two sections I explain how this semantic contextualist view is thought to amount to a response to scepticism, and consider how well the most popular form – <b>attributor</b> semantic contextualism – fares against a number of objections. I highlight two features of <b>attributor</b> Contextualism as the source of these problems. In sections 3 and 4 I explain the alternative inferential contextualism which Williams offers, and the other features of his methodological contextualism response to scepticism. I show that his view avoids the objections raised against the more popular <b>attributor</b> view because it doesn’t have the two features I highlight as problematic. As it stands, Williams’s methodological view does not offer a complete response to scepticism, but I suggest two additions which can be made to it to remedy this.

Newspaper accounts of baseball and football games were coded for attributional content. These data supported a motivational or self-enhancement explanation for the tendency to make internal attributions for success and external attributions for failure. No support was found for Miller and Ross's contention that this tendency is medi-ated by expectancies. It was also found that more attributions were-made after unexpected, as opposed to expected, outcomes. And in accordance with Weiner's attribution model, there was a tendency for relatively more stable attributions to be given after expected outcomes. The. {{advantages and disadvantages of}} studying attributions in archival data and the possibility of attributions justi-fying behavior rather than explaining behavior are discussed. An important motivator of human thought is the desire to understand the determinants of behavior. Like the psychologist, the average person is assumed to test "causal theories" concerning the reasons behind his or her own actions and the actions of other people. Such causal knowledge is highly adaptive, yielding to lay <b>attributors</b> an understanding of (and consequently the ability to predict and con-trol) many situations in which they find themselves. The desire to achieve an understanding of the causes of human behavior has always been considered the chief motivation underlying the attribution process (e. g., Jones & Davis, 1965; Kelley, 1967, 1971).
