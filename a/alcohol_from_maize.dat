25|$|Maize is a {{major source}} of starch. Cornstarch (maize flour) {{is a major}} {{ingredient}} in home cooking and in many industrialized food products. Maize is also {{a major source of}} cooking oil (corn oil) and of maize gluten. Maize starch can be hydrolyzed and enzymatically treated to produce syrups, particularly high fructose corn syrup, a sweetener; and also fermented and distilled to produce grain alcohol. Grain <b>alcohol</b> <b>from</b> <b>maize</b> is traditionally the source of Bourbon whiskey. Maize is sometimes used as the starch source for beer. Within the United States, the usage of maize for human consumption constitutes about 1/40th of the amount grown in the country. In the United States and Canada, maize is mostly grown to feed livestock, as forage, silage (made by fermentation of chopped green cornstalks), or grain. Maize meal is also a significant ingredient of some commercial animal food products, such as dog food.|$|E

50|$|Stefan Karagiosov {{studied in}} Tarnovo. All the four {{brothers}} started own business - merchants in Tarnovo and Constantinople (today Istanbul). In 1860 Stefan Karagiosov established the first factory in Tarnovo for bread <b>alcohol</b> <b>from</b> <b>maize.</b> In 1861 Stefan Karagiosov {{built the first}} silk factory in Tarnovo with his business partner Doino Vichenti from Bergamo (Italy). They bought machines from Italy and developed their entrepreneurship. Since 1862 the silk factory opened branch in Gabrovo. In 1869 Doino Vichenti left Bulgaria and Stefan Karagiosov became the only owner of the two factories in Tarnovo and Gabrovo.Stefan Karagiosoff built a bid and powerful flour-mill in Tarnovo. Using the scraps of food from the mill and bread alcohol company, Stefan Karagiosov fattened 250 - 300 animals per year.|$|E

40|$|Fusicoccin affects several {{physiological}} processes {{regulated by}} the plasma membrane H(+) -ATPase in higher plants while other organisms having P-type H(+) -ATPases (e. g., fungi) are fusicoccin-insensitive. We have previously shown that fusicoccin binding to its receptor is necessary for H(+) -ATPase stimulation and have achieved the functional reconstitution into liposomes of fusicoccin receptors and the H(+) -ATPase <b>from</b> <b>maize.</b> In this paper we show that fusicoccin sensitivity can be conferred on the H(+) -ATPase from Neurospora crassa, a fungus insensitive to fusicoccin. In fact, H+ pumping by purified H(+) -ATPase from Neurospora crassa reconstituted into liposomes containing crude or partially purified fusicoccin receptors <b>from</b> <b>maize</b> was markedly enhanced by fusicoccin. The stimulation of H+ pumping by fusicoccin is dependent upon pH, fusicoccin, and protein concentration, as was reported for the system reconstituted with both proteins <b>from</b> <b>maize...</b>|$|R

40|$|Enzymatic {{hydrolysis}} {{of complex}} wastes {{is a critical}} step for efficient biogas production in anaerobic digesters. Inhibition of this hydrolytic step was studied by addition of humic acid-like (HAL) and fulvic acid-like (FAL) substances, extracted <b>from</b> <b>maize</b> silage and fresh cow manure, to batch tests with cellulose and cellulases from Aspergillus niger and tributyrin and lipases from Candida rugosa. To confirm the inhibition results, microbially catalysed hydrolysis trials were performed, where Fibrobacter succinogenes was grown exclusively on cellulose. Hydrolysis products, as glucose, glycerol and butyric acid, were measured to determine the hydrolysis efficiency and its rate. Cellulose hydrolysis was inhibited by 0. 5 to 5. 0 g l − 1 of HAL and FAL substances extracted <b>from</b> <b>maize</b> and cow manure, which are relevant concentrations for manure and maize digestion.
