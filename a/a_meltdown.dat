5|$|The Doctor lands the TARDIS in Cardiff, {{using the}} energy of the Cardiff Rift to {{recharge}} the engines. Rose has Mickey bring her passport to the TARDIS, and together with the Doctor and Jack Harkness, they go to lunch. At lunch, the Doctor spots a newspaper article showing Margaret Blaine, a Slitheen, has become Cardiff's new mayor. The four track down and capture Margaret to find out what she is doing there after their previous encounter (in Aliens of London). The Doctor observes Blaine's scale model plans for a new nuclear power plant, but identifies that it is purposely flawed to cause <b>a</b> <b>meltdown</b> that would open the Cardiff Rift and destroy the Earth. He also discovers the model contains a functioning tribophysical waveform macro-kinetic extrapolator that Margaret would have used to flee the Earth. The Doctor decides to take Margaret back to her home planet of Raxacoricofallapatorious, but she reveals that she has received a death sentence there and will be executed upon returning. The Doctor agrees to her final request to accompany her to a dinner meal. Margaret makes several half-hearted attempts to kill the Doctor but he easily avoids them. She then tries to play on the Doctor's sympathies, asking him to take her to another planet instead.|$|E
5|$|Max tracks down Stacey to a flat where Stacey {{explains}} {{that she was}} angry at Archie and was worried about what Bradley would do to him after he {{found out about the}} baby. A minute after Bradley confronted Archie, she found Archie on the floor and pushed the bust onto his head, but ran after his fingers twitched, fearing he would call the police. Max eventually tells Stacey that nobody else needs to know that she killed Archie and sends her home. Becca continues to live with Stacey, and tries to exclude Stacey's mother Jean Slater (Gillian Wright) from her life. However, when Jean reveals Becca's involvement in Bradley's death, Stacey slaps Becca, which causes her to have <b>a</b> <b>meltdown</b> leading to getting kicked out by Jean as Stacey tells her mother she can trust her again. Later, Stacey figures out that Ryan must be her baby's father but decides not to tell him so as to not complicate his rekindled relationship with Janine, even when he is with her in the hospital as she gives birth to her daughter Lily. Several months later, at Janine and Ryan's wedding reception, Stacey confesses her fear about Archie still being alive to Peggy, who tells Stacey that Archie is dead and that Bradley killed him, accidentally causing Stacey to confess the truth to her. Peggy wants to call the police but after a fire at The Queen Victoria, Peggy tries to convince Stacey to admit to arson as the sentence would be a lot less than that for murder. She leaves Walford while letting Stacey take care of Lily who needs her. Stacey also tells Ryan that he is Lily's father, and although he initially refuses to acknowledge her, he later bonds with her and gets used to the idea of being a father while Janine and Stacey are arrested on a night out. Upset with this, Janine attempts to sabotage his relationship with Stacey, but her actions inadvertently cause them to realise their growing attraction to each other.|$|E

25|$|A nuclear {{meltdown}} is {{a severe}} nuclear reactor accident {{that results in}} reactor core damage from overheating. It {{has been defined as}} the accidental melting of the core of a nuclear reactor, and refers to the core's either complete or partial collapse. A core melt accident occurs when the heat generated by a nuclear reactor exceeds the heat removed by the cooling systems to the point where at least one nuclear fuel element exceeds its melting point. This differs from a fuel element failure, which is not caused by high temperatures. <b>A</b> <b>meltdown</b> may be caused by a loss of coolant, loss of coolant pressure, or low coolant flow rate or be the result of a criticality excursion in which the reactor is operated at a power level that exceeds its design limits. Alternately, in a reactor plant such as the RBMK-1000, an external fire may endanger the core, leading to <b>a</b> <b>meltdown.</b>|$|E
25|$|Early on 13 March an {{official}} of the Japan Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency (NISA) told at a news conference that the emergency cooling system of Unit 3 had failed, spurring an urgent search for a means to supply cooling water to the reactor vessel to prevent <b>a</b> <b>meltdown</b> of its reactor core. At 05:38 there was no means of adding coolant to the reactor, owing to loss of power. Work to restore power and to vent excessive pressure continued. At one point, the top three meters of the uranium/mixed oxide (MOX) fuel rods were not covered by coolant.|$|E

25|$|While Hurricane Irma was {{bearing down}} on south Florida on September 8, 2017, an opinion piece in The New York Times {{observed}} that Turkey Point is vulnerable {{to the threat of}} a storm-caused nuclear meltdown. The Turkey Point nuclear power station sits on an exposed island in Biscayne Bay, about 25 miles south of Miami. Built in the early 1970s, the aging plant depends on similar vulnerable backup systems to prevent <b>a</b> <b>meltdown</b> as those of Japan’s Fukushima plant. Although Turkey Point’s main reactors are 20 feet above sea level, the plant’s diesel-powered backup generators, which keep cooling water circulating through the reactors when power is knocked out, are less elevated and less well insulated, according to Phil Stoddard, the mayor of South Miami.|$|E

25|$|On 12 May, TEPCO {{engineers}} {{confirmed that}} <b>a</b> <b>meltdown</b> occurred, with molten fuel having {{fallen to the}} bottom of the reactor's pressure vessel, or RPV. The utility said that fuel rods of the No. 1 reactor are fully exposed, with the water level 1meter (3.3feet) below the base of the fuel assembly. According to a Japanese press report, there are holes in the base of the pressure vessel – these holes were meant for the control-rods. After the fuel had melted, it produced holes in the bottom of the RPV, and then escaped into the containment vessel. In November 2011 TEPCO did not know the shape or porosity of the fuel mass, which is at the bottom of the containment vessel. As a result, it is impossible to know exactly how far the fuel mass would have eroded the concrete floor, but TEPCO estimate that no more than 70cm of a 7.6meter concrete slab was eroded away by the hot fuel. The production of heat and steam in unit 1 has decreased, as suggested by both radioactive decay calculations and photographic evidence (same source from TEPCO).|$|E
25|$|Radulovics {{has been}} capped seventy {{times for the}} Yugoslavian {{national}} team, when in 1999, after playing since many years in Hungary, she has obtained the Hungarian citizenship and decided to represent Hungary on international level. She made her debut on 25 July 2000 against France and participated on the Olympic Games yet in that year, winning the silver medal after falling short to Denmark in the final. In the quarterfinals against Austria her goal saved the match to a regular time draw, coming back from a four-goal deficit with only five minutes from time. In the overtime, the Hungarians finally won the match in an epic battle (28–27). The following day in the semifinals they overcame Norway surprisingly easily (28–23), just to face Denmark in the final. The Hungarian team shown an excellent display and had a comfortable advantage, but suffered <b>a</b> <b>meltdown</b> in the latest part of the match and gave away the title. However, despite lost in the final, Radulovics, who finished fourth on the top scorers' list with 55 goals, was selected to the All-Star team of the tournament. Moreover, she was given both the Hungarian Handballer of the Year and the IHF World Player of the Year award in acknowledgement of her outstanding performances throughout the year.|$|E

25|$|During <b>a</b> <b>meltdown,</b> the {{temperature}} of the fuel rods increases and they can deform, in the case of Zircaloy cladding, above 700–900°C (1,292-1,652 °F). If the reactor pressure is low, the pressure inside the fuel rods ruptures the control rod cladding. High-pressure conditions push the cladding onto the fuel pellets, promoting formation of uranium dioxide–zirconium eutectic with a melting point of 1200–1400°C (2,192-2,552 °F). An exothermic reaction occurs between steam and zirconium, which may produce enough heat to be self-sustaining without the contribution of decay heat from radioactivity. Hydrogen is released in an amount of about 0.5m3 (17.65 cu. ft.) of hydrogen (at normal temperature/pressure) per kilogram of zircaloy oxidized. Hydrogen embrittlement may also occur in the reactor materials and volatile fission products can be released from damaged fuel rods. Between 1300 and 1500°C (2,372-2,732 °F), the silver-indium-cadmium alloy of control rods melts, together with the evaporation of control rod cladding. At 1800°C (3,272 °F), the cladding oxides melt and begin to flow. At 2700–2800°C (4,892-5,072 °F) the uranium oxide fuel rods melt and the reactor core structure and geometry collapses. This can occur at lower temperatures if a eutectic uranium oxide-zirconium composition is formed. At that point, the corium is virtually free of volatile constituents that are not chemically bound, resulting in correspondingly lower heat production (by about 25%) as the volatile isotopes relocate.|$|E
25|$|Reactor R2 went {{critical}} in 1960. In 1963, FOA halted criticality experiments, and by July 1972, even theoretical research using its acquired plutonium was shut down. Earlier, {{primarily due to}} cost, Sweden opted to use U.S.-designed light water reactors using imported enriched uranium in lieu of heavy water reactors operating on indigenous uranium. Also, the Swedish supreme commander announced that the country abandoned the nuclear option in 1965. Another key event was an electrical problem at the Ågesta that jeopardized the reactor’s cooling system. Although <b>a</b> <b>meltdown</b> was averted, the Swedish government was informed. The public, however, was {{kept in the dark}} until 1993, as the government was afraid that such a disclosure would endanger public support for nuclear energy. The year 1974 also marked the final disassembly of all plutonium facilities and a reorganization of FOA that dispersed its nuclear expertise. The Ågesta reactor was permanently shut down. Vattenfall, the contractor responsible for the Marviken reactor, became increasingly skeptical of the project’s chances for success. Two key areas were mentioned: the idea of using superheated water and the reshuffling machine. Additionally, it became apparent that the plant would not satisfy the safety standards established by the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission in the late 1960s. By 1969, the plans to build a superheated reactor were scrapped.|$|E
