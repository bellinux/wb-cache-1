Then, the bacterial population in the hypocotyls were monitored with past the days. As a result, bacterial population in each iron compound solution-treted hypocotyls at 3 to 5 days after inocuiation were commonly lower then those of water treated control plants. 　On the other hand, change in peroxidase (POX) and lipoxygenase (LOX) activities which were related to resistant reactions on host-parasite interaction in tomato hypocotyls was measured. POX activity was commonly enhanced in all the hypocotyls at 1 day after iron compounds treatmant, and then the enzyme activity was increased for 2 or 3 days, although there was a decrease of the enzyme activity at 3 or 4 days after the treatmant, cnotemporarily, however, re-increased. The LOX highest activity was found at the time just after treatmant. Although the enzyme activity of control tomato pints teated with tap water rapidly decreased as the day pass, those of tomato pre-treated with eath iron compound did not decrease and conversely maintained stable activities. It is well knwon that POX sctivity is related to the oxidation of phenol compounds or lignifications of plants. On the other hands, LOX was the enzyme that produced the hydroperoxieds of saturated fatty scids with anti-bacterial activity, It is suggested that the enhancement of both enzymes activities at just after the treatment of iron compounds were related to suppress the proliferations of pathogenic bacterium in the vascular bundle of hypocotyl tissues. 　Keywards: Iron compounds, Supperssion of bacterial wilt of tomato, Peroxidase, Lipoxygenase...|$|R

40|$|Large-scale {{production}} of biopharmaceuticals commonly requires {{the use of}} serum-free medium, for safety and cost reasons. However, serum is essential to most mammalian cells growth, and its removal implies a very time-consuming process for cell adaptation. Thus, the aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate different strategies for cell adaptation to serum-free medium. Three cell types were used to assess the impact of transfection on adaptation: one common CHO-K 1 cell line and two CHO-K 1 cells transfected with different technologies for antibody production. Cultures were started with a known cell concentration in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium supplemented with 10 % serum. The effect of five combinations of supplements, that could support cells during adaptation, was tested. These supplements included insulin and trace elements (copper sulfate, zinc sulfate, sodium selenite, <b>ammonium</b> <b>iron</b> citrate, ferrous <b>ammonium</b> sulfate, ammonium metavanadate, nickel chloride and stannous chloride). A methodology of gradual adaptation was followed, consisting on sequential steps of serum reduction, after assuring good cell adaptation from the previous step. After reaching 0. 625 % serum, medium was gradually switched to the chemically defined serum-free EX-CELL CHO DHFR- medium. It was observed that supplements influence cell adaptation to serum-free medium. Indeed, the combinations containing the trace element <b>ammonium</b> <b>iron</b> citrate gave the worst results, with cell death at 2. 5 % serum. In contrast, the combination of ammonium metavanadate, nickel chloride and stannous chloride proved to be the most favorable to the three cell lines. Comparing the cells, it seems that the ability to produce antibody and the transfection methodology used does not have a great impact on adaptation. During the study, some procedure details were identified as particularly important and should be carefully considered in the process of cell adaptation to serum-free medium. These include the use of a higher initial cell concentration that will allow the survival of an increased number of cells during the process; avoiding harsh procedures to the cells such as centrifugation and the use of enzymes (i. e. trypsin), due to a higher cell sensibility during adaptation; and to give enough time for a full cell adaptation at each step...|$|R

It is landscape photography that frames and constructs our view - or our projection - of nature.

Our perception of non-human nature is filtered through photographic representations that reinforce this primacy of human agency. Could a new vision of "landscape" emerge from photography if it is thought of as a material - as matter - rather than a representational medium and a discipline?

Additional components extracted by PCA include "calcite dissolution " (18 % of variance explained) and "phosphate dissolution" (9 % of variance explained). Reducing conditions in ground waters of the region influence nitrate behavior through bacterially mediated reduction in the presence of organic matter, and by inhibition of nitrate formation in anoxic ground water beneath forested areas.

More probably, the original salt mixture consisted mostly of simple sulfate salts that generated double salts thereafter, during the crystallization process. The chemical composition of the efflorescence suggests that the impregnation mixture had the following composition (inferred content is given in mass % for each salt): ammonium sulfate ((NH 4) 2 SO 4; 30), aluminium sulfate (Al 2 (SO 4) 3 · 18 H 2 O; 15), magnesium sulfate (MgSO 4 · 7 H 2 O; 15), iron(II) sulfate (FeSO 4 · 7 H 2 O; 15), zinc sulfate (ZnSO 4 · 7 H 2 O; 10), sodium sulfate (Na 2 SO 4 · 10 H 2 O; 10), and potassium alum (KAl(SO 4) 2 · 12 H 2 O; 5). When such a mixture is dissolved, the large content of ammonium ion renders the solution slightly acidic, thus preventing oxidation of iron (II) [36] as well as the hydrolysis of aluminium and other hydrated cations.

The size and density of clusters produced in the MACS with different experimental parameters are characterised by STEM High-Angle Annular Dark Field (HAADF) imaging, shedding light on the capabilities of this new cluster source. A statistical investigation is conducted into the size and atomic structure of nominally Au 144 (SR) 60 clusters synthesised by two different research groups. The clusters are “weighed” against size-selected clusters (i. e. atom counting) and the structures are compared to several model structure simulations. A ring-dot feature, characteristic of a local icosahedral order, is frequently observed. The oxidation states of CeOx, CuOx, CoOx and FeOx nanoparticles are investigated by Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (EELS) in the STEM. All these samples show a mixing oxidation states.

A structural phase transition in the pressure range of 0. 4 – 1. 4 GPa, depending on the metal cation, is observed for all three ammonium metal formates. The hexagonal to monoclinic high-pressure transition {{gives rise to a}} characteristic sixfold twinning for the single-crystal diffraction data. Structure solution of the single-crystal data and refinement of the neutron powder diffraction characterise the pressureinduced distortions of the metal formate frameworks. The pressure dependence of the principal axes show significantly larger anisotropic compressibilities in the high-pressure monoclinic phase (K 1 = 48 TPa^- 1, K 3 = - 7 TPa^- 1) compared to the ambient hexagonal phase (K 1 = 16 TPa^- 1, K 3 = - 2 TPa^- 1), and can be related to the symmetry-breaking distortions that cause deformation of the honeycomb motifs in the metal formate framework. While high-pressure Raman spectroscopy suggest that the ammonium cations remain dynamically disordered upon the phase transition, the pressure-induced distortion in the metal formate framework cause polar displacements in the ammonium cations. The magnitude of polarisation in the high-pressure phase of ammonium zinc formate was calculated based upon the offset of the ammonium cation relative to the anionic zinc formate framework and showed an enhanced polarisation of Ps ~ 4 μ C cm^- 2 at the transition, which then decreases with increasing pressure...|$|R

Erastin treatment at low doses (0. 5 and 1 M) was already sufficient for inhibiting cell proliferation and triggering cell death independent from caspase- 3 cleavage, as observed during a time-course of 48 hours by means of Crystal Violet, Neutral Red and Immunoblotting assays. Co-treatment of the cell lines with erastin and increasing doses of <b>ammonium</b> <b>iron</b> citrate was able to increase the ferroptotic-cell death, while co-treatment with the iron chelator deferoxamine completely prevented the cell-death induced by erastin. In addition, actively proliferating human RMS cell lines treated with erastin showed a marked production of intracellular ROS species, as evaluated by means of fluorescent cytosolic, mitochondrial and nuclear probes. Remarkably, unlike observed during cell proliferation, the erastin treatment of differentiated RMS cells did not produce any considerable effect on the cell viability, suggesting that the effects of erastin are strictly cell-cycle-dependent. On the whole, these preliminary data suggest that targeting iron metabolism may represent an important avenue to counteract the tumor progression in RMS...|$|R

One such was the discovery, first recorded in 1784, of iron cement made from sal ammoniac, or <b>ammonium</b> chloride and <b>iron</b> filings, apparently discovered when Murdoch observed that these two components had accidentally mixed in his tool bag and formed a solid mass. This iron cement was used to fix and harden the joints of steam engines, thus creating a hard durable seal.|$|R

40|$|Background and Objective: Microbial protein {{production}} {{can resolve}} {{one of the}} major world challenges, i. e. lack of protein sources. Candida tropicalis growth was investigated to specify a medium to reach the highest cell proliferation and protein production. Material and Methods: Fractional factorial design and the index of signal to noise ratio were applied for optimization of microbial protein production. Optimization process was conducted based on the experimental results of Taguchi approach designs. Fermentation was performed at 25 oC and the agitation speed of 300 rpm for 70 h. <b>Ammonium</b> sulfate, <b>iron</b> sulfate, glycine and glucose concentrations were considered as process variables. Optimization of the culture medium composition was conducted in order to obtain the highest cell biomass concentration and protein content. Experiment design was performed based on the Taguchi approach and L- 16 orthogonal arrays using Qualitek- 4 software. Results and Conclusion: Maximum biomass of 8. 72 log (CFU ml- 1) was obtained using the optimized medium with 0. 3, 0. 15, 2 and 80 g l- 1 of <b>ammonium</b> sulfate, <b>iron</b> sulfate, glycine and glucose, respectively. <b>Iron</b> sulfate and <b>ammonium</b> sulfate with 41. 76 % (w w- 1) and 35. 27 % (w w- 1) contributions, respectively, were recognized as the main components for cell growth. Glucose and glycine with 17. 12 % and 5. 86 % (w w- 1) contributions, respectively, also affected cell production. The highest interaction severity index of + 54. 16 % was observed between glycine and glucose while the least one of + 0. 43 % was recorded for ammonium sulfate and glycine. A deviation of 7 % between the highest predicted cell numbers and the experimented count confirms the suitability of the applied statistical method. High protein content of 52. 16 % (w w- 1) as well as low fat and nucleic acids content suggest that Candida tropicalis is a suitable case for commercial processes.

The isolated complexes {{were characterized by}} elemental analyses, IR spectra, and H- 1 NMR and C- 13 NMR spectra. The formation of titanium(IV) citrate complexes depends mainly on the pH of the solutions, that is, pH 1. 0 - 2. 8 {{for the formation of}} ammonium titanium(IV) citrate 1, pH 2. 5 - 3. 5 for <b>ammonium</b> <b>iron</b> titanium(IV) citrate 2, pH 2. 8 - 4. 0 for dibarium titanium(IV) citrate 3, and pH 5. 0 - 6. 0 for ammonium barium titanium(IV) citrate 4. X-ray structural analyses revealed that complexes 2 - 4 featured three different protonated forms of bidentate citrate anions that chelate to the titanium(IV) atom through their negatively charged alpha-alkoxyl and alpha-carboxyl oxygen atoms. This is consistent with the large downfield shifts of the C- 13 NMR spectra for the carbon atoms bearing the alpha-alkoxyl and alpha-carboxyl groups. The typical coordination modes of the barium atoms in complexes 3 and 4 are six-coordinated, with three alpha-alkoxyl groups and three beta-carboxyl groups of citrate ions. The strong hydrogen bonding between the beta-carboxylic acid and the beta-carboxyl groups [2. 634 (8) Angstrom for complex 2, 2. 464 (7) Angstrom for complex 3, and 2. 467 (7) Angstrom for complex 4] may be the key factor for the stabilization of the citrate complexes. The decomposition of complex 3 results in the formation of a pure dibarium titanate phase and 4 for the mixed phases of dibarium titanate and barium titanate at 1000 degreesC...|$|R
40|$|Since {{many years}} {{regional}} and national crystal growing competitions are successfully organized for pupils {{in countries such as}} Australia, Belgium, Canada, England, France and Singapore, and for sure in many schools on a more local basis. For most competitions pupils have to grow single crystals in the class room during a limited period of time (e. g. four weeks) of a limited amount of starting material provided by the organizers. Submitted single crystals are then judged by a jury based on the weight {{and the quality of the}} crystal. Typical compounds used as starting materials for such competitions are alum (aluminium potassium sulphate dodecahydrate), copper (II) sulphate pentahydrate, borax (sodium tetraborate decahydrate), <b>ammonium</b> <b>iron</b> (II) sulphate hexahydrate, potassium dihydrogen phosphate and ammonium magnesium sulphate hexahydrate. To celebrate the International Year of Crystallography a small IUCr working group of coordinators of current crystal growing competitions took the initiative to stimulate as many countries as possible to organize a regional or national crystal growing competition. To facilitate this, the IUCr offers all possible support for newcomers in the form of a time line, protocols and suggestions for judging and prize awarding. This information is available on the IYCr website www. iycr 2014. org/participate/crystal-growing-competition, together with a brand new animated video 'How to grow a single crystal - with Johanna' illustrating the protocol. With the celebrations of the International Year of Crystallography in mind the lead partners IUCr and UNESCO organize also a world-wide crystal growing competition. The aim of this competition is that participants grow their own crystals (whether involved in a regional/national competition or not) and convey their experience through a short video or essay. A panel of judges will evaluate the entries using criteria such as creativity, esthetic value, description of working plan and experimental work, clarity of explanations and scientific background. For countries were no crystallographers can take the lead to initiate a competition in 2014 the network of UNESCO schools will be used, an initiative which will start in September 2014. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The article {{deals with}} {{chemical}} and isotopic properties of Borovnica alluvial fan groundwater. Increased concentrations of <b>ammonium</b> and <b>iron</b> were detected in well VB- 3 of the Borovnica alluvial fan pumping station. On {{the basis of}} analyses it was found out that increased concentrations of both elements {{are linked to the}} hydrogeological conditions in the aquifer area. In {{the upper part of the}} Borovnica alluvial fan aquifer, layers of clay prevent the access of oxygen to groundwater. This fact, together with the presence of organic matter in the aquifer, creates reduction conditions causing the mobility of iron and manganese in groundwater and the transformation of nitrogen from nitrate into ammonium form. Water from the lower aquifer contains more dissolved oxygen, and on the basis of tritium presence it can be concluded that the water is old up to 50 years. Wells VB- 5 and VB- 6 capture water from the lower pleistocene aquifer, while well VB- 3 recharges also with water from the upper holocene aquifer...|$|R
