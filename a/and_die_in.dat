5|$|As a youth, John de la Pole married twice; {{his first}} {{marriage}} was annulled, but his second marriage, to Elizabeth of York, made him the brother-in-law of two kings, Edward IV and Richard III. It brought him eleven children, the eldest of whom, John, would eventually be named heir to Richard III in 1484 <b>and</b> <b>die</b> <b>in</b> battle in the Yorkist cause. John de la Pole, though, generally managed {{to steer clear of}} involvement in the tumultuous events of the Wars of the Roses. Although he was politically aligned to the House of York, by virtue of his marriage, he avoided participating in the battles of the 1450s, not taking up arms until Edward IV had claimed the throne. De la Pole appears to have spent much of this period, in fact, feuding with his East Anglian neighbours, the Paston family over an inheritance—even interfering in parliamentary elections, for example, in attempt to gain the upper hand.|$|E
5|$|Composer Tyler Bates began scoring Watchmen in November 2007. He {{planned to}} visit the shoot for a week during each month, and view {{assembly}} cuts of scenes to begin rough composing. Snyder and Bates listened to the soundtracks of 1980s films such as Manhunter, Blade Runner, and To Live <b>and</b> <b>Die</b> <b>in</b> L.A. for inspiration. Bates switched between a Yamaha CS-80 or an MOTM for moments that he felt should have more ambience or synthesizers. Snyder wanted a scene where Nite Owl and Silk Spectre rescue people from a burning building {{to have a more}} traditional superhero feel, so Bates implemented a four to the floor guitar rhythm. A 64-strong choir and the 87-piece ensemble from the Hollywood Studio Symphony were hired for the more orchestral themes.|$|E

5|$|Drive {{has been}} called a tough, hard-edged, neo-noir, art house feature, {{extremely}} violent and very stylish, with European art and grindhouse influences. According to Refn, Drive turns into a superhero film during the elevator scene when The Driver kills the villain. Drive also references 1970s and 1980s cult hits such as The Day of the Locust (1975) and To Live <b>and</b> <b>Die</b> <b>in</b> L.A. (1985). Other influences {{can be seen in the}} neon-bright opening credits and the retro song picks"a mix of tension-ratcheting synthesizer tones and catchy club anthems that collectively give the film its consistent tone". Drives title sequence is hot-pink, which was inspired by Risky Business (1983). Refn has also indicated that the film's romance was partly inspired by the films of writer-director John Hughes.|$|E
5|$|Plants {{and animals}} {{living in the}} desert need special adaptations {{to survive in the}} harsh environment. Plants tend to be tough and wiry with small or no leaves, {{water-resistant}} cuticles and often spines to deter herbivory. Some annual plants germinate, bloom <b>and</b> <b>die</b> <b>in</b> the course of a few weeks after rainfall while other long-lived plants survive for years and have deep root systems able to tap underground moisture. Animals need to keep cool and find enough food and water to survive. Many are nocturnal and stay in the shade or underground during the heat of the day. They tend to be efficient at conserving water, extracting most of their needs from their food and concentrating their urine. Some animals remain in a state of dormancy for long periods, ready to become active again when the rare rains fall. They then reproduce rapidly while conditions are favorable before returning to dormancy.|$|E
