This is an accepted alternative to the EUR.1 only if the amount of items with EU preferential origin under a single shipment does not exceed at certain amount (for a non-approved exporter). If it concerns an <b>approved</b> <b>exporter</b> (that is, a regular authorized exporter), this value limit does not apply.|$|E

Despite {{the reluctance of}} their consumers, large western importers of maize, canola and soybeans, like Japan or the European Union have approved the imports {{of a number of}} key GM products. But with the acceleration in the release of new GM crop varieties in major commodity exporters (like the United States, Argentina, or Brazil), these and other importers are becoming concerned with delayed import authorizations and the increasing risk of temporary trade disruptions due to the adventitious presence of unapproved GM products conflicting with their zero percent tolerance for unapproved GM products. The consequence of such disruption is higher prices: importers either have to switch to less efficient GM suppliers or to non-GM suppliers to respond to their needs. To address this issue, members of the Codex Alimentarius have recently adopted a guideline (“the Codex Annex”) which proposes the use of a simplified risk assessment procedure for GM products <b>approved</b> at <b>exporters</b> but not yet at importers and potentially present in low levels in commodity shipments. However, this guideline does not specify what level of tolerance countries should apply and which products it should cover. In this paper, we model the economic effects of different implementatio...|$|R
