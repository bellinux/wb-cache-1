Due to being an only child <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>having</b> a large family, she decides to spend Christmas with her sorority sisters. Unfortunately, their sorority house was once the childhood home of notorious murderer Billy Lenz. During Christmas, Kelli and her sisters begin getting obscene phone calls. Realizing that Billy has returned home, the girls attempt to survive the night as, due to a snowstorm, help is unable to reach them.|$|E
5|$|She has {{established}} {{herself as a}} major young talent in French cinema. In a 2009 interview, Laurent explained {{that she does not}} have ambitions to be a crossover actress. She stated that she loved France, her street, her café, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>having</b> to use a car. Rather than go on to work on a big budget American film after Inglourious Basterds, her next role was in a small theater piece in France.|$|E

We went downtown to the abandoned Sears building; it’s all destroyed and creepy in there. We were there for two days and it was like an art project.|$|E
5|$|In Cairo, {{the senior}} Mamluk emirs {{resolved}} to depose an-Nasir Ahmad and replace {{him with his}} half-brother as-Salih Isma'il in June 1342. The decision {{was supported by the}} governors of the Syrian provinces, who defected from an-Nasir Ahmad after learning of the executions of Tashtamur and Qutlubugha and reports of an-Nasir Ahmad's decadent behavior in al-Karak. Despite being dethroned <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>having</b> apparent ambitions outside of al-Karak, an-Nasir Ahmad was still viewed as a threat by the sultan; an-Nasir Muhammad had been exiled in al-Karak when he marched to Cairo and seized the throne. Seven expeditions against an-Nasir Ahmad were launched between his deposition and 1344. Each siege was aborted. They often lasted for a few months, cost huge sums, and at times, ended with the dismissal of officers. The Mamluks had difficulty gaining the key support of the local Bedouin tribes, who were allies of an-Nasir Ahmad.|$|E
5|$|In 189 BC, {{the hostages}} taken by Rome, {{excluding}} Nabis' son, who fell ill and died, {{were allowed to}} return to Sparta. Still deprived of any port and suffering from political and economic problems from having the hostile exiles close by <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>having</b> access to the sea, the Spartans captured the city of Las, which was the home of many exiles {{and a member of the}} Union of free Laconians. The Acheans officially adopted this as the reason to finish Spartan independence once and for all. They demanded the surrender of the people responsible for the attack. The culprits responded by murdering thirty pro-Achaean citizens, seceding from the League and requesting Roman tutelage. The Romans, who wanted to see division in the League, did nothing about the situation. In 188, Philopoemen entered northern Laconia with an army and the Spartan exiles who insisted on returning to Sparta. He first massacred eighty anti-Achaeans at Compasium, and then had the wall that Nabis built around Sparta demolished. Philopoemen then restored the exiles and abolished Spartan law, introducing Achaean law in its place. Thus ended Sparta's role as a major power in Greece, while Achaea became dominant throughout the Peloponnese.|$|E

5|$|West and Cooke settled their differences—and {{the former}} Laker's lawsuit—and Cooke {{hired him to}} replace Sharman as the team's coach. West became upset, however, when Cooke refused {{to spend the money}} {{necessary}} to acquire forward Julius Erving, who the Nets were selling. Behind another MVP season from Abdul-Jabbar, Los Angeles won the Pacific Division, finishing the 1976–77 season a league-best 53–29. They defeated the Warriors in a seven-game series to open the postseason before being swept by Portland in the Western Conference Finals. During the offseason, Los Angeles picked up Jamaal Wilkes from Golden State and signed first-round draft pick Norm Nixon. In the first two minutes of {{the first game of the}} 1977–78 season, Abdul-Jabbar punched Bucks center Kent Benson for an overly aggressive elbow and broke his hand. Two months later, a healthy Abdul-Jabbar got into an altercation with Houston Rockets center Kevin Kunnert after a rebound. The team's starting power forward, Kermit Washington, who was averaging 11.5 points and 11.2 rebounds, entered the fight, and when Rudy Tomjanovich ran in from the bench to break up the action, Washington punched him in the face. Tomjanovich nearly died from the punch, suffering a fractured skull and other facial injuries which prematurely ended his playing career. Washington, who stated that he assumed Tomjanovich was a combatant, was suspended for two months by the NBA, and released by the Lakers. The team won 45 games despite being down a starter in Washington <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>having</b> Abdul-Jabbar for nearly two months, but lost in the first round of the playoffs to Seattle. During the 1978–79 season, the team posted a 47–35 record but lost to the SuperSonics in the semifinal round of the playoffs.|$|E

This was done by damaging the propellers and making the boat hit the rocks. The eight men of the Siriuss crew avoided being captured by the Indian forces, and boarded a Greek freighter on which they reached Pakistan.|$|E

In 1943 Weekes enlisted in the Barbados Regiment {{and served as a}} Lance-Corporal until his discharge in 1947 and while he never saw active service, the fact he was in the military meant he was eligible to play cricket for Garrison Sports Club in the higher standard Barbados Cricket Association in addition to Westshire in the BCL.|$|E

He considered demoting Cen Wenzhao out of the capital, but Cen Wenben interceded on his brother's behalf, stating that his mother favored Cen Wenzhao the most, <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>having</b> his brother around would cause his mother much distress. Emperor Taizong thus changed his mind, keeping Cen Wenzhao in the capital after summoning him and rebuking him.|$|E
25|$|When World War II {{broke out}} in 1939, Roosevelt could not support the United Kingdom directly, as in 1935 the Shipping Neutrality Act was signed to prevent Mussolini from invading Ethiopia. A {{solution}} was found by flagging out to Panama, which was under US control. The advantage for shipping companies was not having to comply with US regulations <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>having</b> to sail with US crew which were 50 percent more expensive than European crews at that time. In 1939 there were 52 tankers with a total capacity of 700,000 long tons of deadweight under Panamanian flag, a boost for flags of convenience.|$|E
