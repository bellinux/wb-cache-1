The high resolution and sensitivity accessible with W-band EPR allowed us to determine accurately the axial zero-field splitting terms for the ground (S = 6) and first two excited states (S = 5 and S = 4).

40|$|We {{develop a}} maximum {{likelihood}} based method of reconstructing band {{powers of the}} density and velocity power spectra at each wavenumber bins from the measured clustering features of galaxies in redshift space, including marginalization over uncertainties inherent in the Fingers-of-God (FoG) effect. The reconstruction can be done assuming that the density and velocity power spectra depend on the redshift-space power spectrum having different <b>angular</b> <b>modulations</b> of mu with mu^{ 2 n} (n= 0, 1, 2) and that the model FoG effect is given as a multiplicative function in the redshift-space spectrum. By using N-body simulations and the halo catalogs, we test our method by comparing the reconstructed power spectra with the simulations. For the spectrum of mu^ 0 or equivalently the density power spectrum P_dd(k), our method recovers the amplitudes to a few percent accuracies up to k= 0. 3 h/Mpc for both dark matter and halos. For the power spectrum of mu^ 2, which {{is equivalent to the}} density-velocity spectrum P_dv(k) in the linear regime, our method can recover the input power spectrum for dark matter up to k= 0. 2 h/Mpc and at both z= 0 and 1, if using the adequate FoG model. However, for the halo spectrum, the reconstructed spectrum shows greater amplitudes than the simulation P_dv(k). We argue that the disagreement is ascribed to nonlinearity effect that arises from the cross-bispectra of density and velocity perturbations. Using the perturbation theory, we derive the nonlinear correction term, and find that the leading-order correction term is proportional to mu^ 2 and increases the mu^ 2 -power spectrum amplitudes at larger k, at lower redshifts and for more massive halos. We find that adding the nonlinearity correction term to the simulation P_dv(k) can fairly well reproduce the reconstructed P_dv(k) for halos up to k~ 0. 2 h/Mpc.

40|$|The {{subject of}} quark {{transverse}} spin and transverse momentum distribution are two current research frontier {{in understanding the}} spin structure of the nucleons. The goal of the research reported in this dissertation is to extract new information on the quark transversity distribution and the novel transverse-momentum-dependent Sivers function in the neutron. A semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering experiment was performed at the Hall A of the Jefferson laboratory using 5. 9 GeV electron beam and a transversely polarized ^ 3 He target. The scattered electrons and the produced hadrons (pions, kaons, and protons) were detected in coincidence with two large magnetic spectrometers. By regularly flipping the spin direction of the transversely polarized target, the single-spin-asymmetry (SSA) of the semi-inclusive deep inelastic reaction ^ 3 He^uparrow(e,e'h^±) X was measured over the kinematic range 0. 13 < x < 0. 41 and 1. 3 < Q^ 2 < 3. 1 (GeV) ^ 2.

The latter is quantized in de Sitter space-time and {{it is found that}} in general the particle production process of the vector field is anisotropic. This anisotropy is parametrized by introducing two parameters p and q, which are determined by the conformal invariance breaking mechanism. If any of them are non-zero, generated ζ is statistically anisotropic. Then the power spectrum of ζ and the non-linearity parameter fNL have an <b>angular</b> <b>modulation.</b> This formalism is applied for two vector curvaton models and the end-of-inflation scenario. It is found that for p 0, the magnitude of fNL and the direction of its <b>angular</b> <b>modulation</b> is correlated with the anisotropy in the spectrum. If p ≳ 1, the anisotropic part of fNL is dominant over the isotropic one. These are distinct observational signatures; their detection would be a smoking gun for a vector field contribution to ζ.

In the former, only statistically anisotropic ζ can be generated, while in the latter, isotropic ζ may be realized too. Parameter spaces for these vector curvaton scenarios are large enough for them to be realized in the particle physics models.

40|$|The spin {{structure}} of the nucleon has been studied at the COMPASS experiment at CERN. The Semi-Inclusive Deep Inelastic Scattering (SIDIS) measurements are a powerful tool to access the Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs) and the Transverse Momentum Dependent Parton Distribution Functions (TMD PDFs). The COMPASS polarised target gives the opportunity to measure the azimuthal modulations depending on the spin orientation and the extraction of the transverse spin asymmetries, which are convolutions of TMD PDFs of the nucleon and Fragmentation Functions (FF). The analysis of these data is done in several kinematic bins, which provides a vast input for the theoreticians to extract the TMDs and the FFs and their kinematic dependence. The TMD PDFs are also accessible through the measurement of the Drell-Yan process, {{in this case the}} transverse spin asymmetries are convolutions of two TMD PDFs, one corresponding to the annihilating quark from the beam hadron and the other to the annihilating quark from the target hadron. In COMPASS a negative pion beam and the polarised protons from ammonia target allow the measurement of the polarised DY process. In 2010 the COMPASS data taking was dedicated to the measurement of the SIDIS process, the naturally polarised positive muons scattering off a transversely polarised proton target. The detection of the scattering muon and the final state hadrons give access to the <b>angular</b> <b>modulations.</b> The three target cells are transversely polarised, the two outer ones oppositely to the inner one, and this configuration changes every two weeks. The events are combined between the two sub-periods with opposite polarisation, which allows to better control possible systematic effects. The analysis of these data in bins of Q^ 2, x, pT h, z, y and W is presented. The 2015 COMPASS data taking was dedicated to the polarised DY measurement. As the COMPASS experiment was designed and developed for DIS and spectroscopy measurements, it had to suffer modifications for the DY measurement. The DY process has a very low cross-section, thus a high intensity beam is mandatory. A hadron absorber has been added just downstream of the target to stop the secondary hadrons allowing only the passage of the muon pairs. This protects the detectors from possible radiation damage while keeping the combinatorial background at a reasonable level. A short DY beam test run, using a hadron absorber prototype, was performed in 2009. The analysis of these data is presented in this thesis. The 2015 DY run was preceded by a pilot run in 2014, with the majority of the 2015 setup already set up, but still with no target polarisation. The analysis of these data is also presented in this thesis, as well as the analysis of some preliminary reconstructed 2015 data. COMPASS has the opportunity to access the TMD PDFs from two independent processes and selecting the same phase space coverage. These results are very promising for the TMD PDFs community, since the theoretical prediction that the Sivers TMD must change sign when accessed through the DY or the SIDIS processes should be verified with these data...|$|R

Using the same Fourier cascade ﬁltering we compared these temperature oscillations to the periodicities that characterize the motion of the Sun about the barycenter of the solar system in the 1850 - 2015 period. The 60 -year temperature modulation appears phase correlated with the equivalent harmonic components of solar velocity and angular momentum though with a time delay of about 10 years. Maxima of the 60 -year modulation of the temperature record occur in 1880, 1940 and 2000. Except the ﬁrst peak (where data are uncertain) all the temperature peaks of the 20 year component correspond to maxima of the solar velocity and <b>angular</b> momentum <b>modulations</b> thus indicating good phase correlations. The 60 year temperature modulation is quite larger than the 20 year one, whereas the 20 year harmonic velocity and angular momentum components of the solar motion are much larger than those of 60 year: this suggests that if the found spectral coherence is physical, alternative mechanisms of gravitational or electromagnetic origin may be involved in the process. We conjecture that the global temperature is partially modulated by astronomical harmonics that may also inﬂuence solar activity. The period from 2000 to 2030 should be characterized by a descending phase of the 60 -year temperature oscillation that could imply a synchronized cooling phase of the sun indicating that solar activity is approaching a hybernation stage that could last a few decades.

30|$|On modern {{scanners}} with adaptive {{tube current}} modulation, the patient dose is largely {{determined by the}} selection of a desired image quality and the tube current is modulated to achieve this. The main manufacturers employ similar methods to achieve this but use different terminology for this (Smart mA, GE; Z-DOM, Philips; CareDose 4 D, Siemens; Sure Exposure, Toshiba). The tube current is adjusted according to the patient’s size and attenuation along the z-axis (longitudinal tube current modulation) and also during the rotation in the xy-axis (<b>angular</b> tube current <b>modulation)</b> depending on the patient attenuation [1]. The user chooses a desired image quality directly (Philips, Siemens, Toshiba) or determines a desired noise level (GE, Toshiba). The automatic exposure control (AEC) of the CT then adjusts the necessary tube current. The scout view gives an indication of the patient attenuation and, while planning the examination on the scout view, the system is able to calculate the patient dose for the diagnostic scan. The system indicates the CTDIvol (CT dose index per volume) and the DLP (dose length product) prior to the exam. These are generic markers of the incurred dose and indicate the physical radiation dose to the patient. The conversion into an effective dose, simplified the biological impact, is not straightforward and depends on the age, anatomy and sex of the patient. The younger the patient the more radiosensitive, and tissues with high metabolic and proliferative activity are more radiosensitive than those with low activity. Glandular and gonadal tissue and red marrow are highly radiosensitive, leading to a relatively high effective dose for radiation to the neck and trunk, while extremities are less radiosensitive resulting in low effective doses [2 – 6].|$|R
40|$|Free-space optical (FSO) {{communications}} is a {{means of}} secure, high bandwidth communication {{through the use of a}} modulated laser beam in free-space as the information medium. The chaotic nature of the atmosphere and the motion of the communication nodes make laser alignment a crucial concern. The employment of retro-reflecting modulators makes the bidirectional quality of a communication link into a one sided alignment problem. While there are existing retro-reflecting modulators, their trade-offs create a lack of abilities (such as aperture size, <b>angular</b> range, high <b>modulation</b> speeds, economic viability) which do not fulfill the requirements for certain applications. Also, the beam must be directed towards the intended receiver. Form mobile or scintillated communication links, beam direction must be adaptable in real time. Once again, this area suffers from trade-offs where beamsteering speed is often limited. Research used to mitigate the trade-offs and adapt the devices into viable options for a wider range of applications is explored in this dissertation. Two forms of retro- modulators were explored; a MEMS deformable mirror retro- modulator and a solid silicon retro-modulator that modulated the light by frustrated total internal reflection (FTIR). The MEMS version offered a high speed, scalable, wavelength/angle insensitive retro-modulator which can be massed produced at low cost, while the solid retro-modulator offered a large field of view with low cost as well. Both modulator's design, simulated performances, fabrication and experimental characterization are described in this dissertation. An ultra-fast beamscanner was also designed using 2 - dimensional dispersion. By using wavelength switching for directional control, a beamscanner was developed that could switch light faster than pre-existing beamscanners while the beams characteristics (most importantly its aperture) could be freely adjusted by the independent optics. This beamscanner was preceded by our work on a large channel wavelength demultiplexer which combined two orthogonally oriented wavelength demultiplexers. This created a 2 -dimensional array of spots in free-space. The light was directed be a collimating lens into a specific direction based on its wavelength. The performance of this beamscanner was simulated by modeling the dispersive properties of the components...|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} the main user needs collected {{to carry out}} the I 2 C project responding to FP 7 call That was issued in September 2008 for the topic: Sea Border Surveillance System. I 2 C project aims at setting-up a maritime surveillance system {{in the form of a}} test platform located at one specific location. This study will allow to: - test ways of data integration from a set of sensors and other available intelligent information in order to obtain optimal maritime security awareness; - Develop new algorithms and procedures for processing, using and fusing the data, from the detection up to the understanding of suspicious event and early identification of associated threats; - Discuss about the added value of the various individual sensor types. With this integrated platform, in the future, scaling studies / designs can be made that propose the composition of maritime surveillance systems at specific locations, so authorities can commission these kinds of studies based on the I 2 C project results. More specific goals of the project are to improve: - The monitoring of vessel movements (including non cooperative vessels) on the European sea border. This requirement imposes the deployment of additional sensors/ platforms and integrating sensor data into a common situational traffic picture; - Detection, tracking and identity/activity confirmation of cooperative vessels. - Non-cooperative vessel tracking and classification; (The last two points request to enrich the common traffic picture with intelligent information to generate a 'common intelligent situational traffic picture') - Detection of small vessels - This point requests specific sensor with small <b>angular</b> resolution (frequency <b>modulation</b> continuous wave radar would be one candidate). - Detection of suspicious behaviour (e. g. deviations from expected routes); - Understanding of intentions of vessels; - Early identification of potentially threatening situations - The last three points request specific algorithms and interpretation supporting tools to detect abnormal vessel behaviour, to understand the corresponding suspicious event, to identify the associated threat and to early report to decisional authority.
