25|$|Elton (Joe Cushley) - Mrs Dribelle's dim-witted sidekick. He is a hardman {{who always}} wears a woolly hat with badges and <b>a</b> <b>denim</b> jacket. He knows that Bodger has a badger {{in the flat}} after Badger hits {{him on the head}} with a frying pan. He is {{incredibly}} stupid and is always trying to prove to Mrs Dribelle that there is a badger in the flat by all means possible, but he never succeeds. In one episode he dressed up as Mrs Dribelle's mother to trick Simon into believing Mrs Dribelle had nowhere to live, so that she could get Simon {{to move out of the}} flat. However Badger, who could see Elton's underpants underneath his skirt, knew it was Elton so he tried to show Simon the underpants. First he pulled the lever when Elton was sitting on the bed which made the bed go back, but it still did not work so Badger thought of another way to show Simon the underpants by turning the vacuum cleaner on, which sucked up the skirt Elton was wearing. Simon then saw the underpants and realised it was Elton. Even though Mrs Dribelle features in Series 7, Elton did not feature after Series 6. He was last seen in the episode 'Badger's Party' where he was attacked by children who were St John Badger Scouts.|$|E

500|$|The National Repertory Orchestra {{was founded}} as the Blue Jeans Symphony in 1960 by cellist and {{conductor}} Walter Charles.

Charles had conceived the idea for an intensive summer training camp for aspiring orchestral musicians in the 1950s {{when he was the}} conductor of the Wichita Falls Symphony Orchestra and chose Estes Park after vacationing there with his wife. The program was launched with 55 musicians and a $2000 grant from the town's chamber of commerce. In its early days, the young musicians worked all day in jobs at the resort and rehearsed from 10p.m. to midnight. This was a requirement for all the musicians, regardless of their ability to pay for their room and board, and one which Charles described at the time as [...] "part of the philosophical training of the Blue Jeans program."

500|$|The only European {{shows in}} Paris, France, were also lauded by critics. Lewis Corner of Digital Spy gave the second Parisian show a five star review. He praised the {{performance}} abilities of both artists, explaining [...] "When left to [...] own devices on stage, the rapper is forceful and beguiling. It takes little {{for him to}} have thousands waving their hands to 'Tom Ford', as he looks dapper in honour of the designer. But when Beyoncé rises up out of the stage in <b>a</b> <b>denim</b> military outfit to the question 'bad bitch?' and then storms into 'Run The World (Girls)', the track's sentiment couldn't resound more. Without doubt, she lives up to her hype as one of the world's best performers. Slick movement, tight choreography, innocent attitude and effortless vocals instantly escalate the atmosphere of the show." [...] Simon Harper of Clash felt that both performers had immediately apparent different performance approaches and both commanded an [...] "incredible presence and deafening screams from the French crowd", however concluded that Beyoncé just finished on top as the better of the two, finalising his all positive review with [...] "The music world's most powerful and influential partnership couldn't fail to demonstrate the reasons for their rise to dominance... As the On The Run tour comes to its conclusion, it's clear to see that Mrs. Carter emerges on top. But damn, it was a good race to watch." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "We Found Love" [...] was shot on September 26–28, 2011, in County Down, Northern Ireland. It was filmed {{in a field}} {{in the town of}} Bangor, County Down, ahead of Rihanna's embarkment on the European leg of the Loud Tour (2011), and the New Lodge area of North Belfast. It was {{directed}} by Melina Matsoukas, who had previously directed the videos for [...] "Rude Boy" [...] (2010), and the controversial [...] "S" [...] (2011). During the filming, people driving around the location of the set informed the BBC that traffic in the area was congested as drivers tried to see the singer.

She filmed scenes while wearing a bikini with the pattern of the US flag, and <b>a</b> <b>denim</b> vest and ripped jeans. The owner of the field, farmer and North Down Borough Council Democratic Unionist Party councillor Alan Graham, expressed distaste after seeing Rihanna topless on his field, saying: [...] "When the filming did become to my mind unacceptable I requested the filming to stop... it became apparent to me that the situation was becoming inappropriate and I requested them to stop and they did". On September 28, 2011, the shoot location was moved to a closed set in Titanic Quarter, Belfast where both photographers and fans were barred from watching the singer.|$|E

500|$|Both Beyoncé and Jay-Z sported {{multiple}} outfits {{throughout the}} different {{performances of the}} tour. One of the more prominent designers for the tour was Versace, in which Beyoncé wore both a fishnet and leather Atelier black bodysuit (complete with a plunging neckline, a fishnet head mask and high heel combat boots), {{as well as a}} colourful Atelier bodysuit from the designer. The leather Atelier black bodysuit took approximately 200 hours to craft and was used for the opening number of the tour, [...] "'03 Bonnie & Clyde". The colourful bodysuit was commented on by Versace who stated that the team had their inspiration from the street for the colour and added various crystals and stripes to show a [...] "baseball vibe" [...] while also trying to capture Beyoncé's energy. Beyoncé's tour shoes were designed by Stuart Weitzman and Joker's Closet. Other outfits included <b>a</b> <b>denim</b> jumpsuit and a bedazzled leotard bodysuit that [...] "showed off her derrière". Beyoncé also sported more thematic and dramatic pieces of clothing, including a full bridal veil and a sweeping train made of a black-and-white American flag. The American flag outfit was designed by Riccardo Tisci of Givenchy and took over 500 hours to create. The American flag train was 16.4 feet long but weighed around 500 grams allowing it to fly in the wind. The individual stars on the outfit were hand-embroidered and its inspiration was said to be [...] "American Danger: Bonnie & Clyde with a modern twist." [...] For the performance of [...] "Ring the Alarm", Beyoncé returned to designer Vrettos Vrettakos (with whom she collaborated with notably on her previous solo tour).
