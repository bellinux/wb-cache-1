2500|$|In 1392 Cokayne was {{party to}} an {{important}} donation intended to fund a chantry at St Oswald's Church, Ashbourne. On 18 March he, together with John Kniveton, Roger Bradbourne and Richard Cokayne, granted rents worth 100 shillings {{a year from the}} manor of Mercaston to William Hyde, the church's chaplain. In this, they were acting as feoffees for Nicholas Kniveton and the purpose of the chantry was to pray for the souls of the Kniveton family, who were probably relatives of the Cokaynes. Cokayne was involved in the process over some time, as he had witnessed the transfer by feoffees of the Mercaston estate to Johanna, the widow of Nicholas Kniveton, in June 1391. As was customary, the souls of others concerned in the grant were included, and in this case John, Duke of Aquitaine and Lancaster was named, as the manor was held of him, together with John Sheppey, the Dean of Lincoln, who confirmed the grant. Hyde paid £20 for the licence to accept the <b>alienation</b> <b>in</b> <b>mortmain</b> of the rents, a costly privilege because the property passed thereby outside the land market and beyond most royal taxation. With reference to a later donation to set up a chantry at Ashbourne for the Bradbourne family, the local historian Susan Wright comments on the peculiar [...] "intensity of relations, including much intermarriage, among those families with manors between the Dove valley and Derby in the Peak foothills" [...] which was both celebrated and created through such rituals.|$|E

50|$|Abbot William {{travelled}} to the Papal Curia in Rome {{around the}} turn of the century. On 27 August 1300 the king granted him protection for foreign travel, to last until the following Whitsun. No reason for the journey is mentioned but this was the time of Jubilee, proclaimed by Boniface VIII. On 1 January 1301 letters were filed with the king, appointing as his attorneys during his absence Master Roger of Wenlock and Hugh Aleyn of Minsterley. Roger seems to have been closely associated with the abbey. He and Richard de Waleton made grants small estates at Astley Abbotts, each consisting of a house and a half virgate of land. William of Muckley paid the fine for <b>alienation</b> <b>in</b> <b>mortmain</b> of these gifts and the king, campaigning in Scotland, granted the licence on10 May 1304 at Stirling. He seems to have made considerable gains while leading the community through very difficult times. The economic crisis of the early 14th century forced the abbey into adaptations. One strategy, presumably pioneered by Abbot William, was to shed the risks of demesne farming in favour of the secure income stream from leases: the abbey's Shropshire demesnes contracted from 21 carucates in 1291 to 12 in 1355.|$|E

Two years later they gained in a similar fashion protection for three years to collect alms. This was gained by virtue of an indulgence granted by the Pope to the Trinitarian order.

50|$|The Belmeis family, closely {{involved}} in the foundation of Lilleshall Abbey during the 12th century, turned their generosity to White Ladies in the 13th and 14th. It seems that the priory already had substantial holdings in the Belmeis manor of Donington by the mid 13th century, as Joanna, widow of Walter de Belmeis was forced to seek a settlement of her dower in 1256 by suing the prioress for a third part of 100 acres. John de Belmeis petitioned Edward I for permission to grant the priory ten acres of land and ten of wood in Donington and the king ordered an inquest on 1 May 1304. The inquest found that the land {{was part of a}} much larger estate John held of Alan la Zouche and that it was worth 3s. 4d. per year. After payment of a fine, a licence for the <b>alienation</b> <b>in</b> <b>mortmain</b> was issued on 18 May from Stirling, where the king was besieging the castle. In July 1315 his son Hugh also secured an inquest into a proposed grant of 30 acres of wood. The inquest found the land to be worth 5 shillings per year. On 1 November, the day he licensed the appropriation of Tibshelf church, Edward II also permitted, for a fine of £5, the grant of 30 acres to the priory by Hugh de Beumeys.|$|E

50|$|Another {{relatively}} distant {{possession of}} White Ladies was {{the church at}} Tibshelf in Derbyshire, the advowson of which must have been granted early {{in the history of}} the priory. In 1291 the Taxatio Ecclesiastica of Pope Nicholas IV assessed the rectory as worth £8 but also recorded £1 going to the nuns of Brewood. Early in the following century the priory moved to appropriate the church: essentially taking over the tithes and employing a vicar to serve the church and its congregation. In order to obtain a licence from Edward II to appropriate the church into mortmain, the prioress and convent had to part with a fine of £10, a very large sum for the priory at any stage in its history. The licence was duly granted on 1 November 1315. Evidently the details of the transaction took some time to work out, as it was not until 7 July 1319 that Bishop Walter Langton was able to issue an ordinance defining the vicar's allotment of land and directing that he be paid 40 shillings annually, divided into equal payments at Easter and Michaelmas. This was reinforced by a papal ordinance, which erroneously attributed to the priory a dedication to St Lawrence. Evidently Tibshelf proved a good long-term investment: before the dissolution, the Valor Ecclesiasticus reported Tibshelf bringing in £5 6s. 8d. However, to continue holding the rectory, the priory was required to pay a pension of 20 shillings a year to the vicars of Lichfield cathedral, a condition not mentioned in Langton's ordinance but in force by 1402 at the latest, as in that year the Archdeacon of Stafford's court passed an ordinance on its payment.Beside its holdings in the East Midlands, the priory held many very small pieces of property, mostly donated by local families, around Brewood and scattered across Shropshire to its south and west. On 6 October 1254, for example, Philip de Beckbury, in response to a fine levied at Westminster, agreed to pay the priory one mark annually as rent for two mills at Beckbury. In 1256 William de Ercall, and Prioress Agnes engaged in a complicated series of law suits, including a fine of lands, to transfer to the convent a very small rent (a ninth of the sheaves on three carucates of land) and small piece of land for a weir. This involved settling any competing claim that might come from Wombridge Priory. Some small transfers represented the dowries of canonesses on their admission to the community. Bartholomew Terret gave a virgate in Lawley as dowry for his sister Gundred. Richard de Harley and his wife Burga went to considerable trouble and expense to donate property and rights to the priory, the most important being the advowson of Bold church, which was in southern Shropshire and part of the Diocese of Hereford. On 11 May 1309 Bishop Swinefield asked the dean and chapter of Hereford Cathedral to approve the transfer of the advowson from Harley to White Ladies. He issued an ordinance to this effect on 3 August. As it involved an <b>alienation</b> <b>in</b> <b>mortmain,</b> the transfer required royal approval, and this could only be secured through payment of a fine. Edward II's licence was issued on 6 August, permitting the transfer of a messuage and half a virgate of land at Bold, in addition to the advowson. This was probably to provide a dowry for Alice de Harley, who later became prioress. In the longer term, the value of Bold declined greatly, probably as a result of declining population, and the income proved insufficient to maintain a priest, prompting Bishop Thomas Mylling to issue an ordinance on 10 October 1481, amalgamating the church with that of neighbouring Aston Botterell. Although a pension of ten shillings, payable each Michaelmas, was promised to White Ladies, Bold was bringing in only 6s. 8d. in 1536.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Program of Liberal StudiesIn {{this thesis}} I study <b>alienation</b> <b>in</b> Edward Hopper’s and Jackson Pollack’s paintings. Each of these American {{painters}} expressed <b>alienation</b> <b>in</b> his art in a distinctive way. The {{source of their}} alienation is different, too, yet they share some personality traits. While <b>alienation</b> <b>in</b> Pollock’s paintings is mainly derived from his psychological characteristics, the source of <b>alienation</b> <b>in</b> Hopper’s paintings is mostly sociological. The <b>alienation</b> <b>in</b> Hopper’s paintings is the manifestation of man’s new status in the world, which is defined by Modernity. He is warning about the situation, in which despite the superficial achievements, man is alone. And, I believe, Pollock is the offspring of that situation...|$|R
