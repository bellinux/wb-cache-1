5|$|Zero Mission is {{the first}} game in the Metroid series to include a {{sequence}} in which the player controls Samus without her Power Suit. In {{this portion of the}} game, Samus is more vulnerable to damage, must crawl through ducts on her hands <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> without the help of her Morph Ball mode, and has a weak pistol that briefly stuns enemies as her only weapon. However, Samus retains all energy tanks she acquired previously.|$|E
5|$|In his welterweight debut and {{his first}} fight under Team Rough House affiliation, Wallhead was victorious. The fight took place at Cage Warriors: Strike Force 3 where Wallhead faced Greco-Roman wrestler Steve Singh-Sidhu. Though Wallhead had dropped to welterweight, {{he still had a}} {{considerable}} weight advantage over his opponent who weighed in at 3.5kg less than Wallhead. This perhaps was significant as Singh-Sidhu's strikes seemed to have little bearing on Wallhead, who was able to land takedowns and a standing choke. Midway through the first round, Singh-Sidhu appeared to be backing away from Wallhead, who chased him down with punches <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> to the head. After a shin strike to the head, Singh-Sidhu's corner threw in the towel, resulting in a first-round TKO victory for Wallhead.|$|E
30|$|Pearson’s {{correlation}} coefficients (R) were then calculated for kneeling versus knee stability, <b>knee</b> function <b>and</b> <b>knee</b> pain scores.

40|$|The {{relative}} {{contributions of}} hip <b>and</b> <b>knee</b> proprioceptors to the origination of extensor spasms {{were examined in}} 11 subjects with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI). Ramp and hold extension and combined hip <b>and</b> <b>knee</b> oscillation movements were imposed to the right leg while the ankle was held in a static position by a custom-designed robot. Isometric joint torques of the hip, <b>knee,</b> <b>and</b> ankle and surface electromyograms (EMGs) from seven leg muscles were recorded following controlled hip <b>and</b> <b>knee</b> extension. A stereotypical torque response consisting of hip flexion, <b>knee</b> extension, <b>and</b> ankle plantar flexion was observed following hip <b>and</b> <b>knee</b> perturbations. Further, the hip or knee joint posture modulated the spastic reflexes triggered by the extension movement of the other joint, with larger responses observed with the hip <b>and</b> <b>knee</b> extended. In addition, combined hip <b>and</b> <b>knee</b> oscillation movements were imposed to one leg with four different phasing conditions. The phasing between the hip <b>and</b> <b>knee</b> modulated the reflex activity triggered by hip <b>and</b> <b>knee</b> oscillations. The EMG patterns of the spastic reflexes were generally consistent with muscle timing during locomotion in human SCI. This knowledge may help identify rehabilitation strategies that produce functional movements in human SCI...|$|R

5|$|Gaga, with {{shoulder}} and facial protrusions (prosthetic makeup mimicking subdermal implants) walks in {{a seemingly endless}} black space, where people are on their hands <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> in an organized pattern. She raises her hand and crouches down to join them. When the first verse begins, everyone dances to choreography. The scenes alternate between the dance, and Gaga singing on her throne in space. In the second verse, Gaga and Rico are in tuxedos, with her face painted to mirror his. Alternating clips show Gaga caressing and attempting to dance with him while he stays expressionless and motionless for the most part. When the chorus plays for the second time, Gaga sings in a room of mirrors, with her head displayed in a glass box among oddly distorted mannequin heads. In the succeeding shots, she is once again shown on her throne giving birth to more {{members of the new}} race. After choreographed routines by Gaga and her dancers, they all gather in a circle and embrace in a hug.|$|E
5|$|Non-disabled sprinters have {{calves and}} ankles that return and amplify the energy {{supplied}} by their hips <b>and</b> <b>knees,</b> while Pistorius compensates with additional work {{because he does}} not have calves and ankles with their associated tendons and muscles. An analysis published by Engineering & Technology magazine estimates that in using the blades, Pistorius must generate twice the power from his gluteal and quadriceps muscles that a normal sprinter would. Other sources also credit core abdominal muscles and a faster arm swing. His trainer estimates that about 85 percent of his power comes from his hips and the rest from his knees. This results in a gait that waddles slightly, as Pistorius swings his upper body to balance the springing action of the blades. The blades compress under his weight, then release as he moves forward, providing forward thrust from the tips as they return to their molded shape. As they spring off, he swings them slightly out to the side and throws them forward for the next stride.|$|E
5|$|Studies by Phil Senter in 2007 {{conducted}} on P. neimongoliensis and P. mongoliensis {{concluded that the}} forelimbs of these taxa (and likely those of other Psittacosaurus species) were too short (only about 58% {{as long as the}} hindlimbs) to reach the ground, and their range of motion indicates they could neither be pronated nor generate propulsive force for locomotion, suggesting that Psittacosaurus was entirely bipedal. The forelimbs were also too short to be used in digging or bringing food to the mouth, and Senter suggested that if Psittacosaurus needed to dig depressions in the ground it may have used its hindlimbs instead. The forelimbs could be used for two-handed grasping of objects or scratching the body, but due to their extremely limited flexibility and reach, they could have only been used to grasp objects very close to the belly or sides of the animal and could have scratched only the belly, flank <b>and</b> <b>knees.</b> Even though the hands could not reach the mouth, Psittacosaurus could have still used them to carry nesting material or food to a desired location.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} the limb position at which the maximum toe-grip strength could be exerted as well as measurement reproducibility. [Subjects] Twenty healthy young women were selected. [Methods] We measured toe-grip strength under three conditions: 90 ° hip <b>and</b> <b>knee</b> flexion while sitting, 90 ° hip flexion <b>and</b> <b>knee</b> extension while sitting, and a standing position. [Results] We found that toe-grip strength was significantly lower in the 90 ° hip flexion <b>and</b> <b>knee</b> extension sitting position than in the 90 ° hip <b>and</b> <b>knee</b> flexion sitting position and standing position. Moreover, the 90 ° hip <b>and</b> <b>knee</b> flexion sitting position produced the best intraclass correlation coefficient (r = 0. 813). [Conclusion] The results suggest that 90 ° hip <b>and</b> <b>knee</b> flexion while sitting is the most suitable limb position for measuring toe-grip strength, as this position allows maximum strength to be exerted and allows measurements to be repeated...|$|R
40|$|Background: Alterations in hip {{abductor}} strength <b>and</b> hip <b>and</b> <b>knee</b> adduction moments during gait {{are associated}} with knee osteoarthritis. This study examines the relationship between hip abductor strength <b>and</b> hip <b>and</b> <b>knee</b> adduction moments during gait in individuals with symptomatic medial knee osteoarthritis. Methods: Ninety-nine participants underwent maximal isometric hip abductor strength testing and 3 D gait analysis. Pearson correlations examined relationships between non-normalized maximal hip abductor strength (Nm), peak external hip <b>and</b> <b>knee</b> adduction moments (Nm) <b>and</b> <b>knee</b> adduction moment impulse (Nm∙s). Linear regressions examined these relationships while controlling for body size (height and mass) and walking speed. Findings: Positive relationships existed between non-normalized hip abductor strength <b>and</b> hip <b>and</b> <b>knee</b> adduction moments (r = 0. 28 and 0. 37, respectively, p 0. 05) but {{was a significant predictor}} of knee adduction moment impulse (B = 0. 05, p = 0. 005), explaining 6 % of the variance. Interpretation: While a significant relationship between hip abductor strength <b>and</b> <b>knee</b> adduction moment impulse was noted, hip abductor strength only explained a small amount of variance in the impulse. Our findings support previous research of healthy individuals and those with mild to moderate <b>knee</b> osteoarthritis <b>and</b> suggests hip abductor strength has little influence on hip <b>and</b> <b>knee</b> adduction moments during gait...|$|R

5|$|Washington shared {{time at the}} Trail Blazers {{power forward}} spot with Maurice Lucas at first, but after Lucas' trade to the New Jersey Nets, he became the {{full-time}} starter. He played three seasons in Portland, during which he earned {{a spot in the}} 1980 NBA All-Star Game, after some of the top players sat out due to injury. During that All-Star weekend, which was held in Landover, Maryland, nearby American U. held a halftime ceremony in which they retired Washington's number. He was named a team captain for the following season. In his post-punch career, numerous players, coaches, and officials noted that he became less aggressive on the court out of fear of getting into another fight; something he never did. Washington started experiencing pain in his back <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> during the 1980–81 season. The pain became unbearable during the 1981–82 season, and he retired in January 1982 after missing all but 20 games. In 1987, after more than five years out of the league, he tried to make a comeback with the Warriors, but lasted only eight games on the roster (playing in six of them) before being cut.|$|E
5|$|On June 2, 1900, {{during the}} British march on Pretoria, Burnham was wounded, almost fatally. He {{was on a}} mission to cut off the flow of Boer gold and {{supplies}} to and from the sea and to halt the transportation of British prisoners of war out of the Pretoria. He scouted alone far to the east behind enemy lines trying to identify the best choke point along the Pretoria-Delagoa Bay railway line. He came upon an underpass of a railway bridge, an ideal location to disrupt the trains, but was immediately surrounded by a party of Boers. Burnham instantly fled and he had almost escaped when his horse was shot and fell, knocking him senseless and pinning him under its dead body. It was night and he was already far away when his horse was shot, so the Boer troopers apparently did not check to see if Burnham had been injured or killed. When he awoke hours later, Burnham was alone and in a dazed state having sustained serious injuries. In spite of his acute agony, Burnham proceeded to creep back to the railway, placed his charges, and blew up the line in two places. He then crept on his hands <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> to an empty animal enclosure to avoid capture and stayed there for two days and nights insensible. The next day, Burnham heard fighting in the distance so he crawled in that direction. By this time he was indifferent as to the source of the gunshots and by chance it was a British patrol that found him. Once in Pretoria the surgeons discovered that Burnham had torn apart his stomach muscles and burst a blood-vessel. His very survival was due only {{to the fact that he}} had been without food or water for three days.|$|E

30|$|We {{analyzed}} {{whether the}} ability of our patients to kneel was related to overall functional scores, pain scores <b>and</b> <b>knee</b> stability scores using the OKS [10]. There {{was a very strong}} correlation between kneeling scores <b>and</b> <b>knee</b> function scores (R =  0.70), a strong correlation between kneeling <b>and</b> <b>knee</b> pain (R =  0.45), and a weak relationship between kneeling <b>and</b> <b>knee</b> stability (R =  0.29). Importantly, the weak relationship between kneeling <b>and</b> <b>knee</b> stability in combination with the near perfect (3.8 / 4) knee stability score demonstrates that the inability of the patients to kneel was not related to an unstable knee. When comparing the scores of the patients who could and could not kneel, significant differences were detected for both standardized pain and function (p =  0.03 and 0.001, respectively). These results are similar to those found in a recent study in Iran for a similar-sized group of patients with osteoarthritis [18].|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis {{constitutes}} a major musculoskeletal burden {{for the aged}} Australians. Hip <b>and</b> <b>knee</b> replacement surgeries are effective interventions once all conservative therapies to manage the symptoms have been exhausted. This study aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of hip <b>and</b> <b>knee</b> replacements in Australia. To our best knowledge, the study is the first attempt {{to account for the}} dual nature of hip <b>and</b> <b>knee</b> osteoarthritis in modelling the severities of right and left joints separately. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We developed a discrete-event simulation model that follows up the individuals with osteoarthritis over their lifetimes. The model defines separate attributes for right and left joints and accounts for several repeat replacements. The Australian population with osteoarthritis who were 40 years of age or older in 2003 were followed up until extinct. Intervention effects were modelled by means of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) averted. Both hip <b>and</b> <b>knee</b> replacements are highly cost effective (AUD 5, 000 per DALY and AUD 12, 000 per DALY respectively) under an AUD 50, 000 /DALY threshold level. The exclusion of cost offsets, and inclusion of future unrelated health care costs in extended years of life, did not change the findings that the interventions are cost-effective (AUD 17, 000 per DALY and AUD 26, 000 per DALY respectively). However, there was a substantial difference between hip <b>and</b> <b>knee</b> replacements where surgeries administered for hips were more cost-effective than for knees. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Both hip <b>and</b> <b>knee</b> replacements are cost-effective interventions {{to improve the quality of}} life of people with osteoarthritis. It was also shown that the dual nature of hip <b>and</b> <b>knee</b> OA should be taken into account to provide more accurate estimation on the cost-effectiveness of hip <b>and</b> <b>knee</b> replacements...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{question}} of how best to reduce waiting times for health care, particularly surgical procedures such as hip <b>and</b> <b>knee</b> replacements {{is among the most}} pressing concern of the Canadian health care system. The objective {{of this study was to}} test the hypothesis that significant seasonal variation exists in the performance of hip <b>and</b> <b>knee</b> replacement surgery in the province of Ontario. Methods We performed a retrospective, cross-sectional time series analysis examining all hip <b>and</b> <b>knee</b> replacement surgeries in people over the age of 65 in the province of Ontario, Canada between 1992 and 2002. The main outcome measure was monthly hospitalization rates per 100 000 population for all hip <b>and</b> <b>knee</b> replacements. Results There was a marked increase in the rate of hip <b>and</b> <b>knee</b> replacement surgery over the 10 -year period as well as an increasing seasonal variation in surgeries. Highly significant (Fisher Kappa = 16. 05, p 2 Autoreg = 0. 85) seasonality was identified in the data. Conclusion Holidays and utilization caps appear to exert a significant influence on the rate of service provision. It is expected that waiting times for hip <b>and</b> <b>knee</b> replacement could be reduced by reducing seasonal fluctuations in service provision and benchmarking services to peak delivery. The results highlight the importance of system behaviour in seasonal fluctuation of service delivery. </p...|$|R
