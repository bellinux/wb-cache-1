5|$|Since {{opening in}} 1962, the zoo {{has focused on}} animal {{conservation}} efforts. Programs at the Phoenix Zoo include captive breeding for reintroduction (for instance the <b>Arabian</b> <b>oryx,</b> black-footed ferret, Mexican wolf, Ramsey Canyon leopard frog, and thick-billed parrot, sanctuary for animals that are no longer breeding (for instance the African painted dogs at the zoo), and rescue and rehabilitation (for instance lead poisoning treatments for the California condor).|$|E
5|$|The zoo {{has been}} {{conservation}} minded from its inception. Soon after it opened it hosted what {{was thought to}} be the last few <b>Arabian</b> <b>oryx,</b> which formed the basis of the world herd created for Operation Oryx and eventually allowed the reintroduction of the species into the wild. It now includes a sanctuary to care for animals that are endangered or unwanted.|$|E
5|$|Differences {{occur in}} pelage colouration, {{ranging from a}} pale white (as in the <b>Arabian</b> <b>oryx)</b> to black (as in the black wildebeest). However, only the {{intermediate}} shades, such as brown and reddish brown (as in the reedbuck), are commonly observed. In several species, females and juveniles exhibit a light-coloured coat, while those of males darken with age. As in the wildebeest, the coat may be marked with prominent or faint stripes. In some species such as the addax, the coat colour can vary by the season. Scent glands and sebaceous glands are often present.|$|E
50|$|In 1978, four <b>Arabian</b> <b>oryxs</b> {{were brought}} to the Shaumari Wildlife Reserve for a {{breeding}} program. Starting in 1983, 31 oryxs were released into the wild, successfully returning the oryx into its native environment.|$|R
25|$|Other than humans, wolves are the <b>Arabian</b> <b>oryx's</b> only predator. In captivity {{and good}} {{conditions}} in the wild, oryx have a lifespan of up to 20 years. In periods of drought, though, their life expectancy may be significantly reduced by malnutrition and dehydration. Other causes of death include fights between males, snakebites, disease, and drowning during floods.|$|R
25|$|In the King James Version of the Bible, {{the word}} re’em is {{translated}} as 'unicorn'. In Modern Hebrew, the name re'em laban, meaning white oryx, {{is used in}} error for the <b>Arabian</b> <b>oryxes</b> living in the sanctuary Yotvata Hai Bar near Eilat. The scimitar oryx is called re'em Sahara. The Arabian name ri'ïm {{is the equivalent of}} the Hebrew name re'em, also meaning white oryx, suggesting a borrowing in the Early Modern era..|$|R
5|$|Only 18 {{species of}} mammals {{are found in}} Bahrain, animals such as gazelles, desert rabbits and {{hedgehogs}} are common in the wild but the <b>Arabian</b> <b>oryx</b> was hunted to extinction on the island. 25 species of amphibians and reptiles were recorded as well as 21 species of butterflies and 307 species of flora. The marine biotopes are diverse and include extensive sea grass beds and mudflats, patchy coral reefs as well as offshore islands. Sea grass beds are important foraging grounds for some threatened species such as dugongs and the green turtle. In 2003, Bahrain banned the capture of sea cows, marine turtles and dolphins within its territorial waters.|$|E
5|$|The zoo {{provides}} sanctuary to {{many animals}} that {{need a place}} to live for various reasons. Some (like the <b>Arabian</b> <b>oryx,</b> Bali mynah, rhinoceros hornbill, Mexican gray wolf, and white rhinoceros) participate in captive breeding programs, some (such as the African spotted dogs) have retired from such programs and need a home, some have behavioral problems, and some are being rehabilitated to return to the wild. Animals that are in sanctuary are treated somewhat differently from other animals by the zoo. While normal exhibits balance the needs of the animals with those of visitors (for example, incorporating large viewing areas), the sanctuary exhibits are almost completely focused on the comfort and well-being of the animals.|$|E
5|$|Before a {{property}} is {{inscribed on the}} List of World Heritage in Danger, its condition is assessed and a potential programme for corrective measures is developed {{in cooperation with the}} State Party involved. The final decision about inscription is made by the committee. Financial support from the World Heritage Fund may be allocated by the committee for listed properties. The state of conservation is reviewed on a yearly basis, after which the committee may request additional measures, delete the property from the list if the threats have ceased or consider deletion from both the List of World Heritage in Danger and the World Heritage List. Of the two Former UNESCO World Heritage Sites, the Dresden Elbe Valley was delisted after placement on the List of World Heritage in Danger while the <b>Arabian</b> <b>Oryx</b> Sanctuary was directly delisted. As of 2017, there are 54 entries (17 natural, 37 cultural) on the List of World Heritage in Danger. Some sites have been designated as World Heritage Sites and World Heritage in Danger in the same year, such as the Church of the Nativity, traditionally considered to be the birthplace of Jesus. Arranged by the UNESCO regions 22 of the listed sites are located in the Arab States (of which 7 are located in Syria and 5 in Libya), 15 in Africa (of which 5 are in the Democratic Republic of the Congo), 7 in Latin America and the Caribbean, 6 in Asia and the Pacific, and 4 in Europe and North America (all by 2017). The majority of the endangered natural sites (11) are located in Africa.|$|E
5000|$|Al Ain Zoo (منتزه العين للحياة البرية [...] ) is a 400 ha zoo {{located in}} the foothills of the Jebel Hafeet Mountains in Al Ain, United Arab Emirates. It mainly {{comprises}} <b>Arabian</b> antelopes and <b>oryx,</b> eland, gazelle, lechwe and can be found in the tree shaded paddocks which offer excellent breeding conditions.|$|R
50|$|Exotic {{ungulate}} encephalopathy is a transmissible {{spongiform encephalopathy}} (TSE), or prion disease, identified in infected organs of zoo animals. This subgroup of the TSEs in captive animals was identified in zoo animals in Great Britain including species of greater kudu, nyala, gemsbok, the common eland, <b>Arabian</b> and Scimitar <b>Oryx,</b> an Ankole-Watusi cow, and an American bison. Studies indicate that transmission likely occurred via the consumption of feed supplemented with meat and bone meal, although some animals died after the British ban on ground offal in animal feed. All animals died during the 1990s, with the last death occurring in 1998.|$|R
5000|$|The name saola {{has been}} {{translated}} as [...] "spindle-horned", although the precise meaning is actually [...] "spinning-wheel post horn". The {{name comes from}} a Tai language of Vietnam (by connotation that [...] "Priceless, like {{the moon and the}} stars"), but the meaning is the same in the Lao language (ເສົາຫລາ, also spelled ເສົາຫຼາ /sǎo-lǎː/ in Lao). The specific name nghetinhensis refers to the two Vietnamese provinces of Nghệ An and Hà Tĩnh, while Pseudoryx acknowledges the animal's similarities with the <b>Arabian</b> or African <b>oryx.</b> Hmong people in Laos refer to the animal as saht-supahp, a term derived from Lao (ສັດສຸພາບ /sàt supʰáːp/) meaning [...] "the polite animal", because it moves quietly through the forest. Other names used by minority groups in the Saola's range are lagiang (Van Kieu), a ngao (Ta Oi) and xoong xor (Katu) [...] In the press, saolas have been referred to as [...] "Asian unicorns", an appellation apparently due to the saola's rarity and reported gentle nature, and perhaps because both the saola and the oryx have been linked with the unicorn. No known link exists with the Western unicorn myth or the [...] "Chinese unicorn", the qilin.|$|R
5|$|Both the {{function}} {{and the appearance}} in life of the extremely elongated and bifurcated vertebral spines remain elusive. Salgado and Bonaparte (1991) suggested the spines represented defense weapons against predators, arguing that they tapered towards their tips. In a subsequent skeletal reconstruction drawing, Salgado (1999) depicted the neural spines supporting a keratinous sheath, which could have added significantly to the total length of the spines. The presence of a covering, either of keratin or skin, is shown by a striation pattern {{on the surface of}} the spines similar to the bony horn cores of today's bovids. American science writer Gregory Paul (2000) argued that the spines, if elongated by a keratinous sheath, could have been used as a weapon both against predators and members of the same species, as the animal might have been able to point its most anterior spines forward by bending its neck. He also hypothesized that the spines could have been clattered together to generate sound. In 2016, Mark Hallett and Mathew Wedel suggested that the backwards-directed spines might have been able to skewer predators when the neck was abruptly drawn backwards during an attack. A similar defense strategy is found in today's giant sable antelope and <b>Arabian</b> <b>oryx,</b> which can use their long, backwards directed horns to stab attacking lions. Apart from the possible function in defense, the spines may have been used for display, either for the intimidation of rivaling individuals or for courtship. Hallett and Wedel also hypothesized that rival males might have interlocked their spines for neck wrestling.|$|E
25|$|In June 2011, the <b>Arabian</b> <b>oryx</b> was relisted as {{vulnerable}} by the IUCN Red List. The IUCN estimated more than 1,000 <b>Arabian</b> <b>oryx</b> in the wild, with 6,000–7,000 held in captivity worldwide in zoos, preserves, and private collections. Some {{of these are}} in large, fenced enclosures (free-roaming), including those in Syria (Al Talila), Bahrain, Qatar, and the UAE. This {{is the first time}} the IUCN has reclassified a species {{as vulnerable}} after it had been listed as extinct in the wild. The <b>Arabian</b> <b>oryx</b> is also listed in CITES Appendix I.|$|E
25|$|In the 1930s, Arabian princes and {{oil company}} clerks started hunting <b>Arabian</b> <b>oryx</b> with {{automobiles}} and rifles. Hunts grew in size, {{and some were}} reported to employ as many as 300 vehicles. By {{the middle of the}} 20th century, the northern population was effectively extinct. The last <b>Arabian</b> <b>oryx</b> in the wild prior to reintroduction were reported in 1972.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Arabian</b> <b>oryx</b> is the {{national}} animal of Jordan, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Qatar.|$|E
25|$|On June 28, 2007, Oman's <b>Arabian</b> <b>Oryx</b> Sanctuary was {{the first}} site ever {{to be removed from}} the UNESCO World Heritage List. UNESCO's reason for this was the Omani government's {{decision}} to open 90% of the site to oil prospecting. The <b>Arabian</b> <b>oryx</b> population on the site has been reduced from 450 in 1996 to only 65 in 2007. Now, fewer than four breeding pairs are left on the site.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Arabian</b> <b>oryx</b> is {{also the}} namesake of several {{businesses}} on the Arabian peninsula, notably Al Maha Airways and Al Maha Petroleum.|$|E
25|$|The diets of the <b>Arabian</b> <b>oryx</b> consist {{mainly of}} grasses, but they eat a large variety of vegetation, include buds, herbs, fruit, tubers and roots. Herds of <b>Arabian</b> <b>oryx</b> follow {{infrequent}} rains {{to eat the}} new plants that grow afterward. They can go several weeks without water. Research in Oman has found grasses of the genus Stipagrostis are primarily taken; flowers from Stipagrostis plants appeared highest in crude protein and water, while leaves seemed a better food source with other vegetation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Arabian</b> <b>oryx</b> were hunted to {{extinction}} {{in the wild}} by 1972. By 1980, the number of <b>Arabian</b> <b>oryx</b> in captivity had increased {{to the point that}} reintroduction to the wild was started. The first release, to Oman, was attempted with oryx from the San Diego Wild Animal Park. Although numbers in Oman have declined, there are now wild populations in Saudi Arabia and Israel, as well. One of the largest populations is found in Mahazat as-Sayd Protected Area, a large, fenced reserve in Saudi Arabia, covering more than 2000km2.|$|E
25|$|The {{taxonomic name}} Oryx leucoryx {{is from the}} Greek orux (gazelle or antelope) and leukos (white). The <b>Arabian</b> <b>oryx</b> is also called the white oryx in English, dishon in Hebrew, and is known as maha, wudhaihi, baqar al wash, and boosolah in Arabic.|$|E
25|$|Only {{two sites}} {{have ever been}} delisted: the <b>Arabian</b> <b>Oryx</b> Sanctuary in Oman and the Dresden Elbe Valley in Germany. The <b>Arabian</b> <b>Oryx</b> Sanctuary was {{directly}} delisted in 2007, instead of first being put on the danger list, after the Omani government decided to reduce the protected area's size by 90 percent. The Dresden Elbe Valley was first placed on the danger list in 2006 when the World Heritage Committee decided that plans to construct the Waldschlösschen Bridge would significantly alter the valley's landscape. In response, the Dresden City Council attempted to stop the bridge's construction, but after several court decisions allowed {{the building of the}} bridge to proceed, the valley was removed from the World Heritage List in 2009.|$|E
25|$|<b>Arabian</b> <b>oryx</b> {{prefer to}} range in gravel desert or hard sand, where their speed and {{endurance}} will {{protect them from}} most predators, {{as well as most}} hunters on foot. In the sand deserts in Saudi Arabia, they used {{to be found in the}} hard sand areas of the flats between the softer dunes and ridges.|$|E
25|$|In 1986, the <b>Arabian</b> <b>oryx</b> was {{classified}} as endangered on the IUCN Red List, and in 2011, {{it was the first}} animal to revert to vulnerable status after previously being listed as extinct in the wild. It is listed in CITES Appendix I. In 2011, populations were estimated at over 1,000 individuals in the wild, and 6,000–7,000 individuals in captivity worldwide.|$|E
25|$|Until 2009, the Southwestern {{corner of}} African Plains {{was home to}} the {{endangered}} <b>Arabian</b> <b>oryx</b> and blesbok. Unfortunately, due to a huge budget cut and the unpopularity of the species with visitors, they were phased-out of the collection. This section of the exhibit remains empty. The exhibit also lost its two male cheetahs in 2009 due to them dying of old age. They were replaced by the hyenas.|$|E
25|$|The oases grow date palms, acacia and {{eucalyptus}} trees. In the desert, {{the flora}} is very sparse {{and consists of}} grasses and thorn bushes. The indigenous fauna had come close to extinction because of intensive hunting, {{which has led to}} a conservation program on Bani Yas Island initiated by Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan in the 1970s, resulting in the survival of, for example, <b>Arabian</b> <b>Oryx,</b> Arabian camel and leopards. Coastal fish and mammals consist mainly of mackerel, perch, and tuna, as well as sharks and whales.|$|E
25|$|Historically, the <b>Arabian</b> <b>oryx</b> {{probably}} ranged {{throughout most}} of the Middle East. In the early 1800s, they could still be found in the Sinai, Palestine, the Transjordan, much of Iraq, and most of the Arabian Peninsula. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, their range was pushed back towards Saudi Arabia, and by 1914, only a few survived outside that country. A few were reported in Jordan into the 1930s, but by the mid-1930s, the only remaining populations were in the Nafud Desert in northwestern Saudi Arabia and the Rub' al Khali in the south.|$|E
25|$|Rare Animal Range was a trail {{which focused}} on highly {{endangered}} species. Featured species included guanaco, Formosan sika deer, pied ruffed lemurs, and blue-eyed black lemurs. The exhibit also had duplicate enclosures for the zoo's <b>Arabian</b> <b>oryx,</b> blesbok, Père David's deer, and broad-snouted caiman {{as well as a}} large pond with a pair of small islands in the center which were home to a pair of golden-cheeked gibbons. Due to budget cuts and the unpopularity of many of the species, the zoo was forced to close the exhibit in 2009.|$|E
25|$|The zoo {{is highly}} {{proactive}} in species preservation and conservation efforts and participates in over 40 Species Survival Plans (SSP) with the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. The {{following is a}} list of the Species Survival Plans (SSP) that the zoo is involved with: addax, Chinese alligator, mandrill, bongo, kori bustard, fishing cat, cheetah, chimpanzee, Lake Victoria cichlids, Andean condor, wattled crane, African elephant, addra gazelle, white-cheeked gibbon, gorilla, great hornbill, rhinoceros hornbill, spectacled langur, ring-tailed lemur, ruffed lemur, mona monkey, Allen's swamp monkey, Bali mynah, ocelot, okapi, <b>Arabian</b> <b>oryx,</b> scimitar-horned oryx, Oriental small-clawed otter, thick-billed parrot, African penguin, Mauritius pink pigeon, Aruba Island rattlesnake, black rhinoceros, Louisiana pine snake, black-handed spider monkey, cottontop tamarin, golden lion tamarin, Indochinese tiger, Sumatran tiger, Puerto Rican crested toad, radiated tortoise, Swainson's toucan, and Grevy's zebra.|$|E
25|$|When the oryx is not {{wandering}} its habitat or eating, it digs shallow depressions in {{soft ground}} under shrubs or trees for resting. They {{are able to}} detect rainfall from a distance and follow {{in the direction of}} fresh plant growth. The number of individuals in herd can vary greatly (up to 100 have been reported occasionally), but the average is 10 or fewer individuals. Bachelor herds do not occur, and single territorial males are rare. Herds establish a straightforward hierarchy that involves all females and males above the age of about seven months. <b>Arabian</b> <b>oryx</b> tend to maintain visual contact with other herd members, subordinate males taking positions between {{the main body of the}} herd and the outlying females. If separated, males will search areas where the herd last visited, settling into a solitary existence until the herd's return. Where water and grazing conditions permit, male oryx establish territories. Bachelor males are solitary. A dominance hierarchy is created within the herd by posturing displays which avoid the danger of serious injury their long, sharp horns could potentially inflict. Males and females use their horns to defend the sparse territorial resources against interlopers.|$|E
500|$|In {{its first}} years, the zoo hosted a captive {{breeding}} program ("Operation Oryx") {{with the specific}} goal of reintroducing the almost extinct <b>Arabian</b> <b>oryx</b> to the wild. By the early 1990s this program was still {{one of only two}} programs (the other being the golden lion tamarin) to have gone through the full wilderness-zoo-wilderness sequence. Nine oryx had been caught or donated for the breeding program. However, two pairs were delayed, so the [...] "World Herd" [...] was started in Phoenix in 1963 with only five animals shipped to the zoo and two born quickly after. The two delayed pairs arrived in 1964 to increase the herd to 11 individuals. The program was very successful, and the zoo celebrated its 225th <b>Arabian</b> <b>oryx</b> birth in 2002. The <b>Arabian</b> <b>oryx</b> became extinct in the wild in 1972, and reintroduction efforts were started in 1982 when oryx were released to the wild in the Omani Central Desert and Coastal Hills. Additional captive herds have been discovered and used as the basis for reintroductions, for instance in Saudi Arabia, but there has been some interbreeding even with these herds and most of the <b>Arabian</b> <b>oryx</b> in the wild today have ancestors from the Phoenix Zoo.|$|E
500|$|The Africa Trail showcases many of {{the most}} popular animals in the world, {{including}} the African painted dogs, hamadryas baboon, mandrill, ostrich, Mhorr's gazelle, white rhino, Grévy's zebras, lions, cheetahs, and Masai giraffes. The Desert Lives (pronounced like [...] "life") trail, diverts off of the Africa Trail before and after the lion and hyaena exhibits, and features bighorn sheep and <b>Arabian</b> <b>oryx</b> among the natural buttes.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Arabian</b> <b>oryx</b> {{have been}} reintroduced to Oman, Saudi Arabia, Israel, the United Arab Emirates, Syria, and Jordan. [...] A small {{population}} was introduced on Hawar Island, Bahrain, and large semimanaged populations at several sites in Qatar and the UAE. The total reintroduced population is now {{estimated to be}} around 1,000. This puts the <b>Arabian</b> <b>oryx</b> well over the threshold of 250 mature individuals needed to qualify for endangered status.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Arabian</b> <b>oryx</b> rest {{during the}} heat of the day and can detect {{rainfall}} and move towards it, meaning they have huge ranges; a herd in Oman can range over [...] Herds are of mixed sex and usually contain between two and 15 animals, though herds up to 100 have been reported. <b>Arabian</b> <b>oryx</b> are generally not aggressive toward one another, which allows herds to exist peacefully for some time.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Arabian</b> <b>oryx</b> [...] {{or white}} oryx (Oryx leucoryx) is a {{medium-sized}} antelope {{with a distinct}} shoulder bump, long, straight horns, and a tufted tail. It is a bovid, and the smallest member of the Oryx genus, native to desert and steppe areas of the Arabian Peninsula. The <b>Arabian</b> <b>oryx</b> was extinct in the wild by the early 1970s, but was saved in zoos and private preserves, and was reintroduced into the wild starting in 1980.|$|E
2500|$|Russian {{zoologist}} [...] Peter Simon Pallas introduced [...] "oryx" [...] into {{scientific literature}} in 1767, applying {{the name to}} the common eland as Antilope oryx (Pallas, 1767). In 1777, he transferred the name to the Cape gemsbok. At the same time, he also described {{what is now called}} the <b>Arabian</b> <b>oryx</b> as Oryx leucoryx, giving its range as [...] "Arabia, and perhaps Libya". In 1816, Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville subdivided the antelope group, adopted Oryx as a genus name, and changed the Antilope oryx of Pallas to Oryx gazella (de Blainville, 1818). In 1826, Martin Lichtenstein confused matters by transferring the name Oryx leucoryx to the scimitar-horned oryx (now Oryx dammah) which was found in the Sudan by the German naturalists Wilhelm Friedrich Hemprich and Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg (Lichtenstein, 1826). The <b>Arabian</b> <b>oryx</b> was then nameless until the first living specimens in Europe were donated to the Zoological Society of London in 1857. Not realizing this might be the Oryx leucoryx of previous authors, Dr. John Edward Gray proposed calling it Oryx beatrix after HRH the Princess Beatrice of the United Kingdom (Gray, 1857). Though this name was to persist for many years, Oldfield Thomas renamed the scimitar-horned oryx as Oryx algazal in 1903 (it has since been renamed Oryx dammah), and gave the <b>Arabian</b> <b>oryx</b> back its original name. The confusion between the two species has been exacerbated because both have been called white oryx in English.|$|E
