5|$|Gout {{is due to}} {{elevated}} levels of uric <b>acid</b> <b>in</b> the blood. This occurs due {{to a combination of}} diet and genetic factors. At high levels, uric acid crystallizes and the crystals deposit in joints, tendons and surrounding tissues, resulting in an attack of gout. Gout occurs more commonly in those who eat a lot of meat, drink a lot of beer, or are overweight. Diagnosis of gout may be confirmed by seeing the crystals in joint fluid or tophus. Blood uric acid levels may be normal during an attack.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effects of}} amino acids on the labellar hair chemosensory cells were {{examined}} with {{two kinds of}} flies (the fleshfly, Boettcherisca peregrina, and the blowfly, Phormia regina).

Amino <b>acids</b> <b>in</b> class 2 inhibited nonspecifically the discharges from three kinds of chemosensory cells. Amino <b>acids</b> <b>in</b> class 3 stimulated the salt receptor cell.

5|$|In aprotic solvents, oligomers, {{such as the}} {{well-known}} acetic acid dimer, may be formed by hydrogen bonding. An acid may also form hydrogen bonds to its conjugate base. This process, known as homoconjugation, {{has the effect of}} enhancing the acidity of acids, lowering their effective pKa values, by stabilizing the conjugate base. Homoconjugation enhances the proton-donating power of toluenesulfonic <b>acid</b> <b>in</b> acetonitrile solution by a factor of nearly 800. In aqueous solutions, homoconjugation does not occur, because water forms stronger hydrogen bonds to the conjugate base than does the acid.|$|E
