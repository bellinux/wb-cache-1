5000|$|Thermal Wheel, or Rotary heat exchanger: A slowly {{rotating}} {{matrix of}} finely corrugated metal, operating in both opposing airstreams. When the <b>air</b> <b>handling</b> <b>unit</b> is in heating mode, heat is absorbed as air {{passes through the}} matrix in the exhaust airstream, during one half rotation, and released {{during the second half}} rotation into the supply airstream in a continuous process. When the <b>air</b> <b>handling</b> <b>unit</b> is in cooling mode, heat is released as air passes through the matrix in the exhaust airstream, during one half rotation, and absorbed during the second half rotation into the supply airstream. Heat recovery efficiency up to 85%. Wheels are also available with a hydroscopic coating to provide latent heat transfer and also the drying or humidification of airstreams.|$|R
40|$|The viable {{solution}} to the high latent load that naturally occurs in tropical regions requires an alternative system that runs at relatively low energy consumption yet {{be able to provide}} indoor thermal comfort by effective handling of the excessive humidity. Although the existing outdoor air treatment system is a proven approach, it is unpopular in developing countries due to its high initial cost. In this paper, a new system termed Dual <b>Air</b> <b>Handling</b> <b>Unit</b> system is proposed to be the answer. The function of Humidity-control <b>Air</b> <b>Handling</b> <b>Unit</b> is to remove the moisture from the conditioned room up to the desired humidity level and in the process the room temperature is also fractionally reduced. The Temperature-control <b>Air</b> <b>Handling</b> <b>Unit</b> completes the task by removing the remaining sensible heat so that the room temperature is maintained at the required set-point. By reducing the relative humidity to 50 %, a much lower value than that of the normal air-conditioning could offer, room temperature of the new system is shifted higher to 26 °C {{in order to reduce the}} energy consumption. The simulation result shows that the proposed system offers energy savings up to 13. 2 % compared to the conventional air-conditioning system, without compromising the thermal comfort of the occupants...|$|R

40|$|In Mediterranean countries, the {{increasing}} demand of summer cooling is typically covered by electric chillers, often determining electric peak loads and black-outs. Thus, a wide interest is spreading in small scale natural gas-fired cogeneration systems driving desiccant-based <b>air</b> <b>handling</b> <b>unit,</b> that represent interesting alternatives to conventional units based on vapour compression cooling only. In this paper, experimental tests performed on an <b>air</b> <b>handling</b> <b>unit</b> equipped with a desiccant wheel, coupled to a small scale cogenerator and an electric chiller are described. A cross-flow heat exchanger between process air and cooling air (cooled by an adiabatic humidifier) is used to pre-cool the process air exiting the desiccant wheel. The effect of the heat exchanger and of the humidifier, {{as well as that}} of the chiller performance, on primary energy requirements and CO 2 equivalent emissions of the system is experimentally evaluated...|$|R
