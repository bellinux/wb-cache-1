5|$|The early {{eighteenth century}} {{was also a}} period of {{innovation}} in Gaelic vernacular poetry. Major figures included Rob Donn Mackay (1714–78) and Donnchadh Bàn Mac an t-Saoir (Duncan Ban MacIntyre) (1724–1812). The most significant figure in the tradition was Alasdair mac Mhaighstir Alasdair (Alasdair MacDonald) (c. 1698–1770). His interest in traditional forms {{can be seen in}} his most significant poem Clanranald's Gallery. He also mixed these traditions with influences from the Lowlands, including Thompson's Seasons, which helped inspire <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> nature poetry in Gaelic, which was not focused on their relations to human concerns.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they were}} renowned for their polite behavior, the courtesans {{were known to}} {{dominate}} the conversation amongst elite men, and were not afraid to openly castigate or criticize prominent male guests who talked {{too much or too}} loudly, boasted too much of their accomplishments, or had in some way ruined dinner for everyone by rude behavior (on one occasion a courtesan even beat up a drunken man who had insulted her). When singing to entertain guests, courtesans not only composed the lyrics to their own songs, but they popularized <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> lyrical verse by singing lines written by various renowned and famous men in Chinese history.|$|E
5|$|At the 1932 occasion, Tesla {{claimed he}} had invented a motor that would run on cosmic rays. In 1933, at age 77, Tesla told reporters that, after thirty-five years of work, {{he was on the}} verge of {{producing}} proof of <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> energy. He claimed it was a theory of energy that was “violently opposed” to Einsteinian physics, and could be tapped with an apparatus that would be cheap to run and last 500 years. He also told reporters he was working on a way to transmit individualized private radio wavelengths, working on breakthroughs in metallurgy, and developing a way to photograph the retina to record thought.|$|E

5|$|At these lower prices, ice {{began to}} sell in {{considerable}} volumes, with the market moving beyond the wealthy elite to {{a wider range of}} consumers, to the point where supplies became overstretched. It was also being used by tradesmen to preserve perishable good, rather than for direct consumption. Tudor looked beyond his existing suppliers to Maine and even to harvesting from passing icebergs, but neither source proved practical. Instead, Tudor teamed up with Nathaniel Wyeth to exploit the ice supplies of Boston on a more industrial scale. Wyeth devised <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> horse-pulled ice-cutter in 1825 that cut square blocks of ice more efficiently than previous methods. He agreed to supply Tudor from Fresh Pond in Cambridge, Massachusetts, reducing the cost of harvesting ice from 30 cents ($7.30) a ton (901kg) to only 10 cents ($2.40). Sawdust to insulate the ice was brought from Maine, at $16,000 ($390,000) a year.|$|E
5|$|Hieroglyphic writing {{dates from}} c. 3000BC, and is {{composed}} of hundreds of symbols. A hieroglyph can represent a word, a sound, or a silent determinative; and the same symbol can serve different purposes in different contexts. Hieroglyphs were a formal script, used on stone monuments and in tombs, that could be as detailed as individual works of art. In day-to-day writing, scribes used a cursive form of writing, called hieratic, which was quicker and easier. While formal hieroglyphs may be read in rows or columns in either direction (though typically written from right to left), hieratic was always written from right to left, usually in horizontal rows. <b>A</b> <b>new</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> writing, Demotic, became the prevalent writing style, {{and it is this}} form of writing—along with formal hieroglyphs—that accompany the Greek text on the Rosetta Stone.|$|E
5|$|Local trade unions, Durham County Council, {{and even}} the Farmers' Union were {{in support of the}} scheme, along with a number of private persons, the general reason being that it would bring <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> {{employment}} to the city and surrounding areas. Opponents to the station however claimed that the new jobs at the power station would go to specialist technicians brought into the region, and that the positioning of the station near Durham would not be beneficial to the city's electricity supply or make the cost of electricity any cheaper for those living near the station. Critics also claimed that wherever in the region a new power station were to be built, County Durham coal would be used in it, and that despite NESCo's claims, there may be more suitable sites elsewhere. The critics claimed that Durham's functioning as a cultural, educational, administrative and tourist centre, would be ultimately destroyed by heavy industrialisation.|$|E

5|$|Lutyens {{was profoundly}} {{affected}} by the war and sought <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> architecture to memorialise the Lost Generation. He generally preferred abstract designs for his war memorials, of which he designed dozens, over allegorical or figurative sculpture or the overt religious imagery that was present in many First World War memorials. Mells {{is one of the}} few monuments in which he used such allegory (in this case, the statue of Saint George). It is the most intricate of Lutyens' civic memorials to feature a statue of Saint George, though his memorial inside Wellington College's chapel features a similar sculpture of George and the Dragon. Fordham War Memorial in Cambridgeshire and Hove War Memorial in East Sussex both feature less intricate bronze statues of George with a sword and shield.|$|E
5|$|The last {{king of the}} Roman Kingdom, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, {{was overthrown}} in 509 BC {{by a group of}} noblemen led by Lucius Junius Brutus. Tarquin made a number of {{attempts}} to retake the throne, including the Tarquinian conspiracy, the war with Veii and Tarquinii and finally the war between Rome and Clusium, all of which failed to achieve Tarquin's objectives. The most important constitutional change during the transition from kingdom to republic involved <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> chief magistrate. Before the revolution, a king would be elected by the senators for a life term. Now, two consuls were elected by the citizens for an annual term. Each consul would check his colleague, and their limited term in office would open them up to prosecution if they abused the powers of their office. Consular political powers, when exercised conjointly with a consular colleague, were no {{different from those of the}} old king.|$|E
5|$|The mid-1980s {{also saw}} Gospel music see its {{popularity}} peak. <b>A</b> <b>new</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> gospel had evolved, called Contemporary Christian music (CCM). CCM {{had been around}} since the late 1960s, and consisted of a pop/rock sound with slight religious lyrics. CCM had become the most popular form of gospel by the mid-1980s, especially with artists like Amy Grant, Michael W. Smith, and Kathy Troccoli. Amy Grant was the most popular CCM, and gospel, singer of the 1980s, and after experiencing unprecedented success in CCM, crossed over into mainstream pop in the 1980s and 1990s. Michael W. Smith also had considerable success in CCM before crossing over to a successful career in pop music as well. Grant would later produce CCM's first #1 pop hit ("Baby Baby"), and CCM's best-selling album (Heart In Motion).|$|E

5|$|This {{interest}} {{had expanded}} by June 1953, when Hope recorded in New York {{as part of}} a quintet led by trumpeter Clifford Brown and alto saxophonist Lou Donaldson. Critic Marc Myers suggested that the six songs the band recorded were the first in <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> jazz, 'hard bop', that became highly influential. That 1953 session also helped Hope gain exposure with Blue Note Records' producer Alfred Lion, who supervised his debut recording as a leader around a week later. This resulted in the 10-inch album Elmo Hope Trio, which had Morris alumni Percy Heath on bass and Philly Joe Jones on drums. The tracks recorded illustrated, in critic Kenny Mathieson's view, that Hope was interested in the architecture and aural detail of the music more than in individual virtuosity. A further Blue Note recording session 11 months later led to Elmo Hope Quintet, Volume 2.|$|E
5|$|At {{the center}} of the massive ship, V'Ger is {{revealed}} to be Voyager 6, a 20th-century Earth space probe believed lost. The damaged probe was found by an alien race of living machines that interpreted its programming as instructions to learn all that can be learned, and return that information to its creator. The machines upgraded the probe to fulfill its mission, and on its journey the probe gathered so much knowledge that it achieved consciousness. Spock realizes that V'Ger lacks the ability to give itself a focus other than its original mission; having learned what it could on its journey home, it finds its existence empty and without purpose. Before transmitting all its information, V'Ger insists that the Creator come in person to finish the sequence. Realizing that the machine wants to merge with its creator, Decker offers himself to V'Ger; he merges with the Ilia probe and V'Ger, creating <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> life that disappears into another dimension. With Earth saved, Kirk directs Enterprise out to space for future missions.|$|E
5|$|Just before Edward's death, Parliament {{introduced}} <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> taxation {{called the}} poll tax, which was levied {{at the rate}} of four pence on every person over the age of 14, with a deduction for married couples. Designed to spread the cost of the war over a broader economic base than previous tax levies, this round of taxation proved extremely unpopular but raised £22,000. The war continued to go badly and, despite raising some money through forced loans, the Crown returned to Parliament in 1379 to request further funds. The Commons were supportive of the young King, but had concerns about the amounts of money being sought and the way this was being spent by the King's counsellors, whom they suspected of corruption. A second poll tax was approved, this time with a sliding scale of taxes against seven different classes of English society, with the upper classes paying more in absolute terms. Widespread evasion proved to be a problem, and the tax only raised £18,600— far short of the £50,000 that had been hoped for.|$|E
