40|$|One {{main point}} of our atmospheric-electric {{measurements}} over the Atlantic Ocean 1973 was {{the investigation of}} the <b>air-earth</b> <b>current</b> density above the sea. In addition to direct measurements at the water surface with a floating net, we calculated the <b>air-earth</b> <b>current</b> density from the electric field and the air conductivity measured simultaneously on board of the ship and during particular ascents in the free atmosphere. During all five ascents the <b>air-earth</b> <b>current</b> density did not change with altitude. For pure maritime air-conditions, the mean <b>air-earth</b> <b>current</b> density was found to be 2. 9 pA/m** 2. The mean hourly <b>air-earth</b> <b>current</b> density over the Atlantic shows nearly the same 24 -hour pattern as measured by Cobb (1977) at the South Pole at the same time. When dust-loaden air masses of African origin reached the ship as well as under continental influence the mean <b>air-earth</b> <b>current</b> density was reduced to 2. 1 pA/m** 2. The global 24 -hour pattern was modified by this continental influences. Finally, it is shown that the values of the air conductivity measured on board R. V. "Meteor" during our earlier expeditions have been influenced by the exhaust of the ship and must therefore be corrected. With this correction, our new mean values of the <b>air-earth</b> <b>current</b> density over the Atlantic are 2. 6 pA/m** 2 in 1965 and 2. 0 pA/m** 2 in 1969. From all measurements, the global <b>air-earth</b> <b>current</b> is estimated to be about 1250 A...|$|E
30|$|The <b>air-Earth</b> <b>current</b> is {{measured}} with a 1 -m 2 flat plate antenna kept flush with the ground shown in Fig. 2. The inputs from the three condensers of the ion counter and the <b>air-Earth</b> <b>current</b> plate are amplified with separate amplifiers placed close to the sensors and then fed through the coaxial cables to a data logger placed in a nearby hut. The <b>air-Earth</b> <b>current</b> is the total vertical current flowing {{to the plate and}} may contain contributions from the turbulent current and displacement current. In fair-weather days, overhead thunderstorm/charged cloud activities are almost absent and hence the displacement current contribution may be almost zero. The contribution from turbulence during fair-weather conditions is negligibly small and the measured vertical current is considered to be the <b>air-Earth</b> <b>current</b> (Panneerselvam et al., 2007 a; Siingh et al., 2007 b).|$|E
30|$|The {{impact of}} wind {{velocity}} on the ion concentration, <b>air-Earth</b> <b>current</b> density, Maxwell current density and electric field varies. On group one days, the intermediate ions are barely negatively correlated (correlation coefficient = − 0.20) whereas the small ions show some positive correlation. The large ions {{do not show}} any meaningful correlation. On relatively colder days (group two), there is a negative correlation (correlation coefficient ~ − 0.31 to − 0.46) for all three categories of ions. The electric field, Maxwell current density and <b>air-Earth</b> <b>current</b> density decrease {{with the increase in}} wind speed, except that on group one days the <b>air-Earth</b> <b>current</b> density does not show any dependence.|$|E

Francis Ronalds began observing the potential gradient and <b>air-earth</b> <b>currents</b> around 1810, including making continuous automated recordings. [...] He resumed his research in the 1840s as the inaugural Honorary Director of the Kew Observatory, where the first extended and comprehensive dataset of electrical and associated meteorological parameters was created. He also supplied his equipment to other facilities {{around the world with}} the goal of delineating atmospheric electricity on a global scale. [...] Kelvin's new water dropper collector and divided-ring electrometer [...] were introduced at Kew Observatory in the 1860s, and atmospheric electricity remained a speciality of the observatory until its closure. For high-altitude measurements, kites were once used, and weather balloons or aerostats are still used, to lift experimental equipment into the air. Early experimenters even went aloft themselves in hot-air balloons.|$|R
3000|$|After {{the primary}} maximum, PG {{subsided}} and eventually reached a minimum at 18 : 00 LT.

Aerosols are transported upward, allowing ion concentrations to recover. Thus, local conductivity is increased and PG is subsequently reduced (Chalmers 1967; O’Connor 1976; Serrano et al. 2006; Silva et al. 2014), in accordance with Ohm’s law under constant <b>air–earth</b> conduction <b>current</b> of PG[*]=[*]J [...]...|$|R

Short time-scale oscillations of the PG at two of the stations and a mid time-scale suppression of the PG in the three stations are found. Results are interpreted as evidencing long-range dust electrification; attributed to the <b>air-Earth</b> electrical <b>current</b> creating a bipolar charge distribution inside of the dust layer.

The annual mean value of electric field was 66 V/m, conductivity 2. 91 × 10 ^ mho/m, <b>air-earth</b> <b>current</b> 1. 56 × 10 ^ A/m, and the vertical distribution of potential gradient (V/m) was expressed by the following empirical equation : E=E_ 0 exp (- 0. 29 h), where h is the height (km). The mean diurnal variations of electric field and <b>air-earth</b> <b>current</b> were not much different from those in the worldwide thunderstrom activities...|$|E
30|$|Measurements at the Indian station Maitri show similar diurnal {{variations}} in the Maxwell current and the electric field with a maximum between 1800 UT and 2000 UT, which are attributed to global lightning discharge activity. The small- and large-ion concentrations follow the <b>air-earth</b> <b>current</b> density diurnal variations, whereas the intermediate-ion concentration does not follow the <b>air-Earth</b> <b>current</b> density, but it shows a flat maxima between 0900 UT and 1700 UT. The enhancement in ion concentration correlates with the rise in daytime surface temperature and {{may be attributed to}} new particle formation. This flat maxima becomes more prominent in the case of group two days, when the night-time temperature goes below the freezing point and the day time temperature is less than 3 °C. The averaged data of group one days show a peak in the <b>air-Earth</b> <b>current</b> at 0500 UT, which is not present in the data of the group two days. However, no such peak is observed in the electric field and Maxwell current density. Further study is required to understand the presence of the peak on the group one days and its disappearance on the colder fair-weather days.|$|E
30|$|The total ion {{concentration}} {{does not show}} any correlation with the electric field; however, when the night-time temperature goes below freezing, {{there is a small}} positive correlation (correlation coefficient = 0.28). The Maxwell current is well correlated (correlation coefficient = 0.68 and 0.70) with the electric field in both groups. The small, and the large, ions are very well correlated with the <b>air-Earth</b> <b>current</b> density. However, the situation is quite different with the intermediate ions. In the case of the group one days, there is a negative correlation (correlation coefficient = − 0.41) whereas there is no correlation in the case of group two days. Thus, most of the contribution to the <b>air-Earth</b> <b>current</b> seems to come from the small and large ions.|$|E

30|$|The most {{suitable}} parameters for monitoring GEC are the ionospheric potential, vertical <b>air–earth</b> conduction <b>current,</b> and atmospheric electric field {{measured at the}} surface (Rycroft et al. 2008). The latter is known as potential gradient (PG). By convention, PG {{is defined as the}} ratio of the local potential at height z to that height, PG[*]=[*]dV(z)/dz. PG is defined to be positive during fair weather (FW) days and is related to the vertical component of the atmospheric electric field by Ez[*]=[*]−PG. PG has the capability to reflect changes in GEC if measured at pollution-free sites such as oceans, mountain peaks, and Antarctica and during FW conditions (Reiter 1974; Harrison 2013; Siingh et al. 2013). Moreover, PG {{is one of the most}} commonly measured atmospheric electrical parameters for long periods (Nicoll 2012). The resulting abundance of historical and contemporary data for different latitudes helps to improve the understanding of GEC (Märcz and Harrison 2003).|$|R

The Potential Gradient (PG) was measured from 1926 to 84 and the <b>air-earth</b> conduction <b>current</b> (Jc) was measured during the final decade of the PG measurements. Daily Jc values (1978 – 1984) observed at 15 UT are presented here for the first time, with independently-obtained PG measurements used to select valid data. The 15 UT Jc (1978 – 1984) spans 0. 5 – 9. 5 pA/m 2, with median 2. 5 pA/m 2; the columnar resistance at Lerwick is estimated as 70 PΩm 2.

40|$|Fine weather ionic {{conduction}} and convection currents near the Earth's surface have been studied. <b>Air-earth</b> <b>current</b> density, potential gradient, electric space char^ density, number density of ions of either sign have been measured. It {{has been confirmed}} that raised earthed antennas {{can also be used}} for <b>air-earth</b> <b>current</b> measurements. <b>Air-earth</b> <b>current</b> measurements with a wire and a plate antenna, show- that within the first few metres of the atmosphere the transfer of electric space charge by moving air masses produces currents comparable to the conduction current. The term 'advection current' has been used to denote those currents produced by the horizontal movements of air masses containing electric space charge. An experiment performed in a low-speed wind tunnel shows that ions in moving air streams {{are not likely to be}} controlled by potential gradients less than 1000 V m" space charge measurements show pulses lasting about a- 5 minute. They usually lie between 10 and 20 pCm(^- 3). A qualitative explanation is given by solving the continuity equation. A theoretical account of the movement of ions in the atmosphere is also given. Analysis of the measured parameters using a computer programme suggests the existence of a layer of positive space charge, a few millimetres thick, close to the Earth's surface. Occurrence of extensive air showers has been recorded to see if there is any unobserved relationship with atmospheric electric elements. Measurements did not show much evidence; however, these are by no means conclusive. Simple calculation shows that only showers corresponding to primary energies of 10 (^ 19) eV or 10 (^ 20) eV can give measurable changes in the <b>air-earth</b> <b>current</b> density. The difficulties of measuring separately the two components of the conduction current by the direct method at any point above the Earth's surface is also discussed...|$|E

The current at the surface consists of the conduction current and a locally generated displacement current, which are often approximately equal in magnitude. A method of separating the two currents using two collectors of different geometry is investigated. The picoammeters connected to the collectors have a RC time constant of approximately 3 s, permitting the investigation of higher frequency <b>air-earth</b> <b>current</b> changes than previously achieved. The displacement current component of the <b>air-earth</b> <b>current</b> derived from the instrument agrees with calculations using simultaneous data from a co-located fast response electric field mill.

It is found that the columnar resistance is sensitively affected by surface wind...|$|E
30|$|T {{is total}} {{conductivity}} (Harrison 2006). Upward transport of aerosols gradually provides an extra suppression to PG through {{a decrease in}} the conduction current. Because there is no mechanism for quickly removing aerosols while they are elevated, an increase in columnar resistance results, reducing the <b>air–earth</b> conduction <b>current</b> (generating force of PG) and subsequently reducing PG (Harrison and Bennett 2007). Considering the moment of PG minimum at our site at 18 : 00 LT, a delay in columnar resistance maximization was noted in comparison with the results of Sagalyn and Faucher (1956), where the corresponding maximum occurred at 15 : 00 LT. We tentatively attribute this delay to differences in advective conditions at each site. In particular, the Sagalyn and Faucher (1956) maximum columnar resistance was obtained during low advection periods, whereas at our site, advection was expected to be relatively high because of the station’s location and thus change the columnar aerosol load.|$|R
30|$|The sources {{other than}} the <b>air-Earth</b> {{conduction}} <b>current</b> {{that contribute to the}} measured current density are (i) the convection current, (ii) the displacement current, (iii) the point discharge current, (iv) the precipitation current, and (v) the lightning current (Israel, 1973). The sum of all these currents is collectively called the Maxwell current. Out of these, the convection current arises when the charge carriers are moved by the winds, and hence it is a possible source for the locally induced component in the measured current. The lightning and precipitation currents are not considered since the datasets selected are during fairweather periods. The location of the experimental setup on a barren land does not favour point discharge current because the sharp edges provided by plants and trees allow for point-discharge currents but in Antarctica there are no trees and plants hence, contribution of point-discharge current is negligible. The effective area of the present experimental setup is 66.1 m 2 calculated from the formula S = hC/ɛ (Kasemir and Ruhnke, 1959; Tammet et al., 1996; Panneerselvam et al., 2007), ɛ being the dielectric constant of air, C the capacity of the antenna and h the height of the antenna above the ground. Here the value for C = 298.2 pF; h = 2 m. Capacity is measured with Digital multimeter as well as calculated using the formula for C (Tammet et al., 1996). The total current density can be estimated by dividing the measured current by the effective area of the antenna.|$|R

The advantages of using lightning survey satellites to furnish a base for accepting or rejecting the thunderstorm generator hypothesis are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{vertical}} columnar {{current density}} {{in the global}} atmospheric electrical circuit depends on the local columnar resistance. A simple model for the columnar resistance is suggested, which separates the local boundary layer component from the upper troposphere cosmic ray component, and calculates the boundary layer component from a surface measurement of air conductivity. This theory is shown to provide reasonable agreement with observations. One application of the simple columnar model theory {{is to provide a}} basis for the synthesis of surface atmospheric electrical measurements made simultaneously at several European sites. Assuming the ionospheric potential to be common above all the sites, the theoretical <b>air-earth</b> <b>current</b> density present {{in the absence of a}} boundary layer columnar resistance can be found by extrapolation. This is denoted the free troposphere limit <b>air-earth</b> <b>current</b> density, J 0 . Using early surface data from 1909 when no ionospheric potential data are available for corroboration, J 0 is found to be ~ 6 pA m&minus; 2 , although this is subject to uncertainties in the data and limitations in the theory.

30|$|On fair-weather days, {{the surface}} {{temperature}} varied either between − 3 °C and 8 °C or between − 7 °C and 3 °C.

The large ions show a barely negative correlation on colder days and almost no correlation {{on the rest of}} the days. With the increase of surface temperature, the electric field and the Maxwell current density increase whereas the <b>air-Earth</b> <b>current</b> density decreases. Interestingly, it is found that the intermediate ions showed a relatively larger effect as compared with the small and the large ions.|$|E
30|$|The global circuit {{involves}} {{lower atmosphere}} generators and upper atmosphere generators, {{the latter being}} significant over the polar caps.

In summer, the prevailing winds are light, moving in a nearly constant direction and the atmosphere is relatively free of turbulent and convective motions (Byrne et al., 1993). The downward <b>air-Earth</b> <b>current</b> being delivered {{to the surface of}} the Antarctic plateau is larger than the global average owing to its location in high latitudes. Therefore, because of its orography, the Antarctica plateau is strongly coupled to the GEC.|$|E
30|$|We have {{developed}} an experimental set-up to measure the atmospheric <b>air-earth</b> <b>current</b> (conduction current). Data obtained with the continuous measurements of Wilson’s plate are used to study of <b>air-earth</b> <b>current</b> density, {{with the aim of}} gaining an understanding of the experimental set-up’s response to different meteorological conditions, including fair-weather days. This paper {{is a part of the}} on-going Global Electric Circuit (GEC) studies from Tirunelveli (8.7 °N, 77.8 °E), a measurement site in the tropical and southern tip of the Indian peninsula. Attempts have been made in past few years to obtain the global signature in this region with this sensor, but on most of the occasions it has been impossible to obtain the global signature during fair-weather days. The data used for February–April, 2007 have the well-defined nature of this global signature, which is in agreement with the well-established classical Carnegie curve of GEC. This paper also deals with very important observations made at sunrise and during those hours when fog existed. It is noted that the resistivity of the atmosphere increased significantly with the onset of fog and later decreased as the fog disappeared, based on the measured value of conduction current density when compared with the electric field measured by horizontal passive wire antenna. Also, during fair-weather conditions, conduction current and electric field variations are similar because the conductivity during this period is more or less constant at this site. Observations made during different meteorological conditions, such as different wind speeds, humidities, and temperatures, are also discussed.|$|E
40|$|Ionosphere-magnetosphere {{disturbances}} at high latitudes, e. g. magnetic substorms, {{are accompanied}} by energetic particle precipitation and strong variations of the ionospheric electric fields and currents. These might reasonably be expected to modify the local atmospheric electric circuit. We have analysed air-earth vertical currents (AECs) measured by a long wire antenna at Esrange, northern Sweden during 35 geomagnetic substorms. Using superposed epoch analysis we compare the <b>air-earth</b> <b>current</b> variations during the 3 h {{before and after the}} time of the magnetic X-component minimum with those for corresponding local times on 35 days without substorms. After elimination of the average daily variation we can conclude that the effect of substorms on AEC is small but distinguishable. It is speculated that the AEC increases observed during about 2 h prior to the geomagnetic X-component minimum, are due to enhancement of the ionospheric electric field. During the subsequent 2 h of the substorm recovery phase, the difference between "substorm" and "quiet" atmospheric currents decreases. The amplitude of this "substorm" variation of AEC is estimated to be less than 50 % of the amplitude of the diurnal variation in AEC during the same time interval. The statistical significance of this result was confirmed using the Van der Waerden X-test. This method was further used to show that the average <b>air-earth</b> <b>current</b> and its fluctuations increase during late expansion and early recovery phases of substorms.

40|$|Progress in any {{field of}} {{scientific}} interest is often advanced {{by the failure}} to find agreement between two different approaches to a particular measurement in the field. This is so because it forces attention on he theory behind the measurements and {{the conditions under which}} the measurements were made. Such a problem is identified in the field of Atmospheric electricity. Differing results have been found for the value of the fine weather <b>air-earth</b> <b>current</b> when measured by the "indirect" and "direct" methods of approach. The indirect method involves the recording of the fine weather conductivity and the potential gradient and equating their product with the conduction current. In the direct method, the total charge arriving at a portion of the earths surface is measured. The direct method, though more difficult, appears to be the more fundamental measurement and a critical review of previous experiments and the hypotheses of work at ground level, in that it predicts a system from the examination of one of the systems boundaries, is indicated. The experimental problems associated with the direct and indirect methods and described with particular reference to the site used for the measurement of atmospheric electricity at Durham Observatory. In particular, the effects of pollution and the displacement current are discussed and some details of an unsuccessful attempt to devise a form of the direct method that would enable the true magnitude of any convection current to be found, are given. Suggestions are made for the measurements required and the conditions under which they should be made if the final resolution of these differences in the recording of the fine weather <b>air-earth</b> <b>current</b> is to be achieved...|$|E
30|$|Results of near-surface {{measurements}} of atmospheric electric field and meteorological parameters at the Indian Antarctic station, Maitri, during 12 fair-weather days of January and February, 2005, are presented. Data are analyzed {{to study the}} diurnal variation of the electric field and its departure, if any, from the global electric fields. Fair-weather days are classified into two groups depending upon {{the average of the}} hourly surface temperature. Group one, when the average of the hourly surface temperature is mostly above the freezing point, and group two, when the same is below the freezing point. The role of different ion sizes on the Maxwell current density and the <b>air-Earth</b> <b>current</b> density for the two groups are quite different under different conditions. To study the effect of ions on the atmospheric electric fields, ions are grouped as small ions, intermediate ions and large ions. We find that the small and the large ions largely influence the <b>air-Earth</b> <b>current</b> density with a correlation coefficient higher than 70 %. The intermediate ions have a negative correlation in the case of group one fair-weather days, whereas for group two days no correlation is found. The diurnal variations of the Maxwell current density and the electric field show a peak between 1800 UT and 2000 UT {{and the nature of the}} variation can be attributed to the variation in worldwide thunderstorm activity. The correlation coefficient between the measured electric field and the electric field from the Carnegie curve is 0.93 with a < 0.0001 significance level. Thus, the observed electric field at Maitri represents the global electric field. The results show that a wind velocity of less than 10 m/s and a surface temperature of lower than + 7 °C have almost no impact on the electric field and Maxwell current density.|$|E
30|$|The {{most widely}} used {{ground-based}} sensors for the <b>air-Earth</b> <b>current</b> measurements are: Wilson plate (Israel, 1973), the horizontal long-wire antenna (Ruhnke, 1969), horizontal passive antenna (Harrison, 1996) and spherical shell {{in the form of}} two hollow hemispheres (Burke and Few, 1978). The horizontal long wire antenna, if placed in the atmosphere, will closely follow the electrical current variations of the atmosphere after the initial net charge on the antenna leaks off. When the antenna is shorted to the ground through a resistor, it will generate a voltage that is proportional to the <b>air-Earth</b> <b>current.</b> In the present experimental setup, a long wire of length 41.5 m and thickness 3 mm is kept horizontally stretched parallel to the ground at a height of 1.2 m. The wire is mechanically supported by means of masts. By using teflon rods at their ends it is ensured that the antenna wire is electrically insulated from the supporting masts. The input is fed through the electrometer (Model AD 549) that has high input impedance and permits extremely low input bias current (10 – 14 A). The electrometer measures the current up to 1 nA (corresponding to the output voltages whose limit is ± 5 V) with a feedback resistance of 5 × 109 Ω. A unity gain operational amplifier (LM 308) amplifies the electrometer output signal. The amplified signal is then taken in a shielded cable over a distance of 10 m to the control room where it is fed to a PC-based data logger. The sensitivity of the digitized signal is 2.44 mV that will correspond to a current of 0.5 pA. The data are recorded at a sampling interval of one second (Panneerselvam et al., 2003).|$|E
40|$|Continuous {{measurements}} {{have been}} made of the <b>air-earth</b> <b>current</b> density, by the direct method, potential gradient, space charge density, by filtration, and the positive conductivity at Lanehead, situated in the N. Penninea, 440 m above sea level. Wind speed, wind direction and rate of rainfall were also recorded, but the measurements used only qualitatively. The problems of making continuous measurements {{for long periods of time}} and under difficult weather conditions are discussed. The results can be divided into two types; fair weather and disturbed weather. Of the former, diurnal variations for the one-year period July 1967 to June 1968 were calculated. That of potential gradient shows a close similarity with the variation found on the Carnegie in the Pacific (TORRESON et al, 1946), contrary to expectations for a land station within the austausch region. The <b>air-earth</b> <b>current,</b> on the other hand, is found to depend on the variation in columnar resistance, and its variation is similar to that of the space charge density. The diurnal variation of columnar resistance is estimated, and the role of pollution in controlling this variation is discussed. For disturbed weather, a high positive correlation has been found between space charge density and potential gradient at the ground during steady precipitation. Both were mostly negative during the precipitation, i. e. of opposite sign to the precipitation current. Splashing and point discharge are ruled out as sources of the space charge, so that the results imply some charge separation process within a few tens of metres of the ground giving positive charge to the rain and negative to the air. For 42 periods of steady rain, with some of snow, relations of the form F = Ao + B were calculated and the frequency distributions of A and B are given. The importance of making continuous measurements of several electric parameters is stressed, together with the necessity of using statistical methods to eliminate the effects of unknown variables such as meteorological conditions. An atmospheric electric station has been set up at Lanehead, where air pollution is low, and an atmospheric electric climate for the station has been established...|$|E

A long-term (1920 ? 1981) decrease has been discovered in the PG measured at the Eskdalemuir Observatory, Scotland (55 ° 19 ' N, 3 ° 12 ' W), suggesting that this represents a global change in the atmospheric electricity related {{to a decline in}} cosmic rays.

The data base included electric field, conductivity, and <b>air-earth</b> <b>current</b> density profiles from the tropics (25 deg N) to the Arctic (79 deg N). Almost all of the data have been obtained over the ocean to reduce noise associated with local generators, aerosols, and convection. Recently, two aircraft have been utilized to obtain, for the first time, quasi-periodic sets of simultaneous ionospheric potential (VI) soundings at remote locations and extending over time spans sufficiently long so that the universal time diurnal variation (Carnegie curve) could be observed. In additon, these measurements provided the first detection of the modulation of electric fields in the troposphere caused by the double vortex ionospheric convection pattern. Besides summarizing these measurements and comparing them to similar data obtained by other groups, this report discusses meteorological sources of error and criteria for determining if the global circuit is being measured rather than variations caused by local meteorological processes...|$|E
30|$|During the night, at 21 : 00 – 06 : 00 LT, {{stratification}} in {{the atmosphere}} confined the vertical mixing, thus allowing radon trapping, which eventually caused PG reduction by favoring negative space charge formation (Latha 2007), while CO 2 concentrations attained their maximum owing to respiration and lack of photosynthesis. After 6 : 00 LT, the initiation of morning mixing conditions diluted the space charges and photosynthesis began, thus increasing PG and reducing the CO 2 concentration. Between 12 : 00 and 16 : 00 LT, both curves followed a parallel downward trend as the vertical convection gradually maximized, further diluting the CO 2 and reducing the PG through an increase in columnar resistance and a subsequent decrease in the <b>air–earth</b> <b>current.</b> The latter mechanism referring to PG continued until 18 : 00 LT. During 16 : 00 – 21 : 00 LT, the CO 2 increased owing to the gradual transition to nocturnal stratification and the enforcement of CO 2 sources such as transpiration. The PG exhibits its secondary minimum at 18 : 00 LT and then increased parallel to the CO 2 trend, presenting the global thunderstorm activity.|$|E
40|$|The Nagycenk Geophysical Observatory in Hungary (47 ° 38 ' N, 16 ° 43 ' E) {{has made}} {{continuous}} {{measurements of the}} vertical atmospheric electric Potential Gradient (PG) since 1962. Global signals have previously been identified in the Nagycenk PG data. A long-term (1920 – 1981) decrease has been discovered in the PG measured at the Eskdalemuir Observatory, Scotland (55 ° 19 ' N, 3 ° 12 ' W), suggesting that this represents a global change in the atmospheric electricity related {{to a decline in}} cosmic rays. A 40 % decline in PG is shown here to have occurred at Nagycenk between 1962 and 2001, also consistent with changes in the <b>air-Earth</b> <b>current</b> measured at Kew (51 ° 28 ' N, 0 ° 19 ' W), London, 1966 – 1978. Comparison of the long-term PG measurements at both Eskdalemuir and Nagycenk gives further evidence to support the hypothesis of a global atmospheric electrical decline from the early twentieth century to the present time, as it is shown that local effects at Nagycenk are unlikely to have dominated the changes there.

30|$|The {{atmospheric}} {{electric field}} parameters near the Earth’s surface are {{disturbed by the}} local weather. Therefore, it becomes almost essential to identify and exclude data contaminated by local effects or connected with some large-scale systems. During the data selection process, we could identify 12 fair-weather days within two months, i.e. January and February, 2005. These days were January 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 25, and February 1, 5. Days {{are considered to be}} fair-weather days when there is no rain or snowfall, the wind speed is moderate (less than 10 m/s), low level clouds are absent, and high level clouds are less than 3 octa (Deshpande and Kamra, 2001; Panneerselvam et al., 2007 a). On some of the selected days, the wind speed exceeded 10 m/s for a very brief period (~an hour) but the measured electric field parameters were found to be within the considered normal range. The <b>air-Earth</b> <b>current</b> measurement could be affected by the blowing space charges present in this lofted dust. However, such days have been included in the fair-weather days. We consider the convention that on the fair-weather days the electric field pointing downward is negative (i.e. the potential gradient in fair-weather days is positive).|$|E
30|$|Ground-based {{measurements}} are often contaminated {{by the presence}} of ground radioactivity, atmospheric aerosols, turbulence and convection currents. Even columnar resistance, electrical conductivity, seasonal variations, ionospheric horizontal fields, and active thunderstorms in the area may influence the universal electric fields at a regional level (Takagi, 1977). However, measurements made at clean places such as over oceans (Mauchly, 1923; Ruttenberg and Holzer, 1955; Morita, 1971; Kamra et al., 1994), over high mountains (Cobb, 1968; Reiter, 1992), over exchange layers (Anderson, 1967; Markson, 1977), in the polar regions (Kasemir, 1972; Park, 1976; Cobb, 1977, Burns et al., 1995; Bering et al., 1998; Fuellekrug et al., 1999) and in the Antarctic (Despande and Kamra, 2001; Panneerselvam et al., 2007 a; Minamoto and Kadokura, 2011; Jeeva et al., 2011) have been used to study the global variation of atmospheric fields and to verify the global circuit concept postulated by Wilson (1925) and to confirm the unitary diurnal variation in the electric field. Alderman and Williams (1996) studied the <b>air-Earth</b> <b>current</b> density at Mauna Loa, Hawaii, which is free of pollution, and observed a single peak at 1900 UT. Apart from the global universal time variations, land stations also exhibit local time variations typical of their locations.|$|E
30|$|Comparing Figs. 4 (a) and 4 (b), it is {{observed}} that the <b>air-Earth</b> <b>current</b> density follows a superimposed variation of the small and the large ions; the variation of the intermediate-ion concentration is independent, and seems to follow the variation of the surface air temperature in both groups. This also indicates that the sources of intermediate ions may be {{different from that of the}} small and large ions. The small dip around 0300 UT in the potential gradient of group one decreases when data are averaged for all 12 fair-weather days and the potential gradient and the Maxwell current density show a single maxima at 1800 – 1900 hrs and a minima at 0200 hrs. Burns et al. (1995) reported a peak in the electric field at Davis, Antarctica, between 1900 UT and 2200 UT. The diurnal variation of the potential gradient and the Maxwell current is attributed to the diurnal variation in the global thunderstorm activity. Panneerselvam et al. (2007 a) measured the potential gradient and the Maxwell current at the Maitri station during 2001 – 2004, analyzed the data for 69 fair-weather days, and reported the diurnal variation to have a single periodic feature with a maximum at 1900 UT and a minimum at 0300 UT.|$|E
40|$|The {{monitored}} atmospheric electric elements at Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii, {{have provided}} good {{evidence of a}} direct solar influence {{on some of the}} electric elements recorded at the mountain observatory. An analysis of the data has shown that following a solar flare eruption, both the air-earth conduction current and the electric field, measured during fair weather at Mauna Loa, usually exceeded their established normal values. For the 1 -year measurement period from September 1960 to September 1961, nearly one-third of the days werc considered as “disturbed ” solar days due to solar flare activity. The mean value of the air-earth conduction current and the electric field on “disturbed ” solar days exceeded that of the “quiet ” solar days by about 10 percent. During the month of duly 1961, a period of spectacular solar activity, the highest sustained values of the year for the <b>air-earth</b> <b>current</b> and the electric field were recorded with the normal 24 -hr. values being exceeded by as much as 35 percent, and for one 6 -hr. period following a multiple flare burst, by 75 percent. The influence of corpuscular solar radiation on the earth-ionosphere electric circuit and upon the global thunderstorm activity are discussed. 1...|$|E
40|$|This {{proposal}} requests {{support for}} making the nearly three decades of Antarctic atmospheric electricity data available to more workers. Measurements of the vertical electric field and <b>air-earth</b> <b>current</b> density made at the Earth's surface in Antarctica have recently {{been shown to be}} of considerable interest to scientists interested in monitoring short-term Sun-Earth connections and long term climate change. Such measurements have been made off and on for more than three decades, primarily at Vostok and South Pole stations. There is no single place where all of these data can be obtained via the Internet in a contemporary format. The work proposed here will attempt to remedy this deficiency as much as possible. Data we know to be presently available include data from South Pole, 1982 - 86 and 1991 - 1993, and Vostok station, 1997 -present. Data were taken at South Pole and Vostok in the 60 's and ~O'S, but these may prove difficult to obtain in digital form. At present, only the University of Houston's 1991 - 1993 data are available on the Web. Unfortunately, they are stored on a server slated for retirement. Also, they are written VAX binary floating point, using the UCLA/Stanford/Michigan flatfile format (FLATDBMS), which is obscure to some users. We propose to combine and reformat the three available data sets plus any others we can obtain onto a newer server. We will use a more common and comprehensible format. Archival copies will be burned onto CD and/or DVD-ROM media. Finally we will register these data with the appropriate NASA data systems...|$|E
