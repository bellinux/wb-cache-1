40|$|International aid has an {{ambiguous}} {{effect on the}} macroeconomy of the recipient country. To the extent that aid raises consumer expenditure, {{there will be some}} real exchange rate appreciation and a shift of resources away from traded goods production and into non-traded goods production. However, <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> <b>investment</b> in the traded goods sector can mitigate this effect. Also, a relatively high level of productivity in the non-traded goods sector combined {{with a high level of}} investment will tend to depreciate the real exchange rate. We examine aid inflows in 26 sub-Saharan African countries, and find a variety of macroeconomic responses. Some of the variation in the responses can be explained by variation in observable country characteristics; this has implications for donor policy...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{economic}} growth is a fundamental part {{of the field of}} macroeconomics, which is masterfully captured in William Easterly’s The Elusive Quest for Growth. Easterly powerfully depicts the real, long term economic crisis that many countries are facing around the world and stimulates the reader {{to take part in the}} search for economic growth. In the early parts of The Elusive Quest for Growth, one begins to appreciate the meaning behind the book’s title. Individual policies such as <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> <b>investment,</b> population control, and human capital investment have all failed as a solution to the lack {{of economic growth}} in underdeveloped countries. In other words, Easterly alludes to an idea that a combination of different factors (investment, education, technological innovation), along with a fundamental structural change might be the path to long term economic growth. One of the underlying themes throughout Easterly’s book is the idea that people respond to incentives. In fact, most of Easterly’s analysis of various economic models throughout the book is an analysis of the incentives created by those models (Easterly, 2001). This paper examines the relationship between growth and privatization from an incentives perspective. Privatization, a method of reallocating assets and functions from the public sector to th...|$|E

The first being the most preferred solution. In non OECD countries especially Small Islands Developing States (SIDs), customized solid {{waste treatment}} methods must be implemented. SIDS have unique characteristics such as dependence on foreign <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> <b>investment,</b> their heavy reliance on imported consumer goods and resources, their vulnerability {{to the effects of}} climate change and due to the lower amount of waste being generated, conventional solid waste management processes are not appropriate. Waste to energy can {{play a major role in}} treating waste in SIDS where land is scarce and where a diversification of the energy mix is crucial. The aim of this paper is to perform a techno - economic study to assess the smallest possible capacity of a waste to energy plant that is capable of treating municipal solid waste. An excel model was developed containing capital, operational and maintenance cost estimates. The economic performance of the model was assessed using the Net Present Value (NPV), Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) and Simple Payback Period (SPP) tools. The Maldives were used as case study for developing a small scale plant. The model consists of a small scale prototype incinerator plant for energy extraction and an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) unit for electricity generation. The modelling gave the following results; an NPV of AUD 846, 547, a SPP of 3. 8 years and a LCOE of AUD 0. 11 /kWh for a plant capacity of 5, 274 tpa, an ORC unit capacity of 235. 20 kW with an incinerator having a flow rate of 752. 63 kg/hr, gate fees of 50 /t and a sale price of electricity of 0. 35 /kWh. The capital costs for the incinerator and the ORC unit were AUD 194, 912. 09 and 776, 151. 84 respectively. The biggest contributor to the capital expenditure was the flue gas treatment system with a total of AUD 814, 156. 04.

Considering things from the legal perspective, we also stop upon the legislative measures taken by the Government to support SME access to financial guarantees and credits. Obviously, in the context following the peak of the financial crisis, we took into consideration the regulation on stimulating the development of new jobs and the regime of state aids, as well. This latter issue includes, we believe, the most important references to State aid schemes on stimulating the investments with a major impact in the economy, the ‘de minimis’ <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> the <b>investments</b> made by small and medium-sized enterprises, and also to the issues arising from the implementation of a State aid scheme to support the investments which promote the regional development by creating jobs...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the link between}} foreign aid and the composition of government spending in aid-recipient countries. Two questions are addressed: (i) does foreign aid crowd out government spending in aid-recipient countries, and (ii) does the degree of fungibility vary across different categories of aid? Using a panel dataset of 67 countries for 1972 - 2000 we find that at the aggregate level about 70 percent of total aid is fungible. We also find that <b>aid</b> targeted <b>for</b> public <b>investment</b> crowds out about 80 - 90 percent of domestic government spending on public investment. Aid does not affect private investment, but has a strong positive impact on household consumption. The results are also robust to checks for causality. These findings are significant, since {{more than two-thirds of}} all aid flows to developing countries are tied to public investment projects...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the European Commission's {{approach}} to state <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> foreign direct <b>investment</b> in a competition policy framework. The Commission shows to consider variable cost aid (VCA) to be more distortive than start-up or fixed cost aid (FCA). This paper addresses that issue and checks whether allowing FCA while banning VCA is a first-best strategy for a rational Authority maximizing welfare. The model shows that a rational forward-looking government maximizing domestic welfare always prefers VCA to FCA if both the incumbent and the entrant are foreign firms and if granting VCA does not cause to the incumbent firm to exit the market. On the other hand, a VCA which causes the incumbent firm to be crowded out by the entrant never occurs at the equilibrium.

40|$|The task of {{forecasting}} stock {{performance is}} well studied with clear monetary motivations for those wishing to invest. A {{large amount of}} {{research in the area of}} stock performance prediction has already been done, and multiple existing results have shown that data derived from textual sources related to the stock market can be successfully used towards forecasting. These existing approaches have mostly focused on short term forecasting, used relatively simple sentiment analysis techniques, or had little data available. In this thesis, we prepare over ten years worth of stock data and propose a solution which combines features from textual yearly and quarterly filings with fundamental factors for long term stock performance forecasting. Additionally, we develop a method of text feature extraction and apply feature selection aided by a novel evaluation function. We work with investment company Highstreet Inc. and create a set of models with our technique allowing us to compare the performance to their own models. Our results show that feature selection is able to greatly improve the validation and test performance when compared to baseline models.

40|$|Enhancing {{the role}} of {{renewable}} energies in existing power systems {{is one of the}} most crucial challenges that society faces today. However, the high variability of their generation potential and the temporal disparity between the demand and the generation potential represent technological and operational gaps that burden the massive incorporation of renewable sources into power systems. Energy storage technologies are an alternative to tackle this gap; nonetheless, their incorporation within large-scale power grids calls for decision-making tools that ensure an appropriate design and sizing of power systems that exploit the benefits of incorporating storage facilities along with renewable generation power. In this paper, we present an optimization framework <b>for</b> <b>aiding</b> the evaluation of the strategic design of complex renewable power systems. The developed tool relies on an optimization problem, the generation, transmission, storage energy location and sizing problem, which allows one to compute economically-attractive investment plans given by the location and sizing of generation and storage energy systems, along with the corresponding layout of transmission lines.

We find that <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> trade facilitation reduces the costs of trading. Moreover <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> trade has an overall positive and significant impact on exports. This effect is entirely driven by aid to economic infrastructure, while the other main category of <b>aid</b> <b>for</b> trade, <b>aid</b> to productive capacity, has no discernible effect on exports.
