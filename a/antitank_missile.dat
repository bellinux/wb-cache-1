In {{exchange for the}} release of the nurses, he said Nicolas Sarkozy not only signed with Gaddafi security, health care and immigration pacts (assistance with border management and scholarships for Libyan students in the EU) : according to Libyan sources cited by the Agence France-Presse, a $230 million (168 million euros) MILAN <b>antitank</b> <b>missile</b> sale was also part of the release deal.|$|E
500|$|Before Barutana Depot was {{captured}} by the ZNG, {{one of the four}} storage structures, containing [...] of ammunition, was blown up by JNA Major Milan Tepić. The explosion occurred at 10:43, killing Tepić, and eleven ZNG troops who were blockading the depot in Bedenik Forest. The blast knocked down trees in a circle [...] wide, caused damage to nearby structures, and could be heard [...] away. The JNA lost another soldier {{in the area of the}} depot, killed by an <b>antitank</b> <b>missile</b> while he was engaging the ZNG using an infantry fighting vehicle gun.|$|E
500|$|While {{most of the}} JNA {{garrison}} in the Logorište barracks {{remained in}} place, a group of 10 to 16 tanks deployed south (without significant resistance) toward the villages of Belajske Poljice and Belaj. The armoured force went through Belaj before it was stopped at Gornji Velemerić and about [...] north of the village of Carevo Selo by elements of the 2nd Guards Brigade and the 137th Infantry Brigade. The JNA force retreated to Belaj after losing two tanks, mounting another attack {{on the road to}} Barilović. The four tanks dispatched to Barilović were also stopped by 137th Brigade troops before reaching their objective. By evening the 137th Infantry Brigade was reinforced by two companies redeployed from Generalski Stol and Erdelj, elements of the 3rd Battalion of the 2nd Guards Brigade, one tank, three armoured personnel carriers (APCs) and an <b>antitank</b> <b>missile</b> system to contain the JNA advance. During the night of 4–5 November, the civilian population was evacuated.|$|E

2500|$|In {{contrast}} to Soilih, Abdallah's presidency {{was marked by}} authoritarian rule and increased adherence to traditional Islam and the country was renamed the Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoros (République Fédérale Islamique des Comores; جمهورية القمر الإتحادية الإسلامية). Abdallah continued as president until 1989 when, fearing a probable coup d'état, he signed a decree ordering the Presidential Guard, led by Bob Denard, to disarm the armed forces. Shortly after {{the signing of the}} decree, Abdallah was allegedly shot dead in his office by a disgruntled military officer, though later sources claim an <b>antitank</b> <b>missile</b> was launched into his bedroom and killed him. [...] Although Denard was also injured, it is suspected that Abdallah's killer was a soldier under his command.|$|E
2500|$|Furthermore, he {{announced}} on 24 July 2007, that French and European representatives had obtained the extradition of the Bulgarian nurses detained in Libya to their country. In exchange, {{he signed with}} Muammar Gaddafi security, health care and immigration pacts—and a $230million (168million euros) MILAN <b>antitank</b> <b>missile</b> sale. The contract was the first made by Libya since 2004, and was negotiated with MBDA, a subsidiary of EADS. Another 128 million euro contract would have been signed, according to Tripoli, with EADS for a TETRA radio system. The Socialist Party (PS) and the Communist Party (PCF) criticised a [...] "state affair" [...] and a [...] "barter" [...] with a [...] "Rogue state". The leader of the PS, François Hollande, requested {{the opening of a}} parliamentary investigation.|$|E
5000|$|The {{aircraft}} {{was used for}} pilot training, navigation training, light transport, maritime surveillance and light ground attack. During the Algerian War of Independence the plane was used for light attack with the Nord SS.11 and AS.11 <b>antitank</b> <b>missiles</b> or with machine guns, bombs, and rockets. The Flamant MD 311s (which were based in Algeria to train pilots and navigators at first) were the first aircraft in history to fire one of the world's first wire-guided <b>antitank</b> <b>missiles</b> in anger, using French Army SS.11 <b>antitank</b> <b>missiles,</b> in a combat experiment to get at fortified caves located in deep mountain gorges, in 1956 from an aircraft based with the special unit of the French Air Force in Algeria, GOM.86. The SS.11 attacks proved extremely successful and the French Army which had provided the missiles, began an experiment {{which resulted in the}} world's first attack helicopters firing <b>antitank</b> <b>missiles.</b> [...] The Flamant stayed in service until 1981. In addition to the French air force, the Flamant served in Cambodia, Madagascar, Tunisia, and Vietnam.|$|R

2500|$|At 2:00 AM, General Shmuel Gonen called Adan {{and asked}} him if he could capture Suez in the two to two and half hours between dawn and the ceasefire. Adan {{answered}} that it depended on the Egyptian defenses in the town, but that he thought that {{at least part of the}} town could be taken. Gonen said: [...] "Okay, if it's Beersheba, go ahead; if it's Stalingrad, don't do it!", referring to Operation Yoav and the Battle of Stalingrad, respectively. Adan gave his orders accordingly. Israel argued that the attack would not be a violation of the ceasefire if it was launched before 7:00 AM, even if the battle continued after that hour, since the Arabs were the ones who chose when to start the war and when to call for a ceasefire. Israel also claimed that the ceasefire did not apply to [...] "mopping up" [...] operations that were altering the rear areas and not the front line. Intelligence knew of a commando battalion, two infantry battalions and an <b>antitank</b> <b>missile</b> company. Since Egyptian soldiers had been mostly surrendering during the previous two days, Adan assumed the defenders of Suez would not resist.|$|E

5000|$|... 25 July 2013, [...] "Luch" [...] has {{conducted}} a live firing test {{of its new}} <b>antitank</b> <b>missile</b> system “Corsar” at a firing range near Kiev.|$|E
50|$|The missile uses a tandem-charge HEAT warhead {{in order}} to defeat {{explosive}} reactive armour fitted to many armored vehicles today; a much small diameter warhead {{at the front of}} the missile body and a larger main warhead at the rear. Locating the main warhead at the rear of the missile body provides the correct stand off needed for the optimum effectiveness of the Eryx warhead without the need of a complex collapsible nose probe (e.g. the TOW) which is standard on most <b>antitank</b> <b>missiles</b> today. This simple solution keeps the missile's cost extremely low when compared to other <b>antitank</b> <b>missiles</b> but also for a compact missile design that can be produced in mass quantities.|$|R

50|$|Besides the French Army and the Hellenic Army, {{numerous}} other armies have the LRAC F1 in service, especially former French colonies in Africa. During the French intervention in Lebanon in 1982-83 many journalists in error reported the LRAC F1 {{as being the}} MILAN wire guided <b>antitank</b> <b>missile.</b> As of 2008, the Swedish AT4-CS (confined space) individual antitank weapon and the 600m range ERYX wire guided <b>antitank</b> <b>missile</b> has replaced the LRAC F1 as the standard French military's short range and ultra-short range anti-tank and assault weapon.|$|E

During the exercise, they dropped inert GBU-24 Paveway III laser-guided bombs and fired live AGM-65 Maverick <b>antitank</b> <b>missiles</b> on Utah test range. The hit rate {{was one of}} the highest ever seen in the Air Force, showcasing the lethality of the Block 40 F-16.|$|R
50|$|Unlike most <b>antitank</b> <b>missiles,</b> {{in which}} the booster burns {{completely}} before leaving the container and then the missile coasts a safe distance before the sustainer motor ignites, the HOT's booster burns both inside the container and outside the container for approximately one second giving the missile a high speed. The sustainer motor burns for 17 seconds, a flight time whose path exceeds {{the length of the}} trailing wires which dictate the maximum range of the missile. Because of the more powerful booster and sustainer motor that burns during its complete flight, the HOT missile had a much shorter flight time than any other wire guided <b>antitank</b> <b>missiles</b> when it was introduced. The booster's four nozzles are located at the roots of the four spring out fins. The sustainer motor's single exhaust is located {{in the rear of the}} missile body, where a vane controls the missile through thrust vector control as it rotates in flight.|$|R
