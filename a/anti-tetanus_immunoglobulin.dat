50|$|<b>Anti-tetanus</b> <b>immuno{{globulin}},</b> {{also known}} as tetanus immune globulin (TIG) and tetanus antitoxin, is a medication made up of antibodies against the tetanus toxin. It is used to prevent tetanus in {{those who have a}} wound that is at high risk and have not been fully vaccinated with tetanus toxoid. It is also used to treat tetanus along with antibiotics and muscle relaxants. It is given by injection into a muscle.|$|E
40|$|A 4 -year-old girl {{developed}} tetanus {{after she}} had fallen on the street a week before. She had never been vaccinated and despite pressure from the family practitioner, the parents refused {{to allow her to}} be given human <b>anti-tetanus</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> as a matter of principle after the wound had been stitched. Seven days later she was admitted to hospital with trismus and risus sardonicus. Upon initial treatment with human <b>anti-tetanus</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> and penicillin, and subsequently metronidazole, her clinical condition deteriorated with opisthotonus and life-threatening respiratory insufficiency, upon which she was moved to the intensive-care department where she was intubated and mechanically ventilated for two weeks. Finally she made a complete clinical recovery. Thanks to the extensive national vaccination program, tetanus has become a rare disease in the Netherlands. However, the very serious course and possible fatal outcome warrant a keen attitude and adequate treatmen...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{study the}} {{demographic}} profile, prognostic indicators, and mortality of tetanus patients and treatment outcomes following intramuscular <b>anti-tetanus</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> (ATG) alone or combined intrathecal and intramuscular ATG. DesignRetrospective study. SettingInpatients from a tertiary care hospital. Subjects: One hundred children under 12 {{years of age}} diagnosed with tetanus and admitted from January 2003 to December 2007 {{were included in the}} study. MethodsCase records of patients with neonatal tetanus (n= 30) and post-neonatal tetanus (n= 70) were evaluated retrospectively. The diagnosis of tetanus was based on World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. The outcomes of patients treated with either intramuscular ATG or both intrathecal and intramuscular ATG were separately compared in the neonatal and post-neonatal groups. ResultsOur study revealed difficulty in feeding, trismus, spasms, rigidity, and opisthotonus posturing as the predominant clinical manifestations. The survival rate for children receiving tetanus immunoglobulin by the dual route was significantly higher than for children receiving the immunoglobulin via the intramuscular route. Seizures and tremors were poor prognostic factors associated with tetanus...|$|E

40|$|Tetanus is {{a severe}} and highly fatal {{infectious}} disease {{caused by the}} toxin of Clostridium tetani, an anaerobic spore-forming Grampositive bacterium. The disease is characterized by muscle rigidity (tetany) {{and can lead to}} death by respiratory failure or seizures. The present study reports a case of tetanus in a 6 -day-old Quarter Horse foal. The animal showed apathy, lateral recumbency, umbilical thickening, protrusion of the third eyelid, seizures and hyperesthesia. Was treated with 50, 000 IU/kg of potassium penicillin; with <b>anti-tetanus</b> toxoid <b>immunoglobulin</b> in a dose of 25, 000 IU, 20, 000 IU and 20, 000 IU intravenously, intramuscular and intrathecal, respectively; with acepromazine hydrochloride (0. 05 mg / kg); fluid therapy of Ringer's lactate solution and dressing for umbilical cord. After 48 hours of treatment, the animal demonstrated hyperacute symptoms and died, showing unsuccessful in treating. Possibly the infection has been caused by inadequate umbilical cord cleansing...|$|R
40|$|Vitamin A {{deficiency}} {{is associated}} with increased childhood morbidity and mortality from respiratory and diarrheal diseases. In order to evaluate the effect of vitamin A on human antibody responses, we developed a vitamin A-deficient severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mouse model. Vitamin A-deficient mice were produced by depriving them of vitamin A at day 7 of gestation. Mice were reconstituted with human peripheral blood lymphocytes (huPBL) from tetanus toxoid immune donors at 6 weeks of age and immunized with tetanus toxoid at 6 and 8 weeks of age. Secondary human antibody responses were determined 10 days later. The geometric mean human <b>anti-tetanus</b> toxoid <b>immunoglobulin</b> G concentrations were 3. 75 micrograms/ml for the deficient mice and 148 micrograms/ml for controls (P = 0. 0005). Vitamin A-deficient mice had only a 2. 9 -fold increase in human anti-tetanus toxoid antibody compared with a 74 -fold increase in controls (P < 0. 01). Supplementation with vitamin A prior to reconstitution restored human antibody responses to normal. These data suggest that vitamin A deficiency impairs human antibody responses. We speculate that impaired responses could increase susceptibility to certain infections. Furthermore, we propose that effects of other nutritional deficiencies on the human immune system could be evaluated in the SCID-huPBL model...|$|R
40|$|Plasma {{membrane}} {{changes during}} {{the interaction of}} human eosinophils with large, antibody-coated, non-phagocytosable surfaces have been investigated in a model system. Human peripheral blood eosinophils were incubated with layers of agar into which tetanus toxoid and human <b>anti-tetanus</b> <b>immunoglobulin,</b> together with an eosinophil chemotactic factor (ECF), were incorporated. Changes in organization of the eosinophil plasma membrane proteins during interaction with the agar layer were detected by lactoperoxidase-catalysed iodination with [125]iodide. A protein of apparent mol. wt 55000 became newly accessible on the eosinophil surface as a specific consequence of interaction with antigen-antibody complexes in the agar layer. This protein appeared in the early attachment phase of the interaction which preceded extracellular degranulation. Cytochalasin D enhanced its appearance, while Mg 2 +-deficiency prevented it. A second newly accessible protein of apparent mol. wt 58000 was blocked when ECF was present and may therefore be a receptor for ECF. Other proteins of apparent mol. wt 68000 and 46000 newly appeared at the surface of eosinophils even after incubation in suspension, apparently {{as a consequence of}} the rapid cycling of membrane components which occurs in eosinophils...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To emphasise that tetanus still {{occurs in}} the United Kingdom, {{particularly}} in elderly people-as illustrated by two case reports-and to examine the state of tetanus immunity in elderly people. METHODS [...] 111 elderly people (over 65 years) were studied: 43 males, mean age 77. 7 years, range 67 - 94; 68 females, mean age 81. 3 years, range 67 - 95. They were either attending the accident service or were hospital inpatients. An {{attempt was made to}} obtain an immunisation history and antitetanus antibody titres were measured. RESULTS [...] Immunisation history was uncertain and unreliable. Measurement of antibody titres showed that they were inadequate to ensure protection in 50 % of those studied. Low levels were particularly prevalent in the over 80 age group and in females. Questioning about military service confirmed that this had predominantly involved males. CONCLUSIONS [...] Elderly people are at risk of contracting tetanus and should be targeted for community immunisation. Extra precautions in the form of passive immunisation with human <b>anti-tetanus</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> should be used in this age group in addition to the usual wound management measures when the elderly sustain tetanus prone injuries...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Introduction Tetanus is an {{infectious}} disease caused by tetanus toxin produced by Clostridium tetani and induces severe neurological manifestations. We treated {{a patient who}} developed tetanus during hospitalization for replantation of an amputated finger. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this is the first published case report of such an entity. Case presentation A 49 -year-old Japanese man had an amputation of his right middle finger at the distal interphalangeal joint region in an accident at work. His middle finger was successfully replanted, but his fingertip was partially necrotized because of crushing and so additional reconstruction with a reverse digital arterial flap was performed 15 days after the injury. Tetanus developed 21 days after replantation of the middle finger, but symptoms remitted via rapid diagnosis and treatment. Conclusions In replantation after finger trauma with exposure of nerve and blood vessel bundles, concern over injuring nerves and blood vessels may prevent irrigation and debridement from being performed sufficiently; these treatments may have been insufficiently performed in this patient. It is likely that the replanted middle finger partially adhered, and Clostridium tetani colonized the partially necrotized region. Even when there is only limited soil contamination, administration of tetanus toxoid and <b>anti-tetanus</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> is necessary when the fingers are injured outdoors and the finger nerves and blood vessels are exposed. The drugs should be administered just after replantation if the finger has been amputated. However, if clinicians pay attention to the possibility of tetanus development, treatment can be rapidly initiated. </p...|$|E
