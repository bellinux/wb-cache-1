5|$|AjTut {{was one of}} {{the lords}} of the {{northern}} Chak'an Itza province of the conquered Itza kingdom; friar Avendaño had met him during his expedition to Nojpetén. After the conquest he relocated from the north shore of Lake Petén Itzá to Mompana, a region lying between Lake Yaxha and the Classic period ruins of Tikal. For some years after the conquest he established the Mompana region as <b>a</b> <b>refuge</b> from the Spanish and engaged in internecine war against the surviving Kowoj to the south.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 14th century, {{the castle}} was used as <b>a</b> <b>refuge</b> by Richard II from the forces of his rival, Henry Bolingbroke. On 12August 1399, after {{returning}} from Ireland, Richard {{made his way to the}} castle where he met Bolingbroke's emissary, Henry Percy, for negotiations. Percy swore in the chapel he would not harm the king. On 19 August, Richard surrendered to Percy at Flint Castle, promising to abdicate if his life were spared. The king was then taken to London and died later in captivity at Pontefract Castle.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the Spanish Conquest, the main Mam {{population}} was situated in Xinabahul (also spelled Chinabjul), now the city of Huehuetenango. They retreated to Zaculeu as <b>a</b> <b>refuge</b> during the Spanish attacks because of its fortifications. The refuge was attacked by Gonzalo de Alvarado y Contreras, brother of conquistador Pedro de Alvarado, in 1525, with 120 soldiers, and some 2,000 Mexican and K'iche' allies. The city was defended by Kayb'il B'alam commanding some 5,000 people (the chronicles are not clear if this is the number of soldiers or the total population of Zaculeu).|$|E

5|$|At times, Al Jalali {{served as}} <b>a</b> <b>refuge</b> or a {{jail for a}} member of the royal family. For much of the 20th century it was used as Oman's main prison, but this {{function}} ended in the 1970s. Fort al-Jalali was restored in 1983 and converted into a private museum of Omani cultural history that is accessible only to dignitaries visiting the country. Exhibits include cannons, old muskets and matchlocks, maps, rugs and other artifacts.|$|E
5|$|Bristol sent three {{ships to}} the Royal Navy fleet against the Spanish Armada in 1588, and also {{supplied}} two levies {{of men to}} the defending land forces. Despite appeals to the Privy Council no reimbursement was made for these supplies. The corporation also had to repair the walls and gates of the city. The castle had fallen into disuse in the late Tudor era, but the City authorities {{had no control over}} royal property and the precincts became <b>a</b> <b>refuge</b> for lawbreakers.|$|E
5|$|Gibraltar {{was a very}} tempting {{target for}} the Italians, who saw it as <b>a</b> <b>refuge</b> for British {{warships}} and allied merchant shipping. The Italian frogmen originally used a Spanish villa (Villa Carmela) located two miles (3km) from Gibraltar owned by an Italian officer who had married a Spanish woman named Conchita Ramognino. Their base was shifted later to the Italian tanker SS Olterra, interned in Algeciras.|$|E

5|$|Maryland {{became a}} prime tobacco {{exporting}} colony in the mid-Atlantic and, for a time, <b>a</b> <b>refuge</b> for Catholic settlers, as George Calvert had hoped. Under {{the rule of}} the Lords Baltimore, thousands of British Catholics emigrated to Maryland, establishing some of the oldest Catholic communities in what later became the United States. Catholic rule in Maryland was eventually nullified by the re-assertion of royal control over the colony.|$|E
5|$|Nasser {{played a}} {{significant}} part in the strengthening of African solidarity in the late 1950s and early 1960s, although his continental leadership role had increasingly passed to Algeria since 1962. During this period, Nasser made Egypt <b>a</b> <b>refuge</b> for anti-colonial leaders from several African countries and allowed the broadcast of anti-colonial propaganda from Cairo. Beginning in 1958, Nasser had {{a key role in}} the discussions among African leaders that led to the establishment of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) in 1963.|$|E

5|$|Palmyra {{was used}} as <b>a</b> <b>refuge</b> by Shirkuh II's grandson, al-Ashraf Musa, who allied himself with the Mongol king Hulagu Khan and fled after the Mongol defeat in the 1260 Battle of Ain Jalut against the Mamluks. Al-Ashraf Musa asked the Mamluk sultan Qutuz for pardon and was {{accepted}} as a vassal. Al-Ashraf Musa died in 1263 without an heir, bringing the Homs district under direct Mamluk rule.|$|E
5|$|The {{area that}} is now Providence was first settled in June 1636 by Roger Williams {{and was one of}} the {{original}} Thirteen Colonies of the United States.

Providence quickly became <b>a</b> <b>refuge</b> for persecuted religious dissenters, as Williams himself had been exiled from Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|The {{closure of}} the border region for nearly 40years created a haven for {{wildlife}} in some places. Although parts of the East German {{side of the border}} were farmed, intensive farming of the kind practised elsewhere in Germany was absent and large areas were untouched by agriculture. Conservationists became aware as early as the 1970s that the border had become <b>a</b> <b>refuge</b> for rare species of animals and plants. Their findings led the Bavarian government to begin a programme of buying land along the border to ensure its protection from development.|$|E

5|$|The {{second son}} of Irish Catholic parents, Carroll was educated in France {{as a lawyer}} before {{returning}} to England, where he pursued the first steps in a legal career. Before that career developed, he secured a position as Attorney General of the young colony of Maryland. Its founder George Calvert and his descendants intended it as <b>a</b> <b>refuge</b> for Catholics.|$|E
5|$|A land {{of green}} fields for crop {{cultivation}} and cattle rearing limits the space {{available for the}} establishment of native wild species. Hedgerows, however, traditionally used for maintaining and demarcating land boundaries, act as <b>a</b> <b>refuge</b> for native wild flora. This ecosystem stretches across the countryside and acts as a network of connections to preserve remnants of the ecosystem that once covered the island. Subsidies under the Common Agricultural Policy, which supported agricultural practices that preserved hedgerow environments, are undergoing reforms. The Common Agricultural Policy had in the past subsidised potentially destructive agricultural practices, for example by emphasising production without placing limits on indiscriminate use of fertilisers and pesticides; but reforms have gradually decoupled subsidies from production levels and introduced environmental and other requirements.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the ninth}} century Alfred the Great started to revive {{learning}} and monasticism, and this work was carried on by his grandson, King Æthelstan (924–939). Kings before Edgar (959–975) did not take the view, which was adopted by Æthelwold and his circle, that the only worthwhile religious life was Benedictine monasticism. When Gérard of Brogne reformed the Abbey of Saint Bertin in Saint-Omer in 944, dissident monks found <b>a</b> <b>refuge</b> in England under King Edmund (939–946). Before the tenth-century reform, the lines between secular clergy and monastics were sometimes blurred. There are cases of communities of monks established to provide pastoral care, and clergy in some secular establishments lived according to monastic rules.|$|E

5|$|Besides horse racing, Rosecroft {{has allowed}} other activities. The Old School Boxing Gym is located there, {{and the track}} has hosted amateur boxing matches for several years. The gym served as <b>a</b> <b>refuge</b> to {{children}} in the area. Before his heavyweight championship tenure, George Foreman beat Sylvester Dullaire at Rosecroft on July 14, 1969. Then-undefeated boxer Seth Mitchell also fought at Rosecroft in 2009. Rosecroft made news when it decided to host an all-female night of boxing in 2009. In 1974, Rosecroft Raceway hosted professional motorcycle races. In 2012, Rosecroft hosted the 46th Annual Cherry Blossom Rugby Tournament. The area also serves large banquets. Other community activities include an annual Senior Citizen Day, hosting flea markets, fundraising for politicians, and hosting Governor's Day.|$|E
5|$|Bonifácio was {{dismissed}} {{from his position}} in December 1833 and replaced by another guardian. PedroII spent his days studying, with only two hours set aside for amusements. Intelligent, {{he was able to}} acquire knowledge with great ease. However, the hours of study were strenuous and the preparation for his role as monarch was demanding. He had few friends of his age and limited contact with his sisters. All that coupled with the sudden loss of his parents gave PedroII an unhappy and lonely upbringing. The environment in which he was raised turned him into a shy and needy person who saw books as <b>a</b> <b>refuge</b> and retreat from the real world.|$|E
5|$|Calvert took an {{interest}} in the British colonisation of the Americas, at first for commercial reasons and later to create <b>a</b> <b>refuge</b> for persecuted English Catholics. He became the proprietor of Avalon, the first sustained English settlement on the southeastern peninsula on the island of Newfoundland (off the eastern coast of modern Canada). Discouraged by its cold and sometimes inhospitable climate and the sufferings of the settlers, he looked for a more suitable spot further south and sought a new royal charter to settle the region, which would become the state of Maryland. Calvert died five weeks before the new Charter was sealed, leaving the settlement of the Maryland colony to his son Cecil (1605–1675). His second son Leonard Calvert (1606–1647) was the first colonial governor of the Province of Maryland.|$|E
