Probability of bullet penetration increases as the axis of bullet movement becomes perpendicular to the target surface; but penetration may create a depression or crater within which the bullet may ricochet more than once, possibly following the arc of the crater floor to depart the crater at a greater angle from the original surface than the angle of incidence. In an extreme case, a strong, cohesive bullet striking a nearly perpendicular elastic surface may ricochet directly back at the shooter.

In this paper, we propose a generalized three-dimensional (3 D) nonstationary channel model, in which the scatterers are assumed to be distributed around the transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx) on a two-sphere model.

Moreover, the TV autocorrelation function (ACF) and Doppler power spectrum density (DPSD) of the proposed nonstationary channel model are calculated by using signal processing tools, for example, fast Fourier transform (FFT) and short-time Fourier transform (STFT).

30|$|Multi-user {{beamforming}} and precoding {{approaches are}} in general {{very sensitive to}} CSI imperfections at the transmitter. Most existing approaches are not efficiently applicable in high-mobility situations, since channel matrices change so quickly over time that already small processing delays can lead to substantial inter-user interference. In this paper, we provide a remedy to this problem by considering non-coherent beamforming/precoding in the angular domain with robustness w.r.t. angular uncertainty. In addition to improving the robustness of the beamformer/precoder, this has the further advantage that only a minimal amount of CSIT is required, namely the <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure</b> <b>of</b> the most significant specular components together with their respective gains as obtained from a low-rank basis decomposition. We show that the relevant CSI can efficiently be quantized by applying {{a variant of the}} OMP algorithm. Naturally, under ideal circumstances of perfect CSIT, such a non-coherent approach cannot compete with coherent methods in terms of the achievable multiplexing gain. Also, it is not well suited for strong scattering environments with a large number of significant specular components because the low-rank channel decomposition has a large residual error in such cases. Nevertheless, the proposed technique can provide substantial improvements in situations with few dominant specular components, as for example expected in the millimeter wave regime, and it enables robust multi-user beamforming/precoding with low requirements on CSIT accuracy.|$|R
30|$|We {{propose a}} novel method for {{constructing}} beam codebooks, i.e., {{a set of}} beamforming weights, {{to be used for}} beam sweeping and data transmission in mmWave massive MIMO channels.

In particular, the cumulative distribution function <b>of</b> these <b>angles</b> is used to sectorize the angular beam space in order to design the beams. We first present a general closed-form construction of beam codebooks for an arbitrary distribution and then tailor the results to the Laplace distribution. We consider both narrow and broad beams. The resulting beams are a priori better adapted to the channel statistics and thus enhance the spectral efficiency of the transmission as compared to the state-of-the-art beam designs. Finally, we investigate the performance of the design and also present some analytical bounds quantifying the inherent loss of a directional beamforming compared to the optimal beamforming with perfect channel state information at the transmitter.|$|R
40|$|Millimeter wave {{provides}} a very promising approach {{for meeting the}} ever-growing traffic demand in next generation wireless networks. To utilize this band, {{it is crucial to}} obtain the channel state information in order to perform beamforming and combining to compensate for severe path loss. In contrast to lower frequencies, a typical millimeter wave channel consists of a few dominant paths. Thus it is generally sufficient to estimate the path gains, <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure</b> (AoDs), and <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> arrival (AoAs) of those paths. Proposed in this paper is a dual timescale model to characterize abrupt channel changes (e. g., blockage) and slow variations of AoDs and AoAs. This work focuses on tracking the slow variations and detecting abrupt changes. A Kalman filter based tracking algorithm and an abrupt change detection method are proposed. The tracking algorithm is compared with the adaptive algorithm due to Alkhateeb, Ayach, Leus and Heath (2014) in the case with single radio frequency chain. Simulation results show that to achieve the same tracking performance, the proposed algorithm requires much lower signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) and much fewer pilots than the other algorithm. Moreover, the change detection method can always detect abrupt changes with moderate number of pilots and SNR. Comment: 6 pages, 7 figures, submitted to ICC 201...|$|R

With the recent developments of high-mobility wireless communication systems, e. g., high-speed train (HST) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V 2 V) communication systems, the ability of conventional stationary channel models to mimic the underlying channel characteristics has widely been challenged. Measurements have demonstrated that the current standardized channel models, like IMT-Advanced (IMT-A) and WINNER II channel models, offer stationary intervals that are noticeably longer than those in measured HST channels. In this paper, we propose a non-stationary channel model with time-varying parameters including the number of clusters, the powers and the delays of the clusters, the <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure</b> (AoDs), and the <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> arrival (AoAs). Based on the proposed non-stationary IMT-A channel model, important statistical properties, i. e., the local spatial cross-correlation function (CCF) and local temporal autocorrelation function (ACF) are derived and analyzed.

Results show that the achievable ergodic SE logarithmically increases with the number of BS antennas and converges to a value in the high SNR regime. To improve the achievable ergodic SE, we also propose a user scheduling scheme based on feedback of users’ AoD information and obtain the maximum achievable ergodic SE. Furthermore, we consider a dense user scenario where every user’s AoD becomes nearly identical and then derive the system’s minimum achievable SE.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a Doppler pre-compensation scheme for high-mobility {{orthogonal}} frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) uplink, where a high-speed terminal transmits {{signals to the}} base station (BS). Considering that the time-varying multipath channel consists of multiple Doppler frequency offsets (DFOs) with different <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>departures</b> (AoDs), we propose to perform DFO pre-compensation at the transmitter with a large-scale uniform linear array (ULA). The transmitted signal passes through a beamforming network with high-spatial resolution to produce multiple parallel branches. Each branch transmits signal towards one direction thus it is affected by one dominant DFO when passing over the time-varying channel. Therefore, we can compensate the DFO for each branch at the transmitter previously. Theoretical analysis for the Doppler spread of the equivalent uplink channel is also conducted. It is found that {{when the number of}} transmit antennas is sufficiently large, the time-variation of channel can be efficiently suppressed. Therefore, the performance will not degrade significantly if applying the conventional time-invariant channel estimation and equalization methods at the receiver. Simulation results are provided to verify the proposed scheme. Comment: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv: 1701. 0322...|$|R
