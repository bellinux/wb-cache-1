50|$|The {{striking}} {{building with}} its crimson paint and extensive decoration, is situated with its eaves to the Minster Square (Freiburg im Breisgau).The high housetop with two attic stories is lined by crow-stepped gables. From the outside the four arcades with an <b>access</b> <b>balcony</b> facing the Minster are an eye-catching {{feature of the}} building. At ground level one enters through a gate a hall, which opens onto an inner courtyard. This hall is only {{open to the public}} on special occasions. Situated above the hall is one room that takes up the entire upper floor. The room has so-called arched curtain windows in the late Gothic style with the windows opening onto the market place. Two delicate, polygonal bay windows with colored tiles flank the arched curtain windows {{on the outside of the}} building. The front of the building is decorated with sculptures and the crest of the House of Habsburg, which were carved by Hans Sixt von Staufen between 1520 and 1531. The sculptures all have a baldachin and depict Maximilian I (Holy Roman Emperor), Philip I of Castile, Charles V (Holy Roman Emperor) and Ferdinand I (Holy Roman Emperor). The statues are replicas as the originals are stored away from the elements in the Basler Hof. The five emblems under each of the bay windows depict territorial dominions belonging to the House of Habsburg.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this master thesis is to {{investigate}} the tenability limits on the egress path on an <b>access</b> <b>balcony</b> when not following all the given pre accepted solutions. The analysis construction deviates {{from some of the}} pre accepted solutions given for TEK 10 to investigate if the fire safety level is satisfying. According to the standard NS 3901 Requirements for risk assessment of fire in construction works, a comparative qualitative analysis has been done by using FDS. The conditions that are analyzed is the time for critical temperature and heat radiation to occur where fire simulations in FDS has given the available safe egress time for the different analysis constructions. The available safe egress time has been compared to the required safe egress time and the fire safety is commented based on whether the margin between these two are satisfying. The visibility on the <b>access</b> <b>balcony</b> has been commented based on the influence from the window dimension. It has been simulated two different fire growths based on the recommendations from different countries in order to comment on how the choose of design fire affects the results. The results show that if the analysis construction deviate from the pre accepted solution for installation of sprinklers on the <b>access</b> <b>balcony,</b> the fire safety will still be satisfying. If it also deviates from the pre accepted solution for installation of a window with fire rating on the <b>access</b> <b>balcony,</b> the fire safety is satisfied, given a functional sprinkler in the apartment...|$|E
40|$|Access {{balconies}} {{are commonly}} used at residential buildings. This provides access to apartments {{as well as an}} escape route in the event of fire. Since the <b>access</b> <b>balcony</b> is an escape route the structure also assigns certain requirements of the fire resistance. Part of the aims {{of this study was to}} evaluate temperatures arising in an external steel column of a typical <b>access</b> <b>balcony.</b> The calculations of temperatures were made by combining the calculation programs FDS and TASEF. The adiabatic surface temperature was calculated with output from FDS and was then further used as input in TASEF. Another part of the aims was also to assess the combination of the programs to see if it is suitable to use in design situations. The object of the study was to investigate how constant heat release rates of different values influence the steel temperature of the columns. The columns were assumed to lose a significant level of its strength when exceeding a critical temperature of 550 °C. The geometry of the case study consisted of a fire compartment with one opening, where an <b>access</b> <b>balcony</b> was located above the opening. A method where it was possible to change the dimensions and material of the columns subsequently was used and therefore the columns were not given any dimensions in FDS. The proposed positions of the columns were along the edge of the balcony, at the same distance from the façade. One column was located in the centreline of the opening and one at the side of the opening. The temperature of the steel was calculated in two dimensions at three different heights. In FDS three different simulations were performed and the heat release rate was the only parameter changed. Constant heat release rates of 6, 8 and 10 MW were used but only the simulation of 6 MW was later able to be used for an analysis of the steel temperature. Results obtained from FDS and TASEF showed then a maximum steel temperature of 820 °C after one hour at the top of the column located at the centreline of the opening. At a corresponding time and height of the column, placed at the side of the opening, the maximum temperature reached 750 °C. The maximum temperatures always occurred at the sides turned towards the opening. At all sides towards the opening the steel temperature exceeded the critical temperature. The critical temperature was not reached at the two lowest heights at sides turned away from the opening. At the sides turned away from the opening it is obvious that heat transfer within the column has occurred since the adiabatic surface temperature was lower than the corresponding calculated steel temperature. The results from the column in the centreline of the opening from the calculation programs were used in a comparison with corresponding results from the Eurocodes EN 1991 - 1 - 2 and EN 1993 - 1 - 2. The steel temperature of the column and gas temperatures in the fire compartment and along the balcony was compared. Results according to the Eurocode generally showed lower temperatures. A reason could be the chain of assumptions made in the calculation procedure and these may lead to an unrealistic result. The numerical model with the use of FDS to obtain parameters for adiabatic surface temperature and then use this as input in TASEF turned out to work well. Validation against full-scale tests was wanted and performed to the extent it was possible. A lot of parameters in the tests were different from the case study, which made the comparison problematic. Differences in the tests were for example the heat release rate, the location of the columns or that the balcony was missing in the geometry.

5000|$|In 1905, {{work began}} on the station {{building}} itself, starting at the west end and progressing towards the main dome. Ballarat builder Peter Rodger was awarded the £93,000 contract. The station was originally to have been faced in stone, but this was considered too costly, and red brick with cement render details {{was used for the}} main building instead. Grey granite from Harcourt was used for many details on the Flinders street side at ground level [...] "in view of the importance of this great public work". The southern facade of the main building above ground level was constructed of lightweight timber frame clad with zinc sheets scored into large blocks, and painted red, giving the appearance of large bricks. This was done in order to turn what would have been open <b>access</b> <b>balconies</b> inside the train shed into corridors.Work on the dome started in 1906. The structure required heavy foundations as it extended over railway tracks. In May 1908 work was progressing slower than expected, with the expected completion date of April 1909 slipping. Rodger's contract was terminated in August 1908. A Royal Commission was appointed in May 1910, finding that Rodger could be held accountable for the slow progress in 1908, but he should be compensated for the difficulties before then. The Way and Works Branch of the Victorian Railways took over the project, the station being essentially finished by mid-1909. The verandah along Flinders Street and the concourse roof and verandah along Swanston Street were not completed until after the official opening in 1910.|$|R
