50|$|If {{a student}} is unhappy with a grade they {{received}} {{on any of the}} exam results, they may appeal the decision made by the SEC. They need to pay a fee (in 2010 the fee was set at €32 per exam) and the principal of the school writes a letter of appeal application to the State Examinations Commission, stating the candidate's name, exam number and the exam they would like to appeal. There is a deadline to appeal, usually 14-21 days after the results are published, in which the student's application must be made. The appeal results are usually handed out mid-November. The grade that is received this time is final, and no more appeals can be made. If the candidate's grade did not change, no further action will be taken. However, if a change did occur, then the candidate will be refunded the <b>appeal</b> <b>fee</b> via a Cheque made out to the principal of the school. These refunds take time to be issued, but in an appeal made in September of one year, the refund was issued as late as March in the following year.|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} diploma {{work was}} to obtain {{a review of the}} appeal process in Sweden under the Planning and Building Act and the {{possibilities}} of appeal in the planning and building permit process. The work was intended to identify potential problems surrounding the appeal process and possible efficiency measures. The goal was to form a report that provides a satisfactory overview of the appeal process in theory and practical application as well as provide relevant concrete proposals on how the appeal process can be streamlined. Background and facts surrounding the work were taken from different types of literature and through several interviews with representatives in government, industry and politicians. The main problems related to the appeal process are in the long processing times and the high number of appeals. There is a great interest to streamline the appeals process and {{the government is going to}} launch studies in which possible future actions will be investigated. It is possible to appeal for up to two instances before you need a so called “leave to appeal” in order for your complaint to be passed on to the next instance. Appeals may be made for several reasons and in these instances of appeal there is no risk for either economic or legal sanctions for the complainant. The negligible risk in the appeal results in an exploitation of the appeal system. The introduction of an <b>appeal</b> <b>fee</b> may reduce the number of appeals. A fee may reduce the overuse and provide an effective appeals process and thus a more efficient planning and building permit process...|$|E

The chapter begins by introducing the basic economic framework for studying litigation and out-of-court settlement. One set of issues addressed is positive (or descriptive) in nature. Under what conditions will someone decide to file suit? What determines how much is spent on a lawsuit? When do cases settle out of court? Important normative issues are also addressed. Are the litigation decisions made by private parties {{in the interest of}} society as a whole? Next, the chapter surveys some of the more active areas in the litigation literature. Topics include rules of evidence, loser-pays rules, <b>appeals,</b> contingent <b>fees</b> for attorneys, alternative dispute resolution, class actions, and plea bargaining. litigation, trials, courts, settlement, bargaining...|$|R

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "To ensure that people claiming disability insurance benefits can obtain legal representation at a fair price, the Social Security Act requires that the Social Security Administration (SSA) regulate the fees that attorneys charge people to represent their disability claims before the agency. Inefficiencies in the current process increase both {{the time it takes}} to pay the attorney fees and the costs of administration. One segment of attorney fee processing [...] the fee approval process [...] was substantially simplified in 1991. Systems support could streamline the second segment of the processing [...] the fee payment [...] thus lowering the annual administrative costs and cutting processing time. By automating this final segment of the fee processing, SSA could help improve customer service for both claimants and their attorneys. GAO found that despite internal recommendations for a new system, SSA has repeatedly postponed its plans to improve the attorney fee payment process. Indeed, even though these improvements have been part of SSA's system's plans since 1998, SSA has yet to establish a firm schedule for carrying out its plans. Additionally, although SSA has a draft plan for improving the process, agency officials told GAO that the details of the plan have not been completed and SSA has yet to complete a cost estimate for the project. There are also other gaps in the plan [...] such as not creating an attorney master file or establishing an electronic connection between the payment processing staff and the Office of Hearings and <b>Appeals</b> <b>fee</b> approval staff [...] where taking additional actions could improve the process. Furthermore, SSA's performance plan did not have goals related to attorney fees [...] neither for cost reduction of the program nor payment timeliness. SSA would need such goals as part of its current planning effort for improving the attorney fee payment process as well as for its future operations. Without such quantifiable goals, future efforts to track and oversee SSA's progress in these areas will be difficult. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to raise {{awareness}} of the authority of federal courts to certify questions to the Arkansas Supreme Court and of some of the undeveloped legal issues surrounding the rule itself. The certification process, allowed under Arkansas Supreme Court Rule 6 - 8, is neither simple nor inexpensive, but it will most likely be less complicated and expensive than other alternatives available to a federal court and litigants involved in federal court litigation when a question of unclear Arkansas state law presents itself. Certification is treated as an <b>appeal.</b> Therefore, <b>fees</b> and costs are the same as in any other civil appeal docketed before the Arkansas Supreme Court and are equally divided between the parties unless otherwise ordered by the certifying court in its certification order. The certification process that is now allowed under Arkansas Supreme Court Rule 6 - 8 (1) provides a practical and efficient method by which federal courts can discern the state laws of Arkansas when they are faced with an unclear question of Arkansas state law and (2) allows the Arkansas Supreme Court the opportunity to decide important and significant matters of Arkansas state law...|$|R
50|$|In 1972, Congress amended Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. § 2000e, Chapter 21, Subchapter VI) {{to allow}} {{individuals}} to sue state governments for money damages for {{discrimination based on}} race, color, religion, sex, national origin. The plaintiffs, a group of male retirees, sued the state of Connecticut for sex discrimination against them in its retirement policies. Connecticut invoked its Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity, and the District Court, and Court of Appeals both allowed only injunctive relief, denying monetary recovery (although the Court of <b>Appeals</b> permitted attorney's <b>fees).</b> Both of those courts pointed to Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651 (1974), a prior United States Supreme Court case which had held that the Eleventh Amendment prohibits a federal court from ordering a U.S. state to pay money to an individual wronged by the state. The plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court.|$|R
500|$|Following {{discussions between}} the Office of Fair Trading, the Financial Ombudsman Service, the Financial Services Authority {{and the major}} banks, {{proceedings}} were issued on 27 July 2007 in a test case against the banks to determine the legality and enforceability of certain charges relating to unauthorised overdrafts. It is argued that these are contrary to the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999; Schedule 2(e) of which gives a non-exhaustive list of terms which may be regarded as unfair, such as a term requiring a consumer who fails in his obligation to pay a disproportionately high sum in compensation. Penalty charges are irrecoverable at common law. The precedent for this was Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co. Ltd. v New Garage and Motor Co. Ltd. [...] AC 79 along with Murray v Leisure Play [...] EWCA Civ 963, where it was held that a contractual party can only recover damages for an actual loss or liquidated losses. The Royal Bank of Scotland Group maintained that its charges were fair and enforceable and stated it intended to defend its position vigorously. On 24 April 2008, the High Court found that although these charges could not constitute penalties, they are challengeable under the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 and the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999. On 26 February 2009, the Court of <b>Appeal</b> ruled that <b>fees</b> for unauthorised overdrafts and bounced cheques are subject to regulation by the OFT under these rules.|$|R
5000|$|In April 2006, Hearts player Andy Webster {{was placed}} on the {{transfer}} list by the club after Webster's agent attempted to engineer a move to Rangers. In late June, Romanov confirmed that Webster, as well as teammate Rudi Skácel, were in talks to agree a move to Southampton. Days later, Romanov reported the pair to FIFA after the players failed to turn up at the airport to fly to Austria for pre-season training. Later in the month, Webster invoked a new ruling in the FIFA laws which allowed players to free themselves from their contract and join a club in another country, providing they were in the third year of a four-year contract and gave his current club due notice, and was set to sign for Wigan Athletic. In September, the transfer was finally ratified by FIFA. despite a late attempt by Hearts to re-sign Webster. After playing just five games for Wigan, however, he moved to Rangers on loan in January 2007, and was given permission to play following a complaint by Hearts. In May 2007, the tribunal to decide the compensation due to Hearts took place, with Hearts seeking up to £5 million, but were eventually rewarded just £625,000. Scottish Professional Footballers' Association Fraser Wishart described the ruling as a [...] "landmark". In January 2008, after an <b>appeal,</b> the compensation <b>fee</b> was reduced to £150,000 by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). In 2007, Matuzalém invoked the same clause as Webster to break out of his contract with Shakhtar Donetsk, signing for Real Zaragoza. Matuzalém was found to be in breach of contract, and he and Zaragoza were ordered to pay £11 million in compensation to Shakhtar.|$|R
