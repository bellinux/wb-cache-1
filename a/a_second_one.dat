5|$|Before the First World War, the Spanish Army {{bought a}} Schneider-Brillié in 1909 {{to be used}} in Melilla, where armed {{conflict}} with local tribes was going on. This was a French bus platform that was fitted with an armoured body, to be used as troop transport. Although it was big, slow and its performance was not good, the Spanish Army learned the value of armored vehicles and bought <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>one.</b> Spanish Army officers appreciated the advantages of using advanced weapons technology in the Colonial War in Spanish Morocco and followed First World War advances.|$|E

Then, an emissary {{came out with a}} white flag to negotiate the terms of the fort’s surrender. General Maison replied that the terms had been negotiated {{at the beginning of the}} month at Patras. He added that he did not trust a group of besieged men who had not respected a first agreement to respect <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>one.</b> He gave the garrison half an hour to evacuate the fort, without arms or baggage.

5|$|Similarly to Sonic Advance 1 and 2 before it, Advance 3 is a fast-paced 2D platformer. The player {{controls}} {{one of five}} characters {{simultaneously with}} <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>one</b> as a sidekick; alternately, a second player joins and one controls each character. The two characters run and jump {{through a series of}} seven levels, destroying robots along the way. The player collects rings in levels and boss battles as a form of health: upon being hit by an enemy or harmful obstacle, the player's rings will scatter and can be recollected. Being hit while carrying no rings, being crushed by an obstacle, or falling into a bottomless pit causes death; running out of lives incurs a game over screen.|$|E

5|$|The Israeli forces {{amounted}} {{to less than}} a brigade of armor, an infantry brigade, a paratroop battalion, an engineering battalion and five battalions of artillery. The units were divided into four task forces. The largest of these was to cross the Allenby Bridge and reach Karameh from the south; <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>one</b> was to cross the Damiyah Bridge, and reach Karameh from the north, thus completing a pincer move. Meanwhile, paratroopers were to be lifted by helicopters into the town while the fourth force would make a diversionary attack at King Abdullah Bridge to draw the Jordanian forces from Karameh and to cover the main attack.|$|E
5|$|The Premetro was {{originally}} intended to include a number of feeder lines to the Underground network, including <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>one</b> to Line E and ones on lines C and D. The Premetro project was largely abandoned since it occurred in Argentina's transition to democracy from the military junta and then the privatisation of the railways, which was a difficult time economically for the country, and only Line E2 was built. New Premetro feeder lines have been proposed in recent years, however, {{the role of the}} network has given way to the new Metrobus network which covers many of the same routes originally intended for the Premetro.|$|E
5|$|The five {{ships in}} Yugoslav service were {{captured}} by Italian forces during the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia and commissioned in the Regia Marina as the Arbe class.

Of the five former JKRM ships, one was seized and operated by the Kriegsmarine until it was lost; <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>one</b> was {{handed over to the}} Navy of the Independent State of Croatia and lost in 1944. The remaining three were returned to Yugoslavia and were later commissioned in the new Yugoslav Navy.|$|E

The bank was inaugurated on February 1, 1890, with Juan Róspide y Navarro and José Manuel López Sainz as governor and vice governor respectively. The Royal Decree permitted the issuing of paper money in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 and 200 pesos. These banknotes were manufactured by the American Bank Note Company. The original bank {{was located in}} San Juan, with <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>one</b> being established in Mayagüez in 1894. Until 1898, the institution issued four series A, B, C and D, though apparently C was put into production after D and didn't circulate under Spanish control. Series D began distribution on December 1, 1894; this became {{the first time that}} the lamb, which had continued being used since the days of the Sociedad Anónima de Crédito Mercantil de Puerto Rico, was replaced by the profile of Maria Christina of Austria. The Ministerio de Ultramar issued 1 peso notes in 1895.|$|E
5|$|The Effects of Hurricane Isaac in Florida were severe local {{flooding}} in South Florida and tornadoes {{in the central}} and northern portions {{of the state in}} August2012. Hurricane Isaac formed from a tropical wave while located east of the Lesser Antilles on August21, 2012. The storm moved westward, crossed through the Leeward Islands, and entered the Caribbean Sea on August22. Isaac initially struggled to intensify and defied predictions of it strengthening into a hurricane. The storm made its first landfall in Haiti as a midgrade tropical storm prior to making <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>one</b> in Cuba later that day. It remained somewhat disorganized while moving through the Straits of Florida and passed near the Florida Keys on August27. The storm threatened to strike the Tampa Bay Area during the 2012 Republican National Convention and move ashore in the Florida Panhandle as a major hurricane. However, it continued northwestward and avoided landfall in the state. The storm finally became a hurricane late on August28. Isaac made two landfalls in Louisiana on August29, the first near the mouth of the Mississippi River and the other near Port Fourchon. The storm steadily weakened and eventually dissipated over Missouri on September1.|$|E
5|$|World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) {{acquired}} Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) and its {{video library}} in 2003, and later began reintroducing ECW by utilizing ECW library content for DVDs and releasing {{a series of}} books.

WWE organized <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>One</b> Night Stand pay-per-view the following year. In May 2006 WWE announced the launch of ECW as a stand-alone brand, congruous to Raw and SmackDown!, with its own show on the Sci Fi channel.
