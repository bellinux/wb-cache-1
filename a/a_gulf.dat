5|$|A {{powerful}} Senate Select Committee {{oversaw the}} NCDC and renowned British architect Sir William Holford {{was brought in}} to fine-tune Griffin's original plans. He changed the central basin's geometry so that it was no longer a segment of circle; he converted the southern straight edge into a polygonal shape with three edges and inserted <b>a</b> <b>gulf</b> on the northern shore.

5|$|On October8, a {{weak area}} of low {{pressure}} developed within a monsoon trough over the extreme {{eastern edge of}} the Pacific basin. Environmental conditions ahead of the system were forecast to become gradually favorable for tropical cyclogenesis. Situated near Costa Rica, scattered convection accompanied the well-defined system. This low became less defined over the following days while remaining in the same general area. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring the system for long-term cyclogenesis on October13, at which time the low was situated 150mi (240km) south of Guatemala. Organization was prolonged and slow; however, the convergence of a Kelvin wave and <b>a</b> <b>Gulf</b> of Tehuantepec gap wind event on October15 spurred a significant increase in convection.|$|E

5|$|The Macdonald family {{obtained}} complete {{ownership of}} the park in 1951. After leaving Idlewild, the Mellon family also abandoned the Ligonier Valley Railroad, in decline after the closing of area coal mines and decreased passenger traffic. The railroad ceased operations in 1952. Although the park originally depended on the railroad, its closing had no effect. In 1913, the Lincoln Highway had been established as the first cross-country auto route, stretching from Times Square, New York City, to Lincoln Park, San Francisco. It passed directly by Idlewild on what is now U.S. Route 30. As automobile traffic to the park increased, several parking lots and <b>a</b> <b>Gulf</b> Oil gas station, a Mellon company, were added in the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|The zone where land meets sea {{is known}} as the coast and the part between the lowest spring tides and the upper limit reached by {{splashing}} waves is the shore. A beach is the accumulation of sand or shingle on the shore. A headland is a point of land jutting out into the sea and a larger promontory {{is known as}} a cape. The indentation of a coastline—especially between two headlands—is a bay; a small bay with a narrow inlet is a cove and a large bay or bay-shaped sea may be referred to as <b>a</b> <b>gulf.</b> Coastlines are influenced by a number of factors including the strength of the waves arriving on the shore, the gradient of the land margin, the composition and hardness of the coastal rock, the inclination of the off-shore slope, and the changes of the level of the land due to local uplift or submergence. Normally, waves roll towards the shore at the rate of six to eight per minute. These are known as constructive waves as they tend to move material up the beach and have little erosive effect. Storm waves arrive on shore in rapid succession and are known as destructive waves, as their swash moves beach material seawards. Under their influence, the sand and shingle on the beach is ground together and abraded. Around high tide, the power of a storm wave impacting on the foot of a cliff has a shattering effect as air in cracks and crevices is compressed and then expands rapidly with release of pressure. At the same time, sand and pebbles have an erosive effect as they are thrown against the rocks. Along with other weathering processes such as frost, this tends to undercut the cliff. Gradually, a wave-cut platform develops {{at the foot of the}} cliff and this has a protective effect, reducing further wave-erosion.|$|E

One clear benefactor of the fall of the Gulf Cartel is its rival group, Los Zetas. It is also possible that the several within the Gulf Cartel may decide to join the Sinaloa Cartel or Los Zetas, although the latter seems unlikely given the bitter sentiment both groups have planted.|$|E

25|$|Following the German {{invasion}} of Norway in April 1940 {{as part of}} Operation Weserübung, the Norwegian Campaign of April–June 1940 saw significant British forces committed to action {{for the first time}} in World War II. Flaws in the command system quickly began to show. War Cabinet meetings dragged on at great length to little effect, as did meetings of the Chiefs of Staff, both to Ironside's great frustration. He also found it hard to cope with Churchill's mood swings and insistence on micromanagement of the campaign, and <b>a</b> <b>gulf</b> began to grow between the two. Ironside's main contribution to resolving the Norwegian campaign was to insist on a withdrawal when the situation worsened, and he pushed through the evacuation of central Norway at the end of April despite ministerial ambivalence.|$|E
25|$|In a November {{afternoon}} of 1999, Cárdenas learned that <b>a</b> <b>Gulf</b> Cartel informant was being transported through Matamoros, Tamaulipas, by the FBI and DEA. According {{to the story}} mentioned in the interviews 11 years after this life-or-death incident, the DEA agent Joe DuBois and FBI agent Daniel Fuentes were riding in a white Ford Bronco with diplomatic plates along the streets of Matamoros, Tamaulipas. For years, both were working for the disarticulation of the cartels in Mexico, and both knew how the drug cartels worked south of the border. In {{the back seat of}} the car, a Mexican informant from a local newspaper on crime coverage guided the two agents and gave them a tour on the city's drug routes and on the homes of the drug lords of the city. They even cruised by Cárdenas' house, a pink-colored mansion with tall walls, security cameras, armed guards and roof-snipers. Within moments, according to DuBois, a Lincoln Continental was on their tail, then a stolen pickup truck with Texan plates. The federal agents were cut off and surrounded by at least five vehicles, including one by a former state police officer. Just yards away from Matamoros' police department, the agents were surrounded by a convoy of gunmen from the Gulf Cartel, which included Costilla Sánchez. Some wore police and military uniforms. Nearby, other men, also in police uniform, directed traffic.|$|E
