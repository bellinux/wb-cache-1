5|$|Mulder {{believes}} that the entity travels from victim to victim like a contagion. At his request, Scully performs an autopsy on Chantara's body at the morgue. During the procedure, a conversation between Scully and the coroner's assistant (Tara Karsian) causes the latter to panic about a Hantavirus outbreak. The entity suddenly kills her with the disease. When Mulder discusses the death with Scully, he realizes that Wetzel {{is in danger of}} being revisited by the entity. The agents and police return to the crack house, where the entity has trapped an injured Wetzel in an upstairs room. The agents are unable to enter the room until dawn comes, when the entity disappears and spares Wetzel's life. After the incident is over, Scully expresses her sympathies to Mulder that being filmed by a national television crew did not provide the public exposure to paranormal phenomena that he had hoped. However, Mulder remains hopeful, noting that it <b>all</b> <b>comes</b> down to how the production crew edits the footage together.|$|E

25|$|The next eleven poems {{relate to}} the loves of Sulpicia and Cerinthus. Sulpicia was a Roman lady of high station and, {{according}} to Moritz Haupt's conjecture, the daughter of Valeria, Messalla's sister. The Sulpicia elegies divide into two groups. The first comprises iv. 2-6, containing ninety-four lines, in which {{the theme of the}} attachment is worked up into five graceful poems. The second, iv. 8-12, consists of Sulpicia's own letters. They are very short, only forty lines in all; but they have a unique interest as being the only love poems by a Roman woman that have survived. Their frank and passionate outpourings remind us of Catullus. The style and metrical handling betray a novice in poetical writing. The thirteenth poem (twenty-four lines) claims to be by Tibullus; but it is hardly more than a cento from Tibullus and Propertius. The fourteenth is a little epigram of four lines with nothing to determine its authorship. Last of <b>all</b> <b>comes</b> the epigram or fragment of Domitius Marsus already referred to.|$|E

500|$|... "Nothing Really Matters" [...] {{has been}} noted as one of Madonna's most underrated singles to date. Louis Virtel from NewNowNext listed the song at number 94 on their Top 100 Madonna Songs list, stating, [...] "Copping both new-age maxims and Beatle sentiments ('Everything I give you <b>all</b> <b>comes</b> back to me'), 'Nothing Really Matters' is as queer and curious as a red patent-leather geisha costume." [...] The Gaultier kimono has been cited by several {{publications}} as one of Madonna's most notable re-inventions and looks, including fashion magazines like InStyle, Elle and Harper's Bazaar. Alongside this, the kimono has been {{recognized as one of}} the Grammy's best and worst looks.|$|E

I'm on to the next chapter very soon and I'm excited to see what the future brings." [...] After Danough's departure he was quickly replaced by Jona Weinhofen of Australian band I Killed The Prom Queen – one of several factors that led that band to split up.|$|E

500|$|Zack Handlen's July 2009 {{review for}} The A.V. Club in July 2009 gave the episode a grade of A. Cyrano Jones was Handlen's least {{favorite}} part of the episode, and with the exception of that character, {{it was one of the}} better scripts seen in The Original Series. He thought that despite the lack of a sense of real danger, the plot <b>all</b> <b>comes</b> together neatly and praised the story's effects on Kirk, saying [...] "The way the episode unfolds means Kirk's constantly dealing with things he does not really want to deal with, and there's a surprising amount of enjoyment to be had in seeing him complain about it to Spock." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the breakup}} of the Butterfield Blues Band and no longer under {{contract}} with Elektra, Butterfield retreated to Woodstock, New York, where he eventually formed his next band, Paul Butterfield's Better Days, with drummer Chris Parker, [...] guitarist Amos Garrett, singer Geoff Muldaur, pianist Ronnie Barron and bassist Billy Rich. In 1972–1973, the group recorded the albums Paul Butterfield's Better Days and It <b>All</b> <b>Comes</b> Back, released by Albert Grossman's Bearsville Records. The albums reflected the influence of the participants and explored more roots- and folk-based styles. [...] Although without an easily defined commercial style, both reached the album chart. The band did not last to record a third studio album, but its album Live at Winterland Ballroom, recorded in 1973, was released in 1999.|$|E

500|$|Complex {{gave the}} episode a {{positive}} review, writing {{that it was}} overshadowed by [...] "Leave It to Beaver", {{but that it was}} also a good episode by itself as well. [...] " [...] <b>all</b> <b>comes</b> to a head in the penultimate episode, which puts Veronica on the emotional rollercoaster until she gets to the uncomfortable truth." [...] The magazine also praised the reappearances of guest stars: [...] "what really makes the episode special is the way it trots out every supporting player and case-of-the-week guest star." [...] IGN ranked the episode 4th on its list of the top ten Veronica Mars episodes, saying that [...] "'A Trip to the Dentist'" [...] is a heavy episode that expertly shows how different people remember the same situation. The fact that Veronica has to threaten people who were at the party into telling her the truth is frakking painful. It's made even more sad when you realize that the version she believed to be the truth actually wasn't." ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{begins with}} a [...] "strange, electronic, {{slightly}} broken noise" [...] that spans between {{the start of the}} song up until 54 seconds. The ambient-influenced beginning gives the impression that [...] "Nothing Really Matters" [...] would be a ballad, but in the minute mark, it changes to a mid-tempo dance-pop song. The ambient music becomes restrained, although a cursory bleeping sound can be heard from the right to the left. The background has a number of faint strings in it, which signifies the depth of the stereo field. The chorus starts with a fast-pacing dance sound, over which Madonna sings, [...] "Nothing really matters / love is all we need / everything I give you / <b>all</b> <b>comes</b> back to me." [...] Throughout the entire song, it includes two verses, three choruses, one bridge section, and an outro. The bridge is backed by piano sounds with a descending sequence by a couple of bars. Madonna sings the same lyrics in the outro, but is slowed down and echoed longer until the music fades out.|$|E

500|$|The song {{received}} mostly positive {{responses from}} a number of critics. David Fricke of Rolling Stone assigned the track four out of five stars, deeming it [...] "just a bright, strident vocal and crisply strummed guitar. But when Armstrong’s bandmates fall in around him, Green Day sound the way you originally loved ’em, and refreshed: heavier and hardened from their time in the trenches but back in the garage, ready for rapture". Scott Shetler of PopCrush also rated the song four out of five stars and compared it to the song [...] "Jesus of Suburbia" [...] from the album American Idiot, calling it [...] "a much shorter and slightly more accessible version" [...] of that song. He also added, [...] "That’s good news for Green Day fans and for those who miss rock music on Top 40 radio". However, the song did not receive an entirely positive response from NME, who stated, [...] "That crunchy guitar riff, that meandering melody, that by-the-numbers solo– it <b>all</b> <b>comes</b> off rather ‘meh’, rather safe, and rather middle-ground to these ears".|$|E
500|$|SFScope {{columnist}} Sarah Stegall {{agreed with}} Murray's Lost comparison, writing that {{the ending of}} the episode was [...] "right out of the Lost playbook, a little too on the nose for my liking." [...] Stegall did however call it a [...] "good bridge episode, taking us from the setup of last week to the denouement next week, when it <b>all</b> <b>comes</b> together." [...] IGN writer Ramsey Isler was more positive about the final sequence, explaining that the [...] "last five minutes of this story changed everything, and made me excited about the series again." [...] While praising the special effects, he also noted his displeasure that Sam Weiss [...] "ends up not being as mystical or magical as previous stories hinted". Isler wished Corrigan had more screen time in the episode, calling it [...] "under-utilization of a great character the writers {{have spent a lot of}} time building up." [...] He rated it 7.5/10, an indication of a [...] "good" [...] episode, but criticized its [...] "slow" [...] pacing.|$|E
500|$|Feige {{announced}} that the film was in active development at the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con International during the Marvel Studios panel, with an intended release date of August 1, 2014. He stated that the film's titular team would consist of the characters Star-Lord, Drax the Destroyer, Gamora, Groot, and Rocket Raccoon. Two pieces of concept art were also displayed, one of Rocket Raccoon, and one featuring the entire team. In August 2012, James Gunn entered talks to direct the film, beating out other contenders, including Peyton Reed and the duo Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden. The Avengers director Joss Whedon, who signed a deal to creatively consult {{on all of the}} films leading up to , was enthusiastic about the selection of Gunn to direct, saying [...] "James [...] is what makes me think it will work... He is so off the wall, and so crazy, but so smart, such a craftsman and he builds from his heart. He loves the raccoon. Needs the raccoon... He has a very twisted take on it, but it <b>all</b> <b>comes</b> from a real love for the material. It's {{going to be hard for}} [...] to keep up." ...|$|E

500|$|As {{some critics}} have noted, Psycho-Pass explores {{societal}} and psychological themes, such {{as the price of}} living without stress, and without fear of crime. Indeed, the Sibyl System targets individuals who are considering performing actions that might cause stress to others. But this {{raises the question of whether}} it is morally and socially acceptable to charge individuals with crimes they have not yet committed. For example, in the first episode, a woman is kidnapped, and the resultant trauma causes her Psycho-Pass to become clouded. According to Sibyl's instructions, the police are therefore prepared to kill her. But Akane steps in, refusing to accept Sibyl's verdict, and manages to bring the woman's Psycho-Pass level back to the acceptable range by speaking gently to her. Consequently, this challenges the notion that the potential to commit a crime necessarily correlates with actually committing the crime. According to Anime News Network, [...] "We are all capable of doing bad things at timesshould we be punished because we thought of hurting someone before we act on it? Or because we were victims? It really <b>all</b> <b>comes</b> back to that first episode and Akane's reaction to the victim who presented as a violent criminal".|$|E
500|$|Though {{considering}} the game [...] "pretty darn tough," [...] IGN praised the game's variety and length. It also praised {{the sound and}} graphics, though the latter {{was a source of}} criticism: [...] "Incomings got it all... but it <b>all</b> <b>comes</b> at a high price: getting this game to run on our PCs was one big pain in the butt." [...] Despite calling it [...] "an outstanding-looking and great playing game," [...] IGN only gave the game a [...] "decent" [...] review score because of the system problems. Conversely, GameSpot's review noted none of these hardware issues, praising the visuals as [...] "some of the finest... of any action game". The reviewer, however, described the game design as [...] "strong yet slightly flawed... definitely pulls you in, but leaves a little to be desired as far as keeping you there," [...] complaining that [...] "what [...] have presented gets tiresome quickly." [...] The publication summarised the game as [...] "a fine game and a definite must-have for arcade fans... What it lacks is a realization that computer games have moved beyond this simplistic style of gameplay".|$|E

Medium Alison hesitates outside {{the door of the}} college's Gay Union, and is flummoxed when she meets Joan, a confident young lesbian. Bruce invites into the house Roy, a young man whom he has hired to do yard work. Bruce begins to seduce Roy in the library while Helen is playing the piano upstairs, trying her best to ignore it ("Helen's Etude").|$|E
