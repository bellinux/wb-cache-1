5|$|Aldridge {{also started}} the seventh game on October 15. It had been raining {{for a week}} in Pittsburgh, and the sixth game had been rainy. The weather for the seventh was even worse, and the game was played in thick pea soup fog <b>and</b> <b>drizzle,</b> <b>with</b> a very wet {{pitching}} mound. It was hoped that Aldridge would continue his success {{in the first two}} games to the seventh, but it was not to be. Although noted for his consistency, in this game Aldridge was very wild; he had had only two days rest and he kept slipping on the slick pitcher's plate. Sam Rice was the first batter, and he hit a single. Then Bucky Harris came out, whose fly out was the only success Aldridge had during the game. Goose Goslin was walked after a wild pitch. Joe Harris was walked after a wild pitch advanced the baserunners. After a full count, Joe Judge was walked, scoring in one run. Then Ossie Bluege hit a single. Pirates manager Bill McKechnie had seen enough and relieved Aldridge. In total, Aldridge gave up three walks, two hits and two wild pitches, resulting in the Senators having a 4–0 lead in the first inning. The Pirates would rally to win the game and the World Series by a score of 9–7, the first time a team won the World Series after a 3–1 deficit. It was the worst start of the seventh game for a pitcher in Series history.|$|E

50|$|Kecap manis is an {{essential}} sauce in the Indonesian pantry. It is used to add a pleasantly mild sweet and umami flavor in most popular Indonesian dishes; including nasi goreng, mie goreng, kwetiau goreng, ayam kecap (chicken), babi kecap (pork), semur beef stew, and ketoprak. It is also a popular marinade for grilled dishes, such as satay, ayam bakar (grilled chicken) and ikan bakar (grilled fish).

Steamed rice topped with sunny side fried egg <b>and</b> <b>drizzled</b> <b>with</b> sweet soy sauce is a simple yet popular meal among Indonesian children.

50|$|This dish is {{prepared}} by first boiling the octopus inside a copper cauldron. Before actually boiling it, the octopus is repeatedly dipped {{in and out}} of the boiling water, held by its head. The objective of this operation is to curl the tips of the tentacles. The tentacles are preferred over the head, which sometimes is discarded. After the octopus has been boiled, it is trimmed with scissors, sprinkled with coarse salt and paprika (known in Galicia as pemento picante) <b>and</b> <b>drizzled</b> <b>with</b> olive oil. The optimal cooking point is the one in which octopus is not rubbery but not overcooked either, similarly to the al dente concept in Italian pasta cooking. This is achieved after approximately a 20 minutes boil, provided that the octopus is left to rest for a further 20 minutes inside the boiled water away from the fire.|$|R
50|$|Another type of hot dog {{indigenous}} to North Jersey is the Italian hot dog, which originated at Jimmy Buff's in Newark in 1932 {{and is one}} of the foods most synonymous with North Jersey's Italian-American culture, especially in Essex County. The Italian hot dog is prepared by slicing a roll of round pizza bread in half (for a double order) or into quarters (for a single order), digging a pocket into it, and then spreading mustard along the inside of the roll. A deep-fried dog (two for a double order) is stuffed into the pocket, topped by fried or sauteed onions and peppers, and then followed by deep-fried potatoes that have been thinly sliced into discs or thickly-cut into chunks <b>and</b> <b>drizzled</b> <b>with</b> ketchup. Italian sausages can be substituted for the hot dogs and, as with their counterpart, are ordered as a single or double order.|$|R
500|$|By the 16thcentury, {{centralized}} kingdoms {{had emerged}} {{on the west}} coast among the Sakalava and in the Central highlands among the Merina. The Merina sovereigns celebrated the new year with an ancient Merina ceremony called the Royal Bath (fandroana). For this ceremony, a beef confit called jaka (...) was prepared by placing beef in a decorative clay jar and sealing it with suet, then conserving it in an underground pit for a year. The jaka would be shared with friends at the following year's festival. As a dessert, revelers would eat rice boiled in milk <b>and</b> <b>drizzled</b> <b>with</b> honey, a preparation known as tatao (...) [...] According to oral history, King Ralambo was the originator of these culinary traditions in Imerina.

50|$|The {{traditional}} method involves serving freshly prepared {{cubes of}} lamb, chicken, or beef on soft Italian bread, <b>and</b> occasionally <b>drizzled</b> <b>with</b> fresh marinade.

50|$|Breakfast usually {{includes}} {{a variety of}} white cheeses, olives, pickled vegetables, and freshly-baked breads served with various fruit spreads, butter, or honey. Most opt for tea or fruit juice as a drink with breakfast.Lunch is the main meal for most Jordanian families.

Some common salads are tabbouleh and salatah ‘arabiyah (chopped tomatoes, cucumber, <b>and</b> onions, <b>drizzled</b> <b>with</b> olive oil <b>and</b> lemon juice). Dips include baba ghanouj and tahini. Dinner is generally a smaller meal than lunch, but this can vary family-to-family depending on work schedules. If traditional practice is followed, the meal is usually a type of soup or stew or the leftovers from lunch.Although simple fresh fruits are often served towards the end of a Jordanian meal, there is also dessert, such as baklava, hareeseh, knafeh, halva and qatayef which is a dessert made specially for Ramadan.|$|R
50|$|English pancakes {{have three}} key ingredients: plain flour, eggs, and milk, though Gervase Markham's 1615 version in The English Huswife used water instead of milk, and added sweet spices. The batter is runny and forms {{a thin layer}} {{on the bottom of}} the frying pan when the pan is tilted. It may form some bubbles during cooking, which results in a pale pancake with dark spots where the bubbles were, but the pancake does not rise. English pancakes are similar to French crêpes and Italian crespelle. They may be eaten as a sweet dessert with the {{traditional}} topping of lemon juice <b>and</b> sugar, <b>drizzled</b> <b>with</b> golden syrup, or wrapped around savoury stuffings and eaten as a main course. On Shrove Tuesday, it is custom to eat pancakes, and lemon juice and sugar may be added on top. Yorkshire pudding is made from a similar recipe, but baked instead of fried. This batter rises because the air beaten into the batter expands, without the need for baking powder; the result is eaten as part of the traditional roast beef dinner. Oatcakes are a savoury variety of pancake particularly associated with Staffordshire.|$|R

5000|$|Zebu, {{a form of}} humped cattle, were {{introduced}} to the island around 1000 CE by settlers from east Africa, who also brought sorghum, goats, possibly Bambara groundnut, and other food sources. Because these cattle represented a form of wealth in east African and consequently Malagasy culture, they were eaten only rarely, typically after their ritual sacrifice at events of spiritual import such as funerals. Fresh zebu milk and curds instead constituted {{a major part of the}} pastoralists' diet. Zebu were kept in large herds in the south and west, but as individual herd members escaped and reproduced, a sizable population of wild zebu established itself in the highlands. Merina oral history tells that highland people were unaware that zebu were edible prior to the reign of King Ralambo (ruled 1575-1612), who is credited with the discovery, although archaeological evidence suggests that zebu were occasionally hunted and consumed in the highlands prior to Ralambo's time. It is more likely that these wild herds were first domesticated and kept in pens during this period, which corresponds with the emergence of complex, structured polities in the highlands.Foods were commonly prepared by boiling in water (at first using green bamboo as a vessel, and later clay or iron pots), roasting over a fire or grilling over hot stones or coals. Fermentation was also used to create curds from milk, develop the flavor of certain dried or fresh tubers or produce alcoholic beverages from honey, sugar cane juice or other local plants. The techniques of sun curing (drying), smoking and salting were used to preserve various foods for transport, trade or future consumption. Many foods prepared in these ways, such as a smoked dried beef called kitoza (...) and salted dried fish, are still eaten in a similar form in modern-day Madagascar.By the 16th century, centralized kingdoms had emerged on the west coast among the Sakalava and in the Central highlands among the Merina.
