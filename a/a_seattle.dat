5|$|On March 11, 1996, the Seattle City Council {{designated}} the exterior and {{roof of the}} original 1931 building as <b>a</b> <b>Seattle</b> city landmark, having approved a recommendation from the Landmarks Preservation Board. The move was prompted by a long-term proposal from The Seattle Times Company to redevelop their land in South Lake Union, {{at a cost of}} $150 million while preserving the historic character of the two buildings. The plans included two 10-story office buildings, a larger printing plant, and a multilevel parking garage.|$|E

Schack, Young and Myers, <b>a</b> major <b>Seattle</b> architectural firm, effected the conversion. The Seattle Department of Neighborhoods asserts that this relatively intact and early example of a commercial parking garage has historic significance, independent of the building's historic significance as Downtown Seattle's oldest surviving structure initially designed as <b>a</b> theater. <b>As</b> <b>Seattle's</b> commercial core began to grow and as the automobile began to shape the city, [...] "large parking garages…were a lucrative and essential part of downtown commerce." ...|$|R

5|$|The coaches both chose strong squads {{in their}} {{attempts}} to win the trophy, though Sounders forward Kenny Cooper, later selected as Player of the Tournament, did not appear in the final. The Union's Maurice Edu gave his team the lead with a goal in the first half, but the Sounders equalized with a second half strike by Chad Barrett, and the match went into extra time. Although Philadelphia controlled periods of the match with chances throughout, Clint Dempsey took the lead for Seattle in the first extra time period, and Obafemi Martins sealed <b>a</b> <b>Seattle</b> victory with a late goal. Seattle earned a $250,000 cash prize, as well as a berth into the 2015–16 CONCACAF Champions League. Philadelphia received a $60,000 cash prize as the competition's runner-up.|$|E
5|$|A {{commuter}} rail station in Mukilteo {{had been part}} of the original Sound Transit proposal rejected in 1995 and adopted the following year, as part of a Seattle–Everett line on the existing BNSF corridor. The agency selected the station site in 1999, choosing a platform east of State Route 525 and the Washington State Ferries terminal over one at Mukilteo Lighthouse Park because of concerns arising from existing parking and traffic issues in the area. A groundbreaking ceremony was held in August 2007 for the initial phase of the project, the northern side platform, as part of a multimodal transit hub built in conjunction with a new Mukilteo ferry terminal. The $19.2 million project, including preparations for a second phase to open in 2009, was funded by Sound Transit with a grant from the Federal Transit Administration. Sounder service from Mukilteo Station began on May 31, 2008, with a special weekend round-trip run to <b>a</b> <b>Seattle</b> Mariners game. The project was praised by local politicians for its multi-agency cooperation, especially between Sound Transit and Washington State Ferries.|$|E
5|$|In the 1918–19 season Holmes {{appeared}} in 20 regular season {{games for the}} Metropolitans, winning 11 and losing nine, with no shutouts and a 2.25goals-against average. In the PCHA playoffs, Holmes played two games, winning and losing one apiece, and surrendering five goals in total. The Metropolitans made the Stanley Cup finals once more. Playing against the Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey League (NHL), the series was abandoned tied at two wins apiece, because of the Spanish Influenza pandemic. Montreal could not continue the series because one of their players, Joe Hall, was severely ill with influenza; however, the Metropolitans {{did not wish to}} accept the Cup by default. Hall eventually died on April 5, 1919, five days {{after the end of the}} series, in <b>a</b> <b>Seattle</b> hospital. The only draw of the series was a scoreless affair; after playing 20minutes of overtime, referee Mickey Ion called the game off.|$|E

5|$|Seattle's {{political}} culture is very liberal and progressive for the United States, with over 80% {{of the population}} voting for the Democratic Party. All precincts in Seattle voted for Democratic Party candidate Barack Obama in the 2012 presidential election. In partisan elections for the Washington State Legislature and United States Congress, nearly all elections are won by Democrats. In 1926, Seattle became the first major American city to elect a female mayor, Bertha Knight Landes. It has also elected an openly gay mayor, Ed Murray, and a socialist councilor, Kshama Sawant. For {{the first time in}} United States history, an openly gay black woman was elected to public office when Sherry Harris was elected as <b>a</b> <b>Seattle</b> city councillor in 1991. The majority of the current city council is female.|$|E
5|$|The Seahawks {{played their}} home {{games at the}} Kingdome from their 1976 inaugural season until 1999. In 1995 a {{proposal}} was made to issue county bonds to fund a remodeling project of the facility. The proposal failed, and as a result, Seahawks' owner Ken Behring threatened to sell or move the team. In 1997 local billionaire Paul Allen pledged to acquire the team if a new stadium could be built {{and said that the}} team could not be profitable until they left the Kingdome. He asked the state legislature to hold a special statewide referendum on a proposal to finance a new stadium. Allen also agreed to cover any cost overruns. With Allen agreeing to pay the $4million cost, the legislature agreed. The vote was scheduled to be held in June 1997 but in May <b>a</b> <b>Seattle</b> resident filed a lawsuit that claimed the legislature did not have authority to call for such a vote, since it would be paid for by a private party who could gain from the result. The case was delayed until after the vote. The proposal was pitched to voters as providing both a new home for the Seahawks and a venue for top-level soccer. It passed on June 17, 1997, with 820,364 (51.1%) in favor and 783,584 against. The vote was close in Seattle, but it received 60% approval in Seattle's northern and eastern suburbs. The public funding was unpopular farther away in the eastern portion of the state. In October, a Thurston County Superior Court judge ruled that the legislature acted properly and in the public's interest, and he dismissed the pending lawsuit. The Washington Supreme Court upheld the decision that December.|$|E
