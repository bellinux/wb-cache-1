500|$|Ultimately, Fellini {{drew his}} three leading players from people {{associated}} with the 1954 film Donne Proibite (Angels of Darkness), directed by Giuseppe Amato, in which Masina played the very different role of a madam. Anthony Quinn was also acting in the film, while Richard Basehart was often on the set visiting his wife, actress Valentina Cortese. When Masina introduced Quinn to her husband, the actor was disconcerted by Fellini's insistence that the director had found his Zampanò, later remembering: [...] "I {{thought he was a}} little bit crazy, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> wasn't interested in the picture, but he kept hounding me for days." [...] Not long afterwards, Quinn spent the evening with Roberto Rossellini and Ingrid Bergman, and after dinner they watched Fellini's 1953 Italian comedy-drama I Vitelloni. According to Quinn: [...] "I was thunderstruck by it. I told them the film was a masterpiece, and that the same director was the man who had been chasing me for weeks." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} for [...] "Hotspur" [...] magazine, Merv reveals he has supported Tottenham Hotspur since the early 1980s. [...] "I went to a mate's house to watch the FA Cup Final, everyone {{in the house was}} supporting the other team except the guy I sat next to. He was English, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> was with him 100 per cent. Spurs won and I've supported them ever since." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't {{mean to be}} dramatic," [...] Evelyn {{answered}} quietly. [...] "Still, perhaps I {{was rather}} highly strung. Reggie asked me to marry him, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> could not." ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{the sound}} of men very guardedly rowing in the bay; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> so.|$|R
60|$|How he {{had found}} that out? At any rate, he was right; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> so candidly.|$|R
60|$|I {{could not}} help {{laughing}} again, at his balancing all callings and professions so equally; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> so.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. He was mighty {{nervous about}} your coming, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> {{would help him}} out. Of course, it didn't worry me none, and so I {{concluded}} I would do it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly--it {{was just}} what I wanted. Langless is all right, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> would double his money if he would stick by me to the finish, and he swore that he would." ...|$|E
60|$|Walkirk's plan amused me very much, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> {{would talk}} to my {{grandmother}} about it. When I did so, I was much {{surprised to find that}} she received the idea with favor.|$|E
60|$|I {{hesitated a}} little, but I {{could not help}} myself, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> the whole story from {{beginning}} to end.|$|R
50|$|Problem solution: I decided that's {{better for}} me to leave my boyfriend, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that (actively <b>and</b> {{explicitly}} communicating thoughts).|$|R
60|$|Of course these {{objections}} wrought my {{eagerness to}} a climax: gratified it must be, and that without delay; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> so.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Judson {{must have}} been letting his {{imagination}} run away with him. He is out of his misery. He sent a horrid fat man named Jones {{to see me in}} London about the letters, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> had destroyed them. He must have let him know that by this time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah; {{but it was}} I who incited him really, though I didn't know I {{was doing}} it! I talked to the child as one should only talk to people of mature age. I said the world was against us, {{that it was better}} to be out of life than in it at this price; and he took it literally. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> was going to have another child. It upset him. Oh how bitterly he upbraided me!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wrote Jem to-day {{and told}} him not to worry 'bout you not getting your mayflowers," [...] said Bruce seriously, [...] "'cause I'd see to that. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> would be ten pretty soon now, so it won't be very long before I'll be eighteen, and then I'll go to help him fight, and maybe let him come home for a rest while I took his place. I wrote Jerry, too. Jerry's getting better, you know." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{greeted me}} warmly, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> my trouble about the oxen, whereon he sent away the shield-holder, leaving us two together.|$|R
60|$|In very truth it did, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> so, but in {{the terms}} which the shrewd wit he said was mine dictated.|$|R
6000|$|From the {{photograph}} and the particulars, it seemed, as he said, the very thing, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him,</b> [...] "Yes; send {{it up at}} once." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Oh, Aunt Roxy,' says she, 'it's so dark, {{who will}} go with me?' and in a minute her whole face brightened up, and says she, 'John is going with me,' and she jist gave the least little sigh and never breathed no more--she jist died as easy as a bird. I told our {{minister}} of it next morning, and he asked if I'd made a note of the hour, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> had, and says he, 'You did right, Aunt Roxy.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|Well, {{my friend}} the poet thought {{his life was}} a failure, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> thought it was, {{and then he said}} he thought he ought to commit suicide, and I said [...] "all right," [...] which was disinterested advice to a friend in trouble; but, like all such advice, there was {{just a little bit of}} self-interest back of it, for if I could get a [...] "scoop" [...] on the other {{newspapers}} I could get a job.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{there are}} a great many other motives entirely {{distinct}} from these. For example, suppose I should say to a fifth boy, 'Will you copy this piece of poetry? it belongs to one of the little boys in school: he wants a copy of it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> would try to get some one to copy it for him.' This motive now would be benevolence; that is, if the boy, who was asked to copy it, was not particularly acquainted with the other, and did it chiefly to oblige him. We will call this boy B. for Benevolence.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> the {{accident}} wasn't Zeb's fault, that the train didn't whistle or ring, {{and that the}} crossing was a blind one." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him,</b> {{in a dozen}} brutal {{words that}} brought him to his feet, the lion in him roused at last, his eyes ablaze.|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{at least}} Jabez thinks, Prince," [...] <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> how the Israelites were {{sure that he}} would be Pharaoh, whereat he laughed and said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish I hadn't boxed {{his ears}} {{that day he}} tried to kiss me," [...] went on Felicity, who was evidently raking her {{conscience}} for past offences in regard to Peter. [...] "Of course I couldn't be expected to let a hir--to let a boy kiss me. But I needn't have been so cross about it. I {{might have been more}} dignified. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> just hated him. That wasn't true, but I s'pose he'll die thinking it is. Oh, dear me, what makes people say things they've got to be so sorry for afterwards?" ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{mastered}} {{herself at}} last, {{and went on}} in low, hesitating voice, more touching than downright sobbing: [...] "One day, the same summer the mill burned, one of the horses kicked at little Morty, and I said I'd sell it, {{and he said it}} was all nonsense; the horse wasn't to blame. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> wouldn't have a horse around that would kick. And when he said I shouldn't sell it, I said a dreadful thing. I knew it would cut him, but I said it. I said: 'The horse is mine; the farm is mine; I can do what I please with my own, for all of you.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes!" [...] cried Lucy, {{clapping}} her hands; {{and then}} she proceeded to tell her news with theatrical volubility. [...] "Mr. Sharp, the manager, wants a lot of tallish girls, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> knew of a perfect dear. He said: 'Bring her on, then,' and I flew home to tell you. Now, don't look wild, and say no. You've only got to sing in one chorus, march in the grand procession, and lead your band in the terrific battle-scene. The dress is splendid! Red tunic, tiger-skin over shoulder, helmet, shield, lance, fleshings, sandals, hair down, and as much cork to your eyebrows as you like." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He--he {{pulled me}} off--he hugged me--he k-kissed me.... Oh, it was dreadful--shameful! ... Then I gave him back--some--something {{he had given}} me. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> I--I hated him--and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him,</b> 'No!'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Very well!' I answered. 'Lorenzo {{asked me}} {{about the state of}} Forli, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him.</b> Then, after {{thinking}} awhile, he said, [...] "Tell this to Checco--"' ...|$|R
60|$|TOUCHIT.--So I did, so I did! He {{asked me}} fifteen shillings from Piccadilly, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> to go to--to {{somebody}} whose name {{begins with a}} D.|$|R
60|$|Shortly {{afterwards}} a gossipy old native estanciero, {{who lived}} close by, {{while sitting in}} our kitchen sipping maté, began talking freely about his neighbour's lives and characters, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> had felt interested in the brothers de la Rosa; partly {{on account of the}} great affection these two had for one another, which was like an ideal friendship; and in part too on account of the ancient history of the family they came from. I had met one of them, I told him,--Cyril--a very fine fellow, but in some respects he was not exactly like my preconceived idea of a de la Rosa.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wal, I {{was with}} 'em {{the night they}} was a talk-in' on't up. Ye see, Hokum he got thirty-seven cents' worth o' lemons and sperit. I see him goin' by as I was out a splittin' kindlin's; and says he, 'Sam, you jest go 'long up to our house to-night,' says he: 'Toddy Whitney and Harry Wiggin's com-in' up, and we're goin' {{to have a little}} suthin' hot,' says he; and he kind o' showed me the lemons and sperit. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> guessed I would go 'long. Wal, I kind o' wanted to see what they'd be up to, ye know.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{you must}} admit that it were rather strong." [...] He paused, but she said nothing. [...] "Only I suppose you can bring {{yourself}} to admit nothing against him. However, so it was. There was a row, and a policeman came up, and they made me give a promise that I didn't mean to shoot him or anything of that kind." [...] As she heard this she turned pale, but said nothing. [...] "Of course I didn't want to shoot him. I wished him to know what I thought about it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him.</b> <b>I</b> hate to trouble you with all this, but I couldn't bear that you shouldn't know it all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He's been shoving me into {{a corner}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> to quit," [...] {{answered}} Dave, glad {{to be able to}} make himself understood to somebody besides Roger.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Andie, I see I'll have {{to speak}} out plain with you," [...] <b>I</b> replied. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> so much as I thought needful of the facts.|$|R
60|$|This {{was kind}} of Uncle Enos, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> so when an hour later he appeared, dressed in his best, his trunk having arrived the evening before.|$|R
