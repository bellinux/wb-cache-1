5|$|During World War II, Harlan {{volunteered for}} {{military}} duty, {{serving as a}} colonel in the United States Army Air Force from 1943 to 1945. He was {{the chief of the}} Operational <b>Analysis</b> <b>Section</b> of the Eighth Air Force in England. He won the Legion of Merit from the United States, and the Croix de guerre from both France and Belgium. In 1946 Harlan returned to private law practice representing Du Pont family members against a federal antitrust lawsuit. In 1951, however, he returned to public service, serving as Chief Counsel to the New York State Crime Commission, where he investigated the relationship between organized crime and the state government as well as illegal gambling activities in New York and other areas. During this period Harlan also served as a committee chairman of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York, and to which he was later elected vice president. Harlan's main specialization at that time was corporate and anti-trust law.|$|E

2500|$|However, Petkov (2009) and Franklin (2009) {{interpret}} this paradox differently. They {{agreed with the}} result that the string will break due to unequal accelerations in the rocket frames, which causes the rest length between them to increase (see the Minkowski diagram in the <b>analysis</b> <b>section).</b> However, they denied the idea that those stresses are caused by length contraction in S. This is because, in their opinion, length contraction has no [...] "physical reality", but is merely the result of a Lorentz transformation, i.e. a rotation in four-dimensional space which by itself can never cause any stress at all. Thus the occurrence of such stresses in all reference frames including S and the breaking of the string {{is supposed to be the}} effect of relativistic acceleration alone.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the factors that}} influence the use of frozen <b>section</b> <b>analysis</b> in adnexal masses and the factors that predict malignancy. METHODS: The study participants were women scheduled for adnexal mass surgery in 11 hospitals between 2005 and 2009. Factors that potentially influenced the use of frozen <b>section</b> <b>analysis</b> and potentially predicted malignancy were studied, such as menopausal status, CA 125 level, ultrasound characteristics, presence of adhesions, and tumor size. We used univariable and multivariable analyses to assess the factors. RESULTS: A total of 670 patients were included in the study. The frozen section analyses for 323 patients (48 %) showed 206 benign, 55 borderline, and 62 malignant adnexal masses. The CA 125 level, locularity of the tumor, and presence of solid areas predicted both the use of frozen <b>section</b> <b>analysis</b> and the presence of malignancy. The presence of adhesions predicted malignancy, but not the use of frozen <b>section</b> <b>analysis.</b> Menopausal status and tumor size predicted the use of frozen <b>section</b> <b>analysis,</b> but not malignancy. CONCLUSION: Menopausal status and tumor size are associated with more use of frozen <b>section</b> <b>analysis,</b> but they have not been identified as factors associated with malignancy. Frozen <b>section</b> <b>analysis</b> is useful when the CA 125 levels are greater than 35 units/mL and when there are multilocular tumors, solid areas on ultrasonography, and adhesions revealed during surgery...|$|R
