30|$|Crater rays have bright albedo {{features}} that extend from fresh craters, forming radially oriented filaments and diffuse patches (Melosh 1989). Rays {{have been observed}} on airless bodies, i.e., the Moon, Mercury (Allen 1977), and icy satellites (Wagner et al. 2011). Various processes, including deposition of ejecta from primary craters, have been proposed as the production mechanism of rays (Allen 1977). Kadono et al. (2015) showed experimentally and numerically that clear mesh patterns form in impact-generated ejecta during flight. They also demonstrated in the laboratory that the characteristic angle of spaces between radial patterns was a few degrees, {{which is similar to}} that of the rays around two craters on the Moon. If crater rays are formed via ejecta from primary craters, the morphology of the rays can be discussed in terms of the <b>agglomerating</b> <b>process</b> of ejecta particles. The pattern of rays may be compared directly with the undulation of the granular streams shown in Fig.Â  11, although a dedicated study of the formation of discrete patterns in the ejecta curtain is required.|$|E
40|$|Air-to-air energy {{recovery}} wheels are now {{widely used in}} industry and buildings; however, the effectiveness of water vapor exchange in these regenerative wheels appears to be much lower than may be economically feasible. The purpose {{of this research is}} to investigate the feasibility of using agglomerated desiccant particle coatings to improve the performance of regenerative wheels used in HVAC air-to-air heat and moisture exchange and {{energy recovery}} applications. Desiccant particles coated on wheels lose most of their water vapor sorption capacity due to the method of coating. Desiccant agglomerates can be made by mixing starch, fine silica gel particulate, and water within an agglomerating device. The desiccant particle <b>agglomerating</b> <b>process</b> improves the desiccant mass transfer properties by increasing the overall surface area of desiccant particles; and also by creating a much rougher surface that can increase the likelihood of turbulent flow, and therefore, increasing the overall mass transfer rates. The industrial desiccant coating process involves submerging the desiccant into a coating agent and then applying this mix to the substrate or the matrix of the energy wheel. This process was improved in this research by ensuring the particles are applied after the coating agent is applied to ensure that the agglomerates or desiccant particles are not submerged by the coating material. Because testing energy wheels under steady state operating conditions has proved to be difficult, time consuming and costly in the past, a small parallel flow test cell is used to measure the transient response of coated substrate aluminum sheets after a step change in the inlet air humidity or temperature. Using a previously developed theoretical model, the time constants for these inlet step change responses are then used to predict the sensible and latent effectiveness of a regenerative energy wheel coated with the same agglomerated particles, which is rotated at a known operating speed and wheel face velocity. When the new desiccant coatings are used, it is shown that the latent heat effectiveness for a typical wheel could be up to 85 %. It is found that the steady state air flow pressure drop readings for the test cell shows that agglomerated particles coated on the surfaces within the test cell implies some transitional turbulent flow behavior compared to similar substrate surfaces coated in a conventional manner with desiccant particles (e. g. up to 60 % higher pressure drop at a channel Reynolds number of 300) in the same test cell. This implied enhanced turbulence flow friction factor in the test cell suggests a somewhat similar enhancement for increased mass and heat transfer coefficients for the test cell or coated wheel matrices. The transient results for humidity step changes for air flow through the test cell reveals that the adsorption and desorption response time constants are much larger for the agglomerated coated substrate surfaces than the conventional industrial coated surfaces. These data imply much higher moisture or latent heat effectiveness values for wheels coated with agglomerated particles. When the new desiccant coatings are used, it is shown that the latent heat effectiveness for a typical wheel could be better than 80 % or 20 % higher than currently available typical energy wheels. With improvements to the desiccant particle <b>agglomerating</b> <b>process,</b> desiccant coating process and particle coating and testing methods, this thesis shows that significant improvements may be practical for the design, testing and operation of regenerative heat and moisture exchange wheels...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{identify}} the basic mechanisms of agglomerate breakage during powder blending. Presence of drug agglomerates in a blend poses a potential safety risk in e. g. pharmaceutical applications. Therefore, agglomerates {{need to be}} removed. DESIGN AND METHODS This study assessed the critical process parameters and rules that must be observed when scaling up a mixing process. RESULTS Experiments using so-called brittle calibrated test particles provided evidence that agglomerates reduce in size via an abrasion mechanism. The abrasion rate is not only influenced by the (mechanical) properties of <b>agglomerates</b> and <b>process</b> conditions, {{but also by the}} particle size distribution of the filler. A novel method to measure powder velocities enabled the development of a quantitative model that describes the relationships between powder motion during blending and agglomerate abrasion. A Stokes number (Stabr) defined as the ratio between the kinetic energy density of the bed and the work of fracture of agglomerates predicts the rate of agglomerate abrasion very well. CONCLUSION Particle velocity critically affects agglomerate abrasion and mixing time.

40|$|A {{very common}} {{situation}} in the pharmaceutical arena is that {{a small amount of}} cohesive drug substance needs to be distributed in a large bulk of free-flowing filler such as lactose. The key topic of attention is that aggregates of a cohesive drug substance need to be sufficiently broken up in an acceptable time-frame. This implies that there is need for a better mechanistic understanding of the blending process and the reduction in size of the aggregates. The {{purpose of this study is}} to obtain more insight in the mechanisms that lead to the break up of assemblies of powder particles in a moving powder bed. The break up of aggregates was studied by application of so-called brittle Calibrated Test Particles (bCTPs). These are well-defined aggregates with brittle fracture properties. The dominant mechanism of the break up of these aggregates is abrasion by multiple impacts. There is evidence of a relationship between strength (expressed as porosity) of the bCTPs and rate of abrasion. This is often a slow process and the rate is determined riot only by the (mechanical) properties of the <b>agglomerates</b> and <b>process</b> conditions, but also by the particle size distribution of the bulk filler.

40|$|International audienceNatural talc {{is a very}} {{interesting}} filler for plastic and rubber materials and paints because it improves their properties by delivering mechanical reinforcement and barrier effects. Good dispersion in a polymer matrix requires fine particles, of nanometric size that are easy to disperse. However, at the moment the main drawback in the use of natural talc is that, with a conventional milling process, nanometric particle sizes are difficult and expensive to obtain. The objective {{of this study is to}} develop a process of magnesium silicate synthesis made by precipitation. This step is the first in the manufacturing process of synthetic talc. This study examines the influence of different process parameters on product properties (the way the reactants are added, the reactants themselves, molalities and ultrasound). The synthesized product is highly <b>agglomerated,</b> whatever <b>process</b> parameters are used, but the use of some specific parameters could result in a reduction in the size of the agglomerates. The addition of reactants by a mixing system with ultrasound during the synthesis could be the best method to synthesize the smallest particles.

40|$|This thesis {{reports a}} {{detailed}} {{investigation of the}} micromechanics of agglomerate behaviour under free-fall impact, double (punch) impact and diametrical compression tests using the simulation software TRUBAL. The software {{is based on the}} discrete element method (DEM) which incorporates the Newtonian equations of motion and contact mechanics theory to model the interparticle interactions. Four agglomerates have been used: three dense (differing in interface energy and contact density) and one loose. Although the simulated agglomerates are relatively coarse-grained, the results obtained are in good agreement with laboratory test results reported in the literature. The computer simulation results show that, in all three types of test, the loose agglomerate cannot fracture as it is unable to store sufficient elastic energy. Instead, it becomes flattened for low loading-rates and shattered or crushed at higher loading-rates. In impact tests, the dense agglomerates experience only local damage at low impact velocities. Semi-brittle fracture and fragmentation are produced over a range of higher impact velocities and at very high impact velocities shattering occurs. The dense agglomerates fracture in two or three large fragments in the diametrical compression tests. Local damage at the agglomerate-platen interface always occurs prior to fracture and consists of local bond breakage (microcrack formation) and local dislocations (compaction). The fracture process is dynamic and much more complex than that suggested by continuum fracture mechanics theory. Cracks are always initiated from the contact zones and propagate towards the agglomerate centre. Fracture occurs a short time after the start of unloading when a fracture crack "selection" process takes place. The detailed investigation of the <b>agglomerate</b> damage <b>processes</b> includes an examination of the evolution of the fracture surface. Detailed comparisons of the behaviour of the same agglomerate in all three types of test are presented. The particle size distribution curves of the debris are also examined, for both free-fall and double impact tests...|$|R

This paper studies nanoparticle fluidization by using adhesive CFD-DEM (Discrete Element Model) simulation, which includes an adhesive contact model having the ability to model the contact and bounce/stick between elastic-plastic and cohesive particles. The discrete elements represent the simple agglomerates of nanoparticles. The effects of particle density, fluidizing gas velocity, and van der Waals force on gas-solid flow and agglomerate behaviors are investigated. It is shown that the particles, representing simple agglomerates, form large <b>agglomerates</b> during fluidized <b>process.</b> As the <b>agglomerates</b> move around in the bed, they continuously break and recombine. The solid movement is evaluated by a dispersion coefficient and it decreases with increase in cohesion. By monitoring the evolution of contacts, the agglomerate breakage is visualized and compared for the different conditions. Increasing fluidizing gas velocity and reducing particle adhesion both increase agglomerate breakage rate.

First, when gas and dust grains collide, they <b>agglomerate</b> by microphysical <b>processes</b> like van der Waals forces and electromagnetic forces, forming micrometer-sized particles; during this stage, accumulation mechanisms are largely non-gravitational in nature. [...] However, planetesimal formation in the centimeter-to-meter range is not well understood, and no convincing explanation is offered as to why such grains would accumulate rather than simply rebound. In particular, {{it is still not}} clear how these objects grow to become 0.1 - 1 km sized planetesimals; this problem is known as the [...] "meter size barrier": As dust particles grow by coagulation, they acquire increasingly large relative velocities with respect to other particles in their vicinity, as well as a systematic inward drift velocity, that leads to destructive collisions, and thereby limit the growth of the aggregates to some maximum size. Ward (1996) suggests that when slow moving grains collide, the very low, yet non-zero, gravity of colliding grains impedes their escape. It is also thought that grain fragmentation plays an important role replenishing small grains and keeping the disk thick, but also in maintaining a relatively high abundance of solids of all sizes.|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} this work {{indicate}} that magnetite is not catalytically active for Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis (FTS) in precipitated, unsupported iron catalysts, but {{the formation of the}} carbide phase is necessary to obtain FTS activity. The transformation of magnetite to carbide, though essential to obtain FTS activity, also causes the catalyst to break down. This can lead to severe problems during operation in a commercial slurry phase reactor. The results presented here imply that activation and attrition are simultaneous and complementary processes. In another study, we show that the catalyst can also under go attrition on a micron scale which is caused by lack of strength of the forces binding the catalyst primary particles in the <b>agglomerates.</b> Both these <b>processes</b> can make wax separation and product recovery extremely difficult. In this study, we have also shown that H{sub 2 } reduction of this catalyst to metallic iron is detrimental to subsequent catalyst activity and causes a loss of surface area due to sintering of the iron crystallites. Reduction to metallic Fe also causes impurities such as S to segregate to the surface causing a complete loss of FTS activity. It has been shown that even submonolayer amounts of S can cause a dramatic decrease in FTS activity, hence reduction to metallic Fe should be avoided during activation of these catalysts. We have shown, however, that a mild H{sub 2 } reduction to magnetite does not lead to S segregation to the surface, and is therefore acceptable...|$|R
40|$|The {{conventional}} {{oil agglomeration}} process utilises an immiscible organic liquid, such as diesel, to agglomerate coal {{in an aqueous}} suspension of coal and mineral particles. With the application of agitation, the organic liquid selectively wets {{the surface of the}} coal and subsequently binds the coal particles together to form <b>agglomerates.</b> During this <b>process,</b> the mineral matter remains finely dispersed and hence the coal agglomerates can be retrieved by passing the material over a screen. This process achieves high quality beneficiation of the fine coal, and very effective dewatering of the product. While this is a remarkably effective process the technology has not been adopted because of the very poor economics, due to the high cost of the oil. In this work an alternative immiscible binding agent consisting of a high internal phase (HIP) water-in-oil emulsion was used. This binding agent provides the interfacial functionality of the oil, with the space filling functionality provided by the stabilised water drops of the emulsion. Thus far, the HIP emulsion has successfully agglomerated fine coal in an aqueous suspension and, in addition, has done so at a lower oil requirement than when pure diesel oil was used. A two-to-three fold reduction in organic liquid consumption was achieved when the HIP emulsion was used in the place of pure diesel oil. Further reductions in the organic liquid consumption are anticipated in the future if improved methods of preparing the emulsion are realised...|$|R

At this temperature the tar is more brittle and weaker than the sand. Thus, the tar is liberated from the sand and ground to fine particles, which can {{be separated from the}} sand. The technical performance of this process was studied, and a general grinding and liberation model was developed, which simulates this and other two component grinding processes.;Four grinding/separation techniques were studied: Fluidized Bed Grinder (a stirred fluidized bed with steel balls) and Spouted Bed grinding combined with tar entrainment, and High Speed Impeller and Ball Mill grinding combined with sieving. The spouted bed gave the highest quality of separation, with a tar purity of 84 %, at a tar recovery of 90 %. The ball mill gave the lowest separation quality with a tar purity of 60 % at 80 % tar recovery, and 35 % at 90 % recovery. A maximum tar recovery of 94 %, at a tar purity of 65 %, was obtained in the fluidized bed grinder. The spouted bed gave the lowest rate of separation, with a typical processing time of 14 hours to obtain 90 % tar recovery, versus 2 - 7 hours for the other mills. However, proposed modifications should increase this rate substantially.;In the grinding and liberation model, a distinction is made between tar sand agglomerates, containing more than one sand grain, and single sand particles, coated with a thin tar layer. Grinding of each particle type is described by a set of conventional first order rate equations, although with non-normalized breakage distribution functions for the <b>agglomerates.</b> The <b>processes</b> are interconnected by a continuous transfer of agglomerate grinding products to the tar coated sand particles.

This was done by granulation of binary mixtures of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) and either lactose, calcium phosphate, acetaminophen, or theophylline, in a 1 â¶ 3 ratio, using a 50 % (wt/wt) aqueous solution of PEG and water as the binder liquid. Formulations containing lactose were agglomerated using 5 different amounts of the PEG binder solution, giving rise to a PEG content in the range of 6 % to 43 % (wt/wt). The process outcome was characterized according to adhesion, yield, and water requirement, and the prepared granules were characterized according to size, size distribution, and flow properties as well as tableting properties. The agglomeration of all mixtures resulted in high yields of free-flowing agglomerates and gave rise to good reproducibility of the investigated <b>agglomerate</b> characteristics. The <b>process</b> allowed for the incorporation of 42. 5 % (wt/wt) PEG, which is higher than the percentage of PEG reported for other equipment. Tables of sufficient strength could be prepared with all investigated excipients using 20 % wt/wt PEG; higher PEG contents gave rise to adhesion and prolonged disintegration.

40|$|In the {{processing}} industries particulate materials {{are often in}} the form of powders which themselves are agglomerations of much smaller sized particles. During powder processing operations agglomerate degradation occurs primarily as a result of collisions between agglomerates and between <b>agglomerates</b> and the <b>process</b> equipment. Due to the small size of the agglomerates and the very short duration of the collisions it is currently not possible to obtain sufficiently detailed quantitative information from real experiments to provide a sound theoretically based strategy for designing particles to prevent or guarantee breakage. However, with the aid of computer simulated experiments, the micro-examination of these short duration dynamic events is made possible. This thesis presents the results of computer simulated experiments on a 2 D monodisperse agglomerate in which the algorithms used to model the particle-particle interactions have been derived from contact mechanics theories and, necessarily, incorporate contact adhesion. A detailed description of the theoretical background is included in the thesis. The results of the agglomerate impact simulations show three types of behaviour depending on whether the initial impact velocity is high, moderate or low. It is demonstrated that high velocity impacts produce extensive plastic deformation which leads to subsequent shattering of the agglomerate. At moderate impact velocities semi-brittle fracture is observed and there is a threshold velocity below which the agglomerate bounces off the wall with little or no visible damage. The micromechanical processes controlling these different types of behaviour are discussed and illustrated by computer graphics. Further work is reported to demonstrate the effect of impact velocity and bond strength on the damage produced. Empirical relationships between impact velocity, bond strength and damage are presented and their relevance to attrition and comminution is discussed. The particle size distribution curves resulting from the agglomerate impacts are also provided. Computer simulated diametrical compression tests on the same agglomerate have also been carried out. Simulations were performed for different platen velocities and different bond strengths. The results show that high platen velocities produce extensive plastic deformation and crushing. Low platen velocities produce semi-brittle failure in which cracks propagate from the platens inwards towards the centre of the agglomerate. The results are compared with the results of the agglomerate impact tests in terms of work input, applied velocity and damage produced...|$|R

Nanoparticles that were produced early in the sol-gel <b>process,</b> <b>agglomerated</b> into larger particles during gelation and during thermal stabilisation. Calcium was found to not enter the silica network until the material was heated to 400 Â°C. This has implications for the homogeneity of the calcium distribution in sol-gel derived bioactive glasses. Region separation was found within sol-gel derived bioactive glass monoliths produced by the standard procedure. The calcium concentration and nanoporosity were found to be higher {{near the edge of the}} monoliths. This is believed to be caused by calcium accumulation on the outer surface of the monoliths during the drying stage of the sol-gel process. The homogeneity of monoliths was successfully improved by using Teflon moulds. To provide further control of the nanostructure of 70 S 30 C, a method for increasing the nanopore diameter from 12 nm to 30 nm was devised by adding specific amount of trimethylethoxysilane (TMES) during the sol-gel process. A series of amounts of TMES were added at different time points during the sol-gel process. Solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and electron microscopy were used to explore the mechanisms behind the changes in nanostructure. Protein adsorption to sol-gel glass was investigated using in situ studies by monitoring the adsorption of fluorescent-labelled proteins onto various types of solgel derived bioactive glasses under confocal microscope with fibrinogen as model protein. Fibrinogen molecules were found to penetrate into inner nanopores of TheraGlassÂ® (a commercial glass with 17 nm nanopores) whereas no penetration was found into sol-gel derived silica (with 3 nm nanopores).

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Composite materials are usually multi-phase materials, made up from two or more phases, which are combined to provide properties that the individual constituents cannot. This technology represents an economical way to improve product performances avoiding the use of expensive materials. Composite materials can be obtained as films {{by means of the}} electrolysis of electroplating solutions in which micrometre- or submicrometre-size particles are suspended: variable amounts of these particles become incorporated in the electrochemically produced solid phase, to which they impart enhanced properties. The main aims of the present work contributing to this thesis are the study of different parameters influencing the electroco-deposition process in order to promote and improve the applicability of such a technology in the high speed electroplating industry. Following a comprehensive review on the electroco-deposition of composite coatings, the phenomena have been analysed moving from a microscopic point of view i. e. the role of the metal ions present in the electrolyte and adsorption on the inert particles and their interactions with the growing metal layer, to a macroscopic point of view i. e. the electrolyte agitation, its influence on particle motion and all the issues related to the presence of particles in an electrolyte during electroplating. In particular the inert particle influence in terms of geometry, dimension and chemical nature (spherical polystyrene particles vs. irregular alumina particles with different dimensions), the metal matrix influence (nickel, copper and zinc), the influence of electrolyte agitation (using a Rotating Cylinder Electrode cell system) and the influence of the coating thickness on particle content in the final coating, using different deposition times, have been examined. The importance of the particle shape has been highlighted showing how incorporating irregular geometries gave higher particle incorporation densities than regular geometries. The influence of the substrate finishing in terms of imperfections has been related to the particle incorporation rate showing how small surface imperfections enhanced the incorporation of particles. Different hydrodynamic regimes have been analysed resulting three different regimes being discerned: laminar, transitional and turbulent. The consequence, in terms of particle incorporation levels, has been found showing how the amount of particles in the coating changed from one regime to another. Different rate-determining steps were related to the hydrodynamics: when the regime is laminar, particles were incorporated as <b>agglomerates</b> and the <b>process</b> was under particle transfer control, whilst in the turbulent zone, the rate determining step was the velocity of reduction of the ions adsorbed on the particle surface...|$|R
40|$|Novel {{methods for}} {{producing}} ideal powders for fabricating Si 3 N ceramic parts have been investigated. The characteristics sought were principally uniformly small diameter, equiaxed, high purity particles which {{are free of}} <b>agglomerates.</b> Two laser <b>processes</b> were studied. In the first, a CO 2 laser source was used to heat the: reactant gases by coupling directly to them. Silicon (Si) and Si 3 N 4 powders have been synthesi- zed directly from SiH 4 and NH 3 /SiH 4 mixtures respectively. The spatially well- defined reaction zone and {{the combination of the}} rapid heating rates with the short times at reaction temperatures yielded very uniform and small diameter particles. Si N powders were produced with particle diameters entirely with- in the range o 00 - 200 A. The particles are equiaxed and nearly spherical. The Si powders had the same general characteristics, but exhibited a slightly larger range of diameters. An analytical model gives an approximate description of the process. The reaction proceeds as a thermal reaction at thresholds which agree with measured optical absorptivities. The absorptivities are high, which will permit good efficiencies to be achieved. We were not successful in inducing a multiphoton, unimolecular reaction. The second process uses selective heating {{to reduce the size of}} over- sized particles or agglomerates as well as modifying the shape of high aspect ratio particles. This process is based on the decreasing absorption efficiency of a particle to light when its diameter is less than the wavelength cf the incident light. Light induced comminution was demonstrated. The power required for comminution is higher than was originally anticipated, but it agrees with present analytical models. While the process was demonstrated with a 150 watt CO 2 laser, this power limitation precluded an orderly investigation of process variables. It appears that 750 - 1500 watts are required to operate continuously. These and higher power C 02 lasers are commercially available. We have successfully demonstrated both processes for producing superior Si ane Si 3 N 4 powders. The results of the direct synthesis approach are viewed as extremely important. Their uniform, small particle sizes make them unique with respect to all other powders. While demonstrated with Si and Si 3 N 4 powders, the process appears applicable to other materials. More work is required to determine the ultimate significance of the laser commi- ntion process. It appears that the process will work as anticipated and will induce the desired size and shape changes. It is apparent that it will be an energy intensive process. Prepared for U. S.

40|$|Composite {{materials}} are usually multi-phase materials, made up from {{two or more}} phases, which are combined to provide properties that the individual constituents cannot. This technology represents an economical way to improve product performances avoiding the use of expensive materials. Composite materials can be obtained as films {{by means of the}} electrolysis of electroplating solutions in which micrometre- or submicrometre-size particles are suspended: variable amounts of these particles become incorporated in the electrochemically produced solid phase, to which they impart enhanced properties. The main aims of the present work contributing to this thesis are the study of different parameters influencing the electroco-deposition process in order to promote and improve the applicability of such a technology in the high speed electroplating industry. Following a comprehensive review on the electroco-deposition of composite coatings, the phenomena have been analysed moving from a microscopic point of view i. e. the role of the metal ions present in the electrolyte and adsorption on the inert particles and their interactions with the growing metal layer, to a macroscopic point of view i. e. the electrolyte agitation, its influence on particle motion and all the issues related to the presence of particles in an electrolyte during electroplating. In particular the inert particle influence in terms of geometry, dimension and chemical nature (spherical polystyrene particles vs. irregular alumina particles with different dimensions), the metal matrix influence (nickel, copper and zinc), the influence of electrolyte agitation (using a Rotating Cylinder Electrode cell system) and the influence of the coating thickness on particle content in the final coating, using different deposition times, have been examined. The importance of the particle shape has been highlighted showing how incorporating irregular geometries gave higher particle incorporation densities than regular geometries. The influence of the substrate finishing in terms of imperfections has been related to the particle incorporation rate showing how small surface imperfections enhanced the incorporation of particles. Different hydrodynamic regimes have been analysed resulting three different regimes being discerned: laminar, transitional and turbulent. The consequence, in terms of particle incorporation levels, has been found showing how the amount of particles in the coating changed from one regime to another. Different rate-determining steps were related to the hydrodynamics: when the regime is laminar, particles were incorporated as <b>agglomerates</b> and the <b>process</b> was under particle transfer control, whilst in the turbulent zone, the rate determining step was the velocity of reduction of the ions adsorbed on the particle surface.
