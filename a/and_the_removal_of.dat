Previously, repeated dissolution and recrystallisation was used to achieve high purity. Today, liquid solvent extraction procedures involving selective complexation of Th4+ is used. For example, following alkaline digestion <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> phosphate, the resulting nitrato complexes of thorium, uranium, and the rare earths can be separated by extraction with tributyl phosphate in kerosene.|$|E
