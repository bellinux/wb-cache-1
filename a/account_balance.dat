5|$|Because {{the balance}} of {{payments}} sums to zero, a current account surplus indicates a deficit in the asset accounts and vice versa. A current account surplus or deficit indicates {{the extent to which}} a country is relying on foreign capital to finance its consumption and investments, and whether it is living beyond its means. For example, assuming a capital <b>account</b> <b>balance</b> of zero (thus no asset transfers available for financing), a current account deficit of £1 billion implies a financial account surplus (or net asset exports) of £1 billion. A net exporter of financial assets is known as a borrower, exchanging future payments for current consumption. Further, a net export of financial assets indicates growth in a country's debt. From this perspective, {{the balance of}} payments links a nation's income to its spending by indicating the degree to which current account imbalances are financed with domestic or foreign financial capital, which illuminates how a nation's wealth is shaped over time. A healthy balance of payments position is important for economic growth. If countries experiencing a growth in demand have trouble sustaining a healthy balance of payments, demand can slow, leading to: unused or excess supply, discouraged foreign investment, and less attractive exports which can further reinforce a negative cycle that intensifies payments imbalances.|$|E

25|$|The {{national}} <b>accounts</b> <b>balance</b> {{would be}} {{positively related to}} carbon emissions. The national <b>accounts</b> <b>balance</b> shows the difference between exports and imports. For many richer nations, such as the United States, the <b>accounts</b> <b>balance</b> is negative because more goods are imported than they are exported. This is mostly {{due to the fact}} that it is cheaper to produce goods outside of developed countries, leading the economies of developed countries to become increasingly dependent on services and not goods. We believed that a positive <b>accounts</b> <b>balance</b> would means that more production was occurring in a country, so more factories working would increase carbon emission levels.(Holtz-Eakin, 1995, pp.;85;101).|$|R
40|$|This paper empirically {{investigates the}} effects of {{demographic}} changes on current accounts. The analysis (based on panel least squares and weighted least squares models) shows substantial demographic effects on population ageing and current <b>account</b> <b>balances</b> in OECD countries. First, {{the negative impact of}} population ageing on general savings results in deteriorating current <b>account</b> <b>balances.</b> This result suggests that current <b>account</b> <b>balances</b> increase with the relative size of the working-age population and decrease when the elderly dependency ratio rises. This paper specifically distinguishes between two groups: the ageing society and the aged society. Empirical results indicate that demographic changes, such as dependency ratios, have no effect on current <b>account</b> <b>balances</b> in the ageing society group, but have a definite effect on current <b>account</b> <b>balances</b> in the aged society group, as previous research findings suggest. Therefore, current accounts will be positively benefited by encouraging birth rates and immigration from other countries in the long run...|$|R
