5|$|The brain {{contains}} several motor {{areas that}} project {{directly to the}} spinal cord. At the lowest level are motor areas in the medulla and pons, which control stereotyped movements such as walking, breathing, or swallowing. At <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>level</b> are areas in the midbrain, such as the red nucleus, {{which is responsible for}} coordinating movements of the arms and legs. At <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>level</b> yet is the primary motor cortex, a strip of tissue located at the posterior edge of the frontal lobe. The primary motor cortex sends projections to the subcortical motor areas, but also sends a massive projection directly to the spinal cord, through the pyramidal tract. This direct corticospinal projection allows for precise voluntary control of the fine details of movements. Other motor-related brain areas exert secondary effects by projecting to the primary motor areas. Among the most important secondary areas are the premotor cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum.|$|E
