Gardner states that the effects work was extremely stressful, as he wanted to do justice to the story; he credits James Franco equally with the success of the effects work. Three prosthetics were used in all, with two designed to show the innards of the arm and another to emulate the outside of it. Franco would later note that seeing blood on the arm was difficult for him and his reactions in those scenes were genuine.|$|E

Onur and his colleagues often donated goods to schools across Turkey with their own money and realized that many other people who want to do so do not find the time or make the effort to donate <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>itself</b> is very difficult. Onur envisioned a two-sided platform for individuals to connect directly with classrooms in need, providing materials requested by teachers. With the help of his friends and funding from Turkish Philanthrophy Funds, he had the first version of the site built in 2012 and started to spread the word.Throughout 2012-2013, BirSilgiBirKalem was featured in several national newspapers of Turkey ( [...] including Milliyet, Radikal and Hurriyet [...] ) and several TV shows and news. The press coverage helped BirSilgiBirKalem get traction slowly, albeit the growth was not fast enough.BirSilgiBirKalem continued to receive attention in social media. As the number of schools and donors grew, the organization was recognized and awarded for its original solution to a major problem by Ashoka, Sabancı Foundation and several other organizations.In 2015, Google for Non-Profits selected BirSilgiBirKalem as one of the non-profits it will support in Turkey. As a result of this free advertising support, BirSilgiBirKalem finally took off. The donations in 2015 alone were bigger than the sum of all donation of the previous three years.As of Jan 2017, donors have contributed over 1.5 million ( [...] of which close 1M came in 2015 [...] ) to help more than 100.000 students across Turkey.|$|E

40|$|Computer based systems (CBS) {{are often}} {{expected}} {{to be able to}} handle a complex system environment. In addition, the CBS itself generally exhibits an inherent complexity.

40|$|Within a {{research}} project at DaimlerChrysler we use vehicles as mobile data sources for distributed knowledge discovery. We realized that current approaches are not suitable for our purposes. They aim to infer a global model and try to approximate the results one would get from a single joined data source. Thus, they treat distribution as a technical issue only and ignore that the distribution itself may have a meaning and that models depend on {{the context in which}} they were derived. The main contribution of this paper is the identification of a practically relevant new problem class for distributed knowledge discovery which addresses the semantics of distribution. We show that this problem class is the proper framework for many important applications in which it should {{become an integral part of}} the knowledge discovery process, affecting the results as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>itself.</b> We outline a novel solution, called Knowledge Discovery from Models, which uses models as primary input and combines content driven and context driven analyses.

40|$|Over {{the past}} 20 years in Western Europe, {{sociology}} has taken took a "subjectivist turn" which strengthened an already sociocentric outlook European societies, especially concerning the "totemization of the self". In Western Europe, the individuals {{have to deal}} with "double-binds" situations and to face a diversity of normative orders. As contemporary Western Europe societies are getting more complex, there is a growing diversity of "alterity regimes": weal alterity regimes, strong alterity regimes, partially autonomous alterity regimes. Because alterity regimes are getting more and more diverse, careers have become more and more discontinuous; and along with globalization, biographies become cosmopolitan and complex, forming plural identities built not only in different situations but also in multisituated times and spaces. The concept of subjectivity may be less common in Chinese sociology, but the subjectivity of the Other is not ignored. Whereas, in Western theories, the me, the I and the others are seen as distinct moments in a discontinuous process of the self, in Chinese thinking all steps are not so clearly set apart <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>itself</b> is much more continuous.

The EGB network is studied as a form of environmental governance, and its formation and furtherance are linked with the environmental governance discussion. In addition, the article aims to show that EGB governance is changing the meaning of the former Iron Curtain borders.

40|$|This is the pre-print of {{the article}} found in Environmental and Ecological Statistics. The {{original}} publication is available at www. springerlink. com. Differential equation based advection-diffusion models {{have been used in}} atmospheric science to mimic complex processes such as weather and climate. Differential and partial-differential equations (PDE's) have become popular in biological and ecological fields as well. In many cases, these models are considered in a strictly deterministic framework even though many sources of uncertainty in the process, the model, and the measurements may exist. Many deterministic PDE models are well-equiped to represent the theoretical spread of organisms, but have no mechanism to account for the various sources of uncertainty related to the inadequacies of the model as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>itself</b> and our knowledge of it. However, the use of a PDE within the framework of a hierarchical Bayesian model can provide a useful link between scientifically based deterministic models and statistical models that accurately portray variability (Wikle 2003).

40|$|With the {{development}} of the internet, media and its formats have started changing. New online media formats have enabled more audience participation in the production of media content, and this has given space for innovation and more co-operative media content production. Oma Olivia is a concept from Olivia magazine that actively seeks to activate its audiences in content production. This thesis examines the production patterns and audience participation in Oma Olivia and two Oma Olivia magazine editions. Through the use of content analysis the thesis examines challenges posted on the Oma Olivia website for the audiences, and the magazine content produced from these challenges. The thesis aims to see where in the production processes are the audiences of Oma Olivia placed and what do they produce. The thesis also uses political economy as its theoretical framework and concentrates on examining how the audience produced content can be seen in relation to commodification and the labor theory of value. Other valuable insights to political economy in this thesis are provided through the examination of the blindspot debate, and its later digital media considerations. The thesis findings from this thesis show that the audiences of the Oma Olivia concept add their own personal opinions and experiences to the topics provided on the Oma Olivia website, and through simple means of interaction add a valuable personal layer to the content of the magazine. The thesis also shows that the Oma Olivia format adds a new pattern to the traditional production patters in the labour theory of value, and produces content within the traditional production cycle. Additionally from the findings it is concluded that the value produced in the audience production may not be measured in economic terms <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>itself</b> does not add direct economical value. This conclusion raises the need for further research into the value production in these concepts as well as the production patterns suggested in this thesis...|$|E
