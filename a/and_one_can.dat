5|$|In {{order to}} better {{understand}} the quantum aspects of gravity in our four-dimensional universe, some physicists have considered a lower-dimensional mathematical model in which spacetime has only two spatial dimensions and one time dimension. In this setting, the mathematics describing the gravitational field simplifies drastically, <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> study quantum gravity using familiar methods from quantum field theory, eliminating the need for string theory or other more radical approaches to quantum gravity in four dimensions.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the fact that the {{universe}} is well described by four-dimensional spacetime, there are several reasons why physicists consider theories in other dimensions. In some cases, by modeling spacetime in a different number of dimensions, a theory becomes more mathematically tractable, <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> perform calculations and gain general insights more easily. There are also situations where theories in two or three spacetime dimensions are useful for describing phenomena in condensed matter physics. Finally, there exist scenarios in which there could actually be more than four dimensions of spacetime which have nonetheless managed to escape detection.|$|E

25|$|This {{is because}} one can always {{reduce the number}} of {{variables}} by substituting zero for some variables, <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> increase the number of variables by applying the homomorphisms n; the definition of those homomorphisms assures that n(P(X1,,X'n))=P(X1,,X'n+1) (and similarly for Q) whenever n'd.

Non-linear objectives and constraints could also be incorporated if needed.|$|E
