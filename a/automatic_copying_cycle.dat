This concept incorporates state of the art secure logging approaches, and is resistant to the copying and verification attacks described in this document.

40|$|This study {{describes}} a new tool for accurate and reliable high-throughput detection of copy number {{variation in the}} human genome. We have constructed a large-insert clone DNA microarray covering the entire human genome in tiling path resolution that we have used to identify copy number variation in human populations. Crucial to this study has been {{the development of a}} robust array platform and analytic process for the automated identification of copy number variants (CNVs). The array consists of 26, 574 clones covering 93. 7 % of euchromatic regions. Clones were selected primarily from the published “Golden Path, ” and mapping was confirmed by fingerprinting and BAC-end sequencing. Array performance was extensively tested by a series of validation assays. These included determining the hybridization characteristics of each individual clone on the array by chromosome-specific add-in experiments. Estimation of data reproducibility and false-positive/negative rates was carried out using self–self hybridizations, replicate experiments, and independent validations of CNVs. Based on these studies, we developed a variance-based <b>automatic</b> <b>copy</b> number detection analysis process (CNVfinder) and have demonstrated its robustness by comparison with the SW-ARRAY method.

40|$|Background: The {{discharge}} {{letter is}} the primary means of communication at patient discharge, yet discharge letters are often not completed on time. A multifaceted intervention was performed to improve communication in patient hand-off from {{the intensive care unit}} (ICU) to the wards by improving the timeliness of discharge letters. Methods: A management directive was operationalised by a working group of ICU staff in a longitudinal before-after study. The intervention consisted of (a) changing policy to require a letter for use as a transfer note at the time of ICU discharge, (b) changing the assignment of responsibility to an automatic process, (c) leveraging positive peer pressure by making the list of patients in need of letters visible to colleagues and (d) provision of decision support, through <b>automatic</b> <b>copying</b> of important content from the patient record to the letter and email reminders if letters were not written on time. Statistical process control charts were used to monitor the longitudinal effect of the intervention. Results: The intervention resulted in a 77. 9 % absolute improvement in the proportion of patients with a complete transfer note at the time of discharge, and an 85. 2 % absolute improvement in the number of discharge letters written. Statistical process control shows that the effect was sustained over time. Conclusions: A multifaceted intervention can be highly effective for improving discharge communication from the IC...|$|R
40|$|Color tiles, 3 D bar codes, {{security}} printing, payload density, color 2 D barcodes {{are taking}} on increasing significance as the ubiquity of high-resolution cameras, combined with the availability of variable data printing, drives increasing amounts of “click and connect ” applications. Barcodes therefore serve as an increasingly significant connection between physical and electronic portions, or versions, of documents. The use of color provides many additional advantages, including increased payload density and security. In this paper, we consider four factors affecting the readable payload in a color barcode: (1) number of print-scan (PS), or <b>copy,</b> <b>cycles,</b> (2) image restoration to offset PS-induced degradation, (3) the authentication algorithm used, and (4) the use of spectral pre-compensation (SPC) to optimize the color settings for the color barcodes. The PS cycle was shown to consistently reduce payload density by approximately 55 % under all tested conditions. SPC nearly doubled the payload density, and selecting the better authentication algorithm increased payload density by roughly 50 % in the mean. Restoration, however, was found to increase payload density less substantially (~ 30 %), and only when combined with the optimized settings for SPC. These results are also discussed in light of optimizing payload density for the generation of document security deterrents...|$|R

The performance of iterative methods is typically limited by the speed of the memory system.
