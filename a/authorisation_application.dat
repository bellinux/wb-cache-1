We carried out a comparison of the prevalence of drug withdrawals derived from both liraglutide registration trial data, and a systematic, prospective case-note review of all new liraglutide prescriptions (n= 176) from a specialist diabetes clinic over the first 12 months of drug introduction. Trial data used for the marketing <b>authorisation</b> <b>application</b> for liraglutide reported 7. 0 % withdrawal due to adverse events. Equal numbers of patients experienced mild, moderate and severe side effects. By contrast, data derived from a 'real world' clinical group describe 14. 8 % withdrawal due to adverse events, with withdrawal typically occurring early, by three months. Adverse events were more frequently responsible for treatment withdrawal at lower, compared to higher, doses of liraglutide therapy. Systematic observations of withdrawals in early use of new drugs in current clinical practice are higher than reported in registration trial data. These data highlight that postmarketing surveillance should inform guideline recommendations and pharmacoeconomic evaluations. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons...|$|E

40|$|Rare {{diseases}} have a {{prevalence of}} lower than 5 in 10, 000 inhabitants and are life-threatening or chronically debilitating. It {{is estimated that}} worldwide more than 5000 rare diseases exist, which account for over 55 million patients in the EU and the US together. However, the development of drugs for rare diseases, so called orphan drugs {{has not been an}} area of high priority for the pharmaceutical industry so far. Therefore, dedicated orphan drug legislation has been introduced that aims to stimulate the development of these high medical need products. This thesis identifies strategies for enhancing the development and marketing of orphan drugs. In the first chapter, bottlenecks and opportunities for translating biomedical research on rare diseases into early orphan drug development were studied. This chapter highlighted the importance of basic biomedical research for orphan drug development. Moreover, the studies determined the importance of strong pharmaceutical innovation in general, including patent applications, R&D expenditure and the existence of small and medium enterprises in the pharmaceutical industry, for the successful translation of biomedical research into orphan drug development. The second chapter focussed on characteristics of orphan drugs associated with a positive or negative outcome of the marketing <b>authorisation</b> <b>application</b> (by the FDA or EMEA). First, sponsors with prior experience in (orphan) drug development were more likely to develop another orphan drug. Orphan drugs based on existing molecules had also more chance to get market approval. Second, the choice of the target population for the orphan drug and the choice of the primary endpoint in the pivotal clinical trial was determined {{to be associated with the}} outcome of the regulatory assessment. Finally, a higher level of interaction between sponsors and regulators was shown to be positively associated with successful market authorisation. The third chapter of the thesis described the challenges of orphan drugs after approval. As a result of differences in healthcare systems and other reasons, including the sometimes-high prices of orphan drugs, not all orphan drugs are available to the patients throughout the EU. In the thesis, the use of orphan drugs is compared to other centrally authorised drugs in the EU and this appeared not to be significantly different. Second, due to the limited clinical experience with orphan drugs before approval, the risk for unexpected adverse events of orphan drugs may be higher than for other drugs. We reveal that the number of written safety warnings and black box warnings for orphan drugs is not significantly different from that for other drugs...|$|E
40|$|Randomised {{controlled}} trials (RCTs) {{are considered}} {{the gold standard for}} the identification and estimation of causal effects and thus for establishing causal conclusions. Most RCTs are designed based on the implicit assumption that patients recruited to the trial will be homogeneous and will respond (relatively) homogeneously to the intervention. As subgroups may well be associated with different treatment effects within a clinical trial, even with strict inclusion criteria, this assumption of homogeneous treatment effect should be challenged on a regular basis. To do so, subgroups should be investigated to validate the interpretation, hence the internal consistency, of the overall treatment effect. However, investigation of subgroups suffers from methodological, statistical and interpretational complications, reasons why subgroup analyses constitute a major challenge in the assessment of results from clinical trials. In this thesis, a new framework for regulatory decision making based on four purposes for subgroup analyses has been proposed: (1) Investigate the consistency of treatment effects across subgroups of clinical importance, (2) Explore the treatment effect across different subgroups within an overall non-significant trial, (3) Evaluate safety profiles limited to one or a few subgroup(s), (4) Establish efficacy in the targeted subgroup(s) when included in a confirmatory testing strategy of a single trial. These four categories, deemed relevant for practice, share common aspects but also require specific considerations to improve regulatory decision making. First a literature review was conducted to get insight into existing methods as well as into which areas research is needed as regard to the proposed ”purpose-based” framework. Secondly, exploring subgroups in trials for which the primary outcome showed no significant treatment effect in the full population (purpose 2) is very likely to cause problems as in principle no firm confirmatory conclusions can be made regarding subgroups. The evidence based on such findings is generally weak. The best available solution is therefore to conduct an appropriately designed replication trial. Finally, the impact of subgroups from a regulatory decision-making perspective was evaluated. By assessing a) whether subgroups evaluations differ between approved and non-approved products, b) whether subgroup assessment led to the approved indication being different from the indication as proposed by the applicant, and c) whether the impact of subgroups depends on an orphan status of the medicine, it appears that subgroup analyses {{are an integral part of}} the analyses the applicant presents and the analyses the regulators ask for during assessment of a marketing <b>authorisation</b> <b>application.</b> Therefore, subgroup analyses are essential in terms of influencing the medicine licensing, labelling, reimbursement, and prescribing decisions. In general, subgroup analyses constitute a fundamental step in the assessment of evidence from confirmatory (Phase III) clinical trials. This thesis emphasises that the context in which subgroup analyses are performed is of prime importance to have an appropriate and thorough clinical trial results assessment...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the user-friendliness of medicines. Using medicines {{is a complex}} process during which many difficulties can be experienced, for instance {{with the opening of}} packaging, the breakability of tablets or the administration of eye drops. Such practical problems can lead to incorrect use of medicines and consequently into deterioration of medical conditions or to adverse effects ranging from bothersome complaints to serious reactions including disability or (re) admissions to hospital. We took the usability of medicines for older people {{as a starting point for}} our studies. Aging comes with an increased prevalence of functional decline, e. g. with regard to decreased vision, hearing, manual dexterity and hand-grip strength. Consequently, aging can affect patients’ ability to adequately use medicines. Besides, older people are the largest user group of medicines. Taking the capabilities of the aging population into account during the development of medicines will help older people to use their medicines independently. First, we investigated the practical problems that older people experience with the daily use of their medication through telephone questionnaires and interviews. These two studies provide insight in the variety of problems that older people may experience with the use of their medicines and their strategies to overcome the usability issues. In addition, the potential clinical consequences of the problems and solutions were determined. We then focussed on the suitability of the design of medicines for use by older people. We investigated the design features of medicines that caused the previously identified use problems among older patients, and the functionality of the score mark on tablets for dividing tablets in equal doses. At last, approaches to prevent usability problems with medicines are explored. This includes overcoming problems with the swallowing of tablets and with the subdivision of tablets. In addition, it was investigated to what extent pharmacy technicians identify problems with opening medicine packaging and how they assist patients in resolving these problems. This thesis demonstrates that the user-friendliness of medicines can be approved significantly. This requires a multifaceted approach; not only medicine developers can contribute to the better use of medicines, also regulatory agencies, health care providers, health insurers and patients themselves should be committed to contribute to this. We recommend that medicines developers evaluate the usability of medicines for the intended user population during product development. Concomitantly, we advise regulators to encourage medicine developers to conduct usability studies and assess the outcomes of such studies as part of the marketing <b>authorisation</b> <b>application.</b> In addition, collecting and sharing post-marketing reports on usability problems with medicines could significantly contribute to the prevention of similar problems with other products. As patients are not forthcoming about problems with the use of their medicines, health care providers should encourage patients to report their usability problems and address these problems as part of counselling. Health care insurance companies can play a role in preventing usability problems with medicines by taking the usability of a medicine into account when selecting preferred suppliers...|$|E
30|$|Being {{basically}} {{committed to}} the state-of-the-science, the authorisation process for PPPs demands that “blind spots” and weaknesses in the environmental risk assessment be eliminated. For example, the assessment currently fails to pay sufficient attention to the impacts on amphibians, reptiles, wild pollinators, soil arthropods, aquatic and soil fungi, or the indirect effects on biodiversity (for the latter, see also below). There is also considerable uncertainty about how representative the results of model calculations are of the PPP residues expected in the soil, groundwater, and surface water bodies. Improvement of the environmental risk assessment requires the continuous further development of the principles on which it is based as well as implementation of the scientific developments in appropriate testing requirements and assessment concepts. Responsibility for this development in Germany lies with UBA, in parallel to the processing of <b>authorisation</b> <b>applications.</b> Research projects commissioned by UBA for this purpose, the results of which are frequently introduced into the further development of the testing and assessment procedures at the European level.

40|$|This study {{involves}} a reversed-phase gradient HPLC related substances (impurity) analytical method, {{for a drug}} product. These types of analyses are of crucial importance because the data they supply is such {{that it might be}} part of qualifier information used by regulatory organisations to determine whether marketing <b>authorisations</b> <b>applications</b> are to be accepted or not. Problems were observed in this method as ghost peaks were coinciding with the retention time of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and also appearing at relative retention times of probable related substances of the API, thus making the quantification of such impurities difficult. Ghost peaks is the most common recently used term for non-reproducible, random and uncontrollable peaks, for which several terms were coined in the past decades including spurious peaks, vacant peaks, eigen peaks and system peaks. They are more important in reversed-phase gradient analytical systems which tend to be more able to concentrate any contaminants present in the system as the organic component of the mobile phase varies (increases). This investigation involved a preliminary analysis of the situation, the primary aim being the determination of the source of the ghost peaks should their source be one and consistent, and hence the eradication of peaks by taking limited precautionary measures thus avoiding the re-development and/or revalidation of the method.

40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{this study}} is to provide a {{comprehensive}} overview of the outcomes of marketing <b>authorisation</b> <b>applications</b> via the mutual recognition and decentralised procedures (MRP/DCP) and assess determinants of licensing failure during CMDh referral procedures. METHODS: All MRP/DCP procedures to the Co-ordination group for Mutual recognition and Decentralised procedures-human (CMDh) during the period from January 2006 to December 2013 were analysed. Reasons for starting referral procedures were scored. In addition, a survey under pharmaceutical companies was performed to estimate the frequency of licensing failure prior to CMDh referrals. RESULTS: During the study period, 10392 MRP/DCP procedures were finalized. Three hundred seventy-seven (3. 6 %) resulted in a referral procedure, of which 70 (19 %) resulted in licensing failure, defined as refusal or withdrawal of the application. The frequency of CMDh referrals decreased from 14. 5 % in 2006 to 1. 6 % in 2013. Of all referrals, 272 (72 %) were resolved through consensus within the CMDh, the remaining 105 (28 %) were resolved at the level of the CHMP. Most referrals were started because of objections raised about the clinical development program. Study design issues and objections about the demonstration of equivalence were most likely to result in licensing failure. An estimated 11 % of all MRP/DCP procedures resulted in licensing failure prior to CMDh referral. CONCLUSION: Whereas the absolute number of MRP/DCP procedures resulting in a referral has reduced substantially over the past years, no specific time trend could be observed regarding the frequency of referrals resulting in licensing failure. Increased knowledge at the level of companies and regulators has reduced the frequency of late-stage failure of marketing applications via the MRP/DCP...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{effect of}} renal {{impairment}} (RI) on systemic exposure is assessed in phase I with RI studies and/or in phase III with population pharmacokinetic analysis. Regulatory review {{has indicated that}} the estimated effect of RI from the two methods may differ. Aim: To map the estimated effect of RI on systemic exposure based on phase I and III data, to investigate if the estimated effect based on the two data sources differ and to investigate causes to this potential discrepancy. Methods: Marketing <b>authorisation</b> <b>applications</b> (MAA) were scrutinised with focus on impact of RI on systemic exposure estimated based on phase I and III data. In addition, a simulation-estimation study was performed to explore causes to discrepancies. Phase I and III data were simulated and analysed with non-compartmental analysis (NCA) and population analysis. The phase III data were simulated under several alternative conditions thought to be potential sources for discrepancies,  such as uncertainty in creatinine clearance (CLCR) measurements and varying number of subjects. Results: Six examples were found in MAAs in which a discrepancy was observed, where phase III tended to estimate a lower effect of RI compared with phase I. In the simulation-estimation study, the NCA of phase I data over-predicted the effect of RI on systemic exposure, while the population analysis of phase III data estimated the effect of RI without bias. Uncertainty in CLCR measurement in the phase III data resulted in under-prediction {{of the effect of}} RI on systemic exposure. Conclusions: A discrepancy in the estimated effect of RI on systemic exposure between phase I and III was observed in existing MAAs. The NCA of phase I RI study and uncertain CLCR measurements were identified as possible reasons to the discrepancy...|$|R

40|$|Current praxis of {{software}} licensing {{has been identified}} as major obstacle for Grid computing {{a couple of years ago}} already. Recent surveys of Clouds indicate that the same holds true for Cloud computing.

Due to the mandatory centralised control of license usage at application run-time, e. g. heartbeat control by the license server, traditional software licensing practices are not suitable especially when the environment stretches across adminis- trative domains.

40|$|M. Sc. (Environmental Management) The minimum {{requirements}} for {{environmental impact assessment}} (EIA) in South Africa are prescribed in the 2010 EIA Regulations under the National Environmental Management Act (Act No. 107 of 1998) [NEMA]; where EIA {{is used as a}} decision-support tool by competent authorities in evaluating the environmental <b>authorisation</b> <b>applications</b> of activities likely to have adverse environmental impacts. Regulations under the National Environmental Management: Waste Act (Act No. 59 of 2008) [NEM:WA] define the nature and thresholds of those waste management activities for which environmental authorisation, {{in the form of a}} waste management licence, is required. The aforementioned regulations make a distinction between Category A activities and Category B activities; where an <b>application</b> for <b>authorisation</b> for Category B activities needs to be supported by a comprehensive Scoping and EIA (SIA) process undertaken by an independent environmental assessment practitioner (EAP). With the exception of the disposal of general waste to land, Category B activities relate to hazardous waste storage, treatment, reuse, recycling, recovery and disposal. The above-mentioned SIA process is implemented in two distinct phases, the first of which is the scoping phase; which aims to identify the key potential impacts that could be realised from a development proposal and to set the terms of reference for the subsequent EIA phase. Scoping thus aims, inter alia, to ensure that the overall EIA is undertaken in an efficient and effective manner, with emphasis on identification of impacts of potential significance. By using a modified version of the South African adapted Lee and Colley (1992) Review Package, this dissertation presents the findings of an evaluation of the quality of hazardous waste-related Scoping Reports prepared in South Africa. A sample of 20 Scoping Reports was assessed using the aforementioned review package. The results indicated that 75 % of Scoping Reports were undertaken satisfactorily in terms of overall quality. Conversely, 25 % of these reports were deemed to be of an unsatisfactory quality, with 10 % having been very poorly attempted and deficient in many material respects. This is concerning in respect of the sectoral focus (hazardous waste management) of this research; where by definition, owing to the inherent physical, chemical or toxicological characteristics, the handling of hazardous waste may have a significant detrimental impact on human health and the environment if managed inappropriately...|$|R
40|$|Summary: The main {{consequences}} for the veterinary medicinal product sector of the recent wave of liberalisation in Africa’s livestock sector have been a proliferation of operators, a diversification of product origin and a general decline in product quality. In this context, all the stakeholders involved agree that legislation on veterinary medicinal products needs to be harmonised among the African countries. Despite this consensus, however, the situation has not changed much in the countries themselves. In order to explore operational guidelines for harmonising national legislation in Africa, with particular reference to the registration and quality control of veterinary medicinal products, the OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health) drew up a status report on the member countries of the OIE Regional Commission for Africa based on the answers to a questionnaire.
