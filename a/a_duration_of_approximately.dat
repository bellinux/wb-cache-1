2500|$|Historically, {{the most}} widely used {{experimental}} means of inducing LTP has been to deliver a tetanic stimulation to the presynaptic axon of a synapse or group of synapses. [...] The frequency of this tetanus is typically 100Hz, and the duration typically 1 s. [...] A single AMPAR-mediated EPSP has a rise time-to-peak of approximately 2–5 ms and <b>a</b> <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>approximately</b> 30 ms. [...] If a synapse is being stimulated at 100Hz, the presynaptic neuron will be attempting to release glutamate once every 10 ms. [...] An EPSP occurring only 10 ms after a previous EPSP will arrive at a time when that previous EPSP is at its peak amplitude. [...] Thus, during a 100Hz stimulus train, each EPSP will add to the membrane depolarization caused by the previous EPSPs. [...] This synaptic summation drives the membrane potential toward values that could not be reached with single synaptic stimuli. [...] As the EPSPs summate, they will exceed the spike threshold.|$|E

50|$|The Black Widow Pulsar (B1957+20) is an {{eclipsing binary}} {{millisecond}} pulsar discovered in 1988.

Subsequent to this, other objects with similar features have been discovered, and the name has been applied to the class of millisecond pulsars with an ablating companion.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Chronic {{cancer and}} nonmalignant pain (CNMP) {{is a common}} and major health problem afflicting {{approximately}} 40 million persons in the US. Most cancer patients, and many patients with CNMP, require opioid analgesics to obtain adequate pain relief. Oral oxymorphone is a new formulation of an existing parenteral opioid that has become available {{for the treatment of}} significant pain: acute postoperative, chronic arthritis, chronic low back, and chronic cancer pain. Oxymorphone is a typical mu-opioid agonist that is effective in both immediate- and extended-release (IR and ER) formulations. Oxymorphone is more lipid soluble than morphine, resulting in a rapid onset of action when given in tablet formulation, with <b>a</b> <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> action <b>of</b> <b>approximately</b> 4 – 6 hours in IR and 12 hours in ER preparations. Oxymorphone provides excellent pain relief for significant pain, with typical opioid side effects that are usually mild or moderate in intensity.

The 40 Hz in REM sleep is characterized, as is that in the awake state, by a fronto-occipital phase shift over the head. This phase shift has <b>a</b> maximum <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>approximately</b> 12 - 13 msec. Because 40 -Hz oscillation is seen in wakefulness and in dreaming, we propose it to be a correlate of cognition, probably resultant from coherent 40 -Hz resonance between thalamocortical-specific and nonspecific loops.

40|$|Abstract A large {{rock and}} ice {{avalanche}} {{occurred on the}} north face of Mount Steele, southwest Yukon Territory, Canada, on July 24, 2007. In {{the days and weeks}} preceding the landslide, several smaller avalanches initiated from the same slope. The ice and rock debris traveled a maximum horizontal distance 5. 76 km with a maximum vertical descent of 2, 160 m, leaving a deposit 3. 66 km 2 in area on Steele Glacier. The seismic magnitude estimated from long-period surface waves (Ms) is 5. 2. Modeling of the waveforms suggests <b>an</b> estimated <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>approximately</b> 100 s and an average velocity of between 35 and 65 m/s. This landslide is one of 18 large rock avalanches known to have occurred since 1899 on slopes adjacent to glaciers in western Canada.
