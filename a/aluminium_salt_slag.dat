40|$|<b>Aluminium</b> <b>salt</b> <b>slag</b> (also {{known as}} {{aluminium}} salt cake), which {{is produced by}} the secondary aluminium industry, is formed during aluminium scrap/dross melting and contains 15 - 30 % aluminium oxide, 30 - 55 % sodium chloride, 15 - 30 % potassium chloride, 5 - 7 % metallic aluminium and impurities (carbides, nitrides, sulphides and phosphides). Depending on the raw mix the amount of salt slag produced per tonne of secondary aluminium ranges from 200 to 500. kg. As salt slag has been classified as toxic and hazardous waste, it should be managed {{in compliance with the}} current legislation. Its landfill disposal is forbidden in most of the European countries and it should be recycled and processed in a proper way by taking the environmental impact into consideration. This paper presents a review of the <b>aluminium</b> <b>salt</b> <b>slag</b> chemical and mineralogical characteristics, as well as various processes for metal recovery, recycling of sodium and potassium chlorides content back to the smelting process and preparation of value added products from the final non metallic residue. © 2012 Elsevier B.

40|$|Waste {{water from}} the <b>aluminium</b> <b>salt</b> <b>slag</b> {{processing}} plant ALUSCAN A/S in Norway discharges into the open recipient Sunndalsfjorden in western Norway. In October 1993 a diver survey {{in the vicinity of}} the discharge was performed. The survey showed visible effects closest to the outlet. A diverse marine flora and fauna was observed at 5 - 50 m from the discharge outlet. Some impact from the discharge was visible at distances ut to 50 - 100 m from the outlet. The effects of the discharge was enhanced by heavy sedimentation due to remaining sedimented materiale from the former iron mine. The discharge water is expected to rapidly dilute and disperse in the large recipient, causing minor eutrophication effects beyond 150 m from the discharge outlet. ALUSCAN A/...|$|E

30|$|<b>Aluminium</b> <b>salts</b> (<b>{{aluminium}}</b> hydroxide, aluminium phosphate, aluminium potassium sulphate) {{are widely}} used as adjuvants in vaccines and in allergy immunoterapy, due to their immunogenic effect. This activity, {{once thought to be}} due to “depot” effect, is probable caused by an increased activity of antigen presenting cells or by an increase of cytokines and complement production [74]. DTP, hepatitis A and B, Haemophilus Influentiae B vaccines are prepared adsorbing the antigens in either an aluminium hydroxide or aluminium phosphate gel. As an alternative, antigens are precipitated in a solution of alum. Interestingly, children are anyhow exposed to <b>aluminium</b> <b>salts</b> since they are also detectable in breast milk and in artificial powder milk. No anaphylaxis to <b>aluminium</b> <b>salts</b> have been reported. The most known and frequent reaction is a palpable nodule at the injection site [75]. Sterile abscesses [76], localized or systemic dermatitis due to <b>aluminium</b> <b>salts</b> have been reported [53].|$|R

50|$|Elemental {{aluminium}} {{cannot be}} produced by the electrolysis of an aqueous <b>aluminium</b> <b>salt</b> because hydronium ions readily oxidize elemental aluminium. Although a molten <b>aluminium</b> <b>salt</b> could be used instead, aluminium oxide has a melting point of 2072 °C so electrolysing it is impractical. In the Hall-Héroult process, alumina, Al2O3, is dissolved in molten synthetic cryolite, Na3AlF6, to lower its melting point for easier electrolysis.|$|R

50|$|Although ancient Greeks and Romans used <b>aluminium</b> <b>salts</b> as dyeing mordants and as {{astringents}} {{for dressing}} wounds, metallic aluminium was not refined until the modern era. Alum, a <b>salt</b> of <b>aluminium</b> and potassium, is still {{used as a}} styptic.|$|R

50|$|Many fuels used in {{incendiary}} devices require thickening {{for increased}} performance. <b>Aluminium</b> <b>salts</b> of fatty acids are frequently used. Some formulations (e.g. Napalm-B) use polymeric thickeners, namely polystyrene. Hydroxyl aluminium bis(2-ethylhexanoate) is also used. Thickened pyrophoric agent, a pyrophoric replacement of napalm, is a triethylaluminium thickened with polyisobutylene.|$|R

5000|$|Alum-tanned leather is {{transformed}} using <b>aluminium</b> <b>salts</b> {{mixed with a}} variety of binders and protein sources, such as flour and egg yolk.

50|$|These stains are {{commonly}} employed for histological studies. The mordants used to demonstrate nuclear and cytoplasmic structures are alum and iron, forming lakes or coloured complexes (dye-mordant-tissue complexes), the colour {{of which will}} depend on the <b>salt</b> used. <b>Aluminium</b> <b>salt</b> lakes are usually coloured blue-white, whereas ferric salt lakes are coloured blue-black.|$|R
5000|$|... "Napalm" [...] is a {{portmanteau}} of {{the names}} of two of the constituents of the thickening/gelling agent: co-precipitated <b>aluminium</b> <b>salts</b> of naphthenic and palmitic acids. [...] "Napalm B" [...] is the more modern version of napalm and, although distinctly different in its chemical composition, is often referred to simply as [...] "napalm".|$|R
5000|$|Because it is {{inexpensive}} and adds texture and [...] "mouth feel" [...] to processed foods (convenience food), palmitic acid and its sodium salt find wide use in foodstuffs.

50|$|In water purification, this {{compound}} {{is preferred}} {{in some cases}} because of its high charge, which makes it more effective at destabilizing and removing suspended materials than other <b>aluminium</b> <b>salts</b> such as <b>aluminium</b> sulfate, aluminium chloride and various forms of polyaluminium chloride and polyaluminium chlorisulfate, in which the aluminium structure results in a lower net charge than aluminium chlorohydrate. Further, {{the high degree of}} neutralization of the HCl results in minimal impact on treated water pH when compared to other <b>aluminium</b> and iron <b>salts.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{race for}} the commercially viable {{production}} of aluminium was won in 1886 by Paul Héroult and Charles M. Hall. The problem many researchers had with extracting aluminium was that electrolysis of an <b>aluminium</b> <b>salt</b> dissolved in water yields aluminium hydroxide. Both Hall and Héroult avoided this problem by dissolving aluminium oxide in a new solvent— fused cryolite (Na3AlF6).|$|R
30|$|In water, <b>aluminium</b> <b>salts</b> hydrolyze {{and give}} a variety of {{products}} including cationic species, which can adsorb on negative charged particles, and thus neutralize their charge. The particles get destabilized and aggregation occurs. Over dozing of coagulant leads to charge reversal and particles start restabilizing. A higher than the optimum dose of coagulant thus results in less turbidity removal. (Yukselen and Gregory 2004).|$|R
50|$|This {{compound}} is {{also used}} to control hyperphosphatemia (elevated phosphate, or phosphorus, levels in the blood) in people and animals suffering from kidney failure. Normally, the kidneys filter excess phosphate out from the blood, but kidney failure can cause phosphate to accumulate. The <b>aluminium</b> <b>salt,</b> when ingested, binds to phosphate in the intestines and reduce the amount of phosphorous that can be absorbed.|$|R
