5|$|The 2009 {{white paper}} {{outlined}} the replacement submarine as a 4,000-ton vessel fitted with land-attack cruise missiles {{in addition to}} torpedoes and anti-ship missiles, capable of launching and recovering covert operatives while submerged, and carrying surveillance and intelligence-gathering equipment. The project initially had four options: a Military-Off-The-Shelf (MOTS) design without modification, a MOTS design modified for Australian conditions, <b>an</b> <b>evolution</b> of an existing submarine, or a newly designed submarine. Nuclear propulsion was ruled out {{because of the lack}} of nuclear infrastructure and public opposition to nuclear technology. Designs initially considered for purchase or modification included the Spanish S-80 class, the French-designed Scorpène class, the German-designed Type 214, and Japan's Sōryū class, along with <b>an</b> <b>evolution</b> of the Collins.|$|E

5|$|Myers {{realised}} that normal, globe-shaped hot {{air passenger}} balloons {{were subject to}} the whim of {{the direction of the}} winds. He then thought that perhaps a passenger balloon could be controlled somehow to move against the flow.

His theory was that a symmetrical wave line spindle body would have less head resistance when passing through the air than did a blunt globe.|$|E
5|$|Sinclair eschewed {{the sound}} and lyrical content of her debut album Perfectionist (2011) in favour of a heavier atmosphere, driven by strong {{percussion}} and electric guitars.

5|$|The Crusades {{also led}} to the {{introduction}} of machicolations into Western architecture. Until the 13thcentury, the tops of towers had been surrounded by wooden galleries, allowing defenders to drop objects on assailants below. Although machicolations performed the same purpose as the wooden galleries, they were probably an Eastern invention rather than <b>an</b> <b>evolution</b> of the wooden form. Machicolations were used in the East long before the arrival of the Crusaders, and perhaps as early as {{the first half of the}} 8thcentury in Syria.|$|E
5|$|The use of aisles {{enabled the}} barn's architects to {{increase}} its width and by doing so, provided the maximum space for threshing floors.

5|$|Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) was {{designed}} by Microsoft to give higher-level access to a device's filesystem than USB mass storage, {{at the level of}} files rather than disk blocks. It also has optional DRM features. MTP {{was designed}} for use with portable media players, but it has since been adopted as the primary storage access protocol of the Android operating system from the version 4.1 Jelly Bean as well as Windows Phone 8 (Windows Phone 7 devices had used the Zune protocol which was <b>an</b> <b>evolution</b> of MTP). The primary {{reason for this is that}} MTP does not require exclusive access to the storage device the way UMS does, alleviating potential problems should an Android program request the storage while it is attached to a computer. The main drawback is that MTP is not as well supported outside of Windows operating systems.|$|E
5|$|Some of the {{gameplay}} {{elements were}} directly taken from Far Cry 3. Exotic locations, hunting, {{and the freedom}} for players to complete missions through different approaches were maintained in Far Cry 4. The team hoped that by incorporating and expanding upon on these ideas, while introducing new features, they could make Far Cry 4 <b>an</b> <b>evolution</b> for the series. As a result, {{the size of the}} game's outposts became larger and players were given more options to customize their weapons. The team also realized that players {{spent a lot of time}} interacting with the open world of Far Cry 3, and decided to put more effort and resources into the world's design and add more quests to the game.|$|E

5|$|Trials and Tribulations has {{received}} generally favorable reviews for the Nintendo DS, holding {{a score of}} 81/100 based on 45 reviews at the review aggregator Metacritic; meanwhile, the Wii version holds a Metacritic score of 67/100 based on 9 reviews, indicating mixed or average reviews. The North American Nintendo DS release was a success, with pre-orders more than double of Capcom's estimates, resulting in a shortage of it at both retailers and at Capcom's own online store. In 2010, IGN ranked the game as the 23rd best video game for the Nintendo DS, praising it for its writing and for being <b>an</b> <b>evolution</b> of the point-and-click adventure genre.|$|E
5|$|Architecture {{during the}} early English Renaissance was far less formal than that of {{mainland}} Europe and drew from a greater selection of motifs both ancient and modern, with less emphasis placed on the strict observance of rules derived from antique architecture. This {{has led to an}} argument that the style was <b>an</b> <b>evolution</b> of Gothic rather than an innovation imported from Europe. This argument is evident at Montacute, where Gothic pinnacles, albeit obelisk in form, are combined with Renaissance gables, pediments, classical statuary, ogee roofs and windows appearing as bands of glass. This profusion of large, mullioned windows, an innovation of their day, give the appearance that the principal façade is built entirely of glass; a similar fenestration was employed at Hardwick Hall in Derbyshire. However, despite the Dutch gables, a feature of the English Renaissance acquired as the style spread from France across the Low Countries to England, and the Gothic elements, much of the architectural influence is Italian.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the visuals and audio, the overall gameplay system remained mostly unchanged from that used since Final Fantasy V, using research done to promote player control. The initial decision was for battles to feature shifting camera angles. Battle arenas had a lower polygon count than field areas, which made picking out distinctive features for each one more difficult. The summon sequences benefited strongly from the switch to the cinematic style, as the team had struggled to portray their scale using 2D graphics. In his role as producer, Sakaguchi placed much of his effort into developing the battle system, also proposing the Materia system. Materia provided more character customization than previous Final Fantasy games: battles no longer revolved around characters with innate skills and roles in battle, as Materia could be reconfigured between battles. Nomura {{also contributed to the}} gameplay, creating the Limit Break system as <b>an</b> <b>evolution</b> of the Desperation Attacks used in Final Fantasy VI. The Limit Breaks served a purpose in gameplay while also bringing out each character's personality in battle.|$|E
5|$|Many {{species of}} Pokémon {{are capable of}} {{evolving}} into a larger and more powerful creature. The change is accompanied by stat changes, generally a modest increase, and access to {{a wider variety of}} attacks. There are multiple ways to trigger <b>an</b> <b>evolution</b> including reaching a particular level, using a special stone, or learning a specific attack. For example, at level 16 Bulbasaur is capable of evolving into Ivysaur. Most notably, the Normal-type Eevee is capable of evolving into eight different Pokémon: Jolteon (Electric), Flareon (Fire), Vaporeon (Water), Umbreon (Dark), Espeon (Psychic), Leafeon (Grass), Glaceon (Ice), and Sylveon (Fairy). In Generation VI, a new mechanic called Mega Evolution—as well as a subset of Mega Evolution called Primal Reversion—was introduced into the game. Unlike normal evolution, Mega Evolution and Primal Reversion last only for the duration of a battle, with the Pokémon reverting to its normal form at the end. Forty-eight Pokémon are capable of undergoing Mega Evolution or Primal Reversion as of the release of Sun and Moon. In contrast, some species such as Castform, Rotom, Unown, and Lycanroc undergo form changes that may provide stat buffs or changes and type alterations but are not considered new species.|$|E
5|$|The AN/APG-68, <b>an</b> <b>evolution</b> of the APG-66, was {{introduced}} with the F-16C/D Block 25. The APG-68 has greater range and resolution, {{as well as}} 25 operating modes, including ground-mapping, Doppler beam-sharpening, ground moving target indication, sea target, and track while scan (TWS) for up to 10 targets. The Block 40/42's APG-68(V)1 model added full compatibility with Lockheed Martin Low-Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infra-Red for Night (LANTIRN) pods, and a high-PRF pulse-Doppler track mode to provide continuous-wave radar (CW) target illumination for semi-active radar-homing (SARH) missiles like the AIM-7 Sparrow. Block 50/52 F-16s initially used the more reliable APG-68(V)5 which has a programmable signal processor employing Very-High-Speed Integrated Circuit (VHSIC) technology. The Advanced Block 50/52 (or 50+/52+) are equipped with the APG-68(V)9 radar, with a 30% greater air-to-air detection range and a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) mode for high-resolution mapping and target detection-recognition. In August 2004, Northrop Grumman were contracted to upgrade the APG-68 radars of Block 40/42/50/52 aircraft to the (V)10 standard, providing all-weather autonomous detection and targeting for Global Positioning System (GPS)-aided precision weapons, SAR mapping and terrain-following radar (TF) modes, as well as interleaving of all modes.|$|E
