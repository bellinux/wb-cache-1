5|$|Approximately 1 {{percent of}} tornadoes rotate in an <b>anticyclonic</b> {{direction}} in the northern hemisphere. Typically, systems as weak as landspouts and gustnadoes can rotate anticyclonically, and usually only those which form on the <b>anticyclonic</b> shear side of the descending rear flank downdraft (RFD) in a cyclonic supercell. On rare occasions, <b>anticyclonic</b> tornadoes form {{in association with the}} mesoanticyclone of an <b>anticyclonic</b> supercell, {{in the same manner as}} the typical cyclonic tornado, or as a companion tornado either as a satellite tornado or associated with <b>anticyclonic</b> eddies within a supercell.|$|E
5|$|A strong <b>anticyclonic</b> multivortex {{satellite}} tornado also formed {{southeast of}} the primary tornado at approximately 6:28pmCDT (2328UTC), and remained {{on the ground for}} 15 minutes before lifting at 6:43 (2343UTC). Such companion tornadoes tend to be observed with especially large and intense tornadoes, although this was the first documented multiple-vortex <b>anticyclonic</b> tornado of this kind.|$|E
5|$|Three {{long-lived}} <b>anticyclonic</b> features termed white ovals {{were observed}} in 1938. For several decades they remained as separate features in the atmosphere, sometimes approaching each other but never merging. Finally, two of the ovals merged in 1998, then absorbed the third in 2000, becoming Oval BA.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the African coast on July 19. The system headed westward through the Atlantic Ocean {{for the next}} week with no change in development. After entering the Caribbean Sea on July 26, convection began to come together two days later due to the influence of <b>anticyclonic</b> flow. The disturbance passed the Yucatan Peninsula on July 29 and entered the Gulf of Mexico. No circulation was found in the developing system, however.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Arlene {{originated}} {{out of an}} area of {{low pressure}} associated with a decaying frontal system along the North Carolina coastline on August8. Tracking towards the southeast in a gradual <b>anticyclonic</b> loop, the system slowly increased in organization and intensity. By August10, the low neared the Bahamas but remained disorganized. The following day, while located over Andros Island, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) upgraded the system to a tropical depression, the third of the season, based on its appearance on satellite imagery.|$|E
5|$|Physically, the {{cyclonic}} {{circulation of}} the storm advects environmental air poleward east of center and equatorial west of center. Because air must conserve its angular momentum, this flow configuration induces a cyclonic gyre equatorward and westward {{of the storm}} center and an <b>anticyclonic</b> gyre poleward and eastward of the storm center. The combined flow of these gyres acts to advect the storm slowly poleward and westward. This effect occurs {{even if there is}} zero environmental flow.|$|E
5|$|Upper-level jet streams. Associated with {{upper level}} jet streams is a {{phenomenon}} known as clear air turbulence (CAT), caused by vertical and horizontal wind shear connected to the wind gradient {{at the edge of}} the jet streams. The CAT is strongest on the <b>anticyclonic</b> shear side of the jet, usually next to or just below the axis of the jet.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after peaking in strength, Nicholas {{weakened}} due {{to increasing}} southwesterly wind shear, {{and the center}} of circulation briefly became exposed from the deep convection. In response to a break in the subtropical ridge, the storm turned to the north on October 18. Nicholas turned more to the west on October 20, and later on the winds in the storm decreased to minimal storm strength. Convection diminished greatly, though Nicholas unexpectedly re-strengthened as deep convection refired. After reaching winds of 50mph (85km/h), the storm again weakened due to increasing shear, and after turning to the northwest Nicholas degenerated into a tropical depression on October 23. Nicholas tracked northward in response to a break in the subtropical ridge, and on October 24, after degenerating to a remnant low pressure area, Nicholas lost what tropical characteristics it retained and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. The remnant storm executed a large <b>anticyclonic</b> loop, resulting in a westward motion and a brief re-intensification into an extratropical storm on October 29. The storm continued to the west along a warm front associated with a non-tropical low to its southwest, and executed a second <b>anticyclonic</b> loop to the south. On October 30, convection increased over the low-level circulation of what was left to Nicholas, and the National Hurricane Center indicated a potential for tropical or subtropical development as it moved towards warmer waters. The system executed a small cyclonic loop, and on October 31 the system organized into a tropical low. It turned westward towards a non-tropical low, and on November 1 the remnants of Nicholas was absorbed by the low.|$|E
5|$|Six years later, the Voyager {{missions}} {{vastly improved}} {{the understanding of}} the Galilean moons and discovered Jupiter's rings. They also confirmed that the Great Red Spot was <b>anticyclonic.</b> Comparison of images showed that the Red Spot had changed hue since the Pioneer missions, turning from orange to dark brown. A torus of ionized atoms was discovered along Io's orbital path, and volcanoes were found on the moon's surface, some in the process of erupting. As the spacecraft passed behind the planet, it observed flashes of lightning in the night side atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|As Esther {{began to}} {{parallel}} the coastline, a hurricane warning was issued for coastal areas from Long Island to Provincetown, Massachusetts on September 20, and were extended to Eastport, Maine early on September 21. All hurricane watches were discontinued on September 21 as Esther {{moved away from}} the New England coast, and all hurricane warnings were downgraded to gale warnings later that day as Esther passed near Nantucket and weakened to a tropical storm, and all warnings were discontinued on September 22 after the storm {{moved away from the}} coast. After Esther completed its <b>anticyclonic</b> loop over the northwestern Atlantic, a gale warning was again issued from Provincetown, Massachusetts to Eastport, Maine on September 25, and was discontinued the next day after Esther made its second landfall in Maine. Personnel on two offshore surveillance stations called the Texas Towers were evacuated; a third tower had collapsed during a storm in January 1961, prompting higher safety standards.|$|E
5|$|During the {{afternoon}} of September16, a reconnaissance plane recorded flight-level winds of 185km/h (115mph). Around this time, surface winds were estimated to be the same, making Helen a Category3 equivalent on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. Later that day, the storm made landfall near Cape Kushimoto. In Shionomisaki Lighthouse, just west of where the center of Helen passed, a barometric pressure of 955mbar (hPa; 28.26inHg) was recorded, the lowest {{in relation to the}} storm. As the system neared Hokkaido, it slowed down and began a multi-day <b>anticyclonic</b> loop. During this period, it merged with an upper-level low and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September19. The remnants of Helen then tracked across southern Hokkaido before dissipating just east of the island on September21.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the {{tropical}} depression tracked to the northwest, and was forecast to peak as a 50mph (80km/h) tropical storm while continuing on a northwest motion. Located within {{an area of}} weak wind shear, deep convection increased near the center, and banding features became more pronounced. <b>Anticyclonic</b> flow aloft and a moist troposphere allowed the depression to intensity into Tropical Storm Sergio on November 14. Shortly after becoming a tropical storm, Sergio turned to the southeast, believed {{to be due to}} the flow associated with a mid- to upper-level trough to its northeast. It steadily intensified, and Sergio attained hurricane status on November 15 while located about 420miles (675km) southwest of Acapulco. With a small, distinct eye located {{in the center of the}} deep convection, Sergio rapidly intensified to attain peak winds of 110mph (175km/h) about 6hours after becoming a hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Isobaric {{analysis}} is performed on these maps, which involves {{the construction of}} lines of equal mean sea level pressure. The innermost closed lines indicate the positions of relative maxima and minima in the pressure field. The minima are called low-pressure areas while the maxima are called high-pressure areas. Highs are often shown as H's whereas lows are shown as L's. Elongated areas of low pressure, or troughs, are sometimes plotted as thick, brown dashed lines down the trough axis. Isobars are commonly used to place surface boundaries from the horse latitudes poleward, while streamline analyses {{are used in the}} tropics. A streamline {{analysis is}} a series of arrows oriented parallel to wind, showing wind motion within a certain geographic area. C's depict cyclonic flow or likely areas of low pressure, while A's depict <b>anticyclonic</b> flow or likely positions of high-pressure areas. An area of confluent streamlines shows the location of shearlines within the tropics and subtropics.|$|E
5|$|On July24, {{the storm}} crossed 140°W, {{entering}} the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's (CPHC) area of responsibility. Upon entering the region, Gilma became the fourth consecutive cyclone {{to move into}} the CPHC region. Several hours later, Gilma attained its peak intensity as a Category 5 hurricane with winds of 160mph (260km/h) and a barometric pressure estimated at 920mbar (hPa; 27.17inHg). After maintaining this intensity for roughly 12hours, the storm abruptly weakened. Within a few hours, maximum winds decreased by 45mph (75km/h) to 115mph (185km/h), a low-end Category 3 hurricane. The reason for the sudden weakening is unknown; although the tropical upper tropospheric trough originally located over the storm, providing it with a favorable <b>anticyclonic</b> flow, shifted westward to the International Date Line. Additionally, the storm's eye became obscured by cirrus clouds.|$|E
5|$|On October11, 2015, {{an area of}} {{disturbed}} weather traversed Central America {{and emerged}} over the eastern Pacific Ocean. The disturbance moved slowly {{over the next few}} days, and coalesced into a Central American gyre—a broad monsoonal circulation. A tropical wave crossed the Caribbean Sea and eventually reached Central America on October15; the two systems merged the following day near the Gulf of Tehuantepec. A concurrent Tehuantepec gap wind event on the western side of the gyre, complimented by <b>anticyclonic</b> flow behind a cold front, enhanced vorticity and spurred the formation of an elongated area of low pressure on October17. The broad system spanned several hundred miles from the Yucatán Peninsula into the eastern Pacific. A large, disorganized area of convection—showers and thunderstorms—accompanied the system, increasing in coverage substantially throughout the day. A strong pulse in the Madden–Julian oscillation—a propagating climate pattern associated with increased tropical cyclogenesis—may have aided in creating favorable conditions for further development.|$|E
5|$|The {{depression}} rapidly {{organized and}} attained tropical storm status with winds of 50mph (80km/h) just six hours after forming, upon {{which it was}} named Danielle. In response to an approaching trough, Danielle initially moved to the northeast. However, the trough outran the system, and a developing high pressure system to its north resulted in Danielle executing a tight, <b>anticyclonic</b> loop on September 23 to the 24th. The storm strengthened as it turned to the northwest, and reached a peak of 65mph (105km/h) winds on September 25 while just off the northeastern coast of North Carolina. Danielle turned to the north-northwest, and made landfall on the Eastern Shore of Virginia late on the 25th. It rapidly weakened over land, and dissipated over eastern Pennsylvania on September 26.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Jose {{was first}} {{identified}} as a tropical wave that moved off the western coast of Africa on August8, 2005. On August13, the system spawned Tropical Depression Ten over the central Atlantic; the wave itself continued westward, entering the Caribbean on August17. Slight development took place as the system moved over the Yucatán Peninsula; however, {{by the time it}} entered the Bay of Campeche on August21, little convection was associated with the system. The following morning, convection exploded under highly favorable divergence from an upper-level <b>anticyclonic</b> flow. According to readings from the QuikSCAT satellite, a well-defined low pressure center developed by 1200UTC, prompting the National Hurricane Center to classify the system as Tropical Depression Eleven. At this time, the depression was situated roughly 110mi (175km) east of Veracruz, Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Zeta {{originated}} from an upper-level trough that interacted with a weakening frontal system in late-December 2005. By December28, the trough had {{developed into a}} low pressure area roughly 750mi (1,210km) west-northwest of the Cape Verde Islands. The following day, a low-level circulation developed and convective activity began to increase around the low. By December30, sufficient shower and thunderstorm activity had developed for the National Hurricane Center (NHC) to classify it as a tropical cyclone. Over the following several hours, convective banding developed around the storm's center and by 0600UTC, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Zeta, the record 28th tropical or subtropical cyclone to form during the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. Operationally, however, the NHC did not begin issuing advisories on Zeta until 1700UTC. Traveling slowly northwestward {{in response to a}} mid-level low to the southwest, the storm gradually intensified in a region of favorable <b>anticyclonic</b> outflow.|$|E
5|$|A low {{pressure}} {{system on the}} tail end of a stationary cold front organized into a subtropical depression on August 8 near the South Carolina coast, and drifted southward. Convection became more organized, and the storm was classified Tropical Depression Three on August 10 over the Bahamas. It executed an <b>anticyclonic</b> loop to the northeast, and was estimated to have attained tropical storm status on August 11, based on reports from Hurricane Hunters. Small cells in the ridge of high pressure caused Arlene to take an unusual track to the east, with two southward jogs in its path. A trough of {{low pressure}} near Bermuda initially inhibited strengthening. However, after high pressures to its east forced the storm northward, more favorable conditions allowed Arlene to intensify into a hurricane on August 22. Operationally, it was upgraded two days earlier, based on the appearance of an eye feature on satellite imagery. After becoming a hurricane, Arlene accelerated to the northeast into the cold waters of the north Atlantic Ocean, and on August 23 it became extratropical about halfway between Newfoundland and Ireland. The extratropical remnants turned to the southeast and later to the east, making landfall on the Iberian Peninsula before dissipating on August 28 over Spain.|$|E
5|$|Although Utor tracked {{back over}} water on December10, the storm began to weaken due to {{increasing}} wind shear and dry {{air from the}} west. As a result, the JMA downgraded Utor to severe tropical storm intensity upon its emergence into the South China Sea. Despite these hindering conditions, the storm's improved outflow was sufficient enough to enable redevelopment. At 18:00UTC on December11, the JMA once again upgraded the system to typhoon strength southeast of Hainan. Intensification continued until Utor peaked with winds of 155km/h (100mph) and a minimum pressure of 945mbar (hPa; 27.91inHg) the next day. This strength was held for only twelve hours before Utor's outflow began to succumb to the wind shear and dry air stemming from the monsoonal flow it had previously suppressed. Traveling in a tight clockwise loop, the typhoon rapidly weakened on December13; by the following day Utor was a minimal tropical storm. At 06:00UTC on December14, the storm degenerated into a tropical depression and continued to execute a small <b>anticyclonic</b> loop before dissipating on December15.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Amy was {{an intense}} and deadly {{tropical}} cyclone that struck {{areas of the}} central Philippines in December1951. Impacting the archipelago during the 1951 eruption of Mount Hibok-Hibok, Amy exacerbated {{the effects of the}} volcano, greatly increasing the number of resulting deaths. The fifteenth named storm and fourteenth typhoon within the western Pacific Ocean that year, Amy developed from an area of low pressure near the Kwajalein Atoll on December3. Tracking in a general westward direction, the storm quickly intensified to reach typhoon intensity the next day. However, the typhoon's asymmetricity resulted in a fluctuation of intensity over the following few days. Afterwards, Amy intensified to reach its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 220km/h (140mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 950mbar (hPa; 28.05inHg) on December8. Over the ensuing two days, Amy moved over several islands in the central Philippines before emerging in the South China Sea on December11 as the equivalent of a minimal typhoon. Shortly after, the tropical cyclone executed a tight <b>anticyclonic</b> loop while oscillating in strength several times before eventually weakening and dissipating on December17, just east of Vietnam.|$|E
25|$|The {{important}} {{cases of}} cyclonic and <b>anticyclonic</b> circulations are discussed next.|$|E
25|$|Farther {{away from}} point R*, the <b>anticyclonic</b> wind slows down and {{approaches}} the geostrophic value with decreasingly larger speeds.|$|E
25|$|At that {{distance}} the first <b>anticyclonic</b> wind {{has the same}} speed as the cyclostrophic winds (point Q), and half of that of the inertial wind (point P).|$|E
25|$|However, the {{cyclonic}} and <b>anticyclonic</b> gradient speeds {{approach it}} as the radius of curvature becomes indefinitely large—geostrophic balance is indeed the limiting case of gradient flow for vanishing centripetal acceleration (that is, for pressure and Coriolis force exactly balancing out).|$|E
25|$|The latest {{concept of}} the origin of the Driftless Area is the pre-Illinoian {{continental}} glacial ice flowing over the Driftless Area and depositing on it pre-Illinoian till, which is more than 790,000 years old. When the ice retreated and uncovered the area, periglacial erosion removed it: <b>Anticyclonic</b> snow-bearing winds episodically dropped large amounts of snow, which then gradually removed superficial sediment by solifluction and snowmelt overland flow, so-called sheetwash.|$|E
25|$|The extreme {{absence of}} {{westerly}} winds meant that unlike 1956, 1973 and 1974, the year 1950 was not uniformly wet over Australia: indeed, {{in much of}} Tasmania and Western Australia the <b>anticyclonic</b> control associated with the moist airflow over New South Wales and Queensland produced unusually dry conditions. (A remarkable statistic associated with this is that, although the fourth wettest year averaged over Australia, 1950 had {{a higher proportion of}} Australia in the lowest 10 percent than 68 out of 106 other years since 1900.|$|E
25|$|A severe {{drought in}} the United Kingdom {{needs to have}} the high {{pressure}} {{in charge of the}} weather for an extended period, commonly for weeks or even months at a time. Most often sea surface temperature anomalies in the Atlantic and intensification of the mid latitude westerlies in the Pacific can bring a stable anticyclone, meaning that the pressure can remain above average for weeks, or even months at a time, allowing the heat to build and dry weather to continue during the <b>anticyclonic</b> system.|$|E
25|$|Observations of the Red Spot Jr. storm suggest Jupiter {{could be}} in a period of global climate change. This is {{hypothesized}} to be part of an approximately 70 year global climate cycle, characterized by the relatively rapid forming and subsequent slow erosion and merging of cyclonic and <b>anticyclonic</b> vortices in Jupiter's atmosphere. These vortices facilitate the heat exchange between poles and equator. If they have sufficiently eroded, heat exchange is strongly reduced and regional temperatures may shift by as much as 10 K, with the poles cooling down and the equator region heating up. The resulting large temperature differential destabilizes the atmosphere and thereby leads to the creation of new vortices.|$|E
25|$|Jupiter {{is covered}} with a cloud layer about 50km deep. The clouds are {{composed}} of ammonia crystals and possibly ammonium hydrosulfide. The clouds are located in the tropopause and are arranged into bands of different latitudes, known as tropical regions. These are sub-divided into lighter-hued zones and darker belts. The interactions of these conflicting circulation patterns cause storms and turbulence. The best-known feature of the cloud layer is the Great Red Spot, a persistent <b>anticyclonic</b> storm located 22° south of the equator that is larger than Earth. In 2000, an atmospheric feature formed in the southern hemisphere that is similar in appearance to the Great Red Spot, but smaller in size. The feature was named Oval BA, and has been nicknamed Red Spot Junior.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} temperature, {{a column of}} dry air will be denser or heavier than a column of air {{containing}} any water vapor, the molar mass of diatomic nitrogen and diatomic oxygen both being greater than the molar mass of water. Thus, any volume of dry air will sink if placed in a larger volume of moist air. Also, a volume of moist air will rise or be buoyant if placed in a larger region of dry air. As the temperature rises the proportion of water vapor in the air increases, and its buoyancy will increase. The increase in buoyancy can have a significant atmospheric impact, giving rise to powerful, moisture rich, upward air currents when the air temperature and sea temperature reaches 25°C or above. This phenomenon provides a significant driving force for cyclonic and <b>anticyclonic</b> weather systems (typhoons and hurricanes).|$|E
25|$|The {{behavior}} and appearance of UDS and its bright companion {{were similar to}} Neptunian Great Dark Spots (GDS) and their bright companions, respectively, though UDS was significantly smaller. This similarity suggests {{that they have the}} same origin. GDS were hypothesized to be <b>anticyclonic</b> vortices in the atmosphere of Neptune, whereas their bright companions were thought to be methane clouds formed in places, where the air is rising (orographic clouds). UDS is supposed to have a similar nature, although it looked differently from GDS at some wavelengths. Although GDS had the highest contrast at 0.47μm, UDS was not visible at this wavelength. On the other hand, UDS demonstrated the highest contrast at 1.6μm, where GDS were not detected. This implies that dark spots on the two ice giants are located at somewhat different pressure levels—the Uranian feature probably lies near 4bar. The dark color of UDS (as well as GDS) may be caused by thinning of the underlying hydrogen sulfide or ammonium hydrosulfide clouds.|$|E
25|$|In the North Pacific Ocean, the tritium (introduced as bomb tritium in the Northern Hemisphere) {{spread in}} three dimensions. There were {{subsurface}} maxima {{in the middle}} and low latitude regions, which is indicative of lateral mixing (advection) and diffusion processes along lines of constant potential density (isopycnals) in the upper ocean. Some of these maxima even correlate well with salinity extrema. In order to obtain the structure for ocean circulation, the tritium concentrations were mapped on 3 surfaces of constant potential density (23.90, 26.02, and 26.81). Results indicated that the tritium was well-mixed (at 6 to 7nbsp&TU) on the 26.81 isopycnal in the subarctic cyclonic gyre and there appeared to be a slow exchange of tritium (relative to shallower isopycnals) between this gyre and the <b>anticyclonic</b> gyre to the south; also, the tritium on the 23.90 and 26.02 surfaces appeared to be exchanged at a slower rate between the central gyre of the North Pacific and the equatorial regions.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{dramatic}} {{ways in which}} they attain food and interact with raptors of their own and other species, the daily life of golden eagles is often rather uneventful. In Idaho, adult male golden eagles were observed to sit awake on a perch for an average of 78% of daylight, whereas adult females sat on nest or perched for an average of 85% of the day. During the peak of summer in Utah, hunting and territorial flights occurred mostly between 9:00 and 11:00 am and 4:00 and 6:00 pm, with the remaining 15 or so hours of daylight spent perching or resting. When conditions are heavily <b>anticyclonic,</b> there is less soaring during the day. During winter in Scotland, golden eagles soar frequently in order to scan the environment for carrion. In the more wooded environments of Norway during autumn and winter, much less aerial activity is reported, since the eagles tend to avoid detection by actively contour-hunting rather than looking for carrion. Golden eagles are believed to sleep through much of the night. Although usually highly solitary outside of the bond between breeding pairs, exceptionally cold weather in winter may cause eagles to put their usual guard down and perch together. The largest known congregation of golden eagles was observed on an extremely cold winter’s night in eastern Idaho when 124 individuals were observed perched closely along a line of 85 power poles.|$|E
500|$|Strong but {{vertically}} shallow high-pressure systems {{moving from}} higher latitudes to lower latitudes {{in the northern}} hemisphere are associated with continental arctic air masses. [...] The low, sharp temperature inversion can lead to areas of persistent stratocumulus or stratus cloud, known in colloquial terms as <b>anticyclonic</b> gloom. The type of weather brought about by an anticyclone depends on its origin. For example, extensions of the Azores high bubble pressure may bring about <b>anticyclonic</b> gloom during the winter, as they are warmed at the base and will trap moisture as they move over the warmer oceans. High pressures that build {{to the north and}} extend southwards will often bring clear weather. This is due to being cooled at the base (as opposed to warmed), which helps prevent clouds from forming. [...] The highest barometric pressure ever recorded on Earth was [...] measured in Tonsontsengel, Mongolia on 19 December 2001.|$|E
500|$|In November 1966, New York City was {{experiencing}} unseasonably warm [...] "Indian summer" [...] weather. A cold front from Canada brought clean {{air to the}} city on November 19, but the cold front was {{held in place by}} pressure from the higher atmosphere. An <b>anticyclonic</b> temperature inversion—in other words, a warm, mostly stationary air mass located atop a cooler air mass—formed over the East Coast on November 20.|$|E
