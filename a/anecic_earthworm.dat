We investigated {{the effects of the}} <b>anecic</b> <b>earthworm</b> Lumbricus centralis on fresh carbon (C) incorporation, soil organic matter composition, protists, and nematodes of a Cambisol under grassland. We used plant material labelled with stable isotope tracers to detect fresh C input around earthworm-occupied burrows or around burrows from which the earthworm had been removed. After 50  days, we sampled soil (0 [...] 10  cm depth) in concentric layers around the burrows, distinguishing between drilosphere (0 [...] 8  mm) and bulk soil (50 [...] 75  mm). L. centralis effectively incorporated fresh C into the drilosphere, and this shifted soil organic matter amount and chemistry: total soil sugar content was increased compared to unoccupied drilosphere and bulk soil, and the contribution of plant-derived sugars to soil organic matter was enhanced. Earthworms also shifted the spatial distribution of soil C towards the drilosphere. The total abundance of protists and nematodes was only slightly higher in earthworm-occupied drilosphere, but strong positive effects were found for some protist clades (e. g. Stenamoeba spp.). Additional data for the co-occurring <b>anecic</b> <b>earthworm</b> species Aporrectodea longa showed that it incorporated fresh C less than L. centralis, suggesting that the two species may have different effects on soil C distribution and organic matter quality...|$|E

40|$|Background {{and aims}} - Intense rains are {{becoming}} more frequent. By causing waterlogging, they may increase soil erosion and soil surface compaction, hamper seedling establishment, and reduce plant growth. Since <b>anecic</b> <b>earthworms</b> make vertical burrows that improve water infiltration, we hypothesised that they can counteract such disturbance. Methods - In a field experiment, intact soil mesocosms with ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum), with or without introduced adult Lumbricus terrestris, underwent either a precipitation regime with two intense rain events (36 mm, at {{beginning and end of}} spring), or a control regime with the same cumulative rainfall but no intense events. Short-term response of soil moisture and lagged response of plant growth were measured, and soil macroporosity was quantified. Results - Intense rains reduced ryegrass shoot biomass (by 16 – 21 % on average) only in the absence of earthworms. Waterlogging duration aboveground was not affected, whereas soil moisture contents after intense rainfall tended to drop faster with earthworms present. Continuous vertical macropores were found only in the mesocosms to which earthworms had been added. The number of such macropores was 2. 4 times higher under the intense precipitation regime, despite similar earthworm survival. Conclusions - We found that <b>anecic</b> <b>earthworms</b> can offset negative effects of intense rainfall on plant growth aboveground. Underlying mechanisms, such as macropore formation and enhanced nutrient cycling, are discussed.

40|$|In the Oxisols of {{the eastern}} plains of Colombia, the large native <b>anecic</b> <b>earthworm</b> Martiodrilus sp. is an {{abundant}} ecosystem engineer producing long-lasting casts and burrows. Casts deposited in the soil by this species have been estimated at several tonnes per hectare per year. The physical and chemical processes occurring in these casts have never been studied. In this study, we compared the dynamics of water content (WC), total C (C-tot), and available N (N-avail) contents, and the distribution in size of aggregates in ageing below-ground casts of this species and in the bulk soil. In a native herbaceous savannah and a sown grass/legume pasture (Brachiaria humidicola, Arachis pintoi, Desmodium ovalifolium and Stylosanthes capitata), fresh surface casts were experimentally injected into artificial burrows of 1 cm O and 10 cm depth and sampled at different dates during a total period of 120 days. The injection procedure used resulted in a 34 % decrease in WC of the casts from the sown pasture and reduced the mean mass diameter (MMD) of the aggregates of casts from the savannah by 19 %. Other properties were not significantly affected by the procedure. For injected casts in both grasslands, MMD and C-tot were stable during cast ageing while WC and N-avail were initially at levels several {{times higher than the}} bulk soil and decreased to similar bulk soil values with ageing. The C-tot was twice and one third higher in casts compared with the bulk soil in the pasture and the savannah, respectively. Overall means for cast MMD (8. 3 and 7. 4 mm) were twice as high as those in the bulk soil (3. 8 mm) in the savannah and the pasture, respectively. However, MMD was not significantly different between the casts and the bulk soil in two occasions in the pasture. Available nitrogen (N-avail) in injected casts was initially greater than bulk soil levels, reaching maximum levels just after injection (116 and 93 mg kg(- 1)) and remained significantly greater during 1 - 2 weeks, in the savannah and the pasture, respectively. In conclusion, the tonnes of casts deposited in the soil profile by Martiodrilus sp. each year are likely to contribute greatly to plant nutrition and to the regulation of the soil structure.

The development of biological control approaches, using organisms such as earthworms, represents a potential alternative strategy for eyespot control.

We assessed necrosis frequency, necrosis severity, wheat biomass, resource allocation and soil mineral concentrations. Disease incidence was lower in the presence of earthworms: the frequency of necrosis was 44 % lower for Soissons and 70 % lower for Aubusson. Necrosis severity was also lower for both cultivars (50 % lower for Soissons and 80 % lower for Aubusson) in the presence of earthworms. Earthworms had no detectable effect on the shoot and root biomasses of plants exposed to the fungus, but they modified resource allocation between plant organs and nutrient translocation within the plant.

40|$|Plant {{productivity}} and other ecosystem functions often increase with plant diversity {{at a local}} scale. Alongside various plant-centered explanations for this pattern, there is accumulating evidence that multi-trophic interactions shape this relationship. Here, we investigated {{for the first time}} if plant diversity effects on ecosystem functioning are mediated or driven by decomposer animal diversity and identity using a double-diversity microcosm experiment. We show that many ecosystem processes and ecosystem multifunctionality (herbaceous shoot biomass production, litter removal, and N uptake) were affected by both plant and decomposer diversity, with ecosystem process rates often being maximal at intermediate to high plant and decomposer diversity and minimal at both low plant and decomposer diversity. Decomposers relaxed interspecific plant competition by enlarging chemical (increased N uptake and surface-litter decomposition) and spatial (increasing deep-root biomass) habitat space and by promoting plant complementarity. <b>Anecic</b> <b>earthworms</b> and isopods functioned as key decomposers; although decomposer diversity effects did not solely rely on these two decomposer species, positive plant net biodiversity and complementarity effects only occurred in the absence of isopods and the presence of <b>anecic</b> <b>earthworms.</b> Using a structural equation model, we explained 76 % of the variance in plant complementarity, identified direct and indirect effect paths, and showed that the presence of key decomposers accounted for approximately three-quarters of the explained variance.

After 45 days, earthworms were significantly enriched in C- 13 and N- 15 as a result of feeding on the plant litter.

Because anecic worms {{are known to have}} a variable feeding behaviour and can show dietary changes during ontogeny, additional immature and mature specimens of A. longa were also collected from the same site in January 2004.

40|$|Ecological {{functions}} of earthworms in soil Walter S. Andriuzzi Abstract Earthworms {{are known to}} play an important role in soil structure and fertility, but there are still big knowledge gaps on the functional ecology of distinct earthworm species, on their own and in interaction with other species. This thesis investigated how earthworms affect soil biochemical and biophysical functioning, and other organisms such as plants and smaller soil organisms. Two field experiments with stable isotope tracers were performed to investigate how anecic earthworms (which feed on organic matter at the soil surface and dig deep burrows) transfer carbon and nitrogen from fresh plant litter into soil, and how this in turn affects soil organic matter composition, protists and nematodes. Another field experiment tested whether the <b>anecic</b> <b>earthworm</b> Lumbricus terrestris can counteract negative effects of intense rainfall on soil and plants (ryegrass). A greenhouse experiment was carried out to study how co-occurring earthworm species – two anecic and one endogeic (smaller, soil-feeding) – affect transfer of nitrogen from dung to soil and plants, nitrogen retention in soil, and plant growth. For the latter experiment, a method to produce herbivore (rabbit) dung triple-labelled with carbon, nitrogen and sulphur stable isotopes was developed. Overall, the findings highlight important {{functions of}} earthworms in carbon and nitrogen cycling, soil biophysical structure maintenance due to burrow formation, and resulting biotic interactions. A novel finding was that the sphere of influence of anecic earthworms in soil (the ‘drilosphere’) is a much larger biochemical and biological hotspot than hitherto assumed. Rapid movement of carbon and nitrogen from surface to soil thanks to <b>anecic</b> <b>earthworm</b> activity resulted in spatial heterogeneity in soil carbon content, organic matter composition, and density of smaller eukaryotes (e. g. bacterial-feeding protists). Evidence was found that distinct earthworm anecic species may have dissimilar effects on soil biochemistry and plant growth, and that both anecic and endogeic earthworms may feed on surface organic matter (dung). This shows that the validity of earthworm ecological groups depends on the function under study, and suggests that, for some research questions, species identity should not be neglected; other approaches to quantify ecological differences between species (e. g. functional traits) are appraised. Finally, L. terrestris was found to ameliorate the disturbance of intense rain on plants, giving evidence to the idea that some components of soil biodiversity may contribute to ecosystem stability in the face of disturbance.                          ...|$|E

This method is well suited to establish pore size structure {{in the context of}} habitat, because it measures the stepwise intrusion of mercury from the outside of the aggregate into ever smaller pores. The progress of mercury into the aggregate interior thus resembles potential paths of a nematode into accessible habitable pore spaces residing in an aggregate.

Elevated CO 2 (580 ppmv) reduced litter N (? 12 %) with a corresponding increase in C:N ratio, especiallyfor A. glutinosa. In the field, elevated CO 2 caused a shift in overall population composition, mainly char-acterised by reduced anecic biomass (? 25 %); endogeic and epigeic species were less affected.

For both species, we observed a reduction in porosity in the inner layer {{and to a lesser extent}} in the outer layer of burrow walls as compared to the surrounding soil.

Enzymatic activities and C and N content of burrow walls and casts were enhanced compared to the parent material. The behaviour of earthworms in, e. g. incorporation of litter into burrows, selection of the finest soil particles providing adsorption sites for enzymes, re-using burrows resulting in a frequent input of mucus to the burrow walls, may explain the observed differences. These differences were more or less pronounced depending on the morphoecological characteristics of the earthworms. The results indicate that earthworm burrow walls may influence the movement of water and solutes from channels to soi...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate interactions of Lumbricus terrestris juveniles with adults and with inherited burrow systems. An experiment was set up using a two dimensional Evans ’ boxes microcosm. Adult L. terrestris were added to 16 boxes (one individual per box) and kept in darkness at 17 °C along with eight unoccupied boxes for two months. The adult L. terrestris were removed from eight randomly selected boxes, and L. terrestris juveniles were added (one juvenile per box), composing three treatments with eight replicates: 1, with an adult in an inherited burrow (ABJ); 2, alone in an inherited burrow (BJ); and 3, alone in a previously uninhabited box (J). The proportion of juveniles occupying adult burrows observed was signifi cantly different in treatments ABJ (48 %) and BJ (75 %). The mean mass of juveniles at experimental termination differed signifi cantly among treatments and was greater in treatment J (4. 04 ± 0. 39 g) {{in comparison to the}} BJ (3. 09 ± 0. 93 g) and ABJ treatments (2. 13 ± 0. 64 g). Results suggest a negative infl uence of both the presence of an adult and its burrow system on juvenile growth. Intraspecifi c competition partially explained this, but further investigation is required to examine how an inherited environment (i. e. burrow) could negatively affect the growth of juveniles.

40|$|Earthworms are key {{organisms in}} forest {{ecosystems}} because they incorporate organic material {{into the soil}} and affect the activity of other soil organisms. Here, we investigated how tree species affect earthworm communities via litter and soil characteristics. In a 36 -year old common garden experiment, replicated six times over Denmark, six tree species were planted in blocks: sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus), beech (Fagus sylvatica), ash (Fraxinus excelsior), Norway spruce (Picea abies), pedunculate oak (Quercus robur) and lime (Tilia cordata). We studied the chemical characteristics of soil and foliar litter, and determined the forest floor turnover rate and the density and biomass of the earthworm species occurring in the stands. Tree species significantly affected earthworm communities via leaf litter and/or soil characteristics. <b>Anecic</b> <b>earthworms</b> were abundant under Fraxinus, Acer and Tilia, which is related to calcium-rich litter and low soil acidification. Epigeic earthworms were indifferent to calcium content in leaf litter and were shown to be mainly related to soil moisture content and litter C:P ratios. Almost no earthworms were found in Picea stands, likely because of the combined effects of recalcitrant litter, low pH and low soil moisture content...|$|R
40|$|Little {{is known}} about exotic {{earthworms}} (Oligochaeta: Lumbricidae) in Alaska outside its southeastern panhandle. This study documents the distribution of exotic earthworms in the relatively undisturbed Kenai National Wildlife Refuge (KNWR), a large, primarily wilderness refuge in southcentral Alaska. We sampled 69 sites near boat launches, along road corridors, and in low human impact areas > 5 km from the road, finding three species of earthworms (Dendrobaena octaedra, Dendrodrilus rubidus, and Lumbricus terrestris). Most road sites (90 %) and boat launches (80 %) contained earthworms; half (50 %) of low human impact sites contained earthworms. Distance to roads was the only significant factor in predicting earthworm occurrence; soil pH, soil moisture, leaf litter depth, and vegetation cover were not. The disparate distributions of these three species suggest that within the KNWR road construction and vehicle traffic {{played a role in}} dispersal of the widespread, abundant Dendrobaena octaedra and uncommon Dendrodrilus rubidus; bait abandonment appeared to be the primary method of introduction of Lumbricus terrestris. While the distribution of harmful <b>anecic</b> <b>earthworms</b> in KNWR is currently limited, the prohibition of Lumbricus spp. as bait within conservation units in Alaska may be warranted...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the role of}} abiotic (texture, calcium carbonates or iron) and biotic parameters (earthworm and enchytraeid activities) on the initial phases of soil aggregation. Our research focused on humus forms in alluvial soils, which are considered as young and heterogeneous environments. We hypothesized that the soil structure formation is determined by both {{the nature of the}} recent alluvial deposits and the soil fauna. For this purpose, six sites were chosen throughout two types of softwood forests (willow and alder forest) representing two stages of vegetation succession. Evidence of soil texture influence on aggregate stability was observed. A dominance of a coarse sand fraction caused a quick colonization of enchytraeids and epigeic earthworms while a silty texture favoured the presence of <b>anecic</b> <b>earthworms,</b> thus increasing the aggregate stabilisation. Iron forms, acting as cementing agents, were observed in the coarse silt, while calcium carbonates were equally distributed among the textural fractions. Active calcium carbonate fraction, binding organic matter with mineral components, was not found in the coarse sand fraction. In conclusion, the tree age cannot alone be used as an indicator of the humus form evolution but biological and physicochemical parameters also influence the initial steps of soil structuration...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} decade, X-ray {{tomography}} was successfully adopted {{as a mean to}} study earthworm burrow systems under natural or artificial conditions. However this method has some limitations such {{the size of}} the soil core, the existence of a border effect, and cost. Recently a new apparatus, called the “Colonne Gamma”, was developed that enabled to study the trajectory of radio-labelled earthworm belonging to different species in soil cores. The accurate knowledge of (i) the burrowing behaviour of earthworm and (ii) the 3 D characteristics of the burrow systems gave the necessary information to develop a simulator. The input parameters are: (i) the earthworm community (and principally the ratio anecic/endogeic), (ii) the interaction between earthworms (avoidance or not) and (iii) the rate of burrow refilling. Hundred simulations were made for each parameter set and several output parameters were computed such as (i) volume and area of burrows connected to the surface and (ii) the verticality of the burrow systems. The first set of parameters was used in another model to simulate water flow through the burrow systems. Interestingly, we observed that increasing interactions between earthworms increased the verticality of the burrow systems. Regarding water flow, we observed that the key parameters were unsurprisingly the proportion of <b>anecic</b> <b>earthworm</b> and the intensity of the burrow refilling. These examples illustrate the potential use of our simulator to study the effect of behavioural parameters on the resulting burrow systems...|$|E
40|$|In orchards, {{cover crops}} are {{interesting}} alternative strategies to tillage or chemical herbicides for managing weeds {{in the tree}} row. However, {{little is known about}} the effect of cover crops on agronomic properties and soil biology in organic orchards. To fill this gap, the effects of two weed managements, a White clover cover crop (CC) versus classical tillage practice (T) on the tree row, were assessed in an irrigated organic Peach orchard. White clover was sown in 2004, 2006 and 2009 in the tree row and ploughed in 2006 and 2008. Root density, earthworm density, water infiltration rate, nitrogen content and water availability were measured in the soil, in the tree row. In 2009, peach root density observed in the superficial layers was higher in CC treatment. Sampling dates and treatment have a significant effect on total earthworm density with higher abundance observed in CC. However, no difference was observed between CC and T <b>anecic</b> <b>earthworm</b> groups known to make large and vertical burrows. Infiltration rate measured with the simplified Beerkan method was higher in CC treatment. This could be explained by the thick superficial root mat which was associated to a significant higher epigeic earthworm density in CC. Whereas nitrogen supplies were twice lower in CC treatment since 2005, soil nitrogen availability was equivalent in both treatments. These results demonstrate the agronomic interest of nitrogen-fixing plants used as a cover crop in organic peach orchards...|$|E
40|$|Earthworms {{can have}} a {{profound}} effect on a myriad of soil physical, chemical and microbial parameters. To better understand their role in the soil, they are often studied under controlled conditions. However, a persistent problem in such controlled experiments is the ability of earthworms to escape from experimental units with open tops (e. g. for plant growth). Here, we tested whether adhesive hook tape applied to the inside of mesocosms is effective in confining them to their experimental units. A mesocosm study was set up with hook tape treatments (control, one layer, two layers), mesocosm material (polyvinylchloride – PVC, polypropylene – PP) and earthworm species (Lumbricus rubellus (Hoffmeister), Aporrectodea caliginosa (Savigny), Lumbricus terrestris (L.) + Aporrectodea longa (Ude)) as different factors to study the escape of earthworms during 24 h. In the treatments without hook tape, individuals of L. rubellus and A. caliginosa escaped, with highest escape rates (80 %) for L. rubellus from the PP mesocosms, and lowest escape rates (20 %) for A. caliginosa from the PVC mesocosms. When hook tape was applied, in either one or two layers, no individuals of those species escaped. The two <b>anecic</b> <b>earthworm</b> species, L. terrestris and A. longa did not escape from any mesocosms, irrespective of the presence of hook tape. As not a single earthworm escaped from the hook tape treatments, we conclude that applying hook tape is a simple, inexpensive and effective method to keep earthworms confined to experimental units...|$|E
40|$|Depth and {{architecture}} of root systems play {{a prominent role}} in crop productivity under conditions of low water and nutrient availability. The subsoil contains high amounts of nutrients that may potentially serve for nutrient uptake by crops including finite resources such as phosphorus that have to be used in moderation to delay their exhaustion. Biopores are tubular shaped continuous soil pores formed by plant roots and earthworms. Taproot systems especially those of perennial legumes can make soil nutrients plant available from the solid phase and increase the density of vertical biopores in the subsoil thus making subsoil layers more accessible for succeeding crops. Density of larger sized biopores is further enhanced by increased abundance and activity of <b>anecic</b> <b>earthworms</b> resulting from soil rest and amount of provided feed. Nutrient rich drilospheres can provide a favorable environment for roots and nutrient uptake of subsequent crops. Future efficient nutrient management and crop rotation design in organic agriculture should entail these strategies of soil fertility building and biopore services in subsoil layers site specifically. Elements of these concepts are suggested to be used also in mainstream agriculture headlands, e. g. as ‘Ecological Focus Areas’, in order to improve soil structure as well as to establish a web of biodiversity while avoiding constraints for agricultural production...|$|R
40|$|The {{ecological}} value of grassland habitats and earthworms is widely recognized. This study aimed to compare five different grassland management practices {{and their impact}} on earthworm communities. In permanent grassland in the French Massif Central field sampling was carried out in April 2011. Abundance, biomass and species richness of earthworms were measured and the effect of mowing and rotational grazing by sheep or cattle at a low and high stocking density was investigated. Species richness was not affected by the grassland management as ten to twelve different taxonomic categories occurred under each management practice. <b>Anecic</b> <b>earthworms,</b> particularly Aporrectodea giardi, were positively affected by grazing, even at the highstocking density of cattle. This observation is supposedly to be explained by the increased food quality due to the return of dung as a valuable food source. In the studied context, earthworms did not differ between sheep and cattlegrazing. Epigeic and endogeic earthworms did not show a consistent tendency in their reaction to the altered management. Earthworms seemed to be influenced by a complex system of interacting factors, especially regarding belowground effects of mowing and grazing. The present study underlined the requirement for further investigation of the interactions within the soil food web and between soil organisms and plants...|$|R
40|$|A {{gradient}} {{of agricultural}} intensification (from permanent meadows to permanent crops, with rotation crops and meadows as intermediary steps) was {{studied in the}} course of the RMQS-Biodiv program, covering a regular grid of 109 sites spread over the whole area of French Brittany. Soil biota (earthworms, other macrofauna, microarthropods, nematodes, microorganisms) were sampled according to a standardized procedure, together with visual assessment of a Humus Index. We hypothesized that soil animal and microbial communities were increasingly disturbed along this gradient, resulting in decreasing species richness and decreasing abundance of most sensitive species groups. We also hypothesized that the application of organic matter could compensate for the negative effects of agricultural intensity by increasing the abundance of fauna relying directly on soil organic matter for their food requirements, i. e. saprophagous invertebrates. We show that studied animal and microbial groups, with the exception of epigeic springtails, are negatively affected by the intensity of agriculture, meadows and crops in rotation exhibiting features similar to their permanent counterparts. The latter result was interpreted as a rapid adaptation of soil biotic communities to periodic changes in land use provided the agricultural landscape remains stable. The application of pig and chicken slurry, of current practice in the study region, alone or in complement to mineral fertilization, proves to be favorable to saprophagous macrofauna and bacterivorous nematodes. A composite biotic index is proposed to synthesize our results, based on a selection of animals groups which responded the most to agricultural intensification or organic matter application: <b>anecic</b> <b>earthworms,</b> endogeic earthworms, macrofauna other than earthworms (macroarthropods and mollusks), saprophagous macrofauna other than earthworms (macroarthropods and mollusks), epigeic springtails, phytoparasitic nematodes, bacterivorous nematodes and microbial biomass. This composite index allowed scoring land uses and agricultural practices on the base of simple morphological traits of soil animals without identification at species level...|$|R
