5|$|Article IX {{involves}} {{amendments to}} the New Jersey state constitution. A potential <b>amendment</b> is submitted through the Senate or General Assembly.

If a majority votes for the <b>amendment,</b> the <b>amendment</b> is passed on the thirtieth day after the vote.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court has {{eventually}} adopted {{some elements}} of Harlan's approach, holding that only some Bill of Rights guarantees were applicable against the states—the doctrine known as selective incorporation. However, under Chief Justice Earl Warren during the 1960s, {{an increasing number of}} rights were deemed sufficiently fundamental for incorporation (Harlan regularly dissented from these rulings). Hence, the majority of provisions from the Bill of Rights have been extended to the states; the exceptions are the Third <b>Amendment,</b> the grand jury clause of the Fifth <b>Amendment,</b> the Seventh <b>Amendment,</b> the excessive bail provision of the Eighth <b>Amendment,</b> the Ninth <b>Amendment,</b> and the Tenth <b>Amendment.</b> Thus, although the Supreme Court has agreed with Harlan's general reasoning, the end result of its jurisprudence is very different from what Harlan advocated.|$|E
