25|$|Citrus, dates, and grapes are {{the main}} fruits by {{cultivated}} area. Agricultural output in tons in 1999 included corn, 9,350,000; wheat, 6,347,000; rice, 5,816,000; potatoes, 1,900,000; and oranges, 1,525,000. The government exercises a strong degree of control over agriculture, not only to ensure {{the best use of}} irrigation water but also to confine the planting of cotton in favor of food grains. However, the government's <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> this objective is limited by crop rotational constraints.|$|E

25|$|Although the Conservative {{government}} under John Major attempted to severely reduce {{the influence of}} students' unions in Britain, the NUS and individual students' unions managed to successfully lobby against the moves to restrict their political activities. The then Education Secretary, John Patten aimed to end the 'closed shop' and ensure students would have to join their union (opt-in) rather than automatically becoming a member. As many unions receive funding based upon membership levels this threatened their <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> their core business.|$|E
25|$|Bandura's Social Cognitive Theory {{is another}} {{cognitive}} process theory that offers the important concept of self-efficacy for explaining employee's level of motivation relative to workplace tasks or goals. Self-efficacy is an individual's belief {{in his or}} her <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> results in a given scenario. Empirically, studies have shown a strong correlation between self-efficacy and performance. The concept has been extended to group efficacy, which is a group's belief that it can achieve success with a given task or project.|$|E
25|$|The {{glass ceiling}} is one {{prevalent}} {{concern about the}} quality of economic opportunity available to women involved in the formal labor market. This phenomenon is the de facto limitation of females' <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> the top levels of leadership in an organization. While the concept is not restricted to the market, it is prevalent in profit-based institutions. With respect to female workers in majority Muslim countries, women are not evenly represented {{on the board of directors}} or among the senior management positions of most of the 100 most lucrative companies in the Arab World.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — A unified {{tree-search}} detection scheme {{based on}} Dijkstra’s algorithm is developed for MIMO systems. The pro-posed framework generalizes the original Dijkstra’s algorithm by allowing the memory usage, detection complexity, and sorting dynamic associated with the algorithm to be customized. By tuning different parameters, desired performance-complexity tradeoffs are attained and a fixed-complexity version can be produced to facilitate hardware implementation. Simulation re-sults demonstrate that the proposed algorithm shows <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> highly favorable performance-complexity tradeoffs. I...|$|R

Zhang Liao is considered the best {{of the five}}, his fame stoked by his victory at the Battle of Xiaoyao Ford of 214-215.|$|R
25|$|The scuba diver {{generally}} has an operational {{need to control}} depth without resorting to a line to the surface or holding onto a structure or landform, or resting on the bottom. This requires the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> neutral buoyancy {{at any time during}} a dive, otherwise the effort expended to maintain depth by swimming against the buoyancy difference will both task load the diver and require an otherwise unnecessary expenditure of energy, increasing air consumption, and increasing the risk of loss of control and escalation to an accident.|$|E
25|$|Photon mapping {{is another}} method that uses both light-based and eye-based ray tracing; in an initial pass, {{energetic}} photons are traced along rays {{from the light}} source so as to compute an estimate of radiant flux {{as a function of}} 3-dimensional space (the eponymous photon map itself). In a subsequent pass, rays are traced from the eye into the scene to determine the visible surfaces, and the photon map is used to estimate the illumination at the visible surface points. The advantage of photon mapping versus bidirectional path tracing is the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> significant reuse of photons, reducing computation, at the cost of statistical bias.|$|E
25|$|Newly elected KMT {{chairman}} Ma Ying-jeou saw {{his political}} fortunes bolstered by his party's election success. He had already successfully {{distanced himself from}} his predecessor, Lien Chan. Ma had declined to accompany Lien on his visit to mainland China {{earlier in the year}} and, as chairman, has appointed fresh faces to a number of party posts. He has now linked his name with the cause of clean government, a prominent KMT 2005 campaign pledge. The election is thus widely read as an expression of voter confidence in Ma's <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> reform within his own party as well as in government. Ma has emerged as an early favorite in the 2008 presidential race.|$|E

25|$|Follower-focused {{approaches}} look at {{the processes}} by which leaders motivate followers, and lead teams to achieve shared goals. Understandably, the area of leadership motivation draws heavily from the abundant research literature {{in the domain of}} motivation in I/O psychology. Because leaders are held responsible for their followers' <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> the organization's goals, their ability to motivate their followers is a critical factor of leadership effectiveness. Similarly, the area of team leadership draws heavily from the research in teams and team effectiveness in I/O psychology. Because organizational employees are frequently structured in the form of teams, leaders {{need to be aware of}} the potential benefits and pitfalls of working in teams, how teams develop, how to satisfy team members' needs, and ultimately how to bring about team effectiveness and performance.|$|E
25|$|Its <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> {{financial}} sustainability allowed FINCA to make considerable expansions in the 1980s and 1990s in Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, and the Newly Independent States of the Former Soviet Union. In 1995, FINCA entered the former Soviet Union {{by establishing a}} Village Banking program in Kyrgyzstan. In 1997, FINCA co-sponsored the first Microcredit Summit, with over 2,000 policymakers, practitioners, and donors discussing ways to expand microcredit programs. In 2000, FINCA {{became one of the}} first economic development organizations to enter Kosovo after the June 1999 cease-fire. In the 2000s, FINCA continued its penetration into the Newly Independent States by establishing new programs in Central Asia. Its most recent programs were launched in Afghanistan, in 2004 (see FINCA Afghanistan), and Jordan in 2007. In April 2009, FINCA Kyrgyzstan became the second program to pass the 100,000 client mark.|$|E
25|$|The {{events of}} Tet in early 1968 {{as a whole}} were also {{remarkable}} in shifting public opinion regarding the war. U.S. military officials had previously reported that counter-insurgency in South Vietnam was being prosecuted successfully. While the Tet Offensive provided the U.S. and allied militaries with a great victory in that the Vietcong was finally brought into open battle and destroyed as a fighting force, the American media, including respected figures such as Walter Cronkite, interpreted such events as {{the attack on the}} American embassy in Saigon as an indicator of U.S. military weakness. The military victories on the battlefields of Tet were obscured by shocking images of violence on television screens, long casualty lists, and a new perception among the American people that the military had been untruthful to them about the success of earlier military operations, and ultimately, the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> a meaningful military solution in Vietnam.|$|E

25|$|Women “all {{over the}} world are {{evaluated}} and oppressed by their appearances”; be it age, skin tone, or size. Men are falling victims to this issue as well. A large facet of “social currency for girls and women continues to be rooted in physical appearance”. With accessories and apparel designed to enhance a look; social media, magazines, and marketing campaigns and advertisements, also add to the burden of perfection. This is still prevalent today, whereby female bodies are staged as the ultimate commodity, and used for the selling of products. The ultimate purpose of advertisements is thus to appeal to the insecurities of individuals, in hopes of selling them the solution. Marketers fuelling negative body imagery are also highly aware that those who undergo these problems, are more likely to purchase. For that reason, advertisements regularly advocate the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> a particular look through retouched images, the sexual objectification of women, and products accompanied with explicit messages.|$|E
25|$|Coping {{occurs in}} {{response}} to psychological stress—usually triggered by changes—in an effort to maintain mental health and emotional well-being. Life stressors are often described as negative events (loss of a job). However, positive changes in life (a new job) can also constitute life stressors, thus requiring the use of coping skills to adapt. Coping strategies are the behaviors, thoughts, and emotions that you use {{to adjust to the}} changes that occur in your life. The use of coping skills will help a person better themselves in the work place and perform {{to the best of their}} <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> success. There are many ways to cope and adapt to changes. Some ways include: sharing emotions with peers, having a healthy social life outside of work, being humorous, and adjusting expectations of self and work. These coping skills will help turn negative emotion to positive and allow for more focus on the public in contrast to oneself.|$|E
25|$|Anatomical {{considerations}} {{may also}} dictate preference for surgical or non-surgical approaches. For instance trismus, a bulky tongue, limited {{extension of the}} neck, prominent teeth, torus mandibularis (a bony growth on the mandible) or limited width of the mandible would all be relative contraindications to surgery. Tumour related considerations include invasion of the mandible, base of skull and extensive involvement of the larynx or {{more than half of}} the base of tongue. Technical considerations in offering surgery as a primary modality include the presumed <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> adequate margins in the resected specimen and the degree of resulting defect, since close or positive margins are likely to result in subsequent adjuvant therapy to achieve disease control, with resultant increased morbidity. Costs are difficult to estimate but one US study, based on estimates of 25% of all OPC patients receiving surgery alone and 75% surgery followed by adjuvant therapy, using the criteria of the NCCN, found that this approach was less expensive than primary chemoradiation.|$|E
