500|$|On March 8, 2012, Winters {{signed a}} {{contract}} with Seattle Sounders Women, under head coach Michelle French, to play with national team members Alex Morgan, Hope Solo, Sydney Leroux, and Stephanie Cox. Of her signing, she said, [...] "Once WPS was suspended, I was obviously really disappointed. I thought about going overseas, but transfer windows were closed and things became really complicated and frustrating...Alex Morgan <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> interested in playing with her on the Sounders. [...] knew I have been living in Seattle. Right after that, I went back and sent [...] an email to find out more information about the Sounders Women. So that's how it all started for me." [...] Winters played in eight matches for the Sounders Women, scored one goal and recorded one assist. The team finished second in the Western Conference with a [...] record. With the national teammates' presence on the team, the Sounders sold out nine of their ten home matches at the 4,500 capacity Starfire Stadium. Average attendance during the 2012 season for the Sounders Women was four times higher than the next closest team.|$|E

[...] Parks responded, [...] "I don't think I should have to stand up." [...] Blake called the police to arrest Parks. When recalling the {{incident}} for Eyes on the Prize, a 1987 public television series on the Civil Rights Movement, Parks said, [...] "When he saw me still sitting, he <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to stand up, and I said, 'No, I'm not.'

6000|$|Her divinely {{beautiful}} eyes {{rested on}} {{me with a}} look of encouragement. I dropped on my knees at her feet. She had <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> afraid of her.

60|$|The route he {{took was}} by the boulevards: he several times made me {{sit down on the}} seats {{stationed}} under the lime-trees; he did not <b>ask</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> tired, but looked, and drew his own conclusions.|$|R

60|$|He {{walked with}} me. My {{way back to}} the Vicarage was his {{way back to the}} inn. He had come to our parts, he told me, for the quiet and {{retirement}} as much as for the fishing.

60|$|When I {{reached it}} and lit the lantern which we always carried, I was {{astonished}} to find that, in a rough fashion, it had been made ready to sleep in. The seats had been cleared out, the hind curtain fastened, and so forth. Also the pole was propped up with an ox-yoke {{so as to make}} the vehicle level to lie in. While I was wondering vaguely who could have done this, Hans climbed on to the step, carrying two karosses which he had borrowed or stolen, and <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> comfortable.|$|E
60|$|She {{touched me}} to the quick when she <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> sure that I was nursed by my own mother; on the {{contrary}} I was sure I was not; and I trembled, and looked pale at the very expression. 'Sure,' said I to myself, 'this creature cannot be a witch, or have any conversation with a spirit, that can inform her what was done with me before I was able to know it myself'; and I looked {{at her as if}} I had been frightened; but reflecting that it could not be possible for her to know anything about me, that disorder went off, and I began to be easy, but it was not presently.|$|E

60|$|Few moments did it {{need me to}} make ready, yet fewer, it seems, {{would the}} Borgia impatience have had me employ; for scarce <b>was</b> <b>I</b> booted when someone knocked at my door.

I had not the least idea who she was, but I sent in my card at a venture; and in five minutes afterward I found myself in the presence {{of one of the most}} charming women these eyes ever looked on.|$|E
60|$|He, after {{learning}} that I had lived at Springfield, <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> acquainted with you. I told him I was. He said you had lately been elected constable in Adams, but that you never would be again. I asked him why. He said the people there had found out that you had been sheriff or deputy sheriff in Sangamon County, and that you came off and left your securities to suffer. He then asked me if I did not know such to be the fact. I told him I did not think you had ever been sheriff or deputy sheriff in Sangamon, but that I thought you had been constable. I further told him {{that if you had}} left your securities to suffer in that or any other case, I had never heard of it, and that if it had been so, I thought I would have heard of it.|$|E
60|$|When I {{had read}} thus far, Harris {{broke into the}} room in a noble {{excitement}} and said the ropes and the guides were secured, and <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> ready. I said I believed I wouldn't ascend the Altels this time. I said Alp-climbing was a different thing from what I had supposed it was, and so I judged we had better study its points a little more before we went definitely into it. But I told him to retain the guides and order them to follow us to Zermatt, because I meant to use them there. I said I could feel the spirit of adventure beginning to stir in me, and was sure that the fell fascination of Alp-climbing would soon be upon me. I said he could {{make up his mind}} to it that we would do a deed before we were a week older which would make the hair of the timid curl with fright.|$|E
6000|$|... "How can I tell? Cut it and see.

6000|$|... "If it had {{not been}} for my smelling-bottle, I believe I should have lost my senses. As it was, I drew back again into the shadow. Even Armadale noticed the sudden change in me: he, as well as Midwinter, <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> ill. I said I felt the heat, but hoped I should be better presently; and then leaned back in the box, and tried to rally my courage. I succeeded in {{recovering}} self-possession {{enough to be able to}} look again at the stage (without showing myself) the next time the chorus appeared. There was the man again! But to my infinite relief he never looked toward our box a second time. This welcome indifference, on his part, helped to satisfy me that I had seen an extraordinary accidental resemblance, and nothing more. I still hold to this conclusion, after having had leisure to think; but my mind would be more completely at ease than it is if I had seen the rest of the man's face without the stage disguises that hid it from all investigation.|$|E
6000|$|... "You shall hear," [...] said Oscar. [...] "He first {{appealed to}} the case as {{supporting}} his assertion that Lucilla's idea of me must be utterly unlike what I am myself. He <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> now satisfied {{that she could have}} no correct conception of what faces and colors were really like? and if I agreed with him in believing that the image in her mind of the man with the blue face, was in all probability something fantastically and hideously unlike the reality? After what I had heard, I agreed with him as a matter of course. 'Very well,' says Mr. Sebright. 'Now let its remember that there is one important difference between the case of Miss Finch, and the case that I have just mentioned. The husband's blind idea of his wife was the husband's favorite idea. The shock of the first sight of her, was plainly a shock to him on that account. Now Miss Finch's blind idea of the blue face is, on the contrary, a hateful idea to her--the image is an image that she loathes. Is it not fair to conclude from this, that the first sight of you as you really are, is likely to be, in her case, a relief to her instead of a shock? Reasoning from my experience, I reach that conclusion; and I advise you, in your own interests, to be present when the bandage is taken off. Even if I prove to be mistaken--even if she is not immediately reconciled to the sight of you--there is the other example of the child and the Indian nurse to satisfy you that it is only a question of time. Sooner or later, she will take the discovery as any other young lady would take it. At first, she will be indignant with you for deceiving her; and then, if you are sure of your place in her affections, she will end in forgiving you.--There is my view of your position, and there are the grounds on which I form it! In the meantime, my own opinion remains unshaken. I firmly believe that you will never have occasion to act on the advice that I have given to you. When the bandage is taken off, the chances are five hundred to one that she is no nearer to seeing you then than she is now.' These were his last words--and on that we parted." ...|$|E
6000|$|We now {{no longer}} sailed or floated on the river, but trod the unyielding land like pilgrims. Sadi tells who may travel; among others, [...] "A common mechanic, who can earn a {{subsistence}} {{by the industry}} of his hand, and shall not have to stake his reputation for every morsel of bread, as philosophers have said." [...] He may travel who can subsist on the wild fruits and game of the most cultivated country. A man may travel fast enough and earn his living on the road. I have at times been applied to to do work when on a journey; to do tinkering and repair clocks, when I had a knapsack on my back. A man once applied to me {{to go into a}} factory, stating conditions and wages, observing that I succeeded in shutting the window of a railroad car in which we were travelling, when the other passengers had failed. [...] "Hast thou not heard of a Sufi, who was hammering some nails into the sole of his sandal; an officer of cavalry took him by the sleeve, saying, Come along and shoe my horse." [...] Farmers have asked me to assist them in haying, when I was passing their fields. A man once applied to me to mend his umbrella, taking me for an umbrella-mender, because, being on a journey, I carried an umbrella in my hand while the sun shone. Another wished to buy a tin cup of me, observing that I had one strapped to my belt, and a sauce-pan on my back. The cheapest way to travel, and the way to travel the farthest in the shortest distance, is to go afoot, carrying a dipper, a spoon, and a fish-line, some Indian meal, some salt, and some sugar. When you come to a brook or pond, you can catch fish and cook them; or you can boil a hasty-pudding; or you can buy a loaf of bread at a farmer's house for fourpence, moisten it in the next brook that crosses the road, and dip into it your sugar,--this alone will last you a whole day;--or, if you are accustomed to heartier living, you can buy a quart of milk for two cents, crumb your bread or cold pudding into it, and eat it with your own spoon out of your own dish. Any one of these things I mean, not all together. I have travelled thus some hundreds of miles without taking any meal in a house, sleeping on the ground when convenient, and found it cheaper, and in many respects more profitable, than staying at home. So that some have inquired why it would not be best to travel always. But I never thought of travelling simply as a means of getting a livelihood. A simple woman down in Tyngsborough, at whose house I once stopped to get a draught of water, when I said, recognizing the bucket, that I had stopped there nine years before for the same purpose, <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not a traveller, supposing that I had been travelling ever since, and had now come round again; that travelling was one of the professions, more or less productive, which her husband did not follow. But continued travelling is far from productive. It begins with wearing away the soles of the shoes, and making the feet sore, and erelong it will wear a man clean up, after making his heart sore into the bargain. I have observed that the after-life of those who have travelled much is very pathetic. True and sincere travelling is no pastime, but it is as serious as the grave, or any part of the human journey, and it requires a long probation to be broken into it. I do not speak of those that travel sitting, the sedentary travellers whose legs hang dangling the while, mere idle symbols of the fact, any more than when we speak of sitting hens we mean those that sit standing, but I mean those to whom travelling is life for the legs, and death too, at last. The traveller must be born again on the road, and earn a passport from the elements, the principal powers that be for him. He shall experience at last that old threat of his mother fulfilled, that he shall be skinned alive. His sores shall gradually deepen themselves that they may heal inwardly, while he gives no rest to the sole of his foot, and at night weariness must be his pillow, that so he may acquire experience against his rainy days.--So was it with us.|$|E
