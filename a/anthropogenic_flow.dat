In order {{to balance the}} competing water demands between human and environment and provide knowledge on sustainable water management, assessments on <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>flow</b> alterations and their impacts on aquatic and riparian ecosystems in China are needed. In this study, the first evaluation on quantitative relationships between <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>flow</b> alterations and ecological responses in eleven river basins and watersheds in China was performed based on the data that could be obtained from published case studies. Quantitative relationships between changes in average annual discharge, seasonal low flow and seasonal high flow and changes in ecological indicators (fish diversity, fish catch and vegetation cover, etc.) were analyzed. The results showed that changes in riparian vegetation cover as well as changes in fish diversity and fish catch were strongly correlated with the changes in flow magnitude (r = 0. 77, 0. 66), especially with changes in average annual river discharge. In addition, {{more than half of}} the variations in vegetation cover could be explained by changes in average annual river discharge (r² = 0. 63) and roughly 50...|$|E

40|$|Riparian {{ecosystems}} are biophysically complex and highly diverse taxonomically, structurally and functionally. While many environmental factors determine {{the structure and}} function of riparian vegetation communities, hydrology {{is thought to be}} the 'master variable'. Flooding and variability in water availability are known to be key drivers of taxonomic diversity, but their influence on the functional trait diversity of riparian vegetation communities remains largely unexplored. We collected data on species abundance, quantitative plant functional traits and hydrology from 15 sites distributed across south-eastern Australia to address the following questions: (a) Is functional trait diversity related to the frequency and magnitude of flooding disturbance? (b) Is functional trait diversity related to variability in seasonal water availability within the riparian zone? We confirm that metrics describing both flooding disturbance and patterns of water availability exhibit strong relationships with functional trait diversity in riparian vegetation communities of south-eastern Australia. Our key finding is that functional trait diversity in these systems tends to be positively associated with variability in hydrological conditions and the intensity of rare, high-magnitude flooding events, rather than average patterns of flow. Our study highlights the importance of extreme flooding events and temporal patterns of water availability as determinants of diversity in riparian vegetation communities. These relationships may have significant consequences for plant communities experiencing alterations to hydrology caused by <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>flow</b> modification and the changing climate. 18 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Impacts of <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>flow</b> {{regulation}} on {{the thermal}} regimes of alpine river systems are poorly understood. This is surprising {{given the importance}} of water temperature for river ecosystems and the widespread regulation of mountain rivers across the world. This study examined water temperature dynamics year-round between July 2008 and September 2009 in the Eisboden river system, central Austrian Alps. Water temperature data were examined alongside hydroclimatological data to infer the key processes driving thermal variability from diurnal to inter-annual scales. As expected, interactions between meteorology and water source controlled year-round thermal heterogeneity. However, water entering the proglacial river from a hydropower storage reservoir caused significant increases in water temperature during both late summer and early winter, resulting in a marked longitudinal thermal discontinuity. The timing and duration of flows discharged from reservoirs, and thus effects on river thermal regimes, differed considerably from previous studies of subalpine hydropeaking. Furthermore, thermal responses to flow regulation extended laterally to some groundwater tributaries even where there was no upstream surface connectivity, suggesting significant hyporheic flow or conduction of heat through coarse alluvium. River water temperature continued to be altered even after reservoir releases had ceased due to the removal of winter snow cover and recharged groundwater sources. Together, these insights into the thermal variability have broad implications for conservation and management of alpine river systems because water temperature is a key variable influencing aquatic ecosystems, and because anthropogenic pressures on alpine environments are expected to grow in the future...|$|E
40|$|The {{contributions}} of glacier-melt, snowmelt, and groundwater to stream flow in alpine catchments result in characteristic discharge regimes and unique stream habitats. The year round dynamics of alpine floodplain ecosystems are however, poorly understood, {{in particular the}} effects of flow regulation on alpine stream ecosystems have not been assessed. Fieldwork was undertaken over two summer melt-seasons (2008 / 2009) and the intervening winter season within the Eisboden catchment, Austrian Alps. The application of a novel diurnal statistical hydrograph classification technique to analyse flow dynamics at six stream sites elucidated the varying influences of precipitation, ablation, and groundwater contributions on spatiotemporal flow dynamics. Although a clear ablation driven seasonal progression in river flow was evident, rainfall also exerted a dominant influence altering the melt-signal during both summer seasons. Water temperature time series, monitored at 23 sites across the catchment revealed year-round spatiotemporal variability in flow permanency, and high thermal heterogeneity, amongst streams. Benthic macroinvertebrate communities {{were found to be}} associated predominately with variations in stream temperature and channel stability during the summer melt-season. However, the communities of mixed water source floodplain sites were found to be highly dynamic and considerably more diverse than expected with respect to existing conceptual models of alpine streams. Macroinvertebrate community structure differed markedly during the winter; the assemblage diversified at glacial-fed and mixed sites both in terms of taxonomic and functional diversity. <b>Anthropogenic</b> <b>flow</b> regulation from the Weiβsee hydropower storage reservoir had a large impact on the discharge and thermal regimes of streams but the macroinvertebrate community was relatively resistant in flow regulation disturbances. This finding suggests alpine stream macroinvertebrates inhabiting proglacial river systems are well adapted to the harsh and dynamic physicochemical conditions. Current hydrological and ecological conceptual models of alpine stream systems are evaluated with respect to new insights from the Eisboden and future research directions suggested.

40|$|With the {{majority}} of Earth’s population living in coastal areas, estuarine ecosystems have been particularly affected by anthropogenic disturbances. My dissertation research focused on three interrelated types of human disturbance that affect estuaries: Anthropogenic alteration of freshwater inflow, the introduction of invasive species, and habitat alteration. Using the LoxahatcheeRiver(Jupiter, FL) as a model system, {{my goal was to}} understand how these disturbances affect estuarine organisms, particularly fishes. One of the most ecologically harmful disturbances affecting estuaries is anthropogenic alteration of freshwater inflow (and resulting changes in salinity patterns). To identify effects of freshwater inflow on the behavior of an ecologically and economically important fish (common snook Centropomus undecimalis), I conducted a 19 -month acoustic telemetry study. Common snook were more abundant and made more frequent upstream migrations during the wet season, but freshwater inflow {{did not appear to be}} the proximate cause for these behaviors. Increased estuarine salinity resulting from <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>flow</b> alteration may have facilitated the second type of disturbance that I address in this dissertation; the invasion of non-native Indo-Pacific lionfish into estuarine habitats. During the course of my dissertation research, I documented the first ever estuarine invasion by non-native lionfish. Using mark-recapture, I identified high site fidelity in lionfish, a trait that may aid future control efforts. The extremely low minimum salinity tolerance that I identified in lionfish appears to have allowed the species to colonize far upriver in estuaries with anthropogenically modified salinity patterns. Anthropogenic salinity alteration has also led to a severe degradation of oyster reef habitats in theLoxahatcheeRiver. As a foundation species, oysters provide food, shelter, and nursery habitat for a wide variety of estuarine organisms, including many ecologically and economically important fishes. Increasingly, degraded oyster reef habitats have been the focus of restoration efforts. I identified a relatively rapid (3 ̆c 2 years) convergence between restored and natural oyster reef communities, and documented the importance of vertical relief in restoration success.

40|$|River reaches {{worldwide}} historically experience morphological regulations, as channelization, {{as well as}} {{flow regime}} alterations, which often lead to degradation of freshwater ecosystems. In last seven decades {{a large number of}} dams have been designed and built worldwide contributing to such river hydromorphological alterations. In alpine and piedmont regions river reaches often experience <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>flow</b> regime alteration due to hydropower production. The fluctuating flow regime typical of river reaches downstream hydropower plant releases (hydropeaking) is known to produce several adverse ecological effects, strongly linked to morphological characteristics of the downstream channel. Hydropeaking can also alter the thermal regime of the receiving water body (thermopeaking) if released hypolimnetic water has different temperature from surface water; also thermopeaking can have adverse consequences on river environment. In a changing world with respect to renewable energy production but also to global warming, the understanding of hydropeaking and thermopeaking ecological impacts represent a lively research challenge. The first part of the present thesis is dedicated to the characterization and quantification of hydropeaking and thermopeaking alterations. Adopting a statistical approach on an extended dataset of Alpine and Norwegian rivers, a suite of indicators have been designed and exploited to identify the degree of alteration of both hydrological and thermal regime. The study provides two screening tools that can be exploited by environmental managers in the identification of critically altered river reaches. The second part is dedicated {{to the development of a}} two-dimensional numerical shallow-water model able to simulate surface water passive tracer transport over complex morphologies, exploitable in the numerical investigation of river thermal transport dynamics.

40|$|River flow regimes, {{including}} long-term average flows, seasonality, low flows, high {{flows and}} other types of flow variability, play an important role for freshwater ecosystems. Thus, climate change affects freshwater ecosystems not only by increased temperatures but also by altered river flow regimes. However, with one exception, transferable quantitative relations between flow alterations and ecological responses have not yet been derived. While discharge decreases are generally considered to be detrimental for ecosystems, the effect of future discharge increases is unclear. As a first step towards a global-scale analysis of climate change impacts on freshwater ecosystems, we quantified the impact of climate change on five ecologically relevant river flow indicators, using the global water model WaterGAP 2. 1 g to simulate monthly time series of river discharge with a spatial resolution of 0. 5 degrees. Four climate change scenarios based on two global climate models and two greenhouse gas emissions scenarios were evaluated. We compared the impact of climate change by the 2050 s to the impact of water withdrawals and dams on natural flow regimes that had occurred by 2002. Climate change was computed to alter seasonal flow regimes significantly (i. e. by more than 10 %) on 90 % of the global land area (excluding Greenland and Antarctica), as compared to only one quarter of the land area that had suffered from significant seasonal flow regime alterations due to dams and water withdrawals. Due to climate change, the timing of the maximum mean monthly river discharge will be shifted by at least one month on one third on the global land area, more often towards earlier months (mainly due to earlier snowmelt). Dams and withdrawals had caused comparable shifts on less than 5 % of the land area only. Long-term average annual river discharge is predicted to significantly increase on one half of the land area, and to significantly decrease on one quarter. Dams and withdrawals had led to significant decreases on one sixth of the land area, and nowhere to increases. Thus, by the 2050 s, climate change may have impacted ecologically relevant river flow characteristics more strongly than dams and water withdrawals have up to now. The only exception refers to the decrease of the statistical low flow Q 90 , with significant decreases both by past water withdrawals and future climate change on one quarter of the land area. However, dam impacts are likely underestimated by our study. Considering long-term average river discharge, only a few regions, including Spain, Italy, Iraq, Southern India, Western China, the Australian Murray Darling Basin and the High Plains Aquifer in the USA, all of them with extensive irrigation, are expected to be less affected by climate change than by past <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>flow</b> alterations. In some of these regions, climate change will exacerbate the discharge reductions, while in others climate change provides opportunities for reducing past reductions. Emissions scenario B 2 leads to only slightly reduced alterations of river flow regimes as compared to scenario A 2 even though emissions are much smaller. The differences in alterations resulting from the two applied climate models are larger than those resulting from the two emissions scenarios. Based on general knowledge about ecosystem responses to flow alterations and data related to flow alterations by dams and water withdrawals, we expect that the computed climate change induced river flow alterations will impact freshwater ecosystems more strongly than past anthropogenic alterations...|$|E

40|$|Many {{temperate}} estuaries have intermittently {{open and}} closed mouths, {{a feature that}} is often related to intermittent freshwater input. These systems, often overlooked due to their small size, can have large hydrological variability over medium-term time scales. This variability presents potential difficulties for estuarine species particularly where anthropogenic alterations to freshwater flows can cause large deviations from natural patterns of tidal influence and inundation of habitat. Influences of natural and hydrological variability on seagrasses were examined in two central Victorian estuaries with anthropogenically-modified but naturally-intermittent freshwater flows and mouth openings. Comparisons were focused on differences between an estuary with artificially-augmented freshwater inflow and an adjacent system, in which the volume and timing of inflows were altered by a reservoir. Eight additional estuaries in the region were also used to provide a context for these two main sites. Hydrological changes during the three-year field component were affected by the ending of a drought and then a major flood a year later {{as well as by}} ongoing <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>flow</b> reduction and augmentation. These influences on hydrology were associated with an initially high seagrass coverage that was substantially reduced and showed signs of recovery only in the system that was affected by lower inflows. Such influences and responses also changed seasonally but to a much lesser extent than the responses to stochastic climatic events. Natural flows were intermittent and varied substantially between years. Flooding flows represented up to 89 % of the long-term annual average flow. Water quality was broadly typical of the region, with the exception of low pH in some tributaries, especially those of Anglesea estuary. Anthropogenic changes to flow were most evident at times of low natural flows and resulted in longer and more frequent periods of zero inflow to Painkalac estuary and a continual base flow to Anglesea. This base flow, from ponds containing coal ash, neutralised waters flowing from upstream and increased conductivity, except at times of high natural flow. A three-state conceptual model of the magnitude and variability of water levels, based largely on the degree of tidal influence was identified and quantitatively assessed for the two estuaries that were the main focus of the study. These states in turn had a large influence on the area and inundation of benthic habitat. Floods tended to open the mouths of estuaries, which then remained tidal given sufficient flow to overcome sedimentary processes at the mouths. Low and zero inflow was a precondition for closure of the mouths of the estuaries. When closed, differences in inflow resulted in different endpoints in salinity patterns. From an initial pattern similar to a classic ‘salt wedge’, Painkalac estuary, with reduced inflow, quickly destratified and gradually became more saline, at times hypersaline. Anglesea estuary, with augmented flow, tended to remain stratified for longer until becoming completely fresh, given a long enough period of closure. Episodic changes in the water quality of the estuaries were associated with different components of the freshwater flow regimes. At high flows, fresh waters of low pH with a high metal load entered Anglesea estuary. Except during the largest flood, when the estuary was completely flushed, this water was neutralised at the halocline and resulting in precipitation of metals. High flows into Painkalac were associated with elevated concentrations of clay-sourced suspended solids. During a closed period, with zero flow, a release of sediment-bound nutrients triggered by anoxia was observed in Painkalac, followed by an algal bloom. The large decline in seagrass extent that was observed in both estuaries was closely related to floods and the subsequent reductions in potential habitat associated with the tidal states that followed. Analysis of historical patterns of extent against rainfall records suggested that periods of drought and extended mouth closures were related to establishment and expansion of beds. This model was similar to that described for South African estuaries and contrasted with more-seasonal patterns reported for local marine embayments. Rates of in situ decomposition of seagrass detritus showed a mix of seasonal and disturbance-driven patterns of change, depending on estuary. Variability of these rates on a scale of 100 s of metres was typically not significant, but there were a few episodes that were highly significant. A negative correlation between decomposition rate and seagrass extent was also observed. A novel technique for assessing cellulose decomposition potential in sediment, adapted from soil science, proved to be a useful tool for estuarine research. Results from this component of the study highlighted both small-scale variability that was inconsistent through time, and also stable differences in decomposition potential between depths and estuaries that were consistent with differences in hydrological state and salinity. Given the relative lack of knowledge about processes in intermittent estuaries, particularly those relating to changes in freshwater inflow, results from this study will be of value both locally and for similar systems elsewhere. Locally, it is likely that flow regimes to both Anglesea and Painkalac estuaries will be reduced, following closure of the mine power station at Anglesea and due to increased demand from the reservoir above Painkalac. There is potential to manage flows from each of these sources to minimise downstream effects. Regionally, and globally, there are many intermittent estuaries in areas with Mediterranean-type climates. It has been predicted that the climates of these regions will become drier but with an increase in intensity of storm events, both of which have ramifications for flow regimes to estuaries. It is hoped that results of this study will contribute to more informed management of intermittent estuaries in the context of these likely changes. <br /...|$|E

Such information can support the identification of environmental flow guidelines and a sustainable water management that balances the water demands of humans and ecosystems. This study presents the first global assessment of the anthropogenic alteration of river flow regimes by water withdrawals and dams, focusing in particular on the change of flow variability. Six ecologically relevant flow indicators were quantified using an improved version of the global water model WaterGAP. WaterGAP simulated, with a spatial resolution of 0. 5 degree, river discharge as affected by human water withdrawals and dams, as well as naturalized discharge without this type of human interference. Mainly due to irrigation, long-term average river discharge and statistical low flow Q 90 (monthly river discharge that is exceeded in 9 out of 10 months) have decreased by more than 10 % on one sixth and one quarter of the global land area (excluding Antarctica and Greenland), respectively. Q 90 has increased significantly on only 5 % of the land area, downstream of reservoirs. Due to both water withdrawals and dams, seasonal flow amplitude has decreased significantly on one sixth of the land area, while interannual variability has increased on one quarter of the land area mainly due to irrigation. It has decreased on only 8 % of the land area, in areas with little consumptive water use that are downstream of dams.

This article emphasizes the importance of urban phosphorus flows, which are often marginalized due to the greater magnitude of agricultural phosphorus flows. A study on phosphorus flows in Gothenburg, Sweden, points out the potential role of solid waste in nutrient management, as the amounts of phosphorus in solid waste and in wastewater were found to be equal. Importation of food commodities accounts for 50 % of the total inflow of phosphorus, and food waste is a major contributor of phosphorus to solid waste. The results suggest that solid waste incineration residues represent a large underestimated sink of phosphorus. Focusing on wastewater as the sole source of recovered phosphorus is not sufficient. The Swedish national goal on phosphorus recycling, which is limited to sewage sludge, targets only a part of the total phosphorus flow that can potentially be recovered. In contrast to previous studies, agricultural flows in Gothenburg were marginal compared to flows related to the urban waste management infrastructure. We emphasize the need for debate on preferable routes for disposal of waste with a high phosphorus content. Both recovery potential and usefulness of the recovered product for agricultural purposes have to be considered. Impacts of five waste management strategies on phosphorus flows were evaluated: incineration of all the waste, comprehensive food waste separation, installation of kitchen grinders, urine diversion, and separation of blackwater and food waste...|$|R

For the performance of this study, a novel methodological approach was developed, and tested on a group of intermediate chemical products (chloronitrobenzenes), a group of final products (polyurethanes), and with case examples (azo dyes on chloronitrobenzene basis for textile dyeing; rigid expanded polyurethane sheets for thermal insulation in buildings). The essential elements of this method are: the bundling of several products or product life cycles by means of the new category of product trees, the historical analysis of the development and differentiation of product trees, the multidisciplinary examination of the framework conditions and influencing factors that are currently of relevance to chemical production and to the application of chemical products (including, inter alia, technical materials management, economic and social aspects, and the regulatory framework of environmental and public health policy), and the development of criteria for strategies aimed at a comprehensive ecological structuring of the production and application of chemical products. The approach links information on the requirements for action in environmental and public health policy with information on the actual room for manoeuvre of actors, and can thus be of use for both product-related assessment issues, entrepreneurial or supra-sectoral materials flow management, and in the further development of framework conditions of environmental policy.

40|$|Most rivers {{worldwide}} {{are highly}} regulated by <b>anthropogenic</b> activities through <b>flow</b> regulation and water pollution. Environmental flow regulation {{is used to}} reduce the effects of anthropogenic activities on aquatic ecosystems. Formulating flow alteration–ecological response relationships is {{a key factor in}} environmental flow assessment. Traditional environmental flow models are characterized by natural relationships between flow regimes and ecosystem factors. However, food webs are often altered from natural states, which disturb environmental flow assessment in such ecosystems. In ecosystems deteriorated by heavy anthropogenic activities, the effects of environmental flow regulation on species are difficult to assess with current modeling approaches. Environmental flow management compels the development of tools that link flow regimes and food webs in an ecosystem. Food web approaches are more suitable for the task because they are more adaptive for disordered multiple species in a food web deteriorated by anthropogenic activities. This paper presents a global method of environmental flow assessment in deteriorated aquatic ecosystems. Linkages between flow regimes and food web dynamics are modeled by incorporating multiple species into an ecosystem to explore ecosystem-based environmental flow management.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to assess major ion chemistry of groundwater {{in parts of the}} Central Ganga Plain and observe seasonal variations in its chemical quality. Systematic sampling was carried out during November 2005 and June 2006. The major ion chemistry of groundwater shows large variations, so much so that at times the meteoric signature seems to be completely obliterated. In many samples the concentrations of SO 4, NO 3 and F are above the permissible limit for human consumption. The graphical treatment of major ion chemistry helps in identifying four types of groundwater. All possible ionic species such as NaCl, KCl, NaHCO 3, NaSO 4, KNO 3, NaNO 3, CaHCO 3, MgHCO 3, MgSO 4 are likely to occur in groundwater system. The observed chemical variations may be attributed to sediment water interaction, ion exchange, dissolution mechanisms and anthropogenic influences such as application of fertilizers and effluents from sugar factories and paper mills. A general increase in TDS is observed in samples during June 2006. The increase in salinity is attributed to evaporation from water table, irrigation return <b>flows,</b> <b>anthropogenic</b> activities and below average rainfall in 2005 and 2006...|$|R
40|$|The flow {{regimes of}} large arid river {{catchments}} are amongst the most {{variable in the}} world. Plant communities which inhabit arid floodplains typically exhibit high spatial heterogeneity and are temporally dynamic in response to changing flow condi-tions. It {{has been suggested that}} arid floodplain ecosystems, adapted as they are to variability, will be relatively resilient to <b>anthropogenic</b> alterations to <b>flow.</b> This paper argues that floodplain plant communities in arid catchments, as in temperate and tropical regions, are primarily structured by flow regimes despite their inherent unpredictability. Consequently, changes to flood pulses through water extraction can be expected to result in changes in vegetation composition and structure which in turn may have a dramatic effect on wider ecosystem functioning. Results are presented from an ongoing study of the Cooper Creek floodplain in central Australia which illustrate the relationships between plant community dynamics and variable flood pulses. These results indicate that alterations to flow may result in a shift in community structure and an eventual loss of bio-diversity. It is essential, therefore, that water resource managers in arid regions consider the requirements of floodplain plant communities when allocating environmental flows.

40|$|International audienceAn {{integrated}} global {{water resources}} model was developed consisting of six modules: land surface hydrology, river routing, crop growth, reservoir operation, environmental flow requirement estimation, and anthropogenic water withdrawal. It simulates {{both natural and}} <b>anthropogenic</b> water <b>flow</b> globally (excluding Antarctica) {{on a daily basis}} at a spatial resolution of 1 °× 1 ° (longitude and latitude). The simulation period is 10 years, from 1986 to 1995. This first part of the two-feature report describes the input meteorological forcing and natural hydrological cycle modules of the integrated model, namely the land surface hydrology module and the river routing module. The input meteorological forcing was provided by the second Global Soil Wetness Project (GSWP 2), an international land surface modeling project. Several reported shortcomings of the forcing component were improved. The land surface hydrology module was developed based on a bucket type model that simulates energy and water balance on land surfaces. Simulated runoff was compared and validated with observation-based global runoff data sets and observed streamflow records at 32 major river gauging stations around the world. Mean annual runoff agreed well with earlier studies at global, continental, and continental zonal mean scales, indicating the validity of the input meteorological data and land surface hydrology module. In individual basins, the mean bias was less than ± 20 % in 14 of the 32 river basins and less than ± 50 % in 24 of the basins. The performance was similar to the best available precedent studies with closure of energy and water. The timing of the peak in streamflow and the shape of monthly hydrographs were well simulated in most of the river basins when large lakes or reservoirs did not affect them. The results indicate that the input meteorological forcing component and the land surface hydrology module provide a framework with which to assess global water resources, with the potential application to investigate the subannual variability in water resources. GSWP 2 participants are encouraged to re-run their model using this newly developed meteorological forcing input, which is in identical format to the original GSWP 2 forcing input...|$|R

In the reservoir operation module, 452 major reservoirs with &gt; 1 km 3 each of storage capacity store and release water according to their own rules of operation. Operating rules were determined for each reservoir by an algorithm that used currently available global data such as reservoir storage capacity, intended purposes, simulated inflow, and water demand in the lower reaches. The environmental flow requirement module was newly developed based on case studies from around the world.

40|$|Planning for "water-sensitive" cities {{has become}} a {{priority}} for sustainable urban development in Australia. There has been little quantification of the term, however. Furthermore, the water balance of most cities is not well known. Following prolonged drought, {{there has also been}} a growing need to make Australian cities more water self-reliant: to source water from within. This article formalizes a systematic mass-balance framework to quantify all <b>anthropogenic</b> and natural <b>flows</b> {{into and out of the}} urban environment. Quantitative performance indicators are derived, including (1) degree of system centralization; (2) overall balance; potential of (3) rainfall, (4) stormwater, and (5) wastewater to offset current demand; and (6) water cycle rate. Using the method, we evaluate Sydney, Melbourne, South East Queensland and Perth using reported and modeled data. The approach makes visible large flows of water that have previously been unaccounted and ignored. It also highlights significant intercity variation. In 2004 - 2005, the cities varied 54 % to 100 % in their supply centralization, 257 % to 397 % in the ratio of rainfall and water use, 47 % to 104 % in their potential stormwater recycling potential, and 26 % to 86 % in wastewater recycling potential. The approach provides a practical, water-focused application of the urban metabolism framework. It demonstrates how the principles of mass balance can help foster robust water accounting, monitoring, and management. More important, it contributes to the design and quantitative assessment of water-sensitive cities of the future. No Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|Andean {{headwater}} catchments play {{a pivotal}} role to supply fresh water for downstream water users. However, few long-term studies exist on {{the relative importance of}} climate change and direct <b>anthropogenic</b> perturbations on <b>flow</b> regimes. In this paper, we assess multi-decadal change in freshwater provision based on long time series (1974 – 2008) of hydrometeorological data and land cover reconstructions for a 282 km 2 catchment located in the tropical Andes. Three main land cover change trajectories can be distinguished: (1) rapid decline of native vegetation in montane forest and páramo ecosystems in ~ 1 / 5 or 20 % of the catchment area, (2) expansion of agricultural land by 14 % of the catchment area, (3) afforestation of 12 % of native páramo grasslands with exotic tree species in recent years. Given the strong temporal variability of precipitation and streamflow data related to El Niño–Southern Oscillation, we use empirical mode decomposition techniques to detrend the time series. The long-term increasing trend in rainfall is remarkably different from the observed changes in streamflow that exhibit a decreasing trend. Hence, observed changes in streamflow are not the result of long-term climate change but very likely result from direct anthropogenic disturbances after land cover change. Partial water budgets for montane cloud forest and páramo ecosystems suggest that the strongest changes in evaporative water losses are observed in páramo ecosystems, where progressive colonization and afforestation of high alpine grasslands leads to a strong increase in transpiration losses...|$|R
