2500|$|Fusion One Corporation is a US {{organization}} {{founded in}} 2015 by Dr. Paul Sieck, Dr. Scott Cornish and Randall Volberg. They {{are developing a}} magneto-electrostatic reactor named [...] "F1" [...] that is based in-part on the polywell. It introduces a system of externally mounted electromagnet coils with internally mounted cathode repeller surfaces that provide a new means of preserving energy and particle losses {{that would otherwise be}} lost through the magnetic cusps. In response to Todd Rider's 1995 power balance conclusions, a new analytical model was developed based on this recovery function as well as a more accurate quantum relativistic treatment of the bremmstralung losses that was not present in Rider's analysis, which relied on interpolation. The new model demonstrated ample multiples of net gain with D-T and sufficient multiples with D-D to be used for generating electricity. Prior to building a scale reactor, they are developing an HPC simulation and benchtop test device using a modified spindle cusp to validate these results.

Each of the projects is being documented from its inception through planning, drilling, and resource confirmation, design, construction, and one year of monitoring. The information is being collected, evaluated, and will be reported. Several reports will be produced, including detailed topical reports on economics, institutional and regulatory problems, engineering, and a summary final report.

40|$|AbstractThe {{academic}} programmes at UKM {{are managed}} by various faculties, institutes and centres through the Quality Management System (QMS) of MS ISO 9001 : 2008 for Management of Undergraduate and Postgraduate Studies. This system ensures that all processes are conducted smoothly and {{in accordance with}} the requirements of the standards which encompass the design of an academic programme up till the management of examinations and graduation. The efficiency and effectiveness of the system is monitored through a series of scheduled internal audits, third party audits by the certifying body and also through the <b>annual</b> Management <b>Review</b> <b>Meeting.</b> In addition, in its efforts to obtain the status of a Self-Accrediting Institution, UKM mandated that all the academic programmes complied with the standards stipulated in the Code of Practice for Programme Accreditation (COPPA) produced by the Malaysian Qualifications Agency (MQA). As both these standards have different approaches in quality assurance of an academic programme, it is necessary to align and harmonise both systems such that they complement each other. Therefore, this paper presents the gap analysis consequent to a mapping between the requirements of COPPA with the QMS document. The results showed that 80 % of the COPPA requirements are already covered in the QMS, whereas coverage with the remaining 20 % requires amendments in specific clauses in the QMS document and other policies such as the Policy on Teaching and Learning, Policy on Bridging of Academic Programmes and Policy on Information Communication Technology. The findings of the study can be used to ensure full compliance with COPPA if the processes described in the modified QMS and policies are implemented in totality...|$|R

Processing conditions were optimized to obtain well sintered LSM, LSF, LSCF, LNF, and LCF for SOFC cell and stacks working at 600 - 800 C. Series of nanocrystalline bulk and thin films of La{sub 0. 8 }Sr{sub 0. 2 }Ga{sub 0. 83 }Mg{sub 0. 17 }O{sub 2. 815 }, LaSr{sub 0. 2 }Fe{sub 0. 8 }O{sub 3 }, LaSr{sub 0. 2 }Co{sub 0. 8 }Fe{sub 0. 2 }O{sub 3 }, La{sub 0. 8 }Ni{sub 0. 7 }Fe{sub 0. 3 }O{sub 3 }, LaCr{sub 0. 7 }Fe{sub 0. 3 }O{sub 3 } were prepared at very low temperatures and characterized using XRD, SEM, HRTEM, XPS, EXAFS, and EIS techniques. The influence of preparation techniques on the microstructure, grain-size and consequently on the electrical transport properties were investigated. Processing conditions, sintering temperature (1200 - 1500 C) and time severely affected the grain size (< 0. 1 {micro}m to 10 {micro}m) and the resistance in all grain-boundary (3 k{Omega} to 175 k{Omega}). Through investigations of A and B site doping in perovskite materials, we have reduced cathode-electrolyte interfacial resistance, will be very effective for the SOFCs operating {approx} 750 C. Epitaxial films of LiFeNiO{sub 3 }, for SOFCs cathode were deposited on LaAl{sub 2 }O{sub 3 }, MgO, and YSZ single crystals by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) method, and characterized using advanced spectroelectrochemical techniques. The film orientations depend on the substrate planes. Surface morphology of the films also depends on the substrate orientations. These films showed different electrode properties depending on the orientations. The porous characteristic of the electrode materials are achieved by the combination of combustion and microwave sintering using SiC as susceptor (1200 - 1400 C). Concurrently, the other oxygen ionic/protonic conducting oxides (perovskites, pyrochlores, and apatites) were also prepared, characterized and understood the {{role in the development}} of reduced temperature SOFCs.

40|$|Poster {{presented}} at Idaho National Laboratory for the 2014 Fuel Cycle Technologies <b>Annual</b> <b>Review</b> <b>Meeting.</b> Plutonium is currently used for nuclear energy {{production in the}} form of mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel in a once-through cycle. The spent fuel from these burnup cycles is then discarded as nuclear waste. MOX fuel burnup, however, transmutes some uranium into additional fissile plutonium, which can be extracted and remixed into new burnable MOX fuel. One can, in principle, repeat this process throughout multiple iterations, extracting more energy from nuclear fuel and diminishing the accumulation of plutonium in nuclear waste stockpiles. While the cost of reprocessing MOX fuel remains constant throughout recycling iterations, the isotopic composition of plutonium will change as fissile isotopes of plutonium are used up during MOX fuel burnup, while fertile isotopes accumulate. This isotopic drift will also change the neutronics properties of the MOX fuel made out of the recycled plutonium, which may limit the number of times one may recycle plutonium in such a fuel cycle. We studied the extent to which plutonium is recyclable in such a manner by running simulations of MOX fuel burnup in a pressurized water reactor using the 2 D neutronics code CASMO- 4 E...|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} of the research was to enhance steel and aluminum manufacturing {{with the development of}} a new plasma RPD device. During the project (1) plasma devices were manufactured (2) testing for the two metals were carried out and (3) market development strategies were explored. Bayzi Corporation has invented a Rapid Plasma Device (RPD) which produces plasma, comprising of a mixture of ionized gas and free electrons. The ions, when they hit a conducting surface, deposit heat in addition to the convective heat. Two generic models called the RPD-Al and RPD-S have been developed for the aluminum market and the steel market. Aluminum melting rates increased to as high as 12. 7 g/s compared to 3 g/s of the current industrial practice. The RPD melting furnace operated at higher energy efficiency of 65 % unlike most industrial processes operating in the range of 13 to 50 %. The RPD aluminum melting furnace produced environment friendly cleaner melts with less than 1 % dross. Dross is the residue in the furnace after the melt is poured out. Cast ingots were extremely clean and shining. Current practices produce dross in the range of 3 to 12 %. The RPD furnace uses very low power ~ 0. 2 kWh/Lb to melt aluminum. RPDs operate in one atmosphere using ambient air to produce plasma while the conventional systems use expensive gases like argon, or helium in air-tight chambers. RPDs are easy to operate and do not need intensive capital investment. Narrow beam, as well as wide area plasma have been developed for different applications. An RPD was developed for thermal treatments of steels. Two different applications have been pursued. Industrial air hardening steel knife edges were subjected to plasma beam hardening. Hardness, as measured, indicated uniform distribution without any distortion. The biggest advantage with this method is that the whole part need not be heated in a furnace which will lead to oxidation and distortion. No conventional process will offer localized hardening. The RPD has a great potential for heat treating surgical knives and tools. Unavailability of the full amount of the DOE award prevented further development of this exciting technology. Significant progress was made during the 5 th quarter, specially the invention of the wider-area plasma and the resultant benefits in terms of rapid melting of aluminum and thermal treatments of larger size steel parts. Coating of nickel base superalloys was demonstrated (an additional task over that proposed). Directed low cost surface enhancement of steel and the directed clean low dross energy efficient melting of aluminum are industrial needs that require new technologies. These are large volume markets which can benefit from energy savings. Estimated energy savings are very large, in the order of 1015 J/year when the equipment is universally used. Compact and directed heating technology/product market in these two sectors could potentially reach over $ 1 B in sales. The results of the research, presented at the DOE <b>annual</b> <b>Review</b> <b>meeting</b> on Aluminum held at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory during the 4 - 5 October 2005, were very well received by the delegates and panel reviewers.
