5|$|The {{outlines}} of an animal's body {{can be made}} hard to see by other methods, such as by using a highly irregular outline.

5|$|Along {{with several}} other roads in the Highlands, the A82 between Tyndrum and Glencoe has been {{installed}} with permanent gates that <b>are</b> <b>closed</b> {{in the event of}} severe weather. These gates are now fitted with fibre-optic illuminated signs. The road has been identified as one of several trunk roads in the Highlands that suffers from problems with deer-vehicle collisions. In 1996, Transport Scotland set up a number of vehicle activated warning signs alerting drivers attention to nearby deer. Four of these signs are on the A82 between Tyndrum and Glencoe.|$|E
5|$|Compartment {{syndrome}} is treated with surgery {{to relieve the}} pressure inside the muscle compartment and {{reduce the risk of}} compression on blood vessels and nerves in that area. Fasciotomy is the incision of the affected compartment. Often, multiple incisions are made and left open until the swelling has reduced. At that point, the incisions <b>are</b> <b>closed,</b> often requiring debridement (removal of non-viable tissue) and skin grafting in the process. The need for fasciotomy may be decreased if mannitol is used, as it can relieve muscle swelling directly.|$|E
5|$|Domestic American {{alligators}} {{range from}} long and slender to short and robust, possibly due to variations in {{factors such as}} growth rate, diet, and climate. American alligators have broad snouts, especially in captive individuals. When the jaws <b>are</b> <b>closed,</b> {{the edges of the}} upper jaws cover the lower teeth which fit into the jaws' hollows. Like the spectacled caiman, this species has a bony nasal ridge, though it is less prominent. The teeth number 74–80. Dorsally, adult American alligators may be olive, brown, gray, or black in color, while their undersides are cream-colored.|$|E

Other coal mines are located in the Ogbete and Coal Camp layouts; these mines are located on the periphery of the city near the Iva Valley as well.|$|E
5|$|In 2009 {{there were}} 2,340 armed forces {{personnel}} stationed in Dorset including the Royal Armoured Corps at Bovington, Royal Signals at Blandford and the Royal Marines at Poole. The military presence {{has had a}} mixed effect on the local economy, bringing additional employment for civilians, but on occasion having {{a negative impact on}} the tourist trade, particularly when popular areas <b>are</b> <b>closed</b> for military manoeuvres. Plans to relocate the Royal School of Signals from Blandford to South Wales could result in a loss of up to £74million GVA for the area.|$|E
5|$|Lady Denman Drive, a roadway {{atop the}} dam wall, {{provides}} a third road crossing for the lake.

5|$|Meibomian glands, in the eyelids, secrete {{a form of}} sebum called meibum {{onto the}} eye, that slows the {{evaporation}} of tears. It also serves to create an airtight seal when the eyes <b>are</b> <b>closed</b> and its lipid quality also prevents the eyelids from sticking together. The meibomian glands are also known as tarsal glands, Zeis glands and palpebral glands. They attach directly to the follicles of the eyelashes, which are arranged vertically within the tarsal plates of the eyelids.|$|E
5|$|The entire metro {{system and}} the trains are run by a fully {{automated}} computer system, located at the Control and Maintenance Center south of Vestamager Station. The automatic train control (ATC) consists of three subsystems: automatic train protection (ATP), automatic train operation (ATO) and automatic train supervisory (ATS). The ATP is responsible for keeping the trains' speed, ensuring that doors <b>are</b> <b>closed</b> before departure and switches are correctly set. The system uses fixed block signaling, except around stations, where moving block signaling is used.|$|E

5|$|The gilding and monumentality of {{the cross}} link it to the Byzantine tradition. Christ's static pose is {{reflective}} of this style, while the work overall incorporates newer, more naturalistic aspects. The work presents a lifelike and physically imposing depiction of the passion at Calvary. Christ is shown nearly naked: his eyes <b>are</b> <b>closed,</b> his face lifeless and defeated. His body slumps in a position contorted by prolonged agony. A graphic portrayal of human suffering, the painting is of seminal importance in art history and has influenced painters from Michelangelo, Caravaggio and Velázquez to Francis Bacon.|$|E
5|$|The {{keys are}} a {{transitional}} area capable of hosting unexpected birds, often Caribbean species that have strayed near the mainland. The {{interior of the}} keys are frequented by warblers and the hawks that prey on them. Coastal zones are habitat for ruddy turnstones and least sandpipers. Gulls and terns include royal terns, laughing gulls and ring-billed gulls, with brown pelicans just offshore. Wilson's plovers nest on Boca Chita Key, where nesting zones <b>are</b> <b>closed</b> during breeding season.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} method of {{controlling}} the louvers is the balanced swell pedal. This device is usually placed above {{the centre of the}} pedalboard and is configured to rotate away from the organist from a near-vertical position (in which the shades <b>are</b> <b>closed)</b> to a near-horizontal position (in which the shades are open). An organ may also have a similar-looking crescendo pedal, found alongside any expression pedals. Pressing the crescendo pedal forward cumulatively activates the stops of the organ, starting with the softest and ending with the loudest; pressing it backwards reverses this process.|$|E
