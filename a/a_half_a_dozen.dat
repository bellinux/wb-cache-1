25|$|Considering {{that the}} writing of the general {{newspaper}} worker was for the most part anonymous, the organization felt that its ranks do not appear at a disadvantage when compared with those of other press associations. the PCWPA's population was so scattered over a large territory, that it could not show many influential Western newspaper connections. On the other hand, the Western vigor of style had become popular, with nearly all of the writers retaining from one to <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> connections with influential Eastern and English periodicals. As a member of the General Federation of Women's Clubs, the International League of Press Clubs and the Woman's National Press Association, the PCWPA was abreast with the spirit of organization, at the same time confident that responsible individualism was the basis of strength.|$|E

In a 2004 interview, the Edge said that Bono [...] "scared {{the shit out of}} [...] " [...] by climbing onto the rig and risking electrocution by the live wires in close proximity. Bono said [...] "good night" [...] to the crowd on nearly <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> occasions so that the post-production crew would have several choices of songs with which to end the film. Backstage, the band members were disappointed that the crowd did not initially chant [...] "how long to sing this song?"

However, tour manager Dennis Sheehan hid underneath the crowd barrier and began singing the refrain into a microphone without being asked. Eventually, the crowd joined in; the film was edited to disguise the fact that the singing was organised.|$|E

2500|$|Even {{after his}} {{discovery}} by Carmichael, Laine still was considered only an intermission act at Billy Berg's. His next big break {{came when he}} dusted off a fifteen-year-old song that few people remembered in 1946, [...] "That's My Desire". Laine {{had picked up the}} song from songstress June Hart <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> years earlier, when he sang at the College Inn in Cleveland. He introduced [...] "Desire" [...] as a [...] "new" [...] song—meaning new to his repertoire at Berg's—but the audience mistook it for a new song that had just been written. He ended up singing it five times that night. After that, Laine quickly became the star attraction at Berg's, and record company executives took note.|$|E
