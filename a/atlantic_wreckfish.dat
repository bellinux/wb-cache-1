50|$|<b>Atlantic</b> <b>wreckfish</b> are {{deep-water fish}} {{found on the}} ocean bottom at depths between 40 and 600 m (130 to 2,000 ft), where they inhabit caves and shipwrecks (thus their name). They are largely solitary fish, but juveniles will school below {{floating}} objects. Wreckfish are oviparous fish that spawn in the summer. They do not guard their eggs or young. The diets of <b>Atlantic</b> <b>wreckfish</b> consist mainly of large ocean cephalopods, crustaceans, and other bottom-dwelling fishes. The fish are important as a game fish, reaching a maximum reported length of 210 cm (7 ft) and weight of 100 kg (220 lb). They are also occasionally sold commercially both fresh and frozen.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Atlantic</b> <b>wreckfish,</b> Polyprion americanus, is a marine, bathydemersal, and oceanodromous fish in {{the family}} Polyprionidae. It {{is found in the}} eastern and western Atlantic Ocean, western Indian Ocean, and the {{southwest}} Pacific Ocean. It is also known as stone bass, because it inhabits rocky ledges and wrecks. Polyprion moeone (Bass groper) is now recognised a junior synonym.|$|E

50|$|Diving areas include Portinho on the {{sheltered}} {{north coast}} of the Laje, a smooth rocky slope that presents little difficulty to the diver.It is inhabited by many benthic fish and invertebrates, and sea turtles are often present.The Boca da Baleia (Whale's Mouth) is a rock formation {{on the south side}} of the Laje de Santos where many fish and turtles are found, with a depth of up to 18 m.The Ponta Leste (East Point) of the Laje de Santos descends to 29 m.Halfway down it is common to see southern stingray, large groupers, <b>Atlantic</b> <b>wreckfish</b> and even Atlantic goliath groupers.Nearer the surface there are always many turtles and assorted shoals of fish.The Naufrágio do Moréia (Moray Wreck) is a deliberately wrecked iron fishing boat that was sunk in 1995 to create an artificial reef.The boat is disintegrating, so should not be entered.It is home to invertebrates such as anemones and gorgonians, crustaceans, groupers, sargos, white grunt (Haemulon plumierii) and salema porgys.|$|E
40|$|Southwestern <b>Atlantic</b> <b>wreckfish</b> Polyprion americanus (27 ◦ 56 ′S and 34 ◦ 52 ′S) were aged using {{transverse}} thin {{sections of}} the sagittae otoliths of 390 individuals (44 – 155 cm TL, total length). The index of average percentage error for independent readings of two readers was 3 %, and 10 % of the sections were considered illegible. Marginal state assessment of the whole otolith’s margin (n = 406) showed that one opaque band (annulus) is laid down each spring–summer. Supposed daily ring counts confirmed what {{was thought to be}} the first annual band. Maximum observed age was 76 years for males and 62 years for females. The von Bertalanffy growth model was significantly different (P < 0. 01) between males (L ∞ = 109. 5 cm, K = 0. 084 per year and t 0 = − 4. 69 years) and females (L = 129. 5 cm, K = 0. 0534 per year and t 0 = − 6. 80 years). The absence of wreckfish below 44 cm TL in the samples and younger than 1. 5 years means that this is the minimum size and age of recruitment to the bottom. © 2003 Elsevier B. V.
