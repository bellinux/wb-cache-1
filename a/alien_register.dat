50|$|Although Ukrainians {{have visited}} {{and lived in}} the United Kingdom since the late-18th century, the first {{documented}} evidence of Ukrainians in the UK was an entry in the <b>Aliens</b> <b>Register</b> in Salford of J. Koyetsky from Brody (then Austrian Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria) in 1897. Some 100 families settled in Manchester prior to World War I, and in the post-war years a community centre was established. An Information Centre was founded in London and religious and cultural links established with Manchester. In 1931 Bishop Andrey Sheptytsky and Fr Josyf Slipyj, each of whom in turn in later years became head of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church, made a notable pastoral visit to Manchester. Elsewhere, {{the first generation of}} Ukrainian immigrants started arriving in the South-East, in particular, Hertfordshire in 1947 as displaced persons.|$|R

40|$|Before the 1970 s, {{registers}} {{were primarily}} used for individual reference, for which purpose paper registers are quite adequate. The first electronic registers rationalised {{the collection and}} availability of information and improved the possibilities of collecting statistics. In the 1970 s, advanced statistics and prognoses were prerequisites for centralised social planning. From 1979 onwards, law regulated the use of electronic registers. This prevented the misuse of personal information concerning individuals. In the 1980 s, processes and results {{that had previously been}} viewed as immeasurable, became better defined and were becoming measurable. At the same time as electronic registers were adapting to their new functions, they were still being used for individual references. The study includes four case studies, each illustrating distinctive features in the history of electronic registers. With the registration of university students’ examinations, the Ministry was able to build up a result-orientated basis for the distribution of funds to the university, that is, the new register met new political needs. Establishing the Central Civil Registration meant that every citizen was given his/her own number which was used as an identi­fier in any state register concerning the citizens. Hence, pieces of information in different electronic registers could be combined. The Electronic <b>Aliens</b> <b>Register</b> replaced a huge paper register and made access to the register much easier for regional and state authorities than it had been previously. And finally, municipal autonomy made it difficult to establish the National Patient Registry. Local registers that referred to common guidelines had to be accepted in order for the registry to become functional...|$|R

40|$|North Queensland's sparse {{population}} {{has long been}} prey to fears of invasion. Suspicion has rested on the French, Russians, Chinese and Germans in turn, and though the region's isolation has in fact kept it comfortably insulated from direct military threat, the defence issue has been useful in gaining Government concessions and public works to encourage settlement. Even the 1914 - 1918 war had little effect; for Hinchinbrook, a rich cane-growing Shire centred on Ingham, war-related activities were mainly confined to fund-raising by patriotic organisations and recruiting drives. Prices rose, the coastal steamer service became even more erratic than before, {{there was a brief}} labour shortage and farmers were terrorized by an official threat to take their draught horses for military use, but apart from the stir caused by the conscription debate and the localised Impact of men killed or wounded in action, the community's routine was disturbed f 2 little. World War Two however brought a genuine threat o invasion to north Queensland; its effects were to be more dramatic. Its first Impact was muted and reminiscent of World War One. The Shire Council's first reaction was to hope that defence works might include the coast road from Cardwell to Townsville and the Ingham 2 aerodrome. Military camps were held, arrangements begun for the remote possibility of air raids, and a Women's National Emergency 3 Legion was formed even before war actually broke out in September 1939. The Shire Chairman, Larry Kelly, then convened a meeting to form an Emergency Committee which was to decide on air raid and gas precautions and an evacuation procedure; before long red crosses were painted on the Hospital roof and sirens were being tested. Local branches of the Patriotic Fund, Comforts Fund and Red Cross were formed, and after some bickering defined their respective roles to the satisfaction of the community. However, their activities were still overshadowed by school and church benefits. More ominous were the warnings of impending petrol restrictions, censorship of weather forecasts and shipping movements, and the requirement that <b>aliens</b> <b>register</b> with th...|$|R
40|$|Alien Registration Act of 1940 was principally an anti-sedition {{enactment}} {{passed by}} the Congress in June, 1940 and {{signed into law by}} President Franklin D. Roosevelt. This Act is commonly referred to as the Smith Act, named after Howard D. Smith, the author of its’ anti-sedition section, and is similar to the New York Criminal Anarchy Act of 1902, sustained in 1925 in Gitlow v. New York. The Smith Act made it a criminal offence for any person or organization to advocate the forcible or violent overthrow of the United States Government. It also required registration of personal and professional details as well as political affiliations and fingerprinting of all alien residents of United States above to age of 14.

The system, which was to be implemented by the 1973 federal law on civil registry, was rejected in 1976, when the Bundestag found the concept of an identification system for the entire population to be incompatible with the existing legal framework.In East Germany, a similar system named Personenkennzahl (PKZ) was set up in 1970 and remained in use until the state ceased to exist in 1990.|$|R
50|$|<b>Registered</b> <b>aliens</b> {{are allowed}} to adopt an alias (tsūshōmei) or 通名 as a second legal name.

Foreigners who are long-term residents of Japan, particularly ethnic Koreans whose families have lived in Japan for generations, often adopt Japanese names as aliases in order to integrate within society. Ethnic Japanese who live in Japan as resident aliens may use a legal alias to reflect their ancestral name. Legal aliases are also used when registering a seal in a different script than the applicant's legal name (e.g., in katakana rather than Latin script).|$|R

5000|$|The {{result of}} these large {{movements}} of immigrants coming from Southeastern and Northwestern Europe presented a necessity for the Americanization of the country's foreign populace. According to the United States Census Bureau, in 1910, there were about 13,000,000 foreign-born and 33,000,000 residents of a foreign origin living in the United States. About 3,000,000 of the foreign-born over ten years of age were unable to speak English and about 1,650,000 were unable to read or write in any language. Close to half of the foreign-born populace were males of voting age; but only 4 out of every 1,000 of them were being educated to learn English and about American citizenship. In total, about 5,000,000 people in the United States were unable to speak English and of those 5,000,000, 2,000,000 were illiterate. The United States {{was not aware of}} the full extent of this growing issue until World War I in 1914. One example of the war's illumination of this problem of [...] "non-Americanized" [...] immigrants is, in 1910, only 34 percent of foreign males of draft age were unable to speak English; about half a million of the <b>registered</b> <b>alien</b> male draftees were unable to understand military orders given in English.
