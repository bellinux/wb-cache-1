And, the Clause also prohibits a state from barring a defendant from being cross-examined by counsel, or restricting {{the order in which}} the defendant may be called as a witness. Further, the court may not prevent a defendant from consulting with her counsel during an overnight recess, even if the recess bisects direct- and cross-examination of the defendant.

25|$|The {{taxpayer}} Robert L. Schulz filed motions in {{a federal}} court to quash administrative summonses issued by the IRS seeking testimony and documents in connection with an IRS investigation. The court in Schulz did not rule that a taxpayer has <b>a</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the IRS explain why {{he or she is}} subject to taxation, and that issue was not presented to the court. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the dismissal of the taxpayer's motions for a lack of subject matter jurisdiction because there was no actual case or controversy as required by Article III of the Constitution. The court reasoned that the summonses posed no threat of injury to the taxpayer, as the IRS had not yet initiated enforcement proceedings against him. In other words, the taxpayer was not entitled to a court order to quash the summonses until the IRS went to court to demand that he comply with the summons or otherwise face sanctions—something the IRS had not yet done. Once the IRS took that action, the taxpayer would then have ample opportunity to challenge the validity of the summonses.|$|E

500|$|The Supreme Court has {{previously}} held that citizens have certain fundamental rights {{upon which the}} government cannot infringe, unless the deprivation of that right is necessary to achieve a compelling government interest. This doctrine, arising from the [...] "liberty clause" [...] of the Fourteenth Amendment, is known as substantive due process. The right to privacy {{was found to be}} fundamental under this doctrine, and a number of rights to choice came out of it, such as in Roe v. Wade, where the Court found <b>a</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> an abortion and in Meyer v. Nebraska, where the court found a parental right to raise their children as they wish. In Griswold v. Connecticut the Court extended this doctrine to the right to procure contraception. Substantive due process was further expanded to encompass children with In re Gault establishing that children have a right to procedural due process when the state attempts to take custody of them.|$|E
500|$|It {{has been}} noted {{generally}} that natural justice is a fundamental element {{of the rule of}} law. In administrative law, the two principles of natural justice, which constitute a framework for common law procedural rights, are the rule against bias (nemo iudex in causa sua, or [...] "no man a judge in his own cause") and the right to be heard (audi alteram partem, or [...] "hear the other side"). In the Australian case Gas and Fuel Corporation of Victoria v. Wood Hall Ltd. & Leonard Pipeline Contractors Ltd. (1978), the Supreme Court of Victoria said that the ideas underlying both principles are that of [...] "fairness and judgement only after a full and fair hearing given to all parties." [...] Speaking in Parliament on 24 November 1999, MP Toh See Kiat expressed the view that the Singapore legal system does apply the rules of natural justice, which he described thus: [...] "atural justice requires essentially two basic principles. One is that {{you have the right to}} be heard and to explain your case, and, two, is the right to equal treatment. <b>A</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> your case heard also means that there is a review." ...|$|E

[...] The public has <b>a</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> access to all information and to determine the reliability and importance of the information.

2500|$|Article 29a, in addition, {{guarantees}} <b>a</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> legal disputes {{judged by}} a judicial authority. This provision, which {{was adopted by}} popular vote in 2000 and entered into force in 2007, is intended to realise more fully the right guaranteed by article 6 of the ECHR to a hearing by a [...] "independent and impartial tribunal established by law". In administrative law in particular, access to a court was previously not possible in all cases. As {{a result of this}} constitutional provision, the Federal Administrative Court replaced a number of administrative review panels in 2007. The provision still allows statutes to exclude judicial review in [...] "exceptional cases" [...] that are considered not amenable to judicial review, such as actes de gouvernement e.g. in the area of national security, or acts of pardon or clemency. In any case, the provision's impact remains somewhat limited because article 190 excludes all federal statutes from judicial review.|$|E
2500|$|In cl 4(1) the Bill created <b>a</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{access to}} an Employment Tribunal under s 111 ERA 1996. This gives any person the right to bring an unfair {{dismissal}} claim against an [...] "employer", and the bill expressly provided in cl 4(2) that for this purpose both the agency and the end-user are employers. However, in an action for unfair dismissal, the claimant would need to show that an employer had (unsurprisingly) in some way acted [...] "unfairly" [...] (s 98 ERA 1996). The way people demonstrate [...] "unfairness" [...] {{is to show that}} some pre-existing right has been breached. If an agency worker is not considered an [...] "employee", then he will probably not be able to rely on the ERA 1996 rights which require it.

Karl added that no mention of the Stalin-Hitler Pact is made. Polish author Łukasz Jasina commented that the Bug River is spoken of as the Polish border already during 1944 – although the USSR annexed the eastern territories of Poland only after the war. Russian historian Boris Sokolov wrote that the film's depiction of Battle of Kursk [...] was [...] "completely false" [...] and the German casualties were exaggerated.

2500|$|As {{noted by}} Edward R. Dickinson, the Revolution and the {{democratisation}} {{of the state}} and local franchise provided Social Democracy with a greater degree of influence at all levels of government than it had been able to achieve before 1914. As a result of the reform of municipal franchises, socialists gained control of many of the country’s major cities. This provided Social Democrats with a considerable degree of influence in social policy, as most welfare programmes (even those programmes mandated by national legislation) were implemented by municipal government. By the Twenties, with the absence of a revolution and the reformist and revision element dominant in the SPD, Social Democrats regarded the expansion of social welfare programmes, and particularly the idea that the citizen had <b>a</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> his or her basic needs met by society at large, as central to the construction of a just and democratic social order. Social Democrats therefore pushed the expansion of social welfare programmes energetically at all levels of government, and SPD municipal administrations were in the forefront of the development of social programmes. As remarked by Hedwig Wachenheim in 1926, under Social Democratic administration many of the country’s larger cities began to become experimental “proletarian cooperatives.” ...|$|E

[...] Romney added, [...] "There are some people who say should we have a two state solution, and the Israelis would be happy [...] to have a two state solution. It's the Palestinians who don't want a two state solution, they want to eliminate the state of Israel. And I believe America must say the best way to have peace in the Middle East is not for us to vacillate and appease, but it is to say we stand with our friend Israel. We are committed to a Jewish state in Israel. We will not have an inch of difference between ourselves and our ally Israel." [...] Despite his pessimism about a two-state solution being achieved in the short term, Romney has defended the two-state solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict as an ideal that ought {{to be included in the}} Republican Party platform.|$|E
2500|$|The {{right to}} marry a person of a {{different}} race was addressed in Loving v. Virginia, in which the Court said, in 1967, that its decision striking down anti-miscegenation laws could be justified either by substantive due process, or by the Equal Protection Clause. Advocates of substantive due process have sought to extend Loving {{in order to establish}} other rights (such as a right to same-sex marriage). <b>A</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> children was addressed in Skinner v. Oklahoma, but the Court in Skinner, in 1942, explicitly declined to base its decision on due process but instead cited the Equal Protection Clause since the Oklahoma law required sterilization of some three-time felons but not others. A substantive due process right of a parent to educate a young child (before ninth grade) in a foreign language was recognized in Meyer v. Nebraska, in 1923, with two justices dissenting, and Justice Kennedy has mentioned that Meyer might be decided on different grounds in modern times. Laws that [...] "shock the conscience" [...] of the Court were generally deemed unconstitutional, in 1952, in Rochin v. California, but in concurring, Justices Black and Douglas argued that pumping a defendant's stomach for evidence should have been deemed unconstitutional on the narrower ground that it violates the Fifth Amendment's ban on self-incrimination. The Court, in O'Connor v. Donaldson, in 1975, said that due process is violated by confining a nondangerous mentally ill person who is capable of surviving safely in freedom. Chief Justice Burger's concurring opinion was that such confinement may also amount to [...] "punishment" [...] for being mentally ill, violating the Court's interpretation of the Eighth Amendment in Robinson v. California. Freedom from excessive punitive damages was deemed to be a due process right in BMW v. Gore, in 1996, but four justices disagreed. The Court, in Cruzan v. Missouri, decided, in 1990, that due process is not violated if a state applies [...] "a clear and convincing evidence standard in proceedings where a guardian seeks to discontinue nutrition and hydration of a person diagnosed to be in a persistent vegetative state." ...|$|E

25|$|Deck v. Missouri is a {{significant}} case because it outlines new <b>rights</b> given <b>to</b> convicted defendants.

Furthermore, the court stated that during the sentencing phase of his trial, Deck deserved the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> participate in “dignified courtroom proceedings.” This decision gave Deck constitutional rights just after he had been convicted of multiple capital crimes.
