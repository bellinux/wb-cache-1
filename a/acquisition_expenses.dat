The cost minimization analysis was conducted considering only differential costs, i. e. those costs than can differ with the use of one of the two products, and not those common to the two competing products, such as acquisition cost (33 euro in average for both), the costs for the organization, the call of the infants to be vaccinated, etc [...] The differences among the considered alternatives detected by this study regard the work for the preparation and administration of the vaccines, the quantity of special waste they produce and the incidence of serious febrile reactions leading to pharmacological treatment and physician consultation (body temperature > 40 °C). The liquid formulation resulted more convenient in terms of cost for nurse work (0, 63 euro saved per patient), waste disposal, and adverse reactions management.

40|$|Much {{concern has}} been raised {{about the effect of}} "corporatization" of health through the {{expansion}} of investor-owned hospital chains.

In this article, we examine the effect of acquisition by one investor-owned chain on hospital costs and staffing. Subsequent to acquisition, hospital costs increase and staffing decreases, relative to competitor hospitals. However, since investor-owned hospitals not recently acquired do not have higher cost levels than their competitors, the increase in costs appears to be due to factors associated with the acquisition itself rather than factors associated with being an investor-owned hospital. Under the retrospective payment system in effect at the time, revenues also were higher for acquired hospitals. Under prospective payment, increasing revenues has been more difficult, decreasing acquisition incentives...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{optimality}} of debt through {{the interaction between}} security design and information acquisition.

Specifically, the buyer benefits from information <b>acquisition</b> at the <b>expense</b> of the seller through adverse selection. The seller hence deliberately designs the security to induce the buyer to acquire the information least harmful to the seller’s interest. This interaction is flexible since securities can be designed in arbitrary ways.

Compared with the security design literature, we neither restrict coverage to non-decreasing securities nor impose various distributional assumptions on the fundamenta...|$|R

40|$|In Canada, {{appointed}} actuaries {{are required}} to opine on {{the adequacy of the}} policy liabilities for property-casualty insurers. Policy liabilities include both claims and premium liabilities. Several papers have been written and actuarial techniques have been developed to estimate claims liabilities. Premium liabilities, however, have received little, virtually no attention in the actuarial literature. To date, we believe that only Canadian actuaries have been evaluating these liabilities. However, other countries are following that lead. We understand that in some states, regulators will soon require actuarial opinions on the adequacy of unearned premiums for policies with terms exceeding twelve months. The evaluation of premium liabilities consists of examining all related assets and liabilities to ensure that the anticipated net costs to discharge an insurer's obligations with respect to its insurance and reinsurance contracts, except its claim liabilities, are provided for. This paper intends to provide the practicing actuary with some guidelines on the evaluation of the premium liabilities. We will review the individual components of the premium liabilities and the related regulatory requirements and CIA recommendations. Finally, we will present an actuarial approach to evaluate the equity in the unearned premium, the unearned premium deficiency and the deferred policy <b>acquisition</b> <b>expenses.</b> Acknowledgement The authors would like to express their gratitude to Jean-Luc Allard, Richard Belleau, Jean Côté, Bernard Dupont and Betty-Jo Hill for their thorough review and constructive comments...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Comparison of COPD {{financial}} burden and underlying factors, between Eastern upper middle income and a Western European high income, healthcare settings. METHODS: The patient sample was 433 in Belgium and 322 in Serbia, age ≥ 40, with spirometry and clinically confirmed COPD diagnosis. Belgian trial followed patients prospectively during 2006, using structured survey of clinicians in charge. Serbian trial conducted in 2008, retrieved data from clinical invoice database. Time horizon was {{one year and}} perspective of third party payers was taken into account for both studies. Clinical outcomes of interest were disease exacerbation, hospital admission and death. Economic inputs referred to COPD-attributable medical services consumption value during observed period of time. RESULTS: Average annual cost was 1, 812. 84 € for the Serbian patients and 1, 738. 13 €/year for the Belgian patients (not including the value of laboratory diagnostics or imaging techniques). Severity grade and duration of hospital admissions significantly directly correlated with overall cost in both populations. Pattern of diagnostic procedures requested and ATC classes of drug consumed to treat COPD remains similar and comparable in both countries. GDP per capita ratio in respective years (10. 4 : 37. 4), exhibits the paradox of patient being much less affordable to treat in a less developed society. CONCLUSIONS: Burden of COPD in Europe is huge and, due to contemporary life style expected to grow further. We compared cost of illness structures between two societies with different macroeconomic past in healthcare financing and management. According to our findings, direct medical costs were driven by exacerbations and hospital admissions. Significantly cheaper human labor caused higher relative relevance of drug <b>acquisition</b> <b>expenses</b> in the East and higher portion of hospital admission costs in the West. More in-depth research of indirect COPD attributable costs (e. g. lost productivity, absenteeism, premature death etc) will be needed in future.

In this report we hypothesized that factors required for early B cell commitment would bind to PU. 1 and antagonize its ability to induce myeloid differentiation. We investigated whether E 2 A and/or EBF associate with PU. 1. We observed that the E 2 A component, E 47, but not EBF, directly binds to PU. 1. Additionally E 47 represses PU. 1 -dependent transactivation of the MCSFR promoter through antagonizing PU. 1 ’s ability to bind to DNA.

Today, India is on the world map for being a hotbed for mergers & acquisitions with transactions worth US$ 38. 1 billion (IBEF, 2015) recorded in 2014 which is a massive rise from the $ 2. 2 billion worth of M&A transactions booked in 1998. With such growth figures in the merger & acquisition scene in India, a study on the impact on performance of the acquiring firm will be of great interest to researchers as well as the industry in order to shape the future of mergers & acquisitions in India. Furthermore, as M&A activities in India can be clearly distinguished between overseas & domestic, research is required to compare the impact that each of them has on the financial performance of acquiring firms. With these research objectives in mind, the researcher examined the financial performance of the acquiring firms that made domestic & overseas acquisitions during the financial years of 2007 - 08 and 2008 - 09 by studying their financial ratios for a period of 5 years pre-merger and 5 years post-merger and comparing the same using inferential statistical tools.
