40|$|Despite {{a certain}} {{simplicity}} and a well-defined methodology {{for the assessment}} of odour emissions from point <b>sources</b> and active <b>area</b> <b>sources,</b> odour sampling on passive <b>area</b> <b>sources</b> is still a rather debated task, meaning that, up to now, there is not a codified sampling procedure allowing to give reproducible results among different laboratories. Three different kinds of <b>area</b> <b>sources</b> can be distinguished, i. e. liquid passive <b>area</b> <b>sources,</b> solid passive <b>area</b> <b>sources,</b> and landfill surfaces. These three different types of sources are characterized by different volatilization and/or emission phenomena, and shall thus be treated differently while sampling in order to assess a representative odour emission rate.

50|$|A line source, {{as opposed}} to a point source, <b>area</b> <b>source,</b> or volume source, is a source of air, noise, water {{contamination}} or electromagnetic radiation that emanates from a linear (one-dimensional) geometry. The most prominent linear sources are roadway air pollution, aircraft air emissions, roadway noise, certain types of water pollution sources that emanate over a range of river extent rather than from a discrete point, elongated light tubes, certain dose models in medical physics and electromagnetic antennas. While point sources of pollution were studied since the late nineteenth century, linear sources did not receive much attention from scientists until the late 1960s, when environmental regulations for highways and airports began to emerge. At the same time, computers with the processing power to accommodate the data processing needs of the computer models required to tackle these one-dimensional sources became more available.|$|E

40|$|Many of {{the current}} {{published}} emission factors for selected <b>area</b> <b>source</b> solvent categories are derived by, in effect, allocating National solvent consumption data to State and county locations.

40|$|The {{estimation}} of the <b>area</b> <b>source</b> pollutant strength is {{a relevant issue for}} atmospheric environment.

In the inverse analysis, an <b>area</b> <b>source</b> domain is considered, where the strength of such <b>area</b> <b>source</b> term is assumed unknown.

A quasi-Newton method is employed for minimizing the objective function. The second order maximum entropy regularization is used, and the regularization parameter is calculated by the L-curve technique. This inverse problem methodology is tested with synthetic observational data, producing good inverse solutions. Pages: 56 - 6...|$|E
