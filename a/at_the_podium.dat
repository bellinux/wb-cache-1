5|$|C. Floyd Landis was {{the winner}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>podium</b> {{ceremony}} in Paris {{on the last day}} of the 2006 Tour, but subsequently was found to have tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs during stage 17 of the race. The United States Anti-Doping Agency found him guilty of using synthetic testosterone during the race and stripped him of his title on 20 September 2007.|$|E
5|$|D. Alberto Contador was {{the winner}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>podium</b> {{ceremony}} in Paris {{on the last day}} of the 2010 Tour, but subsequently was found to have tested positive for the prohibited substance Clenbuterol on a rest day. The Court of Arbitration for Sport found him guilty of using clenbuterol during the race and stripped him of his title on 6 February 2012.|$|E
50|$|Host Seacrest now {{controlled}} the mouse, because all three teams {{had a chance}} to play every question. One member of each team stood at a different station while their partners remained <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>podiums.</b> After <b>the</b> station or category was chosen, <b>the</b> player <b>at</b> <b>the</b> appropriate place would hear the question and have a chance to answer for $100. A wrong answer meant that <b>the</b> players <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>podiums</b> would have a chance to buzz in and take the money.|$|R
5000|$|Starting {{with the}} lowest-scoring team, each team keeps {{control of the}} mouse {{as long as they}} answer {{questions}} correctly. If at any time they miss a question, <b>the</b> opposing teams <b>at</b> <b>the</b> main <b>podiums</b> can buzz in and steal control. Landing on a [...] "Virus" [...] ("Crash" [...] in the second season) meant a question was asked to <b>the</b> teams <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>podiums</b> for control. If neither team answered correctly, the first team kept control. Question values are still worth anywhere from $25-$100.|$|R
25|$|The {{first half}} of the debate was a {{directed}} question-and-answer session, with candidates questioned while standing <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>podiums,</b> as in <b>the</b> first debate, responding to questions from Fahey and Spradling. Participating candidates were Obama, Edwards, Clinton, Kucinich, Gravel, Dodd, Richardson and R. Biden, Jr.|$|R
5|$|A. Alberto Contador was {{the winner}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>podium</b> {{ceremony}} in Milan {{on the last day}} of the 2011 Giro d'Italia, but was subsequently found to have tested positive for performing-enhancing drugs on a rest day in the 2010 Tour de France. He was originally suspended on 25 January 2011 for a year, but appealed the decision. The Court of Arbitration for Sport found him guilty of using clenbuterol during the race; thus his results since the 2010 Tour de France were taken away from him and he was stripped of the win on 6 February 2012.|$|E
5|$|Michael Schumacher won {{the race}} ahead of Larini and Häkkinen, giving him a maximum 30 points after 3 rounds of the 1994 Formula One season. It was the only podium finish of Larini's career, and the first of just two {{occasions}} when he scored world championship points. Karl Wendlinger rode back to the pits on Häkkinen's McLaren after Wendlinger's car broke down on the slowing-down lap. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>podium</b> ceremony, {{out of respect for}} Roland Ratzenberger, who had died the day before, no champagne was sprayed.|$|E
5|$|Out {{of respect}} for the seriously-injured Bianchi, the top three {{finishers}} did not spray champagne. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>podium</b> interviews, conducted by the 1992 World Champion Nigel Mansell, Hamilton said that it had been a difficult race weekend and his speed {{near the end of the}} race was reminiscent of the 2008 British Grand Prix. Rosberg called it a good weekend for his team, and congratulated Hamilton on the victory. Vettel said that he was lucky that the safety car came out, and was happy with his performance. At a later press conference, Hamilton said that he was confident in his car's balance when he passed Rosberg on lap 28, and saw no difference in the amount of standing water on the track when more heavy rain fell. Although Rosberg's car was set up similar to Hamilton's, he was unhappy with its balance and tried to adjust it during his pit stop. According to Vettel, the weather was borderline and his team decided to make a pit stop when it deteriorated.|$|E

25|$|The polls had Governor Cuomo up {{by as much}} as ten points {{going into}} the final two weeks, but they then narrowed at the end. He made an issue of Cuomo seeking a fourth term as {{governor}} and pledged to serve only two terms in office. Cuomo was helped late in the race by the endorsement of New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. In the end, Pataki narrowly defeated Cuomo in the general election. Many, including George Pataki himself, believe Howard Stern's endorsement of Pataki was a major reason for his win. As a result, Stern was present <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>podium</b> with Pataki during his inauguration.|$|E
25|$|Due to its {{distinctive}} shape, likened to a wineglass, the building stands {{out from the}} rest of the Admiralty waterfront buildings. Architects attribute the shape of the building to passive protection, its narrow stem with the protruding upper storeys, supposedly makes it difficult to climb or attack. It is also informally known as 'the upside-down Gin bottle due to its shape resembling a bottle of Gordon's Gin. The corner of the building <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>podium</b> level which faces east (towards Admiralty MTR station) used to be a chapel under British use of the barracks. There used to be a crucifix visible on the exterior—however, during external refurbishment (including replacing the 'Prince of Wales Building' inscription in English with its current name in Chinese), the cross was removed.|$|E

25|$|The {{meeting is}} held at 1 p.m. in the Chamber of the U.S. House of Representatives.

The vice president and the Speaker of the House sit <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>podium,</b> {{with the vice president}} in the seat of the Speaker of the House. Senate pages bring in the two mahogany boxes containing each state's certified vote and place them on tables in front of the senators and representatives. Each house appoints two tellers to count the vote (normally one member of each political party). Relevant portions of the Certificate of Vote are read for each state, in alphabetical order.|$|E
25|$|The {{order of}} {{speakers}} is given first to member states, then observer states and supranational bodies.

Speakers will be put on the list in the order of their request, with special consideration for ministers and other government officials of similar or higher rank. According to the rules in place for the General Debate, the statements should be in one of the United Nations official languages of Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian or Spanish, and will be translated by the United Nations translators. Each speaker is requested to provide 20 advance copies of their statements to the conference officers to facilitate translation and to be presented <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>podium.</b> Speeches are requested to be limited to five minutes, with seven minutes for supranational bodies.|$|E

The Spanish cycling federation found him guilty of using Erythropoietin during the race and stripped him of his title, awarding the win to Denis Menchov. [...] However, in 2012 Roberto Heras was reinstated as the 2005 Vuelta a España champion when Spain's supreme court ruled in favor of Heras, citing procedural violations relating to the storage and handling of the urine samples.|$|E
50|$|Three {{teams of}} two competed to win cash and prizes.

Each team had its own path, and the moving contestants started <b>at</b> <b>the</b> first monitor. The team in control was given a category {{and a list of}} six answers, and the answering contestant chose to play two, three, or four questions. If they answered all the questions correctly, their teammate gained the right to move one step ahead per question. An incorrect answer gave the next team in line a chance to steal control by answering the same question and any that followed it.|$|R

500|$|The 2008 Olympic Games {{have been}} {{generally}} {{accepted by the}} world's media as a logistical success. Many of the worst fears about the games failed to materialize: no terrorists struck Beijing; no athlete protested <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>podium</b> (though Swedish wrestler Ara Abrahamian tossed his bronze medal in disgust over judging), and the air quality – due largely to favorable weather patterns – was {{not as bad as}} many had feared beforehand despite being the worst in Olympics history. [...] Hopes that hosting the Games would lead to improvements in human rights protections and rule of law in China, however, went unfulfilled.|$|E
500|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>podium</b> {{ceremony}} {{following the}} race, Hamilton was booed by the crowd. In the podium interview, conducted by Spanish TV presenter Noemi de Miguel, he shrugged off the reaction, saying: [...] "That's not my problem, it's theirs." [...] Both Hamilton and Verstappen expressed delight at their result, while Räikkönen {{said that it}} had not been an easy day for the team, stressing that Ferrari had not achieved what they could have, since he felt that he could have overtaken Verstappen towards the end. Hamilton's win was the 250th victory by a British driver in Formula One and his first at the Spielberg circuit.|$|E
500|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>podium</b> ceremony, the {{interviews}} were conducted by Nigel Mansell, who had won the last race at the venue in 1992. Both Mercedes drivers complimented each other's driving, highlighting the atmosphere and the enthusiasm of the fans in Mexico. Valtteri Bottas thanked his team, {{saying that they were}} [...] "racing like a race-winning team". During the post-race press conference, Lewis Hamilton described it as [...] "one of the fun races for me", since {{he did not have to}} worry about points at that point. However, new frictions emerged at Mercedes as Hamilton later asserted that the team had favoured Rosberg over the weekend in order to [...] "keep him happy".|$|E

5|$|Much like had {{occurred}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> final <b>podium</b> celebrations for <b>the</b> 2009 Tour de France, the wrong national anthem was played for Contador.

500|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>podium</b> interview, {{conducted}} by former team owner Eddie Jordan, Rosberg hailed an [...] "amazing weekend" [...] for himself, {{saying that he}} was [...] "ecstatic" [...] about the victory, but refused to answer questions concerning the outcome of the World Championship. Second-placed Vettel praised the track and his team's effort in preparing the car after difficulties in Friday's free practice. Sergio Pérez emphasised his recovery after his gearbox penalty, which put him back five places on the starting grid and the satisfaction of overtaking Räikkönen on the last lap of the race. During the following press conference, Vettel expressed surprise at the fact that no safety car period had emerged {{over the course of the}} race.|$|E
500|$|Disney {{wanted to}} {{experiment}} in more sophisticated sound recording and reproduction techniques for Fantasia. [...] "Music emerging from one speaker {{behind the screen}} sounds thin, tinkly and strainy. We wanted to reproduce such beautiful masterpieces... so that audiences would {{feel as though they}} were standing <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>podium</b> with Stokowski". For the recording of The Sorcerer's Apprentice in January 1938, engineers at Disney collaborated with RCA Corporation for using multiple audio channels which allowed any desired dynamic balance to be achieved upon playback. The stage was altered acoustically with double plywood semi-circular partitions that separated the orchestra into five sections to increase reverberation. Though as the production of Fantasia developed, the setup used for The Sorcerer's Apprentice was abandoned for different multi-channel recording arrangements.|$|E
500|$|During the post-race press conference, Hamilton {{revealed}} {{the decision to}} pit him was made after he had voiced concern over the heat in his tyres, being under the false impression that his rivals behind had already made a pit stop for the softer compound. When asked whether he would have full confidence in the team's strategy decisions in the future, he answered [...] "yes". <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>podium</b> interviews, conducted by Martin Brundle, Rosberg admitted his victory [...] "was {{just a lot of}} luck" [...] and added that [...] "Lewis drove brilliantly and he would have also deserved the win for sure". Rosberg became the fourth driver overall, and the first since Ayrton Senna, to win the Monaco Grand Prix three times in a row.|$|E
