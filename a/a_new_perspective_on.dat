5|$|At a temple, which Meera visits as {{her daily}} ritual, Zeenat makes her first contact. Zeenat is {{too afraid to}} tell Meera {{the truth about the}} situation, and she does not reveal who she is or why she has come. Over a few weeks, they become good friends and spend most of the time together. Their {{friendship}} brings out the missing part in each of their personalities. In the process, Zeenat realizes helplessness; this is totally new to her forthright way of thinking. Meera, on the other hand, gets a glimpse of freedom; this brings her out of the shell of the traditions in her haveli and gives her <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>perspective</b> <b>on</b> her life.|$|E
5|$|Māori quickly adopted {{writing as}} a means of sharing ideas, and many of their oral stories and poems were {{converted}} to the written form. Most early English literature was obtained from Britain and {{it was not until the}} 1950s when local publishing outlets increased that New Zealand literature started to become widely known. Although still largely influenced by global trends (modernism) and events (the Great Depression), writers in the 1930s began to develop stories increasingly focused on their experiences in New Zealand. During this period literature changed from a journalistic activity to a more academic pursuit. Participation in the world wars gave some New Zealand writers <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>perspective</b> <b>on</b> New Zealand culture and with the post-war expansion of universities local literature flourished. Dunedin is a UNESCO City of Literature.|$|E
5|$|Over the 18th and 19th centuries, {{biological}} sciences such as botany and zoology became increasingly professional scientific disciplines. Lavoisier and other physical scientists began {{to connect the}} animate and inanimate worlds through physics and chemistry. Explorer-naturalists such as Alexander von Humboldt investigated the interaction between organisms and their environment, and the ways this relationship depends on geography—laying the foundations for biogeography, ecology and ethology. Naturalists began to reject essentialism and consider the importance of extinction and the mutability of species. Cell theory provided <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>perspective</b> <b>on</b> the fundamental basis of life. These developments, {{as well as the}} results from embryology and paleontology, were synthesized in Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. The end of the 19th century saw the fall of spontaneous generation {{and the rise of the}} germ theory of disease, though the mechanism of inheritance remained a mystery.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} themes of the novel is the comparison between European and American women, which James stresses through the great difference existing between Eugenia and the Wentworth ladies. Madame Münster is independent, modern, and displays hauteur. Gertrude and Charlotte lack this self-possession. For example, they tend to comply with their father's suggestions. When Mr. Wentworth tries to arrange a marriage between Mr. Brand and Gertrude to which she objects, it is difficult for her to clearly express her preference. The sisters spend most of their free time with the family, until the moment in which Gertrude discovers herself to be in love with Felix. Her love encourages her to take <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>perspective</b> <b>on</b> the world and to resist the presumptions of her family. She reacts against her father's decision regarding Mr. Brand, explaining that she will never marry a man she does not love. Instead, Gertrude will marry Felix and leave America.|$|E
25|$|The Kinsey {{scale has}} been praised for dismissing the dichotomous {{classification}} {{of sexual orientation}} and allowing for <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>perspective</b> <b>on</b> human sexuality. However, the scale has been criticized because {{it is still not}} a true continuum. Despite seven categories being able to provide a more accurate description of sexual orientation than a dichotomous scale it is still difficult to determine which category individuals should be assigned to. In a major study comparing sexual response in homosexual males and females, Masters and Johnson discuss the difficulty of assigning the Kinsey ratings to participants. Particularly, they found it difficult to determine the relative amount heterosexual and homosexual experience and response in a person's history when using the scale. They report finding it difficult to assign ratings 2-4 for individuals with a large number of heterosexual and homosexual experiences. When there are a substantial number of heterosexual and homosexual experiences in one's history it becomes difficult for that individual to be fully objective in assessing the relative amount of each.|$|E

On the other hand, Finite impulse response (FIR) neural networks belong to mathematically well underlaid and time reliably proved feedforward neural networks. In this paper we compare and evaluate predictive abilities of these two different approaches to architecture and training of neural networks. Each of the mentioned neural networks can perceive the time context, but different means of their architectures are employed. Both approaches were tested in laser fluctuations and Mackey-glass data prediction, whereby we have obtained interesting results and conclusions...|$|R

On his newfound perspective, Tarwater said, [...] "Missing the Olympics in 2008 was the best thing that's ever happened in my whole life... I would not have gone to Oxford; I would not have invested in my own personhood... being able to chase an Olympic dream is a gift... I made it a misery. [...] It doesn't have to be a misery."

500|$|Dumarçay {{together}} with Professor Thanikaimoni took soil samples in 1974 {{and again in}} 1977 from trial trenches that had been dug into the hill, {{as well as from}} the plain immediately to the south. These samples were later analysed by Thanikaimoni, who examined their pollen and spore content to identify the type of vegetation that had grown in the area around the time of Borobudur's construction. They were unable to discover any pollen or spore samples that were characteristic of any vegetation known to grow in an aquatic environment such as a lake, pond or marsh. The area surrounding Borobudur appears to have been surrounded by agricultural land and palm trees at the time of the monument's construction, as is still the case today. Caesar Voûte and the geomorphologist Dr J.J.
