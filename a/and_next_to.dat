5|$|M-183 is a north–south state {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the Upper Peninsula of the US state of Michigan. It serves Fayette State Park as an access route from US Highway 2 (US2). The highway runs through rural farmlands of the Garden Peninsula <b>and</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> Big Bay de Noc, a bay of Lake Michigan. The community at Fayette {{dates back to}} the 1860s. It has been a state park since the late 1950s, and the connecting road has been a state highway since the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Edward II was a {{weak and}} ineffectual king (made {{to look the}} more so by {{comparison}} {{with his father and}} son, Edward I and Edward III), and his reign was marked by military failure and internal strife. A great number of the barony turned against the King, and the leader of the opposition eventually became Thomas of Lancaster. Lancaster was Edward's cousin, <b>and</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> the King he was the richest man in the country. Through a set of regulations known as the Ordinances, Lancaster and his associates had been trying to put restrictions on royal authority, but by the late 1310s Edward was again in full control of central government. The situation was aggravated by the King's ostentatious patronage of his favourite, Hugh Despenser, and Hugh's father by the same name.|$|E
5|$|From Seattle, SR520 crosses Lake Washington on the tolled Evergreen Point Floating Bridge; at , it is {{the longest}} {{floating}} bridge in the world. Tolls are collected electronically using the state's Good to Go pass or by mail, and vary based on time of day and number of axles; the minimum Good to Go toll, , is $1.25 between midnight and 5a.m., and the maximum is $4.30 during the morning and evening peak periods. The freeway reaches {{the eastern end of}} Lake Washington at Evergreen Point in northern Medina, where it travels under a lidded park <b>and</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> a median-side bus station. After an interchange and lid at 84th Avenue Northeast in Hunts Point, SR520 travels eastward around the northern edge of Clyde Hill in a north-facing arc, passing through the Yarrow Point lid and bus station. The freeway enters Bellevue, intersecting I-405 and crossing over the Eastside Rail Corridor. SR520 continues along {{the north side of the}} Bel-Red industrial area and enters the Overlake area of Redmond.|$|E

5|$|Heazlewood {{speculated that}} the later 1865 church was {{probably}} used for classes due {{the small size of}} the wooden school building. The school grew to around 100 pupils on the register in 1900. The church building, also used for Wesleyen Sunday school, was used as a school until 1929. For this period the Education Department rented it from the Church trustees. A new school was built, on donated land, opposite the church <b>and</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> the recreation ground. This state school was opened in a ceremony on 23 August 1929. The school remained open as late as the end of 1954.|$|E
5|$|Scully {{does the}} autopsy on the {{invisible}} body by covering it in powder. Mulder, meanwhile, researches {{the owner of}} the container. He learns that the man in the picture was extremely wealthy and lucky for a short period, before he died with a giant oversized penis. Mulder believes the woman in the picture is responsible for everything, and determines she is a jinniyah, or a female jinn. Mulder goes to the Stokes residence and asks Leslie to hand her over, presuming her to be kept in a box. It turns out, however, that she is not in the box, but back in the storage facility, where Mulder also finds pictures of the jinniyah next to Benito Mussolini in the 1930s <b>and</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> Richard Nixon in the 1960s, two men that had a lot of power and lost it in a bad way.|$|E
5|$|The Main Stand covers {{approximately}} {{two thirds of}} the length of the pitch, though the attached enclosure is longer, covering the whole distance. The Main Stand, which seats 4,277 fans, also contains the dressing rooms, club offices and television gantry, {{as well as a number}} of supporting pillars, a car park and the Nick Owen and Eric Morecambe suites. To the Main Stand's right, in the corner above the end of the enclosure <b>and</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> the Kenilworth Stand, is the David Preece Stand, a family area which seats 711 spectators. The David Preece Stand acquired its present name in 2008, a year after the former player's death.|$|E

5|$|The Tower House is on {{a corner}} of Melbury Road, just north of Kensington High Street, in the {{district}} of Holland Park. It stands opposite Stavordvale Lodge <b>and</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> Woodland House, built for the artist Luke Fildes. The development of Melbury Road in the grounds of Little Holland House created an art colony in Holland Park, the Holland Park Circle. Its most prominent member, Frederic, Lord Leighton, lived at Leighton House, 12 Holland Park Road, and at the time of Leighton's death in 1896 six Royal Academicians, as well as one associate member, were living in Holland Park Road and Melbury Road.|$|E
5|$|The hull {{had four}} levels {{separated}} by three decks. The terminology for {{these in the}} 16th century was still not standardised so the terms used here are those that were applied by the Mary Rose Trust. The hold lay furthest down in the ship, right above the bottom planking below the waterline. This is where the kitchen, or galley, was situated and the food was cooked. Directly aft of the galley was the mast step, a rebate in the centre-most timber of the keelson, right above the keel, which supported the main mast, <b>and</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> it the main bilge pump. To increase {{the stability of the}} ship, the hold was where the ballast was placed and much of the supplies were kept. Right above the hold was the orlop, the lowest deck. Like the hold it was partitioned and was also used as a storage area for everything from food to spare sails.|$|E
5|$|Artists Mike Marsicano and Kurt Bickenbach played {{critical}} {{roles in}} the creation of the game's aircraft models, which were built in 3D Studio. As reference material, the team photographed real planes at several airfields, and they received blueprints and datasheets from aircraft manufacturers. The game's Grob G103a Twin II sailplane was based directly on the one that Blackley owned at the time. The sophistication of the real-time CFDs complicated the 3D modeling process, as the planes required accurate geometry to fly properly. While attempting to meet this goal, however, Bickenbach said that the models he created were overly detailed, which caused the team to struggle with performance issues related to the high number of polygons. Reducing the number altered the plane's shape, which in turn reduced its flight realism; this necessitated a balance between performance and accuracy. To obtain audio for the planes, Greg LoPiccolo and Tom Streit—former bassist and road manager, respectively, of the band Tribe—visited a Florida importer of Russian aerobatic aircraft. The two placed microphones inside the cockpits <b>and</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> the engines, and they flew each plane at multiple speeds while recording with a digital audio tape machine. Combining this material with digital recordings of wind sounds, the team fashioned a physics-based sound system: sounds of the wind and engine are altered in real-time based on wind speed in the game.|$|E
