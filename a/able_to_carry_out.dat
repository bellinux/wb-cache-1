5|$|While {{induction}} {{entails the}} transient activation of CaMKII and PKC, maintenance of E-LTP (early-form LTP) {{is characterized by}} their persistent activation.

In 1787, they moved to Hampstead, where Rochemont was asked to serve as the minister at what later became Rosslyn Hill Unitarian Chapel. It was here that Barbauld became close friends with Joanna Baillie, the playwright. Although no longer in charge of a school, the Barbaulds did not abandon their commitment to education; they often had one or two pupils living with them, who had been recommended by personal friends.|$|E

Scheer proposed a more aggressive policy designed to force a confrontation with the British Grand Fleet; he received approval from the Kaiser in February.

40|$|Protein {{includes}} many substances, such as enzymes, hormones and antibodies {{that are necessary}} for the organisms. Living cells are controlled by proteins and genes that interact through complex molecular pathways to achieve a specific function.

The importance of understanding protein structure has fueled the development of protein structure databases and prediction tools. Computational methods which were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> predict protein structure for the determination of protein function efficiently and accurately are in high demand.

5|$|By 2000, {{the city}} of Sacramento {{maintained}} the non-freeway portion of SR 160 within the city limits under a contract with Caltrans. However, since Caltrans's main goal is to move traffic efficiently, the city was not <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> pedestrian-friendly projects that they and local residents wanted. Under a law passed in July 1999, Caltrans was authorized to relinquish any part of Route 160 within the city limits to Sacramento. The two agencies agreed, and on October 19, 2000 the portion from the south city limits to the American River became the full responsibility of the city. A 2003 amendment to the Streets and Highways Code erroneously deleted not only this part, but the North Sacramento Freeway as well.|$|E

5|$|The overall {{gameplay}} received mixed reviews. Some critics {{believed that}} the gameplay was enjoyable, serviceable and acceptable by modern standards, but most others agreed {{that some of the}} gameplay mechanics, such as the cover system, lacked polish and were flawed. Some critics considered the gameplay generic due to its inclusion of typical shooter elements such as on-rail and turret segments, and stated that such mechanics are unable to help the game differentiate itself from other shooters such as Gears of War, and give the game an identity crisis. Some critics lamented that gameplay occasionally disconnects players from the story, creating tonal dissonance. Many criticized the game for not having a roll mechanic. The artificial intelligence system was criticized for not being strong enough to make the game more gratifying, though some critics thought that the AI system for Adams and Lugo was well-crafted and did not suffer from severe or frequent technical problems, although they may not be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> player's commands. Some critics criticized the game's low replay value, unbalanced difficulty level, and sudden difficulty spike.|$|E
5|$|On 23–24 October, the High Seas Fleet {{undertook}} {{its last}} major offensive operation {{under the command}} of von Pohl, though it ended without contact with British forces. By January 1916 hepatic cancer had weakened von Pohl {{to the point where he}} was no longer <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> his duties, and he was replaced by Vice Admiral Reinhard Scheer in January. Scheer proposed a more aggressive policy designed to force a confrontation with the British Grand Fleet; he received approval from the Kaiser in February. Scheer's first operation was a sweep into the North Sea on 5–7 March, followed by two more on 21–22 March and 25–26 March. During Scheer's next operation, Thüringen supported a raid on the English coast on 24 April 1916 conducted by the German battlecruiser force. The battlecruisers left the Jade Estuary at 10:55 and the rest of the High Seas Fleet followed at 13:40. The battlecruiser Seydlitz struck a mine while en route to the target, and had to withdraw. The other battlecruisers bombarded the town of Lowestoft unopposed, but during the approach to Yarmouth, they encountered the British cruisers of the Harwich Force. A short gun duel ensued before the Harwich Force withdrew. Reports of British submarines in the area prompted the retreat of the IScouting Group. At this point, Scheer, who had been warned of the sortie of the Grand Fleet from its base in Scapa Flow, also withdrew to safer German waters.|$|E

30|$|For farmers <b>to</b> be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> decide <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> {{long-term}} investment on their farmland, {{they need the}} security of tenure.

This means farmers’ feeling about the land belongs to them will have a positive effect on their decision to participate in watershed management programs. Therefore, in this study, it is hypothesized that land tenure security is positively correlated with the farmers’ decision to participate in watershed management programs.|$|R
