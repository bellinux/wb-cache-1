5|$|In 1869, Grant was {{urged by}} popular opinion to support rebels in Cuba with {{military}} assistance {{and to give}} them U.S. diplomatic recognition. Grant <b>and</b> <b>Fish</b> instead attempted to use arbitration with Spain with minister Daniel Sickles negotiating. Grant <b>and</b> <b>Fish</b> wanted Cuban independence and to end slavery without U.S. military intervention or occupation. Fish, diligently and against popular pressure, {{was able to keep}} Grant from officially recognizing Cuban independence because it would have endangered negotiations with Britain over the Alabama Claims. The Sickle's peace negotiations failed in Madrid, but Grant <b>and</b> <b>Fish</b> did not succumb to popular pressure for U.S. military involvement in the Cuban rebellion. Grant <b>and</b> <b>Fish</b> sent a message to Congress, written by Fish and signed by Grant. The message urged strict neutrality not to officially recognize the Cuban revolt, calming national fears.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} species of shrimp <b>and</b> <b>fish</b> take refuge among the {{branches}} of Millepora alcicornis, seemingly immune to the venom. Hawkfish in particular often perch {{on top of the}} fire coral, perhaps protected by their skinless pectoral fins. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Millepora alcicornis has few predators. The fireworm (Hermodice carunculata) sometimes grazes on it, but prefers other corals. Certain nudibranchs in the genus Phyllidia eat it as do filefish in the family Monacanthidae.|$|E

5|$|Hindu {{philosopher and}} saint Adi Shankara (c. 8th century) is {{believed}} to have established Govardhana matha in Puri, with Vimala as its presiding goddess. According to Starza (author of The Jagannatha Temple at Puri), the Jagannath Temple was once a centre of worship for the Trimurti of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva, along with their consorts and the three central forms of the Hindu Goddess, Sarasvati, Lakshmi and Parvati (in the form of Vimala). The Shri Vidya sect devoted to Goddess worship was strong here until the 17th century. Slowly, Shri Vidya and Shiva-centric Shaiva traditions were eroded but remnants continue, with the Vishnu-centric Vaishnavism becoming the sole tradition. The Tantric Panchamakara, which includes fish, meat, liquor, parched grain and ritual intercourse, were replaced with vegetarian offerings and dance of devdasis. Fish was caught locally and offered to the goddess. King Narasimhadeva, who ruled between 1623â€“47, ended the meat <b>and</b> <b>fish</b> offerings of the goddess, although the tradition was later partly revitalized. Today, the goddess is offered meat <b>and</b> <b>fish</b> on special days.|$|E
