5|$|Despite {{the heavy}} workload—Hay {{wrote that he}} was busy 20 hours a day—he tried to make as normal <b>a</b> <b>life</b> <b>as</b> possible, eating his meals with Nicolay at Willard's Hotel, going to the theatre with Abraham and Mary Todd Lincoln, and reading Les Misérables in French. Hay, still in his early 20s, spent time both in barrooms and at cultured get-togethers {{in the homes of}} Washington's elite. The two {{secretaries}} often clashed with Mary Lincoln, who resorted to various stratagems to get the dilapidated White House restored without depleting Lincoln's salary, which had to cover entertainment and other expenses. Despite the secretaries' objections, Mrs. Lincoln was generally the victor and managed to spend almost 70% of her husband's salary in his four years in office.|$|E

The next chapter moves back in the novel's timeline, focusing on Munira's move to Ilmorog, to begin work as a teacher.

25|$|Men {{and women}} born in Western countries, who become Buddhists as adults, wish to become monks or nuns. It is possible, {{and one can}} live as a monk or nun in the country they were born in, seek monks or nuns which has {{gathered}} in a different Western country or move to a monastery in countries like Sri Lanka or Thailand. It is seen as being easier to live <b>a</b> <b>life</b> <b>as</b> a monk or nun in countries where people generally live by the culture of Buddhism, since {{it is difficult to}} live by the rules of a monk or a nun in a Western country. For instance; a Theravāda monk or nun is not allowed to work, handle money, listen to music, cook and so on, which are extremely difficult rules to live by in cultures which do not embrace Buddhism.|$|E

25|$|After the Delegatura Sił Zbrojnych na Kraj ("Armed Forces Delegation for Homeland") was disbanded, another post-AK {{resistance}} organisation was formed, called Wolność i Niezawisłość ("Freedom and Sovereignty"). Its {{primary goal}} was not combat - Wolność i Niezawisłość (WiN) {{was more concerned}} with helping former AK soldiers {{make the transition from}} <b>a</b> <b>life</b> <b>as</b> partisans to that of civilians. Continued secrecy and conspiracy were necessary in light of the increasing persecution of AK veterans by the communist government. WiN was, however, much in need of funds to pay for false documents and to provide resources for the partisans, many of whom had lost their homes and entire life-savings in the war. Viewed as enemies of the state, starved of resources, and with a vocal faction advocating armed resistance against the Soviets and their Polish proxies, WiN was far from efficient. A significant victory for the NKVD and the newly created Polish secret police, Urząd Bezpieczeństwa (UB), came {{in the second half of}} 1945, when they managed to convince several leaders of WiN that they truly wanted to offer amnesty to AK members. Within a few months, intelligence gathered by the authorities led to thousands more arrests. The primary period of WiN activity lasted until 1947. The organisation finally disbanded in 1952.|$|E
500|$|Nicolas Sammond {{argues that}} the film is [...] "an apt metaphor for the metaphysics of midcentury American child-rearing" [...] and that the film is [...] "ultimately an assimilationist fable".
