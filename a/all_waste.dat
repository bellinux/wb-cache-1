5|$|The {{municipality}} {{aims for}} a coherent and holistic {{administration of the}} water cycle to protect against or clean up previous pollution and encourage green growth and self-sufficiency. The main issues are excessive nutrients, adapting to increasing levels of precipitation brought on by climate change, and securing the water supply. These goals have manifested {{in a number of}} large water treatment projects often in collaboration with private partners. In the 2000s, underground rainwater basins were built across the city while the two lakes Årslev Engsø and Egå Engsø were created in 2003 and 2006 respectively. The number of sewage treatment plants is planned to be reduced from 17 to 2 by 2025 as the treatment plants in Marselisborg and Egå are scheduled for expansion to take over <b>all</b> <b>waste</b> water treatment. They have already been refitted for biogas production to become net producers of electricity and heat. To aid the new treatment plants, and avoid floodings, sewage and stormwater throughout the municipality is planned to be separated into two different drainage systems. Construction began in 2017 in several areas, but it is a long process and is scheduled to be finished by 2085.|$|E

The bowel resection with colostomy implies a temporary colostomy which is followed by a second operation to reverse the colostomy. The surgeon makes an opening in the abdominal wall (a colostomy) which helps clear the infection and inflammation. The colon is brought through the opening and <b>all</b> <b>waste</b> is collected in an external bag.|$|E

25|$|The {{performance}} of a flush-toilet may be rated by a Maximum Performance (MaP) score. The low end of MaP scores is 250 (250grams of simulated fecal matter). The high end of MaP scores is 1000. A toilet with a MaP score of 1000 should provide trouble-free service. It should remove <b>all</b> <b>waste</b> with a single flush; it should not plug; it should not harbor any odor; it should be easy to keep clean. The United States Environmental Protection Agency uses a MaP score of 350 as the minimum performance threshold for HETs. 1.6 gpf toilets are also sometimes referred as ULF (Ultra Low Flow) toilets.|$|E

A major Waste Recovery Facility was opened in 2013, which allows <b>all</b> <b>waste</b> and recycled material to be sorted and sorted under one roof. In 2012 Port Pirie Regional Council completed a $5m Community Water Recycling project with Nyrstar which allows 350ML of water to be reused from the smelter. Plans are underway to establish a large shopping complex in the city with an additional supermarket and department store. The city's population is continually growing and property prices continue to rise. The Port Pirie Regional Council has a number of large projects that will be launched or completed next financial year.|$|E
25|$|Modelling a {{possible}} future economic system for mankind, Robert Ayres has countered Georgescu's {{position on the}} impossibility of complete and perpetual recycling of material resources. According to Ayres, {{it is possible to}} develop what he conceptualises as a 'spaceship economy' on Earth on a stable and permanent basis, provided that a sufficient flow of energy is available to support it (for example, by an ample supply of solar energy). In this spaceship economy, <b>all</b> <b>waste</b> materials will be temporarily discarded and stored in inactive reservoirs — or what he calls 'waste baskets' — before being recycled and returned to active use in the economic system at some later point in time. It will not be necessary, or even possible, for materials recycling to form its own separate and continuous flow to be of use — only, the waste baskets in question have to be large enough to compensate for the rate and the efficiency of the recycling effort. In effect, complete and perpetual recycling of material resources will be possible in a future spaceship economy of this kind specified, thereby rendering obsolete Georgescu's proposed fourth law of thermodynamics, Ayres submits. In a later article, Ayres restated his case for a spaceship economy.|$|E

There is no Instrument landing System - ILS, instead visual flight rules - VFR apply. There are no buildings or structures at the runway, although some services are provided from the research station. Ground handling, including supply of Jet A-1 fuel, is provided by the crew at Troll. The crew also supply services such as a fire and rescue service, communications and overnighting at Troll for personnel who would be stuck because of bad weather. The airfield must follow the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. This includes storing all fuel in barrels and large tanks placed on special mats which absorb liquids, to avoid spills. There is also equipment and plans to handle spills, should they occur. <b>All</b> <b>waste</b> is transported out of the Antarctic.|$|E
