5|$|Half-Life 2 is {{a science}} fiction first-person shooter game and the sequel to Half-Life. While {{remaining}} similar in style to the original, Half-Life 2 introduces new concepts to the series such as physics-based puzzles and vehicle sections. The game {{takes place in the}} fictional City 17 and surrounding areas as the player takes on the role of scientist Gordon Freeman.

In his struggle, he is joined by various acquaintances, including former Black Mesa colleagues, oppressed citizens of City 17, and the Vortigaunts, all of whom later prove to be valuable allies. Half-Life 2 received critical acclaim, including 35 Game of the Year awards, when it was originally released for Windows in 2004.

5|$|Since the FairTax {{would not}} tax used goods, {{some critics have}} argued that this would create a {{differential}} between the price of new and used goods, which may take years to equalize. Such a differential would certainly influence the sale of new goods like vehicles and homes. Similarly, some supporters have claimed that this would create an incentive to buy used goods, creating environmental benefits of re-use and re-sale. Conversely, {{it is argued that}} like the income tax system that contains embedded tax cost (see Theories of retail pricing), used goods would contain the embedded FairTax cost. While the FairTax would not be applied to the retail sales of used goods, the inherent value of a used good includes the taxes paid when the good was sold <b>at</b> <b>retail.</b> The value is determined by the supply and demand in relation to new goods. The price differential / margins between used and new goods should stay consistent, as the cost and value of used goods are in direct relationship to the cost and value of the new goods.|$|E
5|$|Xbox One {{games are}} {{distributed}} <b>at</b> <b>retail</b> on Blu-ray Disc, and digitally as downloads through Xbox Games Store.

Updates to games and system software are also downloaded in the background and while in standby. If the game is installed from physical media, the disc is still required for validation purposes. If the game is installed on another console, and that console owner no longer has access to the disc, the owner has the option of unlocking the install on their hard drive by purchasing it through Xbox Live; the installed game then acts as a game installed on the hard drive. An active internet connection may be required for some games, particularly those that rely on server-side processing..|$|E
