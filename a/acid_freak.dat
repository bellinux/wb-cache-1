2500|$|Two theater troupes, The Cockettes and the Angels of Light, {{formed in}} San Francisco {{in the late}} 1960s and focused their {{entertainment}} on mocking popular culture through drag, embracing drugs, and free sex in the counterculture of the 1960s. The Cockettes performed regularly at the Palace Theater in the city's North Beach district {{as part of the}} late-night [...] "Nocturnal Emissions" [...] series and developed a strong following that would also dress in drag and ascribe to recreational drug use at their shows. One of their more high profile performances was a parodic recreation of the 1971 wedding of Tricia Nixon—President Nixon's daughter—and Edward F. Cox, both characters of course played by men in women's clothes. Director John Waters called the Cockettes [...] "hippie <b>acid</b> <b>freak</b> drag queens", whose first non-San Francisco appearance was at a New York City show with an audience full of celebrities who reacted with complete confusion to the performance. With their rising success came philosophical differences with The Angels of Light who broke off to present free shows, but who similarly employed drag and theater to satirize issues of gender and morality. The Angels of Light first appeared in a mock nativity scene at Grace Cathedral's Christmas Eve midnight mass in 1970. Both groups employed a sense of high camp: outrageous scenes and sets, fantastic costumes, movie references and bad puns, and intentionally bad acting combined with deliberately bad drag, which diverted from previous female impersonators whose mark of quality was realism.|$|E
5000|$|As {{lead singer}} of The Faint, (formerly Norman Bailer), Fink has {{expanded}} his musical repertoire from the Comm Venus, Park Ave. reminiscent [...] "Media" [...] to the more mature, <b>acid</b> <b>freak</b> out records [...] "Blank-Wave Arcade" [...] and [...] "Danse Macabre" [...] to the slightly mellowed [...] "Wet from Birth". With Fink in The Faint is his brother Clark Baechle on drums Jacob Thiele on synth; Joel Peterson on bass; and the mysterious [...] "Dapose" [...] on guitar (Dapose joined the band during the recording of Danse Macabre).|$|E
50|$|The band, {{originally}} called Roger and Wendy, {{was formed}} in the late 1960s in Greenwich Village, typically playing in pass-the-basket-for-tips coffeehouses and folk clubs, such as Gerde's Folk City, (where they headlined for 33 weeks in one year,1970, setting a club record); the Cafe Wha?, the Bitter End, the Cafe Au Go Go, The Gaslight Cafe, The Freudian Slip, The Basement Cafe, and Kenny's Castaways. Performing at first without microphones (as basket houses had no cabaret licenses, thus amplified vocals were illegal), they developed an energized psychedelic folk style with just an electrified autoharp and fast-pulse bass guitar. Their music quickly evolved from traditional ballads to electric folk, including psychedelic folk, <b>acid</b> <b>freak</b> folk and rock.|$|E
5000|$|The New York Times critic John J. O'Connor called Wild Palms a [...] "truly wild six-hour mini-series" [...] {{resembling}} [...] "nothing {{so much as}} an <b>acid</b> <b>freak's</b> fantasy, {{drenched in}} paranoia and more pop-culture allusions than a Dennis Miller monologue." [...] He described it as [...] "rich and insinuating as a good theatrical film, albeit harder to follow" [...] and concluded, [...] "You wanted something different? Here it is. And Wild Palms also happens to be terrific." ...|$|R
5000|$|... 'We are all wired into a {{survival}} trip now. No {{more of the}} speed that fueled that '60s. That was the fatal flaw in Tim Leary's trip. He crashed around America selling [...] "consciousness expansion" [...] without ever giving a thought to the grim meat-hook realities that were lying in wait {{for all the people}} who took him seriously... All those pathetically eager <b>acid</b> <b>freaks</b> who thought they could buy Peace and Understanding for three bucks a hit. But their loss and failure is ours too. What Leary took down with him was the central illusion of a whole life-style that he helped create... a generation of permanent cripples, failed seekers, who never understood the essential old-mystic fallacy of the Acid Culture: the desperate assumption that somebody... or at least some force - is tending {{the light at the end}} of the tunnel'.|$|R
50|$|Psychedelic folk (sometimes <b>acid</b> folk or <b>freak</b> folk) is a loosely defined form of psychedelia that {{originated}} in the 1960s. It retains the largely acoustic instrumentation of folk, but adds musical influences common to psychedelic music.|$|R
