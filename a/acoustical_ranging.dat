500|$|At 8:05 am, as Missouri sailed past Fort Wool, Captain Brown turned {{control of}} the ship (known in naval terms as the [...] "conn" [...] of the ship) over to the officer of the deck and {{departed}} for the chart house. His arrival at the chart house caused Ensign E. R. Harris, who had been tracking the battleship's course on the chart, {{to move away from}} the table, resulting in the interruption of the plot. Around the same time Captain Brown informed Commander Peckham that Missouri would soon run an <b>acoustical</b> <b>range.</b> This was the first time that the executive officer had heard about a planned <b>acoustical</b> <b>range</b> run.|$|R
500|$|Around {{the same}} time, Lieutenant Arnold located a small buoy with orange-and-white stripes [...] away. Initially this buoy was {{identified}} {{as one of the}} <b>acoustical</b> <b>range</b> markers {{as a result of the}} letter [...] "B" [...] painted on it, but this information was not properly relayed to the rest of the crew. Mistakenly believing that this was the marker for the right side of the range, both Captain Brown and the battleship's operation's officer agreed to order the battleship to pass to the left of the marker. By then Missouri was sailing for the danger line marking the separation between the deep water of the channel into the shallow water of the shoals. This was made apparent when a pair of spar buoys marking the entrance to a shallow fishing channel appeared ahead of Missouri. Brown incorrectly identified these markers as the end of the <b>acoustical</b> <b>range,</b> but several of the quartermasters, as well as Commander Peckham, Lieutenant Arnold, and other officers knew this was an incorrect assumption. It was at this point the first recommendation to turn right was made by Morris, the navigator; Brown declined because of his mistaken belief that the markers for the fish channel were actually the end of the <b>acoustical</b> <b>range.</b> A similar recommendation from Commander Peckham also went unheeded.|$|R
500|$|Approximately {{two minutes}} after departing for the chart room, Captain Brown reemerged {{on the open}} bridge and reassumed the conn of the battleship. He summoned Lieutenants Hatfield and Arnold, Missouris morning and forenoon {{officers}} of the watch, respectively, and informed them of the planned run through the <b>acoustical</b> <b>range.</b> As with Commander Peckham, {{this was the first}} time that either of these two men had heard anything about the planned acoustical test run. When Captain Brown noted their confused looks, he promptly informed the men to [...] "Go get yourselves informed", at which point both officers reported to the chart room on level eight. There they learned of the impending run through the <b>acoustical</b> <b>range</b> by looking at the chart with the buoys marking the range; despite this, both remained confused over aspects of the planned run.|$|R

Moreover, the method exploits actively the connectivity {{information provided by the}} range map, by using reverse projection as acceleration technique. Therefore, the method is able to produce, starting from raw range data, meaningful segmented clouds of points in a fully automatic and efficient fashion. 1...|$|R

40|$|International audienceRecent {{work has}} shown that limb motor {{learning}} is accompanied by alterations in perception. For instance, learned compensation for perturbations of reaching movements is associated with changes in the sensed position of the limb (Ostry et al. 2010), changes in evoked potentials from cortical sensory areas (Nasir et al. 2013), and changes in functional connectivity between sensory and motor networks (Vahdat et al. 2011). Motor learning, it seems, involves both changes in motor commands and changes in perception. A recent study showed a similar result {{in the context of}} speech (Shiller et al. 2009), and here we test this idea further. In the experiments, speech motor learning was induced by creating a sensorimotor mismatch: an acoustical effects processor was used to alter the sound of the voice in real-time. In one condition subjects repeated "head" but heard themselves producing "had"; in a second condition subjects repeated "head" but heard themselves producing "hid". With training, learned compensation was observed that cancelled out the perceived alteration. Speech perception was assessed before and after speech motor learning using a series of perceptual tests designed to measure the distinction between the words "head", "had", and "hid". Consistent changes in speech perception were observed following learning, but only when speech motor learning drove what subjects produced [...] not what they perceived themselves producing [...] into the <b>acoustical</b> <b>range</b> of the perceptual tests.

Thesis (Master's) [...] Bilkent University, 2013. Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 57 - 58. Performance {{of direct}} sequence spread spectrum modulation (DSSS) in underwater <b>acoustical</b> <b>range</b> finding is investigated in this thesis. Range estimation using low power DSSS codes is both analyzed theoretically and implemented at 400 kHz for experimental assessment, where the chip duration is 20 µs and sequence type is maximal. The effect of sequence length on the required transmit power is measured for sequence lengths from 7 chips to 127 chips. The performance {{of this method}} is compared to the widely used tone burst pulse range estimation technique. It is found that at a sequence of 127 chips and a pulse sequence length of 2, 54 ms, range is estimated with 1, 5 cm resolution using source level of 132, 8 dB re 1 µP arms @ 1 m source level, while it is 190, 5 cm for the same length and magnitude tone burst modulation, at a reference test range of 4. 5 m. Moreover, spectral height of received DSSS signal is well below the ambient noise level so that {{signal to noise ratio}} (SNR) for received DSSS signal is - 14, 8 dB, while it is 12, 2 dB for received tone burst pulseGüleryüz, Mustafa OzanM.

The purpose of our study was to compare the pre- and posttreatment voice assessment scores in patients treated by CO(2) laser-assisted freeing of the scar followed by collagen injection. A group of 12 patients (10 women and 2 men) with vocal fold scars was studied retrospectively. Voice assessment was based on stroboscopy and on perceptual scores using the Grade (G) of the GRABS scale, subjective evaluation by the use of the Voice Handicap Index (VHI), aerodynamic measurements [maximum phonation time (MPT) and phonation quotient (PQ) ], and <b>acoustical</b> measurements (frequency <b>range</b> and low intensity). Stroboscopy showed an improvement on the mucosal vocal fold wave and on the glottic competence. The mean VHI was improved from 63. 16 to 45. 5; G from 2 to 1. 41; MPT from 7. 05 to 8. 62 s; and PQ from 463. 02 to 358. 54 ml/s.

Ab initio plane-wave pseudopotential {{calculations}} of electronic and vibrational properties have been carried out for the ternary phosphides BaM 2 P 2 (M=Ni,Rha and Ir) with a ThCr 2 Si 2 -type structure. The calculated electronic results show the metallic character of BaM 2 P 2, and the plots of total and partial density of states of BaM 2 P 2 exhibit strong hybridization between the d states of the M atom and the p states of the P atom below the Fermi energy. Differences in the phonon spectrum and density of states both in the <b>acoustical</b> and optical <b>ranges</b> for these compounds are presented and discussed. The Eliashberg spectral function for these compounds has been calculated by using a linear response approach based on the density functional theory. By integrating the Eliashberg spectral function, the average electron-phonon coupling parameter (λ) is determined to be 0. 61 for BaNi 2 P 2, 0. 55 for BaIr 2 P 2, and 0. 43 for BaRh 2 P 2. Using the calculated values of λ and the logarithmically averaged phonon frequency ωln the superconducting critical temperature (Tc) values for BaNi 2 P 2,BaIr 2 P 2, and BaRh 2 P 2 are obtained to be 2. 80, 1. 97, and 0. 70 K, respectively, which compare very well with their experimental values of 3. 0, 2. 1, and 1. 0 K.

40|$|Allting Runt Omkring (Everything Round and About) {{grew out}} of my {{encounters}} with the Stockholm soundscape, which surprised me with its clarity and vitality — both {{above and below the}} ground… the chimes of church clocks audible across very large distances… the tunnelbana (subway) with its caverns hewn out of granite, where even quiet shuffles of feet are etched with clarity… skaters on the open air ice rink… footsteps on granite stairs and creaking floors. Along with these I integrated a number of field recordings made in my own country… a fairground, with ghost train and house of mirrors… wind gently resonating a flagpole… I found many of these sounds so captivating that I realized I was carrying impressions of them in my head, and frequently imagining the presence of one sound ‘inside’ another as I was hearing them (both {{in and out of the}} studio). Allting Runt Omkring attempts to project some of that sensation by creating a new context in which field recordings from the natural world are integrated and transformed. All sound sources in the work are environmental in origin. I work exclusively with my own field recordings, since for me it is important to have a connection with the original context of my sound sources. In this piece the context in which sounds are heard and shaped was an important stimulus, while the tape medium allows me to forge new contextual relationships for the sound. For example, in Stockholm there are a large number of churches and public buildings in the main city area, especially Gamla Stan (the old town), but also across to the islands of Kungsholmen and Söder. At quarter hour intervals the clocks of Stockholm chime, and from a single vantage point one can hear an astonishing depth in the soundscape. The Stockholm tunnelbana also has a great <b>acoustical</b> presence and <b>range</b> of sounds, and in this piece I have tried to fuse sounds of ‘above’ and ‘below’ ground (for instance by linking the bell resonances to the tunnelbana, or by taking the noise of trains to the ice rink).
