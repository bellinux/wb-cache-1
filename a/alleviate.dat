40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} the current {{investigation}} was to study the effect of Ca 2 + on the seed germination of coastal species like Arthrocnemum indicum, A. macrostachyum, Desmostachya bipinnata, Halopyrum mucronatum and Urochondra setulosa under NaCl salinity. Seed germination was inhibited with the increase in NaCl concentration and species differ in their range of NaCl tolerance. Inclusion of CaCl 2 partially or completely <b>alleviated</b> NaCl effects on the germination of all species. In the case of A. macrostachyum calcium application completely <b>alleviated</b> salinity effects at all concentrations of NaCl, while in the case of A. indicum and D. bipinnata calcium completely <b>alleviated</b> NaCl effects except at 800 mM NaCl. While in the case of H. mucronatum and U. setulosa Ca 2 + completely <b>alleviated</b> the NaCl effects at low concentration and partially <b>alleviated</b> at higher concentrations. 1...|$|R

Strengthening fibers were applied in PC to improve its mechanical properties, and the material obtained is called fiber reinforced polymer concrete (FRPC). The best parameter to estimate the vibration <b>alleviating</b> property is damping ratio. Orthogonal tests were carried out to prepare FRPC specimens with different fibers. How strengthening fibers affect vibration <b>alleviating</b> properties of FRPC was studies basing on the experiment results. 1...|$|R
