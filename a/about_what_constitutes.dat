5|$|Eris (68AU average) is {{the largest}} known {{scattered}} disc object, and caused a debate <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>constitutes</b> a planet, because it is 25% more massive than Pluto and about the same diameter. It is the most massive of the known dwarf planets. It has one known moon, Dysnomia. Like Pluto, its orbit is highly eccentric, with a perihelion of 38.2 AU (roughly Pluto's distance from the Sun) and an aphelion of 97.6 AU, and steeply inclined to the ecliptic plane.|$|E

25|$|While Ethical Culturists {{generally}} {{share common}} beliefs <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>constitutes</b> ethical {{behavior and the}} good, individuals are encouraged {{to develop their own}} personal understanding of these ideas. This does not mean that Ethical Culturists condone moral relativism, which would relegate ethics to mere preferences or social conventions. Ethical principles are viewed as being related to deep truths about the way the world works, and hence not arbitrary. However, it is recognized that complexities render the understanding of ethical nuances subject to continued dialogue, exploration, and learning.|$|E
25|$|However, with Jesus {{no longer}} {{regarded}} as the paradigm of gentile Christianity, Paul's position became more important in Jewish historical reconstructions of their religion's relationship with Christianity. He has featured {{as the key to}} building barriers (e.g. Heinrich Graetz and Martin Buber) or bridges (e.g. Isaac Mayer Wise and Claude G. Montefiore) in interfaith relations, as part of an intra-Jewish debate <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>constitutes</b> Jewish authenticity (e.g. Joseph Klausner and Hans Joachim Schoeps), and on occasion as a dialogical partner (e.g. Richard L.

25|$|Jewish {{interest}} in Paul {{is a recent}} phenomenon. Before the so-called Jewish reclamation of Jesus (as a Jew) in {{the eighteenth and nineteenth}} centuries, he had hardly featured in the popular Jewish imagination and little had been written about him by the religious leaders and scholars. Arguably, he is absent from the Talmud and rabbinical literature, although he makes an appearance in some variants of the medieval polemic Toledot Yeshu (as a spy for the rabbis). But with Jesus no longer regarded as the paradigm of gentile Christianity, Paul's position became more important in Jewish historical reconstructions of their religion's relationship with Christianity. He has featured as the key to building barriers (e.g. Heinrich Graetz and Martin Buber) or bridges (e.g. Isaac Mayer Wise and Claude G. Montefiore) in interfaith relations, as part of an intra-Jewish debate <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>constitutes</b> Jewish authenticity (e.g. Joseph Klausner and Hans Joachim Schoeps), and, on occasion, as a dialogical partner (e.g. Richard L. Rubenstein and Daniel Boyarin). He features in an oratorio (by Felix Mendelssohn), a painting (by Ludwig Meidner) and a play (by Franz Werfel), and there have been several novels about Paul (by Shalom Asch and Samuel Sandmel). Jewish philosophers (including Baruch Spinoza, Leo Shestov, and Jacob Taubes) and Jewish psychoanalysts (including Sigmund Freud and Hanns Sachs) have engaged with the apostle {{as one of the most}} influential figures in Western thought. Scholarly surveys of Jewish {{interest in}} Paul include those by Hagner (1980), Meissner (1996), and Langton (2010, 2011).|$|E

50|$|The {{challenge}} for many businesses working in food service was that while sustainability {{was seen as}} important, there was no consistency {{in the way it}} was defined or addressed.

50|$|It is {{sometimes}} {{difficult to distinguish}} irredentism from pan-nationalism, since both claim that all members of an ethnic and cultural nation belong in one specific state. Pan-nationalism {{is less likely to}} specify the nation ethnically. For instance, variants of Pan-Germanism have different ideas <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>constituted</b> Greater Germany, including the confusing term Grossdeutschland, which, in fact, implied the inclusion of huge Slavic minorities from the Austro-Hungarian Empire.|$|R
500|$|One {{of green}} marketing's {{challenges}} {{is the lack}} of standards or public consensus <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>constitutes</b> [...] "green," [...] according to Joel Makower, a writer on green marketing. In essence, there is no definition of [...] "how good is good enough" [...] {{when it comes to a}} product or company making green marketing claims. This lack of consensus—by consumers, marketers, activists, regulators, and influential people—has slowed the growth of green products, says Makower, because companies are often reluctant to promote their green attributes, and consumers are often skeptical about claims.|$|E

According to author {{and professor of}} literature and pop culture Harold Schechter, [...] "though Goofus is clearly meant to be obnoxious, even destructive–a bundle of unbridled aggression–he generally seems more appealing than the do-gooder Gallant", which Schechter believed necessitated the explanatory caption below each strip to confirm which character children should be emulating. [...] Alan A.

He claims that the [...] "ghost" [...] inside the brain is the Puppet Master himself, lured into the body by Section 6. The body reactivates itself, claims to be a sentient being and requests political asylum.

5000|$|Professor Paul W. Drake {{argued that}} the U.S. first {{attempted}} to export democracy in Latin America through intervention from 1912 to 1932. Drake argued that this was contradictory because international law defines intervention as [...] "dictatorial interference {{in the affairs of}} another state for the purpose of altering the condition of things." [...] The study suggested that efforts to promote democracy failed because democracy needs to develop out of internal conditions, and can not be forcibly imposed. There was disagreement <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>constituted</b> democracy; Drake suggested American leaders sometimes defined democracy in a narrow sense of a nation having elections; Drake suggested a broader understanding was needed. Further, there was disagreement <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>constituted</b> a [...] "rebellion"; Drake saw a pattern in which the U.S. State Department disapproved of any type of rebellion, even so-called [...] "revolutions", and in some instances rebellions against dictatorships. Historian Walter LaFeber stated, [...] "The world's leading revolutionary nation (the U.S.) in the eighteenth century became the leading protector of the status quo in the twentieth century." ...|$|R

500|$|The Underland Chronicles {{was first}} {{conceived}} by author Suzanne Collins {{while working as}} a television screenwriter for Generation O!. She was encouraged by colleague James Proimos to begin writing children's books, and started the manuscript of Gregor the Overlander shortly thereafter. Proimos also recommended her to his literary agent, Rosemary Stimola. Upon seeing a sample of that first book, Stimola immediately agreed to represent Collins and sent the book's manuscript to Scholastic. Stimola represented Collins throughout the publication of each book in the series, including Gregor and the Curse of the Warmbloods, and helped to bolster Collins's confidence during the [...] "Harry wave" [...] - her name for the [...] "skewed publisher expectations <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>constitutes</b> a success" [...] that resulted from the publication of J.

Kitsis thought that [...] "It was interesting what [...] said to Michael … that really carries through Michael's arc." [...] Later in the season, Martin Keamy (Kevin Durand) tries to shoot Michael in the head, but the gun jams and the next day, {{a manifestation of the}} island in the form of Christian Shephard (John Terry) appears before Michael. Damon Lindelof confirmed that the island's [...] "cosmic intervention of fate" [...] also played a part in the car crash that foiled Jack's suicide attempt in the third-season finale. Following the broadcast of the fourth midseason premiere, Lindelof further confirmed that this island force prevents Ben and Widmore from dying. Cuse has said that [...] "There is a raging debate on the show <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>constitutes</b> free will and what constitutes destiny and Michael's story was sort of a argument on the destiny side of that equation. He had more destiny to fulfil with that island than he anticipated and maybe the audience anticipated."

This migration assimilated and replaced the Indo-European speakers of the region to create a distinct identity as the language and culture of the Turkic migrants eventually supplanted the original Indo-European influences. This fluid definition of Uyghur and the diverse ancestry of modern Uyghurs create confusion <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>constitutes</b> true Uyghur ethnography and ethnogenesis.|$|E

2500|$|The {{roots of}} Indigenous {{feminism}} are in {{those of the}} mainstream feminist movement; however, Indigenous feminism also seeks to incorporate specifically Indigenous perspectives into both of these feminist frameworks. Indigenous feminism diverges from postcolonial feminism, as {{some have argued that}} postcolonial theory in general has largely ignored the histories of colonialism as it exists for Indigenous populations. Some other Indigenous scholars (such as Robert Warrior, Elizabeth Cook-Lynn, Craig S. Womack) have expressed concern over the limits of postcolonial theory and its application to Indigenous studies. There is often distrust of Western theoretical paradigms which can marginalize Indigenous perspectives. In [...] "Who Stole Native American Studies?"
