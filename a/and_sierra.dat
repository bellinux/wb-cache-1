5|$|Although European foxes were {{introduced}} to portions of the United States in the 1900s recent genetic investigation indicates an absence of European fox haplotypes in any North American populations. Also, introduced eastern red foxes have colonized southern California, the San Joaquin Valley, and San Francisco Bay Area, but appear to have mixed with the Sacramento Valley red fox V.v.patwin only in a narrow hybrid zone. In addition, no evidence is seen of interbreeding of eastern red foxes in California with the montane Sierra Nevada red fox V.v.necator or other populations in the Intermountain West (between the Rocky Mountains {{to the east and}} the Cascade <b>and</b> <b>Sierra</b> Nevada ranges to the west.|$|E

In 1951, the second township of Taytay (municipality of Duero) was founded by Fabian Baja in accordance with Datahan's directions. Significant Eskaya populations are now {{also found in the}} nearby townships of Canta-ub, Lundag, Tambongan, Cadapdapan, and Fatimah.

Many areas reported at least 2in (50mm) of rain between September26 and October1; coastal areas near and west of Acapulco received up to 6in (150mm). As river levels rose, a state of emergency was declared for eight municipalities, which was only concluded on September30. Two landslides occurred in Chilpancingo; several others occurred in Coyuca de Benitez <b>and</b> <b>Sierra</b> de Atoyac. More than 300homes were flooded with up to 6in (15cm) of water in Coyuca de Benitez. Three temporary shelters were opened in Barra de Coyuca, however, they were closed as no one moved in.|$|E
5|$|The Land Warfare Hall also {{accommodates}} the Royal Anglian Regiment Museum.

The museum covers {{the history of the}} Regiment and its predecessors, which date back to the seventeenth century, up to recent operations in Iraq, Afghanistan <b>and</b> <b>Sierra</b> Leone. Alongside the museum is the Cambridgeshire Regiment Exhibition, which displays items from the Cambridgeshire Regiment collection.

5|$|By the 1860s, natural ice was {{increasingly}} {{being used to}} move western American products to the east, starting with chilled meat from Chicago. There was some initial opposition, both from the cattle-car owners and from eastern butchers, who stood to lose out from the trade; by the 1870s, however, multiple shipments were leaving for the east each day. Chilled butter from the mid-West was then shipped onwards from New York to Europe, and by the 1870s 15 percent of the United Kingdom's butter consumption was being met in this way. A chain of icing stations at Chicago, Omaha, Utah <b>and</b> <b>Sierra</b> Nevada allowed railroad refrigerator cars to cross the continent. The ability of ice companies to ship their product by rail from the east proved the final straw for the Alaskan ice trade, which collapsed during the 1870s and 1880s {{in the face of}} the competition, destroying the local saw-mill industry in the process.|$|E
5|$|Commercial logging {{had also}} been {{operating}} for years in the Trinity River country, {{but most of the}} timber produced was used locally. After World War II, logging greatly increased both due to high demand for housing domestically and abroad, and the introduction of more advanced technologies. In 1959 alone, loggers took 439 million board feet from Trinity County. The rate dropped after that, but logging continued at 200–300 million board feet per year well into the 1980s. Many logged areas were on steep mountains, and improper construction of roads and skid trails exposed slopes to erosion and landslides. In 1988 several environmentalist groups including the Wilderness Society, Audubon Society <b>and</b> <b>Sierra</b> Club filed a lawsuit against the Forest Service, preventing the cutting of 18.4 million board feet of salvage lumber in an area with particularly high erosion risk. This generated pushback in the local timber industry, whose decline has partly been attributed to more stringent environmental regulations.|$|E
