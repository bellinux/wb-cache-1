5|$|In July 2009, Port Vale's Micky Adams {{appointed}} Horsfield as player-assistant manager. He {{aimed to}} play a majority of Vale's games in the 2009–10 season while learning the ropes of management. He played in the opening four {{games of the season}} despite needing painkillers for <b>a</b> <b>cracked</b> rib and <b>a</b> <b>cracked</b> bone in his hand, the first broken bones he had ever suffered. The club reached the third round of the League Cup, but after three consecutive defeats, Adams placed the entire squad on the transfer list. He suffered from niggling injuries, in addition to a torn hamstring, which limited his appearances. This caused him to consider his retirement in the summer of 2010. Port Vale did not offer him a new playing contract, but did retain him on the coaching staff.|$|E

40|$|AbstractCrack {{propagation}} in particle {{composite materials}} {{depends on the}} properties of a matrix and a particle. A changing combination of the materials of a matrix and a particle together with various shape of the particle can result either in an increase or decrease of global fracture properties of the composite. <b>A</b> <b>crack</b> propagating through <b>a</b> particle composite {{can be found in}} the following positions: (i) <b>a</b> <b>crack</b> with its tip in the matrix and approaching the particle, (ii) <b>a</b> <b>crack</b> with its tip at the matrix/particle interface, (iii) <b>a</b> <b>crack</b> passing through the particle (iv) <b>a</b> <b>crack</b> lying in the matrix/particle interface, (v) <b>a</b> <b>crack</b> with its tip in a corner or at a tip of a polygon-like particle. The stress state in the second and the last cases differs from the stress field of <b>a</b> <b>crack</b> in <b>a</b> homogeneous material. The last case can be simulated by means of a bi-material notch model. The model can be used for evaluation of toughening mechanisms of silicate based composites with various shapes of aggregates. The stress singularity exponents of the bi-material models are determined and analyzed for typical materials combinations and typical shapes of aggregates. As silicate based composites exhibit quasi-brittle behaviour, the stress field should be described in a larger area ahead of <b>a</b> <b>crack</b> tip. For this reason, the exponents of non-singular stress terms are analysed as well. Stress distribution in the vicinity of <b>a</b> <b>crack</b> tip is analysed and conditions for further crack propagation are estimated...|$|R

5|$|Also in Arcadia, a Motel 6 {{was badly}} damaged. Other {{structural}} damage {{resulted from the}} shock. For example, both Monrovia and Pasadena each {{had more than a}} dozen buildings that were uninhabitable, {{but for the most part}} damage was limited to cracked plaster and broken windows. The Pasadena City Hall had moderate damage consisting of <b>a</b> <b>cracked</b> wall, dislodged marble barriers in the restrooms, and an offset dome. In Sierra Madre, four apartment buildings and nine homes were also tagged as uninhabitable. Of the more than 100 injuries that were reported in Arcadia, Pasadena, Glendale, and Sierra Madre, most were cuts, bruises, and sprains, but some serious injuries also occurred.|$|E
5|$|Boycott {{began his}} Test career on 4 June 1964, {{only two years}} after his {{first-class}} debut, in the first Test against Australia. He top scored with 48 runs from 118 deliveries before he was bowled by Grahame Corling. The match ended as a rain-affected draw, and Boycott did not bat in the second innings as he had suffered <b>a</b> <b>cracked</b> finger. He made 58 at Old Trafford, and then hit 113 at The Oval, his maiden Test century. He finished his first Test series with 291 runs at 48.50.|$|E
5|$|Following his draft, Booth {{returned}} to Michigan State {{to complete his}} four-year tenure with the school. During his junior year, he and teammate Bryan Lerg set a Spartans record for the fastest two goals scored in a game (five seconds apart). Their goals came in a 6–5 overtime loss to the Alaska Nanooks in February 2005 and surpassed the previous record by one second. Later that month, Booth sustained <b>a</b> <b>cracked</b> rib and was sidelined for several games. He finished the 2004–05 season with 16 points (seven goals and nine assists) over 29 contests.|$|E

5|$|After {{progressing}} {{through the}} ranks, Torres {{won his first}} important youth title in 1998. Atlético sent an under-15 team {{to compete in the}} Nike Cup, in Spain and Europe, to play against youth teams from other clubs; Atlético won the tournament. He was later voted the best player in Europe for the age group. In 1999, at the age of 15, Torres signed his first professional contract with Atlético. He spent his first year playing in the youth team and participated in the Honor Division when he was 16. The 2000–01 season had started poorly, as Torres suffered from <b>a</b> <b>cracked</b> shinbone which kept him out of play until December. Torres trained with the first team to get prepared for pre-season, but eventually made his debut on 27 May 2001, at the Vicente Calderón Stadium, against Leganés. One week later, he scored his first goal for the club, against Albacete, and the season finished with Atlético narrowly missing out on promotion to La Liga.|$|E
5|$|In July 2007, {{the museum}} pushed back the {{expected}} completion date by 18 months, {{due in part to}} issues with the boiler restoration. By January 2009, with further problems encountered including misaligned frames and <b>a</b> <b>cracked</b> right hand cylinder, as well as due to rising metal prices, the museum launched the SOS (Save Our Scotsman) appeal, seeking to raise a further £250,000, hoping to complete the work by 2010. In May 2011, the locomotive was unveiled on the museum's turntable, finished in wartime black LNER livery; following final testing it was planned to finish it in LNER apple green and have it running excursions by the summer. In June 2011, cracks were discovered in the horn blocks, which led to further testing which discovered numerous latent cracks throughout the frame assembly, leading to the replacement of the main stretcher bar, horn ties and middle cylinder motion bracket, all of which were deemed beyond repair.|$|E
5|$|The video {{introduces}} a sober, contemplative side of Madonna, revealing a mature mysticism. It {{begins with the}} camera skimming along <b>a</b> <b>cracked,</b> desiccated desert floor, and within seconds Madonna appears, hovering just above {{the ground in the}} distance. Her hands are covered with mehndi and an enigmatic symbol on one palm. In the video she slowly gestures and sways her arms toward the sky in the video, desperately pleading to her cold lover cited in the song. At one point Madonna falls, and as she hits the ground, she transforms into a flock of large, dark birds. Later, she transforms into a black dog. Three Madonnas also appear walking and crawling amid the desert throughout the video. As the song progresses, the sky darkens, and Madonna levitates from the ground. Her form then changes to a shiny black liquid, which runs along the desert floor and appears to be absorbed by the tattooed hands of another Madonna, who is curled up on the crenellated ground. The video ends with a desperate and melancholy Madonna.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe article dwells on a {{model of}} <b>a</b> surface <b>crack</b> growth for <b>a</b> {{cylinder}} of a long-stroke compressor taking into account plastic deformations in <b>a</b> <b>crack</b> tip and <b>a</b> type of loading. We have obtained experimental data for cross-shaped samples made of engineering material; the samples {{have been used to}} study the effect of biaxial loading on <b>a</b> <b>crack</b> growth rate. The crack growth has been examined comparing the results obtained under monoaxial tension and under biaxial compression-tension. The fracture in <b>a</b> fatigue <b>crack</b> tip is presented as a combination of brittle fracture on <b>a</b> <b>crack</b> tip and as a ductile fracture in a propagation zone of plastic deformations. The finite element method with linear hardening in a zone of plastic deformations have been used to explore a stress state in <b>a</b> <b>crack</b> zone. The formula is proposed to determine the growth rate of fatigue cracks taking into account brittle and ductile stress parameters in the crack tip...|$|R

40|$|Vibrothermography is a {{nondestructive}} evaluation (NDE) technique that has shown great promise in detecting tight cracks that {{can often be}} missed using other NDE methods. Vibration applied to <b>a</b> structure containing <b>cracks</b> forces crack faces to rub together and generates frictional heat imaged with an infrared camera. The closure state of <b>a</b> <b>crack</b> controls the locations and magnitude of heat generation in <b>a</b> vibrated <b>crack.</b> Noncontacting regions of cracks and regions under large closure stresses generally do not rub together to generate heat. Heat is generated at contacting regions of crack faces under low closure stresses. Regions along <b>a</b> <b>crack</b> that generate heat can be modulated based on externally applied stresses. The closure state of <b>a</b> <b>crack,</b> the level of applied vibration, and externally applied stresses influence the regions of <b>a</b> <b>crack</b> that will generate heat and those that will not. Due {{to the nature of}} the heat generation process, some cracks that are not detectable using other NDE methods are readily detectable using Vibrothermography...|$|R

5|$|Upfront, Vettel {{had reduced}} {{the gap between}} himself and Alonso to one second by lap50 as the pair {{continued}} to trade the fastest lap time. Glock started to slow on the circuit {{and drove to the}} pit lane to retire. It was later confirmed that his retirement was the result of an issue with his car's hydraulic system. With the advantage of having newer tyres which gave him more grip, Kubica was able to make short work of Alguersuari, Buemi, his teammate Petrov, Massa, Hülkenberg, and Sutil (who was holding up a queue of five cars) in the space of nine laps. Vettel continued to pressure race-leader Alonso in the closing laps as the pair began to encounter slower cars. Kovalainen and Buemi made contact in the final sector of the lap, with the latter spinning around in front of the Toro Rosso, who was quick to avoid a head-on collision. Kovalainen's car suffered <b>a</b> <b>cracked</b> fuel tank pressure release valve and he limped back to the pit lane, the rear of his Lotus catching fire during the final few turns. Kovalainen aborted the pit entry, but did not make it much further as his car was consumed by the fire. Kovalainen stopped on the main straight and got out of his car to extinguish the fire himself after members of the Williams team handed him a fire extinguisher. As Kovalainen was off the racing line, yellow flags were waved in the final corners instead of a safety car deployment.|$|E
5|$|Later in April, {{the team}} took two wins at two {{concurrent}} events. In stage 2 at the Presidential Cycling Tour of Turkey, Valentin {{took his first}} win {{of the season in}} a field sprint, besting Alessandro Petacchi at the finish. The victory made the younger Iglinsky the race leader for a day before he ceded it to 's Manuel Belletti, winner of stage 3. Later in the race, Zeits made a fortunate breakaway which took nearly 12 minutes over the rest of the peloton. The result put him fourth in the overall standings, 20 seconds clear of the man in fifth, but 10 minutes ahead of the man in sixth. The next day, the Astana squad worked hard to get another breakaway containing Zeits to the finish line first, which resulted him in moving up to second overall. He retained this position to the conclusion of the race. At the Tour de Romandie, Vinokourov won stage 3. He, Mickaël Cherel, and Tony Martin had slipped off the front of the field when the day's principal breakaway was caught, and stayed away to allow a three-up sprint decide the winner, though they had no appreciable time gap over the fast-charging peloton at the finish. Cherel protested the results, feeling that Vinokourov's sprint had illegally impeded him, but race officials upheld the order of finish on the road. Vinokourov felt after this result that he was a strong contender for the overall crown, sitting 32 seconds back with an individual time trial, where pending race leader Pavel Brutt struggles, still to race. He finished the race third, losing time to race champion Cadel Evans in that time trial. He later said he was satisfied with this performance. However, at this race, Kiserlovski was revealed to have worse injuries from his Paris–Nice crash than first thought. An MRI taken after the Romandie prologue, due to the Croatian suffering from severe shoulder pain, revealed that he had <b>a</b> <b>cracked</b> vertebra. He abandoned the race with hopes of recovering in time for the Giro d'Italia. Vinokourov had a successful Critérium du Dauphiné. He finished second in the prologue time trial and assumed the race lead the next day on the first road race stage. He held the jersey for a second day before losing it in the stage 3 time trial, a considerably longer course than the prologue. He finished a distant 14th, having difficulty on the technical descents on the course, and slipped to fourth overall. When Janez Brajkovič faltered in stage 6, Vinokourov re-assumed a podium position, third, and kept it to the race's conclusion the next day.|$|E

5|$|The 1950–51 Ashes {{series was}} Australia's first home series in three years. In the opening match {{of the season}} for Victoria against the touring Englishmen, Johnston warmed up by scoring 30 and taking a total of 3/89, {{including}} the wickets of leading batsmen Compton and Hutton. In the First Test at Brisbane, England were caught on a sticky wicket and Johnston took 5/35, removing Reg Simpson, Washbrook, Evans, Compton and Arthur McIntyre, as England declared at 7/68. He then took 2/30 in the second innings, removing Evans and Compton {{for a second time}} as Australia won the match to take a 1–0 lead. In the Second Test at the MCG, Johnston took 2/28 and 4/26 as Australia scraped home by 28 runs, defending a target of only 179 on <b>a</b> <b>cracked</b> pitch. Johnston had quiet Third Test with only a total of 1/82 in an innings victory, but he returned to form in the Fourth Test in Adelaide with 3/58 and 4/73 in a 274-run win. He did much of the heavy lifting in the second innings, removing the top four English batsmen, Hutton, Simpson, Washbrook and Compton. Johnston struggled in the final Test with match figures of 1/91 as England won their only Test of the series. Johnston led the wicket takers list, with 22 at 19.18, as Australia took a 4–1 series triumph. Johnston had saved his best performances for the Tests; he managed only 19 wickets at 40.37 in eight matches for Victoria during the season, and never took more than two wickets in an innings. He was particularly unsuccessful against New South Wales, taking a total of 3/190 in two matches. Overall, he took 41 wickets at 29.00 for the season.|$|E
