60|$|The {{possibility}} that the boy might remember Trumps was not so unlikely after <b>all,</b> <b>for,</b> <b>being</b> of a highly social disposition, Tommy was pretty well acquainted with, and known to, nearly all the thieves and pickpockets of the locality.

60|$|As {{they rode}} on, James was entirely {{occupied}} with the lady, and Malcolm {{was a good}} deal left to himself; for, though the party was numerous, he knew no one except the Duke of Bedford, who was riding with the King and Lord Warwick, in deep consultation, while Sir Nigel Baird, Lord Marmion, and the rest were in the rear. He fell into a mood of depression such as had not come upon him since he passed the border, thinking himself despised by <b>all</b> <b>for</b> <b>being</b> ill-favoured and ill-dressed, and chafing, above all, at the gay contempt he fancied in young Ralf Percy's eye. He became constantly more discontented with this noisy turmoil, and more resolved to insist on returning to the peaceful cloister where alone he could hide his head and be at rest.|$|E
60|$|We {{struck down}} the lane, then across some rocky pasture-land which offered good {{advantages}} for stumbling; consequently we were down in the mud most of the time, and every time a man went down he blackguarded the war, {{and the people who}} started it, and everybody connected with it, and gave himself the master dose of <b>all</b> <b>for</b> <b>being</b> so foolish as to go into it. At last we reached the wooded mouth of a ravine, and there we huddled ourselves under the streaming trees, and sent the negro back home. It was a dismal and heart-breaking time. We were like to be drowned with the rain, deafened with the howling wind and the booming thunder, and blinded by the lightning. It was indeed a wild night. The drenching we were getting was misery enough, but a deeper misery still was the reflection that the halter might end us before we were a day older. A death of this shameful sort had not occurred to us as being among the possibilities of war. It took the romance all out of the campaign, and turned our dreams of glory into a repulsive nightmare. As for doubting that so barbarous an order had been given, not one of us did that.|$|E

50|$|He is {{probably}} remembered most of <b>all</b> <b>for</b> <b>being</b> a tireless rationalist populariser of basic Marxist ideas, for his books on late capitalism and Long-Wave theory, {{and for his}} moral-intellectual leadership in the Trotskyist movement. Despite critics claiming that he was 'too soft on Stalinism', Mandel remained a classic rather than a conservative Trotskyist: writing about the Soviet bureaucracy but also why capitalism hadn’t suffered a death agony. His late capitalism {{was late in the}} sense of delayed rather than near-death. He still believed though that this system hadn’t overcome its tendency to crises.|$|E

The standard album cover has been described as [...] "minimal yet smoldering", featuring Lipa in a scaly jacket and she stares longingly into the camera with wet hair covering one side of her face with shades of purple and blue. The deluxe album cover features the same picture of Lipa, just with the difference in the shades, now being pink and green.|$|E

Dani had many conflicts with Berta, Pepe, Cristian and Hugo, but he stressed above <b>all</b> <b>for</b> <b>being</b> a very funny person.On Day 113 Dani became a finalist, although he thought that he was eliminated. He went to the central studio of Telecinco and saw videos of his passage through the House within the soundproof room. That same day, Dani chose his friend Ariadna to accompany him until the end. He was third with 15,2%. He took part in La Re-Vuelta.|$|E

The litany of 'firsts' recorded at Leiden is dazzling - the first printed catalogue to be prepared by an institution of its holdings, the first attempt to identify and maintain what today are known as 'special collections,' the first systematic attempt to develop a corps of influential friends, patrons, and benefactors throughout the world, the first 'universal' library, {{the list goes on and}} on - and underpinning it all is a humanistic approach to education and discovery that has figured prominently throughout its history, along with an unbending belief in the limitless potential of human inquiry." ...|$|E
