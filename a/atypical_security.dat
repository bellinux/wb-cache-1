40|$|<b>Atypical</b> <b>security</b> {{interests}} such as leases {{and title}} retentions have {{developed in the}} French legal system as a resuit of the realization that security Systems have been made impractical {{by the development of}} ban-kruptcy legislation. However, la fiducie-sûrete, the sale of the property to a creditor as a means of security, has not received universal acceptance although some means of property sales for security purposes is necessary for creditors. In Japan <b>atypical</b> <b>security</b> interests, which do not have a statutory basis in the Japanese Civil Code, have been developed within this practice. From {{the beginning of the twentieth}} century, for example, courts of law have recognized joto-tanpo (fiducie-sûrete). Through this system, creditors are able to avoid formal enforcement procedures and secure payment through either selling or acquiring the object itself. The purpose of this paper is to introduce the <b>atypical</b> <b>security</b> as it applies to Japanese law for the purposes of suggesting its practibility to the French legal system.
