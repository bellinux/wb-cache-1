5|$|As {{a result}} of the war, several tribes, {{including}} the Shawnee, migrated into Indiana, where they attempted to resettle in land belonging to the Miami.

5|$|By 2000, {{deliveries}} were delayed, and in June all trams {{were taken}} out of service for three weeks to modify the gearboxes. In October, ten of thirteen trams {{were taken out}} of service due to radial run-out. The problem was large enough that some trams got a new radial run-out the day <b>after</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> fixed. From 6 January 2001, SL95 could be used on the Grünerløkka–Torshov Line, and from 6 February, on the Ekeberg Line. However, the latter still had too short platforms.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} time since 2009, Alabama played Kentucky at Lexington, and in the game Alabama {{defeated}} the Wildcats 48–7. Although the Crimson Tide defense opened the game strong and forced Kentucky to punt after they held the Wildcats to a series of three-and-outs on their initial possessions, the Alabama offense did not see the same on-field success. <b>After</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> held to a punt on their first possession, fumbles by Kenyan Drake and T. J. Yeldon on the next two Crimson Tide possessions inside the Wildcats' 15-yard line kept the game scoreless.|$|E

5|$|In the game, coach Mack Brown and his Texas Longhorns beat USC by {{the score}} of 41–38 and ended USC's 34game win streak.

5|$|India had a shaky {{start to}} the tournament. In their opening match against the Netherlands, they were bowled out for 204 runs. Although they won the game by 79 runs, the team was criticised for failing to bat out their 50 overs. <b>After</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> {{dismissed}} for 125 runs against Australia and lost the match by nine wickets, angry fans in India burned effigies of the players; Mohammad Kaif's house and Rahul Dravid's car were vandalised. India won all the remaining games of the stage—against Zimbabwe, Pakistan, Namibia and England.|$|E
