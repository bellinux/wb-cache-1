5|$|The {{trade off}} is between {{capacity}} and price. I've had some conversations with people saying 'it's {{getting a bit}} expensive Alan' <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> is. I think the obvious route is the Geoffrey Watling stand, whether you put another layer on it or take it down and re-build, I don't know. Probably the sensible {{thing to do is}} bite the bullet, take it down and build a new stand, but it means 18 to 24 months without revenue and the people in that stand tend to be {{the people who have been}} the supporters for many generations.|$|E
500|$|Foster {{talked about}} Hannibal in an {{interview}} with Total Film in late 2005. She said: [...] "The official reason I didn't do Hannibal is I was doing another movie, Flora Plum. So I get to say, in a nice dignified way, that I wasn't available when that movie was being shot... Clarice meant so much to Jonathan and I, she really did, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> sounds kind of strange to say {{but there was no way}} that either of us could really trample on her." ...|$|E

500|$|The strike, which {{dragged into}} August, sealed the Tribune's fate. Half the {{editorial}} staff left the newspaper for new jobs during the strike. That summer, Bellows wrote to Matt Meyer, {{the head of}} the new company, that it would be [...] "almost impossible -- with the present staff -- to publish a Herald Tribune I would be proud to be the editor of, or be able to compete with successfully in the morning field." [...] On August 13, with the strike still going on, the management decided to end publication of the Tribune, which Whitney announced in the ninth-floor auditorium of the Tribune building on August 15. [...] "I know we gave something good to our city while we published <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> will be a loss to journalism in this country as we cease publication," [...] Whitney said. [...] "I am glad that we never tried to cheapen it in any way, that we have served as a conscience and a valuable opposition. I am sorry that it had to end." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bernhardt had a {{remarkable}} ability to memorize a role quickly. She recounted in L'Art du Théâtre that [...] "I {{only have to}} read a role {{two or three times}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> completely; but the day that I stop playing the piece the role escapes me entirely... My memory can't contain several parts at the same time, and it's impossible for me to recite off-hand a tirade from Phèdre or Hamlet. And yet I can remember the smallest events from my childhood." [...] She also suffered, particularly early in her career, bouts of memory loss and stage fright. Once, she was seriously ill before a performance of L'Etrangére at the Gaiety Theater in London, and the doctor gave her a dose of painkiller, either opium or morphine. During the performance, she went on stage, but could not remember what she was supposed to say. She turned to another actress, and announced, [...] "If I made you come here, Madame, it is because I wanted to instruct you in what I want done... I have thought about it, and I do not want to tell you today", then walked offstage. The other actors, astonished, quickly improvised an ending to the scene. After a brief rest, her memory came back, and Bernhardt went back on stage, and completed the play.|$|E

6000|$|... "This; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it's</b> a grave {{thing to}} ask. Would you seriously object to my {{bringing}} the child over here, with its mother?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Pray don't leave off telling me," [...] said Margaret--"it is {{just what}} I wish on my own account, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> is {{comfortable}} {{to have a good}} grumble." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Humph! Do {{you imagine}} you can scare {{me in that}} fashion? You haven't any pistol, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it.</b> If you had you would have drawn the weapon long ago." ...|$|E
60|$|DAISY. Yes, I {{think it}} is. At {{the first moment}} <b>I</b> {{believed}} it. <b>And</b> then <b>I</b> thought <b>it</b> over <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> couldn't be true. I don't think you'd do anything underhand.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, he'll be all right, {{but if he}} wouldn't, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it,</b> <b>I</b> {{should have}} to tell him, all the same. Now, good-night. Well, there, then; and there! Now, let me go!" ...|$|R
