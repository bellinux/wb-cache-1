5|$|Edmiston was <b>also</b> <b>very</b> {{active in}} the {{sporting}} affairs of Edmonton, participating in and managing many sporting activities and clubs. He died after an accident which resulted in heart failure in 1903; an industrial park in Edmonton was subsequently named after him.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} {{to the problems of}} capacity, the National Stadium was <b>also</b> <b>very</b> well hidden by the neighbouring buildings to the south in Park Street, Wood Street and to the east in Westgate Street, and also by Cardiff Rugby Ground in the north. It was only fully visible from across the River Taff in the west. Access to the ground was <b>also</b> <b>very</b> restricted with the main entrance being a narrow opening in Westgate Street to the east which was shared by both vehicles and spectators alike.|$|E

5|$|Phineas is <b>also</b> <b>very</b> modest. He {{tends to}} put Ferb's name on inventions. This {{may be because}} Ferb {{does most of the}} building. However, he never seems angry or resentful of giving his brother the credit.|$|E
5|$|While {{there may}} have been the {{occasional}} fusion, Bouyon has always maintained a very clear, recognisable and obviously different style from soca. This style of bouyon music was originated in Dominica, but is <b>also</b> <b>very</b> popular in Saint Lucia, Guadeloupe and Martinique.|$|E
5|$|As a batsman, Macaulay was {{reasonably}} good and possibly {{better than his}} statistics would suggest. He was capable of batting well in a crisis but may have been prevented from honing his batting skills by the Yorkshire leadership who wished him to focus on bowling. He generally batted low down in the order after the all-rounders in the team. Macaulay's fielding was <b>also</b> <b>very</b> effective. He was excellent at close range to the batsmen, particularly from his own bowling.|$|E

5|$|Besides Pluto, Makemake is {{the only}} other dwarf planet that was bright enough that Clyde Tombaugh could have {{detected}} it during his search for trans-Neptunian planets around 1930. At the time of Tombaugh's survey, Makemake {{was only a few}} degrees from the ecliptic, near the border of Taurus and Auriga, at an apparent magnitude of 16.0. This position, however, was <b>also</b> <b>very</b> near the Milky Way, and Makemake would have been almost impossible to find against the dense background of stars. Tombaugh continued searching for some years after the discovery of Pluto, but he did not find Makemake or any other trans-Neptunian objects.|$|E
5|$|Giant Schnauzers {{have been}} {{described}} as trustworthy with children. They are very intelligent, and can become bored easily. They are <b>also</b> <b>very</b> energetic and highly spirited, which, when coupled with boredom, can lead to unwanted and destructive behavior. They are easily trained, and deeply loyal to their owner. Some breeders believe that pepper and salt colored Giant Schnauzers are more docile than their black-furred counterparts.|$|E
5|$|He {{had been}} {{recommended}} {{to me as}} a man of energy and enthusiasm, but he seemed shy when we met. It was only on further acquaintance that I noticed other traits. He was extremely good company, with a sharp tongue and an inclination to dismiss most of humanity as spies and traitors. I rather liked that! I discovered he was very ambitious, perhaps more than his abilities warranted, and <b>also</b> <b>very</b> excitable. He sometimes worked himself up into such a state that he lost all powers of reasoning.|$|E

5|$|He was {{the most}} amazing and ingenious combat pilot I ever saw. He was <b>also</b> <b>very</b> lucky on many occasions. He thought nothing of jumping into a fight outnumbered ten to one, often alone, with us {{trying to catch up}} to him. He {{violated}} every cardinal rule of fighter combat. He abandoned all the rules.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to their striking, superficial similarity to contemporary shrimp, Waptia fieldensis were <b>also</b> <b>very</b> shrimp-like in their habits. They were bottom-dwelling (nektobenthic) deposit feeders. The lack of strong feeding appendages indicates {{that they were more}} likely to feed by sifting through the sea bottom for edible organic particles. Their tails and the feather-like filaments on their posterior thoracic somites also imply that they were active swimmers.|$|E
5|$|Leaf {{morphology}} is <b>also</b> <b>very</b> {{diverse in}} this large genus. Some leaves are very thin, almost needle-like (S. affine), {{while others are}} short, stubby, and arranged in rosettes (S. pulviniforme). Another group of species, such as S. scandens (climbing triggerplant) form scrambling, tangled mats typically propped up on aerial roots.|$|E

Around 10% of residents claim Jobseeker's Allowance; this is double the Gateshead average and is the highest figure in the borough. Youth unemployment levels are <b>also</b> <b>very</b> high at 14%, which compares to a borough average of 9% and is also the highest figure in Gateshead. The average income of residents is only £18,000 per annum; this compares to a Gateshead average of £27,000 and is the lowest figure in the borough.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the later}} 20th-century composers, such as John Cage, John Corigliano, and Steve Reich, Miguel del Aguila, used modernist and minimalist techniques. Reich {{discovered}} a technique known as phasing, in which two musical activities begin simultaneously and are repeated, gradually drifting out of sync, creating a natural sense of development. Reich was <b>also</b> <b>very</b> interested in non-Western music, incorporating African rhythmic techniques in his compositions. Recent composers and performers are strongly influenced by the minimalist works of Philip Glass, a Baltimore native based out of New York, Meredith Monk, and others.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} popular forms of meal in Ahmedabad is a typical Gujarati thali which was first served commercially by Chandvilas Hotel in 1900. It {{consists}} of roti (Chapati), dal, rice and shaak (cooked vegetables, sometimes with curry), with accompaniments of pickles and roasted papads. Sweet dishes include laddoo, mango, and vedhmi. Dhoklas, theplas and dhebras are <b>also</b> <b>very</b> popular dishes in Ahmedabad. Beverages include buttermilk and tea. Drinking alcohol is forbidden in Ahmedabad.|$|E

5|$|Political {{analysts have}} {{suggested}} {{several reasons for}} this victory, including the popularity of Modi, {{and the loss of}} support for the Congress due to the corruption scandals in its previous term. The BJP was also able to expand its traditionally upper-caste, upper-class support base and received significant support from middle-class and Dalit people, as well as among Other Backward Classes. Its support among Muslims remained low; only 8% of Muslim voters voted for the BJP. The BJP was <b>also</b> <b>very</b> successful at mobilising its supporters, and raising voter turnout among them.|$|E
5|$|Prinz zur Lippe-Weißenfeld in {{his younger}} years was very {{enthusiastic}} about the mountains and wildlife. From his fourteenth year he participated in hunting. At {{the same time he}} was <b>also</b> <b>very</b> much interested in music and sports and discovered his love for flying at the Gaisberg near Salzburg. Here he attended the glider flying school of the Austrian Aëro Club. He attended a basic flying course with the second air regiment in Graz and Wiener Neustadt even before he joined the military service.|$|E
5|$|Promotion: A {{communication}} with the market should put stress on environmental aspects, for example that the company possesses a CP certificate or is ISO 14000 certified. This may be publicized to improve a firm’s image. Furthermore, {{the fact that a}} company spends expenditures on environmental protection should be advertised. Third, sponsoring the natural environment is <b>also</b> <b>very</b> important. And last but not least, ecological products will probably require special sales promotions.|$|E
