Australian slow left-armer Brad Young took a hat-trick to finish with an exceptional analysis of 4–2–4–4. In reply, the Australians rattled along at nearly six an over, losing only Mark Waugh as they raced to 62/1 in 10.5 overs with Gilchrist smashing three sixes as he hit 42 from 36 balls.|$|E

On multiple occasions, {{both before and after}} winning the election, Trump used Twitter to publicize his thoughts on the impersonation, as well as the show: [...] "Watched Saturday Night Live hit job on me. Time to retire the boring and unfunny show. Alec Baldwin portrayal stinks," [...] he tweeted the morning after the Emily Blunt/Bruno Mars episode on October 16, 2016. [...] "It is <b>a</b> <b>totally</b> <b>one-sided,</b> biased show —nothing funny at all. Equal time for us?", he posted on November 20 after the Kristen Wiig/The xx episode, suggesting the show follow the equal-time rule, despite the presidential race being over. His criticism continued preceding his inauguration: he dubbed it [...] "unwatchable" [...] on December 4, and tweeted [...] "Saturday Night Live is the worst of NBC. Not funny, cast is terrible, always a complete hit job. Really bad television!" [...] after the Felicity Jones/Sturgill Simpson episode on January 15, 2017.|$|E

5000|$|Galdikas was criticised in {{the late}} 1990s {{regarding}} her methods of rehabilitation. Primatologists debated the issue on the Internet mailing list Primate-Talk; the issue was further fueled by the publication of articles in Outside magazine (May 1998) and Newsweek (June 1998). As reported in both articles and summarized in the 1999 book The Follow by Canadian novelist Linda Spalding, the Indonesian Ministry of Forestry — with whom Galdikas had clashed over logging policies — claimed that Galdikas held [...] "a {{very large number of}} illegal orangutans ... in very poor conditions" [...] at her Indonesian home, prompting the government to consider formal charges. Galdikas denied all such claims in a response to Newsweek in June 1999, remarking that allegations of mistreatment were [...] "simply, wrong" [...] and that the [...] "outlandish" [...] claims formed the basis of [...] "a <b>totally</b> <b>one-sided</b> campaign against me." ...|$|R

Here we prove that <b>a</b> <b>totally</b> split-decomposable metric is cell-decomposable. This allows us to break up the tight-span of <b>a</b> <b>totally</b> split-decomposable metric into smaller, easier to understand tight-spans. As a consequence we prove that the cells in the tight-span of <b>a</b> <b>totally</b> split-decomposable metric are zonotopes that are polytope isomorphic to either hypercubes or rhombic dodecahedra...|$|R

40|$|Process {{orientation}} {{in one form}} or another has become a feature in the organizational language of many health care organizations. The objective of the present study was to investigate if different applications of process orientation exist and how these are characterised. Furthermore, the objective was to investigate how the applications of process orientation relate to the line organization. A questionnaire with the purpose to capture the respondents’ attitude towards their process initiatives was sent out to people with the explicit knowledge of process orientation within the Region of Västra Götaland. A total of 180 individuals were questioned (response rate 68 %). Based on the results, this study suggests that process orientation can be classified into three various applications – process view, process mapping, and process management. On overall, the study also illustrates a fairly low application of process orientation. Worth noticing is that the perceived gap between present status and what is regarded as desired is <b>totally</b> <b>one-sided</b> – no one states that is would be desirable with less process orientation. By viewing process orientation as a spectrum of applications, the study contributes to a more nuanced debate on process orientation...|$|R
