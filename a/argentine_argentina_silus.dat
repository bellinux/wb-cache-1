40|$|Roundnose {{grenadier}} (Coryphaenoides rupestris Gunnerus) {{were found}} in reasonable concentrations in four areas in Trøndelag, Norway. Inside the Trondheimsfjord, within a 400 to 500 m deep basin, about 340 kg was taken per half-hour-tow using a bottom prawn trawl. Around 500 kg per half-hour was taken in a 400 - 530 m deep basin in the Flatanger-Folla area, while catches above 3060 kg per half-hour were taken in a 350 m deep basin in the inner part of Foldenfjorden. Only few specimens were taken by use of pelagic trawl. In the deeper basins outside the near coastal areas, the catch rates were found too small for commercial fishing. The age of maturity {{was found to be}} about 8 and 10 years for males and females, respectively. Natural mortality rate was estimated to 0. 1. The biomass in the four major areas was calculated to about 15 000 tonnes using echo-integrations combined with pelagic and bottom trawl sampling, and a sustainable yield of 2000 per year was suggested. The roundnose grenadier was only found in waters with temperatures above 7. 0 °C. The roundnose grenadier and the greater silver smelt (<b>argentine),</b> <b>Argentina</b> <b>silus,</b> were the two dominant fishes caught; the former accounted for 70 % to 95 % and the latter for 3 % to 25 % of the total catch...|$|E
40|$|This report {{contains}} {{the results of}} the discard sampling programme of the Dutch pelagic freezer trawler fleet in European waters in 2010. The pelagic freezer trawler fishery targets pelagic species, namely herring (Clupea harengus), blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou), horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus), mackerel (Scomber scombrus), greater <b>argentine</b> (<b>Argentina</b> <b>silus),</b> and pilchard (Sardina pilchardus). The annual landings of this fishery illustrates its seasonality; different species are targeted during different parts of the year. The total landings of the Dutch fleet were about 201, 000 tonnes in 2010. Horse mackerel and herring were the most abundant landed species. Overall, the discard percentage for the Dutch pelagic fleet in 2010, based on 8 sampled trips, is estimated at 6 % in weight. This is consistent with the discard percentages that have been found in previous years. However, in 2010 we did not succeed in sampling the fishery each quarter of the year; no trip was sampled in quarter 3. On board of the pelagic freezer trawlers two different discarding methods are observed, namely discarding after the catch is sorted and discarding prior to sorting. The latter includes catch that is discarded directly or via the conveyer belt from the cooling tanks, and catch that is slipped from the net. Due to practical limitations and safety issues {{it is not possible to}} sample these discards. The results show that the estimated amount of unsampled discards represent 30 % of the total estimated discards. Motivations for discarding unsampled catch can vary. Anecdotal information implies most incidents of discarding take place when more fish is caught than can be stored in the cooling tanks. In addition, fish-quality issues, unprofitable mixtures of species, or a lack in quota, could also be reasons for this discarding behaviour. The discard composition and length frequency data shown in this report are only based on routinely sorted discards. Discard percentages of target species herring, horse mackerel, and blue whiting are relatively low (1 %, 1 %, and 4 % respectively). For mackerel the discard percentage is significantly higher (18 %). The present study therefore suggests that, with the exception of mackerel, this fishery is efficient, when it comes to targeting (marketable) fish...|$|E
40|$|Observers {{were placed}} on pelagic vessels in the Scottish {{fisheries}} for mackerel (Scomber scombrus), herring (Clupea harengus), “maatje” herring (herring caught just before their first spawning) and <b>argentines</b> (<b>Argentina</b> <b>silus)</b> to monitor by-catch composition and discarding practices. A total of 67 days was spent at sea, 11 on the argentine fleet, 28 on the herring fleet, 12 on the “maatje ” herring fleet and 16 on the mackerel fleet. The level of by-catch generally ranged from < 1 % to around 2. 5 % of the total catch. The argentine fishery took {{a significant proportion of}} blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou) (approx. 10 % of the overall catch) but this was landed and sold in the market. The greatest range of by-catch species was found in the argentine fishery, including 11 species of fish and one species of squid. Discarding rates in the fisheries varied, with herring and argentine fisheries showing no discards, the mackerel fishery a discard rate of around 4 % and the “maatje ” herring fishery a discard rate of around 11 %. By-catches included small numbers of gannets (Morus bassanus) but no marine mammals. If the sampled trips were representative, results indicate that marine mammal by-catch events typically occur during less than one in 20 hauls in the fisheries studied. A larger scale study is needed to confirm this.

40|$|Introduction: Two fish species, {{the greater}} silver smelt <b>Argentina</b> <b>silus</b> and the roundnose {{grenadier}} Coryphaenoides rupestris, are highly abundant in the deep-water areas of the Skagerrak. Since the 1970 s, a small aimed trawl fishery for the smelt has developed and now also some grenadier is landed. The biology and general distribution of both species have been described from the Skagerrak and elsewhere. Due to their benthopelagic distribution at depths from 200 to 700 m, previous attempts at estimating abundance and biomass of the Skagerrak concentrations yielded unsatisfactory results. In April 1992, during what appears as a major spawning season of the {{greater silver smelt}}, abundance estimation by the SIMRAD EK 500 echo sounder and integrator was attempted. Comparisons were made between observations made by the hull-mounted transducer and a transducer mounted in a newly developed towed body...|$|R

The species dealt with by the Group were: tusk (Brosme brosme), ling (Molva molva), blue ling (Molva dypterygia), roundnose grenadier (Coryphaenoides rupestris), greater silver smelt (<b>Argentina</b> <b>silus),</b> black scabbardfish (Aphanopus carbo) and black-spotted sea bream (Pagellus bogaraveo). All relevant information was collated in species-specific annexes, in order to have a protocol which was easy to consult and use for each species. The main report sums up the discussions in the group and presents results from the small WebGr-exchanges of each species made prior to and during the meeting. The body of the report is found in the species-specific annexes, which describe the general biological knowledge of growth and longevity for each species, review available ageing protocols, identify any unresolved problems with interpretation and recommend future actions...|$|R
