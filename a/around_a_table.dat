5|$|Giuseppe Elia Pace, an {{advocate}} and {{close friend of}} Mikiel Anton Vassalli, {{was found guilty of}} treason during the reign of de Rohan and was sentenced for flogging in Valletta followed by a permanent exile out of Malta. Vassalli was imprisoned at the Klistanija {{at the end of the}} rule of the Order of St. John, and was accused of plotting revolutionary ideas during the magistracy of Grand Master Hompesch. Vassalli denied the accusations and remained imprisoned. Meanwhile, he received visits from the father of Fortunato Panzavecchia. While dining together <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> with prison guards, Panzavecchia took notes from conversations he had with Vassalli. These notes shed more light on the life of Vassalli, who after his death became the national Maltese linguistic. Though given a life sentence, he either managed to escape or was released after the expulsion of the Order from Malta.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, with Obama {{elected president}} and his junior staffers working in the White House, Obama encouraged the group to hold the Seder again. The 2009 event {{was the first time}} that a sitting U.S. president conducted a Passover Seder in the White House. The White House switchboard was reportedly swamped with callers seeking a dinner invitation. The White House Seder was scheduled for the second night of Passover to allow Jewish staffers to spend the first Seder on the first night of Passover with their families. About 20 guests sat <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> in the Old Family Dining Room reading the Haggadah and sampling the traditional Seder foods. Malia and Sasha Obama, being the youngest in attendance, recited the Four Questions and engaged in the search for the afikoman.|$|E

The interior was finished in laminated plastics, creating a light and airy feel. They were fitted with a public address system, double-glazed windows and central fluorescent lighting along their length, the first coaches in Ireland to be so treated. Heating was by steam, supplied from a Steam Heating Van.|$|E
25|$|Scientists often posed with {{instruments}} and objects of their study around them. Physicians sometimes posed together around a cadaver, a so-called 'Anatomical Lesson', {{the most famous}} one being Rembrandt's Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp (1632, Mauritshuis, The Hague). Boards of trustees in their regentenstuk portraits preferred an image of austerity and humility, posing in dark clothing (which by its refinement testified to their prominent standing in society), often seated <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>table,</b> with solemn expressions on their faces.|$|E
25|$|In the Philippines, many {{families}} keep {{a tradition in}} which an old man, a young lady, and a small boy are chosen from among the poor and are dressed up as Saint Joseph, the Virgin Mary, and the child Jesus, respectively. They are then seated <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> set with the family's best silverware and china, and served a variety of courses, sometimes being literally spoon-fed by the {{senior members of the}} family, while the Novena to Saint Joseph is recited at a nearby temporary altar.|$|E

25|$|On January 1, 1853, Keil {{published}} his new magazine under the inconspicuous title , {{named after the}} gazebo in his garden in Leipzig. Initially he could not serve as editor because his press credentials had been revoked {{and he was still}} under police surveillance, so he borrowed the firm of Stolle & Diezmann for the first run of 5000 copies. His objective was to reach and enlighten the whole family, especially the German middle classes, through a carefully-crafted mixture of current events, essays on the natural sciences, biographies, short stories, poetry, and full-page illustrations. The magazine's masthead depicted a grandfatherly figure reading to a family <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>table.</b>|$|E

25|$|In Britain, by 1853, {{invitations to}} tea among the prosperous and fashionable often {{included}} table-turning, {{a type of}} séance in which spirits were said to communicate with people seated <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> by tilting and rotating the table. One prominent convert was the French pedagogist Allan Kardec (1804–1869), who made the first attempt to systematise the movement's practices and ideas into a consistent philosophical system. Kardec's books, written in the last 15 years of his life, became the textual basis of spiritism, which became widespread in Latin countries. In Brazil, Kardec's ideas are embraced by many followers today. In Puerto Rico, Kardec's books were widely read by the upper classes, and eventually {{gave birth to a}} movement known as mesa blanca (white table).|$|E

25|$|Locals {{tell the}} story of the specters of three cursed virgins that live on the Schlößleinsbuck. Two of them are dressed {{completely}} in white, but the third one wears a black skirt. The three virgins appeared to a farm laborer, who tilled a field near the mountain. They begged him to follow them into the mountain to release them and that because he is of pure heart, he need not fear the evil forces of darkness. They told him that on the way into the mountain they would first meet six men who have beards to the floor and sit <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>table.</b> In the second room there would be sat a black dog with fervid eyes, holding a key in its mouth. The farm laborer should take this key, even if the dog is spitting fire. With this key would then be able to get into a chamber containing a great treasure, which would then belong to him. But the farm laborer became very scared and left the virgins unsaved. It is further told that the virgins still speak to brave men, who should follow them into the mountain in order to save them.|$|E
500|$|The {{staple foods}} were {{generally}} consumed around 11 o'clock, {{and consisted of}} bread, lettuce, cheese, fruits, nuts, and cold meat {{left over from the}} dinner the night before. [...] The Roman poet Horace mentions another Roman favorite, the olive, in reference to his own diet, which he describes as very simple: [...] "As for me, olives, endives, and smooth mallows provide sustenance." [...] The family ate together, sitting on stools <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>table.</b> Fingers were used to eat solid foods and spoons were used for soups.|$|E
500|$|The Puritans were greatly {{influenced}} by Continental reformer Theodore Beza, and they had four primary agendas: seeking moral transformation; urging the practice of piety; urging the return to the Christianity of the Bible, as opposed to prayer books, ceremonies, and vestments; and the strict recognition of the Sabbath. [...] Cotton embraced all four of these practices. [...] He received {{a small amount of}} Puritan influence while at Trinity; but at Emmanuel, Puritan practices were much more visible under Master Laurence Chaderton, including non-prayer book services, ministers wearing no surplice, and communion being given <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>table.</b>|$|E

500|$|Booster Draft [...] {{is usually}} played with eight players. The players are seated <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> and each player is given three booster packs. Each player opens a pack, selects a card from it, and passes the {{remaining}} cards {{to the next}} player. Each player then selects one of the remaining cards from the pack he or she just received, and passes the remaining cards again. This continues until all of the cards are depleted. Players pass left {{for the first and}} third packs, and right for the second. Players then build decks out of any of the cards that they selected during the drafting. Talking, signaling, and showing cards is forbidden during the drafting process, except for double faced cards from the Innistrad and Shadows over Innistrad blocks and [...] "Magic Origins", which cannot be hidden as each side of the physical card has a spell printed on it.|$|E
500|$|Zimmerman and {{his team}} took {{feedback}} from the directors of previous Star Trek series to make the new space easier in which to film. Whereas in other series there has been purpose built sets for briefing rooms, following the feedback this area was built into the bridge itself as the directors had stated that it proved difficult to make several people sit <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> seem interesting. The transporter design {{was intended as a}} reference to the original series design that was created by Matt Jefferies, with Zimmerman including certain design elements such as the wall patterns around the transporter itself. The design of the engineering deck was overhauled from previous series with the intention for it to look like the engine room of a nuclear submarine. Zimmerman described it saying, [...] "You're going to see a very powerful engine that looks like a very powerful engine." ...|$|E
500|$|The Irish Hell Fire Club {{was founded}} around 1737 by Richard Parsons, 1st Earl of Rosse, and James Worsdale. Lord Rosse was {{probably}} {{the president of the}} club. Evidence of the identities of other members comes from a painting by Worsdale entitled The Hell Fire Club, Dublin, now held by the National Gallery of Ireland, which shows five members of the club seated <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>table.</b> The five men are Henry, 4th Baron Barry of Santry (who was tried and convicted for murder in 1739); Simon Luttrell, Lord Irnham; Colonel Henry Ponsonby; Colonel Richard St George and Colonel Clements. Most of their meetings occurred in Dublin city centre at the Eagle Tavern on Cork Hill, near Dublin Castle. Accounts of the club's meetings claim that members drank [...] "scaltheen", a mixture of whiskey and hot butter, and that they left a chair vacant at each gathering for the Devil. The club's mascot was a black cat.|$|E

500|$|The {{group was}} reputed to {{have adopted a}} bohemian lifestyle. It {{encompassed}} not only painters, but also writers, and other influential people. While only a few were full-time residents of the area, they were often joined by family and friends, especially during the summer months. The group initially revolved around Michael Ancher and his wife to be Anna, {{the only member of}} the group who was a native of Skagen. P.S. Krøyer, who arrived in 1882, was perhaps the most colourful member of the group. His painting Hip, Hip, Hurrah! shows several of the artists celebrating <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> out in the garden. The painters included the Swedes Oscar Björck and Johan Krouthén, the Norwegians Christian Krohg and Eilif Peterssen, and the Danes Karl Madsen, Laurits Tuxen, Marie Triepcke Krøyer Alfvén, Carl Locher, Viggo Johansen and Thorvald Niss. [...] The group also included the writers Holger Drachmann, Georg Brandes and Henrik Pontoppidan and the Swedish composer Hugo Alfvén. They often gathered in Brøndums Hotel whose dining room now forms part of Skagens Museum.|$|E
500|$|Work {{continued}} on the screenplay from 2003 onwards, {{taking place in}} the small bungalow where Groening first pitched The Simpsons in 1987. The writers spent six months discussing a plot, and each of them offered sketchy ideas. Jean suggested the family rescue manatees, which became the 2005 episode [...] "The Bonfire of the Manatees", and there was also a notion similar to that of The Truman Show where the characters discovered their lives were a TV show. Groening rejected this, as he felt that the Simpsons should [...] "never become aware of themselves as celebrities", but the idea was later used in the video game The Simpsons Game. Groening read about a town that had to get rid of pig feces in their water supply, which inspired the plot of the film. The decision for Flanders to have an important role also came early on, as Jean wished to see Bart wonder what his life would be like if Flanders were his father. Hank Scorpio, a character from the 1996 episode [...] "You Only Move Twice", was originally meant to return as the main antagonist, but the staff dropped the idea and created Russ Cargill instead. Having eventually decided on the basic outline of the plot for the film, the writers then separated it into seven sections. Jean, Scully, Reiss, Swartzwelder, Vitti, Mirkin, and Meyer wrote 25 pages each, and the group met one month later to merge the seven sections into one [...] "very rough draft". The film's script was written {{in the same way as}} the television series: the writers sitting <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>table,</b> pitching ideas, and trying to make each other laugh. The script went through over 100 revisions, and at one point the film was a musical. However, the songs were continually being shortened and the idea was dropped. Groening described his desire to also make the film dramatically stronger than a TV episode, saying that he wanted to [...] "give you something that you haven't seen before".|$|E

One {{day he was}} idly pushing balls <b>around</b> <b>a</b> <b>table,</b> and someone complained {{that while he was}} not playing himself, he was [...] "hindering other gentlemen from their amusement." [...] Roche replied, [...] "why, sir, except you and me, and two or three more, there is not a gentleman in the room." [...] A friend afterwards remarked that he had grossly offended a large company, and wondered why none had appeared to resent the affront. [...] "Oh!" [...] said Roche, [...] "there was no fear of that. There was not a thief in the room that did not consider himself one of the two or three gentlemen I excepted." ...|$|E
