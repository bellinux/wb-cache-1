40|$|In non-cooperative {{bistatic}} {{synthetic aperture}} radar (SAR), the position of transmitter’s beam footprint should be detected <b>and</b> <b>tracked</b> in real-time to perform beam synchronization. Theoretical analysis shows that signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the reflected echoes from the observational scene is too low to apply the conventional detection <b>and</b> <b>tracking</b> method. According to the cross correlation and Doppler frequency information of the backscattering echo, a beam footprint detection <b>and</b> <b>tracking</b> method is proposed in this paper. This method can realize accumulation of signal energy, therefore enormously improve the performance of beam footprint detection <b>and</b> <b>tracking.</b> Meanwhile, vehicle-based bistatic SAR experiment and airborne bistatic SAR experiment {{are performed to evaluate}} the performance of the proposed beam footprint detection <b>and</b> <b>tracking</b> method.

30|$|A final {{challenge}} in satellite communications is beam acquisition, pointing, <b>and</b> <b>tracking.</b> Longer links typically require more accurate and sophisticated acquisition, pointing <b>and</b> <b>tracking</b> systems {{to maintain an}} operational OW link, since the slightest error is magnified by the link distance. From a communication perspective, pointing <b>and</b> <b>tracking</b> are not only important for maintaining the optical link, but {{also contribute to the}} link power penalty since misalignment caused by pointing <b>and</b> <b>tracking</b> errors result in power fluctuations at the receiver [216 – 218]. Pointing <b>and</b> <b>tracking</b> errors are caused mainly by (a) satellite vibrations [218], (b) errors in the calculation of the point-ahead angle [4], and (c) beam wander effects [219]. Pointing <b>and</b> <b>tracking</b> errors may be reduced by using advanced automated control methods in the pointing <b>and</b> <b>tracking</b> element [4], while their impact may be dampened by allowing adaptive variations in the transmitted power [218] or a broader optical beam [220]. In earth-to-satellite communications pointing <b>and</b> <b>tracking</b> also suffer from fades in the atmosphere, and it is possible that re-acquisition of the beam is required after a fade, leading to extended capacity loss. Reference [221] discusses how inertial sensors can be utilized to counter-effect beam loss due to atmospheric fading.|$|R

Text {{detection}} <b>and</b> <b>tracking</b> is {{an important}} step in a video contentanalysissystemasitbringsimportantsemanticclueswhichisa vital supplemental source of index information. While there has been a significant amount of research done on video text detection <b>and</b> <b>tracking,</b> there are very few works on performance evaluation of such systems. Evaluations of this nature have not been attempted because of the extensive effort required to establish a reliable ground truth even for a moderate video dataset. However, such ventures are gaining importance now. In this paper, we propose a generic method for evaluation of object detection <b>and</b> <b>tracking</b> systems in video domains where ground truth objects can be bounded by simple geometric shapes (polygons, ellipses). Two comprehensive measures, one each for detection <b>and</b> <b>tracking,</b> are proposed <b>and</b> substantiated to capture different aspects of the task in a single score. We choose text detection <b>and</b> <b>tracking</b> tasks to show the effectiveness of our evaluation framework. Results are presented from evaluations of existing algorithms using real world data and the metrics are shown to be effective in measuring the total accuracy of these detection <b>and</b> <b>tracking</b> algorithms. ...|$|R

40|$|Airborne radars {{that track}} moving targets face the {{challenge}} of surveillance over large geographic areas where military vehicles are interspersed with civilian traffic. There is a major need to develop robust, efficient, and reliable identification <b>and</b> <b>tracking</b> techniques to identify selected targets, <b>and</b> to maintain <b>tracks</b> for selected critical targets, in dense target environments. Traditionally, <b>tracking</b> <b>and</b> identification have been considered separately; we identify a target first, <b>and</b> then we <b>track</b> it kinematically to sustain the identification. The difficulty with separate identification <b>and</b> <b>tracking</b> is that neither task is sufficient by itself to satisfy the demands of the other.
