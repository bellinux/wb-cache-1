The parties {{with an interest in}} the trust may have certain expectations and requirements of the trustee. The main responsibility and accountability ascribed to and expected of the trustee are for the proper maintenance and administration of the trust and its assets. The parties with an interest in the trust may be classified according to how closely involved or affected they are by the existence of the trust. The parties closest to the trust are listed as the founder, beneficiaries and co-trustees. Parties with a judiciary, legislative and administrative interest in the trust include the Master of the High Court, the High Court and the auditors as well as accountants of the trust. The parties with an interest in the trust may not be satisfied with the actions or performance of the trustee. These parties may seek <b>actions</b> <b>and</b> <b>remedies</b> to hold the trustee accountable. These <b>actions</b> <b>and</b> <b>remedies</b> may be found in legislation, the literature, common law or court judgements.

40|$|Traditionally, courts equated rights <b>and</b> <b>{{remedies}}.</b> Consequently, courts {{sought to}} provide remedies for {{the violation of}} statutory rights even if a statute did not contain detailed enforcement provisions. In the 1970 s, however, the U. S.

The Court 2 ̆ 7 s attempt to separate these inseparable concepts has led to considerable confusion because decisions focusing on only one part of the equation fail to acknowledge the impact on other parts.

The TSD offers minimum harmonisation and aims at promoting sharing of knowledge, and the exploitation of innovations on the Internal Market. The European Parliament adopted the TSD on April 14, 2016 and the EU Member States will have two years to implement it. The TSD includes a harmonised definition of a trade secret that builds on the definition provided in Article 39 of the TRIPS Agreement. Moreover, it also ensures the freedom of expression and information {{and the protection of}} whistle-blowers. Appropriate means of <b>actions</b> <b>and</b> <b>remedies</b> against unlawful acquisition, use and disclosure of trade secrets are also included, such as provisional and pecuniary measures, injunctions and corrective measures or allocation of damages. This study examines the protection of trade secrets in the course of litigation regulated in Article 9 of the TSD. Currently, the protection of trade secrets within the EU is fragmented especially in this regard, which makes companies reluctant to resort to litigation when a trade secret has unlawfully been misappropriated or it is suspected that a trade secret is being misused. The regulations in Article 9 expand only to the hearing in court. Such protection is welcomed and {{a step in the right}} direction. However, in my study I have found that in order for the protection to be sufficient there is a need to further establish measures to protect trade secrets during the entire process, from the filing of the claim to the end when the judgement is given.

40|$|In 1967, a {{helicopter}} carrying three passengers and a pilot returning from an offshore drilling platform {{crashed into the}} Gulf of Mexico beyond Louisiana 2 ̆ 7 s territorial waters, killing all aboard. The families of the decedents instituted a wrongful death suit in admiralty, seeking recovery under general maritime law, the Death on the High Seas Act (DOHSA), and the Jones Act. The federal district court found Mobil Oil Corporation, the owner and operator of the helicopter, negligent. In awarding damages the district court limited recovery to pecuniary losses, holding that a pecuniary loss limitation applied regardless {{of the theory of}} recovery. Specifically, the court denied plaintiffs recovery for loss of society damages. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed, holding that under recent Supreme Court and Fifth Circuit decisions, beneficiaries of a decedent wrongfully killed on the high seas could recover loss of society damages under general maritime law despite the pecuniary loss limitation of DOHSA. Because of conflicting decisions in the circuit courts of appeals regarding the precise limits of the cause of <b>action</b> <b>and</b> <b>remedies</b> for wrongful death under general maritime law, the Supreme Court granted certiorari and, reversing the court of appeals, held in Mobil Oil Corp. v. Higginbotham that nonpecuniary damages could not supplement DOHSA 2 ̆ 7 s pecuniary loss limitation; thus, the Court reinstated the district court 2 ̆ 7 s holding and denied recovery for loss of society damages. Consequently, DOHSA now provides the exclusive remedy for wrongful deaths occurring on the high seas. By so holding, however, the Court ignored the legislative history of DOHSA, which does not mandate this result. Moreover, Higginbotham not only restores various anomalies to maritime wrongful death actions that earlier decisions sought to eliminate, but also contravenes the humane policies of admiralty law. The Court 2 ̆ 7 s decision, therefore, retreats from the modem trend toward fashioning a uniform cause of <b>action</b> <b>and</b> <b>remedy</b> for maritime wrongful deaths and creates further confusion in maritime law...|$|R

50|$|What {{is meant}} by {{the title of this}} work is by no means clear. Haubold (de Edictis Monitoriis ac Brevibus, Leipzig, 1804) thinks that monitory edicts are not special writs of notice or summons {{directed}} to the parties {{in the course of a}} cause, but those general clauses of the edictum perpetuum which relate to the law of procedure, giving <b>actions</b> <b>and</b> other <b>remedies</b> on certain conditions, and therefore, tacitly at least, containing warnings as to the consequences of irregularity or nonfulfilment of the prescribed conditions. The fragments of Callistratus certainly afford much support to this view. Haubold distinguishes the edictum monitorium from the edictum breve, upon which Paulus wrote a treatise. The latter he supposes to consist of those new clauses, which, in process of time, were added as an appendage to the edictum perpetuum, after the main body of it had acquired a constant form.|$|R

40|$|For an effective, fair, {{just and}} {{equitable}} tax {{system to be}} established, certain fundamental principles have to be enforced to ultimately achieve a balance between government interests and taxpayers’ interests. The government is conferred {{with the power to}} tax which is derived from the Constitution. At first glance the government’s power to tax seems wide, but upon an analysis of the Constitution, one can note that the government’s power to tax is limited by certain structural, procedural and substantive limitations. By way of the Bill of Rights, the Constitution confers taxpayers with numerous rights which serve as the substantive limitations to the government’s power to tax. One of these fundamental taxpayers’ rights is the right of just administrative action, which is the sole focus of this dissertation. A right without a remedy to enforce same is of no consequence, and therefore the available remedy analysed is the remedy of judicial review which is regulated by the Constitution read together with PAJA and the Constitutional common law principles. The executive authority to tax vests in SARS, being an organ of state, which is headed by CSARS. Empowering legislation confers SARS, CSARS and other delegated SARS officials with the power to take decisions/exercise discretions. There are three types of empowering provisions which are differentiated, based on whether the <b>remedy</b> of objection <b>and</b> appeal is available to the taxpayer. Despite the availability of the <b>remedy</b> of objection <b>and</b> appeal, most decisions taken/discretions exercised by SARS and its delegated officials may amount to administrative action. The question which arises is whether taxpayers are equipped with a right <b>and</b> <b>remedy</b> to protect their interests from unlawful, unreasonable, and procedurally unfair exercise of such administrative action. S 33 of the Constitution confers taxpayers with the fundamental right of just administrative <b>action,</b> <b>and</b> to enforce this right, taxpayers would have to implement the remedy of judicial review. The mere availability of a right <b>and</b> <b>remedy</b> does not provide taxpayers with protection; thus in order for the right <b>and</b> <b>remedy</b> to provide taxpayers with protection against the administrative action taken by SARS and its delegated officials, taxpayers would have to prove that the right <b>and</b> <b>remedy</b> is applicable <b>and</b> enforceable in the circumstances. The aim of this dissertation is to determine whether the right of just administrative <b>action</b> <b>and</b> the <b>remedy</b> of judicial review is applicable and enforceable in the tax arena. For the right <b>and</b> <b>remedy</b> to be applicable and enforceable, certain substantive and procedural requirements must be satisfied, and therefore those requirements are analysed in the tax arena in this dissertation. The substantive requirements which need be complied with are: (a) the administrator must be subject to the provisions of PAJA; (b) the conduct of the administrator must constitute “administrative action” as defined in PAJA; (c) the “administrative action” must materially and adversely affect taxpayer’s rights or legitimate expectations and have a “direct, external legal effect”; and (d), the “administrative action” must be found not be “lawful, reasonable and procedurally fair”, and if so, a ground as contemplated in s 6 of PAJA must be applicable. The procedural requirements which needs be complied with are: (a) locus standi to institute judicial review proceedings; (b) time limitations in which judicial review proceedings must commence; (c) the exhaustion of all available internal remedies prior to the commencement of judicial review proceedings (unless there are exceptional circumstances); (d) that Rules regulating proceedings in terms of PAJA be established and determination of such Rules which will regulate judicial review proceedings until new Rules are promulgated. If, in the circumstances, the taxpayer can prove that he or she complies with all substantive and procedural requirements, then the right of just administrative <b>action</b> <b>and</b> <b>remedy</b> of judicial review is applicable and enforceable. It then needs to be established which forum would have the necessary jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the remedy of judicial review in the tax arena. There are two relevant Courts, namely the Tax Court and the High Court. The Tax Court has been established to adjudicate upon tax-related matters, whereas the High Court has inherent jurisdiction. It has been determined that in terms of the Constitution read together with PAJA, only a High Court or court with similar status may adjudicate upon judicial review. The Tax Court is a creature of statute and it has been held that the Tax Court does not have a similar status as the High Court. Case law has, however, previously held that the Tax Court has jurisdiction to review administrative <b>action</b> by SARS <b>and</b> its delegated officials. The leading case in this regard was, however, adjudicated upon in 1985, prior to the Constitution and PAJA having been promulgated. It therefore seems that the case law should be re-evaluated in light of the current Constitutional dispensation in which the Constitution is the supreme law. Finally, this dissertation provides a concise analysis of the powers which the forum having jurisdiction to adjudicate upon judicial review has to make orders. It is prudent to emphasise that this dissertation focuses on the position prior to 1 October 2012. On 1 October 2012 the Tax Administration Act 28 of 2011 (the TAA) came into force and effect. The TAA is relevant to some of the issues discussed in this dissertation. Where the TAA influences the issues, mention is made of the provisions of the TAA, but these are not discussed. Therefore a recommendation for further research is that this dissertation be re-evaluated in light of the provisions of the TAA. The most relevant provisions which the TAA caters for, which may influence the topic of this dissertation, is the establishment of the Tax Ombud and the conferring of a limited remedy of review upon SARS and its delegated officials, in addition to the <b>remedy</b> of objection <b>and</b> appeal.

Many scholars have debated the constitutionality and efficacy of affirmative action, the appropriateness of race-consciousness (from legal and social perspectives) and the legitimacy of structural judicial remedies for various types of discrimination. This paper will add to this literature by demonstrating the influence of conservative race politics and ideology on Court doctrine concerning affirmative <b>action</b> <b>and</b> other race-based <b>remedies.</b> In particular, this Essay will demonstrate that, consistent with broader political trends, the Court disfavors governmental usage of race as a remedy for discrimination but embraces affirmative action for diversity purposes. Yet, as ongoing litigation demonstrates, the countermovements to antiracism that oppose affirmative action seek to dismantle race conscious state <b>action</b> altogether, <b>and</b> given recent personnel changes on the Court, this more 2 ̆ 2 palatable 2 ̆ 2 justification for affirmative action, having escaped judicial invalidation in Grutter v Bolinger, faces judicial invalidation once again.
