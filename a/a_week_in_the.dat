5|$|The film's {{theatrical}} {{release was}} suppressed after <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States by Paramount Pictures {{out of concern}} of negative press after rumors began circulating that the film was racist.

Its first official American home video release came in December 2008 when The Criterion Collection released the original uncut film to DVD.|$|E
5|$|Babb, {{who gained}} notoriety for his various {{marketing}} gimmicks, occasionally had Leeds make appearances and give lectures at showings of the film. Babb often booked the movie as a midnight presentation twice <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same town; David F. Friedman, {{who would later}} use the film in his own double-billings, attributed the distribution plan to a film that was so low in quality that Babb wanted to cash in and move to his next stop as fast as possible.|$|E
5|$|Because Ratatouille is {{intended}} to be a romantic, lush vision of Paris, giving it an identity distinct from previous Pixar films, director Brad Bird, producer Brad Lewis and some of the crew spent <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city to properly understand its environment, taking a motorcycle tour and eating at five top restaurants. There are also many water-based sequences in the film, one of which is set in the sewers and is more complex than the blue whale scene in Finding Nemo. One scene has Linguini wet after jumping into the Seine to fetch Remy. A Pixar employee (Shade/Paint department coordinator Kesten Migdal) jumped into Pixar's swimming pool wearing a chef's uniform and apron to see which parts of the suit stuck to his body and which became translucent from water absorption.|$|E

It {{was the third}} tropical storm (including the April subtropical storm) and second hurricane of the 1992 season. Bonnie formed at high latitudes in the central Atlantic on September 17. Devoid of any real steering currents for much of its lifespan, it was nearly stationary for over <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> central Atlantic Ocean.

5|$|Icke met {{his first}} wife, Linda Atherton, in May 1971 at a {{dance at the}} Chesford Grange Hotel near Leamington Spa; she {{was working as a}} van driver for a garage. Shortly after they met, Icke had another of the huge rows he had started having with his father—always a domineering man, his father was upset that Icke's {{arthritis}} was interfering with his football career—so he packed his bags and left home. He moved into a bedsit and worked in a travel agency, travelling to Hereford twice <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> evenings to play football.|$|E
5|$|In 1936, Achebe entered St Philips' Central School. Despite his protests, {{he spent}} <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{religious}} class for young children, but was quickly {{moved to a}} higher class when the school's chaplain took note of his intelligence. One teacher described him as the student with the best handwriting in class, and the best reading skills. He also attended Sunday school every week and the special evangelical services held monthly, often carrying his father's bag. A controversy erupted at one such session, when apostates from the new church challenged the catechist about the tenets of Christianity. Achebe later included a scene from this incident in Things Fall Apart.|$|E

5|$|In some {{countries}} {{a highlight of}} the year for Scouts is spending at least <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> summer engaging in an outdoor activity. This can be a camping, hiking, sailing, or other trip with the unit, or a summer camp with broader participation (at the council, state, or provincial level). Scouts attending a summer camp work on Scout badges, advancement, and perfecting Scoutcraft skills. Summer camps can operate specialty programs for older Scouts, such as sailing, backpacking, canoeing and whitewater, caving, and fishing.|$|E
5|$|On 14 September, Spee {{decided to}} use his two armored cruisers to raid the British base at Apia; he sent Nürnberg to escort the squadron's colliers to the {{rendezvous}} location. At the Battle of Papeete on 22 September, Nürnberg {{and the rest of}} the East Asia Squadron bombarded the colony. During the bombardment, the French gunboat Zélée was sunk by gunfire from the German ships. Fear of mines in the harbor prevented von Spee from seizing the coal that lay in the harbor.

Margaret was a clever child, whose skills at reciting poetry or playing piano pieces were often displayed at town events and Sunday School outings.
