This low-energy regime results in three broadly intergradational modern subfacies: l) an intensely bioturbated inner flat of slightly sandy mud; 2) a wavy-bedded middle flat of clayey sandy silt; and 3) a ripple-laminated outer flat ofbioturbated sandy silt to silty sand. The mid-flat region is less distinctive sedimentologically than the mixed-flat subfacies of North Sea tidal flats, and flaser and lenticular bedding are rare. Well-developed intertidal drainage networks and landward salt marshes are absent. Vibracores reveal two additional sequences underneath e modern sequence, their contacts defined by scour horizons and shell concentrations. The basal sequence is characterized by irregularly oxidized, intensely-to-totally bioturbateed <b>argillaceous</b> <b>sediment</b> with scattered wavy beds and abundant in-situ plant roots.

The Ballagan Formation, {{which also includes}} lutltes and quartz arenites, lies stratigraphically between the Upper Old Red Sandstone end the Spout of Ballagan Sandstone: it constitutes the lower-most part of the Calciferous Sandstone Measures. Microscopic examination of thin sections showed that the carbonates comprise mainly three microfacies which are subdivided {{on the basis of}} fabric and crystal-size. Microfacies A is the finest-grained and from it the other two have diagenetically evolved; through neomorphism (Microfacies B), and metasomatism and segregation (Microfacies C). Microfacies B has resulted from multiple neomorphic stages as indicated by crystal-size variation. As a,. result of neomorphism, clay has concentrated In. the intercrystalline boundaries, leaving the new crystals slightly clearer than their precursors.

While the sedimentological and geomorphological influence of Palaeozoic embryophytes and other higher vegetation has been commonly inferred, {{the influence of the}} non-marine microbial matgrounds that preceded them has been less well studied. The ?Ediacaran-Cambrian Series Rouge of northern France and the Channel Islands is a rare example of a predominantly alluvial succession which exhibits both pre-vegetation sedimentary motifs and evidence for the existence of terrestrial microbial mats. The latter include likely microbial sedimentary surface textures, the enigmatic matground “pseudofossils” Aristophycus and Arumberia, and probable mat fragments and mat-related microtextures preserved in <b>argillaceous</b> <b>sediment.</b> The sedimentological characteristics of the Series Rouge are described and analysed in order to assess the role of microbial influences on pre-vegetation alluvial systems. Near ubiquitously trough-cross bedded sheet-braided facies, with rarely preserved channel-forms, indicate that alluvial sedimentation was dominated by in-channel dune migration, and depositional-dip exposures reveal the periodic downstream migration of complex bar-forms. Lateral accretion elements and minor discontinuous lenses of more argillaceous material are locally present. Thus, despite the evidence for matgrounds, sedimentary architecture was essentially ‘abiotic’. Using this evidence from the Series Rouge, we argue that the surficial cohesion provided by matgrounds did not exceed thresholds for reworking by hydrodynamic processes thus having little or no effect on their preserved sedimentary architecture.

40|$|Ductile {{deformation}} of overpressured, fine-grained, <b>argillaceous</b> <b>sediments</b> (“mobile shale”) is commonly invoked {{to explain the}} deformation style {{at the base of}} thin-skinned, gravitational detachment systems. The usage of “mobile shale” arose as a consequence of poor imaging on seismic reflection data, where low-resolution seismic intervals appeared ductile on a seismic scale (a thickening and thinning of the seismic interval). Acquisition of high-quality seismic reflection data from the Niger Delta provides an opportunity to investigate the internal structures within a basal detachment succession that is commonly referred to as the “mobile shale. ” Deformation within the basal detachment succession in down-dip compressional settings is characterised by brittle deformation. Thickening of the basal detachment succession occurs through contractional duplexes and stacked imbricates that have formed within the cores of detachment folds. In up-dip extensional settings, the formation of stacked master detachment faults and detachments, which splay off the pre-existing master detachment fault, incorporates structures that formed in the hanging wall of older, structurally lower detachment faults into the basal detachment succession. Plastic deformation that involves a complete loss of shear strength within the deforming sediment probably does occur. Such processes are invoked to explain the lateral redistribution of strata leading to the formation of a “shale weld” in down-dip compressional settings. The recognition of fault-related folding within detachment fold cores and the deformation imaged beneath a major listric fault system highlights the fact that end-member structural models do not always adequately capture the structural complexity at the base of gravitational detachment systems. Despite the overpressured signature of basal detachment successions composed of <b>argillaceous</b> <b>sediments,</b> overpressure is not synonymous with a wide-spread ductile deformation style.

40|$|The {{stress field}} at depth is a {{relevant}} parameter {{for the design}} of subsurface constructions and reservoir management. Yet the distortion of the regional stress field due to local-scale features such as sedimentary and tectonic structures or topography is often poorly constrained. We conduct a stress sensitivity analysis using 3 -D numerical geomechanical modelling with an elasto-plastic material law to explore the impact of such site specific features on the stress field in a sedimentary sequence of the Swiss Alpine foreland. The model's dimensions are 14 km × 14 km × 3 km and it contains ten units with different mechanical properties, intersected by two regional fault zones. An initial stress state is established involving a semi-empirical relationship between the ratio of horizontal to vertical stress and the overconsolidation ratio of <b>argillaceous</b> <b>sediments.</b> The model results indicate that local topography can affect the stress field significantly to depths greater than the relief contrasts at the surface, especially in conjunction with horizontal tectonic loading. The complexity and frictional properties of faults are also relevant. The greatest variability of the stress field arises across the different sedimentary units. Stress magnitudes and stress anisotropy are much larger in stiffer formations such as massive limestones than in softer argillaceous formations. The stiffer formations essentially carry the load of the far-field forces and are therefore more sensitive to changes of the boundary conditions. This general characteristic of stress distribution in the stiff and soft formations is broadly maintained also with progressive loading towards the plastic limit. The stress field in <b>argillaceous</b> <b>sediments</b> within a stack of formations with strongly contrasting mechanical properties like in the Alpine foreland appears to be relatively insensitive to changes in the tectonic boundary conditions and is largely controlled by the maximum stiffness contrast with respect to the load-bearing formations...|$|E

40|$|The depositional {{slope of}} the Sierra del Cuera, a Carboniferous (Bashkirian-Moscovian), high, steep-margined {{carbonate}} platform, provides excellent cross-sections of lithofacies zonations and associated stratal geometries. The steep (30 - 40 °) and nearly planar upper slope is dominated by massive sheet-like layers of microbial, cement-rich boundstone, which alternate with intercalations of red-stained bryozoan cementstone with crinoids and brachiopods. The slightly gentler (20 - 26 °) and concave-upward lower slope is characterized by clast-supported resedimented deposits. The upper slope extended from platform break to ca. 300 m water depth, whereas lower slope sediments were deposited in water depths up to 600 - 700 m, at which level the slope beds flatten to a few degrees (toe-of-slope) and interfinger with spiculitic and <b>argillaceous</b> basinal <b>sediments.</b> Between 250 and 450 m water depth, boundstones and breccias alternated in a transitional zone. The lower slope sediments include clast-supported breccias with radiaxial fibrous cement in interparticle space, mud- to clast-supported breccias with red-stained carbonate mud matrix and packstone to grainstone and rudstone beds. Most of the clasts comprise boundstone reworked from an upper slope setting and smaller grains are platform and slope derived. A pervasive submarine cementation occurs along the upper two-thirds of the flank and this stabilized the slope. Slope deposition is interpreted as follows. During active boundstone accretion, microbial boundstone layers slid off and formed breccia tongues extending from the lower upper slope down to the toe-of-slope. Rock falls and avalanches were generated whenever the shear strength of the substrate of loose (or partly lithified) sediment was exceeded. Upper-slope boundstone accretion and shedding, independent of the depth of light penetration, controlled most of the depositional processes on the slope. Cement-dominated intervals {{are considered to be}} related to early highstand (and/or flooding) phases. Relative sea-level fluctuations and/or associated changes in the water conditions are believed to be responsible for intervals of low boundstone production or cement precipitation. Whether the in situ boundstone and breccia are preferentially related to lowstand or highstand periods is, as yet, unclear. © 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|In many cases, {{when dealing}} with {{argillaceous}} fine-grained sedimentary rocks, the isotopic ages obtained from Rb–Sr whole-rock isochron calculations are of geological significance, {{despite the fact that}} the initial conditions of Sr isotopic homogenization are not fulfilled. To explain this, a mechanical mixing during deposition has been suggested, leading to an aggregate of mixed material with fairly uniform 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values, whatever Rb/Sr ratio is found in the analysed samples. This investigation of the behaviour of Rb and Sr during sedimentation and early diagenesis, involves study of more than 60 samples of fine-grained recent sediments from selected coastal localities of Brazil. The results indicate that pelitic samples from some recent to present-day transitional or shallow marine environments, such as the Jacarepagu´a tidal flat and the Amazonas River mouth, where halmirolysis could have occurred, may produce nearly horizontal best-fit lines in a Rb–Sr isochron diagram. Moreover, the initial isotopic 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios appear to be well above 0. 710. In open marine environments, such as the Campos Basin, where sampling was spread over more than 100 metres, exchanges between the <b>argillaceous</b> <b>sediments</b> and seawater potentially happen at low temperature, inducing a reduction of the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr isotopic composition of the sediments to nearly 0. 710. An almost horizontal best-fit line is produced for the entire stratigraphic section, independent of the sedimentation age. We believe that in similar environments such ‘zero age isochrons’ are maintained for some time, testifying to exchanges between the sediment and the interstitial fluids, before the onset of burial diagenesis. The above described studies on fine-grained and recent <b>argillaceous</b> <b>sediments</b> seem to confirm the production of horizontal best-fit lines in isochron diagrams, justifying the application of the Rb–Sr whole-rock method to pelitic sedimentary rocks. The nature of the material is critical. The pelitic sediments to be analysed should contain only very limited amounts of coarse clastic material (especially feldspars and mica fragments) and consist mainly of fine clay minerals in which smectites, illite and mixed layers illite–smectite largely predominate...|$|E
40|$|The bulk {{chemical}} composition of 257 <b>argillaceous</b> <b>sediments</b> from cores around the Japan Trench which were drilled during Legs 56 and 57 was determined and examined. These samples are generally enriched in SiO 2 and impoverished in MnO, compared with typical pelagic sediments. SiO 2 is {{negatively correlated with}} other oxides. Statistical treatment of data shows that pure silica varies inversely with TiO 2 and A 12 O 3. The silica was derived mainly from planktonic siliceous organisms such as diatoms and radiolarians. Siliceous tests of these organisms disappear during progressive diagenesis, but the resolved silica redeposited in the sediments and the total silica con-tent of the sediments remain constant. Higher SiO 2 in some samples {{may be due to}} increased volcanic glass content. On the west slope of the trench, much ferric iron was deposited but not oxidized. In con-trast to iron, manganese originally present in the sediments was ap...|$|E
40|$|Groundwater silcretes {{have been}} {{recognised}} recently as major terrestrial silicon sinks and yet their origins are poorly understood. This paper aims to further {{understanding of the}} micro-fabric, geochemistry and formation of groundwater silcretes, through detailed analyses of silcrete boulders from the South Downs, Sussex, UK. In-depth petrological investigations of silcrete blocks identified three varieties of silcrete across the study area (saccharoid, hard and pebbly conglomeratic or silcrete breccia), similar to those elsewhere in England. Silcrete fabrics were universally simple and preserved host material structures. Optically-continuous quartz overgrowths were the dominant cement and developed on framework grains {{in the absence of}} silt- and clay-sized particles. Finer grained silica cements occurred in isolated patches and as vein- or cap-like geopetal features. These caps and veins formed through the silicification of illuviated clay-rich material that entered the host sediment prior to, or in the early stages of, overgrowth formation. Titanium contents were related to the amount of fine-grained silica and appear to reflect variations in host material chemistry. Subsequent to silicification, the silcretes were altered by at least two phases of ferrunginisation, characterised by the ingress of iron minerals and partial fabric dissolution or replacement. The study reveals strong similarities in the micromorphology and geochemistry of groundwater silcretes in the study area and those developed in sandy host sediments in neighbouring parts of northwest Europe. Variations that do occur could be explained by differences in the host sediment, geological setting or tectonic history of the respective basins (or sub-basins), suggesting {{that there may be a}} common mechanism for silcrete formation across northwest Europe. Silcrete development appears to be related to the release of silica accompanying acid leaching of the host material or adjacent strata. In the South Downs, this probably resulted from oxidisation of pyrite in the <b>argillaceous</b> and lignitic <b>sediments</b> overlying the host sands. It is envisaged that palaeoenvironmental conditions were of limited importance for silcrete development and that there was no specific 'era' of formation, with phased development accompanying landscape evolution through the Neogene into the Pleistocene...|$|R
40|$|The Pigi and Karathodoro {{units are}} two {{continental}} blocks constituting the northernmost {{part of the}} Stip-Axios zone in Greece and are spatially closely related {{with members of the}} Guevgueli ophiolitic complex. They have been interpreted as disrupted rem­nants of the attenuated continental crust that floored the Cuevgueli marginal basin prior to its rifting during Late Jurassic. It is suggested that they preserve petrological e­vi­den­ce of all the stages of the formation of this basin behind a volcanic arc and above a sub­duction zone, that is: continental extension, basaltic underplating, heating and partial mel­ting of the thinned continental crust, intrusion of crustal, mantle or hybrid melts and finally rifting and formation of a/or a series of spreading centers within the marginal basin. A porphyritic metagranite, migmatized pelitic and semipelitic metasediments and am­phibo­lites constitute the basement of the two units. A magmatic complex of leuco­to­na­lites, pyroxene tonalites and monzogranites, biotitic microgranites, Kfs-cordierite-aplites, gra­nitoid and pegmatitic micro-cumulates and two main granitic bodies (Fanos and Pla­tania) intrude the two units. A subvolcanic sequence of olivine-basalts, basaltic ande­si­tes, trachyandesites, trachydacites and rhyolites also intrude the main lithologies. Ophicalcites, radiolarian <b>argillaceous</b> and silisic <b>sediments</b> as well as thermally me­ta­mor­phosed carbonates crop out at the northern and eastern part of the two units in contact with members of the Guevgueli ophiolitic complex. Migmatized metasediments are composed of three distinct parts: a mesosome of pe­litic or semipelitic composition, a melanosome (restite) which is the residual of me­so­so­me's partial melting and a leucosome of granitic composition with cordierite and/or andalusite. The main textural feature of stromatic migmatized metasediments is a folded planar fab­ric. The cordieritic leucosomes fill the gaps created by the extensional disruption of stro­matic migmatitic texture. The paragenesis of the dark zones of migmatized metasediments is: biotite + sillimanite + cordierite ± quartz ± garnet ± muscovite ± K-feldspar ± plagioclase ± opa­ques (hercynite, magnetite, ilmenite, pyrite) ± monazite ± zircon ± epidote ± apatite ± ru­tile and into more lighter ones is: quartz + plagioclase ± K-feldspar ± apatite ± cordierite. Pyroxene tonalites - granulites have the following paragenesis: plagioclase + hor­nblen­de + quartz ± orthopyroxene + opaques. Locally biotite, K-feldspar, cum­mi­n­gto­nite, orthite, chlorite, titanite and apatite may participate. Amphibolitic enclaves com­mon­ly hybridized and assimilated by tonalites have the paragenesis: hornblende + clino­pyroxene + plagioclase ± cummingtonite ± biotite ± quartz ± orthoclase ± magnetite ± chlorites ± titanite ± apatite. K-Ar and Rb-Sr radiometric age determinations in hornblendes and biotites of va­rious lithologies give Late Jurassic ages for the magmatic and migmatitic events. These ages are indicate exhumation and cooling around 148 M. a. The oxfordian age of argil­la­ceous sediments intercalated with the Evzoni lavas shows that the Guevgueli marginal ba­sin was spreading and was supplied with sediments from a nearby continental slope during Late Jurassic. ...|$|R
30|$|According to our in situ investigations, P 1 {{contains}} a {{thermal power plant}} (marked by the dashed oval), multiple industrial factories (marked by the dashed rectangle) and some residential quarters (marked by the dashed polygon). P 3 and P 4 mainly comprise industrial parks, whereas P 2 consists of residential quarters. The observed subsidence in these areas is caused by groundwater extraction for productive and domestic water needs. The aquifer {{in the study area}} was formed in the Neogene Period. This layer mainly belongs to the Neogene period and the Quaternary sedimentary formation period [4, 19]. Geologically, the aquifer is a thick clayey stratum consisting of grits and loose, or semi-loose <b>argillaceous</b> <b>sediments</b> [19]. Excessive exploitation of groundwater can result in severe water table depression. This depression further leads to interstitial water runoff and the consequence is aquifer compression which accounts for the subsidence. The heterogeneous subsidence observed in the study area (as shown in Fig.  3) is attributed to the various groundwater pumping intensities in different regions.|$|E
