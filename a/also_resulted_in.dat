5|$|Coimbatore and {{its people}} have a {{reputation}} for entrepreneurship. Though it is generally considered a traditional city, Coimbatore is diverse and cosmopolitan.

5|$|Damming of the Canning caused {{dramatic}} flow reductions {{that significantly}} altered downstream aquatic macroinvertebrate communities. The {{lack of water}} flow has <b>also</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> a poor flushing effect below the dam wall.

5|$|Lastly, British {{efforts to}} downplay and {{disguise}} {{the nature and}} impact of the revolutionary movement at this time <b>also</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> a policy designed to strengthen the moderate movement in India, which ultimately saw Gandhi's rise in the Indian movement.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the long}} term, {{residents}} lost {{significant amounts of}} income in the storm-affected areas, particularly farms in {{the year after the}} storm.

5|$|The Atlantic {{hurricane}} reanalysis project {{also indicated}} {{but could not}} confirm the presence of four additional tropical depressions throughout the season. However, the reanalysis added a previously undetected tropical storm in late October to the Atlantic hurricane database(HURDAT).

The most recent runway refurbishment was completed in 2002, in addition to the relocating one of the taxiways to prevent runway incursions.|$|E

5|$|Triton's {{eccentric}} post-capture orbit {{would have}} <b>also</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> tidal heating of its interior, {{which could have}} kept Triton fluid for a billion years; this inference is supported by evidence of differentiation in Triton's interior. This source of internal heat disappeared following tidal locking and circularization of the orbit.|$|E
5|$|A similar {{housing and}} land {{shortage}} existed in nearby Smethwick County Borough, which <b>also</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> the authority acquiring land from adjoining council areas. By 1914; the urban area of Bearwood had already {{spread over the}} border of Oldbury Urban District as far as Rathbone Road and Warley Park. A further adjustment of the county boundary took place in 1928 and on this occasion however, Staffordshire gained territory from Worcestershire at Warley Woods (See Fig 4). This enabled Smethwick to build new housing estates at Londonderry and {{to the west of}} Rathbone Road.|$|E

5|$|As a {{character}} in the games, Mewtwo's physical appearance is not its only stark divergence from Mew. While the alterations to the genetic source material it was cloned resulted in its abilities surpassing Mew's, it <b>also</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> Mewtwo developing a vicious personality that is primarily interested in proving its own strength. The franchise's non-video game media, particularly the anime, has expanded upon the character. In the most notable instance, Mewtwo telepathically speaks with a male voice and is existentially torn over its purpose in the world.|$|E
5|$|Bardanes's revolt {{temporarily}} weakened Byzantium, {{especially in}} its capability {{to deal with}} the Arab threat to the East, but Qasim's invasion was of limited scope, and his father's far larger intervention shortly after <b>also</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> no major military confrontations: Harun withdrew after a truce was concluded in exchange for a modest sum. Thus the revolt did not seriously affect the army or most of Anatolia. Nevertheless, it is indicative of the soldiers' dissatisfaction with Nikephoros, which would surface again in subsequent years and prove a constant source of trouble throughout his reign.|$|E
5|$|Besides meditation, Luang Pu Sodh {{promoted}} {{the study of}} Buddhism as well. In this combination {{he was one of}} the pioneers in Thai Buddhism. In 1939, Luang Pu Sodh set up a Pali Institute at Wat Paknam, which is said to have cost 2.5 million baht. Luang Pu Sodh financed the building through the production of amulets, which is common in Thai Buddhism. The kitchen which he built was the fulfillment of an intention which he had since his first years at Wat Pho, when he experienced difficulty in finding food. It <b>also</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> monks having more time to study the Dhamma.|$|E

5|$|In 1973, Oslo Sporveier again {{proposed}} {{closing the}} Ekeberg Line. This time {{the reason was}} {{the construction of the}} Oslo Tunnel and Oslo Central Station, which would involve construction work around Jernbanetorget. This proposal <b>also</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> a public reactions, and the same arguments from the mid-1960s were repeated. Again the suggestion to link the Lilleaker Line to the Ekeberg Line were launched. Oslo Sporveier calculated it would cost NOK3.6 million for investments, including rebuilding 20 Gullfisk trams, new rectifiers and new tracks. This was less than the necessary 30 buses needed for conversion to bus services.|$|E
5|$|Marine {{regression}} <b>also</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> {{the loss}} of epeiric seas, such as the Western Interior Seaway of North America. The loss of these seas greatly altered habitats, removing coastal plains that ten million years before had been host to diverse communities such as are found in rocks of the Dinosaur Park Formation. Another consequence was an expansion of freshwater environments, since continental runoff now had longer distances to travel before reaching oceans. While this change was favorable to freshwater vertebrates, those that prefer marine environments, such as sharks, suffered.|$|E

After a 1414 tie the next week against Pittsburgh, the Wolfpack won their next two games: at home against Wake Forest, and in Maryland against Maryland.|$|E
