40|$|High-frequency (HF) radars are {{routinely}} used for remotely sensing ocean surface currents. However, {{the performance of}} the most widely used direction-finding HF radar is degraded due to the effect of the inevitable <b>deviations</b> of actual <b>antenna</b> pattern on the direction of arrival (DOA) estimation. In this paper, we quantify the DOA estimation error resulting from the deviation of the actual antenna pattern from the ideal one. Theoretical analysis and field experiment results suggest that the ratio of the deviations for the two loops dominates the DOA estimation error. Thus, eliminating the effect of the <b>antenna</b> pattern <b>deviations</b> on DOA estimation error is transformed into eliminating the effect of this ratio. From this, a calibration method based on the time-averaged local spatial coverage rate (TLSCR) is proposed to reduce the effect of the <b>antenna</b> pattern <b>deviations</b> on current extraction, which uses the ideal antenna pattern to estimate the DOA of the echoes. To validate this proposed calibration method, we assess the radar-derived radial velocities by comparing with in situ observations. The comparison results indicate that the proposed TLSCR calibration method can effectively reduce the DOA estimation error and improve {{the performance of the}} direction-finding HF radar in current observation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{pointing}} of an <b>antenna</b> always exists <b>deviation</b> due {{to track}} deformation, gravity and thermal influence.

In {{order to get the}} <b>antenna</b> pointing <b>deviation</b> in the effects of the sunlight of 25 m antenna in Urumqi, we use the frame-typed level and thermometer to make a week’s measurement about the temperature around the antenna and the antenna tilt. The measured data was analyzed and combined with the track deformation data, and the pointing error fixed model as well as the thermal load deformation model were built. The measured data was fitted by the two models, and the result shows that the model can well reflect the pointing error and thermal load error, thus can give {{a better understanding of the}} antenna deformation, and also can give some good reference to antenna pointing calibration and the antenna’s reconstruction...|$|R

The main {{goal of this}} work is to propose a computationally efficient, accurate, and modular SAR raw data simulator {{that takes into account}} both the single and double scattering characteristics of an extended scene and the target. The numerical results show that GO-based reflectivity pattern estimation provides a sufficiently accurate computation of the SAR raw data in time-critical applications. We proposed a modular approach by giving the possibility to generate challenging scenarios like moving target and <b>antenna</b> angular <b>deviation</b> cases. In addition, we proposed a new time domain raw data simulation procedure that increases considerably the computational efficiency. For the future works, the method will be expanded to the more realistic airborne cases, like taking into account the positional instabilities of the aircraft.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to study the impact of the base station site {{locations}} and antenna orientations on UMTS radio network performance under different traffic distributions, and to find an optimum deployment strategy from 3 -sectored to 6 -sectored site solutions.

30|$|The {{main goal}} of our {{simulator}} is to evaluate different SAR image formation algorithms like Range Doppler, Chirp Scaling, and Omega-K. Unlike in [7, 9], Stolt interpolation or chirp scaling methods {{are not allowed}} for us to simulate raw data to evaluate the algorithms that utilize these methods. That is why, a time domain raw data simulation is proposed although the computational complexity heavily increases. However, this performance is also increased by proposing a novel method. Another reason of time-domain choice is the modularity advantage of these simulators. We also assessed the flexibility of our simulator in handling different scenarios like moving targets and <b>antenna</b> angular <b>deviations</b> and discussed the potentialities of the proposed work to cover the platform trajectory deviations and different waveform cases. Let us note {{that there is no}} efficient SAR raw data simulator that can fulfill such different scenario requirements.|$|R
30|$|As it {{is shown}} in Table 3, our {{proposed}} simulator and [14] are computing the exact raw data. Margarit et al. published a series of SAR raw data simulators regarding the polarimetry [21], interferometry, simulation of extended sea scenes [22], and analysis of urban areas [23]. In these papers, the raw data of small-sized vessels or urban areas are also computed however, the same procedure cannot be applied {{in the case of}} large scenes, as is the case for us, because of the range dependent range cell migration and azimuth chirp rate. That is why we determined the GRECOSAR's capability of SAR raw data simulation as only partially considered. Also this work considers the moving target case however neglects the fixed background. In terms of ground moving target detection and imaging, clutter rejection is an important procedure, and this clutter is the backscattering of the fixed scene. In our work, the raw data is simulated regarding both the fixed scene and the moving target. Another novelty of our simulator is the capability of handling the <b>antenna</b> angular <b>deviations.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{use of a}} {{holographic}} {{technique for}} accurately measuring the surface figure of the Tidbinbilla (Canberra, Australia) 64 -m antenna is described. Described by Bennet et al. (1976) and Scott and Ryle (1977), the technique consists of measuring the complex far-field response of the antenna at a single frequency using a terrestrial, satellite-borne or celestial radiation source of small angular diameter. This two-dimensional pattern is then Fourier transformed to yield the complex illumination function across the antenna aperture; <b>antenna</b> surface <b>deviations</b> are manifested as phase fluctuations in this function. The speed and low cost of using the technique are real advantages where observing schedules with the telescopes are heavily subscribed. For the 64 -m antenna, the unweighted rms surface deviation {{is found to be}} about 1. 8 mm; when weighted by the radial amplitude taper it is about 1. 1 mm. Two earlier estimates by other methods had yielded tolerances of about 1. 2 mm rms and 1. 1 mm rms. It is planned to use the technique to survey the 22 -m antennas of the Australian Telescope accurate to approximately 0. 1 mm rms near 10 Ghz...|$|R
40|$|Lack of {{knowledge}} prevents us from exactly calculating {{the behavior of}} electromagnetic fields. We study two extremes in this respect: scattering against randomly distributed particles (no idea of the position or orientation of the scatterers), and random errors in <b>antenna</b> technology (small <b>deviations</b> from what we think are the proper parameters). Random variables are used to model our lack {{of knowledge}}, and far field expressions are studied. Using the concept of characteristic functions from probability theory, results for arbitrary probability distributions are obtained. We explain an anomaly in the forward scattering direction in single scattering theory, present simple formulas for the directivity, side lobe level, and beam efficiency for a general array antenna with random errors, and a simple formula for the scattering coefficient from a general frequency selective structure with random errors...|$|R
30|$|Considering the {{responses}} of array antenna and RF cable do not vary so much over time and space, total responses including those of receivers are measured in a radio anechoic chamber. Strictly speaking, the radiation pattern of each antenna element, mutual coupling and deviation among RF cables should be properly calibrated. As far as this system employs a linear <b>antenna</b> array, the <b>deviation</b> of the radiation pattern of each antenna element cannot be eliminated by calibration processing since there exists cone ambiguity in the beamforming. Therefore we measured the calibration data only on the plane determined by the directional vector toward the maximum radiation pattern and the array axis. Moreover, the receiver is greatly affected by temperature, thus on-site calibration is necessary. For receiver calibration, we used the one-to-eight power divider calibrated by a vector network analyzer in advance.|$|R
40|$|The related {{tasks of}} image {{reconstruction}} and image restoration often result in ill-posed inverse problems. An effective method of solving such problems {{is the use}} of optimization algorithms to minimize an appropriate error function. However, for large or noisy data sets, such techniques may require a prohibitive amount of processing to obtain acceptable results. The inclusion of various constraints in optimization algorithms produces methods which are much more robust, yielding results of excellent quality in a reasonable amount of time. This thesis discusses two new algorithms which use such techniques to solve the problems of Limited View Tomography (LVT) and autofocus of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. ^ Transmission tomography is a method of forming an image corresponding to the density of a two-dimensional slice through and object from measurements of the average absorption of x-rays along various lines through the object. LVT is a special case of this problem in which the angular range and/or number of measurements are limited. Use of a version of the conjugate gradients algorithm with nonnegativity and hyperplane constraints produces reconstructions superior to those obtained with conventional techniques such as backprojection. ^ SAR is common remote sensing technique which images a strip of ground below an airborne radar <b>antenna.</b> Unknown <b>deviations</b> {{in the path of the}} antenna can degrade the quality of the reconstructed image. Phase Adjustment by Contrast Enhancement (PACE) is a novel algorithm which solves for these deviations by maximizing the contrast of the image produced. This is also accomplished with the conjugate gradients algorithm, modified by using a multiresolution constraint procedure. Further modifications increase the speed of PACE without a significant loss in image quality. ...|$|R
40|$|In the NASA/JPL Deep Space Network (DSN), radio science {{experiments}} (probing {{outer planet}} atmospheres, rings, gravitational waves, etc.) and very long-base interferometry (VLBI) require ultra-stable, low phase noise reference frequency signals at the user locations. Typical locations for radio science/VLBI exciters and down-converters are the cone {{areas of the}} 34 m high efficiency antennas or the 70 m antennas, located several hundred meters from the reference frequency standards. Over the past three years, fiber optic distribution links have replaced coaxial cable distribution for reference frequencies to these antenna sites. Optical fibers are the preferred medium for distribution because of their low attenuation, immunity to EMI/IWI, and temperature stability. A new network of Beam Waveguide (BWG) antennas presently under construction in the DSN requires hydrogen maser stability at tens of kilometers distance from the frequency standards central location. The topic {{of this paper is}} the design and implementation of an optical fiber distribution link which provides ultra-stable reference frequencies to users at a remote BWG antenna. The temperature profile from the earth's surface to a depth of six feet over a time period of six months was used to optimize the placement of the fiber optic cables. In-situ evaluation of the fiber optic link performance indicates Allan deviation on the order of parts in 10 (exp - 15) at 1000 and 10, 000 seconds averaging time; thus, the link stability degradation due to environmental conditions still preserves hydrogen maser stability at the user locations. This paper reports on the implementation of optical fibers and electro-optic devices for distributing very stable, low phase noise reference signals to remote BWG <b>antenna</b> locations. Allan <b>deviation</b> and phase noise test results for a 16 km fiber optic distribution link are presented in the paper...|$|R
40|$|Deep {{hyperthermia}} is {{a treatment}} used in concurrence with radiation therapy or chemotherapy {{in the treatment}} of deep seated tumors. In hyperthermia, tumor temperatures are elevated 3 to 7 oC above normal body temperature, up to a temperature of 44 oC. In a randomized trial, the 3 year overall survival of cervical cancer patients was almost doubled by adding hyperthermia to radiotherapy. There is a clear dose-effect relation in hyperthermia, and therefore increasing the temperature in the tumor is an important factor to further increase survival rates in cervical cancer. Until recently, hyperthermia treatments in Rotterdam were performed by aiming a focus point that was calculated using a cylindrical representation of the patient. Because of the inhomogeneous nature of a patient, this representation is far from accurate. For the 4 antenna Sigma 60, the calculated focus point may still be close to the optimum, but for applicators with more antennas, and a high number of degrees of freedom, this approach will certainly be inadequate. Originating in the 1970 ’s, electromagnetic numerical and thermal modeling of 3 D structures is currently possible with a precision and speed that is sufficient for routine use. When the electromagnetic and thermal properties of a patient are known, the energy and thermal distributions can be calculated for each antenna of the applicator. With this information, the interference pattern can be determined, dependent on phase and amplitude of the emitted signals by the antennas, and thus can be optimized. When performing these patient specific calculations, i. e. treatment planning, and optimizations, the resulting settings can be applied on-line in the clinic. This thesis covers the clinical introduction of hyperthermia treatment planning, the assessment of the various uncertainties that should be taken into account, and the results of clinical implementation. Optimization The successful application of hyperthermia treatment planning requires optimization routines that optimize the SAR distribution in such manner that the eventual dose in the tumor is maximized. In chapter 2, various SAR based goal functions were assessed. This assessment showed that a goal function taking into account hotspot minimization as well as maximization of the SAR in the tumor has the highest probability to lead to high tumor temperatures. Eventually, two goal functions were chosen for clinical assessment: average tumor SAR normalized on whole body average SAR (Opt 1), and hotspot tumor quotient (HTQ), the ratio between SAR in the 0. 1 th percentile and the tumor SAR (Opt 2). Further, the concept of complaint adaptive steering is tested, i. e. local reduction of SAR in case of patient discomfort by adapting the goal function. The phantom test and a sensitivity study in 10 patient models, show that complaint adaptive steering is most effective in peripheral complaint regions. Clinical evaluation in two groups of five patients shows that time between complaints is longer using Opt 2 (p= 0. 007), i. e. a higher comfort of the patient during treatment. It does, however, not yet lead to significantly different temperatures [T 50 ’s of 40. 3 (Opt 1) vs. 40. 1 oC (Opt 2) (p= 0. 898) ]. From this study we concluded that complaint adaptive steering is feasible in terms of SAR-reduction in complaint regions and in time consumption. Moreover, complaint adaptive HTP guided steering has the potential for further improvement and thus higher temperatures, when the degrees of freedom are increased, i. e. in more advanced applicators. Opt 2 (i. e. HTQ) is used in further clinical application, because of better complaint reduction and control. Uncertainties The clinical use of hypethermia treatment planning can be influenced considerably by various uncertainties. These uncertainties are either related to the reproduction of the model setup in the clinic (e. g. positioning, water bolus shape, <b>antenna</b> signals), or <b>deviations</b> of patient tissue properties from literature values, and cause differences in heating between model predictions and the actual patient. In chapter 4, we investigated the influence of positioning uncertainties on power deposition in the Sigma 60 applicator. Position inaccuracies of less than 1 cm appear not to affect SAR patterns relevantly. Current positioning precision is sufficient in the X (right-left) -direction but precision measurements are needed to reach the desired accuracy in the Y (anterior posterior) -direction. In chapter 5, a closer look was taken at the influence of tissue parameter uncertainties on the tumor SAR and temperature levels for 20 patient models. A Monte Carlo analysis, simulating many uncertainty scenarios, shows a variation of HTQ of approximately 25 % (interquartile range) and a variation of 0. 7 to 1 oC (interquartile range) for temperatures, due to the uncertainties in tissue parameters. Difference between the Sigma 60 and Sigma Eye applicators however, still remain significant (p< 0. 001 for SAR and temperature distributions). The additional benefit that could be expected from temperature modeling is canceled out by the uncertainties. This means that SAR modeling is sufficient, as long as uncertainties persist. Moreover, these results show that with uncertainty reduction, the potential of HTP guided steering can be increased considerably...|$|R
