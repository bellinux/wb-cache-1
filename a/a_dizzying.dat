5|$|Umran {{was first}} given {{the command of}} the 5th Brigade in Homs, but was {{promoted}} in June to become commander of the 70th Armoured Brigade. As head of the Bureau of Officers' Affairs, Jadid appointed friends to senior positions, purged his enemies and appointed several Ba'athists to senior positions. Ahmad Suwaydani, {{one of the new}} members of the Military Committee, was appointed Head of Military Intelligence and Mazyad Hunaydi became Head of the Military Police. The Military Academy at Homs was put under Ba'athist control—several hundred Ba'athists, including Assad's brother Rifaat al-Assad, were given a crash course in military teaching before being given command. Assad became the de facto head of the Syrian Air Force, <b>a</b> <b>dizzying</b> promotion for a man in his thirties. Considering that the members of the Military Committee were all too young to be perceived as the real leaders of Syria by the populace, the Military Committee appointed Colonel Amin al-Hafiz to the post of Minister of the Interior.|$|E
25|$|Bach {{published}} or carefully compiled in manuscript many {{collections of}} pieces that explored {{the range of}} artistic and technical possibilities inherent in almost every genre of his time except opera. For example, The Well-Tempered Clavier comprises two books, each of which presents a prelude and fugue in every major and minor key, displaying <b>a</b> <b>dizzying</b> variety of structural, contrapuntal and fugal techniques.|$|E
25|$|Within a few years, <b>a</b> <b>dizzying</b> {{assortment}} of technologies {{were being used}} by hundreds of producers all over the western world. Steam, electricity, and petrol/gasoline-powered automobiles competed for decades, with petrol/gasoline internal combustion engines achieving dominance in the 1910s. Dual- and even quad-engine cars were designed, and engine displacement ranged {{to more than a}} dozen litres. Many modern advances, including gas/electric hybrids, multi-valve engines, overhead camshafts, and four-wheel drive, were attempted, and discarded at this time.|$|E

25|$|In the 1880s, {{fields of}} natural gas were {{discovered}} across much of east-central Indiana, and Grant County began to grow at <b>a</b> <b>dizzying</b> pace. Gas City and Matthews were carved out of raw farmland and launched as speculative boom towns, each absorbing existing tiny villages. They attracted several thousand residents before the gas failed and most industries left. As late as the 1940s, Matthews resembled a Western ghost town, before it attracted eleven glass factories and seduced the professional baseball team away from Indianapolis. Grant County's only covered bridge remains there as {{a link to the}} past.|$|E
25|$|In {{tropical}} or fusion rock, Bersuit Vergarabat rose to {{the zenith}} of the genre. Libertinaje (1998) catapulted the band to the top, and to tours of the Americas and Europe. The follow-up Hijos del Culo (2000) also went double-platinum. Both albums display <b>a</b> <b>dizzying</b> range in style versatility. From the side of reggae-rock Los Pericos and Los Cafres dominated. Ska had Los Calzones and Kapanga, but by 2000 Los Fabulosos Cadillacs had called it quits to their internationally renowned career of rock with ska, rap, reggae, and Latin. La Mosca and Dancing Mood reached achieved greater popularity. Illya Kuryaki and the Valderramas produced some catchy, original, and danceable music (a mix of rock, hip-hop, and Latin) which cemented their fan base all over the Americas, until the duo's separation in 2001.|$|E
25|$|Theatrical {{evolution}} continued, sometimes tied to {{the lives}} and deaths of royal patrons. Queen Anne's Men disbanded {{with the death of}} Anne of Denmark in 1619; the accession of a new queen in 1625 saw the creation of Queen Henrietta's Men. Occasionally there were other new companies like Beeston's Boys, and new theatres like the Salisbury Court. The two prolonged closings of the London theatres due to plague, in 1625 and 163637, caused significant disruption in the acting profession, with companies breaking apart, combining and re-combining, and switching theatres, in <b>a</b> <b>dizzying</b> confusion. (Only the King's Men were exempt.) Political suppressions also came along in the Stuart era, though they affected only single offending companies until a general political suppression closed the theatres from 1642 to 1660, and brought the age of English Renaissance theatre to its end.|$|E

25|$|Leavitt {{continued}} {{to publish the}} eponymous almanac after he moved to Meredith. He had already founded a newspaper in 1811, while still living in Gilmanton, which he called The New Hampshire Register, and which he continued publishing for several years (181117). The Register became well-known thanks to Leavitt's habit of printing brief synopses of historical events. On the side, between farming, teaching school, and publishing his newspaper, Leavitt wrote and published at least eight textbooks on mathematics, grammar, astronomy, geography and music, including an edition of Nicolas Pike's widely distributed A New and Complete System of Arithmetic in 1826, {{as well as the}} staple textbooks of teachers across the nation The Scholar's Review and Teacher's Daily Assistant. The scores of textbooks produced by Leavitt, <b>a</b> <b>dizzying</b> array of titles down the years, including Complete Directions for Parsing the English Language; Or, The Rules of Grammar Made Easy: Being a New Grammatical Essay, Designed as a Supplement to Lindley Murray's Grammar, for the Use of Students as Soon as They Begin to Parse, make one wonder where Leavitt found the time.|$|E

500|$|Leonard Klady of Variety commended the animation's [...] "... razzle-dazzle {{technique}} and unusual look" [...] and that [...] "the camera loops and zooms in <b>a</b> <b>dizzying</b> fashion that fairly takes one's breath away." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times compared the film's innovative animation to Disney's Who Framed Roger Rabbit, saying that [...] "both movies take apart {{the universe of}} cinematic visuals {{and put it back}} together again, allowing us to see in a new way."

500|$|... "Beautiful, Dirty, Rich" [...] {{received}} general acclaim from critics.

[...] Genevieve Koski of The A.V.

500|$|In Mojos The Beatles' Final Years Special Edition (2003), Peter Doggett {{acknowledged}} the comparative rarity of [...] "It's All Too Much" [...] within the Beatles canon and added: [...] "Yet it's {{one of the}} pinnacles of British acid-rock, its sleepwalking rhythm retaining a bizarrely contemporary feel today." [...] Having included the track in his 2011 list of Harrison's [...] "10 Greatest Beatles Songs", Joe Bosso of MusicRadar commented: [...] "At times the song seems to drift away with Harrison's dreamy verses, but just as quickly it's chopping down trees with explosive percussion and thunderous handclaps. Wild guitar breaks by both Harrison and John Lennon help to make It's All Too Much <b>a</b> <b>dizzying</b> treat." ...|$|E

[...] Furthermore, she argued that [...] "Finn's coming-of-age {{story and the}} exploration of the post-apocalyptic plotline" [...] as featured in the miniseries [...] "are handled just as deftly as any other subject—with fun and a tinge of sorrow." [...] Zach Blumenfeld of Paste Magazine gave Islands a slightly more mixed, albeit still positive, review.

[...] However, Sheffield called the omission of [...] "Angel" [...] "just plain crazypants." [...] Lean Greenblatt from Entertainment Weekly commented that the album [...] "holds up surprisingly well". Joey Guerra from Houston Chronicle praised the album saying [...] "every song on Celebration defines a moment in time, a radio sing-along, a twirl under the glitterball. It's a pulsing testament to Madonna's often-overlooked pop prowess, from the scrappy electro beginnings of 'Everybody' and 'Burning Up' to the retro-disco swirl of 'Beautiful Stranger' and 'Hung Up', still a hands-in-the-air highlight." ...|$|E

500|$|Marrakesh has {{the largest}} {{traditional}} Berber market in Morocco {{and the image of}} the city is closely associated with its souks. Paul Sullivan cites the souks as the principal shopping attraction in the city: [...] "A honeycomb of intricately connected alleyways, this fundamental section of the old city is a micro-medina in itself, comprising <b>a</b> <b>dizzying</b> number of stalls and shops that range from itsy kiosks no bigger than an elf's wardrobe to scruffy store-fronts that morph into glittering Aladdin's Caves once you're inside." [...] Historically the souks of Marrakesh were divided into retail areas for particular goods such as leather, carpets, metalwork and pottery. These divisions still roughly exist but with significant overlap. Many of the souks sell items like carpets and rugs, traditional Muslim attire, leather bags, and lanterns. Haggling is still {{a very important part of}} trade in the souks.|$|E
500|$|The Scotsmans Robert McNeil {{thought that}} the premiere was [...] "shocking, but also rather slow, as {{characters}} are established. Maybe it'll get better.

[...] Similarly opinionated was The Cincinnati Posts Rick Bird, who said that like other HBO series, Rome [...] "takes {{a while to get}} going. After the first episode you will mostly be confused with <b>a</b> <b>dizzying</b> array of characters, intrigue and subplots. Hang in there. By the second episode things take shape and one should be hooked by episode three with this steamy romp through antiquity and its lusty intrigue." [...] Bird found some positive elements; the episode, he said, was [...] "enhanced by marvelous filmmaking including elaborate sets and costumes. Small-screen film art has rarely painted such a realistic picture of ancient Rome." ...|$|E
500|$|Jordan Sowunmi of Exclaim! {{stated that}} the album excels when Hopsin [...] "focuses on {{external}} obsessions: ode to amateur skating 'Nollie Tre Flip' has the most enticingly offbeat rapping on the album, as well as <b>a</b> <b>dizzying</b> internal rhyme scheme, while 'Turn on the Lights' analogue 'Dream Forever' is heartfelt and raw." [...] David Jeffries of AllMusic praised the album's consistency for providing [...] "shocking lyrics and infectious hooks", highlighting 'Rip Your Heart Out' featuring Tech N9ne as a standout track. Dominick Grillo of DJBooth noted that Hopsin's [...] "technical passionate wordplays offer constant comparisons to Eminem", concluding that the album is [...] "a dark, often violent creative response to the pressure now resting on Hopsin's shoulders", conceding that {{there are moments when}} Hopsin [...] "weighs himself (and the audience) down with layers upon layers of negativity", though admitting that the album [...] "works best when Hopsin is either angrily fighting or humorously poking fun at some sort of ludicrosity." ...|$|E
