5|$|Despite much speculation, {{there is}} no {{definitive}} explanation of either Linnaeus fils or Herbert's thinking. For instance the 'Knight's Star' {{has been compared to}} Linnaeus' decoration as <b>a</b> <b>Knight</b> of the Order of the Polar Star. The Latin word equestris (of <b>a</b> <b>knight,</b> or horseman) may have been confused with equi (of a horse), or possibly Herbert was making a literary Knight's Move on the Linnaean term. The flower name has even been compared to the mediaeval weapon, the spoked mace or Morning Star which it superficially resembles.|$|E

5|$|Administrative Headquarters, AIF, {{and against}} the {{opposition}} of Birdwood, Senator Pearce appointed McCay as commander of the AIF Depots in the United Kingdom. These depots received and trained reinforcements arriving from Australia, and rehabilitated and retrained convalescents who were released from hospital. McCay established his headquarters at Tidworth, {{in the heart of}} the Salisbury Plain where most of the Australian camps were located. He occupied this post for the remainder of the war, failing in bids to return to an active command at the head of the 5th Division, the Australian Corps, or the 3rd Division when Monash was promoted to corps commander. A bid to replace Birdwood as administrative commander of the AIF also came to naught. For his services in the United Kingdom, McCay was mentioned in despatches a fourth time, made <b>a</b> <b>Knight</b> Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1918, and <b>a</b> <b>Knight</b> Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1919.|$|E
