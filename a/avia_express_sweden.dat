5000|$|The airline was {{established}} in 1987 and was previously known as Avia. It acquired Salair on 15 July 1991 and Highland Air in March 1997. A partnership was forged with Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) which acquired a 25% stake in April 1998. The owners were Salenia (72.7%), SAS (25%) and Janus (2.3%). The operational division of Skyways was separated from the sales division in 2009. During 2010 there was some restructuring regarding ownership. SAS sold {{its share of the}} company at a loss, and eventually it was acquired by the asset management company Manswell Enterprises Limited, controlled by Ihor Kolomoyskyi. In 2011 Skyways merged with another Manswell controlled company, the Gothenburg-based airline City Airline, as Skyways. It also bought the Danish airline Cimber Sterling and developed the intention to become Scandinavia's biggest regional airline. [...] As of December 1, 2010 the operation, sales and marketing of the airline functioned again as one unit under <b>Avia</b> <b>Express</b> continuing the use of the brand Skyways.|$|R

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on {{expressions}} of bereavement and religious coping in medieval miracle stories from Sweden. The stories come from the collections of St. Birgitta (Bridget) of Sweden, the Blessed Bishop Nicolaus Hermanni (Sw.

This theoretical foundation has provided new insights into how parental grief was <b>expressed</b> in medieval <b>Sweden</b> – and in stark contrast to Continental research on the same topic. Parents of both sexes expressed their grief outwardly through tears and crying, and a reluctance to accept that their children were dead. Throughout the miracle stories, lay people constructed their own prayers for miraculous intervention without the aid of any priests. This makes fathers and mothers in medieval Sweden agents of their own in terms of praying to God and being able to construct their own forms of religious coping...|$|R

Inclusion criteria for the articles were that they would be peer reviewed, written in english, published from 2012 onwards, refer to students 6 - 18 years and include occupational therapy interventions conducted in schools. The results show that most studies were from the United States and Canada, but also Australia, Ireland and the United Kingdom were represented. The results indicated four areas that occupational therapists work in. These were children with special needs, cooperation between occupational therapists and teachers, after school programs and handwriting.

A discourse analysis was used to study this phenomenon. The empirical information was gathered by using three semi-structured, qualitative interviews with four professionals working with individuals with disabilities directly or indirectly. The theoretical framework consists of the view of social constructivism on sexuality and disability and Rubin’s model of hierarchy in sexuality. The study shows that there is only a little or no discourse of disabilities and sexuality in the Swedish society.

40|$|The {{arrival of}} e-books in Swedish {{libraries}} has {{been influenced by}} the ideas of provisions of equal access to all media and all Swedish citizens as well as by librarians’ wish to provide best service to their users within the library’s area of responsibility. They saw this new resource and service in the light of fulfilling their specific function in a democratic society that is usually <b>expressed</b> in <b>Sweden</b> as mediation (or transfer) of knowledge and culture to all. This is a common foundation, on which new media and information resources (including e-books) are incorporated into Swedish academic and public libraries. Apart from this common basis we see other similarities in work with e-books in both types of libraries, but also a number of differences. Most of them relate to the situation of libraries within their respective context and in relation to their specific role. Academic libraries are quite influential players in the global scholarly communication and supporters of both research and study processes. As such they are embedded in mainly international market of scientific information and scholarly materials. They have significant resources provided by parent universities for acquisition and a wide choice of commercially available material from different producers and vendors. They are organized into a national library consortium that has increased negotiation power. Thus, they have more freedom to experiment with a variety of business and pricing models offered on the international market. They also have high competence in the area of publishing and often play a role of a publisher themselves. Their involvement in research process and in open access initiatives puts them in a position to provide expertise to researchers in publishing and intellectual property areas. Public libraries are part of local cultural and educational landscape. As such they depend on the production of media and content in national languages that helps to cater to the needs and demands of the local population. They also are customers on a relatively small market of publishing, entertainment and education-related materials that help to fulfil their function in the enlightenment of the people. As public libraries offer open and free-of-charge access to their resources to the totality of the population in a particular territory, eventually covering the whole country, they are regarded as a disruptive player in the market economy. This perceived threat from public libraries was reborn in the emerging market of e-books. Despite these differences both academic and public libraries face similar challenges and problems in management of their collections, creating metadata, and providing access to them. So far, no such solutions that could satisfy all involved parties have been found. Sponsorship : Vetenskapsrådet</p...|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} low birth weight as {{a risk factor for}} retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) that will require treatment in correlation with gestational age at birth (GA). In total, 2941 infants born < 32 weeks GA were eligible from five cohorts of preterm infants previously collected for analysis in WINROP (Weight IGF-I Neonatal ROP) from the following locations: <b>Sweden</b> (<b>EXPRESS)</b> (n =  426), North America (n =  1772), Boston (n =  338), Lund (n =  52), and Gothenburg (n =  353). Data regarding GA at birth, birth weight (BW), gender, and need for ROP treatment were retrieved. Birth weight standard deviation scores (BWSDS) were calculated with Swedish as well as Canadian reference models. Small for gestational age (SGA) was defined as BWSDS less than - 2. 0 SDS using the Swedish reference and as BW below the 10 th percentile using the Canadian reference charts. Univariate analysis showed that low GA (p< 0. 001), low BW (p< 0. 001), male gender (p< 0. 05), low BWSDSCanada (p< 0. 001), and SGACanada (p< 0. 01) were risk factors for ROP that will require treatment. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, low GA (p< 0. 0001), male gender (p< 0. 01 and p< 0. 05), and an interaction term of BWSDS*GA group (p< 0. 001), regardless of reference chart, were risk factors. Low BWSDS was less important as a risk factor in infants born at GA < 26 weeks compared with infants born at GA ≥ 26 weeks calculated with both reference charts (BWSDSSweden, OR =  0. 80 vs 0. 56; and BWSDSCanada, OR =  0. 72 vs 0. 41). Low BWSDS as a risk factor for vision-threatening ROP is dependent on the infant's degree of immaturity. In more mature infants (GA ≥ 26 weeks), low BWSDS becomes a major risk factor for developing ROP that will require treatment. These results persist even when calculating BW deficit with different well-established approaches...|$|R
40|$|Around the 1950 s an {{explosive}} population growth {{started in the}} Third World. Parallel with the population growth a global network grew up advocating population control and limited population growth. Sweden had a unique place in that network through a pioneering role promoting {{the issue in the}} UN organization. During the 20 th century Sweden was a pioneer country in terms of initiatives for population control. Ceylon family planing pilot project was something new in a time when other donors considered family planning be too controversial area for bilateral aid projects. The aim of this thesis is to answer ”What is the affinity between the ideological principles behind the Swedish welfare policy and the Swedish initiatives to population control?" and "Does <b>Sweden</b> <b>express</b> a unique overpopulation discourse influenced by the ideological principles behind the Swedish welfare policy?"In the thesis I examine whether it is an affinity between the Swedish welfare ideology and the Swedish initiative to population control. I do this partly by examining how Alva Myrdal – one of the ideological architects behind the swedish welfare state – implemented ideological principles in an international political context and partly how the welfare state's ideological principles took expression in the swedish family planing aid. I also investegating whether it is possible to interpret an overpopulation discourse shaped by the experiences of Swedish welfare policy and what in that case characterizes it. By using  the concept ”governmentality” I distinguishes different key actors in the swedish family planing organisation and thereby I problematize the concept overpopulation discourse. The thesis demonstrates fragmented perceptions within the swedish family planing organisation where a prophylactic line inspired by the welfare ideologies end up getting preference based on its benefits to get political legitimacy. The prophylactic line promoted to change peoples preferences towards population control instead of using coercion which has ideological affinity with the Swedish welfare policy. One of my conclusions is that local circumstances in South Asia like high rate of illiteracy and ” widespread apathy” (not my expression) among the locals made key actors in the family planing aid sceptical towards the efficency of using profylactic policies in the third world. That partly explains the swedish family planing aid shift towards suporting more coercive methods during the 1960 s. Keywords: Alva Myrdal, Ceylonproject, Welfare ideology, Population control, govermentality, overpopulation discourse, 20 th century. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study on}} how school children in Kenya and <b>Sweden</b> <b>express</b> their views on children’s rights, in particular rights related to participation, non-discrimination, and education. The overall purpose was to explore the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, its claim to be universal and its relevance for children in various school and life contexts. Group {{interviews were conducted with}} 58 children, aged 12 - 15 years, from four schools, two schools from each country. The interviews were introduced with an exercise of nine articles from the UN Convention which the groups were asked to discuss and rank from the most to the least important. The aim of the exercise was to make the UN articles known to the children and to open up for a conversation about rights. The theoretical framing for the study is anchored in the tradition of sociology of childhood. Analyses of empirical data were based on the cultural politics of childhood, and the concepts vulnerability and separability. Accordingly, children are viewed as sharing the common experience of being children, but also as experiencing diverse everyday lives. They are regarded as social agents, whose voices carry perspectives important to be listened to. They are also looked upon as able to form and express their views and knowledge in relation to local economical, social and political conditions. The results showed that the children talked about themes and situations that were both common and diverse. They talked more about children’s needs than about children’s rights. Needs for ‘extended’ protection were particularly expressed, i. e. the importance of stable relationships with parents and other adults and peers. The study also showed that when issues on relationships with adults, participation and decision making were discussed, the children expressed experiences of being viewed as subordinated in a way that could be referred to as their inherent and structural vulnerability. A third important result showed that values and norms related to non-discrimination were largely produced and reproduced in peer-cultures. Finally, the children connected education to economical growth, for individuals as well as for societies. The overall conclusion from the study is that children view the UN Convention as a problem solver for children in exposed situations rather than as a document for their everyday life. From a child perspective, rights hold relational qualities, manifested in relationships with adults and peers. Furthermore, the study underlines that the young right holder is a ‘both-and’ child: both global and local, both being and becoming, and both dependent and independent...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to make visible a field of {{conflicting}} narratives of modern <b>Sweden</b> <b>expressed</b> by different political groups and to contribute to the working through of the conflict of interpretation. Four political challenges to the established success story of Sweden's development from a poor society to modern welfare state, are analysed: the Left in the 1960 s, the new Women's movement in the 1970 s, the Alternative movement and the Environmental Party in the late 1970 s and early 1980 s and, finally, the liberal challenge of the Moderates in the 1980 s. The general questions are: What narratives about modern Sweden were developed by the different political groups? What kinds of criticism against modern Sweden did the different political groups express? The empirical analyses also aim to throw light on two more general questions: What is a plausible narrative of modern Sweden? How should the plausibility of narratives be discussed and assessed? The source material consists mainly of political magazines and to some extent of political programs and publications related to the different political groups. A perspective on historical narratives inspired by Jörn Rüsen and a method for analysing historical narratives are developed. Narratives are seen as ways of expressing criticism and orienting practice, making the present comprehensible {{in the light of the}} past in order to be able to confront the future. With inspiration from Charles Taylor, orientation and understanding one's identity is explained as finding out one's standpoint in relation to important places in a landscape of values and what goal is worth pursuing. In the landscape of modernity, narratives of modernity interpret a certain society's past, present and possible or probable future directions of development and express criticism, hopes and fears. In this study, the most important goals and directions in the landscape are made up by the ideals inherent in enlightenment, romanticism and the different political ideologies. The narratives that are analysed include narratives of modern Sweden as a bourgeois, centralist, authoritarian and capitalist society (the "New Left"), as a monopolistic-capitalist, fascist society (the Marxist-Leninists), as a monopolistic-capitalist and patriarchal society (the Marxist feminists), as a society dominated by a technological, rationalist and male culture (the women's culture feminists), as a conventional, technocratic, growth oriented society (the alternative movement), and as either a liberal and individualistic society threatened by collectivist and totalitarian socialism or a collectivist, socialist or Social Democratic and almost totalitarian society (the Moderates). Most of the criticism of modernity was directed against either the lack of democracy or excessive rationalism. Other dimensions of the critique of modern Sweden are the lack of community, warmth, authenticity, beauty, meaningfulness, ideological commitment and individual responsibility. A critique of instrumental rationality and objectification can be found in all of the groups, directed against capitalism, socialism, technocracy or patriarchy. In the last chapter, it is argued that assessing narratives involves questions about how a certain society and its direction of development should be evaluated, what problems and conflicts are most relevant, the plausibility of solutions and future goals and the plausibility of the self-understanding expressed and the relationship to other actors/groups. It is suggested that more comprehensive narratives can be achieved through reflection on the viewpoints implied in particular narratives and a gradual widening of perspective. In order to contribute to a historically well-motivated, balanced, just and non-discriminatory practice, both defenders and critics of modern Sweden ought to be included in the narrative and visions of the future ought to be able to take earlier criticism into account...|$|R
40|$|Background: Non-profit {{organizations}} {{have a large}} and significant role in Swedish society and Thunberg (2006) choose to <b>express</b> it like <b>Sweden</b> stops without nonprofit effort. But in several non-profit organizations, and then perhaps especially in sports, there exist problems with the economy. Tate (in Vermeer, Raghunandan & Dana, 2009) explains that the audit of non-profit organizations differs from the audit of for-profit companies as they often have differences in culture, organizational structure, financial requirements, accounting standards, financial reporting, financial statements and the auditor's risk environment. While the audit is different, {{it should also be}} noted that in the vast majority of non-profit organizations, there are no statutory requirements for audit, but despite this, 99 % of all non-profit {{organizations have}} some form of audit regulated by their statute (Lundén & Lindblad, 2011). Meanwhile, several Swedish sport federations began using more and more of the elite licenses for clubs which play in the highest and higher series. Purpose of the study: With this study, we want to describe and analyze the auditor and the audit's role and influence in sports. The aim is also to develop a study to understand whether the auditor is of importance for survival and sports club building and the fulfillment of their goals. This has been a contributing factor to our research question: What is the auditor and the audit's role and influense in Swedish non-profit sports clubs and what is their significance in the sports association's work with economic goals versus goals of achievements? Method: We chose to conduct a qualitative study and has worked with an inductive approach. In this study, we have chosen to focus on two groups of respondents in our empirical data collection: sports and auditors in sports. We interviewed three sports clubs and four auditors. Results and conclusions: We believe this completed study say that the auditor is an important part of sports associations in Sweden. By being able to be of assistance to them as there always exists knowledge that is needed to make important decisions for the association. We also find that although the purpose and aim of the activities of sports associations and the companies are different, this do not change the auditor's role in any substantial way, but work on the same basic principles of business. However, independence is something that can be questioned in several clubs as it seems, without that auditors put any more emphasis on it.  Bakgrund: Ideella föreningar har en stor och betydande roll i det svenska samhället och Thunberg (2006) väljer att uttrycka det som att Sverige stannar utan ideellt engagemang. Men i flera ideella föreningar, och då kanske framförallt i idrottsföreningar, existerar det problem med ekonomin. Tate (i Vermeer, Raghunandan & Dana, 2009) förklarar att revision i ideella föreningar skiljer sig från revision i vinstdrivande företag då de oftast har skillnader i kultur, organisationsstruktur, finansiella behov, bokföringsregler, finansiell rapportering, finansiella uttalanden och revisorns riskmiljö. Samtidigt som revisionen skiljer sig åt bör det även observeras att i de allra flesta ideella föreningar finns det inga lagstadgade bestämmelser om revision, men trots det har 99 % av alla föreningar någon form av revision som regleras i stadgarna (Lundén & Lindblad, 2011). Samtidigt har flera olika svenska idrottsförbund börjat använda sig mer och mer av elitlicenser för föreningar som spelar i den/de högsta respektive högre serien/serierna. Syfte: Vi vill med studien beskriva och analysera revisorn och revisionens roll samt påverkan i idrottsföreningar.

Detta har varit en bidragande faktor till vår forskningsfråga: Vilken är revisorns och revisionens roll samt påverkan i svenska ideella idrottsföreningar och vad har det för betydelse på idrottsföreningens arbete med ekonomiska kontra sportsliga mål? Metod: Vi valde att utföra en kvalitativ studie och har arbetat med en induktiv ansats.
