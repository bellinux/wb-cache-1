25|$|On May 2, 2009 {{during the}} rookie mini-camp, the Cowboys <b>air-supported</b> <b>roof</b> {{practice}} field (a tent-like structure) collapsed during a storm {{that turned into}} a microburst. At {{the time of the}} incident, there were around 70 people inside (team personnel, coaches, rookie players and media), leaving 12 people injured. The most serious injuries were suffered by scouting assistant Rich Behm, who was left paralyzed from the waist down after his spine was severed, DeCamillis, the special teams coach, fractured one of his cervical vertebrae and Greg Gaither, the assistant athletic trainer, sustained a fracture to the tibia and fibula in his right leg. The facility was completely destroyed and was never rebuilt. After the incident fallout, Summit Structures, its parent company Cover-All Building Systems and the consulting firm JCI (helped design reinforcements) all filed for bankruptcy after serious structural flaws were found with the construction and manufacturing of the facility.|$|E
2500|$|The Metrodome's <b>air-supported</b> <b>roof</b> was {{designed}} by the inventor of air-supported structures, David H. Geiger, through his New York-based Geiger Berger Associates, and manufactured and installed by Birdair Structures. An air-supported structure supported by positive air pressure, it required 250,000ft³/min (120 m³/s) of air to keep it inflated. The air pressure was supplied by twenty 90-horsepower fans. The roof was made of two layers: the outer layers were Teflon-coated fiberglass and the inner was a proprietary acoustical fabric. By design, the dead air space between the layers insulated the roof; in winter, warm air was blown into the space between layers to help melt snow that had accumulated on top. At {{the time it was}} built, the [...] of fabric made the roof the largest expanse ever done in that manner. The outside Teflon membrane was 1/32 of an inch thick and the inner liner of woven fiberglass was 1/64 of an inch thick. The entire roof weighed roughly 580,000 pounds. It reached , or about 16 stories, at its highest point.|$|E

5000|$|While {{an adjunct}} {{professor}} at Columbia University, Geiger designed the enclosure for the United States pavilion at Expo 70 in Osaka, Japan. He had been tapped after the architecture firm Davis Brody won the design contest for the building. Davis Brody's winning design was a 30-story high air filled [...] "pumpkin" [...] atop the pavilion and they needed an engineer with the expertise to implement it. Geiger was designing for Japan's earthquakes and typhoons when Congress approved {{only half of the}} expected budget. To accommodate the new budget, he drastically cut the proposed height and used a low profile cable-restrained <b>air-supported</b> <b>roof,</b> employing a super-elliptical perimeter compression ring and diagonally-run pattern of cables which prevented fabric sag around the perimeter. [...] Geiger's fabric <b>air-supported</b> <b>roof</b> invention was significantly cheaper than the largest fixed dome structure of the day: the Astrodome.|$|E

50|$|Formerly an <b>air-supported</b> structure, {{numerous}} <b>roof</b> collapses led to {{it being}} replaced by a $13.7 million steel roof in 2001.|$|R
50|$|Among {{its many}} uses are: sports and {{recreation}} facilities, warehousing, temporary shelters, and radomes. The structure {{can be either}} wholly, partial, or roof-only air supported. A fully air-supported structure can be {{intended to be a}} temporary or semi-temporary facility or permanent, whereas a structure with only an <b>air-supported</b> <b>roof</b> can be built as a permanent building.|$|E
5000|$|Students often {{refer to}} the {{building}} simply as [...] "The Bubble" [...] due to the <b>air-supported</b> <b>roof,</b> {{which is one of}} the most recognizable landmarks on the campus and in Jersey City. The Bubble covers five roof-top tennis courts and a jogging track. The tennis nets can be removed to provide facilities for indoor athletic practices as well as a venue for intramural sporting events.|$|E
5000|$|Dedmon Center is a 3,800-seat {{multi-purpose}} {{arena in}} Radford, Virginia. It {{was built in}} 1981 and {{is home to the}} Radford University Highlanders basketball team. The Center is named after Dr. Donald Dedmon, a former Radford university president. It was the tenth <b>air-supported</b> <b>roof</b> built in the United States. The air-supported fabric roof was removed during a major renovation in April 2008 and replaced with a fabric roof supported by steel trusses.|$|E
5000|$|The {{company is}} now {{regarded}} in Japan {{as one of the}} [...] "Big Five" [...] contractors ranked with Kajima, Obayashi, Shimizu and Taisei, and {{has a long history of}} designing buildings. The firm has built some of the most important buildings in Japan, including the Tokyo Tower, the Tokyo Dome (the first large-scale stadium with <b>air-supported</b> membrane <b>roof</b> in Japan), the Fukuoka Dome (Japan's first large-scale stadium with retractable roof), and the Kobe Meriken Park Oriental Hotel among others.|$|R
50|$|He {{then joined}} with {{engineer}} Horst Berger to form Geiger Berger Associates {{and they went}} on to produce designs for a series of low cost air-supported structures including the first tensegrity type dome for the Olympic Gymnastics Venue, Seoul, Korea (which had been inspired by the work of R. Buckminster Fuller), first translucent insulated fabric roof at Lindsay Park Sports Centre, Calgary, Alberta, Canada, first “permanent” low profile <b>air-supported</b> fabric <b>roof</b> to cover a stadium at the Silverdome in Pontiac, Michigan.|$|R
5000|$|Tension {{membrane}} {{design has}} depended upon computers, {{and the increasing}} availability of powerful computers resulted in many developments being {{made in the last}} three decades of the 20th century. Weather-related deflations of some <b>air-supported</b> <b>roofs</b> led David Geiger to develop a modified type, the more rigid [...] "Cabledome", that incorporated Fuller's ideas of tensegrity and aspension rather than being air-supported. The pleated effect seen in some of these domes is the result of lower radial cables stretching between those forming trusses {{in order to keep the}} membrane in tension. The lightweight membrane system used consists of four layers: waterproof fiberglass on the outside, insulation, a vapor barrier, then an acoustic insulation layer. This is semitransparent enough to fulfill most daytime lighting needs beneath the dome. The first large span examples were two Seoul, South Korea, sports arenas built in 1986 for the Olympics, one 93 meters wide and the other 120 meters wide. The Georgia Dome, built in 1992 on an oval plan, uses instead a triangulated pattern in a system patented as the [...] "Tenstar Dome". The Millennium Dome was completed as the largest cable dome in the world with a diameter of 320 meters and uses a different system of membrane support, with cables extending down from the 12 masts that penetrate the membrane. The first cable dome to use rigid steel frame panels as roofing instead of a translucent membrane was begun for an athletic center in North Carolina in 1994.|$|R
50|$|The stadium {{opened on}} June 19, 1983 and was built as an indoor {{structure}} with an <b>air-supported</b> <b>roof,</b> {{the largest of}} its kind in the world upon its opening. Following the 2010 Winter Olympics, BC Place was closed for 16 months as part of an extensive revitalization, the centrepiece of which was replacing the inflatable roof with a retractable roof supported by cables. Once construction was completed, the stadium's new roof was also the largest of its type.|$|E
50|$|BC Place {{has been}} {{described}} {{as one of the most}} beautiful stadiums in all of North America and the Crown Jewel of the CFL. TSN analyst and former CFL player Chris Schultz praised both the design and engineering of the new stadium. Columnist Brian Hutchinson has praised the renovations for significantly improving the acoustics, and providing a bright and airy feel to the stadium. These were aspects that were missing in its previous <b>air-supported</b> <b>roof</b> incarnation, as well as the Montreal Olympic Stadium and the Rogers Centre (formerly SkyDome).|$|E
50|$|As {{important}} as the <b>air-supported</b> <b>roof</b> projects was Geiger Berger's work in pioneering long-span cable, tensile membrane, and tensegrity structures. Among the notable structures engineered by Geiger Berger are the tensile membrane Hajj Terminal which in 2010 won the AIA 25-Year Award; the first tensegrity type dome which was built for the Olympic Gymnastics Venue in Seoul, Korea; and the world's first translucent insulated fabric roof for the Talisman Centre, Calgary. In addition, Geiger Berger {{was involved in the}} development of structural fabric materials such as Teflon PTFE coated fiberglass.|$|E

The big advance it offers is permanency. The team of DuPont, Chemical Fabrics and Birdair have collaborated on a number of fabric structures. Some are supported by air pressure, others by cables alone. Most of the structures are in the recreational category. With conventional construction costs still on the upswing, you're likely to see a great many more permanent facilities enclosed by the aerospace spinoff fabric...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{lightweight}} roofs {{for long}} span structures has become popular. Architects find these structures attractive because they {{allow for a}} wide scope of innovative design, and can be cost effective and aesthetically pleasing. Although extensive research has already been devoted to many aspects of lightweight structures, this thesis examines the effects of wall openings on self-supported roofs backed by cavities, {{the nature of the}} response of <b>air-supported</b> <b>roofs</b> to turbulent wind, and theoretical methods for response prediction.;The first part of the study comprises a free vibration analysis of self-supported, lightweight roofs backed by cavities with openings. A simplified theoretical approach is formulated to evaluate the modal parameters of the roof-air system considering air leakage through the openings, the pneumatic stiffness, and the structural and acoustical damping of the system. The accuracy of the approximate formulae is assessed by comparison with a complex eigenvalue analysis. An exact solution is derived to evaluate the modal parameters for a circular membrane roof backed by a cavity with openings. Closed form solutions are presented for the damped response of circular membrane roofs backed by cavities with openings.;Free vibration laboratory experiments were conducted on two different structural models to verify the theoretical approach. The first model had a membrane roof, and the second had a flexible plate roof. The effects of wall openings and volume scaling on the roof-air system were examined and the experimental results were then compared with the theoretical ones.;The second part of the study is an examination of the behaviour of air-supported structures. The free vibration of cylindrical and spherical air-supported structures is investigated analytically for different internal pressures and enclosure volumes and the results are compared with those obtained from a finite element solution.;Wind tunnel tests were conducted on an aeroelastic model of a hemispherical, air-supported structure to investigate the wind-induced response and the internal pressure fluctuations. Parameters considered in the aeroelastic experiments included different gradients wind speeds, exposures, enclosure volumes and internal pressures.;A semi-analytical approach is established for predicting the wind-induced response of air-supported structures. This approach depends on external pressure measurements and static deflections. A rigid hemispherical model was tested in a boundary layer wind tunnel to measure the external pressures for different exposure conditions. For different internal pressures, the static deflections were calculated theoretically using the finite element method. The predicted response results of the semi-analytical approach agree well with the experimental results...|$|R

The 80, 000 -seat "Silverdome" is the world's largest fabric-covered structure-and aerospace technology played {{an important part in}} its construction. The key to economical construction of the Silverdome-and many other types of buildings-is a spinoff of fiber glass Beta yarn coated with Teflon TFE fluorocarbon resin. The big advance it offers is permanency. Fabric structures-tents, for example have been around since the earliest years of human civilization. But their coverings-hides, canvas and more recently plastics-were considered temporary; though tough, these fabrics were subject to weather deterioration. Teflon TFE-coated Beta Fiberglas is virtually impervious to the effects of weather and sunlight and it won't stretch, shrink, mildew or rot, thus has exceptional longevity; it is also very strong, lightweight, flame resistant and requires no periodic cleaning, because dirt will not stick to the surface of Teflon TFE. And to top all that, it costs only 30 to 40 percent as much as conventional roofing...|$|R
50|$|In 1994, the <b>air-supported</b> <b>roof</b> {{collapsed}} in a snowstorm. Since this had occurred {{on numerous occasions}} before, it {{was replaced by a}} more permanent metal roof. Prior to November 18, 2006, the basketball, volleyball and wrestling team utilized the UNI-Dome, before the construction of the McLeod Center. The McLeod Center is directly south of the UNI-Dome and connected by a covered walkway. The UNI-Dome attendance record for football is 17,190, which was set on October 17, 2009, during a Panthers homecoming game against the Missouri Valley rival Southern Illinois.|$|E
50|$|Work on the {{retractable}} roof {{began in}} May 2010, {{shortly after the}} completion of the 2010 Winter Paralympics and the final deflation of the <b>air-supported</b> <b>roof.</b> The official budget for the completed Phase 1 upgrades plus the revitalization project was $514 million. The new roof, a cable-supported retractable roof system first used with the Commerzbank-Arena in Frankfurt, Germany, is the largest of its kind. The opening measures 100 by 85 m, {{the same size as the}} field below. The fabric roof retracts into and is hidden by a pod in the centre of the opening, above the suspended videoboard.|$|E

They needed a structural engineer with the expertise to implement their design and they turned to Dr. Geiger. [...] In {{order to meet the}} lower than expected budget passed by Congress, Geiger changed the design and invented the low profile cable-restrained <b>air-supported</b> <b>roof.</b> [...] The success of the Osaka Pavilion led to a surge in the design and construction of air-supported roofs.|$|E
50|$|On January 5, 2007, snow {{accumulated}} on the <b>air-supported</b> Teflon Fibreglass <b>roof,</b> despite strict zero {{accumulation of}} ice guidelines and ice accumulation structural warnings. The accumulation caused {{a tear in}} the roof's ETFE-coated fabric close to Gate G {{on the south side}} where the roof meets the top of the concrete bowl. The tear grew quickly as air escaped through it, whereupon maintenance staff performed an intentional, controlled deflation to protect the integrity of the roof's intact fabric panels. As it was designed to do, the deflated roof rested on its steel support cables 6 metres (20 ft) above the seating and the field. Normally, the roof had a rise of 27 metres (90 ft) above the top of the bowl when inflated. No one was injured during the incident, although rain and melted snow flooded the bowl and subsequently had to be pumped out.|$|R
50|$|A {{different}} {{take on the}} multipurpose concept {{can be seen in}} the Saitama Super Arena in Japan and U Arena, a stadium set to open in 2017 near La Défense in the inner suburbs of Paris. Both venues are similar to the Carrier Dome in that they are fully enclosed stadiums (though with fixed roofs instead of the Carrier Dome's <b>air-supported</b> <b>roof)</b> that can accommodate field and indoor court sports. However, they differ from the Carrier Dome in the specific way they accommodate court sports. Both the Super Arena (used mainly for basketball, volleyball, mixed martial arts, and professional wrestling events) and U Arena (the future home of rugby union's Racing 92) feature movable seating blocks that allow each facility to serve as an appropriately sized venue for either field or court sports.|$|E

5000|$|Tensegrity domes, {{patented}} by Buckminster Fuller in 1962, are membrane structures consisting of radial trusses made from steel cables under tension with vertical steel pipes spreading the cables into the truss form. They {{have been made}} circular, elliptical, and other shapes to cover stadiums from Korea to Florida. While the first permanent air supported membrane domes were the radar domes designed and built by Walter Bird after World War II, the temporary membrane structure designed by David Geiger to cover the United States pavilion at Expo '70 was a landmark construction. Geiger's solution to a 90% reduction in the budget for the pavilion project was a [...] "low profile cable-restrained, <b>air-supported</b> <b>roof</b> employing a superelliptical perimeter compression ring". Its very low cost {{led to the development}} of permanent versions using teflon-coated fiberglass and within 15 years the majority of the domed stadiums around the world used this system, including the Silverdome in Pontiac, Michigan. The restraining cables of such domes are laid diagonally to avoid the sagging perimeter found to occur with a standard grid.|$|E
5000|$|In Canada, smaller, more {{specialized}} stadiums have generally become more popular, {{but none of}} the major multiple-use stadiums of the 1970s and 1980s have been demolished [...] The Toronto Blue Jays shared Rogers Centre with the Toronto Argonauts of the CFL before the Argonauts moved to BMO Field after the 2015 season, and shared the facility on a part-time basis with the Buffalo Bills of the NFL for several years beginning in 2008. [...] Before their 2015-16 move, the Argonauts had publicly announced plans to leave Rogers Centre twice, only to end up staying; during that time, the originally soccer-specific BMO Field (built on the site of multi-purpose Exhibition Stadium) was built by Toronto FC. The Blue Jays presently do not have any plans to leave Rogers Centre; the Argonauts had proposed renovating BMO Field so they could share it with Toronto FC (which they did in 2016), and the Bills sought to end their sharing agreement with the Rogers Centre and return to playing all of its games in Buffalo and ultimately did so after the 2013 season. BC Place in Vancouver is still used by the BC Lions and was also the Olympic Stadium for the 2010 Winter Olympics; the Lions played their 2010 season at the temporary Empire Field while BC Place was being renovated to replace the original <b>air-supported</b> <b>roof</b> with a retractable roof. The Vancouver Whitecaps, which entered Major League Soccer in 2011, shared Empire Field and are sharing the renovated BC Place with the Lions. This was intended to be a temporary arrangement until the MLS team could build their own Whitecaps Stadium, but local opposition to the planned stadium has led the Whitecaps to make BC Place a long-term home. The Montreal Expos' owners often cited the inadequacy of Olympic Stadium as a reason for the team's financial troubles, which eventually led to relocation to Washington, D.C.. The Montreal Alouettes, who had folded twice before in Olympic Stadium, moved out of Olympic Stadium in its third incarnation to Molson Stadium. In soccer, the original Montreal Impact built the smaller Saputo Stadium, which was expanded to accommodate the team's 2012 entry into MLS. Both the Alouettes and Impact continue to use Olympic Stadium for playoff games and other special events when extra capacity is needed. Commonwealth Stadium in Edmonton received major upgrades to host the 2001 World Championships in Athletics, and continues to host the Edmonton Eskimos, but is not hosting the new soccer team, FC Edmonton, which began play in 2011.|$|E
