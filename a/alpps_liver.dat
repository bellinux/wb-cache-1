40|$|A gold {{standard}} {{for the treatment of}} metastases of colorectal cancer in the liver is combined treatment with postoperative or perioperative chemotherapy. Despite the improvement of antitumor drugs, the main condition for the successful treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer is the operation in a radical volume, implying a macroscopic and microscopic absence of a residual tumor. The main contraindications to anatomic resections of the liver include a marked decrease in liver function, insufficient volume of the remaining parenchyma of the liver, and for a long time, bilobar liver damage was considered, which excludes the possibility of simultaneous removal of all foci. The traditional variant of the surgical solution of the problem of bilobar metastatic liver injury is the implementation of two-stage anatomical resections. It has been proved that the reduction of liver and FLR functional reserves of less than 20 % at normal and 40 % in the case of compromised liver parenchyma, the implementation of surgical interventions is associated with a high risk of hepatic insufficiency. One of the promising ways to overcome this obstacle is to perform various modifications of <b>ALPPS</b> <b>liver</b> resections. In the present work, we present a clinical case of performing a two-stage liver resection according to the type of ALPPS in a patient with metastatic colorectal liver cancer who had previously undergone PVL with unrealized vicar hypertrophy. The described observation testifies to the justification of performing repeated liver resections in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and demonstrates the possibilities of ALPPS technique. </p...|$|E
40|$|Associating liver {{partition}} and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (ALPPS) induces a rapid and extensive increase in liver volume. The functional quality of this hypertrophic {{response has been}} called into question because ALPPS {{is associated with a}} substantial incidence of liver failure and high perioperative mortality. This multicenter study aimed to evaluate functional liver regeneration in contrast to volumetric liver regeneration in ALPPS, using technetium- 99 m hepatobiliary scintigraphy and computed tomography volumetry, respectively. Patients who underwent ALPPS and hepatobiliary scintigraphy in 6 centers were included. Hepatobiliary scintigraphy data were analyzed centrally at the Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam according to established protocols. Increase in liver function as measured by hepatobiliary scintigraphy after stage 1 of ALPPS was compared with the increase in liver volume. In addition, we analyzed the impact of liver function and volume on postoperative outcomes including liver failure, morbidity, and mortality. In 60 patients, future liver remnant volume increased by a median 78 % (interquartile range 48 - 110) during a median 8 (interquartile range 6 - 14) days after stage 1, while function as measured by hepatobiliary scintigraphy increased by a median 29 % (interquartile range 1 - 55) throughout 7 days (interquartile range 6 - 10) in the 27 patients with paired measurements. After stage 2 of <b>ALPPS,</b> <b>liver</b> failure occurred in 5 / 60 (8 %) patients, severe complications in 24 / 60 (40 %), and mortality occurred in 4 / 60 (7 %). In ALPPS, volumetry overestimates liver function as measured by hepatobiliary scintigraphy and may be responsible for the high rate of liver failure. Quantitative liver function tests are highly recommended to avoid post hepatectomy liver failur...|$|E
