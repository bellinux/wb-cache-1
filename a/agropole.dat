40|$|Utilization of {{technology}} in agriculture makes it productive and promissing, contributing to its development. Investiments done by Govern of CearÃ¡ in agriculture have concentrate mainly on irrigated agriculture, through the agropoles, prevailing fruit-growing, banana {{being one of the}} chief crops. Banana crop performs an important role for cearense agriculture, however, it is generally characterized by low productivity, low technological level and large losses in production. The objective {{of this study was to}} measure the technological level of the irrigated banana crop in <b>Agropole</b> Cariri and to verify which are the factors conditioning the technological adoption. The calculated index showed that the technological index adopted in banana crop is classified as good. Technologies of irrigation and phytosanity have adoption level classified as optimum and the ones of the seedlings, adubation and cultural traits as good. Harvest and post-harvest technologies levels are classified as regular and the ones of management as insufficient. Socioeconomic variables such as technical assistence, banana crop as main activity, credit, scholarship, age, land owning, income, and place of dwelling contribute positively to increase the probability of producer to adopt the adequate technology in banana crop. Technology adoption, Banana crop, <b>Agropole</b> Cariri, Research and Development/Tech Change/Emerging Technologies,...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to {{evaluate}} the shelf-life of five yellow melon hybrids (AF- 5107, AF 6742, AF- 9136, AF and AF- 6798 - 7719) produced in the Mossoró-Assu <b>agropole.</b> The yellow melon hybrids were grown in soil fertilized and irrigated following the demand of culture. Reaching the stage of commercial maturity, fruit were harvested and brought to the Postharvest Laboratory at the Universidade Federal Rural do Semi-árido, where were taken 12 fruits at random for characterization of each hybrid at time zero. Afterwards the other fruits were weighed, identified and stored in cold room regulated at 10 ± 1 ºC and 90 ± 2 % RH, where they remained for 14, 21, 28, 35, 42 and 49 days. At each time interval, the following analyses were realized: mass loss, external and internal appearance, pulp firmness and soluble solids. The experimental design was completely randomized in factorial scheme 5 x 7, five hybrids and seven periods of storage. We used four replications, and the experimental unit consists of three fruits. There was significant interaction between hybrid and storage period only for the soluble solids. For the other characteristics evaluated, we observed the isolated effect of the main factors. The hybrid AF- 9136 stood out compared to other hybrids tested by greater pulp firmness and soluble solids...|$|E
