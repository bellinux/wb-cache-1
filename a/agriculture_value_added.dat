Agricultural growth has been the key element associated with economic development of Pakistan, {{despite the fact that the}} share of agriculture in GDP has fallen from 53% in 1947 to 21% in 2006-07. The share of Sindh province in Pakistan's <b>agriculture</b> <b>value</b> <b>added</b> accounts roughly for 25 percent. Sindh is typically rich in rangeland resources (about 55% of its land surface). The share of agriculture in Sindh GDP, which was 30% in 1999-2000, is estimated to have drastically declined to about 20% during the last five years due to a variety of physical, sociological and institutional framework factors. One of the main institutional constraints in Sindh is the highly skewed land ownership pattern and defunct tenancy system.|$|E

Noting {{that many of the}} world’s hungry are smallholder farmers, it is clear that food insecurity is closely linked to the livelihood strategies of these farm households. As previous studies have shown, food insecurity is linked to livelihood assets, strong institutional support and a favourable external environment. In particular, the paper finds that food security depends on cereal output, budgetary support to <b>agriculture,</b> agricultural <b>value</b> <b>added</b> and poverty – all variables strongly linked to the sustainable livelihoods framework. Since most poor rural households rely on agricultural production for a significant share of their household income, increasing agricultural productivity is critical to increase food security and reduce rural poverty. food security, livelihoods, smallholder agriculture, sub-Saharan Africa, Consumer/Household Economics,...|$|R

The approach relaxes the representative household assumption in the traditional CGE modeling by replacing household groups with individual households. As such the approach allows one to model the link between trade reforms and individual households and their feedback to the general equilibrium of the economy. The present paper incorporates the whole 24, 797 households of the 1994 Family Income and Expenditure Survey and simulates the tariff reduction from 1994 to 2000. Tariff reduction leads to higher imports and exports. Although domestic production for the local market declines, the overall production improves. These are due to substitution and scale effects of tariff reduction. Resource reallocation and factor movements favor the nonfood manufacturing sector. Agriculture wages, as well the rate of return to capital in agriculture, decline {{as a result of}} the drop in <b>agriculture</b> output and <b>value</b> <b>added.</b> Income of rural households in the different regions declines, while income of urban households in the various regions (including the NCR) improves.
