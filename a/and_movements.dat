40|$|Dance <b>and</b> <b>movement</b> {{therapy is}} a form of {{psychotherapy}} that uses the body, dance, <b>and</b> <b>movement</b> as the primary mediums for the therapeutic process. Dance is a fundamental art form that involves the body as an instrument of self-expression; movement is a universal means of learning and communicating. Dance <b>and</b> <b>movement</b> therapy is the psychotherapeutic use of movement as a process that furthers the emotional, cognitive, and physical integration of the individual. The American Dance Therapy Association (ADTA) supports and promotes this young profession by establishing and maintaining high standards of professional training and practice. The ADTA provides a registry process, a code of ethics for the profession, and a program approval process for graduate programs in dance <b>and</b> <b>movement</b> therapy. Education <b>and</b> training for dance <b>and</b> <b>movement</b> therapy is compatible with programs in counseling and psychology. Increasingly, dance <b>and</b> <b>movement</b> therapists are becoming certified and licensed as counselors, psychologists, and social workers. Thus dance <b>and</b> <b>movement</b> therapy provides an exciting career opportunity for those interested in dance and the helping professions. Contains 16 references.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to explore how cloth, the body <b>and</b> <b>movement</b> are able to communicate possible symbolic meaning in Loïe Fuller’s Serpentine Dance film and Moderat’s Rusty Nails music video. The study further attempts to establish the characteristics of fashion film to include cloth, the body <b>and</b> <b>movement</b> <b>and</b> provide a methodology that locates fashion film as a sign system using a visual semiotic analysis framework. The films were then compared and contrasted to determine similarities and differences in their use of cloth, the body <b>and</b> <b>movement.</b> The findings from the film analysis suggest that cloth, the body <b>and</b> <b>movement</b> communicate symbolic meaning in the films based on their associated meanings that are generated {{both inside and outside the}} film context. By focussing on cloth, the body <b>and</b> <b>movement</b> as primary communicators (rather than secondary or supporting communicators) in film, new meanings can be interpreted from their interrelationship. The results inform new ways for fashion designers and fashion filmmakers to engage with cloth, the body <b>and</b> <b>movement</b> in fashion film...|$|R

5|$|Gunfights {{are a major}} {{gameplay}} mechanic in Red Dead Redemption. The {{player can}} take cover, target a specific person or animal, blindfire, and free aim. Individual body parts can also be targeted, {{in order to take}} targets down non-lethally. When the player shoots an enemy, the game engine uniquely creates the AI reactions <b>and</b> <b>movements</b> depending on where they were hit. The player character can choose from period-accurate weapons including revolvers, pistols, lever or bolt-action rifles, shotguns, sniper rifles, knives, explosives, lassos, mounted Gatling guns, and cannons. Duels utilize a gunslinger gameplay mechanic known as Dead Eye. Dead Eye is a targeting system that is used in a bullet time-like manner, allowing the player to slow down time to place a precise shot or paint in multiple shots. When the targeting sequence ends, Marston automatically fires to all marked locations in extremely quick succession.|$|E
