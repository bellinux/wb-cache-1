These species are very similar in appearance and may share many morphological traits. Many different biological processes have the potential to produce dissimilarities in shape between individuals or their characteristics and such shape distinctions can be indicative of varying selective pressures. Morphometrics, a branch of mathematical shape analysis, is a quantitative approach to understanding the diverse causes of variation and morphological transformation. In this study, I analyzed conspecific silverside populations to test for the presence of potential morphological variance within and between species through geometric analysis of landmark coordinates. Preserved specimens were pinned on dissection trays and photographed. These photographs were imported into tpsDIG 2, a computer program for digitizing landmarks and outlines for geometric morphometric analyses. Eight landmarks were plotted on each fish and superimposed using the Generalized Procrustes Analysis (GPA) method. Two covariance functions were employed in data analysis, Procrustes ANOVA/regression for shape data (procD. lm) and pairwise group comparisons (pairwiseD. test). Significant differences were observed between the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>silversides</b> from Maryland and all other species specific location groups.

Much of the bay is open water, while marshes and flats have developed on the protected northern edge of the barrier beach that shelters Patchogue Bay and the mainland from the Atlantic Ocean. Extensive tidal marshes and flats have developed on the bay side of Fire Island as well.

Sticklebacks, including fourspine and threespine, are spring and summer spawners associated with submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV); although they are very abundant, their use as prey for other fish and birds is limited due to spines, body armor, and close association with vegetative cover. Northern pipefish s) is a zooplankton consumer preyed upon by both striped bass and summer flounder. American sandlance, probably the most abundant winter species, provides important forage for many species of special emphasis in the Bight. Summer flounder enter the bay in winter and spring and grow rapidly in the productive waters.

40|$|How organisms {{may adapt}} to rising global {{temperatures}} is uncertain, but concepts can emerge from studying adaptive physiological trait variations across existing spatial climate gradients.

40|$|SYNOPSIS. Whole {{organism}} performance {{represents the}} integration of numerous physiological, morpholog-ical, and behavioral traits. How adaptive changes in performance evolve therefore requires {{an understanding of how}} selection acts on multiple integrated traits. Two approaches that lend themselves to studying the evolution of performance in natural populations are the use of quantitative genetics models for estimating the strength of selection acting on multiple quantitative traits and ecological genetic comparisons of popu-lations exhibiting phenotypic differences correlated with environmental variation. In both cases, the ultimate goal is to understand how suites of traits and trade-offs between competing functions respond to natural selection. Here we consider how these two complimentary approaches can be applied to study the adaptive evolution of escape performance in fish. We first present an extension of Arnold’s (1983) quantitative genetic approach that explicitly considers how trade-offs between different components of performance interact with the underlying genetics. We propose that such a model can reveal the conditions under which multiple selection pressures will cause adaptive change in traits that influence more than one component of fitness. We then review work on the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>silversides</b> and Trinidadian guppies as two case studies where an ecological genetics approach has been successfully applied to evaluate how the evolution of escape perfor-mance trades-off with other components of fitness. We conclude with the general lesson that whole organism performance is embedded in a complex phenotype, and that the net outcome of selection acting on different aspects of the organism will often result in a compromise among competing influences...|$|R
40|$|Organisms {{that are}} {{distributed}} across spatial climate gradients often exhibit adaptive local variations in morphological and physiological traits, {{but to what}} extent such gradients shape evolutionary responses is still unclear. Given the strong natural contrast in latitudinal temperature gradients between the North-American Pacific and Atlantic coast, we asked how increases in vertebral number (VN, known as Jordan's Rule) with latitude would differ between Pacific (Atherinops affinis) and <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Silversides</b> (Menidia menidia), two ecologically equivalent and taxonomically similar fishes with similar latitudinal distributions. VN was determined from radiographs of wild-caught adults (genetic + environmental differences) and its genetic basis confirmed by rearing offspring in common garden experiments. Compared to published data on VN variation in M. menidia (a mean increase of 7. 0 vertebrae from 32 to 46 °N, VN slope = 0. 42 /lat), the latitudinal VN increase in Pacific Silversides was approximately half as strong (a mean increase of 3. 3 vertebrae from 28 to 43 °N, VN slope = 0. 23 /lat). This mimicked the strong Atlantic (1. 11 °C/lat) versus weak Pacific latitudinal gradient (0. 40 °C/lat) in median annual sea surface temperature (SST). Importantly, the relationship of VN to SST was not significantly different between the two species (average slope = - 0. 39 vertebrae/°C), thus suggesting a common thermal dependency of VN in silverside fishes. Our findings provide novel support for the hypothesis that temperature gradients are the ultimate cause of Jordan's Rule, even though its exact adaptive significance remains speculative. A second investigated trait, the mode of sex determination in <b>Atlantic</b> versus Pacific <b>Silversides,</b> revealed patterns that were inconsistent with our expectation: M. menidia displays temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) at low latitudes, where growing seasons are long or unconstrained, but also a gradual shift to genetic sex determination (GSD) with increasing latitude due {{to more and more}} curtailed growing seasons. Sex ratios in A. affinis, on the other hand, were independent of latitude and rearing temperature (indicating GSD), even though growing seasons are thermally unconstrained across most of the geographical distribution of A. affinis.

40|$|Targett, Timothy E. Diel-cycling hypoxia and co-varying pH {{fluctuations}} {{reduces the}} quality of shallow estuarine nursery habitat for juvenile fishes. Avoidance or compensatory behaviors allow fish to mitigate stress associated with low dissolved oxygen (DO). Aquatic surface respiration (ASR), respiring in the thin, air-saturated, surface layer, is widespread among teleosts and provides an advantage to fish routinely exposed to hypoxia. ASR begins when oxygen becomes physiologically limiting, and serves as an indicator for hypoxia tolerance in a species. 24 -hour video observations were conducted under controlled laboratory conditions using computer-monitored recirculating aquarium systems. Behavioral responses of juvenile striped bass (Morone saxatilis), <b>Atlantic</b> <b>silversides</b> (Menidia menidia), striped killifish (Fundulus majalis), and mummichog (Fundulus heteroclitus) were observed during exposure to different severities and combinations of diel-cycling DO (3 - 9 mg O 2 l- 1 or 1 - 11 mg O 2 l - 1) and corresponding pH (7. 2 - 7. 8 or 6. 8 - 8. 1), compared with responses at static normoxia (7. 5 mg O 2 l- 1) and pH (7. 5). Trials ran from 11 : 00 - 11 : 00 each day; DO decreased overnight (6 hours) to the lowest DO level in both diel-cycles, with the hypoxic period lasting through the morning (4. 5 hours) before trials ended and oxygen increased again. The incidence of ASR, activity level, and position of each individual was recorded at pre-determined time intervals. A second set of observations was conducted under conditions where lowest DO levels (1. 0 - 1. 5 mg O 2 l- 1) were prolonged throughout the day; DO was decreased overnight from super-saturation (~ 10 mg O 2 l- 1) to the oxygen minima (6 hours), low levels were extended (18 hours) then DO was increased back to saturation (6 hours) during the second night. Based on results of {{the first set of}} trials, another set of video observations was conducted on F. heteroclitus that were acclimated to moderate levels of diel-cycling hypoxia and pH (3 - 9 mg O 2 l- 1; 7. 2 - 7. 8) for ??? 10 days. ASR was initiated in M. menidia and F. majalis only when diel-cycling DO fell to (1. 40 - 1. 60 mg O 2 l- 1) and (1. 31 - 1. 46 mg O 2 l- 1), respectively, with both cycling and static pH. In M. menidia, under extended low DO, all individuals exhibited ASR and mortality occurred in all fish shortly after onset, suggesting that ASR is a last-ditch effort to prolong survival. Onset of ASR among F. majalis under diel-cycling conditions varied among individuals; once initiated the behavior was intermittent with variable duration {{until the end of the}} trial, with no mortality observed. At corresponding DO levels, M. saxatilis reduced swimming activity and exhibited positive rheotaxis, but no ASR was observed. ASR was also not observed in F. heteroclitus in diel-cycling treatments, or in acclimated fish, but when low DO (1. 0 mg O 2 l- 1) was prolonged, fish performed ASR after approximately 5 hours exposure. This suggests that in F. heteroclitus, the incidence of ASR is a combination of dissolved oxygen concentration and duration of exposure. Given trade-offs associated with repeated surfacing and skimming, mummichogs appear to delay engaging in ASR under short term low DO exposure occurring during diel-cycles. Utilization of ASR as an adaptive strategy is dependent upon species-specific hypoxia tolerance, and the temporal scale over which low oxygen occurs.

Many of the mid-Atlantic region’s most valuable commercial finfish {{are composed of}} estuarine-dependent types like summer flounder (Paralichthys dentatus), bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix), weakfish (Cynoscion regalis), spot (Leiostomus xanthurus), croaker (Micropogonias undulatus), striped bass (Morone saxatilis) and others. These species depend on the Coastal Bays {{as a place to}} find food, and several species use the bays as a nursery. A forage fish index has been developed and adopted as a measure of food availability in the Bays. This index is based on the abundance of four species- bay anchovy (Anchoa mitchelli), menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus), spot, and <b>Atlantic</b> <b>silverside</b> (Menidia menidia). These species represent the most common finfish forage in Maryland’s Coastal Bays. Since 1972, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has monitored this resource through annual trawl and seine surveys. Despite annual fluctuations, the forage index from both trawl and seine surveys trended downward slowly since the mid...|$|E
40|$|Assessing the {{potential}} of marine organisms to adapt genetically to increasing oceanic CO 2 levels requires proxies such as heritability of fitness-related traits under ocean acidification (OA). We applied a quantitative genetic method to derive the first heritability estimate of survival under elevated CO 2 conditions in a metazoan. Specifically, we reared offspring, selected from a wild coastal fish population (<b>Atlantic</b> <b>silverside,</b> Menidia menidia), at high CO 2 conditions (~ 2300 μatm) from fertilization to 15 days posthatch, which significantly reduced survival compared to controls. Perished and surviving offspring were quantitatively sampled and genotyped along with their parents, using eight polymorphic microsatellite loci, to reconstruct a parent-offspring pedigree and estimate variance components. Genetically related individuals were phenotypically more similar (i. e., survived similarly long at elevated CO 2 conditions) than unrelated individuals, which translated into a significantly nonzero heritability (0. 20 ± 0. 07). The contribution of maternal effects was surprisingly small (0. 05 ± 0. 04) and nonsignificant. Survival among replicates {{was positively correlated with}} genetic diversity, particularly with observed heterozygosity. We conclude that early life survival of M. menidia under high CO 2 levels has a significant additive genetic component that could elicit an evolutionary response to OA, depending on the strength and direction of future selection...|$|E
40|$|ABsTRACT Blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) were transplanted into South Mill Pond, a {{degraded}} tidal {{salt pond}} in Portsmouth NH. As {{part of a}} larger community-based project volunteers helped create three mussel reefs in each of two locations within the pond in May 2001. Restoration project methodology and success were evaluated during the summer of 2001 and again in May 2002 by 1) assessing reef population dynamics (size frequency distribution, density, and movement) and 2) comparing faunal utilization (finfish species and abundance) within the reefs to that in adjacent reference areas. Created reefs showed declines in density after the first month but then increased and showed new recruitment the following year. Reef footprints were dynamic and probably influenced by mussel density as well as local hydrology. Four finfish species were observed: <b>Atlantic</b> <b>silverside</b> (Menidia menidia), mummichog (Fundulus heteroclitus), four-spined stickleback (Apeltes quadracus), and three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). The most common fish in reef and reference areas (silverside and mummichog, respectively) are highly mobile species. Reef areas had greater species diversity per sampling effort than reference areas, but no difference in overall fish abundance was found between adjacent reef and reference areas. Information collected to date indicates that mussel reefs constructed at the pond appear to be functioning as a natural system, acting to improve water quality and provide shelter for small fish and other nektonic and epibenthic invertebrates. In addition, volunteer action garnered city involvement and increased local awareness of the pond a...|$|E
40|$|Targett, TimothyThe {{physical}} structure of estuarine habitats has been, {{and continues to}} be modified by human activity. Understanding how the bio{{physical structure}} of shoreline affects the functional value and habitat quality of estuaries for shore-zone biota is important in determining impacts of shoreline modification on estuarine systems. The Mid-Atlantic region has seen a decrease in the area of Spartina alterniflora (smooth cordgrass) within estuaries during the past few decades, while invasive Phragmites australis (common reed) and several types of shoreline hardening including bulkhead, riprap and riprap-sill structures have become more common. These hardened shorelines and invasive grass species have caused a change in the ecological character of the intertidal zone, particularly in urbanized watersheds. This research seeks to understand how changes in shoreline structure affect the ecological character of tidal marsh creeks and basins along Delaware Bay and Delaware Coastal Bays through estuarine fish and crab assemblages, tributary water quality, and fish spawning activity. In {{the first part of this}} study, I used quantitative sampling to examine the spatiotemporal use of estuarine systems by fish and blue crabs in association with environmental characteristics of the habitat, in particular shoreline type and water quality. Fish and blue crabs were collected from the shore-zone of five shoreline types, S. alterniflora marsh, P. australis marsh, sandy beach, riprap, and bulkhead from August through September 2009 and June through September 2010. Over the two-year study, in total 102, 343 individuals in 28 species of fish and 3, 607 blue crabs were collected in the shore-zone of Indian River and Pepper Creek. The greatest abundances of fish were collected from the shore-zone of native S. alterniflora marsh, while the greatest abundances of blue crabs were caught in the shore-zone of P. australis marsh. Individual species of abundant estuarine fish had unique relationships with hardened and unhardened shorelines. Total fish abundance was greatest when dissolved oxygen (DO) was above the EPA dissolved oxygen criterion of 2. 3 mg O 2 /l for the survival of aquatic organisms, though this relationship differed among fish species and shoreline type. Minimal associations were found between fish and blue crab abundance and other environmental variables including water temperature, watershed land use, and watershed impervious surface area. Overall fish community assemblages did not differ in any perceptible pattern among shoreline types. Fish assemblages at all sampling stations were more idiosyncratic than coupled based on shoreline type. In the second part of this study, I used quantitative sampling to examine the spatiotemporal use of estuarine systems by fish and blue crabs in association with riprap-sill. Wetland managers generally consider riprap-sill structures (a type of ???living shoreline??? consisting of a rock sill placed low in the intertidal zone with native vegetation planted between the sill and shore) to be more ecologically sound than riprap for shoreline stabilization in estuaries. However, little research has been conducted comparing the macrofauna associated with these structures with that inhabiting the more traditionally applied riprap. Fish and blue crab abundance and diversity were compared at riprap-sill shoreline, riprap shoreline, and shoreline fringed with smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) marsh in the Delaware Coastal Bays, USA, from June through September 2010. Seining was conducted to quantitatively sample the shore-zone and shallow subtidal regions, and minnow traps were used to determine presence/absence of fishes in the upper intertidal zone of each shoreline type. In total, 9777 fishes and 548 blue crabs were collected from the shore-zone of all three shoreline types during seining. The greatest abundance and density of fishes were caught along the S. alterniflora shoreline. Species densities and composition were generally more similar between the S. alterniflora and the riprap-sill shoreline than were the riprap-sill and traditional riprap shoreline. This study demonstrates that although S. alterniflora shoreline is inhabited by the highest abundance and density of fishes, riprap-sill structure provides a better alternative than does traditional riprap in terms of abundance and diversity of shore-zone estuarine fish and blue crabs. In the third part of this study, multi-parameter water quality meters were positioned in the subtidal zone immediately adjacent to each of five shoreline types, S. alterniflora marsh, P. australis marsh, sandy beach, riprap, and bulkhead, within four tributary regions of Indian River and Pepper Creek. Multi-parameter sondes were alternated among each tributary region once at 2 week intervals to record differences in water temperature and DO concentrations during the summer of 2010. Measurements were recorded when tributaries were experiencing severe diel-cycling hypoxia (July 15 th-September 9 th, 2010). Negligible differences were found in water temperature among shoreline types. The subtidal area directly adjacent to S. alterniflora shorelines was found to experience less severe diel-cycling hypoxia than other shoreline types in Indian River and Pepper Creek. This was particularly evident between the hours of 0200 and 1000, when DO concentrations are typically at their lowest, wherein water adjacent to S. alterniflora shorelines had consistently greater DO concentrations than did water adjacent to other shoreline types. In the fourth part of this study, I examined how <b>Atlantic</b> <b>silverside</b> (Menidia menidia) utilized six different shoreline types (S. alterniflora marsh, P. australis marsh, sandy beach, riprap-sill, riprap, bulkhead) for egg deposition. <b>Atlantic</b> <b>silverside</b> is among the most abundant forage fish species in Mid-Atlantic estuaries, and is an important prey for piscivores such as striped bass, Atlantic mackerel, bluefish, and others. <b>Atlantic</b> <b>silverside</b> eggs are demersal, adhesive, and are laid in estuarine intertidal zones. From April 14 th to June 10 th, 2010, egg deposition of <b>Atlantic</b> <b>silverside,</b> was measured daily at several sites near Roosevelt Inlet, Delaware, close to the mouth of Delaware Bay. Substrates utilized for egg attachment were noted at each shoreline type. Air/water temperature was recorded every 15 minutes at high, mid, and low intertidal elevations using iButton thermochrons. Over 3, 000, 000 eggs were collected during 50 sampling days. Eggs were deposited at all six shoreline types, with > 93 % of eggs collected from S. alterniflora shorelines. Choice of substrate for egg attachment was similar across shoreline types with > 91 % of eggs collected from filaments of the green alga Enteromorpha spp., a disproportionately high utilization rate in comparison with Enteromorpha spp. ???s relative coverage. This study demonstrates that S. alterniflora shoreline, in association with Enteromorpha spp., is preferred spawning habitat for M. menidia, and that hardened shorelines and shorelines inhabited by P. australis support substantially reduced egg densities.

40|$|The niche {{partitioning}} hypothesis {{predicts that}} two species cannot {{compete for the}} same limited resources and that one species should differentiate (genetically, morphologically or behaviorally), so that the two species are filling separate niches. To test this hypothesis, we collected two co-occurring silverside species, the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>silverside</b> Menidia menidia and Inland silverside Menidia beryllina, from the Albemarle and Pamlico Sounds of North Carolina. Approximately 1, 100 fish were collected through multiple beach seining trips from 20 sites in the Pamlico Sound and 8 sites from the Albemarle Sound throughout the months of August to November of 2013. The fish from each site were positively identified as being Menidia menidia or Menidia beryllina and their total length was measured (to the nearest mm). Length frequency analysis showed that M. menidia were larger {{at any given time}} than M. beryllina in both bodies of water. Food habit analysis showed that silversides in the Albemarle Sound were preying upon dipteran insects and chironomid larvae while silversides in the Pamlico Sound were preying upon copepods. Niche overlap analysis was run using a Pianka Index in EcosimR. Index analysis showed high overlap values between M. menidia and M. beryllina in both the Albemarle and Pamlico Sounds. These data do not support the niche partitioning hypothesis. It is possible that when food availability changes and becomes limited, overlap in diet may change as well, increasing food competition. More data (including food availability data and diet analyses during additional time periods or years) are needed to confirm results. B. S...|$|E
