5|$|When Kurosawa's {{exclusive}} contract with Toho {{came to an}} end in 1966, the 56-year-old director was seriously contemplating change. Observing the troubled state of the domestic film industry, and having already received dozens of offers from abroad, the idea of working outside Japan appealed to him <b>as</b> <b>never</b> <b>before.</b>|$|E

25|$|In {{the course}} of the century Western {{archaeology}} spread across the Middle East and Asia, with spectacular results. The new national museums provided a setting for the finds, most of which were in this period bought back to Europe, and put Orientalists in the public spotlight <b>as</b> <b>never</b> <b>before.</b>|$|E

25|$|There {{were some}} signs of {{economic}} life beginning to return to normal {{towards the end of}} the 1930s, but it was the onset of World War II which transformed the national economy and ended the hard times of the Depression. Because of the war effort, women entered the workforce <b>as</b> <b>never</b> <b>before.</b>|$|E
25|$|Before the 32nd G8 {{summit in}} Heiligendamm, Germany, in 2007, Tutu {{called on the}} G8 to focus on poverty in the Third World.

25|$|After {{the defeat}} of Great Britain by the American revolutionaries, the British Army fell into {{dereliction}} (it {{should be noted that}} the army in 1775 was in a poor state anyway), morale and discipline were low, and troops levels fell. The Army was neglected <b>as</b> <b>never</b> <b>before</b> and its total strength in 1793 stood at 40,000 men.|$|E

25|$|This was the {{beginning}} of their protracted parliamentary campaign, during which Wilberforce introduced a motion in favour of abolition almost every year. Clarkson, Wilberforce and {{the other members of the}} Committee for the Abolition of the Slave Trade and their supporters, were responsible for generating and sustaining a national movement that mobilised public opinion <b>as</b> <b>never</b> <b>before.</b> Parliament, however, refused to pass the bill. The outbreak of War with France effectively prevented further debate for many years.|$|E
25|$|Most of the palaces and {{temples of}} Palenque were {{constructed}} during his government; the city flourished <b>as</b> <b>never</b> <b>before,</b> eclipsing Tikal. The central complex, known as The Palace, was enlarged and remodeled on various occasions, {{notably in the}} years 654, 661, and 668. In this structure, is a text describing how in that epoch Palenque was newly allied with Tikal, and also with Yaxchilan, {{and that they were}} able to capture the six enemy kings of the alliance. Not much more had been translated from the text.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{learning}} of the capture of the royal family, the National Constituent Assembly sent three representatives, Antoine Barnave, Jérôme Pétion de Villeneuve and Charles César de Fay de La Tour-Maubourg to Varennes to escort Marie Antoinette and her family back to Paris. On {{the way to the}} capital they were jeered and insulted by the people <b>as</b> <b>never</b> <b>before.</b> The prestige of the French monarchy had never been at such a low level. During the trip, Barnave, the representative of the moderate party in the Assembly, protected Marie Antoinette from the crowds, and even Pétion took pity on the royal family. Brought safely back to Paris, they were met with total silence by the crowd. Thanks to Barnave, the royal couple was not brought to trial and was publicly exonerated of any crime in relation with the attempted escape.|$|E

25|$|The Vietnam War hastened the {{modernisation}} and Westernisation of Thai society. The American {{presence and}} {{the exposure to}} Western culture that came with it {{had an effect on}} almost every aspect of Thai life. Before the late 1960s, full access to Western culture was limited to a highly educated elite in society, but the Vietnam War brought the outside world face to face with large segments of the Thai society <b>as</b> <b>never</b> <b>before.</b> With US dollars pumping up the economy, the service, transportation, and construction industries grew phenomenally as did drug abuse and prostitution. The traditional rural family unit was broken down as more and more rural Thais moved to the city to find new jobs. This led to a clash of cultures as Thais were exposed to Western ideas about fashion, music, values, and moral standards.|$|E
25|$|Agriculture {{had a major}} impact; humans {{began to}} affect the {{environment}} <b>as</b> <b>never</b> <b>before.</b> Surplus food allowed a priestly or governing class to arise, followed by increasing division of labor. This led to Earth's first civilization at Sumer in the Middle East, between 4000 and 3000 BC. Additional civilizations quickly arose in ancient Egypt, at the Indus River valley and in China. The invention of writing enabled complex societies to arise: record-keeping and libraries served as a storehouse of knowledge and increased the cultural transmission of information. Humans {{no longer had to}} spend all their time working for survival, enabling the first specialized occupations (e.g. craftsmen, merchants, priests, etc...). Curiosity and education drove the pursuit of knowledge and wisdom, and various disciplines, including science (in a primitive form), arose. This in turn led to the emergence of increasingly larger and more complex civilizations, such as the first empires, which at times traded with one another, or fought for territory and resources.|$|E

In my opinion the bargain was an improvident one, but that does not justify confiscation ... I did not think the new road would pay. [...] But it is a new doctrine that because a bargain did not pay it should be repudiated and one should become a repudiator of bargains and a confiscator of private rights.|$|E

[...] A Cuban social worker [...] suggested the cause was representative of an older generation of Cuban emigres, worried that their children were being lost in the depravity of Miami.
