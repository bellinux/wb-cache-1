30|$|The {{continuous}} {{advances in}} mobile technologies and personal devices (smartphones and tablets) {{have led to}} the deployment of heterogeneous networks (HetNets) to support the extreme traffic demand of new services. HetNets comprise different Radio Access Technologies (RAT) and several cell sizes (macrocell, microcells, picocell, etc.), resulting in a non-easily manageable complex mobile network infrastructure. In this sense, Self-Organizing Networks (SON) [1] have been identified by the 3 rd Generation Partnership Project (3 GPP) as a key feature to intelligently <b>automate</b> <b>network</b> management procedures in the future mobile networks. For that purpose, several self-x capabilities have been defined: self-configuration to <b>automate</b> <b>network</b> configuration and planning; self-optimization to enhance network performance by automatically tuning its parameters; and self-healing to detect, identify, compensate, and recover failures in the network. In this context, several self-optimization mechanisms have been widely studied and analyzed in the literature and in European projects in both outdoor and indoor networks [2 – 8], with the aim of enhancing the network performance and increasing cell capacity and mobile network coverage.|$|E

The contributions of this paper are twofold. First, we provide a fine-grained cross-domain authorization for GARA that leverages existing institutional security and group services, with universal access for users.

40|$|Anemone: using end-systems as a rich network {{management}} platform Enterprise networks contain hundreds, if not thousands, of cooperative end-systems. This paper advocates devoting {{a small fraction}} of their idle cycles, free disk space and network bandwidth to create Anemone, a rich platform for {{network management}}. This contrasts with current approaches that rely on traffic statistics provided by network devices. Anemone infers network-wide traffic patterns by synthesizing end-system flow statistics with dynamic topology information obtained by passive snooping of IP routeing protocols. Understanding the effect of the network on individual applications ’ end-to-end performance requires data only available in the end-systems actually hosting applications. Consequently, we claim that augmenting endsystems with in-band monitoring, creating an overlay of real-time ‘traffic sensors ’ will provide a more complete view of the network, support sophisticated network management queries, and supply the global statistics necessary to <b>automate</b> <b>network</b> control.
