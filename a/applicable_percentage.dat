5000|$|The {{credit amount}} {{is equal to}} the <b>applicable</b> <b>percentage,</b> as {{determined}} by the taxpayer's adjusted gross income, times the qualified employment expenses paid. Taxpayers with an adjusted gross income of $15,000 or less use the highest <b>applicable</b> <b>percentage</b> of 35%. For taxpayers with an adjusted gross income over $15,000, the credit is reduced by one percentage point for each $2,000 of adjusted gross income (or fraction thereof) over $15,000. The minimum <b>applicable</b> <b>percentage</b> of 20% is used by taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes greater than $43,000.|$|E

50|$|Regardless of {{the result}} of these computations, the credit cannot exceed the amount {{allocated}} by the state agency. For example, suppose a project cost $100,000 for land, $400,000 for an existing building that was most recently placed in service {{more than ten years}} ago, and $1,000,000 for rehabilitation; also suppose that the <b>applicable</b> <b>percentages</b> are 3.5% and 9%, that the project will be 80% low income, that there are no tax-exempt bonds, and that the state agency awarded $70,000 per year of credits. The credits are computed as follows -- (1) the cost of the land is not eligible for credits; (2) the maximum annual credit for the purchase of the building is $400,000 times 80% times 3.5%, or $11,200; (3) the maximum annual credit for the rehabilitation is $1,000,000 times 80% times 9%, or $72,000. The total maximum annual credits, $83,200, is more than the amount of credits awarded by the state. As a result, the project is limited to $70,000 of credits per year.|$|R

[...] A taxpayer can generally receive a credit anywhere from 20−35% of such costs against the taxpayer’s federal income tax liability. [...] The <b>applicable</b> <b>percentage</b> is inversely correlated to the adjusted gross income of the taxpayer − the higher the adjusted gross income, the lower the percentage.|$|E
5000|$|The {{subsidies}} for insurance premiums {{are given to}} individuals who buy a plan from an exchange and have a household income between 133% and 400% of the poverty line. Section 1401(36B) of PPACA explains that each subsidy will be provided as an advanceable, refundable tax credit and gives a formula for its calculation: [...] Except as provided in clause (ii), the <b>applicable</b> <b>percentage</b> with respect to any taxpayer for any taxable year is equal to 2.8 percent, increased {{by the number of}} percentage points (not greater than 7) which bears the same ratio to 7 percentage points as the taxpayer's household income for the taxable year in excess of 100 percent of the poverty line for a family of the size involved, bears to an amount equal to 200 percent of the poverty line for a family of the size involved. *(ii) SPECIAL RULE FOR TAXPAYERS UNDER 133 PERCENT OF POVERTY LINE- If a taxpayer's household income for the taxable year is in excess of 100 percent, but not more than 133 percent, of the poverty line for a family of the size involved, the taxpayer's <b>applicable</b> <b>percentage</b> shall be 2 percent.::-- Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act: Title I: Subtitle E: Part I: Subpart A: Premium Calculation A refundable tax credit is a way to provide government benefits to individuals who may have no tax liability (such as the earned income tax credit). The formula was changed in the amendments (HR 4872) passed March 23, 2010, in section 1001. To qualify for the subsidy, the beneficiaries cannot be eligible for other acceptable coverage. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on May 23, 2012, issued joint final rules regarding implementation of the new state-based health insurance exchanges to cover how the exchanges will determine eligibility for uninsured individuals and employees of small businesses seeking to buy insurance on the exchanges, as well as how the exchanges will handle eligibility determinations for low-income individuals applying for newly expanded Medicaid benefits.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the applicability and the interrater reliability of a Semi-Structured Interview for psychological autopsy {{in cases of}} suicide. Method: The Semi-Structured Interview for Psychological Autopsy (SSIPA) proposed in this paper consists of four modules which evaluate key-topics associated to suicide. In order to evaluate the instrument's applicability, a sample formed by 42 subjects related to 21 suicide cases was used. The interviews were tape-recorded first and then transcribed. The related material {{as well as the}} police inquiry data were presented to four judges. Evaluation of information has been performed {{with the help of a}} four-module formulary for decision making: precipitants and/or stressors, motivation, lethality, and intentionality. Data processing, whenever possible, has been accomplished using kappa statistics. When kappa statistic was not <b>applicable,</b> concordance <b>percentage</b> has been used. Results: The SSIPA is applicable because it provides information containing a significant degree of agreement between evaluators, found in one hundred and twenty measurements of judgements made by four judges. There has been significant statistical agreement between the judges in three modules (precipitants and/or stressors, motivation, and intentionality) of the model for decision, except in one step of each module, which did not interfere in the final agreement on the present evaluation. In the lethality evaluation module, there has been a 100 % agreement between judges. The judgement made by the raters on the four modules have allowed to reach a final agreement regarding the death mode as suicide. Conclusion: The results of this study show that it is possible to use a semi-structured instrument for psychological autopsy in cases of suicide, when the interviewees are relatives who accepted to provide information...|$|R
40|$|Energy {{conservation}} {{is one of}} the important issues in communication protocol development for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). WSNs are a shared medium system, consequently a Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol is required to resolve contention. The feature of the MAC together with the application behavior determines the communication states which have different power requirements. The power level used for a transmission, will affect both the effective range of the transmission and the energy used. The Power & Reliability Aware Protocol (PoRAP) has been developed to provide efficient communication by means of energy conservation without sacrificing reliability. It is compared to Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA), Sensor-MAC (S-MAC) and Berkeley-MAC (B-MAC) in terms of energy consumption. The analysis begins with a parameter space study to discover which attributes affect the energy conservation performance. Parameter settings in the Great Duck Island are used for comparative study. According to the results, PoRAP consumes the least amount of communication energy and it is <b>applicable</b> when the <b>percentage</b> of slot usage is high...|$|R

40|$|Background: Raw {{percentage}} scores can {{be transformed}} to age-specific Z scores, despite the asymmetric distribution of normative data using {{a process that is}} <b>applicable</b> to any <b>percentage</b> (or proportion) -based result. Purpose: Normative values are generated for the commonly used dichotic digit and frequency pattern behavioral tests of auditory processing. Study Sample: A total of 180 normal-hearing children aged 7 yr 0 mo to 12 yr 2 mo took part in this study. Research Design: A transformation and regression method is incorporated that allows for the asymmetric distribution of normative results and the development of the response across the 7 - 12 -yr-age range. Data Collection and Analysis: Percentage correct scores were determined for each ear in the dichotic digit and frequency pattern tests, delivered at 50 dB HL. The scores were arcsine transformed, then regressed against using an exponential equation, providing an age specific estimated mean score. The residual error of the regression was then used to estimate age specific variance. Results and Conclusions: The ability to express results along an age continuum (while accounting for the asymmetric distribution and significant developmental influences) as a standard unit across all ages enables a simplified expression of performance ability on a task. 8 page(s...|$|R

The amendments were made in the Law on Environment Protection, Nature Conservation, Regulations referring to Waste Management, Use of Natural Resources. In recent years, the investments from the budget for the protection and preservation of the environment ranged from 0. 3 % of GDP, which represents a low level of investment. The sources of funds for investment are the fees and charges for the use of natural resources and compensation for environmental pollution. An important source of funds for environment protection was realized from international grants and loan debts. The original revenues for the use of natural values, goods and capital in Serbia, as well as revenues from fees for polluting the environment are distributed by <b>applicable</b> laws, defined <b>percentage</b> of the central budget and the budget of the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina and the budgets of municipalities and towns in Serbia. In Serbia, the Fund for Environment Protection was established in accordance with the recommendations of the UN and practices developed in EU in 2005, which goal is to raise funds and systematic realization of investments for environment protection. Finally, the paper presents a short view and some of the paradoxes that follow the pattern of trading pollution rights...|$|R
