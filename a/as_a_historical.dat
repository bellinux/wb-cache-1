5|$|John Bartram of Philadelphia, King's Botanist for the North American colonies, {{established}} the continent's first botanical garden in 1728, Bartram's Garden. The garden is now managed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>historical</b> site {{that includes a}} few original and many modern specimens as well as extensive archives and restored historical farm buildings.|$|E
5|$|The {{recognition}} of Beonna <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>historical</b> figure leaves the 'Hun' {{element in the}} word Hunbeanna detached. Beanna is itself a hypocoristic form of a two-part name, and the 'nn' in the name has been interpreted as representing a geminate consonant.|$|E
5|$|Cibber's poetical {{work was}} derided in his time, {{and has been}} remembered only for being poor. His {{importance}} in British theatre history rests on his {{being one of the}} first {{in a long line of}} actor-managers, on the interest of two of his comedies as documents of evolving early 18th-century taste and ideology, and on the value of his autobiography <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>historical</b> source.|$|E

5|$|Historically {{regarded}} as a barren, desolate and dangerous to cross, the Pine Bush {{has come to be}} seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>historical,</b> cultural, and environmental asset to the Capital District and Hudson Valley regions of New York. It is home to the Karner blue butterfly, an endangered species first identified by author Vladimir Nabokov in 1944 using a type specimen from the Pine Bush.|$|E
5|$|The Calais Lighthouse (Le phare de Calais) {{was built}} in 1848, {{replacing}} the old watch tower as the lighthouse of the port. The 55 metre high tower was electrified in 1883 and automated in 1992. The staircase has 271 steps {{leading up to the}} lantern. By day it is easily distinguishable from other coastal lighthouses by its white color and black lantern. The lighthouse was classified <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>historical</b> monument on 22 November 2010.|$|E
5|$|The Studio {{series was}} {{inspired}} by Matisse paintings, and Diane Waldman claims that this particular effort was modelled upon Matisse's L'Atelier Rouge (The Red Studio), although the Lichtenstein Foundation website credits two other Matisse works as inspiration as well as Fernand Léger's The Baluster, 1925, which is represented in the far right corner. Léger was one of Lichtenstein's closest friends. By incorporating Matisse in his own studio setting, Lichtenstein is perceived as presenting himself as Matisse's peer {{and in so doing}} repositions pop art <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>historical</b> style rather than a contemporary one.|$|E

5|$|Though Oklahoma {{is placed}} {{entirely in the}} Southern United States by the United States Census Bureau, Tulsa is {{influenced}} by the nearby Southwest, Midwest, and Southern cultural regions, as well <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>historical</b> Native American presence. These influences are expressed in the city's museums, cultural centers, performing arts venues, ethnic festivals, park systems, zoos, wildlife preserves, and large and growing collections of public sculptures, monuments, and artwork.|$|E
5|$|Timberlake's primary {{legacy is}} the journal he kept while {{living with the}} Cherokee. The volume was {{published}} in 1765, likely following Timberlake's death in September of that year. The journal is of importance both as an ethnological study, as it contains detailed descriptions of various facets of Cherokee society, and <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>historical</b> account, as it gives insight into Cherokee political decision-making and the tribe's early reactions to the encroaching European colonists.|$|E
5|$|Although Apollonius {{wrote his}} poem in the 3rd century BC, the {{composition}} of the story of the Argonauts is earlier than Odyssey, which shows familiarity with the exploits of Jason (the wandering of Odysseus may have been partly founded on it). In ancient times the expedition was regarded <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>historical</b> fact, an incident in the opening up of the Black Sea to Greek commerce and colonization. It was also extremely popular, forming a cycle to which a number of local legends became attached. The story of Medea, in particular, caught the imagination of the tragic poets.|$|E
50|$|The Church of Notre-Dame d'Aures (12th centuries) is {{registered}} <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>historical</b> monument. The church {{contains a}} Statue of Saint Foy (15th century) which is registered <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>historical</b> object.|$|R

5|$|Although most of {{the miners}} left, either to return home or settle elsewhere, some stayed {{to work in the}} {{ranching}} and logging industries that became the economic mainstay of the Trinity River area. Some also continued to search for gold long after the major deposits were gone; even today, recreational gold panning remains a popular activity along the Trinity. One Mr. Jorstad who had been mining in the Trinity River country since the 1930s, continued to live in a small cabin at Pfeiffer Flat on the North Fork until his death in 1989. Jorstad's cabin was an important rest stop for miners, hunters, hikers and fishermen along the North Fork for many years; it remains <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>historical</b> site maintained by the Forest Service.|$|E
5|$|An ardent {{supporter}} of the Kuomintang, Lee was involved in secret meetings with Sun Yat-Sen at the Wan Qing Yuan, a two-storey villa at Tai Gin Road. He also helped the Chinese diaspora in Southeast Asia raise funds to support the Kuomintang in their struggles against the Empire of Japan and Communist Party of China. In 1937, Lee and five other Chinese community leaders bought the Wan Qing Yuan to preserve it <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>historical</b> site; it was later {{handed over to the}} Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCCI), which renovated it {{and turned it into a}} national monument, the Sun Yat Sen Villa (now Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall).|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1986, Barry Levinson {{intended}} {{to produce and}} direct a biopic based {{on the life of}} Bobby Darin with funding from his own production company, Baltimore Pictures. With writer Lewis Colick, Levinson pitched the idea to Warner Bros. Pictures, who agreed to co-finance The Bobby Darin Story and cover distribution duties. Producer Arthur Friedman, a fan of Darin's work, began to laboriously negotiate for crucial music licensing rights with Darin's ex-wife, Sandra Dee; his son, Dodd; and former manager Steve Blauner. Colick wrote the first draft in 1987 before Warner Bros. and Levinson commissioned rewrites from Paul Attanasio and Paul Schrader. Their scripts, which kept The Bobby Darin Story title, concentrated on Sandra Dee's alcoholism and childhood molestation by her stepfather. David Gershenson, Darin's longtime friend, publicist and manager, joined the project <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>historical</b> consultant. Tom Cruise was reportedly under consideration to portray Darin.|$|E

5|$|Lees Ferry is {{considered}} the official beginning of Grand Canyon National Park on the Colorado River and {{is used as a}} fishing area and river rafting launch site. The main access is by Lees Ferry Road, which splits off from U.S. Route 89 at the hamlet of Marble Canyon, Arizona, {{on the west side of}} the Navajo Bridges. The Lonely Dell Ranch Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 and expanded to include Lees Ferry in 1997, features several buildings built during and after John D. Lee's brief tenure at the site along with some remnants of the Charles H. Spencer. The area is managed by the National Park Service within the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>historical</b> site.|$|E
5|$|On {{graduating from}} Oxford, Edwards was {{employed}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>Historical</b> Research Officer within the Department of Foreign Affairs from 1971. Here, {{he worked as}} an editor on the first three volumes of Documents on Australian Foreign Policy, 1937–49. The volumes, published between 1975 and 1979, dealt with the build-up towards and initial period of the Second World War. Edwards was awarded a Harkness Fellowship to Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, in 1975, and moved over to the Australian National University (ANU) as a Research Fellow in History later that year. In 1978 he {{was appointed to the}} University of Adelaide as Master of St. Mark's College. Work on his first authored history, Prime Ministers and Diplomats, was completed during this time. The book was published in 1983 by Oxford University Press.|$|E
5|$|The Fakahani Mosque exemplifies this process. It {{was built}} in the Fatimid period, either as a {{suspended}} mosque (one with shops underneath it) or with a high basement. After the earthquake of 1302 it was rebuilt. In 1440 an ablution basin was added, and early in the Ottoman period a minaret was built. The amir Ahmad Katkhuda Mustahfazan al-Kharbutli in 1735 ordered a major reconstruction, almost all of the original building being replaced apart from two doors. These finely carved doors were registered <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>historical</b> monument in 1908 by the committee of conservation, and the building itself was registered in 1937.|$|E

5|$|The Fifth Ward Wardroom is {{historically}} significant <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>historical</b> {{reminder of the}} pivotal time in which Pawtucket was incorporated as a city and gave up its town-meeting form of governance. The building is also architecturally significant as a rare type of building, wardrooms, {{and is one of}} three extant examples in Rhode Island. William R. Walker & Son constructed three such structures in Pawtucket with the First Ward Wardroom being extant and the third example having been demolished. Though both constructed by William R. Walker & Son, the two Pawtucket wardrooms are related, but not identical in construction and show variations by the firm. Another wardroom, with a bungalow style, is located in the Cato Hill Historic District in Woonsocket, Rhode Island. The Fifth Ward Wardroom was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.|$|E
5|$|The {{main problem}} remains, as Jona Lendering points out, {{that most of}} the things we know about Aspasia are based on mere hypothesis. Thucydides does not mention her; our only sources are the untrustworthy {{representations}} and speculations recorded by men in literature and philosophy, who did not care at all about Aspasia <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>historical</b> character. Therefore, in the figure of Aspasia, we get a range of contradictory portrayals; she is either a good wife like Theano or some combination of courtesan and prostitute like Thargelia. This is the reason modern scholars express their scepticism about the historicity of Aspasia's life.|$|E
5|$|The {{memorial}} foundation {{purchased the}} poet's Lockerbie home in Indianapolis {{and it is}} now maintained as a museum. The James Whitcomb Riley Museum Home is the only late-Victorian home in Indiana that {{is open to the public}} and the United States' only late-Victorian preservation, featuring authentic furniture and decor from that era. His birthplace and boyhood home, now the James Whitcomb Riley House, is preserved <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>historical</b> site. A Liberty ship, commissioned April 23, 1942, was christened the SS James Whitcomb Riley. It served with the United States Maritime Commission until being scrapped in 1971.|$|E
