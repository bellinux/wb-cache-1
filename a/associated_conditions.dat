5|$|In most cases, {{medication}} for tics is not necessary. Education {{is an important}} part of any treatment plan, and explanation and reassurance alone are often sufficient treatment. Many individuals with Tourette's go undiagnosed or never seek medical care. Among those who are seen in specialty clinics, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) are present at higher rates. These co-occurring diagnoses often cause more impairment to the individual than the tics; hence, it is important to correctly identify <b>associated</b> <b>conditions</b> and treat them.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{all people}} with Tourette's have comorbid conditions, most Tourette's {{patients}} presenting for clinical care at specialty referral centers may exhibit symptoms of other conditions {{along with their}} motor and phonic tics. <b>Associated</b> <b>conditions</b> include attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADD or ADHD), obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), learning disabilities and sleep disorders. Disruptive behaviors, impaired functioning, or cognitive impairment in patients with comorbid Tourette's and ADHD may {{be accounted for by}} the comorbid ADHD, highlighting the importance of identifying and treating comorbid conditions. Disruption from tics is commonly overshadowed by comorbid conditions that present greater interference to the child. Tic disorders in the absence of ADHD {{do not appear to be}} associated with disruptive behavior or functional impairment, while impairment in school, family, or peer relations is greater in patients who have more comorbid conditions and often determines whether therapy is needed.|$|E

25|$|The {{physical}} exam includes a systematic {{examination of the}} whole patient to assess general health and to look for signs of <b>associated</b> <b>conditions</b> and metastatic disease. The neck and supraclavicular fossa are palpated to feel for cervical adenopathy, other masses, and laryngeal crepitus. The oral cavity and oropharynx are examined under direct vision. The larynx may be examined by indirect laryngoscopy using a small angled mirror with a long handle (akin to a dentist's mirror) and a strong light. Indirect laryngoscopy can be highly effective, but requires skill and practice for consistent results. For this reason, many specialist clinics now use fibre-optic nasal endoscopy where a thin and flexible endoscope, inserted through the nostril, is used to clearly visualise the entire pharynx and larynx. Nasal endoscopy is a quick and easy procedure performed in clinic. Local anaesthetic spray may be used.|$|E

2500|$|Despite this, Broad {{oversaw the}} {{tendering}} {{process for the}} first new brown coal licenses in Victoria in almost a century. This decision allowed {{for the construction of}} coal-to-oil facilities capable of emitting several million tons of additional carbon dioxide each year, with <b>associated</b> <b>conditions</b> requiring that they introduce more efficient means of production in order to minimise the environmental costs. However, the tenders led to substantial criticism from several environmental groups, such as Environment Victoria, who argued that it could [...] "wipe out all of the savings" [...] achieved in the Greenhouse Strategy, and pushed for a complete ban on new brown coal facilities.|$|E
40|$|Many {{diseases}} are linked with uveitis, but {{few studies have}} specifically looked at the noninfectious triggers of childhood uveitis in Central Europe. The charts of 70 paediatric patients with non-infectious uveitis admitted to the Department of Pediatrics, University of Bern, Switzerland, between 1983 and 1998 were therefore reviewed. In the patients the age at presentation with uveitis ranged between 0. 3 and 16 y, median 8. 5 y. Based on the localization, uveitis anterior was diagnosed in most cases (n = 40; 57 %), followed by panuveitis (n = 20; 29 %) and uveitis posterior (n = 10; 14 %). Uveitis was chronic in 54 (77 %) and acute in 16 (23 %), bilateral in 38 (54 %) and unilateral in 32 (46 %) cases. An <b>associated</b> <b>condition</b> was noted in 32 (46 %) cases: juvenile idiopathic arthritis in 24 cases, sarcoidosis and juvenile spondyloarthropathy in 3 cases, and Sjögren's syndrome and Behçet's disease in 1 case each. In the remaining 38 (54 %) patients, no <b>associated</b> <b>condition</b> was diagnosed. It is concluded that in Swiss children, uveitis can {{be due to a}} wide spectrum of non-infectious diseases, juvenile idiopathic arthritis being the leading cause. In the majority of the children, no <b>associated</b> <b>condition</b> was recognized...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the work was to verify whether our MCPS can be a tool for {{predicting}} {{the risk of developing}} disabilities. We considered 45 elderly subjects divided into three groups of 15 subjects each. Group 1 consisted of cases with a ‘‘moderate–severe’’ degree of polypathology, with no <b>associated</b> <b>condition</b> of disability evaluated by means of the activities of daily living (ADL). Group 2 contained cases with a ‘‘moderate’’ degree of polypathology (with no <b>associated</b> <b>condition</b> of ADL disability). The Group 3 was the control group with a ‘‘mild’’ degree of polypathology (with no disability associated with ADL). All subjects were re-evaluated after 6 and 12 months. Both Groups 1 and 2 of cases over time developed greater disabilities, compared to the control Group 3; in particular, the subjects with ‘‘moderate–severe’’ polypathology were more disabled after 12 months...|$|R
50|$|DiGeorge syndrome, {{also known}} as 22q11.2 {{deletion}} syndrome, is a syndrome caused by the deletion of a small segment of chromosome 22. While the symptoms can be variable they often include congenital heart problems, specific facial features, frequent infections, developmental delay, learning problems, and cleft palate. <b>Associated</b> <b>condition</b> include kidney problems, hearing loss, and autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis or Graves disease.|$|R
2500|$|Gluten-sensitive enteropathy–associated {{conditions}} are comorbidities or complications of gluten-related gastrointestinal distress (that is, gluten-sensitive enteropathy or GSE). GSE has key symptoms typically {{restricted to the}} bowel and associated tissues; however, there are {{a wide variety of}} <b>associated</b> <b>conditions.</b> [...] These include bowel disorders (diarrhoea, constipation, irritable bowel), eosinophilic gastroenteritis and increase with coeliac disease (CD) severity. With some early onset and a large percentage of late onset disease, other disorders appear prior to the celiac diagnosis or allergic-like responses (IgE or IgA, IgG) markedly increased in GSE. [...] Many of these disorders persist on a strict gluten-free diet (GF diet or GFD), and are thus independent of coeliac disease after triggering. For example, autoimmune thyroiditis is a common finding with GSE.|$|E
2500|$|Once {{a person}} is {{diagnosed}} with cerebral palsy, further diagnostic tests are optional. Neuroimaging with CT or MRI is warranted when {{the cause of a}} person's cerebral palsy has not been established. An MRI is preferred over CT due to diagnostic yield and safety. When abnormal, the neuroimaging study can suggest the timing of the initial damage. The CT or MRI is also capable of revealing treatable conditions, such as hydrocephalus, porencephaly, arteriovenous malformation, subdural hematomas and hygromas, and a vermian tumour (which a few studies suggest are present 5–22% of the time). Furthermore, an abnormal neuroimaging study indicates a high likelihood of <b>associated</b> <b>conditions,</b> such as epilepsy and intellectual disability. [...] There is a small risk associated with sedating children in order to take a clear MRI.|$|E
