25|$|Many of Woodward's syntheses were {{described}} as spectacular by his colleagues and before he did them, it was thought by some {{that it would be}} impossible to create these substances in the lab. Woodward's syntheses were also described as having an element of art in them, and since then, synthetic chemists have <b>always</b> <b>looked</b> for elegance as well as utility in synthesis. His work also involved the exhaustive use of the then newly developed techniques of infrared spectroscopy and later, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Another important feature of Woodward's syntheses was their attention to stereochemistry or the particular configuration of molecules in three-dimensional space. Most natural products of medicinal importance are effective, for example as drugs, only when they possess a specific stereochemistry. This creates the demand for 'stereoselective synthesis', producing a compound with a defined stereochemistry. While today a typical synthetic route routinely involves such a procedure, Woodward was a pioneer in showing how, with exhaustive and rational planning, one could conduct reactions that were stereoselective. Many of his syntheses involved forcing a molecule into a certain configuration by installing rigid structural elements in it, another tactic that has become standard today. In this regard, especially his syntheses of reserpine and strychnine were landmarks.|$|E
25|$|The 2008 {{campaign}} was again plagued by injuries. Things then got worse as they relinquished their Ulster title to Down after a replay in which Down {{won by a}} point after 160 minutes. After two wins in the Football Qualifiers against Louth at Drogheda and Westmeath at Healy Park in Omagh, they faced Mayo in Round 3 in Croke Park for {{a place in the}} quarter finals. Tyrone defeated Mayo 0–13 to 1–9, earning Tyrone a place in the quarter finals (last 8) of the championship, where they faced Leinster champions Dublin in a repeat of the 2005 final clash. Tyrone made the brighter start to this game, and goals from Sean Cavanagh and Joe McMahon put Tyrone 2–5 to 1–3 up at the break. A third goal by David Harte in the second half ended the game as a contest, Tyrone winning 3–14 to 1–8. Tyrone then faced Wexford for a place in the senior football final but earlier in the day it was the Tyrone minors who booked their place in the final with a complete football performance, and eased past Meath on a scoreline of 1–21 to 2–7. They faced Mayo in the final. The seniors then <b>always</b> <b>looked</b> comfortable in their meeting with Wexford, and after racking up an 8-point lead at half-time they went through on a score of 0–23 to 1–14, to set up a 21 September date with All Ireland champions Kerry. In a thrilling All-Ireland Final Tyrone defeated Kerry 1–15 to 0–14 to win the Sam Maguire Cup for the third time. A week later the Tyrone Minor team defeated Mayo 1–20 to 1–15 in a replay to win the Thomas Markham Cup. Thus Tyrone became the first county since Kerry in 1980 to win All-Ireland Senior and Minor titles in the same year, and the first Ulster county ever to gain this achievement.|$|E
25|$|Doug Wright {{was seen}} as England's trump card {{when he arrived in}} Australia, but he was either the unluckiest or the most over-rated spinner to tour Australia. Don Bradman said he was the best leg-spinner to tour Australia since Sydney Barnes 35 years before, and Keith Miller thought he was the best leg-spinner he knew after Bill O'Reilly. After Tich Freeman retired Wright became Kent's main spinner, taking 2,056 wickets (23.98) and a record seven first class hat-tricks. His long rollicking run up and brisk pace gave away many no-balls and too often he served up full tosses and long hops, but he turned the ball {{fiercely}} and his googly had even the best batsmen groping. His ability to run through a side made him the terror of the County circuit, but he rarely achieved this in Tests. In the Fifth Test at Sydney his 7/105 dismissed Australia for 253 and in 1947 his 10/175 in the Second Test gave England a 10 wicket victory over South Africa. His great asset was that he <b>always</b> <b>looked</b> as if he was about to take a wicket, but in Australia in 1946–47 and again in 1950–51 he proved too expensive and like Bedser was overbowled. Their second leg-spinner was Peter Smith, who was preferred to Eric Hollies because of his batting, but he injured a finger on the journey to Australia and had an appendix removed once there. Even so, he was effective in tour matches - his 9/121 against NSW is the best bowling return by an Englishman in Australia - but was understandably below par in his only Test. James Langridge was a veteran Slow Left Arm bowler who started his trade in 1924, and had taken 92 wickets (22.11) in 1946, but he was 41 years old on his first tour of Australia and just when he appeared to be finding his form he strained a muscle and could not play. Jack Ikin was a part-time leg-spinner whose bowling was thought to be of all round status early in his career (helped by the very poor wickets at Old Trafford), but Hammond used him rarely and he proved to be expensive in the Tests.|$|E

500|$|Mandela was {{a private}} person who often {{concealed}} his emotions and confided in very few people. Privately, he lived an austere life, refusing to drink alcohol or smoke, and even as President made his own bed.
