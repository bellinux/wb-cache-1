50|$|As of 1980, of {{the total}} number Armenian men 16 and older, 25% worked as {{executives}} <b>and</b> <b>professionals.</b> Of the same total, 44% were craftsmen and operators.

30|$|Employers <b>and</b> <b>professionals</b> earn a {{statistically}} significant premium of over 50 percent in low and upper middle income countries (Table  3 b). This premium falls to 8 percent and becomes statistically insignificant in high income countries. Figure  1 c presents earnings differentials between employers <b>and</b> <b>professionals</b> vs. employees for the each country in our sample. Employers <b>and</b> <b>professionals</b> earn a premium in most low and middle income countries compared to employees. In many high income countries employers <b>and</b> <b>professionals</b> face a penalty compared to employees, and in countries where they earn a premium compared to employees the premium tends to be small.|$|R
30|$|Across all countries, on average, we {{find that}} {{employers}} <b>and</b> own-account <b>professionals</b> enjoy an earnings premium compared to employees, with major {{differences between men and}} women. While earnings premiums for employers <b>and</b> <b>professionals</b> are largest for men in middle income and Latin American countries, their female counterparts consistently earn a penalty in all countries (or an insignificant premium). Further, {{we find that}} neither male nor female employers <b>and</b> <b>professionals</b> earn premiums in Europe and Central Asia. This we believe might be due to fundamental differences in labor market and other regulations and laws, which can directly affect earnings premiums/penalties, between Latin America where employers <b>and</b> <b>professionals</b> are favored <b>and</b> Europe and Central Asia where employers <b>and</b> <b>professionals</b> are penalized.|$|R

30|$|On average, {{across all}} {{countries}} in the sample, employers <b>and</b> own-account <b>professional</b> workers earn a premium compared to employees, although there are important differences across countries and between men and women. Gender differences are particularly strong when examining earnings premiums for employers <b>and</b> <b>professionals.</b> Overall, male employers <b>and</b> <b>professionals</b> earn an 18 percent premium compared with all employees, while women face a penalty of roughly the same magnitude. In terms of regional differences, earnings premiums for employers <b>and</b> <b>professionals</b> are largest for men in middle income Latin American countries. On the other hand, women employers <b>and</b> <b>professionals</b> do not earn a statistically significant premium compared to employees in any region of the world. In addition, neither male nor female employers <b>and</b> <b>professionals</b> earn premiums in either high income or developing countries in Europe and Central Asia. Conditions appear to be favorable for employers <b>and</b> <b>professionals</b> in Latin America, as they are more numerous and earn greater premiums versus formal employees. In contrast, conditions seem to be less favorable for the same group in Europe and Central Asia, where they are fewer and do not earn premiums vs. formal employees.|$|R
