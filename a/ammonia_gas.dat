5|$|Dichlorine {{monoxide}} (Cl2O) is a brownish-yellow gas (red-brown when solid or liquid) {{which may}} be obtained by reacting chlorine gas with yellow mercury(II) oxide. It is very soluble in water, {{in which it is}} in equilibrium with hypochlorous acid (HOCl), which it is the anhydride of. It is thus an effective bleach and is mostly used to make hypochlorites. It explodes on heating or sparking or in the presence of <b>ammonia</b> <b>gas.</b>|$|E
5|$|Quatermass {{agrees to}} {{accompany}} Dillon on an {{investigation and the}} pair visit the farmer, who refuses to talk and sends them away. At a pub, they {{find out that the}} nearby village of Winnerden Flats has been leveled to build an enormous industrial plant protected by armed guards, which is identical to Quatermass' moonbase design. Upon investigating a newly fallen meteorite, Dillon is sprayed from it with <b>ammonia</b> <b>gas,</b> and a distinctive mark appears on his face.|$|E

The guards kill them by blocking the pipe with their bodies. In anger, the remaining workers fire on the dome with a bazooka, igniting the hydrogen and subsequently destroying the entire plant, killing the ammonids and releasing <b>ammonia</b> <b>gas</b> into the surrounding area.|$|E

5|$|If early {{tetrapods}} {{lived in}} freshwater, {{and if they}} {{lost the ability to}} produce urea and used ammonia only, they would have to evolve it from scratch again later. Not a single species of all the ray-finned fishes living today has been able to do that, so it is not likely the tetrapods would have done so either. Terrestrial animals that can only produce ammonia would have to drink constantly, making a life on land impossible (a few exceptions exist, as some terrestrial woodlice can excrete their nitrogenous waste as <b>ammonia</b> <b>gas).</b> This probably also was a problem at the start when the tetrapods started to spend time out of water, but eventually the urea system would dominate completely. Because of this it is not likely they emerged in freshwater (unless they first migrated into freshwater habitats and then migrated onto land so shortly after that they still retained the ability to make urea), although some species never left, or returned to, the water could of course have adapted to freshwater lakes and rivers.|$|E
5|$|Neptunium nitride (NpN) {{was first}} {{prepared}} in 1953 by reacting neptunium hydride and <b>ammonia</b> <b>gas</b> at around 750°C in a quartz capillary tube. Later, it {{was produced by}} reacting different mixtures of nitrogen and hydrogen with neptunium metal at various temperatures. It has also been created by the reduction of neptunium dioxide with diatomic nitrogen gas at 1550°C. NpN is isomorphous with uranium mononitride (UN) and plutonium mononitride (PuN) and has a melting point of 2830°C under a nitrogen pressure of around 1 MPa. Two neptunium phosphide compounds have been reported, NpP and Np3P4. The first has a face centered cubic structure and is prepared by converting neptunium metal to a powder and then reacting it with phosphine gas at 350°C. Np3P4 can be created by reacting neptunium metal with red phosphorus at 740°C in a vacuum and then allowing any extra phosphorus to sublimate away. The compound is non-reactive with water but will react with nitric acid to produce Np(IV) solution.|$|E

25|$|The {{conversion}} of ammonium to nitrate is performed primarily by soil-living bacteria and other nitrifying bacteria. In the primary stage of nitrification, the oxidation of ammonium (NH) is performed by bacteria {{such as the}} Nitrosomonas species, which converts ammonia to nitrites (NO). Other bacterial species such as Nitrobacter, {{are responsible for the}} oxidation of the nitrites (NO) into nitrates (NO). It is important for the ammonia (NH) to be converted to nitrates or nitrites because <b>ammonia</b> <b>gas</b> is toxic to plants.|$|E
25|$|The above {{reaction}} can {{be carried}} out by either of two methods: catalyzed gas-phase production or high pressure liquid-phase production. In one method, molten urea is introduced onto a fluidized bed with catalyst for reaction. Hot <b>ammonia</b> <b>gas</b> is also present to fluidize the bed and inhibit deammonization. The effluent then is cooled. Ammonia and carbon dioxide in the off-gas are separated from the melamine-containing slurry. The slurry is further concentrated and crystallized to yield melamine. Major manufacturers and licensors such as Orascom Construction Industries, BASF, and Eurotecnica have developed some proprietary methods.|$|E
25|$|Another way to {{increase}} the yield of the reaction would be to remove the product (i.e. <b>ammonia</b> <b>gas)</b> from the system. In practice, gaseous ammonia is not removed from the reactor itself, since the temperature is too high; it {{is removed from the}} equilibrium mixture of gases leaving the reaction vessel. The hot gases are cooled enough, whilst maintaining a high pressure, for the ammonia to condense and be removed as liquid. Unreacted hydrogen and nitrogen gases are then returned to the reaction vessel to undergo further reaction.|$|E

40|$|With {{the working}} title “Ammonia exchanges above Lille Bøgeskov”, this study {{examines}} the exchanges of <b>ammonia</b> <b>gases</b> between the atmosphere and canopy above a beech forest. In particular, the study examines the relation between surface-atmosphere gas exchanges {{and the development of}} the canopy during defoliation. Measured in the study are four parameters reflecting the development of the condition of the canopy, respectively the stomatal resistance, Leaf Area Index (LAI), the leaf nitrogen concentration on canopy scale, which are all measured manually, and canopy CO 2 -fluxes measured above the forest. Each of the four parameters reflects in different ways the activity level of the canopy, which are descending during the measuring period. This study aims to support newer research which shows, that forests, as previously thought, do not only function as sink for <b>ammonia</b> <b>gases</b> but in specific periods also function as a source. The study is based on measurements that were taken from the forest called Lille Bøgeskov, (translated to Small Beech Forest) near Sorø in Denmark at fall 2012. The manual measurements were collected approximately once a week during the period 2 nd – 23 rd of October. The data were measured by Ph. d–student Kristina Hansen, while CO 2 -fluxes and meteorological data were measured by Risø research center. Results of the measurements are showing tendencies in agreement with newer research that the forest during defoliation also will work as source with ammonia emission to the atmosphere. But due to a short measurement period and missing data of the ammonia fluxes for the specific measurement period, the study is not able to conclude whether {{one or more of the}} parameters measured in the study in greater magnitude are related to the ammonia fluxes.
