5|$|Bumblebee {{species are}} declining in Europe, North America, and Asia {{due to a}} number of factors, {{including}} land-use change that reduces their food plants. In North America, pathogens are possibly having a stronger negative effect especially for the subgenus Bombus. A major impact on bumblebees was caused by the mechanisation of agriculture, accelerated by the urgent need to increase food production during the Second World War. Small farms depended on horses to pull implements and carts. The horses were fed on clover and hay, both of which were permanently grown on a typical farm. Little <b>artificial</b> <b>fertiliser</b> was used. Farms thus provided flowering clover and flower-rich meadows, favouring bumblebees. Mechanisation removed the need for horses and most of the clover; artificial fertilisers encouraged the growth of taller grasses, outcompeting the meadow flowers. Most of the flowers, and the bumblebees that fed on them, disappeared from Britain by the early 1980s. The last native British short-haired bumblebee was captured near Dungeness in 1988. This significant increase in pesticide and fertilizer use associated with the industrialization of agriculture has had adverse effects on the Bombus genus. The bees are directly exposed to the chemicals in two ways: by consuming nectar that has been directly treated with pesticide, or through physical contact with treated plants and flowers. The species Bombus hortorum in particular {{has been found to be}} impacted by the pesticides; their brood development has been reduced and their memory has been negatively affected. Additionally, pesticide use negatively impacts colony development and size.|$|E

50|$|In practice, the consumption-labour-balance {{principle}} {{means that}} accounting {{is not as}} precise on a farm than in a regular financial capitalist company. This, {{as there is no}} separation between capital and labour. Accounting works with an artificial cost structure which charges all kinds of costs which in reality, a farm does not have. For example, wage and farm-grown animals as well as organic fertiliser and animal feed are charged against commercial (<b>artificial)</b> <b>fertiliser</b> and composed animal feeds. A bought tractor is written off in four years against the bought value while the farmer often buys a second secondhand tractor and carries along with it for another 15 years.|$|E
50|$|Amongst {{the goods}} {{delivered}} to Göhrde were food, {{in the form}} of part-piece loads, and <b>artificial</b> <b>fertiliser,</b> briquets and coke, peat, sugar beet scraps and other feedstuffs in full wagon loads. Goods dipatched included eating and seed potatoes, sugar beet, straw, hay, pit props, oak, beech and spruce logs, animals for slaughter and for breeding.

In the 1920s wood for dolphins was delivered from Göhrde to Hamburg Harbour and, in the post-war years, large quantities of pit props were sent to the Ruhr area. Sugar beet was loaded here until the late 1980s. In the last years before the goods facilities were closed logs were the only freight to be loaded at Göhrde.|$|E

5000|$|The folk in {{the area}} around the Sieben Steinhäuser and the Falkenberg {{suffered}} much during the Thirty Years War, especially in those villages that lay on the routes taken by the Army. The life of its farmers was for a long time dependent on sheep farming, but this faded into the background {{during the first half of}} the 19th century and the whole landschape changed and fields were cultivated on the heathland with its loamy, sandy soils. The herds of moorland sheep, the Heidschnucke, disappeared as the tracts of heathland were afforested and made way for plantations of beech, oak and spruce, resulting in the emergence of mixed woods. Many attempts were made in the eastern Heidmark to make economic progress. The discovery of <b>artificial</b> <b>fertiliser</b> enabled the heathland farmers to become genuinely self-sufficient. They earned more income from their fields and were able to sell grain and fruit.|$|E
50|$|In 1902, {{the mill}} {{was sold to}} Jan Rietema of Leens. A Deutz petrol engine was {{installed}} in that year as auxiliary power. In 1906, the petrol engine {{was replaced by a}} steam engine. Rietema worked the mill until 1919 when he left to take the oil mill Tjamsweer at Appingedam, Groningen. The steam engine was removed at that date. The mill was then sold to the coöperatieve olieslagerij en korenmalerij Woldzigt G.A. It was worked by Jan Faber who had been employed at the mill since 1912. During this time the mill was used to produce cattle food and <b>artificial</b> <b>fertiliser.</b> In 1941, the mill ceased to produce oil. The mill was sold to the Coöperatieve Zuivelfabriek Roden-Zevenhuizen in 1945. Jan Faber died in 1946.

50|$|After the {{depression}} of the 1820s and early 1830s there followed a period of agricultural prosperity generally known as High Farming.

The beginning of the return to prosperity in Lawshall is shown by the population reaching its highest ever total of 925 in 1841.|$|R
50|$|For centuries, the {{historical}} basket or heath beehive produced honey and beeswax on the Lüneburg Heath. In the Middle Ages heather honey was a sought-aftern commodity. Beekeeping was {{common in the}} core areas of the former heath, so that almost every farmstead had a Bienenzaun. The farmers employed special beekeeping hands for this purpose. The town of Celle on the Südheide was a major trading centre for heather honey. As early as the 16th century there was a professional apiculture centre. It declined {{during the second half}} of the 19th century for a number of reasons, which led to the retreat of the areas of heathland. As a result of land consolidation there were no areas of common land with their wide range of nectar-producing plants. The introduction of <b>artificial</b> <b>fertiliser</b> enabled better harvest yields from heath soils and so areas of heath were turned into arable land. Marshland soils with buckwheat cultivation were turned into meadows for cattle. In addition, large areas of heath were reforested with fast-growing pines. Today there are only a very few apiaries left on the Lüneburg Heath which keep bees in {{the historical}} way. These also produce comb honey which is a speciality today due to its rarity. Comb honey is a honeycomb filled with heather honey.|$|E

50|$|In the GDR period, the potash mine, {{now known}} as the “Thomas Müntzer” mine, was the largest {{employer}} in the region. From 1955 to 1961 the number of employees rose from 25 to nearly 300. Even in 1939, the mine had been the main potash source for the German war effort and was considered to be “Rüstungsindustriestufe SS” (“Armaments Industry - SS level”). It was the only mine delivering 98 to 99% by weight potassium chloride at the highest purity grade. These salts were used to produce explosives and other compounds important for the war effort. In 1977, the potassium salt was granted the “K1 price supplement” due to its consistent quality, receiving the “Q” quality mark two years later. From 1985 onwards the mine was the sole supplier of car seat position adjusters for the Wartburg. The mine also produced skylights and <b>artificial</b> <b>fertiliser.</b> In 1993, the mining company was closed. The closing of mine shafts resulted in nationwide attention for the potash miners, who took part in a lot of industrial action (Hunger strikes and a march to Berlin) under the slogan “Bischofferode ist überall” (“Bischofferode is everywhere”). Mining was of great importance for the neighbouring villages and created over 1,000 jobs. The economy of the region was slow to recover from this shock.
