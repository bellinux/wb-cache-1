5|$|Lifting off and {{entering}} orbit, Ross attempts to dock with Phoenix. However, Doppelganger experiences a technical malfunction. The shuttle detaches from Phoenix and falls {{through the atmosphere}} towards the Space Centre. EUROSEC is unable to repair the fault from the ground, and Doppelganger crashes into <b>a</b> <b>parked</b> spacecraft. Ross is incinerated in the collision and a chain reaction destroys much of the Space Centre, killing personnel and destroying all records of Ross's presence on the Counter-Earth.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} {{took one}} {{life in the}} state and indirectly contributed to two additional deaths. In Daytona Beach, a tree struck <b>a</b> <b>parked</b> vehicle, killing a person inside. The exact cause of the tree's uprooting was unknown, although it may have been hit by lightning or a short-lived tornado. Elsewhere, two individuals died of heart attacks: one while installing storm shutters on his home, and another at a designated shelter.|$|E

Unfortunately, the truck belongs to a folding mattress company and Doofenshmirtz is crushed by the mattress and then crushed by his own robot immediately afterwards.|$|E
5|$|The Boeing 777 was {{introduced}} in 1994 and is generally regarded as having an excellent safety record. Since its first commercial flight in June 1995, the type has suffered only five other hull losses: British Airways Flight 38 in 2008; a cockpit fire in <b>a</b> <b>parked</b> EgyptAir Flight 667 at Cairo International Airport in 2011; the crash of Asiana Airlines Flight 214 in 2013, in which three people died; and Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, which was shot down over Ukraine with 298 people aboard in July 2014; in August 2016, the sixth hull-loss of the type occurred, when a 777-300 crashed while landing and caught fire at Dubai Airport {{at the end of}} its flight as Emirates Flight 521.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, Iranian {{students}} {{seized the}} American embassy in Tehran {{and held the}} embassy staff hostage; the first rescue operation, code-named Eagle Claw ended in failure due to equipment and coordination problems, culminating in the crash of a RH-53D Sea Stallion helicopter into <b>a</b> <b>parked</b> C-130 Hercules in the Iranian desert, killing eight servicemen. A second rescue attempt, Operation Credible Sport, was ordered, and Brown was involved in planning and preparation. The follow-up rescue included U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy and Army assets. The Army units involved were the battalions {{that made up the}} 101st Aviation Group: the 158th Aviation Battalion, the 229th Aviation Battalion and the 159th Aviation Battalion. All three battalions formed Task Force 158. President Carter meanwhile appointed the former Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral James L. Holloway, III, to head a commission to study the deficiencies revealed by the failure of Eagle Claw. Among the presented findings {{was the fact that the}} military lacked aircraft and crews who were trained and prepared to perform these mission types.|$|E
40|$|Various {{examples}} {{are related to}} parking management, including identifying and reserving empty parking spaces. In one example, <b>a</b> smart <b>parking</b> space system includes <b>a</b> <b>parking</b> controller located at <b>a</b> <b>parking</b> space.

In another example, a computing device can receive parking vacancy data associated with <b>a</b> <b>parking</b> space from <b>a</b> <b>parking</b> controller; determine <b>a</b> <b>parking</b> vacancy associated with the parking space using the parking vacancy data; and encode for display on a client device a network page that includes an indication of the parking vacancy associated with the parking space...|$|R

5|$|Unprecedented {{security}} measures {{were made by}} the Turkish government to safeguard the NATO summit from terrorist attacks. They especially feared a repetition of the Istanbul bombings of 2003 that killed more than 60 people. Their fear was proven by the arrest of 16 people in Bursa in early May on suspicion of planning to bomb the summit. Police seized guns, explosives, bomb-making booklets and 4,000 compact discs with training advice from Osama Bin Laden, and believed that the suspects were members of the radical Islamic group Ansar al-Islam, thought to be linked with al-Qaeda. On June 24 two bombs also exploded. One bomb went off in a bus in Istanbul killing 4 people (including the bomber), the other outside a hotel in Ankara where US president George W. Bush would be staying. Additionally, on June 25, explosives were found in <b>a</b> <b>parked</b> car at Istanbul's main airport.|$|E

40|$|Various {{examples}} are provided for smart parking management, which can include navigation.
