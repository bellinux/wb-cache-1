25|$|In February 2014, Airbus Helicopters {{announced}} at Heli-Expo 2014 {{the development of}} an improved variant, the EC225e. The EC225e features numerous changes including new avionics systems, such as the TCAS II collision avoidance system, an <b>automatic</b> <b>identification</b> <b>system,</b> and a specialized rig-approach system; it was also intended to feature an improved Turbomeca Makila 2B engine to increase the EC225e's maximum takeoff weight by 550kg, and an additional fuel tank in the rear baggage compartment to extend its range to 300 nautical miles with up to ten passengers on board. Some, but not all, modifications can be retrofitted onto existing EC225s. In the same announcement, in February 2014, Lease Corporation International said that they had placed a $645million order for 15 EC225e (along with 6 Airbus Helicopters EC175) helicopters as the launch customer.
