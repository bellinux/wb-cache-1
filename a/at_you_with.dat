2500|$|His next film, K. S. Ravikumar's action {{entertainer}} Aadhavan also achieved commercial success, while Suriya's {{depiction of}} a hitman was praised. A critic from Sify.com labelled it as an [...] "out and out Suriya show", stating that [...] "the film rides on {{the magic of the}} actor, and his zany shenanigans alone makes it worth a watch" [...] and Rediff.com cited that [...] "he sings, dances, and fights with absolute sincerity, but when he looks <b>at</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> tears in his eyes in an emotional scene tailor-made for him, the applause hits the roof", concluding that it is [...] "completely his film". In 2010, he had his 25th release with Singam directed by Hari, in which he played the role of a police officer from a small village going to work in the city. The film received [...] to positive reviews with The Hindu noting that [...] "Suriya shows that be it a performance-oriented role or a formulaic concoction he can deliver", while Sify.com stated [...] "Ultimately it is Suriya who carries the film to the winning post. His passion and the way he brings an ordinary regular larger-than-life hero character alive on screen is lesson for other commercial heroes." [...] The film won Suriya the Vijay Award for Best Entertainer again and saw him nominated for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor– Tamil again, and subsequently {{went on to become the}} second highest-grossing film of the year. He made his Bollywood debut in Ram Gopal Varma's two-part political drama Rakta Charitra in 2010 which was released to highly critical acclaim and became a commercial success. [...] Rakta Charitra is also considered as the Most Violent Film in Indian Film industry. Suriya subsequently went on to appear as himself in three consecutive guest appearances, appearing alongside Trisha and Madhavan in a song in Manmadhan Ambu (2010), before also starring in K. V. Anand's Ko and Bala's Avan Ivan (2011).|$|E
2500|$|Zeitgeist {{received}} mixed reviews, {{indicated by}} {{a score of}} 59/100 on Metacritic. Some negative criticism of the album stemmed from the absence of half of the original lineup, with Pitchfork Media's Rob Mitchum suggesting the name was revived for [...] "cash or attention or both." [...] Qs Paul Rees commented that [...] "at least half of Zeitgeist {{is made up of}} grinding songs that amount to riffs, pummelling and little else," [...] and that Zeitgeists emotional range is [...] "limited and wearing", but praised Chamberlin's drumming, stating that he [...] "remains {{one of the most powerful}} drummers in rock." [...] In addition, Modern Drummer proclaimed that the album contains [...] "Chamberlin's greatest drumming ever put to CD." [...] NME gave it a score of five out of ten and said, [...] "It's best treated as a curio in the Smashing Pumpkins' legacy; and for those who grew up on 'Today', '1979' and 'Ava Adore', you're better left with your memories." [...] The A.V. Club gave it a C+ and said that it [...] "ends up sounding like a Corgan career retrospective in B-side form." [...] musicOMH gave it a score of two-and-a-half stars out of five and said, [...] "Recounting such thoughts, by this point almost an hour has been spent in the company of a record which stares back <b>at</b> <b>you</b> <b>with</b> the appeal of an ex you'd rather not have bumped into." [...] Hot Press gave it a mixed review and said, [...] "The best you can offer is that it’s not a disaster – now do you want to tell Billy or should I?" [...] Robert Christgau simply gave the record a [...] "Dud" [...] rating (...) [...] Slant Magazine gave it a score of two out of five and called it [...] "the Pumpkins' most aggressively metal album to date. But heaps of guitars, vocal overdubs, and ridiculous effects don't mask a lack of inventiveness or even plain ol' quality songwriting." [...] Canadian magazine Now also gave it a score of two stars out of five and called it [...] "no-frills rawk that's been dumbed down for mass consumption." [...] Melodic magazine gave it a score of three stars out of five, calling the album a disappointing return of the band. Tiny Mix Tapes gave it a score of one-and-a-half stars out of five and said that [...] "the mixing problems extend far beyond Corgan's voice. The Band of a Hundred Murderous Guitars has turned into a modern-radio-rock band." ...|$|E
