60|$|Sometimes, in {{the cool}} of the evening, when the toils of the {{laboratory}} happened to be suspended, he would walk with the <b>alchymist</b> in what had once been a garden belonging to the mansion.

It was the favourite resort of the <b>alchymist</b> in his hours of relaxation, where he would give full scope to his visionary flights. His mind was tinctured with the Rosicrucian doctrines. He believed in elementary beings; some favourable, others adverse to his pursuits; and, in the exaltation of his fancy, had often imagined that he held communion with them in his solitary walks, about the whispering groves and echoing walls of this old garden.|$|E

60|$|The worthy <b>alchymist</b> {{took up his}} abode {{with his}} children. A pavilion, {{in the garden of}} their palace, was {{assigned}} to him as a laboratory, where he resumed his researches with renovated ardour, after the grand secret. He was now and then assisted by his son-in-law; but the latter slackened grievously in his zeal and diligence, after marriage. Still he would listen with profound gravity and attention to the old man's rhapsodies, and his quotations from Paracelsus, Sandivogius, and Pietro D'Abano, which daily grew longer and longer. In this way the good <b>alchymist</b> lived on quietly and comfortably, to what is called a good old age, that is to say, an age that is good for nothing; and unfortunately for mankind, was hurried out of life in his ninetieth year, just as he was on the point of discovering the Philosopher's Stone.|$|E
60|$|The poor <b>alchymist</b> was {{oppressed by}} many griefs; {{and it was}} not the least, that he had been again {{interrupted}} in his labours on the very point of success. Never was <b>alchymist</b> so near attaining the golden secret--a little longer, and all his hopes would have been realized. The thoughts of these disappointments afflicted him more even than the fear of all that he might suffer from the merciless inquisition. His waking thoughts would follow him into his dreams. He would be transported in fancy to his laboratory, busied again among retorts and alembics, and surrounded by Lully, by D'Abano, by Olybius, and the other masters of the sublime art. The moment of projection would arrive; a seraphic form would rise out of the furnace, holding forth a vessel containing the precious elixir; but, before he could grasp the prize, he would awake, and find himself in a dungeon.|$|E
60|$|The {{conversation}} was artfully {{turned to the}} discussion of elementary beings. The <b>alchymist</b> readily avowed his belief in them; and {{that there had been}} instances of their attending upon philosophers, and administering to their wishes. He related many miracles said to have been performed by Apollonius Thyaneus, through the aid of spirits or demons; insomuch that he was set up by the heathens in opposition to the Messiah; and was even regarded with reverence by many Christians. The familiars eagerly demanded whether he believed Apollonius to be a true and worthy philosopher. The unaffected piety of the <b>alchymist</b> protected him {{even in the midst of}} his simplicity; for he condemned Apollonius as a sorcerer and an impostor. No art could draw from him an admission that he had ever employed or invoked spiritual agencies in the prosecution of his pursuits, though he believed himself to have been frequently impeded by their invisible interference.|$|E
60|$|In this way, matters went on {{for some}} time, at the <b>alchymist's.</b> Day after day was sending the student's gold in vapour up the chimney; every blast of the furnace made him a ducat the poorer, without {{apparently}} helping him a jot nearer to the golden secret. Still the young man stood by, and saw piece after piece disappearing without a murmur: he had daily an opportunity of seeing Inez, and felt as if her favour {{would be better than}} silver or gold, and that every smile was worth a ducat.|$|R
5000|$|In 1650 Siemienowicz {{published}} a notable work, Artis Magnae Artilleriae pars prima (Great Art of Artillery, the First Part). Its name implies a second part, {{and it is}} rumored that he wrote its manuscript before his death. It is also rumored that {{he was killed by}} members of the metallurgy/gunsmith/pyrotechnics guilds, who were opposed to him publishing a book about their secrets, and that they hid or destroyed the manuscript of the second part. Siemienowicz disparaged what he saw as a culture of secrecy based on [...] "canting <b>Alchymists</b> of the times Past...they dealed in nothing but Smoke, yet arrogantly took upon them to be Professors of so noble and excellent an art as Chymistry." ...|$|R
2500|$|In the 19th-century {{revival of}} alchemy, {{the two most}} seminal figures were Mary Anne Atwood and Ethan Allen Hitchcock, who {{independently}} published similar works regarding spiritual alchemy. Both forwarded a completely esoteric view of alchemy, as Atwood claimed: [...] "No modern art or chemistry, notwithstanding all its surreptitious claims, has any thing in common with Alchemy." [...] Atwood's work influenced subsequent authors of the occult revival including Eliphas Levi, Arthur Edward Waite, and Rudolf Steiner. Hitchcock, in his Remarks Upon <b>Alchymists</b> (1855) attempted {{to make a case}} for his spiritual interpretation with his claim that the alchemists wrote about a spiritual discipline under a materialistic guise in order to avoid accusations of blasphemy from the church and state. In 1845, Baron Carl Reichenbach, published his studies on Odic force, a concept with some similarities to alchemy, but his research did not enter the mainstream of scientific discussion.|$|R
60|$|By this time, {{the cries}} of Inez had brought her father and the {{domestic}} into the room. Antonio was found weltering in his blood, and senseless. He was conveyed to the chamber of the <b>alchymist,</b> who now repaid in kind the attentions which the student had once bestowed upon him. Among his varied knowledge he possessed some skill in surgery, which at this moment was of more value than even his chymical lore. He stanched and dressed the wounds of his disciple, which on examination proved less desperate than he had at first apprehended. For a few days, however, his case was anxious, and attended with danger. The old man watched over him with the affection of a parent. He felt a double debt of gratitude towards him, {{on account of his}} daughter and himself; he loved him too as a faithful and zealous disciple; and he dreaded lest the world, should be deprived of the promising talents of so aspiring an <b>alchymist.</b>|$|E
60|$|When {{he called}} again, {{he found the}} <b>alchymist</b> languid and in pain, but {{apparently}} suffering more in mind than in body. His delirium had left him, {{and he had been}} informed of the particulars of his deliverance, and of the subsequent attentions of the scholar. He could do little more than look his thanks, but Antonio did not require them; his own heart repaid him for all that he had done, and he almost rejoiced in the disaster that had gained him an entrance into this mysterious habitation. The <b>alchymist</b> was so helpless as to need much assistance; Antonio remained with him, therefore, the greater part of the day. He repeated his visit the next day, and the next. Every day his company seemed more pleasing to the invalid; and every day he felt his interest in the latter increasing. Perhaps the presence of the daughter might have been at the bottom of this solicitude.|$|E
60|$|What eloquence he {{had used}} with his father, to {{convince}} him of the innocence, the honour, and the high descent of the <b>alchymist,</b> and of the exalted worth of his daughter, does not appear. All that we know is, that the father, though a very passionate, was a very reasonable man, as appears by his consenting that his son should return to Granada, and conduct Inez as his affianced bride to Valentia.|$|E
5000|$|In 1855, Mackenzie translated, {{from the}} German, J. W. Wolf’s Fairy Tales Collected in the Odenwald (Routledge). Between October 1858 and January 1859, {{at his own}} expense, Mackenzie {{published}} four issues of The Biological Review: A Monthly Repertory of the Science of Life. In 1859, Routledge published Master Tyll Owlglass: His Marvellous Adventures and Rare Conceits, Mackenzie’s translation of the medieval prankster story [...] "Till Eulenspiegel", published in the U.S. in 1860 by Ticknor & Fields. ("The era of its original publication was rife with magicians, astrologers, and <b>alchymists...</b> Cornelius Agrippa very shortly afterwards {{found it necessary to}} protest against the abuse of such subjects in his treatise 'Of the Uncertainty and Vanity of the Sciences and Arts'... Johannes Trithemius was then Abbot of the Benedictine Monastery of Spanheim... but true to its mission of a folkbook, filled with the manners and customs of its time, story of [...] Owlglass is thoroughly worldly and, for us, therefore, possesses greater interest and value.") ...|$|R
60|$|The {{next day}} passed without the {{appearance}} of Antonio at the <b>alchymist's.</b> Another, and another day succeeded, and yet he did not come; nor had any thing been heard of him at his lodgings. His absence caused, at first, surprise and conjecture, and at length alarm. Inez recollected the singular intimations of the ballad-singer upon the mountain, which seemed to warn her of impending danger, and her mind was full of vague forebodings. She sat listening to every sound at the gate, or footstep on the stairs. She would take up her guitar and strike a few notes, {{but it would not}} do; her heart was sickening with suspense and anxiety. She had never before felt what it was to be really lonely. She now was conscious of the force of that attachment which had taken possession of her breast; for never do we know how much we love, never do we know how necessary the object of our love is to our happiness, until we experience the weary void of separation.|$|R
60|$|All {{the devices}} of inquisitorial {{ingenuity}} {{were employed to}} ensnare the old man, and to draw from him evidence that might be brought against himself, and might corroborate certain secret information that had been given against him. He {{had been accused of}} practising necromancy and judicial astrology, and a cloud of evidence had been secretly brought forward to substantiate the charge. It would be tedious to enumerate all the circumstances, apparently corroborative, which had been industriously cited by the secret accuser. The silence which prevailed about the tower, its desolateness, the very quiet of its inhabitants, had been adduced as proofs that something sinister was perpetrated within. The <b>alchymist's</b> conversations and soliloquies in the garden had been overheard and misrepresented. The lights and strange appearances at night, in the tower, were given with violent exaggerations. Shrieks and yells were said to have been heard from thence at midnight, when, it was confidently asserted, the old man raised familiar spirits by his incantations, and even compelled the dead to rise from their graves, and answer to his questions.|$|R
6000|$|He {{found the}} <b>alchymist</b> still seated in his visionary {{contemplation of the}} moon. [...] "Come hither, my son," [...] said he, with his usual enthusiasm, [...] "come, read with me in this vast volume of wisdom, thus nightly {{unfolded}} for our perusal. Wisely did the Chaldean sages affirm, that the heaven is as a mystic page, uttering speech to those who can rightly understand; warning them of good and evil, and instructing them in the secret decrees of fate." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{will not}} attempt to {{describe}} the scene that ensued; nor the moments of rapture which more than repaid all the sufferings that her affectionate heart had undergone. As soon as their feelings had become more calm, the <b>alchymist</b> stepped out of the room to introduce a stranger, to whom he was indebted for his life and liberty. He returned, leading in Antonio, no longer in his poor scholar's garb, but in the rich dress of a nobleman.|$|E
60|$|The inquisitor {{shook his}} head, {{and went on}} to repeat the various {{inquiries}} that had before been made as to his mode of life and pursuits. The poor <b>alchymist</b> was too feeble and too weary at heart to make any but brief replies. He requested that some man of science might examine his laboratory, and all his books and papers, by which it would be made abundantly evident that he was merely engaged in the study of alchymy.|$|E
40|$|I {{have chosen}} to be {{assessed}} as an interpreter and conductor of New Music for British Brass Band. This critical evaluation represents a summary of my work on the four required projects of the DMA course, in which I hope to demonstrate {{a high level of}} creative interpretation. This evaluation will also demonstrate my ability to show original insights into certain musical works and formulate sound critical judgments in order to elicit performances which have been critically acclaimed by my peers within this chosen medium. Project One aims to demonstrate a capacity for producing perceptive and imaginative musical interpretations in preparing and conducting the first commercial recording of brass music of Arthur Butterworth (DOYCD 130). As will be argued elsewhere, Butterworth is a nationally recognized figure {{with a wide range of}} musical publications, and this recording includes four world premiere recordings of the composer's work and a new commission, Sinfonia Concertante. Project Two is a further CD recording entitled The Brass Music of Michael Ball 1 (DOYCD 135). This presents a programme of highly crafted pieces of the composer's wide style and approach. There are five world premiere recordings which offer new insights into the composer's work as well as new interpretations of his work in fine performances. This project also includes an examination of a new work, A Cambrian Suite, jointly commissioned by the Black Dyke Band and the Brass Band Heritage Trust, first performed at the Royal Concert Hall at the RNCM on the 18 th February as part of the Festival of Brass 2002. Project Three consists of two live recordings, produced digitally, and stored on single Compact Discs. The two works Sinfonia Concertante Arthur Butterworth and Atlantic Philip Wilby were premiered respectively at the Harrogate International Music Festival, July 28 th 2001 and The Festival of Brass January 18 th 2002. Both these composers enjoy high status as nationally recognised composers, and their premiere performances offer significant first insights into the works in question. I would argue that this demonstrates a capacity for eliciting imaginative musical interpretations from a highly talented group of musicians. During my DMA registration I have performed ten world premieres: Masque, Danceries, and <b>Alchymist's</b> Journal by Kenneth Hesketh., Sinfonia Concertante Opus 111 by Arthur Butterworth, Atlantic and Concerto 1945 by Philip Wilby, Call of the Cossacks by Peter Graham, The Sword and the Crown by Edward Gregson, A Cambrian Suite by Michael Ball and Trombone Concerto by Martin Ellerby. This range of performances displays my commitment to developing the repertoire of the Brass Band Movement. I have also undertaken eight studio recording projects, The Eternal Quest QPRL 21 ID, The Essential Dyke Vol. Ill DOYCD 121, Spectacular Classics Vol. IIOBR 876, The Music of Arthur Butterworth DOYCD 130, The Music of Michael Ball DOYCD 135, Black Dyke Plays Verdi OBR 883, The Heaton Collection SP&S 100, Call of the Cossacks DOYCDI 38. These projects represent an endeavour to unveil and demonstrate the level of expertise and flexibility available in the current British Brass Band movement, which draws its influences from sources as diverse as Classical, Contemporary, Popular, and World Musics. Project Four A public performance will be given by the Black Dyke Band conducted by myself as part of the National Brass Band Championship of Great Britain, in the Royal Albert Hall on 19 th October 2002. This will give the examiners the opportunity to judge my abilities for themselves...|$|R
6000|$|Thrice, with a prophet's voice, and prophet's power, [...] The Muse {{was called}} in a poetic hour, And insolently thrice the slighted maid Dared to suspend her unregarded aid; Then with that grief we form in spirits divine, Pleads for her own neglect, and thus reproaches mine. [...] Once highly honoured! false is the pretence You make to truth, retreat, and innocence! Who, to pollute my shades, bring'st with thee down The most ungenerous vices of the town; Ne'er sprung a youth from out this isle before I once esteem'd, and loved, and favour'd more, Nor ever maid endured such courtlike scorn, So much in mode, so very city-born; 'Tis with a foul design the Muse you send, Like a cast mistress, to your wicked friend; But find some new address, some fresh deceit, Nor {{practise}} such an antiquated cheat; These are the beaten methods of the stews, Stale forms, of course, all mean deceivers use, Who barbarously think to 'scape reproach, By prostituting her they first debauch. [...] Thus did the Muse severe unkindly blame This offering long design'd to Congreve's fame; First chid the zeal as unpoetic fire, Which soon his merit forced her to inspire; Then call this verse, that speaks her largest aid, The greatest compliment she ever made, And wisely judge, no power beneath divine Could leap the bounds which part your world and mine; For, youth, believe, to you unseen, is fix'd A mighty gulf, unpassable betwixt. [...] Nor tax the goddess of a mean design To praise your parts by publishing of mine; That be my thought when some large bulky writ Shows in the front the ambition of my wit; There to surmount what bears me up, and sing Like the victorious wren perch'd on the eagle's wing. This could I do, and proudly o'er him tower, Were my desires but heighten'd to my power. [...] Godlike the force of my young Congreve's bays, Softening the Muse's thunder into praise; Sent to assist an old unvanquish'd pride That looks with scorn on half mankind beside; A pride that well suspends poor mortals' fate, Gets between them and my resentment's weight, Stands in the gap 'twixt me and wretched men, T'avert th'impending judgments of my pen. [...] Thus I look down with mercy on the age, By hopes my Congreve will reform the stage: For never did poetic mind before Produce a richer vein, or cleaner ore; The bullion stamp'd in your refining mind Serves by retail to furnish half mankind. With indignation I behold your wit Forced on me, crack'd, and clipp'd, and counterfeit, By vile pretenders, who a stock maintain From broken scraps and filings of your brain. Through native dross your share is hardly known, And by short views mistook for all their own; So small the gains those from your wit do reap, Who blend it into folly's larger heap, Like the sun's scatter'd beams which loosely pass, When some rough hand breaks the assembling glass. [...] Yet want your critics no just cause to rail, Since knaves are ne'er obliged for what they steal. These pad on wit's high road, and suits maintain With those they rob, by what their trade does gain. Thus censure seems that fiery froth which breeds O'er the sun's face, and from his heat proceeds, Crusts o'er the day, shadowing its partent beam, As ancient nature's modern masters dream; This bids some curious praters here below Call Titan sick, because their sight is so; And well, methinks, does this allusion fit To scribblers, and the god of light and wit; Those who by wild delusions entertain A lust of rhyming for a poet's vein, Raise envy's clouds to leave themselves in night, But can no more obscure my Congreve's light, Than swarms of gnats, that wanton in a ray Which gave them birth, can rob the world of day. [...] What northern hive pour'd out these foes to wit? Whence came these Goths to overrun the pit? How would you blush the shameful birth to hear Of those you so ignobly stoop to fear; For, ill to them, long have I travell'd since, Round all the circles of impertinence, Search'd in the nest where every worm did lie Before it grew a city butterfly; I'm sure I found them other kind of things Than those with backs of silk and golden wings; A search, no doubt, as curious and as wise As virtuosoes' in dissecting flies: For, could you think? the fiercest foes you dread, And court in prologues, all are country bred; Bred in my scene, and for the poet's sins Adjourn'd from tops and grammar to the inns; Those beds of dung, where schoolboys sprout up beaux Far sooner than the nobler mushroom grows: These are the lords of the poetic schools, Who preach the saucy pedantry of rules; Those powers the critics, who may boast the odds O'er Nile, with all its wilderness of gods; Nor could the nations kneel to viler shapes, Which worshipp'd cats, and sacrificed to apes; And can you think the wise forbear to laugh At the warm zeal that breeds this golden calf? [...] Haply you judge these lines severely writ Against the proud usurpers of the pit; Stay while I tell my story, short, and true; To draw conclusions shall be left to you; Nor need I ramble far to force a rule, But lay the scene just here at Farnham[1] school. [...] Last year, a lad hence by his parents sent With other cattle to the city went; Where having cast his coat, and well pursued The methods most in fashion to be lewd, Return'd a finish'd spark this summer down, Stock'd with the freshest gibberish of the town; A jargon form'd from the lost language, wit, Confounded in that Babel of the pit; Form'd by diseased conceptions, weak and wild, Sick lust of souls, and an abortive child; Born between whores and fops, by lewd compacts, Before the play, or else between the acts; Nor wonder, if from such polluted minds Should spring such short and transitory kinds, Or crazy rules to make us wits by rote, Last {{just as long as}} every cuckoo's note: What bungling, rusty tools are used by fate! 'Twas in an evil hour to urge my hate, My hate, whose lash just Heaven has long decreed Shall on a day make sin and folly bleed: When man's ill genius to my presence sent This wretch, to rouse my wrath, for ruin meant; Who in his idiom vile, with Gray's-Inn grace, Squander'd his noisy talents to my face; Named every player on his fingers' ends, Swore all the wits were his peculiar friends; Talk'd with that saucy and familiar ease Of Wycherly, and you, and Mr. Bayes:[2] Said, how a late report your friends had vex'd, Who heard you meant to write heroics next; For, tragedy, he knew, would lose you quite, And told you so at Will's[3] but t'other night. [...] Thus are the lives of fools a sort of dreams, Rendering shades things, and substances of names; Such high companions may delusion keep, Lords are a footboy's cronies in his sleep. As a fresh miss, by fancy, face, and gown, Render'd the topping beauty of the town, Draws every rhyming, prating, dressing sot, To boast of favours that he never got; Of which, whoe'er lacks confidence to prate, Brings his good parts and breeding in debate; And not the meanest coxcomb you can find, But thanks his stars, that Phillis has been kind; Thus prostitute my Congreve's name is grown To every lewd pretender of the town. Troth, I could pity you; but this is it, You find, to be the fashionable wit; These are the slaves whom reputation chains, Whose maintenance requires no help from brains. For, should the vilest scribbler to the pit, Whom sin and want e'er furnish'd out a wit; Whose name must not within my lines be shown, Lest here it live, when perish'd with his own;[4] Should such a wretch usurp my Congreve's place, And choose out wits who ne'er have seen his face; I'll bet my life but the dull cheat would pass, Nor need the lion's skin conceal the ass; Yes, that beau's look, that vice, those critic ears, Must needs be right, so well resembling theirs. [...] Perish the Muse's hour thus vainly spent In satire, to my Congreve's praises meant; In how ill season her resentments rule, What's that to her if mankind be a fool? Happy beyond a private Muse's fate, In pleasing all that's good among the great,[5] Where though her elder sisters crowding throng, She still is welcome with her innocent song; Whom were my Congreve blest to see and know, What poor regards would merit all below! How proudly would he haste the joy to meet, And drop his laurel at Apollo's feet! [...] Here by a mountain's side, a reverend cave Gives murmuring passage to a lasting wave: 'Tis the world's watery hour-glass streaming fast, Time is no more when th'utmost drop is past; Here, on a better day, some druid dwelt, And the young Muse's early favour felt; Druid, a name she does with pride repeat, Confessing Albion once her darling seat; Far in this primitive cell might we pursue Our predecessors' footsteps still in view; Here would we sing--But, ah! you think I dream, And the bad world may well believe the same; Yes: you are all malicious slanders by, While two fond lovers prate, the Muse and I. [...] Since thus I wander from my first intent, Nor am that grave adviser which I meant, Take this short lesson from the god of bays, And let my friend apply it as he please: Beat not the dirty paths where vulgar feet have trod, [...] But give the vigorous fancy room. [...] For when, like stupid <b>alchymists,</b> you try [...] To fix this nimble god, [...] This volatile mercury, [...] The subtile spirit all flies up in fume; [...] Nor shall the bubbled virtuoso find More than fade insipid mixture left behind.[6] [...] While thus I write, vast shoals of critics come, And on my verse pronounce their saucy doom; The Muse like some bright country virgin shows Fallen by mishap among a knot of beaux; They, in their lewd and fashionable prate, Rally her dress, her language, and her gait; Spend their base coin before the bashful maid, Current like copper, and as often paid: She, who on shady banks has joy'd to sleep Near better animals, her father's sheep, Shamed and amazed, beholds the chattering throng, To think what cattle she is got among; But with the odious smell and sight annoy'd, In haste she does th'offensive herd avoid. [...] 'Tis time to bid my friend a long farewell, The muse retreats far in yon crystal cell; Faint inspiration sickens as she flies, Like distant echo spent, the spirit dies. [...] In this descending sheet you'll haply find Some short refreshment for your weary mind, Nought it contains is common or unclean, And once drawn up, is ne'er let down again.[7] ...|$|R
60|$|One {{among the}} condemned, however, was an {{exception}} to these remarks. It was an aged man, somewhat bowed down, with a serene, though dejected countenance, and a beaming, melancholy eye. It was the <b>alchymist.</b> The populace looked upon him {{with a degree of}} compassion, which they were not prone to feel towards criminals condemned by the inquisition; but when they were told that he was convicted of the crime of magic, they drew back with awe and abhorrence.|$|E
6000|$|His {{property}} had gradually wasted away, in {{the course}} of his travels and his experiments. Still hope, the constant attendant of the <b>alchymist,</b> had led him on; ever on the point of reaping the reward of his labours, and ever disappointed. With the credulity that often attended his art, he attributed many of his disappointments to the machination of the malignant spirits that beset the paths of the <b>alchymist</b> and torment him in his solitary labours. [...] "It is their constant endeavour," [...] he observed, [...] "to close up every avenue to those sublime truths, which would enable man to rise above the abject state into which he has fallen, and to return to his original perfection." [...] To the evil offices of these demons, he attributed his late disaster. He had been on the very verge of the glorious discovery; never were the indications more completely auspicious; all was going on prosperously, when, at the critical moment which should have crowned his labours with success, and have placed him at the very summit of human power and felicity, the bursting of a retort had reduced his laboratory and himself to ruins.|$|E
60|$|The men who {{had seized}} upon the <b>alchymist</b> had, at least, been more honest in their professions. They were, indeed, familiars of the inquisition. He was {{conducted}} in silence to the gloomy prison of that horrible tribunal. It was a mansion whose very aspect withered joy, and almost shut out hope. It {{was one of those}} hideous abodes which the bad passions of men conjure up in this fair world, to rival the fancied dens of demons and the accursed.|$|E
60|$|Felix de Vasques, the <b>alchymist,</b> was {{a native}} of Castile, and of an ancient and honourable line. Early in life he had married a {{beautiful}} female, a descendant from one of the Moorish families. The marriage displeased his father, who considered the pure Spanish blood contaminated by this foreign mixture. It is true, the lady traced her descent from one of the Abencerrages, the most gallant of Moorish cavaliers, who had embraced the Christian faith on being exiled from the walls of Granada.|$|E
60|$|How hard he had studied, {{does not}} remain on record. All {{that we know}} is his romantic {{adventure}} of the tower. It was at first a mere youthful caprice, excited by {{a glimpse of a}} beautiful face. In becoming a disciple of the <b>alchymist,</b> he probably thought of nothing more than pursuing a light love affair.
