The case shows that changing <b>agricultural</b> <b>water</b> management requires a supportive macro-policy environment, and appropriate institutional changes and infrastructural investments.

Numerous natural depressions exist throughout the landscape in the rice belt of the Upper Gulf Coast of Texas, providing temporary wetland habitat for wildlife. The rice-agriculture system also provides shallow and deep water habitats such as flooded rice fields and canals. This study was conducted to compare seasonal use of <b>managed</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>water</b> <b>areas</b> to seasonal use of natural depressions by waterbird species. Study sites (natural depressions, flooded rice fields, canals, ponds, and roost ponds) were randon-dy chosen. Sites were surveyed bimonthly from May 1995 to May 1996, and species and numbers of birds located on or adjacent to the sites were recorded. Bird diversity was significantly (P < 0. 01) higher in roost ponds and rice fields than in canals, ponds, or depressions. Bird diversity was not significantly different among seasons. Bird diversity was significantly correlated with season (!! < 0. 0087) and area of site (P < 0. 000 1).

40|$|Water is an {{important}} element in agricultural production. The recent population growth, rapid urbanization, and fast industrialization present increasing challenges for China's <b>agricultural</b> <b>water</b> use. Embodied water has been promoted as a substantial indicator for the assessment of water consumption induced by human activities. However, few studies have investigated the dynamic change in embodied <b>agricultural</b> <b>water</b> use by time-series data. The findings of such studies may facilitate the development of comprehensive sustainable water-usage strategies. Thus, this study quantifies the embodied <b>agricultural</b> <b>water</b> trade, as and tertiary industries. China has always been a net exporter of <b>agricultural</b> <b>water.</b> At the industrial level, the primary industry is a net importer because of the increasing food demand in China, the secondary industry has consistently been a net exporter, and the tertiary industry has maintained a trade balance. The production- and consumption-based embodied <b>agricultural</b> <b>water</b> uses demonstrate similar changing trends: both decrease from 1997 to 2007 and then significantly increase in 2010. The embodied <b>agricultural</b> <b>water</b> consumed by the primary industry shows a downward trend, whereas those consumed by the secondary and tertiary industries demonstrate an opposite trend.

40|$|The {{management}} {{of protected areas}} in Australia is highly complex. Each state and territory government has its own agency that is broadly responsible for the conservation and {{management of}} areas including wilderness, national parks, forests and marine parks. In addition, there are agencies at the Federal Government level that <b>manage</b> such <b>areas</b> within Commonwealth territories and territorial <b>waters.</b> <b>Managing</b> protected <b>areas</b> in Australia has become more challenging due to increasing levels of visitation {{during the past few}} decades (Wardell & Moore, 2004), which represents not just a potential threat to the conservation of natural and cultural values but a challenge in its own right. The various agencies must not only conserve these values but also provide a broad range of recreational opportunities within their estates, which enable visitors to appreciate the heritage that is being protected. There is consequently a need to understand the desires and expectations of visitors. In these circumstances, monitoring is vital for effective protected area management and requires the systematic gathering, analysis and integration into management systems of data relating to both the natural environment and visitors over time. While monitoring has historically focused on the physical and biological aspects of the environment, the systematic collection of visitor data has been an area generally overlooked by protected area managers who have relied instead on ad hoc approaches (ANZECC, 1996; Archer, Griffin, & Hayes, 2001; Muhar, Arnberger & Brandenburg, 2002; Wardell & Moore, 2004). Australia’s protected areas agencies, in partnership with the Sustainable Tourism Cooperative Research Centre (STCRC), have recognised that this situation needs to be remedied if they are to adequately plan for and manage visitor use over the coming decades. STCRC’s Sustainable Resources Steering Committee identified the need to improve the quantity, quality and range of data relating to visitors to protected areas and, where appropriate, to establish nationally consistent methods of visitor data collection across agencies.
