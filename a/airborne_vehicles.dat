5|$|Pilotwings 64 is a 3D flight {{simulator}} {{in which the}} player must complete a variety of missions involving different <b>airborne</b> <b>vehicles</b> and air sports. Before each mission, the player must choose one of six character pilots, each with their own advantages and disadvantages based on factors such as weight. The tests presented to the player require {{him or her to}} complete an objective in order to earn a license for the given event. Depending on the mission, points are awarded or deducted based on time, damage, fuel usage, accuracy, softness of landing, and similar criteria. The player is awarded either a bronze, silver, or gold license {{based on the number of}} points attained. More difficult tests become available as the player progresses.|$|E

50|$|In the tier-scalable paradigm, ground-tier {{vehicles}} are commanded typically {{through the use}} of local <b>airborne</b> <b>vehicles,</b> such as blimps or balloons. The <b>airborne</b> <b>vehicles</b> contain onboard tracking and command systems for use with the ground-tier vehicles. With a wide field of view, the tracking and commanding systems on board the <b>airborne</b> <b>vehicles</b> determine optimal paths for the ground-tier vehicles, identifying both obstacles and interesting science targets. The ground-tier {{vehicles are}} then commanded to navigate through the operational area to the designated targets, while avoiding the identified obstacles. Therefore, this approach does not rely on the limited horizontal view of the ground-tier vehicles. Each ground-tier vehicle includes its own instrument suite to collect information, which is transmitted back to the airborne tier.|$|E

40|$|A new Fabry-Perot {{interferometer}} (FPI) based light-weight spectrometric camera provides {{new possibilities}} for environmental remote sensing applications. The sensor collects spectral data cubes with adjustable spectral properties in a rectangular image format, and so stereoscopic {{data can be}} obtained by gathering images in block structures with overlapping images. The FPI camera thus enables stereoscopic, spectrometric remote sensing applications with light-weight, low-cost airborne imaging systems. Our objective is to investigate the processing and use of this new imaging technology in a water quality mapping. We carried out imaging campaigns over a small lake in summer and autumn 2012 using a light-weight unmanned <b>airborne</b> <b>vehicle</b> (UAV) and a small manned <b>airborne</b> <b>vehicle</b> (MAV). We present the preliminary results of these campaigns...|$|R

50|$|The tier-scalable {{reconnaissance}} {{paradigm is}} also highly automated. Spaceborne orbiters {{command and control}} the <b>airborne</b> <b>vehicles</b> autonomously, and the <b>airborne</b> <b>vehicles</b> in turn command and control the ground-tier reconnaissance vehicles. This allows orbiters, airships, and rovers {{to act in a}} unified, controlled manner. A mission that uses this paradigm is also considered more survivable. Since the airborne and ground-tier vehicles can be quite inexpensive, even expendable, many such vehicles can be used collectively to explore numerous science targets with complementary suites of instruments. Even if one or more vehicles should fail, others are present to take up the slack and continue the mission.|$|E

40|$|A method using {{unmanned}} <b>airborne</b> <b>vehicle</b> system (UAVS) {{and image}} processing technique to enable estimation of rice yield was developed. A digital Tetracam camera was {{mounted on a}} CropCam unmanned <b>airborne</b> <b>vehicle</b> (UAV) to acquire red (R), green (G) and near infrared (NIR) images of rice crops {{at the height of}} 300 m above ground.   NIR and R values were used to calculate normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) value. Relationships between yield versus R, G, NIR and NDVI values were analysed. Results showed that the highest relationship was found in NDVI followed by R, G and NIR with coefficient of determination (r 2) values of 0. 748, 0. 727, 0. 395 and 0. 014 respectively. Therefore, a yield estimation model using NDVI value was developed from the linear regression analysis. The results showed that the model was capable of estimating rice yield with an average accuracy value of 80. 3 %...|$|R

2500|$|The {{development}} of this 3rd generation <b>airborne</b> combat <b>vehicle</b> was initiated {{during the same time}} frame of the {{development of}} the BMP-3. However, the results of the development showed that the mass of the BMP-3 with landing facilities will significantly exceed 20 tonnes limiting an Il-76 to transporting one vehicle. In the early 1980s, the creation of an <b>airborne</b> combat <b>vehicle</b> was initiated. During the design, two options were considered for the BMD-3. The first one included a chassis weighing over 18 tonnes with a 100mm 2A70 rifled gun and a coaxial 30mm 2A72 autocannon. The second option was to use the combat module with a 30mm 2A42 autocannon. Thus, an IL-76 could be loaded either with two <b>airborne</b> combat <b>vehicles</b> weighing 18 tonnes, or three <b>airborne</b> combat <b>vehicles</b> weighing 12.5 tonnes. Research showed that the latter version of the new BMD-3 ran much more efficiently. On the basis of the experience gained and the results of the research, the Council of Ministers of the USSR and the CPSU number 451-159 officially opened the ROC under the code [...] "Bakhcha" [...] on 20 May 1983. Work included the development of an <b>airborne</b> combat <b>vehicle</b> weighing 12.5 tonnes with the Volgograd tractor factory appointed as the head developer.|$|R
