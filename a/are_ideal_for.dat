5|$|Due to {{the flat}} {{topography}} of Essex County, the land use surrounding Highway77 is almost entirely agricultural. Soil conditions in Essex <b>are</b> <b>ideal</b> <b>for</b> farming, {{and as a result}} very few natural areas {{can be found in the}} county. Many streams have been diverted to irrigate the endless farmland to either side of the highway. Relief from the plain is provided only by the few hamlets along the route. In addition, Lake Erie and Lake St Clair are both a short distance from Highway 77.|$|E
5|$|The Dorset is {{an ancient}} breed that was most likely {{developed}} from horned sheep that lived in the valleys and pastures of southwestern England. Dorset Horn sheep were imported into the United States in 1860, and the first U.S. national flock book was formed in 1891. Today, the Dorset is found in two varieties globally, Horned and Polled. In the Horn variety, both ewes and rams have horns, while the polled variety have no horns at all. Polled Dorsets <b>are</b> <b>ideal</b> <b>for</b> commercial settings {{because they do not}} have horns that can get caught in fencing or cause damage when they butt.|$|E
5|$|The Swiss {{climate is}} {{generally}} temperate, but can vary greatly between the localities, from glacial {{conditions on the}} mountaintops to the often pleasant near Mediterranean climate at Switzerland's southern tip. There are some valley areas {{in the southern part}} of Switzerland where some cold-hardy palm trees are found. Summers tend to be warm and humid at times with periodic rainfall so they <b>are</b> <b>ideal</b> <b>for</b> pastures and grazing. The less humid winters in the mountains may see long intervals of stable conditions for weeks, while the lower lands tend to suffer from inversion, during these periods, thus seeing no sun for weeks.|$|E

5|$|NuScale is {{expected}} to be the first SMR to market, because its cooling is similar to the systems used in conventional power plants. However, alternative cooling systems using molten metals are expected to operate at higher, more efficient temperatures once approved. The company estimates a twelve-unit NuScale plant would cost $5,000 per kilowatt. In comparison, the Energy Information Administration in 2011 estimated costs to be $4,700 per kilowatt for conventional nuclear power, $4,600 for a carbon sequestration coal plant and $931 at a gas-fired plant or in excess of $1,800 for a gas-fired plant with carbon sequestration. David Mohre, executive director of NRECA's Energy and Power Division, said SMR's like NuScale's <b>are</b> <b>ideal</b> <b>for</b> rural towns that need small power plants and do not have access to natural gas. NuScale power plants are also expected to take less time, materials and space to construct than other power sources and can be expanded incrementally to meet changing power needs.|$|E
25|$|Polycyclization enzymes also rely on cation-π interactions. Since proton-triggered polycylizations of {{squalene}} proceed {{through a}} (potentially concerted) cationic cascade, cation-π interactions <b>are</b> <b>ideal</b> <b>for</b> stabilizing this dispersed positive charge. The crystal structure of squalene-hopene cyclase {{shows that the}} active site is lined with aromatic residues.|$|E

25|$|The best-known {{wines from}} the region include Barolo and Barbaresco. They are made from the Nebbiolo grape. These wines <b>are</b> <b>ideal</b> <b>for</b> storage and a well-aged Barolo for {{instance}} may leave a feeling of drinking velvet because the tannins are polished and integrated more and more into the wine. As the wine matures the colour becomes more brownish and rust-red.|$|E

Measurements of mouth dimensions suggest S. vittata is able to extend its jaws further downward compared to co-occurring species, which may answer why it consumes more polychaetes than these species.|$|E
25|$|P. gibbosus prefers nesting {{in sandy}} soil. Because soils with high sand {{composition}} are lighter in weight than {{other types of}} soil, they <b>are</b> <b>ideal</b> <b>for</b> the burrowing behavior of P. gibbosus since sandy soil is easier to dig through. Moreover, the nesting sites are usually centered around some sort of supporting structure, for example underneath bricks, tree roots, or cement. As a result, weedy, sandy areas of earth are strongly preferable as nesting sites for P. gibbosus, which can often be found near coastal areas as a result.|$|E
25|$|Power plant {{capacity}} {{is far greater}} than any individual locomotive uses, so electric locomotives can have a higher power output than diesel locomotives and they can produce even higher short-term surge power for fast acceleration. Electric locomotives <b>are</b> <b>ideal</b> <b>for</b> commuter rail service with frequent stops. They are used on high-speed lines, such as ICE in Germany, Acela in the U.S., Shinkansen in Japan, China Railway High-speed in China and TGV in France. Electric locomotives are used on freight routes with consistently high traffic volumes, or in areas with advanced rail networks.|$|E

25|$|Todos os Santos Bay and Salvador's climatic {{conditions}} <b>are</b> <b>ideal</b> <b>for</b> competition and recreational sailing. The city {{is equipped with}} good infrastructure for practice of sailing, such as rental and sale of dock space, boat maintenance, restaurants, snack bar, convenience stores, nautical products stores, boat rental agencies, VHF and SSB communication systems, events, and total assistance to crews. The large number of sailing events organized by clubs and syndicates, like oceanic races and typical boats (wooden fishing boats and canoes) races, demonstrates the sport's growing force. Currently, Salvador has a national racing schedule with dozens of events, also receiving the Mini Transat 6.50 and Les Illes du Soleil races.|$|E
25|$|Earth {{environments that}} cannot support life are still {{instructive}} to astrobiologists {{in defining the}} limits of what organisms can endure. The heart of the Atacama desert, generally considered the driest place on Earth, appears unable to support life, {{and it has been}} subject to study by NASA and ESA for that reason: it provides a Mars analog and the moisture gradients along its edges <b>are</b> <b>ideal</b> <b>for</b> studying the boundary between sterility and habitability. The Atacama was the subject of study in 2003 that partly replicated experiments from the Viking landings on Mars in the 1970s; no DNA could be recovered from two soil samples, and incubation experiments were also negative for biosignatures.|$|E

Several plants are nocturnal, such as mushrooms, having a lower sunlight cost, and <b>are</b> <b>ideal</b> <b>for</b> nighttime levels. Certain plants are highly effective against specific types of zombies, such as the Magnet-shroom, which can remove metallic items from a zombie, such as helmets, buckets, ladders, and pogosticks.|$|E

25|$|Overall, the Hunter Valley {{has more}} soils (mostly hard, acidic patches of poorly {{draining}} heavy clay) that are unsuitable for viticulture {{than they have}} areas that <b>are</b> <b>ideal</b> <b>for</b> growing grapes. The soils of the Lower Hunter vary widely from sandy alluvial flats (often planted to Semillon), to deep friable loam (often planted with Shiraz) and friable red duplex soils. In the Upper Hunter, the rivers and creeks of the region contribute to the areas black, silty loam soils that are often overlaid on top of alkaline clay loam. Among the hills of the Brokenback range are strips of volcanic basalt that are prized by growers for their tendencies to restrict vigor and concentrate mineral flavours in the grapes.|$|E
25|$|Migrating {{butterflies}} {{often have}} smaller and lighter body sizes {{that allow them}} to fly longer distances. Additionally, these butterflies tend to have larger wing-to-body ratios. Temperatures and day length have been found to influence development. When larvae were exposed to short days and cool temperatures (20 °C), similar to conditions found in the spring, larval development was accelerated. This produced small adults with low body weights, ideal for migration. A similar phenomenon occurred when the larvae were exposed to longer days at warm temperatures (30 °C), conditions similar to those in the late summer. Seasonal changes could trigger the development of spring and fall body forms that <b>are</b> <b>ideal</b> <b>for</b> the migration patterns described above.|$|E
25|$|PAR {{lights are}} often used in {{theatrical}} or live music shows. Commonly {{they are used to}} generate colours by fitting them with colored sheets called gels. The cans are arranged into rows of different colours and identical rows placed on different sides of the stage. Due to their affordability, they <b>are</b> <b>ideal</b> <b>for</b> colour washes in several different colours. However, {{because of the lack of}} control over the beam diameter, shape and sharpness, PARs are rarely used as front of house lights other than for front washes but can be used for special effect lighting such as lighting from directly above or from extreme angles as well as general wash lights overhead/above stage. If used cleverly, par cans can provide low budget productions with good effects.|$|E
