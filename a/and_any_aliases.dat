Because an object can be modified via <b>any</b> <b>alias,</b> object-oriented programs are hard to understand, maintain, and analyze. Aliasing makes objects depend on their environment in unpredictable ways, breaking the encapsulation necessary for reliable software components, {{making it difficult to}} reason about and optimize programs, obscuring the flow of information between objects, and introducing security problems. Aliasing is a fundamental difficulty, but we accept its presence. Instead we seek techniques for describing, reasoning about, restricting, analyzing, and preventing the connections between objects and/or the flow of information between them. Promising approaches to these problems are based on ownership, confinement, information flow, sharing control, escape analysis, argument independence, read-only references, effects systems, and access control mechanisms. ...|$|R

40|$|Subsampling {{receivers}} utilise the subsampling {{method to}} down convert signals from radio frequency (RF) {{to a lower}} frequency location. Multiple signals can also be down converted using the subsampling receiver, but using the incorrect subsampling frequency could result in signals aliasing one another after down conversion. The existing method for subsampling multiband signals focused on down converting all the signals without <b>any</b> <b>aliasing</b> between the signals. The case considered initially was a dual band signal, {{and then it was}} further extended to a more general multiband case. In this thesis, a new method is proposed with the assumption that only one signal is needed to not overlap the other multiband signals that are down converted at the same time. The proposed method will introduce unique formulas using the said assumption to calculate the valid subsampling frequencies, ensuring that the target signal is not aliased by the other signals. Simulation results show that the proposed method will provide lower valid subsampling frequencies for down conversion compared to the existing methods...|$|R
40|$|This {{software}} {{allows one}} to up-sample or down-sample a measured surface map for model validation, not only without introducing any re-sampling errors, but also eliminating the existing measurement noise and measurement errors. Because the re-sampling of a surface map is accomplished based on the analytical expressions of Zernike-polynomials and a power spectral density model, such re-sampling does not introduce <b>any</b> <b>aliasing</b> <b>and</b> interpolation errors as {{is done by the}} conventional interpolation and FFT-based (fast-Fourier-transform-based) spatial-filtering method. Also, this new method automatically eliminates the measurement noise and other measurement errors such as artificial discontinuity. The developmental cycle of an optical system, such as a space telescope, includes, but is not limited to, the following two steps: (1) deriving requirements or specs on the optical quality of individual optics before they are fabricated through optical modeling and simulations, and (2) validating the optical model using the measured surface height maps after all optics are fabricated. There are a number of computational issues related to model validation, one of which is the "pre-conditioning" or pre-processing of the measured surface maps before using them in a model validation software tool. This software addresses the following issues: (1) up- or down-sampling a measured surface map to match it with the gridded data format of a model validation tool, and (2) eliminating the surface measurement noise or measurement errors such that the resulted surface height map is continuous or smoothly-varying. So far, the preferred method used for re-sampling a surface map is two-dimensional interpolation. The main problem of this method is that the same pixel can take different values when the method of interpolation is changed among the different methods such as the "nearest," "linear," "cubic," and "spline" fitting in Matlab. The conventional, FFT-based spatial filtering method used to eliminate the surface measurement noise or measurement errors can also suffer from aliasing effects. During re-sampling of a surface map, this software preserves the low spatial-frequency characteristic of a given surface map through the use of Zernike-polynomial fit coefficients, and maintains mid- and high-spatial-frequency characteristics of the given surface map by the use of a PSD model derived from the two-dimensional PSD data of the mid- and high-spatial-frequency components of the original surface map. Because this new method creates the new surface map in the desired sampling format from analytical expressions only, it does not encounter <b>any</b> <b>aliasing</b> effects <b>and</b> does not cause any discontinuity in the resultant surface map...|$|R

40|$|Reasoning about {{side effects}} and {{aliasing}} {{is the heart of}} verifying imperative programs. Unrestricted side effects through one reference can invalidate assumptions about an alias. We present a new type system approach to reasoning about safe assumptions in the presence of aliasing and side effects, unifying ideas from reference immutability type systems and rely-guarantee program logics. Our approach, rely-guarantee references, treats multiple references to shared objects similarly to multiple threads in rely-guarantee program logics. We propose statically associating rely and guarantee conditions with individual references to shared objects. Multiple aliases to a given object may coexist only if the guarantee condition of each alias implies the rely condition for all other aliases. We demonstrate that existing reference immutability type systems are special cases of rely-guarantee references. In addition to allowing precise control over state modification, rely-guarantee references allow types to depend on mutable data while still permitting flexible aliasing. Dependent types whose denotation is stable over the actions of the rely and guarantee conditions for a reference and its data will not be invalidated by any action through <b>any</b> <b>alias.</b> We demonstrate this with refinement (subset) types that may depend on mutable data.

40|$|We {{present an}} arbitrary-order {{spectral}} element method for general-purpose simulation of non-overturning water waves, described by fully nonlinear potential theory. The method {{can be viewed}} as a high-order extension of the classical finite element method proposed by Cai et al (1998) CaiEtAl 1998, although the numerical implementation differs greatly. Features of the proposed spectral element method include: nodal Lagrange basis functions, a general quadrature-free approach and gradient recovery using global L^ 2 projections. The quartic nonlinear terms present in the Zakharov form of the free surface conditions can cause severe aliasing problems and consequently numerical instability for marginally resolved or very steep waves. We show how the scheme can be stabilised through a combination of over-integration of the Galerkin projections and a mild spectral filtering on a per element basis. This effectively removes <b>any</b> <b>aliasing</b> driven instabilities while retaining the high-order accuracy of the numerical scheme. The additional computational cost of the over-integration is found insignificant compared to the cost of solving the Laplace problem. The model is applied to several benchmark cases in two dimensions. The results confirm the high order accuracy of the model (exponential convergence), and demonstrate the potential for accuracy and speedup. The results of numerical experiments are in excellent agreement with both analytical and experimental results for strongly nonlinear and irregular dispersive wave propagation.

40|$|Simultaneous {{visualization}} of multiple continuous data attributes {{in a single}} visualization is a task that is important for many application areas. Unsurprisingly, many methods have been proposed to solve this task. However, the behavior of such methods during the exploration stage, when the user tries to understand the data with panning and zooming, has not been given much attention. In this paper, we propose a method that uses procedural texture synthesis to create zoom-independent visualizations of three scalar data attributes. The method is based on random-phase Gabor noise, whose frequency is adapted for the {{visualization of}} the first data attribute. We ensure that the resulting texture frequency lies in the range that is perceived well by the human visual system at any zoom level. To enhance the perception of this attribute, we also apply a specially constructed transfer function {{that is based on}} statistical properties of the noise. Additionally, the transfer function is constructed {{in a way that it}} does not introduce <b>any</b> <b>aliasing</b> to the texture. We map the second attribute to the texture orientation.
