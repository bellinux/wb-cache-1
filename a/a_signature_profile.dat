40|$|The {{stresses}} that animals {{experience as a}} result of modification of their ecological circumstances induce physiological changes that leave <b>a</b> <b>signature</b> in <b>profiles</b> of gene expression. We illustrate this concept in a comparison of free range and confined North American red wolves (Canis rufus). Transcription profiling of peripheral blood samples from 13 red wolf individuals in the Alligator River region of North Carolina revealed a strong signal of differentiation. Four hundred eighty-two out of 2980 transcripts detected on Illumina HumanRef 8 oligonucleotide bead arrays were found to differentiate free range and confined wolves at a false discovery rate of 12. 8 % and P < 0. 05. Over-representation of genes in focal adhesion, insulin signalling, proteasomal, and tryptophan metabolism pathways suggests the activation of pro-inflammatory and stress responses in confined animals. Consequently, characterization of differential transcript abundance in an accessible tissue such as peripheral blood identifies biomarkers that could be useful in animal management practices and for evaluating the impact of habitat changes on population health, particularly as attention turns to the impact of climate change on physiology and in turn species distributions...|$|R

If you are the author or principal advisor of this work and would like to request open access for it, please contact us at open-help@bu. edu. Thank you. This project mainly focuses on DYT 6 dystonia and its causative gene: THAP 1, which encodes a proposed transcription factor, THAP 1, which exhibits sequencespecific and zinc-dependent DNA-binding activity. Over 50 pathogenic mutations have been identified in THAP 1, and various clinical manifestations of DYT 6 have been reported. The target genes of THAP 1 are not fully understood, although some genes involved in cell cycle regulation have been shown to respond transcriptionally to changes in THAP 1 levels. While a connection between THAP 1 and cellular proliferation has been suggested, the exact relationship is still unclear, and there is an on-going interest in finding out more about the normal function(s) of THAP 1 and how these functions are affected by DYT 6 mutations. It can be difficult to interpret results from gene expression profiling to further understand a protein's biochemical activities and its basis for pathogenesis. Therefore this project uniquely inputs DYT 6 gene expressionbased profiling data into the Connectivity Map, <b>a</b> <b>signature</b> <b>profile</b> reference database and software matching system, to identify known compounds that predict similar and opposite biological signatures as patients with DYT 6. The results of this CMAP query show that compounds with strong positive scores, including HDAC inhibitors, HSP 90 inhibitors, and phenothiazines, all are associated in the literature with antiproliferative effects. Compounds with strong negative scores show evidence of promoting cell cycle re-entry as well as neurogenesis, which may be considered {{to be part of a}} reverse signature of decreased proliferation. Hence bioinformatics analysis may provide clues to THAP 1 and its biochemical mechanism of action, specifically in relation to proliferation and the cell cycle...|$|E

To facilitate the understanding of the role of Ca 2 + in biological systems using genomic information, we report herein our improvement on the pattern serach method for the identification of EF-hand and EF-like Ca 2 +-binding proteins. The canonical EF-hand patterns are modified to cater to different flanking structural elements. In addition, based on the conserved sequence of both the N- and C-terminal EF-hands within S 100 and S 100 -like proteins, <b>a</b> new <b>signature</b> <b>profile</b> has been established to allow for the identification of pseudo EF-hand and S 100 proteins from genomic information. The new patterns have a positive predictive value of 99 % and a sensitivity of 96 % for pseudo EF-hands. Furthermore, using the developed patterns, we have identified zero pseudo EF-hand motif and 467 canonical EF-hand Ca 2 + binding motifs with diverse cellular functions in the bacteria genome. The prediction results imply that pseudo EF-hand motifs are phylogenetically younger than canonical EF-hand motifs. Our prediction of Ca 2 + binding motifs in bacterial genomes provides an insight into the role of Ca 2 + and Ca 2 +-binding proteins in bacterial systems. ...|$|R

The present study aimed to test the hypothesis that <b>a</b> <b>signature</b> <b>profile</b> of impaired language functions is found in patients who have sustained damage to the non-thalamic subcortex, either focally induced or resulting from neurodegenerative pathology. The language abilities of a group of patients with Huntington 2 ̆ 7 s disease (n= 13) were compared with those of an age- and education-matched group of patients with chronic NTS lesions following stroke (n= 13) and a non-neurologically impaired control group (n= 13). The three groups were compared on language tasks that assessed both primary and more complex language abilities. The primary language battery consisted of The Western Aphasia Battery and The Boston Naming Test, whilst the more complex cognitive-linguistic battery employed selected subtests from The Test of Language Competence-Expanded, The Test of Word Knowledge and The Word Test-Revised. On many of the tests of primary language function from the Western Aphasia Battery, both the HD and NTS participants performed in a similar manner to the control participants. The language performances of the HD participants were significantly more impaired (p< 0. 05 using modified Bonferroni adjustments) than the control group, however, on various lexico-semantic tasks (e. g. the Boston Naming Test and providing definitions), on both single-word and sentence-level generative tasks (e. g. category fluency and formulating sentences), and on tasks which required interpretation of ambiguous, figurative and inferential meaning. The difficulties that patients with HD experienced with tasks assessing complex language abilities were strikingly similar, both qualitatively and quantitatively, to the language profile produced by NTS participants. The results provide evidence to suggest that a signature language profile is {{associated with}} damage to the non-thalamic subcortex resulting from either focal neurological insult or a degenerative disease...|$|E
40|$|Background: Dementia due to {{potentially}} reversible etiologies {{is an important}} group of dementias to be identified {{not only because of}} the number of such Patients encountered but also due to the potential for substantial improvement with treatment. Aims : To prospectively investigate the frequency and causes of dementias with potentially reversible etiologies; to examine the clinical features of this subgroup with a view to identifying <b>a</b> <b>signature</b> <b>profile</b> and to determine if this potential reversibility translates into actual reversibility with appropriate treatment. Setting and design : A prospective longitudinal study of patients with dementia presenting to the outpatient services of a tertiary referral hospital. Methods : All Patients above 40 years referred for evaluation of cognitive complaints were serially enrolled and underwent clinical examination, various laboratory tests and neuroimaging. Patients were followed-up for one year. Statistical analysis : One way analysis of variance for continuous variables followed by post hoc comparisons using Scheffe&#x 2032;s procedure. Results: A total of 129 patients met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders edition 4 (DSM IV) criteria for dementia and qualified for inclusion into the study. Twenty-four patients (18 &#x 0025;), all with moderately severe cognitive [mean mini mental state examination (MMSE) score &#x 00 B 1; SD = 17. 9 &#x 00 B 1; 4. 8] and neuropsychiatric [mean neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI) score &#x 00 B 1; SD = 30. 7 &#x 00 B 1; 8. 7] dysfunction were diagnosed to have reversible causes - neuroinfections in 11 patients, normal pressure hydrocephalus in 8 patients and vitamin B 12 deficiency in 5 patients. The majority of these patients had gait and urinary dysfunction reminiscent of subcortical dementias. These reversible causes were clinically suspected in only 58 &#x 0025; of patients. In 20 / 24 patients in whom follow up was possible mean MMSE score had improved to 22. 2 and mean NPI score had improved to 8. 0, following 6 months of treatment. Conclusions : Reversible causes, especially neuroinfections and vitamin B 12 deficiency accounted for 18 &#x 0025; all dementias in this study. The majority of these conditions was not clinically suspected though resulting in moderate to severe cognitive and psychiatric dysfunction.

Among the differentially expressed transcription factors, runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX 1) transcript levels were up-regulated in FCRL 4 − cells, whereas RUNX 2 transcripts were preferentially detected in FCRL 4 + cells.

We have explored the transcriptional response of the epithelium globally by applying a whole-genome approach to a murine model of infection. METHODS: The 3 major epithelial lineages of the stomach-the parietal, mucus-producing, and chief cells-were harvested from cryosections of infected and uninfected murine stomachs by laser microdissection and subjected to gene expression profiling. The localization and quantity of selected transcripts were verified by in situ hybridization and quantitative real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Each cell type is characterized by <b>a</b> transcriptional <b>signature</b> <b>profile.</b> The parietal cell profile is highly enriched for factors involved in mitochondrial energy generation, whereas the chief cell predominantly expresses digestive enzymes and glycosylation-associated proteins. In contrast, the mucus cell signature is distinguished by an abundance of cell-surface receptors, signaling molecules, and factors involved in antigen presentation. All of these indicate a role in sampling, sensing, and responding to environmental stimuli. In line with this biological function, we measured a strong transcriptional response to Helicobacter pylori infection only in this cell type. The genes that are differentially expressed upon infection are implicated in a proinflammatory and mucosal defense response as well as modulation of angiogenesis, iron availability, and tumor suppression. CONCLUSIONS: Laser microdissection-assisted transcriptional profiling is a useful tool to explore the biology of specific cell populations and is sensitive enough to measure the transcriptional response to bacterial infection in vivo...|$|R

A typical multi-rotor unmanned aircraft system, with a weight of approximately 2. 1 kg, {{was used for}} sound pressure level measurements. This study established a relationship between distance, altitude and sound pressure level, finding that the sound decays approximately in line with 6 dB(A) reduction for a doubling of distance. The effect of {{the orientation of the}} multi-rotor unmanned aircraft system was also investigated. It was determined that the sound profile does not vary significantly around the periphery of the multi-rotor unmanned aircraft system in the propeller-plane. However, when measured with the observer underneath the multi-rotor unmanned aircraft system, the sound pressure level was found to vary by as much as 10 dB(A), with the greatest sound pressure level at approximately 45 ° from horizontal. Finally, an acoustic array was used to measure key frequencies for the main sound sources: motors and propellers. It was found that extraneous noise from the multi-rotor unmanned aircraft system frame vibration and mounting methods was also common. Despite relatively low levels of sound being measured (especially when compared with conventional aircraft and rotorcraft), the increasing numbers of unmanned aircraft systems in urban environments, close to humans and dwellings, suggests that increasing complaints are likely. Thus, further research was suggested, including expanding the range of multi-rotor unmanned aircraft system to be tested, introducing DGPS, improving the mounting for indoor testing, and psychoacoustic analysis of the sound...|$|R

Hence, null mutants of myosin II (myo 1 Δ) and chitin synthase II (chs 2 Δ) share multiple morphological and molecular phenotypes. To {{understand the nature}} of their interdependent functions, we will seek to identify genes undergoing transcriptional regulation in chs 2 Δ strains and to establish <b>a</b> transcription <b>signature</b> <b>profile</b> for comparison with myo 1 Δ strains. Results A total of 467 genes were commonly regulated between myo 1 Δ and chs 2 Δ mutant strains (p ≤ 0. 01). Common regulated biological process categories identified by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) in both gene expression profiles were: protein biosynthesis, RNA processing, and stress response. Expression of 17 / 20 genes in the main transcriptional fingerprint for cell wall stress was confirmed in the chs 2 Δ strain versus 5 / 20 for the myo 1 Δ strain. One of these genes, SLT 2 /MPK 1, was up-regulated in both strains and both strains accumulated the hyperphosphorylated form of Slt 2 p thereby confirming that the PKC 1 cell wall integrity pathway (CWIP) was activated by both mutations. The SLT 2 /MPK 1 gene, essential for myo 1 Δ strains, was not required in the chs 2 Δ strain. Conclusion Comparison of the chs 2 Δ and myo 1 Δ gene expression profiles revealed similarities in the biological process categories that respond to the chs 2 Δ and myo 1 Δ gene mutations. This supports the view that these mutations affect a common function in cytokinesis. Despite their similarities, these mutants exhibited significant differences in expression of the main transcriptional fingerprint for cell wall stress and their requirement of the CWIP for survival. </p...|$|R

DESIGN: Immunogenicity substudy of a randomized phase II prophylactic HIV vaccine trial (ANRS VAC 18). METHODS: HIV-LIPO- 5 or placebo was administered at W 0, W 4, W 12 and W 24. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a subset of participants at W 0 and W 14 were stimulated with HIV-LIPO- 5, Gag peptides contained in the vaccine and control peptides. ELISpot, lymphoproliferation, intracellular cytokine staining (ICS), cytokine multiplex and transcriptomic analyses were performed. Different time points and stimulation conditions were compared, controlling for test multiplicity. RESULTS: Cultured ELISpot and lymphoproliferation responses were detected at W 14. Ex-vivo ICS showed mainly interleukin (IL) - 2 -producing cells. Secretion of interferon (IFN) -γ, tumour necrosis factor (TNF) -α, IL- 5 and IL- 13 increased significantly after culture and Gag stimulation at W 14 compared to W 0. Metallothionein genes were consistently overexpressed after HIV-LIPO- 5 stimulation at W 0 and W 14. At W 14, significant probes increased substantially, including IFN-γ, CXCL 9, IL 2 RA, TNFAIP 6, CCL 3 L 1 and IL- 6. Canonical pathway analyses indicated a role of interferon signalling genes in response to HIV-LIPO- 5. CONCLUSION: HIV-LIPO- 5 vaccination elicited Th 1 and Th 2 memory precursor responses and a consistent modulation in gene expression. The response profile before vaccination suggests an adjuvant effect of the lipid tail of HIV-LIPO- 5. Our combined immunogenicity analyses allowed to identify <b>a</b> specific <b>signature</b> <b>profile</b> of HIV-LIPO- 5 and indicate that HIV-LIPO- 5 could be further developed as a prime in heterologous prime-boost strategies...|$|R

40|$|Primary cilia are {{specialised}} sensory {{and developmental}} signalling devices {{extending from the}} surface of most eukaryotic cells. Defects in these organelles cause inherited human disorders (ciliopathies) such as retinitis pigmentosa and Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), frequently affecting many physiological and developmental processes across multiple organs. Cilium formation, maintenance and function depend on intracellular transport systems such as intraflagellar transport (IFT), which is driven by kinesin- 2 and IFT-dynein motors and regulated by the Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) cargo-adaptor protein complex, or BBSome. To identify new cilium-associated genes, we employed the nematode C. elegans, where ciliogenesis occurs within a short timespan during late embryogenesis when most sensory neurons differentiate. Using whole-organism RNA-Seq libraries, we discovered <b>a</b> <b>signature</b> expression <b>profile</b> highly enriched for transcripts of known ciliary proteins, including FAM- 161 (FAM 161 A orthologue), CCDC- 104 (CCDC 104), and RPI- 1 (RP 1 /RP 1 L 1), which we confirm are cilium-localised in worms. From a list of 185 candidate ciliary genes, we uncover orthologues of human MAP 9, YAP, CCDC 149, and RAB 28 as conserved cilium-associated components. Further analyses of C. elegans RAB- 28, recently associated with autosomal-recessive cone-rod dystrophy, reveal that this small GTPase is exclusively expressed in ciliated neurons where it dynamically associates with IFT trains. Whereas inactive GDP-bound RAB- 28 displays no IFT movement and diffuse localisation, GTP-bound (activated) RAB- 28 concentrates at the periciliary membrane in a BBSome-dependent manner and undergoes bidirectional IFT. Functional analyses reveal that whilst cilium structure, sensory function and IFT are seemingly normal in a rab- 28 null allele, overexpression of predicted GDP or GTP locked variants of RAB- 28 perturbs cilium and sensory pore morphogenesis and function. Collectively, our findings present a new approach for identifying ciliary proteins, and unveil RAB 28, a GTPase most closely related to the BBS protein RABL 4 /IFT 27, as an IFT-associated cargo with BBSome-dependent cell autonomous and non-autonomous functions at the ciliary base...|$|R

SPME–GC and activated charcoal strip (ACS) –SPME–GC <b>signature</b> <b>profile</b> methods are developed for the detection and quantitation of cocaine-odor chemicals, including the optimization of controllable variables such as fiber chemistry, extraction time, and desorption time. The volatile odor chemicals in representative illicit cocaine samples are identified and quantitated by the ACS–SPME–GC <b>signature</b> <b>profile</b> method and direct injection. Field tests with drug detector dogs show methyl benzoate to be the dominant signature odor chemical along with cocaine on U. S. currency at a threshold level of approximately 1 – 10 µg when spiked or when 10 ng/s methyl benzoate is diffused from polymer bottles, which is required in order to initiate an alert. No other substance studied initiated consistent responses by the drug dogs. The results indicate that the microgram levels of cocaine that have been reported on circulated U. S. currency are insufficient to signal an alert from law-enforcement trained drug detector dogs...|$|R

50|$|Chalone Vineyard {{is located}} in the Chalone AVA south of San Francisco, California, United States, on an unusual {{geological}} formation called the Gavilan benchland. The soil is rich in limestone and calcium carbonate and also contains a significant amount of decomposed granite. Chalone is situated in an arid chaparral environment, in which temperatures can vary as much as 50°F in one day. The climate is very dry, only 12 to 14 in of rain fall per year. These factors combine to create a unique terroir, the <b>signature</b> <b>profile</b> of <b>a</b> wine growing region.|$|R
