25|$|As no {{intravenous}} fluids used for initial resuscitation {{have been shown}} to be superior, warmed Lactated Ringer's solution continues to be the solution of choice. If blood products are needed, a greater use of fresh frozen plasma and platelets relative to packed red blood cells has been found to improve survival and lower overall blood product use; a ratio of 1:1:1 is recommended. The success of platelets has been attributed to the fact that they may prevent coagulopathy from developing. Cell salvage and <b>autotransfusion</b> also may be used.|$|E
2500|$|The {{amount of}} blood drawn and the methods vary. The {{collection}} can be done manually or with automated equipment that takes only specific components of the blood. [...] Most {{of the components of}} blood used for transfusions have a short shelf life, and maintaining a constant supply is a persistent problem. This has led to some increased interest in <b>autotransfusion,</b> whereby a patient's blood is salvaged during surgery for continuous reinfusion—or alternatively, is [...] "self-donated" [...] prior to when it will be needed. (Generally, the notion of [...] "donation" [...] does not refer to giving to one's self, though in this context it has become somewhat acceptably idiomatic.) ...|$|E
40|$|Autologous blood {{transfusion}} {{is one of}} the most effective ways of avoiding the need for homologous transfusion and all its associated complications. Since the beginning of 1985, <b>autotransfusions</b> have been used in 48 patients undergoing total joint replacement, without significant complications. Their average haemoglobin level two weeks postoperatively was 11. 3 mg/dl. We believe that this is a safe, effective and economical procedure which benefits both patients and medical staff, and its use should be more widespread...|$|R
40|$|Autologous {{blood was}} pre-deposited for 11 {{children}} who were marrow donors for siblings undergoing bone marrow transplantation for haematological and oncological conditions. Their age ranged from 2 to 15 years (mean 8. 4 years) and their body weight from 12. 5 to 47 kg (mean 27. 1 kg). Ten donors had single collection and one had two. The collection period varied between 7 to 21 days before marrow harvest. Volume of autologous blood harvested ranged from 100 ml to 450 ml {{with a total of}} 6. 52 ml/kg to 14. 5 ml/kg body weight (mean 9. 49 ml/kg). Nine donors received <b>autotransfusions</b> during or after marrow harvest. No adverse reaction was observed. Two donors were not transfused. Only one donor required additional allogeneic blood transfusion. Our autologous transfusion policy minimized the risk of allogeneic blood exposure for marrow donor.

40|$|Key words: medical ozone, {{erythrocyte}} membrane fluidity, electron paramagnetic resonance, spin labelling The {{effects of}} ozone at different concentrations (10, 30, 45 g/m 3) on fluidity and thermotropic properties of erythrocyte membranes were investigated by EPR using two spin probes: 5 -doxylstearic acid (5 -DSA) and 16 -doxylstearic acid (16 -DSA). The effect of ozone on the erythrocyte membrane fluidity was a dose-dependent process. The ozone at concentration of 10 g/m 3 caused rigidization of the membrane while at concentration of 45 g/m 3 increased fluidity {{both on the}} surface and in the deeper hydrocarbon region of the membrane. Temperature transitions close to the polar heads region (monitored by 5 -DSA) were not sensitive to an increase in ozone concentration. In the case of 16 -DSA, low temperature thermotropic transition (around 20 �C) gradually decreased with the increase of ozone concentration. High temperature transition (around 40 �C) significantly differed at the ozone concentration of 10 g/m 3 and 45 g/m 3, being higher and lower, respectively, as compared to untreated cells. For the ozone concentration of 45 g/m 3 the disappearance of the low temperature break and the appearance of two breaks at 37 �C and 16 �C were observed. <b>Autotransfusions</b> of ozonized blood or infusions of gaseous ozone into blood vessels and body cavities are believed to exert therapeutic effects in some pathological states (Shiratori et al., 1993; Washuttl, 1988; Burgard, 1990). In medical applications an oxygen/ozone mixture (the so called medical ozone) is used at concentrations ranging from 1 to 40 �g ozone per 1 ml of oxygen.

50|$|Postoperative <b>autotransfusion</b> is {{performed}} by connecting the double lumen <b>autotransfusion</b> suction line {{directly to the}} drain line placed {{at the conclusion of}} surgery. Postoperative <b>autotransfusion</b> begins in the operating room when the drain line is placed and the surgical site is closed. Typical postoperative cases are total knee and hip replacements. <b>Autotransfusion</b> is continued and is effective while the patient actively bleeds during the immediate postoperative phase of recovery. <b>Autotransfusion</b> is ended when bleeding is stopped or is significantly slow, and is discontinued by connecting an ordinary self draining device to the drain line(s). Available for postoperative <b>autotransfusion</b> are universal bifurcated connectors which can accommodate two drain lines of any size, these connectors can be attached to the standard ten foot double lumen suction line for postoperative use.|$|E
5000|$|The {{interest}} in <b>autotransfusion</b> dwindled during World War II, {{when there was}} a large pool of donors. After the war, blood testing, typing, and crossmatching techniques were improved making blood banks the answer to the increased demand for blood. In the 1960s, {{interest in}} <b>autotransfusion</b> revived. With the advances in all fields of surgery, new companies developed <b>autotransfusion</b> devices. Problems still arose, however, with air embolism, coagulopathy, and hemolysis. [...] The devices used during the Korean and Vietnam War collected and provided gross filtration of blood before it was reinfused. With the introduction of cardiopulmonary bypass in 1952, <b>autotransfusion</b> became an area of study. Klebanoff began a new era of <b>autotransfusion</b> by developing the first commercially available <b>autotransfusion</b> unit in 1968. His system, the Bentley <b>Autotransfusion</b> System aspirated, collected, filtered and reinfused autologous whole blood shed from the operative field. The problems with the Bentley system included the requirement of systemic anticoagulation of the patient, introduction of air embolism, and renal failure resulting from unfiltered particulate in the reinfused blood.|$|E
50|$|When Avitene, Hemopad, Instat, or {{collagen}} type {{products are}} used, <b>autotransfusion</b> should be interrupted and a waste or wall suction source must be used. <b>Autotransfusion</b> can be resumed once {{these products are}} flushed from the surgical site. If Gelfoam, Surgicel, Thrombogen or Thrombostat are used, <b>autotransfusion</b> can continue, however direct suctioning of these products should be avoided.|$|E
40|$|Sixty {{consecutive}} patients undergoing elective open-heart surgery were prospectively {{enrolled in}} a study to compare the efficacy of 3 different antifibrinolytic drugs to reduce postoperative bleeding and to reduce homologous blood requirements in combination with blood-saving techniques and restrictive indications for blood transfusion. The patients were randomized to 1 of 4 intraoperative treatment regimens: 1) control (no antifibrinolytic therapy); 2) epsilon-aminocaproic acid (10 g IV at induction of anesthesia, followed by infusion of 2 g/h for 5 hours); 3) tranexamic acid (10 mg/kg IV within 30 minutes after induction of anesthesia, followed by infusion of 1 mg/kg per hour for 10 hours); or 4) high-dose aprotinin (2 million KIU IV at induction of anesthesia and 2 million KIU added to the extracorporeal circuit, followed by infusion of 500 thousand KIU/h during surgery). Hemoconcentration and reinfusion of blood drained from the operative field and the extracorporeal circuit after operation were used in all patients. Indications for blood transfusion were hypotension, tachycardia, or both, with hemoglobin values < 8. 5 g/dL; or severe anemia with hemoglobin values < 7 g/dL. Compared with the blood loss in the control group, patients receiving aprotinin and epsilon-aminocaproic acid showed significantly less postoperative blood loss at 1 hour (control, 128 +/- 94 mL; aprotinin, 54 +/- 47 mL, p = 0. 01; and epsilon-aminocaproic acid, 69 +/- 35 mL, p = 0. 03); this trend continued at 24 hours after operation (control, 724 +/- 280 mL; aprotinin, 344 +/- 106 mL, p < 0. 0001; and epsilon-aminocaproic acid, 509 +/- 148 mL, p = 0. 01). Aprotinin was significantly more efficient than epsilon-aminocaproic acid (p= 0. 002). Tranexamic acid {{did not have a}} statistically significant effect on blood loss. Homologous blood requirements were not significantly different among the groups; postoperative hematologic values and coagulation times were also comparable. Despite the efficacy of aprotinin and epsilon-aminocaproic acid shown in the present study, the blood requirements were not significantly different from those that are found when transfusions are restricted, <b>autotransfusions</b> are used, and blood from the operative field and extracorporeal circuit is concentrated and reinfused. Therefore, intraoperative antifibrinolysis may not be indicated in routine cardiac surgery when other blood-saving techniques are adopted...|$|R
50|$|Cement {{is often}} used or {{encountered}} during primary or revision total joint replacement surgery. Cement in the liquid or soft state should not be introduced into the <b>autotransfusion</b> system. When cement is being applied a waste or wall suction source must be used, however when the cement hardens <b>autotransfusion</b> may be resumed. The use of ultrasonic equipment during revision of total joints changes the cement to a liquid or soft state, which precludes the use of <b>autotransfusion</b> during {{the use of such}} equipment. <b>Autotransfusion</b> can only continue when the cement has hardened.|$|E
50|$|<b>Autotransfusion</b> is {{intended}} for use in situations characterized {{by the loss of}} one or more units of blood and may be particularly advantageous for use in cases involving rare blood groups, risk of infectious disease transmission, restricted homologous blood supply or other medical situations for which the use of homologous blood is contraindicated. <b>Autotransfusion</b> is commonly used intraoperatively and postoperatively. Intraoperative <b>autotransfusion</b> refers to recovery of blood lost during surgery or the concentration of fluid in an extracorporeal circuit. Postoperative <b>autotransfusion</b> refers to the recovery of blood in the extracorporeal circuit at the end of surgery or from aspirated drainage.|$|E
50|$|Antibiotics {{which are}} plasma bound {{can be removed}} during the <b>autotransfusion</b> wash cycle, however topical {{antibiotics}} which are typically not plasma bound may not be washed out during <b>autotransfusion,</b> and may actually become concentrated {{to the point of}} being nephrotoxic.|$|E
5000|$|During the American Civil War Union Army {{physicians}} {{are said to}} have administered four transfusions. In 1886, J. Duncan used <b>autotransfusion</b> during the amputation of limbs by removing blood from the amputated limb and returning it to the patient by femoral injection. This method was apparently fairly successful. A German, M. J. Theis, reported the first successful use of intraoperative <b>autotransfusion</b> in 1914, with a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. [...] The earliest report in the American literature on the use of <b>autotransfusion</b> was by Lockwood in 1917 who used the technique during a splenectomy for Banti syndrome. Interest in the unrefined technique of <b>autotransfusion</b> continued through to the early 1940s, and was applied to various procedures including treatment of ectopic pregnancy, hemothorax, ruptured spleen, perforating abdominal injuries, and neurosurgical procedures.|$|E

50|$|In some {{institutions}} {{to maximize the}} effectiveness of <b>autotransfusion</b> and provide the best conservation and return of red cells the soaking of sponges is employed. During the surgical procedure the blood soaked sponges are collected {{and placed in a}} sterile basin by the surgical team, sterile heparinized saline is added to the basin to prevent clotting and facilitate the release of red cells. The sponges are periodically wrung out and removed from the basin, the remaining solution can be suctioned into the <b>autotransfusion</b> reservoir so that the red cells can be recovered. The usual ratio of heparinized saline is 5,000 units of heparin per 1,000 ml of 0.9% sodium chloride. The heparin is removed during the <b>autotransfusion</b> process.|$|E
50|$|The {{disadvantage}} of <b>autotransfusion</b> is {{the depletion of}} plasma and platelets. The washed <b>autotransfusion</b> system removes the plasma and platelets to eliminate activated clotting factors and activated platelets which would cause coagulopathy if they were reinfused to the patient, generating a packed red blood cell (PRBC) product. This disadvantage is only evident when very large blood losses occur. The autotransfusionist monitors blood loss and will recommend the transfusion of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and platelets when the blood loss and return of <b>autotransfusion</b> blood increase. Typically the patient will require FFP and platelets as the estimated blood loss exceeds half of the patient's blood volume. When possible diagnostic tests should be performed to determine the need for any blood products (i.e. PRBC, FFP and platelets).|$|E
50|$|Individuals of the Jehovah's Witness {{religion}} in particular {{refuse to accept}} homologous and autologous pre-donated blood.

50|$|<b>Autotransfusion</b> is not {{normally}} used in Caesarean sections, because {{the possibility of}} an amniotic fluid embolism exists. Emerging literature suggests that amniotic fluid is being cleared during the wash cycle. It is possible that the utilization of <b>autotransfusion</b> in obstetrics may increase as more research is completed. However, if a patient is at risk for blood loss and is a Jehovah's witness, for example, the cell saver can be used with strict guidelines of irrigating profusely to remove amniotic fluid and then suctioning the blood that is being lost.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Autotransfusion</b> is {{a process}} wherein a person {{receives}} their own blood for a transfusion, instead of banked allogenic (separate-donor) blood. There are two main kinds of autotransfusion: Blood can be autologously [...] "pre-donated" [...] (termed so despite [...] "donation" [...] not typically referring to giving to one's self) before a surgery, or alternatively, it can be collected {{during and after the}} surgery using an intraoperative blood salvage device (such as a Cell Saver or CATS). The latter form of <b>autotransfusion</b> is utilized in surgeries where there is expected a large volume blood loss - e.g. aneurysm, total joint replacement, and spinal surgeries.|$|E
