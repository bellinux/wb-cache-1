30|$|The {{simulation}} results in Figure 3 are obtained by illuminating a plane wave on a CSHA with {{a period of}} 350 nm, length of 300 nm, width of 20 nm, and thickness of 100 nm in a gold film. In these cross-shaped-holes, the open area of the cross-shaped hole is about 2 × 300 × 20 nm 2, which is about 1 / 10 of the area of a unit cell, which is 350 × 350 nm 2. The transmission efficiency is about 70 % at the center wavelength of 1.25 μm for this CSHA. A range of parameters for the cross-shaped hole (include the length, width, {{and both of them}} of the rectangle of the holes) are investigated, the results show that a very similar transmission peak can be obtained by varying these parameters of the CSHAs, though the wavelength center, the band width, and even the magnitude of the transmission peak varies <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> for the <b>different</b> parameters. These results are consistent with the results that we obtained in the rectangle-hole arrays: the transmission resonance wavelength shifts toward red, {{at the same time the}} transmission peak narrows down with same magnitude as the width of the hole decreases; therefore, the width of the rectangular hole is more important on prediction of the transmission peak location; Meanwhile, the length of the rectangular hole plays a more important role on the transmission efficiency and bandwidth. The periodicity of the array as another important parameter is also investigated, the transmission peaks are red shifted from their periodicity, and this result is similar as the transmission peaks' behavior of the rectangle-hole arrays, in other words, for a larger periodicity, a longer wavelength of the transmission peak is observed. Therefore, periodicity of the array and the width of the rectangular hole are two factors in predicting the transmission peak's location.|$|R
40|$|As teachers, we are {{challenged}} everyday to solve pedagogical problems {{and we have}} to fight for our students’ attention in a media rich world. I will talk about how we use ICT in Initial Teacher Training and give you some insight on what we are doing. The most important benefit of using ICT in education is that it makes us reflect on our practice. There is no doubt that our classrooms need to be updated, but we need to be critical about every peace of hardware, software or service that we bring into them. It is not only because our budgets are short, but also because e‐learning is primarily about learning, not technology. Therefore, we need to have the knowledge and skills required to act in different situations, and choose the best tool for the job. Not all subjects are suitable for e‐learning, nor do all students have the skills to organize themselves their own study times. Also not all teachers want to spend time programming or learning about instructional design and metadata. The promised land of easy use of authoring tools (e. g. eXe and Reload) that will lead to all teachers become Learning Objects authors and share these LO in Repositories, all this failed, like previously HyperCard, Toolbook and others. We need to know <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of many <b>different</b> technologies so we can mobilize this knowledge when a situation requires it: integrate e‐learning technologies in the classroom, not a flipped classroom, just simple tools. Lecture capture, mobile phones and smartphones, pocket size camcorders, VoIP, VLE, live video broadcast, screen sharing, free services for collaborative work, save, share and sync your files. Do not feel stressed to use everything, every time. Just because we have a whiteboard does not mean we have to make it the centre of the classroom. Start from where you are, with your preferred subject and the tools you master. Them go slowly and try some new tool in a non‐formal situation and with just one or two students. And you don’t need to be alone: subscribe a mailing list and share your thoughts with other teachers in a dedicated forum, even better if both are part of a community of practice, and share resources. We did that for music teachers and it was a success, in two years arriving at 1. 000 members. Just do it...|$|R

She continued to resist until the case against Paulus was heard in February 1975. At the trial, McKittrick testified that Robinson had paid Paulus $25,000 {{to find someone to}} eliminate Hill, and that in turn, Paulus had paid Vandiver $5,000 to carry out the murder. McKittrick and Robinson both passed polygraph tests. The results indicated that McKittrick was being truthful when she stated that Robinson had caused John Hill's death and that Robinson was telling the truth when he said {{he had nothing to do}} with Hill's murder. Bennett also produced evidence that Ash Robinson had taken out a private telephone number, which had been found written on a scrap of paper in Paulus's handbag. DeGuerin then sought to portray McKittrick as a liar by calling Paulus to the witness stand, a strategy that was almost successful until Paulus deviated from the agreed testimony. She had sought to portray herself as a respectable widow who had taken pity on McKittrick.

2500|$|In 2009, Norwood {{introduced}} her rap alter ego Bran'Nu on Timbaland's album Shock Value II (2009), {{the result of}} artistic experimentation with the musician, who had tapped her for her rhyming ability after seeing a video on YouTube that Norwood had uploaded and showed her rapping freestyle. Norwood, who had initially thought of rapping as a hobby and fun for friends, felt encouraged by Timbaland to write and perform her own verses on at least three tracks for his album, two of which eventually {{made it to the}} track lisiting. In December 2009, the producer revealed his intentions to reteam with her on her next project, producing the bulk of an album that he envisioned to be “half singing, half rapping”.
