40|$|Objective. Total {{antioxidant}} {{capacity in}} serum {{is determined by}} the total mass of <b>antioxidant</b> <b>substances</b> and the antioxidant capacity per unit mass (average activity). The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop a method to determine the mass of <b>antioxidant</b> <b>substances</b> and average activity in human serum. Methods. Specimens of serum were collected from 100 subjects each from two different age groups: over 75 years old and 20 – 40 years old. The test serum was diluted into a series of concentrations, following which standard oxidation agents (KMnO 4 for potassium permanganate method and I 2 for iodimetry) were added to each concentration of serum, and the absorbance of the mixture (optical density, OD) was measured. The OD value and logarithm of dilution factor (lgT) at the end of the titration were obtained, from which the lgT could be considered as mass of <b>antioxidant</b> <b>substances</b> (M). Total antioxidant capacity (Ta) was calculated with the equation Ta = 100 /(OD 1 + 2 * OD 2 + 2 * OD 3 + 2 * OD 4 + OD 5), and average activity (A) was calculated as A = Ta/M. Results. The potassium permanganate method generated similar results to the iodimetric method. Compared with the younger group, total antioxidant capacity in the over- 75 -year age group was found to be significantly reduced, along with a decrease in the mass of <b>antioxidant</b> <b>substances</b> and average activity levels in human serum.

Post-translational modifications, namely the fragmentation of albumin found with proteomic techniques in nephrotic patients, diabetics, and ESRD patients will be presented and discussed. It is reasonable to hypothesize that proteolytic fragmentation of serum albumin is due to a higher susceptibility to proteases, induced by oxidative stress. The clinical relevance of the fragmentation of albumin has not yet been established. These modifications could affect some physiological functions of albumin and have a patho-physiological role in uremic syndrome. Proteomic analysis of serum allows the identification of over-expressed proteins and can detect post-translational modifications of serum proteins, hitherto hidden, using standard laboratory techniques...|$|R
