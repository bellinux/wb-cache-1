5|$|The {{need for}} the second crewman was an obvious problem with the Mk. XII, {{especially}} as few bombers of the era had enough room for the operator. Working with Henry Braddick, Blackett developed {{a new version of}} the calculator that included <b>aircraft</b> <b>instruments</b> inside the computor, eliminating the {{need for the}} needle-on-needle matching and completely automating the calculations. After the initial design was complete, Blackett moved onto other matters with RAF Coastal Command, where he continued development of his theories of operational research.|$|E
5|$|In {{the post-war}} era, the UK {{produced}} derivatives {{of the design}} based on the T-1, {{as opposed to the}} original Mk. XIV. These T-2 and T-4 (Blue Devil) designs had much higher altitude, airspeed and wind-speed settings, suitable for high-altitude bombing in the jet stream. These were normally part of the Navigation and Bombing System, which combined inputs from <b>aircraft</b> <b>instruments,</b> H2S and Green Satin radars, star fixes and radio navigation systems, in a mechanical computer that directly output the latitude and longitude of the aircraft, based on automatic dead reckoning. The same outputs were also sent to the sighting head of the T-4, eliminating the need to manually set the windage and providing those values with much higher accuracy (about ±0.1mph and ±0.1 degrees).|$|E
5|$|The {{advance to}} the Blackett design {{was the way the}} {{sighting}} head was aimed. Instead of dialling the parameters into the sight directly as in the CSBS, these inputs were dialled into a separate console. The console was equipped with repeaters for each of the <b>aircraft</b> <b>instruments</b> needed to operate the sight, like altitude and airspeed. The operator simply turned the dials on the console so their indicator arrows matched the readings on the instruments displayed in the same location, known as laying needle on needle. This eliminated the possibility that the numbers would not be changed as the bomber manoeuvred, but required so much manual working that a new crew member was introduced to operate the console, the bomb-aimer's mate.|$|E

5|$|British aero engines were {{normally}} {{equipped with}} a power take-off shaft {{that led to the}} rear of the engine. In twin engine aircraft like the Anson, one of these would be used for a generator that powered the <b>aircraft</b> <b>instruments</b> at 24V DC, the other would be left unconnected and available for use. Following a suggestion from Watt to avoid Air Ministry channels, in October Bowen flew one of the Battles to the Metropolitan-Vickers (Metrovick) plant in Sheffield, where he pulled the DC generator off the engine, dropped it on the table, and asked for an AC alternator of similar size and shape. Arnold Tustin, Metrovick's lead engineer, was called in to consider the problem, and after a few minutes he returned to say that he could supply an 80V unit at 1200 to 2400Hz and 800W, even better than the 500W requested. Bowen had an order for 18 pre-production units placed as soon as possible, and the first units started arriving at the end of October. A second order for 400 more quickly followed. Eventually about 133,800 of these alternators would be produced during the war.|$|E
25|$|The actual speeds {{represented}} by these designators {{are specific to}} a particular model of aircraft.

500|$|Throughout the war, the Allies {{had made}} use {{of a number of}} {{different}} varieties of amphibious vehicle. One of the more commonly used was the Ford GPA, {{a modified version of the}} Ford GPW Jeep (also known as a [...] "Seep"). In India towards the end of the war, Carlin had noticed a GPA in an army vehicle lot. To the mockery of his fellow engineers, he suggested that the vehicle could be used to take him around the world, supposedly remarking: [...] "with a bit of titivation, you could go around the world in one of those things". This idea remained with Carlin after his marriage, and he proposed to his wife that the couple honeymoon by crossing the Atlantic Ocean in a modified GPA. After a considerable amount of trouble, the Carlins finally managed to purchase a 1942 Ford GPA (serial number 1239) from a government auction in Washington, D.C., for US$901. The vehicle had originally been manufactured at Ford's plant in River Rouge, Michigan, one of 12,778 built during the war. He originally tried to convince Ford to sponsor his proposed trip, but the company refused, believing the craft would not make the journey. The vehicle required a number of modifications to make it seaworthy, including the addition of a more boat-like bow, a rudder, a larger cabin, and two extra fuel tanks – one at the bow and one under the [...] "belly" [...] of the craft, at the stern. Inside the cabin, a bunk was installed, and the dash was modified to include <b>aircraft</b> <b>instruments,</b> as well as a two-way radio (including a 19-set transmitter and receiver). In total, the vessel's length was extended by three feet to , and the fuel capacity to 200 gallons (760 L) from the original 12 gallons (45 L). The construction of the under-belly fuel tank allowed it to be jettisoned when empty, reducing further its full weight of three tons (6,720lb or 3,048kg). The vessel was christened Half-Safe, after the slogan of Arrid, a deodorant brand – [...] "Don't be half-safe – use Arrid to be sure".|$|E

[...] It also considered the Department should have made more checks of the operator's methods and record keeping. [...] The Minister declined {{to take action against}} the operator, saying its maintenance record keeping had improved significantly since the accident. [...] He also cited the hardship that would be inflicted on many remote communities in Western Australia if the operator's airline licence were to be suspended or cancelled.

2500|$|A three-part pilot {{training}} program was implemented beginning with {{two months of}} ground school, followed by preliminary flight training teaching student pilots to fly solo, and advanced flight training to qualification as a naval aviator with a commission in the Naval Reserve Flying Corps. The first ground school for pilot training was at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The first class of fifty student pilots arrived on 23 July 1917 for an eight-week program covering electricity, signals, photography, seamanship, navigation, gunnery, aeronautic engines, theory of flight, and <b>aircraft</b> <b>instruments.</b> Later classes received an initial period of indoctrination and preliminary training aboard a receiving ship before assignment to ground school. Those who successfully completed ground school were transferred to naval air stations for flight training. In July 1918 parallel ground school programs began at the University of Washington in Seattle and at Dunwoody Institute in Minneapolis; but few graduates of these schools could be counted among the 18,000 naval aviation personnel who reached Europe before the war ended.|$|E

40|$|There are {{considered}} the basics of organization of design of the automated  enterprise control systems elements of the <b>aircraft</b> <b>instrument</b> engineering enterprises; there are specified the stages of introduction of the AECS of the <b>aircraft</b> <b>instrument</b> engineering enterprises; there {{are considered}} the aspects of choice of means and tools of the enterprise automation. There is specified {{that it is very}} important to clearly define the goals, objectives and methods of automation, to take into account the economic component  of design and implementation, and regulatory requirements for automation upon organization of design of the AECS elements of the <b>aircraft</b> <b>instrument</b> engineering enterprises. These requirements are recommended to be reflected in the design technical specification and in the business plan of automation, which is an organizational and economic design tool. An important element of the business plan of automation shall be a financial justification, cost calculation and determination of the schedule of scientific-research and development works, and other important stages of design of the AECS elements. It was found that the most effective approach to the organization of design of the AECS elements from an economic and organizational point of view is the cooperation of engineering and IT departments of enterprises and technical professionals (units) of third-party developers. It was determined that an important technology to optimize the design process is the application of the integrated automation design systems.
