5|$|Crowning ceremonies {{arose from}} a worldview in which monarchs {{were seen as}} ordained by God to serve not merely as {{political}} or military leaders, nor as figureheads, but rather to occupy a vital spiritual place in their dominions as well.

During the Protestant Reformation, the idea of divinely ordained monarchs began to be challenged.|$|E
