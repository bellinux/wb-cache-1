5|$|After {{releasing}} Clannad, Jun Maeda {{decided to}} make a game based on Tomoyo's scenario from Clannad. Maeda handled the game's planning and scenario, and Leo Kashida, <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>member</b> of the team, accompanied him. As opposed to Itaru Hinoue who was the character designer and art director for Clannad, Fumio was the art director for Tomoyo After, while Hinoue helped Fumio with the character design. As such, characters who appeared in Clannad such as Tomoya and Tomoyo look similar but visibly different from when in Clannad. Maeda also composed the music for the game along with Key's signature composers Shinji Orito and Magome Togoshi.|$|E

5|$|Dixon's {{career began}} in 1999 {{when she met}} Sabrina Washington as they both joined a dance school in Fulham, south west London. Together, they decided to form a group when Dixon and Washington, the two co-founders, spotted Su-Elise Nash, a girl auditioning for another group. Dixon and Washington {{proposed}} that Nash join the group and together they formed a trio.

5|$|Senators raised {{concerns}} that the Congress could either abuse such authority or neglect to enact any such legislation after the adoption of this proposal. Tennessee Senator Estes Kefauver, the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Constitutional Amendments, a long-time advocate for addressing the disability question, spearheaded the effort until {{he died of a}} heart attack on August 10, 1963.

5|$|A {{number of}} student {{deaths in the}} late 1990s and early 2000s {{resulted}} in considerable media attention focussing on MIT's culture and student life. After the alcohol-related death of Scott Krueger in September 1997 as <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>member</b> at the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, MIT began requiring all freshmen {{to live in the}} dormitory system. The 2000 suicide of MIT undergraduate Elizabeth Shin drew attention to suicides at MIT and created a controversy over whether MIT had an unusually high suicide rate. In late 2001 a task force's recommended improvements in student mental health services were implemented, including expanding staff and operating hours at the mental health center. These and later cases were significant as well because they sought to prove the negligence and liability of university administrators in loco parentis.|$|E
5|$|Dunstan {{wasted no}} time in organising his new ministry, taking several {{portfolios}} for himself, and again taking the position of Treasurer of South Australia. Deputy Premier Des Corcoran took on most infrastructure portfolios—Marine and Harbours, and Public Works. Corcoran became the face of the Dunstan ministry in its relationship with the Labor caucus, with his ability to use his strong manner to settle disputes. Bert Shard became Health Minister, overseeing the construction and planning of new, major public hospitals: the Flinders Medical Centre and Modbury Hospital. Hugh Hudson took on the Education portfolio, an important role in a government that was determined to bring about profound change to the South Australian education system. Geoff Virgo, the new Transport Minister, was to deal with the Metropolitan Adelaide Transport Study (MATS) plans. Len King was made Attorney-General and Aboriginal Affairs Minister despite being <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>member</b> of parliament. Dunstan formed a strong circle of loyal ministers around him, in a style radically different from his predecessors.|$|E
5|$|However, {{during the}} 1980s, two Sun-observing {{satellites}} serendipitously discovered several {{new members of}} the Kreutz family, and since {{the launch of the}} SOHO Sun-observing satellite in 1995, it has been possible to observe comets very close to the Sun at any time of year. The satellite provides a constant view of the immediate solar vicinity, and SOHO has now discovered hundreds of new Sun-grazing comets, some just a few metres across. About 83% of the sungrazers found by SOHO are members of the Kreutz group, with the other being referred to as 'non-Kreutz' or 'sporadic' sungrazers (Meyer, Marsden, and Kracht1&2 families). On average, <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>member</b> of the Kreutz family is discovered every three days. Apart from Comet Lovejoy, none of the sungrazers seen by SOHO has survived its perihelion passage; some may have plunged into the Sun itself, but most are likely to have simply evaporated away completely.|$|E

25|$|Within a {{few years}} <b>a</b> <b>new</b> problem arose.

In general, the cooperative experienced regular problems because the administration took in more than it spent, and at times the system added too much scrip into the system via the amount issued to <b>new</b> <b>members.</b>|$|R
50|$|Beginning June 5, 2015, MBC Plus Media began teasing {{members of}} the show's cast, {{releasing}} <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>member's</b> identity every few days and eventually releasing a video trailer for the show as a whole.

5|$|Keibler began {{watching}} {{wrestling with}} her boyfriend at the time, Kris Cumberland. She {{can be seen in}} the crowd at Starrcade 1998 before the television title match, dancing in an nWo Wolfpac T-shirt. In late 1999, Keibler entered a contest held by World Championship Wrestling (WCW) to find <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>member</b> of the Nitro Girls dance troupe. In November, she defeated 300 other girls for a spot on the dance troupe and $10,000. Her winning routine was watched by 4.4 million viewers. Keibler performed dance routines every week on WCW's flagship show Monday Nitro under the name Skye. By 2000, Keibler was appearing on WCW as a Nitro Girl, attending school full-time, and cheering for the Baltimore Ravens.|$|E
5|$|Named and {{described}} by Polish paleontologist Maria Magdalena Borsuk-Białynicka in 1977, Opisthocoelicaudia was first {{thought to be}} <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>member</b> of the Camarasauridae, but is currently considered a derived member of the Titanosauria. Its exact relationships within Titanosauria are contentious, but {{it may have been}} close to the North American Alamosaurus. All Opisthocoelicaudia fossils stem from the Nemegt Formation. Despite being rich in dinosaur fossils, the only other sauropod from this rock unit is Nemegtosaurus, which is known from a single skull. Since the skull of Opisthocoelicaudia remains unknown, several researchers have suggested that Nemegtosaurus and Opisthocoelicaudia may represent the same species. Sauropod footprints from the Nemegt Formation, which include skin impressions, can probably be referred to either Nemegtosaurus or Opisthocoelicaudia as these are the only known sauropods from this formation.|$|E
5|$|The {{membership}} of the organization at this time remained largely static. In 1974, {{as a consequence of}} the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, Greece withdrew its forces from NATO's military command structure but, with Turkish cooperation, were readmitted in 1980. The Falklands War between the United Kingdom and Argentina did not result in NATO involvement because article 6 of the North Atlantic Treaty specifies that collective self-defence is only applicable to attacks on member state territories north of the Tropic of Cancer. On 30May 1982, NATO gained <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>member</b> when the newly democratic Spain joined the alliance; Spain's membership was confirmed by referendum in 1986. At the peak of the Cold War, 16 member nations maintained an approximate strength of 5,252,800 active military, including as many as 435,000 forward deployed US forces, under a command structure that reached a peak of 78 headquarters, organized into four echelons.|$|E

5|$|Both Idea and Adonis {{were created}} using Master Cages as weapons during the conflict, {{though they were}} only awakened in the present. Only Adonis fully awoke while Idea {{suffered}} an incomplete awakening when found by Pharzuph Division 7 and regressed to a childlike amnesiac state. In addition, Master Laban has been using Pharzuph Division 7 {{to gain access to}} the Master Cages so he could stop Adonis and continue the use of Soma energy by destroying the Arethia consciousness. Welt, <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>member</b> of Pharzuph Division 7, is contacted by Orpheus, the avatar of the Arethia's true will. Orpheus asks Pharzuph Division 7 through Welt to stop both Laban and Adonis, the latter wishing to bring destruction upon mankind for its treatment of the Arethia. Upon confronting Adonis after traveling to the Soma Ring via the Ring Tower, Pharzuph Division 7 defeat the incarnation of the deranged Arethia energies: with Welt's help, Adonis, Idea, and Orpheus stabilize the Soma flow and pacify the Visitors. Welt is returned to his comrades, but Orpheus, Adonis, and Idea must leave to merge with the Arethia along with the Visitor energies.|$|E
