5|$|Commercially, apples can {{be stored}} for some months in {{controlled}} atmosphere chambers to delay ethylene-induced ripening. Apples are commonly stored in chambers with higher concentrations {{of carbon dioxide and}} high air filtration. This prevents ethylene concentrations from rising to higher amounts <b>and</b> <b>preventing</b> ripening from occurring too quickly. Ripening continues when the fruit is removed from storage.|$|E
5|$|During the battle, the 35th Infantry was {{instrumental}} in forcing back the North Korean division <b>and</b> <b>preventing</b> it from advancing to capture Pusan. The delay was enough for UN forces to counterattack Inchon, effectively defeating the entire North Korean army at the Pusan Perimeter. The 35th Infantry's performance in the battle earned the regiment a Presidential Unit Citation.|$|E

5|$|Some {{drawbacks}} {{of using}} organoiodine compounds {{as compared to}} organochlorine or organobromine compounds is the greater expense and toxicity of the iodine derivatives, since iodine is expensive and organoiodine compounds are stronger alkylating agents. For example, iodoacetamide and iodoacetic acid denature proteins by irreversibly alkylating cysteine residues <b>and</b> <b>preventing</b> the reformation of disulfide linkages.|$|E

5|$|After {{his release}} from prison in 2010, Chen was placed under house arrest against Chinese law, and was closely {{monitored}} by security forces. Legally, he was proclaimed {{by the government to}} be a free man, but in reality the local government offered no explanation for the hundreds of unidentified agents monitoring his house <b>and</b> <b>preventing</b> visitors or escape. The national propaganda organ, the Global Times, expressed confusion over the issue, and suggested that the local government may not know how to handle it, but no disciplinary action was taken at the national level.|$|E

Terraces were layered with stone chips, sand, dirt and top soil, to absorb water <b>and</b> <b>prevent</b> it from {{running down the}} mountain. Similar layering protected the large city center from flooding. Multiple canals and reserves provide water throughout the city that could be supplied to the terraces for irrigation <b>and</b> to <b>prevent</b> erosion <b>and</b> flooding.|$|R

5|$|After several {{damaging}} air attacks, {{the naval}} surface combatants from both America and Japan {{withdrew from the}} battle area without either side securing a clear victory. However, the U.S. and its allies gained tactical and strategic advantage. Japan's losses were greater and included dozens of aircraft and their experienced aircrews. Also, Japanese reinforcements intended for Guadalcanal were delayed and eventually delivered by warships rather than transport ships, giving the Allies more {{time to prepare for}} the Japanese counteroffensive <b>and</b> <b>preventing</b> the Japanese from landing heavy artillery, ammunition, and other supplies.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{incidence}} of respiratory depression/arrest is low (0.1–0.5%) when midazolam is administered alone at normal doses, the concomitant use with CNS acting drugs, mainly analgesic opiates, may increase the possibility of hypotension, respiratory depression, respiratory arrest, and death, even at therapeutic doses. Potential drug interactions involving at least one CNS depressant were observed for 84% of midazolam users who were subsequently required to receive the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil. Therefore, efforts directed toward monitoring drug interactions <b>and</b> <b>preventing</b> injuries from midazolam administration {{are expected to have}} a substantial impact on the safe use of this drug.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} no known cure for {{multiple}} sclerosis, several therapies have proven helpful.

Alternative treatments are pursued by some people, despite the shortage of supporting evidence.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} March, the {{conflict}} had escalated into the Croatian War of Independence. The JNA stepped in, increasingly supporting the Croatian Serb insurgents <b>and</b> <b>preventing</b> Croatian police from intervening. In early April, {{the leaders of the}} Croatian Serb revolt declared their intention to integrate the area under their control, known as SAO Krajina, with Serbia. The Government of Croatia viewed this declaration as an attempt to secede.|$|E
5|$|Courageous carried four BL 15-inch Mk I guns in two {{hydraulically}} powered twin gun turrets, designated 'A' and 'Y' {{from front to}} rear. Her secondary armament consisted of eighteen BL 4-inch Mk IX guns mounted in six manually powered mounts. The mount placed three breeches too close together, causing the 23 loaders to get in one another's way, <b>and</b> <b>preventing</b> the intended high rate of fire. A pair of QF 3-inch 20 cwt anti-aircraft guns were fitted abreast the mainmast on Courageous. She mounted two submerged tubes for 21-inch torpedoes and carried 10 torpedoes for them.|$|E

5|$|Franklin {{realized}} that wooden buildings could {{be protected from}} lightning strikes, and the deadly fires that often resulted, by placing a pointed iron on a rooftop, with {{the other end of}} the rod placed deep into the ground. The sharp point of the lightning rod would attract the electrical discharge from the cloud, and the lightning bolt would hit the iron rod instead of the wooden building. The electric charge from the lightning would flow through the rod directly into the earth, bypassing the structure, <b>and</b> <b>preventing</b> a fire.|$|E
5|$|In 1865, Congress passed {{what would}} become the Civil Rights Act of 1866, guaranteeing {{citizenship}} without regard to race, color, or previous condition of slavery or involuntary servitude. The bill also guaranteed equal benefits and access to the law, a direct assault on the Black Codes passed by many post-war states. The Black Codes attempted to return ex-slaves to something like their former condition by, among other things, restricting their movement, forcing them to enter into year-long labor contracts, prohibiting them from owning firearms, <b>and</b> <b>preventing</b> them from suing or testifying in court.|$|E
