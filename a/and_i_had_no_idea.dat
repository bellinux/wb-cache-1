500|$|Patrick's {{voice is}} {{provided}} by actor Bill Fagerbakke, who also does the voices of numerous other characters on SpongeBob SquarePants. While creating the show and writing its pilot episode in 1997, Hillenburg and Derek Drymon, the show's then-creative director, were also conducting auditions to find voices for the show's characters. Fagerbakke auditioned {{for the role of}} Patrick after Tom Kenny, SpongeBob's voice actor, had been cast. Fagerbakke said, [...] "Steve is such a lovely guy, and I had absolutely no feeling for the material whatsoever." [...] He described his experience in the audition, saying [...] "I was just going in for another audition, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> what was in store there in terms of the remarkable visual wit and really the kind of endearing child-like humanity in the show. I couldn't pick that up from the audition material at all. I was just kind of perfunctorially trying to give the guy what he wanted." ...|$|E
500|$|Rimsky-Korsakov socialized and {{discussed}} music {{with the other}} members of The Five; they critiqued one another's works in progress and collaborated on new pieces. He became friends with Alexander Borodin, whose music [...] "astonished" [...] him. He spent an increasing amount of time with Mussorgsky. Balakirev and Mussorgsky played piano four-hand music, Mussorgsky would sing, and they frequently discussed other composers' works, with preferred tastes running [...] "toward Glinka, Schumann and Beethoven's late quartets". Mendelssohn was not thought of highly, Mozart and Haydn [...] "were considered out of date and naïve", and J.S. Bach merely mathematical and unfeeling. Berlioz [...] "was highly esteemed", Liszt [...] "crippled and perverted from a musical point of view... even a caricature", and Wagner discussed little. Rimsky-Korsakov [...] "listened to these opinions with avidity and absorbed the tastes of Balakirev, Cui and Mussorgsky without reasoning or examination". Often, the musical works in question [...] "were played before me only in fragments, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> of the whole work". This, he wrote, did not stop him from accepting these judgments at face value and repeating them [...] "as if I were thoroughly convinced of their truth".|$|E

500|$|Bill Fagerbakke voiced SpongeBob's best friend, a starfish named Patrick Star in the episode. He {{auditioned for}} the role after Kenny had been cast as SpongeBob. [...] Fagerbakke said, [...] "Steve is such a lovely guy, and I had {{absolutely}} no feeling for the material whatsoever." [...] He described his experience in the audition, saying [...] "I was just going in for another audition, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> what was in store there {{in terms of the}} remarkable visual wit and really the kind of endearing child-like humanity in the show. I couldn't pick that up from the audition material at all. I was just kind of perfunctorially trying to give the guy what he wanted." [...] For the part of Squidward, Hillenburg originally had Mr. Lawrence in mind {{for the role}}. Lawrence worked with Hillenburg and Drymon before on Rocko's Modern Life, so while working on the episode, Hillenburg invited him to audition for all the characters. Drymon said, [...] "We were showing Doug the storyboard, and he started reading back to us in his Tony the Tiger/Gregory Peck voice. It was really funny, and we wound up having SpongeBob use a deep voice when he entered the Krusty Krab for the first time." [...] Hillenburg decided to give Lawrence the part of the series villain, Plankton, instead.|$|E

2500|$|Shortly thereafter, however, Lt. Comdr. Carpenter, the ship's navigator, who seldom {{left the}} bridge, shouted, [...] "Hard right rudder, DeLong." [...] I spun the rudder over hard right and started singing out the course changes every ten degrees. I {{glanced out the}} {{porthole}} as the bow swung past the line of sight to the Juneau {{who had been on}} our starboard quarter in the formation. The ship was swinging at a rapid speed now <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> what was going on.|$|E

2500|$|On June 10, 2010, Oscar De La Hoya said {{negotiations}} for a Mayweather-Pacquiao fight {{were close to}} being finalized. Speaking to Spanish-language sport show República Deportiva, De La Hoya briefly talked about {{the current status of}} negotiations and, with a grin on his face, said that the two sides were extremely close to making the biggest fight in boxing a reality. [...] "These negotiations have been real difficult for various reasons, but we're really close to finalizing the contracts, even though they've been complicated," [...] he commented. [...] "Today, I can't really talk about the negotiations, but we're really close." [...] A week later, Golden Boy Promotions CEO Richard Schaefer refuted De La Hoya's comments. [...] "I saw those quotes as well, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> what Oscar was talking about. And I called him up and asked him about them, {{and he said that he}} was misquoted," [...] Schaefer explained to Lem Satterfield of FanHouse.|$|E
2500|$|In 1890, Bennett {{remained}} with the Beaneaters {{even though he}} had in 1886 joined the Brotherhood of Professional Base-Ball Players, the union that represented the players and organized the Players' League in response to unfair treatment by team owners. [...] As a member of the Brotherhood, his refusal to play in the Players' League was criticized by many of his fellow Brotherhood members. Hardy Richardson, a Brotherhood representative and former teammate of Bennett, stated that Bennett offered to sign with the Brotherhood only if he was given a three-year contract guaranteed by two responsible men. Some reports indicated that former Detroit manager Robert Leadley was paid $1,000 to convince Bennett to remain with the Beaneaters and that Bennett was himself paid a substantial signing bonus. [...] Bennett later described his ambivalence about the Players' League: [...] "I was a Brotherhood man from the first. Mrs. Bennett was strongly opposed to my going into it and before the season opened I told my friends that I could not join them, so I {{remained with}} the Boston Club. When I went into the Brotherhood it was a protective order <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> that they intended organizing an association of their own." ...|$|E
2500|$|Commentators {{have noted}} how Dir en Grey have gained a {{significant}} international fanbase with vocals in Japanese. Kaoru said [...] "when I was growing up, I listened to American bands. They were all singing in English <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> {{what they were}} saying. But I still remember the excitement that I experienced. I know as a listener that our fans can connect to our music {{in the same way}} — even with the language barrier." [...] When asked why they almost always use Japanese instead of English, which would give them more broad international appeal, he said that [...] "We consider our music [...] a piece of art. [...] The language is part of that artwork." [...] The guitarist explained that Kyo, who writes all of the lyrics, prefers [...] "the sensitivities that Japanese language offers. There are expressions and nuances that can only be conveyed in Japanese; he values that." [...] However, he noted that likewise there are some expressions that are only able to be shown in English, and they will use it if they feel the need. The lyrics deal with subjects such as society and mass media, as well as sexual obsessions and love, usually with negative implications. The vocabulary varies from subtle to explicit (though the use of profanity has greatly decreased as the band matured, last featuring on Uroboros), and several songs rely heavily on double entendres and other wordplay, often involving the multiple meanings of a kanji character.|$|E
