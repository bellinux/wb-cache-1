500|$|Joseph Sargent {{produced}} {{and directed the}} film. He had worked with Lorraine Gary in 1973's The Marcus-Nelson Murders, for which {{he won his first}} Directors Guild of America Award. Indeed, Steven Spielberg cites this television film, that later spawned Kojak, as motivation for casting Gary as Ellen Brody in the original Jaws film, besides the fact she was the wife of the studio's chief executive Sidney Sheinberg at that time. In regards to Revenge, Gary remarked in an interview: [...] "I made a good deal on this film, but I didn't make as good a deal <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> if I weren't married to Sid." ...|$|E
500|$|He {{eventually}} {{turned down}} talks with York {{and agreed to}} sign a one-year contract with fellow Conference team Mansfield Town on 19 May. On signing, Smith said [...] "It {{was time for a}} change after not getting as much football <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> liked. I'm still young, Mansfield are {{going in the right direction}} and I'm excited about the new season". He made his debut in the opening match of 2010–11, a 3–1 victory over Forest Green, and was substituted in the 80th minute. Smith scored his first goal for Mansfield in a 4–0 victory over Altrincham on 30 August. A red card in the 61st minute of a 1–0 defeat at Gateshead on 2 October for a high challenge resulted in a three match suspension. He finished the season with 38 appearances and six goals.|$|E

500|$|Most of the Breckinridges were Whigs, but John Breckinridge's posthumous {{influence}} inclined {{his grandson}} toward the Democratic Party. Additionally, John C. Breckinridge's friend and law partner, Thomas W. Bullock, {{was from a}} Democratic family. In 1842, Bullock told Breckinridge {{that by the time}} they opened their practice in Burlington, Iowa, [...] "you were two-thirds of a Democrat"; living in heavily Democratic Iowa Territory further distanced him from Whiggery. He wrote weekly editorials in the Democratic Iowa Territorial Gazette and Advisor, and in February 1843, he was named to the Des Moines County Democratic committee. A letter from Breckinridge's brother-in-law related that, when Breckinridge's uncle William learned that his nephew had [...] "become loco-foco", he said, [...] "I felt <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> done if I had heard that my daughter had been dishonored." [...] On a visit to Kentucky in 1843, Breckinridge met and married Mary Cyrene Burch, ending his time in Iowa.|$|E
500|$|Breckinridge {{remained}} in Lexington while deciding {{where to begin}} practice, borrowing law books from the library of John J. Crittenden, Thomas Crittenden's father. Deciding that Lexington was overcrowded with lawyers, he moved to Frankfort, {{but was unable to}} find an office. After being spurned by a love interest, he and former classmate Thomas W. Bullock departed for the Iowa Territory on October 10, 1841 seeking better opportunities. Journeying westward, they considered settling on land Breckinridge had inherited in Jacksonville, Illinois, but they found the bar stocked with able men like Stephen A. Douglas and Abraham Lincoln. They continued on to Burlington, Iowa, and by the winter of 1842–1843, Breckinridge reported to family members that his firm handled more cases than almost any other in Burlington. Influenced by Bullock and the citizens of Iowa, he identified with the Democratic Party, and by February 1843, he had been named to the Democratic committee of Des Moines County. Most of the Kentucky Breckinridges were Whigs, and when he learned of his nephew's party affiliation, William Breckinridge declared, [...] "I felt <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> done if I had heard that my daughter had been dishonored." ...|$|E
500|$|Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club graded {{the episode}} [...] "C", writing that {{it felt like}} [...] "a frantic attempt to raise a bunch of {{potential}} storylines for season two and an attempt to put things {{in place for the}} season finale". He criticized the show's lack of continuity, particularly with regard to the Jesse and Rachel storyline. Entertainment Weekly Tim Stack also observed the lack of continuity in the Jesse storyline, calling it [...] "slightly confusing" [...] and [...] "a little half-baked"; continuity errors in his storyline may have been the result of the change in episode broadcast order. He felt that the episode was [...] "a slight let down", noting: [...] "There wasn’t as much tension <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> hoped going into the finale but there were still plenty of fun moments to enjoy." [...] James Poniewozik of Time attributed part of the episode's problems to it being [...] "an episode that could air easily out of order", explaining: [...] "Glee is a very serial show, after all, but this episode largely consisted of moments that felt dropped in and random, in a way that undermined even the good moments." ...|$|E

500|$|Although the European films {{allowed him}} to travel {{and gave him a}} {{constant}} source of income, he received bigger fees from his less-frequent engagements in US films, which he continued to appear in, joking that he [...] "knew the fat cheques in the pipe-line were endless". One of the bigger fees came with Gene Kelly's 1967 film A Guide for the Married Man; he was disappointed by Kelly's direction, later saying [...] "I found him a very prudish director, not as imaginative or experimental <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> liked". Terry-Thomas had more time for the actress with whom he shared his short scene, Jayne Mansfield, commenting that [...] "I found her rather intelligent to talk to and felt quite shattered when I read about the gruesome car accident that killed her". An actress he had difficulties in working with was Doris Day: in the 1968 film Where Were You When the Lights Went Out?, which was produced by her husband Martin Melcher. Day would instruct Terry-Thomas how he should act in a scene (he would [...] "listen... politely, then do it my own way, as if the conversation had never taken place"). She would also launch into improvisations while filming; director Hy Averback would mimic a scissor action behind her back to signal to Terry-Thomas that the material would be duly cut from the final print. The result was a film that Geoff Mayer called [...] "limp", and Christopher Young described as [...] "such an uneven movie that misses so many opportunities for real comedy".|$|E

[...] I thought ‘no, I’ll have an early night and be ready for tomorrow’, but the room service pizza wasn’t what it was supposed to be.

2500|$|... "Tears of the Prophets" [...] was {{the final}} episode of Deep Space Nine to feature actress Terry Farrell. Her {{contract}} on the show was set to expire after the sixth season and she elected not to sign a new contract for a further season. The day after her final scene was shot, she tested for the sitcom Becker. She later {{said that she would}} have been happy with a recurring role during the seventh series of Deep Space Nine as she was tired of the long hours required of her in a main cast role. The writers felt that due to the ongoing Dominion War in the series, that there was no alternative other than to kill off the character. Farrell said of the exit of her character, [...] "I don't feel cheated out of the character in the same way <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> if the show had been cancelled, because I've gotten the opportunity to play her. And besides, it's Jadzia that's dying. Dax is living." ...|$|E
