5|$|Small scale {{can be done}} on a local X-ray tube source, {{typically}} {{coupled with}} an image plate detector. These {{have the advantage of}} being (relatively) inexpensive and easy to maintain, and allow for quick screening and collection of samples. However, the wavelength light produced is limited by anode material, typically copper. Further, intensity is limited by the power applied and cooling capacity available to avoid melting the anode. In such systems, electrons are boiled off of a cathode and accelerated through a strong electric potential of ~50 kV; having reached a high speed, the electrons collide with a metal plate, emitting bremsstrahlung and some strong spectral lines corresponding to the excitation of inner-shell electrons of the metal. The most common metal used is copper, which can be kept cool easily, due to its high thermal conductivity, and which produces strong Kα and Kβ lines. The Kβ line is sometimes suppressed with a thin (~10 µm) nickel foil. The simplest and cheapest variety of sealed X-ray tube has a stationary anode (the Crookes tube) <b>and</b> <b>run</b> <b>with</b> ~2 kW of electron beam power. The more expensive variety has a rotating-anode type source that run with ~14 kW of e-beam power.|$|E
5|$|The {{college is}} {{actively}} involved in the development and use of assistive technology to aid visually impaired people in their everyday lives. For example, working with a United States-based software engineer, RNC produced the T3 (Talking Tactile Tablet), a touch sensitive device for interpreting tactile images such as diagrams, charts and maps. The device is connected to a computer <b>and</b> <b>run</b> <b>with</b> a programme CD, and has a tactile surface which produces touchable icons that provide audio feedback when they are pressed. The device was originally developed for educational purposes but can be adapted for other uses. In 2005 Hereford Museum and Art Gallery became the first in the United Kingdom to invest in the technology. The T3 was later marketed internationally {{with the help of the}} UK Trade & Investment's passport initiative– a scheme which gives new exporters the training, planning and support they need to succeed in overseas markets.|$|E
5|$|The game also {{includes}} a multiplayer mode, where up to four players can compete {{against each other in}} seven different game types: Beach, Raptor, Heist, War, Tank, Race and Deathmatch. In Beach, some players must go up through a beach and into a waiting escape vehicle, while others must stop them by firing at them from fixed positions. Raptor involves players controlling raptors to feed a baby dinosaur, while others play as cavemen that have to steal dinosaur eggs. Heist engrosses players in the robbery of a bank, where the goal is to retrieve a cash bag {{from the center of the}} level <b>and</b> <b>run</b> <b>with</b> it to the team's vault without being damaged. War can either be a traditional capture the flag mode or Total War, where players have to get the other teams gas canister and use it to release a chemical gas that annihilates the enemy. Similarly, in Tank players fight against each other by using tanks and grabbing chemical canisters that can release a lethal corrosive gas, destroying all the tanks that are outdoors. Race is a racing mode which provides two variations of the same course. Items can be acquired and used against opponents. Finally, there is a standard deathmatch mode where players fight against each other in shooting style from a third-person perspective. Players can set a number of different options for each game, such as score limit, number of lives, and inclusion of optional bots.|$|E

5|$|On Monday Night Football, the Bears {{traveled}} west to {{face the}} 2–6 San Diego Chargers. The two teams last met in 2011 at Soldier Field, the Bears winning 31–20, though their last meeting in San Diego was in 2007, which the Chargers won 14–3, and the last MNF game in San Diego was a Chargers 20–7 victory in 1984; in eleven games, the Bears led the series 6–5. Jeff Joniak wrote that the Bears offense could capitalize on a defense that allowed the most yards after the catch in the NFL. Additionally, offenses often started drives at 32-yard line, ranked 31st in the league, while the Chargers also had the least points off turnovers with seven. The Chargers were also allowing 6.34 yards per play, the second-worst in the NFL. To attack, the offense would balance passes that focused on favorable receiver/cornerback matchups <b>and</b> <b>run</b> <b>with</b> Jeremy Langford, who was making his first career start with Matt Forte out. Defensively, the Bears faced an offense struggling with injuries, particularly at the line: of the five positions, four have seen two or more players starting. However, quarterback Philip Rivers excelled despite the injuries, having thrown for 18 touchdowns and 7.9 yards per pass, {{both of which were}} {{among the highest in the}} NFL; Rivers' performance had also enabled him to be in position to overtake Peyton Manning's single-season passing yards record. The Chargers had the top-ranked offense in the NFL, and also ranked first in yardage after the catch. Another offensive player that the Bears faced was tight end Antonio Gates, who led the league in career touchdowns with 101. However, the San Diego running game was struggling, with 3.6 rushing yards per play, which ranked 30th in the league. Special teams-wise, both teams were among the worst in the NFL: the Chargers were ranked 30th in average return yardage allowed, while the Bears were 31st; the former also allowed a league-high ten returns of 30–39 yards. For the Chargers' punt return unit, they had only one yard in 2015. San Diego also had league-worsts in starting yard line after kickoffs with 19.3 yards, drives starting within their own 20-yard line (11) and average starting area (21). Forte, receiver Eddie Royal, safety Harold Jones-Quartey, Shea McClellin, Hroniss Grasu, Tayo Fabuluje and defensive lineman Ziggy Hood were inactive.|$|E

25|$|The {{game was}} opened, as now, by a kick-off. The player of 1880 might, if he chose, drive the ball {{far down the}} field. Or, {{technically}} kicking the ball by merely touching it with his toe, he might pick it up <b>and</b> <b>run</b> <b>with</b> it. Players when tackled invariably endeavored to pass the ball back to another member of their side for a further advance, a method of play so highly developed {{that it was not}} infrequent to see a ball passed as many as five times during a single play.|$|E

25|$|Bucs quarterback Trent Dilfer's 23-yard {{completion}} to Karl Williams {{on third}} down and 1 {{set up the}} first score of the game, Michael Husted's 22-yard field goal with 5:25 {{left in the first}} quarter. The Lions received a huge scoring opportunity when Williams fumbled a punt {{at the end of the}} next drive. Lions linebacker Matt Russell got to the ball first, but instead of falling on the ball, he tried to pick it up <b>and</b> <b>run</b> <b>with</b> it. Instead of grabbing the ball, he accidentally batted it out of bounds, allowing the Bucs to keep possession on the Lions 11-yard line. Taking full advantage of their second chance, Tampa Bay subsequently drove 89 yards in 17 plays, taking 8:50 off the clock and converting three third downs, one from a 12-men on the field penalty against Detroit. Dilfer finished the drive with a 9-yard touchdown pass to Horace Copeland that put the team up 10-0. Later on, Buccaneers cornerback Anthony Parker intercepted a pass from Mitchell and returned it 19 yards to the Lions 20-yard line, setting up Husted's 43-yard field goal that gave the team a 13-0 lead at the end of the half. Tampa Bay had a chance to increase their lead even more before halftime with a drive to the Lions 43, but Ron Rice intercepted a pass from Dilfer on the last play of the second quarter.|$|E

500|$|Ultimately, Doniger O'Flaherty was {{critical}} of Dreamtime, commenting that [...] "Duerr is attempting to hunt with the hounds <b>and</b> <b>run</b> <b>with</b> the hare, and his book is likely to infuriate both ordinary readers and scholars." [...] Although initially appearing suitable for the average reader, she felt that most would be {{put off by the}} [...] "daunting scholarly apparatus" [...] he had employed, and the [...] "heaviness of the argument". Believing that the book was difficult to read, she felt that Duerr had hidden his arguments in the footnotes, and that reading the first third of the book was akin to [...] "wandering stoned through the stacks of a very fine European library, browsing in the sections devoted to witchcraft, hallucinogens and orgiastic cults. It is good fun, but it is not for all tastes." [...] She equally felt that the book would be criticized by academics and other scholars working in the fields of witchcraft history and the history of religion, who would recognize that the book not only contained multiple factual errors, but also that many of Duerr's arguments were unoriginal, having previously been made by Mircea Eliade and Victor Turner.|$|E

500|$|Kemp was {{a critic}} of {{association}} football, known as soccer in the United States. In 1986, during a House floor debate over whether the United States should host the 1994 FIFA World Cup, Kemp proclaimed: [...] "I {{think it is important}} for all those young out there—who someday hope to play real football, where you throw it and kick it <b>and</b> <b>run</b> <b>with</b> it and put it in your hands— a distinction should be made that football is democratic capitalism, whereas soccer is a European socialist sport." [...] Kemp compared his speech to George Carlin's 1984 comedy routine on the differences between baseball and American football and wrote that his [...] "tongue was firmly planted in cheek" [...] when making the speech. Despite the levity of the speech, it garnered significant backlash. However, he continued to insist that soccer's main problem is [...] "it doesn't have a quarterback". Kemp noted that about half of his grandchildren play or have played organized soccer and claimed to have [...] "changed" [...] his position on soccer. He even attended the 1994 FIFA World Cup with longtime soccer fan Henry Kissinger, although he wrote during the 2006 FIFA World Cup that soccer can be interesting to watch but is still a [...] "boring game".|$|E

[...] HostGator's Jeremy Jensen attributed {{the campaign}}'s success to Reynolds, as well as Fox embracing the film's R rating. He concluded that, [...] "More than anything the Deadpool marketing campaign managed to create a relationship with the people who ended up going to see it. They were honest, creative, and completely relentless." [...] Alisha Grauso of Forbes felt the campaign's success came from the marketing team understanding the character, having freedom from the usual creative constraints put on film marketers, and not revealing much of the film's actual content. Grauso also praised the marketing team for utilizing Reynolds, and said, [...] "Audiences have been more than ready for the weird and wild, and that's the point—Fox was smart enough to see that <b>and</b> <b>run</b> <b>with</b> it. Most marketing campaigns don't give audiences credit for being all that intelligent or open-minded, but {{the campaign for}} Deadpool didn't hold back ... was just like the character himself.
