40|$|This paper puts {{forward a}} general {{compressive}} strength criterion for <b>anisotropic</b> <b>rock</b> materials under multiaxial state of stress. The proposed criterion, is a generalization of the Von Mises yield criterion for ductile metals, which criterion {{has previously been}} used for brittle fracture as well, both being looked upon as limits of linear elastic behaviour. The proposed criterion takes into consideration the effects, on rock material failure under multiaxial stress state, of confining pressure, presence of various stress components, and material anisotropy. Relevant failure envelopes, for several types of rock materials, are compared with corresponding experimental results; close agreement being obtained in all cases.

Then, its capabilities are demonstrated through an application to a Taiwan argillite subjected to direct tensile loading (including off-axis ones) for which the damage model well captures experimental data (mechanical response, growing damage rocks strength).

40|$|The {{advantages}} {{and limitations of}} point load test have been extensively discussed in literature. Although, the point load strength can {{be representative of the}} uniaxial strength of isotropic rocks, it can be misleading in the case of <b>anisotropic</b> <b>rocks</b> due to the presence of foliation or bedding planes. The foliated nature of most metamorphic rocks suggests a directional variation in their point load strength. The paper describes results from tests performed on <b>anisotropic</b> <b>rocks,</b> according to the suggested method by ISRM but also using alternative loading directions in the diametral test.

40|$|Excavation of boreholes, tunnels, caverns and {{underground}} {{galleries in}} <b>anisotropic</b> <b>rock</b> usually {{has a higher}} risk of failure than in isotropic rock since beddings act as weak planes which cause redistribution of stress and serve as fracture initiators. However, in previous studies underground constructions are usually modeled by simplifying the anisotropic condition to transverse isotropic condition without rigorous consideration of the effect of rock anisotropy on the stress distribution, failure mechanism/pattern, and preferred instability. In this study, the mechanical behaviors of inherently <b>anisotropic</b> <b>rock</b> were investigated at grain-scale with the use of discrete element method (DEM) under different stress conditions. To achieve this goal, a novel numerical modeling technique is developed based on DEM, in which the rock matrix is represented as bonded particle model and the existence of inherently anisotropy is explicitly represented by imposing individual smooth-joint contacts into the bonded particle model with the same orientation. The research was first started with proposing a new set of micro-mechanical analyses linking the transmission of load to the evolution of micro cracks which allow us to extract innovative features emerged from the stresses and fracture propagation in later simulations. True triaxial compression tests were simulated on isotropic rocks to evaluate the effect of intermediate principal stress 2. In the brittle regime, micro-cracks concentrate in a band striking sub-parallel to 2. With the increase of 2 and 3, the distribution of contact force becomes more homogeneous which results in the distribution of cracks transform from localized to be distributed. Systematic parametric studies were conducted to assess the effect of smooth-joint parameters on the mechanical properties of <b>anisotropic</b> <b>rock</b> samples under both uniaxial compression test and Brazilian test conditions. After that, step-by-step procedures for the calibration of micro parameters were recommended. The numerical model was calibrated to simulate the behaviors of rocks with different degrees of anisotropy. Various failure modes i. e. elastic mismatch, sliding wing crack and compression induced tensile crack, were found to be the dominant mechanism with different anisotropy angles. The new numerical approach was then applied in the simulation of stress-induced borehole breakouts in <b>anisotropic</b> <b>rock</b> formations at reduced scale. Effects of different factors including the particle size distribution, borehole diameter, far-field stress anisotropy and rock anisotropy on the stress distribution and borehole breakout propagation were systematically evaluated. Spiral-shaped shear fractures can be obtained in relatively homogenous model while three V-shaped concentrated fractures arise in the more heterogeneous model as wider particle size distribution results in the local stress perturbations which cause localization of cracks. Rock anisotropy plays an important role on the stress state around wellbore which lead to the formation of preferred cracks under hydrostatic stress. Far-field stress anisotropy plays a secondary role when drilled parallel with beddings. This study provides insights on how to orientate structures in a preferential direction and to make safer and more economic designs of underground structures. published_or_final_versionCivil EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E

40|$|Summary. A {{method for}} the {{determination}} of the <b>anisotropic</b> character-istics of <b>rock</b> samples by acousto-polarization analysis is described. Linearly polarized shear-waves generated by a transducer, propagate through a sample and are recorded by a polarized receiver.

The method can determine the orientation of the anisotropic symmetry axes, and can be used to examine linear anisotropic absorption.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new approach, {{combined with the}} Boundary Element Method (BEM) analysis and the diametrical compression on a thin disc with a small central hole, {{referred to as the}} ring test, for determining the indirect tensile strength of <b>anisotropic</b> <b>rocks.</b> The stress distribution around the hole can be successfully obtained by the proposed single-domain BEM. The complex variable function method was used for conveniently computing the tractions and displacements of a two-dimensional anisotropic body. If we assume that the tensile strength is given by the maximum absolute value of stress in the direction perpen-dicular to the loaded diameter at the intersection of loaded diameter and the hole, then from the failure load recorded by laboratory testing of ring (disc), the indirect tensile strength of rocks could be obtained. A marble from Hualien (Taiwan) with clearly black-white folia-tion, which was assumed to be transversely isotropic, was selected to conduct both ring tests and Brazilian tests for evaluating the tensile strength. The variation of the marble tensile strength with the inclination angle of foliation and with the hole size was also investigated. In general, the tensile strength of <b>anisotropic</b> <b>rocks</b> determined by ring test is not a constant, but depends on the elastic properties of rocks, the angle between the planes of rock aniso-tropy and the loading direction, the diameter of the central hole, and the contact condition of loading. 1...|$|R
40|$|Active faults unfavorably {{oriented}} {{with respect}} to the regional maximum compressive stress have been labeled as "weak. " The seismic hazards posed by these faults make understanding this apparent weakness a priority. Stress rotations in these fault zones, together with an increase in mean stress, could enable high pore fluid pressures to weaken a fault zone. Such a model requires a foundation in the physics and mechanics of damage. This paper presents a new model for stress rotations in fault zones by combining the Effective Medium Theory with anisotropic poroelasticity. This approach enables the quantitative characterization of crack damage and the prediction of progressive changes in the elastic properties of rocks across the fault zone. The processes of fault growth and wear will lead to distinct patterns of crack damage, with different effects on the elastic properties. Elevated pore fluid pressures have long been known to change the effective normal and shear stresses of <b>anisotropic</b> <b>rocks,</b> and this work incorporates these effects into a multilayer fault zone model. It is shown that high pore fluid pressures in the <b>anisotropic</b> <b>rocks</b> of the core zone can generate large stress rotations (i. e., more fault-parallel), and increases in mean stress, sufficient to weaken the fault. Stress rotations in the damage zones of unfavorably oriented faults tend to be away from the fault (i. e., more fault-normal) for likely combinations of damage patterns and pore fluid pressure...|$|R

40|$|Knowing the {{strength}} properties of rocks {{is essential for}} calculating the stability of natural slopes, constructions in and on rock, excavations, blasting geometry, crushing, and drilling. When rock and rock masses are subjected to either dynamic or static loads, the tensile strength is determined by tests appropriate to the load type. Static tests include both indirect tests, such as the Brazilian test, and direct tests like the dumbbell-shaped direct pull. Conventional dynamic tests are the Hopkinson pressure bar and ultrasonic methods. This work has two objectives: (1) to characterize diverse rocks in terms of dynamic and static tensile failure behavior, and (2) to conduct problem-based research for minimizing the generation of fines by-product in rock fragmentation and comminution. Two major processes of aggregate production are blasting and crushing operations. The rock is subjected mainly to tensile stresses and failure in both processes. A method for measuring the quantity of rock fines was suggested for the Brazilian test. A working hypothesis for {{reducing the amount of}} rock fines in the Brazilian test was examined. Moreover, an analytical solution for discs subjected to the Brazilian test was also presented; this facilitates an accurate analysis of the Brazilian test for <b>anisotropic</b> <b>rocks.</b> Also, a Hopkinson pressure bar was constructed and then modified to measure the dynamic uniaxial tensile strength of rock cores in which rock fails in pure tension. Results showed that, for a specific type of rock, generation of fines depends on the tensile strength of the rock. The higher the tensile strength, the higher is the percentage of fines produced. The working hypothesis that reduction of {{the strength}} of rock through water saturation should reduce fines generation was examined and shown to be true for the rocks tested.

In order to examine the effect of humidity a series of semi-circular bend tests were performed under various water vapour pressures in a rock material that is known to be anisotropic. Water vapour promotes stress corrosion of rock and therefore the fracture toughness was found to have a decreasing trend with increasing water vapour pressure.

40|$|International audienceInitiation, {{geometry}} and mechanics of brittle faulting in exhuming metamorphic rocks are discussed {{on the basis}} of a synthesis of field observations and tectonic studies carried out over the last decade in the northern Cycladic islands. The investigated rocks have been exhumed in metamorphic domes partly thanks to extensional detachments that can be nicely observed in Andros, Tinos and Mykonos. The ductile to brittle transition of the rocks from the footwall of the detachments during Aegean post-orogenic extension was accompanied by the development of asymmetric sets of meso-scale low-angle normal faults (LANFs) depending on the distance to the detachments and the degree of strain localization, then by conjugate sets of high-angle normal faults. This suggests that rocks became progressively stiffer and isotropic and deformation more and more coaxial during exhumation and localization of regional shearing onto the more brittle detachments. Most low-angle normal faults result from the reactivation of precursory ductile or semi-brittle shear zones; like their precursors, they often initiate between or at the tips of boudins of metabasites or marbles embedded within weaker metapelites, emphasizing the role of boudinage as an efficient localizing factor. Some LANFs are however newly formed, which questions the underlying mechanics, and more generally rupture mechanisms in <b>anisotropic</b> <b>rocks.</b> The kinematics and the mechanics of the brittle detachments are also discussed in the light of recent field and modeling studies, with reference to the significance of paleostress reconstructions in <b>anisotropic</b> metamorphic <b>rocks...</b>|$|R
