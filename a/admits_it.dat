500|$|The second {{command is}} to {{purchase}} {{products that are}} sold by the Church, which its leaders teach was founded by Dobbs to gain wealth. Unlike most religious groups, the Church proudly <b>admits</b> <b>it</b> is for-profit (presumably mocking some religious groups {{that seem to have}} ulterior financial motives). Cusack sees the instruction to buy as an ironic parody of the [...] "greed is good" [...] mentality of the 1980s, and Kirby notes that although the group emphasizes [...] "the consumption of popular cultural artefacts", this consumption is [...] "simultaneously de-emphasized by the processes of remix".|$|E

Germans felt that they the country had signed away her honor, {{and there was a}} prevailing belief of humiliation as the article was seen, overall, as an injustice. Historian Wolfgang Mommsen commented that despite the public outrage, German government officials were aware [...] "that Germany's position on this matter was not nearly so favorable as the imperial government had led the German public to believe during the war." ...|$|E
