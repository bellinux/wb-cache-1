40|$|The {{relationship}} between physical and sensory properties of 40 model <b>skin</b> <b>creams</b> was investigated. Creams were formulated {{according to an}} experimental design {{to ensure that a}} wide range of textural properties could be produced from a minimal number of ingredients. The core project study comprised of objective sensory profiling of model <b>skin</b> <b>creams</b> (QDA, Quantitative Descriptive Analysis) and the physical characterisation of the textural and flow properties relevant to the use of <b>skin</b> <b>creams</b> (rheology, texture analysis and force plate analysis). Sensory attributes related to initial <b>skin</b> <b>cream</b> application procedures (firmness, thickness, resistance, spreadability, stickiness and slipperiness) were highly correlated to rheological and texture analysis parameters. Attributes related to application procedures involving a time factor and absorption of <b>cream</b> into the <b>skin</b> (drying, dragging, final greasiness and absorption) were found to be correlated to parameters from force plate analysis. A consumer study was also conducted based on a subset of the model <b>skin</b> <b>creams</b> to identify properties of <b>skin</b> <b>creams</b> that are liked by the naïve consumer. Cluster analysis and external preference mapping identified groups of consumers with different types of liking behaviour. The firmness and thickness of the samples were found to be important regarding consumer liking. Models were generated to predict the sensory properties of creams from the physical parameters. Rheological parameters (G′ at 100 % strain and logG′′ at 100 % strain) produced the most robust models that could predict firmness, thickness, resistance, spreadability and slipperiness. Models predicting attributes involving absorption of <b>cream</b> into the <b>skin</b> were less robust, these involved force plate analysis parameters.

40|$|Skin can {{be damaged}} by the {{environment}} easily. <b>Skin</b> <b>cream</b> is an effective and rapid way to moisten the skin by changing the skin surface properties. Rat skin and pig skin are common animal models for studies and were used as skin samples in this study. The nano- and macroscale friction and durability of damaged skin were measured and {{compared with those of}} virgin (intact/undamaged) skin. The effect of <b>skin</b> <b>cream</b> on friction and durability of damaged and virgin skin samples is discussed. The effects of velocity, normal load, relative humidity and number of cycles were studied. The nanoscale studies were performed by using atomic force microscope (AFM), and macroscale studies were performed by using a pin-on-disk (POD) reciprocating tribometer. It was found that damaged skin has different mechanical properties, surface roughness, contact angle, friction and durability compared to that of virgin skin. But similar changes occur after <b>skin</b> <b>cream</b> treatment. Rat and pig skin show similar trends in friction and durability...|$|R

The efficacy of specific <b>skin</b> <b>creams</b> for the treatment and prevention of early stage pressure ulcers has not previously been evaluated.

Those ulcers treated with the Curaderm hp cream demonstrated a 100 % cure rate within 14 days. The ulcers treated with either the Eucerin cream or Sween cream had a variable outcome. Some of the ulcers were partially healed while others did not heal or progressed to a later stage. The data suggests that the early use of specific <b>skin</b> <b>creams</b> may be useful as adjunctive therapy in the overall treatment protocol of early stage pressure ulcers...|$|R
