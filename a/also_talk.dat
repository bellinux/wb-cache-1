Crypton plans to start an electronic magazine for English readers at the end of 2010 in order to encourage the growth of the English Vocaloid fanbase.

The composition is set in the key of A major with Madonna's vocal ranging from E3 to C5.

Although informed of this during the conference, Captain Brown and Commander Millett left the conference under the mistaken belief that there were still five buoys marking the acoustical range.|$|E

Even though Martin Wood was credited for directing the episode, Andy Mikita ended up directing most of it instead, as well as directing parts of [...] "Adrift"; Wood was directing [...] at the time of filming. Amanda Tapping requested that showrunners Mallozzi and Mullie not give her a big part for the episode, as she was in the Arctic filming for Stargate: Continuum. Another reason that Carter's appearance was small was that Torri Higginson was still a part of the show, and the producers wanted Carter to be introduced slowly.

500|$|By {{the fourth}} ballot, on Saturday, June 23, Sherman {{had about the}} same number of votes he had started with, but was being {{challenged}} by a surge from former Indiana senator Benjamin Harrison. [...] The convention then adjourned until Monday, June 25. [...] With almost two days for intrigue, rumors swept through the convention that Blaine would be a candidate after all. Late on Saturday night, Foraker released a statement that he would support Blaine. [...] Walters proffered several reasons for the switch: [...] Foraker felt Sherman had no chance, resented not being thanked by Sherman for the seconding speech, and was annoyed at the trickle of votes McKinley had received, feeling that the congressman was being prepared as a backup candidate for the Sherman forces. There was <b>also</b> <b>talk</b> that Foraker might gain a place on the ticket, either for president or vice president, though he stated he would not accept a nomination without Sherman's consent. [...] The switch wounded Sherman's candidacy by showing that his own state's governor did not support him, and even though Foraker switched back to Sherman when Blaine wired reiterating that he was not a candidate, the damage was done; Harrison gained the nomination on the eighth ballot.|$|E

The lyrics <b>also</b> <b>talk</b> about falling in love while being true to oneself, which was the initial inspiration for the track. She compares herself with [...] "Dorothy on a yellow brick, Hope my ruby shoes get us there quick", referring to the fictional yellow brick road traveled by Dorothy Gale in the 1939 film, The Wizard of Oz.
