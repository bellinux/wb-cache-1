5|$|During the Depression I joined Mrs Mac's {{electrical}} {{school in}} Phillip Street. It {{was the first}} time girls were involved with electrical circuits, Morse and making radio sets. Later Mrs Mac {{decided it was time to}} use our skills in industry, so she persuaded Airzone Ltd to take one of us (me) on trial in their radio section. Soon the others followed from the school, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> started the component parts section, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> were absorbed into many other sections.|$|E

5|$|I went to New York <b>and</b> <b>we</b> were in {{the studio}} and came to a break. I was sitting at the piano and told Mariah about this movie.
