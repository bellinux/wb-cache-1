40|$|In the C 2 CA {{concrete}} recycling process, autogenous milling of {{the crushed}} End of Life (EOL) concrete is a mechanical method to remove cement paste {{from the surface}} of aggregates. During autogenous milling, the combination of shearing and compression forces, promotes selective attrition and delivers a better liberation. In order to investigate the effects of shear and compression on the cement recovery and specify the importance of them, a new set-up is designed and constructed. This set-up permits aforesaid forces to be determined and controlled. For experimental design, the MINITAB 16 software was used and 13 different experimental runs based on varying shear and compression forces were conducted. After each experiment, the amount of cement recovery using XRF analysis, water absorption of the recycled aggregates and energy consumption during the process were measured. Results show that both shear and compression forces have in?uence on improving the cement recovery.

The` main factors in the C 2 CA process which influence the properties of Recycled Aggregates or Recycled Aggregate Concrete (RAC) include the type of Parent Concrete (PC), the intensity of autogenous milling and ADR cut-size point. This study aims to investigate the influence of PC and intensity of the autogenous milling {{on the quality of the}} produced recycled aggregates. Three types of concrete which are frequently demanded in the Dutch market were cast as PC and their fresh and hardened properties were tested.

Present Situation and Development Trend of Grinding Equipment Grinding is a high power dissipation and inefficient operation, and the power of crushing operation accounting for 8 % to 12 %.

40|$|Bibliography: p. 103 - 116. Comminution is {{the process}} which aims at {{increasing}} the surface area and the resultant liberation of a particular constituent from the mass of a solid. The <b>autogenous</b> <b>mill</b> uses tumbling to effect comminution, but instead of special milling bodies being added, pebbles of the material to be comminuted are used. The autogenous comminution process utilises less than 0, 1 per cent of the energy input. The principal objective of the present work was to analyse autogenous milling behaviour {{in terms of the}} individual comminuting mechanisms and to establish the inter-relationships between the main process variables, namely rock petrography, size distribution of the feed, applied load, relative velocity and environment. In this manner the optimisation of the process and an improvement of its efficiency was sought. In addition the establishment of testing procedures to predict the autogenous milling behaviour of a given type of rock was aimed. In the present work the gold bearing Witwatersrand quartzite was used, although the findings are applicable to other types of rocks. Since fracture phenomena are involved in all comminuting mechanisms of impact-compression, chipping and abrasion, slow compression and Brazilian tests were performed. The grain size and the mineral composition of the rock has been found to have a large influence on the local stresses required for these processes. Indeed the results show that the fragility and therefore ease of comminution increases with increasing grain size of the quartzite. Brazilian tests on drill cores of varying diameters may allow the prediction of the critical size of rock of the mill feed which can survive in a mill of given characteristics...|$|E

[pp. i - iv missing] This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the development of an instrument for the purpose of performing online measurement of rock size distribution using machine vision. This instrument has application in the gold mining industry where it could be used to measure the fragmentation of gold ore on a conveyor belt feed to an <b>autogenous</b> <b>mill,</b> for the purpose of controlling the mill. The gold ore can range in size from fine material (< 20 mm) to very large rocks (0. 5 m). A machine vision approach is only capable of directly measuring the projected area of particles at the surface of the rock-stream. A volume distribution has to be estimated from this using a stereological method. These methods have been investigated previously and are typically error prone. They have not been investigated here. An investigation of lighting demonstrates that a diffuse lighting arrangement is suitable for this application. This would have two advantages: specular reflection from wet material is suppressed; and intensity values can be used to predict the orientation of the surface of the particles. A computational structure has been developed to identify and delineate rocks in an image for the purpose of measuring their areas. It is based on the human visual system in that it consists of a low-level preattentive vision stage and a higher-level stage of attention focusing. Multiscalar image processing techniques have also been integrated in order to improve the detection of rocks across a wide range of sizes. A performance advantage can be obtained in this way because all the algorithms can be better matched {{to the size of the}} objects being detected. Results have been obtained with an average true detection rate of 69 and a further close miss rate of 14, with very few false alarms.

40|$|Designing an {{efficient}} and economic mineral processing plant {{begins with the}} choice of the best and most economic comminution circuit based on ore properties and concentrate end-userâs specifications. This is because crushing and grinding for preparation of suitable feed for the downstream processes are cost intensive. The Itakpe iron ore processing plant presently produces a taiing material containing up to 22 % iron minerals mostly fines produced inevitably during comminution. This article analyzed the existing circuit and ore properties, and presents specific comminution tests that were undertaken in order to recommend an alternate and more effective circuit.

While 2 D codes may provide a reasonable profile of charge distribution in the mill {{there is a difference}} in power estimations as the anisotropic nature within the mill cannot be neglected. Thus 3 D codes are preferred as they can provide a more accurate estimation of power draw and charge distribution. While 2 D codes complete a typical industrial simulation in the order of hours, 3 D codes require computing times in the order of days to weeks on a typical multi-threaded desktop computer. A newly developed and recently introduced 3 D DEM simulation environment is BLAZE-DEM that utilizes the Graphical Processor Unit (GPU) via the NVIDIA CUDA programming model. Utilizing the parallelism of the GPU a 3 D {{simulation of}} an industrial mill with four million particles takes 1 h to simulate one second (20 FPS) on a GTX 880 laptop GPU. This new performance level may allow 3 D simulations to become a routine task for mill designers and researchers. This paper makes two notable extensions to the BLAZE-DEM environment. Firstly, the sphere-face contact is extended to include a GPU efficient sphere-edge contact strategy. Secondly, the world representation is extended by an efficient representation of convex geometrical primitives that can be combined to form non-convex world boundaries that drastically enhances the efficiency of particle world contact. In addition to these extensions this paper verifies and validates our GPU code by comparing charge profiles and power draw obtained using the CPU based code Millsoft and pilot scale experiments.

The rock quality index and the two dimensionless ({pi}) indices developed by Kewen Yin of the University of Minnesota are used by Minntac Mine to design their blasts, but the drill monitor data from any given pattern is obviously not available {{for the design of}} that shot. Therefore, the blast results [...] which are difficult to quantify in a short time [...] must be back-analyzed for comparison with the drill monitor data to be useful for subsequent blast designs. {pi}{sub 1 } indicates the performance of the drill, while {pi}{sub 2 } {{is a measure of the}} rock resistance to drilling. As would be expected, since a drill tends to perform better in rock that offers little resistance, {pi}{sub 1 } and {pi}{sub 2 } are strongly inversely correlated; the relationship is a power function rather than simply linear. Low values of each Pi index tend to be quantized, indicating that these two parameters may be most useful above certain minimum magnitudes.

A numerical model, Discrete Element Method (DEM) a much more detailed model for the nonlinear behaviour of mill loads is proposed as a possible solution to this problem. The Discrete Element Method algorithm is a numerical technique for solving problems that involve a large number of interacting bodies. The dissipative forces (normal, tangential or frictional) at points of contact are modelled using a springslider- dashpot and the dynamics of the particles are modelled by applying Newtonâs laws of motion. A record of information about contact events occurring during simulation is stored in the output files and can be thereafter applied {{for a wide range of}} purposes. The contact events and their corresponding energy levels derived from the simulation are applied to determine the particle failure rate in a mill. The probability of particle failure does however also depend on the inherent fracture properties of a material; hence particle fracture tests on the ore samples were conducted using the JK drop-weight impact test machine. Using this tool, data that related the probability of breakage to the energy input and the number of impact attempts were obtained and a model describing this relationship was derived. Using the energy spectra that resulted from the simulations of milling and the Breakage probability model, an attempt was made to predict the experimental results of a mill operating under a wide range of conditions. Good prediction was achieved after a careful choice of model parameters. A systematic approach of establishing the most suitable parameters is recommended for future work. These parameters would also compensate for conditions beyond the limits of the model such as particles being too small to simulate or having a complex shape. The predictions were based on two size fractions as a way of making this task more manageable. It is apparent that this work can be extended to do a full SAG and AG mill simulation...|$|R

An instrumented load cell package that can measure the force of impacts inside the grinding chamber of a mill is developed here. The signal from the instrumented load cell package is interpreted in terms of a histogram termed as an impact spectrum which is a plot of the number of impacts at a specific energy level against the energy. It reflects on the average force regime of the mill. The instrumented load cell package was calibrated against the ultra fast load cell which has been unanimously accepted as a standard to measure single breakage events. The load cell package was successfully used to produce impact spectra in an 8. 5 inch lab scale mill. The mill speed and the ball size were varied to study their effect on the impact spectra. A good correlation was found between the process variables and the impact spectra. The load cell package was then used in a 16 inch pilot scale mill. The mill speed, ball size, and mill filling were varied here and a consistent trend between these variables and impact spectra was observed.

50|$|White {{cast iron}} {{displays}} white fractured surfaces {{due to the}} presence of an iron carbide precipitate called cementite. With a lower silicon content (graphitizing agent) and faster cooling rate, the carbon in white cast iron precipitates out of the melt as the metastable phase cementite, Fe3C, rather than graphite. The cementite which precipitates from the melt forms as relatively large particles. As the iron carbide precipitates out, it withdraws carbon from the original melt, moving the mixture toward one that is closer to eutectic, and the remaining phase is the lower iron-carbon austenite (which on cooling might transform to martensite). These eutectic carbides are much too large to provide the benefit of what is called precipitation hardening (as in some steels, where much smaller cementite precipitates might inhibit plastic deformation by impeding the movement of dislocations through the pure iron ferrite matrix). Rather, they increase the bulk hardness of the cast iron simply by virtue of their own very high hardness and their substantial volume fraction, such that the bulk hardness can be approximated by a rule of mixtures. In any case, they offer hardness at the expense of toughness. Since carbide makes up a large fraction of the material, white cast iron could reasonably be classified as a cermet. White iron is too brittle for use in many structural components, but with good hardness and abrasion resistance and relatively low cost, it finds use in such applications as the wear surfaces (impeller and volute) of slurry pumps, shell liners and lifter bars in ball <b>mills</b> and <b>autogenous</b> grinding <b>mills,</b> balls and rings in coal pulverisers, and the teeth of a backhoe's digging bucket (although cast medium-carbon martensitic steel is more common for this application).|$|R

To more clearly delineate the effects {{of different types of}} breakage, surface wear has not been included in these simulations. The simulated results are compared with the measured results. The cumulative damage model is more realistic for SAG operation but is inadequate for AG. Hence, any realistic model must incorporate several breakage mechanisms. Issues such as relating modelling inputs to particle breakage characterisation data and the accuracy of the predictions of the models are discussed...|$|R
40|$|A Final ReportThe pellets {{produced}} by Minnesota taconite companies generally contain between 4. 0 and 7. 0 percent silica. These silica levels were established initially by the concentratability of the ore, that is, its response to closed circuit ball mill grinding and magnetic concentration. Those operations that had taconite {{that was easy}} to concentrate generally produced lower silica pellets. As processing technology improved and it became possible to achieve lower silica levels constraints imposed by the blast-furnace operation became limiting. These constraints related primarily to sulphur and alkali levels in the furnace which control both the volume and chemistry of the furnace slag. Because the trend in blast-furnace practice has been to move toward lower slag volumes, pellets with lower silica levels have become more desirable. Recent extensive installation of external hot metal desulphurization facilities at many steel works allows even lower slag volumes. The basic driving force to go to lower slag volumes is the cost and availability of high quality metallurgical grade coke and related environmental problems. The recent move to produce fluxed pellets has made lower pellet silica levels more attractive because of the lower palletizing costs related to both the lower flux addition and higher production rates with a lower silica content. A common target silica level in fluxed pellets is now about 4. 0 percent. A 4. 0 percent silica pellet requires a concentrate containing between 3. 7 and 3. 9 percent silica depending upon bentonite addition levels. This lower silica level has been accomplished in some plants {{by the use of}} fine screens, while other plants require the use of silica flotation. The lower silica level has been accomplished at a relatively small incremental cost, generally less than $ 0. 50 per ton. With increasing pressure from the blast furnaces for lower-silica pellets to reduce coke consumption, concentrate silica levels on the order of 3. 0 percent may be common in the future. In addition to the need to produce a lower silica blast-furnace feed, there is a potential need to produce even lower silica concentrates, below 3. 0 percent, as feed stock for direct steelmaking. Worldwide the current research emphasis is on the development of a coal-based direct-steelmaking process to replace the conventional two step, blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace, process. Most of the current prototype direct steel making processes would benefit from a lower silica feed. These low silica levels will require increasingly complex and expensive secondary treatment of normal magnetic concentrates which exceed the capability of current taconite processing flowsheets. The purpose of this test program is to establish the lower silica limits that can be achieved by current technology for various Minnesota taconites and gain a preliminary indication of the cost. Because the magnetite concentrates {{produced by}} different taconite plants range significantly in terms of their size-silica relationships the program included three different concentrate sources for evaluation. Major differences will exist between concentrates produced in a fully autogenous grinding system and those produced in a conventional rod mill-ball mill circuit in which the ball mills are closed with hydrocyclones and/or a combination of hydrocyclones and fine screens. There are also differences {{in the nature of the}} siliceous gangue minerals in the various operations. The concentrates from the western Mesabi range contain quartz and low- grade metamorphic iron silicates such as minnesotaite, stilpnomelane, and talc and iron carbonates. The concentrates from the east Mesabi metamorphosed iron formation contain high grade metamorphic iron silicates such as cummingtonite, grunerite, and fayalite as well as quartz. The type of gangue mineral greatly affects the ability to upgrade the concentrates by silica flotation. The purpose of this test program is to determine the lowest silica content that it is technically possible to produce from three different concentrate sources representing the east Mesabi metamorphosed iron formation (Erie), the unmetamorphosed central range produced in a rod mill and ball mill circuit (Minntac), and the unmetamorphosed western Mesabi produced in an <b>autogenous</b> <b>milling</b> circuit (Hibtac). Sufficient data were collected to allow preliminary cost estimates to be made at several silica levels. The cost estimates will be based on reagent consumption, regrind power and metal requirements, and iron recovery. This report contains all of the information obtained on the Erie samples. This includes the results of the initial characterization studies, basic bench scale beneficiation test results, pilot plant flotation data, and the results of the secondary and tertiary treatment of bulk flotation froth to improve overall iron recovery.

40|$|Optimisation of {{grinding}} circuits is invariably {{dependent on}} sound process models together with process simulators that can solve the process models accurately. Most {{of the process}} models are solved numerically because analytical solutions are not available, {{which can lead to}} errors in the results due to the numerical approximation of mathematical equations. Whiten [1], and Valery Jnr & Morrell [2, 3] have developed a dynamic model with numerical simulation for <b>autogenous</b> and semi-autogenous <b>mills,</b> and validated the model with dynamic response of mills in terms of power draw, grinding charge level, slurry level and product size distribution to changes in feed rate, feed size, feed hardness and water addition [2, 3]. In this work, an analytical solution for their dynamic model of tumbling mills has been developed based on the knowledge of solutions to the first-order nonhomogeneous linear differential equations. Two algorithms, Direct Single Time method (DST) and Direct Multiple Time method (DMT), were applied to obtain the analytical solutions respectively. It was found that analytical solutions are more accurate than the traditional finite difference numerical methods. However, the DST analytical method has a drawback of numerical instability due to the accumulation of round-off errors which are amplified by exponential functions, whilst the DMT method can provide stable solutions. To test the DMT analytical method, two cases of SAG mill dynamic operation were studied with both the traditional numerical method and the newly developed analytical method, further proving the robustness and feasibility of the analytical solutions...|$|R
40|$|This study aims to {{understand}} the material behaviour of ore inside a coarse ore stockpile by discrete element modelling. This is of importance since the stockpile is the last stage to control the size distribution of ore in the ore handling system before feeding the grinding circuit. An optimal size distribution is required for efficient grinding in an <b>autogenous</b> grinding (AG) <b>mill.</b> To investigate the material behaviour in the stockpile this work focussed on the flow mode inside the stockpile and the size distribution during discharge. The individual particle characteristics are important to apply in the modelling; hence the discrete element method is very well suited {{for this type of}} modelling due to its distinct particle character. In this work the discrete element package used is EDEM, which is a discrete element modelling package developed by the commercial company DEM Solutions. In order to study this aim, several measures in the modelling were taken. The size distribution was divided into the three important sizes, as they are determined by the AG mill. Fines are sized 30 mm, pebbles are 80 mm and coarse particles are 130 mm. A calibration of the parameters of these particles was carried out in order to acquire the correct bulk density, angle of repose and static wall friction of the material in the simulations. Furthermore, an effective simulation model was found by the application of two measures. Firstly, the use of a 3 D slice instead of a full 3 D simulation showed good results. The second measure was to simulate only coarse sized material to represent each of the particles sizes, which also proved to be very well applicable. Based on segregation mechanisms two different methods to fill the stockpile were determined; batch and mixed filling. The influence of these filling methods was simulated for different flow modes in order to review the impact on the discharged size distribution. It was found that the best suitable mill feed was obtained by batch filled stockpiles, especially since core flow was the expected flow mode. Furthermore, {{it was found that the}} ratio between input and output rate has a significant impact on the size distribution at the discharge, since this ratio determines whether there is a âlast-in, first-outâ system. High input rates result in heap formation, which leads to segregation of coarse sized material. Therefore, at a high input rate it is advised to feed finer material. Feeding of coarser material at moments with a low input rate result in a more optimal size discharge, then when this is done at moments with high input rate.
