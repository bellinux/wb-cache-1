2500|$|The number <b>and</b> {{percentage}} of <b>older</b> adults {{living in the}} United States vary across the four different regions (Northeast, Midwest, West, and South) defined by the United States census. [...] In 2010, the South contained {{the greatest number of}} people aged 65 years <b>and</b> <b>older</b> <b>and</b> 85 years <b>and</b> <b>older.</b> [...] However, proportionately, the Northeast contains the largest {{percentage of}} adults aged 65 years <b>and</b> <b>older</b> (14.1%), followed by the Midwest (13.5%), the South (13.0%), and the West (11.9%). Relative to the Census 2000, all geographic regions demonstrated positive growth in the population of adults aged 65 years <b>and</b> <b>older</b> <b>and</b> 85 years <b>and</b> <b>older.</b> The most rapid growth in the population of adults aged 65 years <b>and</b> <b>older</b> was evident in the West (23.5%), which showed an increase from 6.9 million in 2000 to 8.5 million in 2010.

40|$|A scoping {{review was}} {{undertaken}} to examine current Australian federal, state and territory government health policy documents to ascertain their relevance to midlife <b>and</b> <b>older</b> adult sexual health.

Existing policy has a focus on risk, not wellbeing, in relation to sexual health, and an emphasis on reproduction, which excludes midlife <b>and</b> <b>older</b> people. This paper provides evidence of absence of sexual health policy relating to the needs of midlife <b>and</b> <b>older</b> adults in Australia. Without a policy that specifically addresses the sexual health of midlife <b>and</b> <b>older</b> adults they will continue be overlooked in health promotion planning and sexually transmissible infection testing strategies. We recommend the development of Australian sexual health policy that supports and promotes good sexual relationships and sexual health specific to the needs of midlife <b>and</b> <b>older</b> adults...|$|R
