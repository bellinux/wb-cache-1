5|$|A {{possible}} transitional form of microorganism {{between a}} prokaryote and a eukaryote {{was discovered in}} 2012 by Japanese scientists. Parakaryon myojinensis is a unique microorganism larger than a typical prokaryote, but with nuclear material enclosed in a membrane as in a eukaryote, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> endosymbionts. This is seen {{to be the first}} plausible evolutionary form of microorganism, showing a stage of development from the prokaryote to the eukaryote.|$|E

5|$|Be Reasonable is {{a monthly}} {{interview}} show that engages guests with ideas {{outside the mainstream}} scientific consensus, such {{as a member of}} the Flat Earth Society. In the first episode, on 28 January 2013, hosts Hayley Stevens (until June 2014) and Michael Marshall described the show as an examination of their guests' beliefs and their structure, and the evidence they believe supports these beliefs. Guests have discussed past life therapy, aura photography <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> aliens on Earth.|$|E
30|$|The {{health risk}} factors were {{veterinary}} drug residues in camel milk and meat, diarrhoea/vomiting, allergic reaction, resistance to human and veterinary drugs <b>and</b> cancer. <b>The</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> these {{public health and}} food safety risk factors demonstrates the likelihood of spreading zoonotic diseases between animals <b>and</b> human. <b>The</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> veterinary drug residuals may lead to development of resistance in the common diseases affecting <b>the</b> livestock <b>and</b> humans in <b>the</b> study area.|$|R

5|$|Characteristics of {{the tail}} {{vertebrae}} <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> osteoderms indicate that Ampelosaurus belongs to Lithostrotia, a group of derived titanosaurians which also includes Alamosaurus and Saltasaurus. Many other paleotologists have classified Ampelosaurus as belonging to Titanosauria, Saltasauridae, and Titanosauridae. Ampelosaurus may have an uncertain classification, but it is clearly a titanosaur, with many features found in titanosaurs.|$|E
5|$|Coprolites {{have been}} {{recorded}} in the Lameta Formation, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> fungi in coprolites indicates that leaves were eaten by the dinosaurs which lived in a tropical or subtropical climate. Another scientific study of similarities in egg taxa suggested close phyletic relationships that supports {{the existence of a}} terrestrial connection between dinosaurian fauna in India and Europe during the Cretaceous, and between two Gondwanan areas, Patagonia and India.|$|E
5|$|Costs {{increase}} with dementia severity <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> behavioural disturbances, and {{are related to}} the increased caregiving time required for the provision of physical care.

5|$|DNA {{exists in}} many {{possible}} conformations that include A-DNA, B-DNA, and Z-DNA forms, although, only B-DNA and Z-DNA have been directly observed in functional organisms. The conformation that DNA adopts {{depends on the}} hydration level, DNA sequence, the amount and direction of supercoiling, chemical modifications of the bases, the type and concentration of metal ions, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> polyamines in solution.|$|E
5|$|Dysarthria is {{the most}} common {{communication}} problem in individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS), however, significant difficulties with speech and intelligibility are uncommon. Individuals with MS vary widely in their motor control capacity <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> intention tremor, and methods of access to AAC technology are adapted accordingly. Visual impairments are common in MS and may necessitate approaches using auditory scanning systems, large-print text, or synthetic speech feedback that plays back words and letters as they are typed.|$|E

Lipid levels <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> xanthomata can confirm the diagnosis. Sitosterolemia and cerebrotendineous xanthomatosis are two rare conditions that can also present with premature atherosclerosis and xanthomas. The latter condition can also involve neurological or psychiatric manifestations, cataracts, diarrhea and skeletal abnormalities.|$|E

5|$|In this phase, {{water vapor}} {{condenses}} on various nuclei {{present in the}} air, forming the cumulus cloud. This creates the characteristic flat-bottomed puffy shape associated with cumulus clouds. The height of the cloud (from its bottom to its top) depends on the temperature profile of the atmosphere <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> any inversions. During the convection, surrounding air is entrained (mixed) with the thermal and the total mass of the ascending air increases.|$|E

5|$|Methane {{can exist}} in the Martian {{atmosphere}} for only a limited period before it is destroyed—estimates of its lifetime range from 0.6–4 years. Its presence despite this short lifetime indicates that an active source of the gas must be present. Volcanic activity, cometary impacts, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> methanogenic microbial life forms are among possible sources. Methane could be produced by a non-biological process called serpentinization involving water, carbon dioxide, and the mineral olivine, which {{is known to be}} common on Mars.|$|E
