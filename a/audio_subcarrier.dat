5000|$|... 87.75 MHz, a frequency-modulated <b>audio</b> <b>subcarrier</b> used by all NTSC-M {{analog channel}} 6 {{television}} stations ...|$|E
5000|$|The 59.94 rate {{is derived}} from the {{following}} calculations. Designers chose to make the chrominance subcarrier frequency an n + 0.5 multiple of the line frequency to minimize interference between the luminance signal and the chrominance signal. (Another way this is often stated is that the color subcarrier frequency is an odd multiple of half the line frequency.) They then chose to make the <b>audio</b> <b>subcarrier</b> frequency an integer multiple of the line frequency to minimize visible (intermodulation) interference between the audio signal and the chrominance signal. The original black-and-white standard, with its 15,750 Hz line frequency and 4.5 MHz <b>audio</b> <b>subcarrier,</b> does not meet these requirements, so designers had either to raise the <b>audio</b> <b>subcarrier</b> frequency or lower the line frequency. Raising the <b>audio</b> <b>subcarrier</b> frequency would prevent existing (black and white) receivers from properly tuning in the audio signal. Lowering the line frequency is comparatively innocuous, because the horizontal and vertical synchronization information in the NTSC signal allows a receiver to tolerate a substantial amount of variation in the line frequency. So the engineers chose the line frequency to be changed for the color standard. In the black-and-white standard, the ratio of <b>audio</b> <b>subcarrier</b> frequency to line frequency is [...] 285.71. In the color standard, this becomes rounded to the integer 286, which means the color standard's line rate is [...] &asymp; 15,734 Hz. Maintaining the same number of scan lines per field (and frame), the lower line rate must yield a lower field rate. Dividing [...] lines by 262.5 lines per field gives approximately 59.94 fields per second.|$|E
50|$|The NICAM {{system used}} with System I adds a 700 kHz wide digital signal, {{and needs to}} be placed at least 552 kHz from the <b>audio</b> <b>subcarrier.</b>|$|E
50|$|Radioteletype, fax, digital, slow-scan {{television}} and other systems use forms of frequency-shift keying or <b>audio</b> <b>subcarriers</b> on a shortwave carrier. These generally require special equipment to decode, such as software {{on a computer}} equipped with a sound card.|$|R
5000|$|Second <b>audio</b> program, <b>subcarrier</b> {{system used}} for {{alternative}} audio programming on television channels ...|$|R
50|$|The first {{widespread}} digital satellite audio {{distribution system}} was Digital Audio Transmission System (DATS). DATS {{was developed in}} 1982 by Scientific Atlanta. The DATS distribution system was first used by the largest U.S. radio networks such as Westwood One, ABC Radio Networks and NBC. The DATS system transmitted 15 kHz-wide <b>audio</b> <b>subcarriers</b> at a data rate of 1.544 Mbps using BPSK digital modulation.|$|R
50|$|While {{existing}} {{black and}} white receivers could not decode a signal with a different audio carrier frequency, they could easily use the copious timing information in the video signal to decode a slightly slower line rate. Thus, the new color television standard reduced the line rate {{by a factor of}} 1.001 to 1/286 of the 4.5 MHz <b>audio</b> <b>subcarrier</b> frequency, or about 15734.2657 Hz. This reduced the frame rate to 30/1.001 â‰ˆ 29.9700 Hz, and placed the color subcarrier at 227.5/286 = 455/572 = 35/44 of the 4.5 MHz <b>audio</b> <b>subcarrier.</b>|$|E
50|$|When XETV-TV {{shut down}} its analog signal on May 28, 2013, it {{shut down the}} station's 87.75 MHz <b>audio</b> <b>subcarrier.</b> An analog FM {{broadcast}} receiver cannot tune and decode digital television on any frequency.|$|E
50|$|The total RF {{bandwidth}} of System I (as {{originally designed}} with its single FM <b>audio</b> <b>subcarrier)</b> was about 7.4 MHz, allowing System I signals to be transmitted in 8.0 MHz wide channels with an ample 600 kHz guard zone between channels.|$|E
50|$|The {{separation}} between the primary <b>audio</b> FM <b>subcarrier</b> and the video carrier is 5.5 MHz.|$|R
50|$|SAW {{filters are}} also {{often used in}} radio receivers, as they can have {{precisely}} determined and narrow passbands. This is helpful in applications where a single antenna must be shared between a transmitter and a receiver operating at closely spaced frequencies. SAW filters are also frequently used in television receivers, for extracting subcarriers from the signal; until the analog switchoff, the extraction of digital <b>audio</b> <b>subcarriers</b> from the intermediate frequency strip of a television receiver or video recorder {{was one of the}} main markets for SAW filters.|$|R
40|$|The Satellite Instructional Television Experiment (SITE) is {{scheduled}} {{for the second year}} of satellite operation. Applications Technology Satellite (ATS- 6) will receive C-band video signals from Ahmedabad and Delhi, India, and will retransmitt the video and two <b>audio</b> <b>subcarriers</b> at 860 MHz to 6 clusters of 400 direct-receive stations for a total of 2400 direct-receive stations. Morning programs of 1. 5 hours per day are designed for classroom use, and evening programs of 2. 5 hours duration are designed for village adult education. Indian production antennas and television sets have been tested and found to meet specifications, and a successful experiment is anticipated...|$|R
50|$|Recently {{manufactured}} PAL television receivers can typically decode all {{of these}} systems except, in some cases, PAL-M and PAL-N. Many of receivers can also receive Eastern European and Middle Eastern SECAM, though rarely French-broadcast SECAM (because France used a quasi-unique positive video modulation, system L) unless they are manufactured for the French market. They will correctly display plain CVBS or S-video SECAM signals. Many can also accept baseband NTSC-M, such as from a VCR or game console, and RF modulated NTSC with a PAL standard <b>audio</b> <b>subcarrier</b> (i.e., from a modulator), though not usually broadcast NTSC (as its 4.5 MHz <b>audio</b> <b>subcarrier</b> is not supported). Many sets also support NTSC with a 4.43 MHz subcarrier.|$|E
50|$|Astra Digital Radio (ADR) was {{a system}} used by SES for digital radio {{transmissions}} {{on the early}} Astra satellites, using the <b>audio</b> <b>subcarrier</b> frequencies of analogue television channels. It was introduced in 1995. As of February 2008, there were still 51 stations transmitting in this format.|$|E
50|$|The total RF {{bandwidth}} of System B (as {{originally designed}} with its single FM <b>audio</b> <b>subcarrier)</b> was 6.5 MHz, allowing System B to be transmitted in the 7.0 MHz wide channels specified for {{television in the}} VHF bands with an ample 500 kHz guard zone between channels.|$|E
5000|$|The {{transmission}} of FM <b>audio</b> (including Stereo <b>subcarriers)</b> is only overall the 3rd largest consumer of TV transmitter power.|$|R
50|$|F2D : Data {{transmission}} by {{frequency modulation}} {{of a radio}} frequency carrier with an <b>audio</b> frequency FSK <b>subcarrier.</b> Often called AFSK/FM.|$|R
50|$|Satellite <b>subcarrier</b> <b>audio</b> is audio {{transmitted}} {{by way of}} satellite that utilizes a separate analog or digital signal carried on a main radio transmission (usually video) on a specific satellite transponder. More technically, it is an already-modulated signal, which is then modulated into another signal of higher frequency and bandwidth. In a more general sense, satellite <b>subcarrier</b> <b>audio</b> is an early form of satellite radio not intended for the consumer market but was initially unencrypted, thus receivable to satellite hobbyists.|$|R
50|$|Enhancements {{have been}} made to the {{specification}} of System Bs audio capabilities over the years. The introduction of Zweiton in the 1970s allowed for stereo sound or twin monophonic audio tracks (possibly in different languages for instance). This was implemented by adding a second FM <b>audio</b> <b>subcarrier</b> at +5.74 MHz. Alternatively, starting in the late 1980s and early 1990s it became possible to replace the second audio FM subcarrier with a digital signal carrying NICAM sound. Either of these extensions to audio capability have eaten into the guard band between channels. Zweiton uses an extra 150 kHz. The alternative NICAM system uses an extra 500 kHz, and needs to be spaced further from the primary <b>audio</b> <b>subcarrier,</b> thus System B with NICAM has only 150 kHz guard zones between channels.|$|E
50|$|The format {{used one}} mono <b>audio</b> <b>subcarrier,</b> which was {{normally}} allocated to an additional audio track or radio station, or one channel of a stereo audio track/station. The carrier was digitally modulated {{and carried a}} 192 kbit/s, 48 kHz sampled MPEG-1 Layer II (MP2) encoded signal. 9.6 kbit/s was available for data.|$|E
50|$|The PAL L (Phase Alternating Line with L-sound system) {{standard}} {{uses the}} same video system as PAL-B/G/H (625 lines, 50 Hz field rate, 15.625 kHz line rate), but with 6 MHz video bandwidth rather than 5.5 MHz. This requires the <b>audio</b> <b>subcarrier</b> to be moved to 6.5 MHz. An 8 MHz channel spacing is used for PAL-L.|$|E
50|$|DT64 {{lost all}} FM {{frequencies}} {{in the first}} half of 1992. In four new federal states these frequencies were given to private radio stations, in Berlin and Brandenburg a new public youth radio station (Rock Radio B, later Fritz) started on the frequencies DT64 used until this time. DT64 had to switch to AM in summer 1992, AM transmission lasted for one year. During this time the station got its new name, MDR Sputnik. Between 1993 and 1997 MDR Sputnik was available only via Astra satellite analog <b>audio</b> <b>subcarriers</b> and a special German digital Radio System DSR, receivable via Cable and satellite. In 1997 the FM coverage in Saxony-Anhalt was built up. During this time the program lost most of the journalistic content, most of the word content disappeared. At the end of this process there was nothing that could remind one of DT64.|$|R
2500|$|The Conservative {{government}} decided to increase competition on AM and disallowed the simulcasting of services on both AM and FM, affecting both BBC and Independent Local Radio. Radio 1's medium wave frequencies were reallocated to Independent National Radio. Radio 1's last broadcast on MW was on 1 July 1994, with Stephen Duffy's [...] "Kiss Me" [...] being the last record played on MW just before 9:00 am. For those {{who continued to}} listen, just after 9:00 am, Radio 1 jingles were played in reverse chronological order ending with its first jingle from 30 September 1967. In the initial months after this closure a pre-recorded message with Mark Goodier was played to warn listeners that Radio 1 was now an [...] "FM-only" [...] station. Around this time, Radio 1 began broadcasting on spare <b>audio</b> <b>subcarriers</b> on Sky Television's analogue satellite service, initially in mono (on UK Gold) and later in stereo (on UK Living).|$|R
50|$|For AM broadcasting, {{different}} analog (AM stereo) {{and digital}} (HD Radio) methods {{are used to}} produce stereophonic <b>audio.</b> Modulated <b>subcarriers</b> of the type used in FM broadcasting are impractical for AM broadcast due to the relatively narrow signal bandwidth allocated for a given AM signal. On standard AM broadcast radios, the entire 9 kHz to 10 kHz allocated bandwidth of the AM signal {{may be used for}} audio.|$|R
50|$|Analog {{television}} {{which was}} distributed via satellite was usually sent scrambled or unscrambled in NTSC, PAL, or SECAM television broadcast standards. The analog signal is frequency modulated and is converted from an FM signal {{to what is}} referred to as baseband. This baseband comprises the video signal and the audio subcarrier(s). The <b>audio</b> <b>subcarrier</b> is further demodulated to provide a raw audio signal.|$|E
5000|$|Though not {{technically}} a SAP channel, television stations can also broadcast a [...] "PRO" [...] (professional) <b>audio</b> <b>subcarrier</b> {{which is used}} to communicate with station personnel, particularly those engaged in electronic news gathering. This one-way audio channel allows individuals at the television station to send messages to people located away from the station, and is frequently employed during on-location newscasts as the foldback channel to reporters and cameramen. This channel is located at 6.5 times the pilot (102.271 kHz), and is also part of the MTS standard.|$|E
5000|$|Supergold was {{launched}} in the UK in November 1988 from the EAP studios in Frinton Essex UK and broadcast on the Intelsat Satellite 27.5 (on a mono <b>audio</b> <b>subcarrier)</b> initially heard between the hours of 11pm and 6am UK time (a high quality ISDN line took the signal from Frinton in Essex Â to the British Telecom Docklands uplink facility via the British Telecom Tower in central London). [...] "Supergold" [...] was put off the air for a whole night on one occasion when a cow chewed the ISDN line somewhere outside Clacton in Rural Essex UK.|$|E
50|$|Normally each {{channel is}} 200 kHz (0.2 MHz) wide, and can pass <b>audio</b> and <b>subcarrier</b> {{frequencies}} up to 100 kHz. Deviation is typically limited to 150 kHz total (Â±75 kHz) {{in order to}} prevent adjacent channel interference on the band. Stations in the U.S. may go up to 10% over this limit if they use non-stereo subcarriers, increasing total modulation by 0.5% for each 1% used by the subcarriers.|$|R
50|$|Spring 2005The uplink feed {{is moved}} to Vyvx (now Level 3) in Denver. Policy {{at the new}} {{location}} allows internet access via DSL. A computer is installed to carry even higher fidelity <b>audio</b> to the <b>subcarrier.</b>|$|R
50|$|Analog SCPC <b>subcarrier</b> <b>audio</b> is {{received}} using dedicated satellite receivers. SCPC audio receivers tune a frequency range of 50 to 90 MHz with both wide and narrow bandwidth options. Receivers in the hobbyist price range included the Heil SC-One and the Universal Electronics SCPC-100 and SCPC-200.|$|R
5000|$|WLFK (95.3 FM, [...] "95-3 The Wolf") is an FM {{broadcast}} station licensed for 6,000 watts at Gouverneur, New York. The station {{also has}} a low power repeater in Watertown, New York which broadcasts with 50 watts. The audio from this station can be heard on Time Warner Cable in Watertown, New York on channel 96. Time Warner picks up the broadcast from repeater 104.1 which is also in Watertown. Since the FM <b>audio</b> <b>subcarrier</b> for cable channel 96 can be heard on 101.75 FM, cable subscribers in the greater Watertown area can hear WLFK in a much larger area than its low powered Watertown signal can cover.|$|E
50|$|HD Radio {{does not}} use ATSC, the {{standard}} for digital television in the United States. In the days of analog television, {{the low end of}} the FM broadcast band (87.7 to 87.9 MHz) overlapped with the <b>audio</b> <b>subcarrier</b> of analog television's channel 6, which allowed the audio of television stations that broadcast on that channel to be heard on most FM radios. In earlier days of television and radio, several television stations exploited this overlap and operated as radio stations (a process that still continues with some low-powered stations, which are still allowed to broadcast in analog for the time being). Full-powered television stations were forced to cease analog broadcasting in June 2009, with low-powered stations scheduled to cease analog broadcasting by September 2015. Because the digital television and digital radio standards are incompatible with each other, HD radios are not able to receive digital TV signals on the 87.7 frequency, eliminating the antiquated dual-medium compatibility of channel 6 television stations.|$|E
5000|$|In October 1978, United Video Satellite Group uplinked {{the signal}} of Chicago {{independent}} station WGN-TV (channel 9) to the Satcom-3 satellite for distribution to {{cable and satellite}} subscribers throughout the United States. For about eleven years afterward, the national WGN-TV signal carried the same programming schedule as that seen in the Chicago area; the national feed also used the same on-air branding as the Chicago area signal (which was referred to on-air {{at the time as}} either [...] "Channel 9" [...] or [...] "WGN Channel 9") until 1997, when it became known as simply [...] "WGN" [...] outside of Chicago (although it retained the varied forms of the WGN logo wordmark until 2008). After United Video launched Prevue Guide (now the entertainment-based Pop) in the late 1980s, it utilized WGN's <b>audio</b> <b>subcarrier</b> channel - which was unheard by viewers - to transmit programming schedules in a 2400 bit/s data stream to local cable providers.|$|E
50|$|Satellite <b>subcarrier</b> <b>audio</b> was {{initially}} transmitted in analog form. This method of audio transmission was first employed by Fujitsu in 1973 {{as part of}} a data line between the United States and Spain. By the early 1980s, the use of analog subcarriers for radio network distribution had become well-established.|$|R
50|$|Although {{not widely}} used {{until the early}} 2000s, digital <b>subcarrier</b> <b>audio</b> has existed {{almost as long as}} its analog {{technology}} counterpart. In 1972, the BBC deployed a digital audio transmission system linking their broadcast center to their remote transmitters. This technology wasn't applied to satellite communications, however, until the early 1980s.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, a bug was {{discovered}} in a meeting room at the OPEC headquarters in Vienna. The bug intercepted the audio from the PA system via a pickup coil and transmitted it on a frequency near 600 MHz using <b>subcarrier</b> <b>audio</b> masking. It was not discovered {{who was responsible for}} planting the bug.|$|R
