The monocline is a sloping bend that raises the sandstone well above where it is expected to be seen, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> the whole of the visible top of the Blue Mountains is made of sandstone. From the beginnings of the colony in 1788, settlers and convicts had to work with the stone, using it for building and trying to grow crops on the soil over it. The sandstone had a negative effect on farming because it underlay most of the available flat land at a very shallow depth.|$|E

25|$|In {{previous}} years, {{tensions with}} Egypt had escalated in 1956 when the non-aligned President, Camille Chamoun, {{did not break}} off diplomatic relations with the Western powers that attacked Egypt during the Suez Crisis, angering Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser. This was during the Cold War and Chamoun has often been called pro-Western, though he had signed several trade deals with the Soviet Union (see Gendzier). However, Nasser had attacked Chamoun because of his suspected support for the US led Baghdad Pact. Nasser felt that the pro-western Baghdad Pact posed a threat to Arab Nationalism. However, president Chamoun looked to regional pacts to ensure protection from foreign armies: Lebanon historically had a small cosmetic army that was never effective in defending Lebanon's territorial integrity, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> in later years the PLO guerrilla factions had found it easy to enter Lebanon and set up bases, as well as takeover army barracks {{on the border with}} Israel as early as 1968. Yezid Sayigh documents the early skirmishes which saw the army not only lose control over its barracks to the PLO but also lost many soldiers. Even prior to this, president Chamoun was aware of the country's vulnerability to outside forces.|$|E

Among the persecuted resisters was Irena Sendlerowa, head of the children's section of Żegota, who placed more than 2,500 Jewish children in convents, orphanages, schools, hospitals and homes. Captured by the Gestapo in 1943, Sendlerowa was crippled by torture.|$|E

500|$|The {{green and}} golden bell frog breeds in the warmer months from October to March, {{although}} some {{cases have been}} recorded earlier {{at the end of}} winter. Reproduction appears to be influenced by geography. More southerly and highland populations appear to have a shorter window for breeding than their more northerly and lowland counterparts. The latter appear commence breeding earlier and end later than the former group. During the breeding season, males call, usually while floating in the water, but sometimes on vegetation at the side of a pond, mainly at night. They do so with a deep growl that {{has been described as a}} four-part [...] "walk-walk sound"—likened to the sound of a motorbike changing gears. Males have been found to respond to recordings of the call, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> entire groups of males will then call in unison.

We now see the reason clearly: The symbol of double algebra denotes not a length and a direction; but a multiplier and an angle. In it the angles are confined to one plane. Hence the next stage will be a quadruple algebra, when the axis of the plane is made variable. And this gives the answer to the first question; double algebra is nothing but analytical plane trigonometry, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> it {{has been found to be}} the natural analysis for alternating currents.
