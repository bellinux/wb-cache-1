Removal of the cerebellum does not prevent an animal from doing <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> <b>particular,</b> but it makes actions hesitant and clumsy. This precision is not built-in, but learned by trial and error. The muscle coordination learned while riding a bicycle {{is an example of}} a type of neural plasticity that may take place largely within the cerebellum. 10% of the brain's total volume consists of the cerebellum and 50% of all neurons are held within its structure.|$|E

25|$|His drawing {{style was}} simple yet bold. It {{captured}} aspects of youth that were innocent and carefree. They reflected the wishful or nostalgic sentiment of the time. Martin excluded the non-essential details (extra people, structures, trees, scenery etc.), which allowed viewers {{to make an}} instant connection. His paintings were often easy to recognize, since their theme and style remained fairly consistent. They sometimes gave the illusion of three-dimensional depth. This was {{through the use of}} various techniques, such as overlapping, color intensity or variation and linear perspective. His cover art never corresponded to <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> <b>particular,</b> but rather had a holiday or seasonal theme or portrayed the magazine's overall image (common practice back then). Martin mostly hired local boys for the photo sessions. His drawings were made directly from those photos, and not real life (which required long sittings). This gave him more options and flexibly, as the final version was based on multiple photos taken during the shoot (along with some improvising). It was also a more practical process, due to active children being involved. He would interact with them, until getting the desired natural or candid expression. His wife assisted in preparing the models for their scenes. Collier's couldn't keep up with the rapidly changing times following WWII, and ceased publication in December 1956. The main culprit was television, which dramatically took away from its advertising and circulation revenue. Collier's top competitors (Life, Look and Post) adapted somewhat better to the changing times, which helped them hold out longer.|$|E

Van Morrison's exploration of spirituality is discussed in the book, including his experiences with mysticism, Christianity, and Dianetics. In the last chapter of the book, Turner comments on Van Morrison's experiences in religion, writing: [...] "His development of religion as a normal topic of discourse in popular song {{may turn out to}} be his most lasting contribution." ...|$|E

500|$|The poorly {{reviewed}} Canadian spoof [...] {{has been}} occasionally alluded to {{as a full}} parody of Kubrick's film, both because of its title and star Leslie Nielsen's many previous films which were full parodies of other films. However, Space Travesty only makes occasional references to Kubrick's material, its [...] "celebrities are really aliens" [...] jokes resembling those in Men in Black. Canadian reviewer Jim Slotek said, [...] "It's not really a spoof of 2001, or <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> <b>particular.</b> There's a brief homage at the start, and one scene in a shuttle {{en route to the}} Moon that uses The Blue Danube...The rest is a patched together plot." [...] Among many complaints about the film, reviewer Berge Garabedian derided the lack of much substantive connection to the Kubrick film (the latter of which he said was [...] "funnier").|$|E

2500|$|Tippit {{was born}} {{near the town}} of Annona in Red River County, Texas. He was one of seven {{children}} (two girls and five boys) to Edgar Lee, a farmer, and Lizzie Mae Tippit (née Rush). The Tippit and Rush families were of English ancestry, their ancestors having immigrated to Virginia from England by 1635. It is sometimes reported that J.D. stood for [...] "Jefferson Davis", but in fact, the letters did not stand for <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> <b>particular.</b> Tippit attended public schools through the tenth grade and was raised as a Baptist, a faith he practiced {{for the rest of his}} life. He entered the United States Army on July 21, 1944, and was assigned to the 513th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the US 17th Airborne Division. He saw combat in Operation Varsity, the airborne crossing of the Rhine River in March 1945, earning a Bronze Star, and remained on active duty until June 20, 1946.|$|E
2500|$|Non-causal {{accounts}} of incompatibilist free will {{do not require}} a free action {{to be caused by}} either an agent or a physical event. They either rely upon a world that is not causally closed, or physical indeterminism. Non-causal {{accounts of}}ten claim that each intentional action requires a choice or volition – a willing, trying, or endeavoring on behalf of the agent (such as the cognitive component of lifting one's arm). Such intentional actions are interpreted as free actions. It has been suggested, however, that such acting cannot be said to exercise control over <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> <b>particular.</b> According to non-causal accounts, the causation by the agent cannot be analysed in terms of causation by mental states or events, including desire, belief, intention of something in particular, but rather is considered a matter of spontaneity and creativity. The exercise of intent in such intentional actions is not that which determines their freedom – intentional actions are rather self-generating. The [...] "actish feel" [...] of some intentional actions do not [...] "constitute that event's activeness, or the agent's exercise of active control", rather they [...] "might be brought about by direct stimulation of someone's brain, {{in the absence of any}} relevant desire or intention on the part of that person". Another question raised by such non-causal theory, is how an agent acts upon reason, if the said intentional actions are spontaneous.|$|E

2500|$|Tying {{artificial}} flies {{has always}} been about imitating some form of fish prey. Significant literature on the concepts of imitation exists especially for trout flies. A Book of Trout Flies – Jennings (1935), Streamside Guide to Naturals & Their Imitations – Art Flick (1947), Matching the Hatch – Schweibert (1955), Selective Trout - Swisher and Richards (1971), Nymphs - Schweibert (1973), Caddisflies - LaFontaine (1989), Prey - Richards (1995) are a few 20th-century titles that deal extensively with imitating natural prey. From a human perspective, many fly patterns do not exactly imitate fish prey found in nature, but they are nevertheless successful. A successful or [...] "killing" [...] fly pattern imitates something that the target species preys on. This has resulted in fly tyers and fishers devising additional terms to characterize those flies that obviously do not imitate <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> <b>particular,</b> yet are nevertheless successful at catching fish. These additional terms are inconsistently but commonly associated with trout-fly patterns because of their huge variety, both historical and contemporary. The term Attractor pattern {{has been applied to}} flies which resemble nothing in particular but are successful in attracting strikes from fish (Trout Fishing, Brooks 1972). In Flies for Trout (1993) Dick Stewart characterizes these same patterns as General Purpose. Dave Hughes, in Trout Flies-The Tier’s Reference (1999), describes the same flies as Searching flies and characterizes three levels of imitation: Impressionistic, Suggestive and Imitative.|$|E

60|$|Besides which, I {{have been}} seeing Paris--wandering into hospitals, prisons, dead-houses, operas, theatres, concert-rooms, burial-grounds, palaces, and wine-shops. In my unoccupied {{fortnight}} of each month, every description of gaudy and ghastly sight has been passing before me in a rapid panorama. Before that, I had to come here from Switzerland, over frosty mountains in dense fogs, and through towns with walls and drawbridges, and without population, or <b>anything</b> else <b>in</b> <b>particular</b> but soldiers and mud. I took a flight to London for four days, and went and came back over one sheet of snow, sea excepted; and I wish that had been snow too. Then Forster (who is here now, and begs me to send his kindest regards) came to see Paris for himself, and in showing it to him, away I was borne again, like an enchanted rider. In short, I have had no rest in my play; and on Monday I am going to work again. A fortnight hence the play will begin once more; a fortnight after that the work will follow round, and so the letters that I care for go unwritten.|$|R

6000|$|But, {{far from}} doing or saying {{anything}} which could warrant such extremities, the pottingar, seeing himself so close upon his stalwart townsman that recognition was inevitable, seemed determined {{it should be}} as slight as possible; and without appearing to notice <b>anything</b> <b>particular</b> <b>in</b> the company or circumstances in which they met, he barely slid out these words as he passed him, without even a glance towards his companion after the first instant of their meeting: [...] "A merry holiday to you once more, stout smith.

A slip would do it sometimes--a single slip, and down {{you go through a}} crack, and only a bubble on the green water to show where it was that you sank. It's a queer thing," [...] he continued with a nervous laugh, [...] "but all the years I've been in this country I never once thought of making a will--not that I have <b>anything</b> to leave <b>in</b> <b>particular,</b> but still when a man is exposed to danger he should have everything arranged and ready--don't you think so?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Sitting thus dreamily, {{his face}} looked at its best, its {{expression}} of gentle thoughtfulness giving it an attraction beyond {{what it was}} entitled to, judged purely from a sculptor's point of view. It was an intellectual face, a face that gave signs of great mental possibilities, but for all that a little weak about the mouth. The brow indicated some degree of power, and the mouth and eyes no small capacities for affection {{and all sorts of}} human sympathy and kindness. These last, in varying lights, could change as often as the English climate; their groundwork, however, was blue, and they were honest and bonny. In short, a man in looking at Arthur Heigham at the age of twenty-four would have reflected that, even among English gentlemen, he was remarkable for his gentleman-like appearance, and a [...] "fellow one would like to know;" [...] a girl would have dubbed him [...] "nice-looking;" [...] and a middle-aged woman--and most women do not really understand the immense difference between men until they are getting on that way-- would have recognized in him a young man by no means uninteresting, and one who might, according to the circumstances of his life, develop into <b>anything</b> or--nothing <b>in</b> <b>particular.</b>|$|R
