40|$|In {{order to}} {{summarize}} a story {{it is necessary}} to access a high level analysis that highlights the story's central concepts. A technique of memory representation based on <b>affect</b> <b>units</b> appears to provide the necessary foundation for such an analysis. <b>Affect</b> <b>units</b> are conceptual structures that overlap with each other when a narrative is cohesive. When overlapping intersections are interpreted as arcs in a graph of <b>affect</b> <b>units,</b> the resulting graph encodes the plot of the story. Structural features of the graph then reveal which concepts are central to the story. <b>Affect</b> <b>unit</b> analysis is currently being investigated as a processing strategy for narrative summarization. When a reader summarizes a story, vast amounts of information in memory are selectively ignored in order to produce a distilled version of the original narrative. This process of simplification relies on a global structuring of memory that allows search procedures to concentrate on central elements of the story while ignoring peripheral details. It is apparent that some hierarchical structure is holding memory together, but the precise formulation of this structure is much more elusive. How is the hierarchical ordering of a memory representation constructed at the time of understanding? Exactly what elements of the memory representation are critical in building this structure? What search processes examine memory during summarization? How are summaries produced after memory has been accessed? In this paper we will outline a strategy for narrative summarization that addresses each of these issues. This proposed representation for high level narrative analysis relies on <b>affect</b> <b>units.</b> An <b>affect</b> <b>unit</b> is an abstract structure composed of three affect states and four affect links...|$|R

50|$|The {{electrical}} fault described above also <b>affected</b> <b>unit</b> 2 by causing breakers in the 230kv switchyard to trip cutting off power to RAT 2-B and vital bus B on unit 2. EDG 2-B subsequently started and restored {{power to the}} vital bus. At the same time, the electrical disturbance from the falling line striking the ground was detected by protective safeties on unit 2's main step-up transformer and a protective relay actuated and opened the transformer's output breaker causing a full load rejection to unit 2 {{which led to a}} turbine trip and reactor scram. After the unit tripped, the B non-vital electrical train lost power as it attempted to transfer from UAT 2-B (which is powered by the turbine generator) to the failed RAT 2-B causing two of the reactor coolant pumps and one of the main feedwater pumps to trip, though the plant cool down proceeded safely. At 9:03 p.m., the RAT 2-B breakers in the switchyard were reset and offsite power was restored to the vital and non-vital B electrical trains allowing reactor coolant pumps 2 and 4 to be restarted. EDG 2-B was shutdown. It was later determined that the fault disturbance caused by the line falling was not of significant magnitude to trip the protective relay per design and should not have caused unit 2 to shut down. Further investigation found that current transformers on the main transformer were improperly set. The controls were adjusted to the proper setting. Had the CTs been properly set initially, the unit would have remained online.|$|E

40|$|Because the {{automated}} clearinghouse (ACH) {{has been found}} to have lower social costs than paper checks, the Federal Reserve has been promoting more widespread use of ACH by lowering ACH processing fees. In this paper we have obtained the first numerical estimates of ACH demand elasticities, a measure of the responsiveness of ACH demand to price changes. In order to determine how robust the estimates are, various methods were employed to estimate the demand elasticities. Our results show that the volume of ACH items processed by the Federal Reserve does respond to changes in per-item fees. We find that demand for ACH credit is elastic, while demand for ACH debit is inelastic. The difference most likely arises from high customer resistance to automatic payment deduction and from low market penetration of that service among companies. Demand for origination was found to be somewhat more elastic than demand for receipt. We then examined how volume growth initiated by a price cut <b>affected</b> <b>unit</b> costs. Given the relatively large scale economies found for ACH, volume growth leads to lower unit costs. However, to outweigh revenue lost {{as a result of a}} price decline, ACH volume would have to increase by an amount greater than our estimates indicate is likely. Consequently, a decline in per-item ACH fees would likely lead to lower net revenues. Federal Reserve banks - Profits; Federal Reserve banks - Costs; Clearinghouses (Banking) ...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND : Klebsiella pneumoniae is an {{opportunistic}} pathogen {{often associated}} with nosocomial infections. A suspected outbreak of K. pneumoniae isolates, exhibiting reduced susceptibility to carbapenem antibiotics, was detected {{during the month of}} May 2012 among patients admitted to a haematology unit of a tertiary academic hospital in Cape Town, South Africa (SA). OBJECTIVES : An investigation was done to determine possible epidemiological links between the case patients and to describe the mechanisms of carbapenem resistance of these bacterial isolates. Methods. Relevant demographic, clinical and laboratory information was extracted from hospital records and an observational review of infection prevention and control practices in the <b>affected</b> <b>unit</b> was performed. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing including phenotypic testing and genotypic detection of the most commonly described carbapenemase genes was done. The phylogenetic relationship of all isolates containing the blaOXA- 181 carbapenemase gene was determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing. Results. Polymerase chain reaction analysis identified a total of seven blaOXA- 181 -positive, carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates obtained from seven patients, all from a single unit. These isolates were indistinguishable using PFGE analysis and belonged to sequence type ST- 14. No other carbapenemase enzymes were detected. CONCLUSION : This is the first documented laboratory-confirmed outbreak of OXA- 181 -producing K. pneumoniae in SA, and highlights the importance of enforcing strict adherence to infection control procedures and the need for ongoing surveillance of antibiotic-resistant pathogens in local hospitals.

In sum, 2, 776 subjects were enrolled and randomly divided into 3 groups receiving sealants on sound first molars: high-viscosity glass ionomer cement (GIC group); resin-based sealant with fluoride (fluoride-RB group); and a resin-based sealant without fluoride (RB group). Caries (D 1 – D 3 level) was recorded on the distal surface of the second primary molar, considered {{the unit of analysis}} including only sound surfaces at the baseline. At baseline, no differences in caries prevalence were recorded in the 3 groups regarding the considered surfaces. At follow-up, the prevalence of an <b>affected</b> <b>unit</b> of analysis was statistically lower (p =. 03) in the GIC and fluoride-RB groups (p =. 04).

40|$|Although it {{is clear}} that the {{accident}} signatures from each <b>affected</b> <b>unit</b> at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station [Daiichi] differ, much is not known about the end-state of core materials within these units. Some of this uncertainty can be attributed to a lack of information related to cooling system operation and cooling water injection. There is also uncertainty in our understanding of phenomena affecting: a) in-vessel core damage progression during severe accidents in boiling water reactors (BWRs), and b) accident progression after vessel failure (ex-vessel progression) for BWRs and Pressurized Water Reactors (PWRs). These uncertainties arise due to limited full scale prototypic data. Similar to what occurred after the accident at Three Mile Island Unit 2, these Daiichi units offer the international community a means to reduce such uncertainties by obtaining prototypic data from multiple full-scale BWR severe accidents. Information obtained from Daiichi is required to inform Decontamination and Decommissioning activities, improving the ability of the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) to characterize potential hazards and to ensure the safety of workers involved with cleanup activities. This paper reports initial results from the US Forensics Effort to utilize examination information obtained by TEPCO to enhance the safety of existing and future nuclear power plant designs. In this paper, three examples are presented in which examination information, such as visual images, dose surveys, sample evaluations, and muon tomography examinations, along with data from plant instrumentation, are used to obtain significant safety insights in the areas of component performance, fission product release and transport, debris end-state location, and combustible gas generation and transport. In addition to reducing uncertainties related to severe accident modeling progression, these insights confirm actions, such as the importance of water addition and containment venting, that are emphasized in updated guidance for severe accident prevention, mitigation, and emergency planning...|$|E
40|$|Rainbow trout {{gastroenteritis}} (RTGE) is {{an emerging}} disease of farmed rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) reported in Croatia, France, Italy, Spain and the UK. The impact of RTGE at the site-level varies, and daily mortalities of 0. 5 - 1 % are common. Gross lesions include severe enteritis with congestion and oedema, and the segmented filamentous bacterium "Candidatus arthromitus" {{has been suggested}} as a possible aetiological agent. This paper presents findings from a prospective longitudinal epidemiology study that took place from June to November 2006 in 12 RTGE-positive UK sites, examining the impact and presentation of the disease, spread pattern, risk factors for disease presence and severity and the efficacy of current control strategies. RTGE was present {{in a total of}} 164 production units across the 12 sites, representing 39 % of all stocked units. Fish losses due to RTGE totalled 61. 4 tonnes. The plotting of epidemic curves revealed a propagating epidemic pattern in 51 % affected units, suggesting RTGE is infectious. This was supported by risk analysis of fish transfers and site layouts, which revealed an increased risk of becoming RTGE positive after contiguity or fish transfer to and from a previously <b>affected</b> <b>unit.</b> Conditional multivariate logistic regression analysis identified eight variables significantly associated with the presence of RTGE. Seven variables were risk factors, including higher stocking densities, mortalities due to predation or handling, higher water temperature, higher daily feed input and contiguity or fish movement to and from a previous case. One variable was protective: the absence of an aeration system in a unit. General linear modelling identified a significant association of mean feed input per fish during an outbreak with RTGE cumulative mortality. Finally, great variability was observed with regards to the control strategies targeted to RTGE in these sites, suggesting an absence of a common strategy. In feed NaCl treatments apparently presented a palliative effect if given to affected fish during the clinical outbreaks, but they did not prevent recurrence...|$|E
40|$|The flow of Ca ions through single Ca {{channels}} {{has been}} examined. The gigaseal method was used on identifiable snail neurons that were voltage clamped using a two-microelectrode voltage clamp method. Average Ca patch currents and whole cell currents have similar time courses. They are affected similarly {{by changes in}} temperature. The differences in amplitude and inactivation between Ba and Ca whole cell currents {{were present in the}} patch records. The stationary noise spectra recorded from ensembles of multichannel patches have two components with fast and slow time constants equivalent to two components in the whole cell tail current relaxations. Elementary current amplitudes measured from the variance-mean relationship and from noise spectra gave values comparable to measurements from single channels. The single channel I-V relationship was curvilinear and the maximum slope conductance in 40 mM Cao was 7 pS. The amplitude of unitary currents was unchanged at long times when inactivation had occurred; hence depletion is not involved in this process. Channel density was approximately 3 microns- 2 and was the same for Ba and Ca currents. The whole cell asymmetry currents gave very large values for the gating charge per channel. Changes in temperature from 29 to 9 degrees C had only a slight effect on the two Ca tail current tau's at potentials where turn-on of patch and whole cell currents was markedly slowed and the peak amplitudes were reduced by one-third. Single channel recordings were obtained at these two temperatures, and the mean open time and the fast component of the closed times were scarcely <b>affected.</b> <b>Unit</b> amplitudes were reduced by 30 % and the slow closed time component was doubled. Therefore, peak currents and the slow closed time component was doubled. Therefore, peak currents were reduced {{partly as a result of}} the reduction in unit amplitude, but mainly as a result of a reduction in opening probability, the latter arising from an increase of the long closed times. It is concluded that the behavior of single Ca channels in membrane patches is the same as it is in whole cells.

40|$|Sorry, {{the full}} text of this article is not {{available}} in Huskie Commons. Please click on the alternative location to access it. 273 p. The Acid Rain Program under Title IV of the Clean Air Act Amendment of 1990 created a market for emission allowances of sulfur dioxide (SO 2). This program is based on economic incentives that give plant managers the opportunity to choose {{the most efficient way to}} comply with the requirements of the program. Plant operators can secure future emission allowances by reducing emissions or gain profits by selling them at the market. This program, the first nationwide application of the market-based approach, has achieved a 40 % reduction of SO 2 emissions below their 1980 level, which is widely considered to be a triumph of the market-based approach over the command-and-control approach. The literature emphasizes the economic logic of deregulation. However, the statute explicitly allows the state regulatory authorities to retain their regulatory powers, and the new source performance standards are still applied. These noneconomic aspects of the Acid Rain Program have been virtually ignored by the literature. Using multiple regression methods, this study estimates how economic and noneconomic variables contribute to the emission reductions under the program, measured as SO 2 emissions per heat input of each <b>affected</b> <b>unit.</b> The economic variables influencing the emissions rates include the existence of an SO 2 control device, fuel type, boiler size, and the availability of low-sulfur coal. Noneconomic influences are grouped into several categories such as state policy, regulation, state policy strength, government institution, interest groups and the public, and power company response. As the literature suggests, this study found that economic variables have considerable influence on the level of sulfur emissions. However, this study found considerable evidence that noneconomic factors have roles in this economic incentive-based program. The greatest noneconomic issue is regulation, particularly permit regulations limiting sulfur content in fuel. In addition, this sulfur content regulation is largely influenced by the coal production of the state. Coal interests were one of the forces that created scrubbing requirements under the 1977 Clean Air Act amendments. This study has found that the same coal politics is still affecting the effectiveness of market forces in the Acid Rain Program...|$|E
40|$|Bibliography: pages 86 - 88. The use of shunt {{capacitor}} bank equipment is essential if a utility wishes {{to control the}} flow of reactive power effectively. The most significant results stemming from this will be lower losses on the system and an increased power transfer capability. Thus {{it is important that}} the methods used to protect a {{shunt capacitor}} bank will ensure that the bank is available when required. While the more common shunt capacitor problems are related to capacitor unit failures, conditions such as bank over currents, surge voltages and harmonics can cause extended undesired conditions. Today's protection methods are able to remove a shunt capacitor bank from service before extensive damage is done, although the location of the faulty capacitor units will not be known (if this was in fact the reason for the protection tripping the bank). This thesis explores the subject of improving the protection of high-voltage shunt capacitor banks, specifically with respect to the detection of unhealthy fuseless capacitor units. An extensive literature search was carried out on the theory pertaining to the protection of shunt capacitor banks, and a model of a fuse less shunt capacitor bank was built in the laboratory to better understand the failing process of an element within a capacitor unit. The changes in the capacitor unit's current and voltage profiles, as well as those of the remaining healthy capacitor units, were monitored as an element failure was simulated (whereby the element forms a solid weld, or short circuit). Stemming from these experiments, it was found that where a bank consists of strings of units with no interconnection between the units of different strings, an element failure in a capacitor unit would cause a significant decrease in voltage across the <b>affected</b> <b>unit.</b> This voltage change could be used to identify when elements are failing in capacitor units, and the location of the unhealthy unit could also be determined. One potential method would be to have capacitor units with built-in voltage transformers attached across each element section in the unit. As element failures occur either send this information to ground level, where it can be read by a microprocessor relay device, or have a display on the outside of the capacitor unit. In the case of the change in unit current, it was found to be very small and thus had no function for detecting unhealthy capacitor units...|$|E
