5|$|An {{indication}} of the army's high esteem for barbarian-born troops is that {{they appear to have}} been preferentially recruited to the elite units of the late imperial era's armies.

From the late 3rd century onwards, barbarian recruitment became crucial to the army's continued existence, by providing a much-needed source of first-rate recruits.|$|E
