2500|$|A Buffalo wing, hot wing or wing is {{a chicken}} wing section (drumette or flat) that is {{traditionally}} fried unbreaded and then coated in sauce. Classic Buffalo-style chicken wing sauce {{is composed of}} a vinegar-based cayenne pepper hot sauce and butter. They are traditionally served with celery sticks and blue cheese dressing. Buffalo wings get their name from where they were invented, at the <b>Anchor</b> <b>Bar</b> in Buffalo, New York. In 1964, Teresa Bellissimo at the family-owned <b>Anchor</b> <b>Bar,</b> covered [...] chicken wings in her own special sauce and served them with a side of blue cheese and celery. In 1980, Frank Bellissimo, the husband of Teresa, told The New Yorker that her buffalo wings were invented out of necessity because the restaurant had gotten an overstock of chicken wings instead of other chicken parts that the couple didn't {{know what to do}} with. On the other hand, Dominic Bellissimo, the son of Frank and Teresa, disputed this story. Dominic claimed that the wings were an impromptu midnight snack that his mother created on his request while drinking with friends. Whatever the story, all of the Bellissimos have since died as {{there is no way to}} verify how buffalo wings were invented.|$|E
2500|$|The Buffalo area's varied cuisine is {{the result}} of variety of {{cultural}} contributions, including Italian, Irish, Jewish, German, Polish, African-American, Greek, and American influences. In 2015, the National Geographic Society ranked Buffalo third on their list of [...] "The World's Top Ten Food Cities".

Buffalo's local pizzerias differ from that of the thin-crust New York-style pizzerias and deep-dish Chicago-style pizzerias, and is locally known for being a midpoint between the two. The Beef on weck sandwich, kielbasa, sponge candy, pastry hearts, pierogi and haddock fish fries are local favorites, as is a loganberry-flavored beverage that remains relatively obscure outside of Western New York and Southern Ontario.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, the {{experimental}} results of pull-out tests on anchorages are presented. The experiments {{allow for the}} evaluation of bar-to-concrete slip and splitting crack openings at several points along the <b>anchored</b> <b>bar.</b> Particular attention is devoted to the confining contribution of both transverse reinforcement and concrete cover. Two series of tests have been performed: in the first series, the influence of the confining contribution of transverse bars is studied, while in the second series the confining contribution of the concrete cover is analyzed. In specimens from the first series without transverse reinforcement, a splitting collapse of the anchorage occurred {{at the onset of the}} slip at the unloaded end of the <b>anchored</b> <b>bar.</b> The opposite was true for all the other specimens, as the transverse reinforcement percentage was such that a pull-out failure of the anchorage occurred. As the stirrup index of confinement Ω rose, the resultant ultimate bond stress value τ̄ increased; however, beyond the value Ωmax ≈ 0. 05, there was no further significant increase of bond strength.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{simulation}} of the dynamic nonlinear behaviour of seabed anchored submerged floating tunnels (SFTs) under environmental excitation, by addressing the problem of vortex induced excitation. A model based on the ‘fluid oscillator’ approach is proposed, tailored to be coupled to a geometrically non linear FE developed, for the <b>anchor</b> <b>bars,</b> in a previous work. The approach allows for representing the entire <b>anchoring</b> <b>bar,</b> thus reducing the computational effort required for global modelling of the SFT. In this light, mainly based on a lumped fluid oscillator model, a computationally more efficient approach is here sought {{in the form of}} a continuous model (Distributed Vortex Layer - DVL). This consists of a distributed ‘aerodynamic’ mass which is connected to the structural element and to a fixed reference system by distributed non linear spring-dashpot elements. Governing equations of motion are obtained substituting Galerkin-type decomposition of both the structure and the aerodynamic mass displacements; global equations of motion are integrated by a step-by-step procedure based on the Newmark method.

40|$|The dynamic {{behavior}} of Submerged Floating Tunnels (SFTs or Archimedes Bridges) has caught {{the interest of}} this research group, in the past decade, with reference to different sources of excitation, namely earthquakes, sea waves and currents. Both structural and excitation models {{have been developed to}} the aim of capturing the essential features of the dynamic {{behavior of}} the SFTs under complex excitation mechanisms, i. e. 3 D multiple-support seismic excitation or vortex induced vibration. With reference to seismic actions, special attention has been devoted, in recent times, to some aspects of structural and excitation models; first of all, it had been noted, in previous studies, that <b>anchoring</b> <b>bars</b> which are normally located at the tunnel ends usually undergo large stress concentration due to the oscillations of the tunnel in the transversal plane. These stresses can largely exceed the yield value: this aspect, if properly controlled, can be regarded as an option for dissipating part of the energy transferred to the structure by the seismic motion. In this light, inelastic behavior of the anchoring elements, which are slender bars with hollow section in the proposed design approach, has been recently introduced in the dynamical modeling of the SFT, allowing for a detailed study of the inelastic deformations imposed by extreme seismic actions. As a second improvement in the modeling approach, the hydrodynamic pressure due to the water-transmitted seismic vibration from the seabed (named as seaquake) is introduced in addition to the to the motion of the structural supports. The hydrodynamic excitation is derived from the velocity potential deduced from wave equation. Morison equation is then adopted to simulate the seaquake force on the moving tunnel body. The first results show how the seaquake mechanism can lead to {{a significant increase in the}} internal forces both in the tunnel and in the <b>anchor</b> <b>bars,</b> the effectiveness of the control system in the mitigation of dangerous structural responses and highlight the need of further investigations...|$|R
