40|$|An {{object-oriented}} {{computational framework}} for the transformation of <b>colour</b> <b>data</b> and <b>colour</b> metric tensors is presented. The main idea of the design is to represent the transforms between spaces as compositions of objects from a class hierarchy providing the methods for both the transforms themselves and the corresponding Jacobian matrices. In this way, new colour spaces can be implemented on the fly by transforming from any existing colour space, and <b>colour</b> <b>data</b> in various formats as well as colour metric tensors and <b>colour</b> difference <b>data</b> can easily be transformed between the colour spaces. This reduces what normally requires several days of coding to a few lines of code without introducing a significant computational overhead. The framework is implemented in the Python programming language...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} I discuss ongoing {{research}} into the relationship of digital <b>colour</b> to <b>analogue</b> <b>colour,</b> through the physical and perceptual experience of making paintings. How can printed computer colour match the output of painting with pigments? How can digital colour work in relation to <b>analogue</b> <b>colour</b> within the same picture? The paper refers to the study I have made of ‘simulated’ and actual paint-colour, where the paint is applied directly to digitally printed canvas. The study includes the referencing of the perceptual behaviour and material characteristics of each, as they are combined and contrasted in the same pictorial format. The paper also refers to Chromafile, a software program I have co- designed with Dr Ferdy Carabott. It is a simulated paint-colour palette I use {{in the creation of}} painted, screen-printed and digitally printed pictures. Chromafile relates virtual with material by providing a common colour language for the painted and printed images. The project is to apply theoretical and computer-based research to creative, material-practice. The tension and dynamic in the research process is between the technical, ‘scientific’ model used for the Chromafile project, and my customary, singular and personal approach to painting aimed at action and expression, the immediate sensory experience that goes beyond knowledge and ideas. I have established a new working method of involving the two technologies in the production of new bodies of work. In the broad development of a ‘Beyond Digital’ project, which includes software and material artefacts, the practical solutions and experimental data have relevance wherever there is an established or potential use of digital printing or where varied printed substrates are part of the output. This research has subsequently been developed (04 - 07) to VIRTUAL and MATERIAL: an ongoing project which explores the relationship between designs, digital printing, (via the Chromafile programme), and fabric manipulation...|$|R

40|$|Ocean colour {{is defined}} as the water hue due to the {{presence}} of tiny plants containing the pigment chlorophyll, sediments and coloured dissolved organic material and so water colour can provide valuable information on coastal ecosystems. The ‘Ocean <b>Colour</b> project’ collects <b>data</b> from various satellites (e. g. MERIS, MODIS) and makes this data available online. One method of searching the Ocean <b>Colour</b> project <b>data</b> is to visually browse level 1 and level 2 data. Users can search via location (regions), time and data type. They are presented with images which cover chlorophyll, quasi-true colour and sea surface temperature (11 μ) and links to the source data. However it is often preferable for users to search such a complex and large dataset by event and analyse the distribution of colour in an image before examination of the source data. This will allow users to browse and search ocean <b>colour</b> <b>data</b> more efficiently and to include this information more seamlessly into a framework that incorporates sensor information from a variety of modalities. This paper presents a system for more efficient management and analysis of ocean <b>colour</b> <b>data</b> and suggests how this information can be incorporated into a multi-modal sensing framework for a smarter, more adaptive environmental sensor network...|$|R

Introduction The work presented here is part of a longer-term investigation into techniques for tracking country roads and lanes in sequences of images to assist the navigation of cross country autonomous land vehicles. There are several sources of information that might be useful in constructing a system to perform this task. Grey-level pixel data can be used to provide some degree of discrimination between different regions in an image and many segmentation and tracking techniques are based on the examination of grey-level data, e. g., [1, 2]. However, the extra dimensionality in <b>colour</b> <b>data</b> [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The Four Legged League is a {{division}} of the RoboCup initiative that uses Sony AIBO robots to further robotics research. Most participants implement vision systems that use the colour of objects to perform identification. Calibration of the colour classification system must be done manually and any changes to the lighting of the environment after calibration reduces the accuracy of the system, often to a point at which the robot is effectively blind. This study investigates the relationships in the <b>colour</b> <b>data</b> of image pixels between different lighting conditions in an effort to identify trends that can be used as the basis of a rule-based system. The aim of the system is to identify the current lighting level as one of a set of known conditions. The proposed system uses the <b>colour</b> <b>data</b> of image pixels and information about the AIBO's location and orientation to identify lighting levels, allowing a vision system to switch to an appropriate pre-cofigured calibration...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} spatio-temporal trends for key water quality {{parameters}} in the Maltese coastal waters is hindered {{by the lack}} of systematic observations spanning over the full domain and for sufficiently long time periods. Satellite data offer an alternative source of information, but require ground truthing against in situ measurements. The aim {{of this study is to}} attempt the statistical comparison of MODIS ocean <b>colour</b> <b>data,</b> for a near-shore marine area off the north-east coastline of Malta, with in situ surface chlorophyll-a measurements, and to extract a twelve-month ocean <b>colour</b> <b>data</b> series for the same marine area. Peaks in surface chlorophyll-a concentration occurred in the January-February period, with lowest values being recorded during the early spring period. Log bias values indicate that the MODIS dataset under-estimates the surface chlorophyll-a values, whilst RMSD and r 2 values suggest that the match-up between satellite and in situ values is only partly consistent.
