5|$|About 20,000 protein coding genes <b>are</b> <b>expressed</b> {{in human}} cells and 70% of these genes <b>are</b> <b>expressed</b> {{in the normal}} thyroid. Some 250 of these genes are more {{specifically}} expressed in the thyroid with about 20 genes being highly thyroid specific. The corresponding specific proteins are mainly involved in thyroid hormone synthesis, such as thyroglobulin, TPO and IYD, and expressed in follicular cells. Other proteins elevated in the thyroid are calcitonin related proteins such as CALCA and CALCB, expressed in the parafollicular c-cells.|$|E
5|$|About 20,000 protein-coding genes <b>are</b> <b>expressed</b> {{in human}} cells and nearly 70% of these genes <b>are</b> <b>expressed</b> {{in the normal}} esophagus. Some 250 of these genes are more {{specifically}} expressed in the esophagus with less than 50 genes being highly specific. The corresponding esophagus-specific proteins are mainly involved in squamous differentiation such as keratins KRT13, KRT4 and KRT6C. Other specific proteins that help lubricate the inner surface of esophagus are mucins such as MUC21 and MUC22. Many genes with elevated expression are also shared with skin and other organs that are composed of squamous epithelia.|$|E

These volumes <b>are</b> <b>expressed</b> using a metric called annual average daily traffic, which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway. MDOT's surveys in 2010 showed that the traffic levels along Conn. M-13 were 13,939vehicles daily south of the Wilder Road and 7,031vehicles per day north of that interchange. The only section of the freeway that has been listed on the National Highway System (NHS) is from the southern terminus to the Wilder Road interchange. The NHS is a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E
5|$|Genes are {{regulated}} {{so that they}} <b>are</b> <b>expressed</b> only when the product is needed, since expression draws on limited resources. A cell regulates its gene expression depending on its external environment (e.g. available nutrients, temperature and other stresses), its internal environment (e.g. cell division cycle, metabolism, infection status), and its specific role if in a multicellular organism. Gene expression can be regulated at any step: from transcriptional initiation, to RNA processing, to post-translational modification of the protein. The regulation of lactose metabolism genes in E. coli (lac operon) was the first such mechanism to be described in 1961.|$|E

5|$|In bioinformatics, microarrays {{are used}} to measure how {{strongly}} different genes <b>are</b> <b>expressed</b> {{in a sample of}} biological material. Different rates of expression of a gene are often compared by using the binary logarithm of the ratio of expression rates: the log ratio of two expression rates is defined as the binary logarithm of the ratio of the two rates. Binary logarithms allow for a convenient comparison of expression rates: a doubled expression rate can be described by a log ratio of , a halved expression rate can be described by a log ratio of , and an unchanged expression rate can be described by a log ratio of zero, for instance.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to cellular stresses– such as infection, heat shock, or oxidative damage– heat shock proteins that identify misfolded or unfolded proteins and target them for proteasomal degradation <b>are</b> <b>expressed.</b> Both Hsp27 and Hsp90—chaperone proteins have {{been implicated in}} increasing {{the activity of the}} ubiquitin-proteasome system, though they are not direct participants in the process. Hsp70, on the other hand, binds exposed hydrophobic patches on the surface of misfolded proteins and recruits E3 ubiquitin ligases such as CHIP to tag the proteins for proteasomal degradation. The CHIP protein (carboxyl terminus of Hsp70-interacting protein) is itself regulated via inhibition of interactions between the E3 enzyme CHIP and its E2 binding partner.|$|E
