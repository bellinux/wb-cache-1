40|$|This paper {{argues that}} Epicene, Jonson's first public play after being made {{official}} court masque writer, is unusually optimistic <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> <b>of</b> drama. <b>The</b> play explores <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> creating an authentic personality through performance, {{an idea that}} Jonson is often hostile towards.

For complex reasons, Lady Arbella's complaint <b>about</b> <b>the</b> play led Jonson to once again grow cynical <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> public stage. These vacillating perspectives, I argue, can be traced within the two different prologues, which offer two very different perspectives on playing, play going and the theater...|$|R
