5|$|In the Rights of Woman, Wollstonecraft {{does not}} make the claim for gender {{equality}} using the same arguments or the same language that late 19th- and 20th century feminists later would. For instance, rather than unequivocally stating that men <b>and</b> <b>women</b> are equal, Wollstonecraft contends that men <b>and</b> <b>women</b> are equal in the eyes of God, which means that they are both subject to the same moral law. For Wollstonecraft, men <b>and</b> <b>women</b> are equal in the most important areas of life. While such an idea may not seem revolutionary to 21st-century readers, its implications were revolutionary during the 18th century. For example, it implied that both men and women—not just women—should be modest and respect the sanctity of marriage. Wollstonecraft's argument exposed the sexual double standard of the late 18th century and demanded that men adhere to the same virtues demanded of women.|$|E
