5|$|Electronic {{speckle pattern}} {{interferometry}} (ESPI), {{also known as}} TV holography, uses video detection and recording to produce <b>an</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> object upon which is superimposed a fringe pattern which represents the displacement of the object between recordings. (see Fig.21) The fringes {{are similar to those}} obtained in holographic interferometry.|$|E
30|$|The 24 % {{missing values}} in the {{radiological}} evaluation was due to {{a difference in the}} follow-up protocol for the trauma and orthopaedic surgeons. <b>A</b> lateral <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hindfoot was made in all cases; <b>an</b> anteroposterior <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ankle was made by the orthopaedic surgeons and <b>an</b> axial <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> calcaneus by the trauma surgeons only.|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> {{main goal}} <b>of</b> {{this project is}} to present my {{investigation}} <b>of</b> finite <b>images</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> progenitor 2 ^(*n) : N for various N and several values of n. We construct each image by using <b>the</b> technique <b>of</b> double coset enumeration and give a proof <b>of</b> <b>the</b> isomorphism type <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>image.</b> We obtain the group 7 ^ 2 : D_ 6 as <b>a</b> homomorphic <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> progenitor 2 ^(* 14) : D_ 14, we obtain the group 2 ^ 4 : (5 : 4) as <b>a</b> homomorphic <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> progenitor 2 ^(* 5) : (5 : 4), we obtain the group (10 x 10) : ((3 x 4) : 2) as <b>a</b> homomorphic <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> progenitor 2 ^(* 15) : (15 x 4), we obtain the group PGL(2; 7) as <b>a</b> homomorphic <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> progenitor 2 ^ 7 : D_ 14, we obtain the group S_ 6 as <b>a</b> homomorphic <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> progenitor 2 ^ 5 : (5 : 4), and we obtain the group S_ 7 as <b>a</b> homomorphic <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> progenitor 2 ^(* 15) : (15 : 4).

5|$|In 1850 and in 1862, Léon Foucault made {{improved}} determinations of {{the speed}} of light substituting a rotating mirror for Fizeau's toothed wheel. (Figure2) The apparatus involves light from slit S reflecting off a rotating mirror R, forming <b>an</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slit on the distant stationary mirror M, which is then reflected back to reform <b>an</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original slit. If mirror R is stationary, then the slit image will reform at S regardless of the mirror's tilt. The situation is different, however, if R is in rapid rotation.|$|E

5|$|A {{group of}} friends browse the {{internet}} for pornography, finding a live stream of a woman bound to a chair. Behind her a number is painted on the wall; when the feed's web counter reaches the painted number, a masked man appears and cuts the girl's throat.

5|$|After {{being told}} {{by a panel of}} Senators that Fringe Division is not worth the human or fiscal cost, Broyles is given the {{transformation}} device by Peter so Broyles can justify Fringe Division remaining active. In a separate scene, Agent Jessup is shown working at a computer, annotating <b>an</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> creature from The Transformation with biblical verses, notably from the Book of Revelation. The final scene reveals that Charlie is actually the shapeshifter, who disposes of the real agent's body in a furnace beneath the hospital.|$|E
5|$|Anderton {{goes to a}} {{black market}} doctor for a risky eye {{transplant}} {{so as to avoid}} the citywide optical recognition system. He returns to PreCrime and kidnaps Agatha, shutting down the system, as the Precogs operate as a group mind. Anderton takes Agatha to a hacker to extract the minority report of Leo Crow, but none exists; instead, Agatha shows him <b>an</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> murder of Ann Lively, a woman who was drowned by a hooded figure in 2049.|$|E

During his 2000 presidential campaign, Gore ran, in part, on a pledge to ratify the Kyoto Protocol.|$|E
5|$|Leaders' ideological {{power was}} based on {{apparent}} access to deities and the supernatural. Evidence regarding Norte Chico religion is limited: <b>an</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Staff God, a leering figure with a hood and fangs, has been found on a gourd dated to 2250 BC. The Staff God is a major deity of later Andean cultures, and Winifred Creamer suggests the find points to worship of common symbols of gods. As with much other research at Norte Chico, the nature and significance of the find has been disputed by other researchers.|$|E

5|$|One {{shoulder}} of the ring displays <b>an</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Administration Building, with the bells which represent victory. The other shoulder contains the university seal: an American eagle perched above a book, representing the church; a star, representing the State of Texas; a key, representing home; and, a lamp, representing knowledge. These elements are separated by a cross featuring ten cotton bolls, one each for Lubbock and its nine surrounding cotton-producing counties.|$|E
5|$|Several astronomers, {{including}} Alan Hale, {{claimed the}} object was simply an 8.5-magnitude star, SAO141894, which did not appear on Shramek's computer program because the user preferences were set incorrectly. Later, Art Bell even claimed to have obtained <b>an</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> object from an anonymous astrophysicist {{who was about to}} confirm its discovery. However, astronomers Olivier Hainaut and David J. Tholen of the University of Hawaii stated that the alleged photo was an altered copy of one of their own comet images.|$|E
5|$|Starting in {{the summer}} of 1942 the TRE {{development}} team began experimenting with systems to project the display onto the windscreen, and by October had combined this with <b>an</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> existing GGS Mk.

A single example was fitted to a Beaufighter and tested through October, and numerous modifications and follow-on examples were trialled over the next year.|$|E

The picture caption also referred to the protest as in keeping with avant-garde tradition, mentioning the Salon des Refusés of 1863 and the Ashcan School.|$|E
5|$|A legend links Szczerbiec with King Bolesław I the Brave who {{was said}} to have chipped the sword by hitting it against the Golden Gate, Kiev (now in Ukraine) during his {{intervention}} in the Kievan succession crisis in 1018. However, the Golden Gate was only constructed in 1037 and the sword is actually dated to the late 12th or 13th century. It was first used as a coronation sword by Władysław I the Elbow-high in 1320. Looted by Prussian troops in 1795, it changed hands several times during the 19th century until it was purchased in 1884 for the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg, Russia. The Soviet Union returned it to Poland in 1928. During World War II, Szczerbiec was evacuated to Canada and did not return to Kraków until 1959. In the 20th century, <b>an</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sword was adopted as a symbol by Polish nationalist and far-right movements.|$|E
5|$|After 1805, the {{exploits}} of 40,000French, Russian, and Austrian soldiers excited the European imagination. General Schmitt's grave has never been found, but in 1811 a monument for him was erected at the Stein Tor, the gate leading from the old village of Krems to the hamlet of Stein. The house in which Captain von Stiebar lived was marked with a bronze plate commemorating his contribution to the battle. In 1840, a Spanish lithographer created <b>an</b> <b>image</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> battle, which was later expanded by English lithographer John Outhwaite. The image depicts the evacuation of French troops via the Danube flotilla (see Infobox image) on a moonlit night. In fact, the moon was in its last quarter phase 48hours later, and on 11 November probably did not provide as much light as depicted in the image.|$|E
