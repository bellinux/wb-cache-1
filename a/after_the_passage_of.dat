On September 27, about a week <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> the storm, the Emergency Measures Organization began accepting applications for flood-related damage.

5|$|Twenty-fourhours <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> the hurricane, {{workers had}} {{restored}} power to 70% {{of the affected}} residents in Sinaloa, and by six days after the storm, electrical service was completely restored.

The rehabilitation of the agricultural infrastructure began immediately, {{and most of the}} drainage networks were repaired by about two weeks after the hurricane. About half of the damaged railways were repaired by about a month after the storm. The total cost for reconstruction and aid amounted to about $18.5million (1998USD, 175million 1998MXN, $23.3million 2007USD), about 94% from federal funds and the rest from state funding.

The disaster declaration allocated the use of federal funds for rebuilding and providing aid in the aftermath of hurricane Isabel. By about four months <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> the hurricane, disaster aid totaled about $516million (2003USD, $ USD), primarily in North Carolina and Virginia. Over 166,000 residents applied for individual assistance, with about $117million (2003USD, $ USD) approved for residents to assist with temporary housing and home repairs. About 50,000business owners applied for Small Business Administration loans, with about $178million (2003USD, $ USD) approved for the assistance loans. About 40,000people visited local disaster recovery centers, designed to provide additional information regarding the aftermath of the hurricane.|$|E
