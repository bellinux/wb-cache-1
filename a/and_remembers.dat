The police arrive and arrest both women: Lindsay is jailed in Pawnee, while Leslie is jailed in Eagleton's pristine and hotel-like holding cell. After Ann bails Leslie out, she tells her that Lindsay built the fence because she is jealous that Leslie was offered the Eagleton job first and wants to get a rise out of her. Ann suggests that Lindsay should be hit with a baseball bat, which gives Leslie the idea to turn Pawnee's side of Lafayette Park into a wiffle ball field, with the fence serving as the outfield wall.

40|$|Recent {{functional}} neuroimaging {{evidence suggests}} a bottleneck between learning new information <b>and</b> <b>remembering</b> old information. In two behavioral experiments and one functional MRI (fMRI) experiment, {{we tested the}} hypothesis that learning <b>and</b> <b>remembering</b> compete when both processes happen within {{a brief period of}} time. In the first behavioral experiment, participants intentionally remembered old words displayed in the foreground, while incidentally learning new scenes displayed in the background. In line with a memory competition, we found that remembering old information was associated with impaired learning of new information. We replicated this finding in a subsequent fMRI experiment, which showed that this behavioral effect was coupled with a suppression of learningrelated activity in visual and medial temporal areas. Moreover, the fMRI experiment provided evidence that left midventrolateral prefrontal cortex is involved in resolving the memory competition, possibly by facilitating rapid switching between learning <b>and</b> <b>remembering.</b> Critically, a follow-up behavioral experiment in which the background scenes were replaced with a visual target detection task provided indications that the competition between learning <b>and</b> <b>remembering</b> was not merely due to attention. This study not only provides novel insight into our capacity to learn <b>and</b> <b>remember,</b> but also clarifies the neural mechanisms underlying flexible behavior...|$|R
