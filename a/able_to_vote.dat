5|$|Citizen's Briefing Book is a {{compilation}} book of recommendations made to President Barack Obama by {{visitors to the}} Change.gov website, given to the President after his January 20, 2009 inauguration. Internet users were able to post recommendations of changes {{they would like to}} see made in the United States, and they were also <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> on other users' recommendations, as well as participate in a comment process.|$|E
5|$|On July 9, it was {{announced}} that Hungarian fans had until July 27, to choose their songs from an extensive pool of 122 tracks, in a two-stage process. The pool list contained almost every song Jackson has released in his solo career. Notably expansions on the pool choice included: A larger option of tracks from Thriller 25 and the inclusion of 12 tracks from The Ultimate Collection (these are not available in the Australian or New Zealand version). In the first round (July 9 - July 15) the fans were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> for their top 50 tracks. In round two (July 16 - July 27) the 50 were cut down to the album track list.|$|E
5|$|One {{major issue}} is the West Lothian question, in which MPs from Scotland and Wales are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> on {{legislation}} affecting only England, while English MPs have no equivalent right to legislate on devolved matters. This when placed {{in the context of}} England being the only country of the United Kingdom not to have free cancer treatment, prescriptions, residential care for the elderly and free top-up university fees, has led to a steady rise in English nationalism. Some have suggested the creation of a devolved English parliament, while others have proposed simply limiting voting on legislation which only affects England to English MPs.|$|E

50|$|Individuals must be {{registered}} <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> by midnight twelve working days before polling day. Anyone who qualifies as an anonymous elector has until midnight six working days before polling day to register. A {{person who has}} two homes (such as a university student who has a term-time address and lives at home during holidays) may be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> register <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> at both addresses {{as long as they}} are not in the same electoral area, but can only vote in one constituency at the general election.|$|R
5000|$|The New Zealand Constitution Act 1852 {{set out the}} {{requirements}} for enfranchisement. Prisoners were expressly excluded from registration for voting where they were serving a sentence for [...] "any treason, felony, or infamous offence". Prisoners who had completed their sentence were eligible <b>to</b> <b>vote.</b> In 1879, prisoners were further disenfranchised by the Qualification of Electors Act. This Act provided that prisoners who had completed their punishments were not <b>able</b> <b>to</b> register <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> again until 12 months had passed {{since the end of}} their sentence.|$|R
5|$|The {{second section}} of the Fourteenth Amendment punished, by reduced {{representation}} in the House of Representatives, any states that disenfranchised any male citizens over 21 years of age. By failing to adopt a harsher penalty, this signaled to the states that they still possessed the right to deny ballot access to blacks. Northern states were generally as averse to granting voting rights to blacks as Southern states. In the year of its ratification, only eight Northern states allowed blacks to vote. In the South, blacks were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> in many areas, but only through {{the intervention of the}} occupying Union Army. Congress had granted suffrage to the blacks in the territories in 1867 by passing the Territorial Suffrage Act.|$|E
5|$|With the fissure, the Congressional Union began a {{reorganization}} to {{push for}} campaigns against Democratic candidates because they had not supported suffrage {{while they were in}} control of the legislature. Paul established an all-woman advisory council of suffrage workers and prominent women which included Bertha Fowler, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Helen Keller, Belle Case La Follette, May Wright Sewall and educators such as Emma Gillett, Maria Montessori, and Clara Louise Thompson, a Latin Professor at Rockford College, among others, to lend credibility to the new organization. Stevens became the national organizer, charged with organizing women in states in which they were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> to use their ballots and oppose any candidate not in favor of full enfranchisement of women. One of the first places Stevens traveled to was Colorado, where CUWS was successful in attaining commitment from one congressman to support the women's cause. Returning from that success in January 1915, she went to New York City and Newport, Rhode Island to campaign before heading west. She campaigned in Kansas, hoping to secure delegates for a convention planned in San Francisco for September.|$|E
5|$|During the match, UEFA.com {{users were}} <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> for their {{man of the}} match; the public vote went to the scorer of Barcelona's second goal, Lionel Messi. The UEFA Technical Study Group, however, chose the man who {{provided}} the cross for Messi's goal, Xavi, as their man of the match, citing his control of the tempo of the match {{as the reason for}} their decision. Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola took the time to give special praise to Messi, whom he said he moved back into the midfield in order to increase the team's effectiveness when in possession of the ball. Messi had been withdrawn from his usual right-wing role into a more central position, while Samuel Eto'o, who had started the match as Barcelona's lone centre-forward, was moved out to the right. Guardiola also lauded the bravery of his entire team, stating that he believed that his team's victory hinged on their hard work and propensity for taking risks in attack, but he admitted that although his side had had the best season {{in the history of the}} club, they were not yet the best Barcelona team.|$|E
50|$|Following {{a ruling}} by the European Court of Human Rights, the United Kingdom {{government}} was tasked with amending the Representation of the People Act 1983 which contains the clauses forbidding serving prisoners from being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> cast <b>votes</b> in any elections. Even before 1983, prisoners in the UK weren't allowed <b>to</b> <b>vote,</b> which had been decided with the Forfeiture Act 1870.|$|R
40|$|Election {{laws are}} not uniform across the U. S.; many states {{differ in their}} {{approaches}} to when you are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> register <b>to</b> <b>vote,</b> and whether you can vote on Election Day. In new research, Alex Street examines the impact of legislation which prevents people from registering <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> in the lead up to the election. Using data on Google searches for “voter registration”, and comparing this with voter registration data he finds that if registration had been allowed {{up to and including}} Election Day, then between three and four million people could have registered <b>to</b> <b>vote,</b> which would have increased turnout by 3 percent...|$|R
5000|$|At {{this time}} {{voters in the}} Territories, while <b>able</b> and {{required}} <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> in elections for the House of Representatives, were not permitted <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> in referendums. [...] That was not established until 1977.|$|R
5|$|In 2009, Dustbin Baby {{was one of}} four {{works of}} children's {{television}} shortlisted for the International Emmy Award in the children and young people category at the 37th International Emmy Awards. The other nominations were Lharn Poo Koo E-Joo (produced by Workpoint Entertainment), The Little Emperor's Christmas (produced by Rede Globo), and Mille (produced by the Danish Broadcasting Corporation). The film was one of nine nominations for the UK, which had more than any other nation. The film won the award, making it one of six International Emmys for the UK, and one of three for the BBC, in 2009. Dustbin Baby was also shortlisted for the British Academy Children's Awards in the drama category, along with The Sarah Jane Adventures (also by the BBC), S4C's Rhestr Nadolig Wil, and the online show following boyband US5. The ceremony was held on 29 November at The London Hilton on Park Lane and hosted by Dick and Dom. Dustbin Baby lost out to Rhestr Nadolig Wil. Blakeman was shortlisted for the British Academy Children's Award for best writer, thanks to her screenplay for Dustbin Baby, and won. The film was also entered into the BAFTA Kids' Vote in the television category. Children aged between seven and fourteen were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> for their favourite television show from a choice also featuring Blue Peter, Dani's House, Newsround, Prank Patrol, The Sarah Jane Adventures, Hannah Montana, Phineas & Ferb, iCarly, and SpongeBob SquarePants.

5|$|Statutes {{passed in}} 1430 and 1432, {{during the reign}} of Henry VI, {{standardised}} property qualifications for county voters. Under these Acts, all owners of freehold property or land worth at least forty shillings in a particular county were entitled to vote in that county. This requirement, known as the forty shilling freehold, was never adjusted for inflation; thus the amount of land one had to own in order to vote gradually diminished over time. The franchise was restricted to males by custom rather than statute; on rare occasions women had been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> in parliamentary elections as a result of property ownership. Nevertheless, {{the vast majority of people}} were not entitled to vote; the size of the English county electorate in 1831 has been estimated at only 200,000. Furthermore, the sizes of the individual county constituencies varied significantly. The smallest counties, Rutland and Anglesey, had fewer than 1,000 voters each, while the largest county, Yorkshire, had more than 20,000. Those who owned property in multiple constituencies could vote multiple times; there was usually no need to live in a constituency in order to vote there.|$|E
5|$|The other {{featured}} preliminary {{match was}} between Kane and Gene Snitsky. At Unforgiven, Shawn Michaels defeated Kane in a no disqualification match, a match where neither wrestler can be disqualified, allowing for weapons and outside interference. The next night on Raw, Kane demanded that authority figure Eric Bischoff, a portrayed match-maker and rule-enforcer, {{give him a}} rematch against Michaels, but Bischoff refused to do so as Michaels was preoccupied with appearing in Chris Jericho's interview segment, The Highlight Reel. Bischoff, however, scheduled Kane in a no disqualification match against an opponent of Bischoff's choice. Kane's opponent was revealed to be Gene Snistky. During the match, Kane's scripted wife, Lita, who was pregnant in the storyline, entered the ring. This led to Kane accidentally falling {{on top of her}} after Snitsky hit Kane with a steel chair, ending the match. Trainers and emergency medical technicians rushed to the scene and took Lita away in an ambulance for medical attention. The following week, Kane was informed by doctors that Lita suffered a scripted miscarriage following the events of the previous week. On the September 27 episode of Raw, in an interview with Todd Grisham, Kane informed Grisham that he sought revenge against Snitsky for his actions. The following week, Lita gave her first interview since the miscarriage and revealed that she and Kane would get payback against Snitsky. During the same episode, Snitsky was interviewed by Raw commentator Jim Ross and told Ross that the death of the couple's unborn child was not his fault. Kane interrupted the interview segment, but Snitsky attacked Kane with a lead pipe in self-defense. This led Bischoff to announce a Weapon of Choice match for Taboo Tuesday, where fans would be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> on whether a lead pipe, a steel chain, or a steel chair would be legal for use in the match.|$|E

25|$|Voting {{abroad in}} 54 {{countries}} and 112 consulates began on 8 May and ended on 31 May, with different consulates choosing a time-frame {{appropriate for the}} number of registered voters in their respective country. Turkish voters in Germany, for example, were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> through the entire time allocated between 8 and 31 May, whereas voters in the United Kingdom were only <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> on the weekend of 30–31 May due to the significantly smaller electorate in relation to Germany. This was the second Turkish election where Turkish expats were also <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote.</b> The votes cast overseas did not affect the parliamentary distribution since there are no overseas constituencies that elect members of parliament. Votes cast overseas only influenced the vote share, which could define whether or not a party passed the 10% election threshold and also the party that came first overall in the general election. Votes were flown and counted in Turkey after polls abroad closed on 31 May.|$|E
