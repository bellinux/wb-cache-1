40|$|The mucosal {{adjuvant}} {{activity of}} <b>avridine,</b> a synthetic lipoidal amine [N,N-dioctadecyl-N',N'-(2 -hydroxymethyl) propanediamine, previously designated CP- 20, 961), was studied in rats immunized intraintestinally with cholera toxin or procholeragenoid. <b>Avridine</b> was most efficient as an adjuvant when incorporated into liposomes; liposomes that lacked <b>avridine</b> had no adjuvant effect. Coadministration of avridine-containing liposomes with enteric priming doses of cholera toxin or procholeragenoid enhanced {{the efficiency of}} priming for secondary mucosal anti-cholera toxin responses, i. e., the establishment of memory, five- to sevenfold. Avridine-containing liposomes had no significant effect, however, on either the primary mucosal anti-cholera toxin response, when given with the primary dose of antigen, or on the secondary response, when given with the booster dose to previously primed animals. Little or no adjuvant effect occurred when avridine-containing liposomes were given concurrently with antigen, but at a separate mucosal site or parenterally, or {{at the site of}} enteric immunization, but 1 day earlier or later. These results support the notion that adjuvants may be developed which enhance the mucosal immunogenicity of locally applied antigens and suggest that liposomes may be effective vehicles for delivery of such adjuvants...|$|E
40|$|<b>Avridine</b> is {{a potent}} {{synthetic}} adjuvant that can induce arthritis is most rat strains. The clinical appearance and histopathology of avridine-induced arthritis show great similarity to other arthritis models such as collagen-induced arthritis. In LEW and DA rats the avridine-induced arthritis is severe and long lasting. To investigate a possible genetic influence on the disease we compared LEW, DA and E 3 rats, which are of different genetic origins, {{for their ability to}} develop arthritis after injection of a low dose of <b>avridine</b> (1. 5 mg/rat). The E 3 rat was shown to be resistant, whereas all of the DA rats developed arthritis. Recombinant inbred strains derived from DA and E 3 parentals varied in susceptibility to <b>avridine.</b> Only strains sharing RT 1 av 1 with DA developed arthritis, indicating a role for the MHC genes. The MHC association was further analysed in a series of Lewis congenic strains using the 1. 5 mg <b>avridine</b> dose. All strains developed arthritis. LEW. 1 C and LEW. 1 W developed only acute arthritis, whereas LEW. 1 A, LEW, LEW. 1 D, LEW. 1 N and LEW. 1 F developed chronic arthritis. In particular, the LEW. 1 F rats developed a chronic severe arthritis of high incidence. The chronic arthritis showed an active, erosive joint inflammation several months after induction. Nude rats are resistant to avridine-induced arthritis, indicating a T cell dependence of the disease which supports the importance of MHC. However, non-MHC genes are also crucial to arthritis development. Recombinants between DA and E 3, sharing RT 1 av 1 with DA, showed either a lower incidence or a lower severity of disease than the DA rats. The E 3 rat and the recombinants with RT 1 u were completely resistant, whereas LEW. 1 W, also RT 1 u, were highly susceptible...|$|E

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the tissue {{reactions}} to various implant materials which coincide with an inflammatory reaction. We used the <b>avridine</b> arthritis rat model to evaluate the tissue response in the synovial, interstitial and subcutaneous tissues after implant insertion. Quantitative immunohistochemistry showed that normal joint synovial tissue is dominated by ED 2 -positive resident macrophages. Polyethylene implants induced a much stronger foreign-body reaction than titanium implants, as measured by the number of interfacial ED 1 -positive macrophages. The tissue response to titanium and polyethylene was also vastly different in arthritic synovial tissue compared with control tissue. It is likely that these biomaterials interact differently with inflammatory cells or intermediary compounds. It may be that arthritic synovial tissue produces reactive oxygen intermediates (free radicals) with which titanium has a unique anti-inflammatory interaction in vitro...|$|E
40|$|Objective To seek a {{mechanism}} linking tobacco smoking {{with the increased}} incidence and severity of rheumatoid arthritis, deduced from many retrospective surveys, by studying arthritis/fibrosis development in rats. Methods Rats (> 300) received low levels of sodium/potassium thiocyanate (10 or 25 mmol/l) in their drinking water to raise their blood thiocyanate levels, mimicking the elevated levels of blood, salivary and urinary thiocyanate found in smokers. Results Thiocyanate supplements increased the severity of experimental arthritis induced by tailbase injection of (1) Freund's complete adjuvants (mycobacteria plus various adjuvant-active oils), (2) collagen type-II with Freund's incomplete adjuvant (no mycobacteria), (3) the synthetic lipid amine, <b>avridine</b> in an oil and (4) the natural hydrocarbons squalene (C 30 H 50) and pristane (C 19 H 40). This pro-arthritic effect was independent of sex, rat strain or changing diet and housing facilities. Thiocyanate supplements also amplified the acute/persisting inflammatory responses to paw injections of pristane, zymosan and microcrystalline hydroxyapatite. Iodide salts also mimicked some of these effects of thiocyanate. Conclusion Thiocyanate, a detoxication product of HCN present in tobacco smoke, increased (or even induced) inflammatory responses to several agents causing arthritis or fibrotic inflammation in rats. It, therefore, {{can act as a}} co-arthritigen, or 'virulence factor' and could be a therapeutic target to reduce arthritis expression and morbidity. No Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|Animal models play a {{vital role}} in {{simplifying}} the complexity of pathogenesis and understanding the indefinable processes and diverse mechanisms involved in the progression of disease, and in providing new knowledge that may facilitate the drug development program. Selection of the animal models has to be carefully done, so that there is morphologic similarity to human arthritic conditions that may predict as well as augment the effective screening of novel antiarthritic agents. The review describes exclusively animal models of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA). The development of RA has been vividly described using a wide variety of animal models with diverse insults (viz. collagen, Freund′s adjuvant, proteoglycan, pristane, <b>avridine,</b> formaldehyde, etc.) that are able to simulate/trigger the cellular, biochemical, immunological, and histologic alterations, which perhaps mimic, to a great extent, the pathologic conditions of human RA. Similarly, numerous methods of inducing animal models with OA have also been described (such as spontaneous, surgical, chemical, and physical methods including genetically manipulated animals) which may give an insight into the events of alteration in connective tissues and their metabolism (synovial membrane/tissues along with cartilage) and bone erosion. The development of such arthritic animal models may throw light for better understanding of the etiopathogenic mechanisms of human arthritis and give new impetus for the drug development program on arthritis, a crippling disease...|$|E
40|$|For {{several reasons}} the major outer {{membrane}} protein from Neisseria gonorrhoeae (gonococcal protein [PI]) {{is an attractive}} component for a gonococcal vaccine. This paper describes the influence of two different physical forms of PI on its immunogenic activity. To this end PI was delivered in liposomes and in protein-detergent complexes. In both forms PI was present in a multimeric form. The liposomes were composed of phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol. The effect of dicetylphosphate as a negatively charged amphiphile and three lipoidal adjuvants was investigated. Two lipoidal adjuvants (<b>Avridine</b> and dimethyldioctadecylammoniumbromide) were positively charged amphiphiles, whereas the third one (tridecyl N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutaminate) was neutral. The protein-detergent complexes were also tested {{in the presence of}} the lipoidal adjuvants and in an AlPO 4 -adsorbed form. The liposome preparations were characterized for their size, charge, and residual amount of detergent. The immunogenic activity of PI in all forms was tested in mice. The results of the antibody assays showed that PI in the liposomes was more immunogenic than PI in the complexes. A second dose with liposomes induced only a small booster effect, whereas such a dose with the complexes produced pronounced booster effects. The incorporation of the positively charged lipoidal adjuvants in the liposomes resulted in enhanced booster effects. The highest immunogenic activity of PI after two injections, however, was observed in the complexed form adsorbed to AlPO 4...|$|E

40|$|The immune {{pathology}} and MHC {{association of}} chronic arthritis was studied in three rat models for reumatoid arthritis (RA). Susceptible rat strains develop a T cell dependent chronic disease after immunization with rat collagen type II (CII). The LEW rat does not develop arthritis after immunization with rat CII, but a heterologous immune response to pepsin can break the tolerance to CII and render it susceptible to collagen induced arthritis (CIA). DA rats are protected against CIA if pre-treated with denatured CII or native CII in a non arthritogenic fashion. This {{was associated with}} a poor B cell response but a normal T cell response compared to that of CIA, suggesting that B cells specific for conformational epitopes on the CII molecule are essential for the development of chronic CIA. The non-immunogenic adjuvants, <b>avridine</b> and pristane induced chronic T cell dependent arthritis in rats. CIA, AvIA and PIA had a similar MHC association, with RT 1 a and RT 1 f being the most susceptible haplotypes. In AvIA and PIA, the MHC mainly influenced the chronicity of arthritis. The genetic control of the PIA model, apart from the MHC association (pia 1), was further analyzed in a cross between E 3 and DA. A total genome scan of the F 2 progeny revealed an additional loci; pia 2 on chromosome 12 and two suggestive loci pia 3 on chromosome 6 and pia 4 on chromosome 11. Pia 2 and pia 4 were also associated with an a 1 -acid glycoprotein production and an IgG 2 b and rheumatoid factor response, whereas pia 3 {{was associated with a}} fibronectin and IL- 6 response...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} 89 Sr {{treatment}} {{on the natural}} host resistance of CD- 1 mice and the enhancement of resistance by immunomodulators to infection with Listeria monocytogenes or herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV- 2) were determined. In the CD- 1 mouse, single-dose treatment with 89 Sr caused a profound {{decrease in the number}} of circulating monocytes (Mo), lymphocytes, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) within 1 week. There was also marked functional impairment of the Mo inflammatory response, as well as markedly decreased spontaneous and activatable cytotoxicity by splenic natural killer (NK) cells. Despite this profound cellular suppression, there was no significant change in natural resistance of CD- 1 mice to L. monocytogenes or HSV- 2 infection. Furthermore, prophylactic treatment of mice with the biologic immunomodulator Corynebacterium parvum or the synthetic immunomodulators maleic anhydride-divinyl ether or <b>avridine</b> in liposomes resulted in comparable enhancement of resistance in 89 Sr-treated and normal mice. These data indicate that natural and immunomodulator-enhanced resistance of CD- 1 mice to microbial infections do not depend on normal levels of Mo, PMN, or NK cells. The resistance enhancement may rely on activated tissue macrophages (M phi). In contrast to the early changes in circulating leukocytes, the resident peritoneal cell populations were not markedly altered until after day 30. There then was a distinct decline in lymphocytes and a gradual decline in M phi; the change in M phi was apparently due to the lack of an age-related increase in the peritoneal M phi population in 89 Sr-treated mice in comparison with a slight increase in resident M phi in normal mice. After CD- 1 mice were treated with 89 Sr, the number of PMN and the function of NK cells generally recovered by about day 50 and was followed by partial recovery of circulating Mo, unless a second dose of 89 Sr was administered...|$|E
40|$|The {{educational}} {{situation of}} the Roma children in Poland is improving gradually. At present opportunities for financing various educational and cultural activities in Poland, created mostly by the Governmental Program for the Roma Community, are incomparably better than several years ago. There is, however, no debate about the model of education for the Gypsy children. Education in regular schools, advocated by {{the vast majority of}} Romani activists, raises the level of Roma education, but, on the other hand, it may bring very harmful outcomes. Roma children learn in such schools neither Romani language, nor history, and the language they speak undergoes rapid polonization. Books published in Romani in Poland are very rare. Moreover, the idea of introducing Romani to the school curricula is met with anger by more traditional Gypsies. In spite of that, however, it is necessary to have Romani language and history taught in schools if we want the language and culture of the Roma who live in Poland to survive.

Among the written sources, the most extensive collection of Gypsy songs texts is work by Izydor Kopernicki “Textes tsiganes, contes et poésies”.

The first transcriptions {{and analysis of the}} melody of Gypsy songs were included in the master’s thesis of Ewa Kafel, titled “Songs of Gypsies of Czarna Góra near Bukowina Tatrzańska”. Transcriptions of songs by Teresa Mirga and score of works by Edward Dębicki have been included in the master’s thesis of the author of this article. In addition Agnieszka J. Kowarska was dealing with the problems of Gypsy dances in Poland. Among the phonographic sources the best documented traditional Gypsy repertoire are the field recordings by the Hungarian ethnomusicologist Katalin Kovalcsik, who in 1986 was conducting her research in the south of Poland. Within the context of the limited research undertaken, the musical repertoire of the Carpathian Gypsies has been well documented.
