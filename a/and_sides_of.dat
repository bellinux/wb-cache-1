5|$|As an extratropical storm over Newfoundland, Florence {{produced}} powerful winds peaking at 101mph (163km/h) {{and moderate}} amounts of rainfall {{of up to}} 2.6inches (67mm). Flooding and power outages were reported, although they were isolated. The hurricane caused flight interruptions at St. John's International Airport and also to the Trans Canada ferry between Newfoundland and Cape Breton Island in eastern Nova Scotia. Strong winds destroyed {{a house in the}} small Newfoundland village of Francois. Residents in Francois agreed to rebuild the wrecked home while the family temporarily resided in a summer home of another family. The winds also caused damage to shingles <b>and</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> homes, while the strong waves damaged roads and boats along the Burin Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|C. m. monedula (Linnaeus, 1758), the {{nominate}} subspecies, {{is found}} in eastern Europe. Its range extends across Scandinavia, from southern Finland south to Esbjerg and Haderslev in Denmark, through eastern Germany and Poland, and south across eastern central Europe to the Carpathian Mountains and north-western Romania, Vojvodina in northern Serbia, and Slovenia. It breeds in south-eastern Norway, southern Sweden, and northern and eastern Denmark, with occasional wintering in England and France. It has been recorded as a rare vagrant to Spain. It has a pale nape <b>and</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the neck, a dark throat, and a light grey partial collar of variable extent.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant Colonel Dawson {{had decided}} that the two French troops should take the lead into Ouistreham, {{followed}} by the six British troops. The French were unopposed apart from some mortar rounds and machine gun fire as they neared their objective. No. 8 French Troop occupied houses at the front <b>and</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the Casino strong point. An assault to capture the Casino was driven back. While {{this was going on}} the other French troop, No. 1, approached the Casino from the rear. Taking up firing positions they too started to engage the strong point but their fire had almost no effect. The French commander Capitaine de fr√©gate Philippe Kieffer was just about to order an all out assault by both troops, when reports that British amphibious tanks were in Ouistreham reached him. Sending a guide to bring one forward, the tank arrived in front of the Casino and proceeded to destroy the German gun emplacements. Within 30 minutes of the tanks' arrival, all the strong point guns were silenced and No. 1Troop had assaulted and captured the objective. With its capture the French Commandos were now in control of the western suburbs of Ouistreham.|$|E

5|$|The trachea and bronchi {{form the}} tracheobronchial tree. The trachea is {{situated}} between {{the lower end}} of the larynx and the center of the chest, where it splits into the two bronchi at a ridge called the carina. The trachea is stabilized and kept open by rings made of cartilage that surround the front <b>and</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the structure; these rings are not closed and do not surround the back, which is made of membrane. The bronchi split into smaller branches and then to bronchioles that supply air to the alveoli, the tiny air-filled sacs in the lungs responsible for absorbing oxygen. An arbitrary division can be made between the intrathoracic and cervical trachea at the thoracic inlet, an opening at the top of the thoracic cavity. Anatomical structures that surround and protect the tracheobronchial tree include the lungs, the esophagus, large blood vessels, the rib cage, the thoracic spine, and the sternum. Children have softer tracheas and a more elastic tracheobronchial trees than adults; this elasticity, which helps protect the structures from injury when they are compressed, may contribute to the lower incidence of TBI in children.|$|E

25|$|The {{color is}} {{probably}} the most diagnostic feature of the fish, especially when alive or fresh from the water. The back <b>and</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the fish are bright yellow, with the lower sides and underside of head fading to white. Four bright-blue stripes run longitudinally {{on the side of the}} fish, with several faint greyish stripes on lowermost part of sides. Most fins are yellow.|$|E

25|$|The trachea is {{surrounded}} by rings of hyaline cartilage; these rings are incomplete and C-shaped. The cricoid cartilage {{is attached to the}} first tracheal ring at top of the trachea and acts as the bottom of the larynx. There are fifteen to twenty rings in total, separated by narrow intervals. These reinforce the front <b>and</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the trachea to protect and maintain the airway.|$|E
25|$|Other {{exterior}} injuries include cuts {{caused by}} toenails piercing adjacent toes. This {{can be prevented}} by keeping toe nails cut short and filed smooth. Also, calluses may form on the bottoms <b>and</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the feet, which can crack open. This can be helped {{by the use of}} gel pad protectors on specific problem spots or using pads to surround the toes. Ingrown nails can result from ill-fitting shoes.|$|E
25|$|Kidney stones (nephrolithiasis) are a {{relatively}} common and particularly painful disorder. A chronic condition {{can result in}} scars to the kidneys. The removal of kidney stones involves ultrasound treatment {{to break up the}} stones into smaller pieces, which are then passed through the urinary tract. One common symptom of kidney stones is a sharp to disabling pain in the middle <b>and</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the lower back or groin.|$|E

25|$|The body or {{basket of}} the chariot rested {{directly}} on the axle (called beam) connecting the two wheels. There was no suspension, making this an uncomfortable form of transport. At the front <b>and</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the basket was a semicircular guard about 3ft (1 m) high, to give some protection from enemy attack. At the back the basket was open, {{making it easy to}} mount and dismount. There was no seat, and generally only enough room for the driver and one passenger.|$|E
25|$|A big, powerful, tannic wine, Barolo {{needs to}} be matched with foods of similar weight. Paired with light dishes low in protein, such as steamed vegetables, a Barolo will {{overwhelm}} the food; its tannins will react with the proteins on the tongue <b>and</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the mouth, accentuating the bitterness and drying the palate. In Piedmont, the wines are often paired with meat dishes, heavy pastas and rich risottos; the tannins bind to the food proteins and come across as softer.|$|E
25|$|Vihuela {{bodies were}} lightly {{constructed}} from thin flat slabs or pieces of wood, bent or curved as required. This construction method distinguished them from some earlier types of string instruments whose bodies (if not the entire instrument including neck) were carved {{out from a}} solid single block of wood. The back <b>and</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> common lutes were also made of pieces however, being multiple curved or bent staves joined and glued {{together to form a}} bowl, made from cypress with a spruce or cedar top.|$|E

25|$|The thrones of Christ are adorned at the {{top with}} carpet of flowers like {{carnations}} or iris, or mount of corks. while most of Virgin's thrones are covered by an ornate canopy sujeted to the cajillo by 12 or 16 palio bars. From the front, back <b>and</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the canopy hang the bambalinas, velver o mesh draperies embroidered in gold, plate and silk.

25|$|Most Byzantine helmets {{are shown}} being worn with armour for the neck. Somewhat less {{frequently}} the defences also cover {{the throat and}} {{there are indications that}} full facial protection was occasionally afforded. The most often illustrated example of such armour is a sectioned skirt depending from the back <b>and</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the helmet; this may have been of quilted construction, leather strips or of metal splint reinforced fabric. Other depictions of helmets, especially the ‚ÄòCaucasian‚Äô type, are shown with a mail aventail or camail attached to the brow-band (which is confirmed by actual examples from the Balkans, Romania, Russia and elsewhere).|$|E
25|$|Southern yellowjackets are {{typically}} {{found in the}} eastern United States and {{as far south as}} Mexico and Guatemala. Their territory expands as far west as Texas and as far east as the Atlantic Ocean. These areas tend to have fairly warm weather and in some cases, tropical climates. Within these territories, nests {{are typically}} found in unnatural habitats, such as yards, parks, <b>and</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> roads. Some colonies, though, are found in pine forests. Their parasitic relationship with V. maculifrons can result in V. squamosa colony formation in hardwood forests, a habitat more typical of V. maculifrons. Most nests are subterranean, though some have been found above ground or in walls, close to V. maculifrons nests.|$|E
