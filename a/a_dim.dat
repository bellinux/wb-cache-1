5|$|In 1975, Stephen Hawking {{published}} a calculation which suggested that black holes {{are not completely}} black but emit <b>a</b> <b>dim</b> radiation due to quantum effects near the event horizon. At first, Hawking's result posed a problem for theorists because it suggested that black holes destroy information. More precisely, Hawking's calculation seemed to conflict {{with one of the}} basic postulates of quantum mechanics, which states that physical systems evolve in time according to the Schrödinger equation. This property is usually referred to as unitarity of time evolution. The apparent contradiction between Hawking's calculation and the unitarity postulate of quantum mechanics {{came to be known as}} the black hole information paradox.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, Stephen Hawking {{published}} a calculation which suggested that black holes {{are not completely}} black but emit <b>a</b> <b>dim</b> radiation due to quantum effects near the event horizon. This work extended previous results of Jacob Bekenstein who had suggested that black holes have a well defined entropy. At first, Hawking's result appeared to contradict {{one of the main}} postulates of quantum mechanics, namely the unitarity of time evolution. Intuitively, the unitarity postulate says that quantum mechanical systems do not destroy information as they evolve from one state to another. For this reason, the apparent contradiction {{came to be known as}} the black hole information paradox.|$|E

5|$|Kepler's primary {{obligation}} as imperial mathematician {{was to provide}} astrological advice to the emperor. Though Kepler took <b>a</b> <b>dim</b> view of the attempts of contemporary astrologers to precisely predict the future or divine specific events, he had been casting well-received detailed horoscopes for friends, family, and patrons since his time as a student in Tübingen. In addition to horoscopes for allies and foreign leaders, the emperor sought Kepler's advice in times of political trouble. Rudolph was actively interested {{in the work of}} many of his court scholars (including numerous alchemists) and kept up with Kepler's work in physical astronomy as well.|$|E

5|$|Some bathhouses have areas {{designed}} to facilitate impersonal sex. These areasrooms or hallwaysare illuminated only by <b>a</b> (<b>dim)</b> red exit sign. It {{is possible to}} have sex, but not to see with whom. Other bathhouses, such as the Continental Baths in New York or the Club Baths in Washington, D.C., have two or more bunkbeds in close proximity, in a public area. This provides a place to have sex for those who could afford only a locker, and facilitated exhibitionism and voyeurism for those so inclined. Baths often have a (porn) TV room or snack bar where patrons can recuperate between orgasms.|$|E
25|$|In many cases, <b>a</b> <b>dimmer</b> can be {{replaced}} by a constant power module (CPM), which is typically a 20- or 50-ampere breaker in <b>a</b> <b>dimming</b> module casing. CPMs are used to supply line voltage to non-dimming electrical devices such as smoke machines, chain winches, and scenic motors that require constant operating voltage. When a device is powered by a CPM, it is fully energized whenever the CPM is turned on, independent of lighting console levels. CPMs must be used (in lieu of dimmers) to power non-dimming devices that require specific line voltages (e.g., in the US, 110 V, 60Hz power) in order to avoid damage to such devices. Dimmers are seldom used to control non-dimming devices because even if <b>a</b> <b>dimmer</b> channel is trusted to always operate at full power, it may not be controlled when communications are disrupted by start up and shut down of the lighting control surface, noise interference, or DMX disconnects or failure. Such a loss of control might cause <b>a</b> <b>dimmer</b> to <b>dim</b> <b>a</b> circuit and thus potentially damage its non-dimming device.|$|R

5|$|The Fraternity's rituals {{at their}} Bayswater temple {{were carried out}} under <b>a</b> <b>dim</b> light, with Fortune {{claiming}} that bright light disperses etheric forces. An altar {{was placed in the}} centre of a room, with the colours of the altar-cloth and the symbols on the altar varying according to the ceremony being performed. A light was placed on the altar while incense, usually frankincense, was burned. The senior officers sat in a row along the eastern end of the room, while officers—who were believed to be channels for cosmic forces—were positioned at various positions on the floor. The lodge was opened by walking around the room in a circle chanting, with the intent of building a psychic force up as a wall. Next, the cosmic entities would be invoked, with the members believing that these entities would manifest in astral form and interact with the chosen officers.|$|E

40|$|Light-emitting diode (LED) road {{lighting}} {{has been widely}} implemented in recent years, but few studies have evaluated its performance after installation. This study investigated whether LED {{road lighting}} complies with minimum regulations in terms of traffic safety and whether improvements for energy efficiency are possible. Average road surface luminance (L), overall luminance uniformity (Uo), longitudinal luminance uniformity (UI), power density (PD) and normalised power density (PN) were evaluated for 14 roads (seven designed for vehicular traffic and seven for pedestrians and bicycles). Energy savings were calculated as the percentage reduction to the minimum level of the existing lighting class or a lower lighting class and by applying <b>a</b> <b>dimming</b> schedule. The results showed that LED road lighting for vehicular traffic roads generally fulfilled the requirements, whereas that for pedestrian and bicycle roads generally corresponded to the lowest lighting class for L, and often {{did not meet the}} statutory requirements for Uo and UI. By adapting lighting levels to the minimum requirement of the existing lighting class or by dropping to a lower lighting class, vehicular traffic roads could save 6 %– 35 % on L to lighting class M 5 and 23 %– 61 % on L to lighting class M 6. <b>A</b> <b>dimming</b> schedule could lead to energy savings of 49 %. There is little potential for savings on pedestrian and bicycle roads, except by implementing <b>a</b> <b>dimming</b> schedule. Thus, in general, for vehicular, pedestrian and bicycle roads, <b>a</b> <b>dimming</b> schedule can save more energy than can be achieved in general by reducing lighting class. Furthermore, since <b>a</b> <b>dimming</b> schedule can be adjusted to traffic intensity, any potential risk of compromising traffic safety is minimised...|$|R
