5|$|Apart {{from these}} more {{spectacular}} pieces of resistance, {{in some places}} chantry priests continued to say prayers and landowners to pay them to do so. Opposition to the removal of images was widespread—so much so that when during the Commonwealth, William Dowsing was commissioned {{to the task of}} image breaking in Suffolk, his task, as he records it, was enormous. In Kent and the southeast, compliance was mostly willing and for many, the sale of vestments and plate was an opportunity to make money (but it was <b>also</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> in London and Kent, Reformation ideas had permeated more deeply into popular thinking).|$|E

25|$|Although {{it is true}} that in most {{patients}} ophthalmopathy, goiter, and symptoms of thyrotoxicosis appear more or less coincidentally, it is <b>also</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> in certain cases eye signs may appear long before thyrotoxicosis is evident, or become worse when the thyrotoxicosis is subsiding or has been controlled by treatment. In approximately 20% of ophthalmopathy patients, ophthalmopathy appears before the onset of hyperthyroidism, in about 40% concurrently, and in about 20% in the six months after diagnosis. In the remainder, the eye disease first becomes apparent after treatment of the hyperthyroidism, more often in patients treated with radioiodine.|$|E

25|$|The best {{available}} {{estimate of the}} number of persons in Turkey speaking the Kurdish language is about five million (1980). About 3,950,000 others speak Northern Kurdish (Kurmanji) (1980). While population increase suggests that the number of speakers has grown, it is <b>also</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> the ban {{on the use of the}} language in Turkey was only lifted in 1991 and still exists in most official settings (including schools), and that many fewer ethnic Kurds live in the countryside where the language has traditionally been used. The number of speakers is clearly less than the 15 million or so persons who identify themselves as ethnic Kurds.|$|E
25|$|From the gene's {{point of}} view, {{evolutionary}} success ultimately depends on {{leaving behind the}} maximum number of copies of itself in the population. Until 1964, it was generally believed that genes only achieved this by causing the individual to leave {{the maximum number of}} viable offspring. However, in 1964 W. D. Hamilton proved mathematically that, because close relatives of an organism share some identical genes, a gene can also increase its evolutionary success by promoting the reproduction and survival of these related or otherwise similar individuals. Hamilton concluded that this leads natural selection to favor organisms that would behave in ways that maximize their inclusive fitness. It is <b>also</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> natural selection favors behavior that maximizes personal fitness.|$|E
25|$|Initial {{reports were}} that the team's colours would be changed to red and white, but the Leafs were wearing white sweaters with a green maple leaf for their first game on February 17, 1927. On September 27, 1927, it was {{announced}} that the Leafs had changed their colour scheme to blue and white, which they have worn ever since. While the Leafs say that blue represents the Canadian skies and white represents snow, it is <b>also</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> top-level Toronto teams have worn blue since the Toronto Argonauts adopted blue as their primary colour in 1873. Another theory is that Smythe changed the colours as a nod to his high school alma mater, Upper Canada College, whose teams have worn blue and white since 1829 and the University of Toronto whose teams have also worn blue and were called the Varsity Blues.|$|E

25|$|Much about Canadian {{federalism}} has undoubtedly {{changed in}} the last fifteen years, although it is <b>also</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> much remains the same. The foundations of Canadian federalism were laid at the Quebec Conference of 1864. The Quebec Resolutions were a compromise between those who wanted sovereignty vested in the federal government and those who wanted it vested in the provinces. The compromise based the federation on the constitution of the British Empire, under which the legal sovereignty of imperial power was modified by the conventions of colonial responsible government, making colonies of settlement (such as those of British North America) self-governing in domestic affairs. A protracted political process ensued before the Quebec Resolutions became the British North America Act of 1867. This process was dominated by John A. Macdonald, who joined British officials in attempting to make the federation more centralized than that envisaged by the Resolutions.|$|E
25|$|Bonnaud {{received}} {{promotion to}} general of division on 30 April 1794, {{the same day}} that Landrecies surrendered to the Coalition. He accepted command of Chapuy's former division after some reluctance. If many officers received rapid promotion at this time, it was <b>also</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> many were soon denounced as traitors and executed. Soon after, Pichegru sent the unit from Cambrai to Sainghin-en-Mélantois near Lille where it absorbed Pierre-Jacques Osten's brigade, making the division 23,000-strong. On 10 May Bonnaud's division attacked the Duke of York at Marquain, now a western suburb of Tournai. York turned the French right flank at Camphin-en-Pévèle with three heavy cavalry brigades under David Dundas, Sir Robert Laurie and Richard Vyse. Some of the French cavalry fled but the infantry withdrew without panicking. It {{was the first time the}} French infantry formed square with success, driving off British cavalry charges. Finally, artillery firing grapeshot disordered the French squares and the Scots Greys charged, breaking into a square. After this event the cavalry overran two more squares. In the actions at Baisieux and Willems French losses were estimated at 3,000 killed and wounded plus 500 men and 13 guns captured. British losses numbered 245. These combats were part of the larger Battle of Courtrai in which the French emerged victorious.|$|E
