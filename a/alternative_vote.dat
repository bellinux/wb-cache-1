25|$|In December 2010, {{ahead of}} the UK <b>Alternative</b> <b>Vote</b> Referendum 2011, Straw was a {{signatory}} to {{a letter to the}} Guardian arguing in favour of the <b>alternative</b> <b>vote.</b>|$|E
25|$|As part of {{the deal}} that formed the coalition, it was agreed to hold a {{referendum}} on the <b>Alternative</b> <b>Vote,</b> in which the Conservatives would campaign for First Past the Post and the Liberal Democrats for <b>Alternative</b> <b>Vote.</b> The referendum, held on 5 May 2011, resulted in First Past the Post being chosen over <b>Alternative</b> <b>Vote</b> by approximately two-thirds of voters.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, the Conservative—Liberal Democrat {{coalition}} government agreed {{to hold a}} national referendum on the <b>alternative</b> <b>vote,</b> held on 5 May 2011. The proposal would have affected {{the way in which}} Members of Parliament are elected to the British House of Commons at Westminster. It was only the second national referendum ever to be held within the United Kingdom and the result of the referendum was a decisive rejection of the adoption of the <b>alternative</b> <b>vote</b> by a margin of 67.9 percent to 32.1 percent of voters on a national turnout of 42%.|$|E

Such a process may not be used for an official vote without the prior approval of the committees of the Senate and of the House of Commons that normally consider electoral matters or, {{in the case of an}} <b>alternative</b> electronic <b>voting</b> process, without the prior approval of the Senate and the House of Commons.|$|R

25|$|Also {{called the}} <b>Alternative</b> <b>Vote</b> in Canada, IRV {{has never been}} used for federal {{elections}} but was used for provincial elections in British Columbia (1952 and 1953), Alberta (1926), and Manitoba (1927–1953).|$|E
25|$|On 26 November 2010, Beckett was {{announced}} as the President of the NOtoAV campaign, which campaigned {{to retain the}} First Past the Post (FPTP) electoral system at the 2011 United Kingdom <b>Alternative</b> <b>Vote</b> referendum.|$|E
25|$|In April 2011, Mayall again {{revived the}} {{character}} of Alan B'Stard to make an appearance in a satirical television advertisement for the No2AV campaign prior to the 2011 voting reform referendum in the UK. The character is shown being elected under the <b>alternative</b> <b>vote</b> system, then using his newly gained position of power to renege on his campaign promises. In his personal life, Rik Mayall {{did not support the}} <b>alternative</b> <b>vote.</b> In May, Mayall became the eponymous 'Bombardier' in a TV advertising campaign for Bombardier Bitter in the UK. The adverts landed broadcaster UKTV Dave in trouble with Ofcom when they were found to breach the Ofcom code for linking alcohol with sexual attractiveness or success.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the influence of}} <b>alternative</b> <b>voting</b> technologies on electoral outcomes in multi-party systems. Using data from a field experiment conducted during the 2005 legislative election in Argentina, we examine the role of information effects associated with <b>alternative</b> <b>voting</b> devices on the support for the competing parties. We find that differences {{in the type of}} information displayed and how it was presented across devices favored some parties to the detriment of others. The impact of voting technologies was found to be larger than in two-party systems, and could lead to changes in election results. We conclude that authorities in countries moving to adopt new voting systems should carefully take the potential partisan advantages induced by different technologies into account when evaluating their implementation. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC...|$|R
40|$|I discuss {{instances}} where a committee wants {{to deviate from}} the simple majority rule by adopting an <b>alternative</b> <b>voting</b> scheme for two consecutive binary ballots. The <b>alternative</b> <b>voting</b> rule, called Minority Voting as an Exception (MVE), works as follows: In the first ballot a b-majority rule is used, where b < 1 / 2 {{is equal to the}} minority fraction that favors some project, say project 1. This allows the minority to induce the adoption of project 1. After the first ballot all voting winners, i. e. the minority of project winners, lose their voting rights for the upcoming second ballot, where the simple majority rule is used. Hence, MVE may benefit both project losers and winners and may thus be unanimously accepted. The analysis of this short-term deviation is presented with a potential application in the sphere of communal politics...|$|R
5|$|Kefalas {{proposed}} {{a bill to}} explore <b>alternative</b> <b>voting</b> systems, which was defeated in committee, but {{which led to the}} creation of an 11-member multi-partisan task force to study related issues.

50|$|In November 2010, {{following}} {{the announcement of}} a forthcoming referendum {{on the issue of}} whether or not to introduce the <b>alternative</b> <b>voting</b> system in the United Kingdom, Southern was appointed operations director of No to AV, the campaign to oppose the idea. Following the conclusion of that in May 2011, Southern established her own business, Sarah Southern Consulting, in June 2011.|$|R
50|$|The {{referendum}} was indicative (non-binding), {{and asked}} two questions. The first question asked voters if {{they wished to}} keep the existing MMP voting system, or change to a different voting system. The second question asked which <b>alternative</b> <b>voting</b> system the voter would prefer if New Zealand were to change voting system: first past the post, preferential voting, single transferable vote, or supplementary member.|$|R
25|$|Elections in PNG attract {{numerous}} candidates. After {{independence in}} 1975, members were {{elected by the}} first past the post system, with winners frequently gaining less than 15% of the vote. Electoral reforms in 2001 introduced the Limited Preferential Vote system (LPV), {{a version of the}} <b>Alternative</b> <b>Vote.</b> The 2007 general election was the first to be conducted using LPV.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, Izzard {{was named}} in {{a list of}} the biggest private {{financial}} donors to the Labour Party. He appeared in a party political broadcast for the Labour Party in the run up to the 2005 general election. He donated nearly £10,000 to the party in 2008, appeared again in a party political broadcast for the 2009 European election, and again in a 2010 election video entitled Brilliant Britain. Izzard appeared in literature to support changing the British electoral system from first-past-the-post to <b>alternative</b> <b>vote</b> for electing Members of Parliament to the House of Commons in the <b>Alternative</b> <b>Vote</b> referendum in 2011. In 2011, Izzard revealed that he had political ambitions and wanted to become an MP, Mayor, or MEP by 2020. On 25 February 2016, Izzard announced his intention to stand for the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party. It was announced on 9 August 2016 that Izzard had failed to be elected to the N.E.C.|$|E
25|$|In January 2011, Labour peers, {{including}} most notably John Prescott, {{were attempting to}} delay {{the passage of the}} Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Bill 2010 until after 16 February, the deadline given by the Electoral Commission to allow the referendum on the <b>Alternative</b> <b>Vote</b> to take place on 5 May. On the eighth day of debate, staff in the House of Lords set up camp beds and refreshments to allow peers to rest, {{for the first time in}} eight years.|$|E
5000|$|Huhne was {{reported}} to have strongly criticised Conservative colleagues at a Cabinet meeting in early May 2011 for the No campaign's material. However, one of the key No campaign leaflets he targeted, showing a newborn baby with the slogan [...] "She needs a maternity unit, not an <b>alternative</b> <b>voting</b> system", was developed by Dan Hodges, a Labour Party campaigner working for NO2AV.|$|R
40|$|The {{exploration}} of electoral systems has long considered {{the impact that}} <b>alternative</b> <b>voting</b> systems could have on electoral outcomes. <b>Alternative</b> <b>voting</b> systems have long been assumed to impact electoral process, vote choice, and candidate success. Building on the earlier work and expanding the data used in “Trading places and Extreme Vote Makeover” by Yonk et al, we explore the impact of ranked choice voting in the City of Minneapolis, MN. In this paper, we examine the impact that instant-runoff voting has had on incumbency rates in Minneapolis. Using data from mayoral and city council election ballots in Minneapolis from 2013, we examine the impacts of ranked choice voting on the engagement of elected officials and voters in the electoral process. It {{is well known that}} incumbents have many advantages over challengers, and systems like ranked-choice voting that take multiple voter preferences into account, may afford more protection to incumbents. Using the actual individual vote data for the city, we test that possibility empirically...|$|R
50|$|Some limited (to {{a greater}} or lesser degree) <b>alternative</b> <b>voting</b> and {{official}} appointing systems claim to be democratic. One-party states such as the People's Republic of China apply a limited form of disapproval voting that helps to signal the acceptance of those promoted into new posts. Those who do not receive very high (over 80%) acceptance generally rise no further in rank or position.|$|R
25|$|IRV, {{under the}} name <b>Alternative</b> <b>Vote,</b> {{was one of the}} four {{alternative}} methods available (alongside MMP, STV and SM) in the 1992 referendum on the voting method to elect MP's to the New Zealand House of Representatives. It came third of the alternative methods (ahead of SM) with 6.6% of the vote. IRV, {{under the name}} Preferential Vote, was one of the four alternative methods choices presented in the 2011 voting method referendum, but the referendum resulted in New Zealanders choosing to keep their proportional method of representation instead, while IRV came last with 8.34%.|$|E
25|$|In the United Kingdom {{the method}} is {{commonly}} known as the <b>alternative</b> <b>vote.</b> It is used to elect the leaders of the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats. (The leader of the Conservative Party is elected under a similar method, a variant of the exhaustive ballot.) It is also used for by-elections to the British House of Lords, in which hereditary peers are selected for that body. AV is also used by members of parliament to elect the chairmen of select committees and the Speaker of the House of Lords. The Speaker of the House of Commons is elected by the exhaustive ballot.|$|E
25|$|The plan {{to hold a}} snap {{election}} in 2015 was announced on 14 January by President Artur Mas. After the non-binding 2014 independence referendum, Mas declared that the election was to be turned into an <b>alternative</b> <b>vote</b> on independence, with pro-independence parties including the independence goal in their election manifestos. As part of the process, CDC, along with Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC), Democrats of Catalonia (DC) and Left Movement (MES) would run together under the Junts pel Sí (JxSí) platform, with support {{from members of the}} pro-independence Catalan National Assembly (ANC), Òmnium and the Municipalities' Association for Independence (AMI). The alliance, however, failed to achieve its self-stated goal to attain an absolute majority on its own.|$|E
5000|$|Since its formation, Respect has {{presented}} itself as being [...] "genuinely left" [...] and {{has sought to}} appeal to leftist voters dissatisfied with the Labour Party's shift to the centre {{under the leadership of}} Blair and Gordon Brown. There has however been little electoral support for parties to the left of Labour in Britain, with the party having to seek out an <b>alternative</b> <b>voting</b> base.|$|R
40|$|The National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing (NASCAR) is {{currently}} the No. 1 spectator sport in the United States. However, {{the manner in which}} drivers are ranked to determine the final winner of the championship relies on a somewhat arbitrary point assignment, including bonuses and penalties. In this work, we compare the results of <b>alternative</b> <b>voting</b> methods to determine NASCAR rankings for the Sprint Cup Series. Each of these methods have desirable theoretical properties, and all make use only of the final placement of each driver in each race. We then construct a set of metrics to determine the effectiveness of each of these voting methods when compared to one another and the actual NASCAR scoring system. Finally, we attempt to generate more optimal methods, as defined by those same metrics, using a real-coded genetic algorithm. Our results show that most of the <b>alternative</b> <b>voting</b> methods vastly outperform the actual NASCAR system in terms of those metrics. Likewise, the methods produced by the genetic algorithm outperform even the best of the alternative methods...|$|R
50|$|By the 1950s, the {{coalition}} {{had begun to}} fall apart, resulting in the Conservatives and Liberals having {{to run for office}} separately under their own party banners. However, {{in order to ensure that}} the CCF was prevented from taking power, one of the last acts of {{the coalition}} government was to introduce an <b>alternative</b> <b>voting</b> system (known today in the USA as instant-runoff voting), which was implemented for the 1952 general election.|$|R
