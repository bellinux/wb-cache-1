25|$|Gentle {{makes it}} to the top of the palace where he {{encounters}} the Autarch, who reveals that Gentle is the Maestro Sartori, who led the failed effort to reconcile the dominions 200 years before. Going to see the Pivot, Gentle is told that he has to make another attempt at reconciliation. Through explanation by the Autarch and a vision he witnesses, the true events of what happened 200 years before are finally revealed. As Sartori, he was in love with Judith, the lover of Joshua Godolphin, and was able to convince Joshua to let him create a replica of her through magic. During the long process of replicating her however, he got drunk and went into the circle that she was being replicated in, and made love to her. This resulted in a replica of himself being created as well. Once the reconciliation failed, the replica of Sartori left to the dominions and eventually became the ruler of them as the Autarch. The original Judith became his queen, Quaisoir, while the replica, the Judith we've come to know throughout the book, remained on Earth, bound to the Godolphin family. Sartori convinced Pie to cast a feit on him that caused him to continuously lose his memory of the event. The Autarch wants Gentle to join him <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> to conquer the Fifth Dominion but Gentle refuses. While fleeing, Pie comes across the Autarch, and attacks Gentle when he arrives. Although Gentle is able to convince Pie that it's the real him, the Autarch (referred to from this point on through the rest of the book as 'Sartori') attacks Pie, mortally wounding him, then escapes.|$|E

500|$|Peter, not cowardly {{enough to}} fear an old woman, nor superstitious {{enough to believe}} in her power, {{threaten}}s the old fairy, trying to chase her away. Unfortunately, she does indeed have fairy powers and casts a spell that forces Peter to threaten anyone he encounters or, if alone, to fight imaginary enemies. Peter flees before he can get himself into trouble by threatening anyone bigger than him, calling out challenges <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>goes.</b> Sergeant Klooque approaches the old woman next and tries to use his military charm to win her over. It turns out that she hates soldiers, and she strikes out with her stick, making him duck and dodge. She then casts a spell to make his cringing, dodging and ducking permanent, intending that he lose his reputation and be branded a coward. Pipette arrives and watches his behaviour in astonishment. [...] "He's showing you how he fought the enemy at Johannesburg," [...] exclaims the old lady, but he replies [...] "No, my dear!" [...] I'm showing you how the enemy fought us. This {{is the way they}} retreated". He leaves, cringing and pleading for imaginary attackers to stop <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>goes.</b>|$|E

When he comes back and sees Edna still at the restaurant on the verge of tears, Bart is upset and guilty to see her crying. Meanwhile, Homer resists temptations to curse but nevertheless experiences intense feelings of rage.

500|$|According to screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, Sparrow is a trickster {{who uses}} wit and deceit to attain his goals, preferring to end {{disputes}} verbally instead of by force. He walks {{with a slightly}} drunken swagger and has slurred speech and flailing hand gestures. Sparrow is shrewd, calculating, and eccentric. He fools Norrington and his crew to set sail on the royal ship Interceptor, which compels the admiration of Lieutenant Groves as he concedes: [...] "That's {{got to be the}} best pirate I have ever seen". Norrington himself acquiesces to this praise: [...] "So it would seem", in sharp contrast to what he had previously proclaimed: [...] "You are without doubt the worst pirate I have ever heard of". In the third film, while he leaves Beckett's ship stranded and makes off, Lieutenant Groves asks him: [...] "Do you think he plans it all out, or just makes it up <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> along?" ...|$|E

Some fans felt there was no coherent plan to the main storyline and that Carter was [...] "making it all up <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> along". As for the seventh season, The A.V. Club noted that {{while most of the}} first eight seasons of The X-Files was [...] "good-to-great", the seventh season of the show was [...] "flagging" [...] and possessed [...] "significant problems". Despite this, seasons six and seven included several episodes that were lauded by critics, including the sixth season entries [...] "Triangle" [...] and [...] "The Unnatural", as well as the seventh season installment [...] "X-Cops".|$|E
