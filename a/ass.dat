5|$|The ox and the <b>ass,</b> as well {{as other}} animals, became a part of nativity scene tradition. In a 1415, Corpus Christi celebration, the Ordo paginarum notes that Jesus was lying between an ox and an <b>ass.</b> Other animals {{introduced}} to nativity scenes include elephants and camels.|$|E

5|$|Besides the horse, {{there are}} seven other species of genus Equus in the Equidae family. These are the <b>ass</b> or donkey, Equus asinus; the {{mountain}} zebra, Equus zebra; plains zebra, Equus quagga; Grévy's zebra, Equus grevyi; the kiang, Equus kiang; and the onager, Equus hemionus.|$|E
5|$|Extant wild equines have {{scattered}} ranges across Africa and Asia. The plains zebra {{lives in}} lush grasslands and savannas of Eastern and Southern Africa, while the Mountain zebra inhabits mountainous areas of southwest Africa. The other equine species tend to occupy more arid environments with more scattered vegetation. The Grévy's zebra {{is found in}} thorny scrubland of East Africa, while the African wild <b>ass</b> inhabits rocky deserts of North Africa. The two Asian wild <b>ass</b> species live in the dry deserts of the Near East and Central Asia and the Przwelski's wild horse's habitat is the deserts of Mongolia. Only {{the range of the}} plains and Grévy's zebras overlap. In addition to wild populations, domesticated horses and donkeys are widespread thanks to humans. In certain parts of the world, populations of feral horses and feral donkeys exist, which are descended from domesticated animals that were released or escaped into the wild.|$|E

5|$|Archaeological, biogeographical, and {{linguistic}} evidence {{suggest that the}} donkey was first domesticated by nomadic pastoral people in North Africa over 5,000 years ago. The animals were used to help cope with the increased aridity of the Sahara and the Horn of Africa. Genetic evidence finds that the donkey was domesticated twice based on two distinct mitochondrial DNA haplogroups. It also points to a single ancestor, the Nubian wild <b>ass.</b> Attempts to domesticate zebras were largely unsuccessful, though Walter Rothschild trained some to draw a carriage in England.|$|E
5|$|Horses occur {{naturally}} on the steppes of Central Asia, {{and their}} domestication, around 3,000 BC in the Black Sea and Caspian Sea region, was originally {{as a source}} of meat; use as pack animals and for riding followed. Around the same time, the wild <b>ass</b> was being tamed in Egypt. Camels were domesticated soon after this, with the Bactrian camel in Mongolia and the Arabian camel becoming beasts of burden. By 1000 BC, caravans of Arabian camels were linking India with Mesopotamia and the Mediterranean.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{conflicts}} with its record label and the distributors' refusal to release an album titled Metal Up Your <b>Ass,</b> {{the album was}} renamed Kill 'Em All. It was released on Megaforce Records in the U.S. and on Music for Nations in Europe, and peaked at number 155 on the Billboard 200 in 1986. Although the album was not initially a financial success, it earned Metallica a growing fan base in the underground metal scene. To support the release, Metallica embarked on the Kill 'Em All for One tour with Raven. In February 1984, Metallica supported Venom on the Seven Dates of Hell tour, during which the bands performed in front of 7,000 people at the Aardschok Festival in Zwolle, Netherlands.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Aim was to {{investigate}} the efficacy of heat treatment on microbiological and biochemical quality of <b>ass’s</b> milk and its effects on the growth of 4 different strains of Lac-tobacillus rhamnosus. Milk samples were obtained from 6 machine-milked <b>asses</b> (Martina Franca breed). Low bacterial counts (about 4 x 104 CFU/mL) were observed in raw milk samples likely due to high levels of lysozyme. The possible role of lysozyme was also sug-gested by stable pH values during storage for 15 days. Moreover, <b>ass’s</b> milk demonstrated to be a good growth medium for potentially probiotic strains of L. rhamnosus since pH ran-ged between 3. 67 and 3. 85 for all the tested strains after a 48 -hour period of incubation. Values were stable up {{to the end of the}} trials. Results evidenced that <b>ass’s</b> milk is indeed an excellent candidate for probiotic beverages.

After Solanas demanded financial compensation for the lost script, Warhol hired her to perform in his film, I, a Man, paying her $25. In 1967, Solanas began self-publishing the SCUM Manifesto. Olympia Press owner Maurice Girodias offered to publish Solanas's future writings, and she understood the contract to mean that Girodias would own her writing. Convinced that Girodias and Warhol were conspiring to steal her work, Solanas purchased a gun in the spring of 1968.|$|E

5|$|Humans {{have had}} {{a great impact on}} the populations of wild equines. Threats to wild equines include habitat {{destruction}} and conflicts with local people and livestock. Since the 20th century, wild equines have been decimated over many of their former ranges and their populations scattered. In recent centuries, two subspecies, the quagga and the tarpan, became extinct. Only the plains zebra remains numerous and widespread. The IUCN lists the African wild <b>ass</b> as critically endangered, the Grévy's zebra, mountain zebra and Przewalski's horse as endangered, the Onager as vulnerable, the kiang as lower risk and the plains zebra as least concern. The Przewalski's horse was considered to be extinct in the wild from the 1960s to 1996. However, following successful captive breeding, it has been reintroduced in Mongolia.|$|E
5|$|In China, {{rice and}} millet were domesticated by 8,000 BC, {{followed}} by mung, soy and azuki beans. In the Sahel region of Africa, local rice and sorghum were domesticated by 5,000 BC. Kola nut and coffee were domesticated in Africa. In New Guinea, ancient Papuan peoples began practicing agriculture around 7,000 BC, domesticating sugarcane and taro. In the Indus Valley from the eighth millennium BC onwards at Mehrgarh, 2-row and 6-row barley were cultivated, along with einkorn, emmer, and durum wheats, and dates. In the earliest levels of Merhgarh, wild game such as gazelle, swamp deer, blackbuck, chital, wild <b>ass,</b> wild goat, wild sheep, boar, and nilgai were all hunted for food. These are successively replaced by domesticated sheep, goats, and humped zebu cattle {{by the fifth}} millennium BC, indicating the gradual transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture.|$|E
5|$|In Grévy's zebras and {{the wild}} <b>ass</b> species, adults have more fluid {{associations}} and adult males will establish large territories and monopolize the females that enter them. These species live in habitats with sparser resources and standing water and grazing areas may be separated. Groups of lactating females are able to remain in groups with non-lactating ones and usually gather at foraging areas. The most dominant males establish territories near watering holes, where more sexually receptive females gather. Subdominants have territories farther away, near foraging areas. Mares may wander through several territories but will remain in one when they have young. Staying in a territory offers a female protection from harassment by outside males, as well as access to a renewable resource. Some feral populations of horse exhibit features of both the harem and territorial social systems.|$|E
