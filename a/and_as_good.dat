She has {{appeared in}} several films, including City Slickers, Just Write, Toys <b>and</b> <b>As</b> <b>Good</b> as It Gets. In 2004, Smith performed her own off-Broadway one-woman show entitled More at the Union Square Theatre in New York City. Aside from The Simpsons, Smith has recorded few voice-over parts, only commercials and the film We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story. Smith starred in and served as executive producer for the independent romantic comedy Waiting For Ophelia, which had its world premiere at the Phoenix Film Festival in April 2009.|$|E

25|$|By long {{tradition}} the Victoria–New South Wales Sheffield Shield match began on Boxing Day at the MCG, {{much to the}} chagin of the NSW players who missed Christmas with their families as a result. But with six Tests {{to fit into the}} season this game was moved and the Third Test was held instead, thus beginning the current tradition of the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne. Australia kept and unchanged team from Perth, but the England team had a few changes. Dennis Amiss and John Edrich had recovered enough to play again after having their hands broken in the First Test at Brisbane, though Edrich's hand was still sore. The out of form Brian Luckhurst and Keith Fletcher were dropped to make room. Geoff Arnold and Chris Old were also dropped as the now fit Mike Hendrick and the spinner Derek Underwood returned to the team, Old somewhat unfairly as he had played well at Perth. This gave England only two fast bowlers, Bob Willis and Arnold, the medium pace and off-cutters of Tony Greig and the spin of Fred Titmus and Underwood. The Melbourne Cricket Ground was slower than it had ever been, with low bounce that would limit the effectiveness of the Australian fast bowling attack. Ian Chappell won the toss {{for the third time in}} a row and became the first captain in history to put the opposition in to bat in successive Tests. The day was overcast <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> for bowling as it would ever be at the MCG and Chappell was confident in the strength of his bowling attack and the fragility of the English batting.|$|E

500|$|Zduhaći were {{regarded}} as a blessing for their home and village, as guardians of the prosperity and well-being of their region, <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>good,</b> honest, just, and law-obeying people. In the region of Birač, zduhaći were said to meet with angels [...] "on the leaves of high and thick branches". They were sometimes thought to have a prophetic gift. However, a zduhać could ally himself with the Devil, and use his innate power {{in accordance with the}} Devil's directions. That zduhać was doomed to turn into a vampire, unless he confessed and repented. Some influential historical persons were believed to have been zduhaći, such as warrior and writer Marko Miljanov, and Petar I Petrović-Njegoš, who was the Prince-Bishop of Montenegro from 1784 to 1830.|$|E
500|$|The film {{garnered}} more praise than I'll Do Anything and Brooks {{was again}} {{nominated for the}} Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay.

Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader labelled it Brooks' best film, stating [...] "what Brooks manages to do with [...] as they struggle mightily to {{connect with one another}} is funny, painful, beautiful, and basically truthful—a triumph for everyone involved." [...] It also ranked 140 in Empire 2008 list of [...] "The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time".

500|$|An 1837 essay of his, {{centered}} on a debate regarding the translation of Homer's works into Romanian, featured a series of counsels to younger writers: [...] "This {{is not the time}} for criticism, children, it is the time for writing, so write as much <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> as you can, but without meanness; create, do not ruin; for the nation receives and blesses the maker and curses the destroyer. Write with a clear conscience". Paraphrased as [...] "Write anything, boys, as long as you go on writing!" [...] (Scrieţi, băieţi, orice, numai scrieţi!), this quote became the topic of derision in later decades, and was hailed as an example of Heliade's failure to distinguish between quality and quantity. The latter verdict was considered unfair by the literary historian Şerban Cioculescu and others, who argued that Ion Heliade Rădulescu's main goal was to encourage the rapid development of local literature to a European level. Although he recognized, among other things, Heliade's merits of having removed pretentious boyar discourse from poetry and having favored regular rhyme, Paul Zarifopol accused him and Gheorghe Asachi of [...] "tastelessness" [...] and [...] "literary insecurity". He elaborated: [...] "Rădulescu was arguably afflicted with this sin more than Asachi, given his unfortunate ambitions of fabricating a literary language".|$|E

IGN also called the game incomparable and peerless. GameSpot later called the game [...] "a towering achievement in the history of role-playing games." [...] Computer Gaming Worlds reviewer felt though the game was worthy being called the best game of the year <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> as games such as Fallout, , and Betrayal at Krondor, [...] "I won't trap myself with the 'best RPG ever' phrase." [...] He also felt the game's story was somewhere between Planescape: Torment and Icewind Dale in terms of depth. Eurogamer lavished much praise upon the game, and noted that [...] "the story and quests are captivating, the gameplay tried and tested, and the overall feel is professional and entertaining." [...] In a 2007 Gamasutra article on the [...] "Platinum and Modern Ages" [...] of computer role-playing games (CRPGs), Matt Barton noted contemporary reviewers' universal praise for the game, and said, [...] "I consider it the finest CRPG ever designed."

500|$|Koubek's D.C. area output slowed in {{the late}} 1960s. In February 1967, the Bureau of National Affairs (a privately held {{publisher}} of government news) commissioned him to design a six-story Modernist building at 1231 25th Street NW. (This glass-and-white concrete neo-Brutalist building was stripped to its frame in 2007, four floors added, and joined to both an existing and a new structure to create luxury apartments.) In October 1967, construction began on his design for 1401 I Street NW, west of Franklin Square. (The bland glass-and-steel box underwent a multimillion-dollar renovation in 1991. It was given a postmodern facade of finished grey concrete panels and brown granite, the center portion of the building on {{the south and east}} sides extended slightly outward to break up the flatness of the building, and twin giant six-story-high non-structural Doric columns topped by a non-structural colonnade and entablature. The building is now called Franklin Tower.) In December 1967, Koubek designed a new home for the Motion Picture Association of America at 1601 I Street NW, described as a [...] "bronze-tinted glass box on stilts enclosed by a bold screen of tan concrete". Another critic later called it [...] "elegant" [...] <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> as the work of I. M. Pei. Construction began in February 1968 on his building for One Dupont Circle NW, an eight-story office building with vertical concrete ribs over glass walls.|$|E
500|$|... "Redux II" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode an A rating {{and noted that}} [...] "whatever reservations I may have over a three-episode story arc, this final entry {{does a good job}} of re-investing us in the show's basic ideals, returning us to a rough form of the status quo in a way that's exciting, emotionally powerful, and satisfying despite only incremental forward momentum". In addition, Handlen praised David Duchovny's performance, stating that he [...] "was on fire the whole episode". Tom Kessenich praised {{the second part of the}} episode and wrote [...] "'Redux II' is the standout hour of the two without question. With Scully on her deathbed, Mulder meets his sister only to lose her again and is put in a position where he may deal with the devil. The finale moments [...] are quite simply perfect <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> as any the show ever produced." [...] Shearman and Pearson rated the episode two-and-a-half stars out of five. The two noted [...] " [...] is a likable enough little romp, but it's too leisurely to be exciting, too predictable to be revealing, and–most crucially, not really funny enough to be comedy. Vitaris gave the second part of the episode a slightly less negative review than the first, but only awarded it one-and-a-half stars out of four. She criticized the ending, noting that [...] "it's all wrapped up neatly yet ambiguously." [...] However, Vitaris did note that [...] "what makes 'Redux II' tolerable is Duchovny, who always hits the right notes of anger, despair, grief, relief, or emotional numbness." [...] In the 1999 FX Thanksgiving Marathon, containing fan-selected episodes, [...] "Redux II" [...] (along with [...] "Gethsemane" [...] and [...] "Redux") was presented as the [...] "Best Mythology Episode".|$|E

500|$|The early {{ports of}} the game also {{received}} high reviews, though their sales {{have been described as}} [...] "dismal". The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly called the Super NES version a good conversion that retained the good music, huge levels, and overall fun of the original game and dismissed the censoring in the version as inconsequential. The magazine rated the Jaguar version similarly, commenting that the graphics and audio were superior to other versions {{of the game}}, but criticizing the faster movement of the player character as making it less fun to play. A GamePro review of the Jaguar port was highly complimentary, saying Wolfenstein 3D [...] "set a new standard for PC gaming" [...] and that the Jaguar version was the best to date, and better than the original due to its increased graphics and sound capabilities. Major Mike of GamePro commended the 3DO version's complete absence of pixelation, fast scaling, [...] "rousing" [...] music, and high quality sound effects, but criticized the controls as overly sensitive. He concluded that the game, then over three years old, [...] "still packs a punch as a first-person shooter". Wolfenstein 3D won GamePros Best 3DO Game of 1995 award, beating the acclaimed The Need for Speed and D. Maximum, on the other hand, while stating that the 3DO port was better than the original <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>good</b> as the Jaguar version, felt that it was so aged compared to recent releases like [...] and the PlayStation version of Doom that a new port was pointless, with the game now [...] "somewhat tiresome and very, very repetitive". A reviewer for Next Generation asserted that Wolfenstein 3D was [...] "still as addictive as it ever was" [...] but essentially agreed with Maximum, contending that anyone interested in first-person shooters would have either already played it on another platform or [...] "moved on" [...] to more advanced games in the genre. A more modern review by Daemon Hatfield of IGN gave the PlayStation Network release of the game a warm reception, saying that while it was [...] "dated and flawed", it was [...] "required playing for any first-person shooter fan".|$|E

A storyline with Bam Bam Bigelow saw him on the end of two pay-per-views defeats, however, at Hardcore Heaven <b>and</b> <b>As</b> <b>Good</b> as it Gets. In one memorable moment in not only Spike's career but in ECW history in general, Bam Bam Bigelow threw Spike from the ring, over the top rope, and into the crowd.
