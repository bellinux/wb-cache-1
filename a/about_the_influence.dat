5|$|Scholars {{have long}} speculated <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> – if any – of Hamnet's death upon William Shakespeare's writing. Unlike his {{contemporary}} Ben Jonson, {{who wrote a}} lengthy piece {{on the death of}} his own son, Shakespeare, if he wrote anything in response, did so more subtly. At the time his son died, Shakespeare was writing primarily comedies, and that writing continued until a few years after Hamnet's death, when his major tragedies were written. It is possible that his tragedies gained depth from his experience.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the war, {{the couple}} {{returned}} to France and spent the remainder of their lives essentially in retirement as the Duke never occupied another official role after his wartime governorship of the Bahamas. Correspondence between the Duke and Kenneth de Courcy, dated between 1946 and 1949, emerged in a US library in 2009. The letters suggest a plot where the Duke would return to England and place himself in a position for a possible regency. The health of George VI was failing and de Courcy was concerned <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> of the Mountbatten family over the young Princess Elizabeth. De Courcy suggested that the Duke buy a working agricultural estate within an easy drive of London in order to gain favour with the British public and make himself available should the King become incapacitated. The Duke however hesitated and the King recovered from his surgery.|$|E

5|$|Skyscraper Museum {{director}} Carol Willis, and art consultant Franck Mercurio, {{curator at}} the Field Museum in Chicago, offer moderating modern views <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> of Saarinen's design. Willis notes that setback architecture was being implemented in New York City highrises because of 1916 zoning ordinances related to building height and sunlight, and that Saarinen's design was understood to be an embodiment of this trend. Mercurio points to the Tribune Tower competition entry from American architect Bertram Goodhue as having the same modernist features as Saarinen's, with dramatic setbacks but a more pronounced simplification of the exterior. Mercurio argues that Goodhue's design is a better example of modernism because it has less ornamentation. Goodhue's entry gained him honorable mention but no cash award.|$|E

25|$|When Buddhism came to China, it {{was adapted}} to the Chinese culture and understanding. Theories <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> of other schools in the {{evolution}} of Chan vary widely and heavily reliant upon speculative correlation rather than on written records or histories. Some scholars have argued that Chan developed from the interaction between Mahāyāna Buddhism and Taoism, while others insist that Chan has roots in yogic practices, specifically , the consideration of objects, and , total fixation of the mind. A number of other conflicting theories exist.|$|E
25|$|The new pope, Clement X, worried <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> of theatre {{on public}} morals.

He forbade women to perform with song or acting, and the wearing of decolleté dresses. Christina considered this sheer nonsense, and let women perform in her palace. In 1675 she invited António Vieira to become her confessor.|$|E

25|$|During {{the early}} 19th century, general Andrew Jackson {{exceeded}} his authority on numerous times and attacked American Indian tribes {{as well as}} invaded the Spanish territory of Florida without official government permission. Jackson was not reprimanded or punished for exceeding his authority. Some accounts blame newspaper journalism called yellow journalism for whipping up virulent pro-war sentiment to help instigate the Spanish–American War. Some critics suggest foreign policy is manipulated by lobbies, such as the pro-Israel lobby or the Arab one, although there is disagreement <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> of such lobbies.

25|$|Speculation {{was also}} raised <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> Erdoğan {{had over the}} AKP campaign.

After openly criticising {{the government for the}} Solution process, Erdoğan also openly denied the existence of a 'Kurdish problem' to win back nationalist votes, which faced open criticism from Deputy Prime Minister Bülent Arınç. Commentators observed a split between Erdoğan and the government {{on the issue of the}} party's candidates, with Erdoğan allegedly threatening to put Ahmet Davutoğlu in a 'worse situation than Ecevit' if 25 candidates close to Arınç were not removed from the party lists.|$|E

25|$|During {{the course}} of the Korean War, the Menzies Government {{attempted}} to ban the Communist Party of Australia, first by legislation in 1950 and later by referendum, in 1951. While both attempts were unsuccessful, further international events such as the defection of minor Soviet Embassy official Vladimir Petrov, added to a sense of impending threat that politically favoured Menzies’ Liberal-CP government, as the Labor Party pushed centralist economics and split over concerns <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>influence</b> of the Communist Party over the Trade Union movement, resulting in the a bitter split in 1955 and the emergence of the breakaway Democratic Labor Party (DLP). The DLP remained an influential political force, often holding {{the balance of power in}} the Senate, until 1974. Its preferences supported the Liberal and Country Party. The Labor party was led by H.V. Evatt after Chifley's death in 1951. Evatt retired in 1960, and Arthur Calwell succeeded him as leader, with a young Gough Whitlam as his deputy.|$|E
