5|$|During the Great Patriotic War, a {{mounting}} of 15–40mm appliqué armour {{on about}} a hundred different T-26s was performed by local factories in Leningrad in 1941–1942, during the Siege of Odessa (1941), the Battle for Moscow and the Siege of Sevastopol (1941–1942). <b>A</b> <b>cutting</b> of armoured plates was more rough than developed during the Winter War; {{the majority of these}} modified tanks did not have a moving armoured gun mask as seen in Factory No. 174's original design, and some tanks had front appliqué armour only.|$|E
5|$|In 1910 the new Bicester {{cut-off line}} of the GWR Chiltern Main Line opened, {{allowing}} trains from London to Birmingham to bypass a long curve through Oxford. The new line was routed directly through Wood Siding, although no interchange station was built. The GWR ran in <b>a</b> <b>cutting</b> beneath the existing station; Wood Siding station and its siding were rebuilt at the GWR's expense between 1908–1910 to stand on a wide bridge above the GWR's line. The new line included the station named Brill and Ludgershall, which in reality was considerably further from Brill than the existing Brill station.|$|E
5|$|The {{station has}} two {{platforms}} positioned in <b>a</b> <b>cutting</b> partially {{covered with a}} glazed roof and partially exposed to the atmosphere. It was designed by John Fowler the MR's chief engineer. The brick-built street-level entrance building featured a balustrade {{along the edge of}} the roof decoratively topped with urns. Fowler's building was demolished and reconstructed to a design by the MR's architect Charles W Clark in 1914 with a cladding of white faïence blocks. The building is listed Grade II by Historic England. The brickwork of the platform retaining walls was restored in 1986 during a renovation of the station.|$|E

40|$|For cake cutting, {{cuts are}} {{parallel}} to an axis and yield rectangular pieces. <b>As</b> such, <b>cutting</b> <b>a</b> cake {{is viewed as}} dividing a line segment. For pie cutting, cuts are radial {{from the center of}} a disc to the circumference and yield sectors or wedge-shaped pieces. <b>As</b> such, <b>cutting</b> <b>a</b> pie is viewed as dividing a circle. There is clearly <b>a</b> relationship between <b>cutting</b> <b>a</b> cake and <b>cutting</b> <b>a</b> pie. Once a circular pie has a single cut, then it can be straightened out into a segment, looking like a cake. Isn 2 ̆ 7 t a cake just a pie that has been cut? Gale (1993) suggested that this topology was a significant difference. This note is to summarize and compare some of the recent results on pie cutting that appear in Barbanel and Brams (2007) and Brams, Jones, and Klamler (2007). The geometric framework presented in Barbanel and Brams (2007) is used to prove and to explain results in Brams, Jones, and Klamler (2007) ...|$|R

Throughout the 1990 season, the Bills' {{emergence}} as a championship caliber team {{had been one of the}} largest storylines. The Bills had <b>a</b> <b>cutting</b> edge, no-huddle offense, led by head coach Marv Levy, quarterback Jim Kelly, running back Thurman Thomas, wide receiver Andre Reed and an offensive line led by Kent Hull. They had also recorded a 13–3 record during the 1990 season, culminating with a 51–3 victory over the Los Angeles Raiders in the AFC Championship game. Heading into the game the Bills were installed as seven point favorites.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the most}} {{powerful}} individual in the Roman Empire, Augustus wished to embody the spirit of Republican virtue and norms. He also wanted to relate to and connect with {{the concerns of the}} plebs and lay people. He achieved this through various means of generosity and <b>a</b> <b>cutting</b> back of lavish excess. In the year 29BC, Augustus paid 400 sesterces each to 250,000 citizens, 1,000 sesterces each to 120,000 veterans in the colonies, and spent 700 million sesterces in purchasing land for his soldiers to settle upon. He also restored 82 different temples to display his care for the Roman pantheon of deities. In 28BC, he melted down 80 silver statues erected in his likeness and in honor of him, an attempt of his to appear frugal and modest.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, {{the down}} became {{the site of}} a major road protest against the {{completion}} of a section of the M3 motorway from London to the south coast of England. There had been plans since the 1970s to replace an earlier 1930s-built bypass of Winchester, which became regularly congested due to design features that had become out of date. This became problematic {{due to the lack of}} available land between Winchester College and St. Catherine's Hill. After several public inquiries, particularly with problems using the water meadows near the college, a route was chosen that took the motorway over the down, ultimately in <b>a</b> <b>cutting.</b> Although protesting against the M3 had been ongoing since the early 1970s, the protest-action on top of the down, described in 1994 as the most controversial British motorway project ever to start construction, attracted a wider group of classes of people than had previously been the case, and included physical violence from onsite security officers.|$|E

5|$|Production of {{components}} would be split between Breguet and BAC, and the aircraft themselves would be assembled on two production lines; {{one in the}} UK and one in France, To avoid any duplication of work, each aircraft component had only one source. The British light strike/tactical support versions were the most demanding design, requiring supersonic performance, superior avionics, <b>a</b> <b>cutting</b> edge nav/attack system of more accuracy and complexity than the French version, moving map display, laser range-finder and marked-target seeker (LRMTS). As a result, the initial Br.121 design needed a thinner wing, redesigned fuselage, a higher rear cockpit, and after-burning engines. While putting on smiling faces for the public, maintaining {{the illusion of a}} shared design, the British design de facto departed from the French sub-sonic Breguet 121 {{to such a degree that}} it was for all intents and purposes a new design.|$|E
5|$|The {{purposes}} of bonsai are primarily contemplation (for the viewer) and the pleasant exercise {{of effort and}} ingenuity (for the grower). Bonsai practice focuses on long-term cultivation and shaping {{of one or more}} small trees growing in a container, beginning with <b>a</b> <b>cutting,</b> seedling, or small tree of a species suitable for bonsai development. Bonsai can be created from nearly any perennial woody-stemmed tree or shrub species that produces true branches and can be cultivated to remain small through pot confinement with crown and root pruning. Some species are popular as bonsai material because they have characteristics, such as small leaves or needles, that make them appropriate for the compact visual scope of bonsai and a miniature deciduous forest can even be created using such species as Japanese maple, Japanese zelkova or hornbeam.|$|E
5|$|The talonid, {{another group}} of cusps, makes {{up the back of}} the tooth. It is wider than long and {{contains}} a well-developed cusp, the hypoconid, on the outer side and a depression, the talonid basin, in the middle. The cristid obliqua connects to the hypoconid. The smaller hypoconulid cusp is present towards the inner side of the tooth, and the hypoconid and hypoconulid are connected by <b>a</b> <b>cutting</b> edge which is suggestive of the presence of a metacone cusp on the upper molars. Further towards the inner side, a crest, the entocristid, rims the talonid basin; on m1, it is swollen and on m2, it contains two small cuspules, but a distinct entoconid cusp is absent. This entocristid is continuous with the lingual cingulum.|$|E

5|$|In the 1967/68 season, John left Llanelli {{and joined}} Cardiff, where he formed a {{partnership}} with Gareth Edwards. Although John and Edwards later became the scourge of New Zealand, their first international pairing had an inauspicious start. On 11 November 1967, the pair played their first international together, facing Brian Lochore's touring New Zealand team. Edwards, like John, had two international games to his name, paired with Watkins {{in the final two}} matches of the 1967 Five Nations Championship. John regained his international place after Watkins had switched to professional rugby league just the month before, joining Salford for a club record fee of £16,000. Wales had an error-strewn game, in a match played in <b>a</b> <b>cutting,</b> rain-laden wind which turned the pitch into a muddy field. Wales captain Norman Gale won the toss and chose to play the first half into the gale, and finished the half 8–0 down. John raised Welsh hopes with an early dropped goal, his first international points, but a panicked blind back pass from Wales' number8, John Jeffery, gifted Bill Davies an easy try. The game ended 13–6 to New Zealand, with Edwards looking uncomfortable throughout, and John's kicking inaccurate, there was little to suggest the pair would become one of the great half-back pairings in rugby history.|$|E

25|$|Thread forming is {{performed}} using a , or , which closely resembles <b>a</b> <b>cutting</b> tap without the flutes. There are lobes periodically spaced around the tap that actually do the thread forming as the tap is advanced into a properly sized hole. Since the tap does not produce chips, {{there is no need}} to periodically back out the tap to clear away chips, which, in <b>a</b> <b>cutting</b> tap, can jam and break the tap. Thus thread forming is particularly suited to tapping blind holes, which are tougher to tap with <b>a</b> <b>cutting</b> tap due to the chip build-up in the hole. Note that the tap drill size differs from that used for <b>a</b> <b>cutting</b> tap and that an accurate hole size is required because a slightly undersized hole can break the tap. Proper lubrication is essential because of the frictional forces involved, therefore a lubricating oil is used instead of cutting oil.|$|E
