The logo watermark is embedded into all sub-blocks of the LLn sub-band of the transformed host image, using quantization technique. Extracted logos from all sub-blocks are mixed {{to make the}} extracted watermark from distorted watermarked image. Knowing the quantization step-size, dimensions of logo {{and the level of}} wavelet transform, the watermark is extracted, without any need to have access to the original image.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} steps in image analysis is the automated detection of lesion borders. Early detection of melanoma {{is one of the greatest}} challenges of dermatological practice today. Accurate image segmentation of skin lesions is one of the key steps for useful, early, and non-invasive diagnosis of coetaneous melanomas. The medical images generally are bound to contain noise while acquisition. This paper proposes a robust and efficient image segmentation algorithm to extract the true border of noisy clinical skin images containing lesions, that reveals the global structure irregularity, which may suggest excessive cell growth or regression of a melanoma. The proposed segmentation algorithm is applied to a RGB image containing the lesion, where the RGB image is converted to grayscale intensity image by eliminating the hue and saturation information while retaining the luminance <b>and</b> <b>adds</b> <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> <b>pepper</b> noise to the image and uses background noise reduction techniques to filter noise. The proposed algorithm converts an image to a binary image, based on threshold, and finds edges in the image using canny method and traces the object in the image. To verify the capability of the segmentation algorithm in detecting the borders of the lesions for skin lesion diagnosis, the algorithms was applied on diversity of clinical skin images containing lesions. The results demonstrate the successful border detection of real skin lesions by the proposed segmentation algorithm for noisy clinical skin images and make them accessible for further analysis and research...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA {{biometric}} template is a digital reference of distinct characteristics that are extracted from a biometric sample. The feature set obtained during enrollment {{is stored in}} the system database as a template. Disparate passwords, when {{biometric template}}s are compromised, it is not feasible for a valid user to rescind his biometric identifiers and change to another set of uncompromised identifiers. Due to this irrevocable nature of biometric data, attacks against the stored templates constitute a major security and privacy peril in a biometric system. The primary aim {{of this paper is}} to propose a novel technique for security of templates by using fuzzy vault implementation. The first proposed approach is used to extract the feature point from finger knuckle print (FKP). This approach uses an image processing techniques to extract the biometric feature from the user's finger knuckle print. The second approach is one of unimodal fuzzy vault implementation. Fuzzy vault is a cryptographic framework that binds the biometric template with a uniformly random key to build a secure sketch of the template. Only the secure sketch is stored and if the original template is uniformly random, it is not feasible to retrieve either the template or the key without any knowledge of the user's biometric data. The performances of the proposed approaches are evaluated using the experimental observation. The simplicity and efficiency of the proposed methods make it readily applicable in various security fields. The performance of the proposed fuzzy vault implementation has been evaluated for Hong Kong polytechnic university FKP database. In this fuzzy vault implementation for biometric evaluation the performance metrics used are Failure-to-Capture Rate (FTCR), Genuine Accept Rate (GAR) and False Accept Rate (FAR) Performance analysis is carried out in two phases. In the initial phase, the secret key size is varied and the results are obtained. In phase two, the effect of <b>adding</b> <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> <b>pepper</b> noise is considered.

It {{can be seen}} from the filtering result that the extreme median filtering smoothed the image, which improves the filtering effect, improves the sharpness of the image, and maintains a good output signal-to-noise ratio. The improved Canny operator edge detection method proposed in this paper uses extreme median filtering to smooth the image, the weighting coefficient calculation method calculates the gradient amplitude and direction, and the edge detection high and low threshold is determined by the improved iterative threshold segmentation method. The method improves the accuracy of image edge detection and can achieve good image edge detection effect.|$|R

As {{the precision of}} encoders depends on the uniformity of grating pitches, {{it is essential to}} evaluate pitches accurately. We use a CCD image sensor to acquire grating image for evaluating the pitches with high precision. Digital image correlation technique is applied to filter out the noises. We propose three methods for determining the pitches of grating with peak positions of correlation coefficients. Numerical simulation indicated the average of pitch deviations from the true pitch and the pitch variations are less than 0. 02 pixel and 0. 1 pixel for these three methods when the ideal grating image is <b>added</b> with <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> <b>pepper</b> noise, speckle noise, and Gaussian noise. Experimental results demonstrated that our method can measure the pitch of the grating accurately, for example, our home-made grating with 20 mu m period has 475 nm peak-to-valley uniformity with 40 nm standard deviation during 35 mm range. Another measurement illustrated that our home- made grating has 40 nm peak-to-valley uniformity with 10 nm standard deviation. This work verified that our lab can fabricate high-accuracy gratings which should be interesting for practical application in optical encoders...|$|R

Neural Network with various architectures and Training algorithms have successfully been applied for letter or character recognition [1].

This paper uses hamming netwok to recognize noisy numerals. The proposed algorithm will design a system which associates every fundamental pattern with itself. That is, when presented with xi as input, the system should produce xi at the output. In addition, when presented with a noisy (corrupted) version of xi at the input, the system should also produce xi at the output.

40|$|Due {{to their}} {{uniqueness}} and high value commercially, logos/trademarks {{play a key}} role in e-business based global marketing. However, existing trademark/logo retrieval techniques and content-based image retrieval methods are mostly designed for generic images, which cannot provide effective retrieval of trademarks/logos. Although color and spatial features have been intensively investigated for logo image retrieval, in most cases they were applied separately. When these are combined in a fused manner, a fixed weighting is normally used between them which cannot reflect the significance of these features in the images. When the image quality is degraded by various reasons such as noise, the reliability of color and spatial features may change in different ways, such that the weights between them should be adapted to such changes. In this paper, adaptive fusion of color and spatial descriptors is proposed for colored logo/trademark image retrieval. First, color quantization and k-means are combined for effective dominant color extraction. For each extracted dominant color, a component-based spatial descriptor is derived for local features. By analyzing the image histogram, an adaptive fusion of these two features is achieved for more effective logo abstraction and more accurate image retrieval. The proposed approach has been tested on a database containing over 2300 logo/trademark images. Experimental results have shown that the proposed methodology yields improved retrieval precision and outperforms three state-of-the-art techniques even with <b>added</b> Gaussian, <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> <b>pepper,</b> <b>and</b> speckle noise...|$|R

Steganography {{is one of the}} info concealing technique; here any form of signal is concealing by exploitation a picture, audio or video. In an exceedingly spatial domain steganography, most typically the info is embedded into a LSB’s of the cover image pixels. As a result of it maintain the standard of the stego image as like as cover image instead of embedded into MSB’s. To embedding into a LSB’s of cover image (R, G, B plane) researchers are using different types of pixel indicating methods, random embedding, edge based embedding in spatial domain or applying completely different reworks in transform domain. In this paper, for spatial domain steganography noise based embedding technique is proposed; it is entirely different from the out there techniques.
