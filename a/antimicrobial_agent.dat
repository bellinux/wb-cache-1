25|$|<b>Antimicrobial</b> <b>agent</b> has obvious {{implications}} for microbial infection therapeutics. The ability of bacteria to decrease their susceptibility to antimicrobial drugs importantly affects both bacterial ecology {{and the treatment}} of infectious diseases. From patients who are treated with antibiotics, filamentous organisms are commonly found in their clinical specimens. The filamentation contributes to a pathogen’s resistance to this <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>agent.</b> The induction of bacterial filamentation by antibiotics can alter bacterial virulence, which would have important {{implications for}} the pathogenesis and treatment of the disease as well.|$|E

40|$|<b>Antimicrobial</b> <b>agents</b> {{sometimes}} {{cause the}} adverse effects of diarrhea and loose stool. Antibiotic-resistant lactic acid bacteria are used to prevent these adverse effects. The bacteria are not resistant to several <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>agents,</b> although the bacterium preparations are sometimes prescribed the <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>agents</b> concomitantly. Therefore this paper reports that the minimal inhibitory concentration of three new <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>agents</b> against antibiotic-resistant lactic acid bacteria were determined using a microdilution method with cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth. Furthermore, we investigated <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>agents</b> that are prescribed concomitantly with antibiotic-resistant lactic acid bacterium preparations or a clostridium butyricum preparation. The bacteria were susceptible to the three new <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>agents.</b> Approximately 50 % of the bacterium preparations were prescribed alone, and 30 % were prescribed concomitantly with <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>agents</b> that show <b>antimicrobial</b> activity against the bacteria. Consequently, we suggest that pharmacists need to confirm prescriptions and to provide more drug information on antibiotic-resistant lactic acid bacterium preparations...|$|R

40|$|Background: Antimicrobial {{resistance}} {{is a global}} problem {{and the need for}} new <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>agents</b> is greater in both developed and developing nations. However, there is a difference in timing of introduction of new <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>agents</b> between India and developed markets. Aim: Assess the drug lag for new <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>agents</b> approved in the United States, European Union and India. Materials and Methods: The new <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>agents</b> approved in the United States, European Union and India between 1999 and 2011 were identified and information was gathered primarily from the websites of regulatory agencies of the three regions. We assessed absolute and relative drug lag for new <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>agents</b> approved in the three regions. Results: Of the 70 new <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>agents,</b> 59 (84. 28 %) were approved in the United States, 59 (84. 28 %) in the European Union and 58 (82. 85 %) in India. The median approval lag for India (39. 7 months) was substantially high as compared to the United States (0 month) and European Union (6. 5 months). Conclusion: This study confirms that India&# 8217;s drug lag in the case of new <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>agents</b> is quite substantial. Further detailed analyses are necessary to find the background factors and impacts of drug lag for <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>agents</b> in India.

25|$|Catalase {{is usually}} {{located in a}} {{cellular}} organelle called the peroxisome. Peroxisomes in plant cells are involved in photorespiration (the use of oxygen and production of carbon dioxide) and symbiotic nitrogen fixation (the breaking apart of diatomic nitrogen (N2) to reactive nitrogen atoms).

40|$|The {{doubling}} {{times of}} bacteria at sites of colonization or infection are considerably longer {{than those in}} laboratory culture media, and slow growth reduces the susceptibility of bacteria to <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>agents.</b> Helicobacter pylori is susceptible {{to a wide range}} of <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>agents</b> in vitro; however, tests for inhibitory activity do not adequately predict which <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>agents</b> will eradicate slowly growing H. pylori from the stomachs of patients. The chemostat can be used to compare the bactericidal activities of antimicrobial substances against slowly growing bacteria. In this study we compared the bactericidal activities of <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>agents</b> against slowly growing H. pylori. The bactericidal activities of erythromycin, minocycline, ampicillin, amoxicillin, cefixime, metronidazole, and bismuth subcitrate against slowly growing H. pylori NCTC 11, 637 in a chemostat were compared. <b>Antimicrobial</b> <b>agents</b> were added to the system at four to eight times the MIC. Exposure of H. pylori to metronidazole was associated with the rapid development of metronidazole resistance, preventing assessment of the bactericidal activity of metronidazole. Resistance to the other <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>agents</b> tested did not develop. The poor bactericidal activities of the <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>agents</b> against slowly growing H. pylori may be a contributory factor in limiting their clinical efficacies. Of the agents tested, only amoxicillin and bismuth subcitrate showed bactericidal activity against slowly growing H. pylori. The chemostat allows comparison of the bactericidal activities of <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>agents</b> against slowly growing H. pylori and may therefore provide results which more accurately identify those agents or combinations of agents that will eradicate H. pylori from patients...|$|R

40|$|SummarySerious infections {{caused by}} Gram-positive {{bacteria}} are currently difficult to treat {{because many of}} these pathogens are now resistant to standard <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>agents.</b> As {{a result of the}} emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens, new <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>agents</b> are urgently needed for clinical use. In recent years, there has been {{an increase in the number}} of drugs that have activity against these Gram-positive pathogens. Daptomycin, tigecycline, linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin and dalbavancin are five <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>agents</b> that are useful for the treatment of infections due to drug-resistant Gram-positive cocci.

Recent studies have also shown that Prunus mume extract may inhibit Helicobacter pylori, associated with gastritis and gastric ulcers.

Natural GSE has no antimicrobial properties. Newer studies found many commercial grapefruit seed extracts contaminated with synthetic preservatives. In a 2007 study the main synthetic <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>agent</b> identified in commercial GSE samples was benzethonium chloride.

40|$|<b>Antimicrobial</b> <b>agents</b> {{target a}} range of extra- and/or {{intracellular}} loci from cytoplasmic wall to membrane, intracellular enzymes and genetic materials. Meanwhile, many resistance mechanisms employed by bacteria to counter <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>agents</b> have been found and reported in the past decades.
