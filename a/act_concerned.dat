50|$|The Sex Discrimination Act 1975 (c. 65) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom which {{protected}} men {{and women}} from discrimination on the grounds of sex or marital status. The <b>Act</b> <b>concerned</b> employment, training, education, harassment, the provision of goods and services, and the disposal of premises. The Gender Recognition Act 2004 and The Sex Discrimination Act 1975 (Amendment) Regulations 2008 amended parts of this Act to apply to transsexual people. Other amendments were introduced by the Sex Discrimination Act 1986, the Employment Act 1989, the Equality Act 2006, and other legislation such as rulings by the European Court of Justice.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first three}} {{sections}} of the 1793 <b>act</b> <b>concerned</b> {{the structure of the}} court system. The first section authorised circuit courts to function with only one Supreme Court justice. With some exceptions in outlying areas, Supreme Court justices continued to sit as circuit court judges, one per circuit, until the Judiciary Act of 1891 created the courts of appeals. [...] Since courts with two judges (one Supreme Court justice, one district court judge) could cast tie votes, the second section stated rules for those. The third authorised and regulated special circuit court sessions for criminal cases, to be held at more convenient places or times than the statutory regular sessions offered.|$|E
5000|$|Ritchie J., {{writing for}} the {{majority}} found that the pith and substance of the <b>Act</b> <b>concerned</b> the [...] "regulation, supervision and control" [...] of film, a form of private property, in the province. Consequently, the law was strictly a matter of Property and Civil Rights, a matter {{that was in the}} exclusive jurisdiction of the province. Further, Ritchie applied the definition of Criminal law from the Margarine Reference case which required that a criminal law must concern the public interest and must consist of a prohibition with a penalty. Ritchie found that there was no clear prohibition because the law did not provide details on what was prohibited, rather, it left it to the discretion of the board.|$|E

While {{considering}} appropriations for Utah Territory, Representative Justin Smith Morrill criticized The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for its laws on Indian slavery. He said that the laws were unconcerned {{about the way the}} Indian slaves were captured, noting that the only requirement was that the Indian be possessed by a white person through purchase or otherwise. He said that Utah was the only American government to enslave Indians, and said that state-sanctioned slavery [...] "is a dreg placed {{at the bottom of the}} cup by Utah alone". [...] The Republicans' abhorrence of slavery in Utah delayed Utah's entrance as a state into the Union.|$|E
5000|$|Chief Justice Fauteux, {{held that}} the Act {{had an effect on}} inter-provincial trade and so it could not be upheld as a [...] "matter of a local nature" [...] under section 92 (16) of the Constitution Act, 1867. Rather, the <b>Act</b> <b>concerned</b> the [...] "flow of goods" [...] which was part of the Trade power. Rand J., in a concurring opinion, added that the {{demarcation}} between trade, production, and manufacturing must be considered. “That demarcation must observe this rule, that if in a trade activity, including manufacture or production, there is involved a matter of extraprovincial interest or concern its regulation thereafter in the aspect of trade is by that fact put beyond Provincial power.” Consequently, some intra-provincial trade can be regulated federally as well as inter-provincial trade.|$|E
50|$|In 1882 Sir John Lubbock {{pioneered the}} First British Ancient Monuments Act. This <b>Act,</b> <b>concerned</b> principally with prehistoric monuments {{rather than with}} later, medieval structures, {{encouraged}} owners to voluntarily transfer important sites into the safekeeping of Her Majesty's Commissioners of Works. It also discouraged the public from damaging monuments by threatening to impose stiff penalties. The first Schedule of monuments resulted from a nationwide inquiry among interested local antiquarian societies. In order to add monuments to this Schedule, the First Inspector of Ancient Monuments, General Pitt-Rivers, travelled the British Isles examining the known sites, and searching for new ones. Unfortunately, only limited information was available {{to him and his}} helpers about the nature, location and condition of many monuments, and there was no easy way to assess the potential national significance or value of any given site.|$|E

5000|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War I the Defence of the Realm Act was passed by Parliament in 1914. One section of the <b>Act</b> <b>concerned</b> the hours pubs could sell alcohol, as {{it was believed that}} alcohol consumption would interfere with the war effort. It restricted opening hours for licensed premises to luncheon (12:00 to 14:40) and supper (18:30 to 21:30). In the late 1980s the licensing laws in England and Wales became less restricted and allowed pubs to allow the consumption of alcohol on the premises from 11:00 until 23:00, although nightclubs were allowed to stay open much later. Significantly revised rules were introduced in November 2005, when hour limits were scrapped, and pubs were allowed to apply for licences as permissive as [...] "24 hours a day". In practice, most pubs chose to apply for more restrictive licences.|$|E

On {{the day of the}} introduction of H.R. 3195, the bill had 143 co-sponsors in the House. Despite the number of House co-sponsors of the legislation, the business community and the Justice Department urged Members of Congress to oppose the ADA Restoration <b>Act.</b> <b>Concerned</b> that a partisan battle would damage the traditionally bi-partisan base of support for disability rights legislation, Congressional champions of the bill, including Majority Leader Hoyer, encouraged the disability community to meet with the business community and negotiate bill language that both communities would agree to defend through the entire legislative process.|$|E

Among the many landmark cases Sive argued were Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference v. Federal Power Commission (1971). The Storm King case accorded standing to a citizens group without financial interest in the proposed power project and ordered the defendant to explore alternatives. Con Ed eventually abandoned the project. Other notable cases included Committee for Nuclear Responsibility, Inc. v. Schlesinger (1971), argued before the U.S. Supreme Court, which attracted wide media attention to the issue of governmental underground nuclear bomb testing and its potential environmental effects at Amchitka Island, Alaska; Concerned About Trident, Inc. v. Rumsfeld (1976), which established that strategic military decisions are not exempt from compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act; Mohonk Trust v. Board of Assessors of Town of Gardiner (1979), a real property case that on appeal established that land owned by a trust for environmental preservation and use could be exempt from real property taxes; Citizens Committee for the Hudson River v.

5000|$|Parties to a {{contract}} cannot exclude liability for misleading or deceptive conduct under section 18 of the Australian Consumer Law. Terms that purport to do so will be unenforceable {{to protect the public}} interest in ensuring that statutory remedies are available to persons who are misled or deceived into entering an agreement. As was stated in reference to section 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), the modern equivalent of which is section 18 of the Australian Consumer Law: 49. Irrespective of the construction of these two special conditions it does not matter ultimately whether the impugned conduct with which this case is concerned falls literally within them or not. Section 52 is a section in the consumer protection provisions of an <b>Act</b> <b>concerned</b> to protect the public from misleading or deceptive conduct and unfair trade practices which may result in contravention of the Act. It has been held that exclusion clauses, of which special conditions 6 and 7 are examples, cannot operate to defeat claims under s. 52. It may be ... that such exclusion clauses will generally be ineffective because they cannot break the nexus between the conduct in contravention of s. 52 and the making of the agreement in issue. ...50. There are wider objections to allowing effect to such clauses. Otherwise the operation of the Act, a public policy statute, could be ousted by private agreement. Parliament passed the Act to stamp out unfair or improper conduct in trade or in commerce; it would be contrary to public policy for special conditions such as those with which this contract was concerned to deny or prohibit a statutory remedy for offending conduct under the Act.|$|E
5000|$|The {{succession}} to the Grand Mastership [...] of the Sacred Military Constantinian Order of Saint George is {{a separate}} dignity that descends to the heirs of the Farnese family and is not tied to any sovereignty; it was only held by the reigning dukes of Parma from 1698 to 1734 and the kings of Naples and Sicily from 1734-1860. The Apostolic Brief Sincerae Fidei and Imperial diploma of 1699 invested the grand mastership in Francesco Farnese and his family and this was confirmed in the Papal bull Militantis Ecclesiae of 1718, so when Francesco's brother Antonio died childless in 1731 it was inherited along with Parma by Infante Don Charles of Bourbon and Farnese. When, however, he surrendered Parma to the Emperor in 1736 he retained the grand mastership {{and control of the}} Order, and his rights as Grand Master were recognised by his brother Philip who became Duke of Parma in 1748, in several decrees, as did the latter's son, Ferdinand, Duke of Parma. On 8 March 1796 King Ferdinand IV and III of Naples and Sicily issued a decree which stated that “In his (the king's) royal person there exists together two very distinct qualities, the one of Monarch of the Two Sicilies, and the other of Grand Master of the illustrious, royal and military Constantinian order, which though united gloriously in the same person form nonetheless at the same time two separate independent Lordships." [...] Numerous royal and papal acts, declarations by the government of the Order, the statutes of the Order including those of 1934 which governed the succession in 1960, and expert texts written before 1960, were unanimous in confirming that the grand mastership was not united with the crown but a separate dignity, with a different system of succession (absolute Salic law, whereas the Two Sicilies was governed by semi-Salic law). Hence no <b>act</b> <b>concerned</b> only with the succession to the Two Sicilies could have any bearing on the succession to the Constantinian grand mastership, an ecclesiastical office governed by canon law.|$|E
