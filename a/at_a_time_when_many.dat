5|$|By then, Brown had put {{his system}} into place: a strict, {{systematic}} approach to coaching combined with a well-organized recruitment network that drew promising young players from Massillon's junior high school football program. He {{paid no attention to}} race, and brought several African-American players onto the team <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>many</b> northern schools excluded them.|$|E
5|$|The {{house was}} never to be a private {{residence}} again. It was offered for sale in 1929, and <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>many</b> country houses were being demolished was given a scrap value of £5,882. With {{the exception of the}} Phelips family portraits, the historic contents and furnishing were disposed of, and the house, an empty shell, remained on the market for two years.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} several fanzines {{published}} by supporters. Made in Brum, first issued in 2000, {{was the only one}} regularly on sale in 2013. The Zulu began some years earlier and ran for at least 16 seasons. The hooligan firm associated with the club, the Zulus, were unusual in that they had multi-racial membership <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>many</b> such firms had associations with racist or right-wing groups.|$|E

5|$|As a critic, Willis did {{not believe}} in {{including}} discussions of personalities of writers when reviewing their works. He also believed that, though publications should discuss political topics, they should not express party opinions or choose sides. The Mirror flourished <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>many</b> publications were discontinuing. Its success was due to the shrewd management of Willis and Morris and the two demonstrated that the American public could support literary endeavors. Willis was becoming an expert in American literature and so, in 1845, Willis and Morris issued an anthology, The Prose and Poetry of America.|$|E
5|$|Gillom {{played for}} the Massillon Tigers between 1938 and 1940, a period during which the team won all of its games and two High School Football National Championships. Gillom, who also played {{basketball}} and other sports, earned All-Ohio honors at Massillon {{and was one of}} several black players on the team <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>many</b> northern high schools excluded them. Brown's policy was to use his best players, regardless of race. Gillom set school records for points scored in a season and touchdown passes caught in a season. His record of 108 points in a season still stands.|$|E
5|$|This was <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>many</b> {{television}} shows created websites to promote episodes; earlier that year, Fox created a website called whatbadgerseat.com {{in conjunction with}} the season premiere, in which badgers played an important role. On August18,2009, the episode was released as part of a DVD set called The Simpsons: The Complete Twelfth Season. Mike Scully, Ian Maxtone-Graham, Don Payne, John Frink, Matt Selman, Tom Gammill, Max Pross, Mark Kirkland and Joel H. Cohen participated in the audio commentary for the episode.|$|E

It was established <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> tensions between the Football League and the Football Association were high. The biggest disagreement was how revenue was shared between the clubs.|$|R

5|$|In the Browns' biggest {{trade of}} the offseason, Brown sent end John Harrington to the Chicago Rockets for Bill Boedeker, a halfback. Perhaps the most {{significant}} signing, however, was punter Horace Gillom, who had played for Brown at Massillon Washington High School and who Brown had recruited to Ohio State before World War II. Gillom could kick the ball further than most punters of his era. He changed the way teams approached punting by lining up 15 yards behind the center instead of the customary 10 yards to give himself more space and time to make his kicks. Gillom was also the third black player to sign with the Browns <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>many</b> teams did not employ African-Americans. Cleveland chose fullback Dick Hoerner in the AAFC draft, but he signed instead with the Los Angeles Rams of the National Football League.|$|E
5|$|Within the {{recording}} industry, Martin {{was known for}} having become independent <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>many</b> producers were still salaried. However, EMI refused his pleas for royalties on his own work. By 1965, the Beatles' success had given Martin the leverage to start Associated Independent Recording (AIR), which enabled him to hire out his services to other artists. Martin also took EMI’s best producers and staff along with him to AIR. AIR demonstrated how important Martin's talents were to his artists, and it allowed him a share in record royalties on his hits. To this day, AIR {{remains one of the}} world's pre-eminent recording studios. In 1979, Martin opened a studio on the Caribbean island of Montserrat. This studio was destroyed by Hurricane Hugo ten years later.|$|E
5|$|The {{conductor}} of the combined choir was John Larkin Hopkins, who was also organist of Trinity College. He became ill, and handed over the conductorship to Stanford in 1873. Stanford was also appointed Hopkins's deputy organist at Trinity, and moved from Queens' to Trinity in April 1873. In the summer of that year Stanford made {{his first trip to}} continental Europe. He went to Bonn for the Schumann Festival held there, where he met Joachim and Brahms. His growing love of the music of Schumann and Brahms marked him as a classicist <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>many</b> music-lovers were divided into the classical or the modernist camps, the latter represented by the music of Liszt and Wagner. Stanford was not constrained by the fashion for belonging to one camp or the other; he immensely admired Die Meistersinger though he was unenthusiastic about some of Wagner's other works. After leaving Bonn he returned home by way of Switzerland and then Paris, where he saw Meyerbeer's Le prophète.|$|E

The company directors at this time were E.S. Babcock, John Diedrich Spreckels, Captain Charles T. Hinde, H.W. Mallett, and Giles Kellogg. By 1890 Spreckels bought out both Babcock and Story.

He was often called upon to give judgments and opinions on matters often unrelated to theoretical physics or mathematics.
