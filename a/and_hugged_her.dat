500|$|Attorneys {{with the}} office of the Texas Attorney General took on Mitchell's case after being {{contacted}} by the TMB. Assistant Attorney General David Glickler later said that the case was the most bizarre he had seen in an 11-year stint {{with the office}}. [...] "We're used to dealing with cases where public officials have enriched themselves {{at the expense of the}} office and the public trust, like bribery and theft.

500|$|On Good Friday in March 2005, Veitch, Albee and {{six other}} women went to a strip club in Riverside and paid for lap dances. Instead of {{accepting}} the dances, they talked with the strippers, telling {{them that they were}} loved and accepted by God, that churches were composed entirely of sinners, and that they would be welcome there. One of the lap dancers cried and told Albee she had often wanted to go to a church but had never done so because she had thought that she would be rejected. The woman accepted a prayer from Albee <b>and</b> <b>hugged</b> <b>her.</b> Albee would later say that talking with women at the strip club that first day changed her life. Because the volunteers received more positive responses than they had expected, they decided to continue to evangelize at strip clubs. To organize these activities, Veitch and Albee founded JC's Girls, with [...] "JC" [...] standing for Jesus Christ. They made Matthew's House the parent organization, but decided to operate primarily under the name [...] "JC's Girls" [...] because Veitch believed that strippers would not understand the meaning of the name [...] "Matthew's House".|$|E
