40|$|In this thesis, the {{problems}} of pricing are investigated on networks with heterogeneous users. I seek the possibility and conditions through an anonymous toll scheme to achieve a simultaneously improvement of multi-criteria system performance. First, I look into the possibility and conditions of a Pareto-improving and Revenue-neutral congestion pricing scheme on a simple bi-mode network: this scheme aims at improving system performance, making every individual user better off (includes increasing social welfare) and having zero total revenue simultaneously. Second, comparing with the “do-nothing” case, I look into the possibility of Pareto-improving of system performances measured in both time and monetary units (the system time and the system cost) through a congestion pricing scheme in general networks. In the first part, since Pareto-improving and Revenue-neutral scheme suggested here charges transit users negative tolls and automobile users positive tolls, {{it can be a}} proper way to implement congestion pricing and transit subsidy in one step; also it will possibly improve system performance, increase social welfare and offset the inequity for the poor. I concern with two problems. First, whether or not Pareto-improving and Revenue-neutral pricing scheme exists for certain targeted modal split flow pattern? Second, what are the different Pareto-improving situations when a bi-mode transportation system serves for travel groups with different VOT distributions respectively? For a general VOT distribution, the condition that everyone will be better off is found. Furthermore, the impacts of details of different travel communities’ VOT distributions on the better off situations after Revenue-neutral toll are studied and the better off situations can be classified into three cases. Then I focused on travel groups with uniform VOT distributions. A continuous range in terms of the targeted highway flow always exists to realize everyone better off through Revenue-neutral pricing. The larger the VOT range is, the smaller the range is. A common range that the system time is decreased is exactly the range that Pareto-improving and Revenue-neutral pricing scheme exists, independent of VOT distribution. However, considering the increasing and decreasing property of the loss of the most <b>adverse</b> <b>user</b> among the community, a large VOT range does not always mean the adverse inequitable situation after Revenue-neutral pricing. When the reduction of travel time on highway through pricing is large enough, the large widening rich-poor gap will give more benefit to the most <b>adverse</b> <b>user.</b> In the second part, comparing with the untolled user equilibrium situation, the necessary condition of Pareto-improving of the total system travel cost and the total system travel time through a road pricing scheme in general networks is found. I give a classification of the untolled user equilibrium situations which are collectively exhaustive and mutually exclusive. Two among the classification are identified as extreme situations where the two objectives might completely conflict with each other and show that, for general cases except the two extreme situations, the system time and cost can be reduced simultaneously as long as the system time can be reduced separately...|$|E
40|$|Visual {{performance}} and comfort of computer user {{depends on the}} quality of computer display. A host of visual symptoms has been associated with poorer display quality, such as eyestrain, eyesore and dry eyes. The lower pixel density of earlier displays is the likely source of <b>adverse</b> <b>user</b> experiences, as it forces users to adopt a close viewing distance and results in heightened accommodative and convergence stress. The critical criterion in evaluating the pixel density is number of pixel per degree, or PPD. It is defined as the number of pixels occupying a certain extent of visual angle in relation to the user’s vision. When the PPD surpasses the psychophysical resolution of human vision, optimal visual functions for screen viewing is expected. Higher PPD also provides additional benefits to viewers, such as permitting smaller screens and richer display content. However, since displays with high pixel density are very expensive, {{there needs to be a}} compromise between increasing pixel density and holding down the cost of computer display. PPD is directly affected by two factors: pixel density and viewing distance. Indirectly, several factors determine PPD by altering viewing distance. These include screen size, display form factor (phone, tablet, laptop, or desktop screen), viewing angle, and luminance/illumination conditions. The present analysis defines the meaning of the threshold PPD, and explains how it can be quantified. Its relationships to screen size, pixel density, and display form factor are also illustrated. Calculation of PPD for presently available/popular displays with various form factors is conducted to evaluate their PPD relative to a theoretical threshold, 1 pixel/arcmin. A series of experiments are proposed to investigate the threshold PPD, the relationship among the factors affecting threshold PPD. Their ultimate goal is to provide specifications for the screen size and PPD for different display platforms...|$|E
40|$|With {{ever-increasing}} {{demands on}} scarce natural resources, understanding public attitudes toward natural resources {{is crucial to}} accomplishing various management goals for resource conservation {{and the provision of}} resource services. Despite numerous studies of public attitudes toward resource conservation since Dunlap and Heffernan 1975), there is a limited understanding of the driving forces underlying recreationists?? activities that contribute to their conservation attitudes and behaviors. Thus, this dissertation investigated the connected causal effects of how recreational anglers develop their conservation attitudes and preferences toward natural resources in light of within- and between-group diversity. Three independent studies, focusing on both recreation specialization and recreationists?? conservation attitudes, were conducted with different research themes. Two different methods, namely, a stated preference discrete choice method and structural equation modeling, were used. The first study examined anglers?? holistic preferences for trade-offs of various management rules and regulations using specialization segmentation. Study results supported that high specialization anglers reported a greater appreciation of and support for resource management practices such as harvest regulations that seek to reduce <b>adverse</b> <b>user</b> impacts than their less specialized counterparts. The second study explored the fostering process of conservation attitudes and behaviors with recreation specialization and other motivational and attitudinal variables. Given that empirical analyses supported the theoretical propositions in the constructed model, recreation specialization and other accrued motivational and attitudinal concepts provided insight to understanding the formation pattern of conservation attitudes and behaviors. The third study examined how the fostering process of attitudes toward resource conservation differed by race and ethnicity. Results indicated that anglers, regardless of their racial and ethnic origins, showed similar patterns of fostering attitudes toward and preferences for resource conservation. As they participated in fishing activity on a regular basis, heterogeneous development in conservation attitudes and preferences were likely to be minimal and be better explained by the framework of recreation specialization. Finally, a summary and synthesis of the findings, agenda for future research, and the management implications were discussed...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAccurately {{predicting}} the formation, development and dissipation of fog and low stratus (LS) still poses {{a challenge for}} numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. Errors in the low cloud cover NWP forecasts directly impact the quality of photovoltaic (PV) power prediction. On days with LS, day-ahead forecast errors of Germany-wide PV power frequently lie within {{the magnitude of the}} balance energy and thus pose a challenge for maintaining grid stability. An indication in advance about the possible occurrence of a critical weather situation such as LS would represent a helpful tool for transmission system operators (TSOs) in their day-to-day business. In the following, a detection algorithm for low stratus risk (LSR) is developed and applied as post-processing to the NWP model forecasts of the regional non-hydrostatic model COSMO-DE, operational at the German Weather Service. The aim of the LSR product is to supply day-ahead warnings and to support the decision making process of the TSOs. The quality of the LSR is assessed by comparing the computed regions of LSR occurrence with a satellite based cloud classification product from the Nowcasting Satellite Facility (NWCSAF). The results show that the LSR provides additional information that should in particular be useful for risk <b>adverse</b> <b>users...</b>|$|R

European citizens are classified according to their Internet usage patterns. Next, the demographic and behavioural profiles of the identified groups are thoroughly examined, which clarifies citizens' Internet-related behaviour and how external variables are related to Internet uses. Method. Telephone survey, using a random method, in order to guarantee the representativity of each national sample for its universe. Citizens from all European countries (EU- 15) were surveyed about their Internet usage patterns. Analysis. Two-Step Cluster Analysis has been applied, to identify the different groups of European Internet users. Discriminant and Correspondence Analysis have been respectively applied to assess {{the internal and external}} validity of the identified segments. The statistical package SPSS v 11. 5 was employed for the empirical analyses. Results. Four segments of European Internet users have been identified: Laggards, Confused and <b>Adverse,</b> Advanced <b>Users,</b> Followers and Non-Internet Users. The behavioural and demographic profiles of the previously identified segments are examined. Next, the internal and external validity of the clusters is assessed. Conclusion. The identified Internet user segments show clear differences with regard to country, sex, occupation, education and location. These results confirm the existence of sociodemographic entry barriers to the use of digital services. Such barriers may to the development and widening of a digital divide among European citizens...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – Multimedia {{content that}} is {{accessible}} through mobile devices has a larger size than {{other types of}} content (e. g. text, images). This may lead to higher prices for accessing the content via mobile devices, as mobile operators are capping mobile data billing plans {{in an effort to}} increase their revenues and prevent congestion. This poses problems for the users that are not willing/do not afford to pay the required price but still want to use multimedia content through the mobile networks. A price reduction for the user, as well as minimising bandwidth consumption can be obtained as a trade-off in multimedia quality. However, as previous research shows, not all people are willing to trade-off quality for a lower price; therefore, there is no straightforward approach to this problem. In this context, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to present a model of user willingness to pay for multimedia content quality as a function of the user risk attitude with the aim to provide personalised content depending on the user willingness to trade-off price for multimedia content quality. Design/methodology/approach – A user model was proposed based on a literature review and an existing data set. A stereotypical approach was used where users are divided in two groups: risk averse and risk seekers. An experimental study involving six scenarios was used to validate the findings. Findings – The results of the evaluation show that for the proposed user risk model, risk seekers preferred to pay for multimedia quality, whereas risk <b>adverse</b> <b>users</b> preferred to switch to a lower multimedia quality when monetary cost is involved. However, when the mobile data billing plan had the bandwidth limited, rather than a higher price to be paid when the bundle quantity was exceeded, the risk averse people’s preference for a lower quality still holds, but it does not show that most of the risk seekers prefer to pay for the multimedia quality. Research limitations/implications – This paper adds to the state of the art by providing a novel way to model the user preferences for multimedia quality based on their attitude towards risk, age, and gender. Practical implications – Mobile data users, content providers (application service providers, over-the-top providers), mobile network operators (MNOs) and internet service providers (ISPs) could benefit from the results of this research. For mobile data users, the outcome of this research could be beneficial, as they can obtain personalised content based on their needs. From the content providers’ point of view, providing personalised content can lead to more satisfied users. It could also reduce the bandwidth consumption and the traffic to the server and/or proxy. Reducing the bandwidth consumption could lead to the possibility to acquire more customers and hence increase the revenues. Originality/value – This is among the first studies to assess how the user preference towards multimedia quality if affected by the user attitude towards risk...|$|R

40|$|Study Setting: Two rural Indonesian districts {{served by}} the {{national}} midwife-in-the-village programme. Methods: Three critical incident audits of maternal mortality and severe morbidity: confidential enquiry, a verbal autopsy survey, and a participatory community-based review. Results: A range of inter-related factors contributed to poor quality and access. When delivery complications occurred, many women and families were un-informed, un-prepared, found care unavailable, unaffordable, and relied on traditional providers. Social health insurance was poorly promoted, inequitably distributed, complex, bureaucratic, and often led to lower quality care. Public midwives were scarce in remote areas and lacked incentives to provide care to the poor. Emergency transport was often unavailable and private transport incurred further expense. In facilities, there was reluctance to admit poor women, and ill-equipped, under-staffed wards for those accepted. Referrals between hospitals were also common. Examining <b>adverse</b> events from <b>user</b> and provider perspectives yielded multi-level causal explanations. These were used to develop a conceptual model relating structural arrangements (such as decentralisation, commodified care and reductions in public funding) to constrained service provision and adverse health consequences. Conclusions and recommendations: A policy shift towards healthcare as a public good may provide a route to reduce available maternal ill-health. Engaging with those who require and provide critical care in routine assessments can inform more robust health planning, and promote inclusion and participation in health.

Materials and Methods Electric and magnetic field intensities were measured at 30, 50, and 60 cm around the screens using anHI- 3603 device. Also, to investigate the probable relationship between exposure to electromagnetic fields and the users’ general health, the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) was used. The questionnaires were completed by 69 employees, both {{in the study and}} control groups. Data from the questionnaires were analyzed using SPSS software. Results The magnetic field intensities were less than commonly accepted standards such as The Swedish confederation of professional employers (TCO) for both laptop and desktop displays. Also, {{the electric}} field intensities in laptop displays were all within the allowable range in this study. However, values in the desktop displays were higher than 1 v/m (based on TCO standard) in 15 %, 4 % and 2 % of the cases involving the distances of 30, 50, and 60 cm in one or more directions, respectively.

40|$|Abstract—In {{cellular}} networks, it {{is important}} to conserve ener-gy {{while at the same time}} ensuring users to have good transmission experiences. The energy cost can result from tail energy due to the radio resource control strategies designed in cellular networks and data transmission. Existing efforts generally consider one of the energy issues, and also ignore the <b>adverse</b> impact on <b>user</b> transmission performance due to energy conservation. In addition, many existing algorithms are based on prediction and knowledge on future traffic, which are hard to apply in a practical wireless system with dynamic user traffic and channel condition. The goal of this work is to design an efficient online scheduling algorithm to minimize energy consumption both due to tail energy and transmissions while meeting user performance expectation. We prove the problem to be NP-hard, and design a practical online scheduling algorithm PerES to minimize the total energy cost of multiple mobile applications subject to user performance constraints. We propose a comprehensive performance cost metric to capture the impacts due to task delay, deadline violation, different application profiles and user preferences. We prove that our proposed scheduling algorithm can make the energy consumption arbitrarily close to that of the optimal scheduling solution. The evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme and its higher performance than peers. Moreover, by supporting dynamic performance requirement by mobile users, PerES can achieve 2 times faster convergence to both the performance degradation bound and optimal energy conversation bound than those of traditional static methods. Using 821 million traffic flows collected from a commercial cellular carrier, we verify our scheme could achieve on average 32 %- 56 % energy savings with different levels of user experience...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. To {{systematically}} {{develop and}} field test an intervention to engage families and healthcare {{teams in the}} decision-making process about life support for critically ill patients in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Setting. Adult medical-surgical ICU at a Canadian academic teaching hospital. Methods. The International Patient Decision Aid Standards (IPDAS) criteria and the Interprofessional Shared Decision Making (SDM) model guided the study of families facing decisions about life support for their relative in ICU that involved: 1) systematic review; 2) qualitative descriptive study; 3) mixed methods field test of a novel patient decision aid (DA). Systematic review findings. Of 3162 citations, four trials evaluated interventions to improve communication between health professionals and patients/families. One intervention met eight of nine criteria for SDM but did not evaluate its effect on the benefit to communication. Qualitative study findings. Six family members and nine health professionals identified two options (life support or comfort care) and values associated with these options. Values included maintaining quality of life, surviving critical illness, minimizing pain and suffering, not being attached to machines, giving the family enough time to adapt emotionally to the patient’s health situation, and the judicious use of healthcare resources. Families were unlikely to become engaged without healthcare professionals making the decision explicit and minimizing other barriers across the decision-making process. Field test findings. Family members and health professionals for eight patients indicated that the DA was feasible to use, acceptable to users, had the potential to do what was intended, and did not seem to present <b>adverse</b> consequences to <b>users.</b> An enhanced delivery strategy is needed for future evaluation of its effect on facilitating patient/family involvement in decisions. Conclusions. Limited involvement of families in the process of decision-making about life support in the ICU reinforced the need for effective interventions to facilitate SDM. These studies validated the operationalization of the IPDAS criteria, as part of a systematic process for developing and field testing DAs. However, IPDAS criteria stop short of elements necessary to consider when implementing the DA in the processes of care...|$|R
40|$|Background: Online {{peer support}} {{networks}} are a growing area {{of mental health}} support for offering social connection, identity, and support. However, {{it has been reported}} that not all individuals have a positive experience on such networks. The potential for adverse events within a moderated online peer support network is a new area of research exploration. Objective: The objective of the study was to determine if use of an online moderated peer networks leads to <b>adverse</b> events for <b>users.</b> Methods: Four biannual online surveys (October 2014 to March 2016) were conducted by a large national UK mental health charity, with users of their online peer support network exploring personal safety, moderation, experiences on the site, and how the site could be improved. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis by 2 independent researchers using a priori themes: negative experiences of moderation, social exclusion, contagion, negative interactions with other users, online relationships, co-rumination and collusion, and other. Results: In total, 2353 survey responses were logged with 197 (8. 37 %) documenting an adverse event of negative experience. A dominant theme of negative experiences of moderation emerged (73 / 197, 37. 1 %) with evidence of social exclusion (50 / 197, 25. 4 %). Reading user posts was shown to be a cause of worry and distress for a few users, and analysis highlighted several instances of depressogenic and emotional contagion as well as some limited evidence of behavioral contagion (46 / 197, 23. 4 %). Very limited evidence of co-rumination (1 / 197, 0. 5 %) and no evidence of collusion were identified. Conclusions: Evidence of adverse events was identified at low levels in the sample of respondents, although we have no comparison data to indicate if levels are low compared with comparable platforms. Not all users of online peer support networks find them wholly beneficial. Research must explore what works for whom. The next stage of service development should consider which users may be likely to receive no benefit, or even deteriorate, as a result of using the service...|$|R

40|$|Cowpea is an {{important}} component in several cropping systems prevalent in Africa. It is attacked by numerous insect pests, some of which have proved intractable in research so far. Efforts to control them have included host plant resistance and cultural practices, as well as agrochemicals. Biological control offers another possibility and neem, a plant that is often grown in backyards and along borders of crop fields offers considerable promise as an easily available source of natural chemical compounds to be harnessed for pest control. In Nigeria, where much of the world's cowpea is grown, aqueous extracts of neem are used to keep grasshoppers off the crop in the dry season. Neem leaves are soaked overnight and the solution sprinkled on cowpea plants using a shaped tree branch or broom. Despite this use, {{and the fact that it}} is known for its efficacy in controlling pests of stored products, neem has been little used as a control measure for other pests of cowpea. The International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) has conducted field trials on two major pests of cowpea, the pod borer Maruca testulalis and the pod sucking bug Clavigralla tomentosicollis. Solutions made from ground neem seed or kernel were sprayed onto cowpea flowers and pods. The resulting low survival rates of both nymphal and adult pests were encouraging. Trials using neem oil derived formulations were also evaluated. Fears are sometimes expressed that neem could adversely affect pest predators, but evidence so far suggests that these fears are unjustified. Workers with long experience of neem have not found any serious impact on the beneficial fauna associated with most crops, nor should there be any <b>adverse</b> effects on <b>users</b> of neem as it is already used medicinally in some countries to combat various ailments. L E N Jackai, IITA PMB 5320 Ibadan, NIGERIACowpea is {{an important}} component in several cropping systems prevalent in Africa.

40|$|Abstract Background The post {{marketing}} safety surveillance {{program for}} a drug containing a new chemical entity should assess both, the safety outcomes that relate specifically to the targeted population, {{as well as those}} that could potentially be related to special pharmacological characteristics of the drug. Active safety surveillance using valid epidemiological study designs has been proven to be a pertinent and reliable method to approach this endeavor. Methods/design The primary objective of the study is to compare incidence rates of serious <b>adverse</b> events in <b>users</b> of all types of newly prescribed oral HRT products. This active surveillance study will assess pertinent cardiovascular outcomes - in particular venous and arterial thromboembolism - and other serious adverse events (SAEs) in new HRT users {{over a period of several}} years. One product under surveillance is Angeliq ®, which contains the novel progestagen drospirenone (DRSP) combined with estradiol. In addition, all other oral combined HRT products with a novel progestagen or estrogen that will be newly marketed during the study period will be studied. These new HRT products will be compared with established HRT products. The combined cohort will include at least 30, 000 women recruited in several European countries. At least 90, 000 years of observation are expected from the field work which started in early 2002 and will end around 2008. The participating women will complete a baseline survey using a self-administered questionnaire to describe the baseline risk. After 6 months, 12 months, and then on an annual basis, they will fill out a questionnaire in which they record complaints and events during the use of the prescribed HRTs. All adverse outcomes occurring during the observational period will be evaluated. Discussion A complete lifetime medical history, individually validated SAEs over time, and a low loss to follow-up rate are essential for a robust safety assessment. Therefore, the lifetime history of diseases and relevant medications will be documented. Reported SAEs will be validated and analyzed. A four level, multi-faceted follow-up process was established to ensure low loss to follow-up rates (e. g., 3 – 5 % after three years of follow up). Multivariate methods will be used to adjust for confounding. </p...|$|R
40|$|Effects of {{exercise}} on serum lipids and lipoproteins, and {{other risk factors}} for coronary heart disease (CHD) were assessed in minimally active young women. Apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I) and lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) activity were evaluated for their potential mechanistic roles. Subjects 18 - 30 years of age (n = 244) were analyzed cross-sectionally for correlations between risk factors for CHD including anthropometrics, fitness, previous physical activity, blood pressure, blood lipids, linearities cholesterol, apo A-I, and LCAT activity. A longitudinal analysis {{of the effects of}} one year of resistance exercise prescribed 3 times/wk with an aerospace component in a subset of 23 exercisers (EX) and 23 controls (CON) was performed. Parent groups were stratified for age and oral contraceptive (OC) use. All variables except LCAT activity were also assessed in a smaller subset (17 EX and 23 CON) who completed two years of the same study. ^ OC use was adversely associated with the blood lipid profile. However, apo A-I was elevated in OC <b>users.</b> <b>Adverse</b> relationships were observed between abnormal body composition and blood lipids, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and apo A-I dependent on OC status. Previous activity and potential mechanisms were not related to the blood lipid profile. Longitudinally, strength and lean body mass increased greatly in EX for both the one and two year analyses. After one year, a main effect of time was observed for increased HDL-C adjusted for albumin status. No other effects on lipid status were observed. Apo A-I was significantly greater in EX at 6, 12, and 24 months. LCAT activity decreased significantly in EX before adjusting for albumin but was not altered significantly compared to CON. Change in LCAT activity was positively correlated with change in strength after 1 year. Change in strength was negatively related to change in blood cholesterol. No associations between changes in LCAT activity and blood lipids were observed; however, an unexpected positive correlation between change in apo A-I and LDL-C and TC was detected. Overall, this study showed only modest benefits in the blood lipid profile which were not strongly associated with a response in LCAT or apo A-I. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Malaria {{is one of}} {{the leading}} causes of {{mortality}} and morbidity in Nigeria. It is not known how user fees introduced under the Bamako Initiative (BI) system affect healthcare seeking among different socio-economic groups in Nigeria for diagnosis and treatment of malaria. Reliable information is needed to initiate new policy thrusts to protect the poor from the <b>adverse</b> effect of <b>user</b> fees. Methods Structured questionnaires were used to collect information from 1594 female household primary care givers or household head on their socio-economic and demographic status and use of malaria diagnosis and treatment services. Principal components analysis was used to create a socio-economic status index which was decomposed into quartiles and chi-square for trends was used to calculate for any statistical difference. Results The study showed that self diagnosis was the commonest form of diagnosis by the respondents. This was followed by diagnosis through laboratory tests, community health workers, family members and traditional healers. The initial choice of care for malaria was a visit to the patent medicine dealers for most respondents. This was followed by visit to the government hospitals, the BI health centres, traditional medicine healers, private clinics, community health workers and does nothing at home. Furthermore, the private health facilities were the initial choice of treatment for the majority with a decline among those choosing them as a second source of care and an increase in the utilization of public health facilities as a second choice of care. Self diagnosis was practiced more by the poorer households while the least poor used the patent medicine dealers and community health workers less often for diagnosis of malaria. The least poor groups had a higher probability of seeking treatment at the BI health centres (creating equity problem in BI), hospitals, and private clinics and in using laboratory procedures. The least poor also used the patent medicine dealers and community health workers less often for the treatment of malaria. The richer households complained more about poor staff attitude and lack of drugs as their reasons for not attending the BI health centres. The factors that encourage people to use services in BI health centres were availability of good services, proximity of the centres to the homes and polite health workers. Conclusions Factors deterring people from using BI centres should be eliminated. The use of laboratory services for the diagnosis of malaria by the poor should be encouraged through appropriate information, education and communication which at the long run will be more cost effective and cost saving for them while devising means of reducing the equity gap created. This could be done by granting a properly worked out and implemented fee exemptions to the poor or completely abolishing user fees for the diagnosis and treatment of malaria in BI health centres. </p...|$|R
40|$|The disease moolaroga {{is caused}} by eating Jams (Excluding KarunaiKizhangu) hot food items in excess, taking dull food, sitting in a {{position}} at long duration,riding at horse backs, practicing yoga excessively, suppressing breathing women at the period of expecting a child, hereditary (K. N.

Faeces come out in liquidized state with noise of pouring of water. There will be pain when the stools pass out, blood will bleed out, To study the efficacy of Karunaikizhanguthandu - choornam in clinical patients suffering from moolarogam. It is a Quasi experimental study conducted at Govt Siddha Ayurvedic clinics functioning under vadamarachy area. A population of 90 patients both males and females between the age of 30 - 60 yrs were selected. Patients reporting with irritation and itching at the anus, constipation, bleeding after daefacation, burning sensation at the anal canal, aching discomfort and exacerbated by daefacation were selected for observation. Patients with thrombosed or strangulated haemorrhoids with acute pain, third degree piles remain outside of the anal canal margin and severe anaemia were excluded in this study. This choornam consist of Typhoniumtrilobatum based on a recommendation of Murugesamuthaliyar, Gunapadam –part - 1 and K. N KupusamyMudaliyar- Siddha Maruthuvam. Among the selected 90 patients were treated with this choornam at the rate of 5 gram for a period of 48 - 49 days by oral administration twice a day with ghee Continuous observation of the patients was done at weekends. With this observation was continued for 49 days. Continuous observations on signs and symptoms such as irritation, constipation, and itching in anal region were gradually disappeared among 80 % of patients at the end of two weeks. Other signs such as bleeding after defecation, burning sensation around the anal canal, discomfort and pain exacerbated by defecation were recorded in 70 % of the above 80 % of patients until 5 th week and these were disappeared gradually during 6 - 7 th weeks. 10 % of the patients were not corporate with the treatment..

40|$|A widely accepted, and incorrect, {{assumption}} towards hearing accessibility {{in video}} games is that deaf and {{hard of hearing}} (DHH) users are those who encounter the least barriers and are generally well catered for. Rapid advancement in video game technology has seen video game sound evolve from simple blips generated by internal circuitry to fully realised digital audio used to convey critical information. To accommodate the DHH, this information needs to be conveyed in an alternative manner. However, evidence suggests existing accessible design solutions for the DHH lack specificity and are insufficient. Thus, the inability to hear, or hear well, has historically resulted in DHH users left with impeded experience and gameplay. This thesis describes an investigation to address the primary research question: How might accessible video game design practices be facilitated to better accommodate the deaf and hard of hearing? To examine this question, an action research method {{as part of a}} transformative mixed methods methodology was used. Data collection procedures included critical analysis of literature, observations, and a cross-sectional self-administered survey for triangulation. The critical analysis of literature exposed issues relating to accessible video game design, particularly in relation to the identification of solutions and technical implementation. Further, issues related to the classification of video game software were identified. This posed potential problems with identification of game design methods and {{led to the development of}} a new video game classification model. The new model informed an analysis on the methods used for the design of video games, and results were visually represented and mapped to the different approaches to accessible design. Subsequent analysis determined that a game assessment framework is a suitable approach to facilitating accessible design. Further investigation identified visual feedback as the most suitable form of complementary feedback to game audio. This led to the development of a new model to classify visual feedback elements used in video games, and identification of audio feedback categories based on diegetic film theory. Through triangulation of results, a new game feedback model (GFM) was developed. The GFM was used for observational experimentation to identify and classify individual visual feedback elements used in video games. Each element was analysed and mapped to categories of game sound. The resulting model, with populated data, was used to determine what visual feedback elements may be used to complement specific categories of critical game audio. A survey was subsequently used for triangulation, and resulted in amendments to the final model. Through iterative development, and interpretation of findings, the research culminated in the development of a game assessment framework. The three-step framework aids in the classification of game sounds; assesses the impact of those game sounds; and provides recommendations for complementary visual feedback elements for sounds identified as having an <b>adverse</b> impact on <b>user</b> experience and gameplay if they were to be removed. The framework is innovative and has the potential to provide practical guidance for developers of video games. In addition, this research provides the foundation for future research, with the potential to influence accessible game design for the DHH...|$|R
