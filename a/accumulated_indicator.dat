40|$|While {{evaluating}} the energy savings potential in buildings of different function {{we face the}} energy balance of current situation evaluation problem. Generally the data of energy flows quantities {{and the nature of}} their dynamics are agregated and do not reflect the indicators of the achieved microclimate. Therefore this article analyses the energy balance following the example of one-year data collection analysis in a company’s building complex. The investigated problem is evaluated by the system analysis approach, i. e. the analysed object system is divided into separate subsystems which have been simulated individually but considering the subsystems joint relations in the system. The methods applied in this work are heat and mass balance of separate subsystems and statistical analysis method. The statistical analysis was used for the evaluation of the statistical reliability of the <b>accumulated</b> <b>indicators</b> (temperature, relative humidity, etc.) ...|$|R
40|$|From 1991 through 1998, 1, 266 {{cases of}} shellfish-related {{illnesses}} {{were attributed to}} Norwalk-like viruses. Seventy-eight percent of these illnesses occurred following consumption of oysters harvested from the Gulf Coast during the months of November through January. This study investigated the ability of eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica) to <b>accumulate</b> <b>indicator</b> microorganisms (i. e., fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, and F+ coliphage) from estuarine water. One-week trials over a 1 -year period {{were used to determine}} if these indicator organisms could provide insight into the seasonal occurrence of these gastrointestinal illnesses. The results demonstrate that oysters preferentially accumulated F+ coliphage, an enteric viral surrogate, to their greatest levels from late November through January, with a concentration factor of up to 99 -fold. However, similar increases in accumulation of the other indicator microorganisms were not observed. These findings suggest that the seasonal occurrence of shellfish-related illnesses by enteric viruses is, in part, the result of seasonal physiological changes undergone by the oysters that affect their ability to accumulate viral particles from estuarine waters...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Transcribed pseudogenes are {{copies of}} protein-coding genes that have <b>accumulated</b> <b>indicators</b> of coding-sequence decay (such as frameshifts and {{premature}} stop codons), but nonetheless remain transcribed. Recent experimental {{evidence indicates that}} transcribed pseudogenes may regulate the expression of homologous genes, through antisense interference, or generation of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Here, we assessed the genomic evidence for such transcribed pseudogenes of potential functional importance, in the human genome. The most obvious indicators of such functional importance are significant evidence of conservation and selection pressure. Results A variety of pseudogene annotations from multiple sources were pooled and filtered to obtain a subset of sequences that have significant mid-sequence disablements (frameshifts and premature stop codons), and that have clear evidence of full-length mRNA transcription. We found 1750 such transcribed pseudogene annotations (TPAs) in the human genome (corresponding to ~ 11. 5 % of human pseudogene annotations). We checked for syntenic conservation of TPAs in other mammals (rhesus monkey, mouse, rat, dog and cow). About half of the human TPAs are conserved in rhesus monkey, but strikingly, very few in mouse (~ 3 %). The TPAs conserved in rhesus monkey show evidence of selection pressure (relative to surrounding intergenic DNA) on: (i) their GC content, and (ii) their rate of nucleotide substitution. This is in spite of distributions of Ka/Ks (ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates), congruent {{with a lack of}} protein-coding ability. Furthermore, we have identified 68 human TPAs that are syntenically conserved in at least two other mammals. Interestingly, we observe three TPA sequences conserved in dog that have intermediate character (i. e., evidence of both protein-coding ability and pseudogenicity), and discuss the implications of this. Conclusion Through evolutionary analysis, we have identified candidate sequences for functional human transcribed pseudogenes, and have pinpointed 68 strong candidates for further investigation as potentially functional transcribed pseudogenes across multiple mammal species. </p...|$|R
40|$|With the {{low-carbon}} economy advocated {{all over}} the world, how to use energy reasonably and efficiently in public projects {{has become a major}} issue. It has brought many open questions, including which method is more reasonable in evaluating the energy utilization of carbon performance in public projects when the evaluation information is fuzzy; whether an indicator system can be constructed; and which indicators have more impact on carbon performance. This article aims to solve these problems. We propose a new carbon performance evaluation system for energy utilization based on project processes (design, construction, and operation). Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) is used to <b>accumulate</b> the <b>indicator</b> weights and cloud model is incorporated when the indicator value is fuzzy. Finally, we apply our indicator system to a case study of the Xiangjiang River project in China, which demonstrates the applicability and efficiency of our method...|$|R
40|$|Radioactive wastes {{discharged}} from establishments {{involved in the}} use of radioisotopes such as nuclear powered industries, tracer research and nuclear medicine are a potential public health hazard. Such wastes contain radionuclides, particularly Iodine- 131 (131 I), produced in fission with a yield of about 3 %. It is a beta emitter (B max = 0. 61 MeV); it also emits gamma photons. It has a short half-life (8. 04 d) (Dutton 1975), hence it is difficult to detect unless <b>accumulated</b> by <b>indicator</b> organisms. Radionuclides in waste waters are known to be taken up by molluscs such as mussels (Van der Borght and Van Puymbroeck 1970; Fowler et al. 1975; Hetherington et al. 1976; Helt et al. 1980; and Sombrito et al. 1982), oyster (Romeril 1971; Cranmore and Harrison 1975) and clams (Cuvin and Umaly 1988). This study aims to determine the uptake of 131 I from algal phytoplankton (Choroococcus dispersus) fed to the freshwater clam Corbicula manillensis as well as the organ/tissue distribution. The results will be compared with our previous study on 131 I uptake from water by the same clams (Cuvin and Umaly 1988) ...|$|R

40|$|In arid and {{semi-arid}} regions irrigation {{is usually}} {{needed to provide}} enough water for crop growth in cultivated areas. As surface waters are scarce, especially in summertime when the water is needed, groundwater is heavily used to supply the water demand. Overexploitation of the aquifer in dry years causes depletion of the groundwater storage and systematical lowering of the piezometric levels. This is a particular problem in aquifers developed in closed basins where lateral inflow is nearly absent and replenishment is constrained by rainfall recharge. In this paper, simple indicators derived from meteorological data, abstraction rates and piezometric time series are compared with the groundwater storage depletion as obtained from a calibrated groundwater flow model. Application of the method to the overexploited Shahrekord basin in Iran shows that for the simulated period 1989 - 2003 an accumulative index of the difference of aquifer recharge, as calculated by a soil moisture balance method, and groundwater abstraction has a correlation coefficient of nearly one with model calculated storage. Indicators based on the filling index derived from piezometric time series or on the ratio of aquifer discharge to recharge have slightly lower correlations. The <b>accumulated</b> index <b>indicator</b> {{can be used to}} follow aquifer storage in the future without the need to run the full groundwater flow model. This simple approximation is restricted to aquifer systems with a limited lateral inflow and outflow. Overexploitation Indicator Modeling Irrigation...|$|R
40|$|Given the {{diversity}} of use and diversity of consumer time preferences, quality parameters of agricultural products, to assess the effectiveness of its production require additional criteria and indicators that reflect {{the specifics of the}} industry. In conducting the most objective assessment of economic efficiency of agricultural production it is necessary to define the set and the hierarchy of indicators in the Annex to the specific product that best characterizes the effectiveness of the subject area, which requires methodological approaches that reflect the peculiarities of the industry. For example, the potato is a versatile plant, characterized by {{the diversity}} of its use. Because of this, it must meet the specifications of those specific requirements and preferences (taste, color of the flesh of the tuber, the keeping quality). To select cost-effective varieties, you need to see them pre-assets other varieties before implementation into production. In sum-the total rating of the General and specific indicators and criteria revealed that the best zoned in on the territory of the Amur region the group of potato varieties early ripening variety is Alena, followed by Diamond and Udacha. In animal husbandry, has its own specifics. Currently, in livestock as feed rations are balanced according to the amount of metabolizable energy.

40|$|In als 3, an Al-sensitive Arabidopsis mutant, shoot {{development}} and root growth {{are sensitive to}} Al. Mutant als 3 seedlings grown in an Al-containing medium exhibit severely inhibited leaf expansion and root growth. In the presence of Al, unexpanded leaves <b>accumulate</b> callose, an <b>indicator</b> of Al damage in roots. The possibility that the inhibition of shoot development in als 3 {{is due to the}} hyperaccumulation of Al in this tissue was examined. However, {{it was found that the}} levels of Al that accumulated in shoots of als 3 are not different from the wild type. The inhibition of shoot development in als 3 is not a consequence of nonspecific damage to roots, because other metals (e. g. LaCl 3 or CuSO 4) that strongly inhibit root growth did not block shoot development in als 3 seedlings. Al did not block leaf development in excised als 3 shoots grown in an Al-containing medium, demonstrating that the Al-induced damage in als 3 shoots was dependent on the presence of roots. This suggests that Al inhibition of als 3 shoot development may be a delocalized response to Al-induced stresses in roots following Al exposure...|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{describing}} changes in stress and performance indicators throughout a competitive season {{in high level}} football. 15 players (19. 5 +/- 3. 0 years, 181 +/- 5 cm, 75. 7 +/- 9. 0 kg) competing under professional circumstances were tested at baseline and 3 times during the season 2008 / 09 (in-season 1, 2, 3). Testing consisted of the Recovery-Stress Questionnaire for Athletes (Total Stress and Recovery score), vertical jump tests (counter movement and drop jump (DJ)), and a maximal ramp-like running test. Average match exposure was higher during a 3 -weeks period prior to in-season 3 compared to in-season 1 and 2 (1. 5 vs. 1 h/week, p = 0. 05). Total Stress score was elevated at in-season 1 and 2 compared to baseline (p < 0. 01) with a further increase at in-season 3 (p < 0. 03; generalized eta squared (eta(2) (g)) = 0. 37). Total Recovery score was decreased at in-season 1 and 3 compared to baseline (p < 0. 05; eta(2) (g) = 0. 21). Maximal running velocity (V(max)) and jumping heights were not significantly affected (eta(2) (g) = 0. 04). Changes in DJ height and V(max) between baseline and in-season 3 were correlated with the corresponding changes in Total Stress score (r = - 0. 55 and r = - 0. 61, p < 0. 03).
