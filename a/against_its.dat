5|$|A {{study in}} 2014 shows that Dimetrodon {{was in an}} arms race <b>against</b> <b>its</b> prey. The smaller species, D.milleri had no {{serrations}} since it ate small prey. As the prey grew larger, Dimetrodon started developing serrations and increasing in size. D.limbatus had enamel serrations that help it cut through flesh, and the same serrations {{can be found on}} Secodontosaurus. The second largest dimetrodon species, D.grandis, has denticle serrations similar to sharks and theropod dinosaurs, making its teeth even more specialized to slice through flesh. This study not only shows the evolution of Dimetrodon over millions of years, but also shows that Dimetrodon was in an arms race <b>against</b> <b>its</b> prey. As prey grew larger, Dimetrodon countered it by growing larger and having sharper teeth.|$|E
