25|$|An {{advantage}} of index-based insurance {{is that it}} can potentially be delivered at lower cost. A significant barrier that hinders uptake of claim-based insurance is the high transaction cost for searching for prospective policyholders, negotiating and administering contracts, verifying losses and determining payouts. Index insurance eliminates the loss verification step, thereby mitigating a significant transaction cost. A second {{advantage of}} index-based insurance is that, because it pays an indemnity based on the reading of an index rather than individual losses, it eliminates much of the fraud, moral hazard and <b>adverse</b> <b>selection,</b> which are common in classical claim-based insurance. A further advantage of index insurance is that payments based on a standardized and indisputable index also allow for a fast indemnity payment. The indemnity payment could be automated, further reducing transaction costs.|$|E
25|$|Corporate {{governance}} {{mechanisms and}} controls {{are designed to}} reduce the inefficiencies that arise from moral hazard and <b>adverse</b> <b>selection.</b> There are both internal monitoring systems and external monitoring systems. Internal monitoring can be done, for example, by one (or a few) large shareholder(s) {{in the case of}} privately held companies or a firm belonging to a business group. Furthermore, the various board mechanisms provide for internal monitoring. External monitoring of managers' behavior, occurs when an independent third party (e.g. the external auditor) attests the accuracy of information provided by management to investors. Stock analysts and debt holders may also conduct such external monitoring. An ideal monitoring and control system should regulate both motivation and ability, while providing incentive alignment toward corporate goals and objectives. Care should be taken that incentives are not so strong that some individuals are tempted to cross lines of ethical behavior, for example by manipulating revenue and profit figures to drive the share price of the company up.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} role of the wealth {{distribution}} for the market selection of entrepreneurs when agents differ in talent. It argues that the redistribution of initial endowments can increase an economy's surplus because more talented individuals get credit for their risky investment projects. Moreover, the redistribution of initial endowments may lead to a Pareto-improvement although all agents are non-satiable. In my model an agent's entrepreneurial ability is his private information. Moral hazard in production creates rents for entrepreneurs if they are believed to be both talented and willing to provide entrepreneurial effort. I find conditions such that unproductive rich entrepreneurs crowd out productive poor ones on the capital market. Then redistribution of initial endowments leads to the selection of better entrepreneurs, increases the economy's surplus, and - in some cases - makes all agents better off.

2500|$|From the insurers' {{point of}} view, medical {{underwriting}} {{is necessary to}} prevent people from purchasing health insurance coverage only when they are sick, pregnant or need medical care. <b>Adverse</b> <b>selection</b> {{is a system that}} attracts high-users and discourages low-users from participating.

2500|$|The US {{economic}} history {{is rife with}} unwelcomed financial crises. Frederic S. Mishkin defines a financial crisis as [...] "a disruption to financial markets in which <b>adverse</b> <b>selection</b> and moral hazard problems become much worse, so that financial markets are unable to efficiently channel funds {{to those who have}} the most productive investment opportunities". Monetary policymakers have turned their attention to financial stability in order to mitigate the damage incurred during shocks. This is due to another outcome from failing to satisfy the principle is the existence of [...] "a multiplicity of bounded equilibria in which output and inflation respond to nonfundamental—sunspot—disturbances". Crises are typically unpredictable and uncontrollable due to the vast number of factors involved, which prompts the necessity for improved crisis stabilization policy. The Federal Reserve essay points out a couple cases, such as the Stock Market Crash of 1987 and the September 11 terrorist attack, in which the Federal Reserve had prevented even worse crises from arising by providing the liquidity essential to keeping the markets from crashing. The Federal Reserve’s quick response to stabilizing crises was made possible due to the improvement of monetary policy.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{collection}} of three independent essays that study the implication of learning on labor mobility, labor supply, wage distribution, wage dynamics, and allocations of workers under different assumptions about the nature of employer learning. The first essay develops a model of job mobility and wage dispersion under the assumption that the current employers have superior information about their workers over outside firms. The superior information of the workers does not lead to market collapse. Instead, there is a unique mixed strategy equilibrium which leads to a positive amount of turnover and a nondegenerate wage distribution. This model implies that a skill-biased technology change that also favors general skill can lead to increase both in job mobility and wage dispersion. This sheds light, on the joint evolution of job mobility and wage dispersion in the U. S. in the past 30 years. The second essay studies the wage distribution and wage dynamics under matching and symmetric Pareto learning. I develop a model that contains pure learning and pure matching as limiting cases. In addition, the model generates effects that arise from the interaction of learning and matching. In particular, the model generates an earning profile typically obtained in a Mincerian regression. (cont.) Moreover, the model predicts that the wage residuals {{are more likely to be}} serially correlated in younger workers in industries with increasingly convex wage schedules. This helps reconcile the conflicting findings that positive correlations are found in small, homogenous samples but not large, heterogeneous samples. The third essay, jointly with Peter Schnabl, develops a, model that examines the optimal solution to the problem of assigning workers into jobs under <b>adverse</b> <b>selections.</b> Workers differ by their disutility of effort. Jobs differ by their productivity and ease of effort-monitoring. Firms would like to assign hard workers to higher level jobs because efforts on these jobs are harder to monitor. To prevent the lazy workers from mimicking the hard workers, we study the use of two instruments firms may use: requiring long hours and distorting job assignments. The model has an essentially unique separating equilibrium. In equilibrium, workers are required to exert inefficiently high levels of effort and firms commit to promote only a fraction of qualified workers. by Jin Li. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|An {{increased}} awareness {{of the impact of}} group B streptococcus (GBS) infection on neonatal outcome has prompted several seemingly discordant committee recommendations. Intrapartum antibiotics are effective in reducing the risk of neonatal morbidity when administered to a colonized woman who has a clinical condition that places her neonate at high risk for early-onset sepsis. However, less is known about the efficacy of prophylactic antibiotics in the colonized woman who does not have obvious risk factors. Some authorities have suggested that providers refrain from administering intrapartum antibiotics to colonized women who do not have any of these risk factors, primarily due to concerns about potential <b>adverse</b> reactions, <b>selection</b> of resistant pathogens, and cost-effectiveness. These recommendations may conflict with the desires of an informed woman who weighs the real, albeit low, risk for serious neonatal disease against the lower perceived risk of adverse maternal sequelae from allergic reactions to the antimicrobial agents. Selective prophylaxis for GBS disease that is limited to the colonized parturient with risk factors has the potential for creating conflict because maternal beneficence-based obligations of the physician may be at odds with maternal autonomy-based obligations.
