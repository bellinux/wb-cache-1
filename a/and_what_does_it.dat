The author assumes an educated Greek-speaking audience, but directs his attention to specifically Christian concerns rather than to the Greco-Roman world at large. He begins his gospel with a preface addressed to Theophilus, informing him of his intention to provide an [...] "ordered account" [...] of events which will lead his reader to [...] "certainty". He did not write in order to provide Theophilus with historical justification—"did it happen?"—but to encourage faith—"what happened, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> all mean?" ...|$|E

The sooner the tough rhetoric of this can subside and the more this is viewed as a logical consequence of many years of failure to move the process forward, the better;" [...] while he also called for more U.S. involvement in the peace process. PLO Executive Committee member Saeb Erekat added: [...] "Life will not be the same [...] Palestine will become a country under occupation. The terms of reference for any negotiations become withdrawal." ...|$|E

40|$|An {{automatic}} object {{tracking and}} video summarization method for multi-camera systems {{with a large}} number of non-overlapping field-of-view cameras is explained. In this framework, video sequences are stored for each object as opposed to storing a sequence for each camera. Objectbased representation enables annotation of video segments, and extraction of content semantics for further analysis. We also present a novel solution to the inter-camera color calibration problem. The transitive model function enables effective compensation for lighting changes and radiometric distortions for large-scale systems. After initial calibration, objects are tracked at each camera by background subtraction and mean-shift analysis. The correspondence of objects between different cameras is established by using a Bayesian Belief Network. This framework empowers the user to get a concise response to queries such as "which locations did an object visit on Monday <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>do</b> there?"...|$|R

I couldn't hold up my head--I was so sleepy and stupid that Joseph had to take me upstairs to bed. I hate your wine! Your wine's a liar, who {{promises}} and doesn't perform!

40|$|Finance Institution (DFI), {{completed}} 50 {{years of}} successful operations in 2006. Many similar institutions established {{in other parts}} of the world, most notably following World War II, have ceased to exist because they have become financially not viable. The DFCC is one among a small number of DFIs that not only has continued to remain viable, but also has been successful in transforming itself into a multi-product and robust financial institution in a changing international and local environment. Why and how did the DFCC succeed when other similar institutions failed? <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>do</b> that others <b>did</b> not, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>do</b> differently? <b>What</b> was unique in its structure or governance framework that may have enabled it to withstand more effectively the varied political and other pressures it may have been subjected to as a development-oriented institution that worked closely with the government?
