40|$|A {{comparison}} {{of the effectiveness of}} 5 presentation methods for the teaching of spelling was made with 359 children, where the words to be learned were presented in either isolation or in context, and where the method of learning involved either the study of the whole word, the 'hard' spot or the individual letters of each spelling. A battery of tests was given to the subjects in order to obtain measures of some of the individual characteristics thought to be relevant to the investigation. The administration of the test battery and working through the spelling learning programme covered a period of four months. At the beginning of the investigation the age range of the children was from 9 years 2 months to 10 years 3 months. Results showed that a systematic approach to the learning of words leads to improvement in spelling performance. Analyses of variance revealed;- 1. Significant differences between the <b>average</b> <b>gain</b> <b>scores</b> of the non-manual and manual social class groups, the latter making the larger gains. 2. Significant differences between the five presentation methods; the five treatments were as follows: - Presentation: Method Presentation Method of Learning: P List form of isolated words. Whole word; Q List form of words + meanings. Whole word; R Initially in a story. Then words + meanings + use in sentences. Whole word. S. Initially in a story. Then attention to 'hard spots' + meanings + use in sentences. Part word T. Initially in a story. Then attention to individual letters + meanings + use in sentences. Part word. The results indicated that an approach which presents the words in context and utilises a whole word method of learning (Presentation method R), is the most effective one to use with a whole class of mixed social class groups. 3. There {{were no significant differences between}} methods of learning which (a) used an oral and (b) a written response mode. 4. Highly significant differences were found between a learning task of four words and that of six words daily, with the latter giving consistently higher gain scores for presentation methods and social class groups. Using standardised test results as measures of factors within the subjects, and the average pre-test, post-test and gain scores as the dependent variables; three series of regression analyses were carried out. Results showed that by far the most powerful predictor of spelling performance was the spelling age. The highest additional contribution to the pre-test and gain scores being made by the verbal reasoning quotient, and to the post test scores by the silent reading age. The child variables of spelling age, verbal reasoning quotient, reading age, and the recall of words, (using visual and auditory presentation), measured immediately before the beginning of the learning of the sets of words, showed high inter-correlations and also correlated highly with the three dependent variables...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effectiveness of two instructional models (In-Class and Pull-Out) and their impact on the achievement of students enrolled in the Chapter I Compensatory Program. An additional purpose was to investigate the impact of the principals’ leadership styles and teacher attitudes on the efficacy of these methods. Methods and Procedures-The first, second, and third grades of 30 Atlanta Public Schools of Area I served as the target population for this study. There were 52, 869 students from low—income families in the Atlanta Public Schools in 1982 - 3 [...] 9, 327 of those students were first, second, and third graders [...] 37 of those students were enrolled in Area I of the Atlanta Schools. It is from this 937 students who represented better than 10 % of the population of those grade levels that information was gathered. <b>Average</b> <b>gain</b> <b>scores</b> of the California Achievement Test (CAT) were collected and examined for students in grades 1, 2, and 3 between 1981 and 1985. The Minnesota Teacher Attitude Inventory was administered to 275 regular (first, second, and third grade) teachers and Chapter I (specialists) teachers. Principals’ leadership styles were determined by qualified judgement, and a 10 -item questionnaire was developed to acquire specific information related to the study. Five hypotheses and nine research questions were developed to assist in the research findings. The method used was normative survey utilizing appropriate statistical techniques to analyze data. Results- There was no significant difference between the CAT NCE gains of Chapter I students enrolled in the “Pull-out” or “In-class” model. There was no significant relationship between the attitudes of teachers as measured by the MTAI and the 1984 - 85 NCE gains made by Chapter I students. There was no significant difference between teacher scores on the MTAI and the three different principals’ leadership styles (Initiator, Manager, Responder). There was a significant difference between the CAT NCE gains of Chapter I students beyond the. 05 level of significance in the school years from 1981 - 82 to 1984 - 85. There was also a significant difference beyond the. 05 and. 01 F- probability between the 1984 - 85 NCE gains of Chapter I students attending schools with principals because of the principals’ leadership styles. The “Manager” style of leadership was superior to the “Initiator” and “Responder” styles in reading and mathematics. The “Initiator” style of leadership in mathematics was also significant beyond the. 05 level. Statistical analysis was by Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Specific information gathered from the questionnaire indicated that teachers prefer the “Pull-out” model over the “In-class” model for instruction. Teachers feel that the principal supports the compensatory program and makes a difference in the success of the compensatory program, and also that teacher aides are needed. Teachers also believe that students can fulfill their needs best when teachers work as a team. The conflicting nature of the previous conclusion comes as a result of the “Pull-out” model representing the instruction by the teacher working alone. Conclusion-The role of the principal as instructional leader and the significant gains of the students enrolled in the Chapter I compensatory program reveal enough evidence for continued emphasis and study of the merits of these results. Teacher attitudes, as measured by MTAI, provided meaningful information; however, it is suggested that additional attitude surveys be developed to meet the present research needs on achievement. The information has provided enough positive findings for further research in methods of instruction, leadership styles, and teacher attitudes as they impact on the achievement of Compensatory Education Programs as well as the regular program for effective schools...|$|E

40|$|The {{problem was}} to {{determine}} whether a method of aural and visual vocal training that included a program of portable electronic piano keyboard experience would be more effective in teaching sight-singing skills to novice high school chorus students than a method that included only aural and visual vocal training. A sub-problem {{was to determine}} whether novice chorus students enjoyed playing electronic keyboards in chorus as a reinforcement experience in sight-singing training. Students were randomly assigned to two treatment groups, tested with the Musical Aptitude Profile, Tonal Imagery, part A, and then trained separately. The experimental group sang repetitions of melodic patterns and utilized techniques associated with the Kodály Method while simultaneously playing keyboard. The comparison group received a similar treatment without using keyboards. The students were pre- and post-tested in sight-singing using the Vocal Sight-Reading Inventory. Results of the Analysis of Covariance using MAP scores as the covariate revealed no significant difference (p<. 05) between post-test scores of the two groups. Improvement was noted in 96 % of students from pre-test to post-test regardless of grouping. The repeated measures ANOVA revealed a significant relationship (p<. 006) between aptitude group and post-test score.

In Chapter II we examine charter effect test <b>score</b> <b>gains</b> for charter students. After controlling for individual student characteristics, we find that students in their first year in a charter school have large negative test <b>score</b> <b>gains</b> compared to when they were in traditional public school, and that charter schools that have been in operation for more than one year have higher <b>average</b> test <b>score</b> <b>gains</b> than new charter schools. Charter schools appear to have the most positive effects on African-American students. We find that the overall effect of being in a charter school for multiple years is that students have slightly lower average test score growth than when they were in a traditional public school. In Chapter III we examine the effect of charters on test <b>score</b> <b>gains</b> for students attending nearby traditional public schools. After controlling for campus and student characteristics, we find traditional public school districts and campuses that face greater competition from charter schools have higher <b>average</b> test <b>score</b> <b>gains</b> than other traditional public schools. This positive effect of charter competition is strongest for African-American and Hispanic students, and is focused entirely on students attending traditional public campuses in the bottom 50 % of the initial campus average achievement distribution. In Chapter IV we examine the charter effect on the distribution of students by ability and race/ethnicity, as well as examining what factors are associated with a student choosing to move to a charter school. We find that students who move to charter schools tend to move to schools with a higher percentage of students of their same race/ethnicity, and that this gap is largest for African-American students. We also find that average math and reading test scores are lower than the statewide average at the traditional public schools that charter students leave, and that charter schools are attracting, on average, the lower-performing students from these lowperforming schools...|$|R

This study investigated the effect of a two-semester program of nonacademic interventions on the personal development of entering Black students at Northern Illinois University (NIU). Unique to this study was the emphasis on facilitating noncognitive needs that impact the retention of students. Two instruments were administered as pretests and posttests to 63 regularly admitted Black students. Tracey's Non-Cognitive Questionnaire was used to assess noncognitive factors that are related to academic success especially for minority students. Prince's, Miller's, and Winston's Student Developmental Task Inventory was used to measure achievement of developmental tasks of traditional-age college students. The Questionnaire of Satisfaction with NIU (QS-NIU), given {{at the end of the}} program, was used to assess the level of satisfaction the students experienced during their first year of college. The Minority Students Assistance Program (MSAP), designed and implemented by the researcher, contained three components: (a) support group meetings, (b) mentoring by upperclassmen, and (c) personal interviews.

40|$|One current {{educational}} reform seeks to reward the "value added" {{by teachers and}} schools based on the average change in pupil test scores over time. In this paper, we outline {{the conditions under which}} the average change in scores is sufficient to rank schools in terms of value added. A key condition is that socioeconomic outcomes be a linear function of test scores. Absent this condition, one can still derive the optimal value-added policy if one knows the relationship between test scores and socioeconomic outcomes, and the distribution of test scores {{both before and after the}} intervention. Using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, we find a nonlinear relationship between test scores and one important outcome: log wages. We find no consistent pattern in the curvature of log wage returns to test scores (whether percentiles, scaled, or raw scores). This implies that, used alone, the <b>average</b> <b>gain</b> in test <b>scores</b> is an inadequate measure of school performance and current value-added methodology may misdirect school resources. © 2000 by the President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology...|$|R

50|$|As {{the peaks}} of the sine wave {{approach}} the supply rails, the saturation of the amplifier device flattens (clips) the peaks, reducing the gain. For example, the oscillator might have a loop gain of 3 for small signals, but that loop gain instaneously drops to zero when the output reaches one of the power supply rails. The net effect is the oscillator amplitude will stabilize when <b>average</b> <b>gain</b> over a cycle is one. If the <b>average</b> loop <b>gain</b> is greater than one, the output amplitude increases until the nonlinearity reduces the <b>average</b> <b>gain</b> to one; if the <b>average</b> loop <b>gain</b> is less than one, then the output amplitude decreases until the <b>average</b> <b>gain</b> is one. The nonlinearity that reduces the gain may also be more subtle than running into a power supply rail.|$|R
30|$|This {{study has}} some {{limitations}} which {{have to be}} pointed out. First, such surgeon-initiated questionnaires can be biased {{in favor of the}} surgery, because patients may be reluctant to express their dissatisfaction to their surgeons (Lee and Most 2016). We attempted to reduce this bias by asking patients to complete the ROE questionnaire anonymously. We think {{that the best way to}} increase the objectivity of such a patient reported outcome study is to conduct the survey by an independent researcher other than the operating surgeon. Second, single-center studies frequently lack the external validity required to generalize the results to a broader population. This is because operative techniques and follow-up protocols after revision rhinoplasty vary widely among surgeons. However, our findings represent a starting point for the evaluation of patient satisfaction after revision rhinoplasty. They allow larger controlled multi-center studies to be planned appropriately in order to include a wider range of population groups and to compare results among centers, all of which increase the generalizability of the results. Third, the design of this study did not allow us to assess the psychological factors that may have an influence on patient satisfaction. However, previous studies showed that the best candidates for rhinoplasty are psychologically stable patients who have requests focused on a specific physical feature (Vuyk and Zijlker 1995). Fourth, the six patients who were called but did not agree to participate in the study could have affected the <b>average</b> <b>gain</b> in satisfaction <b>scores.</b> These patients may not be interested in further evaluation because of their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the results.|$|R
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that measures of gain, growth, or change, expressed as simple differences between pretest and posttest scores, are inherently unreliable. It is also believed that <b>gain</b> <b>scores</b> lack predictive validity with respect to other criteria. However, these conclusions are based on misleading assumptions about the values of parameters in familiar equations in classical test theory. The present paper examines modified equations for the validity and reliability of difference scores that describe applied testing situations more realistically and reveal that simple <b>gain</b> <b>scores</b> can be more useful in research than commonly believed.
