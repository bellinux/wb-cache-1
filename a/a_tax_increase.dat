5|$|As {{governor}} Beckham {{sought to}} unite his {{party and the}} state. As part of this effort he supported changes to the blatantly partisan Goebel Election Law, authored by his late running mate while the latter {{was a member of}} the General Assembly. He stressed non-controversial issues such as improvements to roads and the state's educational system. He recommended passage of a law to set uniform school textbook prices, a reform both he and Goebel had advocated during the gubernatorial campaign. However, his passive leadership ensured that the General Assembly did little to address his agenda. The only major pieces of legislation passed during Beckham's term were <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> <b>increase</b> that added a half million dollars to the state's revenue and a child labor law that forbade children under 14to work without their parents' consent.|$|E

25|$|During the 2007 {{budget discussions}} from January 8 to 12, 2007, O'Brien voted against a passed motion {{that would have}} {{required}} city staff to implement two draft budgets, including one with a tax freeze and another with <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> <b>increase</b> within {{the rate of inflation}}. After several budget meetings, O'Brien criticized several councillors for supporting <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> <b>increase</b> within the rate of inflation and for not taking the procedures seriously. Councillors later replied that O'Brien's comments do not improve the relations between the mayor and the City Council.

25|$|Critics, {{including}} some conservatives, complained that Romney was using these fees increases as <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> <b>increase</b> in disguise after having promised {{he would not}} raise taxes. Romney said that the fees were distinct from taxes because fees were charged for particular services provided whereas taxes were assessed more broadly, without expectation of any specific services — although critics noted that this explanation applied to {{only some of the}} fees Romney proposed.|$|E

25|$|In 1998, {{when the}} {{economic}} crisis became apparent, the national government could {{not respond to the}} call of the local politicians and mayors had to introduce austerity measures under pressure from creditors, which caused the vallecaucano development model to collapse.

25|$|One {{explanation}} is that older Californians with fixed incomes had increasing difficulty paying property taxes, which were rising {{as a result of}} California's population growth, increasing housing demand, and inflation. Due to severe inflation during the 1970s, reassessments of residential property increased property taxes so much, that some retired people could no longer afford to remain in homes they had purchased long before. An academic study found support for this explanation, reporting that older voters, homeowners, and voters expecting <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> <b>increase</b> were more likely to vote for Proposition 13.|$|E

The government claims that these <b>tax</b> <b>increases</b> were comparable to increases instituted in 1998 under the United Democratic Party (UDP). However, after years of popular frustration at alleged financial mismanagement and corruption by the People's United Party (PUP), the new budget sparked condemnation from local interest groups and protests at the National Assembly building on January 14, with demonstrations continued throughout the following week. The main protesters were the National Trade Union Congress of Belize and the Belize Chamber of Commerce.|$|R

40|$|In a three-sector general {{equilibrium}} model {{we examine}} the impact of <b>a</b> partial <b>tax</b> on labour on skilled-unskilled wage inequality.

Furthermore, introduction of <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> on labour in agricultural sector has no effect on the skilled wage, but reduces the unskilled wage.

25|$|The Confederate {{government}} initially {{wanted to}} finance its war mostly through tariffs on imports, export taxes, and voluntary donations of gold. After the spontaneous imposition of an embargo on cotton sales to Europe in 1861, these sources of revenue dried {{up and the}} Confederacy increasingly turned to issuing debt and printing {{money to pay for}} war expenses. The Confederate States politicians were worried about angering the general population with hard taxes. <b>A</b> <b>tax</b> <b>increase</b> might disillusion many Southerners, so the Confederacy resorted to printing more money. As a result, inflation increased and remained a problem for the southern states {{throughout the rest of the}} war. By April 1863, for example, the cost of flour in Richmond had risen to $100 a barrel and housewives were rioting.|$|E

Ford was criticized greatly for quickly switching from advocating <b>a</b> <b>tax</b> <b>increase</b> to a tax reduction. In Congress, the proposed amount of the tax reduction increased to $22.8billion in tax cuts and lacked spending cuts. In March 1975, Congress passed, and Ford signed into law, these income tax rebates {{as part of the}} Tax Reduction Act of 1975. This resulted in a federal deficit of around $53billion for the 1975 fiscal year and $73.7billion for 1976.|$|E
25|$|The Lee County Board of Education has {{announced}} plans to close Beattyville Elementary and transfer the students to Southside Elementary. To accommodate the influx of students, an expansion of the facilities at Southside will be required.

Residents of the county signed a petition to place the tax increase on the ballot. The school board decided to delay the implementation of the tax until 2014 so as not to have to pay approximately $20,000 to fund a special election. The school board passed the tax in 2014 and again, a petition was filed placing the matter on the ballot for the fall 2014 general election.
