5|$|In 1992 {{the sons}} of Miguel Vázquez were {{introduced}} to the wrestling world as Espanto IV and Espanto V, forming a regular tag team in and around Monterrey, Nuevo León, Mexico. The duo lost their masks to the team of Blue Fish and Mongol Chino, although the team of Stuka and Stuka Jr. is also credited with unmasking them. It is possible that Espanto IV and V agreed to lose their masks to both teams, but in different locations in Mexico. Before the internet there were examples of luchadors getting an <b>additional</b> <b>payment</b> for losing their mask on multiple occasions. The brothers have worked for various Mexican promotions and toured Japan while working for the Japanese Universal Wrestling Federation and Michinoku Pro. In Japan they unsuccessfully challenged the Great Sasuke and Gran Hamada for the UWA/UWF Intercontinental Tag Team Championship.|$|E
25|$|Demolition {{work was}} {{conducted}} by demolition contractors who competed for the various contracts offered by the HAT. The complexity of these contracts led to confusion sometimes between the contractors and the HAT. In one case, between the HAT and Demolition Services Ltd., where Demolition Services Ltd. had been contracted to demolish two 13-storey tower blocks and remove asbestos from the insulation panels, legal advice was sought by the contractor after they discovered further asbestos in the finishes to the ceilings, walls and floors. Demolition Services Ltd. wanted an <b>additional</b> <b>payment</b> of £300,000 but the HAT argued that the removal of these features {{were part of the}} contract. Nonetheless, the HAT were forced to make the <b>additional</b> <b>payment</b> in court.|$|E

After protracted and testy negotiations, Fields agreed to a reduced stake of 25% in the airline (renamed Virgin Atlantic) and became its first chairman. Following disagreements over operations, Fields agreed to be bought out for an initial sum of £1million with further payment on Virgin's first dividend. As a result of a High Court action, this <b>additional</b> <b>payment</b> was received shortly before Fields' death in 1997.|$|E
25|$|The Canterbury Provincial Government had {{commissioned}} {{the construction of}} the Christchurch to Lyttelton railway and tunnel, but their first contractor (Smith & Knight) sought a significant <b>additional</b> <b>payment</b> over what had been agreed on, which the provincial government did not accept. William Moorhouse, the Superintendent (i.e. the elected head of the provincial council) at the time and proponent of the project, travelled to Melbourne to find a new contractor. Whilst the price submitted by Holmes and Richardson was the highest of three tenders, Moorhouse engaged them as he had confidence in their technical ability.|$|E

25|$|In {{the ensuing}} years, Drigo {{repeatedly}} received commissions from both Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov to compose supplemental variations, pas and incidental dances for insertion into older ballets. By the time Drigo left Russia in 1919, nearly every ballet in the repertory of the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres contained {{many of the}} composer's own additional pieces. Drigo later commented in his memoirs that he composed about 80 such pieces, and rarely received any <b>additional</b> <b>payment</b> for them. During the late 19th century, Petipa began to mount revivals of older ballets with increasing frequency, and the ballet master invariably called upon Drigo to revise and supplement the scores accordingly.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} legal instruments {{for the promotion}} of renewable energy are Law 25,019 from 1998 and Law 26,190 from 2007. The 1998 law, known as the “National Wind and Solar Energy Rules”, declared wind and solar generation of national interest and introduced a mechanism that established an <b>additional</b> <b>payment</b> per generated kWh which, in 1998, meant a 40% premium over market price. It also granted certain tax exemptions for a period of 15 years from the law's promulgation. The 2007 Law complemented the previous one, declaring of national interest the generation of electricity from any renewable source intended to deliver a public service. This law also set an 8% target for renewable energy consumption in the period of 10 years and mandated the creation of a trust fund whose resources will be allocated to pay a premium for electricity produced from renewable sources.|$|E
25|$|On November 15, 1979, {{a meeting}} took {{place with a}} US {{delegation}} and the Portuguese government and military command to discuss the acquisition of the new fighters. A first proposal was {{for the purchase of}} 20 F-5 Tiger II to be delivered between May and October 1981, at a cost of 120 million dollars; additional spare parts were not included. Since the agreement {{for the use of the}} Lajes Air Base by the United States was only valued at 72 million dollars, Portugal would have been required to take out a 48 million dollar loan through the FMS, which would also dry up funds to acquire other types of aircraft and would require the <b>additional</b> <b>payment</b> of loan interest rates. Another proposal valued at 79 million dollars was for 12 F-5 fighters to be delivered between May and August 1981. This proposal would still have required a loan of 7 million dollars through the FMS and would not even have allowed for the formation of a complete squadron. The final proposal was for the acquisition of 30 A-7A Corsair II for 49 million dollars, which would be paid completely with the money from the Lajes agreement and that would have still have left funds for the modernization of the aircraft.|$|E

25|$|Norman James {{had hoped}} to produce the serial himself but the BBC felt it was too complex an {{undertaking}} for a novice producer. However, James was given the role of co-producer and designer; he also received an <b>additional</b> <b>payment</b> in acknowledgement of his role in developing the serial. Assigned as co-producer and director was Michael Hayes who had directed the Shakespearean serial An Age of Kings (1960). Location filming took place in July 1961 around London, including at IBM's offices on Wigmore Street, and {{in the vicinity of}} Tenby in Pembrokeshire, Wales where the Manorbier Army Base stood in for the Thorness research centre. The army assisted the production by providing a helicopter for scenes of personnel arriving at Thorness and for aerial shots of the base and environs. They also supplied a pursuit launch for the chase scene in the final episode. A number of pre-filmed inserts were also shot at Ealing Studios. The production then went into studio at BBC Television Centre with each episode recorded every Wednesday between 1 August 1961 and 13 September 1961. For editing purposes, the output of the electronic studio cameras was recorded onto 35mm film rather than videotape. A last minute addition to the serial were the pre-credits sequences at the start of each episode depicting Reinhart recalling the events of the serial in a television interview. These were made {{in the style of the}} well-known interview programme Face to Face hosted by John Freeman and were shot at Television Centre on 22 September 1961.|$|E

Telford United had a bid of £1,500 {{and a small}} <b>additional</b> <b>payment</b> for Smith {{rejected}} in January 2008, which Worcester manager Richard Dryden labelled as [...] "derisory". A.F.C. Telford made a second bid, and {{if this had been}} successful, Smith would have become the club's record signing, as the eventual payment would have exceeded the £5,000 paid for Lee Moore in 2006. Worcester rejected A.F.C. Telford's second bid of £5,000, which would have potentially risen to a figure believed to be around £7,000 based on appearances, on 31 January 2008. He received his 10th yellow card of the season during a 1–0 defeat away to Stalybridge on 22 March 2008, resulting in a two-match suspension. His return came in a 6–0 defeat away to Blyth Spartans on 12 April 2008, before playing in the second leg of the Worcestershire Senior Cup final against Redditch, which Worcester lost 2–0 on the day and 2–1 on aggregate. The 2007–08 season, which Smith said was the worst of his career to date due to the injuries suffered throughout, saw him make 34 appearances and score three goals.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Miller {{established}} a rival firm, the Cyclops Iron Company, with Andrew Carnegie as an investor. The Cyclops firm opened in October 1864. Thomas Carnegie, however, was deeply {{concerned that the}} Cyclops company would harm his own interests in Iron City Forge, and successfully prevailed on Andrew to merge the two firms. (It may also be true that Andrew Carnegie always intended to merge the two firms {{in order to gain}} control of both, and used Thomas for this purpose.) Kloman and Phipps at first refused, but Thomas made an offer of all the shares in Cyclops plus an <b>additional</b> <b>payment</b> of $50,000 (a very large sum at the time).

2500|$|In {{spite of}} this {{negative}} publicity, New York's assembly in April passed a bill pardoning the New Hampshire grantees of offenses they may have committed, and recognizing, without requiring <b>additional</b> <b>payment,</b> the New Hampshire grants and those issued later by the Vermont Republic. [...] This appeared to clear the significant legal roadblocks to Vermont's statehood, but the east side Yorkers {{continued to be a}} persistent problem, with Governor Clinton almost encouraging them to engage in acts of resistance against the Vermont administration, even issuing commissions for New York judicial positions covering the affected area. [...] The situation got bad enough that Ethan Allen, in some secrecy, raised 250 men and marched on the town of Guilford, which was the epicenter of Yorker activity. [...] This resulted in the arrest, trial, and banishment of the Yorker ringleaders in October 1782, and the seizure of some of their property. [...] This prompted Congress to demand that Vermont compensate the affected individuals.|$|E
2500|$|The Working Time Regulations 1998 {{set limits}} on working time, and {{implement}} the basic {{requirements of the}} Working Time Directive. Paid holidays are the most concrete measure, following basic standards in international law. Every worker is entitled to a minimum of 28 days, or four full weeks each year (though this includes public holidays). There is no qualifying period for this, or any other working time right, because the law seeks to ensure both a balance between work and life, and that people have enough rest and leisure to promote better physical and psychological health and safety. Because the purpose is for workers to have the genuine freedom to rest, employers may not give a worker [...] "rolled up holiday pay", for instance an additional 12.5% in a wage bill, in lieu of taking actual holidays. However, if the worker has not used his or her holidays before the job terminates, the employer must give an <b>additional</b> <b>payment</b> for the unused holiday entitlement.|$|E
2500|$|Bank of America {{received}} $20billion in {{the federal}} bailout from the U.S. government through the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) on January 16, 2009, and a guarantee of $118billion in potential losses at the company. This was {{in addition to the}} $25billion given to them in the fall of 2008 through TARP. The <b>additional</b> <b>payment</b> was part of a deal with the U.S. government to preserve Bank of America's merger with the troubled investment firm Merrill Lynch. Since then, members of the U.S. Congress have expressed considerable concern about how this money has been spent, especially since some of the recipients have been accused of misusing the bailout money. Then CEO Ken Lewis was quoted as claiming [...] "We are still lending, and we are lending far more because of the TARP program." [...] Members of the U.S. House of Representatives, however, were skeptical and quoted many anecdotes about loan applicants (particularly small business owners) being denied loans and credit card holders facing stiffer terms on the debt in their card accounts.|$|E

2500|$|Problems {{with the}} Savoyes caused {{by all the}} {{requests}} for <b>additional</b> <b>payment</b> from the contractors for all the changes were compounded by the requirement for early repairs to the new house. Each autumn the Savoyes suffered problems with rainwater leaks through the roof. By refusing downpipes and sills which would interrupt their aesthetic, the white surfaces were more susceptible to staining and erosion due to the water pour-down. Additionally, these building was also scarred with cracks because the material was not designed for structural durability. The Savoyes continued {{to live in the}} house until 1940, leaving during World War II. It was occupied twice during the war: first by the Germans - when it was used as a hay store - and then by the Americans, with both occupations damaging the building severely. The Savoyes returned to their estate after the war, but, no longer in position to live as they had done before the war, they abandoned the house again shortly after. The villa was expropriated by the town of Poissy in 1958, which first used it as a public youth center and later considered demolishing it {{to make way for a}} schoolhouse complex. Protest from architects who felt the house should be saved, and the intervention of Corbusier himself, spared the house from demolition. A first attempt of restoration was begun in 1963 by architect Jean Debuisson, despite opposition from Corbusier. The villa was added to the French register of historical monuments in 1965, becoming the first modernist building designated as historical monument in France, and also the first to be the object of restoration while its architect was still living. In 1985, a thorough state-funded restoration process, led by architect Jean-Louis Véret, was undertaken, being completed in 1997. The restoration included structural and surface repairs to the facades and terraces because of deterioration of the concrete, [...] the installation of lighting and security cameras, and the reinstatement of some of the original fixtures and fittings.|$|E
