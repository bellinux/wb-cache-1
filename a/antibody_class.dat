25|$|The T {{helper cells}} (Th cells) are {{a type of}} T cell that play an {{important}} role in the immune system, particularly in the adaptive immune system. They help the activity of other immune cells by releasing T cell cytokines. These cells help suppress or regulate immune responses. They are essential in B cell <b>antibody</b> <b>class</b> switching, in the activation and growth of cytotoxic T cells, and in maximizing bactericidal activity of phagocytes such as macrophages.|$|E
25|$|<b>Antibody</b> <b>class</b> {{switching}} declines significantly once helper T cell function fails. The {{immune system}} loses {{its ability to}} improve the affinity of their antibodies, and are unable to generate B cells that can produce antibody groups such as IgG and IgA. These effects are primarily due {{to the loss of}} any helper T cell that can interact with the B lymphocyte correctly. Another symptom of AIDS is the reduction in antibody levels due to a decrease in Th2 cytokines (and less interactions by helper T cells). All of these complications result in an increased susceptibility to aggressive bacterial infections, especially in areas of the body not accessible by IgM antibodies.|$|E

40|$|Summary: The role of {{antibodies}} to Tamm-Horsfall protein {{in the diagnosis}} of acute pyelonephritis was studied. Antibodies to Tamm-Horsfall protein were also determined {{in a group of}} normal subjects. Patients with acute pyelonephritis were divided into subgroups according to the concurrent presence of vesicoureteral reflux or nephrol-ithiasis. No statistically significant differences (p> 0. 05) were observed for any <b>class</b> of <b>antibodies</b> (IgG, IgA and IgM) between the groups of healthy subjects and patients with acute pyelonephritis, regardless of {{the presence or absence of}} vesicoureteral reflux or nephrolithiasis. Values for different <b>antibody</b> <b>classes</b> showed that IgM antibodies were the most abundant in all the groups examined. A difference in the values of IgM relative to IgA and IgG antibodies was found to be statistically significant in the patient group only (p 0. 05) between the values of IgM and of other <b>antibody</b> <b>classes.</b> In these patients, however, the highest values of all the three <b>antibody</b> <b>classes</b> were obtained, although these differences were also not statistically significant (p> 0. 05).

5|$|In summary, the Fab {{region of}} the {{antibody}} determines antigen specificity while the Fc {{region of the}} antibody determines the <b>antibody's</b> <b>class</b> effect. Since only the constant domains of the heavy chains make up the Fc region of an <b>antibody,</b> the <b>classes</b> of heavy chain in <b>antibodies</b> determine their <b>class</b> effects. Possible classes of heavy chains in antibodies include alpha, gamma, delta, epsilon, and mu, and they define the antibody's isotypes IgA, G, D, E, and M, respectively. This infers different isotypes of <b>antibodies</b> have different <b>class</b> effects due to their different Fc regions binding and activating different types of receptors. Possible <b>class</b> effects of <b>antibodies</b> include: Opsonisation, agglutination, haemolysis, complement activation, mast cell degranulation, and neutralisation (though this class effect may be mediated by the Fab region rather than the Fc region). It also implies that Fab-mediated effects are directed at microbes or toxins, whilst Fc mediated effects are directed at effector cells or effector molecules (see below).|$|R

40|$|Patients {{with the}} Aspergillus-induced {{diseases}} allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), aspergilloma (fungus ball), and Aspergillus skin test-positive asthma were differentiated immunologically by radioimmunoassay {{based on their}} total immunoglobulin E (IgE) and Aspergillus fumigatus-specific IgE levels. In this study, a new, highly sensitive biotin-avidin-linked immunosorbent assay {{was used to evaluate}} A. fumigatus-specific antibodies of all immunoglobulin classes. Studied populations included 13 patients with ABPA, 12 with aspergilloma, 9 with Aspergillus skin test-positive asthma, and 9 normal individuals without asthma. A. fumigatus-specific <b>antibodies</b> of all <b>classes</b> were elevated in patients with ABPA, variably elevated in those with aspergilloma, and lowest in the other two groups. This assay demonstrated significantly higher specific IgE antibody levels in the ABPA group over those of the other groups, even with 1 : 1, 000 dilutions of the sera. This study demonstrated that ABPA is a disease characterized by a polyclonal antibody response to Aspergillus antigen and not just a response to IgE and IgG <b>antibody</b> <b>classes.</b> The measurement of other <b>antibody</b> <b>classes,</b> particularly IgD and IgA, could enhance the immunodiagnosis of ABPA.

50|$|Protein L {{was first}} {{isolated}} {{from the surface of}} bacterial species Peptostreptococcus magnus and was found to bind immunoglobulins through L chain interaction, from which the name was suggested. It consists of 719 amino acid residues. The molecular weight of Protein L purified from the cell walls of Peptostreptoccus magnus was first estimated as 95kD by SDS-PAGE in the presence of reducing agent 2-mercaptoethanol, while the molecular weight was determined to 76kD by gel chromotography in the presence of 6 M guanidine HCl. Protein L does not contain any interchain disulfide loops, nor does it consist of disulfide-linked subunits. It was an acidic molecule with a PI of 4.0. Unlike Protein A and Protein G, which bind to the Fc region of immunoglobulins (antibodies), Protein L binds antibodies through light chain interactions. Since no part of the heavy chain is involved in the binding interaction, Protein L binds a wider range of <b>antibody</b> <b>classes</b> than Protein A or G. Protein L binds to representatives of all <b>antibody</b> <b>classes,</b> including IgG, IgM, IgA, IgE and IgD. Single chain variable fragments (scFv) and Fab fragments also bind to Protein L.|$|R

50|$|Naïve mature B cells produce both IgM and IgD, {{which are}} the first two heavy chain {{segments}} in the immunoglobulin locus. After activation by antigen, these B cells proliferate. If these activated B cells encounter specific signaling molecules via their CD40 and cytokine receptors (both modulated by T helper cells), they undergo <b>antibody</b> <b>class</b> switching to produce IgG, IgA or IgE antibodies. During class switching, the constant region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain changes but the variable regions, and therefore antigenic specificity, stay the same. This allows different daughter cells from the same activated B cell to produce antibodies of different isotypes or subtypes (e.g. IgG1, IgG2 etc.).|$|E

50|$|Since {{the initial}} {{description}} of CFSE {{it has been}} used in thousands of immunological studies, an example of an early proliferation study in animals being described by Kurts et al. However, perhaps the most important CFSE investigations have been those demonstrating that many of the effector functions of lymphocytes, such as cytokine production by T lymphocytes, and <b>antibody</b> <b>class</b> switching by B cells, are division dependent. Sophisticated mathematical models have also been developed to analyse CFSE data and probe various aspects of immune responses. Furthermore, the use of CFSE has extended beyond the immune system, with the dye being used to monitor the proliferation of many other cell types such as smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, hematopoietic stem cells and even bacteria. Another novel application of CFSE is its use for the in vitro and in vivo determination of cytotoxic lymphocytes.|$|E
5000|$|Class {{switching}} occurs by {{a mechanism}} called class switch recombination (CSR) binding. Class switch recombination is a biological mechanism {{that allows the}} class of antibody produced by an activated B cell to change during {{a process known as}} isotype or class switching. During CSR, portions of the antibody heavy chain locus are removed from the chromosome, and the gene segments surrounding the deleted portion are rejoined to retain a functional antibody gene that produces antibody of a different isotype. Double-stranded breaks are generated in DNA at conserved nucleotide motifs, called switch (S) regions, which are upstream from gene segments that encode the constant regions of antibody heavy chains; these occur adjacent to all heavy chain constant region genes {{with the exception of the}} δ-chain. DNA is nicked and broken at two selected S-regions by the activity of a series of enzymes, including Activation-Induced (Cytidine) Deaminase (AID), uracil DNA glycosylase and apyrimidic/apurinic (AP)-endonucleases. The intervening DNA between the S-regions is subsequently deleted from the chromosome, removing unwanted μ or δ heavy chain constant region exons and allowing substitution of a γ, α or ε constant region gene segment. The free ends of the DNA are rejoined by a process called non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) to link the variable domain exon to the desired downstream constant domain exon of the antibody heavy chain. In the absence of non-homologous end joining, free ends of DNA may be rejoined by an alternative pathway biased toward microhomology joins. [...] With the exception of the μ and δ genes, only one <b>antibody</b> <b>class</b> is expressed by a B cell at any point in time.While class switch recombination is mostly a deletional process, rearranging a chromosome in [...] "cis", it can also occur (in 10 to 20% of cases, depending upon the Ig class) as an inter-chromosomal translocation mixing immunoglobulin heavy chain genes from both alleles.|$|E
