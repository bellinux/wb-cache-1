Within these deep-sea habitats, assemblages of scavenging fauna {{play a vital role in}} reintroducing organic matter from large food falls into the wider deep-sea food chain. Free-fall baited traps were set at different depths within three submarine canyons on the Iberian Margin. Amphipods from the traps were identified to species level and counted.

Using data from literature, abyssal plain assemblages were compared to submarine canyon assemblages. Samples from canyons were found to contain common <b>abyssal</b> plain <b>species</b> but in greater than expected abundances. It is proposed that this is a result of the high organic carbon input into canyon systems owing to their interception of sediment from the continental shelf and input from associated estuarine systems.

The cause of this difference cannot be attributed to one environmental variable due to the numerous inherent differences between canyons and abyssal plains...|$|R

40|$|Abstract How {{deep-sea fauna}} evolved is a {{question}} still being investigated. One of the most accepted theories is that shallow water organisms migrated to deeper waters and gave origin to the deep-sea communities. However, many organisms are prevented from performing long vertical migrations by the increasing hydrostatic pressure. Tadpole larvae of the ascidian Polyandrocarpa zorritensis were submitted to pressure treatments of 1, 50, 100 and 200 atm. Survival, settlement and metamorphosis rates were verified after 24 hour incubation in a pressure chamber. The majority of larvae settled (84 %, 62 %, 83 % and 77 % respectively) and successfully underwent metamorphosis (93 %, 59 %, 85 % and 60 %) in all pressure treatments. Larval mortality was of less than 15 % in all treatments, except for the 50 atm treatment, which presented 38 % mortality. Nearly 100 % of the surviving larvae underwent metamorphosis in the treatments of 1, 50 and 100 atm. However, 1 / 3 of the individuals were still in their larval stages in the 200 atm treatment and presented delayed development. These data suggest that ascidian larvae can withstand the hydrostatic pressure levels found in the deep-sea. It is therefore feasible that the current <b>abyssal</b> ascidian <b>species</b> may have colonized the deep-sea through vertical migration and {{in only a few}} generations...|$|R
5|$|Though {{the plains}} were once {{assumed to be}} vast, desert-like habitats, {{research}} {{over the past decade}} or so shows that they teem with a wide variety of microbial life. However, ecosystem structure and function at the deep seafloor have historically been very poorly studied because of the size and remoteness of the abyss. Recent oceanographic expeditions conducted by an international group of scientists from the Census of Diversity of Abyssal Marine Life (CeDAMar) have found an extremely high level of biodiversity on abyssal plains, with up to 2000 species of bacteria, 250 species of protozoans, and 500 species of invertebrates (worms, crustaceans and molluscs), typically found at single <b>abyssal</b> sites.

40|$|Ilyphagus Chamberlin, 1919 {{includes}} <b>abyssal,</b> fragile benthic <b>species.</b> Most {{species have}} large cephalic cages but chaetae are brittle and easily lost {{which may explain}} why the original definition included species with a cephalic cage or without it. The type species, I. bythincola Chamberlin, 1919, together with another species (I. pluto Chamberlin, 1919) were described as lacking a cephalic cage whereas a third species (I. ascendens Chamberlin, 1919) was described with one. To clarify this situation, all available type and non-type materials were studied. Ilyphagus is redefined to include species with digitiform bodies, abundant filiform papillae and a thin body wall; their neurochaetae are thick, anchylosed aristate spines, and all species have a cephalic cage (in the type species the presence of a cage is inferred from the remaining chaetal scars). Ilyphagus pluto, which also lacks a a cephalic cage is determined here to be a holothurian). The redefined genus contains I. bythincola (incl.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} inter-specific {{differences in}} the distribution of sediment in the gut compartments and in the enzyme and bacterial profiles along the gut of <b>abyssal</b> holothurian <b>species</b> - Oneirophanta mutabilis, Psychropotes longicauda and Pseudostichopus villosus sampled from a eutrophic site in the NE Atlantic at different times of the year. Proportions of sediments, relative to total gut contents, in the pharynx, oesophagus, anterior and posterior intestine differed significantly in all the inter-species comparisons, but not between inter-seasonal comparisons. Significant differences were also found between the relative proportions of sediments in both the rectum and cloaca of Psychropotes longicauda and Oneirophanta mutabilis. Nineteen enzymes were identified in either gut-tissue or gut-content samples of the holothurians studied. Concentrations of the enzymes in gut tissues and their contents were highly correlated. Greater concentrations of the enzymes were found in the gut tissues suggesting that they are the main source of the enzymes. The suites of enzymes recorded were broadly similar in each of the species sampled collected regardless of the time of the year, and they were similar to those described previously for shallow-water holothurians. Significant inter-specific {{differences in the}} gut tissue concentrations of some of the glycosidases suggest dietary differences. For example, Psychropotes longicauda and Pseudostichopus villosus contain higher levels of chitobiase than Oneirophanta mutabilis. There were no seasonal changes in bacterial activity profiles along the guts of O. mutabilis and Pseudostichopus villosus. In both these species bacterial activity and abundance declined between the pharynx/oesophagus and anterior intestine, but then increased along the gut and became greatest in the rectum/cloaca. Although the data sets were more limited for Psychropotes longicauda, bacterial activity increased from the anterior to the posterior intestine but then declined slightly to the rectum/cloaca. These changes in bacterial activity and densities probably reflect changes in the microbial environment along the guts of abyssal holothurians. Such changes suggest that there is potential for microbial breakdown of a broader range of substrates than could be otherwise be achieved by the holothurian itself. However, the present study found no evidence for sedimentary (microbial) sources of hydrolytic enzymes...|$|R
40|$|Peracarid {{crustaceans}} form {{a significant}} part of the macrobenthic community that is responsible for scavenging on large food falls onto the sea floor. Although several studies are available about scavengers from tropical and temperate seas, very little information has been published about such species living in Antarctic waters, particularly at greater depths. The present paper is based on a collection of 31 baited trap sets deployed in the Weddell Sea, Scotia Sea, and off the South Shetland Islands, and presents results on the geographical and bathymetric distribution of the different taxa and on the eco-functional role of scavengers. Some 68, 000 peracarid crustaceans from 62 species were collected. About 98 % of individuals belonged to the amphipod superfamily Lysianassoidea, and 2 % to the isopod family Cirolanidae. Of these species, 31, including 26 lysianassoids (1400 individuals), were collected deeper than 1000  m. High species richness was discerned for the eastern Weddell Sea shelf compared with other Antarctic areas. The Antarctic slope also seems to be richer in species than other areas investigated in the world, while in the abyss, scavenger species richness appears to be lower in Antarctica. A richness gradient was thus observed from the shelf to the deep. For amphipods, a number of species extend their distribution from the shelf to the slope and only one to the <b>abyssal</b> zone. Amphipod <b>species</b> showed degrees of adaptation to necrophagy. The functional adaptations of the mandible and the storage function of the gut are discussed.

40|$|The {{taxonomy}} and biostratigraphy of deep-water agglutinated foraminifera (DWAF) {{are documented}} in a 299 m thick section {{collected from the}} Upper Cretaceous (Turonian to Maastrichtian) of the Scaglia Bianca and Scaglia Rossa Formations in the Contessa Highway section of Italy. A total of 94 species belonging to 48 genera are documented from the section, including two new species: Subreophax longicameratus n. sp., and Hormosinella fusiformis n. sp [...] The DWAF assemblages display a general trend of increasing abundance and diversity from the Cenomanian/Turonian boundary to the Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary. The biostratigraphy of DWAF in the Upper Cretaceous part of the Contessa Highway section is calibrated to the 2008 ICS timescale {{by means of the}} calcareous nannofossil biostratigraphy. Nine calcareous nannofossil biozones are determined in the interval CC 10 to CC 26, but some of the Upper Cretaceous nannofossil biozones could not be determined owing to poor preservation or the absence of index taxa. The first occurrences of biostratigraphically important DWAF species are compared with the first occurrences in the Upper Cretaceous of the Carpathians and the North Atlantic. The agglutinated foraminiferal biozones of the Carpathian schemes of Geroch & Nowak (1984) and Neagu et al. (1992) and the North Atlantic zonation of Kuhnt et al. (1992) cannot be applied in their entirety to the Contessa Highway section owing to the scarcity of some index taxa. Four Upper Cretaceous DWAF biozones described from the Atlantic and Western Tethys are recognised in the Scaglia formations at Contessa: the lower Turonian Bulbobaculites problematicus Zone, the upper Turonian to Coniacian Uvigerinammina jankoi Zone, the Santonian to Campanian Caudammina gigantea Zone, and the Maastrichtian Remesella varians Zone. However, some of the cosmopolitan index taxa, such as Bulbobaculites problematicus and Uvigerinammina jankoi have truncated stratigraphic ranges. The oligotrophic palaeoenvironmental conditions represented by the red deep-water Scaglia Rossa limestones cause flysch-type species such as Uvigerinammina jankoi and Caudammina gigantea to be rare, {{and in the case of}} Rectoprotomarssonella rugosa, an index species for the Lower Campanian, to be absent. Nevertheless, the Uvigerinammina jankoi Zone in Contessa can be correlated with the Carpathian Basins and the North Atlantic. Agglutinated foraminiferal assemblages are similar in taxonomic composition to those of the Carpathian Basins but in addition, a series of small <b>abyssal</b> type Haplophragmoides <b>species</b> known from the North Atlantic DSDP/ODP sites are present in the Contessa Highway section, probably as a result of oligotrophic conditions in the central Tethys. The abundance of agglutinated foraminifera at Contessa displays mimima during sea level high stands in the late Turonian, late Coniacian, late Santonian, early Campanian. These low abundance assemblages likely indicate enhanced oligotrophy as result of sediment starvation. The foraminiferal abundance and diversity values generally increase upsection, and typical "flysch-type" species appear in the record, indicating more detrital influx and a change to more mesotrophic conditions in the Campanian...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} study the ecology of meiobenthos with special {{reference}} to foraminifera at the bathyal and abyssal zone of the Eastern Mediterranean Sea, sediment samples were collected {{from a wide range}} of sampling stations, from 582 m to 4617 m depth. Sampling stations were indicative of the abiotic parameters and the specific characteristics of the study area (variety in depths, oligotrophic environment, extreme environmental conditions). At the bathyal zone, the analysed samples were collected at the Sporades Basin (1221 - 1250 m) and the Cretan Sea (1840 m), as well as at the West and the East Ionian Sea (582 - 1735 m depth). At the abyssal zone, sampling stations were established along a transect from the Central to the Eastern Basin (2714 - 4000 m) as well as at the Peloponnese (4617 m) and Ierapetra Basin (4157 - 4261 m). In addition, abyssal ssamples were also collected from both the anoxic zone and the area outside the influence of the brines at the Deep Hypersaline Anoxic Basins Discovery, L’ Atralante, Urania and Bannock (3080 - 3522 m). Three more stations were studied at the eastern basin indicative of the sapropel S 1 layer, proto-sapropel and post sapropel layers included. Samples were collected using a multicorer or a box corer and were further subsampled for physicochemical and sedimentological analyses as well as for biological analysis (of both metazoa and foraminifera). Foraminifera were identified into species or genus level. Benthic foramininifera were the second most abundant group after nematodes, followed by harpacticoid copepods and copepods nauplii. The contribution of foraminifera to the total meiobenthos was more important at the abyssal zone (up to 54 % of the total meiobenthos). The foraminiferal abundance as well as the abundance of major metazoan groups were significantly decreased at the <b>abyssal</b> zone. The <b>species</b> number and diversity of the foraminiferal community were also decreased at the abyssal stations. The quantity and quality of the food available in the sediments was found to be the most important factor controlling the structure of the community at the bathyal zone, at all the stations at the abyssal zone, and outside the influence of the brines of the anoxic basins. In the South Aegean Sea (Cretan Sea), low levels of abundance were recorded (compared to the northern stations) thus indicating the oligotrophic nature of the south, while the North Aegean is strongly influenced by the rich in nutrients waters coming from the Black Sea. In the East Ionian Sea and at 600 m depth in the West Ionian Sea, low abundances of meiobenthic groups are also indicative of the oligotrophy that characterises the Ionian Sea. The Peloponnese Basin, characterised by surprisingly high abundances compared to the other abyssal stations and coupled with high concentrations of chloroplastic pigments, verifies the role of such deep basins as natural traps for organic matter accumulated from the euphotic zone. Moreover, the high concentration of organic matter together with the increased numbers of planktonic individuals found in the anoxic zone of the Deep Hypersaline Anoxic Basins, further verifies the contention that some of these basins behave as natural sediment traps by accumulating sedimenting organic matter and decaying planktonic organisms. The results of the present study also indicate that all four Deep Hypersaline Anoxic Basins support, to a different extent, meiobenthic organisms such as bivalves, gastropods, foraminifera, nematodes. However, it is not so far known the specific adaptations they need in order to be able to survive at this kind of extreme environments, are not yet known. From the analysis of the dead assemblages of benthic foraminifera (benthic foraminiferal number and the diversity) preserved before, during and after the deposition of the sapropel S 1, it is evident that foraminiferal community showed a clear response before, during and after the anoxia event during the Holocene. The typical of the deep-sea foraminiferal community is changed to a community represented by species tolerant to low concentrations of oxygen, followed by the typical normal community characterising the deep sea of the Eastern Meditrranean Sea, after the anoxic event. ...|$|R

Two species, G. megaptera Verrill and G. plena Verrill, have been described from the north-west Atlantic, but the types are either lost (G. megaptera) or in poor condition (G. plena), hindering comparisons. Material examined from the north-west Atlantic included G. wuelkeri, G. challengeri and at least two other species...|$|E
