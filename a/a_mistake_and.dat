5|$|Chesbro {{was elected}} to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1946 by the Veterans Committee, though he had {{received}} little consideration from the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA). Some baseball historians consider the 1946 election <b>a</b> <b>mistake,</b> <b>and</b> believe that Chesbro was elected {{solely on the basis of}} his 1904 season.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{retirement}} in Australia, the next 5 rounds saw {{a string of}} point-scoring positions, including a 4th at Monaco in the wet, {{one of the few}} finishers not to have made <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> <b>and</b> subsequent pit-in, however his performance was overshadowed by Hamilton's win. Until 2009, this was Webber's best start to an F1 season since 2005 with Williams, managing five consecutive points scoring races.|$|E
5|$|Although {{reviews in}} the birding and ornithological press {{have often been}} favourable, there have been criticisms. Peter Kennerley, author and Asian bird expert, {{considered}} {{that some of the}} illustrations are small and garish or technically inaccurate. He also believes that the over-reliance on sometimes very old museum specimens and dismissal of the wealth of observational data filed by amateur travelling birders is <b>a</b> <b>mistake,</b> <b>and</b> states that many of the taxonomic decisions appear to be random choices, unsupported by published research.|$|E

5|$|Cisneros and Martínez {{were arrested}} and charged with capital murder, which in Texas is {{punishable}} with a life sentence or death by lethal injection. Cisneros was taken to the Cameron County jail. On her way there, reporters asked if she was responsible for Fischer's murder, and she shook her head. Cisneros' husband also refused to comment. The police denied her bail, but her attorney said that she was a respected member of the Brownsville community and deserved bail. Cisneros's attorney told the press that the arrest was <b>a</b> <b>mistake,</b> <b>and</b> that he was confident the police had no solid evidence against her. Police responded by saying they were content with her arrest, but still needed to go after other people involved in the murder plot. Martínez' family also said they were shocked by the arrest, saying they hoped it was <b>a</b> <b>mistake,</b> <b>and</b> {{that they did not know}} the Fischers or Cisneros. On April 13, Cisneros was released from prison on a $300,000 bond, refusing to comment as she left. According to court documents, Cisneros did not go before a judge to obtain a bond. Her attorney reached an agreement with the Cameron County Court District after her bond was denied the week before. Martínez remained in prison, and her bond was set at the same amount the next day. Her lawyer stated that she deserved a bond as well because she was a senior citizen and had a clean criminal record.|$|E
5|$|Co-writer Glen Morgan felt {{doing an}} episode on vampires was <b>a</b> <b>mistake,</b> <b>and</b> {{said that they}} were also criticized for having Mulder fall for Kristen. Co-writer James Wong was also disappointed, saying that the script was a lot better than the show and that the episode was {{weakened}} when Fox censors had problems with the episode. Actor David Duchovny thought the episode had style, but suffered some lapses in logic, including the scene where Kristen shaves Mulder before the two kiss.|$|E

5|$|Sheila's {{mental health}} {{continued}} to decline, with episodes of banging {{her head against}} walls. In 1983, her family doctor referred her to Dr. Hugh Ferguson, the psychiatrist who had treated June. Ferguson said she was in an agitated state, paranoid and psychotic. She was admitted to St Andrew's Hospital, a private psychiatric facility in Northampton, where {{she was diagnosed with}} schizoaffective disorder, although Ferguson said this diagnosis was <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> <b>and</b> that she was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia.|$|E
5|$|Sue's {{initiative}} proves {{popular with}} the students' parents, and her appointment as principal is made permanent. She fires Will, who is later visited by Holly seeking advice. Holly feels out of her depth as a teacher, having enabled Mercedes' behavior. She confesses that she originally took her work seriously, until a student (Lindsay Sims-Lewis) punched her in the face, prompting her more laid-back approach. Terri arrives while they are talking and is angered by Holly's presence. Will asks her to leave, telling her that their reunion was <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> <b>and</b> concluding their relationship for good.|$|E
5|$|According to Meintjes, Kruger {{was still}} not {{particularly}} anti-British; he thought the British had made <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> <b>and</b> would rectify the situation if this could be proven to them. After conducting a poll through the former republican infrastructure—587 signed in favour of the annexation, 6,591 against—he organised a second deputation to London, made up of himself and Joubert with Bok again serving as secretary. The envoys met the British High Commissioner in Cape Town, Sir Bartle Frere, and arrived in London on 29 June 1878 to find a censorious letter from Shepstone waiting for them, along with a communication that since Kruger was agitating against the government he had been dismissed from the executive council.|$|E

5|$|As the frontrunners {{set their}} first timed laps in Q3, Hamilton made <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> <b>and</b> ran wide {{at the last}} corner, leaving him behind Rosberg and both Ferrari drivers. Hülkenberg, both Williams drivers and Ricciardo were {{eliminated}} without setting another time, while the four fastest cars came out again. Hamilton set the fastest ever lap at the Bahrain Circuit, at 1:29.493, to achieve pole position ahead of Rosberg, who was just 0.077 seconds slower. Half a second behind, Vettel grabbed third place on the grid ahead of teammate Räikkönen. After qualifying, Hamilton's pole was put under threat after the FIA started an investigation after Hamilton reversed in the pit lane to park up. Hamilton was given a reprimand and his pole position stood.|$|E
5|$|At the department, with April {{absent from}} work, Ron asks Andy {{to fill in}} as an {{assistant}} because the anti-government oriented Ron believes Andy will be ineffective. The two bond {{over the course of}} the day, and Andy begins to tell Ron about his problems with April, for whom he still harbors romantic feelings. Although initially not wishing to get involved, Ron reluctantly tells Andy she is at the hospital and he should visit her. Meanwhile, Ann remains pleasant throughout her nursing shift despite April's constant abuse. The second her shift ends, however, Ann immediately loses her temper and curses at April. Ann apologizes for kissing Andy, but insists it was <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> <b>and</b> that April should stop taking it out on Andy. Later, Andy visits April, who pretends to be asleep but smiles, revealing she is happy he came.|$|E
5|$|Banks was {{determined}} to break the siege by a direct assault on the Confederate lines.

While in the hospital, he lobbied for a transfer to a theater where his chances of promotion would be greater. On June 30, having healed enough to mount a horse again, Dow visited his troops. As he returned to the hospital after dark, he was captured by Confederate cavalry operating behind Union lines.|$|E

While Menzel's musical performances on the show have been lauded, Shelby's storylines were characterized as rushed, incomprehensible and polarizing by contemporary reviewers.|$|E
5|$|The first {{aircraft}} at Fornebu was a Lufthansa Junkers Ju 52 in September 1938. It {{had flown}} a scheduled route to Kjeller, {{and the captain}} had continued to Fornebu to try the new airport. On 16 April 1939, the seaplane section came into regular use. The first seaplane was a Ju 52 operated by DNL to Copenhagen. The official opening was on 1 June 1939. The first aircraft to land after the official opening was a Douglas DC-2 operated by KLM from Amsterdam. The first departure was on the Danish airline Det Danske Luftfartsselskab, when a Focke-Wulf Fw 200 took off to Copenhagen. The captain made <b>a</b> <b>mistake,</b> <b>and</b> took off from the parking space instead of the runway. In addition to these two routes, Luft Hansa started flights to Germany and DNL flew to Amsterdam. During the fall, DNL also flew from Perth, Scotland, via Oslo to Stockholm, but this route was soon canceled.|$|E

5|$|Written by Mike Tucker & Robert Perry, {{this was}} a three-part Cybermen story set in war-torn London of the 1940s. They had {{completed}} the first two episodes in script form and the final episode as a storyline, and were planning to submit it during the start of production on season 26. Fellow writer Ben Aaronovitch intercepted the script, suggesting that submitting to script editor Andrew Cartmel a World War II script when he was currently already editing something similar (The Curse of Fenric) was <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> <b>and</b> to instead submit it for the following series. Tucker & Perry later adapted the story as a novel for the BBC Past Doctors range in October 1997.|$|E
