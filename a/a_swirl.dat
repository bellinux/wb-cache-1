5|$|A {{tropical}} wave formed Tropical Depression Nine-E on August 26. It was {{upgraded to}} {{a tropical storm}} and named Genevieve the next day. It moved westward and nearly strengthened to a hurricane, peaking in intensity on August 28. At that point, the cyclone encountered cooler waters, which caused it to weaken slowly, weakening to a depression on August 30. The depression hung on until it lost convection on the September 2. <b>A</b> <b>swirl</b> of remnant clouds persisted {{for a few more}} days. Genevieve had no impact on land, with no reports of casualties or damage being received by the National Hurricane Center.|$|E
5|$|An area of {{disturbed}} weather near Panama {{drifted to}} a location south of Puerto Ángel, Oaxaca, and organized into Tropical Depression Four-E on July 9. It moved westward through {{a hostile environment}} of strong shear. The wind shear disrupted the cyclone's convection and weakened its circulation. Despite the shear, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm early on July 12 and was named Cristina. This broke down the steering ridge, and Cristina turned {{to the north and}} peaked on July 14. Then, the wind shear won out and Cristina quickly weakened. Cristina dissipated into <b>a</b> <b>swirl</b> of clouds on July 16, without ever threatening land. No impact was reported.|$|E
5|$|Hernan {{continued}} to intensify {{and became the}} first major hurricanea storm with winds of 111mph (178km/h) or higherof the season on August 9. After reaching major hurricane status, Hernan steadily weakened to a minimal hurricane. The weakening continued, and Hernan was further downgraded to a tropical storm on August 11. As Hernan moved over cold waters, the convection associated with the storm dissipated, leaving only <b>a</b> <b>swirl</b> of clouds. By the morning of August 12, almost all of the convection associated with Hernan had dissipated and the system was declared a remnant low-pressure area. The remnants of the hurricane caused light rain to Hawaii.|$|E

5|$|Early on August 11, Hernan was {{downgraded}} to {{a tropical}} storm. Deep convection diminished around {{the center of}} the storm and by August 12, almost all of the deep convection dissipated as Hernan continued to weaken. Over 23°C water, only <b>a</b> <b>swirl</b> of clouds remained and the storm was barely a tropical system. Later that night, Hernan had degenerated into a remnant low, and the final advisory was issued by the National Hurricane Center. The remnant low still retained tropical storm-force winds for a short while before weakening further by the next morning. The low moved towards the west-southwest over the next several days before dissipating 460mi (740km) southeast of the Island of Hawaii on August 16. The remnant low-pressure area of Hernan later brought moisture to the island of Hawaii, causing cloud and shower activity. The associated rainfall was light and insignificant.|$|E
5|$|On June 22, showers {{increased}} {{associated with}} a tropical wave several hundred miles away from land. Three days later, deep convection became more concentrated, and the system became a tropical depression. It intensified into Tropical Storm Carlos as banding features increased and the outflow became better defined. As it moved west, convection diminished as Carlos moved into cooler water. Shortly thereafter, increased wind shear took its toll on Carlos as the low-level center became exposed from the deep convection. Carlos weakened into a depression early on June 27, and dissipated June 28. However, <b>a</b> <b>swirl</b> of clouds remained {{for a couple of}} days. Except for Socorro Island, which the system passed close to, Carlos never threatened land. No indications of casualties or damage were reported.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after peaking in intensity, Darby {{moved over}} coolers waters {{and began to}} deteriorate. The eye became less {{well-defined}} and the associated convection started weakening. Increasingly colder waters and growing wind shear continued to affect Darby, and the cyclone weakened to a tropical storm on July 30. The low-level center of circulation became exposed from the thunderstorm activity, and the storm quickly degenerated into <b>a</b> <b>swirl</b> of clouds, although it maintained tropical storm strength. On July 31, it weakened to a tropical depression. Darby soon crossed into the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's area of responsibility, and it dissipated as a tropical cyclone on August 1. However, its remnants continued westward under the low-level trade winds, and dropped heavy rainfall on Hawaii several days after the cyclone dissipated.|$|E

5|$|The {{depression}} began {{a movement}} to the northwest upon formation and {{on the night of}} October 31, the depression ran into a newly-forming upper-level low near the Yucatan Peninsula. The interaction with the upper-level low caused shearing in the depression, and broke apart the previous low-level circulation that was developing. By the morning of November 1, the depression was nothing more than <b>a</b> <b>swirl</b> of low-level clouds near the center of circulation. After this, the depression could no longer attain the circulation it had previously developed. During the period of November 2 and 3, the depression moved to the northeast, crossing over the islands of Jamaica, Cayman and Cuba and then entering the southern parts of the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{continuing}} {{effects from}} the strong wind shear, a large, deep burst of convection formed in the northern semicircle of Josephine. The center {{was found to have}} shifted towards the new convection leading to an increase in intensity. The forecast showed a slight decrease in wind shear as Josephine continued westward and no change in intensity over the 5-day forecast was predicted. However, the convection decreased once more and the low became completely exposed by the late morning hours and Josephine weakened again. By the afternoon, the center of Josephine was only <b>a</b> <b>swirl</b> of clouds, devoid of convection. During the overnight hours on September 4 into the morning of September 5, convection associated with Josephine began to redevelop somewhat, mostly {{to the north of the}} circulation, due to the strong southerly wind shear. By mid-morning, Josephine re-intensified slightly due to the redevelopment of some convection. However, the redevelopment was short lived and wind shear again took its toll on Josephine by late morning. The convection around the system became dislocated from the center and Josephine weakened slightly.|$|E

25|$|The second {{generation}} air system targeted high reduction. In 1954 CE moved their secondary air from about 1 m below the liquor guns to about 2 m above them.

In tangential air system the air nozzles {{are in the}} furnace corners. The preferred method is to create <b>a</b> <b>swirl</b> of almost the total furnace width. In large units the swirl caused left and right imbalances. This kind of air system with increased dry solids managed to increase lower furnace temperatures and achieve reasonable reduction.

25|$|Wood-burners emit large {{quantities}} of flying sparks which necessitate an efficient spark-arresting device generally housed in the smokestack.

A more-efficient design was the Radley and Hunter centrifugal stack patented in 1850 (commonly known as the diamond stack), incorporating baffles so oriented as to induce <b>a</b> <b>swirl</b> effect in the chamber that encouraged the embers to burn out and fall to the bottom as ash. In the self-cleaning smokebox the opposite effect was achieved: by allowing the flue gasses to strike a series of deflector plates, angled {{in such a way that}} the blast was not impaired, the larger particles were broken into small pieces that would be ejected with the blast, rather than settle in the bottom of the smokebox to be removed by hand at the end of the run.
