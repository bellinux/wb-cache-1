5|$|Habitat {{destruction}} represents <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> biodiversity in Croatia, as {{developed and}} agricultural land is expanded into previous natural habitats, while habitat fragmentation occurs as roads are created or expanded. A further threat to biodiversity {{is the introduction}} of invasive species, with Caulerpa racemosa and C. taxifolia identified as especially problematic ones. The invasive algae are monitored and regularly removed to protect the benthic habitat. Agricultural monocultures have also been identified as <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> biodiversity.|$|E

Though the fire was not contained {{for a couple of}} months, by mid-August it was no longer considered <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> lives and property.|$|E

5|$|A {{dust devil}} is a strong, well-formed, and {{relatively}} long-lived whirlwind, ranging from small (half a metre wide {{and a few}} metres tall) to large (more than 10 metres wide and more than 1000 metres tall). The primary vertical motion is upward. Dust devils are usually harmless, but can on rare occasions grow large enough to pose <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> both people and property.|$|E
5|$|According to medieval scholar Richard Zeikowitz, the Green Knight {{represents}} <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> homosocial friendship in his medieval world. Zeikowitz {{argues that}} the narrator of the poem seems entranced by the Knight's beauty, homoeroticising him in poetic form. The Green Knight's attractiveness challenges the homosocial rules of King Arthur's court and poses <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> their way of life. Zeikowitz also states that Gawain seems to find Bertilak as attractive as the narrator finds the Green Knight. Bertilak, however, follows the homosocial code and develops a friendship with Gawain. Gawain's embracing and kissing Bertilak in several scenes thus represents not a homosexual but a homosocial expression. Men of the time often embraced and kissed and this was acceptable under the chivalric code. Nonetheless, the Green Knight blurs the lines between homosociality and homosexuality, representing the difficulty medieval writers sometimes had in separating the two.|$|E

In contrast to the Mirdasids, the Tayy consistently plundered their territory and its inhabitants. Moreover, the Fatimids would not tolerate independent rule in Palestine, which they viewed as <b>a</b> <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> the Caliphate's survival.|$|E

Fifty-two participants wrote a narrative describing {{a situation where}} they received <b>a</b> major <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> their self-esteem and {{a situation where they}} received <b>a</b> minor <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> their self-esteem.

Ego-shock was reported following major self-esteem <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> greater degree than following minor self-esteem threats. Additional analyses revealed that ego-shock is an immediate and automatic process. The long-term effects of major self-esteem <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> the individual are discussed...|$|R
