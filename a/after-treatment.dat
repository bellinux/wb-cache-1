5000|$|In {{addition}} to the viscosity index improvers, motor oil manufacturers often include other additives such as detergents and dispersants {{to help keep the}} engine clean by minimizing sludge buildup, corrosion inhibitors, and alkaline additives to neutralize acidic oxidation products of the oil. Most commercial oils have a minimal amount of zinc dialkyldithiophosphate as an anti-wear additive to protect contacting metal surfaces with zinc and other compounds in case of metal to metal contact. The quantity of zinc dialkyldithiophosphate is limited to minimize adverse effect on catalytic converters.

50|$|By the 1974 model year, the {{emission}} standards had tightened {{such that the}} de-tuning techniques used to meet them were seriously reducing engine efficiency and thus increasing fuel usage. The new emission standards for 1975 model year, {{as well as the}} increase in fuel usage, forced the invention of the catalytic converter for <b>after-treatment</b> of the exhaust gas. This was not possible with existing leaded gasoline, because the lead residue contaminated the platinum catalyst. In 1972, General Motors proposed to the American Petroleum Institute the elimination of leaded fuels for 1975 and later model year cars. The production and distribution of unleaded fuel was a major challenge, but it was completed successfully in time for the 1975 model year cars. All modern cars are now equipped with catalytic converters and leaded fuel is nearly impossible to buy in most First World countries.|$|E

40|$|Certain exhaust <b>after-treatment</b> devices used {{in modern}} diesel engines need an {{injector}} to spray a liquid, including a fuel, into the exhaust stream.

40|$|Lean burn <b>after-treatment</b> {{systems are}} the current focus for {{reducing}} emissions from diesel exhaust. The trend is for commercial CFD packages {{to use a}} single channel modelling approach. Due to computational demands, this necessitates specification of representative channels for modelling, implying prior knowledge of the flow field. This paper investigates a methodology for applying the porous medium approach to lean burn <b>after-treatment</b> systems. This approach has proved successful for three-way catalysis modelling and has the advantage that the flow field is predicted. Chemical kinetic rates for NOx trapping and regeneration in the model are based on information available in the open literature. Similarly, filtration information based on mass accumulation and soot combustion kinetics are also readily available. Modification of the source terms in a commercial CFD package enables prediction of trapping and release of NOx. This is {{an effective way to}} model a NOx trap <b>after-treatment</b> system and provides simultaneous 3 D modelling of the flow field. With diesel, particulate filtration is required. In the case of particulate traps, however, because of channel geometry, some assumptions are necessary for use of the porous medium approach and these are discussed in this paper. Both models produce qualitatively correct output and have parameters that can be tuned to conform to experimental data. Data to validate the NOx trap model is to be measured. The particulate trap model, on the other hand, is a feasibility study for modelling the complete diesel <b>after-treatment</b> system using the porous medium approach. Keywords...|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} decades the {{continuously}} tightening limitations on pollutant emissions {{has led to an}} extensive adoption of <b>after-treatment</b> devices on the exhaust systems of modern internal combustion engines. While these devices are primarily introduced for reducing and controlling the emissions, they also play an important role influencing the wave motion inside the exhaust system and so affecting the acoustics and the performances of the engine. In this paper a novel approach is proposed for the modeling of two <b>after-treatment</b> devices: the catalyst and the Diesel Particulate Filter. The models are based on a fast quasi- 3 D approach, named 3 Dcell, originally developed by the authors for the acoustic modeling of silencers. This approach allows to model the wave motion by solving the momentum equation along the three directions. The capability of modeling complex shape devices, allowing the description of three-dimensional wave action, makes this tool an interesting solution for studying the acoustic behavior of today’s mostly used <b>after-treatment</b> devices. In this work the 3 Dcell approach has been extended to the modeling of the catalyst and DPF monolith, in order to combine the capability of predicting the flow distribution in the monolith channels with a lower computational demand than traditional 3 D CFD approaches. The developed models have been applied to the simulation of the acoustic behavior of these components, comparing the results to measured data. For completeness sake the results have also been compared to traditional 1 D models applied to the acoustic simulation of <b>after-treatment</b> devices...|$|E

Recently, new on-board diagnostic system requirements (OBD II) have been enforced on California vehicles and new legislation will become stricter and stricter, moreover such requirements have also been extended in Europe (EOBD).

To meet these requirement, sophisticated diagnostic algorithms have to be developed.

30|$|The European diesel versus Japanese hybrid {{technology}} debate produced strange effects.

European Union emission legislation however remained more lenient and did not require or simply postponed the need for <b>after-treatment</b> equipment.
