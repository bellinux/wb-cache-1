40|$|Laser radar (Lidar) {{has been}} used {{extensively}} for remote sensing of wind patterns, turbulence in the atmospheric boundary layer and other important atmospheric transport phenomenon. As in most narrowband radar application, radial velocity of remote objects is encoded in the Doppler shift of the backscattered signal relative to the transmitted signal. In contrast to many applications, however, the backscattered signal in <b>atmospheric</b> <b>Lidar</b> sensing arises from a multitude of moving particles in a spatial cell under examination rather than from a few prominent “target” scattering features. This complicates the process of extracting a single Doppler value and corresponding radial velocity figure to associate with the cell.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} progress Fibertek {{is making}} toward development of next-generation remote sensing lidar technology for cube, micro, and small satellite (smallsat) platforms. Our general {{finding is that}} small, relatively inexpensive cube/micro/small satellite lidars are feasible and that numerous applications are possible. Lidar is not traditionally thought of as being suitable for cube and smallsat applications because of the cost, complexity, mass, and power typically associated with ground- and space-based earth and planetary lidars. This paper describes our performance modeling and concept lidar designs that are 2 - 4 U in size, 2 - 3 kg, draw 10 - 25 W, and are capable of science and satellite proximity operations. This paper will discuss lidar concepts for multiple applications. Short-range proximity lidars are capable of 50 -degree field of view (FOV), scanning angle up to 500 m and can support three-dimensional (3 D) imaging for satellite rendezvous operations and comet/asteroid sample capture missions.
