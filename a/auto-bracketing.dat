50|$|Metering is via a silicon {{photocell}} (SPC) giving 6-zone evaluative metering, center-weighted metering, and 6.5% partial metering. The metering range, at ISO 100 with a 1.4 lens, is EV 1-20. Exposure {{compensation of}} ±2 EV {{can be applied}} in half-stop increments; the same range and increments apply to 3-shot <b>auto-bracketing.</b> The film speed range supported is ISO 25 to 8000, using DX coding if available.|$|E
5000|$|Remote Control R8/R9: an {{electronic}} unit that attaches {{to either the}} Motor Winder or the Motor Drive; it cannot {{be connected to the}} bare camera. In addition to triggering the shutter, the Remote Control can turn the camera on or off, control mode and exposure, control <b>auto-bracketing,</b> and can function as an intervalometer triggering at rates between one per second and one every 24 hours. It comes with a 5-metre cord and can be fitted with up to 4 25 metre extension cords for a maximum length of 105 metres.|$|E
