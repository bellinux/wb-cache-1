50|$|<b>Anthroposophic</b> <b>medicine</b> (or anthroposophical medicine) {{is a form}} of {{alternative}} medicine. Devised in the 1920s by Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925) in conjunction with Ita Wegman (1876-1943), anthroposophical medicine is based on occult notions and draws on Steiner's spiritual philosophy, which he called anthroposophy. Practitioners employ a variety of treatment techniques based upon anthroposophic precepts, including massage, exercise, counselling, and substances.|$|E
50|$|There {{are about}} 1,700 {{different}} anthroposophic medicinal {{products on the}} market in the European Union.

5000|$|Steiner {{described}} the heart {{not as a}} pump, but as a regulator of flow, such that the heartbeat itself can be distinguished from the circulation of blood. <b>Anthroposophic</b> <b>medicine</b> claims the flow {{in the blood of}} the circulatory system is, as Marinelli put it, [...] "propelled with its own biological momentum, {{as can be seen in}} the embryo, and boosts itself with induced momenta from the heart".|$|E
50|$|The {{manufacture}} {{and use of}} anthroposophic medicines dates back to Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925), who together with Dr Ita Wegman (1876-1943) invented <b>anthroposophic</b> <b>medicine</b> {{at the beginning of}} the 20th century. Steiner and Wegman's ideas were extended by the chemist Dr Oskar Schmiedel (1887-1959), who manufactured anthroposophic medicines from 1920 onwards and introduced the newly conceived formulations and manufacturing processes into pharmaceutical practice. A second important pioneer of anthroposophic pharmacy was Dr Rudolf Hauschka (1891-1969).|$|E
50|$|Many drug {{preparations}} used in <b>anthroposophic</b> <b>medicine</b> are ultra-diluted substances, {{similar to}} those used in homeopathy. Homeopathic remedies are not medically effective and are generally considered harmless, except when used as a substitute for a scientifically proven and effective cure. In certain European countries, people with cancer are sometimes prescribed remedies made from specially harvested mistletoe, but research has found no convincing evidence of clinical benefit. Some anthroposophic doctors oppose childhood vaccination, and this has led to preventable outbreaks of disease.|$|E

40|$|Introduction. The {{aim of the}} {{presented}} observational {{case series}} was to evaluate the experience in treating patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) within integrative medicine, particularly <b>anthroposophic</b> <b>medicine</b> in a well-experienced and specialized unit. Patients and Methods. Patients with proven CAP were evaluated (CAP-study group) based on a retrospective chart review. To estimate the severity of pneumonia, the pneumonia severity index (PSI) was applied. Treatment efficacy was evaluated regarding body temperature, CRP level, leukocytes blood count, {{the need to be}} treated on ICU, and mortality. Results were compared with the inpatient data of the Pneumonia PORT Validation Cohort. Results. 15 / 18 patients of the CAP-study group belonged to risk class groups I–III (low and moderate risk), 2 patients to risk class IV, and one patient to risk class V (severe pneumonia). 16 / 18 patients were treated with <b>anthroposophic</b> <b>medicine</b> only and 2 / 18 got additionally antibiotic therapy (both of risk class IV). A significant reduction of body temperature, CRP level, and leukocytes blood count has been obtained by applying <b>anthroposophic</b> <b>medicine,</b> while neither complications nor pneumonia-related death occurred. Compared with the control group {{there was no significant difference}} in mortality rate, whereby no patient had to be treated on the ICU, but the duration of hospital stay was significantly longer in the presented series. Conclusion. Inpatient treatment of CAP with <b>anthroposophic</b> <b>medicine</b> without the use of antibiotics may achieve reasonable results in selected cases. Additional larger sized prospective controlled trials should further clarify the role of AM in the treatment of CAP...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Pharmacotherapy in {{the older}} adult is a complex field {{involving}} several different medical professionals. The evidence base for pharmacotherapy in elderly patients in primary care relies on only a few clinical trials, thus documentation must be improved, particularly {{in the field of}} complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) like phytotherapy, homoeopathy, and <b>anthroposophic</b> <b>medicine.</b> This study describes diagnoses and therapies observed in elderly patients treated with <b>anthroposophic</b> <b>medicine</b> in usual care. Methods Twenty-nine primary care physicians in Germany participated in this prospective, multicenter observational study on prescribing patterns. Prescriptions and diagnoses were reported for each consecutive patient. Data were included if patients were at least 60 years of age. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to determine factors associated with anthroposophic prescriptions. Results In 2005, a total of 12 314 prescriptions for 3076 patients (68. 1 % female) were included. The most frequent diagnoses were hypertension (11. 1 %), breast cancer (3. 5 %), and heart failure (3. 0 %). In total, 30. 5 % of the prescriptions were classified as CAM remedies alone, 54. 4 % as conventional pharmaceuticals alone, and 15. 1 % as a combination of both. CAM remedies accounted for 41. 7 % of all medications prescribed (35. 5 % anthroposophic). The adjusted odds ratio (AOR) for receiving an anthroposophic remedy was significantly higher for the first consultation (AOR = 1. 65; CI: 1. 52 - 1. 79), treatment by an internist (AOR = 1. 49; CI: 1. 40 - 1. 58), female patients (AOR = 1. 35; CI: 1. 27 - 1. 43), cancer (AOR = 4. 54; CI: 4. 12 - 4. 99), arthropathies (AOR = 1. 36; CI: 1. 19 - 1. 55), or dorsopathies (AOR = 1. 34; CI: 1. 16 - 1. 55) and it decreased with patient age (AOR = 0. 97; CI: 0. 97 - 0. 98). The likelihood of being prescribed an anthroposophic remedy was especially low for patients with hypertensive diseases (AOR = 0. 36; CI: 0. 32 - 0. 39), diabetes mellitus (AOR = 0. 17; CI: 0. 14 - 0. 22), or metabolic disorders (AOR = 0. 17; CI: 0. 13 - 0. 22). Conclusion The present study is the first to provide a systematic overview of everyday anthroposophic medical practice in primary care for elderly patients. Practitioners of <b>anthroposophic</b> <b>medicine</b> prescribe both conventional and complementary treatments. Our study may facilitate further CAM-research on indications of, for example, dementia or adverse drug reactions in the elderly. </p...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Over {{the past}} few years, a {{considerable}} increase in complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has been observed, particularly in primary care. In contrast {{little is known about}} the supply of CAM in Swiss hospitals. This study aims at the investigation of amount and structure of CAM activities of Swiss hospitals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We designed a cross-sectional survey using a 2 -step, questionnaire- based approach acquiring overview information form hospital managers in a first questionnaire leading to detailed information on CAM usage at medical department level (head of department). This second questionnaire provides data of physician-based and non-physician-based CAM supply. RESULTS: The size of hospitals was significantly associated with the provision of CAM. 33 % of the hospital managers indicated 1 or more medical doctor (MD) using CAM in their hospital compared to 37 % of confirmation on department level (Kappa value 0. 5). Mostly different CAM methods were applied. Acupuncture was used most frequently. However only 13 hospitals (11 %) occupied more than 3 CAM MDs and only 5 hospitals had more than 2 full-time equivalents for MDs. Furthermore, 74. 7 % of these personnel resources were dedicated for outpatient care. In terms of CAM methods <b>anthroposophic</b> <b>medicine</b> accounted for more than half of the total personnel costs. On the other hand usage of non-physician based CAM accounted for 41 % according to hospital managers compared to 64 % of CAM usage according to medical departments (Kappa values 0. 31). Reflexology of the foot was used most frequently. CONCLUSION: Total supply of CAM in Swiss hospitals is low and concentrates on few hospitals. Acupuncture is the widest spread discipline but <b>anthroposophic</b> <b>medicine</b> spends the most resources.

40|$|Barriers and {{challenges}} in integration of <b>anthroposophic</b> <b>medicine</b> in supportive breast cancer care Eran Ben-Arye 1, 2 *, Elad Schiff 3, 4, Moti Levy 5, Orit Gressel Raz 1, 5, Yael Barak 1, 5 and Gil Bar-Sela 6 In the last decade, {{more and more}} oncology centers are challenged with complementary medicine (CM) integration within supportive breast cancer care. Quality of life (QOL) improvement and attenuation of oncology treatment side effects are the core objectives of integrative CM programs in cancer care. Yet, limited research {{is available on the}} use of specific CM modalities in an integrative setting and on cancer patients ’ compliance with CM consultation. Studies are especially warranted to view the clinical application of researched CM modalities, such as <b>anthroposophic</b> <b>medicine</b> (AM), a unique CM modality oriented to cancer supportive care. Our objective was to characterize consultation patterns provided by physicians trained in CM following oncology health-care practitioners ’ referral of patients receiving chemotherapy. We aimed to identify characteristics of patients who consulted with AM and to explore patients ’ compliance to AM treatment. Of the 341 patients consulted with integrative physicians, 138 were diagnosed with breast cancer. Following integrative physician consultation, 56 patients were advised about AM treatment and 285 about other CM modalities. Logistic multivariate regression model found that, compared with patients receiving non-anthroposophic CM, the AM group had significantly greater rates of previous CM use [EXP(B) = 3. 25, 95 % C. I. 1. 64 - 6. 29, p = 0. 001] and higher rates of cancer recurrence at baseline (p = 0. 038). Most AM users (71. 4 %) used a single AM modality, such as mistletoe (viscum album) injections, oral AM supplements, or music therapy. Compliance with AM modalities following physician recommendation ranged from 44 % to 71 % of patients. We conclude that AM treatment provided within the integrative oncology setting is feasible based on compliance assessment. Other studies are warranted to explore the effectiveness of AM in improving patients ’ QOL during chemotherapy...|$|E
40|$|A small {{fraction}} of general practitioners (GPs) in the Netherlands has completed additional training in complementary medicine after obtaining their conventional medical degree. Using a data set from a health insurer, this paper documents that patients whose GP has additional training in <b>anthroposophic</b> <b>medicine,</b> homeopathy, or acupuncture have substantially lower health care costs and lower mortality rates. The lower costs result from fewer hospital stays and fewer prescription drugs. Since the differences remain once we control for neighborhood specific fixed effects at a highly detailed level, the lower costs and longer lives {{are unlikely to be}} related to differences in socio-economic status. Possible explanations are selection (e. g. people with a low taste for medical interventions might be more likely to choose CAM) and better practices (e. g. less overtreatment, more focus on preventive and curative health promotion) by GPs with knowledge of complementary medicine. ...|$|E
