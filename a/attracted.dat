5|$|Electronegativity is a {{chemical}} property {{that describes the}} tendency of an atom or a functional group to attract electrons (or electron density) towards itself. If the bond between sodium and chlorine in sodium chloride were covalent, the pair of shared electrons would be <b>attracted</b> to the chlorine because the effective nuclear charge on the outer electrons is +7 in chlorine but is only +1 in sodium. The electron pair is <b>attracted</b> {{so close to the}} chlorine atom that they are practically transferred to the chlorine atom (an ionic bond). However, if the sodium atom was replaced by a lithium atom, the electrons will not be <b>attracted</b> as close to the chlorine atom as before because the lithium atom is smaller, making the electron pair more strongly <b>attracted</b> to the closer effective nuclear charge from lithium. Hence, the larger alkali metal atoms (further down the group) will be less electronegative as the bonding pair is less strongly <b>attracted</b> towards them. As mentioned previously, francium is expected to be an exception.|$|E

5|$|Adult {{butterflies}} consume only liquids, ingested {{through the}} proboscis.

Some butterflies also visit dung, rotting fruit or carcasses to obtain minerals and nutrients.
