The data we employ is supplied {{by a group of}} eight GFMA member banks and comprises capital estimates and other data fields for 4, 614 individual securitisation tranches. We compare the capital implied by the different approaches, focussing on two dimensions of consistency: (i) comparisons of <b>average</b> <b>risk</b> <b>weight</b> levels for particular asset classes and (ii) correlations of individual tranche risk weights implied by the approaches. We find that the average levels of capital for asset classes are quite different when one compares IRBA, ERBA and SA risk weights for particular asset classes.

40|$|A {{new method}} for {{evaluation}} of edge detectors, based on the <b>average</b> <b>risk</b> of a decision, is discussed. The <b>average</b> <b>risk</b> is a performance measure well-known in Bayesian decision theory. Since edge detection {{can be regarded as}} a compound decision making process, the performance of an edge detector is context dependent. Therefore, the application of <b>average</b> <b>risk</b> to edge detection is non-trivial. The paper describes a method to estimate the probabilities on a number of different types of (context dependent) errors. A weighted sum of these estimated probabilities represents the <b>average</b> <b>risk.</b> The <b>weight</b> coefficients define the cost function. The method is suitable, not only for the comparison of edge operators, but also for the determination of the weaknesses and strengths of a certain edge operator. This is demonstrated with some well-known edge operator...|$|R

Primary examples are min or max functionals that frequently appear {{in the analysis of}} partially identified models. This paper investigates both the <b>average</b> <b>risk</b> approach and the minimax approach. The <b>average</b> <b>risk</b> approach considers <b>average</b> local asymptotic <b>risk</b> with a <b>weight</b> function Π over β-q(β) for a fixed location-scale equivariant map q, and the minimax approach searches for a robust decision that minimizes the local asymptotic maximal risk. In both approaches, optimal decisions are proposed. Certainly, the <b>average</b> <b>risk</b> approach is preferable to the minimax approach when one has fairly accurate information of β-q(β). When one does not, one may ask whether the <b>average</b> <b>risk</b> decision with a certain weight function Π is as robust as the minimax decision.

As a result, the internal model approach does not necessarily provide capital savings relative to the standardized method that encourages the financial institutions to develop internal models. Whether the internal model approaches can provide capital savings depends on the characteristics of the portfolios of the financial institutions. The capital savings will occur only in the case of low-risk financial institutions. The high-risk financial institutions will choose the standardized method as their calculation tool of capital requirements. To solve the moral hazard problem of “supervisory discrimination”, we propose the “VaR-based <b>risk</b> <b>weights</b> ” which can ensure capital savings of adoption of the internal model and thereby encourage the financial institutions to develop internal models...|$|R

Such “supervisory discrimination ” in terms of <b>risk</b> <b>weights</b> gives rise to the moral hazard problem in that the regulator fails to reduce the risk-taking incentives of institutions. The internal model approach does not necessarily provide the capital savings to encourage the institutions to develop internal models.

40|$|In September 2009, G 20 representatives {{called for}} {{introducing}} a minimum leverage ratio {{as an instrument}} of financial regulation. It is supposed to assure a certain degree of core capital for banks, independent of the controversial procedures used to assess risk. This paper discusses the interaction and tensions between the leverage ratio and risk-based capital requirements, using financial data of the Swiss systemically important bank UBS. It can be shown that the leverage ratio potentially undermines <b>risk</b> <b>weighting</b> such that banks feel encouraged to take greater risks. The paper proposes an alternative instrument that is conceived as a base <b>risk</b> <b>weight</b> and functions as a backstop. It ensures a minimum core capital ratio, based on unweighted total exposure by ensuring a minimum ratio of risk-weighted to total assets for all banks. The proposed measure is easy to compute like the leverage ratio, and also like the latter, it is independent of <b>risk</b> <b>weighting.</b> Yet, its primary advantage {{is that it does not}} supersede risk-based capital adequacy targets, but rather supplements them...|$|R

We present a Bayesian approach to disease surveillance when auxiliary risk information is available which will usually allow for substantial improvements over simple random sampling. Others have employed <b>risk</b> <b>weights</b> in surveillance, but this can result in overly optimistic statements regarding freedom from disease due to not accounting for the uncertainty in the auxiliary information; our approach remedies this.
