500|$|On the {{northern}} flank, the 3rd Canadian Division was again met with exceptional German resistance. The 8th Canadian Infantry Brigade managed to capture Source Farm and later Vapour Farm at the corps boundary, {{just short of}} the objective line. However, the brigade had difficulty getting through the swampy ground in the Woodland Plantation, resulting in a division in the line. The 58th Division and 63rd (Royal Naval) Division infantry were caught by German artillery fire at their jumping-off line and made only slight progress in deep mud against German machine-gun fire and were unable to reach their rendezvous objectives, leaving the Canadian troops <b>at</b> <b>Source</b> Farm and Vapour Farm in precarious and largely unsupported positions. Two companies later advanced through the Canadian sector to capture Source Trench but were only able to reinforce the Canadian outpost <b>at</b> <b>Source</b> Farm and form a defensive flank to Vapour Farm. In the centre of the assault was the 7th Canadian Infantry Brigade. Advancing between Ravebeek creek and the roadway to Meetcheele, one section of the brigade captured its intermediate objective, a pillbox known as Duck Lodge, by [...] To the west of the roadway and Meetcheele, the advance captured Furst Farm, albeit with heavy casualties. Later in the afternoon, the brigade succeeded in overcoming a number of pillboxes and captured the crossroads at Meetcheele. However, the Germans continued to hold a strong position at Graf House along the bank of the Ravebeek creek, producing a salient in the Canadian line directly between the two Canadian divisions.|$|E

[...] In a follow-up paper, analysed data from Surahammar, Sweden comparing the time when there were no FWD with the present when 50% of households have FWD.

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} a multi-source delivery system, where Raptor coding <b>at</b> <b>sources</b> and linear network coding in overlay nodes work in concert for efficient data delivery in networks with diversity. Such a combination permits to increase throughput and loss resiliency in multicast scenarios with possibly multiple sources. The network coding operations however change the degree {{distribution in the}} set of packets that reach the receivers, so that the low complexity decoding benefits of Raptor codes are unfortunately diminished. We propose in this paper to change the degree distribution at encoder, {{in such a way}} that the degree distribution after network coding operations recovers a form that leads to low complexity decoding. We first analyze how the degree distribution of the encoded symbols is altered by network coding operations and losses in a regular network. Then we formulate a geometric optimization problem in order to compute the best degree distribution for encoding <b>at</b> <b>sources,</b> such that the decoding complexity is low and close to Raptor decoders’ performance. Simulations show that it is possible to maintain the low complexity decoding performance of Raptor codes even after linear network coding operations, as long as the coding <b>at</b> <b>sources</b> is adapted to the network characteristics.
