40|$|Abstract. This paper {{examines}} how a biodiversity monitoring {{system based on}} data collected by protected area staff and local communities was established and maintained in Xe Pian national protected area, Laos. Monitoring activities commenced with project support in 1998. Protected area staff, district forestry staff and villagers continued the monitoring work after 2001 when the external advisers left. More than 2500 records of wildlife, natural resource use and threats to the protected area were collected by villagers and protected area staff, mainly through use of patrols, village discussions and village logbooks. The management interventions that followed the monitoring activities were a reaction to immediate threats or perceived trends in biodiversity rather than to trends revealed by analyses of the collected data. Patrols and village discussions came to a virtual standstill when external funding ceased, probably {{because of lack of}} supporting national policies. The <b>annual</b> <b>running</b> <b>cost</b> of the monitoring system was only about US $ 4000 or 0. 02 per ha of forest habitat...|$|E
40|$|It {{is unclear}} whether {{and to what extent}} {{intensive}} case management is more effective than standard occupational health services in reducing sickness absence in the health care sector. Our aim is to evaluate a new return to work service at an English hospital trust. The new service entailed intensive case management for staff who had been absent sick for longer than 4 weeks, aiming to restore function through a goal-directed and enabling approach based on a bio-psycho-social model. Assessment of the intervention was by controlled before and after comparison with a neighbouring hospital trust at which there were no major changes in the management of sickness absence. Data on outcome measures were abstracted from electronic databases held by the two trusts. At the intervention trust, the proportion of 4 -week absences that continued beyond 8 weeks fell from 51. 7 % in 2008 to 49. 1 % in 2009 and 45. 9 % in 2010. The reduction from 2008 to 2010 contrasted with an increase at the control trust from 51. 2 % to 56. 1 %—a difference in change of 10. 7 % (95 % CI 1. 5 – 20. 0 %). There was also a differential improvement in mean days of absence beyond 4 weeks, but this was not statistically significant (1. 6 days per absence; 95 % CI ? 7. 2 to 10. 3 days). Our findings suggest that the intervention was effective, and calculations based on an <b>annual</b> <b>running</b> <b>cost</b> of £ 57 000 suggest that it was also cost-effective. A similar intervention should now be evaluated at a larger number of hospital trusts...|$|E

40|$|Tanzania, {{like other}} African countries, faces {{significant}} health workforce shortages. With advisory and partnership from Columbia University, the Ifakara Health Institute and the Tanzanian Training Centre for International Health (TTCIH) developed and implemented the Connect Project as a randomized cluster experimental {{trial of the}} childhood survival impact of recruiting, training, and deploying of a new cadre of paid community health workers (CHW), named "Wawazesha wa afya ya Jamii" (WAJA). This paper presents an estimation {{of the cost of}} training and deploying WAJA in three rural districts of Tanzania. Costing data were collected by tracking project activity expenditure records and conducting in-depth interviews of TTCIH staff who have led the training and deployment of WAJA, as well as their counterparts at Public Clinical Training Centres who have responsibility for scaling up the WAJA training program. The trial is registered with the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Register number (ISRCTN 96819844). The Connect training cost was US$ 2, 489. 3 per WAJA, of which 40. 1 % was for meals, 20. 2 % for accommodation 10. 2 % for tuition fees and the remaining 29. 5 % for other costs including instruction and training facilities and field allowance. A comparable training program estimated unit cost for scaling-up this training via regional/district clinical training centres would be US$ 833. 5 per WAJA. Of this unit cost, 50. 3 % would involve the cost of meals, 27. 4 % training fees, 13. 7 % for field allowances, 9 % for accommodation and medical insurance. The <b>annual</b> <b>running</b> <b>cost</b> of WAJA in a village will cost US$ 1. 16 per capita. Costs estimated by this study are likely to be sustainable on a large scale, particularly if existing regional/district institutions are utilized for this program...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND Achieving the Millennium Development Goals {{for health}} {{requires}} a massive scaling-up of interventions in Sub Saharan Africa. Intermittent Preventive Treatment in infants (IPTi) is a promising new tool for malaria control. Although efficacy {{information is available}} for many interventions, there is a dearth of data on the resources required for scaling up of health interventions. METHOD We worked {{in partnership with the}} Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MoHSW) to develop an IPTi strategy that could be implemented and managed by routine health services. We tracked health system and other costs of (1) developing the strategy and (2) maintaining routine implementation of the strategy in five districts in southern Tanzania. Financial costs were extracted and summarized from a costing template and semi-structured interviews were conducted with key informants to record time and resources spent on IPTi activities. RESULTS The estimated financial cost to start-up and run IPTi in the whole of Tanzania in 2005 was US 1, 486, 284. Start-up costs of US 36, 363 were incurred at the national level, mainly on the development of Behaviour Change Communication (BCC) materials, stakeholders' meetings and other consultations. The <b>annual</b> <b>running</b> <b>cost</b> at national level for intervention management and monitoring and drug purchase was estimated at US 459, 096. Start-up costs at the district level were US 7, 885 per district, mainly expenditure on training. Annual running costs were US 170 per district, mainly for printing of BCC materials. There was no incremental financial expenditure needed to deliver the intervention in health facilities as supplies were delivered alongside routine vaccinations and available health workers performed the activities without working overtime. The economic cost was estimated at 23 US cents per IPTi dose delivered. CONCLUSION The costs presented here show the order of magnitude of expenditures needed to initiate and to implement IPTi at national scale in settings with high Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) coverage. The IPTi intervention appears to be affordable even within the budget constraints of Ministries of Health of most sub-Saharan African countries...|$|E
40|$|Many of the {{techniques}} have been proposed to improve the dryer efficiency. The drying process has not been analyzed thoroughly. The experimental results of 32 runs of a Frigidaire clothes dryer are presented. The dryer is fully instrumented to measure the instantaneous air temperatures, the instantaneous surface temperatures, the instantaneous power, and inlet, and outlet flow rates. The effect {{of many of the}} dryer parameters such as heater power, fan speed, drum speed, weight of clothes and initial moisture content were experimented, documented, and analyzed. The results were discussed and many new proposed techniques to improve the dryer performance were recommended.;Electric heaters are used in many industrial applications. There are many interacting parameters that affect the heater performance and contribute to its cost. Such parameters are coil length, coil diameter, the helix diameter, the number of turns, the coil emissivity, the heater wall emissivity, the applied voltage, the air flow rate, the air temperature at the heater outlet, and the heater dimensions. The heater coil was divided into four segments and the heater wall was divided into five sections. Energy and heat transfer equations were written for each segment of the coil, each section of the wall, and the air past each coil segment. Equations relating the configuration factors from the coil segments to the wall sections, to the heater dimensions were derived. EES was used to solve the system of two hundred non-linear equations. The effect of varying the heater parameters on the heater performance were studied and discussed. The objective function is constructed for the annual cost of an appliance electric heater using an estimate for the energy usage and the manufacturing cost. A detailed model for the electric heater is utilized to minimize the objective function relative to nine design variables, subject to thirteen inequality constraints. Experimental results are used to correlate the mass flux to the dryer input parameters. The correlation is used to determine the running cost. The objective function of the <b>annual</b> <b>running</b> <b>cost</b> plus the cost of the heater is optimized using different methods. The optimization results are presented and discussed...|$|E

40|$|Since the 1970 s, over a thirty-year period, {{awareness}} of the limitation in fossil fuel reserves has been increased steadily and international {{attention has been given}} to an energy conservative way of life. Like many developing countries, today Iran is beset with serious energy supply difficulties. The main issues are the rapid increase in energy demand/cost, air pollution caused by over use of fossil fuels (usually used in buildings for heating purposes), the limitation of fossil fuel resources and the difficulties in the transportation and distribution of fossil fuel especially in winter around the country. Therefore, it is crucial to adopt a new strategy for sustainable energy use and to consider the application of renewable energy technologies in the design of buildings. Solar energy {{is one of the most}} significant and technically exploitable renewable energy resources available in Iran. This needs to be taken into account seriously, regarding both economical and environmental problems in that country. Since school buildings in Iran are one of the major consumes of energy for heating, cooling and lighting purposes and according to their inappropriate current design from the energy efficiency point of view, this study has been performed with the aim of developing methods of optimising the energy performance of school buildings in Iran and promoting low energy architecture in the design of these buildings in different climatic regions of Iran. For this purpose, first the Iranian climatic has been reviewed and appropriate classification was presented. Since solar radiation data have not been calculated in Iran so far, there was a need for a precise calculation of solar radiation for each and every city in order to better exploit the benefits of solar energy for the future of this country. Therefore, the method of calculation of solar radiation in different cities of Iran based on European Solar Atlas and Islamic Republic of Iran Meteorological Organisation's statistics was presented and a spreadsheet excel program was developed for the calculation of solar radiation data of 152 cities of Iran. A comparison has been made between the excel program and Meteonorm. The result showed that the excel program data were more useful in that they were more precise and much more reliable compared to Meteonorm data for Iran. Also, based on solar radiation data another excel program (based on the admittance method) was developed for the calculation of heating, cooling and lighting energy use of buildings in Iran. By using this program the effect of window design on the thermal performance of school buildings and the response of walls and roofs to solar radiation was investigated in hot climates. Substantial saving in the <b>annual</b> <b>running</b> <b>cost</b> of school buildings as much as 14 % was achieved under appropriate window arrangement. In order to explore the problems of existing design, a case study has been performed on current schools design in Iran and the energy use of these schools was analysed...|$|E

In this paper energy use, consequential emissions of CO 2, and <b>annual</b> <b>running</b> <b>costs</b> for a case study comprising 14 newly constructed low energy affordable homes are evaluated. Four different energy typologies are compared: ground sourced heat pumps; active solar (thermal and photovoltaic); passive solar and mechanical ventilation with heat recovery; conventional high efficiency gas boiler. The carbon embodied in construction and emitted over a 20 year occupation period for each typology is calculated. Ground source heat pumps have the highest annual primary energy demand, CO 2 emission and <b>annual</b> <b>running</b> <b>costs</b> over the 20 year period.
