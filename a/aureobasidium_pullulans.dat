They exhibit significant biological effects and {{are widely used}} in the food industry, pharmacy and cosmetics. The aim of this diploma thesis proposed as a comparative study was regulation of carotenoid and ergosterol production in red yeasts using several waste substrates as whey, corn germs, wheat, apple fiber and pasta. To selected production media extracellular hydrolytic enzymes degrading polysaccharide were added. These enzymes {{were obtained from the}} cultivation media of four fungal strains. In this study three carotenogenic yeast strains were used: Rhodotorula glutinis, Sporobolomyces roseus and Cystofilobasidium capitatum. All strains were cultivated simultaneously and changes in biomass and carotenoid production in different production media were monitored and compared. As the best waste substrate apple fiber was utilized, particularly in Rhodotorula glutinis, which exhibited mainly biomass production increase. In Sporobolomyces roseus increased production of biomass and carotenoids have been reported in media with hydrolyzed fiber and pasta as well. Beta-carotene production in this strain reached 4776, 38 mg/g of dry weight. The strain Cystofilobasidium capitatum exhibited in waste media a decerase of biomass production accompanied with increased production of carotenoids, especially in wheat mush and pasta medium hydrolyzed by enzyme preparative from <b>Aureobasidium</b> <b>pullulan.</b> It can be concluded that hydrolyzed waste substrates are very hopeful as cheap nutrient sources for yeast strains producing carotenoids and ergosterol.

Well studied examples include the yeast Debaryomyces hansenii and black yeasts <b>Aureobasidium</b> <b>pullulans</b> and Hortaea werneckii.

5000|$|... “Black yeasts”, {{sometimes}} also black fungi, dematiaceous fungi, microcolonial fungi or meristematic fungi is {{a diverse}} group of slow-growing microfungi which reproduce mostly asexually (fungi imperfecti). Only few genera reproduce by budding cells, while in others hyphal or meristematic (isodiametric) reproduction is preponderant. Black yeasts share some distinctive characteristics, in particular melanisation of their cell wall. Morphological plasticity, incrustation of the cell wall with melanins and presence of other protective substances like carotenoids and mycosporines represent passive physiological adaptations which enable black fungi to be highly resistant against environmental stresses. The term [...] "polyextremotolerance" [...] has been introduced to describe this phenotype, a good example of which is the species <b>Aureobasidium</b> <b>pullulans.</b> Presence of 1,8-dihydroxynaphtalene melanin in the cell wall confers to the microfungi their characteristic olivaceous to dark brown/black colour.|$|E
5000|$|Pullulan is a {{polysaccharide}} polymer {{consisting of}} maltotriose units, {{also known as}} α-1,4-α-1,6-glucan'. Three glucose units in maltotriose are connected by an α-1,4 glycosidic bond, whereas consecutive maltotriose units are connected to each other by an α-1,6 glycosidic bond. Pullulan is produced from starch by the fungus <b>Aureobasidium</b> <b>pullulans.</b> Pullulan is mainly used by the cell to resist desiccation and predation. The presence of this polysaccharide also facilitates diffusion of molecules both {{into and out of}} the cell. As an edible, mostly tasteless polymer, the chief commercial use of pullulan is in the manufacture of edible films that are used in various breath freshener or oral hygiene products such as Listerine Cool Mint of Johnson and Johnson (USA) and Meltz Super Thin Mints of Avery Bio-Tech Private Ltd.

Methods: Production of antistaphylococcal metabolite from <b>Aureobasidium</b> <b>pullulans</b> was optimized in shake flasks using a statistical experimental design approach. Effect of various components in the basal medium, glucose, peptone, KH 2 PO 4 as well as initial pH and temperature were statistically combined using a 2 level, 4 factor experimental design and tested for their influence on maximal antistaphylococcal metabolite production. Results were analyzed using response surface methodology (RSM) software. Results: Optimum production of antistaphylococcal metabolite occurred at glucose 2. 0 %, peptone 2. 5 %, KH 2 PO 4 0. 15 %, pH 4. 0 and temperature 30 °C. The maximum amount of antistaphylococcal metabolite 900 U/flask from about 0. 85 g of dry weight biomass was extracted.

To characterise the genetic variability of <b>Aureobasidium</b> <b>pullulans</b> strains originating from the Arctic and strains originating pan-globally, a multilocus molecular analysis was performed, through rDNA (internal transcribed spacers, partial 28 S rDNA), and partial introns and exons of genes encoding β-tubulin (TUB), translation elongation factor (EF 1 α) and elongase (ELO). Two globally ubiquitous varieties were distinguished: var. pullulans, occurring particularly in slightly osmotic substrates and in the phyllosphere; and var. melanogenum, mainly isolated from watery habitats. Both varieties were commonly isolated from the sampled Arctic habitats. However, some aureobasidium-like strains from subglacial ice from three different glaciers in Kongsfjorden (Svalbard, Spitsbergen), appeared to represent a new variety of A. pullulans.
