Using similarity transformations the governing nonlinear partial differential equations are transformed into a system of ordinary differential equations that are then solved numerically by applying Nachtsheim–Swigert shooting iteration technique along with sixth-order Runge–Kutta integration scheme. The effects of the pertinent parameters on the radial, tangential and axial velocities, temperature and concentration distributions, and axial thermophoretic velocity together with the local skin-friction coefficient, and local Nusselt number are displayed graphically. The inward <b>axial</b> thermophoretic <b>deposition</b> velocity (local Stanton number) is also tabulated.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{magneto-optical}} {{study of the}} magnetic behavior of sputtered iron films of various thickness ranging from 2 to 50 nm grown on a silicon substrate. First we calculate the reflection coefficients {{in the case of}} an homogeneous magneto-optical layer with in-plane magnetization. Then we describe a technique in which both in-plane magnetization components are detected. Because of the <b>axial</b> <b>deposition</b> procedure, iron films exhibit in-plane uniaxial anisotropy depending on the thickness of the layer. In particular, we show that, for 4 nm thickness, anisotropy induced by slightly tilted columnar growth can be observed, whereas for larger thicknesses this in-plane anisotropy vanishes. Using an accurate acquisition system based upon a rapid analog-to-digital converter we measured the rapid magnetization reversal. The field sweep rate was varied between 100 Oe/s and l MOe/s. We interpret the observed dynamical effects in terms of wall movement and microdomain reversal...|$|E

40|$|The {{refractive}} index profile of germanium doped preforms for optical fibers {{is determined by the}} radial distribution of germanium concentration. Knowing that there is a correlation between the germanium doping profile and the deposition surface profile of vapor-phase <b>axial</b> <b>deposition</b> (VAD) preforms, the study of this correlation has been carried out in order to estimate, indirectly, the {{refractive index}} profile of VAD preforms for optical fibers during the deposition stage. This correlation was studied through the parameterization of the preform deposition surface using two parameters: the power law index profile that best fits the preform bottom profile (alpha) and the axial distance from the bottom tip to a reference height (h). A range of values of these parameters to produce VAD preforms with standard and special doping profiles has been presented. Preforms with triangular index profile can be fabricated with alpha and h values of about 2. 0 and 5. 0 mm, respectively, and preforms with parabolic index profiles can be produced with alpha and h values of about 2. 0 and 4. 0 mm, respectively...|$|E
40|$|The vapor-phase <b>axial</b> <b>deposition</b> {{process is}} {{currently}} {{one of the}} most advantageous methods to produce preforms for optical fibers, due to its high efficiency and reduced production cost. However, this method has great difficulty in determining the refractive index profile, since it is influenced by too many process parameters. In this work, an automation system to determine the refractive index profile by monitoring the preform deposition surface profile during the soot preform deposition stage is presented. Based on a previous study that showed a strong correlation between these two profiles, an automation system was developed in LABVIEW to monitor the deposition surface profile during the preform deposition stage in order to estimate the preform germanium doping profile and refractive index profile, as well as a theoretical study to develop this system in order to minimize the performance impairment. As a result, not only preforms with a predetermined index profile were produced but also a reduction in production cost was obtained by decreasing the number of preform rejects.

40|$|The {{development}} of a cascaded feedback control strategy for a vapor-phase <b>axial</b> <b>deposition</b> (VAD) process is investigated in this paper. VAD is a widely used process {{in the creation of}} high purity glass for optical fiber. In previous work a soot tip surface temperature controller was developed for the VAD process to reduce the effects of core soot temperature variation on deposition, leading to a more stable process. However, this approach did not address the need to regulate and link the deposition rates of the core and clad torches. To maintain a constant distance between the core and clad deposition surfaces, it is desired to have the core soot and clad soot depositing at the same linear speed to provide a more uniform product. This paper presents the design and {{development of}} a cascaded controller strategy and process model to couple and regulate the surface temperature and deposition rates of core and clad soot. Simulations for the process and control scheme demonstrate a potential improvement in the uniformity of the core and clad soot geometry over the soot product length...|$|E
40|$|Transgenic mice that {{developed}} adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) -producing pituitary tumors were generated with the polyoma early region promotor {{linked to a}} cDNA encoding polyoma large T antigen (PyLT). Light microscopic examination of the pituitaries showed normal morphology at 4 months of age, either unremarkable morphology or microadenoma formation at 9 months of age, and up to 5 mm large adenomas in clinically ill transgenic mice at 13 - 16 months of age. At age 9 months, transgenic mice weighed significantly more than corresponding control mice, but they began wasting at approximately 1 year of age. The adrenal glands of these older PyLT- 1 mice showed a weight increase and exhibited a medullary hyperplasia. Subcutaneous transplants of transgenic pituitary tumors to nontransgenic, immunocompetent mice resulted in tumors with a morphology and ACTH immunoreactivity similar to the primary tumor. The effects of hypercorticotropism were more enhanced and occurred with a shorter latency in the mice carrying transgene pituitary transplants than in the PyLT- 1 transgenic mice themselves. Moreover, these transplanted mice showed a weight increase with an <b>axial</b> <b>deposition</b> pattern and hypertrophy of the adrenal cortex that resembled the findings in human Cushing's disease.

40|$|Preform is an {{intermediate}} {{product in the}} optical fiber manufacturing process. There are three major processes used in the manufacturing of preform. These are MCVD (Modified Chemical Vapor Deposition) process, ACVD (Atmospheric Chemical Vapor Deposition) process and VAD (Vapor <b>Axial</b> <b>Deposition)</b> process. In the ACVD process {{it is difficult to}} predict the outer preform diameter as it depends on many in-process parameters like density of soot glass deposited, cross sectional area (CSA) of glass to be deposited on the target core rod, sintering speed, furnace temperature and helium flow in the sinter tube during consolidation process. Diameter of preform must be within the limits according to the set up of drawing furnace. For the uniform sintering environment i. e. at constant sintering temperature, speed and helium flow, density of soot glass {{plays a major role in}} deciding the preform diameter. We report here a linear relationship between density of soot glass, cross sectional area (CSA) of glass to be deposited on the core rod and final preform diameter after sintering process using a multiple regression technique. Total 2825 samples were taken for the study with soot density between 0. 3 to 0. 7 gm/mm 3 and CSA of glass to be deposited on the core rod between 3700 to 6500 mm 2.
