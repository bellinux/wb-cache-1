500|$|Neva Chonin of the San Francisco Chronicle {{believed}} the show [...] "was pure Britney excess, [...] hugely entertaining" [...] {{and added that}} [...] "while it's {{all too easy to}} deride Spears' contrivances from a distance, in person there's no denying her charisma or her archetypal appeal. She's like a refugee from David Lynch's Mulholland Drive, <b>a</b> <b>gleaming</b> dream cipher waiting to be filled with an audience's fantasies. And she works that role with flawless professionalism, punctuating her choreographed moves with an amiable accessibility that drew fans into her airtight world even as it kept them at a safe distance. In short, she connected—through smiles, giggles and what seemed to be genuine pleasure in performing." [...] While reviewing the Femme Fatale Tour in 2011, Jim Harrington of the Oakland Tribune deemed the show as [...] "one of the best pop music productions I’ve ever witnessed." ...|$|E
500|$|Horch {{expended}} $2,497,164 {{for land}} and construction costs. He used $1,790,500 {{of the mortgage}} bond issue, $64,500 of a second mortgage, and made up the rest from a loan he himself made. The completed structure had 233 one-room, 63 two-room, and two three-room apartments {{as well as a}} penthouse suite of seven rooms. It had a series of recessions and terraces beginning at the sixteenth story which culminate in a tower. Its steel skeleton was interior, lacking the corner columns that were present in other buildings of the time. It had a brick exterior that was deep purple in its lower stories gradually growing lighter in color until at the top a faint lavender blended into pure white. Harvey Wiley Corbett said the coloration gave the skyscraper a [...] "feeling of growth." [...] He said, [...] "this colored brick exterior, which rises from a low, dark ground to <b>a</b> <b>gleaming,</b> white pinnacle, gives the building a dynamic quality. The play of sunlight on the many hues will make the building a beautiful spectacle of changing colors." ...|$|E
500|$|In Mirror's Edge, {{the player}} {{controls}} the protagonist, Faith, from a first-person perspective {{as she is}} challenged to navigate across <b>a</b> <b>gleaming</b> city by jumping between rooftops, running across walls, and gaining access to buildings through ventilation shafts. This is accomplished by use of techniques and movements inspired by the discipline of parkour. According to senior producer Owen O'Brien, Mirror's Edge aims to [...] "convey [...] strain and physical contact with the environment", {{with the goal of}} allowing a freedom of movement previously unseen in the first-person genre. In order to achieve this, camera movement pays more attention to character movement. For example, as Faith's speed builds up while running, {{the rate at which the}} camera bobs up and down increases as well. When a roll is executed, the camera spins with the character. Faith's arms, legs, and torso are prominent and their visibility is used to convey movement and momentum. The character's arms pump and the length of her steps increase with her gait, and her legs cycle and arms flail during long jumps.|$|E

500|$|In 2004, Defeated Sanity {{signed with}} UK label Grindethic Records to release their {{full-length}} debut. The album was recorded at Soundforge Studios in Rhauderfehn, Germany. The band produced {{the record and}} Andreas Hilbert handled the engineering and mastering. Prelude to the Tragedy was released in November that same year. The album received mixed reviews. Diabolical Conquest said, [...] "Prelude to the Tragedy is <b>a</b> <b>gleaming</b> chrome harpoon of immaculate technical death metal, deftly interweaving cryptic riff-tangles with convolutional percussive violence to surprisingly comprehensible and utterly enjoyable results. Drumwork, relentless in its complexity, enhances both the progressive and barbaric elements of the tracks, nailing ambitious patterns to them with satisfying snare punch, lucid cymbals and expert fills." [...] Negative criticism of the album was mostly about the higher technical style of their music. Lords of Metal said, [...] "This is only interesting for the real die hard trash (not thrash!) lovers, and mathematicians, of course." [...] To promote the album, the band toured during 2005, appearing at Rotterdam Deathfest (an extreme metal festival in The Netherlands), along with bands such as Suffocation, Visceral Bleeding, and Vomit Remnants.|$|E
500|$|James Dinh of MTV {{noted that}} [...] "the pop star appears strong, bold {{and just a}} tad resentful after a breakup" [...] on the track. His {{analysis}} of the lyrics observed that [...] "The singer declares herself unbreakable after a breakup, evident in lines such as [...] "Days like this I want to drive away/ Pack my bags and watch your shadow fade/ 'Cause you chewed me up and spit me out/ Like I was poison in your mouth/ You took my light, you drained me down/ But that was then and this is now, now look at me." [...] Dinh pointed out similarities between [...] "Part of Me" [...] and Perry's previous single [...] "California Gurls", noting that [...] "the tune's steady beat amplifies" [...] as the chorus starts. Andrew Hampp of Billboard described the song as a [...] "dance-floor rave up", and compared the song's composition to Jessie J's [...] "Domino". Edna Gundersen from USA Today stated: [...] "Katy Perry could be addressing her ex or her detractors on this defiant slapdown, <b>a</b> <b>gleaming</b> [...] "Firework"-like pop torpedo propelled by slick beats and a brazen chorus." [...] Chris Ryan, also of MTV, inferred that the song was aimed at Perry's ex-boyfriend Travie McCoy, while New York magazine journalist Amanda Dobbis described it as [...] "another break-up anthem". Fans and media noted differences in the lyrics between the demo and the single, and claimed that the changes redirected the song's subject from McCoy to Perry's ex-husband Russell Brand, from whom she had recently divorced. Perry declared it was not about Brand, stating: ...|$|E

2500|$|Hello Hurricane {{garnered}} {{critical acclaim}} {{by taking the}} twenty-one music critics ratings and reviews into account; however, Metacritic reports by utilizing just five music critics ratings and reviews that the album has a [...] "weighted average" [...] Metascore of a 74, which mean the album received [...] "generally favorable reviews". At Christianity Today, Andrew Greer rated the album four stars, and comment that [...] "Hello Hurricanes broad musical landscape supports a deep lyrical dig into the grief {{of the human heart}} and brazenly extends eternal hope for the soul." [...] Andy Argyrakis of CCM Magazine rate the album four-and-a-half stars, and noted that [...] "Switchfoot maintains its spiritual mindset, but never comes across as preachy in a secular environment, making Hello Hurricane the ultimate benchmark for any like-minded act, and amongst this band's very best." [...] At Paste, Reid Davis rated the album a seven-point four, and called the album a [...] "meat-and-potatoes arena rock polished to <b>a</b> <b>gleaming</b> sheen (thanks to producer Mike Elizondo), wrapped around huge hooks and intercut by Foreman’s incisive, discontented lyrics, which almost always manage to translate sentiments rooted deeply in faith to universally relatable choruses." ...|$|E
