2500|$|When {{the votes}} were counted {{election}} day, the Democrats had gained a whopping 13 {{seats in the}} Senate and 46 in the House, for the biggest majorities since 1940 and 1936, respectively.

2500|$|Roosevelt died in April 1945 and Harry S. Truman, a less liberal Democrat became President and {{replaced}} most of Roosevelt's top appointees.

With the blunders of the Truman administration in 1945 and 1946, the slogans [...] "Had Enough?" [...] and [...] "To Err is Truman" [...] became Republican rallying cries <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> won control of Congress {{for the first time since}} 1928, with Joseph William Martin, Jr. as Speaker of the House. The Taft-Hartley Act of 1947 was designed to balance the rights of management and labor. It was the central issue of many elections in industrial states in the 1940s to 1950s, but the unions were never able to repeal it.|$|E

5|$|The Republicans {{convened in}} Chicago and {{nominated}} former Speaker of the House James G. Blaine of Maine for {{president on the}} fourth ballot.
