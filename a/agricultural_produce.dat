5|$|Aside {{from the}} {{development}} of the linen industry, Ireland was largely passed over by the industrial revolution, partly because it lacked coal and iron resources and partly because {{of the impact of the}} sudden union with the structurally superior economy of England, which saw Ireland as a source of <b>agricultural</b> <b>produce</b> and capital.|$|E
5|$|In the 1860s {{plans were}} laid for a deep-water harbour on the {{northern}} shore of Brean Down.

5|$|Ancient stone {{structures}} {{testify to}} the presence of Stroma's earliest residents, while a Norse presence around 900–1,000 years ago is recorded in the Orkneyinga Saga. It has been politically united with Caithness since at least the 15th century. Although Stroma lies only a few miles off the Scottish coast, the savage weather and ferociously strong tides of the Pentland Firth meant that the island's inhabitants were very isolated, causing them to be largely self-sufficient, trading <b>agricultural</b> <b>produce</b> and fish with the mainlanders.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the revenue}} of Dwarka is derived from tourism, due to it being a site for pilgrims. It is a {{producer}} of <b>agricultural</b> <b>produce</b> such as millets, ghee (clarified butter), oilseeds, and salt, which are transported from its port. A long term development plan was proposed in 2011 with investment of ₹830 million to refurbish the city of Dwarka and to build a bridge connecting the city with Okha and Bet Dwarka.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving the}} main line {{immediately}} south of Hellingly, the railway passed over gated level crossings at Park Road and New Road. Farm Siding, a single siding on {{the west of the}} line beyond the crossings, was a collection point for the farm's <b>agricultural</b> <b>produce</b> {{in the early years of}} the railway, but later fell out of use. The line climbed most of the way from here to the hospital at 1 in 50. About halfway between Hellingly and the hospital the line entered the hospital grounds, passing to the west of Park House Siding, which served the hospital's Park House annexe.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Aiming at the {{parameter}} optimization {{of least}} square {{support vector machine}} (LS-SVM), an improved quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (IQPSO) algorithm for LS-SVM parameter selection was proposed. Based on QPSO, the algorithm optimizes particle initializing positions and improves solving speed and precision by sampling and linearizing methods. IQPSO LS-SVM model was test by test functions and was compared with QPSO LS-SVM model. Furthermore, it was applied to thread’s amount setting of database server in an <b>agricultural</b> <b>producing</b> system. The {{results show that the}} proposed model has greater solving speed and higher precision. It can meet the database’s load requirement by thread’s amount adjustment in <b>agricultural</b> <b>producing</b> system...|$|R
5|$|Division of Sector West into Croatian- and RSK-controlled areas {{fragmented}} {{the market}} for locally grown <b>agricultural</b> <b>produce,</b> and produce processing plants were rendered inaccessible to most farmers. Furthermore, the RSK-controlled area of Sector West suffered from severe shortage of fuel and electricity, while the Croatian-held Pakrac was cut off from water supply systems fed by springs in the RSK-held area {{to the south of}} the town. The situation led the head of the UN Civil Affairs in Sector West, Gerard Fischer, and Argentine General Carlos Maria Zabala, commanding officer of the UNPROFOR in Sector West, to propose a degree of cooperation between local authorities on both sides in the area.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Lum Chang Holdings {{sold the}} {{building}} at a price of S$25 million to Yu Kwok Chun, who {{was the head of}} a Hong Kong-based multinational corporation with its flagship department store, Yue Hwa Chinese Products Emporium. The company, set up by Yu's father in 1959, is a global corporation of 35 companies involved in investments, travel and general trading. Yue Hwa's three department stores in Hong Kong are popular with both Hong Kongers and tourists. Besides <b>agricultural</b> <b>produce</b> from various provinces of China, the stores also sell jade carvings, handicrafts, antiques and medical products such as ginseng, antlers and cordyceps.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps most importantly, Pinckney's Treaty granted both Spanish and American ships {{unrestricted}} navigation rights {{along the}} entire Mississippi River, as well as duty-free transport for American ships through the Spanish port of New Orleans, opening much of the Ohio River basin for settlement and trade. <b>Agricultural</b> <b>produce</b> could now flow on flatboats down the Ohio River to the Mississippi and on to New Orleans and Europe. Spain and the United States further agreed to protect the vessels of the other party anywhere within their jurisdictions and to not detain or embargo the other's citizens or vessels.|$|E

5|$|Swahili coastal {{settlements}} frequently conducted {{trade with}} the interior, obtaining goods for overseas trade or local consumption. However, isolated and small settlements have been interpreted as hinterlands that developed around and supported the economies of the larger settlements. Small settlements or hamlets were established between the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries within the vicinity of Gedi including sites {{at the end of}} Mida Creek, Kiburugeni, Watamu, Shaka, and Kilepwa. These smaller settlements are thought to represent agricultural communities that provided Gedi with most of its <b>agricultural</b> <b>produce.</b>|$|E
5|$|Taxes were levied on {{mining and}} forest products, and {{additional}} income was raised through tolls {{for the use}} of transportation facilities. The state also collected fees from customs, professional licenses, and judicial fines. Records show horses and salt were taxed as well as commodities (gold, textiles, perfumes) and <b>agricultural</b> <b>produce</b> (black pepper, paddy, spices, betel leaves, palm leaves, coconuts and sugar). Land tax assessment was based on frequent surveys evaluating the quality of land and the type of produce. Chalukya records specifically mention black soil and red soil lands in addition to wetland, dry land and wasteland in determining taxation rates.|$|E
5|$|The {{battles of}} zduhaći were furious. They were {{accompanied}} by forceful gales and whirlwinds which uprooted trees and whipped up dust. In Montenegro, it was considered dangerous to throw stones in the wind, because that might knock out an eye of a zduhać, who would kill the culprit. A fighting zduhać was supposed to retain his peck measure and milk bucket, while trying to seize these objects from an enemy zduhać; he should hit and not get hit. The victorious band of zduhaći would loot the yield of all <b>agricultural</b> <b>produce</b> from the territory of their defeated foes. The harvest in the coming season would thus be excellent for the victors and poor for the defeated zduhaći.|$|E
50|$|Absence of {{industries}} around Vilathikulam makes its economy to be {{solely dependent on}} agriculture.

50|$|The {{sanctuary}} comprises arid and semi-arid (dry) grasslands with scrubs containing scattered {{bushes and}} some cultivation. The bustard, which is mainly a terrestrial bird, has adapted to this habitat. As its natural habitat, it feeds on traditional <b>agricultural</b> <b>produces</b> such as bajra, juvar and other cereal crops {{and also on}} insects and reptiles.|$|R
50|$|The main <b>agricultural</b> goods <b>produced</b> are tomatoes, cassava, {{sugarcane}} and oranges.|$|R
5|$|The former Eastern Region {{was once}} famed for {{producing}} half the world's total output of palm kernels. Since the Nigerian Civil War production has markedly declined {{largely because the}} plantations and processing equipment were either damaged or destroyed. The production of other important cash crops such as cocoa, groundnut and groundnut oil, rubber, cassava, cotton and cotton seed and timber tumbled {{after the civil war}} and the subsequent oil boom years. Consequently, the area called Enugu State as well as the rest of Nigeria, which was once a self-sufficient net exporter in <b>agricultural</b> <b>produce,</b> must import food.|$|E
5|$|Notions {{associated}} with the zduhać, vetrovnjak, and dragon man, respectively, are not identical. The dragon man fought against female demons called ala, which led hail clouds over fields to destroy crops, and consumed the fertility of the fields. The zduhaći (plural) of an area usually fought together against the attacking zduhaći of another area who were bringing a storm and hail clouds above their fields. The victorious zduhaći would loot the yield of all <b>agricultural</b> <b>produce</b> from the territory of their defeated foes, {{and take it to}} their own region. The vetrovnjak, recorded in parts of western Serbia, fought against a bringer of bad weather imagined as a black bird. The zduhaći are recorded in Montenegro, eastern Herzegovina, part of Bosnia, and the Sandžak region of south-western Serbia. The dragon men are recorded in eastern Serbia, Banat, western Bulgaria, and Macedonia.|$|E
5|$|Occupations in Tirunelveli include service-sector {{activities}} such as administration, agricultural trading, tourism, banking, agro-machinery, information technology and educational services. In 1991, the Tirunelveli region ranked second {{in the number of}} women workers. Service sectors such as tourism have developed, due to a growth in religious tourism. Tirunelveli has beedi and cement factories, tobacco companies, workshops for steel-based products and mills for cotton textiles, spinning and weaving; there are also small-scale industries, such as tanneries and brick kilns. The agricultural areas, hand-woven clothes and household industries contribute to the economic growth of the city. Food-processing industries have developed since the late 1990s; at the district level, it is the foremost industrial segment. Industries involving rice-making, blue-jelly metal manufacturing and jem power generating are located {{on the outskirts of the}} city. The major <b>agricultural</b> <b>produce</b> in the region is paddy and cotton. Beedi production during the 1990s earned an annual revenue of 190billion and a foreign exchange of 8billion across the three districts of Tirunelveli, Tiruchirapalli and Vellore.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to argue the current {{approaches}} and its issues of confirming the food safety and its assurance on the <b>agricultural</b> <b>producing</b> and farm level. It is hard to introduce the production record for farmers without any incentives or enforcement by low on farm level. However，the improvement of livestock management could be an effective matter to introduce it. Based on the analysis of dairy milk recording data，the number of somatic cell of the groups that has high producing dairy　cows，is lower than that of low producing dairy cows. Reducing the number of the somatic cell is the result of increasing the milk yield. The milk pricing system of Hokuren Agricultural Cooperative makes milk farmers reduce the number of somatic cell in their milk. Adequate incentive system has been needed to introduce the food safety assurance system on <b>agricultural</b> <b>producing</b> areas and farm level. 2004 年度秋期大会シンポジウ...|$|R
