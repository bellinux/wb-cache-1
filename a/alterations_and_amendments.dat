50|$|Livingston was {{the leading}} member of a {{commission}} appointed to prepare a new civil code for Louisiana, which {{for the most part}} the legislature adopted in 1825; and the most important chapters of which, including all those on contracts, were prepared by Edward Livingston alone. Livingston became again a U.S. Representative, this time as the first person to serve Louisiana's 1st congressional district. The preliminary work for the preparation of a new civil code was completed by James Brown and Louis Moreau-Lislet, who in 1808 reported a Digest of the Civil Laws now in force in the Territory of Orleans with <b>Alterations</b> <b>and</b> <b>Amendments</b> adapted to the present Form of Government.|$|E
50|$|In December 1942, {{an accord}} between the U.S. American and French {{authorities}} foresaw, the {{one by one}} transfer of the 1500-ton submarines to the United States in order to modernize them, taking into consideration that their conception built has been then, almost twenty years old. The motors were integrally revised, the batteries changed, the thick hull and diving auxiliaries reinforced. Certain ballasts were also transformed to increase {{the autonomy of the}} boats. Grand efforts were made on soundproofing the submarines. The submarines were equipped with radar, underwater sound systems, more performing asdic, bathythermograph and featured other accessories. The living conditions were ameliorated with the installation of air conditioning and a refrigerator. The conning tower was modified, with a suppression of various navigational parts, replaced by a anti-aerial rail type. The last telescopic mats were definitely retired. L'Archimède (L'Archimède) left Dakar on February 8, 1943 and headed to Philadelphia, where the boat remained almost a year. Works began in the month of May at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. They were complicated by the absence of the boat's blue prints and piece assemblies schematics. In addition, out of the four 1500-ton submarines, each pair was equipped with different motor - an issue which irritated the American engineers. However, they were impressed by the modern fabrication of these boats whose concepts design were near twenty years old. The <b>alterations</b> <b>and</b> <b>amendments</b> of L'Archimède were completed on February 19, 1944, the boat was replaced in the American shipyard by the Le Glorieux until July, then Le Centaure from June 2 to December 18 and at last Le Casabianca from August 2, 1944 to March 30, 1945. The last two <b>alterations</b> <b>and</b> <b>amendments</b> were less pushed than the first. L'Argo (L'Argo), judged too tired for a complete alteration, was transferred to the American submarine schools for underwater sounds and passed over to another U.S.State.|$|E

50|$|FRIENDS AND FELLOW-CITIZENS: As a {{considerable}} uneasiness has arisen {{in the minds}} of some of the inhabitants of Philadelphia, from a fear that it was the desire of those citizens who agreed to the resolutions passed at the town meetings the 21st and 22d of October last, that the Representatives to be chosen on the 5th of this instant, for this city, should possess, not only the power to make the necessary alterations in the frame of government formed by the late Convention, but likewise to execute the same, we take this opportunity of declaring that, after the said Representatives have finished the <b>alterations</b> <b>and</b> <b>amendments</b> in the government, (agreeable to the method proposed in the 29th resolution passed at the town meeting of the 2nd of October,) it is our desire that they should issue writs for the election of an Assembly, and immediately afterwards dissolve themselves; and for this purpose we intend to instruct them, previous to their taking their seats in the House of Assembly.|$|E

Then a group of red-scarved children, members of the Ho Chi Minh Young Pioneer League, presented the members of the Presidium and the foreign delegates with flowers. That was followed by the opening speech held by Trường Chinh, the second-ranked member of the 4th Politburo. Trường asked the delegates and foreign representatives to observe a minute of silence for Ho Chi Minh, and for Central Committee members, for ordinary Party members who died during the war and any individual who had participated in the country's liberation and reconstruction process. He then turned to the tasks of the 5th National Congress, which would;"review the implementation of the lines set forth by the Fourth Congress, give a correct assessment of achievements and shortcomings, get a clear view of thepresent economic and social situation, analyse the causes of successes and difficulties, and work out orientations, objectives and tasks of the 1981-85 period and the eighties as a whole, the major guidelines and measures aimed at bringing into play favourable conditions, overcoming difficulties, correctly solving important and urgent problems concerning the building of socialism and the defence of the fatherland, burning questions related to production and the people's life, to the strengthening of party building work, so as to take our people's revolutionary cause continually and steadily forward, and make a worthy contribution to the revolutionary cause of the world's people, the congress will decide on a number of <b>alterations</b> <b>and</b> <b>amendments</b> to the Party's rules and elect a new Central Committee." ...|$|E

40|$|The moss genus Phascum {{is common}} in the Northern Hemisphere. Its species may be {{frequently}} encountered by botanists studying the moss flora of bare earth in fallow fields and gardens. Species within this genus have been recognised by taxonomists since at least 1741. The present form of the generic name dates from 1753. Yet Phascum still appears to be poorly understood. Even with available modern treatments, in floras such as Nyholm (1960) and Lawton (1971), bryologists {{find it difficult to}} recognise taxa and seem hesitant to name species. Why are these taxa difficult to identify? Is it because they are a complex of "good" but difficult to recognise species and varieties or a loose assemblage of intergrading forms and ecotypes? The present work attempts to answer the following questions: - 1. Is Phascum divisible into recognisable entities in the Northern Hemisphere? And, if it is divisible, what should the subunits be correctly called? 2. If the species Phascum cuspidatum Schreb. ex Hedw. is proved to be a valid taxon, is it possible to subdivide it into infraspecific units? And, if it is divisible, at what level should the subunits be recognised and what should they be correctly called? The problem was tackled in three phases. First, in order to cover the nomenclatural questions, using the Index Muscorum edited by Wijk (1967) as a starting point, all the relevant publications which contained citations of putative taxa or new combinations within the genus were assembled. From the information provided in these works a chronological survey of the taxonomy of the genus from 1770 to the present day was compiled (Chapter I). Hopefully this synopsis, of {{what turned out to be}} an extremely complex literature, will provide a reference point not only for this study but for any further researches in the genus in Europe and North America. <b>Alterations</b> <b>and</b> <b>amendments</b> to the information provided in the Index Yuscorun, together with other notes and comments, are incorporated in the survey where appropriate. Secondly, from these taxonomic publications, a list of the definitive characters used in the descriptions of the many putative taxa was compiled. This information was used to provide direction in a study of the taxonomic usefulness of these characters and thus the validity of the proposed taxa. This work, which included some growth experiments, was carried out within the eight fields of study suggested by Turrill (1942). Attention was paid to both traditional and more modern taxonomic methods, including computational techniques. An attempt was also made to fill the gaps in areas not covered by this work by reference to the specialised published literature within some of these eight fields (Chapter II). Thirdly, the genus Phascum is discussed in terms of both historical treatment and current practice concerning generic and specific concepts. And, finally, from the results of the studies carried out and with due reference to the literature and specimens seen the genus Phascum is redefined in terms of its component, taxa. These are thereafter typified and named, as far as possible at the present state of knowledge, in accordance with the International Code of Botanical nomenclature (I. C. B. N.) of 1972. An indication is provided of work which still remains to be carried out (Chapter III) ...|$|E
