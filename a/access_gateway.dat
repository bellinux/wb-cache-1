40|$|Proxy Mobile IPv 6 (PMIPv 6) is {{a network}} based {{mobility}} management protocol that enables IP mobility {{for a host}} without requiring its participation in any mobility-related signaling. PMIPv 6 requires all communications {{to go through the}} local mobility anchor. As this can be suboptimal, Localized Routing (LR) allows Mobile Nodes (MNs) attached to the same or different Mobile <b>Access</b> <b>Gateways</b> (MAGs) to route traffic by using localized forwarding or a direct tunnel between the gateways. This document proposes initiation, utilization, and termination mechanisms for localized routing between mobile <b>access</b> <b>gateways</b> within a proxy mobile IPv 6 domain. It defines two new signaling messages, Localized Routing Initiation (LRI) and Local Routing Acknowledgment (LRA), that are used to realize this mechanism. Status of This Memo This is an Internet Standards Track document. This document {{is a product of the}} Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). It represents the consensus of the IETF community.
