25|$|Now that they've quit Wellman Plastics, Roseanne and Jackie {{must find}} new jobs. Jackie decides {{to become a}} police officer. Roseanne cycles {{through a variety of}} menial jobs {{including}} telemarketer, secretary for Dan's boss, bartender, cashier at <b>a</b> <b>fast-food</b> <b>restaurant,</b> and, finally, sweeping floors at a beauty parlor. At home, Dan's poker buddy Arnie (Tom Arnold) makes a startling debut when he plants a passionate kiss on Roseanne. The Conners celebrate an outrageous Halloween that becomes an annual feature of the series. Roseanne wants 10 minutes to herself in the bathroom; this turns into a bizarre dream sequence which has the entire cast singing parodies of songs from musical comedies. Later, at Thanksgiving dinner, Dan takes wary notice of a growing romance between his father and Crystal. Jackie gets serious with new boyfriend Gary (Brian Kerwin). Becky repeatedly rebels against Roseanne and Dan's parental authority such as staying out late and breaking into the liquor cabinet with her friend Dana and getting drunk when Dan and Roseanne are out of town for the day. The reappearance of old biker buddy Ziggy (Jay O. Sanders) reminds Roseanne and Dan of their own rebellious past. Darlene first proves her talent for writing when she wins recognition for her poetry.

500|$|One {{particular}} market {{target that}} was {{of importance to}} the company was identified as the [...] "Superfan". The superfan was a demographic group that included individuals that are 18 to 49 years old, primarily male, who would visit <b>a</b> <b>fast-food</b> <b>restaurant</b> five times a month and eat fast food 16 times a month. Burger King and their competitors hope to attract this group {{because of the large}} sums of money that they represent; an increase in sales to this group could drive an increase in global sales. While superfans accounted for less than 20 percent of Burger King's customer base, they accounted for nearly 50 percent of the company's business. By focusing on this demographic group, the company could increase sales more readily; it was easier to generate more repeat visits by this demographic than it was to coax new customers to switch from other chains. The company has used advertising featuring its mascot, the Burger King, in tandem with new product rollouts such as its BK Wrapper product to help generate an increased number of visits by this client segment.|$|E
