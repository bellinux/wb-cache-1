5|$|As a tyrannosaurid, Albertosaurus was a bipedal {{predator}} with tiny, two-fingered {{hands and}} a massive head that had dozens of large, sharp teeth. It may {{have been at the}} top of the food chain in its local ecosystem. While Albertosaurus was large for a theropod, it was much smaller than its larger and more famous relative Tyrannosaurus rex, growing nine to ten meters long <b>and</b> <b>weighing</b> less than possibly 2 metric tons.|$|E
5|$|Schuur {{was born}} in Tacoma, Washington, two months {{premature}} <b>and</b> <b>weighing</b> less than three pounds. Complications of prematurity resulted in her total loss of vision. Her twin brother, David, had normal vision at birth but some hearing loss. She also has an older sister. Schuur grew up in Auburn, Washington, a southern suburb of Seattle. She attended the Washington School for the Blind in Vancouver from age four to eleven. She lived at school but was able to commute home 150miles on the train by herself. She later transferred to public school where teachers' aides helped her keep up in class.|$|E
5|$|Standing 6 feet 8 {{inches tall}} (2.03 m) <b>and</b> <b>weighing</b> 210 pounds (95kg), McGrady played as a {{shooting}} guard and small forward. His career averages were 19.6 points, 5.6 rebounds, and 4.4 assists per game. McGrady earned seven All-NBA honors (2001–05, 2007–08), seven All-Star selections (2001–07), two NBA scoring titles (2003–04), {{and won the}} NBA Most Improved Player Award in 2001.

5|$|The current match {{ball for}} the Copa Libertadores is the Total 90 Ascente Libertadores, {{manufactured}} by Nike. It {{is one of}} the many balls produced by the American sports equipment maker for CONMEBOL, replacing the Mercurial Veloci Hi-Vis in 2009. The ball, approved by FIFA <b>and</b> <b>weighing</b> approximately 422 g, has a spherical shape that allows the ball to fly faster, farther, and more accurately. According to Nike, the ball's geometric precision distributes pressure evenly across panels and around the ball. The compressed polyethylene layer stores energy from impact and releases it at launch, and the 6-wing carbon-latex air chamber improves acceleration.|$|E
5|$|The {{queen conch}} reaches sexual {{maturity}} at approximately 3 to 4 years of age, reaching a shell length of nearly 180mm <b>and</b> <b>weighing</b> up to 5 pounds. Individuals may usually {{live up to}} 7 years, though in deeper waters their lifespan may reach 20–30 years and maximum lifetime estimates reach 40 years. It is believed that the mortality rate tends to be lower in matured conchs due to their thickened shell, {{but it could be}} substantially higher for juveniles. Estimates have demonstrated that its mortality rate decreases as its size increases and can also vary due to habitat, season and other factors.|$|E
5|$|Built to Brigham Young's design, the handcarts {{resembled a}} large wheelbarrow, with two wheels five feet (1.5m) in {{diameter}} and a single axle {{four and a half}} feet (1.4m) wide, <b>and</b> <b>weighing</b> 60 pounds (27kg). Running along each side of the bed were seven-foot (2.1 m) pull shafts ending with a three-foot (0.9m) crossbar at the front. The crossbar allowed the carts to be pushed or pulled. Cargo was carried in a box about three feet by four feet (0.9m by 1.2m), with 8inch (0.2m) walls. The handcarts generally carried up to 250 pounds (110kg) of supplies and luggage, though they were capable of handling loads as heavy as 500 pounds (230kg). Carts used in the first year's migration were made entirely of wood ("Iowa hickory or oak"); in later years a stronger design was substituted, which included metal elements.|$|E
50|$|Male Pumis stand 41 to 47 cm at the withers <b>and</b> <b>weigh</b> 10 to 15 kg; bitches are 38 to 44 cm <b>and</b> <b>weigh</b> 8 to 13 kg.|$|R
50|$|Male Red-Tiger Bulldogs {{can reach}} heights of 22-26 inches <b>and</b> <b>weigh</b> between 75-115 pounds. Female Red-Tiger Bulldog can reach heights of 22-25 inches <b>and</b> <b>weigh</b> between 65-105 pounds.|$|R
50|$|Males {{had a mean}} {{body length}} of 248 cm <b>and</b> <b>weighed</b> between 100 <b>and</b> 141 kg. Females were smaller than males <b>and</b> <b>weighed</b> between 75 <b>and</b> 115 kg.|$|R
5|$|Fast {{transient}} response and low distortion are both characteristic of electrostatics. The driver, being only 0.00137-inch thick <b>and</b> <b>weighing</b> only 3mg, is thus capable of stopping and starting seemingly instantaneously with no damping {{necessary to the}} drive units. However, the design also limits bandwidth to between 40Hz and 10kHz. Kohli of TNT noted that upper register starts to taper above 10kHz and then falls off severely beyond 13kHz, and is 15-20dB down at 20kHz. The speaker's design makes them extremely directional, and the general practice is to toe in the speakers to point directly to the listener. Although a slight deviation {{did not seem to}} make a difference, it is in practice not possible for more than one person to enjoy a reasonably balanced sound stage with the ESL.|$|E
5|$|Field {{lacrosse}} involves two teams, each competing {{to shoot}} a lacrosse ball into the opposing team's goal. A lacrosse ball {{is made out of}} solid rubber, measuring 7.75 to 8inches (19.7–20cm) in circumference <b>and</b> <b>weighing</b> 5 to 5.25ounces (140–149g). Each team plays with ten players on the field: a goalkeeper; three defenders in the defensive end; three midfielders free to roam the whole field; and three attackers attempting to score goals in the offensive end. Players are required to wear some protective equipment, and must carry a lacrosse stick (or crosse) that meets specifications. Rules dictate the length of the game, boundaries, and allowable activity. Penalties are assessed by officials for any transgression of the rules.|$|E
5|$|Lying {{approximately}} 264 light-years (81 parsecs) {{away with}} an apparent magnitude of 4.39, HD 66141 is 6.8 {{billion years old}} and has evolved into an orange giant of spectral type K2III with a diameter around 22 {{times that of the}} Sun, <b>and</b> <b>weighing</b> 1.1 solar masses. It is 174 times as luminous as the Sun, with an absolute magnitude of −0.15. HD 66141 was mistakenly named 13 Puppis, as its celestial coordinates were recorded incorrectly when catalogued and hence mistakenly thought to be in the constellation of Puppis; Bode gave it the name Lambda Canis Minoris, which is now obsolete. The orange giant is orbited by a planet, HD 66141b, which was detected in 2012 by measuring the star's radial velocity. The planet has a mass around 6 times that of Jupiter and a period of 480 days.|$|E
50|$|The sexes {{are very}} {{different}} in size; the male is 50 cm long <b>and</b> <b>weighs</b> 520 g; the smaller female is 38 cm long <b>and</b> <b>weighs</b> 230 g.|$|R
5000|$|Bernedoodles {{range in}} size. Toy, miniature, and {{standard}} sized dogs are found, {{depending on what}} type of Poodle is used for breeding. The toy size will grow 10-14" [...] tall <b>and</b> <b>weigh</b> between 10-24 lbs. The miniature size will grow 15-20" [...] tall <b>and</b> <b>weigh</b> between 25-49 lbs.

50|$|Mature rams grow {{on average}} to 95 cm at the withers <b>and</b> <b>weigh</b> 75 kg. However, ewes grow to 85 cm at the withers <b>and</b> <b>weigh</b> 55 kg at maturity.|$|R
5|$|Sexual size {{dimorphism}} in {{this species}} {{is perhaps the}} greatest in any neognath bird. Males were considerably larger than females, measuring 90cm (35in) in length <b>and</b> <b>weighing</b> up to 28kg (62lb), whereas females were 70cm (28in) and weighed 17kg (37lb). This is only 60% {{of the weight of}} a mature male. Their weight may have varied substantially due to fat cycles, meaning that individuals were fat during cool seasons, but slim during hot seasons, and may have been as low as 21kg in males and 13kg in females. Though male pigeons are usually larger than females, there is no direct evidence for the largest specimens actually being the males of the species, and this has only been assumed based on early works. Though the male was probably largest, this can only be confirmed by molecular sexing techniques, and not skeletal morphology alone.|$|E
5|$|Standing at 6 feet 11 {{inches tall}} (2.11 m) <b>and</b> <b>weighing</b> 250 pounds (113kg), Duncan was a power forward who could also play center. With a double-double career average in points and rebounds, he was {{considered}} one of the most consistent players in the NBA throughout his career. Regarded as one of the league's best interior defenders, Duncan also ranked consistently as one of the top scorers, rebounders and shot-blockers in the league. At the end of his final season in 2015–16, he was ranked first in regular season point-rebound double-doubles among active players, while he led the charts in post-season point-rebound double-doubles (158 as of 2013–14). His main weakness for much of his career was his free throw shooting, with a career average of less than 70%.|$|E
5|$|The golden white-eye {{differs from}} the other {{white-eyes}} in having large eyes and an outermost primary wing feather that is not reduced (as {{it is in the}} other species). It is a large white-eye, 14cm (5.5in) long <b>and</b> <b>weighing</b> around 20g (0.7oz). The species has bright, unmistakable plumage, with: an orange-yellow head coupled with a pale eye-ring; a yellow-green back, wings, and tail; and golden orange undersides. The bill and legs are also orange. The plumage of both sexes is similar; the males can be told from the females only when examined in the hand, since the males have longer wings than the females. The juveniles have similar plumage, though duller than the adults', with brownish patches on the face and neck and brown-yellow streaks on the breast. Juveniles also have dusky bills and dull legs.|$|E
5000|$|Besides the chistera, {{the game}} {{can be played}} with an {{assortment}} of equipment, for example, the bare hand, a wooden bat or a wooden-framed strung racket called a [...] "xare". There are also different types of balls, for example, one is covered in leather <b>and</b> <b>weighs</b> 52 grams, another is covered in parchment <b>and</b> <b>weighs</b> 90 grams, while yet another is rubber <b>and</b> <b>weighs</b> 40 grams.|$|R

50|$|It {{is strange}} to recall now, {{in an age}} when {{competitive}} oarsmen average 6 ft in height <b>and</b> <b>weigh</b> 225 lbs, that Harry Clasper was only 5 ft tall <b>and</b> <b>weighed</b> only 130 lbs.|$|R
5|$|Standing at 6 feet 4 {{inches tall}} (1.93 m) <b>and</b> <b>weighing</b> 220 pounds (100kg), Wade is a {{shooting}} guard {{that is also}} capable of playing point guard as he did during his rookie season and in subsequent seasons with smaller lineups. On offense, he has established himself {{as one of the}} quickest and most difficult players to guard, as well {{as one of the best}} slashers in the NBA. Wade's signature one-two step allows him to dash past bigger defenders and occasionally get the extra foul shot. Wade is able to get to the free throw line consistently; he ranked first in free-throw attempts per 48minutes in 2004–05 and again in the 2006–07 season. He has proven himself an unselfish player, averaging 6.1 assists per game throughout his career. After winning the NBA Finals MVP Award in 2006, Wade developed a reputation as one of the premier clutch players in the NBA. He has gained a reputation for being capable of hitting game-winning baskets and potential game-winning free throws.|$|E
5|$|The current match {{ball for}} the Recopa Sudamericana, {{manufactured}} by Nike, is named the Total 90 Omni CSF. It {{is one of}} the many balls produced by the American sports equipment maker for CONMEBOL, replacing the Mercurial Veloci Hi-Vis in 2009. The ball, approved by FIFA <b>and</b> <b>weighing</b> approximately 422 g, has a spherical shape that allows the ball to fly faster, farther, and more accurately. According to Nike, the ball's geometric precision distributes pressure evenly across panels and around the ball. The compressed polyethylene layer stores energy from impact and releases it at launch, and the 6-wing carbon-latex air chamber improves acceleration. Another feature of the ball is its rubber layer; it was designed to allow a better response while retaining the impact energy and releases it in the coup. Its support material of cross-linked nitrogen-expanded foam improves its retention and durability of its shape. Polyester support fabric enhances structure and stability. The asymmetrical high-contrast graphic around the ball creates an optimal flicker as the ball rotates for a more powerful visual signal, allowing the player to more easily identify and track the ball.|$|E
5|$|The {{new arrival}} was a British ship sent from the Channel Fleet on a lone patrol: the frigate HMS Thames under Captain James Cotes. Thames {{was an old}} frigate, built in 1758 and {{carrying}} 32 12-pounder guns. The ship was below its standard complement of 215 men, sailing with only 184, which meant that the 6-pounder guns that augmented the main battery could not be manned. By comparison, Uranie {{was five years old}} and carried 40 18-pounder guns <b>and</b> <b>weighing</b> almost double the weight of the British ship. Her full complement was of 260 men, but she lacked 60 of her sailors, dispatched in prize crews over three captured ships, and was burdened with over 260 prisoners. At first unsure of the identity of the ship to the north, Tartu hoisted a blue flag as an identification signal and sent the Alcoudia away in case the ship should be revealed to be hostile. Cotes did not respond to the signal, and the two ships were soon hidden from one another by a rain squall.|$|E
