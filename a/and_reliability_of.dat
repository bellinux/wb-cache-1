5|$|A major {{stimulus}} {{to improving the}} accuracy <b>and</b> <b>reliability</b> <b>of</b> clocks was the importance of precise time-keeping for navigation. The position of a ship at sea could be determined with reasonable accuracy if a navigator could refer to a clock that lost or gained less than about 10 seconds per day. The marine chronometer would {{have to keep the}} time of a fixed location—usually Greenwich Mean Time—allowing seafarers to determine longitude by comparing the local high noon to the clock. This clock could not contain a pendulum, which would be virtually useless on a rocking ship.|$|E
5|$|In 1915, {{the first}} {{proposal}} was launched {{for using a}} bus service {{as an alternative to}} the train. This was rejected because buses were not able to give the comfort <b>and</b> <b>reliability</b> <b>of</b> a train. The idea was proposed again in 1922 by the director of the Norwegian Public Roads Administration. Among the strongest opponents to the bus alternative was Ingolf Elster Christensen, County Governor of Sogn og Fjordane and later parliamentarian, who stated that the Nordre Bergenhus County (today Sogn og Fjordane County Municipality) had paid part of the regional financing of the Bergen Line on condition that they receive a branch line to the Sognefjord.|$|E

Our method, {{which is based}} on Feller 2 ̆ 7 s run theory, is easy to implement, and leads to both recursive and non-recursive formulas for the reliability. The non-recursive expression is especially advantageous for systems with numerous components. We show how the method can be extended for computing generating functions <b>and</b> <b>reliabilities</b> <b>of</b> systems with multi-state components as well as systems with statistically dependent components. To make our theoretical derivations practical to practitioners, we include short computer programs that do the non-recursive computations yielding the <b>reliabilities</b> <b>of</b> such systems...|$|R
5|$|Richard Bowers' master's thesis (2012), updated to book form by Bowers and Moffett (2012), {{asserts that}} NVC has been absent from {{academic}} programs {{due to a}} lack of research into the theoretical basis for the model and lack of research on the reliability of positive results. Bowers' thesis meets the first objection through an analysis of existing theories which provide solid support for each element of the NVC (mediation) model. Without this theoretical understanding, it would not be clear what aspects of the NVC model make it work or even if it can be effectively applied by anyone other than Marshall Rosenberg. This theoretical analysis can provide a foundation for further empirical research on the effectiveness <b>and</b> <b>reliability</b> <b>of</b> the model.|$|E
5|$|Without fully {{endorsing}} the de Montesquiou explanation, Michael Coleman carefully examined the story and, in particular, the two published {{versions of the}} ladies' accounts (the earlier-written of which, from November 1901, had only previously {{been published in the}} second, small print-run, edition of An Adventure in 1913). Coleman concluded that the more widely available texts, as published in the 1911 and later editions, had been considerably embroidered well after the events described and after the ladies had begun their investigations, while the original accounts had little or nothing to suggest a supernatural experience. He also questioned the rigour <b>and</b> <b>reliability</b> <b>of</b> the ladies' subsequent researches, pointing out that few, if any, of their informants are named and that most of their literary and historical references were taken from unreliable sources.|$|E
5|$|In essence, the lbw law {{remained}} the same between 1839 and 1937, despite several campaigns to have it changed. An 1863 proposal to allow a batsman to be lbw if the ball hit his body at any point between the wickets, regardless of where the ball pitched or whether it would hit the wicket at all, came to nothing. There were few complaints until the proportion of lbw dismissals in county cricket began to increase during the 1880s. Until then, batsmen used their pads only to protect their legs; their use for any other purposes was considered unsporting, and some amateur cricketers did not wear them at all. As cricket became more organised and competitive, some batsmen began to use their pads as a second line of defence: they lined them up with the ball so that if they missed with the bat, the ball struck the pad instead of the wicket. Some players took this further; if the delivery {{was not an easy}} one from which to score runs, they attempted no shot and allowed the ball to bounce safely off their pads. Arthur Shrewsbury was the first prominent player to use such methods, and others followed. Criticism of this practice was heightened by the increased quality <b>and</b> <b>reliability</b> <b>of</b> cricket pitches, which made batting easier, led to higher scores and created a perceived imbalance in the game.|$|E

40|$|Convex hull area (CHA) {{and mean}} angle (MA) have been {{proposed}} to describe the behaviour of the helical axis during joint kinematics. This study investigates the intra- <b>and</b> inter-session <b>reliability</b> <b>of</b> CHA <b>and</b> MA during active movements of the cervical spine. Twenty-seven healthy volunteers (19 women) aged 23 ± 2. 8 years participated. Each volunteer was tested on two sessions. All participants were instructed to perform the following active movements of the cervical spine: rotation, flexion/extension and lateral bending, each performed to full range and repeated ten consecutive times. Cervical movements were registered with an electromagnetic tracking system. For each participant, each movement and each session, range of motion (ROM), CHA and MA were extracted. ROM showed high intra- <b>and</b> inter-session <b>reliability</b> during all cervical spine movements using this method. Overall, the intra- <b>and</b> inter-session <b>reliability</b> <b>of</b> the helical axis parameters varied depending on the movement direction and ranged from fair to almost perfect. The intra- <b>and</b> inter-session <b>reliability</b> <b>of</b> CHA <b>and</b> MA were almost perfect during rotation whereas the intra- <b>and</b> inter-session <b>reliability</b> <b>of</b> CHA was substantial during lateral bending and intra- <b>and</b> inter-session <b>reliability</b> <b>of</b> MA ranged from fair to substantial during flexion/extension and lateral bending. This is the first study to evaluate the <b>reliability</b> <b>of</b> helical axis measures during active movements of the cervical spine.

40|$|System {{identification}} <b>and</b> <b>reliability</b> evaluation play {{a significant}} role in structural health monitoring to ensure the serviceability and safety of existing structures. Although the development of system identification methods has attained much attention and some degree <b>of</b> maturity, <b>reliability</b> evaluation <b>of</b> existing structures still remains a challenging problem especially when uncertainties in measurement data and inherent randomness, which are inevitably involved in civil structures, are considered. In this regard, this paper presents a framework for integrated system identification <b>and</b> <b>reliability</b> evaluation <b>of</b> stochastic building structures. Two algorithms are proposed to respectively evaluate component <b>reliability</b> <b>and</b> system <b>reliability</b> <b>of</b> stochastic building structures by combining a statistical moment-based system identification method and a probability density evolution equation-based reliability evaluation method.
