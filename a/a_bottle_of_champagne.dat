5|$|Following the {{extension}} of the Metropolitan Railway to Ruislip, and the resulting influx of visitors to the area, Albert Cross built a bungalow from where teas were served to day-trippers. This became a success and Cross had the building expanded, which soon became the Orchard Hotel. Between 1933 and 1971 it became an Ansells licensed bar and well known high class restaurant. It then became a Beefeater steak house, which it remains, and was recently extended with a Premier Inn hotel. During the Battle of Britain, the Orchard was very popular with the pilots of No. 303 Polish Fighter Squadron stationed at RAF Northolt, who celebrated many of their successes in battle there. The owner was known to open <b>a</b> <b>bottle</b> <b>of</b> <b>champagne</b> for each German aircraft shot down by the squadron.|$|E
5|$|The {{contract}} for Hiei {{was awarded to}} Milford Haven Shipbuilding and Engineering Co. in Pembroke Dock, Wales, on 24 September 1875 {{for the price of}} £119,600, exclusive of armament. Japanese sources universally give the date for Hieis keel-laying as 24 September 1875—the same as that for the awarding of the contract—but historian Hans Langerer describes this as improbable, arguing that no shipyard would order enough material to begin construction without cash in hand. She was launched on 12 June 1877; Reed's daughter smashed <b>a</b> <b>bottle</b> <b>of</b> <b>champagne</b> on the ship's bow in the traditional Western style. The ship was named for Mount Hiei. Completed in February 1878, Hiei sailed for Japan on 22 March under the command of a British captain and with a British crew because the IJN was not yet ready for such a long voyage. One of the passengers aboard her was the future admiral Togo Heihachiro, who had just completed six years of study in the United Kingdom. She arrived in Yokohama on 22 May and was assigned to the Tokai Naval District a month later. On 10 July a formal ceremony was held in Yokohama for the receipt of the ship that was attended by the Meiji Emperor and many senior government officials. The ship was opened for tours by the nobility, their families and invited guests for three days after the ceremony. On 14 July, the general public was allowed to tour the ship for a week.|$|E

25|$|Designers Bruno and Franz Steffen piloted the {{aircraft}} themselves {{on its first}} test flight on 24 May 1915. They ended this flight prematurely because of overheating in the gearboxes, and subsequent tests revealed other defects such as excessive vibration in the drive system. With these problems addressed, the R.I was ready for its Idflieg acceptance flights in June 1915. Bruno Steffen ferried the three-person inspection team, plus a number of passengers, from Neumünster to Döberitz. He had even placed two armchairs and <b>a</b> <b>bottle</b> <b>of</b> <b>champagne</b> in the cabin for the occasion. The R.I reached Döberitz safely and made around twenty-four test flights before it was accepted by the military on 26 July 1915.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, former Miss Virginia USA Tai Collins {{claimed to}} have {{had an affair with}} Robb seven years earlier, {{although}} her allegations were never corroborated and she offered no proof of the affair to reporters.

Soon after making the allegations, Collins earned an undisclosed amount for posing nude for Playboy magazine. There were also rumors that during the time he was governor, Robb was present at parties in Virginia Beach where cocaine was used. These rumors were never proven, despite intense investigation by reporters and political operatives. He strongly denied this when the issue was raised during his 1988 campaign for the U.S. Senate. Robb so vehemently denied the cocaine allegation that he {{claimed to have}} never seen cocaine.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} bout was {{the last}} match in the Terri Invitational Tournament, contested between The New Brood (Matt Hardy and Jeff Hardy) and Edge and Christian in a tag team ladder match. For the match, a bag with 100,000 dollars was hung from the ceiling, and {{the goal of the}} match was to use one of the two ladders in the ring to climb and retrieve the bag. The first team to retrieve the bag would win the match. The manager of The New Brood, Gangrel brought a ladder to the ring, but as a result, he got ejected from ringside by the referee. During the match, the ladders were set up so that one was on top of the other, resembling a Seesaw, Jeff jumped on one side so that the other side jutted upwards, knocking down both Matt and Christian. Later in the match, all four men were on the ladders and after Edge pushed Matt off of the ladder they were both on, he fell into the other ladder, knocking Christian to the mat. Jeff however, jumped onto the other ladder to continue to battle with Edge. As Jeff and Edge climbed the ladder, Jeff pushed Edge to the ground and grabbed the bag of money to win the match. As a result of winning the match, The New Brood won $100,000 and the managerial services of Terri Runnels. Backstage, the trio celebrated the win and their new partnership with <b>a</b> <b>bottle</b> <b>of</b> <b>champagne.</b>|$|E

[...] His {{generosity}} to individual persons and causes, especially Catholic causes, extended to small gestures; after his libel-court victory over Nancy Spain, he sent her <b>a</b> <b>bottle</b> <b>of</b> <b>champagne.</b> Hastings said that Waugh's outward personal belligerence to strangers was not entirely serious but an attempt at [...] "finding a sparring partner worthy of his own wit and ingenuity". Besides mocking others, Waugh mocked himself—the elderly buffer, [...] "crusty colonel" [...] image, which he presented in later life, was a comic impersonation, and not his true self.|$|E

On another, while accompanying his secretary Angela Barry, he crash-landed the helicopter in a field, and walked to the nearest farmhouse, demanding to use the phone while leaving mud everywhere. He became known for his dark sense of humour; on one occasion he allowed a young woman to ride a rubber dinghy {{into the middle of the}} lake at Ickworth and then shot at it with an air rifle, sinking it.

500|$|In the 90-minute, one-act play, lawyer Amir Kapoor and {{his wife}} Emily host an Upper East Side dinner. Amir is an American-born, Muslim-raised Manhattan mergers and {{acquisitions}} lawyer, while Emily is an up-and-coming artist who focuses on Islamic themes in her art. Amir has cast aside his Muslim heritage {{for the sake of}} his career and serves as Emily's muse, who has an affinity for Islamic artistic traditions. Prior to the dinner, Amir, who is on the partner track, becomes involved in a controversial case. Amir's assimilated nephew, Abe (born Hussein Malik), has concerns regarding the propriety of the arrest of a local imam who is imprisoned on charges that may be trumped-up of financing terrorist-supporting groups, leading Amir to question whether it is religious persecution. Emily encourages the reluctant Amir to appear in court in support of the imam, in an unofficial capacity that gets mentioned in The New York Times. The case becomes dinner conversation when he hosts Jory, a colleague from work, and her husband, Isaac, who is Emily's Jewish art dealer. In all, the dinner table assembly includes an ex-Muslim, an African-American, a Jew and a WASP dining over the topic of religious faith. The conversation touches upon [...] "Islamic and Judaic tradition, the Quran and the Talmud, racial profiling and September 11 and the Taliban and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Benjamin Netanyahu" [...] as tensions mount. When Amir admits he felt a [...] "blush of pride" [...] on September 11th, and holds secret animosity toward Israel, his friends are disgusted. Jory and Amir leave the apartment to get <b>a</b> <b>bottle</b> <b>of</b> <b>champagne.</b> It is revealed that Isaac and Emily have had an affair in the past, and that he is secretly in love with her. Jory and Amir return just as Isaac is about to kiss Emily. It is revealed that Jory has been selected as partner in the law firm over Amir, in part because of his presence at the imam's trial, and in a rage he calls her [...] "nigger". Jory and Isaac depart, the status of their relationship uncertain after Isaac's infidelity has been revealed. Emily confesses her affair with Isaac and Amir beats her. Abe stumbles into the apartment and finds him standing over her. The play jumps ahead a period of time. Amir is packing his belongings and preparing to leave the apartment. Emily brings Abe over for legal advice. He was questioned by the FBI after his friend expressed a Jihadist sentiment at a Starbucks. Amir warns Abe to be more cautious, but Abe flies into a fit of rage, saying that the West has [...] "disgraced" [...] Islam, but that they will take it all back one day. He storms out. Amir tries to reconcile with Emily, but she leaves.|$|E
