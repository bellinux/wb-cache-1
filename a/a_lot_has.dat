25|$|Brothers & Sisters was renewed for a fifth {{season on}} March 5, 2010. It premiered on September 26, 2010 on ABC. The {{events of the}} fifth season begin {{one year after the}} season 4 finale. Rebecca {{divorced}} Justin and was written out of the show early in the fifth season. <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>has</b> changed for both the characters, and the show's viewers in the final season. The show lost two cast members: Rebecca Harper (Emily VanCamp) and Robert McCallister (Rob Lowe). These two losses were not the only major changes that occurred in season five. The Ojai Foods building, the Walker's family business, is not seen in the final season and many locations are different than in the last season. Kitty no longer lives at the ranch in Santa Barbara, but has moved into a smaller house with her son, Evan, after a short stay at a cottage in Ojai. Kevin and Scotty moved out of their apartment and into a different one which is located above Cafe 429 (the restaurant that Scotty and Saul opened). Cafe 429, and Nora's new workplace – the radio station, are two primary locations where many scenes take place in season five. One location that the audience does not see as much is Nora's house. For four seasons, the family home has been the location where most scenes were shot. That said, all of these changes have been made to fit in with the characters' new lives and chapters.|$|E

2500|$|Kinney {{said that}} there are lyrics on the album that deal with {{original}} vocalist Layne Staley. He elaborated, [...] "There's not a day that goes by that I don't think of him. And there's a lot to address, with all of that stuff coming to the forefront. <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>has</b> happened since 1995; <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>has</b> happened in our lives and we've never talked about it or discussed it publicly. So some of that is what's addressed here. That's the way we operate, it's about what really happened in life. We're not really the fast cars and chicks songs. It's basically what's happened in life, but <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>has</b> happened since the last record. And it's on this record." [...] The title track, [...] "Black Gives Way to Blue", was written as a tribute to Staley. Regarding the lyrics to other specific songs, Cantrell said the first single from the album, [...] "A Looking in View", [...] "basically speaks to any number of things that keep you balled up inside." [...] The second single, [...] "Check My Brain", features lyrics dealing with Cantrell's move from Seattle to Los Angeles in 2003. The third single, [...] "Your Decision", contains lyrics about [...] "surviving pain and choosing to live." [...] Cantrell also denied a popular misconception that the song [...] "Private Hell" [...] is about Layne Staley. He stated that the song is in fact about himself breaking up with a girl that he loved a lot and he [...] "wasn't man enough to go through with it". But Cantrell also pointed out that there's {{a lot of things in}} the song that aren't specifically about that and other people can relate to.|$|E

Producer Cathy Elliot said, [...] "It's a {{very sensitive}} issue and of course it's terrible for the parents to have the whole thing brought up.

In an article for bitgamer, Joe Martin gave a conflicting impression, noting that with regard to combat, [...] "not <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>has</b> changed".|$|E
2500|$|The actual {{reason for}} the delay {{turned out to be}} on the {{production}} side. Gran Turismo 5 missed its production window by three days. Kazunori Yamauchi publicly apologized via his Twitter account and explained that with such a complex game, <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>has</b> to be ironed out. He finished his Tweet with, [...] "Wait a little longer". It was later claimed by a Blu-ray forum moderator that the delay was due to Sony's decision to release the game under the newer 3.50 SDK firmware standard (to combat piracy), rather than 3.41 as originally intended. While at the Specialty Equipment Market Association Show on November 2, 2010, Yamauchi confirmed to automotive blog Jalopnik that GT5 had entered final production for release.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Educators {{around the}} world are experimenting with the {{possibilities}} virtual three dimensional worlds have for education and learning how to use these new environments efficiently. Virtual worlds have the potential to bring some new added value to education and educators can use them to create something that is not possible to do or show in traditional classrooms. Although <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>have</b> been learned about virtual worlds and their potential, <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more <b>has</b> to be learned before virtual worlds can become an integrated part of education on various levels.

[...] In 1936 or 1937 Bacon moved from 71 Royal Hospital Road to the top floor of 1 Glebe Place, Chelsea, which Eric Hall had rented. The following year, Patrick White moved to the top two floors of the building where de Maistre had his studio, on Eccleston Street and commissioned from Bacon, by now a friend, a writing desk (with wide drawers and a red linoleum top). Expressing one of his basic concerns from the late 1930s, Bacon stated that his artistic career was delayed because he spent too long looking for subject matter that could sustain his interest.|$|E
2500|$|The Hindi version {{received}} notably mixed responses, {{with most}} of the reviewers criticising Swanand Kirkire's lyrics. Bollywood Hungama rated the album 1.5 out of 5 saying, [...] "Robot disappoints. While Rahman himself hasn't come up with anything exceptional, something which is expected from him film after film; it's the lyrics that are chief culprit here. It is clear that <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>has</b> been lost in translation here, literally so, as the song dubbing Tamil to Hindi just doesn't work here." [...] Glamsham published a positive review saying, [...] "Robot is stylishly packed sci-fi musical entertainer, exuding out multifaceted classy acts from the maestro. Its herculean effort to compile and compose a set of situational soundtracks with that extra trendy grace and poise but Robot delivers all with style, thanks to A.R Rahman's ever-reliable expertise." [...] Rediff rated the Hindi version 2.5 on 5 and commented that Robot is not Rahman's best, to say the least. The Times of India commented that [...] "On the whole, the music of Robot does not appeal. They may suit the script of the sci-film, but the audio is not impressive." ...|$|E
2500|$|The show {{opened to}} highly {{positive}} reviews. Several media organizations praised Aamir Khan for his effort {{and described the}} show as a movement.

The amount of research Aamir and his team has put into the show was clearly visible with the facts and figures presented. Every aspect of the issue was covered with great diligence." [...] She concluded it by saying, [...] "'Satyamev Jayate' {{is not just a}} show; it’s a movement to change people’s mindset." [...] Parmita Uniyal from Hindustan Times praised the content and format of the show and said, [...] "Aamir Khan have to step in to do what journalists are supposed to do– make a difference. The show {{is a classic example of}} that." [...] Gayatri Sankar from Zee News described the show as an [...] "eye opener" [...] and commented that, [...] "Satyamev Jayate will make you unlearn all the wrong you have learnt and discover that compassionate human your soul wishes to be. The show grips you and leaves you dumfounded! You will be left asking for more and would wish the show never ends."

[...] Neeraj Roy, managing director and chief executive of Hungama Digital Media Entertainment, also praised the show by commending [...] "Brilliant effort. Well done Aamir Khan and Satyamev Jayate. We can make a difference." [...] Sukanya Verma from Rediff.com expressed concerns regarding the show saying, [...] "This is a grand initiative and a sound format into which <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>has</b> been invested -- monetarily as well as in terms of research. Deriding this show simply because it is hosted by a Bollywood actor who is also a marketing whiz, questions our credibility, not his." ...|$|E
