40|$|A {{real-time}} PCR assay for {{the measurement}} of gamma interferon (IFN-γ) mRNA in European badger (Meles meles) blood cultures was developed. The levels of IFN-γ mRNA in blood cultures stimulated with either bovine or <b>avian</b> <b>tuberculin</b> or specific mycobacterial antigens were compared with those in a nonstimulated control blood culture {{as the basis for}} determining the tuberculosis (TB) status of live badgers. The assay was validated by testing 247 animals for which there were matching data from postmortem examination and culture of tissues. Relative changes in the levels of IFN-γ mRNA in response to bovine tuberculin and specific antigens were found to be greater among badgers with tissues positive for TB on culture. The test was at its most accurate (87 % of test results were correct) by using blood cultures containing bovine tuberculin as the antigen and when the response to <b>avian</b> <b>tuberculin</b> was taken into account by subtracting the <b>avian</b> <b>tuberculin</b> response from the bovine tuberculin response. At a specificity of 90. 7 %, the test was 70. 6 % sensitive. At the same specificity, the current serological enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for TB in badgers was only 53 % sensitive. This work demonstrates that measurement of IFN-γ mRNA by real-time PCR is a valid method for the detection of TB in live badgers and may provide an alternative to the current serological methods of diagnosis, the Brock test. The testing procedure can be completed within 5 h of receipt of the blood culture samples. In addition, the use of a molecular biology-based test offers the potential to fully automate the testing procedure through the use of robotics...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} paratuberculosis in {{an isolated}} breeding herd of 25 high-yield dairy cows of the Red Holstein breed. The animals were examined clinically and then given the test for ldelayed type hypersensitivity and their blood serum was examined {{for the presence of}} specific antibodies against Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (Map). The clinical examination revealed that two cows exhibited symptoms of the disease that indicated an advanced stage of paratuberculosis. The following parameters were examined in the blood of the cows that showed clinical signs of the disease: leukocytes and erythrocytes count, concentrations of total proteins, albumin, iron, sodium, potassium, and activity of creatine kinase. The analysis of the red blood cell count revealed certain digressions that indicated the existence of hypochromic microcytic anaemia. The number of leukocytes was within the physiological values, but the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio was disrupted and stood at almost 1 : 1. The results of the biochemical analyses of the blood serum of diseased cows indicated hypoproteinaemia, hypoalbuminaemia, hypoferremia, hyposodiumaemia, hypokalemia, and increased activities of creatine kinase enzymes. A suspect reaction on the site of application of <b>avian</b> <b>tuberculin</b> was determined in two animals. Animals with clinical signs of the disease reacted negative to the test of delayed type hypersensitivity. The presence of specific antibodies against the cause of paratuberculosis was proven in four animals (16 %), including two animals with clinical signs of the disease and one that had a suspect reaction on the site of application of <b>avian</b> <b>tuberculin.</b> Furthermore, one animal that died exhibited macroscopic and microscopic changes regarding the intensity and distribution of lesions, the type of cellular infiltrate, and the number of present acidresistent bacteria, and the changes were characterized as diffuse changes of multibacillary type.

40|$|Background: A high {{proportion}} of pigs imported to Serbia from a Lithuanian breeding herd reacted positively against <b>avian</b> and/or bovine <b>tuberculin.</b> The pigs were euthanized and lesions characteristic for mycobacterial infection were detected. An investigation of potential mycobacteriosis in the pigs imported to Serbia and the possible source of infection in the Lithuanian herd were therefore initialised. Results: Formalin fixed, paraffin embedded lymph nodes from tuberculin positive animals were examined by realtime PCR for IS 1245 and IS 6110. IS 1245 was detected in 55 % and IS 6110 in 11 % of the samples. Seven of the ten IS 6110 positive samples were positive for IS 1245. Eleven lymph nodes from 10 pigs and 15 environmental samples were collected from the Lithuanian breeding herd and cultured for mycobacteria.

40|$|BACKGROUND : Bovine {{tuberculosis}} (bTB) is {{a chronic}} debilitating disease {{and is a}} cause {{of morbidity and mortality}} in livestock, wildlife and humans. This study estimated the prevalence and risk factors associated with bovine tuberculosis transmission in indigenous cattle at the human-animal interface in the Serengeti ecosystem of Tanzania. RESULTS : A total of 1, 103 indigenous cattle from 32 herds were investigated for the presence of bTB using the Single Intradermal Comparative Tuberculin Test. Epidemiological data on herd structure, management and grazing system were also collected. The apparent individual animal prevalence of tuberculin reactors was 2. 4 % (95 % confidence interval (CI), 1. 7 – 3. 5 %), whereas the true prevalence was 0. 6 % CI, 0. 6 – 0. 7 % as indicated by a reaction to <b>avian</b> <b>tuberculin</b> purified protein derivatives (PPD) which is more than 4 mm greater than the reaction to <b>avian</b> <b>tuberculin</b> PPD. The results showed that 10. 6 % (117 / 1, 103) showed non-specific reactions (atypical mycobacterium). The herd prevalence of 50 % (16 / 32) was found. Tuberculin skin test results were found to be significantly associated with age, location, size of the household and animal tested. Of 108 respondents, 70 (64. 8 %) individuals had not heard about bovine tuberculosis at all. Thirty five percent (38 / 108) of respondents at least were aware of bTB. About 60 % (23 / 38) of respondents who were aware of bTB had some knowledge on how bTB is spread. Eighty one percent (87 / 108) of respondents were not aware of the presence of bTB in wildlife. There is regular contact between cattle and wild animals due to sharing of grazing land and water sources, with 99 % (107 / 108) of households grazing cattle in communal pastures. CONCLUSION : The study has demonstrated a high reported interaction of livestock with wildlife and poor knowledge of most cattle owners concerning bTB and its transmission pathways among people, livestock and wildlife. Although the overall proportion of animals with bTB is relatively low, herd prevalence is 50 % and prevalence within herds varied considerably. Thus there is a possibility of cross transmission of bTB at wildlife-livestock interface areas that necessitates use of genetic strain typing methods to characterize them accurately.

40|$|A {{sensitive}} two-step simultaneous {{enzyme immunoassay}} (EIA) for human gamma interferon (IFN-γ) {{has been developed}} and used as an in vitro test for human tuberculosis (TB) in comparison with tuberculin skin testing. The EIA was shown to be highly sensitive, detecting less than 0. 5 IU of recombinant human IFN-γ per ml within a linear detection range of 0. 5 to 150 IU/ml. The assay was highly reproducible and specific for native IFN-γ. In addition, the assay detected chimpanzee, orangutan, gibbon, and squirrel monkey IFN-γs. Cross-reactions with other human cytokines or with IFN-γs derived from mice, cattle, or Old World monkeys were not evident. The assay was used to detect TB infection by incubating whole blood overnight with human, <b>avian,</b> and bovine <b>tuberculin</b> purified protein derivatives (PPDs), as well as positive (mitogen) - and negative-control preparations. The levels of IFN-γ in plasma supernatants were then determined. Blood from 10 tuberculin skin test-positive individuals responded predominantly to the human tuberculin PPD antigen {{and to a lesser}} extent to bovine and avian PPD antigens. By contrast, blood from 10 skin test-negative individuals showed minimal responses or no response to any of the tuberculin PPDs. Detectable levels of IFN-γ were present in all blood samples stimulated with mitogen. In vivo tuberculin reactivity was correlated with IFN-γ responsiveness in vitro.

40|$|Abstract Background Most {{countries}} {{carrying out}} campaigns of bovine tuberculosis (TB) eradication impose {{a ban on}} the use of mycobacterial vaccines in cattle. However, vaccination against paratuberculosis (PTB) in goats is often allowed even when its effect on TB diagnosis has not been fully evaluated. To address this issue, goat kids previously vaccinated against PTB were experimentally infected with TB. Results Evaluation of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) secretion induced by <b>avian</b> and bovine <b>tuberculins</b> (PPD) showed a predominant avian PPD-biased response in the vaccinated group from week 4 post-vaccination onward. Although 60 % of the animals were bovine reactors at week 14, avian PPD-biased responses returned at week 16. After challenge with M. caprae, the IFN-γ responses radically changed to show predominant bovine PPD-biased responses from week 18 onward. In addition, cross-reactions with bovine PPD that had been observed in the vaccinated group at week 14 were reduced when using the M. tuberculosis complex-specific antigens ESAT- 6 /CFP- 10 and Rv 3615 c as new DIVA (differentiation of infected and vaccinated animals) reagents, which further maintained sensitivity post-challenge. Ninety percent of the animals reacted positively to the tuberculin cervical comparative intradermal test performed at 12 weeks post-infection. Furthermore, post-mortem analysis showed reductions in tuberculous lesions and bacterial burden in some vaccinated animals, particularly expressed in terms of the degree of extrapulmonary dissemination of TB infection. Conclusions Our results suggest a degree of interference of PTB vaccination with current TB diagnostics that can be fully mitigated when using new DIVA reagents. A partial protective effect associated with vaccination was also observed in some vaccinated animals. </p...|$|R

A 60 -based ELISA and cutaneous tests have been used, {{in conjunction with the}} PPD-based skin reaction, in a control group of healthy animals, and in a herd including tuberculous animals. Cutaneous testing with A 60 yielded results comparable with those with PPD: both were negative with control cattle and positive with infected animals. Moreover, comparative cutaneous testing with <b>avian</b> <b>tuberculin</b> yielded similar results with PPD and A 60. When animals from the infected herd were tested with both avian and bovine sensitins, 54 % of cattle were diagnosed as fully positive, 26 % suspect, and 20 % negative.

40|$|Several {{changes in}} amino acid levels occur during an infection. As a rule, glycine, taurine and serine levels {{diminish}} considerably, while cysteine levels increase. Such changes {{may be attributed}} to the intense consumption of sulfur amino acids (SAA- methionine+cysteine) during infectious challenge. Methionine {{plays an important role in}} humoral and cellular immune responses. It has been suggested that such effect is exerted by intracellular glutathione and cysteine levels. Four-hundred thirty-two day-old Ross male broiler chickens were fed (from 1 to 42 days of age) three SAA levels in the diet (0. 72, 0. 82, and 0. 92 % from 1 to 21 days of age; 0. 65, 0. 75, and 0. 85 % from 22 to 42 days of age) and submitted to two immunological stimulus series.

40|$|International audienceIreland {{currently}} obtains its <b>avian</b> and bovine <b>tuberculin</b> purified protein derivatives (PPDs) from {{a single}} source. Because problems of supply or quality cannot be discounted, it is prudent that Ireland identify alternative supplier(s) {{as part of a}} broad risk management strategy. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} compare the performance of a number of different tuberculin combinations (that is, pairings of bovine and avian PPD; with different manufacturers) in the single intradermal comparative tuberculin test (SICTT), as currently performed in Ireland. The study was randomised, controlled and double-blinded. A total of 2, 172 cattle were used in the study. Each animal was tested using two SICTTs, the first based on the tuberculin combination in current use, and the second using one of six trial tuberculin combinations. Analyses were conducted to compare both reactor-status and skin increase. For each control/trial tuberculin combination, there was good agreement between the control and trial reactor-status. Differences in skin increases were mainly confined to animals categorised as either negative or severe inconclusive. However, the measured differences were minor, and unlikely to have a significant impact on the actual test outcome, either for individual animals or for herds. In conclusion, while further studies determining sensitivity and specificity in Ireland would have to be done in the event of a change in tuberculin PPD there should be minimal disruption of the national programme if alternative tuberculin PPDs meeting WHO, OIE and EU regulations were used. In this study, the precision of the guinea pig bio-assay to assess tuberculin potency was low and therefore Ireland should maintain its practice of periodically assessing potency in naturally infected cattle, even though this is not currently required under WHO, OIE or EU Regulations...|$|R

To overcome this drawback, new possibilities to detect Mycobacterium bovis infected cattle in paratuberculosis vaccinated animals were studied under experimental conditions. Three groups of 5 calves each {{were included in the}} experiment: one paratuberculosis vaccinated group, one paratuberculosis vaccinated and M. bovis infected group and one M. bovis infected group. The performance of the IFN-gamma release assay (IGRA) and the skin test using conventional <b>avian</b> and bovine <b>tuberculins</b> (A- and B-PPD) but also other more specific antigens (ESAT- 6 /CFP 10 and Rv 3615 c) was studied under official and new diagnostic criteria. Regarding the IGRA of vaccinated groups, when A- and B-PPD were used the sensitivity reached 100 % at the first post-challenge sampling, dropping down to 40 - 80 % in subsequent samplings. The sensitivity for the specific antigens was 80 - 100 % and the specificity was also improved. After adapting the diagnostic criteria for the conventional antigens in the skin test, the ability to differentiate between M. bovis infected and non-infected animals included in paratuberculosis vaccinated groups was enhanced. Taking for positive a relative skin thickness increase of at least 100 %, the single intradermal test specificity and sensitivity yielded 100 %. The comparative intradermal test was equally accurate considering a B-PPD relative skin increase of at least 100 % and {{greater than or equal to}} that produced by A-PPD. Using the specific antigens as a proteic cocktail, the specificity and sensitivity reached 100 % considering the new relative and absolute cut-offs in all experimental groups (Δ≥ 30 % and Δmm ≥ 2, respectively). Results suggest that the interference caused by paratuberculosis vaccination in cattle could be completely overcome by applying new approaches to the official tuberculosis diagnostic tests...|$|R

Vaccines against Marek’s disease, fowl pox, infectious bronchitis, Freund’s Complete Adjuvant, Sheep red blood cells (SRBC), and <b>avian</b> <b>tuberculin</b> were administered to one group as immunological stimuli; the other group did not receive any stimulus. The experiment was carried out with 432 one-day-old male Ross broilers, distributed into 12 treatments with 6 replicates of 6 birds each. Performance data were weekly collected Anti-SRBC antibodies were collected by hemagglutination test and cell immune response (CIR) was measured by tubercularization reaction in one wattle 24 hours after administration of the second tuberculin injection at 42 days of age. The weight difference between the two wattles of each bird (one injected with tuberculin and the other not) was the measure of CIR. Arginine levels did not influence either bird performance or immune response. Methionine concentrations higher or lower than usually adopted in broiler production (0. 51 and 0. 49 %) equally failed to influence the birds’ immune humoral response, but the best CIR was observed at the intermediate methionine level.

40|$|The ‘Singleton Protocol ’ {{was adopted}} by the Irish Department of Agriculture Fisheries and Food (DAFF) in 1996 to address the {{incomplete}} specificity of the single intra-dermal comparative tuberculin test (SICTT) used in Ireland for the detection of animals infected with bovine tuberculosis (bTB). The protocol allows the early restoration of disease-free status to herds with a single reactor breakdown, where the herd was not confirmed as infected withMycobacterium bovis by epidemiological investigation, by postmortem examination or by further test. The current study examines the ability of the Singleton Protocol to identify false-positive reactors. It investigates the subsequent herd-reactor rate following single reactor removal and analyses the factors leading to a positive postmortem lesion outcome and a positive reactor retest result. Postmortem lesion results were obtained for 371 reactor animals from single reactor breakdowns that were killed at an export meat plant over a 19 -month period. Epidemiological and test data for these animals and their herds were obtained from DAFF databases and analysed by univariate and multivariate statistical analysis. Singleton candidates had an 18. 7 per cent lower lesion rate than single animal breakdowns not meeting the singleton criteria. No significant difference was found between Singletons and non singletons in the subsequent reactor retest results. Skin thickness at the SICTT is the most significant determinant of a positive lesion result. The area bTB history was shown to be a significant variable in producing a positive reactor retest result. BOVINE tuberculosis (bTB) is a zoonotic disease of cattle caused by Mycobacterium bovis.

40|$|Objective/Background: Bovine {{tuberculosis}} (BTb) {{is mainly}} {{a disease of}} cattle, although it continues to infect human populations across the world. Operation of a test and slaughter plan in Iran since 1981 has lowered the frequency of BTb from > 5 % to < 0. 14 % at the national scale. In 2015, unusual uncontrollable epidemics of BTb were detected in two cattle farms in municipal suburbs of Qazvin and Isfahan. These farms had a tuberculin-test-certified record of BTb-free status for the past 5 consecutive years, with no new cattle registered with {{either of the two}} herds during this time period. Routine tuberculination of the bovids in 2015 resulted in the detection of tuberculin-positive animals that were subsequently removed from the herds. Serial tuberculin tests improved the situation, as new reactors were found each time. The aim of this research is based on isolation and identification of Mycobacterium from infected animals in both farms. Methods: To investigate the situation, major mesenteric/mediastinal lymph nodes from the culled reactor animals along with specimens from bulk milk tanks, trapped rats living on the farms, and environmental specimens were collected and subjected to bacterial culture. Tuberculin-positive cattle were also subjected to paratuberculosis enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), ESAT- 6 ELISA, and gamma-interferon tests. Results: In bacterial culture, Mycobacterium bovis, Mycobacterium microti, and Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis were isolated from collected specimens at both farms. Conclusion: There is circumstantial evidence supported by previous studies to expect a high frequency of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis infection in Iranian cattle/sheep farms. This observation might explain the large skin reaction size seen at the <b>avian</b> <b>tuberculin</b> injection site in tested animals in these farms. Introduction of a third infection with M. microti, possibly by rodents visiting the farms, might have triggered immunological reactions that have ended the surge of BTb. If correct, we assume that a technical review of the Iranian test and slaughter scheme against BTb is required to address persisting cases of BTb in disease-free farms, as described here...|$|E
40|$|Accurate {{detection}} and removal of infected cattle, using immunodiagnostic tests {{such as the}} comparative intradermal tuberculin (CIDT) test, are the basis of control strategies for bovine tuberculosis (TB). According to the Office des Internationale Epizooties recommendation, the cutoff point for positivity of the CIDT test, calculated as the difference between skin thicknesses after bovine tuberculin (B) and <b>avian</b> <b>tuberculin</b> (A) injections (B − A), is > 4 mm. This cutoff point is used worldwide, although {{it is likely that}} local conditions influence test performance. Thus, this study was formulated to determine CIDT test cutoff points applicable to cattle in central Ethiopia. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed for the CIDT test, using data from 186 Bos indicus (zebu) and Bos taurus (Holstein) cattle. Detailed postmortem examination for the presence of TB lesions was used to define disease status. At a cutoff of > 2 mm, CIDT test sensitivity was 69 % (95 % confidence interval [95 % CI], 58. 5 to 79 %), while it was 59 % (95 % CI, 49 to 69 %) at a cutoff of > 4 mm. In contrast, specificities of the CIDT test at these two cutoff values were identical, at 97 % (95 % CI, 89 to 100 %). Thus, the maximum sensitivity of the CIDT test can be realized using a > 2 -mm cutoff without affecting specificity. The apparent prevalence was significantly (χ 2 = 13. 56; P 2 mm (16. 0 %; n = 5, 424) than at a > 4 -mm cutoff (13. 5 %; n = 5, 424). Nonetheless, no significant difference (χ 2 = 2. 15; P = 0. 14) in true prevalence was observed at a cutoff of > 2 mm (19. 6 %) and at a cutoff of > 4 mm (18. 5 %). Thus, our study demonstrates the importance of defining local, relevant cutoff values to maximize test sensitivity, and we suggest the application of the > 2 -mm cutoff for testing of cattle in central Ethiopia...|$|E
40|$|Bovine {{tuberculosis}} {{caused by}} Mycobacterium bovis, is a chronic debilitating disease of mostly domestic cattle with infections {{reported in a}} wide range of domestic and wild animal species and also in humans. Due to its trade and public health implications, bovine tuberculosis is a controlled disease in many countries. The prescribed diagnostic test is the intradermal tuberculin test (skin test) which involves the evaluation of the host’s hypersensitivity reaction 72 hours after the intradermal injection of purified derivatives of mycobacterial proteins (bovine and <b>avian</b> <b>tuberculin).</b> Interpretation of skin test reactions is based on measuring the increase in skin thickness, as well as the subjective evaluation of any clinical signs observed such as edema and necrosis. The quality of the test outcome is highly dependent on the operator’s skills and experience in performing this test. Practical training of veterinary students in the correct execution and interpretation of the skin test is therefore a critical Day 1 competency. Live animal training for intradermal tuberculin testing is limited and no skin test models are commercially available. Therefore, bovine skin models made of dragon skin and platinum-cure silicon placed on aluminum clipper frames measuring 20 x 30 cm and covered with artificial hair were developed. Each of the five models represents a different common test outcome: edema, diffuse or circumscribed swellings, necrosis and adhesion of the skin. The models are used to evaluate the different skin reactions by palpation, measuring skin thickness, and visual evaluation. A step-by-step manual is available to guide students through the procedure and interpretation of the skin reactions.

40|$|The {{two most}} {{prominent}} mycobacterial diseases in animals include bovine tuberculosis, caused by Mycobacterium bovis and Johne’s disease, caused by Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis. Erradication of both diseases has been hampered {{by a variety}} of factors. In many countries, the persistence of tuberculosis in cattle has been attributed to reservoirs of M. bovis in wildlife species. Brushtail possums, deer and badgers are notable examples of wildlife reservoirs for M. bovis. The difficulties in eliminating the wildlife reservoir for M. bovis further suggest the need for vaccination of farmed livestock. Vaccination of wildlife species has also been attempted with mixed results. Delivery of the vaccine to wildlife species appears to be a chief obstacle. Vaccination itself leads to complications for diagnostics. For example, when cattle are vaccinated with both BCG and a commercial Johne’s vaccine there is a biased toward the <b>avian</b> <b>tuberculin</b> skin test reaction. Despite these issues, BCG seems to be the clear standard for vaccination against M. bovis, yet many laboratories are investigating ways to improve on BCG. For Johne’s disease, the available commercial vaccines consist of whole-cell preparations in one form or another. But with the ability to generate directed knockouts of specific genes, a number of defined mutants have been constructed in a few laboratories. These should be tested and directly compared with each other and alongside commercial vaccine formulations to determine not only which vaccine is most protective, but which animal model is best for predicting protection in the target host. To this end, there has been a nation-wide, multi-institutional effort to test the best live, attenuated vaccine against Johne's disease in cattle, sheep and goats. This vaccine trial has spanned six years and was conducted in three phases. The first phase examined attenuation in bovine macrophages, the second phase was colonization of spleen and liver in mice and the third phase was protection from bacterial challenge in goats. Many new ideas and retrospective approaches have emerged from this unprecedented effort. These aspects will be captured in this Research Topic. In this Research Topic, we will seek articles on these above topics, but other issues surrounding vaccination of animals against mycobacteria will also be explored. These include immune parameters, correlates of protection, adjuvants and other vaccine formulations, etc...|$|E
40|$|A realização deste trabalho, considerando a importância e a natureza pioneira das informações para o Nordeste e a inexistência de registros oficiais de órgãos públicos e privados que se tem acesso em nosso país, teve como objetivo relatar a intercorrência entre tuberculose bovina e caprina em rebanhos leiteiros de Pernambuco e avaliar os fatores de risco relacionados. A identificação de portadores de infecção pelo M. bovis foi realizada pelo Teste Cervical Comparativo (TCC) : nos bovinos, de acordo com as diretrizes do PNCEBT; nos caprinos, pelo teste da tuberculina padronizado experimentalmente para caprinos. Foram submetidas ao TCC: 88 vacas com fenótipo predominante da raça Girolanda, com idades entre três a sete anos, criados em dois rebanhos leiteiros e 168 cabras das raças Saanen, Toggenburg e Parda Alpina e seus mestiços, com idades entre dois a seis anos, criadas em seis rebanhos leiteiros localizados em municípios da Mesorregião Metropolitana de Recife, Pernambuco. Conjuntamente, a freqüência de vacas e cabras que reagiram positivamente ao teste da tuberculina foi de 10, 9 %, destacando-se taxas elevadas nos caprinos (16, 2 %) e nos bovinos (19, 4 %). As vacas e cabras que manifestaram reações imunoalérgicas clinicamente inconclusivas às tuberculinas corresponderam a 8 % e 1, 2 %, respectivamente. Conjuntamente, as freqüências de vacas e cabras positivas e inconclusivas formaram o índice de 14, 4 %. Das vacas submetidas ao TCC, 17, 0 % (15 / 88) reagiram positivamente. Em valores médios, as positivas apresentaram reações imunoalérgicas às tuberculinas bovina e aviária com intensidades de 9, 4 mm (3, 1) e 3, 3 mm (1, 1), respectivamente, sendo a diferença entre as duas de 6, 0 mm (1, 8). Das cabras submetidas ao TCC, 7, 7 % (13 / 168) reagiram positivamente. Em valores médios, as positivas apresentaram reações imunoalérgicas às tuberculinas bovina e aviária com intensidades de 14, 1 (6, 2) e 6, 4 mm (4, 2), respectivamente, sendo a diferença entre as duas de 7, 7 mm (3, 4). As evidências clínico-epidemiológicas observadas neste estudo, além de demonstrarem que a tuberculose encontra-se amplamente disseminada nos rebanhos examinados, sugerem que a infecção pelo M. bovis em caprinos pode ocorrer em conexão com a infecção em bovinos, a partir da grande circulação de leite de vaca entre rebanhos caprinos cujos produtores adquiriram a prática comum da utilização do leite de vacas para cabritos como medida preventiva contra a CAE. The {{accomplishment}} of this work, considering {{the importance and}} the pioneer nature of {{the information to the}} Northeast and the inexistence of official records of public and private agencies that we can have access in our country, had the aim of reporting the rotation between tuberculosis in bovine and in goats in milk flocks in the State of Pernambuco, and to evaluate the related factors of risk. The identification of the M. bovis infected carriers was made through Cervical Comparative Test (CCT) : in bovines, according to the lines of direction of PNCEBT; in goats, through the experimentally standardized tuberculin test for goats. Were submitted to the CCT: 88 cows with the predominant phenotype of Girolanda breed, with age between three and seven, raised in two different dairy cattles and 168 goats of Saanen, Toggenburg and Parda Alpina breeds and their crossings, with age between two and six, raised in milk flocks located in towns of the Metropolitan Region of Recife, Pernambuco. Jointly, the frequency of cows and female goats that reacted positively to the tuberculin test were 10, 9 %, standing out the high rates in goats (16, 2 %) and the bovines (19, 4 %). The cows and the female goats that had clinical inconclusive hypersensitivity reaction to the tuberculin were 8 % and 1, 2 %, respectively. Jointly, the frequency of cows and female goats that were positive and inconclusive came to the index of 14, 4 %. The cows that were submitted to the CCT, 17, 0 % (15 / 88) reacted positively. On average numbers, the positives showed hypersensitivity reaction to the bovine and <b>avian</b> <b>tuberculin</b> with the intensity of 9, 4 mm (&# 61617; 3, 1) e 3, 3 mm (&# 61617; 1, 1), respectively, having {{the difference between the two}} of 0, 6 mm (&# 61617; 1, 8). The female goats that were submitted to the CCT, 7, 7 % (13 / 168) reacted positively.

The clinical epidemic evidences observed in this work, not also demonstrates that the tuberculin is highly disseminated on the examined flocks, as well as suggests that the M. bovis infection in goats can occur in connection with the infection in bovines, from the big circulation of cow milk between goat flocks which the producers acquire the common practice of utilizing the cow milk to the baby goats as a preventive measures against CAE...|$|E
40|$|A {{review of}} the {{literature}} {{on the history of the}} tuberculin test and causes of non-specific reactions in cattle is given. The economic importance of the nonspecific reactor problem in South Africa is discussed. The cultural and biochemical characteristics and in some instances the virulence for laboratory animals of the 42 strains used in the investigation are given. The strains used were typical of the species they represented in these characteristics, except for the scotochromogen Hg 3. Details are given of the preparation of PPD sensitins from one strain of M. hovis, three strains of M. kansasii, two strains of M. fortuitum, two strains of M. phlei, two strains of M. smegmatis, six M. avium and avian-like strains, two strains of scotochromogenic mycobacteria, and six strains of unclassified mycobacteria probably belonging to a single species. The allergenic characteristics of the 42 strains of Mycobacteria and the twenty four sensitins were studied in guinea pigs. Specificity differences of the sensitins and sensitivity profiles of the strains are given. The sensitivity caused by various species of mycobacteria was found to be species specific, although varying degrees of cross sensitivity do occur between different species. Guine 1 pigs and cattle sensitized by all the species investigated except M. bovus is were more sensitive to avian PPD than to bovine PPD. It was shown that the specificity of the sensitivity caused by different species of mycobacteria is similar in calves and guinea pigs. Multiple comparative tests in naturally sensitized non-specific reactor cattle showed most of these animals to be more sensitive to <b>avian</b> <b>tuberculin</b> than to any of the other sensitins used in the investigation. The sensitivity profiles in these animals were similar to sensitivity profiles in guinea pigs sensitized by M. avium. This indicates that the most common cause of non-specific reactors in these herd was M. avium or avian-like mycobacteria. Field trials with Onderstepoort PPD tuberculins showed the comparative test to be more accurate than a test with bovine tuberculin alone in differentiating nonspecific reactors and tuberculous animals. The simultaneous injection of via and bovine tuberculin did not influence the sensitivity to the latter. Results are given of investigations in two herds where both non-specific reactors and tuberculous animals occurred. Non-specific reactions were more common in young and tuberculosis more common in older cattle. The most suitable interpretation standards for the comparative test and the test with bovine tuberculin alone were investigated. Suggested interpretation keys are given.

Na Fazenda 1, de um rebanho de 33 caprinos e 13 ovinos, uma cabra adulta apresentou emagrecimento progressivo por aproximadamente um ano e fezes pastosas um mês antes da morte. Todos os animais do rebanho foram tuberculinizados com a prova comparativa. Um ovino (2, 2 %) teve resultado positivo à tuberculina aviar e em dois o teste foi inconclusivo. Na Fazenda 2, com 200 ovinos e 80 caprinos, foi afetada uma ovelha adulta que apresentou emagrecimento progressivo por aproximadamente um ano e fezes pastosas por aproximadamente 20 dias. Todos os ovinos com mais de 4 meses de idade e 23 caprinos foram tuberculinizados com tuberculina aviar; em 47 (25, 4 %) o resultado foi positivo, em 115 (61, 5 %) inconclusivo e em 25 (13, 4 %) negativo. Entre as cabras não houve nenhuma positiva à tuberculina aviar, mas em 11 (47, 8 %) o teste foi inconclusivo e em 12 (52, 2 %) foi negativo. Na necropsia dos dois animais com sinais clínicos os linfonodos mesentéricos estavam aumentados de tamanho e edemaciados. O ovino afetado da Fazenda 2, apresentou espessamento e enrugamento da mucosa do intestino, principalmente no íleo e válvula íleo-cecal. Microscopicamente o caprino e o ovino com sinais clínicos apresentaram lesões semelhantes, caracterizadas por granulomas com predominância de macrófagos espumosos, na lâmina própria e {{submucosa}} do intestino e linfonodos mesentéricos. O ovino positivo à tuberculina e um caprino negativo na Fazenda 1 foram eutanasiados e apresentaram discreto espessamento da mucosa do íleo. Na histologia foi observado infiltrado preferentemente linfocítico. Em todos os casos dentro de macrófagos e linfócitos havia bacilos ácool-ácidos resistentes, positivos na imunohistoquímica para Mycobacterium spp. Sugere-se a necessidade de estudar a prevalência de paratuberculose em rebanhos de caprinos e ovinos no Brasil, determinar medidas de controle e avaliar a possibilidade de transmissão para humanos. This paper reports paratuberculosis in {{sheep and}} goats {{for the first time}} in Brazil. On Farm 1 in a flock of 33 goats and 13 sheep, one adult female goat presented progressive weight loss during about one year, and soft feces during one month before death. All the animals from the flock were submitted to the comparative tuberculin test. One sheep was positive to the <b>avian</b> <b>tuberculin</b> (2. 2 %) and in two the results were inconclusive. On Farm 2, in a flock of 200 sheep and 80 goats, one adult ewe presented progressive weight loss during about one year, and soft feces during 20 days before death. All sheep older than four months of age and 23 goats were submitted to tuberculin test with avian tuberculin; 47 (25. 4 %) sheep were positive, 115 (61. 5 %) had inconclusive results, and 25 (13. 4 %) were negative. No positive tuberculin test were observed in the goats, but in 11 (47. 8 %) the test was inconclusive and in 12 (52. 2 %) was negative. At necropsy both affected animals had enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes. In the affected sheep, the gut wall was thickened and corrugated, mainly in the ileum and ileocecal valve. Histologically, granulomas with mainly foamy macrophages were observed in the lamina propria and submucosa of the gut, in mesenteric lymph nodes, and in the goat also in the liver. One tuberculin positive sheep and one tuberculin negative goat from Farm 1 were euthanized and necropsied. A mild thickened of the intestinal wall was observed grossly in both animals. Inflammatory infiltrate with mainly lymphocytes was observed on the submucosa and lamina propria of the gut. In the four cases acid-alcohol positive rods, positive for Mycobacterium spp. on immunohistochemical examination were observed in macrophages and lymphocytes.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to confirm the presence of bovine tuberculosis (BTB) and determine its prevalence, based on skin test reactivity, in cattle reared under extensive farming conditions in the Govuro district, Inhambane province, Mozambique. The study was comprised of a primary screening test using the single intradermal test (SIT) in randomly selected animals from Colonato and Sede dip tanks in Govuro. Positive reactors to the SIT were tested again with bovine and <b>avian</b> <b>tuberculin</b> using the single intradermal comparative test (SICTT) 7 weeks after the SIT. The sample size was calculated using Win Episcope 2. 0 based on 95 % confidence to detect a 2 % expected prevalence using the SIT, with a 1 % accepted error and accounting for a total population size of 7208. The calculated sample size was 682 animals. To compensate for the probability of 20 % default in reading, the sample size was increased to 853. During the testing process (SIT), it was evident from the first 3 reading days that the apparent prevalence (61, 94 %) was higher than expected (2 %), hence we decided to stop when the total number of cattle was 530. During the testing process (SIT), it was evident from the first 3 reading days that the apparent prevalence (61. 94 %) was far higher than expected (2 %), hence we decided to stop when the total number of cattle was 530. This was due to the fact that, at such a high prevalence, it would not be necessary to achieve as high a precision as 1 % accepted error. A sample size of 530 would be sufficient to achieve a precision of 4 % accepted error, which was regarded as more than adequate. The 530 cattle, 3 or more years of age, were selected using systematic random sampling from the two dip tanks (Colonato 371 and Sede 159 animals). All animals were identified by numbers painted, dorsally on the sacral region. Out of 530 tested cattle by SIT, 268 were read, and 166 / 268 (61. 94 % with 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 55. 8 – 67. 8 %) were found positive, with visible swallow at the injection site. Apparent prevalence (AP) was found to be 61. 94 % while the true prevalence (TP) was 75. 92 %. The predictive value of a positive result (PV+) was found to be 87. 9 %. No significant difference in apparent prevalence between the two areas was detected by Fisher’s exact test (P = 0. 11). By SICTT, out of 28 animals positive reactors to SIT, 21 were possible to read, and 13 / 21 (61. 9 %; 95 % CI: 55. 1 – 89. 3 %) were found positive. A three year old bull, positive reactor to the SIT, was slaughtered, and a detailed post mortem was carried out and organs with visible lesions were collected for further laboratory testing (histopathology, culture and isolation of M. Bovis and PCR). Later on, 30 more positive reactors to the SIT test were slaughtered: 25 / 30 (83. 3 %) showed visible lesions compatible with BTB, and total condemnation of carcass was made in 3 / 25 (12 %) due to generalized lesions. The high prevalence rate of skin test positive animals as well as gross lesions and histopathology were confirmed to be BTB by the isolation and identification of M. Bovis by culture and PCR. Our results suggest that bovine tuberculosis is highly prevalent in Govuro district and may thus represent a potential health problem of zoonotic tuberculosis in humans. Our results suggest that BTB has reached the plateau phase of endemicity in cattle in Govuro district. In this context, the positive predictive value of the SIT is very high and thus the use of the SICTT as a confirmatory test has a limited value and should not be advocated. Our results further indicate that no other prevalence study of BTB should be conducted {{in the next few years}} in Govuro district, unless comprehensive control measures are implemented. The focus of further studies should be on the isolation and the molecular characterization of M. Bovis from cattle and humans in order to assess transmission routes and the role played by BTB in human TB cases in Govuro district.
