5|$|Article I {{contains}} the entire original Virginia Declaration of Rights from the 1776 Constitution. Several of the sections have been expanded to incorporate concepts from the United States Bill of Rights, {{including the right}} to due process, the prohibition against double jeopardy, and the right to bear <b>arms.</b> <b>Like</b> the Federal Constitution, the Virginia Bill of Rights, in §17, states that the listing of certain rights is not to be construed to exclude other rights held by the people.|$|E
5|$|The {{office of}} Dean {{is held by}} the Dean of Westminster. The King of Arms, {{responsible}} for heraldry, is known as Bath King of Arms; he is not, however, {{a member of the}} College of <b>Arms,</b> <b>like</b> many heralds. The Order's Usher is known as the Gentleman Usher of the Scarlet Rod; he does not, unlike his Order of the Garter equivalent (the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod) perform any duties in the House of Lords.|$|E
5|$|In {{the western}} churches, the mitre was placed above the shield of all persons who were {{entitled}} to wear the mitre, including abbots. It substituted for the helmet of military arms, but also appeared as a crest placed atop a helmet, as was common in German heraldry. In the Anglican Churches, the mitre is still placed above the arms of bishops and not an ecclesiastical hat. In the Roman Catholic Church, {{the use of the}} mitre above the shield on the personal arms of clergy was suppressed in 1969, and is now found only on some corporate <b>arms,</b> <b>like</b> those of dioceses. Previously, the mitre was often included under the hat, and even in the arms of a cardinal, the mitre was not entirely displaced.|$|E

5|$|The {{debate has}} played out {{across a wide}} {{spectrum}} of media, including newspapers, magazines, web blogs, and congressional research <b>arms</b> <b>like</b> the Government Accountability Office. Each side has presented different arguments on the best approach to the problem, but most of the participants favor the continuation of the DD(X) program or the reinstatement of the Iowa-class battleships to the Naval Vessel Register. The s, the s, and s have entered the debate as options put forward for naval gunfire support, while others advocate the use of specifically designed close air support planes and newer missile systems that can loiter in an area as a replacement for naval gunfire.|$|E

25|$|Gilbert Dethick first married Alice, {{daughter}} of Leonard Peterson, a Dutchman, but Alice died on 13 January 1572. Dethick then married Jane, {{daughter of}} Richard Duncomb of Moreton, Buckinghamshire and widow of William Naylor, {{one of the}} six clerks in chancery. In his first marriage, Dethick had three sons: Nicholas Dethick, who would become Windsor Herald of Arms in Ordinary; Sir William Dethick, who would become Garter Principal King of <b>Arms</b> <b>like</b> his father, and Henry Dethick, Chancellor of the Diocese of Carlisle. In his second marriage, Dethick had one son, Robert, and a daughter, Mary.|$|E

25|$|The video {{opens with}} a close shot of Knowles face who's wearing a similar make-up to English model Twiggy. The video then shows shots of Knowles moving her <b>arms</b> <b>like</b> a clock and wearing a black T-shirt and black trousers. Scenes similar to 1957 film Funny Face follow with Knowles looking like Audrey Hepburn. Those shots are cut {{by a variety of}} brightly colored bathing suits and a {{black-and-white}} hat, set against a constantly changing background of colors which is similar to Vogue photo shoots. Knowles' baby bump is less visible in the bathing suit scenes but is featured prominently earlier in the video. The clip cuts quickly from the bathing suit sequence to shots of Knowles in an audition space similar to the 1980 film Fame. The sequence features choreographed moves from Knowles and her back-up dancers who snap with their fingers which is a reference to 1961 musical West Side Story.|$|E
500|$|Harrison {{commissioned}} Tom Wilkes {{to design}} a hinged box in which to house the three vinyl discs, rather than have them packaged in a triple gatefold cover. Apple insider Tony Bramwell later recalled: [...] "It was a bloody big thing... You needed <b>arms</b> <b>like</b> an orang-utan to carry half a dozen." [...] The packaging caused some confusion among retailers, who, at that time, associated boxed albums with opera or classical works.|$|E

A pregnant Carey, who only moves from the waist up, wears a black laced dress while {{standing in front of}} a green screen, which depict exploding fireworks in the nights sky. Becky Bain for Idolator positively reviewed the video, writing [...] "There is something so endlessly entertaining about watching Mariah Carey do her patented diva theatrics — waving her <b>arms</b> <b>like</b> a crazy hand model; tenderly stroking her hair; spinning around dramatically." ...|$|E

500|$|Early {{versions}} were {{a platform}} for mounting third party tonearms. Prior to the launch of Roksan's maiden tonearm – the Artemiz, it was most commonly partnered with the Rega RB300 (at the [...] "budget" [...] end), and the SME V (at the [...] "top" [...] end). Other 12-inch <b>arms,</b> <b>like</b> AudioQuest or SME 309, were also chosen by buyers. The Rega was able to function {{in a way that}} seemed more synergistic with the Xerxes than the LP12. In both price and performance terms, the original Xerxes, fitted with the Rega RB300 costing £95, became a head-on (and cheaper) alternative to the LP12 fitted with the Linn Ittok arm.|$|E
500|$|Cephalopods {{have existed}} for 500 million years and octopus {{ancestors}} {{were in the}} Carboniferous seas 300 million years ago. The oldest known octopus fossil is Pohlsepia, which lived 296 million years ago. Researchers have identified impressions of eight arms, two eyes, and possibly an ink sac. Octopuses are mostly soft tissue, and so fossils are relatively rare. Octopuses, squids and cuttlefish belong to the clade Coleoidea. They are known as [...] "soft-bodied" [...] cephalopods, lacking the external shell of most molluscs and other cephalopods like the Nautiloids and the extinct Ammonoidea. Octopuses have eight <b>arms</b> <b>like</b> other coleoids but lack the extra specialised feeding appendages known as tentacles which are longer and thinner with suckers only at their club-like ends. The vampire squid (Vampyroteuthis) also lacks tentacles but has sensory filaments.|$|E

500|$|Lysurus periphragmoides, {{commonly}} known as the stalked lattice stinkhorn or chambered stinkhorn, is a species of fungus in the stinkhorn family. It was originally described as Simblum periphragmoides in 1831, and has been known as many different names before being transferred to Lysurus in 1980. The saprobic fungus has a pantropical distribution, and has been found in Africa, Asia, Australasia, and the Americas, where it grows on fertile ground and on mulch. The fruit body, which can extend up to [...] tall, consists of a reddish latticed head (a receptaculum) placed on top of a long stalk. A dark olive-green spore mass, the gleba, fills the interior of the lattice and extends outwards between the <b>arms.</b> <b>Like</b> other members of the Phallaceae family, the gleba has a [...] odor that attracts flies and other insects to help disperse its spores. The immature [...] "egg" [...] form of the fungus is considered edible.|$|E
500|$|Marge {{attends the}} {{workshops}} alone while Homer triumphantly rows in with General Sherman. When he returns, Marge tells him their marriage {{is in serious}} trouble if he values fishing more than her. To prove his love for her, he lets the fish (still alive) go and they return home. Once home, Marge congratulates Grampa on how clean the house is, to which he reveals his secret is [...] "pretending to cry". Grampa laughs as he reveals to a shocked Bart and Lisa that he tricked them as he leaves, and Bart swears he will never trust an old person again. At the bait shop, General Sherman is still uncaught, but tales are told of a near-mythical figure who almost succeeded: [...] "Went {{by the name of}} Homer. Seven feet tall he was, with <b>arms</b> <b>like</b> tree trunks. His eyes were like steel: cold, hard. Had a shock of hair, red, like the fires of Hell." ...|$|E

2500|$|Orcs are {{described}} as ugly and filthy fanged humanoids. The largest can reach near-human height, but they are almost always shorter, and some are as small as Hobbits (since Frodo and Sam disguise themselves as such when they enter Mordor). In contrast, crossbreeds between Men and Orcs are called [...] "man-high, but with goblin-faces." [...] However, some Orcs are very broad, if not tall. Many Orcs have long <b>arms,</b> <b>like</b> monkeys or apes. Many of them also have crooked backs and legs.|$|E

An animated section follows where Madonna, as a superheroine character with superpowers, flies above rooftops, swims underwater, and DJs at a club with a dozen <b>arms</b> <b>like</b> a Hindu deity. Madonna's animated character also attacks various neon signs with the names of many of her successful songs. The video ends with Madonna and her friends traveling in the limousine with many of the strippers and G engaging in a rendezvous with them. In a humorous twist, throughout the video Madonna wears a gold necklace around her neck that says [...] "Mommy." ...|$|E
