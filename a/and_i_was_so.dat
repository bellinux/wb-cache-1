Nashville sportswriter Fred Russell, who entered Vanderbilt in 1924, told a story about Bomar in his {{autobiography}} Bury Me In An Old Press Box: [...] "As a freshman I had pledged Kappa Sigma fraternity, which at that time had many varsity athletes. Among them was Lynn Bomar, selected All-American end in 1923... I also had the responsibility, as a freshman, of awakening Bomar in time for him to get to classes, and at the end of the school year I did this one morning by rolling the biggest lighted firecracker I ever saw under his bed. When it exploded I feared the whole corner of the fraternity house had been blown off, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> scared that even Bomar in his BVD's chasing me across the street and deep into the campus couldn't catch me." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{influential}} distortion {{sound of}} the guitar track was created after guitarist Dave Davies sliced the speaker cone of his guitar amplifier with a razor blade and poked it with a pin. The amplifier was affectionately called [...] "little green", after {{the name of the}} amplifier made by the Elpico company, and purchased in Davies' neighbourhood music shop, linked to a Vox AC-30. In 2014, Dave Davies accused brother Ray of lying about participating in Dave's guitar distortion sound. Dave wrote on his Facebook page, [...] "My brother is lying. I don't know why he [...] does this but it was my Elpico amp that I bought and out of frustration I cut the speaker cone up with a razor blade <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> shocked and [...] surprised and excited that it worked that I demonstrated the sound to Ray and [...] Pete [...] … Ray liked the sound and he had written a riff on the piano which formed the basis of the song 'You Really Got Me' and I played the riff on my guitar with my new sound. I alone created this sound." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{first version}} of [...] "Your Love" [...] {{appeared}} on Minaj's unofficial mixtape Barbie World (2010), with different lyrics included in the pre-chorus along with a faster pace. Another version was later stolen and leaked online. The song underwent minor lyrical adjustments and mixing before being sent to mainstream radio, as the first official single from Minaj's debut album Pink Friday (2010). In an interview with Hot 93.7 radio, Minaj spoke about the leak of the song, saying [...] "That was a leak <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> upset they put it out 'cause I recorded that song like two years ago. Next thing you know, people started {{falling in love with}} it." [...] Whilst on set on the music video for [...] "Your Love", Minaj further explain about the song's theft and leak, saying, [...] "I was not planning on putting the song out at all. But then I heard it one day, somebody told me it was online. And I was like, 'No way, no way in the world that song is out.' I went and listened to it and was really upset. It wasn't mixed, it wasn't finished, it wasn't anything — I wasn't gonna use it at all. But then radio started playing it." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the Munich appointment Solti gained a recording contract in 1946. He signed for Decca Records, not as a conductor but as a piano accompanist. He made his first recording in 1947, playing Brahms's First Violin Sonata with the violinist Georg Kulenkampff. He was insistent {{that he wanted to}} conduct, and Decca gave him his first recording sessions as a conductor later in the same year, with the Zurich Tonhalle Orchestra in Beethoven's Egmont overture. Twenty years later Solti said, [...] "I'm sure it's a terrible record, because the orchestra was not very good at that time <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> excited. It is horrible, surely horrible– but by now it has vanished." [...] He had to wait two years for his next recording as a conductor. It was in London, Haydn's Drum Roll symphony, in sessions produced by John Culshaw, with whose career Solti's became closely linked over the next two decades. Reviewing the record, The Gramophone said, [...] "The performance of the London Philharmonic Orchestra under Georg Solti (a fine conductor who is new to me) is remarkable for rhythmic playing, richness of tone, and clarity of execution." [...] The Record Guide compared it favourably with EMI's rival recording by Sir Thomas Beecham and the Royal Philharmonic.|$|E

[...] (Anthony Connor, [...] "Voices from Cooperstown" [...] (1982), p.37) [...] Player-manager Ty Cobb was reportedly so impressed with Gehringer that he asked club owner Frank Navin to sign Gehringer to a contract on the spot.

2500|$|Stylistically, Seventh Son of a Seventh Son {{developed}} the sounds first heard on Somewhere in Time, although, on this occasion, the synth effects {{were created by}} keyboards rather than bass or guitar synthesisers. According to Dickinson, the band decided not to hire a keyboard player, with the parts being [...] "mainly one-finger stuff from , Steve, the engineer or whoever had a finger free at the time." [...] Harris was fond of the development, {{in spite of the}} fact that the record did not sell as well as its predecessor in the United States; [...] "I thought it was the best album we did since Piece of Mind. I loved it because it was more progressive—I thought the keyboards really fitted in brilliantly—'cause that's the influences I grew up with, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> pissed off with the Americans, because they didn't really seem to accept it. Everyone said afterwards that it was a European-sounding album. I'm not so sure about that. What's a European-sounding album? To me, it's just a Maiden-sounding album." ...|$|E

[...] According to Isabel Hilton, writing in the British edition of Gentleman's Quarterly (GQ), observers say that Pérez may even have offered Halvorssen the job as a necessary matching gesture when US president George H. W. Bush appointed William Bennett as his Director of National Drug Control Policy, thinking that Halvorssen was still drinking and wouldn't cause problems. [...] Halvorssen performed his duties well, deciding to use his worldwide contacts and intelligence connections to detail the extent of Venezuela's role in the drug world. [...] Halvorssen believed that Pérez wasn't responding to his reports on drug trafficking and money laundering and approached his ally, Venezuelan Senator Cristobal Fernandez Daló. [...] In 1992, he was appointed special overseas investigator of an Anti-Money-Laundering Commission by the Venezuelan Senate. [...] He was a liaison between law enforcement agencies around the world, working on drug and money-laundering cases.|$|E

[...] The words of the preacher I did not know, but they sounded like the softy winds through a leafy forest and my eyelids were heavy.

2500|$|Willa Holland portrays Kaitlin Cooper (season 4, {{recurring}} season 1, 3). The {{role was}} originally played by Shailene Woodley in a recurring role during Season 1. Kaitlin {{spends much of}} the series at boarding school before returning on a recurring basis in season 3 (now played by Holland) and finally becoming a regular character in season 4. The daughter of Jimmy Cooper and Julie Cooper-Nichol and sister to Marissa Cooper, her personality is more similar to her mother's rather than her father's, and she is portrayed as a regular pot smoker and occasional dealer. Holland observed that [...] "no one can control her" [...] but that her arc in Season 4 finds the character maturing. When asked about any disappointment over the recast, Shailene Woodley responded that, [...] "I was 11 and I was on as a guest, recurring character, or whatever. My character went to boarding school and {{when they decided to}} bring her back, they actually re-auditioned me to bring her back. But I didn't go through puberty until late (...)

2500|$|Eden Riegel {{was cast}} in 2000 as Bianca Montgomery, the lesbian {{daughter}} of Erica Kane. Riegel left the role and returned several times, before permanently retiring from the role in 2010. [...] She attributed her 2008 return to the wishes of her fans. Through the web presence she created for herself during her web series Imaginary Bitches, fans let her know how much they wanted {{her back on the}} show.

The story the All My Children writers came up with involved a new love interest for Bianca, Reese Williams, who would be portrayed by daytime alumni Tamara Braun.

I love All My Children, and they’re my family. I barely need an excuse -- it’s usually just about timing."

She stated, [...] "It was very, very important to me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> glad to hear that.
