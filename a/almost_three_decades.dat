40|$|The {{extent of}} {{and changes in}} inter-generational {{mobility}} of wealth are central to understanding dynamics of wealth inequality but hard to measure. Using estate tax returns data, we observe that the share of women among the very wealthy (top 0. 01 %) in the United States peaked in the late 1960 s, reaching <b>almost</b> 50 %. <b>Three</b> <b>decades</b> on, women's share had declined to one third, a return to pre-war levels. We argue that this pattern mirrors {{the relative importance of}} inherited vs. self-made wealth in the economy and thus the gender-composition of the wealthiest may serve as a proxy for inter-generational wealth mobility. This proxy for "dynastic wealth'' suggests that wealth mobility in the past century decreased until the 1970 s and rose thereafter, a pattern consistent with technological change driving long term trends in income inequality and mobility. Greater wealth mobility in recent decades is also consistent with the simultaneous rise in top income shares and relatively stable wealth concentration. ...|$|R

As jazz has accrued “cultural nobility,” a fancy for the music has become a social indicator of one’s level of cultural sophistication. Canonized as a quintessentially American expressive form and repackaged as a non-intrusive, unthreatening vehicle for tranquil repose and nostalgia, jazz thus complements the aura of refinement and serenity that Carmel residents have sought to create and have fought to maintain for over a century. Its jazz programming informed by such discursive shifts, KRML sought to sway listeners to accept jazz as the ideal accompaniment to the placid, laid-back Carmel lifestyle...|$|R
40|$|T HE PANEGYRIC of Procopius of Caesarea on the {{building}} activi-ties of the emperor Justinian has had a powerful and lasting impact, doubtless far greater than its author ever anticipated.

Abroad, Jimmy Carter was President of the US and Leonid Brezhnev of the USSR, Mao had only recently died and Communist China was poised to introduce Deng’s reforms, the Berlin Wall symbolized a divided Europe and the EEC had just nine members.

This essay revisits ‘The Political Economy of the Welfare State’ (PEWS) and discusses its relevance {{in the context of}} the latest global developments. The key conclusion is that at a time when capital-in-general is developing unprecedented economic power across vast zones of the globe, when certain nation states wield unprecedented administrative and military power, when new global institutions are invented and outfitted to manage the processes of globalization, when new political movements begin to respond to these developments in the name of anti-globalization and anti-consumerism, it would be strange at such a time to discard the insights of political economy.

We thus aimed to evaluate the skin′s water and lipid content in patients with a disability of > 25 % due to complications of SM poisoning and compare them with a matched control group. Materials and Methods: Sixty-nine male participants were included in this study; 43 SM-exposed patients, and 26 normal controls from their close relatives. The water and lipid content was measured in four different locations: Extensor and flexor sides of forearms and lateral and medial sides of legs by the Corneometer CM 820 /Sebumeter SM 810. Collected data was analyzed and P ≤ 0. 05 was considered as statistically significant. Results: The {{mean age of the}} patients and controls was 49. 53 ± 11. 34 (ranges: 40 - 71) and 29. 08 ± 8. 836 (ranges: 15 - 49 years), respectively.

The moisture and lipid content of all areas were lower in the SM-exposed group, but it was only significant in skin sebum of lateral sides of legs (P = 0. 02).

40|$|Tungstated {{zirconia}} (WO 3 /ZrO 2) {{is one of}} {{the most}} well-studied solid acid catalyst systems and continues to attract the attention of both academia and industry. Understanding and controlling the properties of WO 3 /ZrO 2 catalysts has been a topic of considerable interest over <b>almost</b> the past <b>three</b> <b>decades,</b> with a particular focus on discovering the relationship between catalytic activity and the molecular structure of the surface acid site. Amorphous tungsten oxide (WOx) species on ZrO 2 surfaces were previously proposed to be very active for different acidic reactions such as alcohol dehydration and alkane isomerization. Recent developments in electron optical characterization and in situ spectroscopy techniques have allowed researchers to isolate the size, structure, and composition of the most active catalytic species, which are shown to be three-dimensional distorted Zr-WOx clusters (0. 8 – 1. 0 nm). Complementary theoretical calculations of the Brønsted acidity of these Zr-WOx clusters have confirmed that they possess the lowest deprotonation energy values. This new insight provides a foundation for the future characterization and theory of acidic supported metal oxide catalytic materials that will, hopefully, lead to the design of more active and selective catalysts. This perspective presents an up-to-date, comprehensive summary of the leading models of WO 3 /ZrO 2 solid acid catalysts...|$|R
