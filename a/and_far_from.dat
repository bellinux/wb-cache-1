5|$|Mrs. Tittlemouse {{is a tale}} {{in which}} no humans play a part and one in which events are treated as though they have {{occurred}} since time immemorial <b>and</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> human observance. It is a simple story, and one likely to appeal to young children.|$|E
5|$|Kitsune are {{commonly}} portrayed as lovers, usually in stories involving a young human male and a kitsune {{who takes the}} form of a human woman. The kitsune may be a seductress, but these stories are more often romantic in nature. Typically, the young man unknowingly marries the fox, who proves a devoted wife. The man eventually discovers the fox's true nature, and the fox-wife is forced to leave him. In some cases, the husband wakes as if from a dream, filthy, disoriented, <b>and</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> home. He must then return to confront his abandoned family in shame.|$|E
5|$|The {{second set}} of colonists disembarked from the Kennersley Castle in late March 1823. Their {{optimism}} was quickly extinguished. Hall returned in April with disheartening news: he had found no ship that could help <b>and,</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> considering them any responsibility of his, King George Frederic Augustus had not even been aware of their presence. The Kennersley Castle having sailed, MacGregor's victims could count on no assistance in the near future. The emigrants had brought ample provisions with them, including medicines, and had two doctors among them, so they were not in a totally hopeless situation, but apart from Hall none of the military officers, government officials or civil servants appointed by MacGregor made any serious attempt to organise the party.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1880s, Wallace was {{drawn into the}} debate over {{mandatory}} smallpox vaccination. Wallace originally saw the issue {{as a matter of}} personal liberty; but, after studying some of the statistics provided by anti-vaccination activists, he began to question the efficacy of vaccination. At the time, the germ theory of disease was very new <b>and</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> universally accepted. Moreover, no one knew enough about the human immune system to understand why vaccination worked. When Wallace did some research, he discovered instances where supporters of vaccination had used questionable, in a few cases completely phony, statistics to support their arguments. Always suspicious of authority, Wallace suspected that physicians had a vested interest in promoting vaccination, and became convinced that reductions in the incidence of smallpox that had been attributed to vaccination were, in fact, due to better hygiene and improvements in public sanitation.|$|E
5|$|S. iniae {{is highly}} {{pathogenic}} in freshwater, marine, and euryhaline fish, and is highly lethal: outbreaks {{may be associated}} with 30–50% mortality. It is, therefore, one of the foremost economically important pathogens in intensive aquaculture. In 1997, the global economic impact of S.iniae infection to the aquaculture industry was estimated at US$100million (one-tenth of which in the United States). As of 2007, infection had been reported in 27 species of fish, including tilapia (genus Oreochromis and Tilapia), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), Japanese amberjack (Seriola quinqueradiata), red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus), and barramundi (Lates calcarifer, which can be an asymptomatic carrier). Common carp (Cyprinus carpio), channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), and goldfish (Carassius auratus) appear to be resistant. Fish raised in intensive aquaculture operations and subject to environmental stressors (i.e. suboptimal temperature, poor water quality, crowding, handling, etc.) are most prone to S.iniae infection. Wild fish populations located both near <b>and</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> aquaculture operations have also proven susceptible to S.iniae infection.|$|E

25|$|From 1960, Michel Henry was a {{professor}} of philosophy at the University of Montpellier, where he patiently perfected his work, keeping himself away from philosophical fashions <b>and</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> dominant ideologies. He died in Albi, France, {{at the age of}} eighty.|$|E

During the reign of Wacho, they were Orthodox Catholics allied with the Byzantine Empire, but Alboin converted to Arianism as an ally of the Ostrogoths and invaded Italy. All these Christian conversions primarily affected the aristocracy, while the common people remained pagan.|$|E

25|$|Osteonecrosis {{can affect}} any bone, but the hips, knees and jaws {{are most often}} involved. Pain can often be severe, {{especially}} if teeth and/or {{a branch of the}} trigeminal nerve is involved, but many patients do not experience pain, at least in the earlier stages. When severe facial pain is purported to be caused by osteonecrosis, the term NICO, for neuralgia-inducing cavitational osteonecrosis, is sometimes used, but this is controversial <b>and</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> completely understood.|$|E
25|$|Through the 1570s, a {{soft fabric}} {{hat with a}} {{gathered}} crown was worn. These derived from the flat hat of the previous period, and over time the hat was stiffened and the crown became taller <b>and</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> flat. Later, a conical felt hat with a rounded crown called a capotain or copotain became fashionable. These became very tall {{toward the end of}} century. Hats were decorated with a jewel or feather, and were worn indoors and out.|$|E

25|$|Many of {{his novels}} concern tragic {{characters}} struggling against their passions and social circumstances, {{and they are}} often set in the semi-fictional region of Wessex; initially based on the medieval Anglo-Saxon kingdom, Hardy's Wessex eventually came to include the counties of Dorset, Wiltshire, Somerset, Devon, Hampshire and much of Berkshire, in southwest and south central England. Two of his novels, Tess of the d'Urbervilles <b>and</b> <b>Far</b> <b>from</b> the Madding Crowd, were listed in the top 50 on the BBC's survey The Big Read.|$|E
25|$|Alterations to {{the laws}} of rugby union were trialled by {{students}} of Stellenbosch University in South Africa in 2006, and were adopted in competitions in Scotland and Australia since 2007, though {{only a few of the}} rules were universally adopted. The law variations are an attempt to make rugby union easier to understand by referees, fans and players, but the laws were controversial <b>and</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> being endorsed by all members of these groups.

25|$|The land {{consisted}} mostly mountainous terrain {{with thick}} forest, <b>and</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> the town. Fortunately, Vives {{was able to}} purchase the lands relatively cheap for the lands in greatest demand at that time were the rich flatlands near the coast that provided the perfect conditions for the sugar-growing industry. The {{development of a new}} road in that area, PR-123, would also guarantee that products from Vives' future farm could be bought down for sale to the marketplace in Ponce with relative easy. The construction of the farm-to-market PR-123 road would prove to be a factor in the success of Vives' hacienda.|$|E
