500|$|The Chrysler Building uses silvery [...] "Enduro KA-2" [...] metal {{extensively}} in its design. The metal is an <b>austenitic</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> developed in Germany by Krupp and marketed under the trade name [...] "Nirosta" [...] (a German acronym for nichtrostender Stahl, meaning [...] "non-rusting steel"). The Nirosta steel, whose first use in an American project {{was in the}} Chrysler Building, was was {{also referred to as}} [...] "18-8 stainless steel" [...] because it was composed of 18% chromium and 8% nickel. Nirosta was used in the exterior ornaments, the window frames, the crown, and the needle. The steel {{was an integral part of}} Van Alen's design, as E.E. Thum explains: [...] "The use of permanently bright metal was of greatest aid in the carrying of rising lines and the diminishing circular forms in the roof treatment, so as to accentuate the gradual upward swing until it literally dissolves into the sky...." [...] Stainless steel producers used the Chrysler Building to experiment with the durability of stainless steel in architecture. In 1929, the American Society for Testing Materials created a stainless steel inspection committee. Its members saw the Chrysler Building as the best location to study the effect of the environment on stainless steel, so they created a smaller subcommittee to examine the building's panels every five years. The inspections were canceled after 1960 because the panels had shown minimal deterioration.|$|E

The thesis {{can be divided}} into three parts: modelling of lattice dynamics in <b>austenitic</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> with different composition; modelling of optic modes of hydrogen vibrations in <b>austenitic</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> with variation in alloying composition and hydrogen contents; investigation of structure and lattice dynamics of copper selenide Cu 2 -δSe compounds with different compositions. Firstly were investigated non-hydrogenated <b>austenitic</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steels.</b> The experimental data phonon dispersion curves for the steels Fe- 18 Cr- 12 Ni- 2 Mo and Fe- 18 Cr- 16 Ni- 10 Mn are very similar. The Born-von-Karman model calculation together with the generalized force matrices (5 neighbouring shells) fits well to the experimental data. Using the Born-von Karman model with only two neighbouring shells and introducing the electron gas contribution instead, a significant improvement of the fit can be achieved. With this approach a satisfactory fitting with only few fitting parameters was obtained. In the further work INS study was performed on hydrogenated <b>austenitic</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steels.</b> The experimental data for inelastic neutron scattering in highly hydrogenated <b>austenitic</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> show significantly different results from the samples with medium and low hydrogen content. The fully hydrogenated samples have obviously a two peak structure due to the hydrogen-hydrogen interaction. In this system is used Born-von-Karman model(2 neighbour shell). In the samples with medium and low hydrogen content only one non-symmetric peak exists. Dominant term in this samples is due to influence of different alloying elements. The model which fit experimental data well is model of Einstein oscillators. The structure in α-copper selenide is determined as a function of composition. In Cu 1. 75 Se, Cu 1. 78 Se and Cu 1. 8 Se at room temperature the cations occupy tetrahedral and octahedral interstices within the fcc anion sublattice.

40|$|Introduction The {{mechanical}} properties of <b>austenitic</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steels,</b> including the low cyclic fatigue behavior {{have been a}} subject of numerous studies [1 - 8]. Nitrogen addition, in general, increases the fatigue strength by decreasing the stacking fault energy of <b>austenitic</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> [6]. The stacking fault energy has a strong influence on the cross slip difficulty, thus it affects the saturation dislocation structure formed by the cyclic deformation. However, several studies [9 - 12] reported {{that the effect of}} nitrogen on the dislocation distributions in the deformed microstructures can not be explained by a decrease in the stacking fault energy alone. Swann [9] observed the microstructure of elongated Cr-Ni <b>austenitic</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> and suggested that nitrogen atoms associated with the chromium atoms interact with dislocations. Douglass et al. [10] proposed that nitrogen atoms are attracted to the short range ordered Fe/Cr regions and this ordering...|$|R
30|$|Plasma {{nitriding}} is {{a well-known}} diffusional treatment {{to solve this problem}} that improves the mechanical properties of <b>austenitic</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steels,</b> such as hardness and wear resistance [3, 4, 5]. Increase in the thickness and nitrogen concentration of nitrided layer is an important industrial requirement to improve the hardness, wear resistance, and several other properties in <b>austenitic</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steels.</b> The temperature of 450  °C is an optimum temperature to obtain a relatively thick nitrided layer with appropriate corrosion resistance in the plasma-nitrided AISI 316 L steel [5, 6, 7]. But, a thicker nitrided layer is required in several applications and this requirement can be achieved by increasing the diffusion coefficient of nitrogen. Diffusion coefficient of elements is increased with raising the density of crystalline defects [8]. Hence, increasing the density of crystalline defects in the surface regions can result in more diffusivity of nitrogen as well as more hardness and further thickness of nitrided layer in <b>austenitic</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steels.</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe most {{important}} property of <b>austenitic</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> is corrosion resistance. In these steels, the transition between paramagnetic and ferromagnetic conditions occurs at low temperatures. Therefore, {{the use of}} <b>austenitic</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> in conditions in which ferromagnetism absence is important can be considered. On the other hand, the formation of strain-induced martensite is detected when <b>austenitic</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> are deformed as well as machined. The strain-induced martensite formed especially in the machining process is not uniform through the chip and its formation can also {{be related to the}} Md temperature. Therefore, both the temperature distribution and the gradient during the cutting and chip formation are important to identify regions in which martensite formation is propitiated. The main objective here is evaluate the strain-induced martensite formation throughout machining by observing microstructural features and comparing these to thermal results obtained through finite element method analysis. Results show that thermal analysis can give support to the martensite identified in the microstructural analysis...|$|R
