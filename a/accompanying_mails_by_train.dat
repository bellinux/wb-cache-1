50|$|Robinson also {{surveyed}} {{lines in}} the Mahanoy and Shamokin coal lands, eventually acquiring {{a part of the}} lands. He was civil engineer for the Little Schuylkill Railroad, 1830-1831, and for what would become the Catawissa Railroad in the anthracite country (all later part of the Reading). All had inclines and connected to canals—still within the early British tradition of railroads being an adjunct to water/canal transport systems. While building one of the short coal railroads of the anthracite region Robinson also served as post master of Port Clinton, Pennsylvania, where an early home of his still stands. He led in the effort to influence the carriage of <b>mail</b> <b>by</b> <b>train.</b>|$|R
5|$|British Rail {{was split}} into business-led sectors in the 1980s, {{at which time}} {{operations}} at Yatton passed to Regional Railways. In the 1990s, a stop was added at Yatton for a Royal Mail train {{to provide a more}} direct link to Bristol Airport. The service was ended in 2004 when the post office stopped transporting <b>mail</b> <b>by</b> <b>train.</b> When the railways were privatised in 1997, local services at Yatton were franchised to Wales & West, which was in turn succeeded <b>by</b> Wessex <b>Trains,</b> an arm of National Express, in 2001. The Wessex franchise was amalgamated with the Great Western franchise into the Greater Western franchise from 2006, and responsibility passed to First Great Western, which was rebranded as Great Western Railway in 2015.|$|R
50|$|Hunter {{remained}} as solicitor to the GPO {{until the year}} of his death. Much of his work was in preparing draft legislation on Post Office matters to be put before Parliament. There were more than fifty such drafts during Hunter's tenure. His biographer L W Chubb singles out the Conveyance of Mails Act, 1893, which established an arbitration procedure for disputes between the railway companies and the GPO about charges for transporting <b>mail</b> <b>by</b> <b>train.</b> Chubb calculates that this one measure saved the taxpayer more than £10m. Hunter's other most important contribution, in Chubb's view, was the negotiation of the terms for acquiring the National Telephone Company's system, which saved another £8.5m.|$|R

2500|$|Airmail stamp — {{for payment}} of airmail service. The term [...] "airmail" [...] or an {{equivalent}} is usually printed on special airmail stamps. Airmail stamps typically depict images of airplanes and/or famous pilots and were used when airmail {{was a special}} type of mail delivery separate from <b>mail</b> delivered <b>by</b> <b>train,</b> ship or automobile. Aside from mail with local destinations, today almost all other <b>mail</b> is transported <b>by</b> aircraft and thus airmail is now the standard method of delivery. Scott has a separate category and listing for U.S. Airmail Postage. Prior to 1940, Scotts Catalogue {{did not have a}} special designation for airmail stamps. The various major stamp catalogs have different numbering systems and may not always list airmail stamps the same way.|$|R
25|$|The GWR had amalgamated {{with the}} B, SDR and Cornwall Railway during the 1870s and 1880s, and {{converted}} their lines to standard gauge in 1892. In {{the weeks before}} the conversion {{some of the new}} rolling stock required was worked over the LSWR to reach the Plymouth area, and during the two days that the line was closed they also sent the important London <b>mail</b> <b>trains</b> <b>by</b> this route.|$|R
25|$|The {{rundown of}} the fleet started in 2001, when the {{locomotives}} were replaced on charter and <b>mail</b> <b>trains</b> <b>by</b> Class 67 or Class 90 locomotives. They saw continued use with Virgin Trains, however, but were gradually withdrawn as new Class 390 Pendolino units entered service, reducing the need for hired locomotives. By {{the end of their}} working careers, most of the EWS locomotives were in an appalling state and suffered from numerous failures. The final locomotives, nos. 86210/401/424 were withdrawn from traffic in late 2002.|$|R
50|$|During the 1980s I {{assisted}} with clearing the Paulinskill Valley Trail from Sparta Junction to Columbia Lake near Route 80. AS a volunteer with the NJ Forest Fire Service I helped {{others to do}} this during the winter months. As can be imagined the railroad bed was heavily overgown and demanded a lot of hand labor to clear. Along the way were found many railroad artifacts from long ago. Old switch plates, Railroad mileage posts, Culverts, spikes and occasionally other articles. As we worked along the way I also located the remains of Station foundations and old Creamery buildings, foundations for water tanks and old Semaphore battery boxes. Finding several paperback books on Railroads I used these to return along the track bed where some 1905 photographs of stations had been and using the photos I determined where the photographer on the Special train assigned to him had taken the old black & white photos. It was an interesting adventure and one which I later documented with my own photos I took. Now, many years later I still think of those adventurous days along the old Railroad lines of Sussex County and of an era long ago- gone. (Bob Spear; Historian, Forest Fire Lookout Association FFLA.ORG, October 2016, a freight line running in Hardyston and Sparta townships is the only railroad operating in Sussex County. However, in the past, several railroad companies operated lines in the county when the county's dairy and mining industries relied on trains in their commerce. With the decline of those industries, the end of transporting the <b>mail</b> <b>by</b> <b>train,</b> refrigeration in trucks, lower freight and fuel costs by trucking, the railroads began to lose business; they ceased operating in the 1960s and 1970s. Today, many of the abandoned railbeds have been transformed into recreational trails. With New Jersey Transit's reconstruction and scheduled 2014 reopening of the Lackawanna Cut-Off, passenger rail service will return to Sussex County {{for the first time}} in almost fifty years.|$|R
50|$|In 1912 the {{railroad}} line between Charlotte and Raleigh was completed, {{and the town}} of Stanfield was established. The town was named after an engineer who helped complete {{the railroad}} through the present day town. Once the rail line was completed, the <b>mail</b> was delivered <b>by</b> <b>train</b> to Stanfield, thus moving the post office from Locust, NC to Stanfield. Three local area schools were combined to create Stanfield School. Pete Henkel Park was created in the 1970s. Today, Stanfield School is now Stanfield Elementary School that runs pre-k through the 5th grade, and the students then go to West Stanly High School in Red Cross, NC or to Gray Stone Day School in Misenheimer, NC.|$|R
50|$|The {{railway station}} called Brits was opened on 9 July 1906 and {{residents}} began putting up small businesses {{on the southern}} side of it. The station {{was built on the}} property of Johan Nicolaas Brits that owned part of the farm Roodekopjes. In 1918 a steam driven roller mill was built west of the station and served the farming community for many decades. <b>Mail</b> now arrived <b>by</b> <b>train</b> and it became the station master's job to sort out the peoples mail. The first post office was built on the station in 1915, and the first post master was Haydon Thomas. It was in this little building that the first telephone was installed and it was operated by Miss Theron. The first police station was established in 1921 and Sergeant Prinsloo was the first station commander.|$|R
50|$|The present station {{occupies}} only a {{small part}} of the old station building. The original station was expanded greatly during the latter part of the 19th century as it served what was then Ireland's largest emigration port which was also an important way-point as the last port between Western Europe and North America. The station was also the main receiving centre for mails for Ireland and Britain from the United States and Canada. Mail would be brought by ship to Cobh, processed and forwarded <b>by</b> <b>mail</b> express <b>trains</b> to Kingstown (now Dún Laoghaire) on the outskirts of Dublin and on to Holyhead. This was faster than conveying by ship directly to Liverpool.|$|R
50|$|Following an {{agreement}} in 1830, made between the General Post Office and the Liverpool and Manchester Railway (L&MR), mail had been carried <b>by</b> <b>train</b> in Great Britain, between Liverpool and Manchester, via the L&MR. The passing of the Railways (Conveyance of Mails) Act 1838 required railway companies to carry <b>mail,</b> <b>by</b> ordinary or special <b>trains,</b> as required <b>by</b> the Postmaster General; however this act did not set the charges for such services.|$|R
5000|$|The retail {{industry}} also experienced considerable innovation {{during these years}} {{at the hands of}} Timothy Eaton of Toronto. He offered for sale large numbers of [...] "consumer" [...] goods such as clothes, shoes and household items under the roof of one large store and sold them at fixed prices eliminating the concept of barter. This had become possible because of the recent stabilization of the Canadian currency through the creation of the Canadian dollar and the simultaneous appearance of mass-produced goods which allowed uniform pricing for any particular product. In 1884 he created the iconic Eaton's catalogue which formed the basis for his catalogue sales operation which allowed rural dwellers to order and receive <b>by</b> <b>mail</b> or <b>train</b> the products that were available to those who had access to his growing chain of giant urban department stores.|$|R

50|$|With the {{development}} of fast railways, passages along a coast could also be speeded up <b>by</b> <b>mail</b> tenders. In 1907 the Lady Evelyn was purchased by Canada's Postmaster General {{to act as a}} mail tender for the mouth of the Saint Lawrence River on Canada's East Coast. This was to replace an older steamer, the Rhoda, described in parliament by Lemieux as 'a disgrace'. Liners for the inland port of Quebec City would pass by the small tender port of Rimouski, 200 miles downstream. <b>Mail</b> offloaded <b>by</b> tender here could <b>by</b> taken <b>by</b> <b>train</b> to Quebec much faster than on the liner.|$|R

50|$|In September 1920, under Praeger′s guidance, the Post Office Department {{established}} the first transcontinental {{air mail route}} in the United States. However, the United States lacked a system of lighted navigation beacons, making it too dangerous for air mail pilots to fly at night, and trains carried the mail along the route during the hours of darkness. As a result, transcontinental air mail was not much faster - and considerably more expensive - than transcontinental <b>mail</b> service entirely <b>by</b> <b>train.</b> Praeger understood the dangers of night flying, but wanted to demonstrate its feasibility before President Warren G. Harding took office and appointed his successor. He therefore staged a set of experimental day-and-night mail flights between New York City and San Francisco, California - two eastbound and two westbound - in February 1921.. Not a pilot and, as a native of Texas, unfamiliar with winter weather in the northern and western United States, Praeger probably did not fully understand the danger the flights posed to his pilots. The two westbound flights become stranded in Dubois, Pennsylvania, and Chicago, Ilinois. The first eastbound flight ended in tragedy when the de Havilland DH-4B carrying the mail stalled and crashed after takeoff from Elko, Nevada. The only real success was by the second eastbound flight, whose pilot managed to fly a night leg from North Platte, Nebraska, to Chicago.|$|R
