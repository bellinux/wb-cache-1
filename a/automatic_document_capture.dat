Designed to help users {{solve the problem}} of lost documents, this system illustrates the concepts of <b>automatic</b> <b>document</b> <b>capture</b> and easy retrieval. Every document a user copies or prints is automatically indexed and saved for later retrieval. A prototype implementation of such a system was constructed and used daily by approximately 20 people for over two years. The design of this system is presented and experimental results are discussed. ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Automatic</b> <b>document</b> {{classification}} is {{of paramount}} importance to knowledge management in the information age. Document classification also poses many challenges for learning systems since the feature vector used to represent a <b>document</b> must <b>capture</b> some of the complex semantics of natural language.

50|$|Another {{category}} of document scanner is the <b>document</b> camera. <b>Capturing</b> images on <b>document</b> cameras {{differs from that}} of flatbed and <b>Automatic</b> <b>document</b> feeder (ADF) scanners in that there are no moving parts required to scan the object. Conventionally either the illumination/reflector rod inside the scanner must be moved over the document (such as for a flatbed scanner), or the document must be passed over the rod (such as for feeder scanners) in order to produce a scan of a whole image. <b>Document</b> cameras <b>capture</b> the whole <b>document</b> or object in one step, usually instantly. Typically, documents are placed on a flat surface, usually the office desk, underneath the capture area of the document camera. The process of whole-surface-at-once capturing has the benefit of increasing reaction time for the work flow of scanning. After being captured, the images are usually processed through software which may enhance the image and perform such tasks like automatically rotating, cropping and straightening them.|$|R
40|$|<b>Automatic</b> <b>Document</b> Classification that {{corresponds}} with user-predefined classes is a challenging and widely researched area. Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) are unsupervised Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) which are mathematically characterized by transforming high-dimensional data into two-dimension representation, enabling automatic clustering of the input, while preserving higher order topology. A closely related algorithm is the Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ), which uses supervised learning to maximize correct data classification. This study presents {{the application of}} SOM and LVQ to <b>automatic</b> <b>document</b> classification, based on predefined set of clusters. A set of documents, manually clustered by domain expert was used.

This study evaluates and compares the application of Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) and Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) to <b>automatic</b> <b>document</b> classification according to a subjectively predefined set of clusters in a specific domain, and assesses the effect of user inconsistency on this process. Results show that despite the subjective and inconsistent nature of human categorization, <b>automatic</b> <b>document</b> clustering methods correlate well with subjective, personal clustering. Moreover, adapting a system to its users is limited by users' inconsistency, meaning that a perfect adaptation is an impractical goal...|$|R

50|$|There are {{two kinds}} of {{document}} feeders capable of two-sided (duplex) scanning: a reversing <b>automatic</b> <b>document</b> feeder or RADF scans one side of a page, then flips it and scans the other side. A duplexing <b>automatic</b> <b>document</b> feeder or DADF scans both sides in one pass. The advantage of the DADF is faster speed for two-sided originals. RADFs and DADFs are rated in images per minute (IPM), the number of sides they can scan each minute; this may depend upon the resolution being used (rather than the maximum resolution supported).|$|R

We used a set of documents from an organization that was manually clustered by a domain expert.

Users reclassified the documents that were misclassified by the system. The reclassification process revealed an interesting pattern: about one third of the documents were classified according to their original classification, about one third according to the system's suggestions and one third got a different, new classification. Based on these results we conclude that automatic support for subjective categorization is feasible, and it can represent user inconsistent preferences with a precision level of up to 86 %...|$|R
