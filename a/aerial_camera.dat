He commented that while the video was an {{improvement}} since Cyrus's video for [...] "7 Things" [...] (2008), the settings in [...] "The Climb" [...] music video looked {{as though they had}} been painted by Thomas Kinkade and Cyrus's dancing appeared off-beat. Travis of MTV described the video as [...] "beautifully shot (although heavily digitized)". Lyndsey Parker of Yahoo! Music remarked that the summit setting was {{similar to that of the}} music video for Britney Spears' [...] "I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman". Parker also felt the scene in which Cyrus looks out over the cliff, shot using large sweeps with an <b>aerial</b> <b>camera,</b> had been [...] "lifted straight out of an '80s Bon Jovi video". In 2009, the video received a MuchMusic Video nomination for Best International Artist Video, but lost to Lady Gaga's music video for [...] "Poker Face".|$|E
500|$|U2 3D {{production}} {{featured the}} first 3D multiple-camera setup and was shot using every digital 3D camera and recording deck in existence. The crew had {{two days to}} set up the filming equipment before each concert, which required running optical fiber cables and hooking up an electrical generator to supply power at each venue. The filming equipment consisted of nine custom-built 3D rigs. The project's large scale prompted 3ality Digital to work with director James Cameron—their chief competitor at the time. 3ality used their own 3flex TS1 camera rigs for filming, in addition to five Fusion 3D rigs, designed by Cameron and camera operator Vincent Pace. [...] A total of 18 Sony CineAlta HDC-F950 cameras were used for filming, with two cameras on each rig. The cameras were fitted with Zeiss digital zoom lenses, making U2 3D the first 3D film shot using a zoom lens. One of the Fusion 3D camera rigs was used as a Spydercam and became the first 3D <b>aerial</b> <b>camera.</b> [...] The cameras on each rig were spaced eye-distance apart to create a 3D effect in post-production. Using a beam splitter mounted to the camera rig, one camera shot through a 50/50 mirror, while the other shot the image reflected from that mirror. Each rig weighed an average of [...] All of the concert footage was shot with twin-camera setups, except for the two Melbourne shoots, where a single CineAlta camera with a Steadicam was also used to capture close-ups. The cameras captured high-definition video onto HDCAMSR recording decks, which enabled the crew to capture an entire concert.|$|E

2500|$|Howard Cosell {{was widely}} {{attributed}} with saying the famous phrase [...] "the Bronx is burning". Cosell {{is credited with}} saying the quote during Game 2 of the 1977 World Series, {{which took place in}} Yankee Stadium on October 12, 1977. For a couple of years, fires had routinely erupted in the South Bronx, mostly due to low-value property owners setting their own properties ablaze for insurance money. During the bottom of the first inning, an ABC <b>aerial</b> <b>camera</b> panned a few blocks from Yankee Stadium to a building on fire, giving the world a real-life view of the infamous Bronx fires. The scene became a defining image of New York City in the 1970s. Cosell supposedly stated, [...] "There it is, ladies and gentlemen, The Bronx is burning." [...] This was later picked up by candidate Ronald Reagan, who then made a special trip to the Bronx, to illustrate the failures of then-day politicians to address the issues in that part of New York City.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{gives an}} {{introduction}} to the transfer function and the point spread function, then the considerations are extended to the analysis of the image noise and the dynamic range of digital images. In {{the last part of the}} paper a trial was made to determine these parameters for digital <b>aerial</b> <b>cameras</b> like the ADS 40 and the DMC, but also for medium format cameras (Hasselblad and Rollei) currently also used for aerial imaging. Additionally a comparison was made with digital orthophotos produced from high quality <b>aerial</b> film <b>cameras.</b> It seems that the medium format cameras have almost a higher image quality than the digital <b>aerial</b> <b>cameras,</b> as no resampling process is necessary to create the images used for further photogrammetric operations; however, the digital <b>aerial</b> <b>cameras</b> have a greater dynamic range. Fur-thermore, the digital <b>aerial</b> <b>cameras</b> have about double the swath width of the medium format cameras. Due to the low noise of the digital images, it might be useful to work with subsampled images in order to make full use of the high image quality. The practical investigations are based on a very limited number of images and should be refined. Never-theless, the high standard of digital imaging systems is self-evident compared to the results achieved with <b>aerial</b> film <b>cameras.</b> 1...|$|R

40|$|The Position and Orientation System for Direct Georeferencing (POS/DG) is an {{off-the-shelf}} integrated GPS/inertial {{system designed}} specifically for airborne applications. It performs high quality measurements of position and orientation of an airborne sensor. Using an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) as the primary sensor, POS/DG achieves measurement accuracies of about 10 to 20 cm (RMS) in position and 20 to 30 arc seconds (RMS) in attitude. POS/DG is used with airborne sensors requiring high-accuracy attitude measurements such as <b>aerial</b> <b>cameras,</b> multispectral scanners, laser scanners and digital <b>cameras.</b> For <b>aerial</b> <b>cameras,</b> POS/DG's performance enables the direct georeferencing of aerial photos to about 20 microns without aerial triangulation and ground control.
