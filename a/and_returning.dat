40|$|The {{impact of}} return {{interval}} selection (e. g., daily, weekly, or monthly) on {{the estimation of}} an asset's systematic risk (beta), total risk (variance), <b>and</b> <b>return</b> performance has received considerable attention in financial literature.

This is important, since for most public commodity funds, as well as hedge funds, returns are reported at most weekly and often only monthly.
