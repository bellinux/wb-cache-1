5|$|The Palace of Westminster, {{the medieval}} royal palace {{used as the}} home of the British parliament, was largely {{destroyed}} by fire on 16 October 1834. The blaze was caused by the burning of small wooden tally sticks which had been used as part of the <b>accounting</b> <b>procedures</b> of the Exchequer until 1826. The sticks were disposed of in a careless manner in the two furnaces under the House of Lords, which caused a chimney fire in the two flues that ran under the floor of the Lords' chamber and up through the walls.|$|E

Sony held out, and the trio walked away, with Sony suing the group for failure to complete their contract. The Chicks responded with their own $4.1-million lawsuit against Sony Music Entertainment on August 27, which added clout to claims made by singers Courtney Love, Aimee Mann, and LeAnn Rimes against the recording industry. After months of negotiation, the Chicks settled their suit privately, and were awarded their own record label imprint, Open Wide Records, which afforded them more control, a better contract, {{and an increase in}} royalty money, with Sony still responsible for marketing and distribution of albums.|$|E

Unlike the standard applied to unions' decisions concerning grievance handling and collective bargaining negotiations, the courts and the Board have regulated this area very extensively. They have specified the types of expenses that a union can include in the fees that it charges employees who choose not to join the union but are required to pay dues under an agency shop or union shop clause, the <b>accounting</b> <b>procedures</b> used to calculate those amounts, the procedures which the union and employees must follow if an individual worker objects to paying the full amount of dues or challenges the union's calculation of the lesser amount that non-members can be required to pay, and the procedures that the union must follow before it can force the employer to fire an employee for non-payment of dues. Even stricter standards are applied to unions covered by the Railway Labor Act and to unions of governmental employees on constitutional grounds.|$|E
25|$|Congress and the American {{states had}} {{no end of}} {{difficulty}} financing the war. In 1775 there was at most 12 million dollars in gold in the colonies, not nearly enough to cover existing transactions, let alone on a major war. The British made the situation much worse by imposing a tight blockade on every American port, which cut off almost all imports and exports. One partial solution was to rely on volunteer support from militiamen, and donations from patriotic citizens. Another was to delay actual payments, pay soldiers and suppliers in depreciated currency, and promise it would be made good after the war. Indeed, in 1783 the soldiers and officers were given land grants to cover the wages they had earned but had not been paid during the war. Not until 1781, when Robert Morris was named Superintendent of Finance of the United States, did the national government have a strong leader in financial matters. Morris used a French loan in 1782 {{to set up the}} private Bank of North America to finance the war. Seeking greater efficiency, Morris reduced the civil list, saved money by using competitive bidding for contracts, tightened <b>accounting</b> <b>procedures,</b> and demanded the federal government's full share of money and supplies from the states.|$|E
25|$|Set goals: Groups {{that set}} clear, {{challenging}} goals outperform groups whose members have {{lost sight of}} their objectives. The group's goals should be relatively challenging, instead of being too easily accomplished. The advantages of working in a group are often lost when a task is so easy {{that it can be}} accomplished even when members of the group socially loaf. Thus, groups should ensure to set their standards high, but not so high that the goals are unattainable. Latham and Baldes (1975) assessed the practical significance of Locke's theory of goal setting by conducting an experiment with truck drivers who hauled logs from the woods to the mill. When the men were initially told to do their best when loading the logs, they carried only about 60% of the weight that they could legally haul. When the same drivers were later encouraged to reach a goal of hauling 94% of the legal limit, they increased their efficiency and met this specific goal. Thus, {{the results of this study}} show that performance improved immediately upon the assignment of a specific, challenging goal. Company cost <b>accounting</b> <b>procedures</b> indicated that this same increase in performance without goal setting would have required an expenditure of a quarter of a million dollars on the purchase of additional trucks alone. So this method of goal setting is extremely effective. Other research has found that clear goals can stimulate a number of other performance-enhancing processes, including increases in effort, better planning, more accurate monitoring of the quality of the groups work, and even an increased commitment to the group.|$|E

40|$|This {{internship}} {{report is}} submitted in a partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Business Administration, 2014. Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Disability will always remain in Bangladeshi society, with the entire social stigma attached to it. But in the backdrop of all the problems involved, the silver lining {{is that the government}} is showing an increasing interest on persons with disabilities, and a keen interest to work hand-in-hand with the non- governmental sector. But to make real progress in this field in a developing country like Bangladesh, an all-out effort from all quarters is mandatory. The persons with disabilities themselves, their organizations, other organizations working in this field, and all the advocacy platforms need to increase their awareness campaigns for the prevention of disability and for the recognition of the rights and privileges of persons with disabilities as equal citizens of this country. Bangladesh Protibondhi Foundation is an organization which has been providing integrated services for the marginalized children, children with disabilities which nearly covers the important categories of the rights enshrined in the CRC i. e. survival, development, protection and participation. Integrated services of Bangladesh Protibondhi Foundation helps the children to improvement their functional, educational, health, nutritional, vocational and social areas.

500|$|Since {{medieval times}} the Exchequer had used tally sticks, pieces of carved, notched wood, {{normally}} willow, {{as part of}} their <b>accounting</b> <b>procedures.</b> [...] The parliamentary historian Caroline Shenton has described the tally sticks as [...] "roughly as long as the span of an index finger and thumb". These sticks were split in two so that the two sides to an agreement had a record of the situation. Once the purpose of each tally had come to an end, they were routinely destroyed. By {{the end of the eighteenth}} century the usefulness of the tally system had likewise come to an end, and a 1782 Act of Parliament stated that all records should be on paper, not tallies. The Act also abolished sinecure positions in the Exchequer, but a clause in the act ensured it could only take effect once the remaining sinecure-holders had died or retired. The final sinecure-holder died in 1826 and the act came into force, although it took until 1834 for the antiquated procedures to be replaced. The novelist Charles Dickens, in a speech to the Administrative Reform Association, described the retention of the tallies for so long as an [...] "obstinate adherence to an obsolete custom"; he also mocked the bureaucratic steps needed to implement change from wood to paper. He said that [...] "all the red tape in the country grew redder at the bare mention of this bold and original conception." [...] By the time the replacement process had finished there were two cart-loads of old tally sticks awaiting disposal.|$|E

40|$|Compared {{with the}} {{manufacturing}} sector, {{the construction industry}} suffers from relatively lower productivity, although some attempts are being made to overcome low construction productivity by introducing manufacturing-based concepts to the construction industry. The just-in-time (JIT) concept {{is one of the}} manufacturing-based concepts introduced to streamline construction operations and help raise productivity in the industry. The fundamental philosophy of JIT is to eliminate wastes from delays, transportation, unnecessary processing and unnecessary motion. This is because any activities which do not add value to a process are considered wasteful. Construction productivity therefore can be enhanced if these activities are eliminated. This paper presents an <b>accounting</b> <b>procedure</b> for measuring JIT wastes. The case study of a private condominium project, where this <b>accounting</b> <b>procedure</b> was applied, shows that indeed JIT wastes can be identified and eliminated to raise construction productivity.
