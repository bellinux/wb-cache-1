50|$|Fox Talbot had {{developed}} the calotype process and patented it in 1841 to run until 1855. By 1852, {{many in the}} photographic community felt that Fox Talbot's insistence on the economic rights in his intellectual property were hampering the development of photography in England and had called upon him to relinquish his patent. He had made a concession by allowing a free license to amateur photographers but he still insisted that professionals pay an <b>annual</b> <b>license</b> <b>fee.</b> The situation was exacerbated by Fox Talbot's insistence that Frederick Scott Archer's collodion process was covered by his patent. The collodion process was widely used and there was grievous disquiet among the professional photographic community at the payment of a license to Fox Talbot, rather than Archer, for its use.|$|E

In the autumn of 2015 the government announced that it planned {{to change the way}} NRK is financed. This is in part a reaction to the decline of TV ownership in Norway. Some kind of [...] "media charge" [...] is planned, but it is not yet clear how such a system would work. The feeling is that the current license system is not sustainable in the long term.|$|E
50|$|Cars are {{subjected}} to a first-time registration tax, which varies from 35% to over 100%, based on the size and value of the car. The level of vehicle taxation was increased by a law passed on 2 June 1982 to discourage private car ownership, and also as an incentive to buy smaller, more efficient cars, as these have less tax levied on them. First-time registration tax was doubled, <b>annual</b> <b>licensing</b> <b>fees</b> were increased by 300%, and $0.7 duty was imposed on each litre of on light oils.|$|R

50|$|The problems, {{the visits}} of envoys, the {{interference}} of authorities from the Mint of France, {{and the aforementioned}} ruling led the three partners to justly conclude that their days were numbered and that the mints in Pau, MorlaÃ s and Saint-Palais were indeed doomed for closure, or at best be put to auction in Paris. Nevertheless, for political reasons, the Chambre des Comptes de Pau was not predisposed to grant the partners a termination of their lease since it {{would result in a}} loss of resources for the province. Considering these circumstances, the partners decided to address themselves to the King's Counsel to obtain the termination of their lease and financial relief. On 22 February 1663, the Counsel issued a final ruling declaring the license to Daniel d'Aripe null and void, retroactively to 30 June 1662, and relieving the partners of the payment of the <b>annual</b> <b>license</b> <b>fee</b> of 11,100 livres, therewith ending the venture.|$|E

50|$|A 2000 {{government}} decree requires potential commercial radio broadcasters {{to submit}} a licensing application, pay a fee when the application is approved, and pay an <b>annual</b> <b>licensing</b> <b>fee.</b> The Government has been slow in granting authorization; consequently, there are many unauthorized radio stations operating. Two private religious radio stations, the Pentecostal Radio Bonne Nouvelle and Radio Reine (managed by a Catholic priest although not officially sponsored by the Catholic Church), that had been broadcasting without licenses continued to broadcast while awaiting official authorization, as do many other radio stations awaiting their licenses. The Catholic station Radio Veritas has temporary authorization to broadcast and has been broadcasting without incident.|$|R
50|$|The {{years that}} {{followed}} were crucial for both the College and the pharmacy profession. Concerns surrounding the safety and ethics of pharmacy practice emerged. Nationwide efforts sprang forth to develop laws regulating the profession. By 1880, the College had been instrumental in forming the Illinois Pharmaceutical Association (now known as the Illinois Pharmacists Association). A year later, the Pharmacy Law of 1881 was passed, mandating education requirements {{for the practice of}} pharmacy in Illinois and assigning supervision of the professional to state agencies. Candidates were required to pass an examination given by the State Board of Health. The law also required pharmacists to pay a $2 <b>annual</b> <b>licensing</b> <b>fee.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A second {{country which}} quickly adopted network {{programming}} was the United Kingdom, and its national network, {{quickly became a}} prototype for a state-managed monopoly of broadcasting. A rising interest in radio broadcasting by the British public pressured the government to reintroduce the service, following its suspension in 1920. However, the government also wanted to avoid what it termed the [...] "chaotic" [...] U.S. experience of allowing large numbers of stations to operate with few restrictions. There were also concerns about broadcasting becoming dominated by the Marconi company. [...] Arrangements were made for six large radio manufacturers to form a consortium, the British Broadcasting Company (BBC), established on 18 October 1922, which was given a monopoly on broadcasting. This enterprise {{was supported by a}} tax on radio sets sales, plus an <b>annual</b> <b>license</b> <b>fee</b> on receivers, collected by the Post Office. Initially the eight stations were allowed regional autonomy. In 1927, the original broadcasting organization was replaced by a government chartered British Broadcasting Corporation. an independent nonprofit supported solely by a 10 shilling receiver license fee. A mixture of populist and high brow programmes were carried by the National and Regional networks.|$|E
5000|$|The Gympie Municipal Council first {{introduced}} by-laws {{relating to the}} erection and maintenance of earth closets in 1883. Initially only {{certain areas of the}} municipality (including Mary Street) were required to conform to provisions. In areas where earth closets were made mandatory, pit systems were filled in and existing toilets were required to be rebuilt or altered. Each earth closet was fitted with a box or other vessel [...] "for the reception of nightsoil or other filth" [...] and placed conveniently for removal. Earth closets were also required to be furnished with [...] "a suitable receptacle for the storage of a quantity of dry earth for deodorising purposes". People engaged in the removal of nightsoil were required to pay an <b>annual</b> <b>license</b> <b>fee</b> and could only operate between eleven at night to five in the morning. From 1885 the council operated its own nightsoil service. By 1894 the whole of the municipality was under the provisions of the by-laws. In 1895, the by-laws were further extended and every nightman was required to keep a register of all premises visited, to be submitted monthly to the council inspector. Nightsoil service charges at this time were one shilling and six pence for a single pan and one shilling and three pence for additional pans.|$|E
