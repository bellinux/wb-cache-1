5|$|Homosexual men {{tended to}} have had their first {{homosexual}} encounter at a younger age, <b>and</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to have their first encounters with friends or acquaintances rather than strangers. The data {{did not support the}} idea that homosexual males are likely to have been seduced by older men. Homosexual activity involving genital contact in childhood was connected to adult homosexuality, though only weakly; homosexual arousal during childhood or adolescence was a stronger predictor of adult homosexuality. Heterosexual arousal during childhood was a moderate predictor of adult heterosexuality. Phenomena associated with sexual maturation, such as the age of first ejaculation, {{did not seem to be}} important, and neither did parental attitudes toward sex. Respondents' opportunities to engage in sex with persons of the opposite or the same sex did not seem to be an important influence on the sexual preference they developed, and sexual experiences with persons of both the same and the opposite sex were common among both homosexuals and heterosexuals. Sexual feelings appeared to be more important than sexual behavior as an indicator of adult sexual preference.|$|E
5|$|The {{program had}} some loose ends that {{manifested}} themselves later. Many refugees were not economically integrated and lived from government handouts. Critics {{noted that the}} refugees had become a special interest group that fostered resentment. The COMIGAL officials often decided not to split up refugees belonging to the same village, hoping to maintain social continuity. In some cases, Catholic priests refused to obey government directives to settle in certain areas. Many of the refugees also refused to relocate from the camps {{on the outskirts of}} the capital, wanting to live an urban lifestyle, and objecting to Diem's desire that they help developed inhospitable frontier territory where disease was more common and the economy less developed. On occasions, the reluctance to disperse away from Saigon resulted in protests outside Diem's residence. Many Catholic villages were effectively transplanted into southern territory. This was efficient in the short run but meant that they would never assimilate into southern society. They had little contact with the Buddhist majority and often held them in contempt, sometimes flying the Vatican flag instead of the national flag. Peter Hansen, an Australian Catholic priest and academic scholar of religion, has added that tensions between northern and southern Catholics were also present, due to issues of regionalism and local traditions. Hansen also said that northern Catholics took a more defensive attitude towards other religions than their southern co-religionists, <b>and</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to see non-Catholics as a threat. He further noted that northern Catholics had a more theocratic outlook in that they were more willing to listen to the advice of priests on a wide range of issues, not only spiritual and ecclesiastical matters. These differences and the sense of segregation persist to the current day.|$|E

25|$|A {{relationship}} between the early experiences and environment of boys, and their later sexual behaviour, has been drawn by several studies. Research suggests that father absence can {{lead to an increase}} in rape behaviour. Research conducted by Malamuth found that men raised in the absence of their father (or where resources were scarce) reported more use of sexual coercion in the past, <b>and</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to indicate being more willing to rape, in the event that there was no chance of them getting caught. Research has also found that parental divorce and rape correlate positively.|$|E
25|$|As {{mounting}} evidence, {{from all}} sorts of intelligence sources and from observation of ground movements, indicated that the Germans were suffering desperate local shortages, the tactical air forces intensified their attacks on oil trains and storage dumps near the front lines. The Eighth and Fifteenth Air Forces showed improvement {{in the use of}} H2X radar devices, and RAF Bomber Command was employing Gee-H to better advantage as its crews became more experienced. It was discovered that synthetic oil plants lent themselves to successful air attacks more easily than oil refineries, since the former could be put out of action by relatively small damage to critical parts of their complicated machinery. Furthermore, the synthetic plants were much larger than the refineries <b>and</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to appear on radar screens because they usually stood some distance outside of cities. The 15AF sharply raised its level of accuracy and developed techniques, {{such as the use of}} diamond-shaped formations, which ensured more safety for the bombers as well as greater precision in attack.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{inspired}} {{a couple of}} academic case studies. [...] The first was a George Washington University School of Public Health and Health Services case study {{about the effects of}} television writers consulting medical professionals on the storyline of a television episode. [...] Participants in a survey conducted by the University of Southern California and Purdue University felt that a black market for organs existed and that a person's place on the organ priority list can be influenced by money or fame. [...] They, as a result of [...] "Harvest", also were more likely to become organ donors or to consider doing so. [...] The second case study was about TV's influence on the discussion of organ donations. [...] Participants in a Hollywood Health & Society online survey {{were also more likely to}} believe in the existence of black-market organ trafficking <b>and</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to donate organs after watching [...] "Harvest".

500|$|Homosexual {{women were}} more likely to {{describe}} their relationships with their mothers as negative, and their mothers as having been hostile or rejecting. These measures were combined into a single measure, [...] "Hostile-Rejecting Mother", which appeared to have only minimal influence on the development of sexual preference. Homosexual women were less likely to describe their mothers as having been pleasant people. This and two other connected variables were combined into a composite measure called [...] "Unpleasant Mother", which had a weak and indirect connection with adult homosexuality. Homosexual women identified less strongly with their mothers, though this appeared to have very little influence on adult sexual preference, having only indirect effects, dependent upon its encouragement of childhood gender nonconformity. Homosexual women gave less favorable descriptions of their relationships with their fathers, <b>and</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to have negative feelings toward them, and to describe them as having been hostile or detached. These variables were combined into a measure called [...] "Detached-Hostile Father", which appeared to encourage childhood gender nonconformity and adolescent homosexual involvement. Homosexual women were less likely to identify with their fathers, but the [...] "Identification with Father" [...] variable appeared to be unimportant.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} types of triglyceride, with the main division between saturated and unsaturated types. Saturated fats are [...] "saturated" [...] with hydrogen - all available places where hydrogen atoms could be bonded to carbon atoms are occupied. These have a higher melting point <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to <b>be</b> solid at room temperature. Unsaturated fats have double bonds between some of the carbon atoms, reducing the number of places where hydrogen atoms can bond to carbon atoms.

2500|$|During the 20th century, as {{many women}} became better educated and more able to support themselves, fewer women found {{satisfaction}} {{in the position of}} being a mistress <b>and</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to be in relationships with unmarried men. As divorce became more socially acceptable, it was easier for men to divorce their wives and marry the women who, in earlier years, might have been their mistresses. The practice of having a mistress continued among some married men, especially the wealthy. Occasionally, men married their mistresses. The late Sir James Goldsmith, on marrying his mistress, Lady Annabel Birley, declared, [...] "When you marry your mistress, you create a job vacancy".|$|E
2500|$|Impulsivity is {{also related}} to the abstinence, relapse, and {{treatment}} stages of substance abuse. [...] People who scored high on the Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS) {{were more likely to}} stop treatment for cocaine abuse. [...] Additionally, they adhered to treatment for a shorter duration than people that scored low on impulsivity. [...] Also, impulsive people had greater cravings for drugs during withdrawal periods <b>and</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to relapse. [...] This effect was shown in a study where smokers that test high on the BIS had increased craving in response to smoking cues, and gave into the cravings more quickly than less impulsive smokers. [...] Taken as a whole the current research suggests that impulsive individuals are less likely to abstain from drugs and more likely to relapse earlier than less impulsive individuals.|$|E
2500|$|Beginning in the 1830s, the Dog Soldiers {{had evolved}} from a Cheyenne {{military}} society of that name into a separate band of Cheyenne and Lakota warriors. [...] They took as their territory {{the area around the}} headwaters of the Republican and Smoky Hill rivers in southern Nebraska, northern Kansas, and the northeastern Colorado Territory. By the 1860s, as conflict between Indians and encroaching whites intensified, the Dog Soldiers and military societies within other Cheyenne bands countered the influence of the traditional Council of Forty-Four chiefs who, as more mature men, took a larger view <b>and</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to favor peace with the whites. To the Dog Soldiers, the Sand Creek massacre illustrated the folly of the peace chiefs' policy of accommodating the whites through treaties such as the first Treaty of Fort Laramie and the Treaty of Fort Wise. They believed their militant position toward the whites was justified by the massacre.|$|E

2500|$|In the paper, Morewedge and Norton (2009) {{also found}} that people {{attribute}} more importance to dream content than to similar thought content that occurs while they are awake. In one study, Americans {{were more likely to}} report that they would miss their flight if they dreamt of their plane crashing than if they thought of their plane crashing the night before flying (while awake), and that they would be as likely to miss their flight if they dreamt of their plane crashing the night before their flight as if there was an actual plane crash on the route they intended to take. [...] Not all dream content was considered equally important. Participants in their studies were more likely to perceive dreams to be meaningful when the content of dreams was in accordance with their beliefs and desires while awake. People were more likely to view a positive dream about a friend to be meaningful than a positive dream about someone they disliked, for example, <b>and</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to view a negative dream about a person they disliked as meaningful than a negative dream about a person they liked.|$|E
2500|$|Ultimately, in {{response}} to traffic and parking issues associated with these games (while Cal games drew {{a large number of}} students who live on or near campus and walk to the games, Raider games attracted fans from a larger geographic area who were used to tailgating at the Coliseum <b>and</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to drive to games), the City of Berkeley passed a Professional Sports Events License Tax in which the city collected 10% of all gate receipts, making the staging of professional games inside the city cost-prohibitive. [...] The Raiders were granted an injunction from the city collecting the tax, arguing that the tax was a regulatory measure rather than a revenue measure, and was therefore an improper regulation on land held in trust by the Regents of the University of California. [...] However, the grant of the injunction was reversed by the California Court of Appeals, who found it to be a revenue measure, {{despite the fact that the}} city had made the measure immediately effective [...] "due to danger to the public peace, health, and safety of the City of Berkeley as a result of the holding of professional sports events there." ...|$|E
2500|$|Adults' own {{understanding}} of maternal sensitivity affects their sensitivity towards their own children. Adults who had insensitive mothers during [...] infancy {{were found to}} {{not be able to}} remember specific childhood events or their importance. They were not able to present an accurate description of their parents by use of memories, they were found to idealize experiences {{and are more likely to}} remember situations in which they were rejected. Adults who experienced higher maternal sensitivity during both infancy and adulthood were found to be less dismissive and more secure than those who did not. Adults who are preoccupied were found to also try to please their parents as they were young, and have a sense of anger towards them. About half of the adults who were found more preoccupied than others were found to have experienced divorce between their parents earlier in life, as well as other negative life events such as death of a parent or sexual abuse. These life events cause the security of attachment between mother and child to decrease as the mother's availability, as well as responsiveness may decrease, no matter the maternal sensitivity experienced prior to these events. Male adults were found to have experienced less maternal sensitivity earlier in life than females <b>and</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to be classified as dismissive than females were.|$|E
