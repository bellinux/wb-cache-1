The video begins by showing Wade sitting alone on a bed, with {{pictures}} of him and his girlfriend on the wall.

Near the end things begin going in reverse, <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> had exploded is put back together.

25|$|The Abu Ghraib {{prison in}} the town of Abu Ghraib {{was one of the most}} notorious prisons in Iraq during the {{government}} of Saddam Hussein.

After the collapse of Saddam Hussein's government, the prison was looted <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> was removable was carried away. Following the invasion, the U.S. army refurbished it and turned it into a military prison. It was the largest of several detention centers in Iraq used by the U.S. military.

25|$|Vaisheshika espouses {{a form of}} atomism, {{that the}} reality is {{composed}} of four substances (earth, water, air, fire). Each of these four are of two types, explains Ganeri, atomic (paramāṇu) and composite. An atom is that which is indestructible (anitya), indivisible, and has {{a special kind of}} dimension, called “small” (aṇu). A composite is that which is divisible into atoms. Whatever human beings perceive is composite, and even the smallest perceptible thing, namely, a fleck of dust, has parts, which are therefore invisible. The Vaiśeṣikas visualized the smallest composite thing as a “triad” (tryaṇuka) with three parts, each part with a “dyad” (dyaṇuka). Vaiśeṣikas believed that a dyad has two parts, each of which is an atom. Size, form, truths <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> human beings experience as a whole is a function of atoms, their number and their spatial arrangements.|$|E
