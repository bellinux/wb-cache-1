5|$|From {{the early}} 1980s, Khoo tried {{to pursue a}} Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree from various universities, {{but all of them}} {{rejected}} his application as he did not possess a first degree for admission. Khoo only had two professional diplomas – a Diploma in <b>Administrative</b> <b>Management</b> and a Certified Diploma in Accounting and Finance from ACCA. He finally received an unconditional offer from the University of Stirling after he impressed the visiting Director of the MBA programme showing how he managed the award-winning shopping mall. In 1989, accompanied by his wife, he left Malaysia to pursue his MBA studies in Scotland and graduated with Distinction in 1991. Instead of returning to Malaysia, he went to Singapore again to seek better opportunities there and was offered the job as Director of Operations for Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC).|$|E

In 1913 an anonymous correspondent to the New Age journal described the mis-administration of W.

The chancellor also serves as chairperson of the university council, an internal coordinating body composed of the chancellor himself, the university registrar who serves as secretary, and the professorial faculty. The vice chancellor for academic affairs, on the other hand, assists the chancellor in coordinating curricular, instructional, library, and other programs of the university. The vice chancellor for administration assists the chancellor in the <b>administrative</b> <b>management</b> of the campus. The vice chancellor for community affairs assists the chancellor in promoting relationships within the university and in dealing with local government and safety issues, while the vice chancellor for research & development assists the chancellor in formulating guidelines and criteria for the university's research and development endeavors.

2500|$|Usually sorted by year, one Student Department {{currently}} has 6 (SFB A and B) or 8 (C) [...] "Studentenfachbereichsgruppen" [...] (SFBG) or Student Department Groups, headed by an army Captain or a naval Captain Lieutenant. In {{the course of}} the reforms of army training and the correspondingly higher student numbers in 2007 and 2008, 2 more group leaders per Student Department were added for the period 2007-2011, which meant an increase from 4 to 6, or 6 to 8 for SFB C. The staff-student ratio is currently at around 140 to 180 studying officers and officer candidates per group leader.

2500|$|On March 22, 1936, Roosevelt {{established}} the Committee on <b>Administrative</b> <b>Management</b> (commonly {{known as the}} Brownlow Committee) and charged it with developing proposals for reorganizing the executive branch. The three-person committee consisted of Louis Brownlow, Charles Merriam, and Luther Gulick. Gulick's POSDCORB served as the basis and framing idea and not all parts of their team's research was used. [...] Their work revealed a profound constitutional understanding and confidence, not only about improving public management, but how to improve democracy within the American administrative state. [...] On January 8, 1937, the Committee released its report. Famously declaring [...] "The President needs help," [...] the Committee's report advocated a strong chief executive, including among its 37 recommendations significant expansion of the presidential staff, integration of managerial agencies into a single presidential office, expansion of the merit system, integration of all independent agencies into existing Cabinet departments, and modernization of federal accounting and financial practices.|$|E

2500|$|Since gaining {{its first}} chapter in 1874, Minnesota administrators have {{maintained}} an open, {{if not always}} supportive relationship with its chapters [...] An impulse to exert <b>administrative</b> <b>management</b> on these highly visible registered student organizations has at times been offset by interest in limiting liability exposure where it could be claimed that the administration was responsible but did not do enough to prevent an unsafe or illegal occurrence. Minnesota's Greek System has, on balance, avoided the frequency of harmful events, as have occurred at other large schools; this primarily {{as the result of}} self-policing. The original, more active relationship between the Greeks and the Administration had been marginalized somewhat after the turbulent late 1960s and during the lassaiz-faire commuter-student years of 1970–90. This coincided with national scrutiny and bad publicity over hazing events elsewhere in the US. With the return to a more residential campus, both the Minnesota Greek System and its relationship with the University are thriving: An estimated 2,800 Greeks on campus participate in 58 separate undergraduate Academic and Social chapters. In addition, Professional and honor societies, many accepting undergraduates, number more than 80. Because of this and other factors, the University is again improving its relationship with the Greek Community: [...] "In March 2012, President Kaler announced the formation of a Greek Community Strategic Task Force (GCSTF) and issued a Charge to the GCSTF Steering Committee which emphasized the need to develop a “sustainable and robust relationship between the University and the Greek community.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Merriam {{believed}} {{that part of}} {{the success or failure of}} the National Planning Board's proposals depended on the administrative capacity of the executive branch to adopt and push for the recommended policies. Therefore, Merriam began lobbying President Roosevelt for a commission to study the structure and functions of the executive. Roosevelt was very receptive to the idea. [...] The Supreme Court had struck down the National Industrial Recovery Act (a key legislative accomplishment of the New Deal) in Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495 (1935), and significantly limited the president's power to remove members of independent executive agencies in Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan, 293 U.S. 388 (1935). Merriam assured the president that if he established a committee to review the administration of the executive branch, the committee's report could be written in such a way as to justify the president's reorganization goals while couching them in the neutral language of academic research. On March 22, 1936, Roosevelt established the Committee on <b>Administrative</b> <b>Management</b> (commonly known as the Brownlow Committee) and charged it with developing proposals for reorganizing the executive branch. Besides himself, the three-person committee consisted of Louis Brownlow, and Luther Gulick. On January 10, 1937, the Committee released its report. Famously declaring [...] "The President needs help," [...] the Committee's report advocated a strong chief executive, including among its 37 recommendations significant expansion of the presidential staff, integration of managerial agencies into a single presidential office, expansion of the merit system, integration of all independent agencies into existing Cabinet departments, and modernization of federal accounting and financial practices.|$|E
