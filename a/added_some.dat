5|$|In 2000, Kalmus Music Publishers {{brought out}} an edition where former Philadelphia Orchestra {{librarian}} Clint Nieweg made over 21,000 corrections to the score and parts.

5|$|In London Smith {{tended to}} neglect the zoological {{parts of the}} collection, he <b>added</b> <b>some</b> {{specimens}} and also gave some specimens away. Over the following centuries the Linnean collection in London suffered enormously {{at the hands of}} scientists who studied the collection, and in the process disturbed the original arrangement and labels, added specimens that did not belong to the original series and withdrew precious original type material.|$|E

5|$|There {{were many}} more systems added with the time, like the Atlis II in the French {{aircraft}}, and, in 1994–95, some GR1s had laser-designator systems fitted. Missiles like AS-30 {{and even the}} anti-ship Sea Eagle were <b>added.</b> <b>Some</b> IAF aircraft had the Agave radar system, purpusely for maritime strike. India later developed the DARIN system in its Jaguar fleet, with a modern 1553 databus.|$|E
5|$|Charles Messier {{measured}} {{the position of}} the cluster and included it as M45 in his catalogue of comet-like objects, published in 1771. Along with the Orion Nebula and the Praesepe cluster, Messier's inclusion of the Pleiades has been noted as curious, as most of Messier's objects were much fainter and more easily confused with comets—something that seems scarcely possible for the Pleiades. One possibility is that Messier simply wanted to have a larger catalogue than his scientific rival Lacaille, whose 1755 catalogue contained 42 objects, and so he <b>added</b> <b>some</b> bright, well-known objects to boost his list.|$|E
5|$|However, Paramount {{rejected}} the track, believing that Leonard {{was incapable of}} creating the score for the film. Leonard later presented the instrumental to Madonna, who decided {{to use it for}} At Close Range, the new film starring her then-husband, actor Sean Penn. Madonna wrote all the lyrics, <b>added</b> <b>some</b> melodies to the composition, and recorded a demo on a cassette. She presented the track to the film's director James Foley, who liked it and enlisted Leonard to compose the film's score, as suggested by Madonna.|$|E

5|$|Luis Gómez, an El Pais writer, {{believed}} that the route was designed to benefit the Italian participants, with there being three individual time trials, the team time trial being flat, and most stages being primarily flat. El Mundo writer Javier Dalmases {{believed that}} the route was purposefully less mountainous so that an Italian would win the race, citing that this route favored the likes of Giuseppe Saronni or Moreno Argentin. La Stampas Gian Paolo Ormezzano thought overall easiness of the course — the few mountains and summit finishes — <b>added</b> <b>some</b> mystery as to who could win.|$|E
5|$|StarCraft {{focuses around}} three {{distinct}} interstellar species: the psionic Protoss, the adaptable Terrans, and the insectoid Zerg. The game revolves around players collecting resources {{to construct a}} base, upgrade their militaries, and ultimately conquer opponents. Brood Wars gameplay remains fundamentally unchanged from that of StarCraft, although it made small alterations to unit costs and some abilities, and <b>added</b> <b>some</b> new units. These changes make rushing tactics—a factor that gained some criticism in the original StarCraft—less practical. The single-player campaign has an increased difficulty; missions are no longer entirely linear, and a greater focus on strategy is needed to complete missions. In addition, the game's artificial intelligence (AI) has been augmented so that AI-controlled players are more intelligent and tend to use tactics more effectively.|$|E
5|$|The {{entrance}} hall was flanked {{on either side}} by similarly sized rooms probably accessible from the central courtyard. The one on the west contained washing facilities and a gutter leading to a soak-away in {{the central part of}} the building, the room to the east may possibly have been a guardroom. On the western side of the courtyard were three small rooms which opened out onto the central colonnade at ground level. The function of these rooms is uncertain, but they were probably used as private accommodation for users of the mansio. The largest room in the mansio lay in the north-east corner, the chamber was heated by a channelled hypocaust system <b>added</b> <b>some</b> time after the building was first completed.|$|E

5|$|The lead {{would be}} {{augmented}} {{in the sixth}} when Carl Crawford hit a line drive that just cleared the right field wall for a home run. Though it appeared a fan may have reached over the wall to catch it, NL manager Tony La Russa did not challenge the umpires' call. The NL got a run back {{in the bottom of}} the inning when Carlos Beltrán led off with a triple and scored on a sacrifice fly by Griffey. The AL <b>added</b> <b>some</b> insurance runs in the eighth when Víctor Martínez hit a two-run home run just inside the left field foul pole to give the AL a 5–2 lead.|$|E
5|$|The work is scored for vocal soloists (soprano, alto, tenor and bass), a four-part choir SATB, and an {{orchestra}} of two flauto traverso (Ft), two oboes (Ob), two oboes da caccia (Oc), two oboes d'amore (Oa), two violins, viola (Va), and basso continuo. Bach <b>added</b> <b>some</b> instruments which were already old-fashioned {{at the time}} in arias for special effects, such as the archlute, the viola d'amore and the viola da gamba (Vg). Bach did not differentiate the vox Christi (voice of Christ), singing the words of Jesus, from the other bass recitatives and arias, nor the evangelist from the tenor arias.|$|E
5|$|Aerosmith {{commenced}} {{recording a}} new album on Armed Forces Day 2006. Tyler and Perry performed with the Boston Pops Orchestra for their annual concert of July 4 on the Esplanade in 2006, a milestone {{as it was the}} first major event or performance since Steven Tyler's throat surgery. Around this time, the band also announced that they would embark on the Route of All Evil Tour with Mötley Crüe in late 2006. On August 24, 2006 it was announced that Tom Hamilton was undergoing treatment for throat cancer. In order to make a full recovery, he sat out much of the Route of All Evil Tour until he was well again. Former Joe Perry Project bassist David Hull substituted for Hamilton until his return. On September 5, 2006, Aerosmith kicked off the Route of All Evil Tour with Mötley Crüe in Columbus, Ohio. The co-headlining tour took both bands to amphitheaters across North America through November 24. After that, a select few arena dates were <b>added,</b> <b>some</b> of which were with Mötley Crüe. The tour ended December 17.|$|E

5|$|As the Tairona of the Colombian Caribbean coast, the Muisca {{made the}} zoomorphic figurines {{based on the}} fauna with their habitat of the area. Main animals used for their figures were the frog and serpents. The serpents were made in zig-zag shapes with eyes {{on top of the}} head. Many serpentiform objects have the typical forked tongue of the snake {{represented}} as well as the fawns clearly <b>added.</b> <b>Some</b> of the snakes have beards, moustaches or even a human head. Researcher Gerardo Reichel-Dolmatoff theorised in his book Orfebrería y chamanismo in 1988 that the basis for the beards and moustaches may have been the abundant fish present on the Altiplano and essential part of the diet of the Muisca and their ancestors, as evidenced in Aguazuque; Eremophilus mutisii.|$|E
5|$|During the 2008–09 season, {{after much}} waiting, Greg Oden debuted with the Blazers, playing in 61 games. Portland also <b>added</b> <b>some</b> {{international}} flavor {{to the team}} with the arrival of Spanish swingman Rudy Fernández, a member of the Spanish national basketball team. French-native Nicolas Batum emerged as a skilled defensive forward who was inserted into the starting lineup as a rookie. Roy appeared in his second-straight All-Star Game, and Fernández competed in the Sprite Slam Dunk Contest during NBA All-Star Weekend. Roy had a career-high 52 points against the Phoenix Suns and game-winning shots against the Houston Rockets and New York Knicks. The Blazers clinched a playoff berth {{for the first time since}} 2003 and achieved a 54–28 record, their first winning record since the 2002–03 season. As the fourth seed and holding home court advantage, the Trail Blazers played the fifth-seeded Houston Rockets in the 2009 Playoffs, losing the playoff series 4 games to 2.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte met by 24 April 1879 to {{make plans}} for a {{production}} of Pinafore in America. Carte travelled to New York {{in the summer of}} 1879 and made arrangements with theatre manager John T. Ford to present, at the Fifth Avenue Theatre, the first authorised American production of Pinafore. In November, Carte returned to America with Gilbert, Sullivan and a company of strong singers, including J. H. Ryley as Sir Joseph, Blanche Roosevelt as Josephine, Alice Barnett as Little Buttercup, Furneaux Cook as Dick Deadeye, Hugh Talbot as Ralph Rackstraw and Jessie Bond as Cousin Hebe. To these, he <b>added</b> <b>some</b> American singers, including Signor Brocolini as Captain Corcoran. Alfred Cellier came to assist Sullivan, while his brother François remained in London to conduct Pinafore there.|$|E
