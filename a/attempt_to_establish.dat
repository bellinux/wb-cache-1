5|$|Not all {{relations}} between Egypt {{and its neighbors}} were peaceful during Djedkare's reign. In particular, {{one of the earliest}} known depictions of a battle or city being besieged is found in the tomb of Inti, an official from the 21st nome of Upper Egypt, who lived during the late Fifth Dynasty. The scene shows Egyptian soldiers scaling the walls of a near eastern fortress on ladders. More generally, ancient Egyptians seem to have regularly organised punitive raids in Canaan during the later Old Kingdom period but did not <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> a permanent dominion there.|$|E

5|$|There {{were now}} four claimants to {{jurisdiction}} over Honduras. González Dávila held royal {{authority over the}} province. Pedrarias claimed jurisdiction by right of the expeditions he had sent under Soto and Hernández de Córdoba. Hernán Cortés claimed jurisdiciton by right of the expedition he had sent under Olid, and Olid himself. A fifth claimant would eventually appear {{in the form of}} the Real Audiencia of Santo Domingo, which would <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> its own direct political control over the province. These rival claimants inevitably produced treachery, conflict, and outright civil war among the Spanish factions.|$|E
5|$|Between 1969 and 1972, as he {{was working}} on The Nomadic Alternative, Chatwin {{travelled}} extensively and pursued other endeavours in an <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> a creative career. He co-curated an exhibit on Nomadic Art of the Asian Steppes, which opened at Asia House Gallery in New York City in 1970. He considered publishing an account of his 1969 trip to Afghanistan with Peter Levi. Levi published his own book about it, The Light Garden of the Angel King: Journeys in Afghanistan (1972). Chatwin contributed two articles on nomads to Vogue and another article to History Today.|$|E
5|$|Following the Axis {{invasion}} of Yugoslavia in April 1941, Drljević began {{cooperating with the}} Italian authorities occupying Montenegro. In July, he proclaimed the reestablishment of the Kingdom of Montenegro, but his <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> an Axis-aligned puppet state triggered an immediate uprising. That September, Italian authorities sent him to an internment camp in Italy after the oubreak of an anti-fascist revolt. Drljević escaped the camp several months later {{and made his way}} into the German-held half of the Independent State of Croatia (NDH). In the summer of 1944, he created the Montenegrin State Council in Zagreb.|$|E

Subsequent to the airing of the 1996 HBO documentary , which included footage from visitation interviews conducted with him, the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections acted to ban outsiders from using any recording equipment in state prisons. In litigation before the US Court of Appeals, in 1998 he successfully established his right to write for financial gain in prison. The same litigation also established that the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections had illegally opened his mail in an <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> whether he was writing for financial gain.|$|E
5|$|In May 1916 the Australian Government {{offered the}} British Army Council a sixth {{division}} of the First Australian Imperial Force (AIF), the Australian Army's main expeditionary force during World War I. This offer was an element of an <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> an Australian and New Zealand Army, though the Australian Government acknowledged that forming a sixth division could cause difficulties in providing sufficient reinforcements to replace the AIF's casualties from December 1916. In such an event, the government proposed breaking up the division to reinforce the five others. The Army Council declined this offer as it preferred Australia to raise only as many units as it could reinforce.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1890s, San Diego {{officials}} {{believed that a}} normal school should be established to help the town grow and increase certification of teachers. The tuition and travel for out-of-town normal schools were large and San Diegans desired to have a closer school. San Diego had to compete with Fresno, Los Angeles, and several other cities for a school, and its first <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> one in 1895 was vetoed by California governor James Budd. On March 13, 1897 Governor Budd changed course and signed legislation appropriating $50,000 {{to allow for the}} establishment of a state normal school in San Diego, to be located in University Heights. By 1905, total funds appropriated to the school totaled $333,300.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1970s, {{during times}} of {{economic}} prosperity, Houphouët-Boigny and Senghor put aside their differences and joined forces to thwart Nigeria, which, in an <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> itself in West Africa, had created the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). The two countered the ECOWAS by creating the Economic Community of West Africa (ECWA), which superseded the old trade partnerships in the French-speaking regions. However, after assurances from Nigeria that ECOWAS would function {{in the same manner}} as the earlier Francophone organisations, Houphouët-Boigny and Senghor decided to merge their organization into ECOWAS in May 1975.|$|E
5|$|Later, again under {{pressure}} from the plebs, a political compromise was reached in which the consuls and tribunes would give place to a commission of ten men, the decemviri, who would be empowered to publish a code of laws for all Rome. According to Livy, it codified all public and private law, but however, its promulgation did not grant further political rights to the plebs, as it enshired into the tables a law banning intermarriage between plebeians and patricians. With a short <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> a tyranny by the decemviri, they were overthrown by the second secession of the army, restoring the old republic and preventing {{the creation of a new}} constitution based on the ten-man commission.|$|E
5|$|Many {{other species}} have become {{naturalized}} outside the Americas {{after having been}} introduced by people, especially in Australia, Hawaii, and the Mediterranean region. In Australia, species of Opuntia, particularly Opuntia stricta, were introduced in the 19th century for use as natural agricultural fences and in an <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> a cochineal industry. They rapidly became a major weed problem, but are now controlled by biological agents, particularly the moth Cactoblastis cactorum. The weed potential of Opuntia species in Australia continues however, leading to all opuntioid cacti except O. ficus-indica being declared Weeds of National Significance by the Australian Weeds Committee in April 2012.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} month, Anne's Catholic half-brother, James Francis Edward Stuart, {{attempted to}} land in Scotland with French assistance in an <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> himself as king. Anne withheld royal assent from the Scottish Militia Bill 1708 in case the militia raised in Scotland was disloyal and sided with the Jacobites. She was the last British sovereign to veto a parliamentary bill, although her action was barely commented upon at the time. The invasion fleet never landed and was chased away by British ships commanded by Sir George Byng. As {{a result of the}} Jacobite invasion scare, support for the Tories fell and the Whigs were able to secure a majority in the British general election, 1708.|$|E
5|$|In October 1549 Andrew Dudley {{became one}} of Edward VI's Chief Gentlemen of the Privy Chamber and later keeper of the Palace of Westminster, in which {{function}} {{he was responsible for}} the Royal Wardrobe and Privy Purse. In early 1553 he was sent on a diplomatic mission to the Emperor Charles V to suggest peace talks between France and the Empire. Andrew Dudley was bethrothed to Margaret Clifford, a first cousin of Lady Jane Grey, in June 1553; yet his marriage plans came to naught with the accession of Mary I, and on 19 August 1553 he was condemned to death for his part in his brother's <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> Lady Jane on the English throne. Released in January 1555, he lived in London until his death in 1559.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1989–90 season, Hextall became unhappy {{that his}} eight-year, $4million {{contract}} was only earning him $325,000 a year, and hired a confrontational agent, Ritch Winter, to renegotiate his contract. The Flyers refused {{to deal with}} the agent, and at a tearful press conference, Hextall declared his contract invalid and announced that he would not take part in the team's training camp. After negotiations about which neither side revealed details, Hextall returned to practice with the team on October20, 42days later. Hextall suffered a slight groin pull during his first game back, and in his second, he hurt his left hamstring. Just under a month later, while playing for the Hershey Bears in an <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> his fitness, he was carried off the ice after once more hurting his groin. In total that season, Hextall appeared nine times; once for the Bears in the AHL, and eight times for the Flyers. In the NHL, he recorded a GAA of4.15, the highest he averaged during any single season of the NHL.|$|E

5|$|The Caribbean {{initially}} provided England's {{most important}} and lucrative colonies, but not before several attempts at colonisation failed. An <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> a colony in Guiana in 1604 lasted only two years, and failed in its main objective to find gold deposits. Colonies in St Lucia(1605) and Grenada(1609) also rapidly folded, but settlements were successfully established in St. Kitts(1624), Barbados(1627) and Nevis(1628). The colonies soon adopted the system of sugar plantations successfully used by the Portuguese in Brazil, which depended on slave labour, and—at first—Dutch ships, to sell the slaves and buy the sugar. To ensure that the increasingly healthy profits of this trade remained in English hands, Parliament decreed in 1651 that only English ships {{would be able to}} ply their trade in English colonies. This led to hostilities with the United Dutch Provinces—a series of Anglo-Dutch Wars—which would eventually strengthen England's position in the Americas {{at the expense of the}} Dutch. In 1655, England annexed the island of Jamaica from the Spanish, and in 1666 succeeded in colonising the Bahamas.|$|E
5|$|The Sea King {{participated in}} the UN's {{intervention}} in Bosnia. 845 Naval Air Squadron and their Sea Kings had been dispatched to the region in late 1992 in response to escalating tensions in the region. They performed various logistical and transport missions, such as the repositioning of Royal Artillery L118 Light Guns {{in the region and}} in the evacuation of casualties. In one incident on 24 March 1993, during an <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> an air evacuation route to a UN-declared safe zone, a flight of French Aérospatiale Pumas and Sea King HC4 helicopters were shelled while taking off from an improvised landing zone. Two further Sea Kings arrived to evacuate several UN casualties, managing to fly the wounded to the Bosnian city of Tuzla, where they came under further enemy fire while unloading.|$|E
5|$|The {{landings}} {{were to be}} {{preceded by}} airborne operations near Caen on the eastern flank to secure the Orne River bridges and north of Carentan on the western flank.

The British at Sword and Gold Beaches and Canadians at Juno Beach would protect the American flank and <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> <b>establish</b> airfields near Caen. A secure lodgement would be established and an attempt made to hold all territory north of the Avranches-Falaise line within the first three weeks. Montgomery envisaged a ninety-day battle, lasting until all Allied forces reached the River Seine.|$|E
