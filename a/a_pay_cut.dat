5|$|For the negotiations, {{the studio}} {{requested}} that the cast members accept a 45 percent cut of their salaries so that more seasons could be produced after season 23, or else that season would be the series' last. The actors {{were willing to take}} <b>a</b> <b>pay</b> <b>cut,</b> but wanted a percentage of the back-end payments instead. At one point Shearer even offered a 70 percent pay cut in exchange for back-end percentages, but the studio was unwilling to make any deal involving back-end percentages. In the end, the studio and the actors reached a deal, in which the actors would take <b>a</b> <b>pay</b> <b>cut</b> of 30 percent, down to just over $300,000 per episode, prolonging the show to its 25th season. As well as the voice actors, everybody involved in the show took <b>a</b> <b>pay</b> <b>cut.</b> This included animators, writers, the post-production crew and even Jean himself. The further use of digital animation also saves money, as the animation of the show becomes more efficient.|$|E

The lowest-paid man working on the sewers was informed he would need to move within the district and take <b>a</b> <b>pay</b> <b>cut</b> from £1:6s to £1:3s or be made redundant. He accepted.|$|E

5|$|George Burley {{took over}} from Redknapp in December 2005, though neither manager {{was unable to}} put {{together}} an effective promotion campaign and Southampton ended the season 12th in the Championship. Higginbotham rejected a new contract {{and as a result}} was placed on the transfer list in July 2006. He told the local press that he felt disrespected the way Southampton chairman Rupert Lowe had handled his contract – he had taken <b>a</b> <b>pay</b> <b>cut</b> to move from Derby, a 40% pay cut following relegation, and then the new contract offer was lower still than his current contract.|$|E

5|$|The {{family lived}} in Norman until Warren was 11, when they moved to Oklahoma City. When she was 12, her father, a {{salesman}} at Montgomery Ward, had a heart attack—which led to many medical bills, as well as <b>a</b> <b>pay</b> <b>cut</b> {{because he could not}} do his previous work. Eventually, this led to the loss of their car from failure to make loan payments. To help the family finances, her mother found work in the catalog order department at Sears. When she was 13, Warren started waiting tables at her aunt's restaurant.|$|E
5|$|After denying rumors for decades, in 2004 McElhenny {{confirmed}} {{that he received}} improper financial benefits from the University of Washington during his time there, which included a $300 monthly check. Per NCAA rules, the most a college can offer an athlete is a summer job and a scholarship covering boarding and tuition. A popular (albeit usually jocular) spin on the rumor was that McElhenny essentially took <b>a</b> <b>pay</b> <b>cut</b> {{when he left the}} university to play for the 49ers. This was not entirely untrue; all payments accounted for, including legitimate ones, McElhenny claimed he and his wife received a combined $10,000 a year while at Washington—with the 49ers, his rookie salary was worth $7,000.|$|E
5|$|López {{suffered}} from shoulder problems during spring training in 1982, {{and he was}} demoted to Detroit's Class AAA minor-league affiliate in Evansville by July.

López said that his reasons were personal, and he cited his family, the education of his children and the Mexican economy as motivating factors for the decision. He came out of retirement and returned to Detroit {{in time for the}} 1983 season. In February 1983, López became the first player in MLB history to receive <b>a</b> <b>pay</b> <b>cut</b> through salary arbitration. López had earned $285,000 in 1982, asked for $315,000 for 1983 and was awarded $250,000. He finished 1983 with a 98 record, 2.81 ERA and 18 saves.|$|E

His teams compiled a 73–15–4 record without a single losing season, and as of the end of 2016, he has the highest winning percentage of any Maryland football coach who coached at least seven games. In 1954, the University of Maryland appointed a new president, Dr. Wilson Elkins, who chose to de-emphasize football.
