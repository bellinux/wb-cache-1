Progressive pepsin digestion of immune γG-globulins, as monitored by successive loss of Gm(a) and Gm(b) antigens, abolished opsonic activity. Colostral γA, containing agglutinating antibacterial antibodies but no demonstrable complement-fixing activity, was devoid of opsonic capacity.

And there are no predominant rates of mast cell degranulation and hemolytic effects in such condition. With proper substitutions, the reducing power, DPPH scavenging activity and glutathione reductase-like enzyme activity of MP-B can increase clearly.
