40|$|In many {{epidemiologic}} data, the dose-response {{relation between}} a continuous exposure {{and the risk}} of disease abruptly changes when the exposure variable reaches an unknown threshold level, the so-called change-point. Although several methods are available for dose-response assessment with dichotomous outcomes, none of them provide inferential procedures to estimate change-points. In this paper, we describe <b>a</b> <b>two-segmented</b> logistic regression model, in which the linear term associated with a continuous exposure in standard logistic regression is replaced by <b>a</b> <b>two-segmented</b> polynomial function with unknown change-point, which is also estimated. A modified, iteratively reweighted least squares algorithm is presented to obtain parameter estimates and confidence intervals, and the performance of this model is explored through simulation. Finally, <b>a</b> <b>two-segmented</b> logistic regression model is applied to a case-control study of the association of alcohol intake with the risk of myocardial infarction and compared with alternative analyses. The ability of two-segmented logistic regression to estimate and provide inferences for the location of change-points and for the magnitude of other parameters of effect will make this model a useful complement to other methods of dose-response analysis in epidemiologic studies.

40|$|A new {{approach}} to neural network models is able to overcome the black-box-problem of neural networks by producing a measure, how sure the network is about its answer. The principle idea behind this measure is to use <b>a</b> <b>two-segmented</b> network, where the first segment works as an input-oriented, (mostly trained by unsupervised methods) classification device, whereas the second segment produces the output based on the classification given by the first segment. An analysis how good an input fits into the given classification produces the measure {{for the quality of}} the network response. This measure is of course by no means of the quality of error bars produced by statistical methods, however it is a good indication of how close the given input is to those used for the training of the neural network. Neural network models with this two-segmented architecture are not new, (e. g. RBFN or counterpropagation networks), however they have not been used so far to obtain information about possible errors of the network. We apply this network to data on bioindication and niche identification of 10 small rivers in German low-mountains and a long-term study of a small stream in Schleiter et al., (this journal) and Obach et al., (this journal) and compare the results to different approaches.

40|$|Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV; family Bunyaviridae) is a {{clinically}} important, mosquito-borne pathogen of both {{livestock and}} humans, which is found mainly in sub-Saharan Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. RVFV has a trisegmented single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) genome. The L and M segments are negative sense and encode the L protein (viral polymerase) on the L segment and the virion glycoproteins Gn and Gc {{as well as}} two other proteins, NSm and 78 K, on the M segment. The S segment uses an ambisense coding strategy to express the nucleocapsid protein, N, and the nonstructural protein, NSs. Both the NSs and NSm proteins are dispensable for virus growth in tissue culture. Using reverse genetics, we generated a recombinant virus, designated r 2 segMP 12, containing <b>a</b> <b>two-segmented</b> genome in which the NSs coding sequence was replaced with that for the Gn and Gc precursor. Thus, r 2 segMP 12 lacks an M segment, and although it was attenuated in comparison to the three-segmented parental virus in both mammalian and insect cell cultures, it was genetically stable over multiple passages. We further show that the virus can stably maintain an M-like RNA segment encoding the enhanced green fluorescent protein gene. The implications of these findings for RVFV genome packaging and the potential to develop multivalent live-attenuated vaccines are discussed.
