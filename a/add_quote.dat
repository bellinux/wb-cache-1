5000|$|A brief {{exploration}} of NewsDiffs demonstrates that news outlets are routinely making changes after they publish, {{and not only}} copyediting changes. Most are fairly innocuous: sentence structure is changed, paragraphs are moved up or down, statements are <b>added,</b> <b>quotes</b> omitted, headlines are made more social media-friendly. But the potential for more substantive changes with a few keystrokes raises concerns about transparency. Chava Gourarie of Columbia Journalism Review on August 10, 2015 Craig Silverman of the Poynter Institute compared NewsDiffs to ProPublica's ChangeTracker, a tool that records revisions to the White House website and the Sunlight Foundation's Politwoops, a tool that displays tweets deleted by Twitter accounts owned by politicians. Ryan Graff wrote in PBS's Idea Lab that NewsDiffs is a website that [...] "brought us greater transparency".|$|R

40|$|Edith Penrose and G. B. Richardson {{can be seen}} as {{pioneering}} {{an approach}} to understanding the business organization that is richer than the accepted production function approach found in mainstream economics. In this paper, the Penrose-Richardson approach is related to both the well-known Coasian-transaction-cost literature and to the less well-known modern Austrian discussions of the capital structure. Building on the work primarily of Richard Langlois I find that a central defining characteristic that emerges in this synthesis is the phenomenon of change. Change is seen as key to understanding both the rationale for the business firm and the type and extent of institutional adaptations that occur over time.

In order to make distinction between the old party and the new party that arose after 1955, they refer to today's KKE as [...] "K"KE or [...] "K"KE('56), <b>adding</b> scare <b>quotes</b> around the first K, which corresponds to the word communist.|$|R

500|$|Due to {{unforeseen}} scheduling {{problems with}} Shaft, production {{for the series}} was postponed for three years following the completion of its writing. However, once the issues were resolved, production began without any further complications. The animation studio spearheaded the conception and design of the witches in the series, as well as creating each one's individual backstory. Urobuchi had originally envisioned the witches {{to be similar to}} conventional monsters such as Godzilla, but upon seeing the surreal concept art for one of the main witches, Walpurgis Night, he remarked: [...] "How can Homura possibly fight against something like this?" [...] Designers from Shaft also <b>added</b> <b>quotes</b> from the German folklore legend Faust to the series. Throughout production, the animation production team Gekidan Inu Curry had freedom to insert new details or modify existing ones from the original script. An example is during a scene in the final episode where the team added black wings to Homura, something which was not included in Urobuchi's writing. Urobuchi praised this aspect of the production, commenting that [...] "additions by the animation production team added more mystery and depth to [...] characters, and without them, {{it would have been very}} difficult to write any further stories in the world of the series".|$|R
5000|$|Immediately {{after her}} graduation, Sawyer {{returned}} to Kentucky and was employed as weather forecaster for WLKY-TV in Louisville. In Sawyer's opinion, {{the weather was}} boring, so she would occasionally <b>add</b> <b>quotes</b> to keep it interesting. Finally, Sawyer was promoted to a general-assignment post, but this did not sustain her interest for long. In 1970, Sawyer moved to Washington, D.C., and, unable to find work as a broadcast journalist, she interviewed for positions in government offices. She eventually became an assistant to Jerry Warren, the White House deputy press secretary. Initially, Sawyer wrote press releases and quickly graduated to other tasks like drafting some of President Richard Nixon's public statements. Within a few months, she became an administrative assistant to White House Press Secretary Ron Ziegler and eventually rose to become a staff assistant for U.S. President Richard Nixon. [...] In 1973 when John Dean testified to the Senate Watergate Committee concerning Nixon's involvement in the Watergate coverup, Sawyer and Larry Speakes {{were assigned to the}} staff of Nixon's lawyer J. Fred Buzhardt in an effort to [...] "prove" [...] that Dean was lying. Speakes later claimed that he had {{come to the conclusion that}} Dean had not lied, and that he informed Sawyer, but they continued their efforts.|$|R

30|$|As said, {{the debate}} in {{progress}} has moved along different lines. Some have accepted or privileged only qualitative standards, differentiating them through uses or through accessibility, not ensuring the minimum mandatory quantities. Others have proposed a minimum quantitative POS standard lower than the current one, equal for all, to ensure a basic right to OS, making provision for added and variable quantities {{in relation to the}} different characteristics and local needs. This solution seems to be more comprehensible as it ensures an equal minimum right to all citizens, leaving an <b>added</b> quantitative <b>quote</b> of POS to answer to specific local demands (uses, accessibility). If it is correct for the boroughs to have different qualitative parameters related to the different demand, it is equally important to guarantee a dimensional one as a right for each and every citizen.|$|R

Even more commonly, people just put a normal (breaking) space between the quotation marks because the non-breaking space is often not easily accessible from the keyboard.|$|R

We separate liquidity-driven (transitory) volatility from information-driven (long run) volatility using a dynamic state-space co-integration model for ask and bid quotes. We report that changes in immediacy costs precede posterior fluctuations in long run volatility even after controlling for the incoming order flow. The book is less informative for large-caps than for small-caps. Consistently with previous studies, the book beyond the best <b>quotes</b> <b>adds</b> explanatory power to the best quotes.
