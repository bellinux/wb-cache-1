25|$|The entire railway is {{fitted with}} the rack rail. On sidings and <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> at Llanberis it {{comprises}} a single rack bar, {{but on the}} running line, and through all the loops up the mountain, two rack bars are used, mounted {{side by side with}} their teeth staggered by half a pitch. This {{is one of the major}} features of the Abt system, and helps to reduce the shock of the pinions running along the rack. It also ensures the pinion maintains continuous contact with the rack. The joints between rack bars are also staggered and align with the sleepers – each sleeper supports the rack rail as well as the running rails.|$|E
500|$|After paying garnish, {{prisoners were}} given a [...] "chum ticket", which told them which room was theirs and which prisoners they would be chumming with. They would often spend the first night in the {{infirmary}} until a room could be made ready, and sometimes three or four nights walking <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> before a chum could be found, although they were already being charged for the room they did not have.|$|E
500|$|Tritons keel {{was laid}} down on 29 May 1956 in Groton, Connecticut, by the Electric Boat Division of the General Dynamics Corporation. Her length {{presented}} Electric Boat with many problems during her construction. She {{was so long}} her bow obstructed the slipway's railway facility, used for transporting material <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard.</b> Consequently, {{the lower half of}} her bow was cut away to facilitate yard operations, and the bow was re-attached just days prior to her launch. Similarly, the last [...] of her stern was built on an adjoining slip and attached {{to the rest of the}} hull before Tritons launch. Her sail was found to be too high to go under the scaffolding, so the top [...] was cut away and re-attached later.|$|E

50|$|Diddy, {{a nine-year-old}} boy, {{is on his}} first hunt for The Sound, a mysterious humming sound that can be heard for miles <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>yards.</b> Finding <b>the</b> source of The Sound has {{become a sort of}} {{treasure}} hunt for young boys. Diddy is younger than most for his first hunt.|$|R
50|$|Brenan {{planned to}} make money with a meat market and a cattle sale <b>yard.</b> He {{subdivided}} <b>the</b> estate and named it Smithfield after the meat markets of London and Dublin. Saleyards opened in 1841 but the project to establish a village <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>yards</b> failed. Despite this, Smithfield did become a thriving commercial centre and remains a significant employment centre in south-western Sydney {{as part of the}} Wetherill Park/Yennora industrial block.|$|R
2500|$|To move {{materials}} <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard,</b> {{the company}} had its own dedicated [...] "dry land transportation fleet" [...] consisting of 28 trucks with capacities of between one and five tons, including three all-electric vehicles. The company's water transportation fleet, with its 15 vessels, {{was said to be}} the most complete of any ship repair yard in the country.|$|E
2500|$|According to {{the team}} captains, one player asked if the {{strippers}} had any sex toys, and Roberts responded by asking if the player's penis was too small. The player then brandished a broomstick and suggested that she [...] "use this [...]" [...] This exchange of words abruptly stopped the performance, and both strippers shut themselves in the home's bathroom. While the women {{were still in the}} bathroom, Reade Seligmann and Collin Finnerty left the house. The women eventually came out, and Mangum roamed <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> half-dressed and shouting.|$|E
2500|$|Early on {{the morning}} of December 5, Colonel James C. Neill created a {{distraction}} by ordering the artillery to fire {{on the walls of the}} Alamo Mission. [...] As the artillery boomed, the two attack columns sneaked towards Bexar. [...] Johnson led his men along the San Antonio River, and they quickly charged the Veramendi house. [...] Milam's men took the de la Garza house across the street. [...] Mexican soldiers opened fire, forcing Johnson and his men to take cover behind buildings. [...] Milam's men provided covering fire, allowing Johnson and his men to safely enter the Veramendi house. [...] For the rest of the day, Johnson and his men worked to fortify the Veramendi home, digging trenches and creating earthworks <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Canadian Northern Railway {{shops and}} yards were also located in Fort Rouge. Working class neighbourhoods {{developed}} <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>yards.</b> Many of <b>the</b> residents {{were able to}} walk the short distance to work. A few factories and warehouses appeared alongside the tracks and near the Red River as well. <b>The</b> <b>yards</b> are still in operation {{under the aegis of}} the Canadian National Railway and Via Rail, although some of <b>the</b> original <b>yards</b> were closed and the land ceded to the City of Winnipeg, which built a large bus garage on the lands.|$|R

40|$|Photograph {{of homes}} on coast in Monterey, ca. 1888. Naturally {{smoothed}} rocks with deep cracks and wrinkles blanket the marshy foreground while a long, wooden staircase {{stands on the}} left. The staircase leads from a patch of sand at the bottom to a sidewalk at top. The sidewalk is lined with various bushes and short trees as it curves <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>yards</b> of <b>the</b> large houses at center. The row of houses look very similar with large, arched windows and massive chimneys protruding from their roofs...|$|R
2500|$|At {{the base}} of the stage, there was an area called the pit, (or, harking back to the old inn-yards, yard) where, for a penny, people (the [...] "groundlings") would stand on the rush-strewn earthen floor to watch the performance. During the {{excavation}} of the Globe in 1989 a layer of nutshells was found, pressed into the dirt flooring so as to form a new surface layer. Vertically <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> were three levels of stadium-style seats, which were more expensive than standing room. A rectangular stage platform, also known as an apron stage, thrust out {{into the middle of the}} open-air yard. The stage measured approximately [...] in width, [...] in depth and was raised about [...] off the ground. On this stage, there was a trap door for use by performers to enter from the [...] "cellarage" [...] area beneath the stage.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will get}} in, uncle," [...] said I, [...] "and {{if you will}} let John drive the horses slowly <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard,</b> I {{will tell you how}} I happen to be here." ...|$|E
60|$|Bub seemed {{disappointed}} by this decision. He ran the car <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> {{two or three}} times, testing its condition, and then returned it to its shed. Mr. Conant got his rod and reel and departed on a fishing excursion.|$|E
5000|$|The line is {{elevated}} from Stadium-Chinatown to New Westminster stations, {{except for}} short at-grade sections between Nanaimo and Joyce-Collingwood stations in East Vancouver, and <b>around</b> <b>the</b> SkyTrain <b>yards</b> at Edmonds station in Burnaby.|$|R
50|$|The madrasah {{is built}} of yellow brick, {{and has a}} {{traditional}} square shape with a big portal and an inner <b>yard.</b> <b>The</b> walls <b>around</b> <b>the</b> inner <b>yard</b> contain cells inhabited by the students. The portal is 20 m high and contains two towers at its sides.|$|R
50|$|The {{church was}} erected {{in an area}} along the {{southwest}} of the island, in an isolated urban area inserted into a level area and courtyard. <b>Around</b> <b>the</b> church <b>yard</b> is <b>the</b> Império do Espírito Santo, that dates to 1879.|$|R
60|$|Hop Lung looked {{carefully}} <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> {{and then}} came slowly back into the kitchen. He walked again to the stove to see that nothing was burning, and finally {{came back to the}} cabinet and picked up the two fish gingerly. Meanwhile, the boys tiptoed their way back to their original positions at the windows.|$|E
60|$|Bob's {{mother and}} father, and his grandfather, and Hannah, {{and the young}} folks in the parlor, and nearly {{all the rest of}} the visitors, ransacked the house from top to bottom. Then they looked out of doors, and some of them went <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard,</b> where they could see very plainly, as it was bright moonlight. But though they searched and called, there was no Bob.|$|E
6000|$|... "I get {{one hundred}} for mine," [...] said Cherry. [...] "That's about the natural {{discount}} for a woman. But I live {{on it and}} put a few simoleons every week under the loose brick in the old kitchen hearth. The stage is all right. I love it; but there's something else I love better--that's a little country home, some day, with Plymouth Rock chickens and six ducks wandering <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard.</b>|$|E
5000|$|During {{the course}} of the 1950s and 1960s, the unit had grown to {{approximately}} 60 motorcycle officers. The most common formal training received at that time to be [...] "mounted" [...] was a few laps <b>around</b> <b>the</b> maintenance <b>yard.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{circular}} inner <b>yard</b> must be highlighted. It has a well in {{the middle}} of it, which indicates there is a cistern underneath. The palace itself is structured as a two-story building <b>around</b> <b>the</b> central <b>yard.</b> All its dependencies face this yard through a gallery of gothic semi-circular arches.|$|R

6000|$|After an {{examination}} of the farm house and other buildings (which seemed in his eyes almost palatial), and a conference with Alonzo Taft, the carpenter, the agent began to feel that his task was going to prove an easy one. He purchased a fine Jersey cow of Will Johnson, sold his own flock of Plymouth Rocks at a high price to Mr. Merrick, and hired Ned Long to work <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> and help Hucks mow the grass and [...] "clean up" [...] generally.|$|E
60|$|But Emmeline was a {{match for}} us all. She never let Prissy out of her sight. Everywhere she went she toted Prissy, too. When a month had gone by, I was almost in despair. Mr. Leonard had {{to leave for the}} Assembly in another week and Stephen's {{neighbours}} were beginning to talk about him. They said that a man who spent all his time hanging <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> with a spyglass, and trusting everything to a hired boy, couldn't be altogether right in his mind.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Now {{life begins}} again!' thought the tree. It felt the fresh air, the first {{rays of the}} sun, {{and there it was}} out in the yard! Everything passed so quickly; the tree quite forgot to notice itself, there was so much to look at all <b>around.</b> <b>The</b> <b>yard</b> opened on a garden full of flowers; the roses were so fresh and sweet, hanging over a little trellis, the lime-trees were in blossom, and the {{swallows}} flew about, saying: 'Quirre-virre-vil, my husband has come home;' but it was not the fir-tree they meant.|$|E
60|$|Presently <b>the</b> wind veered <b>around</b> and <b>the</b> <b>yards</b> {{came over}} with a bang. The Wellington gave a lurch, {{and there was a}} strange {{creaking}} and cracking far below the deck. The Canadian pumped more madly than ever, and shouted to his companion in French.|$|R
50|$|The {{construction}} was typical for the outer Jerusalem neighborhoods of that era. A wide yard, with an underground cistern that served {{to collect and}} preserve water for residents. In the neighborhood were public facilities like a bath house, a flour storehouse, a bakery, a synagogue and Torah school. <b>Around</b> <b>the</b> common <b>yard,</b> single-story residences were built to face <b>the</b> <b>yard.</b>|$|R

60|$|So as Reddy Fox thought {{more and}} more of his own smartness, he grew bolder and bolder. Almost every night he visited Farmer Brown's henyard. Farmer Brown set traps all <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard,</b> but Reddy always found them and kept out of them. It got so that Unc' Billy Possum and Jimmy Skunk didn't dare go to the {{henhouse}} for eggs any more, for fear that they would get into one of the traps set for Reddy Fox. Of course they missed those fresh eggs and of course they blamed Reddy Fox.|$|E
60|$|It was {{a pretty}} place, all painted dark blue with {{trimmings}} of lighter blue. There was a neat blue fence <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> and several blue benches had been placed underneath the shady blue trees which marked the line between forest and plain. There was a blue lawn before the house, which was a good sized building. Ku-Klip lived in the front {{part of the house}} and had his work-shop in the back part, where he had also built a lean-to addition, in order to give him more room.|$|E
6000|$|Place a honey-bee {{in a glass}} bottle. Turn {{the bottom}} of the bottle toward a lighted lamp so that the open mouth is away from the lamp. Vainly, ceaselessly, a {{thousand}} times, undeterred by the bafflement and the pain, the bee will hurl himself against {{the bottom of the}} bottle as he strives to win to the light. That is instinct. Place your dog in a back yard and go away. He is your dog. He loves you. He yearns toward you as the bee yearns toward the light. He listens to your departing footsteps. But the fence is too high. Then he turns his back upon the direction in which you are departing, and runs <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard.</b> He is frantic with affection and desire. But he is not blind. He is observant. He is looking for a hole under the fence, or through the fence, or for a place where the fence is not so high. He sees a dry-goods box standing against the fence. Presto! He leaps upon it, goes over the barrier, and tears down the street to overtake you. Is that instinct? ...|$|E
50|$|Front {{ensemble}} members {{perform on}} orchestral percussion and electronic instruments. Due {{to the size}} of these instruments, the pit typically remains stationary, positioned {{directly in front of the}} field and centered on or <b>around</b> <b>the</b> 50 <b>yard</b> line. A full-size front ensemble features 10 - 15 members.|$|R
50|$|Edwardsville is {{the name}} given to the small urban area that grew up <b>around</b> <b>the</b> Quakers <b>Yard</b> station. <b>The</b> railway pre-dated the villages of both Edwardsville and Treharris.
