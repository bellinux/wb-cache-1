5|$|Major Kean {{returned}} to {{the ground floor of}} the Chancery and ordered his men to withdraw into a large semicircle at the main entrance to the Chancery. Most of the Marines were inside the Chancery when the crowds outside the Embassy broke through the gates into the compound. The Marines closed <b>and</b> <b>bolted</b> the Chancery door, the elevators were locked by Seabees on the sixth floor and the Marines withdrew up the stairwells locking grill gates behind them. On the ground floor a water tanker was driven through the Chancery door and the crowd began to surge up through the building toward the rooftop. The Marines on the rooftop had sealed the doors and were using Mace to discourage the crowd from trying to break through. Sporadic gunfire from around the Embassy passed over the rooftop.|$|E
5|$|The target chamber is a two-wall {{structure}} {{filled with}} liquid lithium or a lithium alloy between the walls. The lithium captures neutrons from the reactions to breed tritium, and also {{acts as the}} primary coolant loop. The chamber is filled with xenon gas that would slow the ions from the reaction as well as protect the inner wall, or first wall, from the massive x-ray flux. Because the chamber is not highly pressurized, like a fission core, {{it does not have}} to be built as a single sphere. Instead, the LIFE chamber is built from eight identical sections that include built-in connections to the cooling loop. They are shipped to the plant <b>and</b> <b>bolted</b> together on two supports, and then surrounded by a tube-based space frame.|$|E

25|$|Many SDF members became {{involved}} in the American Labor Party when it was formed in 1936, supporting the faction led by David Dubinsky.

25|$|Victoria Hall {{was a large}} {{concert hall}} on Toward Road facing Mowbray Park. The hall {{was the scene of}} a tragedy on 16 June 1883 when 183 {{children}} died. During a variety show, children rushed towards a staircase for treats. At the bottom of the staircase, the door had been opened inward <b>and</b> <b>bolted</b> {{in such a way as}} to leave only a gap wide enough for one child to pass at a time. The children surged down the stairs and those at the front were trapped and crushed by the weight of the crowd behind them.|$|E
25|$|Wood posts {{enable the}} {{fabrication}} of strong, direct, yet inexpensive connections between large trusses and walls. Exact details for post-to-truss connections vary from designer to designer, {{and may be}} influenced by post type. Solid-sawn timber and glulam posts are generally notched to form a truss bearing surface. The truss is rested on the notches <b>and</b> <b>bolted</b> into place. A special plate/bracket may be added to increase connection load transfer capabilities. With mechanically-laminated posts, the truss may rest on a shortened outer-ply or on a shortened inner-ply. The later scenario places the bolts in double shear and is a very effective connection.|$|E

25|$|As soon as two {{adjacent}} columns {{had been}} erected, a girder was hoisted into place between them <b>and</b> <b>bolted</b> onto the connectors. The columns were erected in opposite pairs, then two more girders {{were connected to}} form a self-supporting squareâ€”this was the basic frame of each module. The shears would then be moved along and an adjoining bay constructed. When a reasonable number of bays had been completed, the columns for the upper floor were erected (longer shear-legs were used for this, but the operation was {{essentially the same as}} for the ground floor). Once the ground floor structure was complete, the final assembly of the upper floor followed rapidly.|$|E
25|$|Confederate {{reinforcements}} from Heth's and Mahone's divisions arrived {{while the}} Confederate artillery under Col. William Pegram softened up the Union position. The final attack began around 5:30p.m. by six brigades against Miles's position and it {{broke through the}} northwest corner of the Union fortifications; although the Union defensive fire was fierce enough to keep the Confederates at bay, suddenly two Union regiments panicked <b>and</b> <b>bolted</b> for the rear, opening a gap. Miles ordered his reserve brigade under Col. Horace Rugg to close the gap, but to his astonishment, Rugg's men fell prone and refused to open fire. Heth personally led the charge through the earthworks, tussling with Sgt. Thomas Minton of the 26th North Carolina about who would carry the colors forward.|$|E
25|$|It took {{eight to}} twenty hours in soft soil or gravel to {{excavate}} the large firing pit required {{to hold the}} halves of the base box. Six to eight hours were required to actually assemble the gun itself. Each half of the base box was maneuvered into position on rails that ran along {{each side of the}} pit and then it was jacked up off the wagon and the wagon was then removed. Each base box half was jacked down onto wheels that ran on the guide rails and then they were bolted together. The complete base box was pulled over the pit, the wheels removed and it was jacked down into the pit. Three rails were placed on top of the base box to guide the carriage wagon into position and the carriage was jacked up while the wagon was removed and it was then jacked down <b>and</b> <b>bolted</b> to the base box. The barrel wagon was guided into place using the same rails and two block and tackles were attached to the barrel clamp. The crew pulled on the ropes and slid the barrel into the cradle. The last steps were to connect the recoil brakes' pistons to the barrel, fill and test the recoil brake and recuperator, and install the roller race. Disassembly took around six hours.|$|E

500|$|At 10:00am on December 20, 1908 in Danbury, Clemens {{went for}} a sleigh ride with Russian concert pianist Ossip Gabrilowitsch who was staying with her father at his residence, Innocence at Home, in Redding. While passing through Redding Glen, the horse took fright at a wind-whipped {{newspaper}} <b>and</b> <b>bolted</b> with driver Gabrilowitsch losing control. At {{the top of a}} hill, next to a [...] drop, the sleigh overturned, throwing Clemens out. Gabrilowitsch leaped to the ground and caught the horse by the head, stopping it as it was about to plunge over the bank, dragging Clemens with her dress caught in a runner. Having only sprained his right ankle, Gabrilowitsch returned Clemens to home, unharmed except for the shock of the accident. Twain biographer Michael Shelden doubted the truth of this heroic tale and supplied a motive for why the story might have been planted in the press, namely, to quiet rumors that Clara {{was having an affair with}} Charles E.

500|$|The party pressed onward on August 30, {{having no}} alternative. [...] In {{the heat of}} the day, the {{moisture}} underneath the salt crust rose to the surface and turned the soil to a gummy mass. [...] The wheels of their wagons sank into it, in some cases up to the hubs. [...] The days were blisteringly hot and the nights frigid. Several of the group saw visions of lakes and wagon trains, and believed that they had finally overtaken Hastings. After three days, the water was gone, and some of the party removed their oxen from the wagons to press ahead to find more. Some of the animals were so weakened they were left yoked to the wagons and abandoned. Nine of Reed's ten oxen broke free, crazed with thirst, <b>and</b> <b>bolted</b> off into the desert. Many other families' cattle and horses had also gone missing. The rigors of the journey resulted in irreparable damage to some of the wagons, but no human lives had been lost. [...] Instead of the promised two days journey over 40 miles, the journey across the 80 miles of Great Salt Lake Desert had taken six.|$|E
500|$|Preliminary damage surveys {{conducted}} {{by a group of}} structural engineers from Texas Tech University determined that many of the frame homes that were destroyed by the Bridge Creekâˆ’Moore tornado were constructed below minimal residential building code standards, discovering some structural deficiencies that violated codes, which were considered to be inadequate for regions prone to tornadic activity (under federal building code standards, frame homes that were properly strapped <b>and</b> <b>bolted</b> would have withstood winds between 152 and 157 miles per hour (245 and 253km/h), equivalent to an F2 tornado). The team, led by meteorological researcher Charles Doswell and storm damage engineer/meteorologist Tim Marshall, determined that nails attached to a plywood roof deck in one damaged home were not properly anchored to the rafters; several homes in rural areas that were swept nearly [...] from their original location did not have anchor bolts that secured the frame to their foundations, as was the case at Country Place Estates, where the homes âˆ’ which left a trail of debris strewn [...] away from their location âˆ’ were attached to the concrete foundations by tapered cut nails that extended only a half-inch to the bases; many homes that were left at least partially standing also had their garage doors (mainly those made from aluminum material) collapse inward, allowing the tornado's destructive winds to enter the houses.|$|E
2500|$|On September 28, 1940 at Columbia Hospital in Columbia, South Carolina, American surgeon Dr. Austin T. Moore (1899â€“1963) {{performed}} the first metallic hip replacement surgery.

[...] It was about a foot in length <b>and</b> <b>bolted</b> to the resected end of the femoral shaft (hemiarthroplasty). [...] A later version, the so-called Austin Moore Prosthesis which was introduced in 1952, is still in use today, although rarely. [...] Like modern hip implants, it is inserted into the medullary canal of the femur, and depends on bone growth {{through a hole in}} the stem for long-term attachment.|$|E
