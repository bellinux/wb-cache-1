5|$|Numerous {{invasive}} plants live {{along the}} Saw Mill River. Porcelain berry is <b>a</b> <b>vine</b> with white berries that wraps around native trees and strangles them. Oriental bittersweet is also present along the river, {{and it is}} slowly displacing the native American bittersweet. Oriental bitterweet can also form hybrids with the native bittersweet and making identification harder. Japanese honeysuckle and Japanese knotweed are two other invasive vines native to Asia. In addition, purple loosestrife, a perennial herb with magenta flower stalks, is also present along the river.|$|E

5|$|There {{have been}} several {{theories}} proposed for why the phylloxera was ignored as the possible cause of the disease {{that resulted in the}} failure of so many vineyards, most of which involve the feeding behaviour of the insect, and the way it attacks the roots. The proboscis of the grape phylloxera has both a venom canal from which it injects its deadly venom and a feeding tube through which it takes in vine sap and nutrients. As the toxin from the venom corrodes the root structure of <b>a</b> <b>vine,</b> the sap pressure falls and, as a result, the Phylloxera quickly withdraws its feeding tube and searches for another source of food. Thus, anyone digging up a diseased and dying vine will not find Phylloxera clinging to the roots of the plant.|$|E
5|$|Presumably a {{few days}} later, Katy has since made friends with a monkey and uses her {{stiletto}} heel to form a spear. She uses it to shoot a banana, which she gives to the monkey. In another scene, she bathes in the lake, {{with the help of}} an elephant who sprays her with water from the lake using its trunk. Katy helps a crocodile by brushing its teeth using a toothbrush she has salvaged, and tries to reach her clothes which have been taken by the elephant. At night, she holds a torch and explores a cave. Inside, she watches an animated drawing on the wall in which humans try to kill a tiger with fire; attempting to burn it as it grows stronger and shooting spears which it sends firing back towards them with its roar. The next morning, Katy emerges from the cave, wearing a leopard-print bikini top, a grass skirt, laced up legs and bare feet, displaying a boost of confidence and holding the spear she made earlier. She stands on top of a waterfall, overlooking the jungle, and then swings across the sky on <b>a</b> <b>vine.</b>|$|E

50|$|Layering - In {{established}} vineyards {{where only}} <b>a</b> few <b>vines</b> {{need to be}} replaced within a row (such as vine lost to machine damage or disease), <b>a</b> new <b>vine</b> can be propagated by bending a cane from <b>a</b> neighboring <b>vine</b> into the ground and covering it with dirt. This segment of vine will soon begin sprouting its own independent root system while still being nourished by the connecting vine. Eventually the connection between the two vines are severed allowing each vine to grow independently.|$|R

25|$|It is not {{valid to}} train <b>a</b> <b>vine,</b> gourd, or ivy {{to cover a}} sukkah and then cover it with sukkah {{covering}} (s'chach). If, however, the sukkah-covering exceeds the vine, gourd, or ivy in quantity, or if the vine, gourd, or ivy is detached, it is valid. The general rule is that one may not use for sukkah-covering anything that is susceptible to ritual impurity (tumah) or that does not grow from the soil. But one may use for sukkah-covering anything not susceptible to ritual impurity that grows from the soil.|$|E

25|$|Kiwifruit vines require {{vigorous}} pruning, {{similar to}} that of grapevines. Fruit is borne on one-year-old and older canes, but production declines as each cane ages. Canes should be pruned off and replaced after their third year. In the northern hemisphere the fruit ripens in November, while in the southern it ripens in May. Four year-old plants can produce up to 14,000 lbs per acre while Eight year-old plants can produce 18,000 lbs per acre. The plants produce their maximum at 8 to 10 years old. The seasonal yields are variable, a heavy crop on <b>a</b> <b>vine</b> one season generally comes with a light crop the following season.|$|E
25|$|Irrigation in {{viticulture}} is {{the process}} of applying extra water in the cultivation of grapevines. It is considered both controversial and essential to wine production. In the physiology of the grapevine, the amount of available water affects photosynthesis and hence growth, as well as the development of grape berries. While climate and humidity play important roles, a typical grape vine needs 25-35inches (635-890 millimeters) of water a year, occurring during the spring and summer months of the growing season, to avoid stress. <b>A</b> <b>vine</b> that does not receive the necessary amount of water will have its growth altered in a number of ways; some effects of water stress (particularly, smaller berry size and somewhat higher sugar content) are considered desirable by wine grape growers.|$|E
25|$|Historians {{agree that}} Aix was born from its sources {{of water to}} Ancient Rome, on {{the remains of a}} Celtic habitat. The first {{occupation}} of the site has been dated by Alain Canal to the first century BCE, however there is nothing to suggest these remains were a fixed habitat. We are left with the remains in public institutions and {{it would be difficult to}} draw a sketch of ancient Aquae. The administrative situation of the place is known by epigraphy, which teaches us that Aix was, in the 1st century AD, a vicus, with a board of decemlecti (a council of ten members), and was administratively part of Vienne. Some citizens lived there with, apparently, quite important resources to offer to the gods, a sacred wood, <b>a</b> <b>vine</b> or to build a funeral arch for the case of the Campanii family.|$|E

50|$|In {{contrast}} to predator satiation, a different pattern {{is seen in}} response to mutualistic consumers, which benefit an organism by feeding from it (such as frugivores, which disperse seeds). For example, <b>a</b> <b>vine's</b> berries may ripen at different times, ensuring frugivores are not swamped with food and so resulting in {{a larger proportion of}} its seeds being dispersed.|$|R
25|$|When King Lycurgus of Thrace {{heard that}} Dionysus {{was in his}} kingdom, he imprisoned Dionysus' followers, the Maenads. Dionysus fled and took refuge with Thetis, and sent a drought which stirred the people into revolt. Dionysus then drove King Lycurgus insane and had him slice his own son into pieces with an axe {{in the belief that}} he was a patch of ivy, a plant holy to Dionysus. An oracle then claimed that the land would stay dry and barren as long as Lycurgus was alive. His people had him drawn and quartered. Following the death of the king, Dionysus lifted the curse. This story is told in Homer's epic, Iliad 6.136-7. In an {{alternative}} version, sometimes shown in art, Lycurgus tries to kill Ambrosia, a follower of Dionysus, who was transformed into <b>a</b> <b>vine</b> that twined around the enraged king and restrained him, eventually killing him.|$|E
25|$|Dionysus {{travels through}} {{the east and}} is entertained by a shepherd, Brongus, in a country fashion. In thanks for his hospitality, Dionysus gives him some wine and teaches him how to grow and harvest the vine. Astraeis informs Orontes, {{son-in-law}} of the Indian king Deriades, of {{the defeat of the}} Indian army and the ruse of the waters turned into wine. Orontes is furious and harangues his troops not to fear the effeminate Dionysus and his army of women. The Indians charge in and at first seem to win, but Dionysus screams like nine thousand men and detains them. Orontes and Dionysus engage in single combat: a tap of <b>a</b> <b>vine</b> cluster on Orontes' chest is enough to split his armour. Orontes plunges his sword into his own belly and throws himself into the river nearby, giving it his name (Orontes river). The Bacchic troops massacre the Indians. Astraeis flees.|$|E
