Also, a comparison between the solutions in the case of isothermal and <b>adiabatic</b> <b>flows</b> is made. Further, it is shown that the consideration of zero temperature gradient and an increase in the strength of ambient magnetic field, the initial density variation index or adiabatic exponent of the gas decrease the shock strength and widen the disturbed region between the shock and the piston.
