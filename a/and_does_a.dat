500|$|... "Barbette," [...] writes Cocteau, [...] "transforms {{effortlessly}} {{back and}} forth between man and woman. His female glamour and elegance Cocteau likens to a cloud of dust thrown into the eyes of the audience, blinding it to the masculinity of the movements he needs to perform his acrobatics. That blindness is so complete {{that at the end of}} his act, Barbette does not simply remove his wig but instead plays the part of a man. He rolls his shoulders, stretches his hands, swells his muscles...And after the fifteenth or so curtain call, he gives a mischievous wink, shifts from foot to foot, mimes a bit of an apology, <b>and</b> <b>does</b> <b>a</b> shuffling little street urchin dance – all of it to erase the fabulous, dying-swan impression left by the act." [...] Cocteau calls upon his fellow artists to incorporate deliberately this effect that he believes for Barbette is instinctive.|$|E

500|$|As the {{defending}} champion at the World Championship for the first time, O'Sullivan sought to turn his recent bad form around and break the Crucible curse. O'Sullivan defeated Drew Henry 10–5 in the first round, Robert Milkins 13–2 in the second round, and Stephen Lee 13–10 in the quarter-finals {{to advance to the}} semi-finals where he faced Stephen Hendry. In a pre-match interview, O'Sullivan revealed that he had [...] "no respect" [...] for Hendry, referring to an incident during O'Sullivan's 13–17 semi-final defeat to Hendry three years prior, when the referee had awarded a miss that O'Sullivan felt Hendry should not have accepted. He further added that he wanted [...] "to send [...] back home to Scotland" [...] to stop one of his former manager's players from winning the tournament, and that [...] "I know if I do get beat and [...] comes up <b>and</b> <b>does</b> <b>a</b> moonie {{in front of me and}} goes 'Ne ne ne', I'll just look at him and say 'well done' and say 'go back to your sad little life'.". In the match O'Sullivan took a 5–3 overnight lead after the first session, but Hendry fought back to level at 12–12 before the final session. Hendry subsequently outplayed O'Sullivan winning the semi-final 17 frames to 13. After the match, Hendry said it wasn't [...] "personal" [...] for him and he didn't remember the incident O'Sullivan described.

[...] Michael O'Sullivan of The Washington Post gave the film two and half stars out of four, praised Kristen Stewart's performance in the film and wrote: [...] "Despite melodrama that, at times, is enough to induce diabetes, there's enough wolf whistle in this sexy, scary romp to please anyone." [...] The Seattle Post-Intelligencer gave the film a [...] "B" [...] grading and said, [...] "the movie looks tremendous, the dialogue works, there are numerous well placed jokes, the acting is on point." [...] Mick LaSalle from the San Francisco Chronicle responded with a more mixed review, stating, [...] "xpect this film to satisfy its fans. Everybody else, get ready for a bizarre soap opera/pageant, consisting of a succession of static scenes with characters loping into the frame to announce exactly what they're thinking." [...] Roger Ebert gave the film 1 star out of 4 and said that it [...] "takes the tepid achievement of Twilight, guts it, and leaves it for undead." [...] The release of the movie has also inspired feminist criticism, with Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly making light of the claim that Edward Cullen is little better than a stalker. In any case, the influx of female viewers into the theaters indicates the increasing importance of the female demographic in dictating Hollywood's tastes.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} was filmed in Milan, Italy between {{the dates of}} the 2009 leg of her Sticky & Sweet Tour. The concept of the video is in {{similarity}} to {{the title of the}} song; celebration of Madonna's career. According to MTV, the video is a throwback to Madonna's Erotica era and encompasses a dark music image. The Benny Benassi remix of the song is used in the video. It starts with Madonna asking the line [...] "Haven't I seen you somewhere before?". The music starts and the scenes cut between Madonna and her dancers start dancing to the music of the song. Madonna wears a crystal embossed, shouldered Balmain dress with knee-high Christian Louboutin boots. While she is present in almost every frame of the camera, she does not perform choreographed dance moves. Her dance is mostly confined to casual maneuvers. The dancers on the other hand, perform choreographed moves as a solo act. As the song progresses, more dancers are shown and they ultimately reach a club. The DJ in the club is portrayed by model Jesus Luz. Madonna indulges in sensual poses with him and removes his clothes in an attempt to recognize him, as the line [...] "I guess I don't recognize you with your clothes on" [...] is played. The two of them brush their lips together, and Madonna moves away to the dance floor again. Lourdes makes an appearance {{near the end of the}} video. She appears in an eighties styled, polka-dotted leotard and pants, <b>and</b> <b>does</b> <b>a</b> back arch on the ground. Madonna is then shown on the ground on all fours, or dancing while grabbing her groin. Both Madonna's and her dancer's moves are edited to appear in fast forward. Hip hop styled dancing is showcased towards the end of the video. [...] The end shot of the video portrays Madonna sliding down on the ground. Teaser trailers for the video, show Oakenfold dancing to the song, but his scenes are not included in the final version.|$|E
