5|$|As {{chair of}} Bloomington Conservation Project, Horch and the Master Institute of United Arts led {{an effort to}} improve {{deteriorated}} housing by converting single-family brownstone buildings into rent-subsidized apartments. Efforts like those of this project <b>ameliorated</b> conditions to some extent, but the Bloomingdale area {{did not return to}} prosperity until the late 1980s and early 1990s, when the city as a whole experienced an economic rebound. As high-paying white-collar employment in financial institutions and other service industries replaced long-departed blue-collar jobs in the industrial sector, real estate speculators found that they could profit from new condos and co-ops either by replacing old buildings or by renovating them.|$|E
40|$|Background: This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the development of <b>ameliorating</b> inventory models. The <b>ameliorating</b> inventory is the inventory of goods whose utility increases over the time by <b>ameliorating</b> activation. 	Material and Methods: This study is performed according to two areas: one is an economic order quantity (EOQ) model for the items whose utility is <b>ameliorating</b> in accordance with Weibull distribution, and the other is a partial selling quantity (PSQ) model developed for selling the surplus inventory accumulated by <b>ameliorating</b> activation with linear demand. The aim of this paper was to develop a mathematical model for inventory type concerned in the paper. Numerical examples were presented show the effect of <b>ameliorating</b> rate on inventory polices. 	 Results and Conclusions:  The inventory model for items with Weibull <b>ameliorating</b> is developed. For the case of small <b>ameliorating</b> rate (less than linear demand rate), EOQ model is developed, and for the case where <b>ameliorating</b> rate is greater than linear demand rate, PSQ model is developed.  . 	 ...|$|R

5|$|In {{northern}} and western Africa, the desiccation and humectation {{of the modern}} Sahara desert has led to very fruitful archaeological sites, followed by completely barren soil, only to once again show evidence of population when the aridity of the region was <b>ameliorated.</b> Preservation in these two regions are alternately superb and lamentable, yet the sites that have been uncovered document the adaptive nature of early hominins to climatically unstable environments. Researchers such as Marean and Assefa consider the historic distinction between northern Africa {{and the rest of}} Africa, as though they represent divergent cultural developments, an arbitrary and antiquated distinction.|$|E
5|$|Nouakchott was a {{small village}} of little {{importance}} until 1958, when it {{was chosen as the}} capital of the nascent nation of Mauritania. It was designed and built to accommodate 15,000 people, but droughts and increasing desertification since the 1970s have displaced a vast number of Mauritanians who resettled in Nouakchott. This caused massive urban growth and overcrowding, with the city having an official population of just under a million as of 2013. The resettled population inhabited slum areas under poor conditions, but the living conditions of a portion of these inhabitants have since been <b>ameliorated.</b>|$|E
5|$|The average Soviet soldier {{suffered}} from inexperience. With the Soviet debacle {{of the previous}} year <b>ameliorated</b> only by the barest victory at Moscow, most of the original manpower of the Red Army had been killed, wounded or captured by the Germans, with casualties of almost 1,000,000 just from the Battle of Moscow. The typical soldier in the Red Army was a conscript and had little to no combat experience, and tactical training was practically nonexistent. Coupled with the lack of trained soldiers, the Red Army also began to suffer from the loss of Soviet industrial areas, and a temporary strategic defense was considered necessary.|$|E

5|$|There is {{one case}} study on maltreated twins {{published}} in 1999 with a follow-up in 2006. This study assessed the twins {{between the ages of}} 19 and 36 months, during which time they suffered multiple moves and placements. The paper explores the similarities, differences and comorbidity of RAD, disorganized attachment and post traumatic stress disorder. The girl showed signs of the inhibited form of RAD while the boy showed signs of the indiscriminate form. It was noted that the diagnosis of RAD <b>ameliorated</b> with better care but symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder and signs of disorganized attachment came and went as the infants progressed through multiple placement changes. At age three, some lasting relationship disturbance was evident.|$|E
5|$|Banksia aemula resprouts from a {{lignotuber}} or shoots from epicormic buds after fire. Fire {{management of}} Banksia aemula heath in Southeast Queensland recommends 7- to 20-year fire intervals. Intervals of 10–15 years are recommended for the Eastern Suburbs Banksia Scrub, as longer leads to overgrowth by Leptospermum laevigatum. Experimenting with seed germination and early growth of B.aemula showed that phosphorus was toxic to seedlings, inhibiting growth at double normal soil concentrations and causing seedling death at quadruple normal soil concentrations. The addition of potassium or magnesium <b>ameliorated</b> these effects a little although potassium in high concentrations impacted on growth as well. Overall, seedlings grow slowly {{over the first}} 21 weeks of life compared with other plant species, the reasons for which are unclear, {{although it may be}} that it offers an increased chance of survival in a nutrient- or water-poor environment. Seed was killed by exposure to 150°C, but survived seven-minute exposure to 100°C.|$|E
5|$|By 1946, MD150 {{had been}} {{extended}} west {{into the city}} of Baltimore over Eastern Avenue {{at least as far}} as Highlandtown. Around 1950, the state highway followed Highland Avenue south from US40 to Eastern Avenue. MD150 was moved to Kresson Street, Lombard Street, and Ponca Street, which met Eastern Avenue just west of its present junction, in 1960. Around 1963, Haven Street and Kresson Street were converted to a one-way pair, with Haven Street carrying eastbound traffic south and Kresson Street handling westbound traffic toward US40. The portion of Lombard Street between Haven and Kresson was added to MD150; the state highway was also extended north on Haven and Kresson to Monument Street, then east along Monument Street to MD150's new western terminus at US40 at the U.S. Highway's underpass of CSX's Philadelphia Subdivision. This convoluted path was <b>ameliorated</b> around 2002 when the highway was shortened to its present course in East Baltimore.|$|E

5|$|To {{minimize}} the drawbacks of the inclined belt, it sloped {{outward from the}} keel, then back in towards the armored deck. This meant that shells fired at relatively close range would hit the upper portion of the belt at an angle, which maximized armor protection. However, {{the effectiveness of the}} upper portion of the belt was degraded at longer ranges, because plunging shells would strike it at an angle closer to the perpendicular, increasing their ability to penetrate the armor. It did reduce the area that needed to be covered by the armored deck, which saved additional weight. This enabled the upper belt to be thicker, which to an extent <b>ameliorated</b> the vulnerability to plunging fire. Because the belt was internal, it provided the opportunity to extend it to the inner portion of the double bottom, which gave the ship better underwater protection than the North Carolinas. Ultimately, the complex double incline belt armor was abandoned when it became apparent that a single slanted belt could provide similar protection, and save several hundred tons of weight.|$|E

In the mixed event Cochet and Whittingstall lost in semifinal stage, this time to Enrique Maier and Elizabeth Ryan. The singles competition was won by Ellsworth Vines, his first non-American title. The American Davis Cup team traveled back to France to challenge the reigning holder at the Stade Roland Garros. The French Musketeers secured the cup for the sixth and final time after four rubbers, losing only the doubles match. Cochet and Vines met in the dead fifth rubber. The face-off between the two {{was one of the few}} encounters that later had a decisive effect on the rankings. Vines <b>ameliorated</b> his team's result by defeating Cochet in five sets. The two European major champions then met in the final of the U.S. National Championships final in September. Vines kept the national title home with his second win, a straight sets 6–4 victory over Cochet. Vines and Keith Gledhill subsequently beat Cochet and Marcel Bernard in the doubles final. Cochet and Virginia Rice were dropped out in the mixed semifinal while Vines reached the finals. These losses sealed the fate of the year-end rankings.|$|E
