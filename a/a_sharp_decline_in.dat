40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} accounting conservatism on firm-level investment during the 2007 – 2008 global financial crisis. Using a differences-in-differences design, we find that firms with less conservative financial reporting experienced <b>a</b> <b>sharper</b> <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> investment activity following {{the onset of the}} crisis compared to firms with more conservative financial reporting. This relation is stronger for firms that were financially constrained, faced greater external financing needs, or had higher information asymmetry. We also find that more conservative firms experienced lower <b>declines</b> <b>in</b> both debt raising activity and stock performance. The evidence suggests that accounting conservatism reduces underinvestment in the presence of information friction...|$|R
40|$|I {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that the banks' exposure to liquidity risk contributed to the contraction of mortgage credit during the financial crisis of 2007 - 2009.

These two sources of liquidity risk jointly accounted for a $ 41. 5 billion-$ 61. 9 billion contraction of mortgage credit during 2007 - 2009, or 5. 2 %- 7. 8 % of total mortgage originations during this period. ...|$|R

In this paper we evaluate the hypothesis that deregulation {{of financial}} markets in Korea provided the incentives and opportunities for a sequence of capital inflows and crisis. We show that deregulation was associated with <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>declines</b> <b>in</b> the franchise value of Korean banks. Banks responded by expanding their balance sheets and accumulating high risk, high return assets. The regulatory mechanism appears to have failed because of the failure to consolidate onshore and offshore activities of banks. Foreign banks that supplied deposits to Korean banks behaved {{as if they were}} insured in that they did not discriminate between weak and strong Korean banks. Finally, this expectation was validated at the time of crisis by government intervention that allowed foreign banks to liquidate their claims on Korean banks. ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} whether disclosure frequency induced myopia influences {{the types of}} firms that go public and their choice of listing exchanges if they decide to do so.

Second, at the firm level, public firms with longer cash conversion cycles relative to industry peers are more likely to list on exchanges that require less frequent mandatory disclosure to minimize disclosure frequency induced myopia. Furthermore, when the mandatory reporting frequency increased from semi-annual to quarterly, we observe <b>a</b> <b>sharper</b> <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> the percentage of public firms from industries whose cash conversion cycles are between one quarter and two quarters relative to those from other industries both in the United States and in the United Kingdom...|$|R
40|$|Background: 22 q 11. 2 {{deletion}} syndrome(22 q 11 DS) is {{the most}} common microdeletion syndrome in humans. The presence of learning difficulty is reported in the majority of individuals with 22 q 11 DS, but there is considerable heterogeneity in cognitive and educational profiles and in the age-related changes. Method: We assessed verbal, non-verbal and spatial abilities, and educational attainment of 18 children and adolescents with 22 q 11 DS at two time points five years apart. Results: There was a <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> full-scale IQ, with <b>a</b> <b>sharper</b> <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> verbal than non-verbal skills whereas spatial abilities remained stable over time. Individual profile analysis revealed discrepancies between full-scale IQ and reading skills, suggestive of‘hyperlexia’ for more than two thirds of participants. Conclusions: The relative strength in verbal ability observed in 22 q 11 DS is more apparent when children are younger and a more even cognitive profile is observed in older children and adolescents. Educational attainments keep pace with development, and literacy skills are globally higher than might be expected from full-scale IQ...|$|R

5|$|Dhaka {{suffered}} stagnation {{and decline}} began during the mid 19th-century.

In 1824, an Anglican bishop described Dhaka as a city of magnificent ruins. During the mutiny of 1857, the city witnessed revolts by the Bengal Army. The British Indian rule was established following the mutiny. It bestowed privileges on the Dhaka Nawab Family, which dominated the city's political and social elite.

5|$|If {{the patient}} {{presents}} {{less than eight}} hours after paracetamol overdose, then acetylcysteine significantly {{reduces the risk of}} serious hepatotoxicity and guarantees survival. If acetylcysteine is started more than 8hours after ingestion, there is <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> its effectiveness because the cascade of toxic events in the liver has already begun, and the risk of acute liver necrosis and death increases dramatically. Although acetylcysteine is most effective if given early, it still has beneficial effects if given as late as 48hours after ingestion. In clinical practice, if the patient presents more than eight hours after the paracetamol overdose, then activated charcoal is not useful, and acetylcysteine is started immediately. In earlier presentations, charcoal can be given when the patient arrives and acetylcysteine is initiated while waiting for the paracetamol level results to return from the laboratory.|$|E
5|$|In 1830 the new railway {{opened and}} by the end of the year was {{carrying}} freight. Bradshaw immediately went into competition by lowering the rates of carriage on the canal and by offering improved terms to the private carriers. By so doing he managed to maintain the volume of traffic carried by the canal, both freight and passengers, at a time when the country was suffering a trade depression. However Bradshaw's tactics led to <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> profits. At the same time costs were rising, partly due to the use of steamboats on the Mersey. Further competition came with the opening of the Macclesfield Canal in 1831 which gave separate access to Manchester from the Midlands. In November 1831 Bradshaw suffered a stroke, as a result of which he lost the use of his left arm and leg, and there is evidence that it also impaired his judgement.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. A., Psychology) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2013. Children {{exposed to}} {{violence}} and abuse {{have been found to}} exhibit emotional problems such as high emotional reactivity, which is indicative of maladaptive emotional regulation processes. Young children with dysregulated emotions have exhibited emotional and behavioral problems that can lead to more severe problems and psychopathology in later childhood. The present study evaluated emotional reactivity and emotional regulation among 186 maltreated children as compared to 33 non-maltreated children. Consistent with study hypotheses, child emotional reactivity as rated by caregivers was significantly negatively related to observed emotion regulation during caregiver-child interaction. Contrary to expectations, however, non-maltreated children showed <b>a</b> <b>sharper</b> <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> emotion regulation than maltreated children in response to increasingly aversive play situations with their caregivers, which may be due to lower baseline levels of regulation in the maltreated group. Study results suggest that examining emotion regulatory processes during dyadic interaction in a maltreated population is useful for developing a fuller understanding of the construct in a relationship context.

5|$|Marine mammals {{were first}} hunted by {{aboriginal}} peoples {{for food and}} other resources. Many were also the target for commercial industry, leading to <b>a</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>decline</b> <b>in</b> all populations of exploited species, such as whales and seals. Commercial hunting lead to the extinction of †Steller's sea cow and the †Caribbean monk seal. After commercial hunting ended, some species, such as the gray whale and northern elephant seal, have rebounded in numbers; conversely, other species, such as the North Atlantic right whale, are critically endangered. Other than hunting, marine mammals can be killed as bycatch from fisheries, where they become entangled in fixed netting and drown or starve. Increased ocean traffic causes collisions between fast ocean vessels and large marine mammals. Habitat degradation also threatens marine mammals {{and their ability to}} find and catch food. Noise pollution, for example, may adversely affect echolocating mammals, and the ongoing effects of global warming degrade arctic environments.|$|E
