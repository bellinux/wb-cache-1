The responsibilities of <b>a</b> <b>fly</b> crew include bringing battens in and out, keeping the fly system linesets in balance, and ensuring that the fly system's rope locks are applied when the associated linesets are not moving. Each member of the crew is called a flyman.

Fly-casting {{is one of the}} most significant issues in fly-fishing, In order to cast <b>a</b> lightweight <b>fly,</b> the weight of <b>a</b> <b>fly</b> line is utilized. Fling speed, the casting process and the loop shape of the line while in flight are important for the proper presentation of flies. Moreover, the shape of <b>a</b> <b>fly</b> line is also important for a long cast or controlled cast. In this paper, the fly-casting process is investigated experimentally.

5|$|The {{feathers}} of Archaeopteryx were asymmetrical. This {{has been interpreted}} as evidence that it was <b>a</b> <b>flyer,</b> because flightless birds tend to have symmetrical feathers. Some scientists, including Thomson and Speakman, have questioned this. They studied more than 70 families of living birds, and found that some flightless types do {{have a range of}} asymmetry in their feathers, and that the {{feathers of}} Archaeopteryx fall into this range. The degree of asymmetry seen in Archaeopteryx is more typical for slow flyers than for flightless birds.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to leading {{the team in}} points both {{in the regular season}} and playoffs, Clarke also holds the records for the most appearances and most assists for the Flyers in both regular season and playoffs. Fellow Stanley Cup winner Barber has scored the most goals for the team with his 420 regular season and 53 playoff goals. Rick Tocchet spent the most time in the penalty box during the regular season for the Flyers, accruing 1,817 minutes in total, while Dave Schultz's 363 penalty minutes are the most by <b>a</b> <b>Flyer</b> in the playoffs. Among goaltenders, Roman Cechmanek boasts the best goals against average and save percentage in the regular season (excluding Marc D'Amour and Robbie Moore, neither of whom made more than five appearances).|$|E
5|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Francis Lawrence and produced by Caleb Dewart of DNA Inc. The video deals directly with the lyrics' theme of Stefani's search for inspiration in songwriting. It opens with a lengthy non-musical section in which Stefani arrives in Los Angeles off of No Doubt's Rock Steady Tour. She receives several calls from Interscope label head Jimmy Iovine, who attempts to push her forward with her solo debut project, but she replies that she is tired and uninspired. After a failed studio attempt, Stefani sees <b>a</b> <b>flyer</b> advertising help for writer's block. Upon arrival she is asked {{to fill out a}} suspicious questionnaire, where the camera pans to the questions which will be important. She is then told that she will be billed when she is finished. She asks for clarification only to discover that she is already back in the studio by herself. When Stefani picks up an oversized pocket watch from the piano, a rabbit knick-knack that she had previously seen jumps across the room. She throws the watch at the knick-knack, causing her to fall back on her chair and find herself transported to a fantasy world based on Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass.|$|E

After Marty saves George from {{an oncoming}} car and is knocked unconscious, he awakens {{to find himself}} tended to by an infatuated Lorraine. Marty leaves and tracks down Doc's younger self to help him return to 1985. With no plutonium, Doc explains that the only power source capable of generating the necessary 1.21 gigawatts of electricity for the time machine is a bolt of lightning. Marty shows Doc <b>a</b> <b>flyer</b> from the future that recounts a lightning strike at the town's courthouse the coming Saturday night. Doc instructs Marty to not leave his house or interact with anyone, as he could inadvertently {{change the course of}} history and alter the future; because of this, Doc refuses to heed warnings from Marty about his death in 1985. Marty realizes that he has prevented his parents from meeting and Doc warns Marty that he will be erased from existence if he does not find a way to introduce George to Lorraine. Doc formulates a plan to harness the power of the lightning while Marty sets about introducing his parents, but he antagonizes Biff and his gang in the process.|$|E

However, his show depends on some tapes Desmond is carrying with him, but when Piz checks him into his hotel room, they are missing. Piz calls Veronica for the case and runs into Logan in the elevator. Desmond points to several potential suspects. Logan asks Mac for study help, and he agrees. Piz starts his show with Desmond, and it goes terribly, as Desmond makes racial epithets and sexual advances. Veronica and Piz track down a teacher, who denies involvement, but the pair find <b>a</b> <b>flyer</b> for a group that threatened to boycott Desmond’s show. Piz and Desmond talk about his past and start to make progress, but he ends up going to a party with Dick (Ryan Hansen) instead of playing guitar with Piz.|$|E
5|$|Winckel {{was born}} on 3 November 1912 in Muntok, Bangka Island, {{in what was then}} the Dutch East Indies. On the island his parents ran a trading store in {{commodities}} such as rubber, tin and sugar. Winckel had an untroubled childhood and at age fifteen was sent back to the Netherlands to study at the nautical school in Delfzijl. He stayed with his grandparents while studying, and three years later became a seaman first class for the merchant marine. He specialised in navigation. In 1931, when he was aged nineteen, Winckel started working as a quartermaster on the freighter Pallau, which sailed between the Netherlands and Java. After his work on the ship he went to the island of Borneo to work on oil rigs. By 1935 he returned to the Netherlands once more, this time to work for the Royal Netherlands Navy as a submarine torpedo calibrator. During his time at the Navy a friend showed him <b>a</b> <b>flyer</b> for a pilot position at the Netherlands East Indies Air Force, which was being formed at the time. Winckel joined the Air Force in 1935 and became a pilot at age 23. Between 1935 and 1942 he flew transports across the Dutch East Indies, mainly in Lockheed Lodestars.|$|E
