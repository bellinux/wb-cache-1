5|$|Reflecting on his {{stint in}} first season of Indian Super League, Chopra {{admitted}} that ISL {{turned out to}} be much more intense and competitive than he had anticipated. He said“I think there were a few things that went wrong; I underestimated the ISL. I {{thought it was going to}} be easier than it was, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> picked up a hamstring injury in pre-season which set me back.|$|E
5|$|You are right. I did {{not think}} anything. I wasn’t thinking. I was feeling and I was dying. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> was just like, You can’t go down like this! You have to turn this into music. You have to try, at least. I was so embarrassed by just everything. I just didn’t {{want to be that}} person that just went down after all of that. A lot of the time in the sessions, they weren’t letting me write. They were giving me tracks and doing it all. I was like, Why am I here? Then I got the perfect {{combination}} of people to really support me and make me feel confident. It was an amazing awakening. I walked into the session and I was like, You gotta know, I don’t care about anything except the truth right here.|$|E
5|$|C'est trop bête d'en parler (It's {{too stupid}} to talk about). There was a break. Coppi {{attacked}}. His brother Fausto gave him a push to get him away. He wanted his brother to win. I waited a bit <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> attacked and I caught him and the break. Then I went off by myself. I {{was going to win}} Paris–Roubaix. At the entrance to the vélodrome, there were crowds everywhere, blocking the way. I looked around for where to go and I was directed round the outside wall of the track, to where the team cars had to park. It wasn't like nowadays, when there's television and everything. Then it was more chaotic and the whole road was blocked. People said I should have known the way into the track. But how do you know a thing like {{that at the end of}} Paris–Roubaix, when you've raced all day over roads like that? A gendarme signalled the way to go and that's the way I went.|$|E

5|$|In {{the case}} of '4 Minutes', Tim had a vision from the {{beginning}} of how things should go, especially sonically... When I opened up the session of '4 Minutes', there was so much going on that I knew right away that the hard part would be {{to make sure that the}} vocals would cut through and were right in the pocket. Beginning with working on the vocals was the only way to achieve this. After that I formed all the other parts around the vocals. The other challenge was to make sure that everything in the track sounded clear and that you could hear every instrument, every syllable, every breath. Also, I do almost always work linear in time on a track. It's easier, because when you're done, you're done. So I keep working on section after section, until I get to the end of the track <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> know the whole mix is pretty close.|$|E
5|$|When {{asked in}} an {{interview}} with Robert Canning of IGN about how she felt about being asked to come on to Angel after previously being killed off, Benz commented: I was shocked. I just thought once you poof'd, you poof'd! I thought that was it. So when they threw it out to me that I was coming back... They didn't tell me they were bringing her back to life. They just sent me the script for the season finale for season one of Angel, when they rose me from the dead. I was reading the script, and half way through, Darla still hadn't shown up. Benz went on to add, I was like, 'Alright...' I get three quarters of the way through and I think, 'Maybe they sent me the wrong script...?' <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> get to the last page, and I was like, 'Oh my god! I can't believe this! This is so cool!' At that time I'd been committed to another project too. We didn't even know if I was going to be available or not. But it all ended up working out.|$|E

25|$|I Was Looking at the Ceiling <b>and</b> <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> Saw the Sky (1995): A stage {{piece with}} {{libretto}} by June Jordan and staging by Peter Sellars.

25|$|Then almost, but {{not quite}} {{simultaneously}} (to ensure separate neural recognition), you touch the undersurface of the hand (wrist) so gently that it barely suggests an upward push.

25|$|Now <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> am {{asked by}} colleagues, students, and journalists: who, in my opinion, {{are the most}} respectable critics of my {{position}} on the race-IQ issue? The name James R. Flynn {{is by far the}} first that comes to mind. His book, Race, IQ and Jensen (1980), is a distinguished contribution to the literature on this topic, and, among the critiques I have seen of my position, is virtually in a class by itself for objectivity, thoroughness, and scholarly integrity.|$|E

25|$|Lead singer Stephen Christian met bassist Deon Rexroat {{while they}} were both in high school, and they formed a punk band called SaGoh 24/7. Drummer Sean Hutson and guitarist Joseph Milligan joined the group as well. The band {{released}} two albums, Servants After God's Own Heart (1999), <b>and</b> <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> Corrupt Youth (2001), both under Rescue Records. After the albums sold only 1,300 units, Hutson left the band to start a family, and Nathan Young was brought in as a replacement.|$|E
25|$|After {{this she}} was {{thrashing}} {{around on the}} ground. She was trying to scream but nothing was coming out. I think I kicked her because she wouldn't keep still. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> put my foot on to her to keep her still. This didn't work so I stabbed her in the throat. I aimed and stabbed at the hard thing in her neck. I pushed the knife {{all the way in}} but she still wouldn't keep still so I worked out where her heart would be and I stabbed her {{on the left side of}} the chest.|$|E
25|$|There {{are more}} characters, {{and three of}} them {{basically}} {{changed the course of}} British history. King Edward VIII abdicated the throne to be with an American woman, Wallis Simpson, and that's part of my story, so I've had to do an enormous amount of research and interview people. So I have an enormous responsibility to that, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> have a responsibility to the actual auction, which really happened. Then there's the new story, the point of view, which is this girl who has this obsession and is going to the auctions and stuff. So it's a much more layered, complicated piece than Filth and Wisdom.|$|E

25|$|I {{was getting}} so heavy that even my vocalizing was getting heavy. I was tiring myself, I was perspiring too much, and I was really working too hard. And I wasn't really well, as in health; I couldn't move freely. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> {{was tired of}} playing a game, for {{instance}} playing this beautiful young woman, and I was heavy and uncomfortable to move around. In any case, it was uncomfortable and I didn't like it. So I felt now if I'm going to do things right—I've studied all my life to put things right musically, so why don't I diet and put myself into a certain condition where I'm presentable.|$|E
25|$|The 29th had dawned calm, {{but while}} we were still trying to persuade {{ourselves}} that the tragedy was over and the volcano had exhausted its bowels, at about 8 o'clock, we heard a crash <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> noticed that smoke was rising {{from the point of}} the island that looks towards east. The smoke spread very gradually as far as the crater of the volcano, while there were many whiffs issuing from points in the direction of another headland. I realized that the island had opened in these places and fearing that, if a crater should open below the water, an explosion might follow, much more formidable than the preceding ones, I mounted a horse and retired permanently to the Sanctuary of Caysasay.|$|E
25|$|My uncle Claude was my {{favorite}} uncle, he was also my godfather. He and I were really, really close. He used {{to take me to}} see cowboy movies all the time when I was a little boy because I loved cowboy movies. He got a cowboy name for me, which was Smokey Joe. So from the time I was three years old if people asked me what my name was I didn't tell them my name was William, I told them my name was Smokey Joe. That's what everyone called me until I was about 12 <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> dropped the Joe part. I've heard that story about him giving it to me because I'm a light skinned Black man but that's not true.|$|E

25|$|I get {{the tune}} <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> {{just keep on}} singing the tune until the words come out from the tune. It's kind of a {{hypnotic}} state that you reach after a while when you keep on playing it where words just evolve from it. So you take those words and just let them go whichever way they want...'Moonshadow'? Funny, that was in Spain, I went there alone, completely alone, {{to get away from}} a few things. And I was dancin' on the rocks there... right on the rocks where the waves were, like, blowin' and splashin'. Really, it was so fantastic. And the moon was bright, ya know, and I started dancin' and singin' and I sang that song and it stayed. It's just the kind of moment that you want to find when you're writin' songs.|$|E
