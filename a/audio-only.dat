Sticky & Sweet Tour became Madonna's 19th top-ten album on the Billboard 200, thus tying her with Bob Dylan for sixth place among acts with the most top 10s in the chart's 54-year history, trailing The Rolling Stones (with 36), Frank Sinatra (33), The Beatles and Barbra Streisand (30) and Elvis Presley (27).

Each model was {{made available for}} purchase the same day for US$35. Days later, Amazon.com {{announced that it would}} ban the sale of Chromecast and Apple TV devices, presumably because they compete with Amazon's own Fire TV and Fire TV Stick.|$|E

25|$|Crystals: Described {{as smooth}} spheres of glass, {{crystals}} are imbued with spells which {{allow them to}} be used for communication, and thus take the place of radios in the world. If operated away from a power point or ley line, they require regular recharging by some other means, which in one instance in the series involves the sacrifice of captive humans for their life energy which is used to power the crystal. Crystals can operate as videophones, showing an image of the person at the other end, as well as in <b>audio-only</b> mode. The emanations by which speech and images are transmitted between them are subject to interception by other mages, something {{at the forefront of the}} minds of most military planners in the series.|$|E
25|$|Radio {{broadcasts}} {{since the}} 1970s {{and into the}} mid-2000s varied between WBBM (780) and WMAQ/WSCR (670), and often came into conflict with White Sox baseball {{by the start of}} April. On April 30, 2008, the team signed a three-year deal with WGN Radio (720 AM), with games airing alternately instead on WIND (560 AM) in scheduling conflict situations during the baseball season due to the Cubs having contractual preference to air on WGN; these moved to WGWG-LP (Channel 6/87.7 FM, an analog television station carrying an <b>audio-only</b> sports talk format using a quirk in the FM band) in mid-2014 when Tribune began a local marketing agreement with that station's owner. During the 2010 Stanley Cup Finals, the Cubs agreed to allow the Blackhawks games to be broadcast on WGN and have the Cubs revert to WIND when there was a conflict. This allowed the Finals games to be heard over a larger area due to WGN's clear-channel signal. All Blackhawk games are also streamed live on wgnradio.com, regardless of whether the games are on WGN or WGWG-LP. WLUP-FM (97.9 FM) is also utilized as an alternate station.|$|E
500|$|... "I'll Cry Instead" [...] {{was among}} several songs {{considered}} for the film but ultimately not included either as an on-camera performance or for usage as an <b>audio-only</b> track. It was to be used during the [...] "escape/fire escape" [...] sequence of the film, but ultimately director Richard Lester vetoed it because of its downbeat lyrics and it was replaced for that scene by [...] "Can't Buy Me Love". Its status as an early contender for inclusion led to the song being included on the US soundtrack album.|$|E

2500|$|Four minutes {{following}} ABC's radio bulletin, CBS was {{the first}} to break the news over television at 12:40p.m. CST/1:40p.m. EST.

2500|$|Cronkite {{remained}} at the CBS anchor desk the entire time. Initially, the live broadcast of As the World Turns continued, with the actors unaware of the earlier pre-emption for the bulletin.

2500|$|On December 10, 2011, C.K. {{released}} his fourth full-length special, Live at the Beacon Theater. Like Hilarious, it was produced independently {{and directed by}} C.K. However, unlike his earlier work, it was distributed digitally on the comedian's website, foregoing both physical and broadcast media. C.K. released the special for $5.00 and without DRM, hoping that these factors and the direct relationship between the artist and consumer would effectively deter piracy. At {{the end of the}} special, the release of a new album, recorded at Carnegie Hall the previous year, is mentioned. By December 21, 2011, the sales of the special from C.K.'s website had already earned him over $1 million. The success of the special prompted other comedians, including Jim Gaffigan, Joe Rogan, and Aziz Ansari, to release their own specials with a similar business model. On May 11, 2012, C.K. additionally made two <b>audio-only</b> downloads available for $5.00 each: [...] (and the audio version of his first HBO stand-up special, Shameless), as well as an <b>audio-only</b> version of Live at the Beacon Theater.

It was also sold and distributed using the same model as C.K. used for Live at the Beacon Theater.|$|E
2500|$|As {{was common}} {{practice}} at the time, the BBC's copies of the serial were junked after broadcast and {{the bulk of the}} serial remains missing to this day. In 2005, a copy of the sixth episode, [...] "The Face of the Tiger", was returned to the BBC archives by a private collector; this is missing the pre-credits sequence of Reinhart's interview. A number of film clips from episodes one, two, three, and seven also exist, as does a full <b>audio-only</b> copy of episode seven, taken from an off-air recording. A complete set of off-air photographs, known as tele-snaps, were taken of all seven episodes and are held in the collection of Michael Hayes.|$|E
2500|$|Google Duo video {{calls are}} in 720p HD video. It is {{optimized}} for low-bandwidth mobile networks through WebRTC and uses QUIC over UDP. Optimization is further achieved through {{the degradation of}} video quality through monitoring network quality.

End-to-end encryption is enabled by default. Duo is based on phone numbers, allowing users to call people from their contact list. The app automatically switches between Wi-Fi and cellular networks. In March 2017, {{it was announced that}} Google Duo would let users make <b>audio-only</b> calls. The feature was first launched in Brazil, with a global rollout in April.|$|E
2500|$|Voiced by Bill Oddie, Grimbling is a [...] "dirty old man" [...] {{who often}} {{appears as a}} groundsman, butler, or some similar profession.

He memorably introduces himself in the 25th anniversary episode [...] "I am Grimbling, but don't worry, I'll clean it up later." [...] In the same episode, Cleese asks him [...] "Aren't you a little past it, old man?" [...] with the response, [...] "No, I'm a little dirty old man". In the [...] "Robin Hood" [...] sketch in the 3rd series, Grimbling is in the employ of the Sheriff of Nottingham (Garden), who tells him, [...] "You have done well, Grimbling; take this tennis racquet for your services".|$|E
2500|$|At that time, As the World Turns was {{the runaway}} top-rated daytime show, and ABC and NBC made no {{concerted effort to}} compete with CBS in the time slot; as a result, the other {{television}} networks weren't {{on the air in}} the Eastern and Central Time Zones. Various programs were being broadcast through their affiliate stations. From their main headquarters in New York, WABC-TV's first bulletin came from Ed Silverman at 1:42p.m. EST, also interrupting a rerun of Father Knows Best in the Mountain Time Zone on the ABC-TV network; ABC-TV was not feeding programming to its affiliates in the Pacific Time Zone at that hour. Three minutes later, Don Pardo broke into WNBC-TV's local rerun of Bachelor Father with the news, saying (reading AP bulletin) 'PRESIDENT KENNEDY WAS SHOT TODAY JUST AS HIS MOTORCADE LEFT DOWNTOWN DALLAS. MRS. KENNEDY JUMPED UP AND GRABBED MR. KENNEDY. SHE CRIED 'OH NO!' THE MOTORCADE SPED ON.' (Videotape of the NBC bulletins have been assumed [...] "lost" [...] as they did not start recording coverage until minutes later. However, audio engineer Phil Gries rolled tape on a set of audio recordings on a 1/4" [...] reel to reel audiotape recorder. These have been donated to the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library. However, NBC, in its book on the coverage of the assassination, mentioned the bulletins.) At 1:53p.m. (EST), NBC broke into programming with a NBC Network bumper slide and Chet Huntley, Bill Ryan, and Frank McGee informing the viewers what was going on as it happened. However, NBC's camera was not ready and the coverage was limited to <b>audio-only</b> reports as CBS' coverage had been to that point. Other than for two <b>audio-only</b> bulletins (one following the initial report), ABC did not break into its stations' programming at all, instead waiting until the network was to return to broadcasting at 2:00p.m. Eastern to begin its coverage.|$|E
