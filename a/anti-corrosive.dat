500|$|Chromium salts (chromates) {{are also}} the cause of {{allergic}} reactions in some people. Chromates are often used to manufacture, amongst other things, leather products, paints, cement, mortar and <b>anti-corrosives.</b> Contact with products containing chromates can lead to allergic contact dermatitis and irritant dermatitis, resulting in ulceration of the skin, {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "chrome ulcers". This condition is often found in workers that have been exposed to strong chromate solutions in electroplating, tanning and chrome-producing manufacturers.|$|R
40|$|Triazoles and benzo triazoles (TAZ/BTAZ) are {{potentially}} hazardous chemicals that adversely affect humans and other non-target species, and {{are on the}} list of substances of very high concern (SVHC) in the European regulation of chemicals REACH. TAZ/BTAZ are synthetic molecules used in various industrial processes (to obtain pharmaceuticals and agricultural products), and have a wide application as <b>anti-corrosives,</b> cleansing agents for textiles, flame retardants, photographic emulsions, etc…Furthermore they are abundantly used as components of liquid deicing agents for aircraft and airport runways. Because of their wide use they have been found distributed throughout the environment, mainly in water compartments. The amount of experimental data available for these molecules is insufficient for a comprehensive characterization of their environmental and toxicological profile and they have been included among the four classes of chemicals studied in the European FP 7 Project CADASTER (CAse studies on the Development and Application of in Silico Techniques for Environmental hazard and Risk assessment). In this study we investigated and modeled by QSAR different endpoints of interest to define the potential aquatic toxicological profile of hundreds of TAZ/BTAZ, and the possible correlations among their aquatic and mammalian toxicity. The studied end-points were: LC 50 in Onchorhynchus Mykiss, EC 50 in Daphnia Magna, and EC 50 in algae. Data for mammalian acute toxicity in rat (LD 50 oral exposure) were also investigated and modeled. Different theoretical molecular descriptors were calculated by different proprietary and freely available online software (DRAGON, Hyperchem, and the CADASTER online platform for the calculation of molecular descriptors – www. cadaster. eu). The endpoints of interest were modeled by multiple linear regression (MLR) and the Genetic Algorithm was used to select the relevant molecular descriptors by the MLR-Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method. The best models were validated for their predictive performance using leave-one-out, bootstrap and the scrambling of the responses. External validation was also performed depending on the dimension of the studied experimental datasets. The reliability of the predictions was always checked by the leverage approach in order to verify the chemical applicability domain of the models...|$|R
25|$|Alkanes from {{hexadecane}} upwards {{form the}} most important components of fuel oil and lubricating oil. In the latter function, they work {{at the same time}} as <b>anti-corrosive</b> agents, as their hydrophobic nature means that water cannot reach the metal surface. Many solid alkanes find use as paraffin wax, for example, in candles. This should not be confused however with true wax, which consists primarily of esters.|$|E
25|$|Painting {{either by}} roller or brush is more {{desirable}} for tight spaces; spray {{would be better}} for larger coating areas such as steel decks and waterfront applications. Flexible polyurethane coatings, like Durabak-M26 for example, can provide an <b>anti-corrosive</b> seal with a highly durable slip resistant membrane. Painted coatings are relatively easy to apply and have fast drying times although temperature and humidity may cause dry times to vary.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of the}} {{acquisition}} program the Portuguese Air Force received equipment and its technicians were instructed {{in the first two}} echelons of maintenance. The first echelon performed by the squadron mechanics was responsible for service of the aircraft and their equipment, preflight and daily inspections, light repairs, <b>anti-corrosive</b> treatments, parts replacement, and refueling, while the second echelon was carried out at dedicated facilities at Monte Real Air Base (BA5) and was responsible for the periodic preventive inspections and the periodic servicing for the systems, engines and other aircraft equipment.|$|E
25|$|Lead tetraoxide is {{most often}} used as a pigment for primer paints for iron objects. Due to its toxicity, its use is being limited. In the past, it was used in {{combination}} with linseed oil as a thick, long-lasting <b>anti-corrosive</b> paint. The combination of minium and linen fibres was also used for plumbing, now replaced with PTFE tape. Currently it is mostly used for manufacture of glass, especially lead crystal glass. It finds limited use in some amateur pyrotechnics as a delay charge and {{was used in the}} past in the manufacture of dragon's egg pyrotechnic stars.|$|E
25|$|In 1969, Colonel O.B. Philp, Base Commander of CFB Moose Jaw {{and former}} {{leader of the}} defunct Golden Centennaires {{aerobatic}} team, considered using several of the leftover Golden Centennaire CT-114 Tutor aircraft for another team. These Tutors were still fitted for aerobatic flying and because of some minor corrosion, had been painted with white <b>anti-corrosive</b> paint. Philp, at this point, did not receive approval to form the new team; however, approval had been given for single Tutors to provide simple flypasts at local pro football games. To further the cause of an aerobatic team, Philp began informal enhanced formation practice for the instructors at 2 Canadian Forces Flying Training School {{with the aim of}} providing multi-aircraft flypasts at special events. In 1970, four-aircraft formations began providing flypasts at fairs and festivals, as well as Armed Forces Day at CFB Moose Jaw. In July 1970, a white Tutor was introduced to the formation for flypasts. Four white Tutors were finally flown together at the Abbotsford Air Show, followed by a flypast in Winnipeg. Known as the 2 Canadian Forces Flying Training School Formation Team, or informally as the Tutor Whites, the team grew in size to seven aircraft in 1971 using eleven pilots, and gradually gained recognition. Formation flypasts were replaced with more complicated manoeuvres, and more aircraft were added as the team matured.|$|E
25|$|Boric acid in {{equilibrium}} {{with its}} conjugate base the borate ion {{is widely used}} (in the concentration range 50 - 100ppm boron equivalents) as a primary or adjunct pH buffer system in swimming pools. Boric acid is a weak acid, with pKa (the pH at which buffering is strongest because the free acid and borate ion are in equal concentrations) of 9.24 in pure water at 25°C. But apparent pKa is substantially lower in swimming pool or ocean waters because of interactions with various other molecules in solution. It will be around 9.0 in a salt-water pool. No matter which form of soluble boron is added, within the acceptable range of pH and boron concentration for swimming pools, boric acid is the predominant form in aqueous solution, {{as shown in the}} accompanying figure. The boric acid - borate system can be useful as a primary buffer system (substituting for the bicarbonate system with pKa1 = 6.0 and pKa2 = 9.4 under typical salt-water pool conditions) in pools with salt-water chlorine generators that tend to show upward drift in pH from a working range of pH 7.5 - 8.2. Buffer capacity is greater against rising pH (towards the pKa around 9.0), as illustrated in the accompanying graph. The use of boric acid in this concentration range does not allow any reduction in free HOCl concentration needed for pool sanitation, but it may add marginally to the photo-protective effects of cyanuric acid and confer other benefits through <b>anti-corrosive</b> activity or perceived water softness, depending on overall pool solute composition.|$|E

It's also projected for the ships to have some additional armament and new features.|$|E

2500|$|Ten modern {{stainless}} steel bus shelters have been erected near the beach.

A total of 14 galleries with seating arrangements and a 4-m internal walkway along the sands and fountains have been created on the [...] stretch from the Anna Square to the Lighthouse. This stretch has uninterrupted pavement and a sub-road parallel to the main road. Five reverse osmosis plants capable of providing 30,000 litres of drinking water an hour free of cost to visitors is under construction. As part of the beautification project, the decade-old 250-watt lamps were replaced with 690 <b>anti-corrosive</b> lamps along Kamaraj Salai and the service road. The renovation was completed in December 2009 {{at a cost of}} [...] 259.2 million.
