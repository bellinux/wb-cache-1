Apart from the 3,000 warriors hidden behind the Ottoman army, Skanderbeg left another reserve force of 3,000 {{under the command of}} Vrana Konti. The Albanian army was positioned in a crescent shape curving inwards. They were divided into three groups, each composed of 3,000 men. They were all placed {{at the bottom of a}} hill, with the intention of luring the Ottoman cavalry-based army into a downhill charge. The Albanian left wing was commanded by Tanush Thopia with 1,500 horsemen and <b>an</b> <b>equal</b> <b>number</b> of infantrymen. On the right wing, Skanderbeg placed Moisi Golemi in the same manner as Thopia. In front of the wings, foot archers were placed to lure the Ottomans in. In the center, there were 3,000 men under the command of Skanderbeg and Ajdin Muzaka. One-thousand horsemen were placed in front of the main division with orders to blunt the initial Turkish cavalry charge. <b>An</b> <b>equal</b> <b>number</b> of archers, trained to accompany the horses, was placed next to these horsemen.

40|$|The Pseudo-Smarandache Function is part {{of number}} theory. The {{function}} comes from the Smarandache Function. The Pseudo-Smarandache Function is represented by Z(n) where n represents any natural number. The value for a given Z(n) is the smallest integer such that 1 + 2 + 3 + [...] . + Z(n) is divisible by n. WIthin the Pseudo-Smarandache Function, there are several fonnuJas which {{make it easier to}} find the Z(n) values. Formulas have been developed for most numbers including: a) p, where p <b>equals</b> <b>a</b> prime <b>number</b> greater than two; b) b, where p <b>equals</b> <b>a</b> prime <b>number,</b> x <b>equals</b> <b>a</b> natural <b>number,</b> and b=px; c) X, where x <b>equals</b> <b>a</b> natural <b>number,</b> if xJ 2 <b>equals</b> <b>an</b> odd <b>number</b> greater than two; d) x, where x <b>equals</b> <b>a</b> natural <b>number,</b> ifxJ 3 <b>equals</b> <b>a</b> prime <b>number</b> greater than three. Therefore, formulas exist in the Pseudo-Smarandache Function for all values ofb except for the following: a) x, where x = a natural number, ifxJ 3 = a nonprime number whose factorization is not 3 ~. b) multiples offour that are not powers of two. All of these formulas are proven, and their use greatly reduces the effort needed to find Z(n) values. Keywords...|$|R

5|$|After {{treating}} the Thessalian families of Peisidice and Canace, the poet {{turned to the}} intermingled Aetolian-Elian lines of Calyce and Perimede. Perimede had earlier in the book borne two sons to the river Achelous, {{one of whom was}} the grandfather of Oeneus, Hippodamas. To Aethlius Calyce bore Endymion, whose son Aetolus was the eponym of Aetolia and the great-grandfather of Demodice and Porthaon, through whom the later Aetolian and Elian genealogies were traced. Somewhere within these families, Eurytus and Cteatus were found in a form more fearsome {{than they were in the}} Iliad: in the Catalogue they were fierce conjoined twins with two heads, four arms and <b>an</b> <b>equal</b> <b>number</b> of legs. Most significant for the epic tradition, however, was the marriage of Demodice's son Thestius and Porthaon's daughter Eurythemiste which produced the daughters Leda, Althaea and Hypermestra, who are introduced in a group Ehoiai at fr. 23a.3–5.|$|E
5|$|As {{shown in}} the table, {{the total number of}} {{possible}} combinations to have an equal (conserved) number of A and B alleles is six, and its probability is 6/16. The total number of possible alternative combinations is ten, and the probability of unequal number of A and B alleles is 10/16. Thus, although the original colony began with <b>an</b> <b>equal</b> <b>number</b> of A and B alleles, chances are that the number of alleles in the remaining population of four members will not be equal. In the latter case, genetic drift has occurred because the population's allele frequencies have changed due to random sampling. In this example the population contracted to just four random survivors, a phenomenon known as population bottleneck.|$|E
