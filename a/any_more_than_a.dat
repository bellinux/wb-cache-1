5|$|Up to {{this point}} the Redman {{investment}} {{had not been a}} notable success: in the decade to 1934, despite an additional capital injection by Churchill, the business had made losses in half of the years, and in only one of the other years had it made <b>any</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> modest profit. However, growth was steady after 1934, with profits of £23,000, £38,000, £54,000 and then a large jump to £139,000 in 1938. By 1939 the Redman operation alone employed 300 people, compared to around 30 in 1920. Motor industry expansion assisted in this growth, with Ford becoming a customer and Gabriel setting up a new machine tool division at Coventry Road, South Yardley, Birmingham, in 1938 to give easy access for the industry's centre, but rearmament was the most significant factor.|$|E

Companies marketing the berries often propagate the unsupported claim that a Chinese man named Li Qing Yuen, who {{was said to have}} consumed wolfberries daily, lived to the age of 256 years (1677–1933).

25|$|In Australian ISL mines (Beverley, Four Mile and Honeymoon Mine) the oxidant used is {{hydrogen}} peroxide and the complexing agent sulfuric acid. Kazakh ISL mines {{generally do not}} employ an oxidant but use much higher acid concentrations in the circulating solutions.

500|$|Fenwick {{cites the}} secrecy of the est {{organization}} as {{an impediment to}} meaningful study, and states that the studies cited by est itself are inadequate and inconclusive. Fenwick writes {{that a lack of}} [...] "sophisticated research designs" [...] limits the ability to properly determine long-term benefits or harm caused by the course and notes: [...] "est uses techniques indiscriminately which, in a certain proportion of the population, are known to be harmful and potentially quite dangerous". She concludes {{that it is difficult to}} determine whether est [...] "produces <b>any</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> superficial catharsis, or whether it might be harmful to certain people," [...] and states that the long-range effects of the training are unknown.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{reviewed}} positively by reviewers {{of the trade}} publications. A very positive review by Walton of The Moving Picture News states, [...] " [...] tale of deep, sterling, human interest. The whole plot is so simple, so refreshingly lucid and pure. We cannot criticize this film <b>any</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> man could analyze mother love. There is a tenderness - and pathos - that is as a nimbus to the whole. The acting of the blind girl, natural, and exquisite, and of her little sister is sweetly innocent. We saw this film twice, {{on the day of}} release, in different theatres, and in each case large audiences were touched - and also highly amused by the little girl in the carriage. A sweeter, purer, human-interest tale has not been put on the curtain. The prayer scene deserves to be limned by a master hands that lesson to our children's children. Had we space we could tell the comments of men and women on this production. One thing may be said and that is, all saw and realized the pathos, the beauty and the triumph of the work. Had the film been acted in a theatre we feel certain the audience, with ourselves, with one acclaim would have declared these two orphan girls as manifestations, in the hour of need, of the highest and best emotions of the race!" [...] The Moving Picture Worlds reviewer was also positive and concluded that, [...] "Such films are helpful because they make nearly despairing men sometimes hopeful, and as long as hope lasts there is opportunity for achievement." [...] Even the reviewer of The New York Dramatic Mirror offered praise for Marie Eline's acting ability in particular, but found no fault with the production itself. Bowers notes that the Mirror was not without its detractors and was accused of being a tool of the Edison Trust companies, but reviews for Thanhouser films were amongst the most perceptive.|$|E

5000|$|The {{original}} fundamentalist movement divided along {{clearly defined}} lines within conservative evangelical Protestantism as issues progressed. Many groupings, large and small, were produced by this schism. Neo-evangelicalism, Reformed and Lutheran Confessionalism, the Heritage movement, and Paleo-Orthodoxy have all developed distinct identities, {{but none of}} them acknowledge <b>any</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> historical overlap with the fundamentalist movement, and the term is seldom used of them.

6000|$|Again it {{is claimed}} {{that by the}} resolutions of the Illinois Legislature, passed in 1851, {{the repeal of the}} Missouri Compromise was demanded. This I deny also. Whatever may be worked out by a {{criticism}} of the language of those resolutions, the people have never understood them as being <b>any</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> indorsement of the compromises of 1850, and a release of our senators from voting for the Wilmot Proviso. The whole people are living witnesses that this only was their view.

2500|$|However, in All for Australia he criticised {{the belief}} that [...] "immigration policy should {{primarily}} reflect the truth that all 'races' are equal. On the contrary, an immigration policy should not, <b>any</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> trade or tariff policy, be designed primarily to reflect that fact". According to Blainey, the Australian government's immigration policy was increasingly being influenced by multicultural ideology {{to the detriment of}} the national interest and the majority of Australians. He argued: [...] "We are surrendering much of our own independence to a phantom opinion that floats vaguely in the air and rarely exists on this earth. We should think very carefully about the perils of converting Australia into a giant multicultural laboratory for the assumed benefit of the peoples of the world". Blainey also warned that the [...] "crimson thread of kinship" [...] invoked by Sir Henry Parkes was being undermined, stating: [...] "The cult of the immigrant, the emphasis on separateness for ethnic groups, the wooing of Asia and the shunning of Britain are part of this thread-cutting." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{deciphering}} {{the patent}} legalese, it becomes apparent that Toulmin did not patent the airplane. [...] Rather, Toulmin patented airplane (flying-machine) wing edges (lateral marginal portions) that normally are flat but may {{move up and}} down in a direction that is different from the airplane's line of flight and may be moved to different angles. [...] Although the patent particularly addressed a solid wing with a portion of the wing (the marginal portions) being flexed (warped) to provide lift, the patent claim was not so limiting. [...] In particular, Toulmin's genius as a patent attorney predicated and helped the Wright Brothers patent slats, the spoiler, the aileron, the flaps, the elevator, and the Rudder for an airplane (see picture above). [...] Without these, an airplane cannot be controlled <b>any</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> car can be controlled without movable wheels. [...] Without a license to the Wright brothers' patent, it was not legally possible to build or fly a controllable airplane in the early 20th century. [...] Unsurprisingly, the verbal and legal attacks by competitors on the Wright Brothers began almost immediately.|$|E

40|$|Within {{the scope}} of {{contemporary}} discourses on transcendence, this article presents and critically discusses the four models of transcendence that have been identified by the Dutch theologian Wessel Stoker. Two questions guide the discussion, namely whether our thinking of transcendence is <b>any</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> unconscious way of being caught up in certain hard-to-shake spatializing and / or representational schemas, and how far we can interpret / translate the various phenomena of transcendence in terms of modal transformations {{of the quality of}} our responses to the world and to others, setting aside all onto-theological constructions referring to a beyond. To answer these questions, an argument is developed and motivated for relocating reflection on transcendence, and at the same time, pointers are formulated that should be considered in pursuing an interdisciplinary understanding of transcendence.
