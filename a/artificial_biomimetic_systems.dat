40|$|Future {{technologies}} {{aiming at}} restoring and enhancing organs function will intimately rely on near-physiological and energy-efficient communication between living and <b>artificial</b> <b>biomimetic</b> <b>systems.</b> Interfacing brain-inspired devices {{with the real}} brain {{is at the forefront}} of such emerging field, with the term ‘neurobiohybrids’ indicating all those systems where such interaction is established. We argue that achieving a ‘high-level’ communication and functional synergy between natural and artificial neuronal networks in vivo, will allow the development of a heterogeneous world of neurobiohybrids, which will include ‘living robots’ but will also embrace ‘intelligent’ neuroprostheses for augmentation of brain function. The societal and economical impact of intelligent neuroprostheses is likely to be potentially strong, as they will offer novel therapeutic perspectives for a number of diseases, and going beyond classical pharmaceutical schemes. However, they will unavoidably raise fundamental ethical questions on the intermingling between man and machine and, more specifically, on how deeply it should be allowed that brain processing is affected by implanted ‘intelligent’ artificial systems. Following this perspective, we provide the reader with insights on ongoing developments and trends in the field of neurobiohybrids. We address the topic also from a ‘community building’ perspective, showing through a quantitative bibliographic analysis, how scientists working on the engineering of brain-inspired devices and brain-machine interfaces are increasing their interactions. We foresee that such trend preludes to a formidable technological and scientific revolution in brain-machine communication and to the opening of new avenues for restoring or even augmenting brain function for therapeutic purposes...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} decades Electron Paramagnetic Resonance {{spectroscopy}} has significantly developed as a versatile tool for the investigation of complex paramagnetic centers. Since then several microwave pulse sequences have been designed in order to disentangle the magnetic interactions between the unpaired electrons and the magnetically active surrounding. Despite their reactivity, paramagnetic centers are quite diffuse in biological systems, where they are usually involved in the key roles of the entire enzymatic activity of proteins. Many enzymes rely on paramagnetic transition metal centers for their catalytic role while different organic and metallic paramagnetic centers are essential in the whole photosynthetic process. In this thesis work advanced Electron Paramagnetic Resonance spectroscopy is exploited to deeply investigate the structure and the surrounding of three different classes of paramagnetic centers, which are present in proteins and <b>artificial</b> <b>biomimetic</b> <b>systems</b> and all being involved, directly or indirectly, in the sunlight energy conversion process that brings energy from the Sun to the Earth. The peptide environment of the active site of a protein is known to play a peculiar role in the fine tuning of the whole activity of the protein, for this reason {{the investigation of the}} surrounding of the paramagnetic center turn to be crucial for a correct and comprehensive description of the energy conversion pathway. The first system here investigated is the reduced iron-sulfur cluster of the HydF protein, an enzyme involved in the correct maturation of the [Fe-Fe]-hydrogenase. Up to date the entire maturation pathway is still unclear, so that a multi-layered description at molecular level {{of the role of the}} HydF protein is of fundamental meaning. Then the investigation moves to the triplet state of the carotenoid involved in the photoprotection mechanism inside the Peridinin - Chlorophyll a – Protein. In this case a water molecule has been identified as an active and conserved player in the energy transfer process between the pigments. Finally, we have explored the feasibility of employing the photoexcited triplet state of tetraphenylporphyrin as a spin probe for the Double-Electron-Electron-Resonance technique on several artificial biomimetic compounds. The introduction of this novel spin probe approach will considerably improve the structural-investigation potential of this technique since porphyrins are widespread pigments, constituting the molecular core of chlorophylls, bacteriochlorophylls and heme groups. The application to a biological system, the Peridinin - Chlorophyll a – Protein antenna complex, has also been tested with very good and promising results. For all these systems, Electron Paramagnetic Resonance spectroscopy proved to be a valuable and effective tool for investigating the systems hereafter reported, giving new insight into energy conversion and transfer mechanisms in biological systems from a structural point of view, highlighting how the fine tuning of the surrounding of the paramagnetic center at atomic level is crucial for the future design of biomimetic compounds able to efficiently convert solar energy into practical fuels. In addition the triplet state has been demonstrated to be a valuable spin probe for distance and orientation measurement in both biological and biomimetic systems, opening the possibility to exploit the triplet state as a probe for gaining structural data at molecular level. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} {{synthesis}} {{of a series of}} homologous oligoviologens in which different numbers of 4, 4 ′-bipyridinium (BIPY^(2 +) subunits are linked by p-xylylene bridges, as a prelude to investigating how their radical cationic forms self-assemble both in solution and in the solid state. The strong radical–radical interactions between the radical cationic forms of the BIPY^(2 +) units—namely, BIPY^(•+) —in these oligoviologens induce intra- or intermolecular folding of these homologues. UV/Vis/NIR spectroscopic studies and DFT quantum mechanics indicate that the folding of the shorter oligoviologens is dominated by intermolecular radical–radical interactions. In addition to intermolecular interactions, strong intramolecular radical–radical interactions, which give rise to an NIR absorption band at 900 nm, tend to {{play a crucial role in}} governing the folding of the longer oligoviologens. The solid-state superstructure of the oligoviologen with three BIPY^(2 +) units reveals that two intertwining chains fold together to form a dimer, stabilized by intermolecular radical–radical interactions. These dimers continue to stack in an infinite column through intermolecular radical–radical interactions between them.

Morphol. 117, 271 – 294], allows it to adhere to nearly all surface topographies. The mechanistic basis for gecko adhesion has been intensely investigated, but the lowest hierarchical level, that of the spatula, has become experimentally accessible only recently. This report details measurements of the adhesion force exerted by a single gecko spatula for various atmospheric conditions and surface chemistries. Through judicious choice and modification of substrates, the short- and long-range adhesive forces are separated. In contrast to previous work [Autumn, K., Sitti, M., Liang, Y. C. A., Peattie, A.

40|$|The {{controlled}} {{radical polymerization}} of monomeric units containing chiral ionic liquids (CILs) allows {{the synthesis of}} intrinsically chiral polymers through a bottom-up design. These polymeric chiral ionic liquids (PCILs) show a well-defined three dimensional structure organized {{as the result of}} a complex noncovalent network of hydrogen-bonding contacts driven by the C 2 hydrogen atoms of the imidazolium aromatic rings and the OH moieties present in the side functionalities of the main polymeric chain. The exchange of the chloride counter ion by the L-prolinate anion leads to new types of polymeric catalysts, which behave as efficient <b>artificial</b> aldolase <b>biomimetic</b> <b>systems,</b> being highly active and selective for the aldol reaction in water. These new polymeric catalysts are significantly more active than the corresponding monomeric counterpart when the reaction is performed either in water or in the presence of water. The increase in catalytic efficiency can be related to their 3 D structure, displaying helical chirality in the polymeric chain as a function of their preparation methodology. Under suitable experimental conditions, these polymers are able to catalyse the consecutive aldol-dehydration process, behaving as synthetic mimics of the aldolase-dehydrogenase enzymatic system.

40|$|An ionic polymer-metal {{composite}} (IPMC) actuator {{composed of}} a thin perfluorinated ionomer membrane with electrodes plated on both surfaces undergoes a large bending motion when a low electric field is applied across its thickness. Such actuators are soft, lightweight, and able to operate in solutions and thus show promise with regard {{to a wide range}} of applications, including MEMS sensors, <b>artificial</b> muscles, <b>biomimetic</b> <b>systems,</b> and medical devices. However, the variations induced by changing the type of anion on the device deformation properties are not well understood; therefore, the present study investigated the effects of different anions on the ion exchange process and the deformation behavior of IPMC actuators with palladium electrodes. Ion exchange was carried out in solutions incorporating various anions and the actuator tip displacement in deionized water was subsequently measured while applying a step voltage. In the step voltage response measurements, larger anions such as nitrate or sulfate led to a more pronounced tip displacement compared to that obtained with smaller anions such as hydroxide or chloride. In AC impedance measurements, larger anions generated greater ion conductivity and a larger double-layer capacitance at the cathode. Based on these mechanical and electrochemical measurements, it is concluded that the presence of larger anions in the ion exchange solution induces a greater degree of double-layer capacitance at the cathode and results in enhanced tip deformation of the IPMC actuators...|$|R

The entrapment of enzymes in <b>artificial</b> nanoreactors as <b>biomimetic</b> <b>systems</b> {{can be expected to}} contribute {{to the understanding of the}} activity and the interactions of enzymes in confined spaces. The capsid of the Cowpea Chlorotic Mottle virus (CCMV) represents such an artificial nanoreactor that can be used to encapsulate multiple proteins in its interior. Employing a controlled encapsulation process we are able to load a precise number of proteins (Pseudozyma antarctica lipase B and EGFP) into the CCMV capsid and to study their activity. In the case of the enzyme, our results indicate that the apparent overall reaction rate increases upon encapsulation and is almost independent of the number of enzymes in the capsid. These observation are the result of the extremely high confinement molarity of the enzyme inside the capsid (Mconf = ∼ 1 mM) leading to very rapid formation of the enzyme–substrate complex. These results highlight the importance of small volumes for efficient multi-enzyme cascade catalysis...|$|R

In my thesis I use a multidisciplinary approach in which method development, as well as micro- and nanoscale manipulations and biophysical investigations where conducted on polymer-membrane systems, predominantly {{in the context of}} artificial cells. A cell sized model for membrane-polymer interactions was developed, consisting of a thermoresponsive polymer and giant phospholipid vesicles. The study involved the formation of a hydrogel compartment within a giant vesicle, and the investigation of interactions of the so formed compartment with the liposome membrane. Poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide) copolymerized with vinyl ferrocene was utilized to modulate the polymer contracting properties and enable the dynamic formation of a dense homogeneous compartment within a GUV. The polymer-membrane interactions were also investigated theoretically to describe the force necessary to a pull a nanotube from the membrane. The force was expressed as a function of concentration and chain lengths. The study was supported by an experimental determination of the minimal concentrations required for polymers of different chain length to interact with the membrane. Furthermore, a novel technical approach is described, which involves an IR fiber laser assembly as a spot heating source, introducing various improvements to microscopy experiments on single liposomes at elevated temperatures. A similar direct laser heating procedure was utilized to generate single giant vesicles from multilamellar membrane reservoirs, allowing for the first time for a broader variety of membrane compositions to be processed in comparison with conventional methods. Additionally, an optofluidic open-volume technique to measure temperature in situ on the size scale of the vesicle systems is described.

However, one limiting factor with the current technology is the duration of missions that can be undertaken and one contributing factor to this is the efficiency of the propulsion system, which is usually based on marine propellers. One potential method of increasing the efficiency of the propulsion system would to implement a biomimetic approach, i. e. to imitate a solution found in nature.
