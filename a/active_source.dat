5|$|Methane {{can exist}} in the Martian {{atmosphere}} for only a limited period before it is destroyed—estimates of its lifetime range from 0.6–4 years. Its presence despite this short lifetime indicates that an <b>active</b> <b>source</b> of the gas must be present.

40|$|Lossy {{compression}} of <b>active</b> <b>sources</b> Abstract — In computer vision, an <b>active</b> vision <b>source</b> is a sensor that explores its environment in an active way, deciding to investigate {{parts of the}} environment in greater depth based on what it currently sees. We study the problem of determining the rate required to compress the output of an <b>active</b> vision <b>source</b> to within a desired fidelity. In {{order to make the}} problem analytically tractable, we assume that the environment is memoryless and gain insights into the distinction between {{compression of}} passive and <b>active</b> <b>sources.</b> We show that modelling of the sources is crucial by considering two extreme cases: adversarially <b>active</b> <b>sources</b> and helpful <b>active</b> <b>sources.</b> The theory of arbitrarily varying sources is useful for these purposes and we expand on it by allowing the party controlling the variation in the source to have partial or noisy observations of the environment. We give several examples showing that there is a large difference in the rate required to compress <b>active</b> <b>sources</b> that are adversarially modelled and <b>active</b> <b>sources</b> that are jointly optimized with the coding system. The results suggest that when <b>active</b> <b>sources</b> are part of a networked system where rate comes at a premium, large savings can be reaped by jointly optimizing the coding system with the computer vision system.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{approach}} to detecting multiple, simultaneous talkers in multi-party meetings using localisation of <b>active</b> speech <b>sources</b> recorded with an ad-hoc microphone array. Cues indicating the relative distance between sources and microphones are derived from speech signals and room impulse responses recorded by each of the microphones distributed at unknown locations within a room. Multiple <b>active</b> <b>sources</b> are localised by analysing a surface formed from these cues and derived at different locations within the room. The number of localised <b>active</b> <b>sources</b> per each frame or utterance is then counted to estimate when multiple <b>sources</b> are <b>active.</b> The proposed approach does not require prior information about the number and locations of sources or microphones. Synchronisation between microphones is also not required. A meeting scenario with competing speakers is simulated and results show that simultaneously <b>active</b> <b>sources</b> can be detected with an average accuracy of 75 % {{and the number of}} <b>active</b> <b>sources</b> counted accurately 65 % of the time...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} active cloaking of {{a square}} array of evenly spaced pins in a Kirchhoff {{plate in the}} presence of flexural waves. <b>Active</b> <b>sources</b> are distributed exterior to the cluster and are represented by the non-singular Green's function for the biharmonic operator. The complex amplitudes of the <b>active</b> <b>sources,</b> which cancel out selected multipole orders of the scattered field, are found by solving an algebraic system of equations. For frequencies in the zero-frequency stop band, we find that a small number of <b>active</b> <b>sources</b> located on a grid is sufficient for cloaking. For higher frequencies, we achieve efficient cloaking with the <b>active</b> <b>sources</b> positioned on a circle surrounding the cluster. We demonstrate the cloaking efficiency with several numerical illustrations, considering key frequencies from band diagrams and dispersion surfaces for a Kirchhoff plate pinned in a doubly periodic fashion.

25|$|Caesium {{chloride}} {{composed of}} radioisotopes such as 137CsCl and 131CsCl, {{is used in}} nuclear medicine, including treatment of cancer (brachytherapy) and diagnosis of myocardial infarction. In the production of radioactive sources, it is normal to choose a chemical form of the radioisotope which would not be readily dispersed in the environment {{in the event of}} an accident. For instance, radiothermal generators (RTGs) often use strontium titanate, which is insoluble in water. For teletherapy sources, however, the radioactive density (Ci in a given volume) needs to be very high, which is not possible with known insoluble caesium compounds. A thimble-shaped container of radioactive caesium chloride provides the <b>active</b> <b>source.</b>|$|E

25|$|Impact {{velocities}} in {{the outer}} Solar System are typically ≈1km/s (compared with the escape velocity at the surface of Chariklo of ≈0.1km/s), and were even lower before the Kuiper belt was dynamically excited, supporting {{the possibility that the}} rings formed in the Kuiper belt before Chariklo was transferred to its current orbit less than 10 Myr ago. Impact velocities in the asteroid belt are much higher (≈5km/s), which could explain the absence of such ring features in minor bodies within the asteroid belt. Collisions between ring particles would cause the ring to widen substantially, and Poynting–Robertson drag would cause the ring particles to fall onto the central body within a few million years, requiring either an <b>active</b> <b>source</b> of ring particles or dynamical confinement by small (kilometre-sized) embedded or shepherd moons yet to be discovered. Such moons would be very challenging to detect via direct imaging from Earth due to the small radial separation of the ring system and Chariklo.|$|E

25|$|Possible trace {{amounts of}} methane in the {{atmosphere}} of Mars were first discovered in 2003 with earth based telescopes and fully verified in 2004 by the ESA Mars Express spacecraft in orbit around Mars. As methane is an unstable gas, its presence indicates {{that there must be}} an <b>active</b> <b>source</b> on the planet in order to keep such levels {{in the atmosphere}}. It is estimated that Mars must produce 270 ton/year of methane, but asteroid impacts account for only 0.8% of the total methane production. Although geologic sources of methane such as serpentinization are possible, the lack of current volcanism, hydrothermal activity or hotspots are not favorable for geologic methane. It has been suggested that the methane was produced by chemical reactions in meteorites, driven by the intense heat during entry through the atmosphere. Although research published in December 2009 ruled out this possibility, research published in 2012 suggest that a source may be organic compounds on meteorites that are converted to methane by ultraviolet radiation.|$|E
25|$|Medical grade linacs {{accelerate}} electrons using a tuned-cavity waveguide, {{in which}} the RF power creates a standing wave. Some linacs have short, vertically mounted waveguides, while higher energy machines {{tend to have a}} horizontal, longer waveguide and a bending magnet to turn the beam vertically towards the patient. Medical linacs use monoenergetic electron beams between 4 and 25MeV, giving an X-ray output with a spectrum of energies up to and including the electron energy when the electrons are directed at a high-density (such as tungsten) target. The electrons or X-rays can be used to treat both benign and malignant disease. The LINAC produces a reliable, flexible and accurate radiation beam. The versatility of LINAC is a potential advantage over cobalt therapy as a treatment tool. In addition, the device can simply be powered off when not in use; there is no source requiring heavy shielding – although the treatment room itself requires considerable shielding of the walls, doors, ceiling etc. to prevent escape of scattered radiation. Prolonged use of high powered (>18MeV) machines can induce a significant amount of radiation within the metal parts of the head of the machine after power to the machine has been removed (i.e. they become an <b>active</b> <b>source</b> and the necessary precautions must be observed).|$|E
60|$|That any evil {{directly}} {{follows from}} the closest interbreeding has been denied by many persons; but rarely by any practical breeder; and never, as far as I know, by one who has largely bred animals which propagate their kind quickly. Many physiologists attribute the evil exclusively to the combination and consequent increase of morbid tendencies common to both parents; {{and that this is}} an <b>active</b> <b>source</b> of mischief there can be no doubt. It is unfortunately too notorious that men and various domestic animals endowed with a wretched constitution, and with a strong hereditary disposition to disease, if not actually ill, are fully capable of procreating their kind. Close interbreeding, on the other hand, often induces sterility; and this indicates something quite distinct from the augmentation of morbid tendencies common to both parents. The evidence immediately to be given convinces me that it is a great law of nature, that all organic beings profit from an occasional cross with individuals not closely related to them in blood; and that, on the other hand, long-continued close interbreeding is injurious.|$|E

Another circumstance is the increase of intercourse between different parts of the world. As commerce extends, and the ignorant attempts to restrain it by tariffs become obsolete, commodities tend more and more to be produced in the places in which their production can be carried on at the least expense of labor and capital to mankind. (3.) Much will also depend on the increasing migration of labor and capital to unoccupied parts of the earth, of which the soil, climate, and situation are found, by the ample means of exploration now possessed, to promise not only a large return to industry, but great facilities of producing commodities suited to the markets of old countries.

60|$|The {{passion of}} revenge is {{originally}} {{nothing more than}} an habitual perception of the ideas of the sufferings of the person who inflicts an injury, as connected, as they are in a savage state, or in such portions of society as are yet undisciplined to civilization, with security that that injury will not be repeated in future. This feeling, engrafted upon superstition and confirmed by habit, at last loses sight of the only object for which it may be supposed to have been implanted, and becomes a passion and a duty to be pursued and fulfilled, even to the destruction of those ends to which it originally tended. The other passions, both good and evil. Avarice, Remorse, Love, Patriotism, present a similar appearance; and to this principle of the mind over-shooting the mark at which it aims, we owe all that is eminently base or excellent in human nature; in providing for the nutriment or the extinction of which, consists the true art of the legislator.
