40|$|In this note, {{we address}} the problem of {{determining}} which conjectural variations general equilibria are consistent in strategic multilateral exchange. We therefore consider expectations in a simple conjectural general equilibrium model of a pure exchange economy under strategic interactions. Three results are obtained. Firstly, the competitive equilibrium is <b>a</b> locally <b>consistent</b> conjectural general equilibrium. Secondly, the symmetric Cournot oligopoly equilibrium is not <b>a</b> locally <b>consistent</b> conjectural general equilibrium. Thirdly, the symmetric collusive equilibrium is <b>a</b> locally <b>consistent</b> conjectural general equilibrium. ...|$|R
40|$|Robust estimators for multivariate {{location}} and dispersion should be <b>ãn</b> <b>consistent</b> and highly outlier resistant, but estimators {{that have been}} shown to have these properties are impractical to compute. The RMVN estimator is an easily computed outlier resistant robust <b>ãn</b> <b>consistent</b> estimator of multivariate {{location and}} dispersion, and the estimator is obtained by scaling the classical estimator applied to the gRMVN subseth that contains {{at least half of the}} cases. Several robust estimators will be presented, discussed and compared in detail. The applications for the RMVN estimator are numerous, and a simple method for performing robust principal component analysis (PCA), canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and factor analysis is to apply the classical method to the gRMVN subset. h Two approaches for robust PCA and CCA will be introduced and compared by simulation studies...|$|R

However, Breyer is also recognized to be deferential to the interests of law enforcement and to legislative judgments in the Supreme Court's First Amendment rulings. Breyer has also demonstrated <b>a</b> <b>consistent</b> pattern of deference to Congress, voting to overturn congressional legislation at a lower rate than any other Supreme Court justice since 1994.|$|E
