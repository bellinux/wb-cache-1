5000|$|CRL-40,941 (also {{known as}} fladrafinil [...] and fluorafinil) is a wakefulness-promoting agent {{closely related to}} <b>adrafinil</b> and modafinil. It is the bis(p-fluoro) ring-substituted {{derivative}} of <b>adrafinil.</b> CRL-40,941 was found to produce antiaggressive effects in animals, which <b>adrafinil</b> does not produce.|$|E
5000|$|In a {{clinical}} trial with clomipramine and placebo as active comparators, <b>adrafinil</b> showed efficacy {{in the treatment of}} depression. In contrast to clomipramine however, <b>adrafinil</b> was well-tolerated, and showed greater improvement in psychomotor retardation in comparison. As such, [...] "further investigations of the antidepressive effects of <b>adrafinil</b> are warranted." ...|$|E
50|$|In 1976, {{two years}} after the {{discovery}} of <b>adrafinil,</b> modafinil, its active metabolite, was discovered. Modafinil appeared to be more potent than <b>adrafinil</b> in animal studies, and was selected for further clinical development, with both <b>adrafinil</b> and modafinil eventually reaching the market. Modafinil was first approved in France in 1994, and then in the United States in 1998. Lafon was acquired by Cephalon in 2001. As of September 2011, Cephalon has discontinued Olmifon, its <b>adrafinil</b> product, while modafinil continues to be marketed.|$|E
50|$|In 2005 a Medical Classification Committee in New Zealand {{recommended}} to MEDSAFE NZ that <b>adrafinil</b> {{be classified as}} a prescription medicine due to risks of it {{being used as a}} party drug. At that time <b>adrafinil</b> was not scheduled in New Zealand.|$|E
50|$|The prototypical eugeroic is modafinil; {{other drugs}} in the class include <b>adrafinil</b> and armodafinil. Modafinil and armodafinil {{have been found to}} act as selective, weak, {{atypical}} dopamine reuptake inhibitors. <b>Adrafinil</b> is a prodrug of modafinil and therefore has the same mechanism of action as modafinil.|$|E
5000|$|... {{modafinil}} (stimulant), its stereoisomer armodafinil, and {{a similar}} drug <b>adrafinil</b> ...|$|E
5000|$|Because α1-adrenergic {{receptor}} antagonists {{were found}} to block effects of <b>adrafinil</b> and modafinil in animals, [...] "most investigators assumed that <b>adrafinil</b> and modafinil both serve as α1-adrenergic receptor agonists." [...] However, <b>adrafinil</b> and modafinil have not been found to bind to the α1-adrenergic receptor and they lack peripheral sympathomimetic side effects associated with activation of this receptor; hence, the {{evidence in support of}} this hypothesis is weak, and other mechanisms are probable. Modafinil was subsequently screened at a variety of targets in 2009 and was found to act as a weak, atypical blocker of the dopamine transporter (and hence as a dopamine reuptake inhibitor), and this action may explain some or all of its pharmacological effects. Relative to <b>adrafinil,</b> modafinil possesses greater specificity in its action, lacking or having a reduced incidence of many of the common side effects of the former (including stomach pain, skin irritation, anxiety, and elevated liver enzymes with prolonged use).|$|E
50|$|There is a {{case report}} of two {{patients}} that <b>adrafinil</b> may increase interest in sex.|$|E
50|$|<b>Adrafinil</b> was marketed in France {{under the}} trade name Olmifon until September 2011 {{when it was}} voluntarily discontinued.|$|E
50|$|<b>Adrafinil</b> was {{discovered}} in 1974 by two chemists working for the French pharmaceutical company Laboratoires Lafon who were screening compounds in search of analgesics. Pharmacological studies of <b>adrafinil</b> instead revealed psychostimulant-like effects such as hyperactivity and wakefulness in animals. The substance was first tested in humans, specifically {{for the treatment of}} narcolepsy, in 1977-1978. Introduced by Lafon (now Cephalon), it reached the market in France in 1984, and for the treatment of narcolepsy in 1985.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to modafinil, <b>adrafinil</b> also produces modafinil acid (CRL-40467) and modafinil sulfone (CRL-41056) as metabolites, which form from metabolic modification of modafinil.|$|E
50|$|<b>Adrafinil</b> and its active {{metabolite}} modafinil {{were added}} to the list of substances prohibited for athletic competition according to World Anti-Doping Agency in 2004.|$|E
50|$|Modafinil was {{originally}} developed in France by neurophysiologist and emeritus experimental medicine professor Michel Jouvet and Lafon Laboratories. Modafinil originated {{with the late}} 1970s invention {{of a series of}} benzhydryl sulfinyl compounds, including <b>adrafinil,</b> which was first offered as an experimental treatment for narcolepsy in France in 1986. Modafinil is the primary metabolite of <b>adrafinil,</b> lacking the polar -OH group on its terminal amide, and has similar activity to the parent drug but is much more widely used. It has been prescribed in France since 1994 under the name Modiodal, and in the US since 1998 as Provigil.|$|E
50|$|<b>Adrafinil</b> is a prodrug; it is {{primarily}} metabolized in vivo to modafinil, resulting in very similar pharmacological effects. Unlike modafinil, however, it takes time for the metabolite to accumulate to active levels in the bloodstream. Effects usually are apparent within 45-60 minutes when taken orally on an empty stomach.|$|E
50|$|The wakefulness-promoting agent {{modafinil}} and its analogues (e.g., <b>adrafinil,</b> armodafinil) {{have been}} approved to treat narcolepsy and shift work sleep disorder. These act as weak (micromolar) DRIs, but this effect does not correlate with wakefulness-promoting effects, suggesting the effect is too weak to be of clinical significance. The conclusion is these drugs promote wakefulness via some other mechanism.|$|E
50|$|CRL-40,940 (also {{known as}} flmodafinil, bisfluoromodafinil and lauflumide) is a {{selective}} dopaminergic reuptake inhibitor, {{and is the}} bisfluoro analog of the wakefulness-promoting agent (or eugeroic) modafinil and has been sold online as a designer drug. Its inventors claim {{that it is more}} effective than modafinil and <b>adrafinil</b> in their indications with fewer side effects, and was patented in 2013. Phase I clinical trials have been underway since December 2015.|$|E
50|$|Modafinil acid (code name CRL-40467), {{also known}} as {{modafinil}}ic acid or modafinil carboxylate, is the major metabolite of modafinil, {{and one of the}} two major metabolites of modafinil - the other being modafinil sulfone. Modafinil acid is also a metabolite of the modafinil prodrug, <b>adrafinil,</b> and the (R)-(-)-enantiomer is a metabolite of armodafinil, the (R)-(-)-enantiomer of modafinil. Modafinil acid seems to be inactive, and similarly to modafinil sulfone, does not appear to contribute to the wakefulness-promoting/psychostimulant effects of modafinil.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Adrafinil</b> (INN) (brand name Olmifon) is a {{discontinued}} wakefulness-promoting agent (or eugeroic) {{that was}} formerly used in France to promote vigilance (alertness), attention, wakefulness, mood, and other parameters, {{particularly in the}} elderly. It was also used off-label by individuals who wished to avoid fatigue, such as night workers or others who needed to stay awake and alert {{for long periods of}} time. Additionally, [...] "adrafinil is known to a larger nonscientific audience, where it {{is considered to be a}} nootropic agent." ...|$|E
50|$|Modafinil sulfone (code name CRL-41056) is an achiral, {{oxidized}} metabolite of modafinil, a wakefulness-promoting agent. It {{is one of}} {{two major}} circulating metabolites of modafinil, the other being modafinil acid. Modafinil sulfone is also a metabolite of the modafinil prodrug, <b>adrafinil.</b> Modafinil sulfone is also a metabolite of armodafinil, the (R)-(-)-enantiomer of modafinil, as oxidation to the sulfone removes the chiral center at the sulfur atom. Modafinil sulfone has been described as inactive, and similarly to modafinil acid, does not appear to contribute to the wakefulness-promoting/psychostimulant effects of modafinil. However, like modafinil, modafinil sulfone was found to show anticonvulsant properties in animals, indicating that it does possess some biological activity.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} {{drugs have}} DRI action {{and have been}} or are used clinically specifically for this property: amineptine, dexmethylphenidate, difemetorex, fencamfamine, lefetamine, levophacetoperane, medifoxamine, mesocarb, methylphenidate, nomifensine, pipradrol, prolintane, and pyrovalerone. The following drugs are or have been used clinically and possess only weak DRI action, {{which may or may}} not be clinically-relevant: <b>adrafinil,</b> armodafinil, bupropion, mazindol, modafinil, nefazodone, sertraline, and sibutramine. The following drugs are or have been clinically used but only coincidentally have DRI properties: benzatropine, diphenylpyraline, etybenzatropine, ketamine, nefopam, pethidine (meperidine), and tripelennamine. The following are a selection of some particularly notably abused DRIs: cocaine, ketamine, MDPV, naphyrone, and phencyclidine (PCP). Amphetamines, including amphetamine, methamphetamine, MDMA, cathinone, methcathinone, mephedrone, and methylone, are all DRIs as well, but are distinct in that they also behave, and potentially more potently as dopamine releasing agents (DRAs) (it should be noted that due to Yerkes-Dodson's law, 'more potently stimulated' may not equal more optimally functionally stimulated). There are very distinct differences in the mode of action between dopamine releasers/substrates & dopamine re-uptake inhibitors; the former are functionally entropy-driven (i.e. relating to hydrophobicity) and the latter are enthalpy-driven (i.e. relating conformational change). Reuptake inhibitors such as cocaine induce hyperpolarization of cloned human DAT upon oocytes that are naturally found on neurons, whereas releasing agents induce de-polarization of the neuron membrane.|$|E
40|$|Objective: <b>Adrafinil</b> and {{modafinil}} {{have received}} wide publicity {{and have become}} controversial in the sporting world when several athletes were discovered allegedly using these drugs as doping agents. By acknowledging the facts, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) banned these drugs in sports since 2004. The present study explores the possibility of differentiating <b>adrafinil</b> and modafinil and their major metabolites under electron impact ionization in gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MSD) and electrospray ionization in liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometer (LC-MS/MS) by studying the fragmentation pattern of these drugs. Materials and Methods: <b>Adrafinil,</b> modafinil and their major metabolite, modafinilic acid were analyzed on EI-GC-MSD and ESI-LC-MS/MS using various individual parameters on both the instruments. The analytical technique and equipment used in the analysis were an Agilent 6890 N GC with 5973 mass selective detector for the GC-MSD analysis and an Agilent 1100 HPLC with API- 3200 Triple quadrupole mass spectrometer for the LC-MS/MS analysis. Validation of both methods was performed using six replicates at different concentrations. Result and Discussion: The results show that <b>adrafinil,</b> modafinil and their major metabolite modafinilic acid could be detected as a single artifact without differentiation under EI-GC-MSD analysis. However, all drugs could be detected and differentiated under ESI-LCMS/MS analysis without any artifaction. The GC-MSD analysis gives a single artifact for both the drugs without differentiation and thus {{can be used as}} a marker for screening purposes. Further, the Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM) method developed under LC-MS/MS is fit for the purpose for confirmation of suspicious samples in routine sports testing and in forensic and clinical analysis...|$|E
40|$|Behavioral stimulants have {{widespread}} potential {{application in}} the treatment of affective disorders, disorders of vigilance, and disorders of sleep.

40|$|Stimulants {{are banned}} in {{competition}} by the World Anti-Doping Agency, {{except for a}} small number of therapeutic agents subject to monitoring, including bupropion. We have examined the potency of bupropion in comparison with two agents banned in competition, <b>adrafinil</b> and modafinil, and with cocaine and desipramine as blockers of the noradrenaline re-uptake transporter in peripheral tissues of the rat. For studies in vivo, the pressor response to noradrenaline in the anaesthetized rat was studied. Cocaine, desipramine and bupropion at doses of 0. 1, 0. 3 and 1 mg/kg, respectively, significantly increased the pressor response to noradrenaline. Overall, cocaine and desipramine were approximately 2 - 5 times more potent than bupropion in vivo in the rat. <b>Adrafinil</b> and modafinil (both 3 mg/kg) did not significantly affect the pressor response. Bupropion was chosen for further study. In 1 Hz paced rat right ventricular strips, bupropion (30 μM) significantly increased the potency of noradrenaline at increasing the force of contraction. In rat vas deferens, bupropion and cocaine produced concentration-dependent increases in the contractile response to nerve stimulation, and cocaine was 11 times more potent than bupropion. Since bupropion is used clinically in doses of up to 300 mg, it is likely that bupropion has actions at the noradrenaline transporter, and thus cardiovascular stimulant actions, in clinical doses. This may explain findings of increased exercise performance with bupropion...|$|E
40|$|The current {{interest}} in hydroxamic and polyhydroxamic acids {{is related to}} the vari-ety of their biological activities, as well as to their role as iron chelators and microbial siderophores (13). Antibacterial, antifungal, antitumor and anti-inflammatory activities of hydroxamic acids are connected with their ability to inhibit various enzymes, viz., matrix metalloproteinases (4, 5), 5 -lipoxygenase (6, 7), urease (8) or ribonucleotid reduc-tase (9). Some ion exchange resins are based on hydroxamic acids (10), and a number of hydroxamic acids are currently accepted therapeutic agents (desferrioxamine B, hydro-xycarbamide, ibuproxam, oxametacin, bufexamac, <b>adrafinil)</b> (11). The promising thera-peutic potential of this class of compounds prompted us to screen antimicrobial activity of several hydroxamic acids previously synthesized by our group (12). In this paper, we report the results of the undertaken antimicrobial evaluation. EXPERIMENTA...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{prevalence}} of legal and illegal stimulants in relation to doping-control analysis. Stimulants are among the oldest classes of doping agents, having been used since ancient times. Despite {{the ease with which}} they can be detected and the availability of sensitive detection methods, stimulants are still popular among athletes. Indeed, they remain one of the top three most popular classes of prohibited substances. Because the list of legal and illegal stimulants is extensive only a selection is discussed in detail. The compounds selected are caffeine, ephedrines, amphetamine and related compounds, methylphenidate, cocaine, strychnine, modafinil, <b>adrafinil,</b> 4 -methyl- 2 -hexaneamine, and sibutramine. These compounds are mainly prevalent in sport or are of therapeutic importance. Because stimulants are the oldest doping class the first detection methods were for this group. Several early detection techniques including GC-NPD, GC-ECD, and TLC are highlighted. The more novel detection techniques GC-MS and LC-MS are also discussed in detail. In particular, the last technique has been shown to enable successful detection of stimulants difficult to detect by GC-MS or for stimulants previously undetectable. Because stimulants are also regularly detected in nutritional (food) supplements a section on this topic is also included...|$|E
