25|$|Maynard {{joined in}} the logging {{activity}} at New York-Alki (later Seattle), {{near the mouth of}} the Duwamish River on Puget Sound. Instead of selling his wood to shippers at $4 a cord, he leased a vessel from Captain Felker, using the wood itself as security, and sold the load in San Francisco at ten times the price. With that money, he bought the fixings for a general store and briefly set up in competition to the only other such store on Puget Sound, which was in Olympia and owned by Catherine's brother. Mike soon agreed to his sister marrying Maynard, apparently on condition that they move the store to Duwamps <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> that prior marriage.|$|E
