25|$|Short for Graphic User Interface, the GUI uses windows, icons, and menus {{to carry}} out {{commands}} such as opening files, deleting files, moving files, etc. and although many GUI Operating Systems are operated by using a mouse, the keyboard {{can also be used}} by using keyboard shortcuts or <b>arrow</b> <b>keys.</b> The GUI was co-invented at Xerox PARC by Alan Kay and Douglas Engelbart in 1981.|$|E
25|$|Numeric {{keyboards}} contain only numbers, mathematical symbols for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, a decimal point, {{and several}} function keys. They {{are often used}} to facilitate data entry with smaller keyboards {{that do not have}} a numeric keypad, commonly those of laptop computers. These keys are collectively known as a numeric pad, numeric keys, or a numeric keypad, and it can consist of the following types of keys: Arithmetic operators, numbers, <b>arrow</b> <b>keys,</b> Navigation keys, Num Lock and Enter key.|$|E
50|$|On April 18, it was announced, that Mr. <b>Arrow</b> <b>Key</b> will be Lena's seventh {{single and}} third single from her album via {{her own and}} {{official}} website. In early May, Mr. <b>Arrow</b> <b>Key,</b> as single, was put on Amazon.|$|R
30|$|Therefore, it was {{considered}} necessary to include a mouse mode (see Figure 3 c). The challenge {{was to find a}} solution that allowed precise pointer control, while permitting fast movement across the screen at the same time. To do this, OnScreenDualScribe continually moves the pointer in one direction after the corresponding <b>arrow</b> <b>key</b> is pressed. The initial speed is low (ten pixels per second) and is reset when a different <b>arrow</b> <b>key</b> is pressed. However, pressing the same <b>arrow</b> <b>key</b> again accelerates the movement. When the pointer reaches the desired destination, the user generates a click or stops the movement with the right-hand keys.|$|R

25|$|Navigation keys or cursor keys {{include a}} variety of keys which move the cursor to {{different}} positions on the screen. <b>Arrow</b> <b>keys</b> are programmed to move the cursor in a specified direction; page scroll keys, such as the Page Up and Page Down keys, scroll the page up and down. The Home key is used to return the cursor {{to the beginning of}} the line where the cursor is located; the End key puts the cursor at the end of the line. The Tab key advances the cursor to the next tab stop.|$|E
500|$|Four {{constants}} {{are printed}} on the calculator case for easy reference. [...] For converting to and from base 10 logarithms and natural logarithms the natural logarithm of 10 (2.30259) and e (2.71828) are {{printed on the}} case. Pi (3.14159) and 57.2958 (180 / Pi) {{are also on the}} case for trigonometry calculations. [...] There was not enough internal memory to store these constants internally. [...] Angles are computed using radians; degree values must be converted to radians by dividing by 57.2958. [...] As an example, to calculate 25 sin (600*0.05°) one would enter C 6 E 2 + 0 0 5 × 5 7 2 9 5 8 E 1 ÷ ▲ + 2 5 E 1 × to get a result of 1.2500 01 (representing 12.5 which is equal to 25 sin(30°) [...] ). [...] Sine is selected with the combination of the [...] "▲" [...] key followed by the [...] "+" [...] key. [...] The [...] "▼" [...] (down) and [...] "▲" [...] (up) <b>arrow</b> <b>keys</b> are function select keys. [...] The four operation keys ("-, +, ÷ and ×") all have two other function activated by using one of the <b>arrow</b> <b>keys.</b> [...] The function available are Sine, Arcsine, Cosine, Arccosine, Tangent, Arctangent, Logarithm and Antilogarithm.|$|E
500|$|After the Sequel is a 2D {{platformer}} in {{the style}} of the Sonic games for the Sega Genesis. As such, it lets the player control either the blue hedgehog Sonic or his orange fox friend Tails. Both characters can move left and right with the <b>arrow</b> <b>keys</b> and jump with the [...] "Z" [...] key; Tails can also fly to reach areas Sonic cannot. The game takes place in seven levels, known as zones, each divided into three acts followed by a boss fight with Doctor Eggman. These zones are designed for fast-paced gameplay, featuring typical Sonic obstacles such as bottomless pits and vertical loops. The zones are based on various themes, including haunted houses, cities, magma caverns, winter theme parks, and sugar processing plants.|$|E

500|$|Vollmer {{started as}} thatgamecompany's [...] "feel engineer" [...] in August 2012, but left in April 2013 to [...] "go indie" [...] {{and work on}} his own projects. On his blog, {{he said he thought}} the studio's current project would be groundbreaking, though he was unhappy working there. Vollmer tried to write a short story in an attempt to take a break from games. Before long, he began to play with his {{computer}} keyboard. Vollmer challenged himself to make a game that only used the <b>arrow</b> <b>keys,</b> and prototyped what would become Threes in ten hours overnight. He proceeded to iterate on the idea with Wohlwend over the game's 14-month development. In Threes, the player slides numbered tiles on a four-by-four grid to combine addends and multiples of three. Vollmer cited Drop7 as an inspiration for the game, having played it for two years beforehand.|$|E
500|$|A narrator first asks players, [...] "are you a man, or a woman?" [...] Players who select [...] "man" [...] are instead {{told they}} are a [...] "girl". Similarly, players who select [...] "woman" [...] are called a [...] "boy". Navigation is by <b>arrow</b> <b>keys,</b> which also control the ability to jump and duck. The narrator instructs players intermittently, {{sometimes}} to achieve goals but often to suggest actions that will kill the player character (such as falling into a pit full of spikes). Players are sometimes, but not always, congratulated when following these instructions, while disobeying the narrator results in a barrage of insults. Both the player character and environment are in stark black and white, with a colourful motif appearing if the character disobeys the narrator's instructions, or the visuals becoming more detailed but still in monochrome if the character decides to be compliant.|$|E
500|$|The player's {{left and}} right <b>arrow</b> <b>keys</b> and space bar control a bumper that moves around a purple circle. Kanye West, {{represented}} by his head, attempts to enter the circle while repeatedly rapping [...] "Don't let me into my zone", and the player must hit him with the bumper—this causes him to disappear {{in a burst of}} dollar signs, and the player is rewarded with cash, added to a total displayed on the webpage. A silhouette of Kanye's head shows where he will next spawn, and an arrow inside it indicates what direction he will travel in. Play continues this way, with Kanye getting faster and the zone getting bigger, until the player fails to prevent Kanye from entering the zone, when they are presented with a message declaring they have lost; an image of rapper Jay-Z's head joins that of West, and the lyric [...] "I'm definitely in my zone" [...] is heard. If the player's cash score is high enough, it is added to a leaderboard on the right of the page.|$|E

2500|$|MUD clients often contain {{functions}} {{which make}} certain tasks within a MUD easier to carry out, for example commands buttons {{which you can}} click {{in order to move}} in a particular direction or to pick up an item. [...] There are also tools available which add hotkey-activated macros to telnet and MUD clients giving the player the ability to move around the MUD using the <b>arrow</b> <b>keys</b> on their keyboard for example.|$|E
30|$|Half of {{the trials}} were {{interrupted}} {{by a series of}} ten true or false math equations (see Fig. 1). Each CT scan was assigned a specific interruption time in the range of 30 – 60 s following search onset. The math equations were randomly generated with numbers between 1 and 10 using the format A * B – C[*]=[*]D. Each set of problems was solved correctly 50 % of the time. Participants responded using the right <b>arrow</b> <b>key</b> for correctly solved equations and the left <b>arrow</b> <b>key</b> for incorrectly solved equations. The screen flashed red for 100 ms following an incorrect response.|$|R

2500|$|Some minor {{compatibility}} issues also plagued ported Spectrum games. For example, the Toshiba HX-10 {{machine was}} unable to read certain key combinations at the same time, preventing the Spectrum [...] "standard" [...] of [...] "Q, A, O, P steering", whereas machines by other manufacturers worked fine. Later (ported) games tended to use the MSX-1 joystick port or used MSX's official <b>arrow</b> <b>keys</b> and space bar, or offered the option to choose other keys with which to control the program, solving the problem.|$|E
2500|$|Modern {{keyboard}} models {{contain a}} set number of total keys {{according to their}} given standard, described as 104, 105 etc. and sold as [...] "standard" [...] keyboards. However, this number is not always followed, and individual keys or whole sections are commonly skipped {{for the sake of}} compactness or user preference. The most common choice is to not include the numpad, which can usually be fully replaced by the alphanumeric section. Laptops and wireless peripherals often lack duplicate keys and ones seldom used. Function- and <b>arrow</b> <b>keys</b> are nearly always present.|$|E
2500|$|The {{built-in}} display was a one-bit black-and-white, [...] CRT with a fixed {{resolution of}} 512×342 pixels, establishing the desktop publishing standard of 72 PPI. Expansion and networking were achieved using two non-standard RS-422 DE-9 serial ports named [...] "printer" [...] and [...] "modem"; {{they did not}} support hardware handshaking. An external floppy disk drive could be added using a proprietary connector (19-pin D-sub). The keyboard and mouse used simple proprietary protocols, allowing some third-party upgrades. The original keyboard had no <b>arrow</b> <b>keys,</b> numeric keypad or function keys. This was an intentional decision by Apple, as these keys were common on older platforms and {{it was thought that}} the addition of these keys would encourage software developers to simply port their existing applications to the Mac, rather than design new ones around the GUI paradigm. Later, Apple would make a numeric keypad available for the Macintosh 128K. The keyboard sold with the newer Macintosh Plus model would include the numeric keypad and <b>arrow</b> <b>keys,</b> but still no function keys. As with the Apple Lisa before it, the mouse had a single button. Standard headphones could also be connected to a monaural jack. Apple also offered their 300 and 1200bit/s modems originally released for the Apple II line. Initially, the only printer available was the Apple ImageWriter, a dot matrix printer which was designed to produce 144dpi WYSIWYG output from the Mac's 72dpi screen. Eventually, the LaserWriter and other printers were capable of being connected using AppleTalk, Apple's built-in networking system.|$|E

2500|$|Qwpr is a layout which changes only 11 basic {{keys from}} their QWERTY positions, with only 2 of them {{changing}} fingers. Minimak has versions which changes four, six, eight, or twelve keys, all have only 3 keys change finger. These intend to offer {{much of the}} reduced finger movement of Dvorak without the steep learning curve and with an increased ability to remain proficient with a QWERTY keyboard. The Qwpr layout is also designed for programmers and multilingual users, as it uses Caps Lock as a [...] "punctuation shift", offering quicker access to ASCII symbols and <b>arrow</b> <b>keys,</b> {{as well as to}} 15 dead keys for typing hundreds of different glyphs such as accented characters, mathematical symbols, or emoji.|$|E
2500|$|Gameplay is a {{simplified}} {{version of the}} playing-style used in Myst. [...] The game consists {{of a series of}} pre-rendered, interactive visuals of Pyst island locations. With Bergman's [...] "seal of disapproval", the familiar locations have been vandalised under the pretense that millions of virtual players have been trapped on the island having [...] "giv up on trying to finish the damn thing", and as a result have trashed the space, while a shady entrepreneur has built a [...] "Dorian Grey money making scheme". Unlike Myst however, there are no real puzzles to solve. The player simply explores a setting, and then moves to adjoining locations at will. The game does not feature a point-and-click cursor interface. Instead, the players are shown an image on a postcard with four <b>arrow</b> <b>keys</b> on the edge where players click an arrow key to change the image on the postcard.|$|E
50|$|Before the {{computer}} mouse was widespread, <b>arrow</b> <b>keys</b> {{were the primary}} way of moving a cursor on screen. Mouse keys is a feature that allows controlling a mouse cursor with <b>arrow</b> <b>keys</b> instead. A feature echoed in the Amiga whereby holding the Amiga key would allow a person to move the pointer with the <b>arrow</b> <b>keys</b> in the Workbench (operating system), but most games require a mouse or joystick. The use of <b>arrow</b> <b>keys</b> in games has come back into fashion from the late 1980s and early 1990s when joysticks were a must, and were usually used in preference to <b>arrow</b> <b>keys</b> with some games not supporting any keys. It can be used instead of WASD keys, to play games using those keys.|$|E
50|$|Autocomplete, or word completion, is {{a feature}} {{in which an}} {{application}} predicts the rest of a word a user is typing. In graphical user interfaces, users can typically press the tab key to accept a suggestion or the down <b>arrow</b> <b>key</b> to accept one of several.|$|R
50|$|While {{using the}} Viewer, the picture can be {{advanced}} to the next or the previous by holding the CTRL key and press an <b>arrow</b> <b>key.</b> The menu can also easily {{be removed from the}} view and the view can display its pictures full screen. Slideshow options are also available.|$|R
50|$|Mr. <b>Arrow</b> <b>Key</b> was {{recorded}} in Sweden, Gröhndal Årstaberg studio. It is 3 minutes and 33 seconds long and was first published on 12 October 2012 on Lena's third album Stardust, as the second track on the track list. Technically, the song genre is described as pop song with folk and swing influences.|$|R
