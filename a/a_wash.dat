5|$|Positioned atop a hill {{dominating}} Cubzac-les-Ponts and Saint-André-de-Cubzac, the Terrefort-Quancard castle is a wine {{property and}} family house. The main {{building is a}} limestone rectangular body of living area, covered with slate for the roof. The surrounding grape wines, {{most of which are}} Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, span approximately 70hectares of land. Various vestiges remain, including <b>a</b> <b>wash</b> for linen and horses, and a wind-will for flour.|$|E
5|$|The restorers {{took for}} granted {{that all of the}} layers of grease and soot on the ceiling were the result of candle smoke. Contrary to this view, James Beck and {{numerous}} artists have suggested that Michelangelo used carbon black in <b>a</b> <b>wash</b> of glue to lay on shadows and crisp dark definition, a secco. If this is the case, then the greater part was removed in the restoration.|$|E
5|$|Michelangelo painted {{onto the}} damp plaster using <b>a</b> <b>wash</b> {{technique}} to apply broad areas of colour, {{then as the}} surface became drier, he revisited these areas with a more linear approach, adding shade and detail {{with a variety of}} brushes. For some textured surfaces, such as facial hair and woodgrain, he used a broad brush with bristles as sparse as a comb. He employed all the finest workshop methods and best innovations, combining them with a diversity of brushwork and breadth of skill far exceeding that of the meticulous Ghirlandaio.|$|E

5|$|The late 19th century carvings of Roman Emperors and Governors of Roman Britain on {{the terrace}} {{overlooking}} the Great Bath are particularly susceptible {{to the effect of}} acid rain and are being protected with <b>a</b> <b>wash</b> of a sacrificial shelter coat every few years. Exhibits within the temple precincts are susceptible to warm air which had the effect of drawing corrosive salts out of the Roman stonework. To help reduce this, a new ventilation system was installed in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Extensive {{damage was}} {{reported}} throughout the state. About one-seventh {{of the cotton}} crop was destroyed by Octave. Much of the rich topsoil crop was washed downstream into large reservoirs. Furthermore, agriculture damage totaled about $97.5 million. Damage to homes totaled $17 million while damages to business exceeded $6 million in damage. Public property damage reached $55.7 million. A father, mother, and two children were swept off their truck in Ash Fork. Two navy officers where killed on September 30 near Ostman when their jet crashed. On October 1, a man drowned in the Santa Cruz river. Another person drowned in <b>a</b> <b>wash</b> near Tucson when his truck stalled. In addition, a taxi driver and a passenger died when tried to cross a flooded river.|$|E
5|$|The {{cars had}} an aluminium-alloy {{double-skinned}} construction, and were delivered unpainted to save time. A red adhesive strip {{ran through the}} length of the cars in the middle to match the operator's visual branding. The unpainted cars had a shiny appearance upon delivery, but as dirt and grime accumulated it became a recurring problem for the operator and attracted several public complaints. In response, MRT Corporation built <b>a</b> <b>wash</b> machine at Bishan Depot in an attempt to clean up the cars' exterior proper. After refurbishment, the problem was solved by covering the cars' exterior entirely with giant stickers, creating a livery that is similar to the newer C751B and C151A rolling stocks.|$|E

5|$|The mineral {{crocoite}} (lead chromate PbCrO4) {{was used}} as a yellow pigment shortly after its discovery. After a synthesis method became available starting from the more abundant chromite, chrome yellow was, together with cadmium yellow, one of the most used yellow pigments. The pigment does not photodegrade, but it tends to darken due to the formation of chromium(III) oxide. It has a strong color, and was used for school buses in the US and for Postal Service (for example Deutsche Post) in Europe. The use of chrome yellow declined due to environmental and safety concerns and was replaced by organic pigments or alternatives free from lead and chromium. Other pigments based on chromium are, for example, the bright red pigment chrome red, which is a basic lead chromate (PbCrO4·Pb(OH)2). A very important chromate pigment, which was used widely in metal primer formulations, was zinc chromate, now replaced by zinc phosphate. <b>A</b> <b>wash</b> primer was formulated to replace the dangerous practice of pretreating aluminium aircraft bodies with a phosphoric acid solution. This used zinc tetroxychromate dispersed in a solution of polyvinyl butyral. An 8% solution of phosphoric acid in solvent was added just before application. It was found that an easily oxidized alcohol was an essential ingredient. A thin layer of about 10–15µm was applied, which turned from yellow to dark green when it was cured. There is still a question as to the correct mechanism. Chrome green is a mixture of Prussian blue and chrome yellow, while the chrome oxide green is chromium(III) oxide.|$|E

25|$|Professional tools used by blacksmiths, carpenters, {{and farmers}} were carried by nearly all. Axes, crow bars, hammers, hatchets, hoes, mallets, mattocks, picks, planes, saws, scythes, and shovels {{were used to}} clear or make a road through brush or trees, cut down the banks to cross <b>a</b> <b>wash</b> or steep banked stream, build a raft or bridge, or repair the wagon.

25|$|The {{cells were}} {{extremely}} small, with three concrete walls with no windows, {{and a solid}} steel door with a five-inch square window facing the corridor. The cells contained only <b>a</b> <b>wash</b> basin/toilet combination (cold water only), and a radio selector (there were two channels), and a concrete pad covered with a sheet of plywood four inches off the floor on which the inmates slept. Inmates could not control {{the volume of the}} radio nor the temperature of the cell. The lights in the cell remained on 24 hours a day, but were dimmed to 25 watts at night.|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} {{entrance is}} through the tower archway {{by way of a}} large, semi-circular arch that is decorated by rubbed brick and am impost three bricks high {{at the lower end of}} the arch. The arch itself consists of voussoirs with plastered over, white bricks forming the interior of the arch. Above the arch is a primitive, triangular tympanum the lower line of which extends beyond the raked borders. It is embellished by a fascia on the outer course with a fillet and ovolo on the inner course. It was alternately decorated with white cement, a marble tablet, and now <b>a</b> <b>wash</b> of mortar.|$|E

Silver anodized-metal rank insignia is worn on shirt/blouse collars and cap. The service uniform also includes a black relaxed-fit Eisenhower-style jacket with a knit stand-up collar and epaulets, on which petty officers wear large, silver anodized-metal rate insignia. Those entitled to wear gold chevrons continue to wear gold chevrons on the large metal rate insignia on the jacket.|$|E
500|$|Each of {{the upper}} floors of the tower block has a kitchen, a laundry and wash rooms as well as ten [...] "study-bedrooms" [...] and two larger rooms linked by a lobby. Each study room has <b>a</b> <b>wash</b> basin and fitted wardrobe. Originally the {{interior}} walls of the extension were not plastered since a plastic-faced plywood framework {{had been used to}} give a higher quality finish to the concrete, rendering plastering unnecessary. As a result, internal decoration was applied directly to the concrete walls.|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{the final}} chorus section, [...] "Untitled (How Does It Feel)" [...] {{features}} a song-spanning dynamic after the bridge and guitar break that is accompanied by minor Rhodes piano and guitar chords, while the multi-tracked vocals are implemented as background whispers. Arrangements for the song are stripped back for an emphasis on vocals, leading to an enormous choral climax accompanied by overdriven electric guitar. On the song's final chorus section, critic Steve McPherson wrote [...] "after it hits a peak, it keeps rising, the chorus of voices fizzing into overdrive and the whole track gradually succumbing to <b>a</b> <b>wash</b> of reverb". The song is cut off {{in the middle of}} its culmination, ending with the line [...] "How does it fee-".|$|E

500|$|In some instances, {{the colour}} {{combinations}} look garish: {{this is particularly}} {{the case with the}} Prophet Daniel. A comparison of the [...] "restored" [...] and [...] "unrestored" [...] figure gives strong evidence that Michelangelo worked over this figure in <b>a</b> <b>wash</b> of carbon black, and that the technique was preplanned. The bright red used on the robes of Daniel and the Libyan Sibyl does not, on its own, create effective shadows. In these and many other cases it appears to have been intended as underpainting, to be seen only through a thin black wash and with the deepest shadows picked out in more intense black, as they still are on the Cumaean Sibyl. This use of bright, contrasting colours as underpainting is not a common feature of frescoes, but it is commonly employed in both oil painting and tempera. Like Daniel, the Libyan Sibyl's yellow garment once had much more subtlety in its folds and shadows than it has now.|$|E
500|$|July 2006: The {{remnants}} of Tropical Storm Emilia produced {{an influx of}} tropical moisture over Arizona, triggering a week-long period of disturbed weather in late July.

500|$|The album {{version of}} the track does not have drum accompaniment and portrays an ambient song. It does not have Homogenics {{characteristic}} electronic beats, focusing instead on [...] " [...] an intimacy between the growing dynamics of the instrumentation and Bjork's impressive vocal abilities." [...] It uses a long reverb, which results in <b>a</b> <b>wash</b> of sound that suggests a very large space suggestive of the [...] "heavenly" [...] environment envisaged by the singer for the track. According to Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine, the song has a soft pulse with intervals that build up to an electronic orchestration of industrial beats. David Browne of Entertainment Weekly called it a [...] "moony lullaby" [...] and compared it {{to the music of}} Enya. In his review for Spin, James Hunter wrote that the track is one of the times Björk [...] "dips her toe into the warm lake of tradition" [...] and noted its [...] "rockish minor-key verses traipse off into her gospel." ...|$|E
