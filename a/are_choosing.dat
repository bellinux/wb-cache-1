500|$|Marital {{infidelity}} features {{throughout the}} sections of the novel narrated by Sarah. Cleave discussed: [...] "When you <b>are</b> <b>choosing</b> a lover, you're choosing a philosophy; it's not about sex, it's not about marriage. With Sarah, her unfaithfulness {{is just one of}} the symptoms of the fact that she's torn and is going to have to make this strong moral choice." [...] Sarah's storyline also explores her moral culpability following Andrew's suicide. Personal accountability is a central theme of the novel, with Elkins of The New York Times opining that by not focusing on [...] "postcolonial guilt or African angst", Cleave is able to use the novel to challenge readers' conceptions of civility and ethical choice. Margot Kaminski of the San Francisco Chronicle similarly feels that the book delivered a message of anti-complacency, however believes that is does so by [...] "bemoaning the normality of the First World in the face of the horrors of the Third."

2500|$|Recently, in North America and Europe specifically, {{there have}} been drastic changes in the nature and {{character}} of relationships.

[...] These transformations may be attributed to the changing labor markets, marital tax laws along with new and different value sets and lifestyles. [...] In societies where marriage is no longer uncritically perceived as a monogamous lifelong relationship, getting married seems a more dubious enterprise. [...] Marriage, sex, and childbearing, which have been a tightly bound package for much of the 20th century, are no longer so inextricably linked.|$|E
