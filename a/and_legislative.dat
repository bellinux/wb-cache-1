5|$|By {{the time}} the debates <b>and</b> <b>legislative</b> {{maneuvering}} that went into crafting the Bill of Rights amendments was done, many personal opinions had shifted. A number of Federalists came out in support, thus silencing the Anti-Federalists' most effective critique. Many Anti-Federalists, in contrast, were now opposed, realizing that Congressional approval of these amendments would greatly lessen {{the chances of a}} second constitutional convention. Anti-Federalists such as Richard Henry Lee also argued that the Bill left the most objectionable portions of the Constitution, such as the federal judiciary and direct taxation, intact.|$|E

5|$|Since the Confederacy was founded, {{among other}} things, on states' rights, one {{important}} factor in Davis's choice of cabinet members was representation from the various states.

This also led to complaints as more states joined the Confederacy, however, because there were more states than cabinet positions.|$|E

5|$|The {{refusal of}} the United States {{government}} to take promised military action {{in the face of}} North Vietnamese violations of the cease-fire is also examined as a key to the defeat.

The conflict between the executive <b>and</b> <b>legislative</b> branches of the American government, already severe before the onset of the Operation Linebacker II in 1972, was only more exasperating during 1975, when a new campaign would probably only have provoked even more Congressional outrage.|$|E

40|$|Inter{{national}} {{support for}} national systems of representative marine protected {{areas have been}} set {{in place by the}} World Conservation Strategy (WCS) and the National Conservation Strategy of Australia (NCSA). Australia has adopted the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) objectives for marine protected areas through the Commonwealth and State intergovernmental Council of Nature Conservation Ministers (CONCOM). The thesis examines international marine protected area developments and then proceeds to an assessment of existing Commonwealth <b>and</b> State <b>legislative</b> <b>and</b> institutional arrangements for Australian marine protected areas. It argues that existing Commonwealth <b>and</b> State <b>legislative</b> <b>and</b> institutional arrangements for marine protected areas are incapable of meeting WCS/NCSA objectives. The thesis examines how the inherent difficulties of Australian federalism in relation to offshore jurisdictional disputes have influenced marine protected area legislation and have shaped institutional arrangements for meeting these international objectives. An open system of conservation is distinguished from a closed system of conservation by the way it explicitly recognizes that outside activities may compromise the ecological integrity of the marine protected area. Australia's Great Barrier Reef Marine Park in Queensland is taken as a case study to illustrate the evolution of Commonwealth <b>and</b> State intergovernmental <b>legislative</b> <b>and</b> institutional arrangements, and as a potential model for an open system of conservation meeting WCS/NCSA objectives for marine protected areas. Three options are canvassed for the future operation of an Australian marine protected area system: (1) the status quo; (2) incremental change of existing Commonwealth <b>and</b> State <b>legislative</b> <b>and</b> institutional arrangments; and (3) the introduction of cooperative Commonwealth <b>and</b> State <b>legislative</b> <b>and</b> institutional arrangements in accordance with the United Nations Environment, Scientific, and Cultural Organization's (UNESCO) Man and The Biosphere (MAB) biosphere reserve programs. Cooperative intergovernmental Commonwealth <b>and</b> State <b>legislative</b> <b>and</b> institutional reform, based on the ecological principles of protected area planning and management of MAB, is advocated as an appropriate framework for a representative Australian system of marine protected areas. A <b>legislative</b> <b>and</b> institutional framework supporting an Australian marine biosphere reserve system is outlined and implications discussed, as are constraints in realizing such a system...|$|R
