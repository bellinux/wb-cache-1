2500|$|Design of {{the engine}} {{was carried out by}} Frank Halford at his London {{consulting}} firm starting in April 1941. It was based on the basic design pioneered by Frank Whittle, using a centrifugal compressor providing compressed air to sixteen individual combustion chambers, from which the exhaust powered a single-stage <b>axial</b> <b>turbine.</b> Compared to Whittle designs, the H-1 was [...] "cleaned up" [...] in that it used a single-sided compressor with the inlet at the front, and a [...] "straight through" [...] layout with the combustion chambers exhausting straight onto the turbine. Whittle's designs such as the Power Jets W.2 used a [...] "reverse flow" [...] layout that piped the hot air back to the middle {{of the engine}}, in order to [...] "fold" [...] it and reduce its length and to reduce the turbine entry temperature, a safeguard necessary for the turbine materials available when Whittle was designing the engines. Although it eliminated the Whittle-style [...] "folding", the Goblin was still a very compact design.|$|E

2500|$|In Tesla's time, the {{efficiency}} of conventional turbines was low because turbines used a direct drive system that severely limited the potential speed of a turbine to whatever it was driving. At the time of introduction, modern ship turbines were massive and included dozens, or even hundreds of stages of turbines. Yet produced extremely low efficiency due to their low speed. The Tesla turbine also {{had the ability to}} run on higher temperature gasses than bladed turbines of the time contributed to its greater efficiency. Eventually <b>axial</b> <b>turbines</b> were given gearing to allow them to operate at higher speeds, but efficiency of <b>axial</b> <b>turbines</b> remained very low in comparison to the Tesla Turbine.|$|R
2500|$|As {{time went}} on, {{competing}} <b>Axial</b> <b>turbines</b> became dramatically {{more efficient and}} powerful, a second stage of reduction gears was introduced in most cutting edge U.S. naval ships of the 1930s. The improvement in steam technology gave the U.S. Aircraft Carriers a clear advantage in speed over both Allied and enemy aircraft carriers, and so the proven <b>axial</b> steam <b>turbines</b> became the preferred form of propulsion until the 1973 oil embargo took place. The oil crisis drove the majority of new civilian vessels to turn to diesel engines. <b>Axial</b> steam <b>turbines</b> still had not exceeded 50% efficiency by that time, and so civilian ships chose to utilize diesel engines due to their superior efficiency. By this time, the comparably efficient Tesla turbine was over 60 years old.|$|R

5000|$|In a turbine, the stator element {{contains}} blades or ports used {{to redirect}} {{the flow of}} fluid. Such devices include the steam turbine and the torque converter. In a mechanical siren, the stator contains one or more rows of holes that admit air into the rotor; by controlling the flow of air through the holes, {{the sound of the}} siren can be altered. A stator can be used to great effect to reduce the turbulence and rotational energy introduced by an <b>axial</b> <b>turbine</b> fan, creating a steady column of air with a lower Reynolds number.|$|E
50|$|Compared to an {{axial flow}} turbine, a radial turbine can employ a {{relatively}} higher pressure ratio (â4) per stage with lower flow rates.

40|$|Complicated {{unsteady}} flow in <b>axial</b> <b>turbines</b> produces high-frequency unsteady aerodynamic exciting force, which threatens the safe operation of turbines.

Meanwhile, the flow phenomenon including stator wakes and passage vortex is shown. In addition, the interaction of upstream negative-bowed wakes contributes to the reduction of unsteady blade load fluctuation. Furthermore, the aerodynamic exciting force decreases with the increasing negative bowed degree, while the efficiency is correspondingly reduced. This paper provides the reference for the alleviation of the harmful impact caused by unsteady interaction with the method of wake control...|$|R
