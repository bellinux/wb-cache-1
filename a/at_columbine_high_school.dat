Violence, or the threat of violence, has a direct impact on the quality of education provided and on the way teachers and students work together in the classroom (Winett, 1998). Well-disciplined, effective schools are not a product of chance; it takes administrators, teachers, students, and parents working together to provide an environment conducive to learning (Marzano & Pickering, 2002). Developments in recent years indicate {{there is a need to}} change the way discipline is addressed. It is no longer enough to preserve the past’s narrow perception of the role of discipline. School administrators are just beginning to learn and understand that discipline includes much more than handing down punishment. This qualitative study focused on perceptions of administrators, teachers and parents in terms of effective discipline practices. Schools are discovering that the mos...|$|R

In addition to the shootings, the complex and highly planned attack involved a fire bomb to divert firefighters, propane tanks converted to bombs placed in the cafeteria, 99 explosive devices, and car bombs. The perpetrators, senior students Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, murdered 12 students and one teacher.

It was the deadliest shooting in Colorado since the Columbine High School massacre and, in terms of both the dead and wounded in the number of casualties, was the largest single mass shooting in U.S. history.|$|E

2500|$|The {{link between}} {{bullying}} and school violence has attracted increasing attention since the 1999 attack <b>at</b> <b>Columbine</b> <b>High</b> <b>School.</b> Both of the shooters {{were classified as}} gifted children who had allegedly been victims of bullying for four years. According to Brooks Brown, Klebold and Harris were the most ostracized students in the entire school, and even many of those close to them regarded the two as [...] "the losers of the losers". Klebold {{is known to have}} remarked to his father of his hatred of the jock culture at Columbine, adding that Harris in particular had been victimized by this social group. In this remark, Klebold had stated, [...] "They sure give Eric hell." [...] On another occasion just weeks before the massacre, both Harris and Klebold had been confronted by a group of youths at the school—all members of the football team—who had sprayed them with ketchup and mustard while referring to the pair as [...] "faggots" [...] and [...] "queers".|$|E
2500|$|In 1999, {{a school}} {{shooting}} <b>at</b> <b>Columbine</b> <b>High</b> <b>School</b> in Littleton, Colorado created a public backlash against local goths and especially gothic youths as some {{teachers and parents}} suddenly began to view goth fashion with suspicion and mistrust. Violence of any kind had always been very rare at Toronto goth clubs, and notable figures in the goth community spoke to the media against associating violence with [...] "goth". They insisted that the shooters were not goths, did not listen to goth music, and that goths were non-violent and pacifistic. Certain elements of the media, notably the local entertainment and culture media, also defended goths. Eye Weekly columnist Donna Lypchuk wrote, [...] "I've been laughing {{for the past two}} weeks as talking heads blame the goth subculture for the killings in Colorado. The mainstream goth movement, which has been around for at least 25 years, is not secret enough to be a subversive society." [...] Five months later a report from authorities in Colorado confirmed that the shooting was not related to goth subculture, and stated that the shooters held goth music in [...] "contempt".|$|E
2500|$|Significant edits {{were made}} to {{aggressive}} and violent lyrics that were aimed at police, prostitutes, women, homosexuals, and schools. In response to the attack that had occurred <b>at</b> <b>Columbine</b> <b>High</b> <b>School</b> in April 1999, names of guns and sounds of them firing were censored. [...] Interscope Records insisted on censoring the words [...] "kids" [...] and [...] "Columbine" [...] from the line [...] "I take seven [...] from , stand them all in line" [...] from [...] "I'm Back", even on the explicit version of the album. Mike Rubin of Spin called the censorship a [...] "curious decision, given that lyrics like 'Take drugs / Rape sluts' are apparently permissible". Eminem commented on his lyrics regarding the shooting, [...] "That Columbine shit is so fucking touchy. As much sympathy as we give the Columbine shootings, nobody ever looked {{at it from the}} fuckin' {{point of view of the}} kids who were bullied—I mean, they took their own fucking life! And it was because they were pushed so far to the fucking edge that they were fucking so mad. I've been that mad." [...] The full line appears uncensored in Eminem's song [...] "Rap God" [...] from The Marshall Mathers LP 2. The line [...] "It doesn't matter [...] faggot" [...] was also censored from [...] "Marshall Mathers", which refers to his mother Debbie Nelson's lawyer, who assisted her in filing a lawsuit against the rapper for defamation regarding lyrics from The Slim Shady LP.|$|E
