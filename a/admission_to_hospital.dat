5|$|A novel {{vaccine for}} dengue fever has been {{approved}} and is commercially available {{in a number of}} countries. Other methods of prevention are by reducing mosquito habitat and limiting exposure to bites. This may be done by getting rid of or covering standing water and wearing clothing that covers much of the body. Treatment of acute dengue is supportive and includes giving fluid either by mouth or intravenously for mild or moderate disease. For more severe cases blood transfusion may be required. About half a million people require <b>admission</b> <b>to</b> <b>hospital</b> a year. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen should not be used.|$|E
5|$|Cholangitis {{requires}} <b>admission</b> <b>to</b> <b>hospital.</b> Intravenous fluids are administered, {{especially if}} the blood pressure is low, and antibiotics are commenced. Empirical treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics is usually necessary until it is known for certain which pathogen is causing the infection, and to which antibiotics it is sensitive. Combinations of penicillins and aminoglycosides are widely used, although ciprofloxacin {{has been shown to}} be effective in most cases, and may be preferred to aminoglycosides because of fewer side effects. Metronidazole is often added to specifically treat the anaerobic pathogens, especially in those who are very ill or at risk of anaerobic infections. Antibiotics are continued for 7–10days. Drugs that increase the blood pressure (vasopressors) may also be required to counter the low blood pressure.|$|E
5|$|Small {{spontaneous}} pneumothoraces do {{not always}} require treatment, as {{they are unlikely to}} proceed to respiratory failure or tension pneumothorax, and generally resolve spontaneously. This approach is most appropriate if the estimated size of the pneumothorax is small (defined as <50% of the volume of the hemithorax), there is no breathlessness, and there is no underlying lung disease. It may be appropriate to treat a larger PSP conservatively if the symptoms are limited. <b>Admission</b> <b>to</b> <b>hospital</b> is often not required, as long as clear instructions are given to return to hospital if there are worsening symptoms. Further investigations may be performed as an outpatient, at which time X-rays are repeated to confirm improvement, and advice given with regard to preventing recurrence (see below). Estimated rates of resorption are between 1.25% and 2.2% the volume of the cavity per day. This would mean that even a complete pneumothorax would spontaneously resolve over a period of about 6 weeks. There; however, is no high quality evidence comparing conservative to non conservative management.|$|E
40|$|Background: In 1996 {{the number}} of deaths and <b>admissions</b> <b>to</b> <b>hospital</b> in Canada that could be {{attributed}} to the use of alcohol, tobacco and illicit drugs were esti-mated from 1992 data. In this paper we update these estimates to the year 1995. Methods: On the basis of pooled estimates of relative risk, etiologic fractions were calculated by age, sex and province for 90 causes of disease or death attribut-able to alcohol, tobacco or illicit drugs; the etiologic fractions were then applied to national mortality and morbidity data for 1995 to estimate {{the number of}} deaths and <b>admissions</b> <b>to</b> <b>hospital</b> attributable <b>to</b> substance abuse. Results: In 1995, 6507 deaths and 82 014 <b>admissions</b> <b>to</b> <b>hospital</b> were attributed <b>to</b> alcohol, 34 728 deaths and 194 072 <b>admissions</b> <b>to</b> <b>hospital</b> were attributed <b>to</b> tobacco, and 805 deaths and 6940 <b>admissions</b> <b>to</b> <b>hospital</b> were due <b>to</b> illicit drugs. Interpretation: The use and misuse of alcohol, tobacco and illicit drugs accounted for 20. 0 % of deaths, 22. 2 % of years of potential life lost and 9. 4 % of admission...|$|R

25|$|Bowel obstruction, {{also known}} as {{intestinal}} obstruction, is a mechanical or functional obstruction of the intestines which prevents the normal movement of the products of digestion. Either the small bowel or large bowel may be affected. Signs and symptoms include abdominal pain, vomiting, bloating, and not passing gas.

25|$|Prevention {{involves}} decreasing mosquito bites {{in areas}} where the disease occurs and proper use of condoms. Efforts to prevent bites include the use of insect repellent, covering much of the body with clothing, mosquito nets, and getting rid of standing water where mosquitoes reproduce. There is no effective vaccine. Health officials recommended that women in areas affected by the 2015–16 Zika outbreak consider putting off pregnancy and that pregnant women not travel to these areas. While there is no specific treatment, paracetamol (acetaminophen) may help with the symptoms. <b>Admission</b> <b>to</b> <b>hospital</b> is rarely necessary.|$|E

25|$|Treatment of {{anorexia}} involves restoring {{a healthy}} weight, treating the underlying psychological problems, and addressing behaviors that promote the problem. While medications do not help with weight gain, {{they may be}} used to help with associated anxiety or depression. A number of types of therapy may be useful including an approach where parents assume responsibility for feeding their child, known as Maudsley family therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy. Sometimes people require <b>admission</b> <b>to</b> <b>hospital</b> to restore weight. Evidence for benefit from nasogastric tube feeding, however, is unclear. Some people will just have a single episode and recover while others may have many episodes over years. Many complications improve or resolve with regaining of weight.|$|E
25|$|During {{a period}} of 13 years (1980–1993) for which admissions to the Kfar Shaul Mental Health Centre in Jerusalem were analyzed, it was {{reported}} that 1,200 tourists with severe, Jerusalem-themed mental problems, were referred to this clinic. Of these, 470 were admitted to hospital. On average, 100 such tourists have been seen annually, 40 of them requiring <b>admission</b> <b>to</b> <b>hospital.</b> About 2 million tourists visit Jerusalem each year. Kalian and Witztum note that as a proportion of the total numbers of tourists visiting the city, this is not significantly different from any other city.

25|$|Adolescents who misuse alcohol {{can benefit}} from {{interventions}} aimed at risk reduction. For more severe cases an intervention involving parents, guardians, and/or a psychotherapist is recommended. An effective strategy of intervention for adolescents whose binge drinking leads to <b>admission</b> <b>to</b> <b>hospital,</b> e.g. for alcohol poisoning or injury, is manualised brief interventions at the hospital in one to four counseling sessions each lasting 30 to 60 minutes conducted by trained staff. Evaluation of personal pattern of drinking and associated risks and an emphasis on personal responsibility in a non-condescending manner is recommended during the intervention; discussing and informing/educating the adolescent of possible negative short and long-term consequences of drinking is recommended. The setting of goals and rules to achieve those goals is also recommended during intervention with problem binge drinking adolescents.|$|E

25|$|Pyometra (or a pus filled womb) ('Pyo' = pus; 'metra' = uterus or womb) is a {{life-threatening}} condition that requires emergency veterinary treatment. The {{risk of a}} non-spayed bitch developing pyometra by age 10 is 25% across all breeds, but can {{be as high as}} 54% in some breeds. The treatment of choice for a closed-pyometra (where the cervix is closed and the pus cannot drain) is <b>admission</b> <b>to</b> <b>hospital,</b> commencement on intravenous fluids and appropriate antibiotics and, once stable enough for the anaesthetic and surgery, emergency removal of the infected pus-filled uterus. Medical management can be attempted if the animal's condition allows (for example {{in the case of an}} 'open' pyometra where the pus drains per-vaginum from the uterus via the open cervix) or dictates (where the animal is too old or otherwise unwell to withstand surgery), if the owner wishes to keep the dog entire to breed or if the owner is unable to afford the veterinary fees associated with surgery. Emergency removal of the infected uterus carries a much higher degree of risk of death than a routine 'spay' operation. The risk of death from in dogs undergoing surgical treatment for pyometra is up to 17%. Thus the risk of death in entire female dogs from a pyometra, even if given correct veterinary attention can be up to 9% by 10 years of age (17% of 54%). This risk is reduced to virtually zero if spayed.|$|E

40|$|Problem: Inhabitants of Torres Strait Islands {{have the}} highest {{prevalence}} of diabetes in Australia and many preventable complications. In 1999, a one year randomised cluster trial showed improved diabetes care processes and reduced <b>admissions</b> <b>to</b> <b>hospital</b> when local indigenous health workers used registers, recall and reminder systems, and basic diabetes care plans, supported by a specialist outreach service. This study looked at whether those improvements were sustained {{two years after the}} end of the trial. Design: Three year follow up clinical audit of 21 primary healthcare centres, and review of <b>admissions</b> <b>to</b> <b>hospital</b> in the previous 12 months. Background and setting: Remote indigenous communities in far north east Australia, population about 9600, including 921 people with diabetes. Key measures for improvement: Number of people on registers, care processes (regular measures of weight, blood pressure, haemoglobin A 1 c, urinary protein concentration, and concentrations of serum lipids and creatinine), appropriate clinical interventions (drug treatment and vaccinations), and intermediate patient outcome measures (weight, blood pressure, and glycaemic control). <b>Admissions</b> <b>to</b> <b>hospital.</b> Strategies for change: Audit and feedback to clinicians and managers; provision of clinical guidelines and a clear management structure; workshops and training. Effects of change: The number of people on registers increased from 555 in 1999 to 921 in 2002. Most care processes and clinical interventions improved.

2500|$|Three {{medical experts}} gave {{conflicting}} evidence {{into the nature}} of Brian Rossiter's injuries.
