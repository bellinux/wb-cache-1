30|$|Increasing {{energy price}} {{is reduced by}} {{increasing}} solar <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> energy capacities that are supported by incentive and regulation which surpass increasing cost factors for solar <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> generations. When incentive and regulation lose their impacts {{on the cost of}} solar <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> energies at the medium period, newly generated energy capacities of solar <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> systems decrease in a few iterations but then they recover their increasing state. This state stems from increasing solar <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> energy capacities that cause the increase in energy demand and reduce of energy price and profits such that model reacts to balance the system by decreasing supports (incentive and regulation) on solar <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> energies.|$|R

Depending on the interaction of solar <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> resources, PV <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> power industry become competitors or allies. Time resolved geospatial data of global horizontal irradiation (GHI) <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> speeds are used to simulate the power feed-in of PV <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> power plants on every region of a 1 °x 1 ° mesh of latitude and longitude between 65 °N and 65 °S. An overlap of PV <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> power full load hours has been defined and identified as ranging between 5 % and 25 % of total PV <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> power feed-in. Critical full load hours have been defined and discussed. Energy losses that would appear if the grid was dimensioned only for one power plant of PV or wind, do not exceed 9 % of total feed-in but are mainly around 3 %- 4 %. Thus the two major renewable power technologies are characterized by complementing each other...|$|R

30|$|Cost {{of solar}} (COSE)/wind (COWE) energy, {{technological}} applicability for solar (TASE)/wind (TAWE) energy and solar (SEI)/wind (WEI) energy incentive factors directly affect {{the amount of}} newly generated solar <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> energy capacities <b>and</b> also have indirect effects on other global factors. The cost of energy systems refers {{the total amount of}} cost that stem from investment cost, production, transmission and distribution costs. Technological applicability for energy systems represents the applicability of solar <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> energy technologies under the given geological, physical, and operational conditions for generation and distribution of the solar <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> energy. Other auxiliary factors around the solar <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> energy generations are an incentive and any type of governmental supports that encourage users and investors to direct the solar <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> energy usage <b>and</b> investments. Solar <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> energy incentive are monetary (e.g., zero-interest loan, tax relief, feed-in-tariff) or non-monetary (e.g., law, regulation, policies) encouragement programs whose special purposes are to increase the use of solar <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> energy-efficient equipment <b>and</b> reduce non-renewable energy usage.|$|R

5|$|Residents and {{tourists}} in southern Florida were {{unprepared for the}} unusual off-season storm. Winds of up to 65mph (105km/h) spread across the area, causing damage to windows and power lines. The storm dropped 2–4inches (50–100mm) of precipitation along its path; the combination of unseasonable rainfall <b>and</b> <b>winds</b> resulted in crop damage in Miami-Dade County.|$|E

30|$|Active {{factors in}} the initial state lose their effects on the other factors during the {{iteration}} process. Decreasing investments and new generation capacities of the solar <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> energies stimulate governments to take precaution for supporting these concepts by regulation and incentive. Also, decreasing cost of solar <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> energy systems are balanced by incentive and general energy demand and prices. Technical applicability for solar <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> energy are limited by solar <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> energy systems, so their positive active initial values decrease and reach steady states at zero values.|$|R

The combination of Danielle {{and a high}} pressure system produced higher than normal tides and strong waves, causing beach erosion and light coastal damage.

5|$|A simple rule {{of thumb}} is that for {{high-pressure}} areas, where generally air flows from the center outward, the coriolis force given by the earth's rotation to the air circulation is in the opposite direction of earth's apparent rotation if viewed from above the hemisphere's pole. So, both the earth <b>and</b> <b>winds</b> around a low-pressure area rotate counter-clockwise in the northern hemisphere, and clockwise in the southern. The opposite to these two cases occurs {{in the case of a}} high. These results derive from the Coriolis effect; that article explains in detail the physics, and provides an animation of a model to aid understanding.|$|E

25|$|According to Benjamin K.

Correlations between power swings drop substantially as more solar <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> farms are integrated (a process known as geographical smoothing) and a wider geographic area also enables a larger pool of energy efficiency efforts to abate intermittency.|$|R

Officials enacted many preparations, although damage ended up being minimal on the island. Two people were killed on Taiwan, however. Sinlaku weakened slightly before making its final landfall in eastern China near Wenzhou on September7. There, the storm produced a record wind gust of 204km/h (127mph), and {{just south of the}} city, high waves destroyed several piers and a large boat. High rainfall <b>and</b> <b>winds</b> from Sinlaku destroyed 58,000houses, and large areas of crops were destroyed. Damage in China was estimated at $709million, and there were 28deaths there.|$|E
5|$|Although officially {{designated}} a tropical cyclone by the NHC, Météo-France, the French meteorological service, stated in their annual {{report to the}} World Meteorological Organization that Grace {{should not have been}} classified a tropical system. In their report, they argued that although the storm presented deep convection, an eye-like feature, <b>and</b> <b>winds</b> above 60mph (95km/h), the overall development of Grace was more similar to that of a mid-latitude non-tropical cyclone. However, operationally, Météo-France considered Grace to be a subtropical cyclone. They also criticized the NHC of warning upon this system based on recent trends of the link between global warming and increased hurricane activity.|$|E
5|$|Damage was {{heaviest}} in Myanmar {{where the}} storm moved ashore, <b>and</b> <b>winds</b> of 157km/h (98mph) were reported. Widespread areas reported winds of 40km/h (25mph). The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission estimated {{that up to}} 500mm (20in) of precipitation fell along the Bay of Bengal coast in Myanmar and Bangladesh. There were reports of waves 15m (50ft) in height along the coast. A high storm surge and coastal flooding inundated four towns in Rakhine State, causing damage to water systems. Flooding was visible on satellite imagery {{in the days following}} the cyclone. Eight townships in the state were affected, five of them severely.|$|E
30|$|Increasing solar <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> energy {{generation}} capacities cause {{the increase of}} energy supply and reduce of the energy price that also increases the energy consumption and energy demand. Increase {{in the cost of}} solar <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> energy in the medium period cause the decrease of the newly generated solar <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> energy capacities <b>and</b> the energy supply. This energy bottleneck indicates that energy price will rise and energy demand will reduce in the same period. Energy supply, demand and price and new solar <b>and</b> <b>wind</b> {{energy generation}} capacities factors converge to steady state at zero value in small fluctuations.|$|R
