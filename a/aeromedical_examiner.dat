40|$|The {{bicuspid}} {{aortic valve}} (BAV) {{is the most}} common congenital heart malformation, affecting up to 2 % of the population (1), while the remainder of heart mal-formations total only 0. 8 %. More than 33 % of the affected patients with bicuspid valves will eventually develop complications. Dilatation of the aorta must be closely controlled in the presence of BAV (2) : aortic root replacement surgery is indicated earlier (diameter of 45 - 50 mm) than in those patients with tricuspid aor-tic valves (diameter> 55 mm) (3 - 7). Alternative tech-niques, such as tricuspidization to restore a normal valve function, have been described by PrÃªtre et al. (8) and Anderson (9). Whilst this technique may offer promise under certain circumstances, long-term results are still lacking. Cardiac surgery is rare in pilots, and even rarer in military pilots. The flight-licensing procedure for the return to duty of a pilot represents a challenge for both the cardiac surgeon and the <b>Aeromedical</b> <b>Examiner</b> (AME), the latter being the only physician competent to determine the flight sta-tus of a pilot. To date, only one case of aortic valve replacement (AVR) in a United States Air Force pilot has been reported (10). Address for correspondence...|$|E
40|$|Background and {{aim of the}} study: Bicuspid {{aortic valve}} {{is the most common}} {{congenital}} heart malformation, and a high percentage of patients with this condition will develop complications over time. It is rare that pilots undergo aortic valve surgery, and the confirmation of flight-licensing requirements after aortic valve replacement (AVR) is a challenge for the patient's cardiac surgeon and, particularly, for the <b>Aeromedical</b> <b>Examiner</b> (AME). Only AMEs are able to determine the flight status of pilots. Furthermore, in military and in civil aviation (e. g., Red Bull Air Race), the high G-load environment experienced by pilots is an exceptional physiological parameter, which must be considered postoperatively. Methods: A review was conducted of the aeronautical, surgical and medical literature, and of European pilot-licensing regulations. Case studies are also reported for two Swiss Air Force pilots. Results: According to European legislation, pilots can return to flight duty from the sixth postoperative month, with the following limitations: that an aortic bioprosthesis presents no restrictions in cardiac function, requires no cardioactive medications, yet requires a flight operation with co-pilot, the avoidance of accelerations over + 3 Gz and, in military aviation, restricts the pilot to non-ejection-seat aircraft. The patient follow up must include both echocardiographic and rhythm assessments every six months. Mechanical prostheses cannot be certified because the required anticoagulation therapy is a disqualifying condition for pilot licensing. Conclusion: Pilot licensing after aortic valve surgery is possible, but with restrictions. The +Gz exposition is of concern in both military and civilian aviation (aerobatics). The choice of bioprosthesis type and size is determinant. Pericardial and stentless valves seem to show better flow characteristics under high-output conditions. Repetitive cardiological controls are mandatory for the early assessment of structural valve disease and rhythm disturbances. A pre-emptive timing is recommended when reoperation is indicated, without waiting for clinical manifestations of structural valve disease...|$|E
