5|$|A {{significant}} portion of the game is spent sailing between islands on Link's boat, the King of Red Lions. The boat's sail is driven by wind that blows across the game world in one of eight directions; a tailwind behind the boat will give it top speed, while sailing <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> is difficult. The Great Sea features different enemies and obstacles than appear on land. Some items serve new purposes on the King of Red Lions; for instance, the grappling hook serves as a crane for recovering sunken treasure. Link explores the sea {{with the help of a}} sea chart, which can be updated with information on each square and island. Through the game, Link acquires additional charts pointing the way to treasure chests and significant locations. On land, dungeons feature similar maps.|$|E
5|$|It {{was one of}} Warren's ships, the frigate HMS Arethusa, {{which first}} {{discovered}} the French as Villaret led his fleet out from the sheltered anchorage. Lookouts on Arethusa miscounted the French fleet, identifying 16 ships {{of the line and}} ten frigates; Warren immediately sent word to Bridport while ordering his convoy to turn away from the French. Villaret did not pursue Warren's force: he may not have gauged its true strength correctly, and his ships were running low on provisions having only taken enough aboard for 15 days at sea in their haste to leave Brest a week earlier. On the morning of 20 June, Warren's force sighted Bridport's fleet to the south-east, the admiral sending orders to Warren to detach his three ships of the line to bolster Bridport's fleet {{in the face of the}} supposedly more numerous French force. Without waiting for these reinforcements, Bridport sailed back towards the coast <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind,</b> seeking to place his fleet between the Quiberon expedition and Villaret's ships.|$|E
5|$|The 1941 VFL season {{went ahead}} despite {{the loss of}} many players to {{military}} service. Miller alternated between playing in the backline and in attack depending on match conditions. When St Kilda were kicking downwind, Miller would play in attack, and when they kicked <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind,</b> {{he would return to}} a defensive position. In the forward line, he alternated with Sam Loxton, a future Invincibles teammate. He booted 28 goals in 16 games, including eight in one match against North Melbourne. Miller also gained a reputation among opponents for kicking them in the ankles. He again showed his disrespect for authority and reputation. In one match against Melbourne, for whom his boss and state cricket teammate Percy Beames played, Miller charged towards Beames with a raised elbow {{at the start of the}} match, forcing his boss to be taken from the field. Miller came second in St Kilda's best and fairest for 1941 as his team again came second to last.|$|E

5|$|The {{depression}} tracked to {{the northwest}} through the Yucatán Channel into an area of increased wind shear, which left the center exposed and elongated. Despite its poor structure, the system maintained strong winds in its eastern semicircle. The depression intensified into Tropical Storm Alberto early on June 11 about 260miles (420km) southwest of the Dry Tortugas, based on Hurricane Hunters' reports of flight level winds of 50mph (80km/h) in a few convective bands. Upon becoming a tropical storm, the low-level circulation had become better defined, though forecasts predicted the wind shear would increase, preventing significant strengthening of the storm. One forecaster at the National Hurricane Center remarked the system resembled a subtropical cyclone. However, deep convection developed and built westward <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> shear as the overall organization improved. At the same time Alberto turned northeastward {{under the influence of}} an approaching trough. On June 12, the circulation abruptly reformed under the area of deepest convection, which coincided with the storm's passage over the loop current; consequentially, Alberto quickly strengthened to reach peak winds of 70mph (115km/h) about 220miles (350km) west-northwest of Tampa, Florida.|$|E
5|$|The {{plot was}} an {{original}} story by T. E. B. Clarke, {{a writer of}} both comedy and drama scripts for Ealing; his other screenplays for the studio include Hue and Cry (1947), <b>Against</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wind</b> (1948), The Blue Lamp (1950), The Lavender Hill Mob (1951) and The Titfield Thunderbolt (1953). Clarke was inspired by an incident during the Second World War, when the maternity ward of Ottawa Civic Hospital was temporarily declared extraterritorial by the Canadian government {{so that when the}} then-Princess Juliana of the Netherlands gave birth to Princess Margriet of the Netherlands, the baby was born on international territory, thus not on Canadian territory (though not on Dutch territory), and would not lose her right to the throne. The airlift of food supplies into the Burgundian enclave was influenced by the flights of food and supplies during the Berlin Blockade of June 1948 – May 1949. The music for the film was composed by Georges Auric, who had been involved in several other productions for Ealing Studios.|$|E
5|$|Dividing the {{captured}} British sailors, Lejoille transferred half to Généreux and left half on Leander with a French prize crew under Louis Gabriel Deniéport. In direct contravention {{of the established}} conventions of war, both sets of prisoners were immediately ordered to effect repairs to the vessels. Only once both ships were ready for the journey to Corfu were the prisoners given bread and water, although the wounded were still denied medical attention. For ten days after the engagement the battered ships sailed northwards <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind,</b> Généreux forced to attach a tow to Leander to avoid leaving the prize behind. On 28 August, a sail appeared to the south. Panic broke out on Généreux, and Lejoille ordered the prisoners confined below and for preparations {{to be made to}} abandon Leander and make all speed for Corfu. The new arrival was in fact the 16-gun British sloop HMS Mutine under Lieutenant Thomas Bladen Capel, carrying the second copies of Nelson's despatches to Britain. Capel sighted the ships to the north, but assumed that they were Généreux and Guillaume Tell and so passed by displaying French colours. Lejoille was not fooled by the disguise but did not pursue the small vessel, continuing his passage to Corfu once Mutine had sailed out of sight.|$|E

5|$|During the Song dynasty, {{previous}} works on architecture {{were brought to}} more sophisticated levels of description, as in Yili Shigong, written by Li Ruogui in 1193 AD. One of the most definitive works, however, was the earlier Mu Jing ("Timberwork Manual"), ascribed to Yu Hao and written sometime between 965 and 995. Yu Hao {{was responsible for the}} construction of a wooden pagoda tower in Kaifeng, which was destroyed by lightning and replaced by the brick Iron Pagoda soon after. In his time, books on architecture were still considered a lowly scholarly achievement due to the craft's status, so Mu Jing was not even recorded in the official court bibliography. Although the book itself was lost to history, the scientist and statesman Shen Kuo wrote of Yu's work extensively in his Dream Pool Essays of 1088, praising it as a work of architectural genius, saying that no one in his own time could reproduce such a work. Shen Kuo singled out, among other passages, a scene in which Yu Hao gives advice to another artisan-architect about slanting struts in order to brace a pagoda <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind,</b> and a passage in which Yu Hao describes the three sections of a building, the area above the crossbeams, the area above ground, and the foundation, and then proceeds to provide proportional ratios and construction techniques for each section.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} quarter, Maryland {{advanced}} to the Oklahoma 20-yard line, and Tatum elected for a field goal attempt. Now <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind,</b> the kick failed, with the ball going wide right. The Sooners took over on downs and halfback Jack Ging completed a pass to end Max Boydston for a five-yard gain. Ging then rushed for threeyards. On the next play, Calame pitched to Grigg who ran {{to the left and}} picked up 12yards for a first down. Calame then completed a pass to back Bob Burris for sixyards. Grigg faked a pass and ran to the right for a gain of 12yards and a first down on the Maryland 39-yard line. The Terrapins stopped two Sooner rushing attempts before Calame connected with Burris again for an 11-yard gain. Burris then rushed for threemore yards to advance to the Maryland 25. Tatum called a time-out. On third down with oneyard to go, Calame faked a handoff to Ging and executed an option run to the left. He pitched to Grigg and threw a block. Grigg was tackled at the goal-line but managed to extend his body into the endzone. Buddy Leake made the extra point. Shortly before halftime, Calame suffered a separated collarbone. With back-up Pat O'Neal also injured, only third-string quarterback Jack Van Pool remained, and he had little game experience.|$|E
5|$|Three months later, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) shows Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) a photo taken {{moments before}} Teddy's death, {{showing that the}} balloon moved {{horizontally}} <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind.</b> Chuck Burks (Bill Dow), a digital photo expert, uses software to uncover evidence of electromagnetic disturbances {{in the shape of}} a child, holding the balloon. During a visit by the agents, the Holveys adamantly dispute Mulder's theory that Teddy was led onto the tracks. Scully sees Golda (Lilyan Chauvin), Maggie's elderly Romanian mother, drawing a swastika on Charlie’s hand. Scully hypothesizes that the Holvey children may be victims of Munchausen by proxy, perpetrated by their grandmother. At a meeting with Steve Holvey, he explains that Golda was against his marriage to Maggie, and that strange things began to happen when Teddy was born and Golda came to live with the family. Steve hints that Golda might be hurting Charlie, leading Scully to suggest that they visit a social worker named Karen Kosseff (Christine Willes). When preparing to leave for a session with Kosseff, Steve and Charlie get in the car but the garage sliding door seems to be malfunctioning, making Steve to step out and take a double-sided ladder to reset the sliding door's motor but in doing so, his tie is caught in the door rails with the motor suddenly starting, strangling and hanging him. Meanwhile Charlie, having been mysteriously locked in the car, starts crying over his father's death.|$|E

3000|$|... (2) As most of {{the wave}} {{propagation}} was in the north-east direction, {{it is possible that}} for few months each year the direction is reversed and waves may propagate in other directions (south-west). Thus, in order to obtain a lucid understanding of the gravity wave propagation throughout the year, we need a larger data base. It is important to have a large number of measurements of gravity waves spanning different months at the observation site, Allahabad, to confirm the findings of the current wave filter theory. This would enable the apparent change in the drift speed directions to be studied for both the summer and winter period. In future studies, it may also be possible to study the signature of gravity wave simultaneously in OI 557.7 -nm emissions (∼ 97 km). The OI data can provide support and evidence for wave filtering by winds. Sun et al. (2007) recently studied the filter effects of <b>the</b> background <b>winds</b> on <b>the</b> propagation of gravity waves using a 3 D transfer function model. They concluded that the gravity waves travel easily in the anti-windward direction, primarily because the propagation distance of gravity wave packets along <b>the</b> <b>winds</b> is longer than that <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>winds.</b> This leads to a higher energy loss when gravity waves are propagating along <b>the</b> <b>winds</b> than <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>winds</b> in <b>the</b> same altitude range. The results showed that <b>the</b> atmospheric <b>winds</b> may act as a directional filter that would permit gravity wave packets propagating <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>winds</b> to reach evene ionospheric height with a minimum energy loss and minimum travel time. Therefore, with directional filtering by <b>the</b> <b>winds,</b> <b>the</b> action of the atmospheric processes seems to favor those gravity wave packets that take the minimum time to reach the ionosphere. Other components of gravity waves are also filtered by the viscosity and thermal conduction of the atmosphere as well as by <b>the</b> background <b>winds</b> when <b>the</b> gravity waves propagate upward to higher altitudes.|$|R
