40|$|Interleukin (IL) - 10 is a {{pluripotent}} cytokine with {{effects on}} numerous cell populations, in particular circulating and resident immune cells {{as well as}} epithelial cells. With its potent immunoregulatory capacities, its main biological function {{seems to be the}} limitation and termination of inflammatory responses. Hence, its low level expression found in psoriasis may have pathophysiological relevance to this immune disease. Remarkably, the induction of IL- 10 expression was found by conventional <b>antipsoriatic</b> therapies, supporting the hypothesis that it may be a key cytokine in psoriasis. Furthermore, the first use in clinical trials in patients with established psoriasis showed that it had moderate <b>antipsoriatic</b> effects and was well tolerated. Moreover, long-term application in psoriatic patients in remission showed that it decreases the incidence of relapse and prolongs the disease free interval. The IL- 10 <b>antipsoriatic</b> activity is suggested to be due to the effects on different cell populations, including antigen presenting cells and T-cells (type 1 / type 2 balance shift), but not through direct effects on keratinocytes. In conclusion, IL- 10 seems to have major clinical and therapeutic implications in psoriasis. Further multicenter, placebo-controlled, double blind trials are required to be an established <b>antipsoriatic</b> therapy.

40|$|Introduction: Psoriasis is a chronic, {{inflammatory}} {{skin disorder}} affecting about 1 - 3 % of general population. Currently available treatment modalities enable to achieve remission of psoriasis, however, the complete cure {{of this disease}} is still not possible. Objective: The aim {{of the study was}} the assessment of patient satisfaction from current <b>antipsoriatic</b> therapy and an attempt to characterise parameters, that would enable to define high-need patients. Material and methods: A total of 210 patients suffering from psoriasis aged between 18 and 86 years (mean: 47. 9 &# 177; 15. 2 years) were recruited. A specially designed questionnaire with questions about clinical manifestation of psoriasis, currently applied treatment, and patient satisfaction and preferences regarding the <b>antipsoriatic</b> therapy was completed based on anamnesis and physical examination. All results were analysed statistically. Results: The mean severity of psoriasis according to PASI was 13. 0 &# 177; 8. 9 points (range 1 - 58 points), and the mean body surface area affected by psoriasis was 28. 2 &# 177; 19. 7 % (range 2 - 99 %). Among all included subjects, 85 (40. 5 %) patients were not satisfied with the current <b>antipsoriatic</b> treatment. Subjects with joint involvement (57. 9 % vs. 36. 6 %, p= 0. 03), scalp psoriasis (45. 6 % vs. 28. 6 %, p= 0. 03) and treated with coal tar products (62. 5 % vs. 35. 3 %, p&#x 003 C; 0. 01), anthralin (50 % vs. 23 %, p&#x 003 C; 0. 001), or methotrexate (57. 9 % vs. 36. 6 %, p= 0. 03) were more commonly dissatisfied with the <b>antipsoriatic</b> therapy. Dissatisfied patients also suffered from more severe (PASI: 15. 9 &# 177; 9. 5 points vs. 11. 1 &# 177; 7. 9 points, p&#x 003 C; 0. 001) and more extensive psoriasis (BSA: 32. 9 &# 177; 20. 9 % vs. 25. 0 &# 177; 18. 2 %, p&#x 003 C; 0. 001) and had more severely impaired quality of life (DLQI: 13. 3 &# 177; 5. 3 points vs. 9. 4 &# 177; 6. 2 points, p&#x 003 C; 0. 001). Conclusions: Many Polish patients suffering from psoriasis are dissatisfied with the applied <b>antipsoriatic</b> treatment. It could be supposed, that better accessibility of Polish patients to the newest <b>antipsoriatic</b> therapies would improve the degree of patient satisfaction with the treatment of psoriasis...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} cost {{effectiveness}} of tapered versus abrupt discontinuation of a microemulsion formulation of cyclosporin {{in patients with}} chronic plaque psoriasis. Methods: A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed in parallel with a nonblind, multicentre, international clinical trial of the safety and efficacy of intermittent short courses of cyclosporin. Direct and indirect costs were considered within a 1 -year period following randomisation. Patients: Patients with chronic plaque psoriasis inadequately controlled with topical treatment. Study perspective: The study was conducted from a societal perspective and was performed using data from Canada, Spain, Turkey and the UK. Main outcomes measures: The health outcome used was {{the total number of}} systemic therapy-free days (STFDs) over the first year. The mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was determined by dividing the differences in average cost per patient by the differences in average STFDs per patient. Results: The overall ICER was dominant because tapered discontinuation was associated with both lower costs and improved efficacy in comparison with abrupt discontinuation. Further analyses showed that tapered discontinuation was a cost-effective alternative to abrupt discontinuation therapy, even when a conservative definition for cost effectiveness was adopted. Conclusion: This cost-effectiveness analysis demonstrated that tapering cyclosporin was more cost effective than abruptly stopping cyclosporin in patients with chronic plaque psoriasis. <b>Antipsoriatics,</b> Cost effectiveness, Cyclosporin modified, Drug withdrawal, Pharmacoeconomics, Psoriasis...|$|R

40|$|Background: Conventional <b>antipsoriatic</b> therapies {{are often}} {{administered}} until remission, with treatment resumed {{in the case}} of relapse, {{in order to reduce the}} likelihood of cumulative, dose-dependent toxicities. Biological agents have been safely used in continuous therapy. Objective: To assess the use of etanercept for psoriasis in clinical practice in Italy. Methods: This was an observational study carried out in 13 dermatological centres across Italy in patients with plaque psoriasis (with a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index [PASI] score ≥ 10) treated with etanercept. The study comprised a treatment and subsequent discontinuation period. Patients were eligible if they had plaque psoriasis and had begun treatment with etanercept between 1 September 2007 and 1 April 2008. Patients were evaluable for the duration of discontinuation analysis if they achieved a PASI reduction ≥ 50 % (PASI 50) and a PASI score < 10 at the end of treatment. Etanercept treatment was restarted if the PASI score reached ≥ 10 or the patient had a clinical relapse. Data were collected retrospectively up to June 2008 and prospectively between July 2008 and January 2009. Patients received etanercept during the treatment period, followed by no etanercept treatment (other psoriasis treatment permitted) during the discontinuation period, and etanercept again during re-treatment. The main outcome measures were: PASI scores (type A responders: PASI reduction ≥ 75 % [PASI 75]; type B responders: PASI 50 and PASI final score < 10), Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) scores and body surface area (BSA) involvement. Time from discontinuation to retreatment was evaluated. Use of other <b>antipsoriatic</b> medications was recorded throughout. Results: Eighty-five patients were evaluable for the treatment period. Overall, 55 (64. 7 %) of these patients were prescribed etanercept 50 mg twice weekly. The mean treatment duration was approximately 25 weeks. In total, 79 patients (92. 9 %) were considered type B responders and 77 of these patients were evaluable for the duration of discontinuation analysis. Overall, 68 / 85 (80 %) were type A responders. During the treatment period, 7 / 85 (8. 2 %) patients received other <b>antipsoriatic</b> therapies. Improvements in mean DLQI score (- 71. 5 %) and mean BSA involvement (- 79. 2 %) were also observed. Etanercept was well tolerated. During the discontinuation period, 40 / 77 (51. 9 %) patients used other <b>antipsoriatic</b> medications (group 1) and 37 / 77 (48. 1 %) did not (group 2). The mean duration of discontinuation was significantly longer in group 1 (174 days) than in group 2 (117 days, log-rank test: p = 0. 0013). Conclusion: In clinical practice, the duration of discontinuation from etanercept was in accordance with previously reported data, and was longer in patients who received other <b>antipsoriatic</b> drugs during discontinuation of etanercept than in those who did not. High rates of PASI 50 and PASI 75 response were obtained with etanercept, and these rates were higher than those observed in controlled clinical studies. Etanercept treatment was flexible, effective and well tolerated, and was associated with improved quality of life. © 2010 Adis Data Information BV. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Psoriasis is a common, chronic {{inflammatory}} {{skin disease}} which, {{in a number}} of patients, leads to decrease of quality of life, stigmatization and suffering. According to current guidelines psoriasis of mild severity should be treated with topical agents, while in severe cases the local therapy should be supplemented by phototherapy or one of systemic drugs. Despite of the huge progress, which has been observed within the last years in the treatment of psoriasis, an efficacious, safe and acceptable <b>antipsoriatic</b> therapy still remains a challenge. One of the recent novelties within the topical <b>antipsoriatic</b> therapies is a fixed combination of betamethasone dipropionate with calcipotriol in a lipophilic gel.

We now report the inhibitory effect of dimethylfumarate on tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha- or interleukin- 1 alpha -induced intercellular adhesion molecule 1 expression in normal human dermal fibroblasts. Western blots of normal human dermal fibroblast cytoplasmic extracts showed that dimethylfumarate has minor effects on the I kappaB alpha, beta and epsilon proteins: their cytokine-induced degradation and resynthesis is only slowed down, an effect most prominently observed for I kappaB beta. No inhibitory effect of dimethylfumarate was observed on cytokine-induced RelA/p 65 or c-Rel accumulation in nuclear extracts of cytokine-treated normal human dermal fibroblast cells. In contrast, cytokine-induced nuclear factor beta B 1 /p 50 nuclear accumulation was specifically inhibited by dimethylfumarate. This inhibitory effect on nuclear factor kappa B 1 nuclear localization in normal human dermal fibroblasts proved sufficient to inhibit nuclear factor kappa B 1 -RelA binding to nuclear factor kappaB consensus oligonucleotides in DNA binding assays.

40|$|The antidyslipidemic drug {{nicotinic acid}} and the <b>antipsoriatic</b> drug monomethyl fumarate induce {{cutaneous}} flushing through activation of G protein-coupled receptor 109 A (GPR 109 A). Flushing is a troublesome {{side effect of}} nicotinic acid, but may be a direct reflection of the wanted effects of monomethyl fumarate. Here we analyzed the mechanisms underlying GPR 109 A-mediated flushing and show that both Langerhans cells and keratinocytes express GPR 109 A in mice. Using cell ablation approaches and transgenic cell type-specific GPR 109 A expression in Gpr 109 a-/- mice, we have provided evidence that the early phase of flushing depends on GPR 109 A expressed on Langerhans cells, whereas the late phase is mediated by GPR 109 A expressed on keratinocytes.

Both monomethyl fumarate and nicotinic acid induced PGE 2 formation in isolated keratinocytes through activation of GPR 109 A and COX- 2. Thus, the early and late phases of the GPR 109 A-mediated cutaneous flushing reaction involve different epidermal cell types and prostanoid-forming enzymes.

We found a relative deficiency in cutaneous IL- 10 mRNA expression compared with other inflammatory dermatoses. Interestingly, patients during established <b>antipsoriatic</b> therapy showed higher IL- 10 mRNA expression of peripheral blood mononuclear cells than patients before therapy. This suggested that IL- 10 may have <b>antipsoriatic</b> capacity. Therefore, we performed a phase 2 pilot trial with subcutaneous IL- 10 administration (8 microg/kg/d) over 24 d in three patients. Clinical efficiency measured by objective and subjective parameters was found.

Results: (i) Psoriasis severity was higher in CMV-seropositive patients and positively correlated to the severity of CMV-antigenaemia. (ii) In comparison to CMV-seropositive healthy controls, CMV-seropositive psoriasis patients showed a reduced frequency of circulating CMV-specific T cells that increased under effective <b>antipsoriatic</b> therapy. (iii) The immunophenotype of peripheral CD 8 + T cells was dominated by CMV-seroprevalence.

Patients were treated once daily (6 days/week) for 4 weeks with Cal/BD foam, Cal/BD ointment, BD foam and Cal/BD foam ve-hicle, randomized to four plaque test sites (5 cm 2 each). The primary efficacy endpoint was change in total clinica...|$|E
40|$|The autoxidn. of 9 -anthrone (I) [90 - 44 - 8] in the {{presence}} of excess cysteine Et ester [3411 - 58 - 3] was investigated. In addn. to the corresponding 9, 10 -anthraquinone [84 - 65 - 1], an ether-insol. adduct was formed which was shown by spectral anal. to be II [93929 - 10 - 3]. The possibility that anthralin (III) [1143 - 38 - 0] may undergo an analogous reaction to form 1, 8 -dihydroxy- 10 -(2 -amino- 2 -carboxethylthio) - 9 -anthrone (IV) is discussed; synthesis of the IV-HCl salt [93956 - 73 - 1] is given. The relation of these results to the <b>antipsoriatic</b> activity of III is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Because the {{immunosuppressant}} rapamycin (sirolimus) blocks T {{cell proliferation}} in G 1 phase, {{it has been}} proposed as a potential treatment for psoriasis, a skin disease charac-terized by T cell activation and keratinocyte stem cell hy-perproliferation. To determine another potentially impor-tant mechanism through which rapamycin can act as an <b>antipsoriatic</b> agent, we tested its direct effect on keratino-cyte stem cell proliferation in vitro {{as well as in}} vivo. In vivo cell cycle quiescent (G 0 phase) stem cell keratinocytes in pri-mary culture sequentially express de novo cyclin D 1 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), prior to S phase entry, and upregulate b 1 integrin. Rapamycin inhibited the growth of keratinocytes that were leaving quiescence as well as those already in cell cycle without affecting cell viability...|$|E
40|$|Linear {{psoriasis}} {{is a rare}} form {{of disease}} which {{is very difficult to}} differentiate from inflammatory linear verrucous epidermal nevus. Sometimes clinical history, physical examination and histopathology analysis may not be sufficient to confirm the diagnosis. We report a case of 25 year-old male presented with a linear plaque covered with silvery scales on left upper extremity extending from tip of the index to mid forearm for last 2 years. A skin biopsy was consistent with psoriasis, and the unilateral distribution in a linear pattern led to a diagnosis of linear psoriasis, which is a rare variant of psoriasis. Although histopathologically {{it can be difficult to}} distinguish from inflammatory linear verrucous epidermal nevus (ILVEN), linear psoriasis presents in adulthood and responds to conventional topical <b>antipsoriatic</b> therapies...|$|E
40|$|Coal tar {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} and an {{effective}} treatment for psoriasis. Coal tar has been directly applied to the skin, or used in combination with UV light as part of the Goeckerman treatment. The use of coal tar has caused long-term remissions in psoriasis, but has fallen out of favor because the treatment requires hospitalization and coal tar is poorly acceptable aesthetically to patients. Thus, determining the active <b>antipsoriatic</b> component of coal tar is of considerable therapeutic interest. We fractionated coal tar into its components, and tested them using the SVR angiogenesis inhibitor assay. Treatment of SVR endothelial cells with coal tar fractions resulted in the isolation of a single fraction with antiangiogenic activity. The active antiangiogenic compound in coal tar is carbazole. In addition to antiangiogenic activity, carbazole inhibited the production of inflammatory IL- 15 by human mononuclear cells. IL- 15 is elevated in psoriasis and is thought to contribute to psoriatic inflammation. Carbazole treatment also reduced activity of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), which is proinflammatory and elevated in psoriasis. The effect of carbazole on upstream pathways in human psoriasis was determined, and carbazole was shown to inhibit signal transducer and activator of transcription (stat) 3 -mediated transcription, which has been shown to be relevant in human psoriasis. IL- 15, iNOS, and stat 3 activation require the activation of the small GTPase rac for optimal activity. Carbazole was found to inhibit rac activation as a mechanism for its inhibition of downstream inflammatory and angiogenic pathways. Given its antiangiogenic and anti-inflammatory activities, carbazole is likely a major component of the <b>antipsoriatic</b> activity of coal tar. Carbazole and derivatives may be useful in the therapy of human psoriasis...|$|E
