40|$|We are {{developing}} field-portable instruments and disposable fluid cartridges that enable the rapid and quantitative analysis of target bacteria or viruses in complex mixtures. Up to many milliliters of raw sample are processed automatically in <b>a</b> <b>flow-through</b> <b>manner,</b> and processing functions are sequentially effected. These include specimen dilution, coarse filtration, target microbe extraction/separation, microbe lysis {{with or without}} chemicals and/or heat, neutralization, DNA/RNA purification and concentration, PCR reagent mixing, and PCR or RT-PCR. As part {{of the development of}} this system, we have designed and tested a silicon-based fluidic chip that extracts DNA from 500 uL of fluid and dilutes into 25 - 50 uL at greater than 50 % efficiency and resulting in a 10 - to 20 -fold increase in concentration. This operation can be completed in several minutes. We have also designed, built, and tested complex fluidic cartridges with large specimen volume capacity, integral waste regions, filters, heaters, integrated DNA chips, fluid divertors, and PCR reaction tube filling. Rapid PCR modules, capable of 7 - 10 °C/sec and 2 - 5 °C/sec heating and cooling, respectively for 100 uL reaction volumes and 2 or 4 -color real-time fluorescence detection suitable for Taqman, Molecular Beacons, and other homogeneous chemistry systems, have been built and demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|This work {{describes}} {{the design and}} application of an apparatus to image aerosolparticles using digital holography in <b>a</b> <b>flow-through,</b> contact-free <b>manner.</b> Particles in an aerosol stream are illuminated by a triggered, pulsed laser and the pattern produced by the interference of this light with that scattered by the particles is recorded by a digital camera. The recorded pattern constitutes a digital hologram from which {{an image of the}} particles is computationally reconstructed using a fast Fourier transform. This imaging is validated using a cluster of ragweed pollen particles. Examples involving mineral-dust aerosols demonstrate the technique’s in situ imaging capability for complex-shaped particles over a size range of roughly 15 – 500 μm micrometers. The focusing-like character of the reconstruction process is demonstrated using a NaCl aerosol particle and is compared to a similar particle imaged with a conventional microscope...|$|R
40|$|Cell {{proliferation}} and migration are fundamental processes in determining cell and tissue behaviour. In {{this study we}} show the design and fabrication of a new single cell microfluidic structure, called a “vertically integrated array” or “VIA” trap to explore quantitative functional assays including single cell attachment, {{proliferation and}} migration studies. The chip {{can be used in}} <b>a</b> continuous (<b>flow-through)</b> <b>manner,</b> with <b>a</b> continuous supply of new media, as well as in a quiescent mode. We show the fabrication of the device, together with the flow characteristics inside the network of channels and the single cell traps. The flow patterns inside the device not only facilitate cell trapping, but also protect the cells from mechanical flow-induced stress. MDA-MB- 231 human breast cancer cells were used to study attachment and detachment during the cell cycle as well as explore the influences of the chemokine SDF- 1 (enabling the quantification of the role of chemokine gradients both on pseudopod formation and directional cell migration) ...|$|R

40|$|A new solvent/polymeric multiion-selective {{membrane}} electrode {{is described}} {{for use as}} <b>a</b> <b>flow-through</b> detector in ion chromatography.

This membrane is cast on solid electrode surfaces, with no internal electrolyte solution, to form solid-state multiion sensors.
