A Hurricane Relief Fund was established to coordinate financial donations, ultimately raising about $5.3million (CAD). The fund received donations from organisations, companies, and individuals including Pope Pius XII, the Ford Motor Company of Canada, the United Church of Canada, Laura Secord Candy Shops, and the British-American Oil Company.
