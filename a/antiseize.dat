25|$|A foundry facing mold wash is a {{water-based}} paint of amorphous or fine flake graphite. Painting {{the inside of}} a mold with it and letting it dry leaves a fine graphite coat that will ease separation of the object cast after the hot metal has cooled. Graphite lubricants are specialty items for use at very high or very low temperatures, as forging die lubricant, an <b>antiseize</b> agent, a gear lubricant for mining machinery, and to lubricate locks. Having low-grit graphite, or even better no-grit graphite (ultra high purity), is highly desirable. It {{can be used as a}} dry powder, in water or oil, or as colloidal graphite (a permanent suspension in a liquid). An estimate based on USGS graphite consumption statistics indicates that 2,200 tonnes was used in this fashion in 2005.|$|E
50|$|Special <b>antiseize</b> {{lubricant}} mixtures are available, and {{are applied}} to metallic threads and other precision machined surfaces {{to protect them from}} rust. These compounds usually contain grease mixed with copper, zinc, or aluminium powder, and other proprietary ingredients.|$|E

40|$|Reliable service {{lubrication}} of compressors with polyolesters that do {{not contain}} additives is the optimal goal for hermetic compressor use. Chlorine derived from CFC and HCFC refrigerants {{is reported to have}} effective antiwear properties and negates the widespread use of additives in mineral oil lubricated systems. The use of antioxidants for mineral oil and polyolesters have been reported; antioxidant additive activity seems essential for polyolesters. - Antiwear and <b>antiseize</b> additives seem to be a short term goal for use with polyolesters. High silicone aluminum to steel wear seems to be a primary target for additive use. The interaction of specific heteroatom organic compounds with highly polar surface active synthetic polyolester lubricants is complex. Results of an extensive literature search describe results from a service base determined at ambient conditions. Known lubricant additives used in the hermetic compressor industry, the. mode of action of several types of additives and some lubricant additive chemistry that demonstrates selective thermal stability in conjunction with the chemical structure are examined...|$|E
