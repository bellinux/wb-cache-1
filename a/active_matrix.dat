40|$|In {{the second}} part of this three-paper series, the design and the {{fabrication}} of monolithic <b>active</b> <b>matrices</b> for addressing metallized viscoelastic light-valve control layers are described together with the required external electronics. The <b>active</b> <b>matrices</b> were fabricated by means of standard silicon CMOS technology. Special matrix features are signal-handling capabilities of 30 V, optimized surface planarity and extremely low light sensitivity. The on-chip addressing circuitry exceeds HDTV speed requirements. Three identical matrix samples coated with metallized viscoelastic control layers were successfully demonstrated as spatial light modulators for the read-out light from a xenon are lamp in a full-colour schlieren-optical dark-field projection system.

40|$|This article first {{provides}} {{empirical evidence}} from the 100 -million-word British National corpus in support of earlier less well documented observations that infinitival copular complements occur much more often with passive matrix clauses (e. g. Towns {{were thought to be}} organic or haphazard creations until recently) than with <b>active</b> <b>matrices</b> (e. g. One might even have though him to be angry), and then addresses the pending question of why this should be so. A previous explanation has invoked the different word order of the passive construction versus that shared by the active construction and finite complements, combined with the purported markedness of nonfinite constructions. The alternative explanation presented here is {{based on the fact that}} though finite complements and infinitives with <b>active</b> <b>matrices</b> share the same word order, their typical information structure is different, in that the subjects of the former can introduce "new" referents, while "givenness" seems almost a necessary condition for the subjects of the latter. It is claimed that the typical information structure of <b>active</b> <b>matrices</b> plus infinitives makes the construction a dispreferred one, because it leads to redundancy in referential continuity and causes conflicts between candidates for sentence topic/theme status, disrupting the thematic progression of the text. © Walter de Gruyter. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Light-valve {{projection}} offers {{high resolution}} with large image areas and high brightness, and it thus {{appears to be}} most suitable for HDTV displays. The increasing availability of active-matrix-addressed liquid-crystal light-valve projectors for standard television, and the continuing dominance of 'classical' electron-beam-addressed light-valve projectors for the most demanding professional applications, are the starting points of a survey {{on the state of}} the art. After the two groups of light-valve projectors have been briefly reviewed, the major light-valve technologies are explained in some detail. Transmissive and reflective liquid-crystal light valves with various types of addressing are described first; the trend toward active-matrix addressing and high resolution is demonstrated. Commercial light-valve projectors with electrooptic and oil-film control layers are briefly introduced, and alternative technologies, such as metallized viscoelastic layers, deformable micromechanical mirrors, and polymer-encapsulated liquid crystals, are discussed. The author's research on deformable viscoelastic light-valve control layers for use in schlieren optical systems and on Si-MOSFET <b>active</b> <b>matrices</b> for addressing these is reported in some detail.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Active</b> <b>matrices</b> often {{related with}} high grade display devices, due to {{application}} of the storage elements, typically thin film transistor (TFT). Because of the complex procedures in the manufacturing TFT, investment of the high value manufacturing equipments and clarification plants is necessary, hence increasing the manufacturing cost of the flat panel, and more importantly, causing the pollution of water and air. As the contribution of TFT array merely exists in supplying storage function for the pixels of the display panel, large efforts {{have been made to}} find suitable cells that have bistable effect, so as to substitute the effect of TFT. As the bistable cell is just the storage pixel, one could construct a bistable cell to skip the needs of TFT <b>active</b> <b>matrices.</b> The paper is to introduce currently available bistable display devices in the following field: liquid crystal bistable displays with cholesteric liquid crystals, which is an example to introduce the bistable technology; iMod display devices based on mechanic induced bistable and light interference, which shows the possibility to construct bistable display; and the display based on solid powder movement in air or in vacuum, so called liquid powder displays, which shows how to improve the existed display...|$|R

40|$|An {{efficient}} method-of-moments (MoM) based {{domain decomposition}} technique, viz., the domain Green's function method (DGFM), is presented for analyzing large antenna arrays. The DGFM is a perturbation technique where mutual coupling between array elements is accounted for during {{the formulation of}} an <b>active</b> impedance <b>matrix</b> for each domain/array element. The active current distribution on the entire array geometry is obtained by solving the smaller matrix equations related to the elements, and not that of the problem as a whole. This leads to a significant saving in both runtime and memory usage. The method also {{takes into account the}} edge effects attributed to the finite size of the array, complex excitations with nonlinear phase shift and is not limited to periodic array configurations. The DGFM is an approximation and assumes a slowly varying current distribution between domains. A novel way to mitigate the aforementioned, by including secondary coupling effects, is also discussed. Furthermore, an efficient <b>active</b> impedance <b>matrix</b> fill strategy is presented where the <b>active</b> impedance <b>matrix</b> summation is truncated to include only a certain number of terms.
