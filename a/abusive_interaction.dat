40|$|Objective: The {{purpose was}} to explore the effects of victim and {{perpetrator}} gender, type of abuse, and victim-perpetrator relationship on university students’ and non-students’ perceptions {{of different kinds of}} child abuse. Method: One hundred and ninety-nine participants (including university students and non-student adults) evaluated each of 24 vignettes (within-subjects design) describing an <b>abusive</b> <b>interaction</b> between a child and an adult. The following four variables were manipulated: the victim’s gender, the perpetrator’s gender, the type of abuse (physical, relatively mild sexual, or relatively severe sexual), and the perpetrator’s relationship to the victim (parent or babysitter). Participants rated each vignette on a number of dimensions: degree of trauma and severity, likelihood of general occurrence and reoccurrence, victim believability, and “repressibility” of the event. Results: Significant interactions emerged on each dimension. For example, sexual abuse (whether mild or severe) was rated as being more traumatic and severe if perpetrated by a parent, but relationship type did not affect perceptions of physical abuse. In addition, significant perpetrator gender by victim gender interactions indicated that homosexual abuse was perceived as more traumatic and repressible than heterosexual abuse, but as less likely to occur; and male participants tended to be more affected by the gender of the perpetrator and abuse type than female participants. Conclusion: The results suggest that people have stereotypes about the circumstances and consequences of child abuse. These stereotypes are often, though not always, consistent with existing empirical findings...|$|E

While the reader is left to make sense of why the father acts like a raging alcoholic, at a simple level this character does not know how to relate to his estranged son in any sort of healthy, normal way, so he fills the void with <b>abusive</b> <b>interactions</b> with waitstaff, to the mild horror of his son.|$|R
40|$|The {{adolescent}} at risk `or suicidal preoccupation {{and behavior}} {{has become an}} increasing concern for schools and communities. This paper presents some {{of the causes of}} teen suicide, things adults should know about adolescent suicide prevention, {{and what can be done}} to help such youth. The transition to adolescence is a complex time when many values may be questioned. Family dysfunctions, such as poor communication skills, resistance to grieving, difficulties with single parenting, and <b>abusive</b> <b>interactions</b> can further confuse this already difficult period. Likewise, environmental pressures, such as academic achievement, constant mobility and the availability of drugs, can lead to depression and the inability to cope with stress. It is emphasized that knowledge is the most effective tool in preventing suicide. Adults should be aware of the myths associated with suicides, such a...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} relationships among partners' relationship commitment, positive and anxious forms of emotional arousal prior to {{engaging in a}} discussion of a conflictual relationship issue, and subsequent communication behavior, in a sample of clinical couples who had experienced psychologically and mild to moderate physically <b>abusive</b> <b>interactions.</b> A secondary analysis was conducted with data from 68 couples who had sought therapy for relationship problems. Results indicated that men and women with higher commitment experienced less anxious arousal and more positive emotional arousal prior to engaging in problem-solving. Greater commitment in men was associated with more constructive communication behaviors, and women with higher levels of anxiety engaged in more negative communication. Men's positive emotional arousal was associated with more positive communication behavior and less negative communication behavior. Men's positive emotional arousal mediated between commitment and constructive communication behaviors; however, anxious emotional arousal did not. Implications for couple therapy are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This {{bulletin}} {{describes how}} parenting patterns are learned {{and how the}} Nurturing Parenting Programs, a group- and home-based intervention effort begun {{with the support of}} the National Institute of Mental Health, help stop generational cycles of abuse and neglect by building nurturing parenting skills. Section 1 examines the need for effective intervention. Section 2 discusses how parenting patterns are learned (process and product, abusive and nurturing parent continuum, parent experiences, and behavior and self-image). Section 3 examines abusive parenting and childrearing (e. g., inappropriate parental expectations of children, lack of empathy toward children's needs, and belief in the value of physical punishment). Section 4 discusses theoretical assumptions of the Nurturing Parenting Programs (the family is a system, empathy is the most desirable quality in nurturing parents, parenting exists on a continuum, and no one truly prefers <b>abusive</b> <b>interactions).</b> Section 5 examines program objectives, including: stopping the intergenerational cycle of abuse by buildin...|$|R
40|$|According to {{a recent}} study by the Pew Research Center, 60 % of {{participants}} of a survey said they have witnessed online abuse, and 66 % of that abuse occurred via social media. This study looks at online communication, and tests if anonymity increases the amount of abuse that occurs during online communication. A quasi-experiment was developed to look for uncivil discourse using a conversational intelligent agent to create a controlled, repeatable conversational environment. The interactions with the agent occur in two settings: one in public at a kiosk, and a second in private. The researcher hypothesized that the interactions that occur in private would be more <b>abusive</b> than the <b>interactions</b> that occurred in private, due to the anonymity of the conversations. Several thousand interactions were recorded in the two scenarios, and analysis was performed on the conversational data. A custom search engine used a data set of known abuse keywords to flag each conversation as abusive or not abusive. Using this abusive conversation count, a chi-square test of independence was used to determine that the number of <b>abusive</b> <b>interactions</b> with the agent was statistically higher in the private scenario compared to the public scenario. This finding supported the researcher’s hypothesis, showing that users were almost twice as likely to use abusive keywords when interacting with the agent in a private setting...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis article {{contributes}} to sociological debates about {{trends in the}} power and status of medical professionals, focussing on claims that deferent patient relations are giving way to a more challenging consumerism. Analysing data from a mixed methods study involving general practitioners in England, we found some support for the idea that an apparent ‘golden age’ of patient deference is receding. Although not necessarily expressing nostalgia for such doctor-patient relationships, most GPs described experiencing disruptive or verbally <b>abusive</b> <b>interactions</b> at least occasionally and suggested that these were becoming more common. Younger doctors tended to rate patients as less respectful than their older colleagues but {{were also more likely}} to be egalitarian in attitude. Our data suggest that GPs, especially younger ones, tend towards a more informal yet limited engagement with their patients and with the communities in which they work. These new relations might be a basis for mutual respect between professionals and patients in the consulting room, but may also generate uncertainty and misunderstanding. Such shifts are understood through an Eliasian framework as the functional-democratisation of patient-doctor relations via civilising processes, but with this shift existing alongside decivilising tendencies involving growing social distance across broader social figurations...|$|R
5000|$|Sports {{communication}} varies vastly {{between individual}} sports and {{plays an important}} role in the success of teams and organizations. A good example of sports communication and its effects on players, organizations and media was the well-documented conflict involving two players for the Miami Dolphins. Inappropriate, discriminatory, and <b>abusive</b> <b>interactions</b> between Richie Incognito and Jonathan Martin lead to the release of Richie from the team, organizational issues, and an abundance of media coverage both negative and positive. Another example of sport communication is the recent [...] "deflategate" [...] scandal involving the New England Patriots apparently deflating the footballs during half-time of the AFC Championship game against the Indianapolis Colts. Head coach Bill Belichick claims that any wrongdoing was done by the teams equipment manager and ball boy, and no communication had occurred between them two at any point in the game. This reflects sports communication because it is an example of a lack of communication between an inferior member of an organization and the head coach, which eventually led to a wide spread and highly publicized scandal which could've jeopardized the Patriots participation in the Super Bowl.|$|R
5000|$|Bullying is <b>abusive</b> social <b>interaction</b> between peers {{which can}} include aggression, harassment, and violence. Bullying is {{typically}} repetitive and enacted {{by those who}} are in a position of power over the victim. A growing body of research illustrates a significant relationship between bullying and emotional intelligence (EI). Mayer et al., (2008) defines the dimensions of overall EI as: [...] "accurately perceiving emotion, using emotions to facilitate thought, understanding emotion, and managing emotion". The concept combines emotional and intellectual processes. Lower emotional intelligence appears to be related to involvement in bullying, as the bully and/or the victim of bullying. EI seems {{to play an important role}} in both bullying behavior and victimization in bullying; given that EI is illustrated to be malleable, EI education could greatly improve bullying prevention and intervention initiatives.|$|R
40|$|The study {{proposed}} to distinguish differences in perpetrators of Intimate Partner Violence (i. e., Common Couple Violence and Patriarchal Terrorism) {{due to the}} mediating effect of their presentations of narcissism (covert and overt). Distinguishing perpetrators of Intimate Partner Violence by their narcissistic presentations should assist clinicians in batterer treatment programs to create specific lessons/interventions for perpetrators of Intimate Partner Violence based on their narcissistic quality. The study of a cross-section of men in a Batterer Intervention Program included measures on self-perception, views of partner, and history of violent, aggressive, controlling, and psychologically <b>abusive</b> <b>interactions</b> with their partner. Structural Equation Modeling with Analysis of Moment Structures {{was used to determine}} the structure and function of narcissism and interpersonal violence. Intimate Partner Violence was distinguishable as Common Couple Violence or Patriarchal Terrorism, but the results were not sufficiently conclusive to warrant an absolute classification system. Overt Narcissism was somewhat useful in distinguishing Patriarchal Terrorism from Common Couple Violence by mediating the effects of violent behaviors, controlling behaviors, and psychological abuse when mediated by type of narcissism. That information is useful for clinicians interested in creating targeted interventions to participants in Batterer Intervention Programs to reduce Intimate Partner Violence and violent recidivism. Specifically, Common Couple Violence was described by the number of times the participant physically injured the partner over the past year, the total number of conflict tactics used, and whether their partner needed medical attention following physical injury. Patriarchal Terrorism was described by psychological abuse and controlling behaviors. Overt Narcissism increased Patriarchal Terrorism, whereas, Covert Narcissism did not assist in distinguishing Common Couple Violence from Patriarchal Terrorism. The mediating effect that Covert Narcissism had on violent behaviors, controlling behaviors, and psychological abuse was weak. Overt Narcissism is a more useful construct when identifying potential Patriarchal Terrorists, while Covert Narcissism was not found to provide additional detail to either Patriarchal Terrorism or Common Couple Violence. Knowing the differing and similar impacts of those constructs can potentially grant greater clinical effectiveness with perpetrators of Intimate Partner Violence...|$|R

40|$|Drawing on the {{conservation}} of resources theory, the relations between abusive supervision and emotional exhaustion and intent to leave were examined, {{as well as the}} gender differences in these relations. Moreover, the moderating effect of self-esteem was tested in an integrated model stipulating that the gender-moderating effect was mediated by the <b>abusive</b> supervision[*]×[*]self-esteem <b>interaction.</b> Data were collected from 264 employees (111 men; M age[*]=[*] 32. 0 years; M tenure[*]=[*] 9. 2 years). Results of regression analyses indicated that abusive supervision was positively correlated to emotional exhaustion and intent to leave. Women reported higher emotional exhaustion and intent to leave than men. The relations of interest were stronger among employees with higher self-esteem (emotional exhaustion: β[*]=[*] 0. 44; intent to leave: β[*]=[*] 0. 53). The <b>interaction</b> of <b>abusive</b> supervision[*]×[*]self-esteem mediated the gender-moderating effect. Women 2 ̆ 7 s stronger responses to abusive supervision may be related to their higher self-esteem, possibly because of the importance of employment to Chinese women...|$|R

40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} of the University of Wolverhampton for the award of Practitioner Doctorate Degree in Counselling PsychologyThe literature review revealed co-morbidity between adverse childhood experiences, adult psychopathology and alcohol dependence, although causality was questionable due to multiple variables. The current study used 54 clients at the acute end of the spectrum of severe alcohol dependence from a specialist tertiary substance misuse service (clients) and a control group of 54 non-problematic drinkers from an NHS working population (controls) to examine possible differences in security of attachment and maladaptive schemas and investigated how early relational experiences influenced core beliefs regarding self, others and intimate relationships and therapeutic implications for severely alcohol dependent clients’ engagement in specialist services. The study was divided into two sections: (1) quantitative analysis using Feeney, Noller and Hanrahan’s (1994) Attachment Style Questionnaire to measure attachment style and Young’s Schema Questionnaire (Young & Brown, 2001) to measure maladaptive schemas in the domain of disconnection and rejection and (2) qualitative analysis, using Interpretational Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) to explore eight severely alcohol dependent clients’ subjective experiences of intimate relationships. Clients scored significantly lower in secure attachment style and significantly higher in both avoidant and ambivalent attachment style than controls and suggested overlapping between the two dimensions, known as ‘fearful avoidant’ attachment. Clients scored significantly higher than controls in all five sub-categories of maladaptive schemas in the domain of disconnection and rejection, namely mistrust/abuse, emotional deprivation, abandonment, social isolation/alienation and defectiveness/shame. IPA revealed common themes of negative parent-child interaction: physical and psychological abuse, neglect and explicit maternal rejection and emotional deprivation and hostile and <b>abusive</b> parent-parent <b>interaction.</b> These aetiological factors influenced fearful avoidant attachment and maladaptive core beliefs. Negation of children’s needs implicated an immaturely developed diffuseness of identity and defective self that inhibited formation of intimate adult relationships. A bio-psychosocial explanation suggested alcohol ameliorated hyper-vigilant anxiety and depression from adverse childhood experiences within a threatening family environment that implicated insecure attachment, maladaptive core beliefs and negative self-identity, inhibiting emotional intimacy. It advocated screening procedures and an integrated CBT and schema-based therapeutic approach for those at the more severe end of the spectrum of alcohol dependence deemed at risk of not engaging or disengaging prematurely from services...|$|R
