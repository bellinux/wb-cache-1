With under construction generation III reactors having a designed for burnup rate in the 60 GWd/tU range and a need to refuel once every 2 years or so. For example, the European Pressurized Reactor has a designed for 65 GWd/t, and the AP1000 has a designed for average discharge burnup of 52.8 GWd/t and a maximum of 59.5 GWd/t.

Up to burn-ups of 70 ¿ 80 GWd/tM the comparison confirmed traditional predictions anticipating the fuels to remain quasi stoichiometric along irradiation. However, recent predictions of a fuel with <b>average</b> <b>burn-up</b> around 100 GWd/tM becoming definitely hypostoichiometric were not confirmed. At average burn-ups around 80 GWd/tM and above, it is shown that the fuels tend to acquire progressively slightly hyperstoichiometric O/M ratios. The maximum derived O/M ratio for an <b>average</b> <b>burn-up</b> of 100 GWd/tM lies around 2. 001 and 2. 002.

40|$|Our {{previous}} studies on water cooled thorium breeder reactor based on matured {{pressurized water reactor}} (PWR) plant technology concluded that reduced moderated core by arranging fuel pins in a triangular tight lattice array and using heavy water as coolant is appropriate for achieving better breeding performance and higher burn-up simultaneously [1 – 6]. One optimum core that produces 3. 5 GW thermal energy using Th- 233 U oxide fuel shows a breeding ratio of 1. 07 and <b>averaged</b> <b>burn-up</b> of about 80 GWd/t with long cycle length of 1300 days. The moderator to fuel volume ratio is 0. 6 and required enrichment of 233 U for the fresh fuel is about 7 %.

In order to introduce this sustainable thorium reactor, three-step deployment scenario, with intermediate transition phase between current light water reactor (LWR) phase and future sustainer phase, is proposed. Both in transition phase and sustainer phase, almost the same core design can be applicable only by changing fissile materials mixed with thorium from plutonium to 233 U with slight modification in the fuel assembly design.

It {{was found that the}} thermal conductivity in the outer region of the fuel was much higher {{than it would have been}} if the high burn-up structure were not present. The increase in thermal conductivity is a consequence of the removal of fission products and radiation defects from the fuel lattice during recrystallisation of the fuel grains (an integral part of the formation process of the high burn-up structure). The gas porosity in the high burn-up structure lowered the increase in thermal conductivity caused by recrystallisation. JRC. E. 2 -Hot cell...|$|R

The iodine and cesium release could be partially explained by the differences in sample preparation, leading to different sizes and properties of the exposed surface areas. Iodine and cesium releases tend to correlate with FGR and linear power rating, but the scatter of the data is significant.

40|$|The low {{temperature}} matrix swelling of UO 2 -fuels was analysed {{as a function}} of burn-up, taking into account changes in the fuel density, porosity and retained Xe-concentration as measured by EPMA. The combined evaluation of these data leads to the conclusion that at average pellet burn-ups ≥ 60 GWd/tM the total matrix swelling rate is gradually reduced from ~ 1 %/ 10 GWd/tM to ~ 0. 3 %/ 10 GWd/tM; the latter value being reached at an <b>average</b> <b>burn-up</b> above 110 GWd/tM. The decrease in the swelling rate is due to the progressive depletion of fission gas in the fuel matrix by thermal and athermal processes, such that at very high burn-up the matrix swelling becomes dominated by the precipitation of solid fission products.

40|$|A new reactor burn-up {{strategy}} CANDLE was proposed, where {{shapes of}} neutron flux, nuclide densities and power density distributions remain constant but move to an axial direction. Here important points {{are that the}} solid fuel is fixed at each position and that any movable burn-up reactivity control mechanisms such as control rods are not required. This burn-up strategy can derive many merits. The change of excess reactivity along burn-up is theoretically zero, and shim rods will not be required for this reactor. The reactor becomes free from accidents induced by unexpected control rods withdrawal during power operation. The core characteristics, such as power feedback coefficients and power peaking factor, are not changed along burn-up. Therefore, {{the operation of the}} reactor becomes much easier than the conventional reactors especially high burn-up reactors. The transportation and storage of replacing fuels become easy and safe, since they are free from criticality accidents. In our previous works it appeared that application of this burn-up strategy to neutron rich fast reactors makes excellent performances.

40|$|This study {{addresses}} the over-prediction of local power when the burn-up distribution in each half-element of the NBSR {{is assumed to}} be uniform. A single-element model was utilized to quantify the impact of axial and plate-wise burn-up on the power distribution within the NBSR fuel elements for both high-enriched uranium (HEU) and low-enriched uranium (LEU) fuel. To validate this approach, key parameters in the single-element model were compared to parameters from an equilibrium core model, including neutron energy spectrum, power distribution, and integral U- 235 vector. The power distribution changes significantly when incorporating local burn-up effects and has lower power peaking relative to the uniform burn-up case. In the uniform burn-up case, the axial relative power peaking is over-predicted by as much as 59 % in the HEU single-element and 46 % in the LEU single-element with uniform burn-up. In the uniform burn-up case, the plate-wise power peaking is over-predicted by as much as 23 % in the HEU single-element and 18 % in the LEU single-element. The degree of over-prediction increases as a function of burn-up cycle, with the greatest over-prediction at the end of Cycle 8. The thermal flux peak is always in the mid-plane gap; this causes the local cumulative burn-up near the mid-plane gap to be significantly higher than the fuel element <b>average.</b> Uniform <b>burn-up</b> distribution throughout a half-element also causes a bias in fuel element reactivity worth, due primarily to the neutronic importance of the fissile inventory in the mid-plane gap region...|$|R

Ident- 69 pin containers with fuel pins from these DFAs can also be stored. Section H. 3. 3. 10. 11 states that fuel types outside the specification criteria above will be addressed on a case-by-case basis. There are many different types of fuel and blanket experiments that were irradiated in the FFTF which now require offload to the spent fuel storage system. Two reviews were completed for a portion of these special type fuel components to determine if placement into the Core Component Container (CCC) /Interim Storage Cask (ISC) would require any special considerations or changes to the authorization basis. Project mission priorities coupled with availability of resources and analysts prevented these evaluations from being completed as a single effort. Areas of review have included radiological accident release consequences, radiological shielding adequacy, criticality safety, thermal limits, confinement, and stress.

The axial power profile peaked at about a third {{from the top of}} the fuel core and the radial profile peaked directly adjacent to the central graphite reflector. The maximum temperature during a Depressurised Loss of Coolant (DLOFC) incident was 1581. 0 °C, which is close to the limit of 1600 °C above which the leakage of radioactive fission products through the TRISO coatings around the fuel kernels may become unacceptable. This may present licensing challenges and also limits the total power output of the reactor. In this article the results of an optimisation study of the axial and radial power profiles for this reactor are reported. The main aim was to minimise the maximum DLOFC temperature. Reducing the maximum equilibrium temperature during normal operation was a lesser aim. Minimising the maximum DLOFC temperature was achieved by placing an optimised distribution of 10 B neutron poison in the central reflector. The standard power profiles are sub-optimal with respect to the passive leakage of decay heat during a DLOFC. Since the radial power profile peaks directly adjacent to the central reflector, the distance that the decay heat needs to be conducted toward the outside of the reactor and the ultimate heat sink is at a maximum. The sharp axial power profile peak means that most of the decay power is concentrated in a small part of the core volume, thereby sharply increasing the required outward heat flux in this hotspot region. Both these features sharply increase the maximum DLOFC temperatures in this hotspot. Therefore the axial distribution of the neutron poisons in the central reflector was optimised so as to push the equilibrium power density profile radially outward and to suppress the axial power peak near the middle of the core, while increasing the power density near the top and bottom of the core. This resulted in a huge reduction in the maximum DLOFC temperature from 1581. 0 °C to 1297. 6 °C, which may produce far reaching safety and economic benefits. However, it came at the cost of a 22 % reduction in the <b>average</b> <b>burn-up</b> of the fuel. In a separate optimisation attempt a much smaller, but still significant, reduction in the maximum equilibrium temperature, from 1023 °C down to 988 °C, was achievedSouth African Research Chairs Initiative of the Department of Science and Technology and National Research Foundation[URL]...|$|E
