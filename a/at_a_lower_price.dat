5|$|Liquor {{was another}} {{profitable}} private industry nationalized {{by the central}} government in 98 BC. However, this was repealed in 81 BC and a property tax rate of two coins for every 0.2L (0.05 gallons) was levied for those who traded it privately. By 110 BC Emperor Wu also interfered with the profitable trade in grain when he eliminated speculation by selling government-stored grain <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>lower</b> <b>price</b> than demanded by merchants. Apart from Emperor Ming's creation of a short-lived Office for Price Adjustment and Stabilization, which was abolished in 68 AD, central-government price control regulations were largely absent during the Eastern Han.|$|E
5|$|The iPhone 5 {{was officially}} {{discontinued}} by Apple on September 10, 2013 with {{the announcement of}} its successors, the iPhone 5S and the iPhone 5C. While the 5C shared almost the same internal hardware as the iPhone 5, the 5C used a lower-cost poly-carbonate plastic case {{in place of the}} original 5's aluminum form. The introduction of the 5C deviated from Apple's previous market strategy, where the previous iPhone model would remain in production, but sold <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>lower</b> <b>price</b> point below the new model.|$|E
5|$|The mix of {{engraving}} styles was criticised; {{line engraving}} {{was considered the}} superior form and artists and subscribers disliked the mixture of lesser forms with it. Moreover, Boydell's engravers fell behind schedule, delaying the entire project. He was forced to engage lesser artists, such as Hamilton and Smirke, <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>lower</b> <b>price</b> to finish the volumes as his business started to fail. Modern art historians have generally concurred {{that the quality of}} the engravings, particularly in the folio, was poor. Moreover, the use of so many different artists and engravers led to a lack of stylistic cohesion.|$|E
5|$|On June 28, the Lakers {{decided that}} they would not make Morris the $1.2 million {{qualifying}} offer prior to the July 1 deadline that would have been necessary to make him a restricted free agent. Although the team expressed interest in re-signing Morris <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>lower</b> <b>priced</b> contract and having him represent the team again in the summer league, he would become an unrestricted free agent at the deadline because the qualifying offer was not made.|$|R

50|$|A {{number of}} {{electric}} vehicle advocates voiced disappointment {{that the choice}} was made to manufacture only the NiMH version. Many electric vehicle advocates claim that automaker's choice of the NiMH battery worked against the 90's deployment of cost-effective electric vehicles based on PbA batteries, and that further development of lead-acid technology could result in performance equal to NiMH, but <b>at</b> <b>a</b> substantially <b>lower</b> <b>price.</b> Their argument is that a usable electric vehicle is possible <b>at</b> <b>a</b> substantially <b>lower</b> <b>price,</b> and that the <b>lower</b> purchase <b>price</b> would foster greater acceptance of electric vehicles.|$|R
5|$|Three {{years after}} its 2000 release, Vagrant Story was {{selected}} as one of Sony's Greatest Hits. Games released as Greatest Hits were sold <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>lower</b> <b>price,</b> often increasing units sold. Vagrant Story {{is also part of}} Ultimate Hits, Square Enix's main budget range. The game was later made playable on Sony's PlayStation Portable and PlayStation 3 consoles when Square Enix announced the title's release on the PlayStation Stores in Japan, Europe and North America.|$|E
5|$|Like the Berlina, the Calais {{retains the}} {{features}} of the outgoing model but <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>lower</b> <b>price</b> point. Offering a blend of luxury and sporting character, it pairs the High Output Alloytec V6 engine of the SV6 with the five-speed automatic transmission. Unlike the previous model Calais which featured a semi-sport suspension setup known as FE1.5, the VE shares the Commodore SS/SS V stiff sports suspension. Like the SS, an upscale V-Series edition is available. Being the flagship of the Commodore range, it comes with everything the VE has to offer and serves as a stepping stone to the luxury long-wheelbase Statesman/Caprice range based on the VE. The Calais (as well as Berlina) are the only models in the range to feature larger tail-lights.|$|E
5|$|The main {{harvesting}} {{season for}} coffee in Rwanda is during the major rainy season, running from March {{to the end}} of May. At harvest time, farmers spend most of the day picking cherries by hand. In the evening, they carry them in traditional baskets woven from banana leaves to the washing station, which may be several hours away. Technicians hand-sort the beans to pick out the best cherries, those with a deep red colour, and return the remainder to the grower to be sold on to markets outside the Maraba process <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>lower</b> <b>price.</b> The technicians pay the grower US$0.10 per kilogram. This money accumulates, and the association pays it each fortnight into farmers' bank accounts.|$|E

5|$|In September 2010, a teaser website was {{revealed}} by Sega, hinting {{at a new}} Valkyria Chronicles game. In its September issue, Famitsu listed that Senj≈ç no Valkyria 3 would be arriving on the PlayStation Portable. Its first public appearance was at the 2010 Tokyo Game Show (TGS), where a demo was made available for journalists and attendees. During the publicity, story details were kept scant {{so as not to}} spoil too much for potential players, along with some of its content still being in flux {{at the time of its}} reveal. To promote the game and detail the story leading into the game's events, an episodic Flash visual novel written by Fujii began release in January 2011. The game was released January 27, 2011. During an interview, the development team said that the game had the capacity for downloadable content (DLC), but that no plans were finalized. Multiple DLC maps, featuring additional missions and recruitable characters, were released between February and April 2011. An expanded edition of the game, Valkyria Chronicles III Extra Edition, released on November 23, 2011. Packaged and sold <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>lower</b> <b>price</b> than the original, Extra Edition game with seven additional episodes: three new, three chosen by staff from the game's DLC, and one made available as a pre-order bonus. People who also owned the original game could transfer their save data between versions.|$|E

50|$|In {{second degree}} price discrimination, price varies {{according}} to quantity demanded. Larger quantities are available <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>lower</b> unit <b>price.</b> This is particularly widespread in sales to industrial customers, where bulk buyers enjoy higher discounts.|$|R
25|$|Sainsbury's was {{a pioneer}} in the {{development}} of own-brand goods; the aim was to offer products that matched the quality of nationally branded goods but <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>lower</b> <b>price.</b> It expanded more cautiously than did Tesco, shunning acquisitions, and it never offered trading stamps.|$|E
25|$|Dell sells {{computers}} (initially Inspiron 14R and 15R laptops) pre-loaded with Ubuntu in India and China, with 850 and 350 {{retail outlets}} respectively.

25|$|In general, {{producers}} are always allowed to declassify their wine in steps to a lower-ranked AOC {{if they wish}} to do so. Thus, a wine from a Grand Cru vineyard may be sold as a Premier Cru from that vineyard's village, a Premier Cru wine may be sold as a Village wine, and so on. This practice will almost invariably mean the declassified wine will have to be sold <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>lower</b> <b>price,</b> so this is only practiced when something is to be gained overall in the process. One motive may be to only include vines of a certain age in a Grand Cru wine, to improve its quality and raise its prestige and price, in which case the wine coming from younger vines may be sold as a Premier Cru <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>lower</b> <b>price.</b> Overall, such a practice may allow a producer to keep a higher average price for the wine sold.|$|E

25|$|Emerson Radio {{dropped its}} last U.S.-made product, the {{phonograph}} line, in 1980 because it became unprofitable due to rising labor costs. Despite harsh competition, Emerson Radio raised its sales and earnings in fiscal 1980 to $81.9 million and $1.6 million, respectively. Their {{plan was to}} have their suppliers (mainly in Taiwan and South Korea) imitate Sony and Panasonic audio/video products and then sell them <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>lower</b> <b>price.</b>|$|E
25|$|BMW was {{reportedly}} unable {{to build more}} than 10 to 20 Z1 vehicles each day. More {{than half of all}} Z1 vehicles (specifically, 4,091) were produced for the 1990 model year. Seventy-eight Z1 vehicles were reportedly used as test mules, although most were later sold without a warranty and, presumably, <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>lower</b> <b>price.</b> None of the Z1 vehicles were sold with air conditioning. The vehicle's dashboard is very small and {{there was no room for}} both heat and cooling units.|$|E
25|$|Given {{the success}} of his auctions at the Temple, in January 1814 Lafitte set up a similar auction at a site just outside New Orleans. Officials tried to break up this auction by force, and in the ensuing gunfight, one of the revenue {{officers}} was killed and two others were wounded. Many of the city's merchants were also unhappy with this auction, because it allowed their customers to buy goods directly from Lafitte <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>lower</b> <b>price</b> than the merchants could charge.|$|E
