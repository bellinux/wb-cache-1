50|$|The A-1 is {{the high}} {{technology}} standard bearer of the landmark Canon amateur level A-series SLRs. The {{other members of the}} A-series are the Canon AE-1 (released 1976), AT-1 (1977), AV-1 (1979), AE-1 Program (1981) and AL-1 (1982). They all use the same compact aluminum alloy chassis, but with differing feature levels and outer cosmetic <b>acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene</b> (ABS) plastic panels. By sharing most major components, and an inexpensive horizontal cloth-curtain shutter, costs could be spread out over a larger production volumes. The A-1 represented Canon's bid to defeat Nikon through more features and the cheapest price.|$|E
50|$|In {{keeping with}} its {{cost-cutting}} philosophy, Canon designed the AE-1 {{to use a}} significant amount of structural plastic for a lighter and cheaper camera at the expense of being less impact resistant. Canon went to great effort to disguise the use of plastic - the injection-molded <b>acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene</b> (ABS) for the top panel finished with ether satin chrome (or black enameled) to give {{the look and feel of}} metal. The bottom plate were made of brass and then finished with satin chrome (or black enameled). Extensive use of electronics also allowed simpler modular internal construction instead of mechanical linkages. Five major and 25 minor internal modules reduced the individual parts count by over 300. Modular construction, in turn, allowed automated production lines in order to reduce cost. Unfortunately, cost concerns also resulted in the use of plastic in some of the moving/operating mechanisms.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{the other}} compact F-series SLRs, the FA used a plastic top plate: {{fiberglass}} reinforced polycarbonate {{for the black}} bodies, <b>acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene</b> (ABS) for the chrome ones. The FA also used the ultra-fast, bearing-mounted, honeycomb-patterned, titanium-bladed shutter and through-the-lens (TTL) off-the-film (OTF) electronic flash automation of the FE2, but added a digital liquid crystal display (LCD) information panel at the top left of the viewfinder to indicate the readings of the built-in, open aperture, through-the-lens (TTL) light meter versus the actual camera settings. Depending on the set exposure mode, the LCD would display +/- over/underexposure markers, HI/LO out of metering range warnings, shutter speed and/or f-stop. Unfortunately, the LCD could not be illuminated in low ambient light situations. The FA also had a removable finger grip, {{similar to the one}} introduced on the Nikon FG, and an eyepiece blind. However, the FA's real claim to fame was the AMP meter.|$|E
40|$|The {{continuation}} from {{rapid prototyping}} into rapid tooling technologies allows speedy fabrication of sacrificial patterns for investment casting process. Direct expendable pattern fabrication with intricate features using rapid prototyping techniques significantly reduces the fabrication cost when associated with single- or low-volume production. During investment casting process, rapid prototyping patterns {{are subjected to}} high melting temperatures, high viscosities, and high thermal stress such as dewaxing and shell mold cracking. Furthermore, ceramic shell may cause crack during melting and burning out of the patterns and also incomplete collapsibility. Although rapid prototyping process can build parts with high stiffness rapidly, the part surface suffered a staircase effect and shrinkage during investment casting process solidification. This paper presents a direct approach of multijet modeling and fused deposition modeling on acrylate- and acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene-based materials {{to be used as}} expendable patterns for the investment casting process. Thermal analyses were conducted on the rapid prototyping materials that exhibit mass loss and expansion. Quality assessment and benchmarking were performed between the rapid prototyping and the metal part on accuracy, surface roughness, and part built time. It was found that both the materials have dimensional deviation when employed in investment casting process and acrylate patterns have better surface roughness as compared to <b>acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene</b> patterns. Additionally, multijet modeling recorded a significantly shorter lead time when more than a single part can be produced during the rapid prototyping process. It was observed that the shell mold after burnout experiences cracking. Results also showed that acrylate-based materials decomposed above 500 °C, meanwhile <b>acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene</b> was above 600 °C. Acrylate material had a coefficient of thermal expansion and linear dimensional deviation as compared with <b>acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene.</b> No ash was observed in the ceramic molds when the part burnout temperatures are above 500 °C acrylate material and 600 °C for <b>acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} iodine {{sorption}} on the free-volume of three polymers, namely, <b>acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene,</b> poly(ethylene terephthalate) and polycarbonate {{have been investigated}} by the positron annihilation Lifetime technique. Diffusion coefficients have been evaluated from the sorption curves using Crank's solution for Fick's second law of diffusion. The positron results are {{explained in terms of}} iodine filling the free-volume holes, swelling and conformational changes. It has also been found that the diffusion process in <b>acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene</b> and poly(ethylene terephthalate) deviates from Fick's law of diffusion whereas in polycarbonate, the diffusion process obeys Fick's law. Further, for polymers in which diffusion deviates from Fick's law, the sorption process has been separated into diffusion-controlled (Fickian) and relaxation-controlled (non-Fickian) parts using the dual-mode sorption model. Interestingly, the present results show that the polymers which deviate from Fickian diffusion also deviate from Fujita's free-volume theory of diffusion and vice versa. The positron results also indicate that sorbed iodine in the polymer acts as an inhibitor of orthopositronium. (C) 2001 Society of Chemical Industry...|$|E

40|$|The {{pyrolysis}} of brominated {{high impact}} polystyrene, brominated acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, television housing, integrated circuit tray and personal computer front panel plastics were performed respectively in a two stage reactor at a degradation temperature of 570 QC and heating rate of 20 QC. Four catalysts were {{used during the}} pyrolysis; waste fluid catalytic cracking catalyst (FCC), a natural zeolite catalyst, two Y -zeolite catalysts (CB V 400 and CBV 720) {{in order to increase}} the value of the pyrolysis products. The pyrolysis products were analysed by various analytical techniques. The thermogravimetric analysis of brominated high impact polystyrene, brominated <b>acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene</b> and television housing plastic showed a two stage degradation pattern while plastics from personal computer and integrated circuit tray showed a single step thermal degradation. On the TGA-FTIR the brominated high impact polystyrene, brominated acrylonitrile butadiene styrene and television housing plastic pyrolysed to form mono-substituted aromatics and aliphatic hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. The pyrolysis investigation at 570 QC showed that the oil yield was highest for the personal computer front panel plastic (85. 37 wt %) and. '" ~ least for the television housing plastic (57. 61 wt % oil). The natural zeolite catalyst increased the oil yield from all the plastics during pyrolysis. The gas yield was highest for the brominated <b>acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene</b> (2. 71 wt %) and least for the brominated high impact polystyrene (0. 92 wt %). The solid residue yield for the personal computer plastic and the brominated high impact polystyrene were low but that for brominated <b>acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene,</b> television housing plastic and integrated circuit tray plastic were much higher.
