500|$|In 1767, the 700-page The History and Present State of Electricity was {{published}} to positive reviews. The {{first half of}} the text is a history of the study of electricity to 1766; the second and more influential half is a description of contemporary theories about electricity <b>and</b> <b>suggestions</b> <b>for</b> future research. Priestley reported some of his own discoveries in the second section, such as the conductivity of charcoal and other substances and the continuum between conductors and non-conductors. This discovery overturned what he described as [...] "one of the earliest and universally received maxims of electricity", that only water and metals could conduct electricity. This and other experiments on the electrical properties of materials and on the electrical effects of chemical transformations demonstrated Priestley's early and ongoing interest in the relationship between chemical substances and electricity. Based on experiments with charged spheres, Priestley {{was among the first to}} propose that electrical force followed an inverse-square law, similar to Newton's law of universal gravitation.May we not infer from this experiment, that the attraction of electricity is subject to the same laws with that of gravitation, and is therefore according to the squares of the distances; since it is easily demonstrated, that were the earth in the form of a shell, a body in the inside of it would not be attracted to one side more than another? However, he did not generalise or elaborate on this, and the general law was enunciated by French physicist Charles-Augustin de Coulomb in the 1780s.|$|E
