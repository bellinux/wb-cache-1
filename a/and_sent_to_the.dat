5|$|The {{information}} Bukovsky {{had gathered}} <b>and</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> West galvanized {{human rights activists}} worldwide and those within the Soviet Union. It also struck a chord among psychiatrists. In September that year 44 European psychiatrists wrote to The Times (London) expressing grave doubts about the diagnoses of the six people concerned. At a meeting in November 1971, the World Federation for Mental Health called on its members to investigate the charges and defend the right to free opinion where it was threatened. These responses were carefully documented by the dissident human rights periodical Chronicle of Current Events, which also recorded the many statements made by Bukovsky's friends and fellow rights activists in his defence. As the person at the centre of this unprecedented international row, Bukovsky waited in almost total isolation, without access to a lawyer, to be tried <b>and</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> camps or a special psychiatric hospital.|$|E

5|$|A paper {{documenting the}} {{discovery}} was {{prepared by the}} team <b>and</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> journal Physical Review in March 1941, but publication was delayed until {{a year after the}} end of World War II due to security concerns. At the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, Egon Bretscher and Norman Feather realized that a slow neutron reactor fuelled with uranium would theoretically produce substantial amounts of plutonium-239 as a by-product. They calculated that element 94 would be fissile, and had the added advantage of being chemically different from uranium, and could easily be separated from it.|$|E
