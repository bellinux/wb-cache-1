50|$|This <b>attenuation</b> <b>mechanism</b> is {{experimentally}} supported. First, {{the translation}} of the leader peptide and ribosomal stalling are directly evidenced to be necessary for inhibiting the transcription termination. Moreover, mutational analysis destabilizing or disrupting the base-pairing of the antiterminator hairpin results in increased termination of several folds; consistent with the attenuation model, this mutation fails to relieve attenuation even with starved Trp. In contrast, complementary oligonucleotides targeting strand 1 increases the operon expression by promoting the antiterminator formation. Furthermore, in histidine operon, compensatory mutation shows that the pairing ability of strands 2-3 matters more than their primary sequence in inhibiting attenuation.|$|E

40|$|Intrinsic {{remediation}} is {{the effect}} of natural <b>attenuation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> – dilution, dispersion, sorption/precipitation and biodegradation – reducing contaminant concentrations in ground water to specified levels at predetermined compliance points in the aquifer. Current monitoring and modeling for post closure was used to assess the current and long-term potential of intrinsic remediation of contaminated seepage originating from a large reactive (sulfidic) tailings impoundment near Questa, New Mexico. It is concluded that the natural <b>attenuation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of precipitation within the tailings (as a result of buffering) and dilution/dispersion within the aquifer are currently active and likely sufficient to reduce contaminant concentrations to below state standards in the long-term. Other natural <b>attenuation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> such as sorption and biodegradation within the receiving aquifer(s) were not assessed here, but are likely further reducing contaminant concentrations.

5000|$|At the {{transcript}} level, {{disruption of the}} EAR motif leads to {{a significant decrease in}} the expression of distally located eps genes (epsF-O) without affecting proximal genes (epsC-E). Consistent with this observation, several potential intrinsic terminator hairpins were found inside the epsF coding region. [...] A wild-type EAR element is capable of promoting transcriptional readthrough of these epsF terminator sites. In contrast, mutational disruption of EAR instead permits termination at the epsF terminators. The EAR element also promotes readthrough of heterologous termination sites. From these data it was hypothesized that the EAR element controls eps expression through a processive antitermination mechanism to ensure the complete synthesis of the 16 kilobase operon. [...] Processive antitermination, as opposed to {{the transcript}}ion <b>attenuation</b> <b>mechanism</b> typically used by other cis-acting regulatory RNAs, is a process wherein the transcription elongation complex is altered by accessory factors to become resistant to pausing and termination signals. So far, EAR is the only processive antitermination system specific for Gram-positive bacteria. Further experiments failed to reconstitute EAR-mediated processive antitermination mechanism in vitro or in a Gram-negative heterologous host (E. coli), suggesting that additional B. subtilis-specific factor(s) may also be required for EAR antitermination.|$|E

30|$|The global δ 18 O and {{tropical}} SST anomalous sharply decline to near-zero in obliquity Rs during the Late Pleistocene suggesting an <b>attenuation</b> <b>mechanism</b> of the obliquity driving force {{and a reduction}} of the related feedback amplification processes. The post-MPT obliquity damping {{may have contributed to}} the strengthening of the eccentricity response by mitigating the obliquity “ice killing,” favoring a 100 -kyr long-life hysteresis ice growth volume. A long-life ice sheet sensitive to eccentricity during the time of a global icy state may have activated a synergistic response of positive feedback processes modulated on short eccentricity response times. In the Mid-Late Pleistocene, an icy state leads to a significant reduction in global forest cover making its negative feedbacks quantitatively less important but emphasizing the positive feedback processes, such as the vegetation-snow albedo in synergy with the sea-ice albedo and permafrost feedbacks. However, the origin of the post-MPT obliquity <b>attenuation</b> <b>mechanism</b> is an open question.|$|E

40|$|The current manuscripts {{deals with}} the design of passive {{mechanical}} filters for vibration attenuation a low frequencies. Traditionally, this has been addressed employing dissipation as the <b>attenuation</b> <b>mechanism.</b> While such strategy provides broad-frequency effectiveness, attenuation at any given frequency is modest. Mass and stiffness-modulated periodic systems, on the other hand, exploit dispersion as the <b>attenuation</b> <b>mechanism</b> and represent an alternative to dissipation-based devices. Attenuation due to dispersion may be significantly higher than what is afforded by dissipation-based systems within a design frequency rage. The proposed assemblies, however, are not easily tailored to filter lowe-frequency vibrations. To this end, embedding such periodic systems into an elastic matrix yields a high-pass mechanical filter with tunable stop bands were waves {{are not allowed to}} propagate. Significant improvements in performance moreover may be obtained if intrinsically nonlinear devices are adopted. Specifically, a strongly nonlinear medium such as ordered granular media supports a limited number of waveforms, resulting in an efficient mechanical filter. Results reported here, in fact, suggest matrix-embedded sphere chains as highly tunable mechanical filters for vibration attenuation...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{controlled}} landfill {{technology is}} now adopting passive attenuation techniques as {{an increasing number}} of landfill sites reach the post-closure phase. During the post-closure phase, landfill operators need to convince environmental authorities that landfills no longer pose a threat to health or the environment. The demonstration of such absence of risk should rely in particular on data collected during environmental monitoring in addition to modelling of possible future evolutions of environmental concentrations. One difficulty that is typically encountered in France is related to the fact that groundwater monitoring systems around landfills are often insufficiently detailed to provide conclusive evidence of natural <b>attenuation</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> This paper presents data on groundwater quality in the vicinity of an old landfill located in a complex aquifer system. While isotopic data suggest a signature of the landfill leachate in the groundwater {{in the vicinity of the}} landfill, chemical analyses do not show a strong influence, which could be indicative of natural <b>attenuation</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> However, the complexity of the groundwater system in this area is such that it cannot be excluded that emissions to the groundwater are not being overlooked.

Measuring the rates of the controlling <b>attenuation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> {{is a key to}} employing mass balance as a means to evaluate and monitor the expansion, stability and subsequent shrinkage of a contaminant plume. A team of researchers investigated the use of push-pull tests for measuring reductive dechlorination rates in situ at sites with low chlorinated solvent concentrations (< 1 ppm). The field research also examined the synergistic use of a suite of geochemical and microbial assays. Previous push-pull tests applied to environmental remediation objectives focused on general hydrological characterization or on designing bioremediation systems by examining the response of the subsurface to stimulation. In this research, the push-pull technique was tested to determine its ''low-range'' sensitivity and uncertainty. Can these tests quantify relatively low attenuation rates representative of natural attenuation? The results of this research indicate that push-pull testing will be useful for measurement of in situ reductive dechlorination rates for chlorinated solvents at ''Monitored Natural Attenuation'' (MNA) sites. Further, using principal component analysis and other techniques, the research confirmed the usefulness of multiple lines of evidence in site characterization and in upscaling measurements made in individual wells [...] especially for sites where there is a geochemical gradient or varying geochemical regimes within the contaminant plume...|$|R

50|$|When {{sound from}} a {{loudspeaker}} collides with {{the walls of}} a room part of the sound's energy is reflected, part is transmitted, and part is absorbed into the walls. Just as the acoustic energy was transmitted through the air as pressure differentials (or deformations), the acoustic energy travels through the material which makes up the wall in the same manner. Deformation causes mechanical losses via conversion of part of the sound energy into heat, resulting in acoustic attenuation, mostly due to the wall's viscosity.

40|$|AbstractWe report {{here the}} {{discovery}} of an <b>attenuation</b> <b>mechanism</b> of classic swine fever virus (CSFV) induced by introduction of a continuous 12 -nt (CUUUUUUCUUUU) insertion in viral 3 ′ UTR. The 12 -nt insertion sequence was first found in one attenuated vaccine strain HCLV (Hog Cholera Lapinized Virus) which {{did not exist in}} other CSFV strains. To address the function of the 12 -nt insertion in viral replication and attenuation, we constructed and analyzed two chimeras stemmed from a highly virulent strain Shimen either with introduction of the 12 -nt insertion in 3 ′ UTR or the replacement of viral 3 ′ UTR by the 3 ′ UTR of HCLV. We found that the two chimeras' maximum titers declined approximately 100 -fold than their parental strain Shimen in PK 15 cells. An animal experiment showed that the two chimeras were both dramatically attenuated in pigs. All the chimera-infected pigs survived infection and remained clinically normal {{with the exception of a}} transient fever while the 100 % mortality was observed for the Shimen-infected pigs. In addition, the two chimeras can induce neutralization antibody to completely protect the pigs against lethal challenge with highly virulent CSFV, which was similar to the vaccine strain HCLV. These data demonstrate that the 12 -nt insertion in 3 ′ UTR is sufficient for the attenuation of CSFV. Taken together, a novel <b>attenuation</b> <b>mechanism</b> of CSFV is found and may pave a way to further research for new attenuated vaccine...|$|E
40|$|The trp RNA-binding {{attenuation}} protein (TRAP) regulates {{expression of}} the Bacillus subtilis trpEDCFBA operon by a novel transcription <b>attenuation</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Tryptophan-activated TRAP binds to the nascent trp leader transcript by interacting with 11 (G/U) AG repeats, 6 of which are present in an antiterminator structure. TRAP binding to these repeats prevents formation of the antiterminator, thereby promoting formation of an overlapping intrinsic terminator. A third stem-loop structure that forms at the extreme 5 ′ end of the trp leader transcript also {{plays a role in}} the transcription <b>attenuation</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The 5 ′ stem-loop increases the affinity of TRAP for trp leader RNA. Results from RNA structure mapping experiments demonstrate that the 5 ′ stem-loop consists of a 3 -bp lower stem, a 5 -by- 2 asymmetric internal loop, a 6 -bp upper stem, and a hexaloop at the apex of the structure. Footprinting results indicate that TRAP interacts with the 5 ′ stem-loop and that this interaction differs depending on the number of downstream (G/U) AG repeats present in the transcript. Expression studies with trpE′-′lacZ translational fusions demonstrate that TRAP- 5 ′ stem-loop interaction is required for proper regulation of the trp operon. 3 ′ RNA boundary experiments indicate that the 5 ′ structure reduces the number of (G/U) AG repeats required for stable TRAP-trp leader RNA association. Thus, TRAP- 5 ′ stem-loop interaction may increase the likelihood that TRAP will bind to the (G/U) AG repeats in time to block antiterminator formation...|$|E
