500|$|The National Anthem Act {{specifies}} {{the lyrics}} and melody of [...] "O Canada", placing {{both of them}} in the public domain, allowing the anthem to be freely reproduced or used as a base for derived works, including musical arrangements. There are no regulations governing the performance of [...] "O Canada", leaving citizens to exercise their best judgment. When it is performed at an event, traditional etiquette is to either start or end the ceremonies with the anthem, including situations when other anthems are played, and for the audience to stand during the performance. Civilian men usually remove their hats, while women and children are not required to do so. Military men <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>uniform</b> traditionally keep their hats on and offer the military salute during the performance of the anthem, with the salute offered {{in the direction of the}} Maple Leaf Flag if one is present, and if not present it is offered standing at attention.|$|E

[...] Hunter thanked the general for his service and then argued that the sole issue was [...] "unit cohesion," [...] mirroring a statement from former Secretary of State Colin Powell. After the debate, Kerr was found {{to be a member of}} Hillary Clinton's Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transsexual Americans For Hillary Steering Committee. Because of this, CNN removed footage of the question from future telecasts. The next day, Hunter sent a letter to Hillary Clinton that read: [...] "Dear Hillary Clinton, Regarding the [...] "plant", retired Brig. Gen. Keith H.

500|$|In 1882, the U.S. Navy {{consisted}} of many outdated ship designs. Over the next decade, Congress approved building multiple modern steel-hulled armored cruisers and battleships, and by around {{the start of}} the 20th century had moved from twelfth place in 1870 to fifth place in terms of numbers of ships. After winning two major battles during the 1898 Spanish–American War, the American Navy continued to build more ships, {{and by the end of}} World War I had more men <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>uniform</b> than the British Royal Navy. The Washington Naval Conference of [...] 1921 recognized the Navy as equal in capital ship size to the Royal Navy, and during the 1920s and 1930s, the Navy built several aircraft carriers and battleships. The Navy was drawn into World War II after the Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, and over the next four years fought many historic battles including the Battle of the Coral Sea, the Battle of Midway, multiple naval battles during the Guadalcanal Campaign, and the largest naval battle in history, the Battle of Leyte Gulf. Much of the Navy's activity concerned the support of landings, not only with the [...] "island-hopping" [...] campaign in the Pacific, but also with the European landings. When the Japanese surrendered, a large flotilla entered Tokyo Bay to witness the formal ceremony conducted on the battleship , on which officials from the Japanese government signed the Japanese Instrument of Surrender. By the end of the war, the Navy had over 1,600 warships.|$|E

2500|$|In April 2004, Moulitsas and Daily Kos {{became the}} focus of {{controversy}} over a statement that he posted in the comments section of a blog post about Blackwater USA employees who were killed and mutilated in Fallujah:"Let the people see what war is like. This isn't an Xbox game. There are real repercussions to Bush's folly. That said, I feel nothing over the death of merceneries [...] They aren't in Iraq because of orders, or because they are there trying to help the people make Iraq a better place. They are there to wage war for profit. Screw them." [...] In a blog post the next day, Moulitsas defended and clarified his remarks:"My language was harsh, and, in reality, not true. Fact is, I did feel something. That's why I was so angry. I was angry that five soldiers—the real heroes in my mind—were killed the same day and got far lower billing in the newscasts. I was angry that 51 American soldiers paid the ultimate price for Bush's folly in Iraq in March alone. I was angry that these mercenaries make more in a day than our brave men <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>uniform</b> make in an entire month. I was angry that the US is funding private armies, paying them $30,000 per soldier, per month, while the Bush administration tries to cut our soldiers' hazard pay.

5000|$|At the {{outbreak}} of war, Canada's commitment {{to the war in}} Europe was limited by government to one division, and one division in reserve for home defence. Nevertheless, the eventual size of the Canadian armed forces greatly exceeded those envisioned in the pre-war period's so-called mobilization [...] "schemes". Over the course of the war, the army enlisted 730,000; the air force 260,000; and the navy 115,000 personnel. In addition, thousands of Canadians served in the Royal Air Force. Approximately half of Canada's army and three-quarters of its air-force personnel never left the country, compared to the overseas deployment of approximately three-quarters of the forces of Australia, New Zealand, and the United States. By war's end, however, 1.1 million men <b>and</b> <b>women</b> had served <b>in</b> <b>uniform</b> for Canada. The Navy grew from only a few ships in 1939 to over 400 ships, including three aircraft carriers and two cruisers. This maritime effort helped keep the shipping lanes open across the Atlantic throughout the war.|$|R
5000|$|This {{elegant and}} {{historical}} building {{has been described}} as a [...] "monumental neo-classical design" [...] and a [...] "modern rendering of the late Renaissance". The exterior, foyer and staircase are made of Portland stone and many of the rooms are ornately decorated with French walnut and oak panelling, carved plaster ceilings and elaborate crystal chandeliers. The most impressive apartment in the building is the Great Hall, which is approached via the grand staircase and its processional route to the first floor. The walls of the Great Hall can be described as a 'Graeco-Roman rhapsody', as huge marble pilasters with bronze effect Ionic capitals and metal bases interspersed with consoled panels that frame portraits from the Institution's oil paintings collection flow around the vertical surfaces. The ceiling of the Great Hall features a huge painting by Charles Sims commemorating World War 1 (the patron being Sir John Purser Griffith, ICE President in 1920). The work shows a female figure draped in what appears to be a robe or peplos holding in one hand a giant Union Flag, billowing in the wind, and in the other hand a wreath (she is identified in the ICE Catalogue of Works and Art as 'the figure of Renown, wearing a mourning veil and holding out a wreath of bays with the gesture of crowning'). Peering down at the viewer from the edge of the painting are servicemen <b>and</b> <b>women</b> dressed <b>in</b> <b>uniforms</b> reflecting the different branches of the military and above them can be seen a low-flying biplane with fixed undercarriage proudly displaying its red, white, and blue insignia.

40|$|Work {{has been}} seen as the central social process that links {{individuals}} to in-dustrial society and to each other. Although work issues are considered universal, the actual study of work has proceeded along sex-differentiated lines, so that (1) women are rarely studied as workers; (2) studies that do include women offer biased interpretations; and (3) the entire analysis of work is distorted. We argue that these problems arise from the use of sex-segregated models of analysis: the job model for men and the gender model for women. Further, we argue that these models lead researchers to ask different kinds of questions according to the sex of the workers, to treat men as <b>uniform</b> <b>in</b> relation to family <b>and</b> <b>women</b> as <b>uniform</b> <b>in</b> relation to employment and, implicitly, to use the patterns of men's relation to employment as the standard in analysis. Two case studies are examined in detail to illustrate the varying ways in which job and gender models have distorted investigation and inter-pretation. The paper ends with suggestions for reconceptualizing work to include forms of unpaid as well as paid work and for incorporating gender stratification into the analysis of work...|$|R
50|$|The {{most famous}} of many film {{appearances}} is in Yankee Doodle Dandy (1942) starring James Cagney in his Oscar-winning performance. In that otherwise Hollywoodized film, this song was used effectively as an illustration of the creative process. The way the film portrays it, Cohan is watching a military band parade by, and a segment {{of one of their}} songs catches his ear, a simple triad that he finds himself whistling. Late at night, he is seen slowly working out the complete new song on a piano, note by note. The next scene unveils the song, as Cohan (Cagney) <b>and</b> a <b>woman</b> dressed <b>in</b> <b>uniform</b> (Frances Langford, portraying Nora Bayes) sing it to a large and appreciative audience. The song is reprised {{at the very end of}} the film. As Cohan is leaving the White House grounds, a group of soldiers march past the now-aged Cohan, singing the song. Another bystander, also elderly, does a startled take as he finds himself standing next to the author of that song. Cohan (along with other citizens) begins to march alongside and in step with the soldiers. One of them (character actor Frank Faylen), not knowing who the old man is, teases him into joining the singing. The film irises-out on a closeup of Cohan (Cagney) singing the final line of the song's chorus.|$|R
40|$|Aborigines have {{inhabited}} Australia {{for many}} thousands of years. They led a ‘hunter-gatherer’ lifestyle prior to European contact. They {{are known to have}} lower sitting-height to stature ratio with long legs, relatively short trunks and narrow across the torso and hips (a ‘linear’ body build). European expeditions {{in the early twentieth century}} confirm that overweight and obesity was rarely observed. In the second half of the twentieth century, the traditional lifestyle of Aborigines had transitioned to a westernised lifestyle. Associated with such a transition to western lifestyle is the epidemic of non-communicable chronic health conditions such as diabetes, cardio-vascular diseases and renal failure. Average weight and Body Mass Index (BMI) of Aborigines have increased over time. However, this increase is not uniform across Aboriginal Australia. There are major differences in the body habitus profile between different clan groups/communities. In spite of these variations, the pattern of preferential central obesity <b>in</b> both men <b>and</b> <b>women</b> is <b>uniform</b> <b>in</b> almost all the communities. This could have provided a survival advantage under conditions of traditional lifestyle (with its ‘feast-and-famine’ pattern of food intake) experienced by Aborigines prior to European contact. Our studies have shown that BMI significantly underestimated overweight and obesity when compared to other indices of body fat. Aborigines have preferential central fat deposition and exhibit consistently higher waist-hip ratios when compared to other Australians. Also, prevalences of overweight and obesity depend on the anthropometric definitions used. The relationship of surrogate estimates of body composition such as S 4 for subcutaneous fat and height 2 /resistance for FFM (fat free mass) to body weight and BMI are significantly different between Aboriginal people and European Australians. Even at lower levels of body habitus profiles, Aborigines have increased risk for chronic conditions. Also, anthropometric characteristics differ substantially among different Aboriginal communities and stereotyping and generalisations should be avoided...|$|R
