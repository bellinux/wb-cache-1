5|$|Support for Chovanec's {{comments}} {{was largely}} {{among members of}} parliament elected for the Communist Party. Others accused Chovanec of abusing the tragedy for his own political benefit. Some members of parliament, such as Miroslav Antl, Chairman of the Senate Constitutional Committee, commented that the licensing process is thorough enough, and pointed out that he considers carrying of concealed firearm as a necessity due to variety of reasons, especially in recent time also due to the rising threat of Islamist terrorist attacks. Roman Váňa, Chairman of the Parliamentary Security Committee and member of Chovanec's own Social Democratic party, refused Chovanec's argument, while some other members of parliament went in the opposite direction, claiming {{that there are too}} few <b>armed</b> people among the Czech population, since a single <b>armed</b> civilian might have stopped Kovář's assault. The sentiment was shared also by, for example, Martin Koller, a former ambassador to Kuvait and Iraq, who said that an <b>armed</b> attacker may be stopped only by <b>armed</b> force, and who pointed out to a past well-known Czech case of a machete attack and to the Charlie Hebdo shooting, stating that both might have ended quite differently had the victims been <b>armed.</b>|$|E

40|$|Proprioceptive signals {{coming from}} both <b>arms</b> {{are used to}} {{determine}} the perceived position of one <b>arm</b> in a two-arm matching task. Here, we examined whether the perceived position of one <b>arm</b> is affected by proprioceptive signals from the other <b>arm</b> in a one-arm pointing task in which participants specified the perceived position of an unseen reference <b>arm</b> with an indicator paddle. Both <b>arms</b> were hidden from the participant’s view throughout the study. In Experiment 1, with both <b>arms</b> placed in front of the body, the participants received 70 – 80 Hz vibration to the elbow flexors of the reference <b>arm</b> (= right <b>arm)</b> to induce the illu-sion of elbow extension. This extension illusion was compared with that when the left <b>arm</b> elbow flexors were vibrated or not. The degree of the vibration-induced extension illusion of the right <b>arm</b> was reduced in the presence of left <b>arm</b> vibration. In Experiment 2, we found that this kinesthetic interaction between the two <b>arms</b> did not occur when the left <b>arm</b> was vibrated in an abducted position. In Experiment 3, the vibration-induced extension illusion of one <b>arm</b> was fully developed when this <b>arm</b> was placed at an abducted position, indicating that the brain receives increased proprioceptive input from a vibrated <b>arm</b> even if the <b>arm</b> was abducted. Our results suggest that proprioceptive interaction between the two <b>arms</b> occurs in a one-arm pointing task when the two <b>arms</b> are aligned with one another. The position sense of one <b>arm</b> measured using a pointer appears to include the influences of incoming information from the other <b>arm</b> when both <b>arms</b> were placed in front of the body and parallel to one another...|$|R
