40|$|The {{classical}} {{approach to}} scramjet intake design, analysis, experimental testing, and performance assessment treats the intake as {{separate from the}} rest of the vehicle. This thesis argues that a more integrated approach is necessary. The design space of Mach 7 two-dimensional, axi-symmetric spike and Busemann-type intakes with focused forebody waves and throats expanded to the Kantrowitz limit is parameterised geometrically and stream thrust average performance parameters calculated across the range of possible intake designs. An engine cycle is applied to arbitrate between conflicting capability and efficiency design points. The two-dimensional analysis is extended to include angle of attack, off-design Mach number and defocused conditions. Intakes with sharp leading edges and moderate turning angles are found to perform optimally, and the relatively large combustor hydraulic diameter and higher capability of inward turning designs are found to improve engine performance significantly. An upper bound is established for the performance of stream-traced Busemann intakes and it is shown how the performance of truncated Busemann derivatives may be improved by extending the leading edge at constant angle. The thesis also describes complementary experiments investigating intake operability carried out in the University of Oxford's gun tunnel. This facility was converted to operate as a Ludwieg tube with Light piston Isentropic Compression Heating (LICH) to improve flow steadiness when matching Reynolds numbers and temperature ratios to 2 : 5 scale Mach 7, 30 km altitude flight. Tunnel stagnation temperatures are measured and correlations to the fill pressures and stagnation pressure history are determined. The design and build of a two-dimensional wedge intake with isolator to determine intake starting limits by varying cowl position and shoulder angle is described. The isolator is shown to degrade starting characteristics by increasing the likelihood of internal choking. The implementation of a self-starting test, employing gas injection via fast acting valves, is implemented to demonstrate the self-starting characteristics of an axi-symmetric spike intake with internal contraction exceeding the Kantrowitz limit. Fuel injection and combustor back pressure are also simulated at <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack.</b> <b>Boundary</b> layer trips are shown to significantly improve the operability of both models tested.

To see {{the inside of the}} thin boundary layer in detail the magnification factor was increased up to about 60 pixels/mm by inserting extension tube between the lens and CCD camera. Tests were performed with and without boundary layer transition trip attached on the both surfaces at 10 % chord for comparison between laminar and turbulent boundary layers. Surface mount hot film sensor was also used to determine boundary layer transition from laminar to turbulent or relaminarization from turbulent to laminar by inspecting intermittency factors. The purpose of this research was to determine the boundary layer transition behavior as <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> changes. The experimental results indicates that as <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> increases <b>boundary</b> layer transition position moves toward leading edge on the suction side while laminar boundary layer remains unchanged on the pressure side with smooth surface condition. On the contrary, turbulent boundary layer on the pressure side of trip surface condition is relaminarized as <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> increases causing early laminar boundary layer separation.

The lift-to-drag ratio required for the precision landing trajectory will be achieved via an <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> equal to 16 degrees. At this relatively high <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack,</b> the <b>boundary</b> layer flow near the leeward meridian is expected to transition early in the trajectory, resulting in substantially increased heating loads. This paper presents stability calculations and transition correlations for a series of wind tunnel models of the MSL vehicle. Experimentally measured transition onset locations are used to correlate with the N-factor calculations for various wind tunnel conditions. Due to relatively low post-shock Mach numbers near the edge of the boundary layer, the dominant instability waves are found to be of the first mode type. The N-factor values correlating with measured transition onset at selected test points from the Mach 6 conventional facility experiments fall between 3. 5 and 4. 5 and apparently vary linearly with the wind tunnel unit Reynolds number, indicating strong receptivity effect. The small transition N value is consistent with previous correlations for second-mode dominant transition in the same wind tunnel facility. Stability calculations for stationary and traveling crossflow instability waves in selected configurations indicate that an N value of 4 and 6, respectively, correlates reasonably well with transition onset discerned from one experimentally measured thermographic image...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an investigation {{on the effect}} of introducing large-scale roughness through static curvature modifications on the low speed flow over an airfoil. The surfaces of a standard Eppler 398 airfoil have been modified with regular perturbations or “bumps ” of the order of 2 %c for this purpose. While the actual E 398 airfoil is not a suitable candidate for low Re cases due to extensive prevalence of boundary layer separation, it is expected that the bumps would exercise passive flow control by promoting early transition to turbulence, thereby reducing the extent of separation and improving the performance. The fluid dynamic mechanism behind this separation control methodology is not clearly understood, however. Smoke-wire flow visualization is performed for qualitative observation of the separation region in both the perturbed and unmodified airfoil geometry cases. At higher Re values, pressure probe measurements are made to quantify the wake momentum deficits. Unsteady 2 D PIV measurements are employed to understand the near-wall flowfield behavior. The size and strength of vortical structures formed in the separating shear layer are examined, along with measurements on the laminar separation bubble.

40|$|Synthetic jets {{have emerged}} as fluid devices for active control {{boundary}} layer separation and turbulence. In the proposed TFM the interaction of a modelled synthetic h¡jet with a laminar boundary layer will be investigated numerically using a incompressible Navier–Stokes solver. The main goals of the present TFM are oriented to:-The numerical simulation of synthetic jets into a laminar boundary layer and, -to perform a systematic parametrisation of the synthetic jet in order to characterise the level of flow control in the boundary layer. This report presents {{a study of the}} interaction of AFC (specifically, synthetic jets) with the laminar boundary layer of a NACA 0012 airfoil. First of all, {{in order to understand the}} phenomenology of Navier-Stokes equations, a spectro-consistent Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code has been developed from scratch. By using a spectro-consistent discretization, the fundamental symmetry properties of the underlying differential operators are preserved. This code also helps to understand how the energy is transported from big to small scales. After solving a paradigmatic problem (TGV) using the aforementioned code, a mature CFD code (Alya) is used to simulate the flow around the NACA 0012 airfoil. Alya software also uses a spectro-consistent code but in Finite Element Method (FEM). Once the reference cases are solved for different <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack,</b> a <b>boundary</b> condition representing an idealized synthetic jet is implemented. A systematic parametrization of the synthetic jet has been performed in order to assess the level of flow control in the boundary layer. Results demonstrate that, by selecting a correct combination of actuator frequency and momentum coefficient, the lift coefficient increases while the drag coefficient decreases producing a better lift-to-drag ratio. This aerodynamic improvement implies that a better circulation control is achieved, less noise is produced and less fuel consumption is required.

Total-pressure recoveries of 13. 7 and 13. 1 percent were obtained at <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> 0 degrees and 3 degrees, respectively.

40|$|AbstractOver the {{configuration}} of a pointed ogive-cylindrical body with 30 ° swept wing, wind tunnel experiments are conducted to investigate the wing rock motion in pitching-up {{as well as the}} flow structure responsible for it. Results show that wing rock would present as a sinusoid like motion during <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> 20 °∼ 85 ° in high rate pitching-up. And the evolvement of forebody vortices with <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> should be responsible for the sinusoid like motion. Firstly, the wing rock is triggered by forebody asymmetric vortices at moderate <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> (about 30 °). Secondly, the variation of forebody asymmetric vortices with <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> sustains the wing rock during <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> 30 °∼ 60 °. At last, the wing rock after <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> 60 ° is a convergent process of rolling due to the breakdown of forebody asymmetric vortices...|$|R
5000|$|P-Factor is {{sometimes}} erroneously explained {{with the word}} [...] "bite", as in [...] "the descending blade has a bigger bite, or <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack,</b> than the ascending blade". This faulty explanation {{does not take into}} account the forward motion of the blades as aircraft's <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> increases. In order to better understand this concept, imagine a propeller aircraft moving forward with a 90° <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> (vertical). This situation is identical to what a helicopter experiences, but a helicopter can reduce or increase the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> individual blades of the rotor (decreasing the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> on the advancing blade, while increasing the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> on the retreating blade) in order to keep the lift of the rotor disc balanced. Because the force of the air on the blades moving forwards through the arc is greater, they will produce more thrust than the blades that move backwards. If the blades of the rotor were unable to independently change their <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> there would be a constant backwards rolling motion due to the increased lift on the side of the rotor disc with the advancing blade. In a fixed-wing aircraft, there is usually no way to adjust the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> the individual blades of the propellers, therefore the pilot must contend with P-Factor and use the rudder to counteract the shift of thrust.|$|R
50|$|In fluid dynamics, a stall is a {{reduction}} in the lift coefficient generated by a foil as <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> increases. This occurs when the critical <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> the foil is exceeded. The critical <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> is typically about 15 degrees, but it may vary significantly depending on the fluid, foil, and Reynolds number.|$|R
