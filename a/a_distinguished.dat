40|$|If {{a finite}} state machine M does not have <b>a</b> <b>distinguishing</b> sequence, but has UIO {{sequences}} for its states, there are methods to produce a checking sequence for M. However, if M has <b>a</b> <b>distinguishing</b> sequence D, then there are methods that make use of D to construct checking sequences that are much shorter than the ones that would be constructed by using only the UIO sequences for M. The methods to applied when <b>a</b> <b>distinguishing</b> sequence exists, only {{make use of the}} distinguishing sequences. In this paper we show that, even if M has <b>a</b> <b>distinguishing</b> sequence D, the UIO sequences can still be used together with D to construct shorter checking sequences...|$|R
40|$|<b>A</b> <b>distinguishing</b> {{coloring}} of <b>a</b> graph G is a coloring of the vertices so {{that every}} nontrivial automorphism of G maps some vertex to a vertex with a different color. The distinguishing number of G is the minimum k such that G has <b>a</b> <b>distinguishing</b> coloring where each vertex is assigned a color from { 1,..., k}. A list assignment to G is an assignment L = {L(v) }v∈V (G) of lists of colors to the vertices of G. <b>A</b> <b>distinguishing</b> L-coloring of G is <b>a</b> <b>distinguishing</b> coloring of G where the color of each vertex v comes from L(v).
