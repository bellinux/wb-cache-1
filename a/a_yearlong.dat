25|$|Bucharest {{was shaken}} {{by a series}} of crimes {{committed}} {{in the latter half of}} 1970 and the first months of 1971. An unknown individual would use a hammer, a small ax, an iron bar or a knife to attack restaurant waitresses who were alone and returning from work. He struck after midnight during unusual weather conditions such as snowstorms, driving rain, high winds, freezing cold or fog. Many women would not go outside after 9:00 pm except in large groups or with men. Their terror was heightened by the police's reluctance to release details, leading to wildly exaggerated rumors.

25|$|In 208, Xu Huang {{followed}} Cao Cao {{to pacify}} Jing Province (covering present-day Hubei and Hunan), {{and participated in}} the Battle of Red Cliffs in the same year. When Cao Cao retreated north after his defeat at Red Cliffs, Xu Huang was ordered to stay behind with Cao Ren in Jiangling (江陵; present-day Jiangling County, Hubei) to resist Sun Quan's counteroffensive. In one occasion, the enemy commander Zhou Yu left the defence of his main camp to his subordinate, Ling Tong, and led most of the troops to rescue another general, Gan Ning, who was surrounded by Cao Ren's cavalry at Yiling (夷陵; present-day Yichang, Hubei). Ling Tong was left with only a wee fraction of the army to guard the camp. Xu Huang and Cao Ren were unable to defeat Ling Tong and the enemy camp remained intact. As a result, <b>a</b> <b>yearlong</b> vigorous fighting followed and the casualty count on Cao Cao's side became enormous, so Xu Huang and Cao Ren finally abandoned Jiangling and retreated north.|$|E

40|$|Since {{the release}} of A Nation at Risk in 1983 student {{performance}} {{on a variety of}} high stakes tests have become increasingly important in educational settings. The results of this type of assessment are quantifiable, and are intended to indicate certain levels of academic performance and achievement. Advanced Placement (AP) Exams are one example of high stakes tests. With the rapid growth of Advanced Placement (AP) courses and the corresponding popularity of the AP Exams there is a need in the research to identify specific variables that may be influential to AP Exam score performance. Course schedule type, either in the 4 × 4 block or traditional yearlong format, has been examined as a variable that influences student AP Exam score performance. In some studies the implementation of a 4 × 4 block in place of <b>a</b> traditional <b>yearlong</b> course schedule type resulted in increased AP Exam score performance, while in other studies replacement of <b>a</b> traditional <b>yearlong</b> course schedule by a 4 × 4 block course schedule type resulted in decreased AP Exam score performance. The limitations in the existing research present a need for more controlled studies using multiple years of data to further examine the relationship between clearly identified course schedule types and AP Exam score performance...|$|R
25|$|Fossey {{turned down}} an offer to join the Henrys on an African tour {{due to lack of}} finances, but in 1963 she {{borrowed}} $8,000 (one year's salary), took out her life savings and went on a seven-week visit to Africa. In September 1963, she arrived in Nairobi, Kenya. While there, she met actor William Holden, owner of Treetops Hotel, who introduced her to her safari guide, John Alexander. Alexander became her guide for the next seven weeks through Kenya, Tanzania, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Rhodesia. Alexander's route included visits to Tsavo, Africa's largest national park; the saline lake of Manyara, famous for attracting giant flocks of flamingos; and the Ngorongoro Crater, well known for its abundant wildlife. The final two sites for her visit were Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania (the archeological site of Louis and Mary Leakey); and Mt. Mikeno in Congo, where in 1959, American zoologist George Schaller had carried out <b>a</b> <b>yearlong</b> pioneering study of the mountain gorilla. At Olduvai Gorge, Fossey met the Leakeys while they were examining the area for hominid fossils. Leakey talked to Fossey about the work of Jane Goodall and the importance of long-term research of the great apes. Although she had broken her ankle while visiting the Leakeys, by October 16, Fossey was staying in Walter Baumgartel's small hotel in Uganda, the Travellers Rest. Baumgartel, an advocate of gorilla conservation, {{was among the first to}} see the benefits that tourism could bring to the area, and he introduced Fossey to Kenyan wildlife photographers Joan and Alan Root. The couple agreed to allow Fossey and Alexander to camp behind their own camp, and it was during these few days that Fossey first encountered wild mountain gorillas. After staying with friends in Rhodesia, Fossey returned home to Louisville to repay her loans. She published three articles in The Courier-Journal newspaper, detailing her visit to Africa.|$|E
