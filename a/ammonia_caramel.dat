40|$|S Supporting Information ABSTRACT: 1 H Nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (400 MHz) {{was used in}} the context of food surveillance to develop a reliable analytical tool to differentiate brands of cola beverages and to quantify selected constituents of the soft drinks. The preparation of the samples required only degassing and addition of 0. 1 % of TSP in D 2 O for locking and referencing followed by adjustment of pH to 4. 5. The NMR spectra obtained can be considered as “fingerprints ” and were analyzed by principal component analysis (PCA). Clusters from colas of the same brand were observed, and significant differences between premium and discount brands were found. The quantification of caffeine, acesulfame-K, aspartame, cyclamate, benzoate, hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), sulfite <b>ammonia</b> <b>caramel</b> (E 150 D), and vanillin was simultaneously possible using external calibration curves and applying TSP as internal standard. Limits of detection for caffeine, aspartame, acesulfame-K, and benzoate were 1. 7, 3. 5, 0. 8, and 1. 0 mg/L, respectively. Hence, NMR spectroscopy combined with chemometrics is an efficient tool for simultaneous identification of soft drinks and quantification of selected constituents...|$|E
40|$|Caramel is a brown {{to black}} liquid or solid having the {{characteristic}} odor of burn sugar and a pleasant bitter taste. It is prepared by heat treatment of carbohydrate {{in a process}} called caramelization. The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate the effect of temperature, pH, types of catalyst and also time taken to complete caramelization process for glucose. In this research, glucose was used to prepare two different classes of caramel (class III and class IV). Class III is prepared by adding ammonia to glucose and class IV by adding ammonia and sodium sulfite to glucose. Different preheating temperature ranged between (70 - 100) °C and different pH values ranged between (5 - 9) were investigated to find the optimum preheating temperature and pH values for caramelization reaction at 121 °C. The prepared caramel was characterized by measuring its absorbance using UV-VIS spectrophotometer at wavelength 510 nm and 610 nm. The higher absorbance reading was at preheating temperature 100 °C for both Ammonia and Ammonia Sulfite caramel. Result from the experiment showed that at alkaline condition, pH 8 give better results for both Ammonia and Ammonia Sulfite caramel compare to other pH. It also showed that Ammonia Sulfite caramel, at same condition with <b>Ammonia</b> <b>caramel</b> have darker color and higher absorbance reading...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} oral {{administration}} of THI, a compound present in <b>ammonia</b> <b>caramel</b> food colouring, was studied in spontaneous and induced murine diabetes mellitus. Continuous administration of THI at 400 ppm {{in drinking water}} reduced the prevalence of spontaneous diabetes in female NOD/Lt mice from 63 % in untreated controls to 8 % in treated animals. Since cyclophosphamide (CP) accelerates and intensifies diabetes in NOD mice, we also studied the effect of THI in this model. Diabetes incidence was reduced from 100 % in mice given only CP to 13 - 14 % in mice given THI either concurrently or from 14 days previously. Histologically, THI greatly reduced the severity of insulitis. As measured by flow cytometry, all THI-treated mice had a 60 - 80 % reduction in splenic CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells. THI-treated mice showed no untoward effects and specifically no weight loss, or pathological changes in their livers, kidneys or lungs. However, there was moderate atrophy of the thymus cortex. THI is a small imidazole-containing compound with structural similarity to histamine and urocanic acid, both known to have immunosuppressive properties. It is a widely used food additive with no known long-term toxic effects at low dosage. Thus, THI could be a useful immunosuppressive agent...|$|E
40|$|THI is a {{component}} of <b>ammonia</b> <b>caramel,</b> a widely used food colouring. The effect of THI on the immune system has been determined in the male F 344 rat. THI was given in the drinking water at doses of 1, 10 and 50 mg/l (equivalent to 0. 1, 1 and 5 mg/kg per day) to animals on a vitamin B 6 -deficient diet. After 1 week, the immune competence of the animals was assessed under continued THI treatment. No marked changes in thymus or spleen weight were observed after THI treatment, although there was an increased number of pyknotic cells in the thymic cortex, mainly engulfed by macrophages and {{there appeared to be}} a slight thinning of the cortex area. THI produced a significant loss in T and B lymphocytes in peripheral blood but not in the spleen. No change in natural killer (NK) cell activity against YAC- 1 target cells was observed in the spleen. The observed increase in NK cell activity in peripheral blood was due to an increase in circulating large granular lymphocytes (LGL). Although the serum antibody titre against keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH) was not affected by THI treatment, B cells showed less proliferation when cultured with lipopolysaccharide. T cell function was impeded as measured in mitogen-induced proliferation assay, delayed-type hypersensitivity assay and host versus graft (popliteal lymph node) assay. The results indicate that THI is an immunosuppressor in the rat, in whom it can produce profound lymphopenia and suppression of cell-mediated immunity...|$|E
40|$|The {{primary role}} of the thymus is to provide mature T cells for the {{peripheral}} immune system. The mechanisms involved in the cellular export processes are as yet unknown. In this study, we examined the ability of 2 -acetyl- 4 -tetrahydroxybutylimidazole (THI), an agent widely used {{as a component of}} <b>ammonia</b> <b>caramel</b> food colouring, to inhibit T-cell export from the thymus. BALB/c mice were maintained on drinking water containing THI for 5 days. The mice showed a twofold increase in the total number of mature medullary thymocytes (CD 4 +CD 8 - and CD 4 -CD 8 +) as well as a slight decrease in the total number of immature double-positive cells (CD 4 +CD 8 +). The mature single-positive thymocytes were found to express high levels of the homing molecule L-selectin, suggesting that these potential emigrants were prevented from leaving the thymus. To confirm this, THI-treated mice were injected intrathymically with fluorescein isothiocyanate and the number of labelled T cells appearing in the lymph nodes and spleen was determined 16 hr later. A 10 -fold {{decrease in the number of}} CD 4 + and CD 8 + recent thymic emigrants in the lymph nodes and spleen of THI-treated mice was observed. Previous studies have shown that THI does not affect other aspects of thymocyte development, such as proliferation and differentiation. Taken together, these results suggest that the immunosuppressive effects of THI may be due, in part, to preventing of the final step of T-cell export out of the thymus...|$|E
