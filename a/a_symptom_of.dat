5|$|Individuals with neuroacanthocytosis {{also often}} suffer from parkinsonism, the {{uncontrolled}} slowness of movements, and dystonia, abnormal body postures. Many affected individuals also have cognitive (intellectual) impairment and psychiatric {{symptoms such as}} anxiety, paranoia, depression, obsessive behavior, and pronounced emotional instability. Seizures may also be <b>a</b> <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> neuroacanthocytosis.|$|E
5|$|Fey {{is also a}} {{supporter}} of Mercy Corps, a global relief and development organization, in their campaign to end world hunger. Fey narrated a video for Mercy Corps's Action Center in New York City, describing hunger as <b>a</b> <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> many wider world problems. She also supports the Love Our Children USA organization, which fights violence against children, who named her among their Mothers Who Make a Difference, in 2009. She was the 2009 national spokesperson for the Light the Night Walk, which benefits the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society.|$|E

5|$|Foreign bodies, {{especially}} {{small pieces}} of hay or straw, can become lodged {{in the eyes of}} guinea pigs, resulting in excessive blinking, tearing, and in some cases an opaque film over the eye due to corneal ulcer. Hay or straw dust can also cause sneezing. While it is normal for guinea pigs to sneeze periodically, frequent sneezing may be <b>a</b> <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> pneumonia, especially in response to atmospheric changes. Pneumonia may also be accompanied by torticollis and can be fatal.|$|E
5|$|The Church {{has also}} {{addressed}} {{stewardship of the}} natural environment, {{and its relationship to}} other social and theological teachings. In the document Laudato si', dated 24 May 2015, Pope Francis critiques consumerism and irresponsible development, and laments environmental degradation and global warming. The pope expressed concern that the warming of the planet is <b>a</b> <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> a greater problem: the developed world's indifference to the destruction of the planet as humans pursue short-term economic gains.|$|E
5|$|They {{maintained}} that the potassium tartrate used in his treatment prevented his stomach from expelling these compounds and that his thirst was <b>a</b> <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> the poison. Their hypothesis was that the calomel given to Napoleon became an overdose, which killed him and left extensive tissue damage behind. According to a 2007 article, the type of arsenic found in Napoleon's hair shafts was mineral, the most toxic, and according to toxicologist Patrick Kintz, this supported the conclusion that he was murdered.|$|E

5|$|Abnormalities of behavior, {{also called}} {{abnormalities}} of activity, include observations of specific abnormal movements, {{as well as}} more general observations of the patient's level of activity and arousal, and observations of the patient's eye contact and gait. Abnormal movements, for example choreiform, athetoid or choreoathetoid movements may indicate a neurological disorder. A tremor or dystonia may indicate a neurological condition or the side effects of antipsychotic medication. The patient may have tics (involuntary but quasi-purposeful movements or vocalizations) which may be <b>a</b> <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> Tourette's syndrome. There are a range of abnormalities of movement which are typical of catatonia, such as echopraxia, catalepsy, waxy flexibility and paratonia (or gegenhalten). Stereotypies (repetitive purposeless movements such as rocking or head banging) or mannerisms (repetitive quasi-purposeful abnormal movements such as a gesture or abnormal gait) may be a feature of chronic schizophrenia or autism.|$|E
5|$|Abra's initial role in {{the show}} was that of Third World rights {{champion}} and humorous surgical , whose major storylines centered on serious rule breaking (including stealing returned anti-retroviral drugs to send to African countries in need, performing an experimental xenotransplantation without authorisation, and secretly using Holby City Hospital's theatres at night to perform charity operations on African children) {{as well as his}} relationship with colleague nurse Kyla Tyson. Upon returning to the show in April 2008, the character took a darker turn, resorting to self-harm as <b>a</b> <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> post-traumatic stress, following a harrowing experience in the war torn Congo.|$|E
5|$|In July 1977, Marley {{was found}} to have a type of {{malignant}} melanoma under the nail of a toe. Contrary to urban legend, this lesion was not primarily caused by an injury during a football match that year, but was instead <b>a</b> <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> the already-existing cancer. Marley turned down his doctors' advice to have his toe amputated (which would have hindered his performing career), citing his religious beliefs, and instead the nail and nail bed were removed and a skin graft taken from his thigh to cover the area. Despite his illness, he continued touring and {{was in the process of}} scheduling a world tour in 1980.|$|E

5|$|In Linz, Kepler's primary {{responsibilities}} (beyond {{completing the}} Rudolphine Tables) were {{teaching at the}} district school and providing astrological and astronomical services. In his first years there, he enjoyed financial security and religious freedom relative to his life in Prague—though he was excluded from Eucharist by his Lutheran church over his theological scruples. It was also during his time in Linz that Kepler {{had to deal with}} the accusation and ultimate verdict of witchcraft against his mother Katharina in the Protestant town of Leonberg. That blow happening only a few years after Keplers excommunication is not seen as a coincidence but as <b>a</b> <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> the full-fledged assault waged by the Lutherans against Kepler.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, the {{movement}} has drawn many followers from {{the middle class and}} is most popular in commuter towns and urban areas. In Exporting the American Gospel: Global Christian Fundamentalism Steve Brouwer, Paul Gifford, and Susan Rose speculate that {{the movement}} was fueled by a prevailing disdain for social liberalism in the United States that began in the 1970s. Rosin argues that prosperity theology emerged because of broader trends, particularly American economic optimism in the 1950s and 1990s. Tony Lin of the University of Virginia has also compared the teaching to manifest destiny, the 19th-century belief that the United States was entitled to the West. Marvin Harris argues that the doctrine's focus on the material world is <b>a</b> <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> the secularization of American religion. He sees it as an attempt to fulfill the American Dream by using supernatural power.|$|E
5|$|Rabies {{has been}} linked with vampire folklore. Dr Juan Gómez-Alonso, a {{neurologist}} at Xeral Hospital in Vigo, Spain, examined this possibility in a report in Neurology. The susceptibility to garlic and light {{could be due to}} hypersensitivity, which is <b>a</b> <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> rabies. The disease can also affect portions of the brain that could lead to disturbance of normal sleep patterns (thus becoming nocturnal) and hypersexuality. Legend once said a man was not rabid if he could look at his own reflection (an allusion to the legend that vampires have no reflection). Wolves and bats, which are often associated with vampires, can be carriers of rabies. The disease can also lead to a drive to bite others and to a bloody frothing at the mouth.|$|E

5|$|Eighty {{percent of}} self-harm {{involves}} stabbing or cutting the skin {{with a sharp}} object. However, the number of self-harm methods are only limited by an individual's inventiveness and their determination to harm themselves; this includes burning, self-poisoning, alcohol abuse, self-embedding of objects, hair pulling, bruising/hitting one's self, scratching to hurt one's self, knowingly abusing over the counter or prescription drugs, and forms of self-harm related to anorexia and bulimia. The locations of self-harm are often areas {{of the body that}} are easily hidden and concealed from the detection of others. As well as defining self-harm in terms of the act of damaging the body, it may be more accurate to define self-harm in terms of the intent, and the emotional distress that the person is attempting to deal with. Neither the DSM-IV-TR nor the ICD-10 provide diagnostic criteria for self-harm. It is often seen as only <b>a</b> <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> an underlying disorder, though many people who self-harm would like this to be addressed.|$|E
5|$|In {{the absence}} of a {{standardized}} diagnosis system, many popular, informal classification systems or checklists, outside the DSM and ICD, were created out of clinical and parental experience within the field known as attachment therapy. These lists are unvalidated and critics state they are inaccurate, too broadly defined or applied by unqualified persons. Many are found on the websites of attachment therapists. Common elements of these lists such as lying, lack of remorse or conscience and cruelty do not form part of the diagnostic criteria under either DSM-IV-TR or ICD-10. Many children are being diagnosed with RAD because of behavioral problems that are outside the criteria. There is an emphasis within attachment therapy on aggressive behavior as <b>a</b> <b>symptom</b> <b>of</b> what they describe as attachment disorder whereas mainstream theorists view these behaviors as comorbid, externalizing behaviors requiring appropriate assessment and treatment rather than attachment disorders. However, knowledge of attachment relationships can contribute to the cause, maintenance and treatment of externalizing disorders.|$|E
