5000|$|The race {{restarted}} on lap 46. Harvick {{pulled to}} a five-second lead over Kyle Busch after 40 laps. After {{falling to the}} back on the restart for the speeding penalty, Hamlin was put down a lap by Harvick on lap 90. Jimmie Johnson made an unscheduled stop on lap 103 for an issue with the drive line. They couldn't fix it on pit road {{and he took the}} car to the garage. Following the race, he said that it was [...] "tough having a very inexpensive <b>axle</b> <b>seal</b> be the culprit and take your championship hopes away. It's racing. I’ve had mechanicals take me out of championships growing up that led to some success for myself and I’m sure helped me with a championship or two. It’s just part of racing. It just shows how critical everything is on a race team. And how important every component is and you can’t take anything for granted. Heartbreaking for sure, but I don’t know what else {{we can do about it}} we just have to go on and try to win races and close out the season strong.” Debris on the front stretch brought out the third caution of the race on lap 111. The debris came from the No. 83 car of Matt DiBenedetto. Harvick swapped the lead with Busch on pit road, but exited with the lead.|$|E
50|$|Radial shaft seals, {{also known}} as lip seals, are used to seal rotary elements, such as a shaft or {{rotating}} bore. Common examples include strut seals, hydraulic pump <b>seals,</b> <b>axle</b> <b>seals,</b> power steering seals, and valve stem seals. Early radial shaft seals utilized rawhide as the sealing element, and many elastomeric seal companies today once were tanneries. The advent of modern elastomers replaced rawhide, industry also added a garter spring which helps the sealing lip compensate for lip wear and elastomer material changes.|$|R

5000|$|The motors {{were located}} in two four-axle bogies, with {{wheelset}} having a <b>sealed</b> <b>axle</b> mounted [...] electric motor; giving a Do-Do wheel arrangement. Braking was by Westinghouse air brakes, with disc brakes fitted on all wheels. The locomotive was a cab forward design.|$|R
50|$|STEMCO {{manufactures}} {{a variety}} of high-performance wheel-end, steering, suspension and braking components used by the heavy-duty trucking industry. Its products are generally used on commercial tractor-trailers and include hub oil <b>seals,</b> <b>axle</b> fasteners, hub caps, wheel bearings, mileage counters, king pin kits, suspension kits, brake friction, lightweight brake drums, foundation brake parts and automatic brake adjusters.|$|R
50|$|The Australian Marinas {{were built}} from CKD kits sent from Cowley in England, but used {{high levels of}} local content, {{including}} different running gear, <b>axle,</b> interiors, <b>seals,</b> seats, uprated dampers and mounts, uprated wheels and a higher grade of fit and finish. The Marina Six used a separate front sub-frame to support {{the weight of the}} Big Red engine and different front torsion bars as well as a pair of rear radius arms in an attempt to improve handling. Base model featured a 3-speed manual gearbox —sourced locally from Borg-Warner—to meet local content requirements. The Borg-Warner automatic was, however, the variation most popular in the local market.|$|R
2500|$|The {{elementary}} {{mechanical components}} of a machine are termed machine elements. [...] These elements consist of three basic types (i) structural components such as frame members, bearings, <b>axles,</b> splines, fasteners, <b>seals,</b> and lubricants, (ii) mechanisms that control movement in various ways such as gear trains, belt or chain drives, linkages, cam and follower systems, including brakes and clutches, and (iii) control components such as buttons, switches, indicators, sensors, actuators and computer controllers. [...] While generally {{not considered to be}} a machine element, the shape, texture and color of covers {{are an important part of}} a machine that provide a styling and operational interface between the mechanical {{components of a}} machine and its users.|$|R
40|$|This thesis has {{the overall}} {{objective}} {{to develop the}} optimum sealing system between the retarder and transmission. Today, there is a pressure-relief and two radial seals separation between the retarder and transmission. It {{has been found that}} carbon residue formation may occur between retarder <b>axle</b> and <b>seal</b> lips with, in some cases, leakage as a result. We have in this thesis tried to explain the phenomenon of carbon residue, how it is formed and why it can be seen just on the seals? A rig test was conducted where we show how friction, speed, transmission temperature and mitigation phases of the retarder affects temperatures in the sealing environment. Factors affecting the coke structure are reported, together with proposals for measures that provide a mitigating seal environment. The material is PTFE, which is standard in the seals today; we believe meets all requirements for the sealing material. The final recommendation is a tripartite cooperation between Scania, a petroleum company and an additive manufacturer where the different base oils and additive tested as multi-factorial experiments to identify what gives the best results. On transmission side we recommend to ensure a constant oil flow to the seal...|$|R
