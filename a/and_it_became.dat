5|$|After the Restoration of Charles II, the pre-war {{owners of}} the {{property}} laid claim to Clifford's Tower, eventually being granted ownership. A garrison continued to be stationed there, however, which prevented the owners from actually occupying or using the property. Repairs {{were made to the}} tower, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> a magazine for storing gunpowder and shot. Attempts were made to restore the condition of the moat, which had become badly silted. Some political prisoners continued to be held at the castle during the Restoration period, including George Fox, the founder of the Society of Friends.|$|E

5|$|Another of Paco de Lucía's {{contributions}} was {{the inclusion}} of the cajón, an Afro-Peruvian instrument Caitro Soto exposed to him during his visit to Peru in the late 1970s. He understood this instrument, which he saw as a permanent solution to the need for percussion in flamenco. Along with Rubem Dantas, he added its percussive elements <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> an essential tool of contemporary flamenco and later, other international musical trends.|$|E
5|$|As {{technology}} improved, {{measurement of}} depth, {{latitude and longitude}} became more precise <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> possible to collect more or less continuous sets of data points. This allowed researchers to draw accurate and detailed maps of {{large areas of the}} ocean floor. Use of a continuously recording fathometer enabled Tolstoy & Ewing in the summer of 1947 to identify and describe the first abyssal plain. This plain, south of Newfoundland, is now known as the Sohm Abyssal Plain. Following this discovery many other examples were found in all the oceans.|$|E

When the group reached Balincarin, they had accumulated nearly 50carts. Despite the convenience of using the carts, the carabao traveled at a sluggish pace, only , which greatly reduced the speed of the return trip. By the time the group reached American lines, 106carts were being used.|$|E

5|$|Before it {{was founded}} in 1810 by Lewis Tregonwell, the area was a deserted {{heathland}} occasionally visited by fishermen and smugglers. Initially marketed as a health resort, the town received a boost when it appeared in Augustus Granville's 1841 book, The Spas of England. Bournemouth's growth truly accelerated {{with the arrival of the}} railway <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> a recognised town in 1870. Historically part of Hampshire, it joined Dorset with the reorganisation of local government in 1974. Since 1997, the town has been administered by a unitary authority, meaning it is independent of Dorset County Council, although it remains part of that ceremonial county. The local council is Bournemouth Borough Council.|$|E

Bomis laid off most of its employees to continue operating, since Wikipedia was not generating revenue. The company owned Wikipedia from its creation through 2003, and Wales used about $100,000 of Bomis' revenue to fund Wikipedia before the decision to shift the encyclopedia to non-profit status.|$|E

Nearby South Bend experienced continued growth following the Civil War, and became a large manufacturing city centered around the Oliver Farm Equipment Company, the nation's leading plow producer. Gary was founded in 1906 by the United States Steel Corporation as the home for its new plant.|$|E

5|$|Chatwin {{published}} The Songlines in 1987, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> a bestseller in {{both the}} United Kingdom and the United States. The book was nominated for the Thomas Cook Travel Award, but Chatwin requested that it be withdrawn from consideration, saying the work was fictional. Following its publication, Chatwin became friends with composer Kevin Volans, who was inspired to base a theatre score on the book. The project evolved into an opera, The Man with Footsoles of Wind (1993).|$|E

As {{a result of}} his work, Patagonia experienced an increase in tourism, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>became</b> a common sight for tourists to appear in the region, carrying a copy of In Patagonia. The Songlines also inspired readers to travel to Australia and seek out the people Chatwin had based his characters on, much to their consternation, as he had failed to disclose to these individuals his intentions.|$|E
5|$|Cienfuegos led electors {{that were}} part of the {{imperial}} party in an attempt to elect Giulio Piazza. Piazza was almost elected on May 13, but was short by four votes.

Albani did not support this because he had not been a part of the negotiations despite being the original elector to suggest Piazza, and undermined his election by proposing Vincenzo Orsini as an alternate candidate.|$|E
