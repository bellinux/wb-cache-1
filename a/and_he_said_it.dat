25|$|A {{second major}} {{educational}} issue which arose during Chavous' third term was {{another round of}} reform aimed at the D.C. Board of Education. On September 24, 2003, Mayor Williams announced that the city's public school system was so dysfunctional and provided such low-quality education that he was introducing legislation to strip the Board of nearly all its power. Control over the school system would {{be given to the}} mayor, who would have the right to hire and fire the superintendent, principals, teachers, and other workers and who would gain significant new powers to reconstitute programs, operations, curriculum, and schools. Although Chavous was working on his own bill to give the Council and mayor more power over the school system, he immediately threw his support behind Williams' plan. But little action on the mayor's plan had been taken by January 2004. Chavous argued that Williams had not been forceful enough in making the case for his proposal, and journalist Craig Timberg linked Chavous' lack of activity on the measure to a reluctance to take on a controversial issue in an election year. (Chavous' own bill was also delayed, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> would not be ready until at least March 2004.) Williams said he might seek a third term as mayor merely to fight for his school reform bill, if the council did not act more expeditiously. In February 2004, Chavous announced he no longer supported the mayor's bill. The school district was without a superintendent, and Chavous argued that no individual would want the job if the council was considering such a significant change to the position. He also said that giving the mayor hiring and firing authority over the superintendent would require congressional approval or a voter referendum, and both processes would take too long. Chavous then introduced a bill which largely undid the 2000 reforms. The new bill provided for a nine-member board, with eight elected members (one from each ward) and a president elected citywide. Chavous' committee approved the bill in April 2004 without a hearing. Although Mayor Williams submitted an altered form of his original proposal two weeks after the defeat, it was rejected in mid-May and the Chavous bill approved by the council in July on a close 7-to-6 vote.|$|E

Invited to Dylan's Woodstock {{home for the}} weekend to learn new material, Bloomfield recalled, [...] "The first thing I heard was 'Like a Rolling Stone'.

Nevertheless, he called the episode a true introduction to the series and considered the intertwining stories of Sam and his friends the series' premise. In 2010, Robin Raven from Yahoo! Voices called it one of her top five Cheers episodes. In 2011, Austin Lugar from The Film Yap website called it the [...] "best". IGN ranked it number nine of the top ten Cheers episodes.|$|E

On May 2, he re-entered the top10 at No. 10. Raonic continued the clay court season with a second-round loss at the Italian Open to Kyrgios. At the French Open, he was the eighth seed, but fell in the fourth round in straight sets to world No. 55 Albert Ramos Viñolas. During the French Open, former world No. 1 and 3-time Wimbledon champion John McEnroe {{announced that he would}} join Raonic's team as a consultant for the grass court season. Commenting on McEnroe joining Moyá and Piatti on his coaching team, Raonic said: [...] "I was sort of just looking for another set of eyes to be a bit more efficient on grass" [...] <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> was about [...] "generally improving."

500|$|At {{the start}} of the 1992 season, Zolak also looked {{unlikely}} to appear, being behind Hodson and Millen on the depth chart. Millen started the first five games before being injured, and then Hodson became the starter. In early November, Zolak made his professional debut in the fourth quarter against the New Orleans Saints. Relieving Hodson, he completed five of nine passes and threw an interception as the Patriots lost, 3114. The next week, Zolak made his first career start when the still winless Patriots faced the Indianapolis Colts. He completed 20 of 29 passes for 261yards, two touchdowns, and an interception in the Patriots' first win of the season, 3734. As a result of his performance, he was named the American Football Conference (AFC) Player of the Week. The next week, Zolak led his team to their second victory of the season against the New York Jets. He completed seven of 16 passes for 102yards, getting help from Jon Vaughn who had 110 rushing yards, and the Patriots won, 243. However, the following week's performance against the Atlanta Falcons was less impressive. He completed nine of 16 passes for 58yards and two interceptions in the Patriots' losing effort, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> felt like he was [...] "on a desert island by myself." [...] After Zolak's performance against Atlanta, he lost the starting job, and Millen again filled that role. However, Millen suffered a shoulder injury against the Colts, and after Zolak played part of the game against Indianapolis, he again became the starter for the game against the Kansas City Chiefs. Zolak injured his ankle {{at the end of the}} third quarter, making the appearance against Kansas City his last for the season as Jeff Carlson took over quarterbacking duties. Zolak finished the season with 52 pass completions in 100 attempts, 561yards, two touchdowns, four interceptions, and a quarterback rating of 58.8.|$|E
500|$|James Caldwell, {{also of the}} Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter, {{published}} {{a review of the}} show in which he also gave ratings out of 5 stars and some comments on the top matches on the card. He considered the main event [...] "underwhelming" [...] due to the [...] "audience having sat through every possible gimmick match combination prior to another Joe-Booker bout that everyone knew was going to end with some sort of gimmicky finish" [...] and that it was [...] "not memorable" [...] but that it would [...] "generate talk about Jarrett." [...] He gave the bout 2 stars. [...] "That was an epic match", said Caldwell when discussing the Last Man Standing match. However, he felt the bout had a [...] "silly pin-and-count-'em stipulation" [...] and that the [...] "all-too-real neck injury angle, followed by some post-match activity that took away from Styles's win." [...] Caldwell felt the match made Styles look [...] "like a star when he won, then he came across like a punk attacking Angle, then a fool being in position for Sting to take him out" [...] but that he had a [...] "memorable, star-making victory over Angle." [...] He disapproved of Styles being [...] "used a means to the end of explaining Sting's purpose-driven TNA life." [...] Caldwell rated the encounter 4 stars. As for the Street Fight, {{he said it was a}} [...] "fun brawl for the audience" [...] and gave it 2 1/2 stars. Caldwell believed that the World Tag Team Championship match had [...] "good heat" [...] that [...] "over-rode the stream of outside interference, referee incompetence, and overall over-booking" [...] and that it was [...] "refreshing to see TNA use an injury angle from TV to set-up the finish of an important PPV match." [...] He gave the match 3 stars. The X Division Championship match was given 3 stars <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> would have been [...] "great" [...] if it had avoided involving [...] "outside interference." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the Preliminary Final against Sydney FC, the Phoenix lost 4–2 in {{controversial}} circumstances. After {{being locked}} at 1–1 through goals from Chris Payne for Sydney and Andrew Durante for Wellington, Payne apparently missed a header and deflected {{the ball into}} the goal off his hand. Andrew Durante, who was marking Payne went straight over to the linesman, but the goal stood. [...] "I went straight to the linesman. I knew 100 per cent it was handball. I spoke to the ref at halftime about it <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> wasn't deliberate. It's pretty funny that one. Such a big game and such a big occasion, for something like that to change the game is very disappointing." [...] Sydney FC strikers Alex Brosque and Mark Bridge both scored break-away goals as Phoenix pushed forward. Eugene Dadi then added a late consolation goal. Phoenix striker Chris Greenacre said that it changed the dynamics of the game. [...] "It just rips the heart out of you. We got back in the game with a good goal and that takes it away from you. It wasn't to be. I think we were right back in it. They played some good football but I thought we had withstood it OK. If we went into halftime [...] we were really confident we could get something out of it." [...] Coach Ricki Herbert echoed those statements. The loss brought the end to the Phoenix's season, meaning that Melbourne Victory and Sydney FC would compete in the Grand Final.|$|E

2500|$|... “There were a {{great many}} cowboys with the show. [...] There was a chief of the cowboys who had general {{supervision}} over both horses and men. [...] When an unbroken horse would be brought in, this cowboy chief would give it to an Indian to ride bareback. [...] After the animal was well broken, it would {{be taken away from}} the Indian and given to a cowboy to ride. [...] Then the Indian would be given another unbroken horse. [...] For a while we said nothing about it, but finally it began to be just a little too much to stand. [...] One day one of the Indians came to me just before it was time to enter the arena. [...] His horse was saddled and bridled, but he was leading the horse by the bridle. [...] I asked him what was the matter, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> was a wild horse and {{he was not going to}} ride it into the arena. [...] I went to the chief cowboy and said, ‘I do not think you are doing right. [...] You know our Indian boys have to ride bareback, but you always give them the wild horses to ride. [...] Then, when they have the horse nicely broken, you give to a cowboy. [...] Why don’t you give the wild horses to the cowboys to break in? [...] They ride on saddles, and it would not be so hard for them.’ [...] But the chief cowboy only said, “Well, I can’t be bothered by a little thing like that. [...] You will have to see Buffalo Bill about the horses.’ [...] But I retorted, “You know very well that Buffalo Bill does not know what you do with the horses. [...] He does not know that you give the wild ones to the Indian boys to ride until they are broken in. [...] Give that horse back to that Indian boy or he will not go into the arena today.’ [...] That was all, but the boy got his horse in time to enter the arena with the others. [...] Just as I was ready to go back to the Indians, I looked at Buffalo Bill, and he had a twinkle in his eye. [...] After that, we had no more trouble with the horses. [...] Although Buffalo Bill never said anything to me, I knew he had fixed things to our satisfaction.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The Wigwam was Chief Flying Hawk’s {{second home}} for nearly thirty years. Traveling with Wild West shows, pony riding, war dances and inclement weather weighed on Chief Flying Hawk’s health. Chief Flying Hawk could have rest and {{relaxation}} at The Wigwam. [...] Here he could rise with {{the morning sun}} {{for a walk in}} the forest, enjoy a breakfast of bacon and eggs, with fruit and coffee, smoke his redstone pipe and have a glass of sherry before retiring. Chief Flying Hawk, “refused to be sent to a bedroom, and asked to have the buffalo robes and blankets. [...] With them he made his couch on the open veranda floor, where he retired in the moonlight.” McCreight was impressed with Chief Flying Hawk’s grace and dignity, and described Chief Flying Hawk’s meticulous grooming. “The Chief was engaged in taking down his long hair-plaits in which were woven strips of otter fur. [...] From his kit sack he took his comb and bottle of bear’s oil and carefully combed and oiled his hair, made up new plaits, then applied a little paint to his cheeks, looked into a small hand-mirror, and was ready to answer questions. [...] His hair, now still reaching to his waist, was streaked with grey. [...] In reply to how Indians were able to retain their hair in such perfect condition, he said they didn't always retain it, sometimes they got scalped, but they prided themselves in caring for their bodies. He said that long ago Indians often had hair that reached the ground.” [...] However, even in the relaxed atmosphere of The Wigwam, there was a formality to the visits.
