2500|$|After {{an initial}} focus upon E1b1b as a Neolithic marker, {{a more recent}} study in January 2010, looked at Y haplogroup R1b1b, {{which is much more}} common in Western Europe. Mark Jobling said: [...] "We focused on the commonest Y-chromosome lineage in Europe, carried by about 110 million men, it follows a {{gradient}} from south-east to north-west, reaching almost 100% frequency in Ireland. We looked at how the lineage is distributed, how diverse it is in different parts of Europe, <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>old</b> it is." [...] The results suggested that the lineage R1b1b2 (R-M269), like E1b1b or J lineages, spread together with farming from the Near East. Dr Patricia Balaresque added: [...] "In total, this means that more than 80% of European Y chromosomes descend from incoming farmers. In contrast, most maternal genetic lineages seem to descend from hunter-gatherers. To us, this suggests a reproductive advantage for farming males over indigenous hunter-gatherer males during the switch from hunting and gathering, to farming".|$|E
