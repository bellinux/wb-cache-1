At this time electron microscopes were being fabricated for specific groups, such as the [...] "EM1" [...] device used at the UK National Physical Laboratory. In 1939 the first commercial electron microscope, pictured, was installed in the Physics department of IG Farben-Werke. Further work on the electron microscope was hampered by the destruction of a new laboratory constructed at Siemens by an air-raid, as well as the death of two of the researchers, Heinz Müller and Friedrick Krause during World War II.|$|E

2500|$|Harry Harlow drew {{condemnation}} for his [...] "pit of despair" [...] {{experiments on}} rhesus macaque monkeys at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in the 1970s. The <b>aim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> was {{to produce an}} animal model of clinical depression. Harlow also devised {{what he called a}} [...] "rape rack", to which the female isolates were tied in normal monkey mating posture. In 1974, American literary critic Wayne C. Booth wrote that, [...] "Harry Harlow and his colleagues go on torturing their nonhuman primates decade after decade, invariably proving what we all knew in advance—that social creatures can be destroyed by destroying their social ties." [...] He writes that Harlow made no mention of the criticism of the morality of his work.|$|E
2500|$|The {{so-called}} [...] "pit of despair" [...] {{was used}} in experiments conducted on rhesus macaque monkeys during the 1970s by American comparative psychologist Harry Harlow at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. The <b>aim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> was to produce clinical depression. The vertical chamber was a stainless-steel bin with slippery sides that sloped to a rounded bottom. A 3/8 in. wire mesh floor 1 in. above {{the bottom of the}} chamber allowed waste material to drop out of holes. The chamber had a food box and a water-bottle holder, and was covered with a pyramid top so that the monkeys were unable to escape. Harlow placed baby monkeys in the chamber alone for up to six weeks. Within a few days, they stopped moving about and remained huddled in a corner. [...] The monkeys generally exhibited marked social impairment and peer hostility when removed from the chamber; most did not recover.|$|E

30|$|Like the E/HF {{methods used}} to collect data, the {{analysis}} was largely qualitative. For the ergonomics assessment, <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> controls on postural and muscle fatigue was evaluated by analysing the objective force assessments in 3 -dimensional static strength modelling software. Further, the organisations’ own statistics associated with <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> injury in <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> their trams was reviewed and the physical loads in relation to injury causing factors were examined. These assessments identified target areas for changes to the physical cab. For the human factors work, data from the focus groups and informal interviews was transcribed and analysed {{with a number of}} techniques. Consistent with <b>the</b> <b>aims</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> and scope <b>of</b> this paper, we report specifically on results that were identified through a process of thematic analysis applied to data from both the ergonomics and human factors components. This is in order to generate clear themes that meet <b>the</b> <b>aims</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> and fulfil <b>the</b> objectives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> paper.|$|R
