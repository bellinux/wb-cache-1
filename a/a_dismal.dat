5|$|The 1992 World Cup, held in Australia and New Zealand, {{introduced}} {{many changes}} to the game, such as coloured clothing, white balls, day/night matches, and a change to the fielding restriction rules. The South African cricket team participated in the event for the first time, following {{the fall of the}} apartheid regime {{and the end of the}} international sports boycott. Pakistan overcame <b>a</b> <b>dismal</b> start in the tournament to eventually defeat England by 22 runs in the final and emerge as winners.|$|E
5|$|DiCaprio's first {{effort of}} 1995 was Sam Raimi's The Quick and the Dead, a western film. Sony Pictures was dubious over DiCaprio's casting, {{and as a}} result, co-star Sharon Stone decided to pay the actor's salary herself. The film was {{released}} to <b>a</b> <b>dismal</b> box office performance, barely grossing US$18.5 million in the US, and received mixed reviews from critics. DiCaprio next starred in Total Eclipse, a fictionalized account of the homosexual relationship between Arthur Rimbaud and Paul Verlaine. He replaced River Phoenix, who died during pre-production on the project. A minor art-house success, the film grossed US$0.34 million throughout its domestic theatrical run.|$|E
5|$|In his book, The World's Worst Warships, naval {{historian}} Antony Preston characterised the popovkas like this: But {{in other}} respects, they were <b>a</b> <b>dismal</b> failure. They were {{too slow to}} stem the current in the Dniepr, and proved very difficult to steer. In practice the discharge of even one gun caused them to turn {{out of control and}} even contra-rotating some of six propellers was unable to keep the ship on the correct heading. Nor could they cope with the rough weather which is frequently encountered in the Black Sea. They were prone to rapid rolling and pitching in anything more than a flat calm, and could not aim or load their guns under such circumstances.|$|E

5|$|People whose CT scan shows a large hematoma, {{depressed}} {{level of}} consciousness, or focal neurologic signs {{may benefit from}} urgent surgical removal of the blood or occlusion of the bleeding site. The remainder are stabilized more extensively and undergo a transfemoral angiogram or CT angiogram later. It is hard to predict who will have a rebleed, yet it may happen {{at any time and}} carries <b>a</b> <b>dismal</b> prognosis. After the first 24hours have passed, rebleeding risk remains around 40 percent over the subsequent fourweeks, suggesting that interventions should be aimed at reducing this risk as soon as possible. Some predictors of early rebleeding are high systolic blood pressure, the presence of a hematoma in the brain or ventricles, poor Hunt-Hess grade (III-IV), aneurysms in the posterior circulation, and an aneurysm >10mm in size.|$|E
5|$|Then came {{a decline}} in his career {{at such a young}} age which began soon after the arrival of new manager Alex Ferguson in November 1986, the change of manager coming after <b>a</b> <b>dismal</b> start to the season led to the {{decision}} to sack Ron Atkinson. Whiteside, still only 21, was facing trouble from his right knee which was now beginning to require serious medical procedures to prevent it from causing his retirement. Ferguson put Whiteside back up front, and in turn he scored three times in his first four games back from injury. Ferguson did though have to rebuke Whiteside after some of his numerous drinking sessions. He ended the 1986–87 season with 10 goals in 37 appearances, however United could only manage an 11th-place finish.|$|E
5|$|During the 2014–15 season, <b>a</b> <b>dismal</b> run of form saw {{the team}} slip {{to the bottom}} of the league table with only 19 points from 29 matches. By 3 April 2015, they were seven points adrift from safety. This could have brought a sudden end to Leicester's seven-year rise, but seven wins from their final nine league matches meant the Foxes {{finished}} the season in 14th place with 41 points. They finished the season with a 5–1 thrashing of relegated Queens Park Rangers. Their upturn in results was described as one of the Premier League's greatest ever escapes from relegation. They also became only the third team in Premier League history to survive after being bottom at Christmas (the other two being West Bromwich Albion in 2005 and Sunderland in 2014), and no team with fewer than 20 points from 29 matches had previously stayed up.|$|E

5|$|Aston Villa {{won their}} sixth FA Cup in 1920, soon after though the club began a slow decline {{that led to}} Villa, at the time {{one of the most}} famous and {{successful}} clubs in world football, being relegated in 1936 for the first time to the Second Division. This was largely the result of <b>a</b> <b>dismal</b> defensive record: they conceded 110 goals in 42 games, 7 of them coming from Arsenal's Ted Drake in an infamous 1–7 defeat at Villa Park. Like all English clubs, Villa lost seven seasons to the Second World War, and that conflict brought several careers to a premature end. The team was rebuilt under the guidance of former player Alex Massie for the remainder of the 1940s. Aston Villa's first trophy for 37 years came in the 1956–57 season when another former Villa player, Eric Houghton led the club to a then record seventh FA Cup Final win, defeating the 'Busby Babes' of Manchester United in the final. The team struggled in the league though and were relegated two seasons later, due in large part to complacency. However, under the stewardship of manager Joe Mercer Villa returned to the top-flight in 1960 as Second Division Champions. The following season Aston Villa became the first team to win the Football League Cup.|$|E

25|$|The opening {{stages of}} the 1993–94 season looked to be the turning point for Howard Kendall in his second spell as Everton manager, as they topped the Premier League after winning their opening three games. However, <b>a</b> <b>dismal</b> run of form {{followed}} {{over the next few}} weeks, and Kendall walked out on Everton in early December after they had plummeted down the league to occupy a mid table position. This was followed by <b>a</b> <b>dismal</b> run of form under caretaker manager Jimmy Gabriel, which saw Everton drop to the fringes of the relegation battle by mid-January.|$|E
25|$|In the strike-divided {{season of}} 1981, the Blue Jays {{finished}} {{in last place}} in the AL East in both halves of the season.
