However, the Highway94 association, {{as well as the}} Campo-Potrero and Highway80 chambers of commerce raised concerns about the safety of the children going to school in the buses along the road. In 1952, the Southern California committee of the state Chamber of Commerce recommended to the California Highway Commission that Route94 be widened to four lanes from the Wabash Freeway to Jamacha. In June1953, the Commission approved an eight-lane freeway for Route94 from Home Avenue in San Diego to Palm Avenue around La Mesa. The local Board of Education also gave their approval, which was required because the freeway would be built on land that was for a proposed school. But the next month, State Senator Fred Kraft criticized the proposal because he believed that it would be too expensive and would not reduce congestion in the long term. <b>Approval</b> <b>extended</b> to the junction with US80 by October 1953; [...] the part from 18th Street to Wabash Boulevard followed in November 1954. Later that year, a toll road that would have tunneled under the Laguna Mountains and bypassed Route94 was proposed by the county Board of Supervisors. The state allocated $3.48million (about $ in [...] dollars) for making SR94 a freeway from College Avenue to Campo Road in October1954.|$|E

50|$|At {{the end of}} March 2012, MVG {{announced}} that damage had occurred to the wheels of nine cars, where the rubber grommets between the tire and the wheel had cracked {{after a few weeks}} and had to be replaced. A commissioned report mentioned errors in the composition and the production of the rubber elements as a cause. The issue of definitive authorization, planned on April 1, 2012, was thereby halted. In order to keep the lines running , the planned conversion of the predecessor R series trains was delayed, and plans were drafted to borrow trams from other companies. The rubber parts were finally replaced in summer 2012, with the provisional <b>approval</b> <b>extended</b> by nine months, to approve the new parts. Following further software changes to the doors and air-conditioning systems, the final approval of the trams was postponed again from 31 May to 30 September 2013, when the trams received their final approval.

30|$|The idea of <b>approval</b> <b>extends</b> {{into the}} {{construct}} of image, {{as it applies to}} social influence. For example, image is defined as the degree to which using e-learning is thought to enhance one’s social status. Moore and Benbasat (1991) wrote that they considered image (or social status) {{one of the most important}} factors for innovation adoption. In Thailand’s collectivistic, group-oriented work culture, the concern about one’s image is even greater. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that the average ratings of all the predictors of this construct are rather negative. In other words, the students tend to believe that e-learning does not enhance the user’s reputation. The negative rating on image, therefore, may need to be further explored in future studies in order to understand the qualities of social status that could be influential when deciding to adopt e-learning within Thai culture.|$|R
