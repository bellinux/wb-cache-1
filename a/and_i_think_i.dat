Her novels, which {{journalist}} Lesley McDowell described as containing [...] "derring-do, dashing blades, and maids in peril", allowed readers {{to escape from}} the mundane and difficult elements of their lives. In a letter describing her novel Friday's Child, Heyer commented, [...] "'I think myself I ought to be shot for writing such nonsense. ...

500|$|The exact {{genre of}} Nightcrawler {{has been the}} subject of debate. While most critics agree that the film {{predominantly}} features thriller elements, other descriptions have been used, including dark comedy, drama, horror, and neo-noir. When asked about the film's genre, Gilroy stated: [...] "I see Nightcrawler as having genre elements in the sense that it’s a thriller. It also has some strong dramatic elements <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> understand the question as there's some really strong elements of drama." [...] Gyllenhaal particularly noted the comedic elements, commenting: [...] "Gilroy and I were laughing pretty much the whole movie." ...|$|E
500|$|Game Show Network (GSN) {{acquired}} {{the rights to}} air Press Your Luck in September 2001, and high viewership ratings prompted the network to order {{a revival of the}} series. Two pilots were taped on February 13, 2002: one with original Press Your Luck host Peter Tomarken and the other hosted by Todd Newton. Newton was ultimately chosen to host the show. Tomarken explained that he was asked to change his style of hosting, saying, [...] "It was terribly hurtful <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> was doomed before I did [...] I remember being told, 'No, no. Be nice. Be sure everybody likes you.' I took that advice with the pilot. I made the same mistake." [...] Tomarken also acknowledged that GSN wanted to employ a younger host in an effort to attract a younger audience.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by series creator Chris Carter and {{directed}} by Rob Bowman. Bowman was {{not a fan of}} the episode, saying [...] "The show proved to be much more difficult than I anticipated, and there wasn't enough time to shoot the show properly because we were so close to the Christmas break. I felt extremely pressured and frustrated, although there are things in it I love, particularly the banter between Mulder and Scully. But overall, I thought the show was very oblique. I don't feel that the characters ever {{knew what was going on}} and I don't think it is all that cool that kids are murdering people. I didn't feel like I was shooting an episode of the X-Files, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> let Chris Carter down a bit." ...|$|E

So it was really about that moment of choice and the dignity and acceptance between these two great warriors, rather than the actual detail of his actual death. That was actually a tonal choice as to how we saw that character." ...|$|E
500|$|Jackson stated {{several times}} that [...] "Billie Jean" [...] {{was based on the}} groupies he and his {{brothers}} encountered while part of The Jackson 5. [...] "Billie Jean is kind of anonymous. It represents a lot of girls. They used to call them groupies in the '60s." [...] He added: [...] "They would hang around backstage doors, and any band that would come to town they would have a relationship with, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> wrote this out of experience with my brothers when I was little. There were a lot of Billie Jeans out there. Every girl claimed that their son was related to one of my brothers."

500|$|Debate over Trescothick's {{place in}} the England squad {{continued}} amid an end-of-series reshuffle in the England batting lineup. This included the dropping of fellow opener Strauss from the one-day side, {{and the rise of}} Alastair Cook as a Test and ODI opener for England. Trescothick stated that he would see how he progresses before committing to the international scene: [...] "Of course I'd love to play for England again.... Clearly, if I want to continue my career I have to undertake another tour. But for now, if and when I get back to full fitness <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> am OK and ready to play, I'll make myself available for England."

500|$|A {{week before}} the final Cardiff played Ipswich Town in the 2011–12 Football League Championship – it was their last match before the final, which they lost 3–0. Cardiff had a few injury {{concerns}} ahead of the final. Captain Mark Hudson had a calf problem, while midfielder Stephen McPhail had missed Cardiff's last four matches as {{he was suffering from}} Sjögren's syndrome, an immune system disorder. Goalkeeper Heaton was also a doubt with a knock on his ankle, but he was considered likely to start the match. Cardiff manager Malky Mackay acknowledged that Liverpool went into the match as favourites, but he was confident his team could provide a shock: [...] "Obviously we are underdogs but we have a chance in the final, Maybe only a one in 10 chance but that's still a chance if you turn up motivated, fit and organised <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> can promise that." ...|$|E

[...] Jeff Comings of the Arizona Daily Star comments that [...] "William Fichtner {{is going to be the}} best actor on any show this season.

[...] "Nobody even told me I could bring a friend!" [...] "I had Doc Martens boots on, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> put the flower from the breakfast tray in my hair." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone was won over by her [...] "lovely" [...] performance while Vincent Canby of The New York Times noted that she and Robert Sean Leonard [...] "look right and behave with a certain naive sincerity, although they often seem numb with surprise at hearing the complex locutions they speak." [...] The film earned over $22million at the box office. She made three other films while at university. In 1994, she appeared as Christian Bale's love interest in Prince of Jutland, a film based on the Danish legend which inspired Shakespeare's Hamlet, and starred in the murder mystery Uncovered.

500|$|Kaladze {{was limited}} to just six league {{appearances}} and 11 total appearances in the 2003–04 season. In the next season, Kaladze played just 19 Serie A matches and five in the Champions League as Milan finished as runners-up in both competitions. He was an unused substitute in that season's Champions League final, where Milan lost on penalties to Liverpool after a 3–3 draw. He {{was said to be}} frustrated with his lack of first-team options and a move to Chelsea, in exchange for Hernán Crespo or for £4 million, was widely reported. Kaladze himself said, [...] "I have agreed everything with the Chelsea management. Now it is necessary to wait for them to reach an agreement with Milan <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> could become a Chelsea player next week." [...] Chelsea opted to sign Asier del Horno instead and Kaladze later declared himself [...] "glad" [...] that the deal fell through. On 30 June 2005, he extended his contract with Milan until 2010 and again on 4 September 2006, this time until 2011. In 2005–06, an injury to Paolo Maldini meant that Kaladze was moved back into the centre of defence, his favoured position. Milan finished third that season, although they would have finished second if there were no 2006 Italian football scandal which resulted in a 30-point deduction.|$|E
500|$|Director Michael Lange {{said that}} he [...] "liked the script very much, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> stayed fairly close to the {{original}} draft. I liked it because it had a good spookiness to it. To me, the intriguing part was the doctor's research into being able to reverse the aging process, which I wish we could have explored more." [...] Executive Producer Robert Goodwin considered the episode {{one of the most}} emotional episodes of the first season, due to the time spent working with Courtney Arciaga, the little girl with progeria. In a retrospective of the first season in Entertainment Weekly, the episode was rated a C, being called [...] "far-fetched" [...] and criticised for its unoriginal themes. Zack Handlen, writing for The A.V. Club, described it as [...] "sloppy, poorly edited" [...] and [...] "thoroughly unexciting", pointing out the [...] "forced" [...] nature of the supporting characters' past involvement with Fox Mulder. Matt Haigh, writing for Den of Geek, expressed mixed feelings over the episode, comparing it to Quincy, M.E. and stating that it [...] "just wasn't weird enough" [...] for an episode of The X-Files. [...] "Young at Heart" [...] has been cited, along with the fourth season episode [...] "Paper Hearts", as representing [...] "the supreme irony and the hidden agenda of the series"—in both cases, Mulder, directly through his work on the X-Files, puts information permanently beyond reach by killing those who hold it, showing that [...] "despite the fact that Mulder drives the car, he frequently ends up—and goes—nowhere".|$|E
500|$|The album's first song, [...] "Tired of Sex", {{written before}} {{the release of}} the Blue Album, has Cuomo {{describing}} meaningless sex encounters with groupies, reciting his list of encounters and wondering why true love eludes him. [...] "Across the Sea" [...] was inspired by a letter Cuomo received from a Japanese fan: [...] "When I got the letter, I fell in love with her. It was such a great letter. I was very lonely at the time, {{but at the same time}} I was very depressed that I would never meet her." [...] Second single [...] "The Good Life" [...] chronicles the rebirth of Cuomo after an identity crisis as an Ivy League loner. Cuomo, who felt isolated at Harvard, wrote the song after [...] "becoming frustrated with that hermit's life I was leading, the ascetic life. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> was starting to become frustrated with my whole dream about purifying myself and trying to live like a monk or an intellectual and going to school and holding out for this perfect, ideal woman. And so I wrote the song. And I started to turn around and come back the other way." [...] Lead single [...] "El Scorcho" [...] addresses Cuomo's shyness and inability to approach a girl while at Harvard; he explained that the song [...] "is more about me, because at that point I hadn't even talked to the girl, I didn't really know much about her." [...] The album's final single, [...] "Pink Triangle", describes a man who falls in love and wants to get married, but discovers the object of his devotion is a lesbian.|$|E

In {{an interview for}} Spin on February 11, 2011, Kesha announced she had co-written the song with Luke and Martin for Femme Fatale. She explained it was inspired by [...] "me imagining [...] and any female musician touring the world.

[...] On March 2, 2011, the single's cover art, in which Spears appears sitting on a couch in a sweater and heels, was posted at Deezer.com. This was followed by a 30-second snippet of the song, which appeared at Amazon.de.

500|$|I Am... World Tour was produced, directed, {{and edited}} by Beyoncé {{for her own}} {{production}} company Parkwood Pictures. It contains tour footage from 108 shows {{that took place in}} 78 cities, 32 countries, and 6 continents in the presence of 1.1 million fans around the world. The show is a combination of performance clips from the tour, as well as backstage moments. I Am... World Tour also serves as the directorial debut for Beyoncé. On this occasion, she confessed that {{it was a lot of}} work for her. Nevertheless, she was very happy and eager for her fans to see her DVD directed by herself. She explained, [...] "I'm so excited – this is my directorial debut. I am just thrilled that my fans are going to be in the theatre with me and I can't wait for everyone to see it. It took me nine months to edit because I wanted to show a little bit of each show, each performance on tour, and it was 116 shows, so you can only imagine how much work it was, [...] it was worth it." [...] At the New York City screening of the DVD, Beyoncé further explained that she was completely [...] "hands-on", deciding which moments made the final cut and which ones wound up on the cutting-room floor, stating, [...] "It was hard work. I learned so much. I have a new respect for directors <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> would like to do more of it." [...] Some of the behind-the-scenes footage were shot by Beyoncé on her laptop. The DVD captures concert footage from cities in Europe, Asia, South America, and the United States, all edited into one concert. However, I Am... World Tour was significantly recorded at London's larger O2 Arena, a few months after the I Am... Yours concert. A live CD of the concert, a behind-the-scenes documentary of her life along the tour and a 20-page book of exclusive photos are all included in the package. According to a press release, [...] "it is meant to create the ne plus ultra Knowles concert experience, seen from her perspective".|$|E
500|$|In September 2000, {{she joined}} the ABT Studio Company, which is ABT's second company, and {{became a member of}} its Corps de ballet in 2001. As part of the Studio Company, she {{performed}} the Pas de Deux in Tchaikovsky's The Sleeping Beauty. Eight months after joining the company, she was sidelined for nearly a year by a lumbar stress fracture. When Copeland joined the company, she weighed [...] (she is [...] tall). At age 19, her puberty had been delayed, a situation common in ballet dancers. After the lumbar fracture, her doctor told her that inducing puberty would help to strengthen her bones, and he prescribed birth control pills. Copeland recalls that in one month she gained 10 pounds, and her small breasts swelled to double D-cup size: [...] "Leotards had to be altered for me ... to cover my cleavage, for instance. I hated this sign that I was different from the others. ... I became so self-conscious that, {{for the first time in}} my life, I couldn’t dance strong. I was too busy trying to hide my breasts." [...] Management noticed and called her in to talk about her body. The professional pressure to conform to conventional ballet aesthetics resulted in body image struggles and a binge eating disorder. Copeland says that, over the next year, new friendships outside of ABT, including with Victoria Rowell and her boyfriend, Olu Evans, helped her to regain confidence in her body. She explained, [...] "My curves became an integral part of who I am as a dancer, not something I needed to lose to become one. I started dancing with confidence and joy, and soon the staff at ABT began giving me positive feedback again. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> changed everyone’s mind about what a perfect dancer is supposed to look like." [...] During her years in the corps, as the only Black woman in the company, Copeland also felt the burden of her ethnicity in many ways and contemplated a variety of career choices. Recognizing that Copeland's isolation and self-doubt were standing in the way of her talent, ABT's artistic director, Kevin McKenzie, asked writer and arts figure Susan Fales-Hill, then vice-chair of ABT's Board of Directors, to mentor Copeland. Fales-Hill introduced Copeland to Black women trailblazers who encouraged Copeland and helped her to gain perspective.|$|E
