25|$|Snowâ€™s {{work and}} {{findings}} {{were related to}} both anaesthesia {{and the practice of}} childbirth. His experience with obstetric patients was extensive and used different substances including ether, amylene and chloroform to treat his patients. However, chloroform was the easiest drug to administer. He treated 77 obstetric patients with chloroform. He would apply the chloroform at the second stage of labour and controlled the amount without completely putting the patients to sleep. Once the patient was delivering the baby they would only feel {{the first half of the}} contraction <b>and</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> the border of unconsciousness but not fully there. Regarding administration of the anaesthetic, Snow believed that it would be safer if another person that was not the surgeon applied it.|$|E
25|$|The Home Defense League was {{established}} in New York City in 1916 under Police Commissioner Arthur Woods to supplement the police force.

25|$|Of {{the many}} roles {{available}} in the show, one of the longest-running and most coveted is being the host of Weekend Update, a segment which has alternated between having one or two hosts, and which allows the cast members involved to perform as themselves <b>and</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> camera {{for an extended period}} of time. Many of the Weekend Update hosts have gone on to find greater success outside the show, including: Chase, Curtin, Murray, Miller, Macdonald, Fey, Fallon, and Poehler. From 2008, Seth Meyers was the solo host of Weekend Update, before being partnered with Cecily Strong in 2013. After Meyers left for Late Night with Seth Meyers in February 2014, Strong was paired with head writer Colin Jost. The cast is divided into two tiers: the more established group of repertory players; and newer, unproven cast members known as featured players, who may eventually be promoted to the repertory stable.|$|E
25|$|In some cases, {{the writers}} {{had to work}} around the {{established}} characters and chronology from the comic series. In the first episode, for example, the player is introduced to Hershel Greene, who is established in the comics as a bitter character due to witnessing his son Shawn turn into a walker {{in the early stages}} of the outbreak. One of the first decisions the player makes is whether to save Shawn or Duck; however, either choice results in Shawn being bitten, so as to maintain the comic's continuity; only the manner in which he is bitten is changed. The major consequence aspect of the choice instead involves how Kenny feels towards Lee. In other cases, Telltale designed scenes and choices knowing how the majority of players would be predisposed to certain characters. One example is the character of Larry, who is introduced in the first episode as a hard-nosed jerk. Based on the statistical feedback, Telltale recognized that most players would want to either abandon or kill Larry at the first opportunity, and as such, they created a conversation tree in episode two where Lilly goes some way to redeem Larry in the eyes of the player. The idea was that this might influence the player when they must choose whether to help Kenny kill Larry, who may, or may not, have died from a heart attack <b>and</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> the verge of turning. Telltale found that 75% of the players now wanted to save Larry, a result they had expected.|$|E

500|$|Michael Schumacher {{admitted}} to having mixed feelings after the race, having been in second position until the race's last laps. The Mercedes driver stated: [...] "I would obviously have loved to finish there [...] <b>and</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> the podium again. But {{even if it did}} not work out in the very end, we can be happy about the result and the big fight we put in." [...] Kobayashi, placed second at the restart, shared similar feelings to Schumacher about finishing in a lower position: [...] "Originally I qualified 13th so then it is not bad to finish seventh, {{but on the other hand}} I started second after the long red flag and looking from there the result is disappointing." ...|$|E
500|$|The March 30, 1974, concert {{featured}} an ethnically and age-diverse {{audience that}} included young hippies and old, wealthy attendees. According to Magnet magazine's Bryan Bierman, [...] "the hip, 'with it' kids [...] side-by-side with middle-aged tuxedoed couples, expecting to hear 'My Funny Valentine.'" [...] Although he lived only 15 minutes away, Davis {{arrived at the}} venue {{more than an hour}} late. When the band walked out onstage, he followed with his back turned to the audience, casually strolling onstage while the other musicians were setting up. Davis immediately began to play, and the band responded by playing a dense rhythm in unison. Saxophonist Dave Liebman, writing in the 1997 US reissue liner notes for Dark Magus, recalled the start of the show: [...] "It is his whim [...]. That's the thing!... Miles can do that and have three thousand musicians follow him. Right? So what I learned in that respect from Miles was to be able to watch him <b>and</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> his case".|$|E
500|$|Greatest Hits (North America), Platinum Range (PAL territories) and The Best (Japan and Asia) are {{video games}} for the Sony PlayStation, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, and PlayStation Portable {{consoles}} that have been officially re-released {{at a lower price}} by Sony. Each region has its own qualifications to enter the re-release program. Initially, during the PlayStation era, a game had to sell at least 150,000 copies (later 250,000) <b>and</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> the market {{for at least a year}} [...] to enter the Greatest Hits range.

For the PlayStation Portable, games had to be on the market for at least 9 months with 250,000 copies or more sold. Currently, a PlayStation 3 game must be on the market for 10 months and sell at least 500,000 copies to meet the Greatest Hits criteria.
