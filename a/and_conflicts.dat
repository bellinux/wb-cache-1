40|$|Intergroup {{competition}} <b>and</b> <b>conflict</b> are pervasive {{problems in}} human society, {{giving rise to}} such phenomena as prejudice, terrorism, ethnic cleansing, and interstate war (Choi & Bowles, 2007; Fiske, 2002). This chapter reviews classic and contemporary theory and research on (a) the origins of intergroup competition <b>and</b> <b>conflict,</b> <b>and</b> (b) the way humans regulate intergroup competition <b>and</b> <b>conflict.</b> To some extent, this chapter builds on earlier analyses of interpersonal <b>and</b> small-group <b>conflict</b> (de Dreu, 2008, 2010 a; Tyler & Blader, 2003). Although interpersonal and small-group competition <b>and</b> <b>conflict</b> share critical features with intergroup competition <b>and</b> <b>conflict,</b> the latter includes structural features and psychological mechanisms not present in the former. Specifically, intergroup competition <b>and</b> <b>conflict</b> operate at two distinct yet closely intertwined levels of analysis: that {{of the individual and}} that of the group to which one belongs (henceforth, the in-group). Intergroup competition <b>and</b> <b>conflict</b> thus represents an amalgam of individual self-interests, values, and beliefs that converge into and are informed by group interests, values, and beliefs, and both the individual and group-level interests, values, and beliefs are shaped by and instrumental to the intergroup competition <b>and</b> <b>conflict...</b>|$|R
40|$|Markets {{exist within}} {{a world of}} {{constant}} exchanges which {{form the basis for}} changes and the creation of new markets. Therefore, it is important to research these exchanges. One of the areas in which market creation can be observed is interorganisational collaborations, as firms increasingly collaborate to create markets. In market creation practice, however, interorganisational tension <b>and</b> <b>conflict</b> can form from divergent approaches and vested interests of the partners. Interorganisational tension represents the opposing intentions of interorganisational forces, <b>and</b> <b>conflict</b> is generated through disagreements. The aim of this research is to investigate interorganisational tension <b>and</b> <b>conflict</b> on market creation practice. Specifically, it attempts to: (i) expand interorganisational tension <b>and</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>and</b> provide insights to these concepts, as well as establishing a two-dimensional interorganisational tension (productive and unproductive) understanding, (ii) explore the interactions between interorganisational tension <b>and</b> <b>conflict,</b> (iii) develop a conceptual framework that explains the level of market creation depending on the effects of interorganisational tension <b>and</b> <b>conflict,</b> (iv) develop a typology of partnering firms based on interorganisational tension <b>and</b> <b>conflict</b> practice. To achieve this aim, and to respond to the research calls, this study follows a grounded theory approach which intends to expand the understanding of interorganisational tension <b>and</b> <b>conflict.</b> According to the findings, a major characteristic of interorganisational tension is its two dimensions: productive and unproductive. However, it is the intertwined nature of tension <b>and</b> <b>conflict</b> that influences market creation. Fundamental to these are the six interorganisational tension <b>and</b> three <b>conflict</b> types revealed by the findings of this study. The core theoretical contributions of the study are a dynamic framework that portrays the dynamic interactions between interorganisational tension <b>and</b> <b>conflict</b> on market creation practice, and a typology of market-creating partnering firms. Collectively, they explicate the development of market creation practice, and firms’ reactions to interorganisational tension <b>and</b> <b>conflict...</b>|$|R

5|$|African {{elephants}} {{are listed}} as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) while the Asian elephant is classed as endangered. One of the biggest threats to elephant populations is the ivory trade, as the animals are poached for their ivory tusks. Other threats to wild elephants include habitat destruction <b>and</b> <b>conflicts</b> with local people. Elephants are used as working animals in Asia. In the past, they were used in war; today, they are often controversially put on display in zoos, or exploited for entertainment in circuses. Elephants are highly recognisable and have been featured in art, folklore, religion, literature, and popular culture.|$|E
5|$|Churchmen such as Erasmus and Luther {{proposed}} {{reform to}} the Church, {{often based on}} humanist textual criticism of the New Testament. In October 1517 Luther published the 95 Theses, challenging papal authority and criticizing its perceived corruption, {{particularly with regard to}} instances of sold indulgences. The 95 Theses led to the Reformation, a break with the Roman Catholic Church that previously claimed hegemony in Western Europe. Humanism and the Renaissance therefore played a direct role in sparking the Reformation, as well as in many other contemporaneous religious debates <b>and</b> <b>conflicts.</b>|$|E

40|$|Psychologists {{know that}} peace <b>and</b> <b>conflict</b> form the {{conditions}} within which psychological lives are actually lived, {{and that those}} lives make up social contexts of peace <b>and</b> <b>conflict.</b> Psychologists also share an understanding that peace <b>and</b> <b>conflict</b> are anything but simple. These little words “peace” and “conflict” are used to name very different and determining configurations of events in different places and times, and the naming of such configurations as peaceful or warlike is itself a social action that affects the social contexts so described. In his term as associate editor of Peace <b>and</b> <b>Conflict,</b> P. Hegarty aims to encourage new research that incorporates a reflexive understanding of psychologists’ work in naming, explaining, and intervening in peace <b>and</b> <b>conflict.</b> As a historian of psychology, he wants to insist on recognition that the peace <b>and</b> <b>conflict</b> that we study and our ways of studying them are historical. He urges new empirical research to examine contemporary peace <b>and</b> <b>conflict</b> {{as part of an}} “eventful psychology” that will be all the more impactful for the recognition that it is situated in history...|$|R
5|$|Food {{power is}} an {{integral}} part of the politics of food. The idea of food power is used in embargoes, employment, and food politics. In order for a nation to utilize food power effectively, the nation must effectively apply and display scarcity, supply concentration, demand dispersion, and action independence. The four main nations that export enough agriculture to be able to exert food power are the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. On the smaller scale, particularly in some African countries, food power has been used as a weapon by opposing sides in internal wars <b>and</b> <b>conflicts</b> against their own people.|$|E

5|$|Aboriginal Tasmanians {{have lived}} {{on the island of}} Tasmania for {{thousands}} of years. The earliest archaeological evidence for Aboriginal habitation of Tasmania is from the valley of the Forth River, 35,000 years before the present. Prior to European settlement, Chudleigh was part of the lands of the Pallittorre Aboriginal tribe. Their range included Deloraine, east of Chudleigh, and the Gog mountain range to the north-west where they mined ochre in the Toolumbunner ochre pits. The Pallittorre people lived in the area and used to have a camping ground, where the Church of England cemetery was established later. Land clearing, road construction, disease <b>and</b> <b>conflicts</b> with settlers drove them from their lands and decimated the population. Their population in the area has been estimated to drop from 200 to 60 during 1827-30. At the time of settlement the Chudleigh area was covered with bogs and wild bush.|$|E
