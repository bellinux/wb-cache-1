5|$|During this period, Poland was {{undergoing}} yet more upheaval: in 1978, John Paul II was elected Pope, providing a national figurehead of world importance; in 1980, the influential movement Solidarność was created, led by Lech Wałęsa; and in 1981, martial law was declared by General Wojciech Jaruzelski. From 1981–89, Lutosławski refused all professional engagements in Poland <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> of {{solidarity with the}} artists' boycott. He refused to enter the Culture Ministry to meet any of the ministers, and was careful not be photographed in their company. In 1983, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> of support, he sent a recording of the first performance (in Chicago) of the Third Symphony to Gdańsk to be played to strikers in a local church. In 1983, {{he was awarded the}} Solidarity prize, of which Lutosławski was reported to be more proud than any other of his honours.|$|E

His troops misunderstood his intention and mutinied at the town of Opis. They refused to be sent away and criticized his adoption of Persian customs and dress and the introduction of Persian officers and soldiers into Macedonian units.|$|E
5|$|Edward's body lay at Wareham for a {{year before}} being disinterred. Ælfhere {{initiated}} the reinterment, perhaps <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> of reconciliation. According {{to the life of}} Oswald, Edward's body was found to be incorrupt when it was disinterred (which was taken as a miraculous sign).

5|$|Since {{exiting the}} Premier League, Eddie Davies, the then {{owner of the}} club revoked his {{investment}} into the club. This led to published debts of almost £200m and bought the club very close to being wound up over unpaid tax bills owed to HMRC. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> of his goodwill and as incentive to sell the club, Davies promised to wipe over £125m of debt owed to him when the club was sold, which wiped {{a significant proportion of}} debt the club owed.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the spring}} of 2013, secret {{meetings}} were conducted between the United States and Cuba in the neutral locations of Canada and Vatican City.

5|$|The Union Jack {{flown by}} the ship hangs at Jutland in St Mary's Church, Nottingham. It was {{presented}} by Admiral Sir William George Tennant.

At Paterson Eastside High School, Doby was a multi-sport athlete; as well as playing baseball and basketball, he was a wide receiver in football and lettered in track. After winning a state football championship, the Eastside team was invited to play in Florida, but the promoters would not allow Doby, the only black player on the team, to participate. Consequently, the team voted to forgo the trip <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> of support for Doby.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Oppenheimer became {{chairman}} of the influential General Advisory Committee of the newly created United States Atomic Energy Commission. He used that position to lobby for international control of nuclear power to avert nuclear proliferation and a nuclear arms race with the Soviet Union. After provoking the ire of many politicians with his outspoken opinions during the Second Red Scare, he suffered the revocation of his security clearance in a much-publicized hearing in 1954, and was effectively stripped of his direct political influence; he continued to lecture, write and work in physics. Nine years later, President John F. Kennedy awarded (and Lyndon B. Johnson presented) him with the Enrico Fermi Award <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> of political rehabilitation.|$|E
5|$|During {{religious}} ceremonies, many adherents {{choose to}} wear clothing that imitates the styles of dress worn in Iron Age and Early Medieval Northern Europe. They also often wear symbols indicating their religious allegiance. The {{most commonly used}} sign among Heathens is Mjölnir, or Thor's hammer, which is worn as a pendant, featured in Heathen art, and used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> in ritual. It is sometimes used to express a particular affinity with the god Thor, although is also often used {{as a symbol of}} Heathenism as a whole, in particular representing the resilience and vitality of the religion. Another commonly used Heathen symbol is the valknut, used to represent the god Odin or Woden.|$|E

5|$|Witnessing his brother's death, Warwick {{knew the}} battle was lost. He made for the horses {{in an attempt to}} retreat. Edward {{recognised}} his victory was at hand, and—deciding that Warwick was more valuable alive than dead—sent the order and dispatched his guards to bring back the earl alive. Several chroniclers have suggested that the king thought Warwick would again be a valuable ally if persuaded back to the Yorkist cause. Historian Michael Hicks, on the other hand, suggests that Edward wanted to capture the earl for public execution rather than <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> of mercy. Regardless of the king's intent, Warwick died in the Lancastrian rout.|$|E
5|$|Abnormalities of behavior, {{also called}} {{abnormalities}} of activity, include observations of specific abnormal movements, {{as well as}} more general observations of the patient's level of activity and arousal, and observations of the patient's eye contact and gait. Abnormal movements, for example choreiform, athetoid or choreoathetoid movements may indicate a neurological disorder. A tremor or dystonia may indicate a neurological condition or the side effects of antipsychotic medication. The patient may have tics (involuntary but quasi-purposeful movements or vocalizations) which may be a symptom of Tourette's syndrome. There are a range of abnormalities of movement which are typical of catatonia, such as echopraxia, catalepsy, waxy flexibility and paratonia (or gegenhalten). Stereotypies (repetitive purposeless movements such as rocking or head banging) or mannerisms (repetitive quasi-purposeful abnormal movements such <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> or abnormal gait) may be a feature of chronic schizophrenia or autism.|$|E
5|$|Although David James {{remained}} as England's starting goalkeeper in a 2–2 draw against Austria {{in the first}} 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification match, Robinson started every subsequent match, keeping six clean sheets in nine competitive appearances, with a further three in seven friendly matches before the tournament. At the World Cup finals in Germany, Robinson was named in England's World Cup squad and was ever-present in England's campaign, keeping clean sheets in {{four out of five}} matches that he played. After the opening World Cup match against Paraguay, when his counterpart Justo Villar was injured seven minutes into the match, Robinson sent Villar his gloves <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> of goodwill. England had won the match 1–0. In addition to the clean sheet against Paraguay, he kept one in the group match against Trinidad and Tobago, although he drew criticism for making errors on crosses. Following England's progression from the group stage, he kept a clean sheet against Ecuador in the round of 16. He also kept a clean sheet in the following match, a quarter-final match against Portugal, although Portugal won 3–1 in a penalty shoot-out to eliminate England from the tournament.|$|E

5|$|Darius {{therefore}} began {{raising a}} huge new army {{with which he}} meant to completely subjugate Greece. However, he died before the invasion could begin. The throne of Persia passed to his son Xerxes I, who quickly resumed the preparations for the invasion of Greece, including building two pontoon bridges across the Hellespont. In 481 BC, Xerxes sent ambassadors around Greece asking for earth and water <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> of their submission, but making the very deliberate omission of Athens and Sparta (both of whom were at open war with Persia). Support thus began to coalesce around these two leading states. A congress of city states met at Corinth in late autumn of 481 BC, and a confederate alliance of Greek city-states was formed (hereafter referred to as 'the Allies'). This was remarkable for the disjointed Greek world, especially {{since many of the}} city-states in attendance were still technically at war with each other.|$|E
5|$|In March 1865, Irataba and the Mohave {{defeated}} the Chemehuevi after their allies, the Paiutes, killed two Mohave women. The Mohave pushed the Chemehuevi off their traditional territory {{and into the}} California desert, but they soon returned. To avoid fighting a two-front war, Irataba attacked the Chemehuevi first, then {{turned his attention to}} the Paiutes, who were planning an attack on the Mohave farm and granary on the Colorado's Cottonwood Island. During a subsequent battle with the Chemehuevi in October 1865, Irataba was taken prisoner while wearing his major general's uniform. According to a contemporary news report based on second hand accounts from white travelers, the captors feared that killing him would invite repercussions from the soldiers stationed at Fort Mohave, so they instead stripped him naked and sent him home badly beaten. In the Mohave account of the events as told by Chooksa homar, Irataba surrendered in an effort to make peace with the Chemehuevi, and offered his uniform to their chief <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> of peace. In 1867, a treaty signed by Irataba and the Chemehuevi leader Pan Coyer restored peaceful relations between the two nations.|$|E
5|$|The {{main effect}} of the aid package was to fuel a rapid {{expansion}} in the urban middle and upper class, while life remained mostly unchanged for South Vietnam's rural majority. This served to increase anti-government resentment among peasants, while solidifying urban support for the Saigon government. US officials {{were aware of the}} failure of the program to propel economic development, but did not try and divert the spending to investment as they regarded the solidification of urban support for the government to be very important. They also used the dependence of the urban class on the CIP to achieve political changes in South Vietnam. In 1963, when the US sought to pressure the government of Ngo Dinh Diem after the alliance began to falter, they cut off funding <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>gesture</b> to the urban civil servant and military officer class that they disapproved of Diem. Following the South Vietnamese leader's overthrow and assassination in a US-backed coup, the CIP resumed.|$|E
