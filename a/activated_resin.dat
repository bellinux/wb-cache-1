5000|$|Today's {{composite}} resins {{have low}} polymerization shrinkage and low coefficients of thermal shrinkage, which {{allows them to}} be placed in bulk while maintaining good adaptation to cavity walls. The placement of composite requires meticulous attention to procedure or it may fail prematurely. The tooth must be kept perfectly dry during placement or the resin will likely fail to adhere to the tooth. Composites are placed while still in a soft, dough-like state, but when exposed to light of a certain blue wavelength (typically 470 nm), they polymerize and harden into the solid filling (for more information, see Light <b>activated</b> <b>resin).</b> It is challenging to harden all of the composite, since the light often does not penetrate more than 2-3 mm into the composite. If too thick an amount of composite is placed in the tooth, the composite will remain partially soft, and this soft unpolymerized composite could ultimately lead to leaching of free monomers with potential toxicity and/or leakage of the bonded joint leading to recurring dental pathology. The dentist should place composite in a deep filling in numerous increments, curing each 2-3 mm section fully before adding the next. In addition, the clinician must be careful to adjust the bite of the composite filling, which can be tricky to do. If the filling is too high, even by a subtle amount, that could lead to chewing sensitivity on the tooth. A properly placed composite is comfortable, aesthetically pleasing, strong and durable, and could last 10 years or more. (By most North American insurance companies 2 years minimum) ...|$|E

Several studies {{have already been}} planned to study the factors affecting the bonding strength of artificial teeth to their denture acrylic base resin.

The key words applied for the search were acrylic, dentures, tooth, artificial, denture bases, bonding strength. Since 1952, a total of 54 relevant papers were selected. Conclusion: There is a wide variety in methodology of testing the samples for bond strength. Contamination with wax appears to be the major cause of bond failure between teeth and denture base resins. Also contamination with tin foil substitute seems to reduce bond strength.

40|$|A major {{challenge}} faced by dairy industries is {{the extraction of}} whey proteins from milk without pre-treatment, {{because of the presence}} of colloidal solids and the complex composition of milk. Various methods have been investigated to isolate whey proteins but other than the extraction of lactoferrin, none have been successful because of high processing costs and low product yield. To overcome some of these challenges, this thesis focused on the specific isolation of β-lactoglobulin, in particular without involving pre-treatment of the milk. Previous investigations showed β-lactoglobulin to be allergenic towards some infants and hence its removal from whey and milk was the main objective of this thesis. Isolating this protein from milk using a single-step extraction process has not been demonstrated previously. A Protein A Mimetic (PAM) ligand, originally designed for isolation of Immunoglobulin G from a variety of sources, was shown in previous unpublished work to have an unexpected affinity for β-lactoglobulin. In the current work, the equilibrium/static binding capacity of this PAM ligand immobilized on a chromatography resin was determined using varying concentrations of pure β-lactoglobulin in neutral aqueous solutions. An affinity chromatography resin was created by amine-coupling the ligand to an <b>activated</b> <b>resin</b> (N-hydroxysuccinimidyl-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow), and its equilibrium binding capacity was found to be 54. 11 + 0. 03 mg β-lactoglobulin/g wet, drained resin. PAM tetramer ligand showed some cross-reactivity with caseins and immunoglobulins, but the majority of these proteins were recovered in the regeneration step. The majority of the β-lactoglobulin was recovered during elution, with minor traces of α-lactalbumin and immunoglobulins. A novel, cost effective and scalable method was developed to isolate β-lactoglobulin from milk using an immobilized tetramer peptide ligand, which had previously shown high affinity towards β-lactoglobulin in the presence of other milk proteins. Previous research had shown that the peptide ligand maintained selectivity over a range of buffer pH values, but the optimum selectivity was found to be at pH 7. At buffer pH 7 and a conductivity of around 8 mS/cm, the affinity resin bound almost all β-lactoglobulin present in whey/milk, with only minor leakage in flowthrough fractions. An advantage to this process was the use of low salt during the elution process. Bound β-lactoglobulin was observed to elute at a buffer conductivity of 22 mS/cm. The results confirmed that β-lactoglobulin could be selectively removed from milk, thereby producing modified milk suitable for infant intake. In addition, β-lactoglobulin has uses in the confectionary and protein supplement industries and can be used as a gelling and foaming agent in functional foods. Suggestions for further work are expected to support development of this process and to provide a higher recovery of the bound protein, to minimize product loss...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of solid adsorbents for gas separation in pre-combustion carbon capture from gasification processes has gained attention in recent times. This {{is due to}} the potential of the technology to reduce the overall energy penalty associated with the capture process. However, this requires the development of solid adsorbent materials with large selectivity, large adsorption capacity, fast adsorption kinetics for CO 2 coupled with good mechanical strength and thermal stability. In this work, results on CO 2 adsorption performance of three different types of adsorbents; a commercial <b>activated</b> carbon, phenolic <b>resin</b> <b>activated</b> carbons and zeolite templated carbons have been reported at atmospheric and high pressures conditions. The commercial activated carbon was obtained from Norit Carbons UK, the phenolic <b>resin</b> <b>activated</b> carbon was obtained from MAST Carbon Ltd., while the templated carbons were synthesized in the laboratory. A commercial activated carbon was used as bench mark for this study. Surface modification of these carbons was also undertaken and their CO 2 uptake measurements at ambient and high pressure conditions were recorded. The commercial and templated carbons were modified by functionalising with amine group, while the phenolic resin carbon was modified by oxidation. The textural properties of the adsorbents was examined using the Micromeritics ASAP, while the CO 2 adsorption capacities were conducted using the thermogravimetric analyser (TGA) and the High pressure volumetric analyser (HPVA). Textural properties of synthesized templated adsorbents were seen to depend on the textural characteristics of the parent material. The β-type zeolite produced the carbons with the best textural property. Increase in activation temperature and addition of furfuryl alcohol (FA) enhanced the surface area of most of the templated carbons. The textural property of all the adsorbents under study was seen to differently affect the CO 2 uptake capacity at atmospheric (0. 1 MPa) and high pressure conditions (up to 4 MPa). Micropore volume and surface area of the commercial <b>activated</b> carbons, phenolic <b>resin</b> <b>activated</b> carbons, and the templated carbons greatly influenced the adsorption trends recorded at ambient conditions. Total pore volumes positively influenced adsorption trend for templated carbons, but not the phenolic <b>resin</b> <b>activated</b> carbons at ambient and high pressure. This also positively influenced the adsorption trend for the commercial activated carbons, but at ambient conditions only. The surface area and the micropore volume have no effect on the adsorption trends for the templated carbons and the commercial activated carbons at high pressure conditions. However, these played a positive role in the adsorption capacities of the phenolic <b>resin</b> <b>activated</b> carbons at the same experimental conditions. Micropore volume and surface area of adsorbents play a major role on the adsorption trends recorded for the modified adsorbents at ambient conditions only. No trend was recorded for adsorption capacities at high pressure conditions. Only the oxidized phenolic <b>resin</b> <b>activated</b> carbon showed a positive adsorption trend with respect to total pore volume at high pressure condition. The amine modified commercial activated carbon showed no positive adsorption trend with respect to the total pore volume at both ambient and high pressure conditions, while the amine modified templated carbon showed no adsorption trend with respect to the textural properties at ambient and high pressure conditions. CO 2 uptake measurements for the modified and unmodified templated carbon and phenolic resin carbon, were observed to be higher than those of the commercial activated carbon at ambient and high pressure conditions. Maximum CO 2 uptake was recorded at 25 oC. At ambient pressure, the phenolic resin carbon (MC 11) showed the highest CO 2 uptake of approximately 3. 3 mmol g- 1, followed by the commercial activated carbon (2. 4 mmol g- 1), then, the templated carbon (2. 4 mmol g- 1). At high pressure, the templated carbons (β-AC 7 - 2 %) showed the highest CO 2 uptake (21. 3 mmol g- 1), followed by phenolic resin carbon (MC 4 - 12. 2 mmol g- 1), and the commercial activated carbon (6. 6 mmol g- 1). When samples were modified, the amine modified templated carbon and oxidized phenolic resin carbon showed the highest CO 2 uptake of 2. 9 mmol g- 1 each at ambient pressure, followed by the commercial activated carbon (2. 7 mmol g- 1).

40|$|The {{potential}} of <b>activated</b> carbon fibre-phenolic <b>resin</b> composites for CO 2 capture has been evaluated in this work. A number of composites were fabricated using {{different types of}} carbon fibre under various conditions. The effect {{of a range of}} variables such as the type of carbon fibre, mass ratio of carbon fibre to phenolic resin, activation temperature and duration on the CO 2 adsorption capacity was investigated. Activated carbon derived from powdered phenolic resin demonstrates its capability to capture CO 2 and it plays {{a significant role in the}} low burn-off range. An apparent optimal degree of activation for CO 2 adsorption capacity was identified which was coincident with the maximum micropore volume measured by CO 2 physical adsorption. Micropore volume by CO 2 has been identified as a potential design parameter for the development of <b>activated</b> carbon fibre-phenolic <b>resin</b> composites for CO 2 capture. The existence of a cross-over regime is confirmed and lower burn-off samples are found to capture more CO 2 at ambient conditions. This is attributed to a narrow microporosity and a large contribution of micropore volume from smaller pores in the microporosity range of the composites. The optimal pore size for CO 2 capture becomes smaller when the relative pressure of CO 2 goes lowe...|$|R
40|$|Fossil fuel-fired power {{stations}} are large sources of CO 2. CO 2 capture from power station flue gas (i. e. post-combustion CO 2 capture) has been recognised {{as an important}} strategy for reducing CO 2 emissions. Currently, {{one of the major}} concerns regarding CO 2 capture is its significant cost. The solution is to improve the efficiency of current capture technologies and develop new cost-effective and environmentally friendly technologies. Therefore, this work presents the investigation of a novel CO 2 capture technique, electrothermal swing adsorption, which is promising to reduce CO 2 capture cost. The objectives of this thesis are to evaluate the possibility of utilising <b>activated</b> carbon fibre-phenolic <b>resin</b> composite as the adsorbent and to investigate and optimise operating conditions of electrothermal swing adsorption in order to reduce energy penalty for CO 2 capture. Activated carbon fibre materials have been widely investigated for volatile organic compounds removal. Only a few studies have been conducted for the purpose of CO 2 capture. Therefore, it is of great interest {{to examine the relationship between}} fabrication conditions and CO 2 adsorption capacity of <b>activated</b> carbon fibre-phenolic <b>resin</b> composite. It is found that activated carbon derived from phenolic resin also has the ability to capture CO 2. Conventionally, phenolic resin has a small proportion when mixed with carbon fibres to produce a composite and is supposed to play the role of binding material only. This implies that by carefully choosing carbon fibre and phenolic resin, adsorption performance of the composite can be improved. Traditionally, N 2 isotherm at - 196 ˚C has been widely employed to analyse the micro-structure of microporous materials. However, analysis by this thesis shows that CO 2 isotherm at 0 ˚C under sub-atmospheric pressure is more appropriate for the characterisation of <b>activated</b> carbon fibre-phenolic <b>resin</b> composites for CO 2 adsorption at low relative pressures. Micropore volume by CO 2 isotherm, which measures the volume of smaller micropores in the microporosity range, has been identified as a single design parameter for the development of <b>activated</b> carbon fibre-phenolic <b>resin</b> composite. This will greatly facilitate the future improvement of the composite for CO 2 capture at low relative pressures. <b>Activated</b> carbon fibre-phenolic <b>resin</b> composite demonstrates better CO 2 adsorption capacity than some sorbents, for example, granular activated carbon. Apart from this, another advantage is its ability to be shaped into any forms. In this work, it takes a honeycomb monolithic form, which enables the composite to have good attrition properties and low pressure drops and to be used in dust environments such as flue gas from coal fired power plants. The structure of honeycomb monolithic materials has been studied in catalysis systems. Very little effort has been made to explore the influence of monolithic structure on CO 2 adsorption performance of the composite. A theoretical model has thus been developed in order to study this influence. It has been found that two structural parameters void fraction and channel wall thickness are useful in designing the honeycomb monolithic structure of <b>activated</b> carbon fibre-phenolic <b>resin</b> composite. Consequently, the analysis results obtained by the model provide guidance in determining the optimal structure of the composite for CO 2 capture. By adopting the optimal structure, CO 2 adsorption performance of the composite can be greatly enhanced. The regeneration of the saturated adsorbent is conducted by passing through electricity. A few studies have been undertaken to study the effect of operating conditions on volatile organic compounds capture by electrothermal swing adsorption. Very rare studies have been conducted on the effect of operating conditions on CO 2 capture. Efforts have thus been made to systematically investigate and optimise operating conditions of electrothermal swing adsorption system to make it more energy efficient and competitive. Towards this goal, experimental results performed by this thesis have shown that energy input by electricity rather than current intensity has more significant influence on desorption performance of the composite. This decisively confirms the effect of electricity in electrothermal swing adsorption. In addition, the preheating step, which has been reported beneficial in volatile organic compounds capture by electrothermal swing adsorption, proves to be unnecessary under certain circumstances in CO 2 desorption by electrothermal effect. A theoretical model has also been built to predict desorption performance of the composite under various conditions and utilised to gain more insights into the influence of operating conditions. Current level has been found to have a direct impact on desorption performance. This has not been reported before. The results of this thesis show that <b>activated</b> carbon fibre-phenolic <b>resin</b> exhibits good CO 2 adsorption performance and demonstrates its suitability to be used as the adsorbent in ESA. Additionally, the effects of operating conditions of desorption by electrothermal effect have been investigated and energy efficiency of electrothermal swing adsorption system can be improved by optimising its operating conditions...|$|R
30|$|Although many {{technologies}} {{have been implemented}} to recover or eliminate phenolic compounds, such as coagulation, foam flotation, filtration, ion exchange, aerobic and anaerobic treatment, electrolysis, etc., an adsorption process is still regarded as the best alternative based on its performance [5]. Adsorption techniques employing solid adsorbent {{have been widely used}} to remove certain classes of chemical pollutants from wastewater, such as phenolic compounds. Richard et al. [6] demonstrated that various adsorbents are available as the choices of adsorbent used to remove phenolic compounds from effluents via adsorption process, such as <b>activated</b> sludge, <b>resins,</b> modified alumina and activated carbon. Among all those aforementioned, activated carbons (ACs) are the most popular adsorbents that were used due their adsorption ability for relatively low-molecular-weight organic compounds such as phenols. In particular, the effectiveness of adsorption on activated carbons is mainly due their structural characteristics and their porous texture which gives them a large surface area [7].|$|R
