40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} a novel way {{to speed up}} the evaluation time of <b>a</b> <b>boosting</b> classifier. We make a shallow (flat) network deep (hierarchical) by growing a tree from decision regions of <b>a</b> given <b>boosting</b> classifier. The tree provides many short paths for speeding up while preserving the reasonably smooth decision regions of the boosting classifier for good generalisation. For converting <b>a</b> <b>boosting</b> classifier into <b>a</b> decision tree, we formulate a Boolean optimisation problem, which has been previously studied for circuit design but limited to a small number of binary variables. In this work, a novel optimisation method is proposed for, firstly, several tens of variables i. e. weak-learners of <b>a</b> <b>boosting</b> classifier, and then any larger number of weak-learners by using a two-stage cascade. Experiments on the synthetic and face image data sets show that the obtained tree achieves a significant speed up both over <b>a</b> standard <b>boosting</b> classifier and the Fast-exit—a previously described method for speeding-up boosting classification, at the same accuracy. The proposed method as a general meta-algorithm is also useful for <b>a</b> <b>boosting</b> cascade, where it speeds up individual stage classifiers by different gains. The proposed method is further demonstrated for fast-moving object tracking and segmentation problems...|$|R

We propose a deep neural network integrated with <b>a</b> <b>boosting</b> framework composed of two sub-networks targeting feature extraction and similarity determination to perform the matching. The trained network is given as input a pair of slide image and a candidate video frame image and produces the similarity between them. <b>A</b> <b>boosting</b> framework is integrated into our proposed network during the training process. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is much more capable of handling occlusion, spatial transformations, and other types of noises when compared with known approaches.

5|$|Currency war, {{also known}} as {{competitive}} devaluations, is a condition in international affairs where countries seek to gain a trade advantage over other countries by causing the exchange rate of their currency to fall {{in relation to other}} currencies. As the exchange rate of a country's currency falls exports become more competitive in other countries, and imports into the country become more expensive. Both effects benefit the domestic industry, and thus employment, which receives <b>a</b> <b>boost</b> in demand from both domestic and foreign markets. However, the price increases for import goods (as well as in the cost of foreign travel) are unpopular as they harm citizens' purchasing power; and when all countries adopt a similar strategy, it can lead to a general decline in international trade, harming all countries.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, the {{rationing}} {{of petroleum}} fuels gave <b>a</b> <b>boost</b> to ridership on the electric tramways. To handle the massive increase in ridership, the trams were equipped with two conductors. The single-centre-door solution that worked excellently {{before the war}} became a bottle-neck as the trams became packed with riders. Lack of parts, particularly for the British Vickers motors, caused long waits for defective vehicles at the depots. From 1942, the Kolsås Line was transferred to terminate at Nationaltheatret in the city centre, and the Class B was operated along the Lilleaker Line from the west. Trams 164–166 were sent to Düsseldorf in Germany, but were never used because the city lacked balloon loops and the trams were too wide.|$|E

There was great national concern, and one of his fellow guests (Lord Chesterfield) died. Edward's recovery was greeted with almost universal relief.
