There has not been a lot of research done that has focused on the <b>health</b> <b>and</b> mental <b>health</b> wellbeing for Latinos here in the United States. Factors such as socioeconomic background, acculturation, healthcare insurance, and language barriers influence the <b>health</b> <b>and</b> mental <b>health</b> well being for the Latino community. This quantitative project explored several factors that influence the <b>health</b> <b>and</b> mental <b>health</b> wellbeing within the Latino Community. Findings indicated that Latino participants who were not acculturated nor had health insurance had poor <b>health</b> <b>and</b> mental <b>health</b> outcomes.

However, twenty years after the ICPD sexual <b>and</b> reproductive <b>health</b> <b>and</b> rights remain largely neglected in development initiatives. There are vast inconsistencies between knowledge, policy and practice in ensuring sexual <b>and</b> reproductive <b>health</b> <b>and</b> rights, which is primarily due to a lack of understanding of the social and structural contexts that inhibit sexual <b>and</b> reproductive <b>health</b> <b>and</b> rights. There are three broad examples of these contexts that can provide insight into why it is remarkably difficult to ensure sexual <b>and</b> reproductive <b>health</b> <b>and</b> rights in developing countries: cultural and religious factors, political will, and program capacity. Realizing how these contexts impact sexual <b>and</b> reproductive <b>health</b> <b>and</b> rights can help illuminate comprehensive strategies for the international community to consider in the effort to address sexual <b>and</b> reproductive <b>health</b> <b>and</b> rights in the post- 2015 development agenda.

5|$|Exposure to yttrium {{compounds}} in humans may cause lung disease. Workers exposed to airborne yttrium europium vanadate dust experienced mild eye, skin, and {{upper respiratory tract}} irritation—though this {{may be caused by}} the vanadium content rather than the yttrium. Acute exposure to yttrium compounds can cause shortness of breath, coughing, chest pain, and cyanosis. The Occupational Safety <b>and</b> <b>Health</b> Administration (OSHA) limits exposure to yttrium in the workplace to 1mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety <b>and</b> <b>Health</b> (NIOSH) recommended exposure limit (REL) is 1mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. At levels of 500mg/m3, yttrium is immediately dangerous to life <b>and</b> <b>health.</b> Yttrium dust is flammable.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the challenges faced in mainstreaming {{the teaching of}} sexual <b>and</b> reproductive <b>health</b> <b>and</b> rights into public health education. For this paper, we define sexual <b>and</b> reproductive <b>health</b> <b>and</b> rights education as including not only its biomedical aspects but also an understanding of its history, values and politics, grounded in gender politics and social justice, addressing sexuality, and placed within a broader context of <b>health</b> systems <b>and</b> global <b>health.</b> Using a case study approach with an opportunistically selected sample of schools of public health within our regional contexts, we examine the status of sexual <b>and</b> reproductive <b>health</b> <b>and</b> rights education {{and some of the}} drivers and obstacles to the development and delivery of sexual <b>and</b> reproductive <b>health</b> <b>and</b> rights curricula. Despite diverse national and institutional contexts, there are many commonalities. Teaching of sexual <b>and</b> reproductive <b>health</b> <b>and</b> rights is not fully integrated into core curricula. Existing initiatives rely on personal faculty interest or short-term courses, neither of which are truly sustainable or replicable. We call for a multidisciplinary and more comprehensive integration of sexual <b>and</b> reproductive <b>health</b> <b>and</b> rights in public health education. The education of tomorrow 2 ̆ 7 s public health leaders is critical, and a strategy is needed to ensure that they understand and are prepared to engage with the range of sexual <b>and</b> reproductive <b>health</b> <b>and</b> rights issues within their historical and political contexts...|$|R

5|$|A {{person can}} be exposed to uranium (or its {{radioactive}} daughters, such as radon) by inhaling dust in air or by ingesting contaminated water and food.

Houses or structures that are over uranium deposits (either natural or man-made slag deposits) may have an increased incidence of exposure to radon gas.
