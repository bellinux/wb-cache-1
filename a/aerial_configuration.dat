50|$|The {{weapon was}} 12 ft long, {{with a body}} {{diameter}} of 4 ft. It weighed 10,670 lb. It was carried only by the B-52 Stratofortress and B-47 Stratojet. It could be deployed in free-fall or <b>aerial</b> (parachute) <b>configuration,</b> and could be set for airburst, groundburst, or laydown delivery.|$|R
5000|$|A new frigate, the Type 61, was {{designed}} {{to carry out this}} role, however, it became clear that with a top speed of only 24 kn these ships {{would not be able to}} keep up with a carrier group. Consideration was therefore given to converting existing ships to carry out this role with carrier groups. The latest long range radar available at that time was the Type 965. The Radar Type 965 came with two <b>aerial</b> <b>configurations,</b> the AKE-1, known as [...] "the bedstead", and the AKE-2, known as [...] "the double bedstead". The AKE-1 weighed in at almost two tons and the AKE-2 at a massive four tons. It soon became clear that only a large ship, like a [...] "Battle" [...] class destroyer would be able to carry such a load.|$|R
2500|$|In its {{standard}} configuration, {{the aircraft}} utilizes {{conventional landing gear}} (two main wheels and a tail wheel). However, a number of aircraft have been converted to the Fire Boss <b>aerial</b> firefighting <b>configuration,</b> which utilizes Wipaire 10000 amphibious floats, {{so that it can}} land on a traditional runway or on water. The Fire Boss can scoop water from a lake or river for use on a fire. In addition to the [...] standard fuselage-mounted retardant tank, the Fire Boss can have optional [...] foam tanks in the floats. Operations with floats installed have been shown to produce a shorter and narrower retardant drop pattern than wheeled AT-802s.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Magnus {{effect is}} well known {{phenomena}} for producing high lift values from spinning symmetrical geometries such as cylinders, spheres, or disks. But, the Magnus force may also be produced by treadmill motion of aerodynamic bodies. To accomplish this, the skin of aerodynamic bodies may circulate with a constant circumferential speed. Here, a novel wing with treadmill motion of skin is introduced which may generate lift at zero air speeds. The new wing may lead to micro <b>aerial</b> vehicle <b>configurations</b> for vertical take-off or landing. To prove the concept, the NACA 0015 aerofoil section with circulating skin is computationally investigated. Two cases of stationary air and moving air are studied. It is observed that lift can be generated in stationary air although drag force is also high. For moving air, the lift and drag forces may be adopted between the incidence angles 20 ° to 25 ° where lift can posses high values and drag can remain moderate...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{elucidates}} {{the modeling}} of a + quadrotor <b>configuration</b> <b>aerial</b> vehicle {{and the design}} of its attitude and altitude controllers. The aircraft model consists of four fixed pitch angle propeller, each driven by an electric DC motor. The hovering flight of the quadrotor is governed by the Newton-Euler formulation. The attitude and altitude controls of the aircraft were regulated using heuristically tuned (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) PID controller. It was numerically simulated via Simulink that a PID controller was sufficient to bring the aircraft to the required altitude whereas {{the attitude of the}} vehicle is adequately controlled by a PD controller...|$|R
40|$|Extensive {{experimental}} and numerical investigations on a highly swept generic unmanned combat <b>aerial</b> vehicle (UCAV) <b>configuration</b> of lambda type with a variable leading edge contour have been conducted. Within these investigations {{it was shown}} that the flow field is dominated by complex vortex systems including vortex-to-vortex and vortex-to-boundary layer interactions. The vortex dominated flow field has a strong nonlinear influence on the aerodynamic behavior of the configuration. Hence, the controllability aspect is demanding and poses a real challenge {{in the design of}} this kind of configuration. Especially the dimensioning of the control surfaces for the lateral- and longitudinal stability aspects of tailless configurations of low aspect ratio and high leading edge sweep poses a challenging task, which is not yet solved. The present paper reviews the experimental aspects of the investigations. In order to understand the problem of lacking lateral- and longitudinal stability for these kind of configuration, experiments in the subsonic and transonic flow regime have been conducted for the SACCON configuration, which has a leading edge sweep of 53 ° in order to assess the control surface effectiveness of conventional trailing edge control devices. These investigations were undertaken as part of the internal DLR projects FaUSST and Mephisto...|$|R
40|$|SYSTEMS ENGINEERING CAPSTONE PROJECT REPORTApproved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe Department of the Navy (DoN) maintains {{an inventory of}} Small Tactical Unmanned Aircraft Systems (STUAS). These systems are designed for payload modularity to support user selection of multiple mission configurations {{in order to meet}} any unique mission need. Numerous mission ready payloads have been developed for each system, and only need to be integrated in order {{to become part of the}} fielded unmanned <b>aerial</b> system (UAS) <b>configuration.</b> Unfortunately, the DoN does not have a method that maintains sufficient systems engineering (SE) discipline to rapidly integrate and field new mission configurations to the fleet in support of aggressive schedules and urgent user needs. The typical fielding time frame can range from 24 to 36 months, instead of the desired 6 to 18 months. Furthermore, without a sufficient SE approach, risk to mission success is not well understood. This paper captures all applicable requirements for fielding a new capability onto an existing UAS, and using an SE approach, outlines a process to rapidly integrate payloads DoN system. The process identified provides a comprehensive list of integration requirements; a cost, schedule, and performance trade-off analysis; technical risk associated with each tradeoff option; and recommendations on how to best support a rapid fielding timeline...|$|R
40|$|Micro Coaxial Helicopter with {{compact size}} and {{vertical}} takeoff ability offers a good Micro <b>Aerial</b> Vehicle (MAV) <b>configuration</b> to handle indoor mission such as search, rescue and surveillance. An autonomous MAV helicopter equipped with micro vision devices could provide more information of the scene, {{in which the}} human present is risky. Toward an autonomous flight, mathematical model of the helicopter should be obtained before controller design takes place. This paper will discuss the mathematical modelling, simulation and identification of a micro coaxial helicopter. The mathematical model of the micro coaxial helicopter will be presented, in which total forces and moment are expressed as a Taylor series expansion as function {{of the state and}} control variables. The mathematical model will be used to simulate the helicopter responses due to control input. The simulation was used to obtain better understanding of the characteristics of the helicopter before flight test program are performed. Flight test program dedicated to identify the parameter of the micro coaxial helicopter have been carried out. The micro coaxial helicopter was instrumented with sensory system to measure some input and output variables. The use of Kalman filter to estimate the state and total least squares to estimate the aerodynamic parameter of micro coaxial helicopter based on the flight test data will be presented. Some identification results and model validation will be given in this paper...|$|R
40|$|The {{aerodynamics}} of the two-stage hypersonic SAeNGER {{transport system}} are examined {{by means of}} numerical integration of the preservation equations. First of all, a frictionless fluid is taken. The influence of interference between the HORUS and the ISIS aerial rudder units {{on the distribution of}} pressure in the ISIS aerial rudder unit is analyzed. Both a detailed parametrical study of a model geometry and the calculations for the actual <b>aerial</b> rudder- unit <b>configuration</b> show that there is only a low level of interaction between the flow fields of the HORUS and ISIS aerial rudder units. The subsequent investigations for the HORUS-ISIS separation procedure reveal that the dependence of the HORUS pitching moment on the relative angle of attack and gap width is different for a frictionless and viscose fluid. The differences are mainly caused in the impact boundary layer interaction which arose in the case of viscose flow. (orig.) Die Aerodynamik des zweistufigen hypersonischen Transportsystems SAeNGER wird durch numerische Integration der Erhaltungsgleichungen untersucht. Zunaechst wird fuer ein reibungsfreies Fluid der Einfluss von Interferenzen zwischen HORUS- und ISIS- Seitenleitwerk auf die Druckverteilung des ISIS-Seitenleitwerks analysiert. Sowohl eine ausfuehrliche Parameterstudie fuer eine Modellgeometrie als auch die Rechnungen fuer die reelle Seitenleitwerkkonfiguration zeigen, dass es lediglich zu einer geringen Wechselwirkung zwischen den Stroemungsfeldern der HORUS- und ISIS Seitenleitwerke kommt. Die anschliessenden Untersuchungen fuer den HORUS-ISIS Trennvorgang ergeben eine unterschiedliche Abhaengigkeit des Pitch Moments des HORUS vom relativen Anstellwinkel und von der Spaltweite fuer ein reibungsfreies und viskoses Fluid. Die Unterschiede werden vor allem durch die bei viskoser Stroemung vorhandene Stoss- Grenzschicht Wechselwirkung hervorgerufen. (orig.)
