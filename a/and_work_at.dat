5|$|After {{the birth}} of their daughter, Edith in 1896, Louema {{revealed}} that the father of both Edith and her older brother, Harvey (1893), was C. W. Post. Though Post offered him financial interest in La Vita Inn and his prospective famous breakfast drink, Postum, provided Beilhart he would stay <b>and</b> <b>work</b> <b>at</b> the Inn. Outraged at his friend's betrayal, Beilhart ordered Post out of his house and left Battle Creek for Ohio. Louema left Jacob and took the children back to her family in Kansas in 1897. This experience undoubtedly had a profound effect upon Beilhart's view of marriage.|$|E
5|$|In London, {{there was}} a great massing of the poor, and the Reformation {{threatened}} to eliminate some of the infrastructure used to provide for the poor. As a result, King Henry VIII consented to re-endow St. Bartholomew's Hospital in 1544 and St. Thomas’ Hospital in 1552 on the condition that the citizens of London pay for their maintenance. However, the city was unable to raise enough revenue from voluntary contributions, so it instituted the first definite compulsory Poor Rate in 1547 which replaced Sunday collections in Church with a mandatory collection for the poor. In 1555, London became increasingly concerned with the number of poor who could work, but yet could not find work, so it established the first House of Correction (predecessor to the workhouse) in the King’s Palace at Bridewell where poor could receive shelter <b>and</b> <b>work</b> <b>at</b> cap-making, feather-bed making, and wire drawing.|$|E

5|$|Many of his {{designs were}} never {{executed}} or were subsequently demolished or altered. His competition entries for cathedrals at Lille (1854), Adelaide (1856), Colombo, Brisbane (1859), Edinburgh (1873), and Truro (1878) were all unsuccessful. He lost out to George Edmund Street {{in the competition}} for the Royal Courts of Justice (1866–67) in The Strand. His plans for the redecoration of the interior of St Paul's Cathedral (1870–77) were abandoned and he was dismissed from his post. Skilbeck's Warehouse (1865–66) was demolished in the 1970s, <b>and</b> <b>work</b> <b>at</b> Salisbury Cathedral (1855–59), at Worcester College, Oxford (1873–79), and at Knightshayes Court had {{been lost in the}} decades before.|$|E
5|$|SvalSat {{is owned}} and {{operated}} by Kongsberg Satellite Services (KSAT), which is again equally owned by the Kongsberg Defence and Aerospace and the Norwegian Space Centre, the latter which is again owned by the Ministry of Trade and Industry. Of KSAT's 120 employees, 22 are stationed in Longyearbyen <b>and</b> <b>work</b> <b>at</b> SvalSat. KSAT is not tied to a particular operator of satellites and some of the antennas communicate with multiple satellites, thus reducing costs compared to dedicated ground stations. For a typical satellite, data is delivered to the end customer no more than 30 minutes after downloading.|$|E
5|$|The {{visual arts}} program {{includes}} drawing, painting, photography, sculpting, digital art, and art history. The program is highly structured, emphasizing technique {{and control over}} free expression, which has attracted criticism from the local art community. Art students receive individualized instruction, participate in art exhibits and competitions, undertake commissioned work, <b>and</b> <b>work</b> <b>at</b> in-house galleries and off-site exhibits. Most art majors take Advanced Placement art courses {{by the end of}} their sophomore year, and many attend pre-college programs at major universities between their high school years.|$|E

5|$|The welders {{who worked}} on the {{pipeline}} itself came from Pipeliners Local 798 out of Tulsa, Oklahoma, which specialize in providing welders for large-scale pipeline projects. Members of the United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing, Pipefitting and Sprinkler Fitting Industry of the United States and Canada performed all welding that was {{not a part of the}} pipeline itself, including pump stations, feeder pipelines, <b>and</b> <b>work</b> <b>at</b> the Valdez Marine Terminal. The welders were the highest paid of all the workers on the pipeline, with a normal rate of $18.25 per hour. To be hired on the pipeline project, welders had to go through an intensive certification process that involved a series of test welds. If a welder failed any of the test welds, he was not hired and was not allowed to try again for several weeks.|$|E
5|$|After the {{breakout}} of the First World War, Morton travelled to Labrador {{to work in}} the Mission Hospitals there, {{before being}} made a special commissioner of the Red Cross to take supplies from Paris to the Macedonian Front <b>and</b> <b>work</b> <b>at</b> the field hospitals in Macedonia. Following the success of her male family members, Morton was the first women to become the Attending Surgeon at the Vanderbilt Clinic of Columbia University's Physicians and Surgeons in 1916. After returning to New York Morton, alongside Mary M. Crawford, led the American Women's Hospitals Service from 1917 after it was founded by the Medical Women's National Association with the aim of establishing American hospitals in Europe. After her request to send one thousand medical women who had volunteered for foreign service was opposed by the General Medical Board in Washington, she raised over $300,000 in 10 days through a national fundraising drive to send them. At the recommendation of William C. Gorgas, Morton was made chairman of the committee of women physicians on the United States Council of National Defense, where she represented over 7000 female doctors.|$|E
5|$|Nixon {{was offered}} a tuition grant to attend Harvard University, but Harold's {{continued}} illness {{and the need for}} their mother to care for him meant Richard was needed at the store. He remained in his hometown and attended Whittier College, his expenses there covered by a bequest from his maternal grandfather. Nixon played for the basketball team; he also tried out for football but lacked the size to play. He remained on the team as a substitute and was noted for his enthusiasm. Instead of fraternities and sororities, Whittier had literary societies. Nixon was snubbed by the only one for men, the Franklins; many members of the Franklins were from prominent families, but Nixon was not. He responded by helping to found a new society, the Orthogonian Society. In addition to the society, schoolwork, <b>and</b> <b>work</b> <b>at</b> the store, Nixon found time for a large number of extracurricular activities, becoming a champion debater and gaining a reputation as a hard worker. In 1933, he became engaged to Ola Florence Welch, daughter of the Whittier police chief. The two broke up in 1935.|$|E

5|$|The IFC {{is governed}} by its Board of Governors which meets {{annually}} and consists of one governor per member country (most often the country's finance minister or treasury secretary). Each member typically appoints one governor and also one alternate. Although corporate authority rests with the Board of Governors, the governors delegate most of their corporate powers and their authority over daily matters such as lending and business operations to the Board of Directors. The IFC's Board of Directors consists of 25 executive directors who meet regularly <b>and</b> <b>work</b> <b>at</b> the IFC's headquarters, and is chaired by the President of the World Bank Group. The executive directors collectively represent all 184 member countries. When the IFC's Board of Directors votes on matters brought before it, each executive director's vote is weighted according to the total share capital of the member countries represented by that director. The IFC's Executive Vice President and CEO oversees its overall direction and daily operations. As of October 2012, Jin-Yong Cai serves as the Executive Vice President and CEO of the IFC. President of the World Bank Group Jim Yong Kim appointed Jin-Yong Cai {{to serve as the}} new Executive Vice President and CEO of the IFC. Cai is a Chinese citizen who formerly served as a managing director for Goldman Sachs and has over 20 years of financial sector experience.|$|E

25|$|The first uses of hydrox, a {{gas mixture}} of {{hydrogen}} and oxygen {{is used as a}} breathing gas in very deep diving are usually attributed to six ocean dive trials by the Swedish engineer, Arne Zetterström in 1945. Fife later showed that hydrox would allow divers to descend <b>and</b> <b>work</b> <b>at</b> great depths. Fife also developed the first decompression tables {{for the use of the}} mixture. The French engineering company COMEX (Compagnie maritime d'expertises) later applied Fife's work in developing their HYDRA dive series.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, Bayt Dajan was {{described}} as moderate-sized village surrounded by olive trees. Philip Baldensperger noted of Bayt Dajan in 1895 that:The inhabitants are very industrious, occupied chiefly in making mats and baskets for carrying earth and stones. They own camels for carrying loads from Jaffa to Jerusalem, cultivate the lands, <b>and</b> <b>work</b> <b>at</b> building etc., in Jaffa or on the railway works. The women flock every day to Jaffa and on Wednesday to Ramla—to the market held there, with chickens, eggs and milk.|$|E
25|$|The first {{economic}} summit, {{with the}} aim of discussing opportunities for greater collaboration within the Leeds city region, was in November 2004. Political leaders from Leeds, Barnsley, Bradford, Calderdale, Craven, Harrogate, Kirklees, Selby, Wakefield and York along with North Yorkshire, as well as representatives from other regional organisations took part. Delegates heard from speakers who presented the latest research on city regions as economic drivers. The need to engage in closer partnership <b>and</b> <b>work</b> <b>at</b> the city region level was recognised because it was emphasised that neither the city, or the larger region, is an appropriate spatial planning level at which to tackle issues of economic competitiveness.|$|E
