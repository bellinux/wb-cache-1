25|$|There {{has been}} much {{criticism}} of Kondrashov's theory, since it relies on two key restrictive conditions. The first requires {{that the rate of}} deleterious mutation should exceed one per genome per generation in order to provide a substantial advantage for sex. While there is some empirical evidence for it (for example in Drosophila and E. coli), there is also strong evidence against it. Thus, for instance, for the sexual species Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast) and Neurospora crassa (fungus), the mutation rate per genome per replication are 0.0027 and 0.0030 respectively. For the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the mutation rate per effective genome per sexual generation is 0.036. Secondly, there should be strong interactions among loci (synergistic epistasis), a mutation-fitness relation for which there is only limited evidence. Conversely, there is also the same amount of evidence that mutations show no epistasis (purely <b>additive</b> <b>model)</b> or antagonistic interactions (each additional mutation has a disproportionally small effect).|$|E
2500|$|Genetic studies, {{including}} twin studies, {{have proven}} {{that the overwhelming}} majority of cases of Tourette syndrome are inherited, although the exact mode of inheritance is not yet known. [...] Tic disorders have long been thought to be inherited as an autosomal dominant gene, but recent research challenges the autosomal dominant hypothesis, and suggests an <b>additive</b> <b>model</b> involving multiple genes. [...] According to Roger Freeman, MD, [...] "Genes that cause tics have not yet been identified; it's very unlikely there's just one. Tics are very familial, but not in a Mendelian pattern (dominant, recessive, etc.). You can't 'inherit' the committee decision to define a problem in a specific way, so TS itself can't be inherited. It's a tic disorder that is inherited." ...|$|E

40|$|We propose general {{procedures}} for posterior sampling from additive and generalized <b>additive</b> <b>models,</b> with applications to non-parametric, semi-parametric and mixed models. One chooses a linear operator S j for each predictor, and the algorithm requires only {{the application of}} S j and S 1 = 2 j. Both of these can be done applied efficiently (O(n) operations) for many popular operators. The procedure is a stochastic generalization of the backfitting algorithm for fitting <b>additive</b> <b>models.</b> Keywords: <b>additive</b> <b>models,</b> backfitting, Bayes, Gibbs sampling, random effects, Metropolis-Hastings procedure 1 Introduction In this paper we propose {{general procedures}} for posterior sampling from additive and generalized <b>additive</b> <b>models.</b> The main idea evolves from the close relationship between the backfitting algorithm for fitting <b>additive</b> <b>models,</b> and the Gibbs sampler for drawing realizations from a posterior distribution.

40|$|Sparse <b>additive</b> <b>modeling</b> is a {{class of}} {{effective}} methods for performing high-dimensional nonparametric regression. In this work we show how shape constraints such as convexity/concavity and their extensions, can be integrated into <b>additive</b> <b>models.</b> The proposed sparse difference of convex <b>additive</b> <b>models</b> (SDCAM) can estimate most continuous functions without any a priori smoothness assumption. Motivated by a characterization of difference of convex functions, our method incorporates a natural regularization functional to avoid overfitting and to reduce model complexity. Computationally, we develop an efficient backfitting algorithm with linear per-iteration complexity. Experiments on both synthetic and real data verify that our method is competitive against state-of-the-art sparse <b>additive</b> <b>models,</b> with improved performance in most scenarios.
