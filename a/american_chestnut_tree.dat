50|$|The private {{community}} was first established in 1935 {{as a summer}} colony for scientists by Flippo and Annie Gravatt. The founders of Scientist's Cliffs' chose this land because the population of <b>American</b> <b>Chestnut</b> <b>trees</b> showed a particular resistance to the blight. Original cabins in the area were built from felled <b>American</b> <b>Chestnut</b> <b>trees</b> that died from the blight. Although established as a seasonal community, the first year round resident moved to the community in 1943.|$|R
25|$|The {{climate of}} the park, and in turn also its flora and fauna, is largely typical for mountainous regions of the eastern Mid-Atlantic woodland, and indeed {{a large portion of}} common species are typical of {{ecosystems}} at lower altitudes as well. On southwestern faces of some of the southernmost hillsides pine predominates and there is also the occasional prickly pear cactus, which grows naturally. In contrast, some of the northeastern aspects are most likely to have small but dense stands of moisture loving hemlocks and mosses in abundance. Other commonly found plants include oak, hickory, chestnut, maple, tulip poplar, mountain laurel, milkweed, daisies, and many species of ferns. The once predominant <b>American</b> <b>chestnut</b> <b>tree</b> was effectively brought to extinction by a fungus known as the chestnut blight during the 1930s – though the tree continues to grow in the park, it does not reach maturity and dies back before it can reproduce. Various species of oaks superseded the chestnuts and became the dominant tree species. Gypsy moth infestations beginning in the early 1990s began to erode the dominance of the oak forests as the moths would primarily consume the leaves of oak trees. Though the Gypsy moths seem to have abated some, they continue to affect the forest and have destroyed almost 10 percent of the oak groves.|$|E

50|$|The {{mission of}} The American Chestnut Foundation (TACF) is {{to restore the}} <b>American</b> <b>chestnut</b> <b>tree</b> to the forests of Eastern North America by {{breeding}} genetically diverse blight-resistant trees, evaluating various approaches to the management of chestnut pests and pathogens, and reintroducing the trees into the forest in an ecologically acceptable manner. The <b>American</b> <b>chestnut</b> <b>tree</b> once comprised {{a quarter of the}} eastern hardwood forest from Maine to Georgia and west to the Ohio River Valley, providing a valuable economic resource in both timber and nuts, as well as an abundant food source for wildlife. An accidentally imported Asiatic chestnut blight decimated approximately four billion trees, with devastating results to Appalachian communities and economies.|$|E
5000|$|On May 18, 2006, a {{biologist}} with the Georgia Department of Natural Resources spotted {{a stand of}} several trees near Warm Springs, Georgia.

50|$|The larvae formed galls {{encircling}} young twigs of <b>American</b> <b>chestnut,</b> resembling {{in shape}} and size egg-masses of the forest tent caterpillar. The moth's synergistic relationship with the North American nut species led to a catastrophic population decline when {{almost all of the}} <b>American</b> <b>chestnut</b> <b>trees</b> fell victim to <b>chestnut</b> blight. The <b>American</b> <b>chestnut</b> was driven almost to extinction, and the <b>American</b> <b>chestnut</b> moth was driven completely to extinction.|$|R
5000|$|Two of {{the largest}} {{surviving}} <b>American</b> <b>chestnut</b> <b>trees</b> are in Jackson County, Tennessee. One, the state champion, has a diameter of 61 cm and a height of 23 m, and the other tree is nearly as large. One of them has been pollinated with hybrid pollen by members of The <b>American</b> <b>Chestnut</b> Foundation; the progeny will have mostly <b>American</b> <b>chestnut</b> genes and some will be blight resistant.|$|R
50|$|Problematic {{exotic disease}} {{introductions}} {{in the past}} century or so include the chestnut blight which has almost eliminated the <b>American</b> <b>chestnut</b> <b>tree</b> from its forest habitat. Responses to increase the population of the American chestnut include creating blight resistant trees that can be reintroduced. This displays both the positive and negative aspects of introduced species.|$|E
50|$|The {{pathogenic}} fungus Cryphonectria parasitica (formerly Endothia parasitica) is {{a member}} of the Ascomycota (sac fungi) taxon, and is the main cause of chestnut blight—a devastating disease of the <b>American</b> <b>chestnut</b> <b>tree</b> that in the early 1900s caused a rapid, widespread die-off of this once plentiful tree from its historic range in the eastern United States.|$|E
50|$|Cadillac is {{also known}} as Chestnut Town, USA.

50|$|Once an {{important}} hardwood timber <b>tree,</b> the <b>American</b> <b>chestnut</b> is highly susceptible to chestnut blight, {{caused by an}} Asian bark fungus (Cryphonectria parasitica, formerly Endothia parasitica) accidentally introduced into North America on imported Asiatic <b>chestnut</b> <b>trees.</b> The disease was first noticed on <b>American</b> <b>chestnut</b> <b>trees</b> {{in what was then}} the New York Zoological Park, now known as the Bronx Zoo, in 1904, by chief forester Hermann Merkel. Merkel estimated that by 1906 blight had infected 98 percent of the <b>chestnut</b> <b>trees</b> in the Bronx alone. While Chinese chestnut evolved with the blight and developed a strong resistance, the <b>American</b> <b>chestnut</b> had little resistance. The airborne bark fungus spread 50 mi a year and in a few decades girdled and killed up to three billion <b>American</b> <b>chestnut</b> <b>trees.</b> Salvage logging {{during the early years of}} the blight may have unwittingly destroyed trees which had high levels of resistance to this disease and thus aggravated the calamity. New shoots often sprout from the roots when the main stem dies, so the species has not yet become extinct. However, the stump sprouts rarely reach more than 6 m in height before blight infection returns.|$|R
50|$|Annie Gravatt (Annie Evelyn Rathbun) was an American forest pathologist. Her {{areas of}} {{research}} included plant physiology and white pine blister rust. She also studied Chestnut blight, the fungus that devastated <b>American</b> <b>chestnut</b> <b>trees</b> in the early 20th century. Along with her husband, George Gravatt, she founded the community of Scientists' Cliffs, Maryland.|$|R
5000|$|Infection of <b>American</b> <b>chestnut</b> <b>trees</b> with C. parasitica {{simultaneously}} {{appeared in}} numerous {{places on the}} East Coast, most likely from Castanea crenata, or Japanese chestnut, which had become popular imports. Japanese and some Chinese <b>chestnut</b> <b>trees</b> have some resistance to infection by C. parasitica: the infection usually does not kill these Asian chestnut species. Within 40 years the nearly four-billion-strong <b>American</b> <b>chestnut</b> population in North America was devastated [...] — only a few clumps of trees remained in California, Michigan, Wisconsin and the Pacific Northwest. Because of the disease, <b>American</b> <b>chestnut</b> wood almost disappeared from the market for decades, although it can still be obtained as reclaimed lumber.|$|R

50|$|Prodigal Summer {{tells the}} story of a small town in Appalachia during a single, humid summer, when three {{interweaving}} stories of love, loss and family unfold against the backdrop of the lush wildness of Virginia mountains. The narrative follows Deanna, a solitary woman working as a park ranger, Lusa, a recently widowed entomologist at odds with her late farmer husband's tight-knit family, and Garnett, an old man who dreams of restoring the lineage of the extinct <b>American</b> <b>Chestnut</b> <b>tree.</b>|$|E
50|$|A small playa (flat) area {{below and}} just to the {{southwest}} of the Joppa Mountain summit named Chestnut Flat was once home to a large population of American chestnut trees, {{some of which may}} have reached heights of up to 200 ft. The pathogenic fungus is the causal agent of chestnut blight, a devastating disease of the <b>American</b> <b>chestnut</b> <b>tree</b> that caused a mass extinction of this once plentiful tree by 1920 in Grainger County, and by 1940 from its historic range in the eastern United States.|$|E
5000|$|In rural Missaukee County, Michigan, a blight-free {{grove of}} <b>American</b> <b>chestnut</b> <b>trees</b> {{approximately}} 0.33 acre in size {{with the largest}} tree measuring 128 in in circumference (40 in diameter) has been located. It {{is believed to be}} the result of nuts planted by early settlers in the area. The <b>American</b> <b>Chestnut</b> Council, located in the local town of Cadillac, Michigan, has verified its identity and existence. Efforts have been initiated to protect the property from logging and development.|$|R
5000|$|The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 {{requires}} {{owners of}} abandoned coal mines to cover at least 80 {{percent of their}} land with vegetation. While many companies planted invasive grasses, others began funding research on planting trees, {{because they can be}} more cost-effective, and yield better results. Keith Gilland began planting <b>American</b> <b>chestnut</b> <b>trees</b> in old strip mines in 2008 as a student at Miami University, and to date has planted over 5,000 trees. In 2005, a hybrid tree with mostly American genes was planted on the lawn of the White House. [...] A tree planted in 2005 in the tree library outside the USDA building was still very healthy seven years later; it contains 98% <b>American</b> <b>chestnut</b> DNA and 2% Chinese <b>chestnut</b> DNA. This <b>tree</b> contains enough Chinese chestnut DNA that encodes for systemic resistance genes to resist the blight. This is essential for restoring the <b>American</b> <b>chestnut</b> <b>trees</b> into the Northeast. The Northern Nut Growers Association (NNGA) has also been active in pursuing viable hybrids. From 1962 to 1990, Alfred Szego {{and other members of the}} NNGA developed hybrids with Chinese varieties which showed limited resistance.|$|R
50|$|There are {{approximately}} 2,500 <b>chestnut</b> <b>trees</b> growing on 60 acres near West Salem, Wisconsin, {{which is the}} world's largest remaining stand of <b>American</b> <b>chestnut.</b> These <b>trees</b> are the descendants of those planted by Martin Hicks, an early settler in the area. In the late 1800s, Hicks planted less than a dozen chestnuts. Planted outside the natural range of <b>American</b> <b>chestnut,</b> these <b>trees</b> escaped the initial wave of infection by chestnut blight, but in 1987, scientists found blight also in this stand. Scientists are working {{to try to save}} the trees. There is a program to bring <b>American</b> <b>chestnut</b> back to the Eastern forest and funded by the <b>American</b> <b>Chestnut</b> Foundation, Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, USDA Forest Service, West Virginia University, Michigan State University, and Cornell University.|$|R
5000|$|The {{chestnut}} blight is a fungal infection affecting the <b>American</b> <b>Chestnut</b> <b>tree</b> {{that had a}} devastating economic and social impact on communities in the eastern United States. It later spread {{to other parts of}} the world including Italy. [...] The fungus is spread by wind-borne ascospores and, over a shorter distance, conidia distributed by rain-splash action. In the first half of the 20th Century it killed an estimated 4 billion trees. Infection is local in range, so some isolated American chestnuts survive where there is no other tree within 10 km. There are at least two viral pathogens that weaken the fungus through a mechanism termed hypovirulence that helps trees survive.|$|E
5000|$|The root {{collar and}} root {{system of the}} {{chestnut}} tree have some resistance to blight infection due to soil organisms adversely reacting to the fungus; consequently, {{a large number of}} small American chestnut trees still exist as shoots growing from existing root bases. However, these regrown shoots seldom reach the sexually reproductive stage before being killed by the fungus. They only survive as living stumps, or [...] "stools," [...] with only a few growing enough shoots to produce seeds. This is just enough to preserve the genetic material necessary to engineer an <b>American</b> <b>chestnut</b> <b>tree</b> using genes from any of the disease-immune Asiatic species to confer resistance to the disease.|$|E
5000|$|In March 2008, {{officials}} of the Ohio Department of Natural Resources announced a rare adult <b>American</b> <b>chestnut</b> <b>tree</b> had been discovered in a marsh near Lake Erie. The officials admitted they had known about the tree for seven years, but had kept its existence a secret. The exact location of the tree is still being held secret, both {{because of the risk}} of infecting the tree and because an eagle has nested in its branches. They described the tree as being 89 ft tall and having a circumference of 5 ft. The American Chestnut Foundation was also only recently told about the tree's existence.|$|E
50|$|A {{portion of}} the land within Moore State Park was once the home of at least five 18th- and 19th-century watermills that were powered by Turkey Hill Brook, which cascades 90 feet over a 400-foot run. The first mills on the site were a {{gristmill}} and sawmill built as early as 1747. Visible remnants of the mill village include a triphammer, quarry, schoolhouse, and tavern. In the early 20th century, the property became a private estate, large portions of which were subsequently included in the state park. In 2003, park staff working with the <b>American</b> <b>Chestnut</b> Foundation created a large plantation of experimentally bred <b>chestnut</b> <b>trees</b> as part of efforts to return blight-resistant <b>American</b> <b>chestnut</b> <b>trees</b> to the United States.|$|R
5000|$|The {{chestnut}} blight was accidentally introduced to North America around 1904 when Chryphonectria parasitica was {{introduced into the}} United States from Japanese nursery stock. Commonly known as the Chestnut blight, it was first found in the <b>chestnut</b> <b>trees</b> {{on the grounds of}} the New York Zoological Garden (the [...] "Bronx Zoo") by Herman W. Merkel, a forester at the Zoo. In 1905, American mycologist William Murrill isolated and described the fungus responsible (which he named Diaporthe parasitica), and demonstrated by inoculation into healthy plants that the fungus caused the disease. By 1940, most mature <b>American</b> <b>chestnut</b> <b>trees</b> had been wiped out by the disease.|$|R
5000|$|The plant {{pathology}} and ecology department works to expand knowledge of ecological interactions of plants, pathogens, and their environment to develop management strategies for plant pathogens with minimal use of pesticides. [...] Current research includes investigating {{the causes of}} Sudden Vegetation Dieback of coastal salt marshes; breeding blight-resistant <b>American</b> <b>chestnut</b> <b>trees</b> for timber and nut production; modeling epidemics of powdery mildew of grapevines, and investigating the genetic structure in natural populations of a fungus causing perennial cankers of birch. The department is also the official seed testing laboratory {{for the state of}} Connecticut.|$|R
