5|$|Deterioration of whale {{carcasses}} happens though <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> stages. Initially, moving organisms such as {{sharks and}} hagfish, scavenge the soft tissues {{at a rapid}} rate {{over a period of}} months, and as long as two years. This is followed by the colonization of bones and surrounding sediments (which contain organic matter) by enrichment opportunists, such as crustaceans and polychaetes, throughout a period of years. Finally, sulfophilic bacteria reduce the bones releasing hydrogen sulfide enabling the growth of chemoautotrophic organisms, which in turn, support other organisms such as mussels, clams, limpets, and sea snails. This stage may last for decades and supports a rich assemblage of species, averaging 185 species per site.|$|E
