5|$|The {{andesite}} lava of Ember Ridge comprises 55% brownish-green {{volcanic glass}} with a trachytic matrix of plagioclase. About 35% of Ember Ridge andesite contains phenocrysts of hornblende, <b>augite,</b> plagioclase and orthopyroxene and exist as isolated crystals and clots. A feature south of Ember Ridge, unofficially known as Betty's Bump, comprises andesite with phenocrysts of plagioclase, <b>augite</b> and olivine. Dark brown volcanic glass composes the Betty's Bump andesite {{as much as}} 20%. The relationship of Betty's Bump with Ember Ridge is unclear but it likely represents a separate volcanic feature due to its topographic isolation.|$|E
5|$|Andesite at Slag Hill {{consists}} of 70% dark brown volcanic glass with varied degrees of trachytic texture in the plagioclastic matrix {{and less than}} 5% of the andesite comprises vesicular textures. Plagioclase, hornblende and <b>augite</b> are mostly in form as phenocrysts and comprise 1% to 10% of the andesite. Orthoclase crystals are found occasionally and they likely represent xenocrysts.|$|E

The plagioclastic matrix is trachytic. <b>Augite,</b> biotite, plagioclase and hornblende occur as microphenocrysts and comprise 1% to 7% of the andesite. Small qualities of quartz are common and occur as microxenocrysts. Microxenocrysts of orthoclase likely exist in andesite at Ring Mountain.|$|E

5|$|Level Mountain basalt and {{andesite}} flows {{were presented}} in the 1926 Canada Department of Mines Summary Report, 1925, Part A. The andesites were described as porphyritic rocks with phenocrysts of feldspar of various size in a greyish or greenish matrix. Both hornblende and <b>augite</b> andesites were noted to have been represented under a microscope. The basalts were described as black rocks with basic plagioclase with or without olivine and were noted in many cases to contain a considerable percentage of brownish glass. Although there was not sufficient time available to study these flows in detail it was revealed at several points that the andesites formed the older and the basalts the younger flows. G. M. Dawson of the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC) was able to demonstrate that on the Stikine River {{there were at least}} four flows of basalt. The basalts and andesites were considered to be younger than all the rocks they were observed in contact with, namely granitic intrusives, porphyries and greenstones. More definite evidence as to their age was obtained by W. A. Johnston and F. A. Kerr of the GSC who placed them in the Tertiary {{with some of the most}} recent flows of the Stikine valley probably belonging to the Pleistocene.|$|E

They contain <b>augite</b> and olivine crystals. Their crystallization ages, compared to a crater count chronology of different regions on Mars, suggest the nakhlites formed on the large volcanic construct of either Tharsis, Elysium, or Syrtis Major Planum.|$|E

40|$|The mineral {{chemistry}} is compared for selected achondrites. Olivine in the ALHA 77005 and EETA 79001 shergottites, olivine-rich Chassigny and Brachina, and the nakhlites, contains Ni indicative of oxidizing conditions, whereas pallasitic and ureilitic olivines contain much lower Ni due to reducing conditions. The Brachina olivine and pyroxene have distinctively higher Fe/Mn than the shergottites and Chassigny, further indicating that Brachina is unique. The Chassigny and 77005 olivines contain lower Cr 2 O 3 (0. 03 wt. pct) than the Brachina and 79001 olivines. Values of Fe/Mn for cumulus <b>augites</b> in nakhlites {{are higher than}} for the shergottites, whereas those for ferropigeonites are not. The 77005 shergottite contains troilite FeS in contrast to 79001, Shergotty, Zagami, and Chassigny, which contain pyrrhotite. Further analyses are needed, but the present survey indicates that at least Brachina is not chemically cogenetic with the other 'oxidized achondrites', and that the Fe/Mn ratio of the cumulus <b>augites</b> in nakhlites {{is a problem for}} the assignment of the nakhlites, shergottites, and Chassigny to a single genetic group...|$|R

50|$|Norite, {{also known}} as orthopyroxene gabbro, is a mafic {{intrusive}} igneous rock composed largely of the calcium-rich plagioclase labradorite, orthopyroxene, and olivine. Norite may be essentially indistinguishable from gabbro without thin section study under the petrographic microscope. The principal difference between norite and gabbro, however, {{is the type of}} pyroxene of which it is composed; norite is predominately composed of orthopyroxenes, largely high magnesian enstatite or an iron bearing intermediate hypersthene, whereas the principal pyroxenes in gabbro are clinopyroxenes, generally medially iron-rich <b>augites.</b>|$|R
40|$|Ultramafic to mafic cumulate {{inclusions}} in Late Cenozoic basanite at Turtle Rock off Ross Island, Antarctica, {{were used}} to propose a well-defined compositional variation of the constituent minerals. The Turtle Rock cumulate suite (dunite-wehrlite-clinopyroxenite-gabbro), composed of Fe-rich olivine, clinopyroxene, kaersutitic amphibole, plagioclase and Ti-Fe oxide minerals, has undeformed and unmetasomatized igneous cumulate textures. All the ferromagnesian minerals are Fe-rich (100 Mg/(Mg+Fe) = 87 - 60). Clinopyroxenes are dominant in the cumulates and are always Fe-, Ti-, and Al-rich fassaitic <b>augites,</b> of which compositional range is separated {{from that of the}} upper mantle clinopyroxenes.

40|$|Absorption spectra in {{the visible}} and near {{infrared}} regions {{have been obtained}} for pyroxene single crystals in rocks from the Apollo 11, 12, 14, and 15 missions. The polarized spectra are compared with those obtained from terrestrial calcic clinopyroxenes, subcalcic <b>augites,</b> pigeonites, and orthopyroxenes. The lunar pyroxenes contain several broad, intense absorption bands in the near infrared, the positions of which are related to bulk composition, Fe(2 +) site occupancy and structure type of the pyroxene. The visible spectra contain several sharp, weak peaks mainly due to spin-forbidden transitions in Fe(2 +). Additional weak bands in this region in Apollo 11 pyroxenes are attributed to Ti(3 +) ions. Spectral features from Fe(3 +), Mn(2 +), Cr(3 +), and Cr(2 +) were not observed...|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} {{unambiguous}} suboceanic mantle was {{facilitated by the}} occurrence of anomalous kimberlite-type intrusives on Malaita in the Solomon Islands. The pseudo-kimberlites were termed alnoites, and are basically mica lamprophyres with melilite in the ground mass.

These {{are compared}} with sodic pyroxenes from high-grade blueschist terrains and eclogites with special {{reference to the}} island of Syros in Greece. Pyroxenes from lawsonite zone metabasites in Northwest Turkey are chloromelanites, aegerine <b>augites</b> and aegerine jadeites with the acmite contents ranging from 65 % down to 30 %. Epidote-garnet bearing high-grade blueschist metabasites of Syros {{on the other hand}} contain omphacite with the acmite content less than 30 %. All the analyzed sodic pyroxenes from eclogites and high-grade blueschists in the literature are also omphacites with low acmite contents. It is argued that the acmite content of the sodic pyroxene de-creases with rising temperature of metamorphism. This is almost entirely related to the appearance of epidote as an additional ferric ion bearing phase with an increase in temperature...|$|R

40|$|Wet and {{microprobe}} {{analyses of}} the green and brown pyroxenes of the trachytes of the Euganean Hills showed them to be <b>augites</b> with small contents of sodium. The green pyroxenes, occurring in almost all the samples, were only slightly {{or not at all}} zoned, and could be placed in two groups differentiated by small but significant variations of elements Fe 3 +, Mn, Al VI, Na, P and Mg. The brown pyroxene, occurring only in four of the six trachyte samples, show appreciable differences in elements Si, Al and Ti, both because of zoning in the same grain and between one grain and another. In some of them, zones of much more aluminifcrous augitic pyroxene and zones of calcium-poor pyroxene were both present. The brown pyroxene generally showed greater contents of Al IV, Al VI and Ti and lower contents of Si, Mn and Fe tot than the green ones. The chemical differences observed may be related to pressure differences at the moment of crystallization...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Volcano-sedimentary {{rocks in}} an imbricate tec-tonic zone around a {{peridotite}} massif {{have been studied}} northeast {{of the town of}} Tav~anh in Northwest Turkey. Basic volcanic rocks, which are the dominant rock type in this zone, show incipient blueschist metamorphism and associated metasomatism. While the igneous textures of the volcanic rocks are retained, <b>augites</b> are partially to com-pletely replaced by sodic pyroxene, and plagioclase is albit-ised resulting in rocks with 6 8 wt. % Na 20. The volcanic rocks are cross-cut by numerous veins of calcite, aragonite, quartz, pumpellyite, albite, lawsonite and sodic pyroxene. Pelagic limestones, which are interbedded with the basic volcanic rocks, consist of coarse aragonite grains showing partial replacement by calcite. The occurrence of aragonite, lawsonite and albite indicates conditions of metamorphism for the whole zone in the range of 5 8 kb and 150 - 200 ~ C. Metasomatism, probably related to high pressure serpentin-ization, has occurred contemporaneously with the incipient high pressure metamorphism...|$|R
40|$|Single clinopyroxene {{crystals}} from calc-alkaline volcanic {{rocks of}} Filicudi and Salina (Aeolian Islands, Italy) {{have been studied}} by X-ray diffraction and microprobe techniques to examine the relations between clinopyroxene crystal chemistry and the petrological features of the host rocks. The clinopyroxenes of Filicudi and Salina are chemically quite similar, but two different groups can be distinguished, diopsides and <b>augites,</b> often coexisting in the same rock. The Filicudi clinopyroxenes are generally characterized by a smaller cell volume and a more closely-packed structure; comparison with crystals from different environments suggests a higher pressure of crystallization for the Filicudi rocks. A relationship between SiO 2 content of magma and clinopyroxene intracrystalline equilibration temperature is {{discussed in terms of}} different cooling history due to the more pronounced explosive character of the more silicic magmas, leading to more rapid quenching of eruption products. For a given rock-type, clinopyroxene equilibration temperature is also a function of sample position in the volcanic sequence, to which different cooling rates can be assigned...|$|R
60|$|These rocks {{possess an}} {{extremely}} varying character; they consist of black, brown, and grey, compact, basaltic bases, with numerous crystals of <b>augite,</b> hornblende, olivine, mica, and sometimes glassy feldspar. A common variety {{is almost entirely}} composed of crystals of <b>augite</b> with olivine. Mica, it is known, seldom occurs where <b>augite</b> abounds; nor probably does the present case offer a real exception, for the mica (at least in my best characterised specimen, in which one nodule of this mineral is nearly half an inch in length) is as perfectly rounded as a pebble in a conglomerate, and evidently has not been crystallised in the base, {{in which it is}} now enclosed, but has proceeded from the fusion of some pre-existing rock. These compact lavas alternate with tuffs, amygdaloids, and wacke, and in some places with coarse conglomerate. Some of the argillaceous wackes are of a dark green colour, others, pale yellowish-green, and others nearly white; I {{was surprised to find that}} some of the latter varieties, even where whitest, fused into a jet black enamel, whilst some of the green varieties afforded only a pale gray bead. Numerous dikes, consisting chiefly of highly compact augitic rocks, and of gray amygdaloidal varieties, intersect the strata, which have in several places been dislocated with considerable violence, and thrown into highly inclined positions. One line of disturbance crosses the northern end of Quail Island (an islet in the Bay of Porto Praya), and can be followed to the mainland. These disturbances took place before the deposition of the recent sedimentary bed; and the surface, also, had previously been denuded to a great extent, as is shown by many truncated dikes.|$|E
60|$|In {{addition}} to the above there is a quantity of insoluble residue consisting of small particles of sanidine, <b>augite,</b> hornblende, and magnetite, {{supposed to be the}} product of volcanic dust or ashes carried either in the air or by ocean currents. This volcanic matter amounts to from 4.60 to 8.33 per cent. of the Globigerina-ooze of the mid-Atlantic, where it seems to be always present; and the small proportion of similar matter in true chalk is another proof that its origin is different, and that it was deposited far more rapidly than the oceanic ooze.|$|E
60|$|A compact {{crystalline}} rock, banded {{in straight}} lines with innumerable layers {{of white and}} grey shades of colour, varying in width from the thirtieth to the two-hundredth of an inch; these layers seem to be composed chiefly of feldspar, and they contain numerous perfect crystals of glassy feldspar, which are placed lengthways; they are also thickly studded with microscopically minute, amorphous, black specks, which are placed in rows, either standing separately, or more frequently united, {{two or three or}} several together, into black lines, thinner than a hair. When a small fragment is heated in the blowpipe, the black specks are easily fused into black brilliant beads, which become magnetic,--characters that apply to no common mineral except hornblende or <b>augite.</b> With the black specks there are mingled some others of a red colour, which are magnetic before being heated, and no doubt are oxide of iron. Round two little cavities, in a specimen of this variety, I found the black specks aggregated into minute crystals, appearing like those of <b>augite</b> or hornblende, but too dull and small to be measured by the goniometer; in the specimen, also, I could distinguish amidst the crystalline feldspar, grains, which had the aspect of quartz. By trying with a parallel ruler, I found that the thin grey layers and the black hair-like lines were absolutely straight and parallel to each other. It is impossible to trace the gradation from the homogeneous grey rocks to these striped varieties, or indeed the character of the different layers in the same specimen, without feeling convinced that the more or less perfect whiteness of the crystalline feldspathic matter depends on the more or less perfect aggregation of diffused matter, into the black and red specks of hornblende and oxide of iron.|$|E
40|$|Glass {{compositions}} in the Luna 20 soil {{indicate a}} minor contribution of mare rocks {{and a major}} contribution of highly feldspathic highland material. Glasses with the composition of highland basalt (anorthositic gabbro or norite) predominate {{in a range of}} highly aluminous glasses. The analyses of minerals in the soil show that the highland rocks have a unique assemblage of minerals that can readily be distinguished from the mineral assemblages of either mare or KREEP basalts. The soils are characterized by abundant anorthitic, low-Fe plagioclase. Highly magnesian orthopyroxenes, pigeonites, and <b>augites</b> are the most prominent pyroxenes. Unlike mare basalt pyroxenes, clinopyroxenes with intermediate Ca values are not abundant, but extreme iron enrichment toward pyroxferroite does occur. Olivines are more abundant than at other sites and are Mg-rich, low in Ca and Cr. Spinels with compositions approaching MgAl 2 O 4 predominate over pleonastes and chromites. Ilmenite and metal are present but not abundant. The mineral compositions are consistent with derivation from a suite of highly feldspathic rocks in which highland basalt compositions predominate...|$|R
40|$|Thirty-three new partial or {{complete}} chemical analyses are presented for pyroxene, amphibole, and biotite phenocrysts separated from three andesitic, three dacitic and thirteen rhyolitic volcanic rocks. The orthopyroxenes are mostly of hypersthene composition, with the rhyolitic hypersthenes generally being slightly more Fe-rich {{compared to the}} andesitic types. No detailed correlation, however, is evident between the Fe/Mg ratio of the rhyolitic orthopyroxenes and their parent rocks or co-existing groundmasses. A correlation between Ca content {{and the type of}} co-existing ferromagnesian assemblage was found. The clinopyroxenes are <b>augites,</b> and occur most commonly in the andesites and dacites. Two amphiboles are found, a calcic amphibole and cummingtonite. The former range from a tschermakitic hornblende (andesitic) to magnesio-hornblende in the rhyolites. One dacitic ferro-hornblende was found. The data illustrate the increasing substitution of Al and increasing Na in the andesitic hornblende. A close correlation of the Niggli mg ratio, and also MnO, exists between the analysed co-existing orthopyroxenes and hornblendes.

Main minerals are plagioclase (typically An> 85) and clinopyroxene (pigeonites and <b>augites,</b> sometimes interspersed). The presence of tranquillityite, coupled with the petrophysical data, the O-isotope data (D 17 O = - 0. 075) and the FeOtot/MnO ratios in olivine (91), pyroxene (65) and bulk rock (77) indicate a lunar origin for DEW 12007. Impactites consist of Al-rich impact melt splashes and plagioclase-rich meta-melt clasts. The volcanic products belong to the Very Low Titanium (VLT) or Low Titanium (LT) suites; an unusual subophitic fragment could be cryptomare-related. Gabbroic clasts could represent part of a shallow intrusion within a volcanic complex with prevailing VLT affinity. DEW 12007 has a mingled bulk composition with relatively high incompatible element abundances and shows a high crustal diversity, comprising clasts from the Moon's major terranes and rare lithologies. First order petrographic and chemical features suggest that DEW 12007 could be launch-paired with other meteorites including Y 793274 / 981031, QUE 94281, EET 87521 / 96008, and NWA 4884...|$|R
