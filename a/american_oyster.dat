40|$|Background. Healthy {{shellfish}} {{populations are}} important to the proper function of estuarine ecosystems. Estuaries like Chesapeake Bay once held large numbers of <b>American</b> <b>oysters</b> (Crassostrea virginica). Historically, these oysters filtered the entire bay’s water volume every 3. 3 days. Several centuries of over exploitation compounded by diseases such as Perkinsus marinus and MSX, coupled with water pollution, reduced oyster abundance to the point where in 1988 the remnant population filtered the bay only once every 325 days – a one hundred fold decrease (Newell, 1988). The result has been increased turbidity in the water which has reduced light penetration to the point where submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) has died off, reducing valuable estuarine habitat for fish and other shellfish such as the blue crab (Callenectes sapidus) ...|$|R

Assessment of anthropogenic stressors such as mercury in the coastal environment has traditionally relied upon species diversity indices or assays to determine lethal doses. However, these indices fail to examine sub-lethal impacts such as gene expression. A ?global?

40|$|The <b>American</b> <b>oyster</b> Crassostrea virginica, an ecologically and {{economically}} important estuarine organism, can suffer high mortalities in {{areas in the}} Northeast United States due to Roseovarius Oyster Disease (ROD), caused by the gram-negative bacterial pathogen Roseovarius crassostreae. The goals of this research were to provide insights into: 1) the responses of American oysters to R. crassostreae, and 2) potential mechanisms of resistance or susceptibility to ROD. The responses of oysters to bacterial challenge were characterized by exposing oysters from ROD-resistant and susceptible families to R. crassostreae, followed by high-throughput sequencing of cDNA samples from various timepoints after disease challenge. Sequence data was assembled into a reference transcriptome and analyzed through differential gene expression and functional enrichment to uncover genes and processes potentially involved in responses to ROD in the <b>American</b> <b>oyster.</b> While susceptible oysters experienced constant levels of mortality when challenged with R. crassostreae, resistant oysters showed levels of mortality similar to non-challenged oysters. Oysters exposed to R. crassostreae showed differential expression of transcripts involved in immune recognition, signaling, protease inhibition, detoxification, and apoptosis. Transcripts involved in metabolism were enriched in susceptible oysters, suggesting that bacterial infection places a large metabolic demand on these oysters. Transcripts differentially expressed in resistant oysters in response to infection included the immune modulators IL- 17 and arginase, {{as well as several}} genes involved in extracellular matrix remodeling.

This similarity in estimates of k 2 for labeled and unlabeled PCB 153 indicates that there is relatively little error introduced by using laboratory PCB elimination rate constants to estimate PCB 153 toxicokinetics in mussels deployed at this field station.
