2500|$|Kojima {{was asked}} {{to take over a}} project, Metal Gear, from <b>a</b> <b>senior</b> <b>associate.</b> Hardware {{limitations}} hindered development of the game's combat. Inspired by The Great Escape, Kojima altered the gameplay to focus on a prisoner escaping. It was released in [...] for the MSX2 home computer in Japan and parts of Europe. The game revolves around a special forces operative codenamed Solid Snake, who is sent to the fortified state of [...] "Outer Heaven" [...] to stop a nuclear equipped walking tank known as [...] "Metal Gear". Metal Gear is one of the earliest examples of the stealth action game genre, where avoiding encounters from the enemies is emphasized over direct combat. A port of Metal Gear was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System. Kojima was not directly involved in the production of this version and he has openly criticized some of the changes made in this version. Some of these flaws include bad translation, no ending boss fight with [...] "Metal Gear" [...] (which was included in the MSX2 version), and plenty more. Most of these flaws were fixed in the MSX2 English port included in Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence for the PlayStation 2, and Metal Gear Solid: HD Collection for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.|$|E
