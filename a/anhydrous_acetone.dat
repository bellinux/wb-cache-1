40|$|A {{comparison}} of histochemical detection of GM 1 ganglioside in cryostat sections using cholera toxin B-subunit after fixation with 4 % formaldehyde and dry acetone gave tissue-dependent results. In the liver no pre-treatment showed detectable differences related to GM 1 reaction products, while {{studies in the}} brain showed the superiority of acetone pre-extraction (followed by formaldehyde), which yielded sharper images compared with the diffuse, blurred staining pattern associated with formaldehyde. Therefore, the aim of our study was to define the optimal conditions for the GM 1 detection using cholera toxin B-subunit. Ganglioside extractability with acetone, the ever neglected topic, was tested comparing <b>anhydrous</b> <b>acetone</b> with acetone containing admixture of water. TLC analysis of acetone extractable GM 1 ganglioside from liver sections did not exceed 2 % of the total GM 1 ganglioside content using <b>anhydrous</b> <b>acetone</b> at - 20 °C, and 4 % at room temperature. The loss increased to 30. 5 % using 9 : 1 acetone/water.

The cytochemical procedure, unlike its biochemical counterparts, is able to locate the dissociation of cAMP- dependent protein kinase in individual cells of functionally or histologically complex cultures. Also, it reveals variations in the time- and dose-dependent activation of the kinase amongst clonal cells stimulated with cyclic nucleotide analogues or hormones...|$|E
40|$|Five {{chemical}} fixatives {{were evaluated}} {{for their ability}} to accurately preserve bacterial ultrastructure during freeze-substitution of select Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis strains. Radioisotopes were specifically incorporated into the peptidoglycan, lipopolysaccharide, and nucleic acids of E. coli SFK 11 and W 7 and into the peptidoglycan and RNA of B. subtilis 168 and W 23. The ease of extraction of radiolabels, as assessed by liquid scintillation counting during all stages of processing for freeze-substitution, was used as an indicator of cell structural integrity and retention of cellular chemical composition. Subsequent visual examination by electron microscopy was used to confirm ultrastructural conformation. The fixatives used were: 2 % (wt/vol) osmium tetroxide and 2 % (wt/vol) uranyl acetate; 2 % (vol/vol) glutaraldehyde and 2 % (wt/vol) uranyl acetate; 2 % (vol/vol) acrolein and 2 % (wt/vol) uranyl acetate; 2 % (wt/vol) gallic acid; and 2 % (wt/vol) uranyl acetate. All fixatives were prepared in a substitution solvent of <b>anhydrous</b> <b>acetone.</b> Extraction of cellular constituents depended on the chemical fixative used. A combination of 2 % osmium tetroxide- 2 % uranyl acetate or 2 % gallic acid alone resulted in optimum fixation as ascertained by least extraction of radiolabels. In both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, high levels of radiolabel were detected in the processing fluids in which 2 % acrolein- 2 % uranyl acetate, 2 % glutaraldehyde- 2 % uranyl acetate, or 2 % uranyl acetate alone were used as fixatives. Ultrastructural variations were observed in cells freeze-substituted in the presence of different chemical fixatives. We recommend the use of osmium tetroxide and uranyl acetate in acetone for routine freeze-substitution of eubacteria, while gallic acid is recommended for use when microanalytical processing necessitates the omission of osmium...|$|E
