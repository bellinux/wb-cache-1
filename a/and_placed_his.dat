5|$|According to Diodorus, the Macedonian army {{numbered}} roughly 30,000 {{infantry and}} 2,000 cavalry, a figure generally accepted by modern historians.

5|$|According to {{the comic}} book series Haunted, Adam was once a human member of the Initiative tasked with {{protecting}} Professor Walsh. The ghost of Mayor Richard Wilkins, however, took over {{the body of a}} vampire, which was then captured by the Initiative. Desperate to escape, the Mayor moved to the body of a dead demon and killed Adam. Having been one of her favorite agents, Professor Walsh vowed to bring him back to life <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>his</b> body in her 314 Project. However, due to the complex nature of the Buffyverse, this chain of events may not, in fact, be canonical.|$|E
5|$|In 1518, in {{the absence}} of Adam Gordon, the castle was {{captured}} by Alexander Sutherland, the legitimate heir to the Earldom of Sutherland. The Gordons quickly retook the castle, captured Alexander <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>his</b> head on a spear on top of the castle tower. Alexander's son John made an attempt on the castle in 1550, but was killed in the castle garden. During the more peaceful 17th century, the keep was extended {{with the addition of a}} large house, built around a courtyard to the south-west.|$|E
5|$|Diego Velázquez, the {{governor}} of Cuba, was enthused by Hernández de Córdoba's report of gold in Yucatán. He organised a new expedition <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>his</b> nephew Juan de Grijalva in command over his four ships. The small fleet left Cuba in April 1518, and made its first landfall upon the island of Cozumel, off {{the east coast of}} Yucatán. The Maya inhabitants of Cozumel fled the Spanish and would not respond to Grijalva's friendly overtures. The fleet then sailed south along the east coast of the peninsula. The Spanish spotted three large Maya cities along the coast, but Grijalva did not land at any of these and turned back north to loop around the north of the peninsula and sail down the west coast. At Campeche the Spanish tried to barter for water but the Maya refused, so Grijalva opened fire against the city with small cannon; the inhabitants fled, allowing the Spanish to take the abandoned city. Messages were sent with a few Maya who had been too slow to escape but the Maya remained hidden in the forest; the Spanish boarded their ships and continued along the coast.|$|E

5|$|Early in {{the second}} half, Jensen made another save, this time from Terry McDermott. Brugge's first {{significant}} chance came a few minutes afterwards, when a cross-field pass by René Vandereycken reached Jan Sørensen {{on the right-hand side}} of the pitch. Sørensen's subsequent shot was blocked by Liverpool captain Emlyn Hughes. The blocked shot was not cleared, but Ray Clemence reached the ball before Brugge's Lajos Kű could reach it and score. After this Kű was substituted with Dirk Sanders. Liverpool made a substitution minutes later, with Steve Heighway replacing Case. Liverpool's substitution had more effect, as Heighway gave Liverpool more width on the right-hand side of the pitch. Two minutes after Heighway's introduction, Kenny Dalglish received the ball in the Brugge penalty area from a Graeme Souness pass <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>his</b> shot over a diving Jensen to give Liverpool a 1–0 lead.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Nikephoros' murderer and successor, John I Tzimiskes, {{was unable}} to {{intervene}} in person in the east due to the more menacing invasion of the Balkans by Sviatoslav I of Kiev. As a result, he sent a small force under a trusted eunuch of his household, the patrikios Nicholas, who according to the contemporary Leo the Deacon was experienced in battle, to relieve the siege. In the meantime, the siege of Antioch had continued for five months over winter and into spring, without result. At some point, a Fatimid detachment—according to Ibn al-Dawadari 4,000 men under a Berber chieftain called Aras and a former emir of Tarsus, Ibn az-Zayyat—moved north against Alexandretta, where the Byzantine relief army had camped. Informed of their approach, the Byzantine commander vacated the camp <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>his</b> troops in ambush. Finding the enemy encampment deserted, the Fatimid troops began to plunder it, heedless of anything else. At that moment, Nicholas launched a surprise attack from all sides and the Fatimid force disintegrated; most of the Muslim army perished, but Aras with Ibn az-Zayyat managed to escape.|$|E
5|$|Staff Sergeant Ambrosio Guillen (1929–1953) was posthumously {{awarded the}} Medal of Honor {{two days before}} the Armistice. He was {{responsible}} for turning an overwhelming enemy attack into a disorderly retreat. Guillen, who was assigned to Company F, 2nd Battalion, 7th Marines, 1st Marine Division (Reinforced), participated in the defense of an outpost forward of the main line of resistance on July 25, 1953. He maneuvered his platoon over unfamiliar terrain in the face of hostile fire <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>his</b> men in fighting positions. With his unit pinned down when the outpost was attacked under cover of darkness by an estimated force of two enemy battalions supported by mortar and artillery fire, he deliberately exposed himself to the heavy barrage and attacks to direct his men in defending their positions and personally supervise the treatment and evacuation of the wounded. Inspired by his leadership, the platoon quickly rallied and engaged the enemy force in fierce hand-to-hand combat. Although critically wounded {{during the course of the}} battle, Staff Sergeant Guillen refused medical aid and continued to direct his men throughout the remainder of the engagement until the enemy attack into a disorderly retreat.|$|E

5|$|The allied Greek {{army had}} taken up a {{position}} near Chaeronea, astride the main road. On the left flank, the allied Greek line lay across the foothills of Mount Thurion, blocking the side-road that led to Lebedea, while on the right, the line rested against the Kephisos river, near a projecting spur of Mount Aktion. The allied Greek army included contingents from Achaea, Corinth, Chalcis, Epidaurus, Megara and Troezen, {{with the majority of}} troops being supplied by Athens and Thebes, thus making it an army of allied cities of southern Greece, that had been traditionally self-governed for centuries. The Athenian contingent was led by the generals Chares and Lysicles, and the Thebans by Theagenes. No source provides exact numbers for the allied Greek army; the modern view is that the allied Greek numbers were approximately equal to those of the Macedonians, who according to Diodorus numbered roughly 30,000 infantry and 2,000 cavalry. Philip took command of {{the right wing of the}} Macedonian wing <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>his</b> 18-year-old son Alexander (the future Alexander the Great) in command of the left wing, accompanied by a group of Philip's experienced generals.|$|E
5|$|After {{his army}} crossed the Euphrates, {{following}} a route opened up by Lucullus {{over a hundred}} years before, he received envoys from Tiridates and Vologases. At the approach of such a large force, and aware of Corbulo's ability as a general, the two Arsacids were anxious to negotiate. Indeed, Corbulo, no doubt on instructions from Nero, reiterated the old Roman position: if Tiridates would accept his crown from Rome, then renewed war could be averted. Tiridates readily agreed to negotiations, and Rhandeia, the scene of last year's Roman defeat, was agreed upon as a meeting place. To the Armenians, this place was intended as a reminder of their strength, while Corbulo agreed to it because there he hoped to expunge the earlier disgrace, by peace or war. Once there, Corbulo put Paetus' son, who served under him as a legate, in charge of a party that was to gather the remains of the Roman soldiers and ensure them a proper burial. On the agreed day, both Tiridates and Corbulo, each accompanied by 20 horsemen, met between the two camps. Tiridates agreed to travel to Rome and seek confirmation of his crown from Nero. In sign of this agreement, a few days later, both armies put on a display, arrayed in full parade gear. Tiridates approached the Roman camp, where a statue of the Emperor Nero had been erected upon a raised platform, <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>his</b> royal diadem at its feet in submission.|$|E
5|$|Carlsen's next tournament was the Grand Slam Masters Final on 9–15 October, {{which he}} had {{qualified}} for automatically by winning three of the previous year's four Grand Slam chess events (2009 Nanjing Pearl Spring, 2010 Corus, 2010 Bazna Kings). Along with Carlsen, the finals consisted of World Champion Anand and the highest two scorers from the preliminary stage held in Shanghai in September: Kramnik and Shirov. The average Elo of the participants {{at the time was}} 2789, making the Grand Slam Final the strongest chess tournament in history. In the first round, Carlsen lost with black to Kramnik; this was Carlsen's second consecutive loss to Kramnik, <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>his</b> hold on the world No. 1 ranking in serious jeopardy. In his second round, Carlsen lost with the white pieces to Anand; this was his first loss as White since January 2010. Carlsen recovered somewhat {{in the latter part of}} the tournament, achieving a win over Shirov, and finishing with 2½/6. The tournament was won by Kramnik with 4/6. Carlsen finished this tournament with a rating of 2802, two points behind Anand at 2804 who temporarily ended Carlsen's reign at world No. 1. These setbacks called into question from some whether Carlsen's activities outside chess, such as modelling for G-Star Raw, were distracting him from performing well at the chessboard. Carlsen said he did not believe there was a direct connection.|$|E

Because there were no Australian survivors, Burnett's decision is inexplicable; writers on the subject can only speculate on his reasoning, and indicate what factors they believe influenced him. Up until the 1980s, most of the material published relating to the loss of Sydney accepted the German interpretation of events (that Burnett was deceived by Kormorans disguise, <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>his</b> ship in a tactically unsound position) and assigned Burnett various levels of blame {{for his role in the}} cruiser's demise.|$|E
