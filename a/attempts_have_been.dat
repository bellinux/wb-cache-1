5|$|The tarpan or European {{wild horse}} (Equus ferus ferus) {{was found in}} Europe and much of Asia. It survived into the {{historical}} era, but became extinct in 1909, when the last captive died in a Russian zoo. Thus, the genetic line was lost. <b>Attempts</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> made to recreate the tarpan, which resulted in horses with outward physical similarities, but nonetheless descended from domesticated ancestors and not true wild horses.|$|E

5|$|While {{significant}} <b>attempts</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> made {{recently to}} identify the exact locations of the individual Upanishads, the results are tentative. Witzel identifies the center of activity in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad as the area of Videha, whose king, Janaka, features prominently in the Upanishad. The Chandogya Upanishad was probably composed in a more western than eastern location in the Indian subcontinent, possibly somewhere in the western region of the Kuru-Panchala country.|$|E

5|$|White tigers {{are more}} {{frequently}} bred in captivity, where the comparatively small gene pool {{can lead to}} inbreeding. This has given white tigers a greater likelihood of being born with physical defects, such as cleft palate, scoliosis (curvature of the spine), and strabismus (squint). Even apparently healthy white tigers generally do not live {{as long as their}} orange counterparts. <b>Attempts</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> made to cross white and orange tigers to remedy this, often mixing with other subspecies in the process.|$|E
5|$|<b>Attempts</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> made to {{establish}} the exact date of Good Friday by assuming that the darkness described at Jesus's crucifixion was a solar eclipse. This research has not yielded conclusive results, and Good Friday is recorded as being at Passover, which is held {{at the time of}} a full moon. Further, the darkness lasted from the sixth hour to the ninth, or three hours, which is much, much longer than the eight-minute upper limit for any solar eclipse's totality. In the Western hemisphere, there are few reliable records of eclipses before 800 AD, until the advent of Arab and monastic observations in the early medieval period. The first recorded observation of the corona was made in Constantinople in 968 AD.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{diversity}} of the originally broadly defined Liliaceae (s.l.), many <b>attempts</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> made to form supageneric classification systems, organizing the genera into subfamilies, tribes, or other suprageneric taxa (taxonomic groupings between genus and family). By 1813, Candolle recognised five subdivisions which he called tribes (Asparagées, Trilliacées, Asphodelées, Bromeliées, Tulipacées), all of which Jussieu had made separate families, with the exception of Tulipa, which was a genus within the Liliaceae. By 1845, John Lindley observed that the family had become extremely diverse, ill-defined and unstable, not only by its overall circumscription, but also by its subdivisions. For the 133 genera he included, he described eleven suborders. By the 1870s, as Baker describes in his revision of the family, the taxonomy of Liliaceae had become vast and complicated. His approach was to divide the family into eight tribes.|$|E
