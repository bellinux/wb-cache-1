In hindsight he probably didn't reach the heights that he should have, based on his cricket ability, but the guys who played with him and against him will recognise he was a fantastic player, who was dynamic in anything he did in cricket. When he was on he was unplayable. He bowled a swinging ball, he could hit the ball a mile, throw it like a bullet and he was a fantastic catcher either close to the wicket or in the outfield – a supreme cricketer. He was a very popular person, Gus, a bit of a larrikin <b>and</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> liked by everyone. He didn't take life all that seriously, played for the enjoyment of it.|$|E

[...] "He coaches to his personality and to his strengths," [...] Collier says. [...] "Obviously, he has great rapport and communication ability with his team." [...] Yahoo!

500|$|Pat Wheeler, {{a scholar}} of literature, {{describes}} the narrative style as [...] "both naturalistic and realistic <b>and</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> {{in the manner of}} the nineteenth century writers [...] cites as literary influences"—Wheeler notes Émile Zola, Charles Dickens and George Gissing among these. Wheeler emphasizes that the naturalistic tendencies of the narrative allow treatment of the war setting without an idealization of the [...] "human" [...] parts of the narrative. Consistently, reviews emphasize the novel's imagery of the battle experience in and amongst the trenches. For Slade, the novel [...] "produces a vivid and traumatizing description of {{the sights and sounds of}} life and death in (and under the trenches)"; the principal cause of this, he says, is [...] "the pure fury and intensity of the imagery created page after page".|$|E
500|$|In autumn 1985, {{following}} {{the financial and}} critical disappointment of A View to a Kill, work began on scripts for the next Bond film, with the intention that Roger Moore would not reprise the role of James Bond. Moore, who {{by the time of}} the release of The Living Daylights would have been 59 years old, chose to retire from the role after 12 years and 7 films. Albert Broccoli, however, claimed that he let Moore go from the role. An extensive search for a new actor to play Bond saw a number of actors, including New Zealander Sam Neill, Irish-born Pierce Brosnan and Welshman Timothy Dalton audition for the role in 1986. Bond co-producer Michael G. Wilson, director John Glen, Dana and Barbara Broccoli [...] "were impressed with Sam Neill <b>and</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> wanted to use him."

He was on holiday in Wales with his family when he first heard of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. He was later to remark that he felt [...] "sort of proud that the bomb had worked, and absolutely appalled at what it had done to human beings". Oliphant became a harsh critic of nuclear weapons {{and a member of the}} Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs, saying, [...] "I, right from the beginning, have been terribly worried by the existence of nuclear weapons <b>and</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> against their use." [...] His wartime work would have earned him a Presidential Medal of Freedom with Gold Palm, but the Australian government vetoed this honour, as government policy at the time was not to confer honours on civilians.|$|E
500|$|After Williams {{completed}} several {{drafts of}} the screenplay, the company hired Kevin Hood {{to aid in}} further script development. Bernstein believed that Hood's past work contained [...] "a romantic sensibility... There is a poetic quality about his writing as well as there being a rigorous emotional truth which I thought was important for Jane." [...] Hood was attracted to the film because he believed [...] "the story is such an important one <b>and</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> the inspiration for Pride and Prejudice." [...] Calling Austen a [...] "genius" [...] and [...] "one of the top two or three prose writers of all time", Hood thought that her relationship with Lefroy [...] "was absolutely essential in shaping her work." [...] Hood acknowledged however that Becoming Jane is [...] "based on the facts as they are known {{and the majority of}} characters did exist, as did many of the situations and circumstances in the film. Some have been fictionalised, weaving together what we know about Austen's world from her books and letters, creating a rich Austenite landscape." ...|$|E
500|$|With the {{retirement}} of Roger Moore in 1985, {{a search for a}} new actor to play Bond took place that saw a number of actors, including Sam Neill, Pierce Brosnan and Timothy Dalton audition for the role in 1986. Bond co-producer Michael G. Wilson, director John Glen, Dana and Barbara Broccoli [...] "were impressed with Sam Neill <b>and</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> wanted to use him", although Bond producer Albert R. Broccoli was not sold on the actor. Dalton and Brosnan were both considered by Eon, but after Brosnan was eventually ruled out by his Remington Steele contract, Dalton was appointed in August 1986 on a salary of $5.2million. When he was either 24 or 25 years old Dalton had discussed playing Bond with Broccoli, but decided he was too young to accept the role, thinking Bond should be played between 35 and 40 years old. In preparing for the role, Dalton, a green-eyed, dark haired, slender, 6'2" [...] (1 m 88cm) classically trained Shakespearean actor, was keen to portray the character as accurately as possible, reading up extensively on the books before his role in The Living Daylights (1987).|$|E
