500|$|Mugabe's actions brought strong criticism. The Zimbabwe Council of Churches {{accused him}} of {{plunging}} the country into [...] "a de facto state of warfare" [...] {{in order to stay}} in power. Several Southern African states remonstrated with him at a summit in Harare in September 2001. In 2002, the British Commonwealth expelled Zimbabwe from among its ranks; Mugabe blamed this on anti-black racism, a view echoed by South Africa's President Thabo Mbeki. Mbeki favoured a policy of [...] "quiet diplomacy" [...] in dealing with Mugabe, and prevented the African Union (AU) from introducing sanctions against him. The Africa-Europe Summit, scheduled to take place in Lisbon in April 2003, was deferred repeatedly because African leaders refused to attend while Mugabe was banned; it eventually took place in 2007 with Mugabe in attendance. In 2004, the EU imposed a travel ban and <b>asset</b> <b>freeze</b> on Mugabe. It extended these sanctions in 2008, with the U.S. government introducing further sanctions this same year. The US and UK introduced a resolution at the UN Security Council calling for an arms embargo of Zimbabwe alongside an <b>asset</b> <b>freeze</b> and travel ban of Mugabe and other government figures; it was vetoed by Russia and China. In 2009, the SADC demanded that Western states lift their targeted sanctions against Mugabe and his government. ZANU-PF presented the sanctions as a form of Western neo-colonialism and blamed the West for Zimbabwe's economic problems.|$|E

2500|$|In {{response}} to the sanctions introduced by the US and EU, the Russian Duma unanimously passed a resolution asking for {{all members of the}} Duma to be included on the sanctions list.

2500|$|In October 2010, Iran's gold {{reserves}} hit [...] "record high" [...] as the Central Bank took [...] "preventive measures" [...] {{to avoid a}} possible <b>asset</b> <b>freeze</b> by Western countries.

[...] "At present, the price of each ounce of gold is $1,230. Consequently, {{the value of the}} national reserves has risen by a few billion dollars" [...] he said.

2500|$|On 23 February 2011, the Egyptian {{newspaper}} Eldostor {{reported that}} a [...] "knowledgeable source" [...] described {{the order of the}} Prosecutor General to freeze Mubarak's assets and the threats of a legal action as nothing but a signal for Mubarak to leave Egypt after a number of attempts were made to encourage him to leave willingly. In February 2011, Voice of America reported that Egypt's top prosecutor had ordered a travel ban and an <b>asset</b> <b>freeze</b> for Mubarak and his family as he considered further action.

2500|$|Prior to his {{removal from}} the list, {{he was the}} only living Canadian on the United Nations {{security}} council blacklist, usually referred to as the [...] "1267 List" [...] after the number of the Security Council resolution which established it. The 1267 regime imposes sanctions on listed individuals, including a complete <b>asset</b> <b>freeze</b> and a ban on international travel. Upon his return to Canada, he sued the government for C$24-million, and C$3-million more for Foreign Minister Lawrence Cannon's alleged “misfeasance in public office.” He has also launched a [...] to legislation implementing the 1267 regime in Canada. Abdelrazik's experience has been said to be similar to other Canadians such as Maher Arar, Abdullah Almalki, Ahmad El Maati, and Muayyed Nureddin.

2500|$|On July 23, 2006 the United States Department of the Treasury {{designated}} Abdelrazik as {{a supporter}} of al-Qaeda and a terrorist, [...] "for his high-level ties to and support for al-Qaeda." [...] According to the Globe and Mail, the U.S. State Department believes, [...] "Mr. Abdelrazik was “closely associated with Abu Zubaydah, Osama bin Laden's lieutenant responsible for recruiting and for al-Qaeda's network of training camps in Afghanistan.” The United States also alleges Mr. Abdelrazik recruited and accompanied a Tunisian extremist named Raouf Hannachi for paramilitary training at a camp in Afghanistan in 1996 “where al-Qaeda and other UN-sanctioned terrorist groups were known to train,” and became personally acquainted with Mr. bin Laden". [...] In April 2011, Wikileaks revealed that a November 2008 U.S. Department of Defence document stated that Abdelrazik had admitted receiving $10 000 from alleged al-Qaeda financier Hassan Zemiri, who was captured in late 2001 in Tora Bora, Afghanistan. [...] However, none of these allegations have been proven {{in a court of}} law and Abdelrazik has never been charged with any crime, in Canada or anywhere else in the world. Eight days after he was designated a terrorist by the US, he was added to the UN Security Council terrorist blacklist (not a no fly list) by the U.S. and is now the only living Canadian on that list. According to the Globe and mail,"any country can nominate anyone they consider to be an islamic extremist. All his personal assets were frozen once he was put on that list. Individuals on the list are subject to a sanctions regime which include an <b>asset</b> <b>freeze</b> and a ban on international travel (but not flight per se). According to a letter sent on April 18, 2008, by the Department of Foreign Affairs to Abousfian Abdelrazik's lawyer, the Canadian government requested the UN's 1267 Committee to remove Abdelrazik from its list of al Qaeda supporters.|$|E
