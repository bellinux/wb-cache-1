5|$|Corder's {{skeleton}} was put {{on display}} in a glass case in the West Suffolk Hospital, and apparently was rigged with a mechanism that made its arm point to the collection box when approached. Eventually, the skull was removed by Dr John Kilner, who wanted to add it to his extensive collection of Red Barn memorabilia. After a series of unfortunate events, he became convinced that the skull was cursed <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> on to a friend named Hopkins. Further disasters plagued both men, and they finally paid for the skull {{to be given a}} Christian burial in an attempt to lift the supposed curse.|$|E
5|$|Ideal batting {{conditions}} and clear skies greeted {{the players on}} the second morning. Barnes batted assuredly, while Morris was hesitant and shuffled around the crease. At one stage, Morris scored only seven runs in 55 minutes. Barnes was involved in some interplay with umpire Chester when the latter stopped a drive from Morris with his foot. Barnes picked the ball off the wicket <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> to the bowler, prompting Chester to wag his finger in disapproval. Barnes responded by admonishing the umpire for blocking the ball.|$|E

They were {{identified}} as Mubashir Sheik and Sheik Abid Basha hailing from Guntur. Basha illegally accessed the feed of the film <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> over to Sheik who then uploaded it on YouTube.

5|$|Howden's {{account of}} events reveals that Haraldr {{and his family}} gained control of Moray early in 1196, and charter {{evidence}} suggests that William and royal forces were in the north that summer. Although the Chronicle of Melrose appears to indicate that Hvarflǫð and Haraldr's eldest son was defeated in 1197, {{it is possible that}} this event dates to 1196 instead and relates to William's aforesaid northern campaign. Fordun's account records that William successfully asserted royal power in the northern regions; and Howden's account species that the king stripped Haraldr of his lordship in Caithness, <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> over to Haraldr Eiríksson, a claimant to the Orcadian earldom. At some point after this, Howden's account reveals that Haraldr overcame and killed Haraldr Eiríksson, and the Icelandic Annals specifically date the latter's fall to 1198.|$|E
5|$|On 30 June 1513, Henry invaded France, and {{his troops}} {{defeated}} a French army at the Battle of the Spurs – {{a relatively minor}} result, but one which was seized on by the English for propaganda purposes. Soon after, the English took Thérouanne <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> over to Maximillian; Tournai, a more significant settlement, followed. Henry had led the army personally, complete with large entourage. His absence from the country, however, had prompted his brother-in-law, James IV of Scotland, to invade England {{at the behest of}} Louis. Nevertheless, the English army, overseen by Queen Catherine, decisively defeated the Scots at the Battle of Flodden on 9 September 1513. Among the dead was the Scottish king, thus ending Scotland's brief involvement in the war. These campaigns had given Henry a taste of the military success he so desired. However, despite initial indications, he decided not to pursue a 1514 campaign. He had been supporting Ferdinand and Maximilian financially during the campaign but had received little in return; England's coffers were now empty. With the replacement of Julius by Pope Leo X, who was inclined to negotiate for peace with France, Henry signed his own treaty with Louis: his sister Mary would become Louis' wife, having previously been pledged to the younger Charles, and peace was secured for eight years, a remarkably long time.|$|E

25|$|Aston Martin {{was often}} financially troubled. In 1972 David Brown paid off all its debts, {{said to be}} £5 million or more, <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> for £101 to Company Developments, a Birmingham-based {{investment}} bank consortium chaired by accountant William Willson. More detail on this period may be read at Willson's biography. The worldwide recession, lack of working capital and the difficulties of developing without proper resources an engine to meet California's exhaust emission requirements — it stopped Aston's US sales — again pulled Aston Martin into receivership {{at the end of}} 1974. There were 460 workers when the plant closed.|$|E

At the age of 13, Luke was said to have carved the face of a bully when he was still schooling, which was a reason why he and his father moved to Forth Worth, Texas.|$|E

25|$|After the {{transfer}} of power from Denmark, the Court was first housed in the Old Penitentiary Building on Skólavörðustígur in Reykjavík. In 1949 it moved to the former court building on Lindargata. 1993 saw a competition to design a new home for the Court, which was won by Margrét Harðardóttir and Steve Christer of Studio Granda, Reykjavík. The Icelandic Minister of Justice dug the first spade of ground for the new Courthouse of the Supreme Court of Iceland at Arnarhóll on 15 July 1994, laid {{the cornerstone of the}} building on the Court’s 75th anniversary, 16 February 1995, <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> over to the Court for use on 5 September 1996.|$|E
25|$|Diocletian and Maximian {{stepped down}} as co-emperors on May 1, 305, {{possibly}} due to Diocletian's poor health. Before the assembled armies at Milan, Maximian removed his purple cloak <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> to Severus, the new Caesar, and proclaimed Constantius as Augustus. The same scene played out at Nicomedia {{under the authority of}} Diocletian. Constantius, notionally the senior emperor, ruled the western provinces, while Galerius took the eastern provinces. Constantine, disappointed in his hopes to become a Caesar, fled the court of Galerius after Constantius had asked Galerius to release his son as Constantius was ill. Constantine joined his father's court at the coast of Gaul, just as he was preparing to campaign in Britain.|$|E
25|$|When Edward IV died in April 1483, Rotherham {{was one of}} the celebrants of {{the funeral}} mass on 20 April 1483. Immediately after Edward's death, Rotherham sided with dowager queen Elizabeth Woodville in her attempt to deprive Richard, Duke of Gloucester of his role as Lord Protector of the new King, her son Edward V. When Elizabeth sought {{sanctuary}} after Richard had taken charge of the king, Rotherham released the Great Seal to her. Though he later recovered it <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> over to Thomas Bourchier, Archbishop of Canterbury, his mishandling of the seal– indicative of questionable loyalty, led to his dismissal as Lord Chancellor. On 13 May he was replaced by John Russell, who earlier had also been his successor as Bishop of Lincoln.|$|E
