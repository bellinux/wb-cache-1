Although Johner unsuccessfully attempts to dominate her sexually, Wren dominates her with physical force and a dehumanizing attitude. In a 2013 Total Film interview, writer Joss Whedon expressed discontent with the casting of J. E. Freeman; the character was intended to have a mysterious element in his unscrupulous activities, which was overshadowed by typecasting.|$|E

The last human awake, Daniels is being returned to cryosleep by David, who inadvertently reveals his identity by not being able to recount Daniels' fantasy about building a log cabin by a lake, which she had previously recounted to Walter. Horrified, but unable to escape, Daniels is returned to stasis.|$|E

5|$|Examining the {{symbolism}} in Bosch's art"the freakish riddles … the irresponsible phantasmagoria of an ecstatic"Fränger concluded that his interpretation applied to Bosch's three altarpieces only: The Garden of Earthly Delights, Temptation of Saint Anthony, and The Haywain Triptych. Fränger distinguished these {{pieces from the}} artist's other works and argued that despite their anti-cleric polemic, they were nevertheless all altarpieces, probably commissioned for the devotional purposes of a mystery cult. While commentators accept Fränger's analysis as astute and broad in scope, they have often questioned his final conclusions. These are regarded by many scholars as hypothesis only, and built on an unstable foundation and {{what can only be}} conjecture. Critics argue that artists during this period painted not for their own pleasure but for commission, while the language and secularization of a post-Renaissance mind-set projected onto Bosch would have been <b>alien</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> late-Medieval painter.|$|E
5|$|In From <b>Alien</b> <b>to</b> <b>The</b> Matrix: Reading Science Fiction Film, Roz Kaveney {{writes that}} Harold Andrews bullies Ellen Ripley, who is {{demoralized}} {{after the events}} of the first two Alien films. According to Kaveney, Andrews' method of directing the prison from monitors is ironic because David Fincher directed the film the same way (which Sigourney Weaver disliked). In David Fincher: Films That Scar, a literary analysis of the director, Mark Browning writes that Harold Andrews' totalitarian control of Fury 161 exempts Dillon's religiosity because Andrews views religion as a tool to prevent violence and provide control. Film critic Malcolm Johnson wrote in a Hartford Courant review that Andrews was a petty but potent dictator, similar to Benito Mussolini.|$|E

The contention that the statute might be supported as a conservation measure was rejected. The state could not, consistent with the United States Constitution, use federally created racial ineligibility for citizenship as a basis for barring petitioner from earning his living as a commercial fisherman in the ocean water off the state coast. <b>The</b> refusal <b>to</b> issue petitioner a commercial fishing license violated U.S. Const. amend.

In a character-breaking occurrence, Perlman nearly compromised a shot of Sigourney Weaver making a basket from behind but editor Hervé Schneid was able to remove Perlman's reaction from the scene. In From <b>Alien</b> <b>to</b> <b>The</b> Matrix: Reading Science Fiction Film, Roz Kaveney interprets Johner and Number 8 as monogamous animals, with a weaker, aggressive male unsuccessfully attempting to seduce a stronger female.|$|E

5|$|Henriksen {{was one of}} {{the several}} actors, {{including}} Michael Biehn and Bill Paxton, cast in Aliens who had collaborated with James Cameron on The Terminator. Roz Kaveney, in her analysis of Ash in From <b>Alien</b> <b>to</b> <b>The</b> Matrix: Reading Science Fiction Film, draws parallels to Bishop as a representation of the Three Laws of Robotics. Although Ash's programming allows (and encourages) harming humans, Bishop puts human life above all else in accordance with the First Law of Robotics. Bishop was studied by LeiLani Nishime of the University of Texas Press in 2005 as a theoretical dramatization of how humans would deal with the presence of an Other, concerning Ripley's initial apprehension about being near a synthetic after her life-threatening encounter with Ash. According to an article by Anton Karl Kozlovic of the University of Nebraska Omaha, Bishop's altruistic actions (which include rescuing Newt and Ripley) contradict a trend towards technophobia in pre-1990 films.|$|E

5|$|When Leo IV died in October 780, his {{sole heir}} {{was the young}} Constantine VI, his son by the Empress Irene of Athens. Due to Constantine's being underage, a regency was instituted under Irene, {{but this was not}} well {{received}} among leading officials. Not only was rule by a woman <b>alien</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> military-dominated establishment of the time, but Irene was also a confirmed iconophile, an adherent of the veneration of holy images. This was regarded as heresy by the state-sponsored doctrine of Iconoclasm, which was especially popular with the army and the officials loyal to Constantine V's memory. A number of them, including the Postal Logothete (foreign minister) Gregory, the former strategos (governor) of the Anatolic Theme Bardas and Constantine, the commander of the Excubitors guard regiment, consequently favoured the rise of Nikephoros to the imperial throne. Barely {{a month and a half}} after Leo's death, the plot was discovered. Irene had the conspirators exiled, and Nikephoros and his younger brothers were ordained as priests, removing them from the line of succession. To confirm this before the people, on Christmas Day 780, Nikephoros and his brothers were forced to perform the communion service in the Hagia Sophia.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study is <b>to</b> see <b>the</b> Turk in the English Renaissance as a threat and yet as a geopolitical adversary.

Sidney 2 ̆ 7 s Letters and Arcadia, Marlowe 2 ̆ 7 s Tamburlaine, and Shakespeare 2 ̆ 7 s Othello fictionalize their authors 2 ̆ 7 response to and comment on the role of the Turk in the sixteenth century.
