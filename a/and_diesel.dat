5|$|Michaels and Diesel's feud resumed at the Royal Rumble when Michaels {{attacked}} Diesel {{during his}} match with Hart. Michaels then became the top {{contender for the}} WWF World Heavyweight Championship by winning the 1995 Royal Rumble match. Diesel won their match at WrestleMania after Sid, Michaels' new bodyguard, accidentally distracted the referee. Diesel offered Michaels a rematch, and Michaels told Sid that his services would not be required during the rematch. Sid attacked Michaels, <b>and</b> <b>Diesel</b> came to Michaels' defense. This attack caused Michaels to turn face, and he <b>and</b> <b>Diesel</b> resumed their friendship and won the WWF Tag Team Championship later in 1995.|$|E

5|$|The Ricardo {{study also}} found that the {{lifecycle}} carbon emissions for mid-sized gasoline <b>and</b> <b>diesel</b> vehicles are almost identical, and that the greater fuel efficiency of the diesel engine is offset by higher production emissions.|$|E
5|$|Amtrak assumed {{control of}} almost all private sector {{intercity}} passenger rail service in the United States on May 1, 1971, with a mandate to reverse decades of decline. Amtrak retained approximately 184 of the 440 trains which had run the day before. To operate these trains, Amtrak inherited a fleet of 300 locomotives (electric <b>and</b> <b>diesel)</b> and 1190 passenger cars, most of which dated from the 1940s–1950s.|$|E
5|$|At Survivor Series 1994, the storyline with Michaels <b>and</b> <b>Diesel</b> saw Michaels accidentally superkick Diesel once again. As a result, Diesel {{turned on}} Michaels, {{becoming}} {{a face and}} vacating the Tag Team Championship. Three days later, Bob Backlund put Diesel over by dropping his WWF World Heavyweight Championship in a match that lasted eight seconds. Diesel feuded with Michaels and defended the belt against him at WrestleMania XI.|$|E

5|$|By the 1980s {{a number}} of {{heritage}} railways had been established in Victoria on closed branch lines. These railways serve both as tourist attractions, and to preserve the railway past. The work of railway preservation groups has since expanded to retired railway carriages, electric multiple units, rail motors, <b>and</b> <b>diesel</b> locomotives. In 2006 heritage railways carried 542,000 patrons over 161km of track; with 28 operational steam locomotives, 47 diesels, 14 railmotors, and 192 carriages.|$|E

5|$|Like other London termini, steam trains were {{phased out}} of Victoria by the 1960s, to be {{replaced}} by suburban electric <b>and</b> <b>Diesel</b> Multiple Unit services. Despite the end of international services following the opening of the Channel Tunnel, Victoria still remains an important London station, and its underground facilities in particular suffer from overcrowding. The Gatwick Express service provides easy access between Central London and Gatwick Airport for international travellers.|$|E

5|$|On August 28, Michaels <b>and</b> <b>Diesel</b> {{captured}} the WWF Tag Team Championship from The Headshrinkers (Samu and Fatu). The {{next day at}} SummerSlam, Diesel lost the Intercontinental Championship to Ramon when Michaels accidentally superkicked Diesel. This triggered a split between Michaels <b>and</b> <b>Diesel,</b> a storyline that was drawn out until Survivor Series that November. Michaels {{went on to win}} the Royal Rumble in 1995, which set up a championship grudge match at WrestleMania XI against Diesel (who had gone on to win the WWF World Heavyweight Championship from Bob Backlund). As part of the storyline, Michaels recruited Sid as his bodyguard for the build-up, lost the match and was attacked by Sid the following night. After this, Michaels took time off because Vince McMahon wanted Michaels to become a fan favorite.|$|E
5|$|Shawn Michaels <b>and</b> <b>Diesel,</b> the WWF Tag Team Champions {{going into}} the event, began feuding after Michaels accidentally kicked Diesel during the match. They vacated their title and began a feud {{that led to a}} match at WrestleMania XI. Three days after Survivor Series, Diesel won the WWF World Heavyweight Championship by {{defeating}} Backlund. The rivalry between Backlund and Bret Hart continued, and they also faced each other at WrestleMania XI.|$|E

The WWF planned to have Perfect <b>and</b> <b>Diesel</b> face each other {{as part of an}} elimination match at Survivor Series 1993, but Mr. Perfect was replaced by Randy Savage at the last minute. Mr. Perfect would not wrestle another pay per view match for the company until Royal Rumble 2002.|$|E

5|$|The WWF World Heavyweight Championship {{match between}} Bret Hart <b>and</b> <b>Diesel</b> came next. Diesel was {{accompanied}} by Shawn Michaels, and Hart was joined by brother-in-law and former tag-team partner Jim Neidhart. Diesel used his size against Hart, but Hart managed to perform a Figure Four leglock on Diesel. After this was broken, the wrestlers fought outside the ring. Michaels got involved and attacked Hart. Back inside the ring, the Hart <b>and</b> <b>Diesel</b> fought as Michaels removed the turnbuckle pad. Hart reversed Diesel's attack, however, and slammed Diesel's head into the turnbuckle. Hart put Diesel in the Sharpshooter, but Diesel easily reached the ropes to break the hold. Michaels attacked Hart while the referee's back was turned, which allowed Diesel to perform the Jackknife powerbomb. Before he could pin Hart, however, Neidhart interfered to cause the disqualification and allow Hart to retain his title. After the match, Diesel and Michaels attacked Hart, but Neidhart left the ring.|$|E

To operate these trains, Amtrak inherited a fleet of 300 locomotives (electric <b>and</b> <b>diesel)</b> and 1190 passenger cars, most of which dated from the 1940s–1950s. These cars were aging, in need of maintenance, {{and in many cases}} incompatible with each other. The company recognized the need and opportunity to standardize on a single design.|$|E
5|$|As of October 2011, {{consumption}} of liquefied petroleum gas, gasoline, kerosene, <b>and</b> <b>diesel</b> has cut between 4 and 19%, {{despite the fact}} that more than 1 million cars have been added to Iran's fleet. Increased use of compressed natural gas (CNG) to fuel cars has also reportedly played a role in this. According to the government, if oil products consumption had not been managed, {{consumption of}} gasoline would have increased to 120 million liters per day, while by reforming consumption pattern the figure has fallen to 60 million liters per day. In November 2011, the Government reported that the subsidy reform plan has saved Iran $6 billion.|$|E

5|$|Connected to a {{spur of the}} Stobcross Railway, the crane's {{primary purpose}} was the lifting of heavy machinery, such as tanks and steam {{locomotives}}, onto ships for export. As many as 30,000 locomotives were hauled {{through the streets of}} Glasgow by Clydesdale horses, traction engines <b>and</b> <b>diesel</b> tractors, from the works at Springburn to the crane for export to the British Empire. The crane is (as of 1988) not in working order, but is retained {{as a symbol of the}} city's engineering heritage.|$|E
5|$|Early {{vehicles}} were {{built by a}} number of independent companies, but in 1844 the railway started to build carriages at Swindon railway works, which eventually provided most of the railway's rolling stock. Special vehicles included sleeping cars, restaurant cars and slip coaches. Passengers were also carried in railmotors, autotrains, <b>and</b> <b>diesel</b> railcars. Passenger-rated vans carried parcels, horses, and milk at express speeds. Representative examples of these carriages survive in service today on various Heritage railways up and down the country.|$|E
5|$|In Victoria {{groups of}} {{locomotives}} {{of the same}} design are classed together by letter, in a system introduced in 1886. Initially low letters were given to passenger classes, and high letters for goods classes, but from about 1916 this pattern was discarded. Within classes locomotives are individually numbered, in a continuous number block which is unique to the class. In some cases locomotives have been renumbered to keep number blocks continuous, {{and in some cases}} there is no correlation between the number blocks used for the steam <b>and</b> <b>diesel</b> locomotives of the same class letter. In addition, some classes start the number series with a 0, while others start with a 1.|$|E
50|$|The {{design was}} {{originally}} conceived as an enlarged {{version of the}} s. The design was however changed radically with a CODOG machinery suite comprising gas turbines <b>and</b> <b>diesels.</b> These ships introduced the use of ship-based helicopters and variable depth sonar into the Italian Navy.|$|R
