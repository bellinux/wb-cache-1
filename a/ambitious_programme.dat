5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Kagame began {{actively}} planning methods to achieve national development. He launched a national consultation process and also sought {{the advice of}} experts from emerging nations including China, Singapore and Thailand. Following these consultations, and shortly after assuming the presidency, Kagame launched an <b>ambitious</b> <b>programme</b> of national development called Vision 2020. The major purposes of the programme were to unite the Rwandan people and to transform Rwanda from a highly impoverished into a middle income country. The programme consists of a list of goals which the government aims to achieve before the year 2020. These include reconstruction, infrastructure and transport improvements, good governance, improving agriculture production, private sector development, and health and education improvements.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} and most {{important}} naturalists to be convinced by Origin of the reality of evolution was the British anatomist Thomas Henry Huxley. Huxley recognized that unlike the earlier transmutational ideas of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, Darwin's theory provided a mechanism for evolution without supernatural involvement, even if Huxley himself was not completely convinced that natural selection was the key evolutionary mechanism. Huxley would make advocacy of evolution a cornerstone of the program of the X Club to reform and professionalise science by displacing natural theology with naturalism and to end the domination of British natural science by the clergy. By the early 1870s in English-speaking countries, thanks partly to these efforts, evolution had become the mainstream scientific explanation for the origin of species. In his campaign for public and scientific acceptance of Darwin's theory, Huxley made extensive use of new evidence for evolution from paleontology. This included evidence that birds had evolved from reptiles, including the discovery of Archaeopteryx in Europe, and a number of fossils of primitive birds with teeth found in North America. Another important line of evidence was the finding of fossils that helped trace the evolution of the horse from its small five-toed ancestors. However, acceptance of evolution among scientists in non-English speaking nations such as France, and the countries of southern Europe and Latin America was slower. An exception to this was Germany, where both August Weismann and Ernst Haeckel championed this idea: Haeckel used evolution to challenge the established tradition of metaphysical idealism in German biology, much as Huxley used it to challenge natural theology in Britain. Haeckel and other German scientists would take the lead in launching an <b>ambitious</b> <b>programme</b> to reconstruct the evolutionary history of life based on morphology and embryology.|$|E

Caledonian MacBrayne won this tender, and formed a separate company called NorthLink Ferries Limited which began operating the Northern Isles ferry service on 6 July 2006.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the state of {{education}} in rural areas of Pakistan indicate an urgent need for policies which will improve the poor performance of existing schools. Social engineering to address gender and class imbalances, laudable though this may be, is counter productive to the immediate need for an elevation in existing basic standards of education. To this end, this paper suggests that educational reforms which do not attempt to challenge popularly held notions of gender and status would produce successful results which might then pave the way for more <b>ambitious</b> <b>programmes</b> in future...|$|R

With the events of 1066 the new regime of Normandy was keen to signal its arrival with an <b>ambitious</b> <b>programme</b> of grandiose cathedrals and castles {{throughout}} the High Middle Ages. Winchester Cathedral was built on the old Anglo-Saxon site and the previous burials, including Cnut's, were set in mortuary chests there. During the English Civil War in the 17th century, plundering Roundhead soldiers scattered the bones of Cnut on the floor and they were spread amongst the various other chests, notably those of William Rufus. After the restoration of the monarchy, the bones were collected and replaced in their chests, although somewhat out of sorts.|$|E

However, in 1963 {{the decision was made}} to close the Weston branch line, and in 1970 the Melalap extension from Tenom was also closed to traffic. The high costs of operation of the lesser used routes and the competition from the many newly built roads made their situation increasingly untenable. In 1974, the main part of the line was also cut from Kota Kinabalu back to Tanjung Aru.|$|E

This paper contrasts these actors’ discourses with evidence from academic research. The evidence suggests a highly uneven economic impact of Internet connectivity across geographies and social strata. The analysed sources of discourse (African ICT policies and reports by international organisations) instead propose Grand Visions of connectivity, attributing a self-evident positive, widespread, and transformational impact to the Internet. We discuss technological determinism, acontextual modernism, and optimistic simplism as underlying this contrast, calling for more reflexivity towards the opportunities of ‘digital development’...|$|R

25|$|Between 1975 and 1991, the MPLA {{implemented}} {{an economic}} and political system based {{on the principles of}} scientific socialism, incorporating central planning and a Marxist–Leninist one-party state. It embarked on an <b>ambitious</b> <b>programme</b> of nationalisation. All locally owned enterprises in every sector of economic activity were nationalised. These were then incorporated into a single umbrella of state-owned enterprises known as Unidades Economicas Estatais (UEE). Under the MPLA, Angola experienced a significant degree of modern industrialisation. However, corruption and graft also increased as public resources were either allocated inefficiently or simply embezzled by officials for personal enrichment. The ruling party survived an attempted coup d'état by the Maoist-oriented Communist Organisation of Angola (OCA) in 1977, which was suppressed after a series of bloody political purges that left thousands of OCA supporters dead.|$|E
25|$|In February 1992, {{and with}} {{amendments}} in January 1995, the Riigikogu renewed Estonia's 1938 citizenship law, which also provides equal civil protection to resident aliens. Elected on an <b>ambitious</b> <b>programme</b> of reform, Mart Laar's cabinet took several decisive measures (Shock therapy). Fast privatization was pursued {{and the role}} of the state in the economy as well as in the social affairs was reduced dramatically. After an initial steep decline in GDP, the Estonian economy started to grow again in 1995. Changes came with a social price: the average life expectancy in Estonia in 1994 was lower than in Belarus, Ukraine and even Moldova. Among the vulnerable sectors of society, the radical reforms sparked an outrage. In January 1993, a pensioners' demonstration took place in Tallinn, as pensioners felt it was impossible to live with a pension as low as the one in effect at the time (260 EEK (around 20 EUR) a month). The meeting was aggressive and demonstrators attacked the minister of social affairs Marju Lauristin.|$|E

50|$|Meanwhile, the {{privatisation}} programme gained momentum in 1999 and 2000 with {{the sale of}} a 35% stake in Maroc Telecom (MT), the telecommunications provider.

500|$|Evolutionary ideas, {{although}} not natural selection, were accepted by German biologists accustomed to ideas of homology in morphology from Goethe's Metamorphosis of Plants {{and from their}} long tradition of comparative anatomy. Bronn's alterations in his German translation added to the misgivings of conservatives, but enthused political radicals. Ernst Haeckel was particularly ardent, aiming to synthesise Darwin's ideas with those of Lamarck and Goethe while still reflecting the spirit of Naturphilosophie. Their <b>ambitious</b> <b>programme</b> to reconstruct the evolutionary history of life was joined by Huxley and supported by discoveries in [...] Haeckel used embryology extensively in his recapitulation theory, which embodied a progressive, almost linear model of evolution.
