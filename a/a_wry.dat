5|$|As he {{continues}} his investigations, Craven is visited by Emma's ghost. The fingerprints on the getaway car used by Emma's killer match that of Lowe, a man Craven arrested ten years previously. Meanwhile, Pendleton takes Craven {{to meet his}} colleague, Harcourt (Ian McNeice), who informs him that Emma {{was a member of}} a subversive anti-nuclear group called GAIA. A team of six GAIA members, led by Emma, had broken into a low level radioactive waste facility at Northmoor; all are now either dead or missing. After Craven makes a televised appeal for information about Emma's killer, he is contacted by CIA agent Darius Jedburgh (Joe Don Baker), an associate of Harcourt and Pendleton. Jedburgh shows Craven the CIA's file on Emma's activities: GAIA had become suspicious of Northmoor when a nearby reservoir had become contaminated with radioactive material, an occurrence that had also alerted the CIA, leading them to believe Northmoor was illegally storing plutonium. Jedburgh is played as a hard-bitten professional with <b>a</b> <b>wry</b> sense of humour and a passion for ballroom dancing. Along with Harcourt and Pendleton, he is keen to find the source and purpose of the plutonium.|$|E

25|$|Tyrone {{then went}} on to win the Ulster Championship, beating Down in a replay, but with a massive margin of victory. After leaking four goals in the drawn match, Harte put Cormac McAnallen into the Full Back {{position}}, from his normal position in midfield. It turned out to be <b>a</b> <b>wry</b> move, Tyrone's ruthlessness in shooting at the posts, was now consolidated with a steadiness in defence.|$|E
25|$|Harold Holt is {{most famously}} commemorated by the Harold Holt Memorial Swimming Centre in the Melbourne suburb of Glen Iris. The complex was under {{construction}} {{at the time}} of Holt's disappearance, and since he was the local member, it was named in his memory. The irony of commemorating a man who is presumed to have drowned with a swimming pool has been <b>a</b> <b>wry</b> source of amusement to many Australians.|$|E

She started writing in the Nabanoor from about 1903, under the name of Mrs. R S Hossain. However, there is an opinion that her first published writing Pipasha appeared in the Nabaprabha in 1902. She wrote regularly for the Saogat, Mahammadi, Nabaprabha, Mahila, Bharatmahila, Al-Eslam, Nawroz, Mahe-Nao, Bangiya Mussalman Sahitya Patrika, The Mussalman, Indian Ladies Magazine, etc. Her writings called upon women to protest against injustices and break the social barriers that discriminated against them.|$|E
25|$|Barks's stories (whether humorous adventures or {{domestic}} comedies) often exhibited <b>a</b> <b>wry,</b> dark irony born of hard experience. The ten-pagers showcased Donald as everyman, struggling against the cruel bumps and bruises {{of everyday life}} with the nephews often acting as a Greek chorus commenting on the unfolding disasters Donald wrought upon himself. Yet while seemingly defeatist in tone, the humanity of the characters shines through in their persistence despite the obstacles. These stories found popularity not only among young children but adults as well. Despite the fact that Barks had done little traveling his adventure stories often had the duck clan globe-trotting to the most remote or spectacular of places. This allowed Barks to indulge his penchant for elaborate backgrounds that hinted at his thwarted ambitions of doing realistic stories in the vein of Hal Foster's Prince Valiant.|$|E

5000|$|A four-minute edit of [...] "Exploitation" [...] {{was later}} issued {{as the first}} single, with a music video {{directed}} by Murphy herself released on 13 April 2015. Murphy commented that the song is about [...] "selling out, manipulation and exploitation within creative work and in a relationship." [...] Murphy later explained that the song [...] "came from being <b>a</b> bit <b>wry,</b> <b>a</b> bit ironic. It's got {{a bit of a}} twinkle in its eye.

500|$|The musical {{was well}} {{received}} by most critics. In his review for The Sentinel, Chris Blackhurst {{brought along a}} seven-year-old child called Dylan Brayford, and his 34-year-old godfather, James Humphreys, from Nantwich to watch the musical. The two [...] "weren't disappointed." [...] Blackhurst said [...] "The fast-paced tale of courage and dreams kept both entertained with plenty of hilarious moments {{for the children and}} a sprinkle of gags which flew over younger fans' heads but brought <b>a</b> <b>wry</b> smile to mums and dads' faces." [...] Brayford summed it up, saying [...] "It was good, but not quite as good as the TV show." ...|$|E
500|$|Variety {{magazine}} {{praised the}} performances, writing, [...] "Dafoe gives a disciplined and noteworthy portrayal of Ward... But it's Hackman who steals the picture as Anderson... Glowing performance of Frances McDormand as the deputy's wife who's drawn to Hackman is an asset both to his role and the picture." [...] Sheila Benson, in her review for the Los Angeles Times, wrote, [...] "Hackman's mastery at suggesting {{an infinite number}} of layers beneath <b>a</b> <b>wry,</b> self-deprecating surface reaches a peak here, but McDormand soars right with him. And since she is the film's sole voice of morality, it's right that she is so memorable." ...|$|E

500|$|... "I'm the Greatest" [...] {{is a song}} {{written by}} English {{musician}} John Lennon that was released as the opening track of the 1973 album Ringo by Ringo Starr. With Starr, Lennon and George Harrison appearing on the track, it marks {{the only time that}} three former Beatles recorded together between the band's break-up in 1970 and Lennon's death in 1980. Lennon wrote the song in December 1970 as <b>a</b> <b>wry</b> comment on his rise to fame, and later tailored the composition for Starr to sing. Named after one of Muhammad Ali's catchphrases, the song partly evokes the stage-show concept of the Beatles' 1967 album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.|$|E
500|$|Dylan {{finished}} the decade on a critical high note with Oh Mercy produced by Daniel Lanois. Michael Gray {{wrote that the}} album was: [...] "Attentively written, vocally distinctive, musically warm, and uncompromisingly professional, this cohesive whole is the nearest thing to a great Bob Dylan album in the 1980s." [...] The track [...] "Most of the Time", a lost love composition, was later prominently featured in the film High Fidelity, while [...] "What Was It You Wanted?" [...] has been interpreted both as a catechism and <b>a</b> <b>wry</b> comment on the expectations of critics and fans. The religious imagery of [...] "Ring Them Bells" [...] struck some critics as a re-affirmation of faith.|$|E

[...] Sukanya Verma (also from Rediff.com) {{described}} it as an [...] "elegant, harmless entertainer for [...] most part", praising the visuals, acting and music. She criticised the screenplay, contending that the film could have been [...] "snappier", and gave it 2.5 (out of 5) stars. Piyasree Dasgupta of First Post wrote: [...] "You have seen everything Jab Tak Hai Jaan has many times before, just in other films. And probably with far better music than A.R.

500|$|The passage {{concludes with}} <b>a</b> <b>wry</b> remark from Holly, [...] "I at last {{managed to get}} to sleep, a fact for which anybody who reads this narrative, if anybody ever does, may very {{probably}} be thankful". According to Stauffer, [...] "the disarming deflation of the passage {{goes a long way}} toward redeeming it, and is typical of the winning contradictions of the narrator's style". Tom Pocock in Rider Haggard and the Lost Empire has also highlighted the [...] "literary framework" [...] that Haggard constructs throughout much of the narrative, referencing Keats, Shakespeare, and Classical literature to imbue the story with a [...] "Gothic sensibility". Yet as Stauffer notes, [...] "Ultimately, however, one thinks of Haggard's plots, episodes, and images as the source of his lasting reputation and influence.|$|E
500|$|The song is {{constructed}} in a verse-pre-chorus-chorus form, with a bridge before {{the third and}} final chorus. It starts with an instrumental introduction, with a simple chord progression of Fm7–Gm7, that is also used during the verses. In the first verse, Geri Halliwell and Emma Bunton trade lines in <b>a</b> <b>wry</b> manner, then the chord progression changes to G7–Bm–G7–Bm–G7–Fm7 during the pre-chorus, which features Melanie Chisholm's vocals prominently. After the chorus, the same pattern occurs leading to the second chorus, with Victoria Beckham and Melanie Brown singing the second verse. Then the group sings the bridge, the pre-chorus, and repeats the chorus until the song gradually fades out with Mel C singing [...] "Groove It!", while Chisholm adds the high harmony—"Swing it, shake it, move it, make it".|$|E
