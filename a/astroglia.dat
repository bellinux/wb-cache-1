50|$|P19 {{cells can}} be {{maintained}} exponential growth because of a stable chromosomal composition. Since embryonal carcinoma can differentiate into cells of all three germ layers, P19 cells can also differentiate into those ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm-like cells. When embryonal carcinoma cells are cultured at high density, they would start differentiation process. By aggregating the cells into embryonic body, EC cells can also process differentiation. In P19 cells, using non-toxic concentration of drugs to aggregated embryoid body cells can induce P19 cells differentiating into specific cell lines based on different drugs. The most two common and effective drugs are retinoic acid (RA) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Studies have shown that a certain concentration of RA can induce P19 cells to differentiate into neuronal cells, including neurons and glial cells. while 0.5% - 1% DMSO led P19 cells differentiate to cardiac or skeletal muscle cells. In the RA treatment method, neurons, <b>astroglia</b> and fibroblasts can be identified after aggregation. Differentiated cells also have choline acetyltransferase and acetyl cholinesterase activities. When treated with DMSO, Cardiac muscle cells developed after 5 days of exposure and skeletal muscle cells appeared after 8 days of exposure. Those studies revealed that the different drug exposure can lead the multipotent P19 cells to different layers of cells. Since the concentration for both drugs are not toxicant to cells, the drug specific differentiation is not due to selection but induction of cells. Mutants of P19 cells were further generated in order to investigate the mechanism of drug specific differentiation. Moreover, signaling pathways related to neurogenesis and myogenesis were also investigated by studying gene expression or generating mutants of P19 cells.|$|E

40|$|Interactions between neurons and glia {{occupy a}} central role in many aspects of development, maintenance, and {{function}} of the central nervous system (CNS). A fundamental event in CNS development is the elaboration of two distinct neuronal processes, axons and dendrites. The overall aim of this research was to characterize the interactions between central nervous system neurons and astroglial cells that regulate dendrite growth from cerebral cortical neurons. Embryonic (E 18) mouse cerebral cortical neurons were cocultured with early postnatal (P 4) rat <b>astroglia</b> derived from cerebral cortex, retina, olfactory bulb, mesencephalon, striatum and spinal cord. Axon and dendrite outgrowth from isolated neurons was quantified using morphological and double-labeling immunohistochemical techniques at 18 hours and 1, 3 and 5 days in vitro. Neurons initially extended the same number of neurites, regardless of the source of glial monolayer; however, astroglial cells differed in their ability to maintain primary dendrites. Homotypic cortical <b>astroglia</b> maintained the greatest number of primary dendrites. <b>Astroglia</b> derived from the olfactory bulb and retina maintained intermediate numbers of dendrites, whereas {{only a small number of}} primary dendrites were maintained by <b>astroglia</b> derived from striatum, spinal cord or mesencephalon. Initially longer axons were observed from neurons grown on <b>astroglia</b> that did not maintain dendrite number. After 5 days in vitro, axon growth was similar on the various monolayers, total primary dendrite outgrowth, however, was nearly threefold greater on <b>astroglia</b> derived from the cortex, retina and olfactory bulb than on <b>astroglia</b> derived from mesencephalon, striatum or spinal cord. This effect was principally on the number of primary dendrites rather than the elongation of individual dendrites and was independent of neuron survival. Similar morphological differences were observed after 5 days in vitro when cortical neurons were grown on polylysine in either a noncontact coculture system where <b>astroglia</b> continuously conditioned the culture medium or in astroglial conditioned medium. Preliminary biochemical analysis of the medium conditioned by cortical <b>astroglia</b> using heat and trypsin degradation, ultracentrifugation, dialysis, and heparin affinity chromatography suggested that a heparin binding protein with a molecular weight between 10 and 100 kDa may be responsible for astroglial mediated dendrite growth. Neurons that were grown in medium conditioned by either mesencephalic or cortical <b>astroglia</b> for the first 24 hours followed by culture medium from <b>astroglia</b> of the alternate source for 4 days in vitro, confirmed that <b>astroglia</b> maintained, rather than initiated, the outgrowth of the primary dendritic arbor. In the next series of experiments, E 18 mouse cortical neurons were cocultured with neonatal (P 4) or mature (P 12) rat <b>astroglia</b> derived from cortex and mesencephalon or <b>astroglia</b> derived from P 4 and P 12 lesioned cortex. After 5 days in vitro, the maturational age of <b>astroglia</b> did not appear to alter the extent of primary dendrite growth; instead dendrite growth reflected the region of the CNS from which the <b>astroglia</b> were derived. By contrast, a reduced ability to support axon growth from mouse cortical neurons in culture was observed on <b>astroglia</b> derived from mature rat cortex or mesencephalon. Reactive <b>astroglia</b> demonstrated similar neurite supporting characteristics to mature <b>astroglia</b> and were able to maintain dendrite growth, principally primary dendrite number. Axon elongation, however, was reduced on both neonatal and mature reactive <b>astroglia.</b> Neuron survival did not correlate with the ability of the various <b>astroglia</b> to support process outgrowth. Collectively these results indicate: 1) neuron-glial interactions are critical for the regulation of process outgrowth from embryonic cortical neurons in vitro, 2) axon and dendrite growth appear to be differently controlled by <b>astroglia,</b> 3) CNS <b>astroglia</b> demonstrate regional differences in maintaining, but not initiating growth of the primary dendritic arbor, 4) this effect may be due, in part, to release of a diffusible heparin binding protein factor, and 5) mature and reactive <b>astroglia</b> support primary dendrite, but limited axon growth. We propose therefore that the local astroglial environment maintains primary dendrite growth from neurons until synaptic contacts can be established. A mechanism that maintains the primary dendritic arbor and allows separate regulation of axon and dendrite growth, prior to the arrival of afferents, may be critical for establishing appropriate and specific synaptic connections. These findings have important implications in understanding development and function of the mammalian central nervous system and may lead to novel strategies for intervention in acute and chronic neurological disorders...|$|E

Cerebellar tissue harvested from C 57 Bl/ 6 J mouse cerebellum on the third or fourth day postnatal was dissociated into a single cell suspension with trypsin, and enriched glial and neuronal fractions were separated with a step gradient of Percoll. Highly purified astroglial and neuronal fractions resulted from subsequently preplanting the cells on a polylysine-coated culture surface.

40|$|<b>Astroglia</b> {{from the}} {{postnatal}} cerebral cortex can be reprogrammed in vitro to generate neurons following forced expression of neurogenic transcription factors, thus opening new avenues towards a potential use of endogenous <b>astroglia</b> for brain repair. However, in previous attempts astroglia-derived neurons failed to establish functional synapses, a severe limitation towards functional neurogenesis. It remained therefore also unknown whether neurons derived from reprogrammed <b>astroglia</b> could be directed towards distinct neuronal subtype identities by selective expression of distinct neurogenic fate determinants.

Importantly, the neurotransmitter fate choice of astroglia-derived neurons can be controlled by selective expression of distinct neurogenic transcription factors: forced expression of the dorsal telencephalic fate determinant neurogenin- 2 (Neurog 2) directs cortical <b>astroglia</b> to generate synapse-forming glutamatergic neurons; in contrast, the ventral telencephalic fate determinant Dlx 2 induces a GABAergic identity, although the overall efficiency of Dlx 2 -mediated neuronal reprogramming is much lower compared to Neurog 2, suggesting that cortical <b>astroglia</b> possess a higher competence {{to respond to the}} dorsal telencephalic fate determinant.

40|$|<b>Astroglia</b> {{play key}} {{roles in the}} {{development}} of neurons, ranging from regulating neuron survival to promoting synapse formation, yet basic questions remain about whether astrocytes might be involved in forming the dendritic arbor.

When <b>astroglia</b> were proximal to neurons, dendrites and dendritic filopodia oriented toward them, but the general presence of <b>astroglia</b> significantly reduced overall dendrite growth.

Thus, while <b>astroglia</b> promoted the formation of presynaptic contacts onto dendrites, dendritic growth was constrained locally within a developing arbor at sites where dendrites contacted <b>astroglia.</b> Taken together, these observations reveal influences on spatial orientation of growth as well as influences on morphogenesis of the dendritic arbor that have not been previously identified...|$|E

Mutations in angiogenin, encoding {{a member of}} the pancreatic RNase A superfamily, segregate with ALS. We previously demonstrated that angiogenin administration shows promise as a neuroprotective therapeutic in studies using transgenic ALS mice and primary motoneuron cultures. Its mechanism of action and target cells in the spinal cord, however, are largely unknown. Using mixed motoneuron cultures, motoneuron-like NSC 34 cells, and primary <b>astroglia</b> cultures as model systems, we here demonstrate that angiogenin is a neuronally secreted factor that is endocytosed by <b>astroglia</b> and mediates neuroprotection in paracrine.

Angiogenin uptake into <b>astroglia</b> requires heparan sulfate proteoglycans, and engages clathrin-mediated endocytosis.

Moreover, we identify syndecan 4 as the angiogenin receptor mediating the selective uptake of angiogenin into <b>astroglia.</b> Our data provide new insights into the paracrine activities of angiogenin in the nervous system, and further highlight the critical role of non-neuronal cells in the pathogenesis of ALS...|$|E

Findings The <b>astroglia</b> from two different rat brain regions, cortex (region affected in AD) and cerebellum (unaffected region), were treated with 0. 2 mM of palmitic acid.

Lead (Pb) is a ubiquitous environmental contaminant which has been linked to neurobehavioral deficits, primarily in young children.

This property of <b>astroglia</b> is thought to develop with age, and is not present in very young animals. The {{purpose of this study was}} to test three hypotheses: that maturation of neuronal cells affects their Pb accumulation, that soluble factors secreted into astroglial environment alters their Pb accumulation, and that <b>astroglia</b> preferentially sequester Pb over neurons. In an initial experiment, SY 5 Y human neuroblastoma cells were exposed to medium containing low levels of Pb and Neuronal Growth Factor-b (NGF-b), a soluble factor secreted by <b>astroglia</b> which induces cell maturation.

Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS) was used to determine Pb amounts, which were expressed per number of cells. Results showedneuronal cell maturation, induced by NGF-b, lead to a decrease in Pb uptake. Furthermore, soluble factors secreted by neuronal cells caused a significant increase in the amount of Pb uptake by cultured <b>astroglia,</b> as determined in both conditioned medium and co-culture experiments.

Immunocytochemical localization of antisera raised against purified glial filament protein (AbGF) and transmission electron microscopy were used to visualize specific associations between granule neurons and <b>astroglia</b> in microcultures of cerebellar cells dissociated from normal (+/+), heterozygous (+/ wu), and homozygous (wu/wu) BGCBA-w mouse cerebella. In microcultures of cells dissociated from normal BGCBA-A”-J-wu (+/+) cerebella, staining with AbGF closely resembled results previously reported for cells taken from C 57 BL/ 6 J (+/+) tissue. Two forms of stained <b>astroglia</b> were seen, one with a larger perikaryon and shorter processes, among which 12 to 20 unstained cells nestled, and another with a smaller cell soma and longer processes, along which a few unstained cells were seen. The first resembled astrocytes of the internal granular layer and white matter, the second Bergmann <b>astroglia.</b> In microcultures of heterozygous animals (+/wu), the number of granule cells was reduced slightly. Many stained <b>astroglia</b> resembled those from +/+ cerebella, but others had thickened processe...|$|E
40|$|Rapid signal {{exchange}} between <b>astroglia</b> and neurons {{has emerged as}} {{an essential element of}} neural circuits of the brain. However, the increasing variety of mechanisms contributing to this signalling appears to be facing a conceptual stalemate. The communication medium of <b>astroglia</b> involves intracellular [Ca 2 +] waves, which until recently have been associated with slow, global [Ca 2 +] rises. How such a uniform trigger could handle fast and iverse molecular messages remains unexplained. Recent studies have, however, revealed a variety of apparently independent Ca 2 + activities within individual astrocytic compartments, also indicating the prevalence of subcellular segregation for some signalling mechanisms. These signs of intracellular compartmentalisation might provide the key to the multitude of adaptive roles played by <b>astroglia...</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Astroglia</b> is a main type {{of brain}} neuroglia, which {{includes}} many cell sub-types that {{differ in their}} morphology and physiological properties and yet are united by the main function, which is the maintenance of brain homeostasis. Astrocytes employ a variety of mechanisms for communicating with neuronal networks. The communication mediated by neurotransmitter glutamate has received a particular attention. Glutamate is de novo synthesized exclusively in astrocytes; astroglia-derived glutamine {{is the source of}} glutamate for neurons. Glutamate is released from both neurons and <b>astroglia</b> through exocytosis, although various other mechanisms may also play a role. Glutamateactivated specific receptors trigger excitatory responses in neurons and <b>astroglia.</b> Here we overview main properties of glutamatergic transmission in neuronal-glial networks and identify some future challenges facing the field...|$|E
40|$|Previously we {{have used}} a {{microwell}} tissue culture assay to show that early postnatal mouse cerebellar <b>astroglia</b> have a flattened morphology and proliferate rapidly when they are cultured in the absence of neurons, but develop specific cell-cell contacts and undergo morphological differentiation when they are co-cultured with purified granule neurons (Hatten, M. E., 1985, J. Cell Biol., 100 : 384 - 396). In these studies of cell binding between neurons and <b>astroglia,</b> measurement with light and fluorescence microscopy or with [35 S]methionine-labeled cells indicated that the kinetics of the binding of the neurons to astroglial cells are rapid, occurring within 10 min of the addition of the neurons to the growing glia. 6 h after neuronal attachment, astroglial DNA synthesis decreases, as shown by a two- to fivefold decrease in [3 H]thymidine incorporation, and glial growth ceases. No effects on astroglial cell growth were seen after adding medium conditioned by purified cerebellar neurons cultured in the absence of <b>astroglia,</b> by <b>astroglia</b> cultured in the absence of neurons, or by a mixed population of cerebellar cells. This result was unchanged when any of these media were concentrated up to 50 -fold, or when neurons and <b>astroglia</b> were cultured in separate chambers with confluent medium. Two groups of experiments suggest that membrane- membrane interactions between granule neurons and <b>astroglia</b> control astroglial cell growth. First, neurons fixed with dilute amounts of paraformaldehyde (0. 5 %) bound to the <b>astroglia</b> with the same kinetics as did living cells, inhibited DNA synthesis, and arrested glial growth within hours. Second, a cell membrane preparation of highly purified granule neurons also bound rapidly to the glia, decreased [3 H]thymidine incorporation two- to fivefold and inhibited astroglial cell growth. The rate of the decrease in glial growth depended on the concentration of the granule neural membrane preparation added. A similar membrane preparation from purified cerebellar astroglial cells, PC 12 cells, 3 T 3 mouse fibroblasts, or PTK rat epithelial cells did not decrease astroglial cell growth rates. Living neurons were the only preparation that both inhibited glial DNA synthesis and induced the astroglial cells to transform from the flat, epithelial shapes they have when they are cultured without neurons to highly differentiated forms that resemble Bergmann glia or astrocytes seen in vivo. These results suggest that membrane-membrane interactions between neurons and <b>astroglia</b> inhibit astroglial proliferation in vitro, and raise the possibility that membrane elements involved in glial growth regulation include neuron-glial interaction molecules...|$|E
40|$|Specific {{interactions}} between neurons and glia dissociated from early postnatal mouse cerebellar tissue were studied in vitro by indirect immunocytochemical staining with antisera raised against purified glial filament protein, galactocerebroside, and the NILE glycoprotein. Two forms of cells were stained with antisera raised against purified glial filament protein. The first, {{characterized by a}} cell body 9 microns diam and processes 130 - 150 microns long, usually had two to three neurons associated with them and resembled Bergmann glia. The second had a slightly larger cell body with markedly shorter arms among which were nestled several dozen neuronal cells, and resembled astrocytes of the granular layer. Staining with monoclonal antisera raised against purified galactocerebroside revealed the presence of immature oligodendroglia in the cultures. These glial cells constituted approximately 2 % of the total cell population in the cultures and, in contrast to <b>astroglia,</b> did not form specific contacts with neurons. Staining with two neuronal markers, antisera raised against purified NILE glycoprotein and tetanus toxin, revealed that most cells associated with presumed <b>astroglia</b> were small neurons (5 - 8 microns). After 1 - 2 d in culture, some stained neurons had very fine, short processes. Nearly all of the processes greater than 10 - 20 micron long were glial in origin. Electron microscopy also demonstrated the presence of two forms of <b>astroglia</b> in the cultures, each with a different organizing influence on cerebellar neurons. Most neurons associated with <b>astroglia</b> were granule neurons, although a few larger neurons sometimes associated with them. Time-lapse video microscopy revealed extensive cell migration (approximately 10 microns/h) along the arms of Bergmann-like <b>astroglia.</b> In contrast, cells did not migrate along the arms of astrocyte-like <b>astroglia,</b> but remained stationary at or near branch points. Growth cone activity, pulsating movements of cell perikarya, and ruffling of the membranes of glial and neuronal processes were also seen...|$|E
40|$|The {{in vitro}} effects of viral {{replication}} on mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) were evaluated as two parameters of potential cellular injury. Two distinct cell types were {{infected with the}} Petaluma strain of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). Primary <b>astroglia</b> supported acute FIV infection, resulting in syncytia within 3 days of infection, whereas immortalized Crandell feline kidney (CRFK) cells of epithelial origin supported persistent FIV infection {{in the absence of}} an obvious cytopathic effect. An examination of cells under conditions that included an infection rate of more than 90 % for either population revealed that the <b>astroglia</b> produced about four times more virus than the CRFK cells. The mitochondrial uptake of the cationic fluorescent dye rhodamine 123 in infected <b>astroglia</b> was less than 45 % of that of normal control cells, whereas the MMP of the CRFK cells, which produced about one-fourth as much virus, was 80. 8 % of that of the normal cells. Cell-cell communication between adjacent cells was determined by the recovery of fluorescence following photobleaching of a single cell. In spite of the lower level of innate cell-cell communication among cultured CRFK cells than among <b>astroglia,</b> viral replication resulted in a 30 % decrease in the GJIC of both <b>astroglia</b> and CRFK cells. These studies indicate that cell injury, as defined by an inhibition of MMP and GJIC, can occur as a result of persistent and acute infection with the Petaluma strain of FIV...|$|E
