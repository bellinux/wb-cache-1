25|$|New Zealand {{elections}} traditionally occur after September in {{the third}} year following the last election, <b>and</b> <b>snap</b> elections occur rarely; the only three elections out of sync in the period of 1948 to 2008 took place in 1951, 1984 and 2002—and the last two came only a few months early.

25|$|After {{the civil}} unrest, the climate in Moldova became very polarized. The {{parliament}} failed {{to elect a}} new president.

That gave the former ruling party 48 MPs, and the remaining 53 seats in the 101-member chamber went to four opposition parties. Opposition parties agreed to create the Alliance for European Integration that pushed the Communist party into opposition. The Communists were in government since 2001.|$|E

He therefore tendered his resignation as Prime Minister to President Giorgio Napolitano, who accepted it and appointed the President of the Senate, Franco Marini, with the task of evaulating possibilities for forming interim government to implement electoral reforms prior to holding elections. Marini, after consultation with all major political forces, acknowledged the impossibility of doing so on 5 February, forcing Napolitano to announce the end of the legislature. Prodi said that he would not seek to lead a new government <b>and</b> <b>snap</b> election were called.

25|$|It is {{only during}} the {{breeding}} season males congregate around a female in estrus for a few hours. All spiral-horned antelope species are polyandrous. Aggression is very low among individuals of both sexes though intraspecific competition does occur. In females often they neck-fight as well poke <b>and</b> <b>snap</b> at each other. Males would use their horns for wrestling where they try to attack the face. Sometimes there is even intimation from the males to persuade the female into submission as often she would try and retaliate. The gestation period occurs once the female has been inseminated from the male successfully. In most species it lasts approximately seven months, although in the larger species this extends to eight or nine months. They only {{give birth to a}} single calf. Once the young are born, they won't wean until they are around five to six months of age. Females sexually mature by two to three years while for males it is four to five years.|$|E
25|$|September {{began with}} a {{familiar}} feel for D.C. United fans. After almost a two-week break that saw the Red Bulls pass United in the standings and seize {{first place in the}} Eastern Conference, D.C. United traveled to Denver to face Colorado Rapids. Even with Espindola back in the lineup, United's offense continued to struggle to string together any passes or to generate scoring chances. The Rapids went out to a first half lead when defender Bobby Burling capitalized on a poor clearance by Saborio with a shot that sneaked past Hamid. United managed to rescue a point <b>and</b> <b>snap</b> their 3-game MLS losing streak when Steve Birnbaum finished off a free kick play with a header for a late goal that gave United a 1–1 draw. The result drew United into a numerical tie for first place, but the Red Bulls had played 3 fewer games. Perhaps more importantly, the result in Colorado left United one point of ahead of Columbus Crew SC, with the two teams scheduled to face each other the following weekend in Washington, D.C. If the first team continued to struggle in MLS play, the reserves continued United's good fortune and winning streak in CONCACAF Champions League play. United won its seventh straight group play match over two years, with a 2–0 home-field win over Arabe Unido. Conor Doyle got United on the board in the first minute off an assist from Pontius, and Jeffrey doubled the lead later in the match with a header off a corner kick taken by Coria. The 2–0 clinched first place in the group, sending United through once more to the knockout stages to be played in 2016.|$|E

25|$|Clayton Kershaw started August off on {{the right}} foot, {{pitching}} his fourth complete {{game of the season}} and picking up his league leading 13th win in the 6-2 road victory over the San Diego Padres. In his first start since electing not to be traded, Hiroki Kuroda was masterful, pitching seven shutout innings while striking out eight as the Dodgers beat the Padres 1-0 for Kuroda's first win since July 1. The news was not all good on the day however, as the team announced that rookie starter Rubby De La Rosa would have to undergo season ending Tommy John surgery. He was 4-5 with a 3.71 ERA for the Dodgers during his 13 appearances (10 starts). Ted Lilly allowed only one run (on a solo homer by Jason Bartlett) in six innings the next day, but it was not enough as Tim Stauffer shut the Dodgers down and the bullpen coughed up a couple more runs in a 3-0 loss to the Padres. Chad Billingsley picked up his 10th win on August 5 against the Arizona Diamondbacks, 7-4. This would be the fifth straight season with double digit wins for Billingsley. The Dodgers scored six runs on seven hits in the third inning to open up the lead. Javy Guerra picked up his first four out save for his 10th of the season. On August 6, the Dodger promoted Nathan Eovaldi from the Double-A Chattanooga Lookouts to make the start against the Diamondbacks. In his Major League debut, he pitched five innings while allowing only two runs and striking out seven. The Dodgers did just enough offensively to get Eovaldi the win, 5-3. Cody Ransom hit a two-run homer in the seventh inning to help the Diamondbacks avoid a sweep <b>and</b> <b>snap</b> Clayton Kershaw's five-game winning streak.|$|E
