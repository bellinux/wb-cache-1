5|$|This {{does not}} mean that a Category5 {{hurricane}} cannot form outside of <b>an</b> <b>El</b> Niño event. The entire year of 1959 was neither <b>an</b> <b>El</b> Niño or a La Niña, but it had one Category5 hurricane (Patsy). Most of 1973 was during a La Niña, which reduces tropical cyclone activity in the eastern Pacific, yet Hurricane Ava, a Category 5 hurricane, formed in June of that year.|$|E

5|$|From October to December each year, a {{very large}} area of south India, {{including}} Tamil Nadu, the coastal regions of Andhra Pradesh and the union territory of Puducherry, receives up to 60 percent of its annual rainfall from the northeast monsoon (or winter monsoon). The northeast monsoon {{is the result of}} the annual gradual retreat of monsoonal rains from northeastern India. Unlike during the regular monsoon, rainfall during the northeast monsoon is sporadic, but typically far exceeds the amount produced by the regular monsoon by up to 90 percent. This excessive rainfall can be exacerbated by <b>an</b> <b>El</b> Nino year, which 2015 was.|$|E

5|$|In October 1849 the {{southern}} interests held a convention to discuss railroads in Memphis, {{in response to}} a convention in St. Louis earlier that fall which discussed a northern route. The Memphis convention overwhelmingly advocated the construction of a route beginning there, to connect with <b>an</b> <b>El</b> Paso, Texas to San Diego, California line. Disagreement arose only over the issue of financing. The convention president, Matthew Fontaine Maury of Virginia, preferred strict private financing, whereas John Bell and others thought that federal land grants to railroad developers would be necessary.|$|E

5|$|Luis Gómez, <b>an</b> <b>El</b> Pais writer, {{believed}} that the route was designed to benefit the Italian participants, with there being three individual time trials, the team time trial being flat, and most stages being primarily flat. El Mundo writer Javier Dalmases {{believed that}} the route was purposefully less mountainous so that an Italian would win the race, citing that this route favored the likes of Giuseppe Saronni or Moreno Argentin. La Stampas Gian Paolo Ormezzano thought overall easiness of the course — the few mountains and summit finishes — added some mystery as to who could win.|$|E

5|$|Pre-season {{forecasts}} by the Colorado State University (CSU) {{called for}} a below average season, with 10 named storms, 4 hurricanes, and 2 major hurricanes. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) issued its first outlook on May24, predicting a total of 9–15 named storms, 4–8 hurricanes, and 1–3 major hurricanes; both agencies noted the possibility of <b>an</b> <b>El</b> Niño, which limits tropical cyclone activity. Following two pre-season storms, the CSU updated their forecast to 13 named storms, 5 hurricanes, and 2 major hurricanes, while the NOAA upped their forecast numbers to 12–17 named storms, 5–8 hurricanes, and 2–3 major hurricanes on August9. Despite this, activity far surpassed the predictions.|$|E

5|$|The season had eleven {{tropical}} depressions, {{of which}} nine intensified into tropical storms, three became hurricanes, and two became major hurricanes. The inactivity throughout the basin {{was linked to}} the formation of <b>an</b> <b>El</b> Niño, which increased wind shear. The two most significant storms of the season, in terms of loss of life and damage, were Hurricanes Bill and Ida. Hurricane Bill was an unusually large storm and was also the season's strongest, attaining winds of 135mph (215km/h). Tropical Storm Claudette was the only storm during 2009 to make landfall in the United States; Hurricane Ida became extratropical shortly before coming ashore in Alabama.|$|E
5|$|The {{season was}} fairly active, with fifteen {{tropical}} cyclones forming. It {{was the first}} time since the 1971 season that there were no active tropical cyclones in the Atlantic basin during the month of June. The season was neutral, having neither <b>an</b> <b>El</b> Niño nor a La Niña. Three tropical cyclones during in the Atlantic Ocean in 1980were notable. Hurricane Allen was then the earliest Category5 hurricane on record and also devastated portions of the Caribbean Sea, Mexico, and the United States. Tropical Storm Hermine caused significant flooding in Mexico, which resulted in at least 38fatalities. Hurricane Jeanne was one of only four tropical cyclones at hurricane intensity to enter the Gulf of Mexico and not make landfall.|$|E
5|$|The {{starting}} peloton did {{not include}} the 1985 winner, Bernard Hinault. <b>An</b> <b>El</b> Mundo Deportivo writer believed LeMond, Moser, and Saronni to be the favorites to win the overall crown. In addition, the writer felt that Pedro Muñoz had the best chances to win the race, out of all the Spanish riders entering the event. Atala-Ofmega sports director Franco Criblori believed that Saronni's results would depend on what form he could maintain in the mountains. In addition, Criblori thought Dutchman Johan van der Velde and Swiss rider Niki Rüttimann were two foreigners to consider for a high place in the general classification.|$|E

5|$|A {{total of}} 118Category4 hurricanes have been {{recorded}} in the eastern and central Pacific basins since 1900. Only two Category4 hurricanes {{have been recorded}} in May, in addition to 12in June, 22in July, 29in August, 32in September, 18in October, and two in November. No Category4 storms have developed during the off-season. It is theorized that global warming was responsible for an increase of 13Category4 and 5 storms that developed in the eastern Pacific, from 36in the period of 1975–1989 to 49in the period of 1990–2004. It was estimated that if sea-surface temperatures ascended by 2 to 2.5degrees, the intensity of tropical cyclones would increase by 6–10% internationally. During years with the existence of <b>an</b> <b>El</b> Niño, sea-surface temperatures increase in the eastern Pacific, resulting {{in an increase in}} activity as vertical wind shear decreases in the Pacific; the opposite happens in the Atlantic basin during El Niño, when wind shear increases creating an unfavourable environment for tropical cyclone formation in the Atlantic. Contrary to El Niño, La Niña increases wind shear over the eastern Pacific and reduces it over the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|Although Fausto headed {{generally}} northwest while {{a tropical}} cyclone, it curved west-northwest after degenerating into a remnant low. Passing several hundred {{miles north of}} Hawaii, deep convection began to re-develop as the remnants of Fausto interacted with a tropical upper tropospheric trough. By 1800 UTC on August28, the low had enough deep convection to be reclassified as a tropical depression while located roughly 635mi (1020km) north of Oahu. No further re-intensification occurred for almost 48 hours, and then Fausto became a tropical storm again at 1800 UTC September1. This regeneration at high latitude was attributed to a temperature anomaly with waters 3.4°F (2°C) above normal and a favorable upper-level atmospheric pattern. Although sea surface temperature anomalies are usually attributed {{to the development of}} <b>an</b> <b>El</b> Niño, the El Niño had no effect with atmospheric conditions. A mid-latitude cyclone approached Tropical Storm Fausto and caused the system to accelerate northward. The mid-latitude cyclone eventually absorbed Fausto, and the combined system reached the Aleutian Islands of Alaska shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the line's planning, Downtown Flushing was a quiet Dutch-colonial-style village; what is now Roosevelt Avenue in the area was known as Amity Street, a major {{commercial}} thoroughfare in the neighborhood. In late 1912, Flushing community groups were petitioning the Public Service Commission (PSC) to depress the proposed line in Flushing into a subway tunnel, rather than an elevated line. Unlike a subway, <b>an</b> <b>el</b> would cause disturbances to the quality of life and a loss in nearby property values, as well as a widening of Amity Street that would cause more changes to the already existing town. One Amity Street property owner compared the planned effect of an elevated Flushing Line on Amity Street to the degradation of Myrtle Avenue in Brooklyn after the Myrtle Avenue Elevated was built there. On the other hand, a subway would only require that the street be widened, even though it was more expensive than an elevated of the same length.|$|E
