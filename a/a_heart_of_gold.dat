Following the success of Nagin, Vyjayanthimala {{established}} herself as one of Bollywood's leading actresses while making inroads in successful Tamil and Telugu films. After successfully establishing herself as a commercial actress, Vyjayanthimala appeared in Devdas, playing Chandramukhi, the hooker with <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>gold,</b> in 1955. In her first dramatic role, she received her first Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress at the 4th Filmfare Awards, where she refused to accept the award citing that hers was not a supporting role, being the first person to refuse a Filmfare Award. Following that, Vyjayanthimala appeared in series of blockbuster films such as New Delhi, Naya Daur and Aasha. She reached the pinnacle of her success in 1958, when two of her films — Sadhna and Madhumati — became huge critical and commercial hits. She was nominated for two Filmfare Award for Best Actress Award for Sadhna and Madhumati and won the award for the former.|$|E

However, he was ultimately very pleased with Paula Sorge's performance, stating [...] "In fact, she was even better than how I had written the character. In Paula's audition, she came off like a world-weary wise-ass who was not only tough and smart, but had <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>gold.</b> She made it a really fun character." [...] The casting process to find an actress for the part took so long that an idea Gilligan had to give the character double pupils had to be scrapped when the production team ran out of time to source them. Instead, she wore contacts over her already blue eyes to make them brighter, and a blue jewel on her cheekbone.|$|E
500|$|According to {{film critic}} Roger Ebert, Susie adheres to the Hollywood {{tradition}} of being {{depicted as a}} hooker with <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>gold,</b> while her tough demeanor {{is little more than}} an act. Matt Brunson of Creative Loafing described Susie as a [...] "tough-talking, street-smart" [...] character who is [...] "always ready with a quip (or a sharp counter to a quip)." [...] Writing for The Daily Beast, Elizabeth Kaye identified Susie as [...] "a woman who must battle to keep her emotions from showing". Film Quarterlys Steve Vineberg wrote that the character boasts [...] "a cannily concealed underlayer of childlike dreaminess," [...] comparing her appearance and wardrobe to that of singer Ricky Lee Jones. Wounded by life, Susie wears an [...] "armor" [...] that is both impenetrable yet makes others want to experience more of the character. Kaye felt that the role was especially poignant for Pfeiffer, who in real life had still been recovering from an affair with actor John Malkovich {{at the same time she}} was filming The Fabulous Baker Boys.

500|$|Levi's {{performance}} has garnered widespread acclaim from critics, who enjoyed the actor's comedic delivery and singing voice. Praising the directors' decision to [...] " [...] big-name stars {{in favor of}} lesser-known talent", TV Guide described Levi's performance as [...] "charming, roguish, and, well, generic enough". Similarly, Mike Scott of The Times-Picayune wrote that Levi [...] "comes off as an exaggerated, narcissistic version of the rascally Tory Belleci from TV's MythBusters", complimenting the fact that [...] "the cast's names are less than household stature". Rafer Guzman of Newsday described Levi's performance as [...] "terrific". ABC Online appreciated the fact that [...] "the voices of the hero and heroine were not recognisable", concluding, [...] "Zachary Levi and Mandy Moore ... do {{a really good job}} on the voices". Dustin Hucks of Film School Rejects wrote that Levi [...] "creates a significant amount of range and emotion with his voice that truly makes the suave thief with <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>gold</b> Flynn pop on the screen". Hucks went on to call Flynn [...] "one the better [...] that have come out of the Disney stable in quite a while". Mathew DeKinder of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch appreciated the comedy in Levi's [...] "quick-tongued delivery", while Rolling StonesPeter Travers wrote that the actor [...] "does a nice job" [...] as Flynn. James Luxford of The National wrote that both Levi and Moore [...] "adeptly flesh out what could have been basic characters", while Digital Spys Simon Reynolds described Levi as [...] "excellent as the rogueish hero". Stephen Whitty of The Star-Ledger called Levi [...] "a surprisingly perfect choice for the self-mocking Flynn". Also pleasantly surprised, David Nusair of About.com wrote that [...] "Levi effortlessly captures the character's transformation from a vain (yet charismatic) rogue to a compassionate love interest".

Rekha once confessed, [...] "After reading the script, I had a strange feeling that I had Umrao in me." [...] In preparation for the role, Rekha, who at the beginning of her career did not speak Hindi, took the task of learning the finer nuances of the Urdu language. Director Muzaffar Ali later noted that [...] "Rekha has given more than my conception of the role." [...] The response to her work was universally positive. Her portrayal is considered to be one of her career-best performances, and she was awarded the National Film Award for Best Actress for it.

2500|$|In 1935, at age 34, Arthur starred {{opposite}} Edward G. Robinson in {{the gangster}} farce The Whole Town's Talking, also directed by Ford, and her popularity began to rise. It {{was the first}} time Arthur portrayed a hard-boiled working girl with <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>gold,</b> the type of role she would be associated with {{for the rest of her}} career. She enjoyed the acting experience and working opposite Robinson, who remarked in his biography that it was a [...] "delight to work with and know" [...] Arthur. By the time of the film's release, her hair, naturally brunette throughout the silent film portion of her career, was bleached blonde and would mostly stay that way. She was known for maneuvering to be photographed and filmed almost exclusively from the left; Arthur felt that her left was her best side, and worked hard to keep it in the fore. Director Frank Capra recalled producer Harry Cohn's description of Jean Arthur's imbalanced profile: [...] "half of it's angel, and the other half horse." [...] Her next few films, Party Wire (1935), Public Hero No. 1 (1935) and If You Could Only Cook (1935), did not match the success of The Whole Town's Talking, but they all brought the actress positive reviews. In his review for The New York Times, critic Andre Sennwald praised Arthur's performance in Public Hero No. 1, writing that she [...] "is as refreshing a change from the routine it-girl as Joseph Calleia is in his own department." [...] Another critic wrote of her performance in If You Could Only Cook that [...] " [...] outstanding as she effortlessly slips from charming comedienne to beautiful romantic." [...] With her now apparent rise to fame, Arthur was able to extract several contractual concessions from Harry Cohn, such as script and director approval and the right to make films for other studios.|$|E

While there, the Luthor robot tampers with the body chemistry of the previously-captured Reactron. Shortly thereafter, Reactron kills himself, initiating a chain reaction which ultimately destroys New Krypton and all but a handful of its 100,000 inhabitants.

This is a jewel in the rough, and roughness (along with wit) is what gives it a shine. There are shadowy, sub-slick sets (partly lifted from old Cormanoids like Battle Beyond the Stars), and the plot features three grubby space outlaws -- two varmints and a vamp -- played with lots of slumming gusto by Brie Howard, Norbert Weisser and Crofton Hardester... Max {{is a bit of a}} wimp, but brainy, and with <b>a</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> computerized <b>gold.</b> He is keen on self-programming, and he studies old, 20th century movies and gently bones up on the human styles of Humphrey Bogart and James Stewart...
