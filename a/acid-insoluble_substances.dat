40|$|After a 5 -hour {{incubation}} of protoplasts of Nicotiana tabacum L. `Xanthi' with 3 H-DNA (7. 26 Î¼g/ml) from N. tabacum L. `Xanthi nc' 3. 5 % of {{the initial}} radioactivity was found in <b>acid-insoluble</b> <b>substances</b> of the protoplasts. The addition of DEAE-dextran and poly-l-lysine to the incubation medium nearly doubled radioactivity adsorption. The absorption was inhibited by 2, 4 -dinitrophenol, KCN, and low temperature (0 C); this inhibition could not be reversed by exogenous ATP. About 500 tobacco plants established from protoplasts of a normally tobacco-mosaic virus-susceptible cultivar that {{had been allowed to}} absorb DNA prepared from a resistant cultivar did not show transfer of the virus-resistant gene...|$|E
