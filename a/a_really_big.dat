Because the scene consists entirely of auditive gags, the Simpsons staff had difficulty figuring out what to show visually during the scene.

The scene makes use of a repeated background, an animation technique made famous by Hanna-Barbera in order to cut budget.|$|E

25|$|Chess on <b>a</b> <b>Really</b> <b>Big</b> Board {{is a large}} chess variant {{invented by}} Ralph Betza around 1996. It is played on a 16×16 {{chessboard}} with 16 pieces (on the back rank) and 16 pawns (on the second rank) per player. Since such a board can be constructed by pushing together four standard 8×8 boards, Betza also gave this variant the alternative names of Four Board Chess or Chess on Four Boards.|$|E
500|$|In 2010, Gragg was {{converted}} into a tight end, which made three slots at the position on the Razorbacks' depth chart.

40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, {{researchers}} and network operators have examined networks of DDoS agents, more recently called botnets due to their connection to Internet Relay Chat (IRC). In the continued quest to take down these networks of bots, two important questions arise: how many bots are there, and how to find every last bot?

[...] Dante Harper was hired to rewrite the script, aimed for [...] "having a gory-but-funny Shaun of the Dead vibe." [...] McKay said inspirations included Sam Raimi's early horror comedy films like Army of Darkness but also [...] "John Carpenter's movies, which we all love [...] we're all hugely influenced by the first Matrix—obviously <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>big</b> one—also the Bourne Supremacy movies and the way Oliver Wood shot those. You kind of throw in all those, mix 'em up in a pot and that's what you get."

It's a difficult song. You need <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>big</b> voice to be able to perform that song. I was like, 'Whoa!' She obviously has an amazing voice, and I think it was a really interesting exercise for her and for me." [...] Guetta further explained that when he collaborates with artists, he likes to [...] "take them out of their boxes", and creating a dance record with Hudson was [...] "really exciting" [...] for him. On working with Hudson, he said, [...] "She is beautiful in every way: as a person, as a singer, as a human being. She delivered [...] like crazy." [...] "Night of Your Life" [...] was released for digital download on August 22, 2011, as the third and final promotional single from the album, as part of the iTunes Store's countdown to the album's release.|$|E

This is the first episode of the series that Jon Hamm had directed, with Hamm saying that he owes thanks to John Slattery for paving the way. As preparation for directing the Rolling Stones concert, Hamm looked over archival photographs of the original concert. [...] "They were kids. The Rolling Stones. It was them and The Beatles. These huge pop explosions. People were really excited about {{it and it was}} <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>big</b> deal. And, in a larger sense, gave us a sense of where advertising is going." [...] Reflecting on his directing job, Hamm noted that he tried not to put much distracting style into the show, explaining that [...] "My job was not {{to go in there and}} muck it up and say, [...] "I'm gonna put my stamp on this." [...] My job was to go in there and keep the train on the tracks, basically. We have a very firmly established tone and look to our show that people respond to, and that I love."

500|$|The {{first half}} of Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt was {{recorded}} shortly {{after the completion of}} Blood Sugar Sex Magik; the second half between late 1991 and early 1992, during the album's tour. [...] "Running Away Into You" [...] is the only track recorded after he left the Chili Peppers. The album is a heavily experimental avant-garde composition whose initial purpose was spiritual and emotional expression: [...] "I wrote [...] because I was in <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>big</b> place in my head—it was a huge, spiritual place telling me what to do. As long as I'm obeying those forces, it's always going to be meaningful. I could be playing guitar and I could say 'Play something that sucks,' and if I'm in that place, it's gonna be great. And {{it has nothing to do}} with me, except in ways that can't be understood." [...] Frusciante further asserted that the album was meant to be experienced as a cohesive unit rather than separate entities or songs. Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt was released on Rick Rubin's label American Recordings. Warner Bros., the Chili Peppers' label, owned rights to the album because of the leaving-artist clause in Frusciante's Chili Peppers contract. However, because he was reclusive, the label gladly handed the rights over to Rubin, who released the album at the urging of Frusciante's friends.|$|E
500|$|Đurić {{was drafted}} into the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) {{at the age of}} 17, and became an officer during his service. With the {{impending}} Bosnian War, his father wanted either him or his brother to leave the country in order to preserve the family line. He was instructed to leave his hometown as he was younger and a sportsman. Đurić recalls: [...] "My father fought in this war, my brother for almost five years and my mother was killed in 1993 by the Muslim army. They bombed our village and it hit my home directly. <b>A</b> <b>really</b> <b>big</b> bomb and my mother died instantly [...] So many people like me lost mothers and fathers in this bloody civil war but for me I hold no grudges. I don’t look at race, I look at people by their hearts and here in Singapore I adopted a Muslim child." [...] With just 300 Deutsche Marks on him, Đurić left for Serbia where he played football in the second division for one season and then Sweden, where he trained with AIK and was offered refugee status which he rejected. The breakup of Yugoslavia left him stranded in Hungary without a recognised passport. He wandered through the cafes and restaurants of Szeged before a family offered him accommodation and a trial at local club Szeged LC in the second tier of the Hungarian football league.|$|E

[...] Both re-workings were part of the song's remix EP that also featured remixes from Fred Falke, Thomas Newson and Viceroy. A re-cut by producer Martignetti that was not on the EP premiered on the blog Stoney Roads, who noted the song to be fitting in an episode of the HBO series Girls. [...] "Ghost" [...] was also included on the soundtrack for the game WWE 2K15, and Dubuc has admitted to being happy of being involved with the game: [...] "I've been <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>big</b> fan for a long time, and they found out I was a fan, {{and it turns out that}} some of the people that work at WWE and in the game specifically are fans of Mystery Skulls and they were like, [...] "What the fuck?

500|$|The episode {{features}} the last appearance of actor Harold Perrineau, whose character Michael dies in an explosion, {{as a main}} cast member. The character of Michael was absent for the entire third season of Lost and returned midway through the fourth season in [...] "Ji Yeon." [...] Perrineau was disappointed that he was {{brought back to the}} show only to be killed and that Michael does not get a chance to reunite with his son, Walt, saying, [...] "there are all these questions about how [...] respond to black people on the show ... Walt just winds up being another fatherless child. It plays into <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>big,</b> weird stereotype and, being a black person myself, that wasn't so interesting." [...] The fate of Jin, who is also on the freighter when it explodes, is left uncertain. Actor Daniel Dae Kim was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol, which prompted speculation about his future on the series, due to co-stars Michelle Rodriguez (Ana-Lucia Cortez) and Cynthia Watros (Libby) leaving Lost after DUI arrests. This episode also marks Malcolm David Kelley's first appearance on the show since the third season, excepting a computer effects shot of the actor in [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson". Kelley's character, Walt, was [...] "benched" [...] {{for the majority of the}} second and third seasons because the actor's growth was disproportionate to the amount of time that has passed on the island. The writers got the idea to show him in flashforwards in his older form while writing [...] "Through the Looking Glass".|$|E
500|$|In June 2010, when Jill's adoptive mother, Liz Foster (Julianna McCarthy), died, it {{was then}} learned that her {{biological}} father was Neil Fenmore. Walton stated: [...] "Liz was the dream mother for Jill. She always could handle Jill." [...] During an interview with On-Air On-Soaps speaking about how her character has been thrown in different directions, Walton said: [...] "It used to bother me. I would try and keep a steady course with it, and now I can’t. Now I just roll with the punches. It’s impossible." [...] Walton noted that Jill was finally {{happy to have a}} blood relative through Neil's other daughter, Lauren Fenmore (Tracey E. Bregman). She said: [...] "Liz dies within a week {{and all of a sudden}} it’s, 'I am a Fenmore'. And we really didn’t have a chance to explore it much, but in real life that happens. My first thought as Jill is, 'I actually know who my blood is, and I have a sister.' And, Jill was very moved and touched and shocked from the death of Liz, but full of love for her sister." [...] On her relationship with Lauren, Walton stated that, [...] "Most people don’t like Jill, and she hasn’t particularly loved Lauren. I have never had that much to do with Lauren, really." [...] Nekeeta Borden of Zap2it noted: [...] "The redhead told Jill in no uncertain terms that she intended to keep her father’s memory, and only child status, firmly in tact [...] and had no interest in a close relationship." [...] Borden also noted that Jill always wanted a sense of belonging, which prompted her to legally change her name to Jill Fenmore. The sisters were initially bitter towards each other having to share half of the Fenmore Boutique, but have since gotten closer. Walton said that, [...] "From my point of view, I think that Lauren has <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>big</b> heart; she's a naturally lovely person. Lauren was really awful a few times, and that just came out of her pain. So, it looks like Lauren and Jill are kind of getting along okay, but there's nothing else coming up in the scripts for them yet." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{leaving the}} Island {{in the second}} season finale [...] "Live Together, Die Alone", Michael was {{supposed}} to return in the season three finale, but Perrineau was filming the pilot of Demons, so was unable to return. Instead he returned in the seventh episode of season four, [...] "Ji Yeon". His return {{was meant to be}} announced during Losts slot at the 2007 Comic-Con International, however there were complaints at the Television Critics Association Press Tour when ABC's President of Entertainment Stephen McPherson commented that [...] "some big announcements" [...] would be made at the Lost panel. Some journalists felt that any announcements should be made to them at the press meeting, rather than at a fan convention. After numerous reporters asked about what would be announced, Lost producer Damon Lindelof was contacted, and he gave permission for McPherson to say Harold Perrineau would be returning to Lost. At Comic-Con, Lindelof confirmed Perrineau would be back as a cast member, not just for a flashback. Lost producer Carlton Cuse said [...] "Michael's story is for us one of the most becoming storylines on the show because here's a character who ... undertook some very extreme actions in order to basically get his son off the Island, and then when he sailed off in that boat I think everyone was very curious about what happened to him, what is his fate ... we really feel that Michael's story will be a really compelling part of the season." [...] Perrineau was disappointed that he was brought back to the show only to be killed, and that Michael does not get a chance to reunite with his son, Walt, saying, [...] "there are all these questions about how [...] respond to black people on the show ... Walt just winds up being another fatherless child. It plays into <b>a</b> <b>really</b> <b>big,</b> weird stereotype and, being a black person myself, that wasn't so interesting." [...] Cuse responded [...] "We pride ourselves on having a very racially diverse cast. It's painful when any actor's storyline ends on the show. Harold is a fantastic actor whose presence added enormously to Lost". Perrineau later said he should have thought before making a racial comment, and although he felt like that, he never discussed the matter with the producers. Perrineau said that although he would be happy to return to Lost, he would have to know what the storyline would be.|$|E
