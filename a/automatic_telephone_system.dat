[...] Bennett was renowned as one of the province's finest orators, and his five-hour speech earned plaudits even from the Liberal Edmonton Bulletin, which praised its [...] "splendor in diction [...] the physical endurance of the orator" [...] and called it a [...] "high water mark for parliamentary debate in Alberta". [...] Bennett lashed out at {{the government}}'s handling of the A file, accusing it of culpable negligence in failing to properly oversee the company's activities. [...] He claimed to have been approached directly by [...] "great financial interests" [...] intent on preventing his participation in the debate. [...] He argued that the discrepancy in the sale price of the bonds and what the government had received for them meant that Clarke and his associates had realized a profit of between $200,000 and $300,000 at the government's expense. [...] He closed with an accusation that Cross had sent an emissary to a telephone company that wanted to install an <b>automatic</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>system</b> in Calgary agreeing to reverse his opposition to the deal in exchange for a $12,000 contribution to Cross's campaign fund. [...] These charges, corroborated by Cushing but hotly denied by Cross, were not related to the A affair, but were designed to damage the credibility of the government's de facto house leader {{on the eve of the}} vote on the Woolf-McDougall amendment.

He installed Saskatoon’s first <b>automatic</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>system</b> in 1907, one of the first on the continent. He started Saskatoon’s first modern steam laundry, and oversaw the “largest and finest furniture store West of Winnipeg”. Drinkle has been credited with bringing the first car to Saskatoon, which he used to show real estate to prospective clients. He built the “first substantial business block fit for a large metropolis”, complete with the first elevator, and built for himself a modern house described as “one of the most beautiful homes in the entire province”. [...] His company {{was one of the first}} to buy vast tracts of land on speculation for resale to farmers, and this was the early base of his fortune.|$|E

40|$|The {{telephone}} system was not sufficiently developed in prewar Japan. This study examines the technological development of automatic telephone switchboard (ATS) {{to clarify the}} problems of {{telephone system}} in prewar Japan. Ministry of Communication(MOC) introduced <b>automatic</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>system</b> in 1923. From {{the standpoint of the}} telephone exchange service, it was a very opportune decision; however, it was technologically premature. Although they had conducted research on the system before WW 1, their only choice was the primitive S ~ S system. Further, the dependence on import technology caused different A-type and H-type ATS to coexist. Each local telephone exchange district independently introduced a different type. The MOC had to prepare the specifications and parts for repair for two different systems. These factors hampered the improvement of the telecommunication quality. Standardizing the system by using independent technology became the biggest issue for the MOC in the 1930 s. In the 1930 s, some joint researches were organized with private enterprises. They tried to develop a gT-typeh or gElectronic Tube-typeh ATS. However, the T-type ATS was merely an improvement over the outdated S ~ S system with respect to the circuit design. On the other hand, Matsumae aimed at a novel technology, an electronic common control system. However, a suitable electronic tube was not invented. As a result, the telecommunication industry was unable to resolve the coexistence problem in the prewar period. However, the engineers of MOC and ATS suppliers recognized their technological backwardness and shared an awareness of the importance of standardization by independent technology. This was the starting point for the research and development system of the telecommunication industry in gPostwar Japan. hTelephone system, Automatic Telephone Switchboard, Ministry of Communication, Research & Development, Joint Research...|$|E

5000|$|The Great Kantō {{earthquake}} struck Japan in 1923. 140,000 {{people were}} killed and 3.4 million were left homeless. [...] Four of NEC's factories were destroyed, killing 105 of NEC's engineers and workers. Thirteen of Tokyo's telephone offices were destroyed by fire. Telephone and telegraph service was interrupted by damage to telephone cables. In response, the Ministry of Communications accelerated major programs to install <b>automatic</b> <b>telephone</b> switching <b>systems</b> and enter radio broadcasting. [...] The first automatic switching systems were the Strowger-type model made by <b>Automatic</b> <b>Telephone</b> Manufacturing Co. (ATM) in the United Kingdom. NEC participated in the installation of the automatic switching systems, ultimately becoming the general sales agent for ATM. NEC developed its own Strowger-type automatic switching system in 1924, a first in Japan. One of the plants almost leveled during the Kanto earthquake, the Mita Plant, was chosen to support expanding production. A new three-story steel-reinforced concrete building was built, starting in 1925. It was modeled after the Western Electric Hawthorne Works.|$|R

This paper addresses {{the problem of how to}} produce artificial agents that are less socially inept. A distinction is drawn between things which are operationally available to us as human conversationalists and the things that are available to a third party (e. g. a scientists or engineer) in terms of an explicit explanation or representation. The former implies a detailed skill at recognising and negotiating the subtle and context-dependent rules of human social interaction, but this skill is largely unconscious – we do not know how we do it, in the sense of the later kind of understanding.
