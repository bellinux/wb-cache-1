5|$|Emily Margaret Tinne (née McCulloch; 21 August 1886 – 1966) was a British {{collector}} of clothes. Raised by a Presbyterian missionary to India, Tinne attended {{boarding school in}} England. She trained {{and worked as a}} teacher before marrying a wealthy doctor in 1910, at which point she started buying clothes from department stores in Bold Street, Liverpool, as well as having bespoke items made by a local dress maker. Her collection, which has been donated to the National Museums Liverpool, contains over 700 items and is the largest from an individual owned by a museum in the United Kingdom. The clothes are of high quality, with many items still unworn in their original tissue paper and boxes, the price tags <b>and</b> <b>delivery</b> information still attached.|$|E
5|$|Federal {{and state}} laws {{regulating}} hours, wages, {{and working conditions}} changed markedly in the United States during the early 20thcentury. The state's Industrial Welfare Commission, established in 1913, ruled in 1914 that women could not work in laundries for more than 54 hours a week, and that work days were not to exceed nine hours. The commission established a minimum weekly wage of $8.25 for women working in Portland's laundries. By 1917, the work day was reduced to an eight-hour maximum. In 1920, to lower costs related to regulations {{and the rise of}} organized labor, several industrial laundries in Portland combined to form the Home Services Company. The new company lowered overhead by sharing resources, and added a pickup <b>and</b> <b>delivery</b> service popular among middle-class families. The company acquired the Yale Union Laundry in 1927.|$|E

5|$|Following initial {{interest}} in brachytherapy in Europe and the US, its use {{declined in the}} middle of the twentieth century due to the problem of radiation exposure to operators from the manual application of the radioactive sources. However, the development of remote afterloading systems, which allow the radiation to be delivered from a shielded safe, and the use of new radioactive sources in the 1950s and 1960s, reduced the risk of unnecessary radiation exposure to the operator and patients. This, together with more recent advancements in three-dimensional imaging modalities, computerised treatment planning systems <b>and</b> <b>delivery</b> equipment has made brachytherapy a safe and effective treatment for many types of cancer today.|$|E
