These genetic modifications usually aim {{to reduce the amount of}} energy used to produce the product, increase yields <b>and</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> production of wastes.|$|E
5|$|Agricultural {{improvement}} and the Industrial Revolution came to Aberdaron in the 19th century. The Inclosure (Consolidation) Act 1801 {{was intended to}} make it easier for landlords to enclose and improve common land, introduce increased efficiency, bring more land under the plough, <b>and</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> high prices of agricultural production. Rhoshirwaun Common, following strong opposition, was enclosed in 1814; while the process was not completed in Aberdaron, Llanfaelrhys and Y Rhiw until 1861. On the industrial front, mining developed as a major source of employment, especially at Y Rhiw, where manganese was discovered in 1827.|$|E

5|$|As well as {{producing}} electricity, the dam {{is intended}} to increase the Yangtze River's shipping capacity <b>and</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> potential for floods downstream by providing flood storage space. China regards the project as monumental {{as well as a}} success socially and economically, with the design of state-of-the-art large turbines, and a move toward limiting greenhouse gas emissions. However, the dam flooded archaeological and cultural sites and displaced some 1.3million people, and is causing significant ecological changes, including an increased risk of landslides. The dam has been controversial both domestically and abroad.|$|E
5|$|Ash-laden sewage {{entering}} a treatment plant {{is likely to}} cause failure of mechanical prescreening equipment such as step screens or rotating screens.

5|$|Compartment {{syndrome}} is treated with surgery {{to relieve the}} pressure inside the muscle compartment <b>and</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> risk of compression on blood vessels and nerves in that area. Fasciotomy is the incision of the affected compartment. Often, multiple incisions are made and left open until the swelling has reduced. At that point, the incisions are closed, often requiring debridement (removal of non-viable tissue) and skin grafting in the process. The need for fasciotomy may be decreased if mannitol is used, as it can relieve muscle swelling directly.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{diversity}} of crops {{can be used}} to help protect the environment. Crop varieties that are resistant to pests and diseases can reduce the need for application of harmfulpesticides.While crops that are more vigorous can better compete withweeds whichreduces the need for applyingherbicides. This is shown in a case study completed atAarhus Universityin Denmark which used more robust maize.Drought resistant plants can help save water <b>and</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> need forirrigation whiledeeper rooting varieties can help stabilize soils; and varieties that are more efficient in their use of nutrients require lessfertilizer.|$|E

5|$|Many {{bird species}} migrate to take {{advantage}} of global differences of seasonal temperatures, therefore optimising availability of food sources and breeding habitat. These migrations vary among the different groups. Many landbirds, shorebirds, and waterbirds undertake annual long distance migrations, usually triggered by the length of daylight as well as weather conditions. These birds are characterised by a breeding season spent in the temperate or polar regions and a non-breeding season in the tropical regions or opposite hemisphere. Before migration, birds substantially increase body fats and reserves <b>and</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> size of some of their organs.|$|E
5|$|Muhammad Yunus was {{inspired}} during the Bangladesh famine of 1974 {{to make a}} small loan of US$27 to a group of 42 families as start-up money so that they could make items for sale, without the burdens of high interest under predatory lending.
