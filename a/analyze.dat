5|$|In 1965, Richard Bellman {{proposed}} {{the creation of}} a database to solve chess and checkers endgames using retrograde analysis. Instead of analyzing forward from the position currently on the board, the database would <b>analyze</b> backward from positions where one player was checkmated or stalemated. Thus, a chess computer would no longer need to <b>analyze</b> endgame positions during the game because they were solved beforehand. It would no longer make mistakes because the tablebase always played the best possible move.|$|E

5|$|Later, Allison {{acquired}} a 2 MeV Van de Graaff generator, and he recalled an old paper on producing lithium ions from minerals like Eucryptite. This {{allowed him to}} produce a 1.2 MeV lithium ion beam. He created hitherto unknown isotopes of boron and other light elements, and measured their neutron capture cross sections. A side effect of this work was a method to <b>analyze</b> surface materials where chemical analysis was unavailable. His colleague Anthony L. Turkevich subsequently used this to <b>analyze</b> {{the makeup of the}} Moon on the later Surveyor program missions. Allison continued to take on Ph.D. candidates, some of whom, such as James Cronin went on to distinguished careers.|$|E

40|$|This study {{deals with}} a {{literary}} analysis. The writer <b>analyzes</b> the theme of The Moon and Sixpence written by William Somerset Maugham. She <b>analyzes</b> it through three elements of novel namely character, plot and setting. In <b>analyzing</b> the main character of the novel, she uses psychological approach based on Maslow theory, stratified needs. In <b>analyzing</b> the main character, the writer divides into two parts. First is about Strickland's personality when he {{is known as a}} family man, an amateur painter in Paris and a painter in Tahiti. Second is about Strickland's life in the need for self-actualization states. She also introduces some other characters that have relationships with the main character. In finding theme through plot, the writer starts the <b>analyzing</b> by introducing all of the characters in the novel, then she <b>analyzes</b> the conflict happened between the main character and some others. After that she <b>analyzes</b> the suspense, climax and resolution related to the conflict After <b>analyzing</b> plot, the writer <b>analyzes</b> the setting. She <b>analyzes</b> places and activities in which some important action take place. At last, she <b>analyzes</b> the theme of The Moon and Sixpence. As the result of the analysis, the writer concludes that the main character, Strickland, is a man in the self-actualization need that causes him to feel the need to do something well for the sake of doing it well. Through the <b>analyzes</b> of the main character, plot and setting, she finds that the theme of the novel is the desire of a man to fulfill his dream or destiny can conquer anything...|$|R
