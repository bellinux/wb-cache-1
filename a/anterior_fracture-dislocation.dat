40|$|Fractures {{can occur}} during violent muscular {{violence}} such as {{occur in the}} course of epileptic seizures, though this is rare (0. 3 %). The proximal part of the humerus is most frequently affected. The typical lesion is bilateral posterior dislocation or fracture-dislocation. We present a rare case of bilateral <b>anterior</b> <b>fracture-dislocation</b> of the shoulder sustained as the result of an epileptic fit. The treatment given was open reduction, refixation of the anterior labrum and screw fixation of the fragments.

40|$|Background: The marked loss of glenoid bone volume or {{alteration}} of glenoid version can affect glenoid compo-nent fixation in patients undergoing total shoulder arthroplasty. The {{purpose of this}} study was to evaluate the long-term results associated with the use of bone-grafting for restoration of glenoid volume and version at the time of total shoulder arthroplasty. Methods: Twenty-one shoulders received an internally fixed, corticocancellous bone graft for the restoration of pe-ripheral glenoid bone stock at the time of total shoulder arthroplasty between 1980 and 1989. Grafting was indi-cated when glenoid bone stock was insufficient to maintain adequate version or fixation of the prosthesis. Seventeen shoulders were available for follow-up; the average duration of follow-up for the thirteen shoulders that did not have prosthetic failure within the first two years was seventy months. Total shoulder arthroplasty was per-formed because of osteoarthritis in five shoulders, chronic <b>anterior</b> <b>fracture-dislocation</b> in five, capsulorrhaphy ar-thropathy in three, inflammatory arthritis in two, recurrent dislocation in one, and failure of a previous arthroplasty in one. All patients had some form of anterior or posterior instability preoperatively. There were five anterior and twelve posterior glenoid defects. Bone from the resected humeral head was used for grafting in fifteen shoulders, and bicortical iliac-crest bone was used in two. Results: The average glenoid version after grafting was 4 ° of retroversion, with an average correction of 33 °. Th...|$|E
40|$|Bilateral {{dislocation}} of {{the shoulder}} is rare, and almost always occurs posteriorly. Such dislocations {{have been associated with}} epileptic seizures, 1 ' 3 electrocution, sporting injuries, 4 trauma and connective tissues diseases. However, there are even fewer documented bilateral anterior dislocations {{of the shoulder}}s in the literature. We report an unusual case of bilateral anterior dislocation of the shoulders sustained following a trivial fall. CASE REPORT A 70 -year old left-handed woman with no previous dislocation or other past medical history of upper limb injury was admitted to our Accident & Emergency department. She was making her bed and tripped over the wire connected to her electric blanket, fell forward and landed on her right shoulder. She did not recall any injuries to her left upper limb. Subsequently, she was helped to get up by her spouse but noticed she was unable to abduct either arm and that both shoulders were painful to move. On examination, the patient's right shoulder was very bruised. Both shoulders appeared symmetrical but there was loss of lateral contour. Fig lb. | Ene-wsXise>>;e Si~~~~~~~~~~~. - [...] R [...] . ss [...] ., [...] .,W S: [...] . Anterior fracture dislocation of the right shoulder with displaced greater tuberosity. There was no distal neurovacsular deficit and both axillary nerves were intact. No glenohumeral movement was possible in either shoulder and she found it painful to attempt this movement. Radiography showed anterior dislocation of the left shoulder and <b>anterior</b> <b>fracture-dislocation</b> of the right shoulder with displaced greater tuberosity (Figures la and lb). Both shoulders were reduced using a closed method under Entonox. Bilateral broad arm slings were then applied The patient was admitted to the ward for rehabilitation. She was discharged home one week later and went on to recover satisfactorily...|$|E
40|$|We {{retrospectively}} reviewed 20 {{patients at}} three to 19 years after displaced <b>anterior</b> <b>fracture-dislocations</b> of the hip. Eighteen {{of them were}} treated by fraction, after ensuring that the femoral head was adequately reduced beneath the undisrupted part of the weight-bearing dome. Two required operation. Although none of the 18 conservatively treated fractures was reduced anatomically, the results were good in ten patients and excellent in the seven in whom the fracture did not involve the weight-bearing dome. We conclude that anterior column fractures have a favourable prognosis after conservative treatment. The treatment of displaced acetabular fractures has been under discussion for many years. Letournel and Judet (1981) advocated open reduction and rigid, internal fixation for every case to allow early movement, and others supported this view, especially for fractures through the weight-bearing dome (WBD) and those involving the posterior column (Matta et al 1986; Goulet and Bray 1989; Heeg, Klasen and Visser 1990). <b>Anterior</b> <b>fracture-dislocations</b> {{with the exception of}} pure anterio...|$|R

40|$|Anterior {{shoulder}} dislocations are {{the most}} common major joint dislocations encountered in the emergency departments and fractures of proximal humerus can accompany with dislocations. Although the treatment of acute isolated traumatic anterior shoulder dislocation is generally simple, the treatment of neglected fracture-dislocations becomes more complicated. In this report, a 22 -year-old male patient who had posttraumatic locked, shoulder fracture-dislocation is presented. Open reduction and internal fixation was performed because the injury had occurred 3 weeks ago and the humeral head was locked on the anterior rim of glenoid. At sixth month post-operative follow-up, it was seen that the fracture had united and there was no radiological evidence of avascular necrosis. Neglected, locked <b>anterior</b> <b>fracture-dislocations</b> should be managed thoughtfully by open reduc-tion and internal fixation with consideration of the risk for avascular necrosis...|$|R
30|$|Nonunion after {{operative}} {{treatment of a}} displaced fracture of the olecranon is very uncommon and usually related to patient noncompliance and/or insufficient surgical technique with implant failure. Nonunions of the proximal ulna are associated with complex injury patterns such as <b>anterior</b> or posterior <b>fracture-dislocations</b> of the olecranon and posterior Monteggia fractures. In particular, posterior Monteggia injuries in adults typically occur in older women with poor bone quality. They {{can be difficult to}} secure resulting in inadequate plate fixation and subsequent nonununion.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{report the}} {{long-term}} results of operative treatment of anterior and posterior olecranon fracture-dislocations and {{compare them with}} the results recorded fewer than 2 years after surgery. Design: Retrospective case series with long-term evaluation. Setting: Level I trauma center. Patients and Participants: Ten patients with <b>anterior</b> olecranon <b>fracture-dislocation</b> and ten patients with posterior olecranon fracture-dislocation were evaluated after an average of 18 years (range, 11 to 28 years) after injury. Fifteen patients had an early follow-up available at an average 14 months (range, 6 to 24 months) after surgery. The average age at injury was 30 years (range, 14 to 53 years). Intervention: Treatment included plate and screw fixation (11 patients), tension band wiring (8 patients), and radiocapitellar transfixation (1 patient). Six patients had additional elbow surgery before the final evaluation. Main Outcome Measurements: Flexion arc, arthrosis, Mayo Elbow Performance Index (MEPI), Disability of Arm Shoulder and Hand questionnaire (DASH). Results: The mean arc of elbow flexion was 105 degrees (range, 15 to 140 degrees) at 1 year and 122 degrees (range 10 to 145 degrees; P = 0. 01) at final evaluation. Radiographic arthrosis was observed in 14 patients (70 %) : severe in 3, moderate in 2, and mild in 9 patients. Five patients (25 %) had ulnar nerve dysfunction at the final evaluation. The MEPI was excellent in 13 patients, good in 4, fair in 2, and poor in 1. The mean DASH score was 9 points (range, 0 to 53 points). Conclusion: The initial results of operative treatment of fracture-dislocations of the olecranon are durable over tim...|$|R
