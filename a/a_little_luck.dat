500|$|The {{scene in}} which O'Malley's colleagues were {{laughing}} at his funeral was one of Vernoff's favorite scenes. She added: [...] "Shonda gave me smart notes that enhanced the writing and then the wonderful director Ed Ornelas and the amazing DP Herb Davis and the whole crew that support them made it visually beautiful and then the actors… damn, did they all bring their A game to this scene. And {{then there are the}} editors and music folks and the people who color correct everything and mix the sound… It's a collaboration. What it takes to make good TV is a huge coming together of a great many artists. What it takes to make great TV is all that plus a little magic and <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>luck.</b> And that’s what I feel like we had with this scene. It's so funny and so bittersweet and so, so sad." ...|$|E
500|$|Television {{columnist}} Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger {{said that}} 30 Rock [...] "feels like a show that's already made The Leap midway through season one." [...] He reported that Tracy's story was [...] "largely a dud", {{but said that}} the two other plots were [...] "so funny" [...] {{that it would not}} matter much. Sepinwall said [...] "The Head and the Hair" [...] was [...] "splendid". Julia Ward of AOL's TV Squad was complimentary towards Alec Baldwin's Jack in this episode, citing that he knows [...] "how to squeeze some serious funny out of a simple gesture and a pause." [...] She added that his [...] "lingering stare" [...] at both Jenna and Liz after taking their drink order [...] "was the funniest moment in a very funny episode". Ward also enjoyed that it [...] "brought us maximum Kenneth, which is great. He's turning {{out to be one of}} the show's most endearing characters." [...] IGN contributor Robert Canning wrote that the pairing of Jack and Kenneth was a [...] "great idea and gave Kenneth his best episode" [...] since [...] "Blind Date". In regards to Liz's story, he commented it was [...] "her strongest episodes to date", and said that it [...] "felt good" [...] to see her [...] "have <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>luck</b> for a change" [...] with [...] "The Head". In conclusion, Canning gave the episode an 8.0 out of 10 rating. TV Guides Matt Mitovich disliked that NBC [...] "utterly ruined" [...] the outcome of Liz's plot in the promos, though, said that it was a [...] "very funny resolution to the relationship that was too good, and too well coiffed, to be true." [...] Mitovich said that it was [...] "fun" [...] to see Liz successfully date [...] "while it lasted".|$|E

60|$|They {{came out}} upon the green plateau {{and headed for}} the stockade and the overseer's white house. Pitt's eyes looked out over Carlisle Bay, of which this plateau {{commanded}} a clear view from the fort on one side to the long sheds of the wharf on the other. Along this wharf a few shallow boats were moored, and Pitt caught himself wondering which of these was the wherry in which with <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>luck</b> they might have been now at sea. Out over that sea his glance ranged miserably.|$|E
60|$|At {{last the}} time came for the cavalry to cross the bridge, and as we filed on to the {{floating}} roadway we were amused to see a large fingerpost at the entrance, on which the engineers had neatly painted, 'To Ladysmith.' The brigade passed over the neck between Railway and Inniskilling Hills, and we massed in a suitable place on the descending slopes beyond. We looked at the country before us, {{and saw that it}} was good. Here at last was ground cavalry could work on at some speed. Ladysmith was still hidden by the remaining ridges, but we thought that somehow, and with <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>luck,</b> we might have a look at it before night.|$|E
60|$|Both these Forsytes, wide asunder as {{the poles}} in many respects, possessed in their {{different}} ways--to {{a greater degree}} {{than the rest of}} the family--that essential quality of tenacious and prudent insight into 'affairs,' which is the highwater mark of their great class. Either of them, with <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>luck</b> and opportunity, was equal to a lofty career; either of them would have made a good financier, a great contractor, a statesman, though old Jolyon, in certain of his moods when under the influence of a cigar or of Nature--would have been capable of, not perhaps despising, but certainly of questioning, his own high position, while Soames, who never smoked cigars, would not.|$|E

50|$|Meanwhile, the Marines batters had <b>a</b> <b>little</b> better <b>luck</b> {{with the}} Chunichi bullpen, namely Masafumi Hirai. Nishioka hit an RBI single to score Okada, who had reached and was sacrificed to second for the Marines' {{run in the}} 6th.

6000|$|... 'I {{certainly}} shan't {{object to}} that,' said Elizabeth. She was feeling that morning that <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>luck</b> {{would be a}} pleasing novelty. Things had not been going very well with her of late. It {{was not so much}} that the usual proportion of her manuscripts had come back with editorial compliments from the magazine to which they had been sent--she accepted that as part of the game; what she did consider scurvy treatment at the hands of fate was the fact that her own pet magazine, the one to which she had been accustomed to fly for refuge, almost sure of a welcome--when coldly treated by all the others--had suddenly expired with a low gurgle for want of public support. It was like losing a kind and open-handed relative, and it made the addition of a black cat to the household almost a necessity.|$|E
60|$|The end of May showed {{considerable}} Boer {{activity in}} the Cape Colony, that date corresponding {{with the return of}} Kritzinger from the north. Haig had for the moment driven Scheepers back from the extreme southerly point which he had reached, and he was now in the Graaf-Reinet district; but {{on the other side of}} the colony Conroy had appeared near Kenhart, and upon May 23rd he fought a sharp skirmish with a party of Border Scouts. The main Boer force under Kritzinger was in the midlands, however, and had concentrated to such an extent in the Cradock district that it was clear that some larger enterprise was on foot. This soon took shape, for on June 2nd, after a long and rapid march, the Boer leader threw himself upon Jamestown, overwhelmed the sixty townsmen who formed the guard, and looted the town, from which he drew some welcome supplies and 100 horses. British columns were full cry upon his heels, however, and the Boers after a few hours left the gutted town and vanished into the hills once more. On June 6th the British had <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>luck</b> at last, for on that date Scobell and Lukin in the Barkly East district surprised a laager and took twenty prisoners, 166 horses, and much of the Jamestown loot. On the same day Windham treated Van Reenen in a similar rough fashion near Steynsburg, and took twenty-two prisoners.|$|E

5000|$|About {{the man who}} deified a binbōgami. At {{the night}} of Jinjitsu (January 7 in the former Japanese calendar), a binbōgami {{appeared}} at the man's bedside and thanked him, [...] "I had a prepared dinner on a tray for the first time," [...] and made the man a millionaire in return. And it is also said that a poor hatamoto (middle-class bushi), who thought binbōgami had brought him security as well as poverty, put sake and rice out to pray to binbōgami for <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit of <b>luck.</b> And then, he received <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit of <b>luck.</b> This binbōgami is now enshrined beside Kitano Shrine, in Bunkyō ward, Tokyo. If you pray at the small shrine to welcome binbōgami temporarily, and send him away 21 days later, it is said, you can avoid binbōgami thereafter.|$|R

2500|$|Woodward and {{executive}} director Alison Harris led a $30.6 million renovation, transforming the old barn into a modern, year-round theatre facility. The renovated theatre reopened in 2005. At Woodward's suggestion, {{a piece of the}} original stage floor was placed at the dressing room entrance to give <b>a</b> <b>little</b> extra <b>luck</b> to the actors. Woodward stepped down from her job in January 2006, and was followed by actor, opera and theatre director, and playwright Tazewell Thompson. However, Woodward and Newman have both continued to contribute to the Westport Country Playhouse's [...] "Campaign for a New Era." ...|$|R
