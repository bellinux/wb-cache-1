After {{the success of}} Magic, Wizards published RoboRally in 1994, and it soon won the 1994 Origins Awards for Best Fantasy or Science Fiction Board Game and Best Graphic Presentation of a Board Game. Wizards also expanded its role-playing game line by buying SLA Industries from Nightfall Games and Ars Magica from White Wolf, Inc. in 1994. In 1995, Wizards published another card game by Richard Garfield, The Great Dalmuti, which won the 1995 Best New Mind Game award from Mensa. In August 1995, Wizards released Everway and then four months later closed its roleplaying game product line.

For example, Levinson specifically asked that {{a dead body}} found by detectives in [...] "Gone for Goode" [...] be badly decomposing and attracting flies because he felt other shows did not portray corpses in a realistic way. Some episodes, like [...] "Ghost of a Chance", focus on murders {{that take place in}} wealthy rural settings, rather than an urban or predominantly poorer location as most police dramas did. Homicide was noted for demonstrating better than most American television police shows that murders can take place in various socioeconomic circumstances. In striving for realism, some cases in Homicide remain unsolved and murderers go free, most notably in the Adena Watson case. This theme often put the show's producers at odds with NBC executives, who wanted happier endings with more closure. Fontana said of the Watson investigation, [...] "We never solved it because we felt that it would be <b>a</b> <b>disservice</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> real girl, to have this fake TV solution. Because it's not O.K. that she died, that no one took responsibility." ...|$|E

40|$|OF INTERNAL MEDICINE has {{performed}} <b>a</b> minor <b>disservice</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> medical profession and <b>a</b> major <b>disservice</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public. When {{this paper was}} presented at the New York Academy of Medicine, the majority of the audience was vociferous in their criticism of the paper, both on the grounds of scientific soundness and conclusions reached. Since physicians are cap-able of sophisticated judgments of medical presentations, the effect was minor. However, we all know that the lay public is not capable of such judgments. The paper received nation-wide publicity in the lay press, appearing in New York in the Times and the Tribune. The impression gained by the reader of the lay press is that periodic examinations are a waste of time. Now, there are many dedicated or-ganizations, from the American Cancer Society to ourselves, who have devoted enormous time and energy <b>to</b> educating <b>the</b> public that the best chance of cure or arrest of many illnesses —whether it be carcinoma or glaucoma—lies in early detection. There is an overwhelming mass of medical evidence to confirm this simple fact. To cast serious doubts on the value of the periodic examination through the media of nationwide publicity therefore renders <b>a</b> major <b>disservice</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public. I have personally been deluged with requests from the press—newspapers such as The New York Times, magazines such as Business Week and Newsweek, house organs and others—to elicit my opinion of the discouraging articles which appeared in The New York Times and New York Herald Tribune. I have done my best, {{and will continue to do}} all that I can, <b>to</b> offset <b>the</b> immense damage that has been done.

Elements of the interview in [...] "Three Men and Adena" [...] were incorporated from real-life police interrogations in that case. The Wallace case was never solved, and Fontana insisted that the Watson case in Homicide remain unsolved as well, despite pressure from NBC for a more satisfying conclusion. Fontana said, [...] "We never solved it because we felt that it would be <b>a</b> <b>disservice</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> real girl, to have this fake TV solution. Because it's not O.K. that she died, that no one took responsibility." [...] The scene when Tucker admits for a moment he is not sure in his own mind that he didn't commit the murder was inspired by a similar real-life interaction Fontana found in a police interrogation transcript during his research. Fontana said, [...] "It was so chilling (and) I was like, 'Oh man, how do you get there?'" ...|$|E

It was the first Atlus title to receive this rating. To promote the game, Atlus USA created a sweepstakes that ran between May and September 2004: the winner received a laptop decorated with the main protagonist's tattoo design, along with a free copy of the game. Due to backlogs at Sony Disc Manufacturing, Atlus delayed the release of the game by over three weeks to October 12. In compensation, DoubleJump Books offered free priority shipping worldwide for their Nocturne guidebook. The publishing rights in Europe were picked up by Midas Interactive, who published the game through their then-newly formed subsidiary Ghostlight under the title Shin Megami Tensei: Lucifer's Call. It released on July 1, 2005. Nocturne was the first Megami Tensei title to be released in Europe.

2500|$|It can {{therefore}} be argued that it does <b>a</b> <b>disservice</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> English-speaking reader to translate the title as The Antichrist at all. As has been said the German title Der Antichrist is open to two interpretations ('Antichrist'/'Anti-Christian') but the English The Antichrist is not, and thus the question becomes: does that title reflect Nietzsche's use of the German word in the text? In fact, Nietzsche employs the word Antichrist at only one point, and there its sense is clearly 'Anti-Christian.' He uses its plural Antichristen once also, and again the meaning is 'anti-Christians.' In fact, at no point in the text does Nietzsche use any form of the German word Christ other than to mean 'Christian.' On this approach, a reader would be better readied for book's content were its title rendered [...] "The Anti-Christian", which more accurately identifies the author's chosen foe. After all, even to acknowledge {{the existence of an}} Antichrist, let alone to portray oneself as one, presupposes the existence of a Christ, of a Messiah. Nietzsche recognized no such entity.

And our forces lack the full support they need to effectively train and partner with Afghan Security Forces and better secure the population." [...] On 1 December 2009, Obama therefore announced at The United States Military Academy in West Point that the U.S. will be sending 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan and set July 2011 as the date to begin pulling U.S. forces out of the country. Promising that he could [...] "bring this war to a successful conclusion," [...] Obama set out a strategy that would seek to reverse Taliban gains in large parts of Afghanistan, better protect the Afghan people, increase the pressure on Afghanistan to build its own military capacity and a more effective government and step up attacks on Al Qaeda in Pakistan. The president said the three core elements to the new strategy are [...] "a military effort to create the conditions for a transition; a civilian surge that reinforces positive action; and an effective partnership with Pakistan." [...] The overarching goal was to [...] "disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and to prevent its capacity to threaten America and our allies in the future." [...] The West Point Speech concluded a three-month review of war strategy. [...] During the review, Obama asked for province-by-province assessments of the Taliban's strength, the effectiveness of provincial Afghan leaders and the overall security outlook to determine how quickly U.S. forces could leave certain regions. In {{the months leading up to}} his West Point speech, more precisely at a meeting with the Joint Chiefs of Staff on 30 Oct. 2009 to discuss his troops surge plan, Obama stated that the Afghanistan War is an American war, but he doesn’t want to it make an open-ended commitment. Obama also was livid that details of the 3 month Afghanistan War Review discussions were leaking out according to the New York Times. [...] "What I’m not going to tolerate is you talking to the press outside of this room," [...] he scolded his advisers. [...] "It’s <b>a</b> <b>disservice</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> process, to the country and to the men and women of the military." [...] In addition to the 30,000 additional U.S. troops that Obama announced to deploy to Afghanistan Obama sent an additional 22,000 forces (which were earlier announced in 2009 (compare section above)) along with 11,000 troops that were authorized by his predecessor to Afghanistan.|$|E
