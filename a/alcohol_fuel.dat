25|$|Direct {{methanol}} {{fuel cells}} {{do not require}} a reformer, but provide a lower energy density compared to conventional fuel cells, although this could be counterbalanced with the much better energy densities of ethanol and methanol over hydrogen. <b>Alcohol</b> <b>fuel</b> is a renewable resource.|$|E

2500|$|One {{advantage}} {{shared by}} the four major <b>alcohol</b> <b>fuels</b> is their high octane rating. This tends to increase their fuel efficiency and largely offsets the lower energy density of vehicular <b>alcohol</b> <b>fuels</b> (as compared to petrol/gasoline and diesel fuels), thus resulting in comparable [...] "fuel economy" [...] in terms of distance per volume metrics, such as kilometers per liter, or miles per gallon.|$|R
25|$|In Wisconsin, {{the legal}} {{drinking}} age is 21, except when {{accompanied by a}} parent, guardian, or spouse who is at least 21 years old. Age requirements are waived for possessing alcohol when employed by a brewer, brewpub, beer and/or liquor wholesaler, or producer of <b>alcohol</b> <b>fuel.</b> The minimum legal age to purchase alcohol is 21, with no exceptions. The Absolute Sobriety law states that any person not of legal drinking age (currently 21 years of age) may not drive after consuming alcohol.|$|E
25|$|One {{liter of}} ethanol contain 21.1 MJ, a liter of {{methanol}} 15.8 MJ and a liter of gasoline approximately 32.6 MJ. In other words, {{for the same}} energy content as one liter or one gallon of gasoline, one needs 1.6 liters/gallons of ethanol and 2.1 liters/gallons of methanol. The raw energy-per-volume numbers produce misleading fuel consumption numbers however, because alcohol-fueled engines can be made substantially more energy-efficient. A larger percentage of the energy available in a liter of <b>alcohol</b> <b>fuel</b> {{can be converted to}} useful work. This difference in efficiency can partially or totally balance out the energy density difference, depending on the particular engines being compared.|$|E
25|$|Fuel {{dispensers}} {{are used}} to pump petrol/gasoline, diesel, compressed natural gas, CGH2, HCNG, LPG, liquid hydrogen, kerosene, <b>alcohol</b> <b>fuel</b> (like methanol, ethanol, butanol, propanol), biofuels (like straight vegetable oil, biodiesel), or other types of fuel into the tanks within vehicles and calculate the financial cost of the fuel transferred to the vehicle. Fuel dispensers are also known as bowsers (in some parts of Australia), petrol pumps (in most Commonwealth countries) or gas pumps (in North America). Besides fuel dispensers, one other significant device which {{is also found in}} filling stations and can refuel certain (compressed-air) vehicles is an air compressor, although generally these are just used to inflate car tyres. Also, many filling stations incorporate a convenience store, which like most other buildings generally have electricity sockets; hence plug-in electric vehicles can be recharged.|$|E

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. Controlled auto-ignition (CAI) combustion in the gasoline engine has been extensively studied {{in the last several}} years due to its potential for simultaneous improvement in fuel consumption and exhaust emissions. At the same time, there has been increasing interest in the use of alternative fuels in order to reduce reliance on conventional fossil fuels. Therefore, this study has been carried out to investigate the effect of <b>alcohol</b> <b>fuels</b> on the combustion characteristics and in-cylinder processes of CAI combustion in a single cylinder gasoline engine. In order to study the effect of <b>alcohol</b> <b>fuels,</b> combustion characteristics were investigated by heat releases analysis in the first part. The combustion process was studied through flame structure and excited molecule by chemiluminescence imaging. Furthermore, in-cylinder gas composition was analysis by GC-MS to identify the auto-ignition reactions involved in the CAI combustion. In addition, the influence of spark-assisted ignition and injection timings were also studied. <b>Alcohol</b> <b>fuels,</b> in particular methanol, resulted in advanced auto-ignition and faster combustion than that of gasoline. In addition, their use could lead to substantially lower HC, NOX and CO exhaust emissions. Spark-assisted ignition assisted gasoline combustion by advancing ignition timing and initiating flame kernel at the centre of combustion chamber but it had marginal effect on <b>alcohol</b> <b>fuels.</b> Auto-ignition always took place at the perimeter of the chamber and occurred earlier with <b>alcohol</b> <b>fuels.</b> Fuel reforming reactions during the NVO period were observed and they had significant effect on alcohol combustion...|$|R

2500|$|The {{standard}} Redstone {{was fueled}} with a 75 percent ethyl alcohol 25 percent water solution, {{essentially the same}} propellants as the V-2, but the Jupiter-C first stage had used hydyne fuel, a blend of 60 percent unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) and 40 percent diethylenetriamine (DETA).
