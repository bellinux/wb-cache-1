6000|$|Grisell did not {{understand}} the thought, and still wept bitterly. [...] "Must she be a nun all her life?" [...] was all she thought of, and the shady cloister seemed to her like a sort of prison. Sister Avice had to soothe and comfort her, till her tears were all spent, as so often before, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>cried</b> herself so ill that she had to be taken back to her bed and lie down again. It was some days before she could be coaxed out again to encounter any companions.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was this}} noble matron herself who wrote, the next day, inclosing a card of {{invitation}} from Mrs. Bray and expressing {{the hope that}} Rose would come and dine and let her ladyship take her. She should have only {{one of her own}} girls; Gwendolen Vesey was to take the other. Rose handed both the note and the card in silence to her mother; the latter exhibited only the name of Miss Tramore. [...] "You had much better go, dear," [...] her mother said; in answer to which Miss Tramore slowly tore up the documents, looking with clear, meditative eyes out of the window. Her mother always said [...] "You had better go"--there had been other incidents--and Rose had never even once taken account of the observation. She would make no first advances, only plenty of second ones, and, condoning no discrimination, would treat no omission as venial. She would keep all concessions till afterwards; then she would make them one by one. Fighting society was quite as hard as her grandmother had said it would be; but there was a tension in it which made the dreariness vibrate--the dreariness of such a winter as she had just passed. Her companion had cried at the end of it, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>cried</b> all through; only her tears had been private, while her mother's had fallen once for all, at luncheon on the bleak Easter Monday--produced by the way a silent survey of the deadly square brought home to her that every creature but themselves was out of town and having tremendous fun. Rose felt that it was useless to attempt to explain simply by her mourning this severity of solitude; for if people didn't go to parties (at least a few didn't) for six months after their father died, this was the very time other people took for coming to see them. It was not too much to say that during this first winter of Rose's period with her mother she had no communication whatever with the world. It had the effect of making her take to reading the new American books: she wanted to see how girls got on by themselves. She had never read so much before, and there was a legitimate indifference in it when topics failed with her mother. They often failed after the first days, and then, while she bent over instructive volumes, this lady, dressed as if for an impending function, sat on the sofa and watched her. Rose was not embarrassed by such an appearance, for she could reflect that, a little before, her companion had not even a girl who had taken refuge in queer researches to look at. She was moreover used to her mother's attitude by this time. She had her own description of it: it was the attitude of waiting for the carriage. If they didn't go out it was not that Mrs. Tramore was not ready in time, and Rose had even an alarmed prevision of their some day always arriving first. Mrs. Tramore's conversation at such moments was abrupt, inconsequent and personal. She {{sat on the edge of}} sofas and chairs and glanced occasionally at the fit of her gloves (she was perpetually gloved, and the fit was a thing it was melancholy to see wasted), as people do who are expecting guests to dinner. Rose used almost to fancy herself at times a perfunctory husband on the other side of the fire.|$|E
60|$|The {{tears were}} in Saxon's eyes, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> could <b>have</b> <b>cried</b> over the manhandled body of her {{beautiful}} sick boy.|$|R
50|$|Megan: When the girls' ex-boyfriends {{came to the}} house, Megan {{cried and}} yelled at her ex-boyfriend when he {{revealed}} he was only there to promote his bar, which made her upset <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> never <b>cried</b> about anything {{when she was in}} the house except for her ex-boyfriend which when Bret found out he thought she still was in love with her boyfriend and decided to end her tour.|$|R
60|$|Hilda {{had already}} been {{informed}} by the finger alphabet, which had been her means of communication since her illness, of {{the result of the}} conversation with the doctor on the previous day, <b>and</b> although <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>cried</b> at the thought of being separated from her father <b>and</b> mother, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> said that <b>she</b> would willingly bear anything if there was a hope of her regaining her hearing. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> watched earnestly the conversation between the doctor and her parents, and when the former had left and they explained what was proposed, her face brightened up.|$|R
60|$|How lonely {{the house}} looks without him! The corded trunks and book-boxes {{are there in}} his empty study. Laura asks leave to come and sleep in Helen's room: <b>and</b> when <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>cried</b> herself to sleep there, the mother goes softly into Pen's vacant chamber, and kneels down by the bed on which the moon is shining, and there prays for her boy, as mothers only know how to plead. He knows that her pure blessings are {{following}} him, as he is carried miles away.|$|R
60|$|Then Castell and Margaret {{gave their}} evidence, the latter with much modest sweetness. Indeed, when she {{explained}} that Peter was her affianced husband, to whom <b>she</b> was to <b>have</b> been wed {{on the day after}} <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been stolen away from England, <b>and</b> that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>cried</b> out to him for help when the dead soldier caught hold of her and rent away her veil, there was a murmur of sympathy, and the king and queen began to talk with each other without paying much heed to her further words.|$|R
6000|$|He was {{not calling}} {{to his own}} mother far away on the great plain; he had {{forgotten}} her. Now he only thought of the beautiful woman of the Hills, who was so strong, and loved him and made him call her [...] "Mother"; and to her he cried in his need for help. Now he remembered her warm, protecting bosom, <b>and</b> how <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>cried</b> every night at the fear of losing him; how when he ran from her she followed him, calling to him to return. Ah, how cold was the sea's bosom, how bitter its lips! ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{by degrees}} I learned the story, but I will not write it here, {{for it is}} known to the world. When Marina had served his turn and her wit was of no more service to him, the conqueror {{discarded}} her, leaving her to wither of a broken heart. She told me all the tale of her anguish when she learned the truth, <b>and</b> of how <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>cried</b> to him that thenceforth he would never prosper. Nor indeed did he do so.|$|R
5000|$|The plot {{revolves}} around {{a phone call}} she receives: an invitation {{to have dinner with}} an old friend, Della. She concocts a fake face to wear so her friend doesn't know of her [...] "skin disease". As Della explains a problem <b>she's</b> <b>having,</b> Rainie's [...] "face" [...] falls into the plate of spaghetti bolognese that she ordered, revealing her true face. <b>She</b> runs away, <b>and</b> to her apartment, where she wonders how she can kill herself, despite being invulnerable. Fortunately, Death, who was dealing with a woman who'd slipped on a stepladder, enters her room, explaining that the door was open, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> heard her <b>crying.</b> <b>She</b> tells her how she can talk to the sun god, Ra, and beg for a merciful death.|$|R
50|$|Punisher and Jimmy were ambushed by {{some members}} of the Cullen Crime Family and were able to {{temporarily}} get away from them. The rest of the Cullen Crime Family tracked Punisher and Jimmy to an abandoned truck stop where Punisher picked them off. Jimmy was able to confront Peach Cullen and Midge where he held them at gunpoint and coerced Peach into ending their war. Lori was unable to let them get away with what they done and killed Peach <b>and</b> Midge. After <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>cried</b> out that Jimmy killed them which was heard by Punisher, Jimmy fled into the night. After Punisher and Jimmy had gone their separate ways, the female half of the Cullen Crime Family arrived where they dying Peach Cullen told them that Lori was a true Cullen which led to Lori taking up the Cullen name and becoming the leader of the Cullen girls.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Clive Newcome {{burst out}} into fierce {{laughter}} {{when he saw}} the cocoa-nut tree; he laughed so loud that baby woke, and his mother-in-law called him a brute, and the nurse ran to give its accustomed quietus to the little screaming infant. Rosey's eyes poured forth a torrent of little protests, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> would <b>have</b> <b>cried</b> yet more loudly than the other baby, had not her husband, again fiercely checking her, sworn with a dreadful oath, that unless she told him the whole truth, [...] "By heavens she should leave the house with nothing but what covered her." [...] Even the Campaigner could not make head against Clive's stern resolution; and the incipient insurrection of the maids and the mistresses was quelled by his spirit. The lady's-maid, a flighty creature, received her wages and took her leave: but the nurse could not find it in her heart to quit her little nursling so suddenly, and accompanied Clive's household in the journey upon which those poor folks were bound. What stolen goods were finally discovered when the family reached foreign parts were found in Mrs. Mackenzie's trunks, not in her daughter's: a silver filigree basket, a few teaspoons, baby's gold coral, and a costly crimson velvet-bound copy of the Hon. Miss Grimstone's Church Service, to which articles, having thus appropriated them, Mrs. Mackenzie henceforward laid claim as her own.|$|R
50|$|See Cyclops!

6000|$|... 'M. Donat {{called it}} a jest,' I wrote {{at the time in}} my diary. 'It seemed to me more in the nature of a terrified conjuration, as though she would divert the ghost's {{attention}} from herself. A cannibal race may well have cannibal phantoms.' The guesses of the traveller appear foredoomed to be erroneous; yet in these I was precisely right. The woman had stood by in terror at the funeral, being then in a dread spot, the graveyard. She looked on in terror to the coming night, with that ogre, a new spirit, loosed upon the isle. <b>And</b> the words <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>cried</b> in Donat's face were indeed a terrified conjuration, basely to shield herself, basely to dedicate another in her stead. One thing is to be said in her excuse. Doubtless she partly chose Donat because {{he was a man of}} great good-nature, but partly, too, because he was a man of the half- caste. For I believe all natives regard white blood as a kind of talisman against the powers of hell. In no other way can they explain the unpunished recklessness of Europeans.|$|R
5000|$|Amy has dated many men, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> {{expresses a}} sexually adventurous attitude. In Bender's Game she portrayed {{bisexual}} characteristics. In [...] "Proposition Infinity", <b>she</b> <b>had</b> a robosexual relationship with Bender; <b>She</b> also <b>has</b> {{a thing for}} 'bad boys'. She dated Fry {{for a time in}} [...] "Put Your Head on My Shoulders", but the relationship was brief. However, during their relationship, he was involved in an accident, which caused her to have his head grafted onto her shoulder to save his life. She still carries a disfiguring scar from the incident. <b>She</b> <b>has</b> been dating Kif Kroker since 3001. Although she is not ready for total commitment, Amy is sure that one day she will be. In [...] "Kif Gets Knocked Up A Notch", she became the [...] "Smizmar" [...] of Kif's children; that is, she inspired the feelings of love that caused Kif to be receptive to procreation. Although Leela is the biological mother because she grabbed Kif's ungloved hand to keep him from being sucked out of his spaceship, not knowing that, in his receptive state, this would impregnate him (some of the children even have only one eye like Leela), the Smizmar is considered to be the true mother in Kif's culture. Amy's love for Kif is undeniable, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> been seen <b>crying</b> when Kif goes on dangerous missions, fearing for his well-being.|$|R
60|$|The {{first thing}} that struck me in Mr. Searle's {{appearance}} was his very limited stature, which was less by half a head than that of his sister. The second was the preternatural redness of his hair and beard. They intermingled over his ears and surrounded {{his head like a}} huge lurid nimbus. His face was pale and attenuated, the face of a scholar, a dilettante, a comparer of points and texts, a man who lives in a library bending over books and prints and medals. At a distance it might have passed for smooth and rather blankly composed; but on a nearer view it revealed a number of wrinkles, sharply etched and scratched, of a singularly aged and refined effect. It was the complexion of a man of sixty. His nose was arched and delicate, identical almost with the nose of my friend. His eyes, large and deep-set, had a kind of auburn glow, the suggestion of a keen metal red-hot--or, more plainly, were full of temper and spirit. Imagine this physiognomy--grave and solemn, grotesquely solemn, in spite of the bushy brightness which made a sort of frame for it--set in motion by a queer, quick, defiant, perfunctory, preoccupied smile, and you will have an imperfect notion of the remarkable presence of our host; something better worth seeing and knowing, I perceived as I quite breathlessly took him in, than anything we had yet encountered. How thoroughly I had entered into sympathy with my poor picked-up friend, and how effectually I had associated my sensibilities with his own, I had not suspected till, within the short five minutes before the signal for dinner, I became aware, without his giving me the least hint, of his placing himself on the defensive. To neither of us was Mr. Searle sympathetic. I might have guessed from her attitude that his sister entered into our thoughts. A marked change had been wrought in her since the morning; during the hour, indeed--as I read {{in the light of the}} wondering glance he cast at her--that had elapsed since her parting with her cousin. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> not yet recovered from some great agitation. Her face was pale <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> clearly been <b>crying.</b> These notes of trouble gave her a new and quite perverse dignity, which was further enhanced by something complimentary and commemorative in her dress.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{know it is}} very {{tiresome}} of me; I {{would help}} it, if I could-- indeed I would.' <b>And</b> <b>she</b> cried the more because <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>cried.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Julia Suryakusuma (The Jakarta Post) said <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>cried</b> while {{watching}} the film.|$|R
60|$|The {{disease had}} done the work rapidly on the mother's {{exhausted}} frame, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> was buried a week after her boy. Lucy had seen the procession from the window, and thought it necessary to tell how <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>cried.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{had met her}} as a lad before I {{went away}} in this trade. She asked then if <b>she</b> might ride, <b>and</b> then down <b>she</b> fell in a faint. I picked her up and put her in, <b>and</b> there <b>she</b> <b>has</b> been ever since. <b>She</b> <b>has</b> <b>cried</b> a good deal, but <b>she</b> <b>has</b> hardly spoke; all <b>she</b> <b>has</b> told me being that <b>she</b> was to <b>have</b> been married this morning. I {{tried to get her}} to eat something, but <b>she</b> couldn't; <b>and</b> at last <b>she</b> fell asleep." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How you frightened me!" [...] <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>cried.</b> <b>She</b> thought {{something}} dreadful had happened. And he woke Rebecca, {{who had to}} be up so early.|$|R
60|$|Poor Lisbeth did {{not hear}} this threat for the first time, <b>and</b> if <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been wise <b>she</b> would <b>have</b> gone away quietly and said nothing for the next hour. But {{one of the lessons}} a woman most rarely learns is never to talk to an angry or a drunken man. Lisbeth sat down on the {{chopping}} bench and began to cry, and by the time <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>cried</b> enough to make her voice very piteous, she burst out into words.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I love {{going to}} London!" [...] <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>cried,</b> opening her arms with the charming, exotic gesticulation which {{distinguished}} her {{from all other}} women. [...] "I enjoy myself awfully." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope he {{was none}} {{the worse for}} it," [...] said the {{sporting}} character who had been telling Staveley just now how <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>cried</b> when <b>she</b> got home that night.|$|R
60|$|Rilla was basting {{the hem of}} a {{sheet for}} the first time in her life. When the word had come that Jem must go <b>she</b> <b>had</b> her <b>cry</b> out among the pines in Rainbow Valley <b>and</b> then <b>she</b> <b>had</b> gone to her mother.|$|R
6000|$|... "'She has no pain,' he said. 'She {{could hardly}} believe, {{when she came}} round, that the tooth was out. It is a relief, indeed. <b>She</b> <b>has</b> <b>cried,</b> day <b>and</b> night, {{for the past three}} days.' ...|$|R
60|$|Helena <b>had</b> {{rejected}} him. <b>She</b> gave {{herself to}} her fancies only. For some time <b>she</b> <b>had</b> confused Siegmund with her god. Yesterday <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>cried</b> to her ideal lover, and found only Siegmund. It was the spear {{in the side of}} his tortured self-respect.|$|R
60|$|Gudrun {{could only}} partly understand. <b>She</b> could <b>have</b> <b>cried</b> with vexation.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> when <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> her <b>cry</b> out <b>she</b> got up <b>and</b> searched all up {{and down}} the wood. But it was no use; there was not a sign of the pigs.|$|R
60|$|Erös Béla {{had brought}} the news, and Elsa, on hearing it thus blurted out in Béla's rough, cruel fashion, had turned deathly pale, ere she {{contrived}} {{to run out of}} the room and hide herself away in a corner, where <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>cried</b> till <b>she</b> <b>had</b> made herself sick and faint.|$|R
60|$|Half-an-hour {{afterwards}} {{there was}} a wild cry {{in the house and}} Marston shivered. It was the woman's voice and he knew why <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>cried</b> out. Then Wyndham came to the door, and standing with his back against the light, looked about for his comrade.|$|R
6000|$|Amanda <b>had</b> {{said that}} <b>she</b> <b>and</b> the dogs would {{come with him}} up the hill, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> said it exactly as a boy might <b>have</b> said it, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> brought {{him up to the}} corner of Up Park and had sat down there on a heap of stones and watched him until he was out of sight, waving to him when he looked back. [...] "Come back again," [...] <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>cried.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, what a beauty" [...] <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>cried</b> {{at sight}} of Bob. From the shining light in her eyes, {{and the face}} filled with delight, he would {{scarcely}} have believed that it belonged to a young woman he had known in the office, the young woman with the controlled, subdued office face.|$|R
6000|$|He {{dropped the}} skees, put one arm about her {{shoulders}} and one about her knees, <b>and</b> almost before <b>she</b> <b>had</b> finished <b>crying,</b> [...] "Oh no, please don't carry me!" [...] he was half-way up the slope. He set her down safe by the road.|$|R
6000|$|The damsels, who had {{thoughts}} of some great harm, [...] Began, {{as is the}} consequence of fear, [...] To scold a little at the false alarm [...] That broke for nothing on their sleeping car.
