40|$|Purpose: The fire {{response}} of structural reinforced concrete columns is usually {{justified by the}} reduction in ultimate load bearing capacity. This {{is due to the}} decrease in mechanical strength of steel and concrete upon exposure to a fire. In structural design, it is more desirable to consider the action of load directly. The concept of equivalent <b>accidental</b> <b>load</b> due to a fire might give more convenient structural design data. This paper aims to focus on these issues. Design/methodology/approach: A theoretical analysis for the equivalent <b>accidental</b> <b>load</b> imposed on reinforced concrete columns (axially loaded columns, uniaxially loaded columns and biaxially loaded columns) exposed to four-side fires is carried out. The test results of previous research are used as examples and for checking computations. After determining its temperature field, the equivalent <b>accidental</b> <b>load</b> due to fire is calculated using simplified methods. The fire resistance period of reinforced concrete columns can also be determined. Findings: If the {{response of}} a structural element to a fire can be converted into an <b>accidental</b> <b>load,</b> it can be combined with other components such as wind load and earthquake action to give a total design load. With this method, the equivalent <b>accidental</b> <b>load</b> due to a fire and fire resistance of reinforced concrete columns at elevated temperature can be derived directly, and the process is very simple. The equivalent <b>accidental</b> <b>load</b> and fire resistance of reinforced concrete columns exposed to fire on one, two or three sides can also be derived by the same method. However, the thermal performance of steel and concrete cannot be considered during the calculation. Originality/value: A simplified approach of equivalent <b>accidental</b> <b>load</b> due to fire is proposed. Much simpler guides can be drafted in structural fire design.

40|$|Fire, {{as one of}} {{the most}} severe <b>accidental</b> <b>load</b> situations, has an {{important}} effect on concrete columns. Furthermore, this effect is more pronounced in case an eccentricity is associated with the axial load. Since this situation occurs very frequently, it is significant to investigate the fire performance of concrete columns subjected to biaxial bending. Additionally, differences due to initial imperfections on configurations, cover thickness, as well as the common variability in the concrete compressive strength might cause significant differences to interaction diagrams. Therefore, a probabilistic evaluation is required as a first step to evaluate the safety of concrete columns during fire exposure.

40|$|AbstractFlat slab {{concrete}} {{buildings are}} widely found in infrastructure such as office and residential buildings or industrial facilities. The susceptibility of progressive collapse of such structures due to <b>accidental</b> <b>loads</b> is {{highly dependent on}} the structural performance of the slab-column connections. This paper presents a framework for a simplified reliability analysis and derivation of safety factors for computing the probability of punching of flat slab concrete buildings subjected to <b>accidental</b> <b>loads</b> such as column removal, slab falling from above or blast load. The main advantage of the proposed approach is that it considers in a simple manner, the uncertainty in the gravity load applied in the slab before the accidental event, which affects the inertial effects and demand/capacity ratio in the slab-column connections. Eurocode 2 and the Critical Shear Crack Theory for punching are used and extended to dynamic cases {{for the assessment of}} the demand/capacity ratio using computer-based time history finite element simulations. The proposed reliability method is applied to a case study of an existing building showing that the column removal situation is not always critical whereas the slab falling from above is much more detrimental...|$|R

In the context of open building systems, modular construction provides a systemised approach to design in which the benefits of prefabrication are maximised.

40|$|The Norwegian risk {{management}} approach for offshore installations requires that risk analysis shall {{provide a basis}} for making decision on the design <b>accidental</b> <b>load</b> that shall be used in the design to avoid major accident risk. One of the major risks on offshore installations is explosion risk. An explosion involves interaction of many variable uncertain parameters. Explosion risk assessment is a complex process which involves a range of analyses with uncertainties. As a part of risk analysis, dimensioning <b>accidental</b> <b>load</b> for explosion is determined using a probabilistic explosion assessment as described by NORSOK Z- 013 and comparing the results with applicable risk acceptance criteria. Dimensioning accidental loads determined as above provides decision support in establishing design accidental loads that are considered to be valid throughout the installations lifetime. Design accidental loads are established in the early phase of the project. A decision needs to be taken at the initial phase of the project where sufficient information to determine the real picture is not available. Currently no clear guidance exists in the industry on how the design accidental loads are selected based on DAL determined by the risk analysis. Different views exists across the industry whether to consider modifications into account in establishing design <b>accidental</b> <b>load.</b> The influence of minor modifications on DAL during the operational phase is discussed. Minor modification projects, not individually considered to have significant impact on the total risk level, but together and over time result in significant increase in risk level. Petroleum safety authority’s updated definition for risk as “the consequences of the activities, with associated uncertainty” demands increased focus in the way the uncertainty is presently handled in the risk analysis. Current offshore risk assessment process uses (A, C, P) perspective and describes risk using probabilities and expected values for the decision making and no account for the uncertainties hidden in the analyst's background knowledge is given. This may bring surprises when the knowledge used in the analysis is weak. The decisions following this approach and comparing with risk acceptance criterion may lead to accept the results irrespective of its robustness. This means a lean disproportionate weight is given to further risk reduction process like ALARP (As Low As Reasonably Practicable). Safety decision contexts require different decisions with respect to uncertainties. In case of high uncertainties measures following cautionary principle are normally implemented. In reducing the risk beyond minimum acceptance criterion following ALARP, current practice uses cost-benefit analysis where a single grossly disproportionate criterion is used for all decision contexts. This way the ALARP principle turns out to be static. To be an appropriate principle in safety context, ALARP should be dynamic in the sense that ranges from one extreme, where decisions are made following only cost benefit analysis in some decision contexts, to another, in which the cautionary principle is adopted with no reference to cost-benefit analyses for others. A new method to achieve an improved decision on design accidental explosion load with some changes in the current practice to comply with risk reduction principles outlined in in the Framework regulations § 11 is established. This method follows (A, C, U) perspective that holds uncertainty as a main component of risk and use both risk acceptance criteria and ALARP principle in establishing design accidental explosion loads taking uncertainties. In the suggested approach probabilities are only considered as tools that describe the epistemic-based uncertainty factors i. e. factors that could cause surprises relative to the assigned probabilities and expected values. The uncertainty factors related to the applied knowledge will be identified and assessed for its influence on the total risk following a semi-quantitative method. In addition to the uncertainty factors assessment, guidelines need to be established by the decision maker to decide the decision context that shall be applied to implement ALARP. The suggested method is expected to improve the ALARP by making it dynamic and optimise the margins in the design accidental loads by uncertainty analysis of the parameters. The method is elaborated in detail for a decision problem related to explosion event and a case study is presented wherein the principles of the suggested method is applied...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Vessels {{are rarely}} {{subjected}} to <b>accidental</b> <b>loads</b> {{such as the}} collision, grounding and stranding. But these <b>accidental</b> <b>loads</b> {{cause a lot of}} damages to hull structure including a large deformation, fracture, tearing and so on. In case of carrying dangerous goods such as crude oil, these accidents can induce a serious environmental pollution. All ocean-going vessels were made by welding. The welding residual stress is a significant shortcoming of welding remains at the hull structure, even though welding technology in shipbuilding field has provided a variety of advantages, e. g. remarkable shortening of the shipbuilding time. The aim {{of this paper is to}} investigate the effects of the residual stress in a grounding accident. When a ship runs aground against a sea-obstacle like a rock, this accident can be classified as a grounding. Among parameters of grounding accident scenarios such as the ship speed, the initial striking point, and loading conditions of the ship, only ship speed varies from 10 to 15 knots under ballast condition with/without consideration of residual stress(this sentence is not clear to the read). The initial striking point is at the bow of the center line of ship. A series of nonlinear numerical simulations with large deformation and fracture were carried out using LS-DYNA. As a result, two cases with residual stress have longer damage length. The difference seems to be relatively small, but not negligible...|$|R

40|$|Disproportionate {{collapse}} {{occurs when}} the removal of load bearing members (one or more columns, or load bearing walls) causes localized structural damage which leads to further loss of load bearing members and, ultimately, {{to the collapse of}} whole or part of the structure. The <b>accidental</b> <b>load,</b> carried by the removed column can be transferred to nearby columns either by beam action or by catenary action. Simple connections such as fin plate, double angle web cleat and flexible end plate connections are routinely assumed to be com-pliant with the tying force design method, which aims to ensure that column loads are redistributed via cate-nary action in the event of damage. This is feasible only if the joints have sufficient ductility as well as tensile strength. Semi-rigid and rigid connections redistribute the column loads through beam action, provided that the connections have sufficient rotation capacity. This investigation demonstrates that the beam-column joints (simple and semi-rigid connections) in many designs have insufficient ductility to successfully bridge dam-aged columns. In simple (nominally pinned) connections, a couple can develop between beam flange and col-umn due to insufficient joint ductility. The resulting prying action is shown to cause early joint fracture and subsequently to lead to progressive failure. In semi-rigid connections, the beam remains elastic and the con-nections plastify, leading to early joint failure...|$|E
40|$|The Norwegian Petroleum Safety Authority (PSA) {{requires}} offshore petroleum operators on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS) {{to perform}} risk assessments of impacts (allisions) between passing ships and offshore installations. These risk assessments {{provide a basis}} for defining the allision <b>accidental</b> <b>load</b> that the installation shall be designed for. Even though the risk of allision is small, the potential consequences can be catastrophic. In a worst-case scenario, an allision may result in the total loss of an installation. The ageing industry standard allision risk model, COLLIDE, calculates the risk of impacts between passing (non-field-related) ships and installations based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. Both the COLLIDE risk model and a new Bayesian allision risk model currently under development are highly sensitive to variations in vessels’ passing distances, especially close proximity passings. Allision risk assessments are typically performed during the design and development phase of an installation, which means that historical AIS data are used “as is”, disregarding future changes to the traffic pattern when the new installation is placed on a location. This article presents an empirical study {{of one of the most}} important variables used to calculate the risk of allision from passing vessels, namely passing distance. The study shows that merchant vessels alter course to achieve a safe passing distance to new surface offshore petroleum installations.

40|$|The present {{document}} details the design guidelines which emanates from the RobustImpact project. The reasoning used is depicted below in Figure 1 - 1. The {{first step is}} to define the impact scenario and its key parameters. Then the impact can be characterized as a hard impact or as a soft impact. The first option assumes that the kinetic energy of the impactor is absorbed by the impactor itself while the second option assumes that the kinetic energy of the impactor is mainly absorbed by the column, thus leading to plastic deformations and the activation of geometrical non-linear effects in the column. If the soft impact is considered, the buckling resistance of the column must be examined in order to evaluate if the impacted column shows sufficient residual resistance after the impact. If this is not the case, the structure will resist if it is able to sustain the load initially carried by the impacted column by redistributing it in the damaged structure, i. e. if it is able to activate alternative load path. The resistance brought by other structural elements will then be evaluated. If the impacted column is a peripheral column, the yield line theory is used to evaluate the resistance of both slab and beams. In case of a central column, Bailey’s method evaluating the slab resistance taking into account the membrane effect is used to determine the contribution of the slab. The contribution of the beams is then quantified by evaluating the corresponding P-u curve. All the methods have been validated using FEM softwares. Since the project concerns structures whose columns are impacted by vehicles, the <b>accidental</b> <b>load</b> combination must be considered.

In particular, in order to show a DEMO-relevant thermo-mechanical and thermal–hydraulic behavior, the HCLL-TBM has to meet several requirements especially as far as its coolant thermofluid-dynamic conditions and its thermal–mechanical field are concerned. The present paper is focused on the assessment of the HCLL-TBM thermal–mechanical performances under both nominal and <b>accidental</b> <b>load</b> conditions, by adopting a computational approach based on the Finite Element Method. A realistic 3 D finite element model of the whole HCLL-TBM, in the horizontal first wall design has been set up, consisting of about 597, 000 elements and 767, 000 nodes. In particular, since the thermal fields of both the module and the coolant are strictly coupled, the helium flow domain has been modeled too and a thermal contact model has been set up to properly simulate the convective heat transfer between the structure wall and the coolant. Pure conductive heat transfer has been assumed within the Pb–Li eutectic alloy of the breeder units. The volumetric density of the nuclear deposited power, recently calculated at Department of Nuclear Engineering of the University of Palermo by the MCNP 4 C code, has been applied as distributed thermal load in order to assess the potential influence on the module thermo-mechanical performances of the markedly non-uniform poloidal and toroidal distributions that have been predicted within the Segment Box. Different loading scenarios have been considered as to the heat flux onto the module First Wall. Steady state and transient thermal–mechanical analyses have been carried out and the detailed spatial distributions of the thermal and mechanical fields obtained as to the considered loading scenarios are reported, together with a critical analysis intended to verify their compliance with the agreed design criteria and the DEMO relevance requirements...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{helideck}} structure must {{satisfy the}} safety requirements associated with various environmental and <b>accidental</b> <b>loads.</b> Especially, {{there have been}} a number of fire accidents offshore due to helicopter collision (take-off and/or landing) in recent decades. To prevent further accidents, a substantial amount of effort has been directed toward the management of fire in the safety design of offshore helidecks. The aims of this study are to introduce and apply a procedure for quantitative risk assessment and management of fires by defining the fire loads with an applied example. The frequency of helicopter accidents are considered, and design accidental levels are applied. The proposed procedures for determining design fire loads can be efficiently applied in offshore helideck development projects...|$|R
40|$|Finite Element Models (FEM) {{allow to}} {{incorporate}} the structural interaction between different sections and possible stress redistributions, enabling a more economic (performance-based) design. However, the uncertainty with respect to material and geometrical properties can have a significant influence on the obtained safety level, especially when the structure is exposed to <b>accidental</b> <b>loads</b> such as fire. Using a Latin Hypercube Sampling procedure (LHS) and the Finite Element software package ATENA, the safety level of a simply supported concrete slab exposed to fire is assessed. The structural fire resistance time is calculated, and a comparison is made with results obtained from a simplified full-probabilistic cross-section calculation method developed by the authors in a previous contribution...|$|R
