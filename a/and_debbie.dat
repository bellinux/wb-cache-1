He wrote the critically acclaimed artist's book Agrippa (a book of the dead) in 1992 before co-authoring The Difference Engine, an alternate history novel that would become a central work of the steampunk genre. He then spent an unfruitful period as a Hollywood screenwriter, with few of his projects seeing the light of day and those that did being critically unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|Auriemma {{pulled off}} {{one of his biggest}} and most {{important}} early recruiting successes in 1987 when he convinced an All American from New Hampshire, Kerry Bascom, to come to UConn.

5|$|Filming {{locations}} {{outside of}} Australia have included Kenya, the United States and the UK, which has seen Neighbours episodes filmed there on four occasions. In February 1990, Lyme Park in Cheshire doubled as the Ledgerwood estate set in Yorkshire. Derek Nimmo guest-starred as the fictitious Lord Ledgerwood {{in two of}} the episodes. In November 1992, the characters Rick Alessi (Dan Falzon) <b>and</b> <b>Debbie</b> Martin (Marnie Reece-Wilmore) visited London to attend a Michael Jackson concert. The second London-based storyline was broadcast in late March 2007, when Susan (Jackie Woodburne) and Karl Kennedy (Alan Fletcher) were seen taking a ride on the London Eye and being married on a boat on the River Thames.

5|$|Narrowly escaping, Mike <b>and</b> <b>Debbie</b> {{travel to}} the police station to report the {{incident}} to Debbie's ex-boyfriend, Deputy Dave Hanson (John Allen Nelson), and his curmudgeonly partner, Deputy Curtis Mooney (John Vernon). The skeptical Mooney believes the story to be a hoax. After taking Debbie home, Mike and Dave return to the woods, only to find the circus tent has vanished, leaving a large crater in its place. They then {{travel to the}} lovers' lane, only to find all the cars abandoned and covered in a cotton candy-like substance. Back in town, the klowns arrive and begin capturing townspeople in cocoons using rayguns that resemble toys. Several klowns perform pranks and mock circus acts, all resulting in the deaths of several onlookers.|$|E
5|$|Another {{significant}} {{storm was}} Hurricane Hattie, a late-season Category5 hurricane that struck Belize. Hattie caused 319confirmed fatalities and about $60.3million in damage. Destruction was so severe in Belize {{that the government}} had to relocate inland to a new city, Belmopan. The remnants of Hattie {{may have contributed to the}} development of Tropical Storm Simone in the eastern Pacific Ocean. In early November, the depression that would later strengthen into Hurricane Jenny brought light rainfall to Puerto Rico. The final storm, Tropical Storm Inga, dissipated on November8, after causing no impact on land. On September11, three hurricanes existed simultaneously – Betsy, Carla, <b>and</b> <b>Debbie</b> – the most on a single day in the Atlantic basin since 1893 and until 1998. Collectively, the storms of the 1961Atlantic hurricane season caused about $391million in damage and at least 348fatalities.|$|E
5|$|On September10, the Television Infrared Observation Satellite {{observed}} {{an area of}} convection, or thunderstorms, to {{the southwest}} of the Cape Verde islands, suggesting the possibility of tropical cyclogenesis. At 18:00UTC that day, a tropical depression formed and subsequently moved on a northwest trajectory. By the time the Hurricane Hunters reached the system on September12, winds of hurricane force were recorded, and as such, the San Juan, Puerto Rico Weather Bureau began issuing warnings on Hurricane Esther. It was later estimated that the system attained tropical storm status on September 11, although the National Hurricane Center later noted {{that it could have}} attained hurricane status by this date, thus potentially being one of four simultaneous hurricanes, along with hurricanes Betsy, Carla, <b>and</b> <b>Debbie.</b> The only other such occasions were in 1893 and 1998. This also made Esther the first hurricane to be discovered by satellite imagery, although not the first to be imaged by one.|$|E

5|$|The {{character}} of Martín Quesada establishes {{a context of}} wealthy characters. Quesada is a businessman and Formula 1 driver, but is not presented as selfish or greedy as is the archetype of entrepreneurs in soap operas. The two locations associated with him are the Quesada Group office, presided over by him, and his home. The office has the characters of Quesada's chief adviser Alfredo Uribe, the secretary Mercedes, and his cousin Miguel Quesada, who serves as vice-president, and the lawyer Felix Perez Garmendia. His girlfriend Constanza Insua and his cousin Debbie are also included. Martín lives with his housekeeper Rosa, Rosa's grandson Tony, and three adopted orphan siblings, José, Laura, and Coqui. Another recurring site is the apartment of Miguel <b>and</b> <b>Debbie,</b> which would be also used as the house of Constanza or Garmendia if needed.|$|E
5|$|Harry <b>and</b> <b>Debbie</b> punish Annie by not {{allowing}} {{her to go to}} Naomi's party. When they reconsider and decide to let her go, they discover that she has already left. Harry goes to the party to find Annie, but is instead told by Tracy that they have a son together, whom she gave up for adoption over twenty years ago. Adrianna, who had previously stolen money from Naomi's purse, claims to have found it and gives it back. Naomi checks her phone messages and learns that Ethan is cheating on her. Naomi asks Ethan if he is really cheating on her, and leaves the party after he fails to answer. Annie leaves with Silver for another party on the beach, where she apologizes to Ethan for revealing that he was cheating on Naomi. When she asks why he told the truth about Dixon not starting the fight, he replies that he is trying to be the good guy he used to be. Annie, Silver, Dixon and Navid {{spend the rest of the}} night swimming at the beach. In the closing scenes, Kelly talks to the father of her four-year-old son, Adrianna pays her drug dealer with money she stole from Naomi, and Ethan visits Naomi's house.|$|E
