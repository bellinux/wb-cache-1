5|$|Tertiary sexual {{dysfunction}} results from {{psychological and social}} factors. Reduced libido, desire, or experience of arousal {{could be due to}} psychological or situational factors such as depression, anxiety, and changes in relationships. Both sexes experience reduced sexual desire after SCI, and almost half of men and almost three quarters of women have trouble becoming psychologically aroused. Depression is {{the most common cause of}} problems with arousal in people with SCI. People frequently experience grief and despair initially after the injury. Anxiety and drug <b>and</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>abuse</b> may increase after discharge from a hospital as new challenges occur, which can exacerbate sexual difficulties.

By request of the mayor, Gain made it clear that gay police officers would be welcomed in the department; this became national news.

5|$|In a {{study of}} a {{district}} general hospital in the UK, 5.4% of all the hospital's self-harm cases were aged over 65. The male to female ratio was 2:3 although the self-harm rates {{for males and females}} over 65 in the local population were identical. Over 90% had depressive conditions, and 63% had significant physical illness. Under 10% of the patients gave a history of earlier self-harm, while both the repetition and suicide rates were very low, which could be explained by the absence of factors known to be associated with repetition, such as personality disorder <b>and</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>abuse.</b> However, NICE Guidance on Self-harm in the UK suggests that older people who self-harm are at a greater risk of completing suicide, with 1 in 5 older people who self-harm going on to end their life. A study completed in Ireland showed that older Irish adults have high rates of deliberate self-harm, but comparatively low rates of suicide.|$|E

40|$|Carbohydrate-deficient {{transferrin}} (CDT) {{is known}} to be increased in <b>alcohol</b> <b>abuse.</b> Several methods were developed for its measurement (e. g. isoelectric focusing with Western blotting or immunofixation, anion-exchange chromatography followed by immunoassays). We describe a greatly simplified isoelectric focusing technique which does not require immunofixation. CDT results obtained with this method were compared to other biological markers of <b>alcohol</b> <b>abuse,</b> i. e. mean corpuscular volume (MCV), aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT) and gamma-glutamyl-transferase (GGT), in 55 patients distributed in three groups (i. e. healthy control subjects, control patients suffering from various hepato-gastrointestinal diseases <b>and</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>abusing</b> patients). Sensitivity <b>and</b> specificity were 33 - 89 %, 61 - 57 %, 89 - 49 % and 83 - 100 % for MCV, ASAT, GGT and CDT, respectively.
