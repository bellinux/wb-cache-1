5000|$|SH 23A was an <b>alternate</b> <b>route</b> of SH 23 between Albany and Cross Plains created between 1919 and 1922. The <b>alternate</b> <b>route</b> was {{the eastern}} path through Cisco while the main route was the western path through Baird.

40|$|To ensure {{uninterrupted}} {{communication in}} a mobile ad-hoc network, efficient route discovery is crucial when nodes move and/or fail. Hence, protocols such as Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) precompute <b>alternate</b> <b>routes</b> before a node moves and/or fails. In this paper, we modify {{the way these}} <b>alternate</b> <b>routes</b> are maintained and used in DSR, and show that these modifications permit more efficient route discovery when nodes move and/or fail. Our routing protocol also does load balancing among the number of <b>alternate</b> <b>routes</b> that are available. Our simulation results show that maintenance of these <b>alternate</b> <b>routes</b> (without affecting the route cache size at each router) increases the packet delivery ratio. We also show that our approach enables us to provide QoS guarantees by ensuring that appropriate bandwidth {{will be available for}} a flow even when nodes move. Towards this end, we show how reservations can be made on the <b>alternate</b> <b>routes</b> while maximizing the bandwidth usage in situations where nodes do not move. We also show how the load of the traffic generated due to node movement is shared among several <b>alternate</b> <b>routes.</b> In addition, we adaptively use Forward Error Correction techniques with our protocol and show how it can improve the packet delivery ratio...|$|R

50|$|U.S. <b>Route</b> 13 <b>Alternate</b> (US 13A) was an <b>alternate</b> <b>route</b> of U.S. Route 13 serving Windsor, North Carolina.

5000|$|In {{addition}} to numbers, route numbers also use suffixed letters and banners appended to {{the tops of}} signs to indicate <b>alternate</b> <b>routes</b> to the main highway. For example, U.S. Route 1A is the name given to many highways which are either older alignments of U.S. Route 1 or provide an <b>alternate</b> <b>route</b> either around or through a city along U.S. Route 1's route. Banners are sometimes used to indicate <b>alternate</b> <b>routes.</b> Words like [...] "Alternate", [...] "Business", or [...] "Bypass" [...] {{can be added to}} a sign to indicate such a situation.|$|R

50|$|Primary routes are the {{mainline}} highways connecting Bakersfield {{with major}} destinations {{and other major}} transportation infrastructure. <b>Alternate</b> <b>routes</b> are other routes that connect major destinations and other major transportation infrastructure, but do not require travel on the primary route.

The reason is SR 58 and SR 14 are both mostly freeways and are capable of handling large semi-trucks. Local routes are the remaining state routes.
