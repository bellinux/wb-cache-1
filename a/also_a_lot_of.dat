After {{the success of}} the digitised and colourised version of Mayabazar released in January 2010, its makers announced that Pathala Bhairavi would be the next film to be remastered and re-released in colour. However Goldstone Technologies decided not to remaster the remaining 14 films including Pathala Bhairavi, saying that most of the producers who sold the rights of the negatives to TV channels lost control over them, adding that there were <b>also</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> legal issues over ownership and copyright issues whenever other producers try to do something on their own.|$|E

25|$|In a 1998 Harvard Law Review {{article by}} Michael Heller, {{he noted that}} {{after the fall of}} Communism, in many Eastern European cities, {{there were a lot of}} open air kiosks but <b>also</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> empty stores. Upon investigation, he {{concluded}} that because many different agencies and private parties had rights over the use of store space, it was difficult or even impossible for a startup retailer to negotiate successfully for the use of that space. Even though all the persons with ownership rights were losing money with the empty stores, and stores were in great demand, their competing interests got in the way of the effective use of space.|$|E

25|$|The comic book's {{publishing}} {{was started}} in 1972 by the state-owned company Vjesnik from Zagreb. This edition is still a popular collectors' item. First dozen issues didn't produce much success, however, the appearance in issue #25 of antagonist Superciuk (translated as Superhik) 'who steals from the poor and gives it to the rich' proved a hit with Yugoslav readership. <b>Also,</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> the comic book's success in Yugoslavia is due to Nenad Brixy's (born 1924 in Varaždinske Toplice) distinctive translation, rich in obscure, baroque-sounding Croatisms. A writer himself who penned several comedic novels about the clumsy detective character called Timothy Tacher, Brixy approached the job of translating Alan Ford in a free form and the resulting witty adaptation and imaginative text soon won him many admirers across the country.|$|E

500|$|The {{leadership}} question {{remained a}} feature of the Gillard Government's terms in office, and amidst ongoing leadership speculation following an ABC TV Four Corners examination of the events leading up to Rudd's replacement which cast doubt on Gillard's insistence that she did not actively campaign for the Prime Ministership, Attorney-General Nicola Roxon spoke of Rudd's record in the following terms: [...] "I don't think we should whitewash history – while {{there are a lot of}} very good things our government did with Kevin as prime minister, there were <b>also</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> challenges, and it's Julia who has seen through fixing a lot of those problems." ...|$|E

But there's <b>also</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> excitement for Mercedes as she sees him again, because he was the guy who won her heart for the first time. The storyline also explains why Mercedes is the way she is now". Mercedes and Johnny kissed, which Metcalfe said was them just [...] "getting lost in the moment" [...] and was partly due to Mercedes having doubts about Riley's fidelity. She added that Mercedes and Johnny spend time [...] "just talking and reliving the old times, especially how he won her over in the past".|$|E

500|$|The band hired Shirley {{and agreed}} to his {{recording}} conditions, which meant recording in New York City at Avatar Studios, taking weekends off and recording from 1:00–8:00pm. [...] Chris said of the rigid schedule, [...] "We loved it.... We had lives other than just being in the studio 24 hours a day, seven days a week. [...] Got a different vantage point on the whole thing." [...] Shirley's laid-back style also won praise from the band. [...] "Kevin is the first guy that I've worked with that just went with it—especially my singing. [...] A lot of this album is just my scratch vocals. It's very loose, and Kevin let it go.... He'd say, if we didn't get it {{in two or three}} takes, 'We'll come back tomorrow'", said Chris. [...] Of the album's lyrical bent, Chris said, [...] "...there is a lot of love on it, and I've never written love songs. [...] I do think having a muse in my life like the woman I'm with now helped.... I think there's <b>also</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> humor on this album, which is something we haven't touched on before, except maybe on Shake Your Money Maker, which was a lighter time and a lighter mood." [...] There was also a conscious effort to [...] "simplify the language", [...] which was inspired by Chris's listening to music by Otis Redding, George Jones and Muddy Waters. [...] "I realized how direct and honest those records were – and I wanted that here", said Chris.|$|E
500|$|Azeem Ahmad of MusicOMH {{positively}} reviewed Good Girl Gone Bad Live {{giving it}} four stars and wrote that [...] "it isn't {{going to win}} over any new fans, but buying it won't disappoint the many that already exist". According to him the songs are different from their recorded versions and sound [...] "infectiously upbeat but in a more grown-up way than the album". Ahmad concluded that even the [...] "cringey" [...] American pronunciation of [...] "Manchester" [...] and associated drivel can't take away the vocal strength of [...] "Rehab". He further praised the interlude [...] "Scratch" [...] calling it [...] "impressive". Ahmad concluded that [...] "If anyone was still wondering, Rihanna isn't miming during this show but the DVD's audio might be little bit {{out of sync with}} the video." [...] A reviewer of Blu-ray.com was more critical stating that even though the transfer does not has serious technical flaws, the video can not pair to Live from the Royal Albert Hall (2009) by American rock band The Killers. According to the reviewer there are few close-ups that look soft and <b>also</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> motion-judder that ranges from mild to strong. He stated that the camera positioning during a lot of acts in not [...] "overly convincing" [...] and some close-ups are too dark. However, according to him contrast levels are good. The reviewer concluded that [...] "all in all, consistency is definitely an issue with Good Girl Gone Bad; parts of the show look great in high-definition, but there are also certain parts of it that are far from convincing." [...] At the 2009 Grammy Awards, Good Girl Gone Bad Live received a nomination for Best Long Form Music Video, but lost to Runnin' Down a Dream (2007).|$|E
