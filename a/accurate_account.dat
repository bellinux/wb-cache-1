5|$|Although {{there is}} no <b>accurate</b> <b>account</b> of how many Indonesians died, they died in far greater numbers than the Europeans. Estimates of Indonesian deaths in {{fighting}} range from 45,000 to 100,000 and civilian dead exceeded 25,000 {{and may have been}} as high as 100,000. A total of 1,200 British soldiers were killed or went missing in Java and Sumatra in 1945 and 1946, most of them Indian soldiers. More than 5,000 Dutch soldiers lost their lives in Indonesia between 1945 and 1949. Many Japanese died; in Bandung alone, 1,057 died, only half of whom died in actual combat, the rest killed in rampages by Indonesians. Seven million people were displaced on Java and Sumatra.|$|E
5|$|Past {{estimates}} on {{the exact}} number of Chinese Indonesians relied on the 1930 Dutch East Indies census, which collected direct information on ethnicity. This census reported 1.23 million self-identified ethnic Chinese living in the colony, representing 2.03 {{percent of the total population}}, and was perceived to be an <b>accurate</b> <b>account</b> of the group's population. Ethnic information would not be collected again until the 2000 census and so was deduced from other census data, such as language spoken and religious affiliation, during the intermediate years. In an early survey of the Chinese Indonesian minority, anthropologist G. William Skinner estimated that between 2.3 million (2.4 percent) and 2.6 million (2.7 percent) lived in Indonesia in 1961. Former foreign minister Adam Malik provided a figure of 5 million in a report published in the Harian Indonesia daily in 1973. Many media and academic sources subsequently estimated between 4 and 5 percent of the total population as ethnic Chinese regardless of the year. Estimates during the 2000s have placed the figure between 6 and 7 million, and the Overseas Compatriot Affairs Commission of the Republic of China estimated a population as high as 7.67 million in 2006.|$|E

40|$|Experience with core-collapse {{supernova}} simulations {{shows that}} <b>accurate</b> <b>accounting</b> of total particle number and 4 -momentum {{can be a}} challenge for computational radiative transfer. This <b>accurate</b> <b>accounting</b> would be facilitated by the use of particle number and 4 -momentum transport equations that allow transparent conversion between volume and surface integrals in both configuration and momentum space. Such conservative formulations of general relativistic kinetic theory in multiple spatial dimensions are presented in this paper, and their relevance to core-collapse supernova simulations is described.

25|$|Articles {{arguing that}} geocentrism was the biblical {{perspective}} appeared in some early creation science newsletters {{associated with the}} Creation Research Society pointing to some passages in the Bible, which, when taken literally, indicate that the daily apparent motions of the Sun and the Moon are due to their actual motions around the Earth rather than due to {{the rotation of the}} Earth about its axis for example, Joshua 10:12 where the Sun and Moon are said to stop in the sky, and Psalms 93:1 where the world is described as immobile. Contemporary advocates for such religious beliefs include Robert Sungenis, co-author of the self-published Galileo Was Wrong: The Church Was Right (2006). These people subscribe to the view that a plain reading of the Bible contains an <b>accurate</b> <b>account</b> of {{the manner in which the}} universe was created and requires a geocentric worldview.

25|$|Most {{adherents of}} the Latter Day Saint {{movement}} consider the Book of Mormon to generally be a historically <b>accurate</b> <b>account.</b> Within the Latter Day Saint movement {{there are several}} apologetic groups that disagree with the skeptics and seek to reconcile the discrepancies in diverse ways. Among these apologetic groups, much work has been published by Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies (FARMS), and Foundation for Apologetic Information & Research (FAIR), defending the Book of Mormon as a literal history, countering arguments critical of its historical authenticity, or reconciling historical and scientific evidence with the text. One of the more common recent arguments is the limited geography model, which states {{that the people of}} the Book of Mormon covered only a limited geographical region in either Mesoamerica, South America, or the Great Lakes area. The LDS Church has published material indicating that science will support the historical authenticity of the Book of Mormon.|$|E

500|$|When Tom Norman {{first saw}} Merrick, he was {{dismayed by the}} extent of his deformities, fearing his {{appearance}} might be too horrific to be a successful novelty. Nevertheless, he exhibited Merrick in the back of an empty shop on Whitechapel Road. Merrick had an iron bed with a curtain drawn around to afford him some privacy. Norman observed Merrick asleep one morning and learned that he always slept sitting up, with his legs drawn up and his head resting on his knees. His enlarged head was too heavy to allow him to sleep lying down and, as Merrick put it, he would risk [...] "waking with a broken neck". Norman decorated the shop with posters that had been created by Hitchcock, depicting a monstrous half-man, half-elephant. A pamphlet titled [...] "The Autobiography of Joseph Carey Merrick" [...] was created, outlining Merrick's life to date. This biography, whether written by Merrick or not, provided a generally <b>accurate</b> <b>account</b> of his life. It contained an incorrect date of birth but, throughout his life, Merrick was vague about when he was born.|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} known European {{reference to}} the durian is the record of Niccolò Da Conti, who travelled to southeastern Asia in the 15th century. Translated from the Latin in which Poggio Bracciolini recorded Da Conti's travels: [...] "They [...] have a green fruit which they call durian, {{as big as a}} watermelon. Inside there are five things like elongated oranges, and resembling thick butter, with a combination of flavours." [...] The Portuguese physician Garcia de Orta described durians in Colóquios dos simples e drogas da India published in 1563. In 1741, Herbarium Amboinense by the German botanist Georg Eberhard Rumphius was published, providing the most detailed and <b>accurate</b> <b>account</b> of durians for over a century. The genus Durio has a complex taxonomy that has seen the subtraction and addition of many species since it was created by Rumphius. During the early stages of its taxonomical study, there was some confusion between durian and the soursop (Annona muricata), for both of these species had thorny green fruit. It is also interesting to note the Malay name for the soursop is durian Belanda, meaning Dutch durian. In the 18th century, Johann Anton Weinmann considered the durian to belong to Castaneae as its fruit was similar to the horse chestnut.|$|E
500|$|At {{about the}} time that Waugh was {{discovering}} his affection for the Diary another writer, J. B. Priestley, was extolling it as an exemplar of English humour; Jerome K. Jerome, Priestley asserted, never wrote anything as good: [...] "oor Mr Pooter, with his simplicity, his timidity, his goodness of heart, is not simply a figure of fun but one of those innocent, lovable fools who are dear to the heart". In a 1943 essay, George Orwell considered the book an <b>accurate</b> <b>account</b> of English life in the 1880s. In describing Pooter he revived the Don Quixote analogy but saw this English equivalent as a sentimentalised version of the original, one who [...] "constantly suffers disasters brought upon him by his own folly". In the years after the Second World War the book's stock remained high; Osbert Lancaster deemed it [...] "a great work of art", and similar enthusiasm was expressed by a new generation of writers and social historians. Gillian Tindall, writing in 1970, thought the Diary [...] "the best comic novel in the language", and lauded Pooter as [...] "the presiding shade" [...] of his era. This accolade was echoed a further generation on by A. N. Wilson, who wrote in his study of the Victorian era: [...] "Who is to say that Oscar Wilde and Aubrey Beardsley are more typical of the [...] than the lower-middle class Charles and Carrie Pooter?" [...] Wilson also observed {{the extent to which the}} Pooters had become recognised as [...] "arbiters of the greatest good taste", as the late 20th-century English middle classes sought to acquire or preserve authentic Victorian features in their carefully crafted [...] "period" [...] homes. A Spectator article of 2008 remarks on how such houses as [...] "The Laurels", the humble habitats of 1890s City clerks, had by the 21st century become desirable £1 million-plus homes in what it terms [...] "banker land".|$|E
