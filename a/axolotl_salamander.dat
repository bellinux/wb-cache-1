40|$|Wound repair is an {{extremely}} complex process that requires precise coordination between various cell types including immune cells.   Unfortunately, in mammals this usually results in scar formation instead of restoration of the original fully functional tissue, otherwise known as regeneration.   Various animal models like frogs and salamanders are currently being studied to determine the intracellular and intercellular pathways, controlled by gene expression, that elicit cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration of cells during regenerative healing.   Now, the necessary genetic tools to map regenerative pathways are becoming available for the <b>axolotl</b> <b>salamander,</b> thus allowing comparative studies between scarring and regeneration.   Here, we describe in detail three methods to produce axolotl hematopoietic cell-tagged chimeras {{for the study of}} hematopoiesis and regeneration. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background: A microRNA, miR 499 c, {{has been}} {{discovered}} in hu-man fetal heart which rescues mutant hearts in cardiac nonfunction mutant <b>axolotl</b> (<b>salamander)</b> embryos and also induces the differen-tiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) to form into definitive cardiomyocytes. Results: Eight days after transfection with MiR 499 c, approximately 75 - 80 % of the stem cells develop typical cardiomyocyte morpholo-gies and express the cardiac specific marker, Troponin T, {{as well as the}} muscle proteins, tropomyosin and α-actinin, as shown by immu-nohistochemical staining. qRT-PCR confirms that transfection with MiR 499 c increases expression of troponin T and tropomyosin and further shows an increased expression of myosin as well as Wnt 11 and Sox 17. Untreated controls do not show significant expression of these proteins. Conclusion: It is evident that the miR 499 c induces the development of contractile myofibrils characteristic of striated cardiac muscle in-dicating that the miR 499 c microRNA {{plays an important role in}} the differentiation of cardiomyocytes...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} pointed out that the neural code may use {{multiplexing}} to encode unique information at different temporal. Here we investigate in detail the information encoded in the spiking activity of a neuron by computing the unique contribution that each temporal scale makes to it.

We propose the Information Jitter Derivative (IJD) method, which uses a jitter approach to modify the precision of the neural response. The IJD allows to infer the temporal scales playing a relevant role in the encoding of the information contained in the response of a neuron to a given set of stimuli. We validated the IJD on simulated data. We further demonstrated its usefulness on real neural responses recorded from the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) of the <b>axolotl</b> <b>salamander</b> and show that these cells carry the information about fine and coarse features of a visual scene using different temporal scales...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The Mexican <b>axolotl</b> <b>salamander</b> (Ambystoma mexicanum) is {{one member}} of {{a select group of}} {{vertebrate}} animals that have retained the amazing ability to regenerate multiple body parts. In addition to being an important model system for regeneration, the axolotl has also contributed extensively to studies of basic development. While many genes known to play key roles during development have now been implicated in various forms of regeneration, much of the regulatory apparatus controlling the underlying molecular circuitry remains unknown. In recent years, microRNAs have been identified as key regulators of gene expression during development, in many diseases and also, increasingly, in regeneration. Here, we have used deep sequencing combined with qRT-PCR to undertake a comprehensive identification of microRNAs involved in regulating regeneration in the axolotl. Specifically, among the microRNAs that we have found to be expressed in axolotl tissues, we have identified 4564 microRNA families known to be widely conserved among vertebrates, as well as 59, 811 reads of putative novel microRNAs. These findings support the hypothesis that microRNAs play key roles in managing the precise spatial and temporal patterns of gene expression that ensures the correct regeneration of missing tissues...|$|E
40|$|The acousticolateralis sensory {{system is}} {{characterized}} by a specific receptor cell type called the sensory hair cell and is found in all vertebrates. There are two types of hair cell sensory epithelia based on location: those of the inner ear, such as the organs for hearing and balance, and the lateral line system located within the epidermis. In mammals, including humans, loss or damage of the hair cells of the auditorysystem results in permanent hearing loss. However, {{this is not the case}} with birds and amphibians. Amphibians, with a lateral line system, are capable of replacing lost or damaged hair cells or hair cell epithelia, called neuromasts. This researcher is concerned with identifying the molecular clues used by the <b>axolotl</b> <b>salamander</b> to regulate this regeneration. Alcian blue staining was used to compare the extracellular matrix of normal and regenerating neruomasts. Alcian blue staining at two different pHs can distinguish between highly sulfated and non-sulfated forms of glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans. No differences could be found between control and regenerating hair cell epithelia. These results indicate that the level of sulfation is not involved in hair cell regeneration in the axolotl; however, it does not rule out a role for the extracellular matrix in this process, but rather suggests that more specific probes are needed for further investigation...|$|E

40|$|SummaryObjectiveKnowledge of {{mechanisms}} directing diarthrodial {{joint development}} {{may be useful}} in understanding joint pathologies and identifying new therapies. We have previously established that <b>axolotl</b> <b>salamanders</b> can fully repair large articular cartilage lesions, which {{may be due to the}} presence of an interzone-like tissue in the intra-articular space. Study objectives were to further characterize axolotl diarthrodial joint structure and determine the differentiation potential of interzone-like tissue in a skeletal microenvironment. DesignDiarthrodial joint morphology and expression of aggrecan, brother of CDO (BOC), type I collagen, type II collagen, and growth/differentiation factor 5 (GDF 5) were examined in femorotibial joints of sexually mature (> 12 months) axolotls. Joint tissue cellularity was evaluated in individuals from 2 to 24 months of age. Chondrogenic potential of the interzone was evaluated by placing interzone-like tissue into 4  mm tibial defects. ResultsCavitation reached completion in the femoroacetabular and humeroradial joints, but an interzone-like tissue was retained in the intra-articular space of distal limb joints. Joint tissue cellularity decreased to 7 months of age and then remained stable. Gene expression patterns of joint markers are broadly similar in developing mammals and mature axolotls. When interzone-like tissue was transplanted into critical size skeletal defects, an accessory joint developed within the defect site. ConclusionsThese experiments indicate that mature axolotl diarthrodial joints are phenotypically similar to developing synovial joints in mammals. Generation of an accessory joint by interzone-like tissue suggests multipotent cellular differentiation potential similar to that of interzone cells in the mammalian fetus. The data support the axolotl as a novel vertebrate model for joint development and repair...|$|R
40|$|Most {{spinal cord}} {{injuries}} lead to permanent paralysis in mammals. By contrast, the remarkable regenerative abilities of salamanders enable full functional recovery even from complete spinal cord transections. The molecular differences underlying this evolutionary divergence between mammals and amphibians are poorly understood. We focused on upstream regulators of gene expression as primary entry points into this question. We identified a group of microRNAs (miRNAs) that are conserved between the Mexican <b>axolotl</b> <b>salamander</b> (Ambystoma mexicanum) and mammals but show marked cross-species differences in regulation patterns following spinal cord injury. We found that precise post-injury levels {{of one of these}} miRNAs (miR- 125 b) is essential for functional recovery, and guides correct regeneration of axons through the lesion site in a process involving the direct downstream target Sema 4 D in axolotls. Translating these results to a mammalian model, we increased miR- 125 b levels in the rat through mimic treatments following spinal cord transection. These treatments downregulated Sema 4 D and other glial-scar-related genes, and enhanced the animal’s functional recovery. Our study identifies a key regulatory molecule conserved between salamander and mammal, and shows that the expression of miR- 125 b and Sema 4 D must be carefully controlled in the right cells at the correct level to promote regeneration. We also show that these molecular components of the salamander’s regeneration-permissive environment can be experimentally harnessed to improve treatment outcomes for mammalian {{spinal cord injuries}}...|$|E
40|$|SummaryObjectiveThe {{ability to}} fully {{regenerate}} lost limbs {{has made the}} <b>axolotl</b> <b>salamander</b> (Ambystoma mexicanum) a valuable model for studies of tissue regeneration. The current experiments investigate the ability of these vertebrates to repair large articular cartilage defects and restore normal hyaline cartilage and joint structure independent of limb amputation. MethodsFull-thickness articular cartilage defects were made by resection of the medial femoral condyle {{to the level of}} the metaphysis. At 0, 2 days, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 18, 24, 36 and 48 weeks post-surgery, the repair process was analyzed on H&E and Safranin-O stained 7 μm tissue sections. Symmetric Kullback–Leibler (SKL) divergences were used to assess proteoglycan staining intensities. Immunohistochemistry was performed for collagen types I and II. ResultsA fibrous “interzone-like” tissue occupies the intraarticular space of the axolotl femorotibial joint and no evidence of joint cavitation was observed. By 4 weeks post-surgery, cells within the defect site exhibited morphological similarities to those of the interzone-like tissue. At 24 weeks, joint structure and cartilaginous tissue repair were confirmed by immunohistochemistry for collagen types I and II. Quantitation of Safranin-O staining indicated restoration of proteoglycan content by 18 weeks. ConclusionsThe axolotl femorotibial joint has morphological similarities to the developing mammalian diarthrodial joint. Cells in the intraarticular space may be homologous to the interzone tissue and contribute to intrinsic repair of full-thickness articular cartilage defects. Taken together, these results suggest that the axolotl may serve as a valuable model for the investigation of cellular and molecular mechanisms that achieve full articular cartilage repair...|$|E
40|$|Amphibian {{populations have}} been {{experiencing}} rapid declines worldwide {{in the past}} few decades. There are many proposed causations, including the use of agricultural chemicals such as herbicides. Glyphosate based herbicides {{are one of the most}} widely used herbicides. This study looks at the effects of different brands of glyphosate based herbicides, including those intended for aquatic use, on the survival and growth of <b>axolotl</b> <b>salamander</b> larvae. Out of the four brands of glyphosate herbicide (Aquamaster, Aquaneat, Helosate plus, and Roundup Pro), the survival rates of Roundup Pro were the lowest. Most mortality occurred between the 3 mg/L and 6 mg/L concentrations, during which all those treated with Roundup Pro died. The growth, measured in terms of total snout to tail length and also head width, appeared to be greatest in length for those larvae treated with Aquaneat brand herbicide. These results indicate that Roundup Pro is lethal at concentrations of 6 mg/L, and that the composition, which includes a surfactant, may be responsible. We subsequently tested the concentration at which different adjuvant surfactants meant for use with aquatic safe herbicides (Dyne-Amic, Kinetic, and Cygnet) affected larval growth and survival and compared results with Roundup Pro. The larvae exposed to the initial 5 mg/L concentration of Roundup Pro had total mortality, but survival was unaffected by exposure to aquatic safe surfactants at low concentrations. At high concentrations, Dyne-Amic and Kinetic significantly increased larval mortality while Cygnet did not. Of the surviving larvae, there was no difference in growth. The findings of this study are significant in that they give insight regarding how the use of herbicides could be contributing to the decline of amphibian populations...|$|E

40|$|In {{spite of}} {{numerous}} investigations of regenerating salamander limbs, {{little attention has}} been paid to the details of how joints are reformed. An understanding of the process and mechanisms of joint regeneration in this model system for tetrapod limb regeneration would provide insights into developing novel therapies for inducing joint regeneration in humans. To this end, we have used the <b>axolotl</b> (Mexican <b>Salamander)</b> model of limb regeneration to describe the morphology and the expression patterns of marker genes during joint regeneration in response to limb amputation. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the mechanisms of joint formation whether it be development or regeneration are conserved. We also have determined that defects in the epiphyseal region of both forelimbs and hind limbs in the axolotl are regenerated only when the defect is small. As is the case with defects in the diaphysis, there is a critical size above which the endogenous regenerative response is not sufficient to regenerate the joint. This non-regenerative response in an animal that has the ability to regenerate perfectly provides the opportunity to screen for the signaling pathways to induce regeneration of articular cartilage and joints...|$|R
40|$|A {{decline in}} renal {{function}} {{is associated with}} the degree of proteinuria and with histological findings of glomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis. Proteinuria is not only a marker of renal damage, but ultrafiltered proteins can be toxic to the kidney, thereby contributing to tubulo-interstitial damage. In this project, we evaluated the effects of albumin-bound fatty acids on renal damage in a model of persistent proteinuria, overload proteinuria, in 2 different species: the classical rat overload proteinuria and the <b>salamander</b> <b>axolotl.</b> The <b>salamander</b> kidney possesses normal closed nephrons but also open nephrons in which the tubule connects to the coloemic cavity. Injection of proteins in this cavity will lead to direct protein loading of the open tubules without possible protein modifications due to passage through the circulation that might occur in the rat model. We showed in both species that the contribution of albumin-bound oleic acid to the initiation and progression of chronic renal damage was only minor. Furthermore, we evaluated the contribution of tubular cells in the inflammatory and fibrotic response. For the contribution of tubular cells we specifically studied Kidney Injury Molecule- 1 (KIM- 1). KIM- 1 is a transmembrane tubular protein with unknown function, that is non-detectable in normal kidneys, but is markedly induced after renal injury. In addition, KIM- 1 ectodomain shedding into urine has been reported. We showed KIM- 1 induction in experimental overload proteinuria and in different proteinuric and fibrotic human renal diseases. KIM- 1 was primarily expressed at luminal sides of dedifferentiated proximal tubules in areas with fibrosis and inflammation. Furthermore, urinary KIM- 1 levels were related to tubular KIM- 1, inflammation and showed an inverse association with renal function but there was no significant association with proteinuria. In renal transplant recipients urinary KIM- 1 predicted renal function decline. The results indicate that the extent of tubular damage is reflected by KIM- 1 expression and shedding. Future studies should address whether urinary KIM- 1 excretion can also predict renal function decline in proteinuric nephropathies other than those observed in transplanted kidneys and should clarify the functional role of KIM- 1. ...|$|R

40|$|A common {{feature of}} {{development}} in most vertebrate models is the early segregation of the germ line from the soma. For example, in Xenopus and zebrafish embryos primordial germ cells (PGCs) are specified by germ plasm that is inherited from the egg; in mice, Blimp 1 expression in the epiblast mediates the commitment of cells to the germ line. How these disparate mechanisms of PGC specification evolved is unknown. Here, {{in order to identify}} the ancestral mechanism of PGC specification in vertebrates, we studied PGC specification in embryos from the <b>axolotl</b> (Mexican <b>salamander),</b> a model for the tetrapod ancestor. In the axolotl, PGCs develop within mesoderm, and classic studies have reported their induction from primitive ectoderm (animal cap). We used an axolotl animal cap system to demonstrate that signalling through FGF and BMP 4 induces PGCs. The role of FGF was then confirmed in vivo. We also showed PGC induction by Brachyury, in the presence of BMP 4. These conditions induced pluripotent mesodermal precursors that give rise to a variety of somatic cell types, in addition to PGCs. Irreversible restriction of the germ line did not occur until the mid-tailbud stage, days after the somatic germ layers are established. Before this, germline potential was maintained by MAP kinase signalling. We propose that this stochastic mechanism of PGC specification, from mesodermal precursors, is conserved in vertebrates...|$|R
40|$|The GPI-anchor is an {{established}} determinant of molecular localisation and various functional roles {{have been attributed}} to it. The newt GPI-anchored three-finger protein (TFP) Prod 1 is an important regulator of cell behaviour during limb regeneration, but it is unclear how it signals to the interior of the cell. Prod 1 was expressed by transfection in cultured newt limb cells and activated transcription and expression of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP 9) by a pathway involving ligand-independent activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signalling and phosphorylation of extracellular regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK 1 / 2). This was dependent on the presence of the GPI-anchor and critical residues in the α-helical region of the protein. Interestingly, Prod 1 in the <b>axolotl,</b> a <b>salamander</b> species that also regenerates its limbs, was shown to activate ERK 1 / 2 signalling and MMP 9 transcription despite being anchorless, and both newt and axolotl Prod 1 co-immunoprecipitated with the newt EGFR after transfection. The substitution of the axolotl helical region activated a secreted, anchorless version of the newt molecule. The activity of the newt molecule cannot therefore depend on a unique property conferred by the anchor. Prod 1 is a salamander-specific TFP and its interaction with the phylogenetically conserved EGFR has implications for our view of regeneration as an evolutionary variable...|$|R

40|$|Oxygen is {{critical}} for optimal bone regeneration. While <b>axolotls</b> and <b>salamanders</b> have retained the ability to regenerate whole limbs, mammalian regeneration is restricted to the distal tip of the digit (P 3) in mice, primates, and humans. Our previous study revealed the oxygen microenvironment during regeneration is dynamic and temporally influential in building and degrading bone. Given that regeneration is dependent on a dynamic and changing oxygen environment, {{a better understanding of}} the effects of oxygen during wounding, scarring, and regeneration, and better ways to artificially generate both hypoxic and oxygen replete microenvironments are essential to promote regeneration beyond wounding or scarring. To explore the influence of increased oxygen on digit regeneration in vivo daily treatments of hyperbaric oxygen were administered to mice during all phases of the entire regenerative process. Micro-Computed Tomography (μCT) and histological analysis showed that the daily application of hyperbaric oxygen elicited the same enhanced bone degradation response as two individual pulses of oxygen applied during the blastema phase. We expand past these findings to show histologically that the continuous application of hyperbaric oxygen during digit regeneration results in delayed blastema formation at a much more proximal location after amputation, and the deposition of better organized collagen fibers during bone formation. The application of sustained hyperbaric oxygen also delays wound closure and enhances bone degradation after digit amputation. Thus, hyperbaric oxygen shows the potential for positive influential control on the various phases of an epimorphic regenerative response...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Among {{vertebrates}} lens regeneration is {{most pronounced}} in newts, {{which have the}} ability to regenerate the entire lens throughout their lives. Regeneration occurs from the dorsal iris by transdifferentiation of the pigment epithelial cells. Interestingly, the ventral iris never contributes to regeneration. Frogs have limited lens regeneration capacity elicited from the cornea during pre-metamorphic stages. The <b>axolotl</b> is another <b>salamander</b> which, like the newt, regenerates its limbs or its tail with the spinal cord, but up until now all reports have shown that it does not regenerate the lens. Results Here we present a detailed analysis during different stages of axolotl development, and we show that despite previous beliefs the axolotl does regenerate the lens, however, only during a limited time after hatching. We have found that starting at stage 44 (forelimb bud stage) lens regeneration is possible for nearly two weeks. Regeneration occurs from the iris but, in contrast to the newt, regeneration can be elicited from either the dorsal or the ventral iris and, occasionally, even from both in the same eye. Similar studies in the zebra fish concluded that lens regeneration is not possible. Conclusions Regeneration of the lens is possible in the axolotl, but differs from both frogs and newts. Thus the axolotl iris provides a novel and more plastic strategy for lens regeneration. </p...|$|R

However, non-invasive imaging tools for assessing its cardiac function were so far not employed. In this study, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is introduced as a non-invasive technique to image heart function of axolotls. Three axolotls were imaged with magnetic resonance imaging using a retrospectively gated Fast Low Angle Shot cine sequence. Within one scanning session the axolotl heart was imaged three times in all planes, consecutively. Heart rate, ejection fraction, stroke volume and cardiac output were calculated using three techniques: (1) combined long-axis, (2) short-axis series, and (3) ultrasound (control for heart rate only). All values are presented as mean ± standard deviation. Heart rate (beats per minute) among different animals was 32. 2 ± 6. 0 (long axis), 30. 4 ± 5. 5 (short axis) and 32. 7 ± 4. 9 (ultrasound) and statistically similar regardless of the imaging method (p > 0. 05). Ejection fraction (%) was 59. 6 ± 10. 8 (long axis) and 48. 1 ± 11. 3 (short axis) and it differed significantly (p = 0. 019). Stroke volume (μl/beat) was 133. 7 ± 33. 7 (long axis) and 93. 2 ± 31. 2 (short axis), also differed significantly (p = 0. 015). Calculations were consistent among the animals and over three repeated measurements. The heart rate varied depending on depth of anaesthesia.

Although the sensory hair cells of the lateral line of this species have been shown to be able to regenerate, it is not known whether this also occurs in the inner ear. In fact, little is known about the hearing capabilities of the <b>axolotl</b> or other <b>salamander</b> species. I recorded auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) of six axolotls at eleven frequencies (0. 1, 0. 25, 0. 4, 0. 6, 0. 8, 1, 1. 5, 2, 3, 4, and 6 kHz) in order to produce baseline audiograms of underwater pressure sensitivity. Individuals were then subjected to a 48 -hour, 150 Hz sound exposure at approximately 170 dB (re 1 μPa). AEPs were then performed to measure hearing thresholds immediately after sound exposure and at 2, 4, and 8 days post-sound exposure (DPSE). In the baseline audiogram, axolotls were most sensitive at 600 Hz, with an additional peak of sensitivity at 3 kHz. Following sound exposure, axolotls experienced a 6 to 12 dB temporary threshold shift (TTS) after sound exposure, with TTS being greatest at low frequencies near the 150 Hz stimulus frequency (i. e., 100 and 250 Hz). Hearing sensitivity returned to control levels within 8 DPSE. This indicates that axolotls do possess the ability to recover hearing sensitivity after damage following acoustical trauma. This study is the first to document hearing loss in the axolotl. Future studies are needed to correlate this hearing loss and recovery to sensory hair cell loss and regeneration in the axolotl inner ear...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The Mexican axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum) is {{considered}} a hopeful monster because it exhibits an adaptive and derived mode of development - paedomorphosis - that has evolved rapidly and independently among tiger salamanders. Unlike related tiger salamanders that undergo metamorphosis, axolotls retain larval morphological traits into adulthood and thus present an adult body plan that differs dramatically from the ancestral (metamorphic) form. The basis of paedomorphic development was investigated by comparing temporal patterns of gene transcription between <b>axolotl</b> and tiger <b>salamander</b> larvae (Ambystoma tigrinum tigrinum) that typically undergo a metamorphosis. Results Transcript abundances from whole brain and pituitary were estimated via microarray analysis on four different days post hatching (42, 56, 70, 84 dph) and regression modeling was used to independently identify genes that were differentially expressed {{as a function of}} time in both species. Collectively, more differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified as unique to the axolotl (n = 76) and tiger salamander (n = 292) than were identified as shared (n = 108). All but two of the shared DEGs exhibited the same temporal pattern of expression and the unique genes tended to show greater changes later in the larval period when tiger salamander larvae were undergoing anatomical metamorphosis. A second, complementary analysis that directly compared the expression of 1320 genes between the species identified 409 genes that differed as a function of species or the interaction between time and species. Of these 409 DEGs, 84 % exhibited higher abundances in tiger salamander larvae at all sampling times. Conclusions Many of the unique tiger salamander transcriptional responses are probably associated with metamorphic biological processes. However, the axolotl also showed unique patterns of transcription early in development. In particular, the axolotl showed a genome-wide reduction in mRNA abundance across loci, including genes that regulate hypothalamic-pituitary activities. This suggests that an axolotls failure to undergo anatomical metamorphosis late in the larval period is indirectly associated with a mechanism(s) that acts earlier in development to broadly program transcription. The axolotl hopeful monster provides a model to identify mechanisms of early brain development that proximally and ultimately affect the expression of adult phenotypes. </p...|$|R

Spinal cord injuries (SCI) in mammals are major causes of physical disabilities. In contrast the Mexican <b>salamander</b> (<b>axolotl)</b> possesses amazing regenerative capabilities and can regenerate a fully functional spinal cord after injury. We {{have attempted to}} identify the molecular determinants underlying this evolutionary divergence by undertaking a detailed comparative analysis of a regenerative model, the axolotl spinal cord, and a corresponding non-regenerative system, rat spinal cord after injury. This approach identified {{a small number of}} highly conserved microRNAs that are differentially regulated in axolotl versus. Detailed in vivo studies of one of these microRNAs, miR- 125 b that is highly expressed in axolotl but low in rat has identified it as a key regulator of the regenerative response in axolotl. We also found that upregulation of miR- 125 b after injury improves SC repair in rats. In addition, we have identified SEMA 4 D as a target gene regulated by this microRNA after SCI in both axolotl and rat. We also studied how this miRNA is regulated in the axolotl to promote regeneration after SCI. We found that in the absence of injury, actin cytoskeleton de-polymerization induced by Cytochalasin D (Cyto D) induced a decrease in miR- 125 b expression similar to the decrease induced by injury in axolotl. Analyses of the regulatory region of the miR- 125 b axolotl gene revealed predicted binding sites for c-Fos. When we performed SCI in axolotls, we observed an increase in the expression of c-Fos 1 day after injury. As expected, we found that in the absence of injury, treatment with Cyto D induced similar changes in c-Fos expression similar to injury. Lastly, we proposed the development of a 3 D in vitro co-culture model system to study at the cellular and molecular level how miR- 125 b SCI regulates the response to injury in rats and whether miR- 125 b expression is regulated by biomechanical activation of the Rho-c-Fos pathway. The proposed model will allow better imaging, better spatial and temporal control over modulating microRNA and gene expression in different cells at different time points. Our overall data suggest that dynamic changes in the actin cytoskeleton after injury induces changes in miR- 125 b expression, possibly through activation of cFos in the RhoA pathway, to create a permissive environment for regeneration in axolotls...|$|R
