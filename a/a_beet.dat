5|$|After {{learning}} {{that they have}} lost Prestige Direct, Jim, Dwight and Harry retreat outside for a coffee break. They end up having a conversation over {{what they would do}} with their lives, if they were not working for Dunder Mifflin. Jim jokingly says that he would be <b>a</b> <b>beet</b> growing competitor during the national contests while Harry would retire after selling one big item such as an airplane. Before he leaves, Harry says that Robert will be the ruin of the company and says they will not be working for Dunder Mifflin in six months, leaving a look of concern on Dwight and Jim's faces.|$|E

This vehicle is currently on display at Bovington Tank Museum, in Dorset, UK.|$|E
25|$|As of 2015 about 4.4 {{million people}} have sickle-cell disease while an {{additional}} 43 million have sickle-cell trait. About 80% of sickle-cell disease cases are believed to occur in sub-Saharan Africa. It also occurs relatively frequently in parts of India, the Arabian peninsula, and among people of African origin living {{in other parts of}} the world. In 2015, it resulted in about 114,800 deaths. The condition was first described in the medical literature by the American physician James B. Herrick in 1910. In 1949 the genetic transmission was determined by E. <b>A.</b> <b>Beet</b> and J. V. Neel. In 1954 the protective effect against malaria of sickle-cell trait was described.|$|E

25|$|Past {{industries}} {{were more}} strongly {{connected to the}} rural economy, such as <b>a</b> <b>beet</b> sugar factory in Scawby Brook, a livestock market, and Spring's jam factory; the latter being a nationally known brand. A corn exchange {{was built in the}} town in the 1800s, and the local corn prices were quoted nationally. Scawby Brook was also home to Bratleys roller flour mill, which was demolished in the 1940s although several of the old houses built for the mill owners in the 1830s remain, formerly known as mill place, now numbers 83-91 Scawby Road. The town was home to the Falcon Cycles factory for much of its independent existence, the company having moved to Brigg from nearby Barton-upon-Humber in the early 1900s.|$|E
500|$|In several interviews, {{producer}} Guido Henkel {{stated that}} he was increasingly frustrated by the pressure the management of Interplay put on the development team after Interplay's initial public offering. Although only a few additional subplots and characters had to be discarded to meet the planned release date, he accused the Interplay management of disregarding the development team regarding things like package design and marketing. Henkel {{said that it was}} his main goal to prevent the game from being [...] "crippled" [...] before leaving Interplay when the game reached beta status. He also made the claim that his overall influence on the game was greater than that of Chris Avellone, Eric Campanella, or Dave Maldonaldo, but since a producer often has to make unpopular decisions his role was later downplayed. In 2011 Henkel also revealed that The Nameless One's face on game box art is based on his real face, {{due to the fact that}} the day before the cover photo shoot was scheduled to take place, the model contracted to appear on the box backed out over a scheduling conflict, so Guido Henkel was proposed to use his face. Make up lasted for about two hours, and photography took 45 minutes, Henkel said: [...] "My face was red as <b>a</b> <b>beet</b> and burned for the rest of the day, because of the solvent that was used to remove the appliances. Nonetheless, it was all well worth it".|$|E
2500|$|The {{presence}} of P. falciparum in human populations has exerted selective {{pressure on the}} human genome. E. <b>A.</b> <b>Beet,</b> a doctor working in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) had observed in 1948 that sickle-cell disease was related to lower rate of malaria infection. This suggestion was reiterated by J. B. S. Haldane in 1948, who suggested that thalassaemia could provide similar protection. This hypothesis has since been confirmed and extended to hemoglobin E, hemoglobin C and Haemoglobin S.|$|E

2500|$|A common {{mnemonic}} used {{to describe}} the physiologic manifestations of atropine overdose is: [...] "hot as a hare, blind as a bat, dry as a bone, red as <b>a</b> <b>beet,</b> and mad as a hatter". [...] These associations reflect the specific changes of warm, dry skin from decreased sweating, blurry vision, decreased sweating/lacrimation, vasodilation, and central nervous system effects on muscarinic receptors, type 4 and 5. [...] This set of symptoms is known as anticholinergic toxidrome, and may also be caused by other drugs with anticholinergic effects, such as hyoscine hydrobromide (scopolamine), diphenhydramine, phenothiazine antipsychotics and benztropine.|$|E

As soon as Hughes exited the H-1 when he crashed it in <b>a</b> <b>beet</b> field south of Santa Ana, California, his only comment was: [...] "We can fix her; she'll go faster."

2500|$|Dwight Kurt Schrute III [...] is {{a fictional}} {{character}} on the American TV comedy series The Office, portrayed by Rainn Wilson, {{and based on}} Gareth Keenan from the original UK version of The Office. His character {{is one of the}} highest-ranking salesmen as well as assistant to the regional manager at the paper distribution company Dunder Mifflin, although the series expands on his character as bed-and-breakfast proprietor at Schrute Farms, <b>a</b> <b>beet</b> plantation, and as the owner of the business park enclosing Dunder Mifflin. He is notorious for his lack of social skills and common sense, his love for martial arts and the justice system, and his office rivalry with fellow salesman Jim Halpert. He has at times risen to the position of acting Branch Manager of the Scranton branch, but often serves as a second or third in command as Assistant (to the) Regional Manager. In the final season, Dwight is finally offered the position of permanent Regional Manager.|$|E
